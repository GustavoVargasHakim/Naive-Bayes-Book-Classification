Introduction to Microbiology
Welcome to the wonderful world of microbiology! Yay! So. What is microbiology? If we break the
word down it translates to “the study of small life,” where the small life refers to microorganisms or

microbes. But who are the microbes? And how small are they?
Generally microbes can be divided into two categories: the cellular microbes (or organisms) and the
acellular microbes (or agents). In the cellular camp we have the bacteria, the archaea, the fungi, and the
protists (a bit of a grab bag composed of algae, protozoa, slime molds, and water molds). Cellular
microbes can be either unicellular, where one cell is the entire organism, or multicellular, where
hundreds, thousands or even billions of cells can make up the entire organism. In the acellular camp we
have the viruses and other infectious agents, such as prions and viroids.
In this textbook the focus will be on the bacteria and archaea (traditionally known as the “prokaryotes,”)
and the viruses and other acellular agents.

Characteristics of Microbes
Obviously microbes are small. The traditional definition describes microbes as organisms or agents that
are invisible to the naked eye, indicating that one needs assistance in order to see them. That assistance
is typically in the form of a microscope of some type. The only problem with that definition is that there
are microbes that you can see without a microscope. Not well, but you can see them. It would be easy to
dismiss these organisms as non-microbes, but in all other respects they look/act/perform like other wellstudied microbes (who follow the size restriction).
So, the traditional definition is modified to describe microbes as fairly simple agents/organisms that are
not highly differentiated, meaning even the multicellular microbes are composed of cells that can act
independently– there is no set division of labor. If you take a giant fungus and chop half the cells off, the
remaining cells will continue to function unimpeded. Versus if you chopped half my cells off, well, that
would be a problem. Multicellular microbes, even if composed of billions of cells, are relatively simple
in design, usually composed of branching filaments.
It is also acknowledged that research in the field of microbiology will require certain common
techniques, largely related to the size of the quarry. Because microbes are so small and there are so
many around, it is important to be able to isolate the one type that you are interested in. This involves
methods of sterilization, to prevent unwanted contamination, and observation, to confirm that you have
fully isolated the microbe that you want to study.

Microbe Size
Since size is a bit of theme in microbiology, let us talk about actual measurements. How small is small?
The cellular microbes are typically measured in micrometers (µm). A typical bacterial cell (let us say
E. coli) is about 1 µm wide by 4 µm long. A typical protozoal cell (let us say Paramecium) is about 25
µm wide by 100 µm long. There are 1000 µm in every millimeter, so that shows why it is difficult to see
most microbes without assistance. (An exception would be a multicellular microbe, such as a fungus. If
you get enough cells together in one place, you can definitely see them without a microscope!)
When we talk about the acellular microbes we have to use an entirely different scale. A typical virus (let
us say influenza virus) has a diameter of about 100 nanometers (nm). There are 1000 nanometers in
every micrometer, so that shows why you need a more powerful microscope to see a virus. If a typical

bacterium (let us pick on E.coli again) were inflated to be the size of the Statue of Liberty, a typical
virus (again, influenza virus works) would be the size of an adult human, if we keep the correct
proportions.

The Discovery of Microbes
The small size of microbes definitely hindered their discovery. It is hard to get people to believe that
their skin is covered with billions of small creatures, if you cannot show it to them. “Seeing is
believing,” that is what I always say. Or someone says that.
In microbiology, there are two people that are given the credit for the discovery of microbes. Or at least
providing the proof of their discovery, both around the same time period:

Robert Hooke (1635-1703)
Robert Hooke was a scientist who used a compound microscope, or microscope with two lenses in
tandem, to observe many different objects. He made detailed drawings of his observations, publishing
them in the scientific literature of the day, and is credited with publishing the first drawings of
microorganisms. In 1665 he published a book by the name of Micrographia, with drawing of microbes
such as fungi, as well as other organisms and cell structures. His microscopes were restricted in their
resolution, or clarity, which appeared to limit what microbes he was able to observe.

Antony van Leeuwenhoek (1632-1723)
Antony van Leeuwenhoek was a Dutch cloth merchant, who also happened to dabble in microscopes.
He constructed a simple microscope (which has a single lens), where the lens was held between two
silver plates. Apparently he relished viewing microbes from many different sample types – pond water,
fecal material, teeth scrapings, etc. He made detailed drawings and notes about his observations and
discoveries, sending them off to the Royal Society of London, the scientific organization of that time.
This invaluable record clearly indicates that he saw both bacteria and a wide variety of protists. Some
microbiologists refer to van Leeuwenhoek as the “Father of Microbiology,” because of his
contributions to the field.

Microbial Groups
Classification of organisms, or the determination of how to group them, continually changes as we
acquire new information and new tools of assessing the characteristics of an organism. Currently all
organisms are grouped into one of three categories or domains: Bacteria, Archaea, and Eukarya. The
Three Domain Classification, first proposed by Carl Woese in the 1970s, is based on ribosomal RNA
(rRNA) sequences and widely accepted by scientists today as the most accurate current portrayal of
organism relatedness.

Tree of Life.

Bacteria
The Bacteria domain contains some of the best known microbial examples (E. coli, anyone?). Most of
the members are unicellular, cells lack a nucleus or any other organelle, most members have a cell wall
with a particular substance known as peptidoglycan (not found anywhere else but in bacteria!), and
humans are intimately familiar with many members, since they are common in soil, water, our foods,

and our own bodies.

Archaea
Archaea is a relatively new domain, since these organisms used to be grouped with the bacteria. There
are some obvious similarities, since they are mostly unicellular and cells lack a nucleus or any other
organelle. But they have completely different cell walls that vary markedly in composition (but notably
lack peptidoglycan) and their rRNA sequences have shown that they are not closely related to the
Bacteria at all. In fact, they appear to be more closely related to the eukaryotes! These organisms are
found in soil, water, even sometimes in the human body, but they are also found in some very extreme
environments on Earth – very cold, very hot, very salty, very pressurized, very acidic, earning them the
commonly used name “the extremophiles,” or extreme-loving organisms.

Eukarya
The Eukarya Domain includes many non-microbes, such as animals and plants, but there are numerous
microbial examples as well, such as fungi, protists, slime molds, and water molds. The eukaryotic cell
type has a nucleus, as well as many organelles, such as mitochondria or endoplasmic reticulum.

Viruses
Viruses are not part of the Three Domain Classification, since they lack ribosomes and therefore lack
rRNA sequences for comparison. They are classified separately, using characteristics specific to viruses.
Viruses are typically described as “obligate intracellular parasites,” a reference to their strict
requirement for a host cell in order to replicate or increase in number. These acellular entities are often
agents of disease, a result of their cell invasion.

Taxonomic Ranks
Taxonomic ranks are a way for scientists to organize information about organisms, by determining
relatedness. Domains are the largest grouping used, followed by numerous smaller groupings, where
each smaller grouping consists of organisms that share specific features in common. Each level becomes
more and more restrictive as to whom can be a member. Eventually we get down to genus and species,
the groupings used for formation of a scientific name. This is the binomial nomenclature devised by
Carl Linnaeus in the 1750s.

Binomial Nomenclature
When referring to the actual scientific name assigned to an organism, it is important to follow
convention, so it is clear to everyone that you are referring to the scientific name. There are rules in
science (just like in English class, where you would never refer to “mr. robert louis stevenson,” or at
least not without expecting to get your paper back with red all over it).
A scientific name is composed of a genus and a species, where the genus is a generic name and the
species is specific. The species name, once assigned, is permanent for the organism, while the genus can
change if new information becomes available. For example, the bacterium previously known as
Streptococcus faecalis is now Enterococcus faecalis because sequencing information indicates that it is
more closely related to the members of the Enterococcus genus. It is important to note that it is
inappropriate to refer to an organism by the species alone (i.e. you should never refer to E. coli as “coli”
alone. Other bacteria can have the species “coli” as well.)
Now for the rules: The genus is always capitalized. The species is always lowercase. And both the genus
and the species are italicized (common if typewritten) or underlined (common if handwritten). The

genus may be shortened to its starting letter, but only if the name has been referred to in the text in its
entirety at least once first (the exception to this is E. coli, due to its commonality, where hardly anyone
spells out the Escherichia genus anymore).

Microscopes
You have probably figured out that microbes (AKA microorganisms) are pretty small, right? Yeah, well,
size isn’t everything. But numbers, that is something. If you were to take one gram of soil and start
counting the microbes in it at a rate of 1 microbe/second, it would take you over 33 years to complete
your counting. Then most of you would be in your 50s and having a mid-life crisis, so let’s not go
there…but the small size of microbes certainly has made it difficult to study them, particularly in the
beginning. (If you want a visual idea of scale, check out the Cell Size and Scale tool, which allows you
to zoom in from a coffee bean to a carbon atom. Be sure to pay careful attention to the microbes in
between!)
O.k., if you want to see something really, really, really small, who ya gonna call? Not Ghostbusters TM,
that’s for sure. I would try someone with a microscope. (Microscope Man? Maybe not.) Now I will
admit, with the advent of molecular biology there’s a lot of microbiology nowadays that happens
without a microscope. But if you want to actually visualize microbes, you’ll need the ability to magnify
– you’ll need a microscope of some type. And, since “seeing is believing,” it was the visualization of
microbes that got people interested in them in the first place.

Microscopy in the 1600s
It is believed that Robert Hooke was one of the first scientists to actually observe microbes, in 1665.
His illustrations and observations from a variety of objects viewed under a microscope were published
in the book Micrographia. Hooke used a compound microscope, meaning it contained two sets of
lenses for magnification: the ocular lens next to the eye and the objective lens, next to the specimen or
object. The magnification of a compound microscope is a product of the ocular lens magnification and
the objective lens magnification. Thus a microscope with an ocular magnification of 10x and an
objective magnification of 50x would have a total magnification of 500x. You can see a drawing of
Hooke’s microscope.
Antonie van Leeuwenhoek, often called the “Father of Microbiology,” wasn’t a scientist by profession.
He was a cloth merchant from Holland who was believed to be inspired by Mr. Hooke’s work, probably
with the original intention of examining textiles to determine quality. Very quickly van Leeuwenhoek
started examining just about everything under the microscope and we know this because he kept detailed
notes about both his samples and his observations. Van Leeuwenhoek was using what is called a simple
microscope, a microscope with just a single lens. Essentially, it is a magnifying glass. But the lenses
that he produced were of such high quality that he is given credit for the discovery of single-celled life
forms. You can learn more about van Leeuwenhoek’s observations.

Modern Microscopy: Light Microscopes
Let us face it, a modern microscope is a pretty technical tool, even one of the cheaper versions. If you
want to understand the limitations of a light microscope you have to understand concepts like resolution,
wavelength, and numerical aperture, where their relationship to one another is summed up by the Abbé
equation:

In microscopy the definition of resolution is typically the ability of a lens to distinguish two objects that
are close together. So, in the Abbé equation d becomes the minimal distance where two objects next to
one another can be resolved or distinguished as individual objects. Resolution is dependent upon the
wavelength of illumination being used, where a shorter wavelength will result in a smaller d. Lastly, we
have the effect of the numerical aperture, which is a function of the objective lens and its ability to
gather light. The numerical aperture value is actually defined by two components: n, which is the
refractive index of the medium the lens is working in, and sin θ, which is a measurement of the cone of
light that enters the objective. A lens can typically work in two media: air, with a refractive index of
1.00, or oil, with a refractive index of 1.25. Oil will allow more of the light to be collected, by directing

more of the light rays into the objective lens. The maximum total magnification for a microscope using
visual light for illumination is around 1500X, where the microscope might have 15x oculars and a 100x
oil immersion objective. The highest resolution possible is around 0.2 μm. If objects or cells are closer
together than this, they can’t be distinguished as separate entities.
Here’s a nice description from Nikon, including an interactive tutorial on numerical aperture and image
resolution. And then there are so many microscopes, so little time! The type that you need depends upon
the specific type of microbes that you want to visualize.
For light microscopes there are six different types of microscopes, all using light as the source of
illumination: bright-field microscope, dark-field microscope, phase contrast microscope, differential
interference contrast (DIC), fluorescence microscope, and confocal scanning laser microscope (CSLM).
Let us look at the details of each type:

Bright-field Microscope
The bright-field microscope is your standard microscope that you could purchase for your niece or
nephew at any toy store. Here is a website on the basic parts of a bright-field compound microscope, in
case you are not enrolled in the general microbiology lab. The specimen is illuminated by a light source
at the base of the microscope and then initially magnified by the objective lens, before being magnified
again by the ocular lens. Remember that the total magnification achieved is a product of the
magnification of both lenses.
The specimen is typically visualized because of differences in contrast between the specimen itself and
its surrounding environment. But that does not apply to unstained bacteria, which have very little
contrast with their environment, unless the cells are naturally pigmented. That is why staining (see
section below) is such an important concept in microscopy. A bright-field microscope will work
reasonably well to view the larger eukaryotic microbes (i.e. protozoa, algae) without stain, but unstained
bacteria will be almost invisible. Stained bacteria will appear dark against a bright background (ah, I
knew that there was a reason for the term “bright-field.”)

Bright-Field Microscope

Dark-field Microscope
The dark-field microscope is really just a slightly modified bright-field microscope. In fact, you could
make this modification to the microscope you have at home! It makes use of what is known as a darkfield stop, an opaque disk that blocks light directly underneath the specimen so that light reaches it from
the sides. The result is that only light that has been reflected or refracted by the specimen will be
collected by the objective lens, resulting in cells that appear bright against a dark background (thus the
term “dark-field.” Yes, it’s all making sense now). This allows for observation of living, unstained cells
which is particularly nice if you want to observe motility or eukaryotic organelles.

Phase Contrast Microscope
The phase-contrast microscope is also a modified bright-field microscope, although the modifications
are getting more complex, as well as more expensive. This microscope also uses an opaque ring or
annular stop, but this one has a transparent ring that only releases light in a hollow cone. The principle
of this microscope gets back to the idea of refractive index and the fact that cells have a different
refractive index than their surroundings, resulting in light that differs slightly in phase. The difference is
amplified by a phase ring found in a special phase objective. The phase differences can be translated into
differences in brightness, resulting in a dark image amidst a bright background. This allows for the
observation of living, unstained cells, once again useful to observe motility or eukaryotic organelles.

Phase Contrast Microscope Mechanics.

Differential Interference Contrast (DIC) Microscope
The differential interference contrast microscope operates on much the same principle as the phasecontrast microscope, by taking advantage of the differences in refractive index of a specimen and its
surroundings. But it uses polarized light that is then split into two beams by a prism. One beam of light
passes through the specimen, the other passes through the surrounding area. When the beams are
combined via a second prism they “interfere” with one another, due to being out of phase. The resulting
images have an almost 3D effect, useful for observing living, unstained cells.

Differential Contrast Microscope Mechanism.

Fluorescence Microscope
A fluorescence microscope utilizes light that has been emitted from a specimen, rather than passing
through it. A mercury-arc lamp is used to generate an intense beam of light that is filtered to produce a
specific wavelength of light directed at the specimen by use of dichromatic mirror, which reflects short
wavelengths and transmits longer wavelengths. Naturally fluorescent organisms will absorb the shortwavelengths and emit fluorescent light with a longer wavelength that will pass through the dichromatic
mirror and can be visualized. There are a variety of microbes with natural fluorescence but there are
certainly far more organisms that lack this quality. Visualization of the latter organisms depends upon
the use of fluorochromes, fluorescent dyes that bind to specific cell components. The fluorochromes
can also be attached to antibodies, to highlight specific structures or areas of the cell, or even different
organisms.

Fluorescence Microscope Mechanism.

Confocal Scanning Laser Microscope (CSLM)
In order to understand how a confocal scanning laser microscope works, it is helpful to understand
how a fluorescence microscope works, so hopefully you already read the previous section. A CSLM
uses a laser for illumination, due to the high intensity. The light is directed at dichromatic mirrors that
move, “scanning” the specimen. The longer wavelengths emitted by the fluorescently stained specimen
pass back through the mirrors, through a pinhole, and are measured by a detector. The pinhole serves to
conjugate the focal point of the lens (ah, that’s where the term confocal came from!), which means it

allows for complete focus of a given point. Since the entire specimen is scanned in the x-z planes (all
three axes), the information acquired by the detector can be compiled by a computer to create a single
3D image entirely in focus. This is a particularly useful tool for viewing complex structures such as
biofilms.

Confocal Scanning Laser Microscope Mechanism.

Staining
Most of the microbes, particularly unicellular microbes, would not be apparent without the help of
staining. It helps to make something so small a bit easier to see, by providing contrast between the
microorganism and its background. A simple stain makes use of a single dye, either to stain the cells
directly (direct stain) or to stain the background surrounding the cells (negative stain). From this a
researcher can gather basic information about a cell’s size, morphology (shape), and cell arrangement.
There are also more complex stains, known as differential stains, that combine stains to allow for
differentiation of organisms based on their characteristics. The Gram stain, developed in 1884, is the
most common differential stain used in microbiology, where bacterial cells are separated based on their
cell wall type: gram positive bacteria which stain purple and gram negative bacteria which stain pink.
Some bacteria have a specialized cell wall that must be stained with the acid-fast stain, where acid-fast
bacteria stain red and non-acid-fast bacteria stain blue. Other differential stains target specific bacterial
structures, such as endospores, capsules, and flagella, to be talked about later.

Even More Modern Microscopy: Electron Microscopes
Light microscopes are great if you are observing eukaryotic microbes and they might work for observing
bacteria and archaea, but they are not going to work at all to observe viruses. Remember that the limit of

resolution for a light microscope is 0.2 μm or 200 nm and most viruses are smaller than that. So, we
need something more powerful. Enter the electron microscopes, which replace light with electrons for
visualization. Since electrons have a wavelength of 1.23 nm (as opposed to the 530 nm wavelength of
blue-green light), resolution increases to around 0.5 nm, with magnifications over 150,000x. The
drawback of using electrons is that they must be contained in a vacuum, eliminating the possibility of
working with live cells. There is also some concern that the extensive sample preparation might distort
the specimen’s characteristics or cause artifacts to form.
There are two different types of electron microscope, the transmission electron microscope (TEM) and
the scanning electron microscope (SEM):

Transmission Electron Microscope (TEM)
The transmission electron microscope utilizes an electron beam directed at the specimen with the use
of electromagnets. Dense areas scatter the electrons, resulting in a dark area on the image, while
electrons can pass (or “transmit”) through the less dense areas, resulting in a brighter section. The image
is generated on a fluorescent screen and can then be captured.
Since the electrons are easily scattered by extremely thick specimens, samples must be sliced down to
20-100 nm in thickness, typically by being embedded in some type of plastic and then being cut with a
diamond knife into extremely thin sections. The resulting pictures represent one slice or plane of the
specimen.

Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM)
The scanning electron microscope also utilizes an electron beam but the image is formed from
secondary electrons that were released from the surface of the specimen and then collected by a detector.
More electrons are released from raised areas of the specimen, while less secondary electrons will be
collected from sunken areas. In addition, the electron beam is scanned over the specimen surface,
producing a 3D image of the external features.
If you want to see some beautiful TEM and SEM photomicrographs, check out Dennis Kunkel’s site.
Most have been colorized, but they are quite stunning. On the other end of the spectrum, here are
pictures taken with the Intel Play QX3, a plastic microscope for children. Be careful, you could get lost
in this website. But it is great to see what an inexpensive microscope can produce in the hands of
someone who knows what they’re doing! These pictures are stunning as well.

Welcome to 21st Century Microscopy: Scanning Probe
Microscopes
As technology has advanced, even more powerful microscopes have been invented, ones that can even
allow for visualization at the atomic level. These microscopes can be used in microbiology but more
often they are used in other fields, to allow visualization of chemicals, metals, magnetic samples, and
nanoparticles, wherever the 0.1 nm resolution and 100,000,000x magnification might be needed.
The scanning probe microscopes are thus named because they move some type of probe over a
specimen’s surface in the x-z planes, allowing computers to generate an extremely detailed 3D image of
the specimen. Resolution is so high because the probe size is much smaller than the wavelength of either
visible light or electrons. Both microscopes can be used to study objects in liquid, allowing for the
examination of biological molecules. There are two different types of scanning probe microscopes, the
scanning tunneling microscope (STM) and the atomic force microscope (AFM):

Scanning Tunneling Microscope (STM)
The scanning tunneling microscope has an extremely sharp probe, 1 atom thick, that maintains a

constant voltage with the specimen surface allowing electrons to travel between them. This tunneling
current is maintained by raising and lowering the probe to sustain a constant height above the sample.
The resulting motion is tracked by a computer, which generates the final image.

Scanning Tunneling Microscope Mechanism.

Atomic Force Microscope (AFM)
The atomic force microscope was developed as an alternative to the STM, for use with samples that do
not conduct electricity well. The microscope utilizes a cantilever with an extremely sharp probe tip that
maintains a constant height above the specimen, typically by direct contact with the sample. Movement
of the cantilever to maintain this contact deflects a laser beam, translating into an image of the object.
Once again, computers are used to generate the image.

Cell Structure
You say “procaryote,” I say “prokaryote,” you say “eucaryote,” I say “eukaryote”….well, however, you
spell them, it’s the next topic.
Traditionally, cellular organisms have been divided into two broad categories, based on their cell type.
They are either prokaryotic or eukaryotic. In general, prokaryotes are smaller, simpler, with a lot less
stuff, which would make eukaryotes larger, more complex, and more cluttered. The crux of their key
difference can be deduced from their names: “karyose” is a Greek word meaning “nut” or “center,” a
reference to the nucleus of a cell. “Pro” means “before,” while “Eu” means “true,” indicating that
prokaryotes lack a nucleus (“before a nucleus”) while eukaryotes have a true nucleus. More recently,
microbiologists have been rebelling against the term prokaryote because it lumps both bacteria and the
more recently discovered archaea in the same category. Both cells are prokaryotic because they lack a
nucleus and other organelles (such as mitochondria, Golgi apparatus, endoplasmic reticulum, etc), but
they aren’t closely related genetically. So, to honor these differences this text will refer to the groups as
the archaea, the bacteria, and the eukaryotes and try to leave the prokaryotic reference out of it.

Cell Morphology
Cell morphology is a reference to the shape of a cell. It might seem like a trivial concept but to a cell it
is not. The shape dictates how that cell will grow, reproduce, obtain nutrients, move, and it’s important
to the cell to maintain that shape to function properly. Cell morphology can be used as a characteristic to
assist in identifying particular microbes but it’s important to note that cells with the same morphology
are not necessarily related.
Bacteria tend to display the most representative cell morphologies, with the most common examples
listed here:

Bacterial Cell Morphologies.
Coccus (pl. cocci) – a coccus is a spherically shaped cell.
Bacillus (pl. bacilli) – a bacillus is a rod-shaped cell.
Curved rods – obviously this is a rod with some type of curvature. There are three subcategories: the vibrio, which are rods with a single curve and the spirilla/spirochetes, which
are rods that form spiral shapes. Spirilla and spirochetes are differentiated by the type of
motility that they exhibit, which means it is hard to separate them unless you are looking at a
wet mount.
Pleomorphic – pleomorphic organisms exhibit variability in their shape.
There are additional shapes seen for bacteria, and an even wider array for the archaea, which have even
been found as star or square shapes. Eukaryotic microbes also tend to exhibit a wide array of shapes,
particularly the ones that lack a cell wall such as the protozoa.

Cell Size
Cell size, just like cell morphology, is not a trivial matter either, to a cell. There are reasons why most
archaeal/bacterial cells are much smaller than eukaryotic cells. Much of it has to do with the advantages
derived from being small. These advantages relate back to the surface-to-volume ratio of the cell, a
ratio of the external cellular layer in contact with the environment compared to the liquid inside. This
ratio changes as a cell increases in size. Let us look at a 2 μm cell in comparison with a cell that is twice
as large at 4 μm.

r = 1 μm
surface area = 12.6 μm2
volume = 4.2 μm3

r = 2 μm
surface area = 50.3 μm2
volume = 33.5 μm3

The surface-to-volume ratio of the smaller cell is 3, while the surface-to-volume ratio of the larger cell

decreases to 1.5. Think of the cell surface as the ability of the cell to bring in nutrients and let out waste
products. The larger the surface area, the more possibilities exist for engaging in these activities. Based
on this, the larger cell would have an advantage. Now think of the volume as representing what the cell
has to support. As the surface-to-volume ratio goes down, it indicates that the cell has less of an
opportunity to bring in the nutrients needed to support the cell’s activities – activities such as growth and
reproduction. So, small cells grow and reproduce faster. This also means that they evolve faster over
time, giving them more opportunities to adapt to environments.
Keep in mind that the size difference (bacterial/archaeal cells = smaller, eukaryotic cells = larger) is on
average. A typical bacterial/archaeal cell is a few micrometers in size, while a typical eukarytotic cell is
about 10x larger. There are a few monster bacteria that fall outside the norm in size and still manage to
grow and reproduce very quickly. One such example is Thiomargarita namibiensis, which can measure
from 100-750 μm in length, compared to the more typical 4 μm length of E. coli. T. namibiensis
manages to maintain its rapid reproductive rate by producing very large vacuoles or bubbles that occupy
a large portion of the cell. These vacuoles reduce the volume of the cell, increasing the surface-tovolume ratio. Other very large bacteria utilize a ruffled membrane for their outer surface layer. This
increases the surface area, which also increase the surface-to-volume ratio, allowing the cell to maintain
its rapid reproductive rate.

Cell Components
All cells (bacterial, archaeal, eukaryotic) share four common components:
Cytoplasm – cytoplasm is the gel-like fluid that fills each cell, providing an aqueous
environment for the chemical reactions that take place in a cell. It is composed of mostly water,
with some salts and proteins.
DNA – deoxyribonucleic acid or DNA is the genetic material of the cell, the instructions for the
cell’s abilities and characteristics. This complete set of genes, referred to as a genome, is
localized in an irregularly-shaped region known as the nucleoid in bacterial and archaeal cells,
and enclosed into a membrane-bound nucleus in eukaryotic cells.
Ribosomes – the protein-making factories of the cell are the ribosomes. Composed of both
RNA and protein, there are some distinct differences between the ones found in bacteria/archaea
and the ones found in eukaryotes, particularly in terms of size and location. The ribosomes of
bacteria and archaea are found floating in the cytoplasm, while many of the eukaryotic
ribosomes are organized along the endoplasmic reticulum, a eukaryotic organelle. Ribosomes
are measured using the Svedberg unit, which corresponds to the rate of sedimentation when
centrifuged. Bacterial/archaeal ribosomes have a measurement of 70S as a sedimentation value,
while eukaryotic ribosomes have a measurement of 80S, an indication of both their larger size
and mass.
Plasma Membrane – one of the outer boundaries of every cell is the plasma membrane or cell
membrane. (A plasma membrane can be found elsewhere as well, such as the membrane that
bounds the eukaryotic nucleus, while the term cell membrane refers specifically to this
boundary of the cell proper). The plasma membrane separates the cell’s inner contents from the
surrounding environment. While not a strong layer, the plasma membrane participates in several
crucial processes for the cell, particularly for bacteria and archaea, which typically only have the
one membrane:
◦ Acts as a semi-permeable barrier to allow for the entrance and exit of select molecules.

It functions to let in nutrients, excrete waste products, and possibly keep out dangerous
substances such as toxins or antibiotics.
◦ Performs metabolic processes by participating in the conversion of light or chemical
energy into a readily useable form known as ATP. This energy conservation involves
the development of a proton motive force (PMF), based on the separation of charges
across the membrane, much like a battery.
◦ “Communicates” with the environment by binding or taking in small molecules that act
as signals and provide information important to the cell. The information might relate to
nutrients or toxin in the area, as well as information about other organisms.

Typical Eukaryotic Cell. By Mediran (Own work) [CC BY-SA 3.0], via Wikimedia Commons
Eukaryotes have numerous additional components called organelles, such as the nucleus, the
mitochrondria, the endoplasmic reticulum, the Golgi apparatus, etc. These are all membrane-bound
compartments that house different activities for the cell. Because each structure is bounded by its very
own plasma membrane, it provides the cell with multiple locations for membranous functions to occur.

Plasma Membrane Structure
When talking about the details of the plasma membrane it gets a little bit complicated, since bacteria and
eukaryotes share the same basic structure, while archaea have marked differences. For now let us cover
the basic structure, while the archaeal modifications and variations will be covered in the chapter on
archaea.
The plasma membrane is often described by the fluid-mosaic model, which accounts for the movement
of various components within the membrane itself. The general structure is explained by the separation
of individual substances based on their attraction or repulsion of water. The membrane is typically
composed of two layers (a bilayer) of phospholipids, which form the basic structure. Each phospholipid
is composed of a polar region that is hydrophilic (“water loving”) and a non-polar region that is
hydrophobic (“water fearing”). The phospholipids will spontaneously assemble in such a way as to
keep the polar regions in contact with the aqueous environment outside of the cell and the cytoplasm
inside, while the non-polar regions are sequestered in the middle, much like the jelly in a sandwich.

The phospholipids themselves are composed of a negatively-charged polar head which is a phosphate
group, connected by a glycerol linkage to two fatty acid tails. The phosphate group is hydrophilic
while the fatty acid tails are hydrophobic. While the membrane is not considered to be particularly
strong, it is strengthened somewhat by the presence of additional lipid components, such as the steroids
in eukaryotes and the sterol-like hopanoids in bacteria. Embedded and associated with the
phospholipid bilayer are various proteins, with myriad functions. Proteins that are embedded within the
bilayer itself are called integral proteins while proteins that associate on the outside of the membrane
are called peripheral proteins. Some of the peripheral proteins are anchored to the membrane via a
lipid tail, and many associate with specific integral proteins to fulfill cellular functions. Integral proteins
are the dominant type, representing about 70-80% of the proteins associated with a plasma membrane,
while the peripheral proteins represent the remaining 20-30%.

Plasma Membrane Structure.
The amount of protein composing a plasma membrane, in comparison to phospholipid, differs by
organism. Bacteria have a very high protein to phospholipid ratio, around 2.5:1, while eukaryotes exhibit
a ratio of 1:1, at least in their cell membrane. But remember that eukaryotes have multiple plasma
membranes, one for every organelle. The protein to phospholipid ratio for their mitochondrial membrane
is 2.5:1, just like the bacterial plasma membrane, providing additional evidence for the idea that
eukaryotes evolved from a bacterial ancestor.

Bacteria: Cell Walls
It is important to note that not all bacteria have a cell wall. Having said that though, it is also important
to note that most bacteria (about 90%) have a cell wall and they typically have one of two types: a gram
positive cell wall or a gram negative cell wall.
The two different cell wall types can be identified in the lab by a differential stain known as the Gram
stain. Developed in 1884, it’s been in use ever since. Originally, it was not known why the Gram stain
allowed for such reliable separation of bacterial into two groups. Once the electron microscope was
invented in the 1940s, it was found that the staining difference correlated with differences in the cell
walls. Here is a website that shows the actual steps of the Gram stain. After this stain technique is
applied the gram positive bacteria will stain purple, while the gram negative bacteria will stain pink.

Overview of Bacterial Cell Walls
A cell wall, not just of bacteria but for all organisms, is found outside of the cell membrane. It’s an
additional layer that typically provides some strength that the cell membrane lacks, by having a semirigid structure.
Both gram positive and gram negative cell walls contain an ingredient known as peptidoglycan (also
known as murein). This particular substance hasn’t been found anywhere else on Earth, other than the
cell walls of bacteria. But both bacterial cell wall types contain additional ingredients as well, making
the bacterial cell wall a complex structure overall, particularly when compared with the cell walls of

eukaryotic microbes. The cell walls of eukaryotic microbes are typically composed of a single
ingredient, like the cellulose found in algal cell walls or the chitin in fungal cell walls.
The bacterial cell wall performs several functions as well, in addition to providing overall strength to the
cell. It also helps maintain the cell shape, which is important for how the cell will grow, reproduce,
obtain nutrients, and move. It protects the cell from osmotic lysis, as the cell moves from one
environment to another or transports in nutrients from its surroundings. Since water can freely move
across both the cell membrane and the cell wall, the cell is at risk for an osmotic imbalance, which could
put pressure on the relatively weak plasma membrane. Studies have actually shown that the internal
pressure of a cell is similar to the pressure found inside a fully inflated car tire. That is a lot of pressure
for the plasma membrane to withstand! The cell wall can keep out certain molecules, such as toxins,
particularly for gram negative bacteria. And lastly, the bacterial cell wall can contribute to the
pathogenicity or disease –causing ability of the cell for certain bacterial pathogens.

Structure of Peptidoglycan
Let us start with peptidoglycan, since it is an ingredient that both bacterial cell walls have in common.
Peptidoglycan is a polysaccharide made of two glucose derivatives, N-acetylglucosamine (NAG) and
N-acetylmuramic acid (NAM), alternated in long chains. The chains are cross-linked to one another by
a tetrapeptide that extends off the NAM sugar unit, allowing a lattice-like structure to form. The four
amino acids that compose the tetrapeptide are: L-alanine, D-glutamine, L-lysine or
meso-diaminopimelic acid (DPA), and D-alanine. Typically only the L-isomeric form of amino acids
are utilized by cells but the use of the mirror image D-amino acids provides protection from proteases
that might compromise the integrity of the cell wall by attacking the peptidoglycan. The tetrapeptides
can be directly cross-linked to one another, with the D-alanine on one tetrapeptide binding to the Llysine/ DPA on another tetrapeptide. In many gram positive bacteria there is a cross-bridge of five
amino acids such as glycine (peptide interbridge) that serves to connect one tetrapeptide to another. In
either case the cross-linking serves to increase the strength of the overall structure, with more strength
derived from complete cross-linking, where every tetrapeptide is bound in some way to a tetrapeptide
on another NAG-NAM chain.
While much is still unknown about peptidoglycan, research in the past ten years suggests that
peptidoglycan is synthesized as a cylinder with a coiled substructure, where each coil is cross-linked to
the coil next to it, creating an even stronger structure overall.

Peptidoglycan Structure.

Gram Positive Cell walls
The cell walls of gram positive bacteria are composed predominantly of peptidoglycan. In fact,
peptidoglycan can represent up to 90% of the cell wall, with layer after layer forming around the cell
membrane. The NAM tetrapeptides are typically cross-linked with a peptide interbridge and complete
cross-linking is common. All of this combines together to create an incredibly strong cell wall.
The additional component in a gram positive cell wall is teichoic acid, a glycopolymer, which is
embedded within the peptidoglycan layers. Teichoic acid is believed to play several important roles for
the cell, such as generation of the net negative charge of the cell, which is essential for development of a
proton motive force. Teichoic acid contributes to the overall rigidity of the cell wall, which is important
for the maintenance of the cell shape, particularly in rod-shaped organisms. There is also evidence that
teichoic acids participate in cell division, by interacting with the peptidoglycan biosynthesis machinery.
Lastly, teichoic acids appear to play a role in resistance to adverse conditions such as high temperatures
and high salt concentrations, as well as to β-lactam antibiotics. Teichoic acids can either be covalently
linked to peptidoglycan (wall teichoic acids or WTA) or connected to the cell membrane via a lipid
anchor, in which case it is referred to as lipoteichoic acid.

Since peptidoglycan is relatively porous, most substances can pass through the gram positive cell wall
with little difficulty. But some nutrients are too large, requiring the cell to rely on the use of
exoenzymes. These extracellular enzymes are made within the cell’s cytoplasm and then secreted past
the cell membrane, through the cell wall, where they function outside of the cell to break down large
macromolecules into smaller components.

Gram Negative Cell Walls
The cell walls of gram negative bacteria are more complex than that of gram positive bacteria, with
more ingredients overall. They do contain peptidoglycan as well, although only a couple of layers,
representing 5-10% of the total cell wall. What is most notable about the gram negative cell wall is the
presence of a plasma membrane located outside of the peptidoglycan layers, known as the outer
membrane. This makes up the bulk of the gram negative cell wall. The outer membrane is composed of
a lipid bilayer, very similar in composition to the cell membrane with polar heads, fatty acid tails, and
integral proteins. It differs from the cell membrane by the presence of large molecules known as
lipopolysaccharide (LPS), which are anchored into the outer membrane and project from the cell into
the environment. LPS is made up of three different components: 1) the O-antigen or O-polysaccharide,
which represents the outermost part of the structure , 2) the core polysaccharide, and 3) lipid A, which
anchors the LPS into the outer membrane. LPS is known to serve many different functions for the cell,
such as contributing to the net negative charge for the cell, helping to stabilize the outer membrane, and
providing protection from certain chemical substances by physically blocking access to other parts of the
cell wall. In addition, LPS plays a role in the host response to pathogenic gram negative bacteria. The Oantigen triggers an immune response in an infected host, causing the generation of antibodies specific to
that part of LPS (think of E. coli O157). Lipid A acts as a toxin, specifically an endotoxin, causing
general symptoms of illness such as fever and diarrhea. A large amount of lipid A released into the

bloodstream can trigger endotoxic shock, a body-wide inflammatory response which can be lifethreatening.

The outer membrane does present an obstacle for the cell. While there are certain molecules it would
like to keep out, such as antibiotics and toxic chemicals, there are nutrients that it would like to let in and
the additional lipid bilayer presents a formidable barrier. Large molecules are broken down by enzymes,
in order to allow them to get past the LPS. Instead of exoenzymes (like the gram positive bacteria), the
gram negative bacteria utilize periplasmic enzymes that are stored in the periplasm. Where is the
periplasm, you ask? It is the space located between the outer surface of the cell membrane and the inner
surface of the outer membrane, and it contains the gram negative peptidoglycan. Once the periplasmic
enzymes have broken nutrients down to smaller molecules that can get past the LPS, they still need to be
transported across the outer membrane, specifically the lipid bilayer. Gram negative cells utilize porins,
which are transmembrane proteins composed of a trimer of three subunits, which form a pore across the
membrane. Some porins are non-specific and transport any molecule that fits, while some porins are
specific and only transport substances that they recognize by use of a binding site. Once across the outer
membrane and in the periplasm, molecules work their way through the porous peptidoglycan layers
before being transported by integral proteins across the cell membrane.
The peptidoglycan layers are linked to the outer membrane by the use of a lipoprotein known as
Braun’s lipoprotein (good ol’ Dr. Braun). At one end the lipoprotein is covalently bound to the
peptidoglycan while the other end is embedded into the outer membrane via its polar head. This linkage
between the two layers provides additional structural integrity and strength.

Unusual and Wall-less Bacteria
Having emphasized the important of a cell wall and the ingredient peptidoglycan to both the gram
positive and the gram negative bacteria, it does seem important to point out a few exceptions as well.
Bacteria belonging to the phylum Chlamydiae appear to lack peptidoglycan, although their cell walls
have a gram negative structure in all other regards (i.e. outer membrane, LPS, porin, etc). It has been
suggested that they might be using a protein layer that functions in much the same way as
peptidoglycan. This has an advantage to the cell in providing resistance to β-lactam antibiotics (such as
penicillin), which attack peptidoglycan.
Bacteria belonging to the phylum Tenericutes lack a cell wall altogether, which makes them extremely
susceptible to osmotic changes. They often strengthen their cell membrane somewhat by the addition of
sterols, a substance usually associated with eukaryotic cell membranes. Many members of this phylum
are pathogens, choosing to hide out within the protective environment of a host.

Bacteria: Internal Components
We have already covered the main internal components found in all bacteria, namely, cytoplasm, the
nucleoid, and ribosomes. Remember that bacteria are generally thought to lack organelles, those bilipid
membrane-bound compartments so prevalent in eukaryotic cells (although some scientists argue that
bacteria possess structures that could be thought of as simple organelles). But bacteria can be more
complex, with a variety of additional internal components to be found that can contribute to their
capabilities. Most of these components are cytoplasmic but some of them are periplasmic, located in the
space between the cytoplasmic and outer membrane in gram negative bacteria.

Cytoskeleton
It was originally thought that bacteria lacked a cytoskeleton, a significant component of eukaryotic
cells. In the last 20 years, however, scientists have discovered bacterial filaments made of proteins that
are analogues to the cytoskeletal proteins found in eukaryotes. It has also been determined that the
bacterial cytoskeleton plays important roles in cell shape, cell division, and integrity of the cell wall.

FtsZ
FtsZ, homologous to the eukaryotic protein tubulin, forms a ring structure in the middle of the cell
during cell division, attracting other proteins to the area in order to construct a septum that will
eventually separate the two resulting daughter cells.

MreB
MreB, homologous to the eukaryotic protein actin, is found in bacillus and spiral-shaped bacteria and
plays an essential role in cell shape formation. MreB assumes a helical configuration running the length
of the cell and dictates the activities of the peptidoglycan-synthesis machinery, assuring a non-spherical
shape.

Crescentin
Crescentin, homologous to the eukaryotic proteins lamin and keratin, is found in spiral-shaped
bacteria with a single curve. The protein assembles lengthwise in the inner curvature of the cell, bending
the cell into its final shape.

Cytoskeleton Structures.

Inclusions
Bacterial inclusions are generally defined as a distinct structure located either within the cytoplasm or
periplasm of the cell. They can range in complexity, from a simple compilation of chemicals such as
crystals, to fairly complex structures that start to rival that of the eukaryotic organelles, complete with a
membranous external layer. Their role is often to store components as metabolic reserves for the cell
when a substance is found in excess, but they can also play a role in motility and metabolic functions as
well.

Carbon storage
Carbon is the most common substance to be stored by a cell, since all cells are carbon based. In addition,
carbon compounds can often be broken down quickly by the cell, so they can serve as energy sources as
well. One of the simplest and most common inclusions for carbon storage is glycogen, in which glucose
units are linked together in a multi-branching polysaccharide structure.
Another common way for bacteria to store carbon is in the form of poly-β-hydroxybutyrate (PHB), a
granule that forms when β-hydroxybutyric acid units aggregate together. This lipid is very plastic-like in
composition, leading some scientists to investigate the possibility of using them as a biodegradeable
plastic. The PHB granules actually have a shell composed of both protein and a small amount of
phospholipid. Both glycogen and PHB are formed when there is an excess of carbon and then broken
down by the cell later for both carbon and energy.

Inorganic storage
Often bacteria need something other than carbon, either for synthesis of cell components or as an

alternate energy reserve. Polyphosphate granules allow for the accumulation of inorganic phosphate
(PO43-), where the phosphate can be used to make nucleic acid (remember the sugar-phosphate
backbone?) or ATP (adenosine triphosphate, of course).
Other cells need sulfur as a source of electrons for their metabolism and will store excess sulfur in the
form of sulfur globules, which result when the cell oxidizes hydrogen sulfide (H2S) to elemental sulfur
(S0), resulting in the formation of refractile inclusions.

Non-storage functions
There are times when a bacterium needs to do something beyond simple storage of organic or inorganic
compounds for use in metabolism and there are inclusions to help with these non-storage functions. One
such example is gas vacuoles, which are used by the cell to control buoyancy in a water column,
providing the cell with some control over where it is in the environment. It is a limited form of motility,
on the vertical axis only. Gas vacuoles are composed of conglomerations of gas vesicles, cylindrical
structures that are both hollow and rigid. The gas vesicles are freely permeable to all types of gases by
passive diffusion and can be quickly constructed or collapsed, as needed by the cell to ascend or
descend.
Magnetosomes are inclusions that contain long chains of magnetite (Fe3O4), which are used by the cell
as a compass in geomagnetic fields, for orientation within their environment. Magnetotactic bacteria are
typically microaerophilic, preferring an environment with a lower level of oxygen than the atmosphere.
The magenetosome allows the cells to locate the optimum depth for their growth. Magenetosomes have
a true lipid bilayer, reminiscent of eukaryotic organelles, but it is actually an invagination of the cell’s
plasma membrane that has been modified with specific proteins.

Microcompartments
Bacterial microcompartments (BMCs) are unique from other inclusions by virtue of their structure
and functionality. They are icosahedral in shape and composed of a protein shell made up of various
proteins in the BMC family. While their exact role varies, they all participate in functions beyond simple
storage of substances. These compartments provide both a location and the substances (usually
enzymes) necessary for particular metabolic activities.
The best studied example of a BMC is the carboxysome, which are found in many CO2-fixing bacteria.
Carboxysomes contain the enzyme ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase (luckily it is also known as
RubisCO), which plays a crucial role in converting CO2 into sugar. The carboxysome also plays a role
in the concentration of CO2, thus ensuring that the components necessary for CO2-fixation are all in the
same place at the same time.

Anammoxosome
The anammoxosome is a large membrane-bound compartment found in bacterial cells capable of
carrying out the annamox reaction (anaerobic ammonium oxidation), where ammonium (NH4+) and
nitrite (NO2-) are converted to dinitrogen gas (N2). The process is performed as a way for the cell to get
energy, using ammonium as an electron donor and nitrite as an electron accept, with the resulting

production of nitrogen gas. This chemical conversion of nitrogen is important for the nitrogen cycle.

Commons

Chlorosome
Found in some phototrophic bacteria, a chlorosome is a highly efficient structure for capturing low light
intensities. Lining the inside perimeter of the cell membrane, each chlorosome can contain up to 250,000
bacteriochlorophyll molecules, arranged in dense arrays. Harvested light is transferred to reaction
centers in the cell membrane, allowing the conversion from light energy to chemical energy in the form
of ATP. The chlorosome is bounded by a lipid monolayer.

Plasmid
A plasmid is an extrachromosomal piece of DNA that some bacteria have, in addition to the genetic
material found in the nucleoid. It is composed of double-stranded DNA and is typically circular,
although linear plasmids have been found. Plasmids are described as being “non-essential” to the cell,
where the cell can function normally in their absence. But while plasmids have only a few genes, they
can confer important capabilities for the cell, such as antibiotic resistance. Plasmids replicate
independently of the cell and can be lost (known as curing), either spontaneously or due to exposure to

adverse conditions, such as UV light, thymine starvation, or growth above optimal conditions. Some
plasmids, known as episomes, can be integrated into the cell chromosome where the genes will be
replicated during cell division.

Endospore
Then there is the endospore, a marvel of bacterial engineering. This is located under the heading
“bacterial internal components,” but it is important to note that an endospore isn’t an internal or external
structure so much as a conversion of the cell into an alternate form. Cells start out as a vegetative cell,
doing all the things a cell is supposed to do (metabolizing, reproducing, mowing the lawn…). If they get
exposed to hostile conditions (dessication, high heat, an angry neighbor…) and they have the ability,
they might convert from a vegetative cell into an endospore. The endospore is actually formed within
the vegetative cell (doesn’t that make it an internal structure?) and then the vegetative cell lyses,
releasing the endospore (does that make it an external structure?).

Endospore Layers.
Endospores are only formed by a few gram positive genera and provide the cell with resistance to a wide
variety of harsh conditions, such as starvation, extremes in temperature, exposure to drying, UV light,
chemicals, enzymes, and radiation. While the vegetative cell is the active form for bacterial cells
(growing, metabolizing, etc), the endospore can be thought of as a dormant form of the cell. It allows for
survival of adverse conditions, but it does not allow the cell to grow or reproduce.

Structure
In order to be so incredibly resistant to so many different substances and environmental conditions,
many different layers are necessary. The bacterial endospore has many different layers, starting with a
core in the center. The core is the location of the nucleoid, ribosomes, and cytoplasm of the cell, in an
extremely dehydrated form. It typically contains only 25% of the water found in a vegetative cell,
increasing heat resistance. The DNA is further protected by the presence of small acid-soluble proteins

(SASPs), which stabilize the DNA and protect it from degradation. DNA stabilization is increased by
the presence of dipicolinic acid complexed with calcium (Ca-DPA), which inserts between the DNA
bases. The core is wrapped in an inner membrane that provides a permeability barrier to chemicals,
which is then surrounded by the cortex, a thick layer consisting of peptidoglycan with less cross-linking
than is found in the vegetative cell. The cortex is wrapped in an outer membrane. Lastly are several
spore coats made of protein, which provide protection from environmental stress such as chemicals and
enzymes.

Sporulation: conversion from vegetative cell to endospore
Sporulation, the conversion of vegetative cell into the highly protective endospore, typically occurs
when the cell’s survival is threatened in some way. The actual process is very complex and typically
takes several hours until completion. Initially the sporulating cells replicates its DNA, as if it were about
to undergo cell division. A septum forms asymmetrically, sequestering one copy of the chromosome at
one end of the cell (called the forespore). Synthesis of endospore-specific substances occurs, altering
the forespore and leading to the development of the layers specific for an endospore, as well as
dehydration. Eventually the “mother cell” is lyses, allowing for the release of the mature endospore into
the environment.

Sporulation.

Conversion from endospore to vegetative cell
The endospore remains dormant until environmental conditions improve, causing a chemical change that

initiates gene expression. There are three distinct stages in the conversion from an endospore to the
metabolically active vegetative cells: 1) activation, a preparation step that can be initiated by the
application of heat; 2) germination, when the endospore becomes metabolically active and begins to
take on water; 3) outgrowth, when the vegetative cell fully emerges from the endospore shell.

Bacteria: Surface Structures
Layers Outside the Cell Wall
What have we learned so far, in terms of cell layers? All cells have a cell membrane. Most bacteria have
a cell wall. But there are a couple of additional layers that bacteria may, or may not, have. These would

be found outside of both the cell membrane and the cell wall, if present.

Capsule
A bacterial capsule is a polysaccharide layer that completely envelopes the cell. It is well organized and
tightly packed, which explains its resistance to staining under the microscope. The capsule offers
protection from a variety of different threats to the cell, such as desiccation, hydrophobic toxic materials
(i.e. detergents), and bacterial viruses. The capsule can enhance the ability of bacterial pathogens to
cause disease and can provide protection from phagocytosis (engulfment by white blood cells known as
phagocytes). Lastly, it can help in attachment to surfaces.

Slime Layer
A bacterial slime layer is similar to the capsule in that it is typically composed of polysaccharides and it
completely surrounds the cell. It also offers protection from various threats, such as desiccation and
antibiotics. It can also allow for adherence to surfaces. So, how does it differ from the capsule? A slime
layer is a loose, unorganized layer that is easily stripped from the cell that made it, as opposed to a
capsule which integrates firmly around the bacterial cell wall.

S-Layer
Some bacteria have a highly organized layer made of secreted proteins or glycoproteins that selfassemble into a matrix on the outer part of the cell wall. This regularly structured S-layer is anchored
into the cell wall, although it is not considered to be officially part of the cell wall in bacteria. S-layers
have very important roles for the bacteria that have them, particularly in the areas of growth and
survival, and cell integrity.
S layers help maintain overall rigidity of the cell wall and surface layers, as well as cell shape, which are
important for reproduction. S layers protect the cell from ion/pH changes, osmotic stress, detrimental
enzymes, bacterial viruses, and predator bacteria. They can provide cell adhesion to other cells or
surfaces. For pathogenic bacteria they can provide protection from phagocytosis.

Structures Outside the Cell Wall
Bacteria can also have structures outside of the cell wall, often bound to the cell wall and/or cell

membrane. The building blocks for these structures are typically made within the cell and then secreted
past the cell membrane and cell wall, to be assembled on the outside of the cell.

Fimbriae (sing. fimbria)
Fimbriae are thin filamentous appendages that extend from the cell, often in the tens or hundreds. They
are composed of pilin proteins and are used by the cell to attach to surfaces. They can be particularly
important for pathogenic bacteria, which use them to attach to host tissues.

Pili (sing. pilin)
Pili are very similar to fimbriae (some textbooks use the terms interchangeably) in that they are thin
filamentous appendages that extend from the cell and are made of pilin proteins. Pili can be used for
attachment as well, to both surfaces and host cells, such as the Neisseria gonorrhea cells that use their
pili to grab onto sperm cells, for passage to the next human host. So, why would some researchers
bother differentiating between fimbriae and pili?
Pili are typically longer than fimbriae, with only 1-2 present on each cell, but that hardly seems enough
to set the two structures apart. It really boils down to the fact that a few specific pili participate in
functions beyond attachment. The conjugative pili participate in the process known as conjugation,
which allows for the transfer of a small piece of DNA from a donor cell to a recipient cell. The type IV
pili play a role in an unusual type of motility known as twitching motility, where a pilus attaches to a
solid surface and then contracts, pulling the bacterium forward in a jerky motion.

Flagella (sing. flagellum)
Bacterial motility is typically provided by structures known as flagella. The bacterial flagellum differs
in composition, structure, and function from the eukaryotic flagellum, which operates as a flexible whiplike tail utilizing microtubules. The bacterial flagellum is rigid in nature and operates more like the
propeller on a boat.
There are three main components to the bacterial flagellum:
1. the filament – a long thin appendage that extends from the cell surface. The filament is
composed of the protein flagellin and is hollow. Flagellin proteins are transcribed in the cell
cytoplasm and then transported across the cell membrane and cell wall. A bacterial flagellar
filament grows from its tip (unlike the hair on your head), adding more and more flagellin units
to extend the length until the correct size is reached. The flagellin units are guided into place by
a protein cap.
2. the hook – this is a curved coupler that attaches the filament to the flagellar motor.
3. the motor – a rotary motor that spans both the cell membrane and the cell wall, with additional
components for the gram negative outer membrane. The motor has two components: the basal
body, which provides the rotation, and the stator, which provides the torque necessary for
rotation to occur. The basal body consists of a central shaft surrounded by protein rings, two in
the gram positive bacteria and four in the gram negative bacteria. The stator consists of Mot
proteins that surround the ring(s) embedded within the cell membrane.

Bacterial Movement
Bacterial movement typically involves the use of flagella, although there are a few other possibilities as
well (such as the use of type IV pili for twitching motility). But certainly the most common type of
bacterial movement is swimming, which is accomplished with the use of a flagellum or flagella.

Swimming
Rotation of the flagellar basal body occurs due to the proton motive force, where protons that
accumulate on the outside of the cell membrane are driven through pores in the Mot proteins, interacting
with charges in the ring proteins as they pass across the membrane. The interaction causes the basal
body to rotate and turns the filament extending from the cell. Rotation can occur at 200-1000 rpm and

result in speeds of 60 cell lengths/second (for comparison, a cheetah moves at a maximum rate of 25
body lengths/second).
Rotation can occur in a clockwise (CW) or a counterclockwise (CCW) direction, with different results
to the cell. A bacterium will move forward, called a “run,” when there is a CCW rotation, and reorient
randomly, called a “tumble,” when there is a CW rotation.

Corkscrew Motility
Some spiral-shaped bacteria, known as the Spirochetes, utilize a corkscrew-motility due to their
unusual morphology and flagellar conformation. These gram negative bacteria have specialized flagella
that attach to one end of the cell, extend back through the periplasm and then attach to the other end of
the cell. When these endoflagella rotate they put torsion on the entire cell, resulting in a flexing motion
that is particularly effective for burrowing through viscous liquids.

Gliding Motility
Gliding motility is just like it sounds, a slower and more graceful movement than the other forms
covered so far. Gliding motility is exhibited by certain filamentous or bacillus bacteria and does not
require the use of flagella. It does require that the cells be in contact with a solid surface, although more
than one mechanism has been identified. Some cells rely on slime propulsion, where secreted slime
propels the cell forward, where other cells rely on surface layer proteins to pull the cell forward.

Chemotaxis
Now that we have covered the basics of the bacterial flagellar motor and mechanics of bacterial
swimming, let us combine the two topics to talk about chemotaxis or any other type of taxes (just not
my taxes). Chemotaxis refers to the movement of an organism towards or away from a chemical. You
can also have phototaxis, where an organism is responding to light. In chemotaxis, a favorable
substance (such as a nutrient) is referred to as an attractant, while a substance with an adverse effect on
the cell (such as a toxin) is referred to as a repellant. In the absence of either an attractant or a repellant
a cell will engage in a “random walk,” where it alternates between tumbles and runs, in the end getting
nowhere in particular. In the presence of a gradient of some type, the movements of the cell will become
biased, resulting over time in the movement of the bacterium towards an attractant and away from any
repellants. How does this happen?
First, let us cover how a bacterium knows which direction to go. Bacteria rely on protein receptors
embedded within their membrane, called chemoreceptors, which bind specific molecules. Binding
typically results in methylation or phosphorylation of the chemoreceptor, which triggers an elaborate
protein pathway that eventually impacts the rotation of the flagellar motor. The bacteria engage in
temporal sensing, where they compare the concentration of a substance with the concentration obtained
just a few seconds (or microseconds) earlier. In this way they gather information about the orientation of
the concentration gradient of the substance. As a bacterium moves closer to the higher concentrations of
an attractant, runs (dictated by CCW flagellar rotation) become longer, while tumbling (dictated by CW
flagellar rotation) decreases. There will still be times that the bacterium will head off in the wrong
direction away from an attractant since tumbling results in a random reorientation of the cell, but it

won’t head in the wrong direction for very long. The resulting “biased random walk” allows the cell to
quickly move up the gradient of an attractant (or move down the gradient of a repellant).

Archaea
The Archaea are a group of organisms that were originally thought to be bacteria (which explains the
initial name of “archaeabacteria”), due to their physical similarities. More reliable genetic analysis
revealed that the Archaea are distinct from both Bacteria and Eukaryotes, earning them their own
domain in the Three Domain Classification originally proposed by Woese in 1977, alongside the
Eukarya and the Bacteria.

Phylogenetic Tree of Life.

Similarities to Bacteria
So, why were the archaea originally thought to be bacteria? Perhaps most importantly, they lack a
nucleus or other membrane-bound organelles, putting them into the prokaryotic category (if you are
using the traditional classification scheme). Most of them are unicellular, they have 70S sized
ribosomes, they are typically a few micrometers in size, and they reproduce asexually only. They are
known to have many of the same structures that bacteria can have, such as plasmids, inclusions, flagella,
and pili. Capsules and slime layers have been found but appear to be rare in archaea.
While archaea were originally isolated from extreme environments, such as places high in acid, salt, or
heat, earning them the name “extremophiles,” they have more recently been isolated from all the places
rich with bacteria: surface water, the ocean, human skin, soil, etc.

Key Differences
Plasma Membrane
There are several characteristics of the plasma membrane that are unique to Archaea, setting them apart
from other domains. One such characteristic is chirality of the glycerol linkage between the phopholipid
head and the side chain. In archaea it is in the L-isomeric form, while bacteria and eukaryotes have the
D-isomeric form. A second difference is the presence of an ether-linkage between the glycerol and the
side chain, as opposed to the ester-linked lipids found in bacteria and eukaryotes. The ether-linkage
provides more chemical stability to the membrane. A third and fourth difference are associated with the

side chains themselves, unbranched fatty acids in bacteria and eukaryotes, while isoprenoid chains are
found in archaea. These isoprenoid chains can have branching side chains.

9e7c7540-5794-4c31-917d-fce7e50ea6dd@11.
Lastly, the plasma membrane of Archaea can be found as monolayers, where the isoprene chains of one
phospholipid connect with the isoprene chains of a phospholipid on the opposite side of the membrane.
Bacteria and eukaryotes only have lipid bilayers, where the two sides of the membrane remain
separated.

Cell Wall
Like bacteria, the archaeal cell wall is a semi-rigid structure designed to provide protection to the cell
from the environment and from the internal cellular pressure. While the cell walls of bacteria typically

contain peptidoglycan, that particular chemical is lacking in archaea. Instead, archaea display a wide
variety of cell wall types, adapted for the environment of the organism. Some archaea lack a cell wall
altogether.
While it is not universal, a large number of Archaea have a proteinaceous S-layer that is considered to
be part of the cell wall itself (unlike in Bacteria, where an S-layer is a structure in addition to the cell
wall). For some Archaea the S-layer is the only cell wall component, while in others it is joined by
additional ingredients (see below). The archaeal S-layer can be made of either protein or glycoprotein,
often anchored into the plasma membrane of the cell. The proteins form a two-dimensional crystalline
array with a smooth outer surface. A few S-layers are composed of two different S-layer proteins.
While archaea lack peptidoglycan, a few contain a substance with a similar chemical structure, known as
pseudomurein. Instead of NAM, it contains N-acetylalosaminuronic acid (NAT) linked to NAG, with
peptide interbridges to increase strength.
Methanochondroitin is a cell wall polymer found in some archaeal cells, similar in composition to the
connective tissue component chondroitin, found in vertebrates.
Some archaea have a protein sheath composed of a lattice structure similar to an S-layer. These cells
are often found in filamentous chains, however, and the protein sheath encloses the entire chain, as
opposed to individual cells.

Cell Wall Structural Diversity.

Ribosomes
While archaea have ribosomes that are 70S in size, the same as bacteria, it was the rRNA nucleotide
differences that provided scientists with the conclusive evidence to argue that archaea deserved a
domain separate from the bacteria. In addition, archaeal ribosomes have a different shape than bacterial
ribosomes, with proteins that are unique to archaea. This provides them with resistance to antibiotics
that inhibit ribosomal function in bacteria.

Structures
Many of the structures found in bacteria have been discovered in archaea as well, although sometimes it
is obvious that each structure was evolved independently, based on differences in substance and
construction.

Cannulae
Cannulae, a structure unique to archaea, have been discovered in some marine archaeal strains. These
hollow tube-like structures appear to connect cells after division, eventually leading to a dense network
composed of numerous cells and tubes. This could serve as a means of anchoring a community of cells
to a surface.

Hamus (pl. hami)
Another structure unique to archaea is the hamus, a long helical tube with three hooks at the far end.
Hami appear to allow cells to attach both to one another and to surfaces, encouraging the formation of a
community.

Pilus (pl. pili)
Pili have been observed in archaea, composed of proteins most likely modified from the bacterial pilin.
The resulting tube-like structures have been shown to be used for attachment to surfaces.

Flagellum (pl. flagella)
The archaeal flagellum, while used for motility, differs so markedly from the bacterial flagellum that it
has been proposed to call it an “archaellum,” to differentiate it from its bacterial counterpart.
What is similar between the bacterial flagellum and the archaeal flagellum? Both are used for
movement, where the cell is propelled by rotation of a rigid filament extending from the cell. After that
the similarities end.
What are the differences? The rotation of an archaeal flagellum is powered by ATP, as opposed to the
proton motive force used in bacteria. The proteins making up the archaeal flagellum are similar to the
proteins found in bacterial pili, rather than the bacterial flagellum. The archaeal flagellum filament is
not hollow so growth occurs when flagellin proteins are inserted into the base of the filament, rather than
being added to the end. The filament is made up of several different types of flagellin, while just one
type is used for the bacterial flagellum filament. Clockwise rotation pushes an archaeal cells forward,
while counterclockwise rotation pulls an archaeal cell backwards. An alternation of runs and tumbles is
not observed.

Classification
Currently there are two recognized phyla of archaea: Euryarchaeota and Proteoarchaeota. Several
additional phyla have been proposed (Nanoarchaeota, Korarchaeota, Aigarchaeota, Lokiarchaeota), but
have yet to be officially recognized, largely due to the fact that the evidence comes from environmental
sequences only.

Introduction to Viruses
Viruses are typically described as obligate intracellular parasites, acellular infectious agents that
require the presence of a host cell in order to multiply. Viruses that have been found to infect all types of
cells – humans, animals, plants, bacteria, yeast, archaea, protozoa…some scientists even claim they have
found a virus that infects other viruses! But that is not going to happen without some cellular help.

Virus Characteristics
Viruses can be extremely simple in design, consisting of nucleic acid surrounded by a protein coat
known as a capsid. The capsid is composed of smaller protein components referred to as capsomers.
The capsid+genome combination is called a nucleocapsid.
Viruses can also possess additional components, with the most common being an additional
membranous layer that surrounds the nucleocapsid, called an envelope. The envelope is actually
acquired from the nuclear or plasma membrane of the infected host cell, and then modified with viral
proteins called peplomers. Some viruses contain viral enzymes that are necessary for infection of a host
cell and coded for within the viral genome. A complete virus, with all the components needed for host
cell infection, is referred to as a virion.

Virus Characteristics, Image created by Ben Taylor, Public Domain, Via Wikipedia commons

Virus Genome
While cells contain double-stranded DNA for their genome, viruses are not limited to this form. While
there are dsDNA viruses, there are also viruses with single-stranded DNA (ssDNA), double-stranded
RNA (dsRNA), and single-stranded RNA (ssRNA). In this last category, the ssRNA can either positivesense (+ssRNA, meaning it can transcribe a message, like mRNA) or it can be negative-sense (-ssRNA,
indicating that it is complementary to mRNA). Some viruses even start with one form of nucleic acid in
the nucleocapsid and then convert it to a different form during replication.

Virus Structure
Viral nucleocapsids come in two basic shapes, although the overall appearance of a virus can be altered
by the presence of an envelope, if present. Helical viruses have an elongated tube-like structure, with
the capsomers arranged helically around the coiled genome. Icosahedral viruses have a spherical shape,
with icosahedral symmetry consisting of 20 triangular faces. The simplest icosahedral capsid has 3
capsomers per triangular face, resulting in 60 capsomers for the entire virus. Some viruses do not neatly
fit into either of the two previous categories because they are so unusual in design or components, so
there is a third category known as complex viruses. Examples include the poxvirus with a brick-shaped
exterior and a complicated internal structure, as well as bacteriophage with tail fibers attached to an
icosahedral head.

Virus Replication Cycle
While the replication cycle of viruses can vary from virus to virus, there is a general pattern that can be
described, consisting of five steps:
1.
2.
3.
4.
5.

Attachment – the virion attaches to the correct host cell.
Penetration or Viral Entry – the virus or viral nucleic acid gains entrance into the cell.
Synthesis – the viral proteins and nucleic acid copies are manufactured by the cells’ machinery.
Assembly – viruses are produced from the viral components.
Release – newly formed virions are released from the cell.

Attachment
Outside of their host cell, viruses are inert or metabolically inactive. Therefore, the encounter of a virion
to an appropriate host cell is a random event. The attachment itself is highly specific, between molecules
on the outside of the virus and receptors on the host cell surface. This accounts for the specificity of
viruses to only infect particular cell types or particular hosts.

Penetration or Viral Entry
Many unenveloped (or naked) viruses inject their nucleic acid into the host cell, leaving an empty
capsid on the outside. This process is termed penetration and is common with bacteriophage, the viruses
that infect bacteria. With the eukaryotic viruses, it is more likely for the entire capsid to gain entrance
into the cell, with the capsid being removed in the cytoplasm. An unenveloped eukaryotic virus often
gains entry via endocytosis, where the host cell is compelled to engulf the capsid resulting in an
endocytic vesicle. An enveloped eukaryotic virus gains entrance for its nucleocapsid when the viral
envelope fuses with the host cell membrane, pushing the nucleocapsid past the cell membrane. If the
entire nucleocapsid is brought into the cell then there is an uncoating process to strip away the capsid
and release the viral genome.

Synthesis
The synthesis stage is largely dictated by the type of viral genome, since genomes that differ from the
cell’s dsDNA genome can involve intricate viral strategies for genome replication and protein synthesis.
Viral specific enzymes, such as RNA-dependent RNA polymerases, might be necessary for the
replication process to proceed. Protein production is tightly controlled, to insure that components are
made at the right time in viral development.

Assembly
The complexity of viral assembly depends upon the virus being made. The simplest virus has a capsid
composed of 3 different types of proteins, which self-assembles with little difficulty. The most complex
virus is composed of over 60 different proteins, which must all come together in a specific order. These
viruses often employ multiple assembly lines to create the different viral structures and then utilize
scaffolding proteins to put all the viral components together in an organized fashion.

Release
The majority of viruses lyse their host cell at the end of replication, allowing all the newly formed
virions to be released to the environment. Another possibility, common for enveloped viruses, is
budding, where one virus is released from the cell at a time. The cell membrane is modified by the
insertion of viral proteins, with the nucleocapsid pushing out through this modified portion of the
membrane, allowing it to acquire an envelope.

Active Virus Life Cycle by John Kellogg Via OER at Oregon State University

Bacteriophage
Viruses that infect bacteria are known as bacteriophage or phage. A virulent phage is one that always
lyses the host cell at the end of replication, after following the five steps of replication described above.
This is called the lytic cycle of replication.

There are also temperate phage, viruses that have two options regarding their replication. Option 1 is to
mimic a virulent phage, following the five steps of replication and lysing the host cell at the end,
referred to as the lytic cycle. But temperate phage differ from virulent phage in that they have another
choice: Option 2, where they remain within the host cell without destroying it. This process is known as
lysogeny or the lysogenic cycle of replication.
A phage employing lysogeny still undergoes the first two steps of a typical replication cycle, attachment
and penetration. Once the viral DNA has been inserted into the cell it integrates with the host DNA,
forming a prophage. The infected bacterium is referred to as a lysogen or lysogenic bacterium. In this
state, the virus enjoys a stable relationship with its host, where it does not interfere with host cell
metabolism or reproduction. The host cell enjoys immunity from reinfection from the same virus.
Exposure of the host cell to stressful conditions (i.e. UV irradiation) causes induction, where the viral
DNA excises from the host cell DNA. This event triggers the remaining steps of the lytic cycle,
synthesis, maturation, and release, leading to lysis of the host cell and release of newly formed virions.

CNX. Apr 11, 2013 http://cnx.org/contents/7cbd15ad-5bff-4678-a99f-85fd579e070c@3.
So, what dictates the replication type that will be used by a temperate phage? If there are plenty of host
cells around, it is likely that a temperate phage will engage in the lytic cycle of replication, leading to a

large increase in viral production. If host cells are scarce, a temperate phage is more likely to enter
lysogeny, allowing for viral survival until host cell numbers increase. The same is true if the number of
phage in an environment greatly outnumber the host cells, since lysogeny would allow for host cells
numbers to rebound, ensuring long term viral survival.
Lysogens can experience a benefit from lysogeny as well, since it can result in lysogenic conversion, a
situation where the development of a prophage leads to a change in the host’s phenotype. One of the
best examples of this is for the bacterium Corynebacterium diphtheriae, the causative agent of
diphtheria. The diphtheria toxin that causes the disease is encoded within the phage genome, so only C.
diphtheriae lysogens cause diphtheria.

Eukaryotic Viruses
Eukaryotic viruses can cause one of four different outcomes for their host cell. The most common
outcome is host cell lysis, resulting from an acute infection (essentially the lytic cycle of replication
seen in phage). Some viruses can cause a latent infection, co-existing peacefully with their host cells for
years (much like a temperate phage during lysogeny), and then periodically undergoing reactivation to
revert to an acute infection. Some enveloped eukaryotic viruses can also be released one at a time from
an infected host cell, in a type of budding process, causing a persistent infection. Lastly, certain
eukaryotic viruses can cause the host cell to transform into a malignant or cancerous cell, a mechanism
known as transformation.

Viruses and Cancer
There are many different causes of cancer, or unregulated cell growth and reproduction. Some known

causes include exposure to certain chemicals or UV light. There are also certain viruses that have a
known associated with the development of cancer. Such viruses are referred to as oncoviruses.
Oncoviruses can cause cancer by producing proteins that bind to host proteins known as tumor
suppressor proteins, which function to regulate cell growth and to initiate programmed cell death, if
needed. If the tumor suppressor proteins are inactivated by viral proteins then cells grow out of control,
leading to the development of tumors and metastasis, where the cells spread throughout the body.

Microbial Growth
Provided with the right conditions (food, correct temperature, etc) microbes can grow very quickly.
Depending on the situation, this could be a good thing for humans (yeast growing in wort to make beer)
or a bad thing (bacteria growing in your throat causing strep throat). It’s important to have knowledge of
their growth, so we can predict or control their growth under particular conditions.

While growth for muticelluar organisms is typically measured in terms of the increase in size of a single
organism, microbial growth is measured by the increase in population, either by measuring the increase
in cell number or the increase in overall mass.

Bacterial Division
Bacteria and archaea reproduce asexually only, while eukartyotic microbes can engage in either sexual
or asexual reproduction. Bacteria and archaea most commonly engage in a process known as binary
fission, where a single cell splits into two equally sized cells. Other, less common processes can include
multiple fission, budding, and the production of spores.
The process begins with cell elongation, which requires careful enlargement of the cell membrane and
the cell wall, in addition to an increase in cell volume. The cell starts to replicate its DNA, in preparation
for having two copies of its chromosome, one for each newly formed cell. The protein FtsZ is essential
for the formation of a septum, which initially manifests as a ring in the middle of the elongated cell.
After the nucleoids are segregated to each end of the elongated cell, septum formation is completed,
dividing the elongated cell into two equally sized daughter cells. The entire process or cell cycle can
take as little as 20 minutes for an active culture of E. coli bacteria.

Growth Curve
Since bacteria are easy to grow in the lab, their growth has been studied extensively. It has been
determined that in a closed system or batch culture (no food added, no wastes removed) bacteria will
grow in a predictable pattern, resulting in a growth curve composed of four distinct phases of growth:
the lag phase, the exponential or log phase, the stationary phase, and the death or decline phase.
Additionally, this growth curve can yield generation time for a particular organism – the amount of time
it takes for the population to double.

The details associated with each growth curve (number of cells, length of each phase, rapidness of
growth or death, overall amount of time) will vary from organism to organism or even with different
conditions for the same organism. But the pattern of four distinct phases of growth will typically
remain.

Lag phase
The lag phase is an adaptation period, where the bacteria are adjusting to their new conditions. The
length of the lag phase can vary considerably, based on how different the conditions are from the
conditions that the bacteria came from, as well as the condition of the bacterial cells themselves.
Actively growing cells transferred from one type of media into the same type of media, with the same
environmental conditions, will have the shortest lag period. Damaged cells will have a long lag period,
since they must repair themselves before they can engage in reproduction.
Typically cells in the lag period are synthesizing RNA, enzymes, and essential metabolites that might be
missing from their new environment (such as growth factors or macromolecules), as well as adjusting to
environmental changes such as changes in temperature, pH, or oxygen availability. They can also be

undertaking any necessary repair of injured cells.

Exponential or Log phase
Once cells have accumulated all that they need for growth, they proceed into cell division. The
exponential or log phase of growth is marked by predictable doublings of the population, where 1 cell
become 2 cells, becomes 4, becomes 8 etc. Conditions that are optimal for the cells will result in very
rapid growth (and a steeper slope on the growth curve), while less than ideal conditions will result in
slower growth. Cells in the exponential phase of growth are the healthiest and most uniform, which
explains why most experiments utilize cells from this phase.

Bacterial Growth Rates.
Due to the predictability of growth in this phase, this phase can be used to mathematically calculate the
time it takes for the bacterial population to double in number, known as the generation time (g). This
information is used by microbiologists in basic research, as well as in industry. In order to determine
generation time, the natural logarithm of cell number can be plotted against time (where the units can
vary, depending upon speed of growth for the particular population), using a semilogarithmic graph to
generate a line with a predictable slope.
The slope of the line is equal to 0.301/g. Alternatively one can rely on the fixed relationship between the
initial number of cells at the start of the exponential phase and the number of cells after some period of
time, which can be expressed by:

where N is the final cell concentration, N0 is the initial cell concentration, and n is the number of
generations that occurred between the specified period of time. Generation time (g) can be represented
by t/n, witht being the specified period of time in minutes, hours, days, or months. Thus, if one knows
the cell concentration at the start of the exponential phase of growth and the cell concentration after
some period of time of exponential growth, the number of generations can be calculated. Then, using the
amount of time that growth was allowed to proceed (t), one can calculate g.

Stationary Phase
All good things must come to an end (otherwise bacteria would equal the mass of the Earth in 7 days!).
At some point the bacterial population runs out of an essential nutrient/chemical or its growth is
inhibited by its own waste products (it is a closed container, remember?) or lack of physical space,
causing the cells to enter into the stationary phase. At this point the number of new cells being
produced is equal to the number of cells dying off or growth has entirely ceased, resulting in a flattening
out of growth on the growth curve.
Physiologically the cells become quite different at this stage, as they try to adapt to their new starvation
conditions. The few new cells that are produced are smaller in size, with bacilli becoming almost
spherical in shape. Their plasma membrane becomes less fluid and permeable, with more hydrophobic
molecules on the surface that promote cell adhesion and aggregation. The nucleoid condenses and the
DNA becomes bound with DNA-binding proteins from starved cells (DPS), to protect the DNA from
damage. The changes are designed to allow the cell to survive for a longer period of time in adverse
conditions, while waiting for more optimal conditions (such as an infusion of nutrients) to occur. These
same strategies are used by cells in oligotrophic or low-nutrient environments. It has been hypothesized
that cells in the natural world (i.e. outside of the laboratory) typically exist for long periods of time in
oligotrophic environments, with only sporadic infusions of nutrients that return them to exponential
growth for very brief periods of time.
During the stationary phase cells are also prone to producing secondary metabolites, or metabolites
produced after active growth, such as antibiotics. Cells that are capable of making an endospore will
activate the necessary genes during this stage, in order to initiate the sporulation process.

Death or Decline phase
In the last phase of the growth curve, the death or decline phase, the number of viable cells decreases
in a predictable (or exponential) fashion. The steepness of the slope corresponds to how fast cells are
losing viability. It is thought that the culture conditions have deteriorated to a point where the cells are
irreparably harmed, since cells collected from this phase fail to show growth when transferred to fresh
medium. It is important to note that if the turbidity of a culture is being measured as a way to determine
cell density, measurements might not decrease during this phase, since cells could still be intact.
It has been suggested that the cells thought to be dead might be revived under specific conditions, a
condition described as viable but nonculturable (VBNC). This state might be of importance for
pathogens, where they enter a state of very low metabolism and lack of cellular division, only to resume
growth at a later time, when conditions improve.
It has also been shown that 100% cell death is unlikely, for any cell population, as the cells mutate to

adapt to their environmental conditions, however harsh. Often there is a tailing effect observed, where a
small population of the cells cannot be killed off. In addition, these cells might benefit from the death of
their fellow cells, which provide nutrients to the environment as they lyse and release their cellular
contents.

Environmental Factors
What do real estate agents always say? Location, location, location! It’s all about where you live, or at
least adapting to where you live. At least it is for microbes.
Competition is fierce out in the microbial world (non-microbial world, too!) and resources can be scarce.
For those microbes that are willing and able to adapt to what might be considered a harsh environment,
it can certainly mean less competition.
So what environmental conditions can affect microbial growth? Temperature, oxygen, pH, water
activity, pressure, radiation, lack of nutrients…these are the primary ones. We will cover more about
metabolism (i.e. what type of food can they eat?) later, so let us focus now on the physical

characteristics of the environment and the adaptations of microbes.

Osmolarity
Cells are subject to changes in osmotic pressure, due to the fact that the plasma membrane is freely
permeable to water (a process known as passive diffusion). Water will generally move in the direction
necessary to try and equilibrate the cell’s solute concentration to the solute concentration of the
surrounding environment. If the solute concentration of the environment is lower than the solute
concentration found inside the cell, the environment is said to be hypotonic. In this situation water will
pass into the cell, causing the cell to swell and increasing internal pressure. If the situation is not
rectified then the cell will eventually burst from lysis of the plasma membrane. Conversely, if the solute
concentration of the environment is higher than the solute concentration found inside the cell, the
environment is said to be hypertonic. In this situation water will leave the cell, causing the cell to
dehydrate. Extended periods of dehydration will cause permanent damage to the plasma membrane.

Hypertonic vs. Hypotonic Solutions.
Cells in a hypotonic solution need to reduce the osmotic concentration of their cytoplasm. Sometimes
cells can use inclusions to chemically change their solutes, reducing molarity. In a real pinch they can
utilize what are known as mechanosensitive (MS) channels, located in their plasma membrane. MS
channels open as the plasma membrane stretches due to the increased pressure, allowing solutes to leave
the cell and thus lowering the osmotic pressure.
Cells in a hypertonic solution needing to increase the osmotic concentration of their cytoplasm can take
up additional solutes from the environment. However, cells have to be careful about what solutes they
take up, since some solutes can interfere with cellular function and metabolism. Cells need to take up
compatible solutes, such as sugars or amino acids, which typically will not interfere with cellular
processes.
There are some microbes that have evolved to extreme hypertonic environments, specifically high salt
concentrations, to the point where they now require the presence of high levels of sodium chloride to
grow. Halophiles, which require a NaCl concentration above 0.2 M, take in both potassium and chloride
ions as a way to offset the effects of the hypertonic environment that they live in. Their evolution has
been so complete that their cellular components (ribosomes, enzymes, transport proteins, cell wall,
plasma membrane) now require the presence of high concentrations of both potassium and chloride to
function.

pH
pH is defined as the negative logarithm of the hydrogen ion concentration of a solution, expressed in
molarity. The pH scale ranges from 0 to 14, with 0 representing an extremely acidic solution (1.0 M H+)
and 14 representing an extremely alkaline solution (1.0 x 10-14 M H+). Each pH units represents a
tenfold change in hydrogen ion concentration, meaning a solution with a pH of 3 is 10x more acidic than
a solution with a pH of 4.
Typically cells would prefer a pH that is similar to their internal environment, with cytoplasm having a
pH of 7.2. That means that most microbes are neutrophiles (“neutral lovers”), preferring a pH in the
range of 5.5 to 8.0. There are some microbes, however, that have evolved to live in the extreme pH
environments.
Acidophiles (“acid lovers”), preferring an environmental pH range of 0 to 5.5, must use a variety of
mechanisms to maintain their internal pH in an acceptable range and preserve the stability of their
plasma membrane. These organisms transport cations (such as potassium ions) into the cell, thus
decreasing H+ movement into the cell. They also utilize proton pumps that actively pump H+ out.
Alkaliphiles (“alkaline lovers”), preferring an environmental pH range of 8.0 to 11.5, must pump
protons in, in order to maintain the pH of their cytoplasm. They typically employ antiporters, which
pump protons in and sodium ions out.

Temperature
Microbes have no way to regulate their internal temperature so they must evolve adaptations for the
environment they would like to live in. Changes in temperature have the biggest effect on enzymes and
their activity, with an optimal temperature that leads to the fastest metabolism and resulting growth rate.
Temperatures below optimal will lead to a decrease in enzyme activity and slower metabolism, while
higher temperatures can actually denature proteins such as enzymes and carrier proteins, leading to cell
death. As a result, microbes have a growth curve in relation to temperature with an optimal
temperature at which growth rate peaks, as well as minimum and maximum temperatures where
growth continues but is not as robust. For a bacterium the growth range is typically around 30 degrees.
The psychrophiles are the cold lovers, with an optimum of 15oC or lower and a growth range of -20oC
to 20oC. Most of these microbes are found in the oceans, where the temperature is often 5oC or colder.
They can also be found in the Arctic and the Antarctic, living in ice wherever they can find pockets of
liquid water. Adaptation to the cold required evolution of specific proteins, particularly enzymes, that
can still function in low temperatures. In addition, it also required modification to the plasma membrane
to keep it semifluid. Psychrophiles have an increased amount of unsaturated and shorter-chain fatty
acids. Lastly, psychrophiles produce cryoprotectants, special proteins or sugars that prevent the
development of ice crystals that might damage the cell. Psychrotophs or cold tolerant microbes have a
range of 0-35oC, with an optimum of 16oC or higher.
Humans are best acquainted with the mesophiles, microbes with a growth optima of 37oC and a range
of 20-45oC. Almost all of the human microflora fall into this category, as well as almost all human
pathogens. The mesophiles occupy the same environments that humans do, in terms of foods that we eat,
surfaces that we touch, and water that we drink and swim in.
On the warmer end of the spectrum is where we find the thermophiles (“heat lovers”), the microbes that
like high temperatures. Thermophiles typically have a range of 45-80oC, and a growth optimum of
60oC. There are also the hyperthermophiles, those microbes that like things extra spicy. These
microbes have a growth optima of 88-106oC, a minimum of 65oC and a maximum of 120oC. Both the
thermophiles and the hyperthermophiles require specialized heat-stable enzymes that are resistant to
denaturation and unfolding, partly due to the presence of protective proteins known as chaperone
proteins. The plasma membrane of these organisms contains more saturated fatty acids, with increased
melting points.

Growth Curves.

Oxygen Concentration
The oxygen requirement of an organism relates to the type of metabolism that it is using. Energy
generation is tied to the movement of electrons through the electron transport chain (ETC), where the
final electron acceptor can be oxygen or a non-oxygen molecule.
Organisms that use oxygen as the final electron acceptor are engaging in aerobic respiration for their
metabolism. If they require the presence of atmospheric oxygen (20%) for their metabolism then they
are referred to as obligate aerobes. Microaerophiles require oxygen, but at a lower level than normal
atmospheric levels – they only grow at levels of 2-10%.
Organisms that can grow in the absence of oxygen are referred to as anaerobes, with several different
categories existing. The facultative anaerobes are the most versatile, being able to grow in the presence
or absence of oxygen by switching their metabolism to match their environment. They would prefer to
grow in the presence of oxygen, however, since aerobic respiration generates the largest amount of
energy and allows for faster growth. Aerotolerant anaerobes can also grow in the presence or absence
of oxygen, exhibiting no preference. Obligate anaerobes can only grow in the absence of oxygen and
find an oxygenated environment to be toxic.
While the use of oxygen is dictated by the organism’s metabolism, the ability to live in an oxygenated
environment (regardless of whether it is used by the organism or not) is dictated by the presence/absence
of several enzymes. Oxygen by-products (called reactive oxygen species or ROS) can be toxic to cells,
even to the cells using aerobic respiration. Enzymes that can offer some protection from ROS include
superoxide dismutase (SOD), which breaks down superoxide radicals, and catalase, which breaks
down hydrogen peroxide. Obligate anaerobes lack both enzymes, leaving them little or no protection
against ROS.

Oxygen and Bacterial Growth.

Pressure
The vast majority of microbes, living on land or water surface, are exposed to a pressure of
approximately 1 atmosphere. But there are microbes that live on the bottom of the ocean, where the
hydrostatic pressure can reach 600-1,000 atm. These microbes are the barophiles (“pressure lovers”),
microbes that have adapted to prefer and even require the high pressures. These microbes have increased
unsaturated fatty acids in their plasma membrane, as well as shortened fatty acid tails.

Radiation
All cells are susceptible to the damage cause by radiation, which adversely affects DNA with its short
wavelength and high energy. Ionizing radiation, such as x-rays and gamma rays, causes mutations and
destruction of the cell’s DNA. While bacterial endospores are extremely resistant to the harmful effects
of ionizing radiation, vegetative cells were thought to be quite susceptible to its impact. That is, until the
discovery of Deinococcus radiodurans, a bacterium capable of completely reassembling its DNA after
exposure to massive doses of radiation.
Ultraviolet (UV) radiation also causes damage to DNA, by attaching thymine bases that are next to one
another on the DNA strand. These thymine dimers inhibit DNA replication and transcription. Microbes
typically have DNA repair mechanisms that allow them to repair limited damage, such as the enzyme

photolyase that splits apart thymine dimers.

Microbial Nutrition
Nutritional Types of Microorganisms
All microbes have a need for three things: carbon, energy, and electrons. There are specific terms
associated with the source of each of these items, to help define organisms.

Let us focus on carbon first. All organisms are carbon-based with macromolecules – proteins,
carbohydrates, lipids, nucleic acid – having a fundamental core of carbon. On one hand, organisms can
use reduced, preformed organic substances as a carbon source. These are the heterotrophs or “other
eaters.” Alternatively, they can rely on carbon dioxide (CO2) as a carbon source, reducing or “fixing” it
this inorganic form of carbon into an organic molecule. These are the autotrophs or “self feeders.”
For energy, there are two possibilities as well: light energy or chemical energy. Light energy comes
from the sun, while chemical energy can come from either organic or inorganic chemicals. Those
organisms that use light energy are called phototrophs (“light eaters”), while those that use chemical
energy are called chemotrophs (“chemical eaters”). Chemical energy can come from inorganic sources
or organic sources. An organism that uses inorganic sources is known as a lithotroph (“rock eater”),
while an organism that uses organic sources is called an organotroph (“organic eater”).
These terms can all be combined, to derive a single term that gives you an idea of what an organism is
using to meet its basic needs for energy, electrons, and carbon.

Macronutrients
In addition to carbon, hydrogen and oxygen, cells need a few other elements in sufficient quantity. In
particular, cells need nitrogen for the formation of proteins, nucleic acids, and a few other cell
components. Cells also need phosphorous, which is a crucial component of nucleic acids (think
sugar-phosphate backbone!), phospholipids, and adenosine triphosphate or ATP. Sulfur is necessary for
a few amino acids, as well as several vitamins, while potassium is needed for enzymes, and magnesium
is used to stabilize ribosomes and membrane. Collectively these elements (including C, H, and O) are
referred to as the macronutrients.

Growth Factors
Some microbes can synthesize certain organic molecules that they need from scratch, as long as they are
provided with carbon source and inorganic salts. Other microbes require that certain organic compounds
exist within their environment. These organic molecules essential for growth are called growth factors
and fall in three categories: 1) amino acids (building blocks of protein), 2) purines and pyrimidines
(building blocks of nucleic acid), and 3) vitamins (enzyme cofactors).

Uptake of Nutrients
In order to support its’ activities, a cell must bring in nutrients from the external environment across the
cell membrane. In bacteria and archaea, several different transport mechanisms exist.

Passive Diffusion
Passive or simple diffusion allows for the passage across the cell membrane of simple molecules and
gases, such as CO2, O2, and H2O. In this case, a concentration gradient must exist, where there is higher
concentration of the substance outside of the cell than there is inside the cell. As more of the substance is
transported into the cell the concentration gradient decreases, slowing the rate of diffusion.

Facilitated Diffusion
Facilitated diffusion also involves the use of a concentration gradient, where the concentration of the
substance is higher outside the cell, but differs with the use of carrier proteins (sometimes called
permeases). These proteins are embedded within the cell membrane and provide a channel or pore
across the membrane barrier, allowing for the passage of larger molecules. If the concentration gradient
dissipates, the passage of molecules into the cell stops. Each carrier protein typically exhibits specificity,
only transporting in a particular type of molecule or closely related molecules.

Active Transport
Many types of nutrient uptake require that a cell be able to transport substances against a concentration
gradient (i.e. with a higher concentration inside the cell than outside). In order to do this, a cell must
utilize metabolic energy for the transport of the substance through carrier proteins embedded in the
membrane. This is known as active transport. All types of active transport utilize carrier proteins.

Active Transport Versus Facilitated Diffusion.

Primary active transport
Primary active transport involves the use of chemical energy, such as ATP, to drive the transport. One
example is the ABC system, which utilizes ATP-Binding Cassette transporters. Each ABC
transporter is composed of three different components: 1) membrane-spanning proteins that form a
pore across the cell membrane (i.e. carrier protein), 2) an ATP binding region that hydrolyzes ATP,
providing the energy for the passage across the membrane, and 3) a substrate-binding protein, a
peripheral protein that binds to the appropriate substance to be transporter and ferries it to the
membrane-spanning proteins. In gram negative bacteria the substrate-binding protein is located in the
cell’s periplasm, while in gram positive bacteria the substrate-binding protein is attached to the outside
of the cell membrane.

ABC Transporter Structure.

Secondary active transport
Secondary active transport utilizes energy from a proton motive force (PMF). A PMF is an ion
gradient that develops when the cell transports electrons during energy-conserving processes. Positively
charged protons accumulate along the outside of the negatively charged cell, creating a proton gradient
between the outside of the cell and the inside.
There are three different types of transport events for simple transport: uniport, symport, and antiport
and each mechanism utilizes a different protein porter. Uniporters transport a single substance across
the membrane, either in or out. Symporters transport two substances across the membrane at the same
time, typically a proton paired with another molecule. Antiporters transport two substances across the
membrane as well, but in opposite directions. As one substance enters the cell, the other substance is
transported out.

Uniport Symport Antiport. By Lupask (Own work) [Public domain], via Wikimedia
Commons

Group Translocation
Group translocation is a distinct type of active transport, using energy from an energy-rich organic
compound that is not ATP. Group translocation also differs from both simple transport and ABC
transporters in that the substance being transported is chemically modified in the process.
One of the best studied examples of group translocation is the phosphoenolpyruvate: sugar
phosphotransferase system (PTS), which uses energy from the high-energy molecule
phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) to transport sugars into the cell. A phosphate is transferred from the PEP
to the incoming sugar during the process of transportation.

Group Translocation via PTS.

Iron Uptake

Siderophores and Receptor Sites.

Iron is required by microbes for the function of their cytochromes and enzymes, resulting in it being a
growth-limiting micronutrient. However, little free iron is available in environments, due to its
insolubility. Many bacteria have evolved siderophores, organic molecules that chelate or bind ferric
iron with high affinity. Siderophores are released by the organism to the surrounding environment,
whereby they bind any available ferric iron. The iron-siderophore complex is then bound by a specific
receptor on the outside of the cell, allowing the iron to be transported into the cell.

Energetics & Redox Reactions
Introduction to Metabolism
Metabolism refers to the sum of chemical reactions that occur within a cell. Catabolism is the

breakdown of organic and inorganic molecules, used to release energy and derive molecules that could
be used for other reactions. Anabolism is the synthesis of more complex molecules from simpler
organic and inorganic molecules, which requires energy.

Energetics
While some energy is lost as heat in chemical reactions, the measurement of interest for cells is the
amount of free energy (G), or the energy available to do work. Cells perform three different types of
work: chemical work (such as anabolism), transport work (such as nutrient uptake), and mechanical
work (such as the rotation of a flagellum).
The change in free energy is typically denoted as ΔG°’, which indicates the change in free energy under
standard conditions of pH 7, 25oC, 1 atmosphere pressure (also known as the standard free energy
change). A reaction that generates a positive ΔG°’ indicates that the reaction requires energy and
is endergonic in nature. A reaction that generates a negative ΔG°’ indicates that the reaction releases
energy and is exergonic in nature. Reactions that are exergonic release energy that can be conserved by
the cell to do work.

Adenosine triphosphate (ATP)
Adenosine triphosphate or ATP is a high-energy molecule used by all cells for energy currency, partly
because it readily donates a phosphoryl group to other molecules. An exergonic reaction will release
energy, driving the synthesis of ATP from the addition of a phosphate molecule (orthophosphate or Pi)
to adenosine diphosphate or ADP. An endergonic reaction, which requires energy, will couple with the
hydrolysis of ATP to ADP + Pi, using the released energy to drive the reaction.

Enzymes
In order for a chemical reaction to proceed, chemical bonds must be broken. The energy required to
break bonds is called activation energy. The amount of activation energy required by a cell can be
lowered with the help of a catalyst, substances which assist the reaction to proceed without being
changed themselves by the reaction. Cells use protein catalysts known as enzymes.

Redox Reactions
Cells conserve energy in the form of ATP by coupling its synthesis to the release of energy via
oxidation-reduction (redox) reactions, where electrons are passed from an electron donor to an
electron acceptor. The oxidation of a molecule refers to the loss of its electrons, while the reduction of
a molecule refers to its gain of electrons. Organic chemists often refer to the process by the mnemonic
OIL RIG: Oxidation Is Loss, Reduction Is Gain. A molecule being oxidized is acting as an electron
donor, while the molecule being reduced is acting as an electron acceptor. Since electrons represent
energy, a substance with many electrons to donate can be thought of as energy-rich.

Conjugate Redox Pair
Electrons do not exist freely in solution, they must be coupled with atoms or molecules. Every redox
reaction consists of two half reaction, where one substance donates electrons and thus becomes an
oxidized product while another substance accepts the electrons and thus becomes a reduced product.
Conjugate redox pair refers to the acceptor and donor of a half reaction.
A substance can be either an electron donor or an electron acceptor, dependent upon the other
substances in the reaction. A redox couple represents both forms of a substance in a half reaction, with
the oxidized form (the electron acceptor) always placed on the left and the reduced form (the electron
donor) on the right. An example would be ½ O2/H2O, where H2O could serve as an electron donor and
O2 could serve as an electron acceptor. Each half reaction is given a standard reduction potential
(E’0) in volts or millivolts, which is a measurement of the tendency of the donor in the reaction to give
up electrons. A substance with greater tendency to donate electrons in the reduced form has a more
negative E’0, while a substance with a weak tendency to donate electrons in the reduced form has a less
negative or even positive E’0. A substance with a negative E’0 makes a very good electron donor, in the
reduced form.

Redox Tower
The information regarding standard reduction potentials for various redox couples is displayed in the
form of a redox tower, which lists the couples in a vertical form based on their E’0. Redox couples with
the most negative E’0 on listed at the top while those with the most positive E’0 are listed on the bottom.
The reduced substance with the greatest tendency to donate electrons would be found at the top of the
tower on the right, while the oxidized substance with the greatest tendency to accept electrons would be
found at the bottom of the tower on the left. Redox couples in the middle can serve as either electron
donors or acceptors, depending upon what substance they partner with for a reaction. The difference
between reduction potentials of a donor and an acceptor (ΔE’0) is measured as acceptor E’0 minus
donor E’0. The larger the value for ΔE’0, the more potential energy for a cell. Larger values are derived
when there is the biggest distance between the donor and the acceptor (or a bigger fall down the tower).

Electron Tower.
While ΔE’0 is proportional to ΔG°’, the number of electrons that a substance has to donate is important
too. The actual formula is:

where n is the number of electrons being transferred and F is the Faraday constant (23,062 cal/molevolt, 96, 480 J/mole-volt).

Electron Carriers
The transference of electrons from donor to acceptor does not occur directly, since chemically dissimilar
electron donors and acceptors might never interact with one another. Instead, many cellular

intermediates participate in the process, with the possibility for energy capture occurring along the way.
These intermediates are called electron carriers and they go back and forth between a reduced form
(when they are carrying an electron) and an oxidized form (after they have passed the electron on),
without being consumed in the reaction themselves.
In order for the reaction to be energetically favorable for the cell, the carriers must be arranged in order
of their standard reduction potential (i.e. going down the redox tower), with an electron being passed
from a carrier with the most negative E’0 to a carrier with a less negative E’0. It is important to note that
some carriers accept both electrons and protons, while other carriers accept electrons only. This fact will
become of crucial importance later, in the discussion of how energy is generated.
While there are many different electron carriers, some unique to specific organisms or groups of
organisms, let us cover some of the more common ones:
Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+/NADH) – a co-enzyme that carriers both electrons
(e-) and protons (H+), two of each. A closely related molecule is nicotinamide adenine
dinucleotide phosphate (NADP+/ NADPH), which accepts 2 electrons and 1 proton.
Flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD/FADH) and flavin mononucleotide (FMN/FMNH) –
carry 2 electrons and 2 protons each. Proteins with these molecules are called flavoproteins.
Coenzyme Q (CoQ)/ubiquinone – carries 2 electrons and 2 protons.
Cytochromes – use iron atoms as part of a heme group to carry 1 electron at a time.
Iron-sulfur (Fe-S) proteins, such as ferredoxin – use iron atoms not part of heme group to
carry 1 electron at a time.

Electron Transport Chain
The process starts with an initial electron donor, a substance from outside of the cell, and ends with a
final electron acceptor, another substance from outside of the cell. In the middle the electrons are passed
from carrier to carrier, as the electrons work their way down the electron tower. In order to make the
process more efficient, most of the electron carriers are embedded within a membrane of the cell, in the
order that they are arranged on a redox tower. These electron transport chains are found within the cell
membrane of bacteria and archaea, and within the mitochondrial membrane of eukaryotes.

Chemoorganotrophy
Chemoorganotrophy is a term used to denote the oxidation of organic chemicals to yield energy. In
other words, an organic chemical serves as the initial electron donor. The process can be performed in
the presence or absence of oxygen, depending upon what is available to a cell and whether or not they
have the enzymes to deal with toxic oxygen by-products.

Aerobic Respiration
To start, let us focus on the catabolism of organic compounds when it occurs in the presence of oxygen.
In other words, oxygen is being used as the final electron acceptor. When the process utilizes glycolysis
and the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle to completely oxidize an organic compound down to CO 2, it is
known as aerobic respiration. This generates the most ATP for a cell, given the large amount of
distance between the initial electron donor (glucose) and the final electron acceptor (oxygen), as well as
the large number of electrons that glucose has to donate.

Organic Energy Sources
In chemoorganotrophy, energy is derived from the oxidation of an organic compound. There are many
different organic compounds available to a cell, such as proteins, polysaccharides, and lipids. But
cellular pathways are arranged in such a way to increase metabolic efficiency. Thus, the cell funnels
reactions into a few common pathways. By convention, glucose is used as the starting molecule to
describe each process.

Glycolysis
Glycolysis is a nearly universal pathway for the catabolism of glucose to pyruvate. The pathway is
divided into two parts: part I, which focuses on modifications to the 6-carbon sugar glucose, and part II,
where the 6-carbon compound is split into two 3-carbon molecules, yielding a bifurcated pathway. Part I
actually requires energy in the form of 2 molecules of ATP, in order to phosphorylate or activate the
sugar. Part II is the energy conserving phase of the reaction, where 4 molecules of ATP are generated by
substrate-level phosphorylation, where a high-energy molecule directly transfers a Pi to ADP.
The net yield of energy from glycolysis is 2 molecules of ATP for every molecule of glucose. In

addition, 2 molecules of the carrier NAD+ are reduced, forming NADH. In aerobic respiration, these
electrons will ultimately be transferred by NADH to an electron transport chain, allowing the cell to
capture more energy. Lastly, 2 molecules of the 3-carbon compound pyruvate are produced, which can
be further oxidized to capture more energy for the cell.

Glycolysis.

Tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle
The tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle picks up at the end of glycolysis, in order to fully oxidize each
molecule of pyruvate down to 3 molecules of CO2, as occurs in aerobic respiration. It begins with a type
of connecting reaction before the molecules can enter the cycle proper. The connecting reaction reduces
1 molecule of NAD+ to NADH for every molecule of pyruvate, in the process of making citrate.

The citrate enters the actual cycle part of the process, undergoing a series of oxidations that yield many
different products, many of them important precursor metabolites for other pathways. As electrons are
released, carriers are reduced, yielding 3 molecules of NADH and 1 molecule of FADH2 for every
molecule of pyruvate. In addition, 1 molecule of GTP (which can be thought of as an ATP-equivalent
molecule) is generated by substrate-level phosphorylation.
Taking into account that there were two molecules of pyruvate generated from glycolysis, the net yield
of the TCA cycle and its connecting reaction are: 2 molecules of GTP, 8 molecules of NADH, and 2
molecules of FADH2. But where does the ATP come from? So far we only have the net yield of 2
molecules from glycolysis and the 2 molecules of ATP-equivalents (i.e. GTP) from the TCA cycle. This
is where the electron transport chain comes into play.

TCA at the End of Glycolysis.

Oxidative Phosphorylation
The synthesis of ATP from electron transport generated from oxidizing a chemical energy source is
known oxidative phosphorylation. We have already established that electrons get passed from carrier
to carrier, in order of their standard reduction potential. We have also established that some carriers
accept electrons and protons, while others accept electrons only. What happens to the unaccepted
protons? And how does this generate ATP for the cell? Welcome to the wonderful world of the proton
motive force (PMF) and ATP synthase!

Proton Motive Force
Protons that are not accepted by electron carriers migrate outward, to line the outer part of the
membrane. For bacteria and archaea, this means lining the cell membrane and explains the importance
for the negative charge of the cell.

As the positively charged protons accumulate, a concentration gradient of protons develops. This results
in the cytoplasm of the cell being more alkaline and more negative, leading to both a chemical and
electrical potential difference. This proton motive force (PMF) can be used to do work for the cell,
such as in the rotation of the bacterial flagellum or the uptake of nutrients.

ATP synthase
The PMF can also be used to synthesize ATP, with the help of an enzyme known as ATP synthase (or
ATPase). This large enzyme has two components, one that spans the membrane and one that sticks into
the cytoplasm and synthesizes the ATP. Protons are driven through the membrane-spanning component,
generating torque that drives the rotation of the cytoplasmic portion. When the cytoplasmic component
returns to its original configuration it binds Pi to ADP, generating a molecule of ATP.

Aerobic Respiration Summary
After all that, what did the cell end up with, from using aerobic respiration? Using substrate-level
phosphorylation the cell generated 2 net molecules of ATP during glycolysis, in addition to 2 molecules
of ATP-equivalents from the TCA cycle. For reduced carriers, there were 2 molecules of NADH
generated during glycolysis, in addition to 8 molecules from the TCA cycle or its connecting reaction.
There were also 2 molecules of FADH2 from the TCA cycle. All of those electrons were passed on to
the ETC (and eventually to oxygen), in order to develop a PMF, so that ATP synthase could generate
ATP. How much ATP is generated?
Research indicates that the process is not completely efficient and there is some “leakage” that occurs.
Current estimates are that 2.5 ATP are generated for every molecule of NADH, while 1.5 ATP are
generated for every molecule of FADH2. Using these values would allow the cell to synthesize 25
molecules of ATP from all the NAD+ that was reduced in the process, in addition to 3 molecules of ATP
from the FAD+ that was reduced. This would bring the grand total of maximum ATP produced to 32
(counting the GTP in that figure).

ATP Generation.

Anaerobic Chemoorganotrophy
Certainly oxygen is a wonderful final electron acceptor, particularly when paired with glucose as an
initial electron donor. It is part of the lowest redox couple on an electron tower, with an extremely
positive standard electron potential. But what does a microbe do, if oxygen is not available or it lacks the
protections necessary from toxic oxygen by-products? Let us focus on the generation of energy in the
absence of oxygen, using a different electron acceptor, when an organic chemical is still being used as
the initial electron donor. Examples of anaerobic chemoorganotrophy include anaerobic respiration and
fermentation.

Anaerobic Respiration
Anaerobic respiration starts with glycolysis as well and the pyruvate can be shunted off to the TCA
cycle, just like in aerobic respiration. In fact, oxidative phosphorylation is used to generate most of the
ATP, which means the use of an ETC and ATP synthase. The key difference is that the final electron
acceptor will not be oxygen.
There are a variety of possible final electron acceptors that can be used in anaerobic respiration,
allowing microbes to live in a wide variety of locations. The best electron acceptor will be the one that is
lowest down on the electron tower, in an oxidized form (i.e. on the left-hand side of the redox couple).
Some common electron acceptors include nitrate (NO3-), ferric iron (Fe3+), sulfate (SO42-), carbonate
(CO32-) or even certain organic compounds, like fumarate.
How much ATP is generated by anaerobic respiration? That will depend upon the final electron acceptor
being used. It will not be as much as is generated during aerobic respiration, since we know that oxygen

in the best possible electron acceptor. Selection of an electron acceptor other than oxygen pushes an
organism up the electron tower, shortening the distance between the electron donor and the acceptor,
reducing the amount of ATP produced.

Fermentation
No matter what they might teach you in a biochemical class, fermentation and anaerobic respiration are
not the same thing, at least not to a microbiologist.
Fermentation is catabolism of glucose in the absence of oxygen as well and it does have some
similarities to anaerobic respiration. Most obviously, it does not use oxygen as the final electron
acceptor. It actually uses pyruvate, an organic compound. Fermentation starts with glycolysis, a process
which we have already covered, that also starts off both aerobic respiration and anaerobic respiration.
What does it yield? Two net molecules of ATP by substrate-level phosphorylation and 2 molecules of
NADH. Organisms doing either aerobic or anaerobic respiration would then utilize oxidative
phosphorylation in order to increase their ATP yield. Fermenters, however, lack an ETC or repress
synthesis of their ETC when oxygen is not available, so they do not use the TCA cycle at all.
Without the use of an ETC (or a PMF or ATP synthase), no further ATP is generated beyond what was
synthesized during glycolysis. But organisms using fermentation cannot just stop with glycolysis, since
eventually all their molecules of NAD+ would become reduced. In order to re-oxidize this electron
carrier they use pyruvate as a final electron acceptor, yielding a variety of fermentation products such as
ethanol, CO2, and various acids.

Lactate Fermentation. By Sjantoni (Own work) [CC BY-SA 3.0], via Wikimedia Commons
Fermentation products, although considered waste products for the cell, are vitally important for
humans. We rely on the process of fermentation to produce a variety of fermented foods (beer, wine,

bread, cheese, tofu), in addition to using the products for a variety of industrial processes.

Chemolithotrophy & Nitrogen Metabolism
Chemolithotrophy
Chemolithotrophy is the oxidation of inorganic chemicals for the generation of energy. The process
can use oxidative phosphorylation, just like aerobic and anaerobic respiration, but now the substance
being oxidized (the electron donor) is an inorganic compound. The electrons are passed off to carriers
within the electron transport chain, generating a proton motive force that is used to generate ATP with

the help of ATP synthase.

Chemolithotrophy Pathways.

Electrons donors
Chemolithotrophs use a variety of inorganic compounds as electron donors, with the most common
substances being hydrogen gas, sulfur compounds (such as sulfide and sulfur), nitrogen compounds
(such as ammonium and nitrite), and ferrous iron.
Hydrogen oxidizers – these organisms oxidize hydrogen gas (H2) with the use of a
hydrogenase enzyme. Both aerobic and anaerobic hydrogen oxidizers exist, with the aerobic
organisms eventually reducing oxygen to water.
Sulfur oxidizers – as a group these organisms are capable of oxidizing a wide variety of
reduced and partially reduced sulfur compounds such as hydrogen sulfide (H2S), elemental
sulfur (S0), thiosulfate (S2O32-), and sulfite (SO32-). Sulfate (SO42-) is frequently a byproduct of the oxidation. Often the oxidation occurs in a stepwise fashion with the help of the
sulfite oxidase enzyme.
Nitrogen oxidizers – the oxidation of ammonia (NH3) is performed as a two-step process by
nitrifying microbes, where one group oxidizes ammonia to nitrite (NO2-) and the second group
oxidizes the nitrite to nitrate (NO3-). The entire process is known as nitrification and is
performed by small groups of aerobic bacteria and archaea, often found living together in soil or
in water systems.
Iron oxidizers – these organisms oxidize ferrous iron (Fe2+) to ferric iron (Fe3+). Since Fe2+
has such a positive standard reduction potential, the bioenergetics are not extremely favorable,
even using oxygen as a final electron acceptor. The situation is made more difficult for these
organisms by the fact that Fe2+ spontaneously oxidizes to Fe3+ in the presence of oxygen; the
organisms must use it for their own purposes before that happens.

Electron acceptors
Chemolithotrophy can occur aerobically or anaerobically. Just as with either type of respiration, the best

electron acceptor is oxygen, to create the biggest distance between the electron donor and the electron
acceptor. Using a non-oxygen acceptor allows chemolithotrophs to have greater diversity and the ability
to live in a wider variety of environments, although they sacrifice energy production.

Amount of ATP generated
Just as both the electron donors and acceptors can vary widely for this group of organisms, the amount
of ATP generated for their efforts will vary widely as well. They will not make as much ATP as an
organism using aerobic respiration, since the largest ΔE0’ is found using glucose as an electron donor
and oxygen as an electron acceptor. But how much less than 32 molecules of ATP greatly depends upon
the actual donor and acceptor being used. The smaller the distance between the two, the less ATP that
will be formed.

Chemolithoautotrophs vs chemolithoheterotrophs
Most chemolithotrophs are autotrophs (chemolithoautotrophs), where they fix atmospheric carbon
dioxide to assemble the organic compounds that they need. These organisms require both ATP and
reducing power (i.e. NADH/NADPH) in order to ultimately convert the oxidized molecule CO2 into a
greatly reduced organic compound, like glucose. If a chemolithoautotroph is using an electron donor
with a higher redox potential than NAD+/NADP, they must use reverse electron flow to push electrons
back up the electron tower. This is energetically unfavorable to the cell, consuming energy from the
proton motive force to drive electrons in a reverse direction back through the ETC.
Some microbes are chemolithoheterotrophs, using an inorganic chemical for their energy and electron
needs, but relying on organic chemicals in the environment for their carbon needs. These organisms are
also called mixotrophs, since they require both inorganic and chemical compounds for their growth and
reproduction.

Nitrogen Metabolism
The nitrogen cycle depicts the different ways in which nitrogen, an essential element for life, is used and
converted by organisms for various purposes. Much of the chemical conversions are performed by
microbes as part of their metabolism, performing a valuable service in the process for other organisms in
providing them with an alternate chemical form of the element.

Nitrogen Cycle.

Nitrogen Fixation
Nitrogen fixation describes the conversion of the relatively inert dinitrogen gas (N2) into ammonia
(NH3), a much more useable form of nitrogen for most life forms. The process is performed by
diazotrophs, a limited number of bacteria and archaea that can grow without an external source of fixed
nitrogen, because of their abilities. Nitrogen fixation is an essential process for Earth’s organisms, since
nitrogen is a required component of various organic molecules, such as amino acids and nucleotides.
Plants, animals, and other organisms rely on bacteria and archaea to provide nitrogen in a fixed form,
since no eukaryote is known that can fix nitrogen.
Nitrogen fixation is an extremely energy and electron intensive process, in order to break the triple bond
in N2 and reduce it to NH3. It requires a particular enzyme known as nitrogenase, which is inactivated
by O2. Thus, nitrogen fixation must take place in an anaerobic environment. Aerobic nitrogen-fixing

organisms must devise special conditions or arrangements in order to protect their enzyme. Nitrogenfixing organisms can either exist independently or pair up with a plant host:
1. Symbiotic nitrogen-fixing organisms: these bacteria partner up with a plant, to provide them
with an environment appropriate for the functioning of their nitrogenase enzyme. The bacteria
live in the plant’s tissue, often in root nodules, fixing nitrogen and sharing the results. The plant
provides both the location to fix nitrogen, as well as additional nutrients to support the energytaxing process of nitrogen fixation. It has been shown that the bacteria and the host exchange
chemical recognition signals that facilitate the relationship. One of the best known bacteria in
this category is Rhizobium, which partners up with plants of the legume family (clover,
soybeans, alfalfa, etc).
2. Free-living nitrogen-fixing organisms: these organisms, both bacteria and archaea, fix
nitrogen for their own use that ends up being shared when the organisms dies or is ingested.
Free-living nitrogen-fixing organisms that grow anaerobically do not have to worry about
special adaptations for their nitrogenase enzyme. Aerobic organisms must make adaptations.
Cyanobacteria, a multicellular bacterium, make specialized cells known as heterocysts in
which nitrogen fixation occurs. Since Cyanobacteria produce oxygen as part of their
photosynthesis, an anoxygenic version occurs within the heterocyst, allowing the nitrogenase to
remain active. The heterocysts share the fixed nitrogen with surrounding cells, while the
surrounding cells provide additional nutrients to the heterocysts.

Assimilation
Assimilation is a reductive process by which an inorganic form of nitrogen is reduced to organic
nitrogen compounds such as amino acids and nucleotides, allowing for cellular growth and reproduction.
Only the amount needed by the cell is reduced. Ammonia assimilation occurs when the ammonia
(NH3)/ammonium ion (NH4+) formed during nitrogen fixation is incorporated into cellular nitrogen.
Assimilative nitrate reduction is a reduction of nitrate to cellular nitrogen, in a multi-step process
where nitrate is reduced to nitrite then ammonia and finally into organic nitrogen.

Nitrification
As mentioned above, nitrification is performed by chemolithotrophs using a reduced or partially reduced
form of nitrogen as an electron donor to obtain energy. ATP is gained by the process of oxidative
phosphorylation, using a ETC, PMF, and ATP synthase.

Denitrification
Denitrification refers to the reduction of NO3- to gaseous nitrogen compounds, such as N2.
Denitrifying microbes perform anaerobic respiration, using NO3- as an alternate final electron acceptor
to O2. This is a type of dissimilatory nitrate reduction where the nitrate is being reduced during
energy conservation, not for the purposes of making organic compounds. This produces large amounts
of excess byproducts, resulting in the loss of nitrogen from the local environment to the atmosphere.

Anammox
Anammox or anaerobic ammonia oxidation is performed by marine bacteria, relatively recently

discovered, that utilize nitrogen compounds as both electron acceptor and electron donor. Ammonia is
oxidized anaerobically as the electron donor while nitrite is utilized as the electron acceptor, with
dinitrogen gas produced as a byproduct. The reactions occur within the anammoxosome, a specialized
cytoplasmic structure which constitutes 50-70% of the total cell volume. Just like denitrification, the
anammox reaction removes fixed nitrogen from a local environment, releasing it to the atmosphere.

Phototrophy
Of course, getting energy from sunlight, that’s pretty cool. Or is it hot? Bad jokes aside, hopefully you
remember the basic process of photosynthesis from previous classes, where they might have talked
about what happens in plants. The Z pathway? Anything? Do not panic – we will talk about it. Along
with the other types of phototrophy that microbes use.

Photoautotrophs vs Photoheterotrophs
Phototrophy (or “light eating”) refers to the process by which energy from the sun is captured and
converted into chemical energy, in the form of ATP. The term photosynthesis is more precisely used to
describe organisms that both convert sunlight into ATP (the “light reaction”) but then also proceed to
use the ATP to fix carbon dioxide into organic compounds (the Calvin cycle). These organisms are the

photoautotrophs. In the microbial world, there are also photoheterotrophs, organisms that convert
sunlight into ATP but utilize pre-made organic compounds available in the environment. The ATP could
then be used for other purposes.

Pigments
In order to convert energy from sunlight into ATP, organisms use light-sensitive pigments. Plants and
algae utilize chlorophylls, which are used by cyanobacteria as well. Chlorophylls are green in color, due
to the fact that they absorb red and blue wavelengths (≈675 nm and 430 nm) and transmit green light.
The purple and green bacteria have bacteriochlorophylls, which absorb higher wavelengths (≈870 nm)
than the chlorophylls, allowing different phototrophs to occupy the same environment without
competing with one another.
Phototrophs can contain accessory pigments as well, such as the carotenoids and phycobiliproteins.
Carotenoids, which absorb blue light (400-550 nm), are typically yellow, orange, or red in color. The
phycobiliproteins can be split in two groups: phycoerythrin, which transmits a red color, and
phycocyanin, which transmits a blue color. The accessory pigments can serve to expand the wavelength
range of light being absorbed, allowing better utilization of light available. In addition, these pigments
can serve a protective function for the organism by acting as an antioxidant.

Phototrophic Pigment.
In bacteria and archaea, the phototrophic pigments are housed within invaginations of the cell membrane
or within a chlorosome. Light-harvesting pigments form antennae, which funnel the light to other
molecules in reaction centers, which actually perform the conversion of light energy into ATP.

Photophosphorylation in general
For any organism, the general process of phototrophy is going to be the same. A photosystem antennae

absorbs light and funnels the energy to a reaction center, specifically to a special pair of chlorophyll/
bacteriochlorophyll molecules. The molecules become excited, changing to a more negative reduction
potential (i.e. jumping up the electron tower). The electrons can then be passed through an electron
transport chain of carriers, such as ferredoxin and cytochromes, allowing for the development of a
proton motive force. The protons are brought back across the plasma membrane through ATPase,
generating ATP in the process. Since the original energy from the process came from sunlight, as
opposed to a chemical, the process is called photophosphorylation. If the electrons are returned to the
special pair of chlorophyll/bacteriochlorophyll molecules (cyclic photophosphorylation), the process
can be repeated over and over again. If the electrons are diverted elsewhere, such as for the reduction of
NAD(P) (non-cyclic photophosphorylation), then an external electron source must be used to replenish
the system.

Anoxygenic Phototrophy
Purple phototrophic bacteria
Purple phototrophic bacteria engage in anoxygenic phototrophy, indicating that they do not generate
oxygen during the process. They have a single photosystem with bacteriochlorophyll, allowing them to
use cyclic photophosphorylation as described above for the formation of ATP. But if a purple bacterium
wants to grow as a photoautotroph, it will also need reducing power in the form of NAD(P)H.
The reaction center of purple bacteria (known as P870) has an E0’ of +0.5V. After being hit by a photon
of light, the potential changes to -1.0V, which is insufficient to reduce NAD(P) with its E0’ of -0.32V.
Thus, autotrophic purple bacteria must engage in a process known as reverse electron flow, using
energy from the proton motive force to drive electrons up the electron tower. Additionally, they must
find an external electron donor to replenish the electrons now diverted to NAD(P). Typically the
electrons come from H2S or elemental sulfur, with various sulfur byproducts produced.

Photophosphorylation in Purple Bacteria.
In the presence of organic compounds, the purple bacteria often exist as photoheterotrophs, utilizing
cyclic photophosphorylation to generate ATP and getting their organic compounds from the
environment. This eliminates the need for using reverse electron flow, an energetically unfavorable
process, as well as the need for external electron donors.

Green phototrophic bacteria
Green phototrophic bacteria also engage in anoxygenic phototrophy, utilizing a single photosystem
with bacteriochlorophyll for cyclic photophosphorylation in the production of ATP. However, they also
use this same photosystem for generation of reducing power, by periodically drawing off electrons to
NAD+. The use of reverse electron flow is unnecessary, however, since the initial carrier, ferredoxin
(Fd) has a E0’ with a more negative reduction potential than NAD(P). An external electron donor is
required, typically by using H2S or thiosulfate. Thus, the green bacteria operate as photoautotrophs, by
alternating the use of their photosystem for ATP or NAD(P)H.

Green and Purple Phototrophic Bacteria.

Oxygenic Phototrophy
Oxygenic phototrophy is used by cyanobacteria containing chlorophyll a, with two distinct
photosystems, each containing separate reaction centers. This allows for the generation of both ATP and
reducing power in one process, facilitating photoautotrophic growth through the fixation of CO2. This
can appropriately be referred to as photosynthesis and it is the same process used by plants, commonly
referred to as the “Z pathway.”
The process starts when light energy decreases the reduction potential of P680 chlorophyll a molecules
contained in photosystem II (PSII). The electrons are then passed through an electron transport chain,
generating ATP via a proton motive force. Electrons are then passed to photosystem I (PSI), where they
get hit by another photon of light, decreasing their reduction potential even more. The electrons are then
passed through a different electron transport chain, eventually being passed off to NADP+ for the
formation of NADPH.

Overview of Oxygenic Photosynthesis in Cyanobacteria.
The process is an example of noncyclic photophosphorylation, since the electrons are not returned to the
original photosystem. Thus, an external electron donor is required in order to allow the process to repeat.
Water, found on the right side of the redox couple O2/H2O, is normally a poor electron donor, due to its
extremely positive reduction potential. But the reduction potential of P680 chlorophyll a is even more
positive when not excited, allowing for water to serve as an electron donor. The hydrolysis of water
leads to the evolution of oxygen, a welcome byproduct for all organisms that use aerobic respiration. It
is thought that cyanobacteria are responsible for the oxygenation of Earth, allowing for the development
of aerobic respiration as a form of metabolism.
There are some conditions under which cyanobacteria only use PSI, essentially performing a form of
anoxygenic phototrophy, despite their possession of chlorophyll a. This occurs within the heterocysts of
cyanobacteria, where oxygen inactivates the nitrogenase enzymes. Heterocysts degrade PSII, ensuring
that oxygen will not be produced as a byproduct, while still allowing for the production of ATP with the
remaining photosystem.

Rhodopsin-Based Phototrophy
One unusual form of phototrophy is used by archaea, without the use of chlorophyll or
bacteriochlorophyll. Instead these organisms use a bacteriorhodopsin (more appropriately called an
archaearhodopsin), a retinal molecule related to the one found in vertebrate eyes. When the rhodopsin
absorbs light it undergoes a conformational change, pumping a proton across the cell membrane and
leading to the development of a proton motive force, without the participation of an electron transport
chain.

Taxonomy & Evolution
Evolution
It is believed that the Earth is 4.6 billion year old, with the first cells appearing approximately 3.8 billion
years ago. Those cells were undoubtably microbes, eventually giving rise to all the life forms that we
envision today, as well as the life forms that went extinct before we got here. How did this progression
occur?

Early Earth
Conditions on early Earth were most likely extremely hot, anoxic (lacking oxygen), with reduced
inorganic chemicals in abundance. While no one knows exactly how cells came about, it is likely that
they were initially suited to these harsh conditions.

RNA World
RNA, in its many forms, plays a crucial role in cellular activities. It has been hypothesized that RNA
played an even more central role in primitive cells, with self-replicating RNA containing a cell’s
information as well as having catalytic activity to synthesize proteins. Eventually this RNA world
evolved to one in which proteins took over the catalytic responsibilities and DNA became the common
form of information storage.

The “RNA World” and the Modern World.

Metabolic Diversity
Initial cells probably had a relatively primitive electron transference system, perhaps through just one
carrier, that still allowed for the development of a proton motive force to conserve energy. As
chemolithoautotrophs proliferated, organic material started to accumulate in the environment, providing
the conditions needed for the development of chemoorganotrophic organisms. These new cells oxidized
organic compounds, with their more negative redox potential and increased number of electrons. This
most likely lengthened electron transport chains, resulting in faster growth, and speeding up diversity
even more.

Phototrophy & Photosynthesis
At about 3.5 billion year ago some cells evolved phototrophic pigments, allowing for the conversion of
light energy into chemical energy. Initially phototrophs utilized anoxygenic phototrophy, using sulfur
products as an electron donor when performing CO2 fixation.
Stromatolites are layered rocks that form when minerals are incorporated into thick mats of microbes,
growing on water surfaces. Ancient stromatolites contain fossilized microbial mats made up of
cyanobacteria-like cells, indicating their presence relatively early in Earth’s history.
Approximately 2.5-3.3 billion year ago the cyanobacterial ancestors developed oxygenic photosynthesis
by acquiring two photosystems and the pigment chlorophyll a. This led to the use of water as an electron
donor, causing oxygen to accumulate in Earth’s atmosphere. This Great Oxidation Event substantially
changed the types of metabolism possible, allowing for the use of oxygen as a final electron acceptor.

Ozone Shield Formation
The development of an ozone shield around the Earth occurred around 2 billion years ago. Ozone (O3)
serves to block out much of the ultraviolet (UV) radiation coming from the sun, which can cause
significant damage to DNA. As oxygen accumulated in the environment, the O2 was converted to O3
when exposed to UV light, causing an ozone layer to form around Earth. This allowed organisms to start
inhabiting the surface of the planet, as opposed to just the ocean depths or soil layers.

Endosymbiosis
Evolution supports the idea of more primitive molecules or organisms being generated first, followed by
the more complex components or organisms over time. Endosymbiosis offers an explanation for the
development of eukaryotic cells, a more complex cell type with organelles or membrane-bound
enclosures.
It is generally accepted that eukaryotic ancestors arose when a cell ingested another cell, a free-living
bacterium, but did not digest it. This endosymbiont had capabilities that the proto-eukaryotic cell lacked,
such as the ability for phototrophy (i.e. chloroplasts) or oxidative phosphorylation (i.e. mitochondria).
Eventually the two became mutually dependent upon one another with the endosymbiont becoming an
organelle, with the chloroplast being derived from a cyanobacterial ancestor and the mitochondrion
being derived from a gram negative bacillus ancestor.

Endosymbiosis. By Signbrowser (Own work) [CC0], via Wikimedia Commons
Evidence to support this idea includes the fact that mitochondria and chloroplasts: have a single, circular
chromosome; undergo binary fission separate from the eukaryotic cell; have 70S sized ribosomes; have

a lipid bilayer with a 2:1 ratio of protein to lipid; and, perhaps most importantly, have rRNA sequences
that place them phylogenetically with the bacteria.

Phylogeny
Molecular Phylogeny
Phylogeny is a reference to the development of an organism evolutionarily. Molecular techniques allow
for the evolutionary assessment of organisms using genomes or ribosomal RNA (rRNA) nucleotide
sequences, generally believed to provide the most accurate information about the relatedness of
microbes.
Nucleic acid hybridization or DNA-DNA hybridization is a commonly used tool for molecular
phylogeny, comparing the similarities between genomes. The genomes of two organisms are heated up
or “melted” to separate the complementary strand and then allowed to cool down. Strands that have
complementary base sequences will re-anneal, while strands without complementation will remain
upaired. Typically one source of DNA is labeled, usually with radioactivity, to allow for identification of
each DNA source.
Nucleic acid sequencing, typically using the rRNAs from small ribosomal subunits, allows for direct
comparison of sequences. The ribosomal sequence is seen as ideal because the genes encoding it do not
change very much over time, nor does it appear to be strongly influenced by horizontal gene transfer.
This makes it an excellent “molecular chronometer,” or way to track genetic changes over a long
period of time, even between closely related organisms.

Phylogenetic Trees
Phylogenetic trees serve to show a pictorial example of how organisms are believed to be related
evolutionarily. The root of the tree is the last common ancestor for the organisms being compared (Last
Universal Common Ancestor or LUCA, if we are doing a comparison of all living cells on Earth).
Each node (or branchpoint) represents an occurrence where the organisms diverged, based on a genetic
change in one organism. The length of each branch can be used to indicate the amount of molecular
changes over time if the tree is scaled, with some sort of measurement that represents the number of
differences between sequences. The external nodes represent specific taxa or organisms (although they
can also represent specific genes), where a taxon is a set of organisms or groups of organisms. A clade
indicates a group of organisms that all have a particular ancestor in common.

Taxonomy
Taxonomy refers to the organization of organisms, based on their relatedness. Typically it involves
some type of classification scheme, the identification of isolates, and the naming or nomenclature of
included organisms. Many different classification schemes exist, although many have not been
appropriate for comparison of microorganisms.

Classification Systems
A phenetic classification system relies upon the phenotypes or physical appearances of organisms.
Phylogenetic classication uses evolutionary relationships of organisms. A genotypic classification
compares genes or genomes between organisms. The most popular approach is to use a polyphasic
approach, which combines aspects of all three previous systems.

Microbial Species
Currently there is no widely accepted “species definition” for microbes. The definition most commonly
used is one that relies upon both genetic and phenotypic information (a polyphasic approach), with a
threshold of 70% DNA-DNA hybridization and 97% 16S DNA sequence identity in order for two
organisms to be deemed as belonging to the same species.

Microbial Genetics
Let’s talk about sex. Bacterial sex. Ha! That is going to be difficult, since bacteria do not have sex.
Which presents a real problem for bacteria (and archaea, too) – how do they get the genetic variability
that they need? They might need a new gene to break down an unusual nutrient source or degrade an
antibiotic threatening to destroy them – acquiring the gene could mean the difference between life and
death. But where would these genes come from? How would the bacteria get a hold of them? We are
going to explore the processes that bacteria use to acquire new genes, the mechanisms known as
Horizontal Gene Transfer (HGT).

Conjugation
Conjugation is the process by which a donor bacterium transfers a copy of a plasmid to a recipient
bacterium, through a pilus. The process requires cell-to-cell contact. The donor cell (F+) has a
conjugative plasmid, an extrachromosomal piece of dsDNA that codes for the proteins necessary to
make a threadlike filament known as a pilus. The pilus is used to bind to the recipient (F-) cell, bringing
it in close proximity to the donor cell. It is believed that a channel is then opened between the two cells,
allowing for a ssDNA copy of the plasmid to enter the recipient cells. Both cells then make the

complementary copy to the ssDNA, resulting in two F+ cells capable of conjugation.

Conjugation. By Adenosine (Own work) [CC BY-SA 3.0], via Wikimedia Commons

Transformation
The process of transformation also allows a bacterial cell to acquire new genes, but it does not require
cell-to-cell contact. In this process the new genes are acquired directly from the environment. Typically
the process requires a donor cell that at some point lysed and released naked DNA to the environment.
The recipient cell is one that is capable of taking up the DNA from the environment and incorporating it
into its own genome, where the cell is described as being competent.
There are mechanical and chemical means of encouraging a cell to pick up DNA from the environment,

but natural competence is determined genetically. The process typically occurs at the end of exponential
phase of growth or beginning of the stationary phase, in the presence of high cell density and limited
nutrients. Under these conditions specific proteins are manufactured including DNA-binding proteins
(DNA translocase), endonucleases, and transmembrane channel proteins. Gram negative cells also
make a cell wall autolysin, to transport the DNA across the outer membrane.
Random pieces of DNA bind to receptors on the outside of the cell and are then transported into the cell
by the DNA translocase, through the transmembrane channel, a large structure often involving numerous
different proteins. An endonuclease can be used to degrade one strand of dsDNA, if only ssDNA may
pass into the cell, or to cleave the DNA fragment into smaller sizes .Once inside the cell, the DNA must
be incorporated into the bacterial chromosome by RecA (see Molecular Recombination below), for the
genes to be expressed.

Gene Acquisition via Transformation.

Transduction
Transduction involves the use of a virus, a bacteriophage, to act as a conduit for shuttling bacteria
genes from one cell to another, thus negating the necessity for cell-to-cell contact. There are two
different types of transduction: generalized transduction and specialized transduction.

Generalized Transduction
In generalized transduction, a bacterial host cell is infected with either a virulent or a temperate
bacteriophage engaging in the lytic cycle of replication. After the first three steps of replication
(absorption, penetration, and synthesis), the virus enters into the assembly stage, during which fully
formed virions are made. During this stage, random pieces of bacterial DNA are mistakenly packaged
into a phage head, resulting in the production of a transducing particle. While these particles are not
capable of infecting a cell in the conventional sense, they can bind to a new bacterial host cell and inject
their DNA inside. If the DNA (from the first bacterial host cell) is incorporated into the recipient’s

chromosome, the genes can be expressed.

Generalized Transduction.

Specialized Transduction
Specialized transduction can only occur with temperate bacteriophage, since it involves the lysogenic
cycle of replication. The bacteriophage randomly attaches to a bacterial host cell, injecting viral DNA
inside. The DNA integrates into the chromosome of the host cell, forming a prophage. At some point
induction occurs, where the prophage is excised from the bacterial chrosomsome. In specialized
transduction, the excision is incorrectly performed and a portion of bacterial genes immediately adjacent
to the viral genes are excised too. Since this DNA is used as the template for the synthesis stage, all
copies will be a hybrid of viral and bacterial DNA, and all resulting virions will contain both viral and
bacterial DNA.
Once the cell is lysed, the virions are released to infect other bacterial host cells. Each virion will attach
to the host cell and inject in the DNA hybrid, which could be incorporated into the host chromosome, if
a prophage is formed. At this point the second bacterial host cell can contain its own DNA, DNA from
the previous bacterial host cell, and viral DNA.

Molecular Recombination
In each of the cases of HGT, the process is only successful if the genes can be expressed by the altered
cell. In conjugation, the genes are located on a plasmid, under the control of promoters on the plasmid.
In transformation and transduction, where naked DNA is gaining access to the cell, the DNA could
easily be broken down by the cell with no genetic expression occurring. In order for the genes to be
expressed, the DNA must be recombined with the recipient’s chromosome.
The most common mechanism of molecular recombination is homologous recombination, involving
the RecA protein. In this process DNA from two sources are paired, based on similar nucleotide
sequence in one area. An endonuclease nicks one strand, allowing RecA to pair up bases from different
strands, a process known as strand invasion. The cross-over between DNA molecules is resolved with
resolvase, which cuts and rejoins the DNA into two separate dsDNA molecules.
Recombination can also occur using site-specific recombination, a process often used by viruses to
insert their genome into the chromosome of their host. This type of recombination is also used by
transposable elements (see next section).

Transposable Elements
Finally, we shouldn’t leave the topic of microbial genetics without at least exploring the role of
transposable elements or “jumping genes.” While these can play a very big role in the activation and

inactivation of bacterial genes, the best explanation derives from the work of Barbara McClintock in
corn, who won the Nobel Prize for her research in 1983. She demonstrated that transposable elements
can be responsible for the activation or inactivation of genes within an organism.
Transposable elements are relatively simple in structure, designed to move from one location to another
within a DNA molecule by a process known as transposition. All transposable elements code for the
enzyme transposase, the enzyme responsible allowing transposition to occur, and have short inverted
repeats (IRs) at each end.

Transposition.
The simplest transposable element is an insertion sequence (IS), which contains the transposase and
IRs of varying lengths. A transposon typically contains additional genes, with the exact type varying
widely from transposon to transposon. A transposon can be removed from one location and relocated to
another (the cut-and-paste model), a process known as conservative transposition. Alternatively, it can
be copied, with the copy being inserted at a second site, in a process known as replicative
transposition.

Genetic Engineering
Genetic engineering is the deliberate manipulation of DNA, using techniques in the laboratory to alter
genes in organisms. Even if the organisms being altered are not microbes, the substances and techniques
used are often taken from microbes and adapted for use in more complex organisms.

Steps in Cloning a Gene
Let us walk through the basic steps for cloning a gene, a process by which a gene of interest can be
replicated many times over. Let us pretend that we are going to genetically engineer E. coli cells to glow
in the dark, a characteristic that they do not naturally possess.
1. Isolate DNA of interest – first we need to identify the genes or genes that we are interested in,
the target DNA. If we want our E. coli cells to glow in the dark, we need to find an organism
that possesses this trait and identify the gene or genes responsible for the trait. The green
fluorescent protein (GFP) commonly used as an expression marker in molecular techniques
was originally isolated from jellyfish.In cloning a gene it is helpful to use a cloning vector,
typically a plasmid or virus, capable of independent replication that will stably carry the target
DNA from one location to another. Plasmid vectors are available from both bacteria and yeast.
2. Cut DNA with restriction endonucleases – once the target and vector DNA have been identified,
both types of DNA are cut using restriction endonucleases. These enzymes recognize short
sequences of DNA that are 4-8 bp long. The enzymes are widespread in both bacteria and
archaea, with each enzyme recognizing a specific inverted repeat sequence that is palindromic
(reads the same on each DNA strand, in the 5’ to 3’ direction).

Restriction Endonucleases.
While some restriction endonucleases cut straight across the DNA (i.e. blunt cut), many make
staggered cuts, producing a very short region of single-stranded DNA on each strand. These
single-stranded regions are referred to as “sticky ends,” and are invaluable in molecular cloning
since the unpaired bases will recombine with any DNA having the complementary base
sequence.
3. Combine target and vector DNA – after both types of DNA have been cleaved by the same
restriction endonuclease, the two types of DNA are combined together with the addition of
DNA ligase, an enzyme that repairs the covalent bonds on the sugar-phosphate backbone of the
DNA. This results in the creation of recombinant DNA, DNA molecules that contain the DNA
from two or more sources, also known as chimeras.

Ligation.
4. Introduce recombined molecule into host cell – once the target DNA has been stably combined
with vector DNA, the recombinant DNA must be introduced into a host cell, in order for the
genes to be replicated or expressed. There are different methods for introducing the recombinant
DNA, largely depending upon the complexity of the host organism. In the case of bacteria,
transformation is often the easiest method, using competent cells to pick up the recombinant
DNA molecules. Alternatively, electroporation can be used, where the cells are exposed to a
brief pulse of high –voltage electricity causing the plasma membrane to become temporarily
permeable to DNA passage.While some cells will acquire recombinant DNA with the
appropriate configuration (i.e. target DNA combined with vector DNA), the method also will
yield cells carrying recombinant DNA with alternate DNA combinations (i.e. plasmid DNA
combining with another plasmid DNA molecule or target DNA attached to more target DNA).
The mixture is referred to as a genomic library and must be screened to select the appropriate
clone. If random fragments of DNA were originally used (instead of isolation of the appropriate
target DNA genes), the process is referred to as shotgun cloning and can yield thousands or
tens of thousands of clones to be screened.

Introducing recombinant DNA into cells other than bacteria
Agrobacterium tumefaciens and the Ti plasmid

Tumor-Inducing Plasmid.
Agrobacterium tumefaciens is a plant pathogen that causes tumor formation called crown gall disease.
The bacterium contains a plasmid known as the Ti (tumor inducing) plasmid, which inserts bacterial
DNA into the host plant genome. Scientists utilize this natural process to do genetic engineering of
plants by inserting foreign DNA into the Ti plasmid and removing the genes necessary for disease,
allowing for the production of transgenic plants.

Gene gun
A gene gun uses very small metal particles (microprojectiles) coated with the recombinant DNA,
which are blasted at plant or animal tissue at a high velocity. If the DNA is transformed or taken up by
the cell’s DNA, the genes are expressed.

Viral vectors
For a viral vector, virulence genes from a virus can be removed and foreign DNA inserted, allowing the
virus capsid to be used as a mechanism for shuttling genetic material into a plant or animal cell. Marker
genes are typically added that allow for identification of the cells that took up the genes.

DNA techniques
Gel Electrophoresis
Gel electrophoresis is a technique commonly used to separate nucleic acid fragments based on size. It
can be used to identify particular fragments or to verify that a technique was successful.
A porous gel is prepared made of agarose, with the concentration adjusted based on expected size.
Nucleic acid samples are deposited into wells in the gel and an electrical current is applied. Nucleic acid,
with its negative charge, will move towards the positive electrode, which should be placed at the bottom
of the gel. The nucleic acid will move through the gel, with the smallest pieces encountering the least
resistance and thus moving through the fastest. The length of passage of each nucleic acid fragment can
be compared to a DNA ladder, with fragments of known size.

Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR)
The polymerase chain reaction or PCR is a method used to copy or amplify DNA in vitro. The process
can yield a billionfold copies of a single gene within a short period of time. The template DNA is mixed
with all the ingredients necessary to make DNA copies: primers (small oligonucleotides that flank the
gene or genes of interest by recognizing sequences on either side of it), nucleotides (the building blocks
of DNA), and DNA polymerase. The steps involve heating the template DNA in order to denature or
separate the strands, dropping the temperature to allow the primers to anneal, and then heating the
mixture up to allow the DNA polymerase to extend the primers, using the original DNA as an initial
template. The cycle is repeated 20-30 times, exponentially increasing the amount of target DNA in a few
hours.

Uses of Genetically Engineered Organisms
There can be numerous reasons to create a genetically modified organism (GMO) or transgenic
organism, defined as a genetically modified organism that contains a gene from a different organism.
Typically the hope is that the GMO will provide needed information or a product of value to society.

Source of DNA
Genetically engineered organisms can be made so that a piece of DNA can be easily replicated,
providing a large source of that DNA. For example, a gene associated with breast cancer can be spliced
into the genome of E. coli, allowing for the rapid production of the gene so that it may be sequenced,
studied, and manipulated, without requiring repeated tissue donations from human volunteers.

Source of RNA
Antisense RNA is ssRNA that is complementary to the mRNA that will code for a protein. In cells it is
made as a way to control target genes. There has been increasing interest in the use of antisense RNA as
a way to prevent diseases that are caused by the production of a particular protein.

Source of Protein
Since microbes replicate so rapidly, it can be extremely advantageous to use them to manufacture
proteins of interest or value. Given the right promoters, bacteria will express genes for proteins that are
not naturally found in bacteria, such as cytokine. Genetically engineered cells have been used to make a
wide variety of proteins of use to humans, such as insulin or human growth hormone.

Genomics
Genomics is a field that studies the entire collection of an organism’s DNA or genome. It involves
sequencing, analyzing, and comparing the information contained within genomes. Since sequencing has
become much less expensive and more efficient, vast amounts of genomic information is now available
about a wide variety of organisms, but particularly microbes, with their smaller genome size. In fact, the
biggest bottleneck currently is not the lack of information but the lack of computing power to process
the information!

Sequencing
Sequencing, or determining the base order of an organism’s DNA or RNA, is often one of the first steps
to finding out detailed information about an organism. A bacterial genome can range from 130 kilobase
pairs (kbp) to over 14 Megabase pairs (Mbp), while a viral genome ranges from 0.859 to 2473 kbp. For
comparison, the human genome contains about 3 billion base pairs.

Shotgun sequencing
Shotgun sequencing initially involves construction of a genomic library, where the genome is broken
into randomly sized fragments that are inserted into vectors to produce a library of clones. The
fragments are sequenced and then analyzed by a computer, which searches for overlapping regions to
form a longer stretch of sequence. Eventually all the sequences are aligned to give the complete genome
sequence. Errors are reduced because many of the clones contain identical or near identical sequences,
resulting in good “coverage” of the genome.

Commons

Second generation DNA sequencing
Second-generation DNA sequencing uses massively parallel methods, where multiple samples are
sequenced side-by-side. DNA fragments of a few hundred bases each are amplified by PCR and then
attached to small bead, so that each bead carries several copies of the same section of DNA. The beads
are put into a plate containing more than a million wells, each with one bead, and the DNA fragments
are sequenced.

Third- and fourth-generation DNA sequencing
Third-generation DNA sequencing involves the sequencing of single molecules of DNA. Fourthgeneration DNA sequencing, also known as “post light sequencing,” utilizes methods other than optical
detection for sequencing.

Bioinformatics
After sequencing, it is time to make sense of the information. The field of bioinformatics combines
many fields together (i.e. biology, computer science, statistics) to use the power of computers to analyze
information contained in the genomic sequence. Locating specific genes within a genome is referred to
as genome annotation.

Open Reading Frames (ORFS)
An open reading frame or ORF denotes a possible protein-coding gene. For double-stranded DNA,
there are six reading frames to be analyzed, since the DNA is read in sets of three bases at a time and
there are two strands of DNA. An ORF typically has at least 100 codons before a stop codon, with 3’
terminator sequences. A functional ORF is one that is actually used by the organism to encode a
protein. Computers are used to search the DNA sequence looking for ORFs, with those presumed to
encode protein further analyzed by a bioinformaticist.
It is often helpful for the sequence to be compared against a database of sequences coding for known
proteins. GenBank is a database of over 200 billion base pairs of sequences that scientists can access, to
try and find matches to the sequence of interest. The database search tool BLAST (basic local
alignment search tool) has programs for comparing both nucleotide sequences and amino acid
sequences, providing a ranking of results in order of decreasing similarity.

BLAST Results.

Comparative Genomics
Once the sequences of organisms have been obtained, meaningful information can be gathered using
comparative genomics. For this genomes are assessed for information regarding size, organization, and
gene content.
Comparison of the genome of microbial strains has given scientists a better picture regarding the genes
that organisms pick up. A group of multiple strains share a core genome, genes coding for essential
cellular functions that they all have in common. The pan genome represents all the genes found in all
the members of species, so provides a good idea of the diversity of a group. Most of these “extra” genes
are probably picked up by horizontal gene transfer.
Comparative genomics also shows that many genes are derived as a result of gene duplication. Genes
within a single organism that likely came about because of gene duplication are referred to as paralogs.
In many cases one of the genes might be altered to take on a new function. It is also possible for gene
duplication to be found in different organisms, as a result of acquiring the original gene from a common
ancestor. These genes are called orthologs.

Functional Genomics
The sequence of a genome and the location of genes provide part of the picture, but in order to fully
understand an organism we need an idea of what the cell is doing with its genes. In other words, what
happens when the genes are expressed? This is where functional genomics comes in – placing the
genomic information in context.

The first step in gene expression is transcription or the manufacture of RNA. Transcriptome refers to
the entire complement of RNA that a cell can make from its genome, while proteome refers to all the
proteins encoded by an organisms’ genome, in the final step of gene expression.

Microarrays
Microarrays or gene chips are solid supports upon which multiple spots of DNA are placed, in a gridlike fashion. Each spot of DNA represents a single gene or ORF. Known fragments of nucleic acid are
labeled and used as probes, with a signal produced if binding occurs. Microarrays can be used to
determine what genes might be turned on or off under particular conditions, such as comparing the
growth of a bacterial pathogen inside the host versus outside of the host.

Proteomics
The study of the proteins of an organism (or the proteome) is referred to as proteomics. Much of the
interest focuses on functional proteomics, which examines the functions of the cellular proteins and the
ways in which they interact with one another.
One common technique used in the study of proteins is two-dimensional gel electrophoresis, which
first separates proteins based on their isoelectric points. This is accomplished by using a pH gradient,
which separates the proteins based on their amino acid content. The separated proteins are then run
through a polyacrylamide gel, providing the second dimension as proteins are separated by size.
Structural proteomics focuses on the three-dimensional structure of proteins, which is often
determined by protein modeling, using computer algorithms to predict the most likely folding of the
protein based on amino acid information and known protein patterns.

Metabolomics
Metabolomics strives to identify the complete set of metabolic intermediates produced by an organism.
This can be extremely complicated, since many metabolites are used by cells in multiple pathways.

Metagenomics
Metagenomics or environmental genomics refers to the extraction of pooled DNA directly from a
specific environment, without the initial isolation and identification of organisms within that
environment. Since many microbial species are difficult to culture in the laboratory, studying the
metagenome of an environment allows scientists to consider all organisms that might be present. Taxa
can even be identified in the absence of organism isolation using nucleic acid sequences alone, where
the taxon is known as phylotype.

Microbial Symbioses
Symbiosis, strictly defined, refers to an intimate relationship between two organisms. Although many
people use the term to describe a relationship beneficial to both participants, the term itself is not that
specific. The relationship could be good, bad, or neutral for either partner. A mutualistic relationship is
one in which both partners benefit, while a commensalistic relationship benefits one partner but not the
other. In a pathogenic relationship, one partner benefits at the expense of the other. This chapter looks
at a few examples of symbiosis, where microbes are one of the partners.

The Human Microbiome
The human microbiome describes the genes associated with all the microbes that live in and on a
human. All 10^14 of them! The microbes are mostly bacteria but can include archaea, fungi, and
eukartyotic microbes The locations include skin, upper respiratory tract, stomach, intestines, and
urogenital tracts. Colonization occurs soon after birth, as infants acquire microbes from people, surfaces
and objects that they come in contact with.

Gut microbes and human metabolism
Most of the microbes associated with the human body are found in the gut, particularly about 1-4 hours
after eating a meal when the microbial population dramatically increases. The gut microbiota is
extremely diverse and it has been estimated that from 500-1000 species of bacteria live in the human
gastrointestinal tract (typically described as from 5-8 pounds of bacteria!).
The gut microbes are essential for host digestion and nutrition, aiding in digestion by breaking down
carbohydrates that humans could not break down on their own, by liberating short chain fatty acids from
indigestible dietary fibers. In addition, they produce vitamins such as biotin and vitamin K.

Gut microbes and obesity
There has been increased interest in the microbial gut population, due to the possibility that it might play
a role in obesity. Although currently hypothetical, research has shown that obese mice have a microbial
gut community that differs from the microbes found in the gut of non-obese mice, with more Firmicutes
bacteria and methanogenic Archaea. It has been suggested that these microbes are more efficient at
absorbing nutrients.

Human microbiome and disease
It has been shown that microbiota changes are associated with diseased states or dysbiosis. Preliminary
research has shown that the microbiota might be associated rheumatoid arthritis, colorectal cancer,
diabetes, in addition to obesity.

Research
The Human Microbiome Project (HMP) was an international research program based in the U.S. that
was focused on the functions of gut microbiota. Some 200 researchers used advanced DNA-sequencing
techniques to determine what microbes are present and in what populations.
Many current research projects are focused on determining the role of the human microbiome in both
health and the diseased state. There is no doubt that our knowledge will continue to grow as we find out
more about the vast populations of microbes that live in and on us.

Biofilms
Biofilms are a complex aggregation of cells that are encased within an excellular matrix and attached to
a surface. Bioforms can form on just about any surface and are common in nature and industry, being
found on the surfaces of rocks, caves, pipes, boat hulls, cooking vessels, and medical implants, just to
name a few. They have also been around a long time, since the fossil record shows evidence for biofilms
going back 3.4 billion years!
The microbial community of a biofilm can be composed of one or two species but more commonly
contains many different species of bacteria, each influencing the others gene expression and growth.

Biofilm development
The basic steps for biofilm formation can be broken down into four steps:
1. Cell disposition and attachment – in order for biofilm development to occur, free-floating or
planktonic cells must collide with a suitable surface. Typically the surface has been
preconditioned with the deposits of environmental proteins and other molecules.
2. Colonization – cell-to-cell signaling occurs, leading to the expression of biofilm specific genes.
These genes are associated with the communal production of extracellular polymeric DNA
released by some cells can be taken up by others, stimulating the expression of new genes.
3. Maturation – the EPS matrix fully encases all the cells, as the biofilm continues to thicken and

grow, forming a complex, dynamic community. Water channels form throughout the structure.
4. Detachment and sloughing – individual cells or pieces of the biofilm are released to the
environment, as a form of active dispersal. This release can be trigger by environmental factors,
such as the concentration of nutrients or oxygen.

Cellular advantages of biofilms
Why do bioforms develop? There are certain advantages that cells enjoy while in a biofilm, over their
planktonic growth. Perhaps most importantly, biofilms offer cells increased protection from harmful
conditions or substances, such as UV light, physical agitation, antimicrobial agents, and phagocytosis. It
has been shown that bacteria within a biofilm are up to a thousand times more resistant to antibiotics
than free-floating cells!
A biofilm also allows a cell population to “put down roots,” so to speak, so that they can stay in close
proximity to a nutrient-rich area. For example, a biofilm that develops on a conduit pipe at a dairy plant
will have continual access to fresh food, which is much better than being swept away with the final
product.
Lastly, biofilms allow for cells to grow in microbial populations, where they can easily benefit from
cell-to-cell communication and genetic exchange.

Biofilm impacts
Biofilms have huge impacts throughout many different types of industry. Medical implants ranging from
catheters to artificial joints are particularly susceptible to biofilm formation, leading to huge problems
for the medical industry. Biofilms are responsible for many chronic infections, due to their increased
resistance to antimicrobial compounds and antibiotics. A type of biofilm that affects almost everyone is
the formation of dental plaque, which can lead to cavity formation.
Outside of medicine, biofilms affect just about any industry relying on pipes to convey water, food, oil,
or other liquids, where their resistance makes its particularly difficult to completely eliminate the
biofilm.

Quorum Sensing
The word quorum refers to having a minimum number of members needed for an organization to
conduct business, such as hold a vote. Quorum sensing refers to the ability of some bacteria to
communicate in a density-dependent fashion, allowing them to delay the activation of specific genes
until it is the most advantageous for the population.
Quorum sensing involves cell-to-cell communication, using small diffusible substances known as
autoinducers. An autoinducer is produced by a cell, diffusing across the plasma membrane to be
released into the environment. As the cell population increases in the environment the concentration of
autoinducer increases as well, causing the molecule to diffuse back into individual cells where it triggers
the activation of specific genes.

Quorum sensing in Bioluminescent Bacteria.

Quorum sensing example
One of the best studied examples of quorum sensing is the mutualistic relationship between the
bioluminescent bacterium Aliivibrio fischeri and the bobtail squid. The bobtail squid actually has a light
organ that evolved to house the bacterium, relying on its luminescence to provide a camouflage effect
against predators. At low cell density the luminescence would not provide the desired effect,
representing a waste in energy by the bacterial population. Therefore, quorum sensing is used so that the
lux gene that codes for the luciferase enzyme necessary for luminescence is only activated when the
bacterial population is at sufficient density.

Bacterial Pathogenicity
A microbe that is capable of causing disease is referred to as a pathogen, while the organism being
infected is called a host. The ability to cause disease is referred to as pathogenicity, with pathogens
varying in their ability. An opportunistic pathogen is a microbe that typically infects a host that is
compromised in some way, either by a weakened immune system or breach to the body’s natural
defenses, such as a wound. The measurement of pathogenicity is called virulence, with highly virulent
pathogens being more likely to cause disease in a host.
It is important to remember that there are many variables to take into account in a host-pathogen
interaction, which is a dynamic relationship that is constantly changing. The virulence of the pathogen is
important, but so is the number of microbes that gained entry to the host, the location of entry, the
overall health of the host, and the state of the host’s defenses. Exposure to a pathogen does not ensure
that disease will occur, since a host might be able to fight off the infection before disease signs/
symptoms develop.

Host-Pathogen Interactions.

Pathogen Transmission
An infection starts with exposure to a pathogen. The natural site or home for a pathogen is known as a
reservoir and can either be animate (human or animal) or inanimate (water, soil, food). A pathogen can
be picked up from its reservoir and then spread from one infected host to another. Carriers play an
important role in the spread of disease, since they carry the pathogen but show no obvious symptoms of
disease. A disease that primarily occurs within animal populations but can be spread to humans is called
a zoonosis, while a hospital-acquired infection is known as a nosocomial infection.
The mechanism by which a pathogen is picked up by a host is referred to as mode of transmission, with
the main mechanisms listed below:

Direct contact
Direct contact includes host-to-host contact, such as through kissing or sexual intercourse, where one
person might come in contact with another person’s skin or body fluids. An expectant mother may
transmit a pathogen to her infant by vertical contact while pregnant, or during the act of giving birth.

Droplet transmission
Droplet transmission is often considered to be a form of direct contact as well. It involves transmission
by respiratory droplets, where an infected host expels the pathogen in tiny droplets by coughing or
sneezing, which are then inhaled by a host nearby. These droplets are not transmitted through the air
over long distances, nor do they remain infectious for very long.

Indirect contact
Indirect contact involves the transfer of the infectious agent through some type of intermediary, such as
a contaminated object or person. The pathogen might be deposited on an inanimate object, called a
fomite, which is then used by another person. This could include a shared toy or commonly-touched
surface, like a doorknob or computer keyboard. Alternatively, a healthcare worked might transmit a
pathogen from one patient to another, if they did not change their gloves between patients.

Airborne transmission
Airborne transmission occurs due to pathogens that are in small particles or droplets in the
environment, which can remain infectious over time and distance. An example might be fungal spores
that are inhaled during a dust storm.

Fecal-oral transmission
Fecal-oral transmission occurs when an infected host is shedding the pathogen in their feces which
contaminate food or water that is consumed by the next host.

Vectorborne transmission

Pathogen Transmission.
Vectorborne transmission occurs when an arthropod vector, such as mosquitoes, flies, ticks, are
involves in the transmission. Sometimes the vector just picks up the infectious agents on their external
body parts and carries it to another host, but typically the vector picks up the infectious agent when
biting an infected host. The agent is picked up in the blood, and then spread to the next host when the
vector moves on to bite someone else.

Virulence Factors
In order for a bacterium to be virulent, it must have capabilities that allow it to infect a host. These
capabilities arise from physical structures that the bacterium has or chemical substances that the
bacterium can produce. Collectively the characteristics that contribute to virulence are called virulence
factors.
The genes that code for virulence factors are commonly found clustered on the pathogen’s chromosome
or plasmid DNA, called pathogenicity islands. These pathogenicity islands can be distinguished by a
G+C content that differs from the rest of the genome and the presence of insertion-like sequences
flanking the gene cluster. Pathogenicity islands facilitate the sharing of virulence factors between
bacteria due to horizontal gene transfer, leading to the development of new pathogens over time.
Often the genes for virulence factors are controlled by quorum sensing, to ensure gene activation when
the pathogen population is at an optimal density. Triggering the genes too soon could alert the host’s
immune system to the invader, cutting short the bacterial infection.

Adherence and Colonization
Bacterial pathogens must be able to grab onto host cells or tissue, and resist removal by physical means
(such as sneezing) or mechanical means (such as movement of the cilated cells that line our airway).
Adherence can involve polysaccharide layers made by the bacteria, such as a capsule or slime layer,
which provide adhesion to host cells as well as resistance from phagocytosis. Adherence can also be
accomplished by physical structures such as a pilus or flagellum.
Once cells are successfully adhering to a surface, they increase in number, utilizing resources available
at the site. This colonization is important for pathogen survival and invasion to other sites, which will
yield increased nutrients and space for the growing population.

Invasion
Invasion refers to the ability of the pathogen to spread to other locations in the host, by invading host
cells or tissue. It is typically at this point when disease or obvious signs/symptoms of illness will occur.
While physical structures can still play a role in invasion, most bacterial pathogens produce a wide array
of chemicals, specifically enzymes that effect the host’s cells and tissue. Enzymes such as collagenase,
which allows the pathogen to spread by breaking down the collagen found in connective tissue. Or
leukocidins, which destroy the host’s white blood cells, decreasing resistance. Hemolysins lyse the
host’s red blood cells, releasing iron, a growth-limiting factor for bacteria.
Bacteria in the bloodstream, a condition known as bacteremia, can quickly spread to locations
throughout the host. This can result in a massive, systemic infection known as septicemia, which can
result in septic shock and death, as the host becomes overwhelmed by the bacterial pathogen and its
products.

Toxins
Toxins are a very specific virulence factor produced by some bacterial pathogens, in the form of
substances that are poisonous to the host. Toxigenicity refers to an organism’s ability to make toxins.
For bacteria, there are two categories of toxins, the exotoxins and the endotoxins.

Exotoxins
Exotoxins are heat-sensitive soluble proteins that are released into the surrounding environment by a
living organism. These incredibly potent substances can spread throughout the host’s body, causing
damage distant from the original site of infection. Exotoxins are associated with specific diseases, with
the toxin genes often carried on plasmids or by prophages. There are many different bacteria that
produce exotoxins, causing diseases such as botulism, tetanus, and diphtheria. There are three categories
of exotoxins:
1. Type I: cell surface-active – these toxins bind to cell receptors and stimulate cell responses.
One example is superantigen, that stimulates the host’s T cells, an important component of the
immune system. The stimulated T cells produce an excessive amount of the signaling molecule
cytokine, causing massive inflammation and tissue damage.
2. Type II: membrane-damaging – these toxins exert their effect on the host cell membrane,
often by forming pores in the membrane of the target cell. This can lead to cell lysis as
cytoplasmic contents rush out and water rushes in, disrupting the osmotic balance of the cell.
3. Type III: intracellular – these toxins gain access to a particular host cell and stimulate a
reaction within the target cell. One example is the AB-toxin – these toxins are composed of two
subunits, an A portion and a B portion. The B subunit is the binding portion of the toxin,
responsible for recognizing and binding to the correct cell type. The A subunit is the portion
with enzymatic activity. Once delivered into the correct cell by the B subunit, the A subunit
enacts some mechanism on the cell, leading to decreased cell function and/or cell death. An
example is the tetanus toxin produced by the bacterium Clostridrium tetani. Once delivered to a
neuron, the A subunit will cleave the cellular synaptobreven, resulting in a decrease in
neurotransmitter release. This results in spastic paralysis of the host. Each AB-toxin is
associated with a different disease.

AB-toxin: Host Cell Binding.

Endotoxins
Endotoxins are made by gram negative bacteria, as a component of the outer membrane of their cell
wall. The outer membrane contains lipopolysaccharide or LPS, with the toxic component being the lipid
part known as lipid A. Lipid A is heat-stable and is only released when the bacterial cell is lysed. The
effect on the host is the same, regardless of what bacterium made the lipid A – fever, diarrhea,
weakness, and blood coagulation. A massive release of endotoxin in a host can cause endotoxin shock,
which can be deadly.

The Viruses

Viral Classification
Since viruses lack ribosomes (and thus rRNA), they cannot be classified within the Three Domain
Classification scheme with cellular organisms. Alternatively, Dr. David Baltimore derived a viral
classification scheme, one that focuses on the relationship between a viral genome to how it produces its
mRNA. The Baltimore Scheme recognizes seven classes of viruses.

DNA viruses
Class I: dsDNA
DNA viruses with a dsDNA genome, like bacteriophages T4 and lambda, have a genome exactly the
same as the host cell that they are infecting. For this reason, many host enzymes can be utilized for

replication and/or protein production. The flow of information follows a conventional pathway: dsDNA
→ mRNA → protein, with a DNA-dependent RNA-polymerase producing the mRNA and the host
ribosome producing the protein. The genome replication, dsDNA → dsDNA, requires a DNAdependent DNA-polymerase from either the virus or the host cell.

dsDNA.
The virus often employs strategies for control of gene expression, to insure that particular viral products
are made at specific times in the virus replication. In the case of T4, the host RNA polymerase binds to
the viral DNA and begins transcribing early genes immediately after the DNA is injected into the cell.

One of the early viral proteins modifies the host RNA polymerase so that it will no longer recognize host
promoters at all, in addition to moving on to transcribe genes for middle-stage viral proteins. A further
modification (catalyzed by middle-stage viral proteins) further modified the RNA polymerase so it will
recognize viral genes coding for late-stage proteins. This insures an orderly production of viral proteins.
The replication of several dsDNA viruses results in the production of concatemers, where several viral
genomes are linked together due to short single-stranded regions with terminal repeats. As the genome is
packaged into the capsid a viral endonuclease cuts the concatemer to an appropriate length.
There are several animal viruses with dsDNA genomes, such as the pox viruses and the adenoviruses.
The herpesviruses have several notable features, such as the link of several members with cancer and the
ability of the viruses to remain in a latent form within their host. A productive infection results in an
explosive viral population, cell death, and development of disease signs, during which neurons are
infected. A latent infection develops in the neurons, allowing the virus to remain undetected in the host.
If the viral genome is reactivated, a productive infection results, leading to viral replication and disease
signs again.

Class II: ssDNA
The flow of information for ssDNA viruses, such as the parvoviruses, will still follow the conventional
pathway, to a certain extent: DNA → mRNA → protein. But the viral genome can either have the same
base sequence as the mRNA (plus-strand DNA) or be complementary to the mRNA (minus-strand
DNA). In the former case, a DNA strand that is complementary to the viral genome must be
manufactured first, forming a double-stranded replicative form (RF). This can be used to both
manufacture viral proteins and as a template for viral genome copies. For the minus-strand DNA
viruses, the genome can be used directly to produce mRNA but a complementary copy will still need to
be made, to serve as a template for viral genome copies.

ssDNA.
The replicative form can be used for rolling-circle replication, where one strand is nicked and
replication enzymes are used to extend the free 3’ end. As a complementary strand is synthesized around
the circular DNA, the 5’ end is peeled off, leading to a displaced strand that continues to grow in length.

Rolling-Circle Replication.

Class VII: DNA viruses that use reverse transcriptase
The hepadnaviruses contain a DNA genome that is partially double-stranded, but contains a singlestranded region. After gaining entrance into the cell’s nucleus, host cell enzymes are used to fill in the
gap with complementary bases to form a dsDNA closed loop. Gene transcription yields a plus-strand
RNA known as the pregenome, as well as the viral enzyme reverse transcriptase, an RNA-dependent
DNA-polymerase. The pregenome is used as a template for the reverse transcriptase to produced minusstrand DNA genomes, with a small piece of pregenome used as a primer to produce the double-stranded
region of the genomes.

RNA viruses
Class III: dsRNA
Double-stranded RNA viruses infect bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals, such as the rotavirus that
causes diarrheal illness in humans. But cells do not utilize dsRNA in any of their processes and have
systems in place to destroy any dsRNA found in the cell. Thus the viral genome, in its dsRNA form,
must be hidden or protected from the cell enzymes. Cells also lack RNA-dependent RNApolymerases, necessary for replication of the viral genome so the virus must provide this enzyme itself.
The viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase acts as both a transcriptase to transcribe mRNA, as well as

a replicase to replicate the RNA genome.

dsRNA.
For the rotavirus, the viral nucleocapsid remains intact in the cytoplasm with replication events
occurring inside, allowing the dsRNA to remain protected. Messenger RNA is transcribed from the
minus-strand of the RNA genome and then translated by the host ribosome in the cytoplasm. Viral
proteins aggregate to form new nucleocapsids around RNA replicase and plus-strand RNA. The minusstrand RNA is then synthesized by the RNA replicase within the nucleocapsid, once again insuring
protection of the dsRNA genome.

Class IV: +ssRNA
Viruses with plus-strand RNA, such as poliovirus, can use their genome directly as mRNA with
translation by the host ribosome occurring as soon as the unsegmented viral genome gains entry into the
cell. One of the viral genes expressed yields an RNA-dependent RNA-polymerase (or RNA replicase),
which creates minus-strand RNA from the plus-strand genome. The minus-strand RNA can be used as a
template for more plus-strand RNA, which can be used as mRNA or as genomes for the newly forming
viruses.

Translation of the poliovirus genome yields a polyprotein, a large protein with protease activity that
cleaves itself into three smaller proteins. Additional cleavage activity eventually yields all the proteins
needed for capsid formation, as well as an RNA-dependent RNA-polymerase.
The formation of a polyprotein that is cut into several smaller proteins illustrates one possible strategy to
an issue faced by many +ssRNA viruses – how to generate multiple proteins from an unsegmented
+ssRNA genome? Other possibilities include:

subgenomic mRNA – during translation, portions of the viral RNA may be skipped, resulting
in different proteins than what is made from the viral RNA in its entirety.
ribosomal frame-shifting – the ribosome “reads” the mRNA in groups of three nucleotides or
codon, which translate to one amino acid. If the ribosome starts with nucleotide #1, that is one
open reading frame (ORF), resulting in one set of amino acids. If the ribosome were to move
forward where nucleotide 2 is the starting nucleotide that would be ORF #2, resulting in a
completely different set of amino acids. If the ribosome were to move forward again where
nucleotide 3 is the starting nucleotide that would be ORF#3, resulting in an entirely different set
of amino acids. Some viruses have viral genes that deliberately overlap within different ORFs,
leading to the production of different proteins from a single mRNA.
readthrough mechanism – a viral genome can have stop codons embedded throughout the
sequence. When the ribosome comes to a stop codon it can either stop, ending the amino acid
sequence, or it can ignore the stop codon, continuing on to make a longer string of amino acids.
For viruses with the readthrough mechanism, they acquire a variety of proteins by having stop
codons that are periodically ignored. Sometimes this function is combined with the ribosomal
frame-shifting to produce an even greater variety of viral proteins.

Class V: -ssRNA
Minus-strand RNA viruses include many members notable for humans, such as influenza virus, rabies
virus, and Ebola virus. Since the genome of minus-strand RNA viruses cannot be used directly as
mRNA, the virus must carry an RNA-dependent RNA-polymerase within its capsid. Upon entrance into
the host cell, the plus-strand RNAs generated by the polymerase are used as mRNA for protein
production. When viral genomes are needed the plus-strand RNAs are used as templates to make minusstrand RNA.

-ssRNA.
Class VI: +ssRNA, retroviruses
Despite the fact that the retroviral genome is composed of +ssRNA, it is not used as mRNA. Instead, the
virus uses its reverse transcriptase to synthesize a piece of ssDNA complementary to the viral genome.
The reverse transcriptase also possesses ribonuclease activity, which is used to degrade the RNA strand
of the RNA-DNA hybrid. Lastly, the reverse transcriptase is used as a DNA polymerase to make a
complementary copy to the ssDNA, yielding a dsDNA molecule. This allows the virus to insert its
genome, in a dsDNA form, into the host chromosome, forming a provirus. Unlike a prophage, a
provirus can remain latent indefinitely or cause the expression of viral genes, leading to the production
of new viruses. Excision of the provirus does not occur for gene expression.

+ssRNA, retroviruses.

Other infectious agents
Viroids
Viroids are small, circular ssRNA molecules that lack protein. These infectious molecules are
associated with a number of plant diseases. Since ssRNA is highly susceptible to enzymatic degradation,
the viroid RNA has extensive complementary base pairing, causing the viroid to take on a hairpin
configuration that is resistant to enzymes. For replication viroids rely on a plant RNA polymerase with
RNA replicase activity.

Prions
Prions are infectious agents that completely lack nucleic acid of any kind, being made entirely of
protein. They are associated with a variety of diseases, primarily in animals, although a prion has been
found that infects yeast (!). Diseases include bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE or “mad cow
disease”), Creutzfeld-Jakob disease in humans, and scrapie in sheep.
The prion protein is found in the neurons of healthy animals (PrPC or Prion Protein Cellular), with a
particular secondary structure. The pathogenic form (PrPSC or Prion Protein Scrapie) has a different
secondary structure and is capable of converting the PrPC into the pathogenic form. Accumulation of the
pathogenic form causes destruction of brain and nervous tissue, leading to disease symptoms such as

memory loss, lack of coordination, and eventually death.

Essential Questions/Objectives
1. What is the Baltimore system of classification? What viral characteristics does it use?How does
each viral group make proteins and replicate their genome? Where do the necessary components
come from? (virus or host cell) What modifications are necessary, for viruses with a genome
different from the host cell?
2. What strategy do dsDNA viruses use for control of gene expression? What are concatemers?
What are productive and latent infections?
3. What is a replicative form? What is rolling circle replication? What is the advantage of these
viral mechanisms?

4. What is a pregenome? What is reverse transcriptase? What role does it play for the Class VII
viruses?
5. What issues do dsRNA viruses face? How do they overcome these issues? What is a
transcriptase? What is a replicase?
6. How is the genome used by Class IV +ssRNA viruses? What are the strategies used by these
viruses to generate multiple proteins from an unsegmented genome?
7. What steps are necessary for the –ssRNA viruses?
8. How do the retroviruses, as +ssRNA viruses, differ from the Class IV viruses? What is a
ribonuclease? What is a provirus?
9. What is a viroid? What is a prion? How do these agents cause disease? How do they replicate?
Exploratory Questions (OPTIONAL)
1. Why were scientists initially so resistant to the idea of prions lacking any type of nucleic acid?
