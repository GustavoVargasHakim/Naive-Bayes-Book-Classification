Preface to the Sixth Edition
PREFACE TO THE SIXTH EDITION

uring the four years since publication of the Fifth Edition of Gene Cloning and DNA
D
Analysis: An Introduction there have been important advances in DNA sequencing
technology, in particular the widespread adoption of high throughput approaches based
on pyrosequencing. Inclusion of these new techniques in the Sixth Edition has prompted
me to completely rewrite the material on DNA sequencing and to place all the relevant
information—both on the methodology itself and its application to genome sequencing
—into a single chapter. This has enabled me to devote another entire chapter to the
post-sequencing methods used to study genomes. The result is, I hope, a more balanced
treatment of the various aspects of genomics and post-genomics than I had managed in
previous editions.
A second important development of the last few years has been the introduction of
real-time PCR as a means of quantifying the amount of a particular DNA sequence present in a preparation. This technique is now described as part of Chapter 9. Elsewhere,
I have made various additions, such as inclusion of topoisomerase-based methods for
blunt end ligation in Chapter 4, and generally tidied up parts of chapters that had
become slightly unwieldy due to the cumulative effects of modifications made over the
25 years since the First Edition of this book. The Sixth Edition is almost twice as long
as the First, but retains the philosophy of that original edition. It is still an introductory
text that begins at the beginning and does not assume that the reader has any prior
knowledge of the techniques used to study genes and genomes.
I would like to thank Nigel Balmforth and Andy Slade at Wiley-Blackwell for helping me to make this new edition a reality. As always I must also thank my wife Keri for
the unending support that she has given to me in my decision to use up evenings and
weekends writing this and other books.

How to find you way through this book

In the middle of the 19th century, Gregor Mendel formulated a set of rules to explain
the inheritance of biological characteristics. The basic assumption of these rules is that
each heritable property of an organism is controlled by a factor, called a gene, that is a
physical particle present somewhere in the cell. The rediscovery of Mendel’s laws in
1900 marks the birth of genetics, the science aimed at understanding what these genes
are and exactly how they work.

1.1 The early development of genetics
For the first 30 years of its life this new science grew at an astonishing rate. The idea
that genes reside on chromosomes was proposed by W. Sutton in 1903, and received
experimental backing from T.H. Morgan in 1910. Morgan and his colleagues then
developed the techniques for gene mapping, and by 1922 had produced a comprehensive analysis of the relative positions of over 2000 genes on the 4 chromosomes of the
fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster.
Despite the brilliance of these classical genetic studies, there was no real understanding of the molecular nature of the gene until the 1940s. Indeed, it was not until

the experiments of Avery, MacLeod, and McCarty in 1944, and of Hershey and Chase
in 1952, that anyone believed that deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) is the genetic material:
up until then it was widely thought that genes were made of protein. The discovery
of the role of DNA was a tremendous stimulus to genetic research, and many famous
biologists (Delbrück, Chargaff, Crick, and Monod were among the most influential)
contributed to the second great age of genetics. In the 14 years between 1952 and 1966,
the structure of DNA was elucidated, the genetic code cracked, and the processes of
transcription and translation described.

1.2 The advent of gene cloning and the polymerase
chain reaction
These years of activity and discovery were followed by a lull, a period of anticlimax
when it seemed to some molecular biologists (as the new generation of geneticists styled
themselves) that there was little of fundamental importance that was not understood.
In truth there was a frustration that the experimental techniques of the late 1960s were
not sophisticated enough to allow the gene to be studied in any greater detail.
Then in the years 1971–1973 genetic research was thrown back into gear by what at
the time was described as a revolution in experimental biology. A whole new methodology was developed, enabling previously impossible experiments to be planned and
carried out, if not with ease, then at least with success. These methods, referred to as
recombinant DNA technology or genetic engineering, and having at their core the process of gene cloning, sparked another great age of genetics. They led to rapid and
efficient DNA sequencing techniques that enabled the structures of individual genes to
be determined, reaching a culmination at the turn of the century with the massive
genome sequencing projects, including the human project which was completed in 2000.
They led to procedures for studying the regulation of individual genes, which have
allowed molecular biologists to understand how aberrations in gene activity can result
in human diseases such as cancer. The techniques spawned modern biotechnology,
which puts genes to work in production of proteins and other compounds needed in
medicine and industrial processes.
During the 1980s, when the excitement engendered by the gene cloning revolution
was at its height, it hardly seemed possible that another, equally novel and equally
revolutionary process was just around the corner. According to DNA folklore, Kary
Mullis invented the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) during a drive along the coast
of California one evening in 1985. His brainwave was an exquisitely simple technique
that acts as a perfect complement to gene cloning. PCR has made easier many of the
techniques that were possible but difficult to carry out when gene cloning was used on
its own. It has extended the range of DNA analysis and enabled molecular biology to find
new applications in areas of endeavor outside of its traditional range of medicine, agriculture, and biotechnology. Archaeogenetics, molecular ecology, and DNA forensics
are just three of the new disciplines that have become possible as a direct consequence
of the invention of PCR, enabling molecular biologists to ask questions about human
evolution and the impact of environmental change on the biosphere, and to bring their
powerful tools to bear in the fight against crime. Forty years have passed since the dawning of the age of gene cloning, but we are still riding the rollercoaster and there is no
end to the excitement in sight.

1.3 What is gene cloning?
What exactly is gene cloning? The easiest way to answer this question is to follow
through the steps in a gene cloning experiment (Figure 1.1):
1 A fragment of DNA, containing the gene to be cloned, is inserted into a circular
DNA molecule called a vector, to produce a recombinant DNA molecule.
2 The vector transports the gene into a host cell, which is usually a bacterium,
although other types of living cell can be used.
3 Within the host cell the vector multiplies, producing numerous identical copies,
not only of itself but also of the gene that it carries.
4 When the host cell divides, copies of the recombinant DNA molecule are passed to
the progeny and further vector replication takes place.
5 After a large number of cell divisions, a colony, or clone, of identical host cells is
produced. Each cell in the clone contains one or more copies of the recombinant
DNA molecule; the gene carried by the recombinant molecule is now said to be
cloned.

1.4 What is PCR?
The polymerase chain reaction is very different from gene cloning. Rather than a series
of manipulations involving living cells, PCR is carried out in a single test tube simply by
mixing DNA with a set of reagents and placing the tube in a thermal cycler, a piece of
equipment that enables the mixture to be incubated at a series of temperatures that are
varied in a preprogrammed manner. The basic steps in a PCR experiment are as follows

1 The mixture is heated to 94°C, at which temperature the hydrogen bonds that
hold together the two strands of the double-stranded DNA molecule are broken,
causing the molecule to denature.
2 The mixture is cooled down to 50–60°C. The two strands of each molecule could
join back together at this temperature, but most do not because the mixture
contains a large excess of short DNA molecules, called oligonucleotides or primers,
which anneal to the DNA molecules at specific positions.
3 The temperature is raised to 74°C. This is a good working temperature for the
Taq DNA polymerase that is present in the mixture. We will learn more about
DNA polymerases on p. 48. All we need to understand at this stage is that the
Taq DNA polymerase attaches to one end of each primer and synthesizes new
strands of DNA, complementary to the template DNA molecules, during this step
of the PCR. Now we have four stands of DNA instead of the two that there were
to start with.
4 The temperature is increased back to 94°C. The double-stranded DNA
molecules, each of which consists of one strand of the original molecule and
one new strand of DNA, denature into single strands. This begins a second cycle
of denaturation–annealing–synthesis, at the end of which there are eight DNA
strands. By repeating the cycle 30 times the double-stranded molecule that we
began with is converted into over 130 million new double-stranded molecules,
each one a copy of the region of the starting molecule delineated by the annealing
sites of the two primers.

1.5 Why gene cloning and PCR are so important
As you can see from Figures 1.1 and 1.2, gene cloning and PCR are relatively straightforward procedures. Why, then, have they assumed such importance in biology? The
answer is largely because both techniques can provide a pure sample of an individual
gene, separated from all the other genes in the cell.

1.5.1 Obtaining a pure sample of a gene by cloning
To understand exactly how cloning can provide a pure sample of a gene, consider the
basic experiment from Figure 1.1, but drawn in a slightly different way (Figure 1.3).
In this example the DNA fragment to be cloned is one member of a mixture of many
different fragments, each carrying a different gene or part of a gene. This mixture could
indeed be the entire genetic complement of an organism—a human, for instance. Each
of these fragments becomes inserted into a different vector molecule to produce a
family of recombinant DNA molecules, one of which carries the gene of interest. Usually only one recombinant DNA molecule is transported into any single host cell, so
that although the final set of clones may contain many different recombinant DNA
molecules, each individual clone contains multiple copies of just one molecule. The gene
is now separated away from all the other genes in the original mixture, and its specific
features can be studied in detail.
In practice, the key to the success or failure of a gene cloning experiment is the ability to identify the particular clone of interest from the many different ones that are
obtained. If we consider the genome of the bacterium Escherichia coli, which contains

just over 4000 different genes, we might at first despair of being able to find just one
gene among all the possible clones (Figure 1.4). The problem becomes even more overwhelming when we remember that bacteria are relatively simple organisms and that the
human genome contains about five times as many genes. However, as explained in
Chapter 8, a variety of different strategies can be used to ensure that the correct gene
can be obtained at the end of the cloning experiment. Some of these strategies involve
modifications to the basic cloning procedure, so that only cells containing the desired
recombinant DNA molecule can divide and the clone of interest is automatically
selected. Other methods involve techniques that enable the desired clone to be identified
from a mixture of lots of different clones.
Once a gene has been cloned there is almost no limit to the information that can
be obtained about its structure and expression. The availability of cloned material has
stimulated the development of analytical methods for studying genes, with new techniques being introduced all the time. Methods for studying the structure and expression
of a cloned gene are described in Chapters 10 and 11, respectively.

How can we select or

1.5.2 PCR can also be used to purify a gene
The polymerase chain reaction can also be used to obtain a pure sample of a gene. This
is because the region of the starting DNA molecule that is copied during PCR is the
segment whose boundaries are marked by the annealing positions of the two oligonucleotide primers. If the primers anneal either side of the gene of interest, many copies
of that gene will be synthesized (Figure 1.5). The outcome is the same as with a gene
cloning experiment, although the problem of selection does not arise because the desired
gene is automatically “selected” as a result of the positions at which the primers anneal.
A PCR experiment can be completed in a few hours, whereas it takes weeks if not
months to obtain a gene by cloning. Why then is gene cloning still used? This is because
PCR has two limitations:
l

In order for the primers to anneal to the correct positions, either side of the gene
of interest, the sequences of these annealing sites must be known. It is easy to
synthesize a primer with a predetermined sequence (see p. 139), but if the
sequences of the annealing sites are unknown then the appropriate primers cannot
be made. This means that PCR cannot be used to isolate genes that have not been
studied before—that has to be done by cloning.

There is a limit to the length of DNA sequence that can be copied by PCR.
Five kilobases (kb) can be copied fairly easily, and segments up to forty kb can be
dealt with by using specialized techniques, but this is shorter than the lengths of
many genes, especially those of humans and other vertebrates. Cloning must be
used if an intact version of a long gene is required.

Gene cloning is therefore the only way of isolating long genes or those that have
never been studied before. But PCR still has many important applications. For example,
even if the sequence of a gene is not known, it may still be possible to determine the
appropriate sequences for a pair of primers, based on what is known about the sequence
of the equivalent gene in a different organism. A gene that has been isolated and
sequenced from, say, mouse could therefore be used to design a pair of primers for
isolation of the equivalent gene from humans.
In addition, there are many applications where it is necessary to isolate or detect
genes whose sequences are already known. A PCR of human globin genes, for example,
is used to test for the presence of mutations that might cause the blood disease called
thalassaemia. Design of appropriate primers for this PCR is easy because the sequences
of the human globin genes are known. After the PCR, the gene copies are sequenced or
studied in some other way to determine if any of the thalassaemia mutations are present.
Another clinical application of PCR involves the use of primers specific for the DNA
of a disease-causing virus. A positive result indicates that a sample contains the virus and
that the person who provided the sample should undergo treatment to prevent onset of
the disease. The polymerase chain reaction is tremendously sensitive: a carefully set up
reaction yields detectable amounts of DNA, even if there is just one DNA molecule in
the starting mixture. This means that the technique can detect viruses at the earliest
stages of an infection, increasing the chances of treatment being successful. This great
sensitivity means that PCR can also be used with DNA from forensic material such as
hairs and dried bloodstains or even from the bones of long-dead humans (Chapter 16).

Chapter 1 Why Gene Cloning and DNA Analysis are Important

1.6 How to find your way through this book
This book explains how gene cloning, PCR and other DNA analysis techniques
are carried out and describes the applications of these techniques in modern biology.
The applications are covered in the second and third parts of the book. Part II describes
how genes and genomes are studied and Part III gives accounts of the broader applications of gene cloning and PCR in biotechnology, medicine, agriculture, and forensic
science.
In Part I we deal with the basic principles. Most of the nine chapters are devoted to
gene cloning because this technique is more complicated than PCR. When you have
understood how cloning is carried out you will have understood many of the basic
principles of how DNA is analyzed. In Chapter 2 we look at the central component of
a gene cloning experiment—the vector—which transports the gene into the host cell and
is responsible for its replication. To act as a cloning vector a DNA molecule must be
capable of entering a host cell and, once inside, replicating to produce multiple copies
of itself. Two naturally occurring types of DNA molecule satisfy these requirements:
l

l

Plasmids, which are small circles of DNA found in bacteria and some
other organisms. Plasmids can replicate independently of the host cell
chromosome.
Virus chromosomes, in particular the chromosomes of bacteriophages, which are
viruses that specifically infect bacteria. During infection the bacteriophage DNA
molecule is injected into the host cell where it undergoes replication.

Chapter 3 describes how DNA is purified from living cells—both the DNA that
will be cloned and the vector DNA—and Chapter 4 covers the various techniques for
handling purified DNA molecules in the laboratory. There are many such techniques,
but two are particularly important in gene cloning. These are the ability to cut the
vector at a specific point and then to repair it in such a way that the gene is inserted
(see Figure 1.1). These and other DNA manipulations were developed as an offshoot of
basic research into DNA synthesis and modification in living cells, and most of the
manipulations make use of purified enzymes. The properties of these enzymes, and the
way they are used in DNA studies, are described in Chapter 4.
Once a recombinant DNA molecule has been constructed, it must be introduced into
the host cell so that replication can take place. Transport into the host cell makes use
of natural processes for uptake of plasmid and viral DNA molecules. These processes
and the ways they are utilized in gene cloning are described in Chapter 5, and the
most important types of cloning vector are introduced, and their uses examined, in
Chapters 6 and 7. To conclude the coverage of gene cloning, in Chapter 8 we investigate the problem of selection (see Figure 1.4), before returning in Chapter 9 to a more
detailed description of PCR and its related techniques.

CHAPTER CONTENTS
2.1 Plasmids
2.2 Bacteriophages

A DNA molecule needs to display several features to be able to act as a vector for
gene cloning. Most importantly it must be able to replicate within the host cell, so that
numerous copies of the recombinant DNA molecule can be produced and passed to the
daughter cells. A cloning vector also needs to be relatively small, ideally less than 10 kb
in size, as large molecules tend to break down during purification, and are also more
difficult to manipulate. Two kinds of DNA molecule that satisfy these criteria can be
found in bacterial cells: plasmids and bacteriophage chromosomes.

2.1 Plasmids
Plasmids are circular molecules of DNA that lead an independent existence in the
bacterial cell (Figure 2.1). Plasmids almost always carry one or more genes, and often
these genes are responsible for a useful characteristic displayed by the host bacterium.
For example, the ability to survive in normally toxic concentrations of antibiotics
such as chloramphenicol or ampicillin is often due to the presence in the bacterium of
a plasmid carrying antibiotic resistance genes. In the laboratory, antibiotic resistance is
often used as a selectable marker to ensure that bacteria in a culture contain a particular plasmid (Figure 2.2).
Most plasmids possess at least one DNA sequence that can act as an origin of replication, so they are able to multiply within the cell independently of the main bacterial

replicative enzymes in order to make copies of themselves, whereas some of the larger
ones carry genes that code for special enzymes that are specific for plasmid replication.
A few types of plasmid are also able to replicate by inserting themselves into the bacterial chromosome (Figure 2.3b). These integrative plasmids or episomes may be stably
maintained in this form through numerous cell divisions, but always at some stage exist
as independent elements.

2.1.1 Size and copy number
The size and copy number of a plasmid are particularly important as far as cloning is
concerned. We have already mentioned the relevance of plasmid size and stated that less
than 10 kb is desirable for a cloning vector. Plasmids range from about 1.0 kb for the
smallest to over 250 kb for the largest plasmids (Table 2.1), so only a few are useful for
cloning purposes. However, as we will see in Chapter 7, larger plasmids can be adapted
for cloning under some circumstances.
The copy number refers to the number of molecules of an individual plasmid that are
normally found in a single bacterial cell. The factors that control copy number are not
well understood. Some plasmids, especially the larger ones, are stringent and have a

Donor cell

Plasmid transfer by conjugation between bacterial
cells. The donor and recipient cells attach to each
other by a pilus, a hollow appendage present
on the surface of the donor cell. A copy of the
plasmid is then passed to the recipient cell.
Transfer is thought to occur through the pilus,
but this has not been proven and transfer by
some other means (e.g. directly across the
bacterial cell walls) remains a possibility.

low copy number of perhaps just one or two per cell; others, called relaxed plasmids,
are present in multiple copies of 50 or more per cell. Generally speaking, a useful
cloning vector needs to be present in the cell in multiple copies so that large quantities
of the recombinant DNA molecule can be obtained.

2.1.2 Conjugation and compatibility
Plasmids fall into two groups: conjugative and non-conjugative. Conjugative plasmids
are characterized by the ability to promote sexual conjugation between bacterial cells
(Figure 2.4), a process that can result in a conjugative plasmid spreading from one cell
to all the other cells in a bacterial culture. Conjugation and plasmid transfer are controlled by a set of transfer or tra genes, which are present on conjugative plasmids but
absent from the non-conjugative type. However, a non-conjugative plasmid may, under
some circumstances, be cotransferred along with a conjugative plasmid when both are
present in the same cell.
Several different kinds of plasmid may be found in a single cell, including more than
one different conjugative plasmid at any one time. In fact, cells of E. coli have been
known to contain up to seven different plasmids at once. To be able to coexist in the
same cell, different plasmids must be compatible. If two plasmids are incompatible then
one or the other will be rapidly lost from the cell. Different types of plasmid can therefore be assigned to different incompatibility groups on the basis of whether or not they
can coexist, and plasmids from a single incompatibility group are often related to each
other in various ways. The basis of incompatibility is not well understood, but events
during plasmid replication are thought to underlie the phenomenon.

2.1.3 Plasmid classification
The most useful classification of naturally occurring plasmids is based on the main characteristic coded by the plasmid genes. The five major types of plasmid according to this
classification are as follows:
l

Fertility or F plasmids carry only tra genes and have no characteristic beyond
the ability to promote conjugal transfer of plasmids. A well-known example is the
F plasmid of E. coli.

Chapter 2 Vectors for Gene Cloning: Plasmids and Bacteriophages

Resistance or R plasmids carry genes conferring on the host bacterium resistance
to one or more antibacterial agents, such as chloramphenicol, ampicillin, and
mercury. R plasmids are very important in clinical microbiology as their spread
through natural populations can have profound consequences in the treatment
of bacterial infections. An example is RP4, which is commonly found in
Pseudomonas, but also occurs in many other bacteria.
Col plasmids code for colicins, proteins that kill other bacteria. An example is
ColE1 of E. coli.
Degradative plasmids allow the host bacterium to metabolize unusual molecules
such as toluene and salicylic acid, an example being TOL of Pseudomonas putida.
Virulence plasmids confer pathogenicity on the host bacterium; these include the
Ti plasmids of Agrobacterium tumefaciens, which induce crown gall disease on
dicotyledonous plants.

2.1.4 Plasmids in organisms other than bacteria
Although plasmids are widespread in bacteria they are by no means as common in other
organisms. The best characterized eukaryotic plasmid is the 2 Fm circle that occurs in
many strains of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The discovery of the 2 fm plasmid
was very fortuitous as it allowed the construction of cloning vectors for this very important industrial organism (p. 105). However, the search for plasmids in other eukaryotes
(such as filamentous fungi, plants and animals) has proved disappointing, and it is suspected that many higher organisms simply do not harbor plasmids within their cells.

2.2 Bacteriophages
Bacteriophages, or phages as they are commonly known, are viruses that specifically
infect bacteria. Like all viruses, phages are very simple in structure, consisting merely of
a DNA (or occasionally ribonucleic acid (RNA)) molecule carrying a number of genes,
including several for replication of the phage, surrounded by a protective coat or capsid
made up of protein molecules (Figure 2.5).

2.2.1 The phage infection cycle
The general pattern of infection, which is the same for all types of phage, is a three-step
process (Figure 2.6):
1 The phage particle attaches to the outside of the bacterium and injects its DNA
chromosome into the cell.
2 The phage DNA molecule is replicated, usually by specific phage enzymes coded by
genes in the phage chromosome.
3 Other phage genes direct synthesis of the protein components of the capsid, and
new phage particles are assembled and released from the bacterium.
With some phage types the entire infection cycle is completed very quickly, possibly
in less than 20 minutes. This type of rapid infection is called a lytic cycle, as release of
the new phage particles is associated with lysis of the bacterial cell. The characteristic
feature of a lytic infection cycle is that phage DNA replication is immediately followed

Chapter 2 Vectors for Gene Cloning: Plasmids and Bacteriophages

by synthesis of capsid proteins, and the phage DNA molecule is never maintained in a
stable condition in the host cell.

2.2.2 Lysogenic phages
In contrast to a lytic cycle, lysogenic infection is characterized by retention of the phage
DNA molecule in the host bacterium, possibly for many thousands of cell divisions.
With many lysogenic phages the phage DNA is inserted into the bacterial genome, in a
manner similar to episomal insertion (see Figure 2.3b). The integrated form of the phage
DNA (called the prophage) is quiescent, and a bacterium (referred to as a lysogen) that
carries a prophage is usually physiologically indistinguishable from an uninfected cell.
However, the prophage is eventually released from the host genome and the phage
reverts to the lytic mode and lyses the cell. The infection cycle of lambda (E), a typical
lysogenic phage of this type, is shown in Figure 2.7.
A limited number of lysogenic phages follow a rather different infection cycle. When
M13 or a related phage infects E. coli, new phage particles are continuously assembled
and released from the cell. The M13 DNA is not integrated into the bacterial genome
and does not become quiescent. With these phages, cell lysis never occurs, and the
infected bacterium can continue to grow and divide, albeit at a slower rate than
uninfected cells. Figure 2.8 shows the M13 infection cycle.
Although there are many different varieties of bacteriophage, only e and M13 have
found a major role as cloning vectors. We will now consider the properties of these two
phages in more detail.
Gene organization in the 5 DNA molecule
e is a typical example of a head-and-tail phage (see Figure 2.5a). The DNA is contained
in the polyhedral head structure and the tail serves to attach the phage to the bacterial
surface and to inject the DNA into the cell (see Figure 2.7).
The e DNA molecule is 49 kb in size and has been intensively studied by the techniques of gene mapping and DNA sequencing. As a result the positions and identities
of all of the genes in the e DNA molecule are known (Figure 2.9). A feature of the e
genetic map is that genes related in terms of function are clustered together in the
genome. For example, all of the genes coding for components of the capsid are grouped
together in the left-hand third of the molecule, and genes controlling integration of the
prophage into the host genome are clustered in the middle of the molecule. Clustering
of related genes is profoundly important for controlling expression of the e genome, as
it allows genes to be switched on and off as a group rather than individually. Clustering
is also important in the construction of e-based cloning vectors, as we will discover
when we return to this topic in Chapter 6.
The linear and circular forms of 5 DNA
A second feature of e that turns out to be of importance in the construction of cloning
vectors is the conformation of the DNA molecule. The molecule shown in Figure 2.9 is
linear, with two free ends, and represents the DNA present in the phage head structure. This linear molecule consists of two complementary strands of DNA, base-paired
according to the Watson–Crick rules (that is, double-stranded DNA). However, at either
end of the molecule is a short 12-nucleotide stretch in which the DNA is single-stranded
(Figure 2.10a). The two single strands are complementary, and so can base pair with one
another to form a circular, completely double-stranded molecule (Figure 2.10b).

Complementary single strands are often referred to as “sticky” ends or cohesive ends,
because base pairing between them can “stick” together the two ends of a DNA molecule
(or the ends of two different DNA molecules). The e cohesive ends are called the cos
sites and they play two distinct roles during the e infection cycle. First, they allow the
linear DNA molecule that is injected into the cell to be circularized, which is a necessary prerequisite for insertion into the bacterial genome (see Figure 2.7).

The λ genetic map, showing the positions of the important genes and the functions of the gene clusters.

The second role of the cos sites is rather different, and comes into play after the
prophage has excised from the host genome. At this stage a large number of new e DNA
molecules are produced by the rolling circle mechanism of replication (Figure 2.10c),
in which a continuous DNA strand is “rolled off” the template molecule. The result
is a catenane consisting of a series of linear e genomes joined together at the cos sites.
The role of the cos sites is now to act as recognition sequences for an endonuclease
that cleaves the catenane at the cos sites, producing individual e genomes. This endonuclease, which is the product of gene A on the e DNA molecule, creates the singlestranded sticky ends, and also acts in conjunction with other proteins to package each
e genome into a phage head structure. The cleavage and packaging processes recognize
just the cos sites and the DNA sequences to either side of them, so changing the
structure of the internal regions of the e genome, for example by inserting new genes,
has no effect on these events so long as the overall length of the e genome is not altered
too greatly.

M13—a filamentous phage
M13 is an example of a filamentous phage (see Figure 2.5b) and is completely different
in structure from e. Furthermore, the M13 DNA molecule is much smaller than the
e genome, being only 6407 nucleotides in length. It is circular and is unusual in that it
consists entirely of single-stranded DNA.
The smaller size of the M13 DNA molecule means that it has room for fewer genes
than the e genome. This is possible because the M13 capsid is constructed from multiple
copies of just three proteins (requiring only three genes), whereas synthesis of the e

head-and-tail structure involves over 15 different proteins. In addition, M13 follows a
simpler infection cycle than e, and does not need genes for insertion into the host
genome.
Injection of an M13 DNA molecule into an E. coli cell occurs via the pilus, the
structure that connects two cells during sexual conjugation (see Figure 2.4). Once inside
the cell the single-stranded molecule acts as the template for synthesis of a complementary strand, resulting in normal double-stranded DNA (Figure 2.11a). This molecule
is not inserted into the bacterial genome, but instead replicates until over 100 copies are
present in the cell (Figure 2.11b). When the bacterium divides, each daughter cell
receives copies of the phage genome, which continues to replicate, thereby maintaining
its overall numbers per cell. As shown in Figure 2.11c, new phage particles are continuously assembled and released, about 1000 new phages being produced during each
generation of an infected cell.
Several features of M13 make this phage attractive as a cloning vector. The genome
is less than 10 kb in size, well within the range desirable for a potential vector. In addition, the double-stranded replicative form (RF) of the M13 genome behaves very much
like a plasmid, and can be treated as such for experimental purposes. It is easily prepared
from a culture of infected E. coli cells (p. 43) and can be reintroduced by transfection
(p. 81). Most importantly, genes cloned with an M13-based vector can be obtained in
the form of single-stranded DNA. Single-stranded versions of cloned genes are useful
for several techniques, notably DNA sequencing and in vitro mutagenesis (pp. 169 and
203). Cloning in an M13 vector is an easy and reliable way of obtaining single-stranded
DNA for this type of work. M13 vectors are also used in phage display, a technique for
identifying pairs of genes whose protein products interact with one another (p. 220).

2.2.3 Viruses as cloning vectors for other organisms
Most living organisms are infected by viruses and it is not surprising that there has been
great interest in the possibility that viruses might be used as cloning vectors for higher
organisms. This is especially important when it is remembered that plasmids are not
commonly found in organisms other than bacteria and yeast. Several eukaryotic viruses
have been employed as cloning vectors for specialized applications: for example, human
adenoviruses are used in gene therapy (p. 259), baculoviruses are used to synthesize
important pharmaceutical proteins in insect cells (p. 240), and caulimoviruses and
geminiviruses have been used for cloning in plants (p. 120). These vectors are discussed
more fully in Chapter 7.

3.1 Preparation of total cell DNA
3.2 Preparation of plasmid DNA
3.3 Preparation of bacteriophage DNA

The genetic engineer will, at different times, need to prepare at least three distinct kinds
of DNA. First, total cell DNA will often be required as a source of material from which
to obtain genes to be cloned. Total cell DNA may be DNA from a culture of bacteria,
from a plant, from animal cells, or from any other type of organism that is being studied.
It consists of the genomic DNA of the organism along with any additional DNA molecules, such as plasmids, that are present.
The second type of DNA that will be required is pure plasmid DNA. Preparation of
plasmid DNA from a culture of bacteria follows the same basic steps as purification of
total cell DNA, with the crucial difference that at some stage the plasmid DNA must be
separated from the main bulk of chromosomal DNA also present in the cell.
Finally, phage DNA will be needed if a phage cloning vector is to be used. Phage
DNA is generally prepared from bacteriophage particles rather than from infected
cells, so there is no problem with contaminating bacterial DNA. However, special
techniques are needed to remove the phage capsid. An exception is the double-stranded
replicative form of M13, which is prepared from E. coli cells in the same way as a
bacterial plasmid.

the simplest type of DNA purification procedure, that where the entire DNA complement

of a bacterial cell is required. The modifications needed for plasmid and phage DNA

3.1.1 Growing and harvesting a bacterial culture
Most bacteria can be grown without too much difficulty in a liquid medium (broth
culture). The culture medium must provide a balanced mixture of the essential nutrients
at concentrations that will allow the bacteria to grow and divide efficiently. Two typical
growth media are detailed in Table 3.1.
M9 is an example of a defined medium in which all the components are known. This
medium contains a mixture of inorganic nutrients to provide essential elements such as

nitrogen, magnesium, and calcium, as well as glucose to supply carbon and energy. In
practice, additional growth factors such as trace elements and vitamins must be added
to M9 before it will support bacterial growth. Precisely which supplements are needed
depends on the species concerned.
The second medium described in Table 3.1 is rather different. Luria-Bertani (LB) is
a complex or undefined medium, meaning that the precise identity and quantity of its
components are not known. This is because two of the ingredients, tryptone and yeast
extract, are complicated mixtures of unknown chemical compounds. Tryptone in fact
supplies amino acids and small peptides, while yeast extract (a dried preparation of
partially digested yeast cells) provides the nitrogen requirements, along with sugars
and inorganic and organic nutrients. Complex media such as LB need no further supplementation and support the growth of a wide range of bacterial species.
Defined media must be used when the bacterial culture has to be grown under
precisely controlled conditions. However, this is not necessary when the culture is being
grown simply as a source of DNA, and under these circumstances a complex medium
is appropriate. In LB medium at 37°C, aerated by shaking at 150–250 rpm on a rotary
platform, E. coli cells divide once every 20 min or so until the culture reaches a
maximum density of about 2–3 × 109 cells /ml. The growth of the culture can be monitored by reading the optical density (OD) at 600 nm (Figure 3.2), at which wavelength
1 OD unit corresponds to about 0.8 × 109 cells /ml.
In order to prepare a cell extract, the bacteria must be obtained in as small a volume
as possible. Harvesting is therefore performed by spinning the culture in a centrifuge
(Figure 3.3). Fairly low centrifugation speeds will pellet the bacteria at the bottom
of the centrifuge tube, allowing the culture medium to be poured off. Bacteria from a

3.1.2 Preparation of a cell extract
The bacterial cell is enclosed in a cytoplasmic membrane and surrounded by a rigid cell
wall. With some species, including E. coli, the cell wall may itself be enveloped by a
second, outer membrane. All of these barriers have to be disrupted to release the cell
components.
Techniques for breaking open bacterial cells can be divided into physical methods,
in which the cells are disrupted by mechanical forces, and chemical methods, where cell
lysis is brought about by exposure to chemical agents that affect the integrity of the cell
barriers. Chemical methods are most commonly used with bacterial cells when the object
is DNA preparation.
Chemical lysis generally involves one agent attacking the cell wall and another
disrupting the cell membrane (Figure 3.4a). The chemicals that are used depend on the
species of bacterium involved, but with E. coli and related organisms, weakening of
the cell wall is usually brought about by lysozyme, ethylenediamine tetraacetate (EDTA),
or a combination of both. Lysozyme is an enzyme that is present in egg white and in
secretions such as tears and saliva, and which digests the polymeric compounds that
give the cell wall its rigidity. EDTA removes magnesium ions that are essential for preserving the overall structure of the cell envelope, and also inhibits cellular enzymes that
could degrade DNA. Under some conditions, weakening the cell wall with lysozyme or

EDTA is sufficient to cause bacterial cells to burst, but usually a detergent such as sodium
dodecyl sulphate (SDS) is also added. Detergents aid the process of lysis by removing
lipid molecules and thereby cause disruption of the cell membranes.
Having lysed the cells, the final step in preparation of a cell extract is removal of
insoluble cell debris. Components such as partially digested cell wall fractions can be
pelleted by centrifugation (Figure 3.4b), leaving the cell extract as a reasonably clear
supernatant.

3.1.3 Purification of DNA from a cell extract
In addition to DNA, a bacterial cell extract contains significant quantities of protein
and RNA. A variety of methods can be used to purify the DNA from this mixture. One
approach is to treat the mixture with reagents which degrade the contaminants,
leaving a pure solution of DNA (Figure 3.5a). Other methods use ion-exchange
chromatography to separate the mixture into its various components, so the DNA is
removed from the proteins and RNA in the extract (Figure 3.5b).
Removing contaminants by organic extraction and enzyme digestion
The standard way to deproteinize a cell extract is to add phenol or a 1 : 1 mixture of
phenol and chloroform. These organic solvents precipitate proteins but leave the nucleic
acids (DNA and RNA) in aqueous solution. The result is that if the cell extract is mixed
gently with the solvent, and the layers then separated by centrifugation, precipitated
protein molecules are left as a white coagulated mass at the interface between the
aqueous and organic layers (Figure 3.6). The aqueous solution of nucleic acids can then
be removed with a pipette.
With some cell extracts the protein content is so great that a single phenol extraction
is not sufficient to completely purify the nucleic acids. This problem could be solved by
carrying out several phenol extractions one after the other, but this is undesirable as
each mixing and centrifugation step results in a certain amount of breakage of the DNA
molecules. The answer is to treat the cell extract with a protease such as pronase or

proteinase K before phenol extraction. These enzymes break polypeptides down into
smaller units, which are more easily removed by phenol.
Some RNA molecules, especially messenger RNA (mRNA), are removed by phenol
treatment, but most remain with the DNA in the aqueous layer. The only effective way
to remove the RNA is with the enzyme ribonuclease, which rapidly degrades these
molecules into ribonucleotide subunits.
Using ion-exchange chromatography to purify DNA from a cell extract
Biochemists have devised various methods for using differences in electrical charge to
separate mixtures of chemicals into their individual components. One of these methods
is ion-exchange chromatography, which separates molecules according to how tightly
they bind to electrically charged particles present in a chromatographic matrix or
resin. DNA and RNA are both negatively charged, as are some proteins, and so bind to
a positively charged resin. The electrical attachment is disrupted by salt (Figure 3.7a),
removal of the more tightly bound molecules requiring higher concentrations of salt. By
gradually increasing the salt concentration, different types of molecule can be detached
from the resin one after another.
The simplest way to carry out ion-exchange chromatography is to place the resin in
a glass or plastic column and then add the cell extract to the top (Figure 3.7b). The
extract passes through the column, and because this extract contains very little salt all
the negatively charged molecules bind to the resin and are retained in the column. If a
salt solution of gradually increasing concentration is now passed through the column,
the different types of molecule will elute (i.e., become unbound) in the sequence protein,
RNA, and finally DNA. However, such careful separation is usually not needed so just
two salt solutions are used, one whose concentration is sufficient to elute the protein and
RNA, leaving just the DNA bound, followed by a second of a higher concentration
which elutes the DNA, now free from protein and RNA contaminants.

3.1.4 Concentration of DNA samples
Organic extraction often results in a very thick solution of DNA that does not need to
be concentrated any further. Other purification methods give more dilute solutions and
it is therefore important to consider methods for increasing the DNA concentration.
The most frequently used method of concentration is ethanol precipitation. In the
presence of salt (strictly speaking, monovalent cations such as sodium ions (Na+ )), and
at a temperature of −20°C or less, absolute ethanol efficiently precipitates polymeric
nucleic acids. With a thick solution of DNA the ethanol can be layered on top of the
sample, causing molecules to precipitate at the interface. A spectacular trick is to
push a glass rod through the ethanol into the DNA solution. When the rod is removed,

DNA molecules adhere and can be pulled out of the solution in the form of a long fiber
(Figure 3.8a). Alternatively, if ethanol is mixed with a dilute DNA solution, the precipitate can be collected by centrifugation (Figure 3.8b), and then redissolved in an appropriate
volume of water. Ethanol precipitation has the added advantage of leaving short-chain
and monomeric nucleic acid components in solution. Ribonucleotides produced by
ribonuclease treatment are therefore lost at this stage.

3.1.5 Measurement of DNA concentration
It is crucial to know exactly how much DNA is present in a solution when carrying out
a gene cloning experiment. Fortunately DNA concentrations can be accurately measured
by ultraviolet (UV) absorbance spectrophotometry. The amount of UV radiation
absorbed by a solution of DNA is directly proportional to the amount of DNA in the

sample. Usually absorbance is measured at 260 nm, at which wavelength an absorbance
(A 260) of 1.0 corresponds to 50 mg of double-stranded DNA per ml. Measurements of
as little as 1 fl of a DNA solution can be carried out in spectrophotometers designed
especially for this purpose.
Ultraviolet absorbance can also be used to check the purity of a DNA preparation.
With a pure sample of DNA, the ratio of the absorbances at 260 and 280 nm (A 260 /A 280)
is 1.8. Ratios of less than 1.8 indicate that the preparation is contaminated, either with
protein or with phenol.

3.1.6 Other methods for the preparation of total cell DNA
Bacteria are not the only organisms from which DNA may be required. Total cell DNA
from, for example, plants or animals will be needed if the aim of the genetic engineering
project is to clone genes from these organisms. Although the basic steps in DNA
purification are the same whatever the organism, some modifications may have to be
introduced to take account of the special features of the cells being used.
Obviously growth of cells in liquid medium is appropriate only for bacteria, other
microorganisms, and plant and animal cell cultures. The major modifications, however,
are likely to be needed at the cell breakage stage. The chemicals used for disrupting
bacterial cells do not usually work with other organisms: lysozyme, for example, has no
effect on plant cells. Specific degradative enzymes are available for most cell wall types,
but often physical techniques, such as grinding frozen material with a mortar and
pestle, are more efficient. On the other hand, most animal cells have no cell wall at all,
and can be lysed simply by treating with detergent.
Another important consideration is the biochemical content of the cells from which
DNA is being extracted. With most bacteria the main biochemicals present in a cell
extract are protein, DNA and RNA, so phenol extraction and/or protease treatment,
followed by removal of RNA with ribonuclease, leaves a pure DNA sample. These
treatments may not, however, be sufficient to give pure DNA if the cells also contain
significant quantities of other biochemicals. Plant tissues are particularly difficult in this
respect as they often contain large amounts of carbohydrates that are not removed by
phenol extraction. Instead a different approach must be used. One method makes use
of a detergent called cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB), which forms an
insoluble complex with nucleic acids. When CTAB is added to a plant cell extract the

nucleic acid–CTAB complex precipitates, leaving carbohydrate, protein, and other
contaminants in the supernatant (Figure 3.9). The precipitate is then collected by
centrifugation and resuspended in 1 M sodium chloride, which causes the complex to
break down. The nucleic acids can now be concentrated by ethanol precipitation and
the RNA removed by ribonuclease treatment.
The need to adapt organic extraction methods to take account of the biochemical
contents of different types of starting material has stimulated the search for DNA
purification methods that can be used with any species. This is one of the reasons why
ion-exchange chromatography has become so popular. A similar method involves
a compound called guanidinium thiocyanate, which has two properties that make it
useful for DNA purification. First, it denatures and dissolves all biochemicals other
than nucleic acids and can therefore be used to release DNA from virtually any type of
cell or tissue. Second, in the presence of guanidinium thiocyanate, DNA binds tightly
to silica particles (Figure 3.10a). This provides an easy way of recovering the DNA from
the denatured mix of biochemicals. One possibility is to add the silica directly to the
cell extract but, as with the ion-exchange methods, it is more convenient to use a
chromatography column. The silica is placed in the column and the cell extract added
(Figure 3.10b). DNA binds to the silica and is retained in the column, whereas the
denatured biochemicals pass straight through. After washing away the last contaminants
with guanidinium thiocyanate solution, the DNA is recovered by adding water, which
destabilizes the interactions between the DNA molecules and the silica.

3.2 Preparation of plasmid DNA
Purification of plasmids from a culture of bacteria involves the same general strategy as
preparation of total cell DNA. A culture of cells, containing plasmids, is grown in liquid
medium, harvested, and a cell extract prepared. The protein and RNA are removed,
and the DNA probably concentrated by ethanol precipitation. However, there is an
important distinction between plasmid purification and preparation of total cell DNA.
In a plasmid preparation it is always necessary to separate the plasmid DNA from the
large amount of bacterial chromosomal DNA that is also present in the cells.
Separating the two types of DNA can be very difficult, but is nonetheless essential if
the plasmids are to be used as cloning vectors. The presence of the smallest amount of
contaminating bacterial DNA in a gene cloning experiment can easily lead to undesirable
results. Fortunately several methods are available for removal of bacterial DNA during

plasmid purification, and the use of these methods, individually or in combination, can
result in isolation of very pure plasmid DNA.
The methods are based on the several physical differences between plasmid DNA
and bacterial DNA, the most obvious of which is size. The largest plasmids are only 8%
of the size of the E. coli chromosome, and most are much smaller than this. Techniques
that can separate small DNA molecules from large ones should therefore effectively
purify plasmid DNA.
In addition to size, plasmids and bacterial DNA differ in conformation. When applied
to a polymer such as DNA, the term conformation refers to the overall spatial configuration of the molecule, with the two simplest conformations being linear and circular.
Plasmids and the bacterial chromosome are circular, but during preparation of the cell
extract the chromosome is always broken to give linear fragments. A method for
separating circular from linear molecules will therefore result in pure plasmids.

Chapter 3 Purification of DNA from Living Cells

35

3.2.1 Separation on the basis of size
The usual stage at which size fractionation is performed is during preparation of the cell
extract. If the cells are lysed under very carefully controlled conditions, only a minimal
amount of chromosomal DNA breakage occurs. The resulting DNA fragments are still
very large—much larger than the plasmids—and can be removed with the cell debris
by centrifugation. This process is aided by the fact that the bacterial chromosome is
physically attached to the cell envelope, so fragments of the chromosome sediment with
the cell debris if these attachments are not broken.
Cell disruption must therefore be carried out very gently to prevent wholesale breakage of the bacterial DNA. For E. coli and related species, controlled lysis is performed
as shown in Figure 3.11. Treatment with EDTA and lysozyme is carried out in the
presence of sucrose, which prevents the cells from bursting immediately. Instead,
sphaeroplasts are formed, cells with partially degraded cell walls that retain an
intact cytoplasmic membrane. Cell lysis is now induced by adding a non-ionic detergent
such as Triton X-100 (ionic detergents, such as SDS, cause chromosomal breakage).
This method causes very little breakage of the bacterial DNA, so centrifugation leaves
a cleared lysate, consisting almost entirely of plasmid DNA.
A cleared lysate will, however, invariably retain some chromosomal DNA. Furthermore, if the plasmids themselves are large molecules, they may also sediment with the

cell debris. Size fractionation is therefore rarely sufficient on its own, and we must
consider alternative ways of removing the bacterial DNA contaminants.

3.2.2 Separation on the basis of conformation
Before considering the ways in which conformational differences between plasmids and
bacterial DNA can be used to separate the two types of DNA, we must look more closely
at the overall structure of plasmid DNA. It is not strictly correct to say that plasmids
have a circular conformation, because double-stranded DNA circles can take up one
of two quite distinct configurations. Most plasmids exist in the cell as supercoiled
molecules (Figure 3.12a). Supercoiling occurs because the double helix of the plasmid
DNA is partially unwound during the plasmid replication process by enzymes called
topoisomerases (p. 69). The supercoiled conformation can be maintained only if both
polynucleotide strands are intact, hence the more technical name of covalently closedcircular (ccc) DNA. If one of the polynucleotide strands is broken the double helix
reverts to its normal relaxed state, and the plasmid takes on the alternative conformation, called open-circular (oc) (Figure 3.12b).
Supercoiling is important in plasmid preparation because supercoiled molecules
can be fairly easily separated from non-supercoiled DNA. Two different methods are
commonly used. Both can purify plasmid DNA from crude cell extracts, although in
practice best results are obtained if a cleared lysate is first prepared.
Alkaline denaturation
The basis of this technique is that there is a narrow pH range at which non-supercoiled
DNA is denatured, whereas supercoiled plasmids are not. If sodium hydroxide is added
to a cell extract or cleared lysate, so that the pH is adjusted to 12.0–12.5, then the
hydrogen bonding in non-supercoiled DNA molecules is broken, causing the double
helix to unwind and the two polynucleotide chains to separate (Figure 3.13). If acid is
now added, these denatured bacterial DNA strands reaggregate into a tangled mass.
The insoluble network can be pelleted by centrifugation, leaving plasmid DNA in the
supernatant. An additional advantage of this procedure is that, under some circumstances (specifically cell lysis by SDS and neutralization with sodium acetate), most of
the protein and RNA also becomes insoluble and can be removed by the centrifugation
step. Further purification by organic extraction or column chromatography may therefore not be needed if the alkaline denaturation method is used.
Ethidium bromide–caesium chloride density gradient centrifugation
This is a specialized version of the more general technique of equilibrium or density
gradient centrifugation. A density gradient is produced by centrifuging a solution of

caesium chloride (CsCl) at a very high speed (Figure 3.14a). Macromolecules present
in the CsCl solution when it is centrifuged form bands at distinct points in the gradient
(Figure 3.14b). Exactly where a particular molecule bands depends on its buoyant
density: DNA has a buoyant density of about 1.70 g /cm3, and therefore migrates to the
point in the gradient where the CsCl density is also 1.70 g /cm3. In contrast, protein
molecules have much lower buoyant densities, and so float at the top of the tube,
whereas RNA forms a pellet at the bottom (Figure 3.14b). Density gradient centrifugation can therefore separate DNA, RNA, and protein and is an alternative to organic
extraction or column chromatography for DNA purification.
More importantly, density gradient centrifugation in the presence of ethidium bromide (EtBr) can be used to separate supercoiled DNA from non-supercoiled molecules.
Ethidium bromide binds to DNA molecules by intercalating between adjacent base pairs,
causing partial unwinding of the double helix (Figure 3.15). This unwinding results in
a decrease in the buoyant density, by as much as 0.125 g /cm3 for linear DNA. However,
supercoiled DNA, with no free ends, has very little freedom to unwind, and can only
bind a limited amount of EtBr. The decrease in buoyant density of a supercoiled
molecule is therefore much less, only about 0.085 g /cm3. As a consequence, supercoiled
molecules form a band in an EtBr–CsCl gradient at a different position to linear and
open-circular DNA (Figure 3.16a).
Ethidium bromide–caesium chloride density gradient centrifugation is a very efficient
method for obtaining pure plasmid DNA. When a cleared lysate is subjected to this
procedure, plasmids band at a distinct point, separated from the linear bacterial DNA,

with the protein floating on the top of the gradient and RNA pelleted at the bottom. The
position of the DNA bands can be seen by shining ultraviolet radiation on the tube, which
causes the bound EtBr to fluoresce. The pure plasmid DNA is removed by puncturing
the side of the tube and withdrawing a sample with a syringe (Figure 3.16b). The EtBr
bound to the plasmid DNA is extracted with n-butanol (Figure 3.16c) and the CsCl
removed by dialysis (Figure 3.16d). The resulting plasmid preparation is virtually 100%
pure and ready for use as a cloning vector.

3.2.3 Plasmid amplification
Preparation of plasmid DNA can be hindered by the fact that plasmids make up only
a small proportion of the total DNA in the bacterial cell. The yield of DNA from a
bacterial culture may therefore be disappointingly low. Plasmid amplification offers a
means of increasing this yield.
The aim of amplification is to increase the copy number of a plasmid. Some multicopy plasmids (those with copy numbers of 20 or more) have the useful property of
being able to replicate in the absence of protein synthesis. This contrasts with the main
bacterial chromosome, which cannot replicate under these conditions. This property
can be utilized during the growth of a bacterial culture for plasmid DNA purification.
After a satisfactory cell density has been reached, an inhibitor of protein synthesis
(e.g., chloramphenicol) is added, and the culture incubated for a further 12 hours.
During this time the plasmid molecules continue to replicate, even though chromosome
replication and cell division are blocked (Figure 3.17). The result is that plasmid copy
numbers of several thousand may be attained. Amplification is therefore a very efficient
way of increasing the yield of multicopy plasmids.

3.3 Preparation of bacteriophage DNA
The key difference between phage DNA purification and the preparation of either total
cell DNA or plasmid DNA is that for phages the starting material is not normally a cell
extract. This is because bacteriophage particles can be obtained in large numbers
from the extracellular medium of an infected bacterial culture. When such a culture
is centrifuged, the bacteria are pelleted, leaving the phage particles in suspension
(Figure 3.18). The phage particles are then collected from the suspension and their DNA
extracted by a single deproteinization step to remove the phage capsid.
This overall process is more straightforward than the procedure used to prepare total
cell or plasmid DNA. Nevertheless, successful purification of significant quantities of

phage DNA is subject to several pitfalls. The main difficulty, especially with e, is growing
an infected culture in such a way that the extracellular phage titer (the number of phage
particles per ml of culture) is sufficiently high. In practical terms, the maximum titer
that can reasonably be expected for e is 1010 per ml; yet 1010 e particles will yield only
500 ng of DNA. Large culture volumes, in the range of 500–1000 ml, are therefore
needed if substantial quantities of e DNA are to be obtained.

3.3.1 Growth of cultures to obtain a high * titer
Growing a large volume culture is no problem (bacterial cultures of 100 liters and over
are common in biotechnology), but obtaining the maximum phage titer requires a certain
amount of skill. The naturally occurring e phage is lysogenic (p. 19), and an infected
culture consists mainly of cells carrying the prophage integrated into the bacterial DNA
(see Figure 2.7). The extracellular e titer is extremely low under these circumstances.
To get a high yield of extracellular e, the culture must be induced, so that all the
bacteria enter the lytic phase of the infection cycle, resulting in cell death and release of
e particles into the medium. Induction is normally very difficult to control, but most
laboratory strains of e carry a temperature-sensitive (ts) mutation in the cI gene. This is
one of the genes that are responsible for maintaining the phage in the integrated state.
If inactivated by a mutation, the cI gene no longer functions correctly and the switch to
lysis occurs. In the cIts mutation, the cI gene is functional at 30°C, at which temperature
normal lysogeny can occur. But at 42°C, the cIts gene product does not work properly,
and lysogeny cannot be maintained. A culture of E. coli infected with a e phages carrying
the cIts mutation can therefore be induced to produce extracellular phages by transferring
from 30°C to 42°C (Figure 3.19).

3.3.2 Preparation of non-lysogenic * phages
Although most e strains are lysogenic, many cloning vectors derived from e are
modified, by deletions of the cI and other genes, so that lysogeny never occurs. These
phages cannot integrate into the bacterial genome and can infect cells only by a lytic
cycle (p. 18).
With these phages the key to obtaining a high titer lies in the way in which the
culture is grown, in particular the stage at which the cells are infected by adding phage
particles. If phages are added before the cells are dividing at their maximal rate, then all
the cells are lysed very quickly, resulting in a low titer (Figure 3.20a). On the other
hand, if the cell density is too high when the phages are added, then the culture will
never be completely lysed, and again the phage titer will be low (Figure 3.20b). The
ideal situation is when the age of the culture, and the size of the phage inoculum, are
balanced such that the culture continues to grow, but eventually all the cells are infected

and lysed (Figure 3.20c). As can be imagined, skill and experience are needed to judge
the matter to perfection.

3.3.3 Collection of phages from an infected culture
The remains of lysed bacterial cells, along with any intact cells that are inadvertently left
over, can be removed from an infected culture by centrifugation, leaving the phage
particles in suspension (see Figure 3.18). The problem now is to reduce the size of the
suspension to 5 ml or less, a manageable size for DNA extraction.
Phage particles are so small that they are pelleted only by very high speed centrifugation. Collection of phages is therefore usually achieved by precipitation with polyethylene glycol (PEG). This is a long-chain polymeric compound which, in the presence of
salt, absorbs water, thereby causing macromolecular assemblies such as phage particles
to precipitate. The precipitate can then be collected by centrifugation, and redissolved
in a suitably small volume (Figure 3.21).

3.3.4 Purification of DNA from * phage particles
Deproteinization of the redissolved PEG precipitate is sometimes sufficient to extract
pure phage DNA, but usually e phages are subjected to an intermediate purification
step. This is necessary because the PEG precipitate also contains a certain amount of
bacterial debris, possibly including unwanted cellular DNA. These contaminants can be
separated from the e particles by CsCl density gradient centrifugation. The e particles
band in a CsCl gradient at 1.45–1.50 g /cm3 (Figure 3.22), and can be withdrawn from

the gradient as described previously for DNA bands (see Figure 3.16). Removal of CsCl
by dialysis leaves a pure phage preparation from which the DNA can be extracted by
either phenol or protease treatment to digest the phage protein coat.

3.3.5 Purification of M13 DNA causes few problems
Most of the differences between the M13 and e infection cycles are to the advantage
of the molecular biologist wishing to prepare M13 DNA. First, the double-stranded
replicative form of M13 (p. 23), which behaves like a high copy number plasmid, is
very easily purified by the standard procedures for plasmid preparation. A cell extract
is prepared from cells infected with M13, and the replicative form separated from
bacterial DNA by, for example, EtBr–CsCl density gradient centrifugation.
However, the single-stranded form of the M13 genome, contained in the extracellular phage particles, is frequently required. In this respect the big advantage compared
with e is that high titers of M13 are very easy to obtain. As infected cells continually
secrete M13 particles into the medium (see Figure 2.8), with lysis never occurring, a
high M13 titer is achieved simply by growing the infected culture to a high cell density.
In fact, titers of 1012 per ml and above are quite easy to obtain without any special tricks
being used. Such high titers mean that significant amounts of single-stranded M13 DNA
can be prepared from cultures of small volume—5 ml or less. Furthermore, as the
infected cells are not lysed, there is no problem with cell debris contaminating the phage
suspension. Consequently the CsCl density gradient centrifugation step, needed for e
phage preparation, is rarely required with M13.
In summary, single-stranded M13 DNA preparation involves growth of a small
volume of infected culture, centrifugation to pellet the bacteria, precipitation of the
phage particles with PEG, phenol extraction to remove the phage protein coats, and
ethanol precipitation to concentrate the resulting DNA (Figure 3.23).

4.2 Enzymes for cutting DNA—restriction endonucleases
4.3 Ligation—joining DNA molecules together

Once pure samples of DNA have been prepared, the next step in a gene cloning experiment is construction of the recombinant DNA molecule (see Figure 1.1). To produce
this recombinant molecule, the vector, as well as the DNA to be cloned, must be cut at
specific points and then joined together in a controlled manner. Cutting and joining are
two examples of DNA manipulative techniques, a wide variety of which have been
developed over the past few years. As well as being cut and joined, DNA molecules can
be shortened, lengthened, copied into RNA or into new DNA molecules, and modified
by the addition or removal of specific chemical groups. These manipulations, all of
which can be carried out in the test tube, provide the foundation not only for gene
cloning, but also for studies of DNA biochemistry, gene structure, and the control of
gene expression.
Almost all DNA manipulative techniques make use of purified enzymes. Within the cell
these enzymes participate in essential processes such as DNA replication and transcription, breakdown of unwanted or foreign DNA (e.g., invading virus DNA), repair of
mutated DNA, and recombination between different DNA molecules. After purification from cell extracts, many of these enzymes can be persuaded to carry out their
natural reactions, or something closely related to them, under artificial conditions.
Although these enzymatic reactions are often straightforward, most are absolutely
impossible to perform by standard chemical methods. Purified enzymes are therefore
crucial to genetic engineering and an important industry has sprung up around their
preparation, characterization, and marketing. Commercial suppliers of high purity
enzymes provide an essential service to the molecular biologist.

The cutting and joining manipulations that underlie gene cloning are carried out by
enzymes called restriction endonucleases (for cutting) and ligases (for joining). Most of
this chapter will be concerned with the ways in which these two types of enzyme are
used. First, however, we must consider the whole range of DNA manipulative enzymes,
to see exactly what types of reaction can be performed. Many of these enzymes will be
mentioned in later chapters when procedures that make use of them are described.

4.1 The range of DNA manipulative enzymes
DNA manipulative enzymes can be grouped into four broad classes, depending on the
type of reaction that they catalyze:
l
l
l
l

Nucleases are enzymes that cut, shorten, or degrade nucleic acid molecules.
Ligases join nucleic acid molecules together.
Polymerases make copies of molecules.
Modifying enzymes remove or add chemical groups.

Before considering in detail each of these classes of enzyme, two points should be
made. The first is that, although most enzymes can be assigned to a particular class, a
few display multiple activities that span two or more classes. Most importantly, many
polymerases combine their ability to make new DNA molecules with an associated DNA
degradative (i.e., nuclease) activity.
Second, it should be appreciated that, as well as the DNA manipulative enzymes,
many similar enzymes able to act on RNA are known. The ribonuclease used to remove
contaminating RNA from DNA preparations (p. 30) is an example of such an enzyme.
Although some RNA manipulative enzymes have applications in gene cloning and will
be mentioned in later chapters, we will in general restrict our thoughts to those enzymes
that act on DNA.

4.1.1 Nucleases
Nucleases degrade DNA molecules by breaking the phosphodiester bonds that link one
nucleotide to the next in a DNA strand. There are two different kinds of nuclease
(Figure 4.1):
l
l

Exonucleases remove nucleotides one at a time from the end of a DNA molecule.
Endonucleases are able to break internal phosphodiester bonds within a DNA molecule.

The main distinction between different exonucleases lies in the number of strands
that are degraded when a double-stranded molecule is attacked. The enzyme called
Bal31 (purified from the bacterium Alteromonas espejiana) is an example of an exonuclease that removes nucleotides from both strands of a double-stranded molecule
(Figure 4.2a). The greater the length of time that Bal31 is allowed to act on a group of
DNA molecules, the shorter the resulting DNA fragments will be. In contrast, enzymes
such as E. coli exonuclease III degrade just one strand of a double-stranded molecule,
leaving single-stranded DNA as the product (Figure 4.2b).
The same criterion can be used to classify endonucleases. S1 endonuclease (from
the fungus Aspergillus oryzae) only cleaves single strands (Figure 4.3a), whereas
deoxyribonuclease I (DNase I), which is prepared from cow pancreas, cuts both singleand double-stranded molecules (Figure 4.3b). DNase I is non-specific in that it attacks
DNA at any internal phosphodiester bond, so the end result of prolonged DNase I

action is a mixture of mononucleotides and very short oligonucleotides. On the other
hand, the special group of enzymes called restriction endonucleases cleave doublestranded DNA only at a limited number of specific recognition sites (Figure 4.3c). These
important enzymes are described in detail on p. 50.

4.1.2 Ligases
In the cell the function of DNA ligase is to repair single-stranded breaks (“discontinuities”)
that arise in double-stranded DNA molecules during, for example, DNA replication.
DNA ligases from most organisms can also join together two individual fragments of

double-stranded DNA (Figure 4.4). The role of these enzymes in construction of recombinant DNA molecules is described on p. 63.

4.1.3 Polymerases
DNA polymerases are enzymes that synthesize a new strand of DNA complementary to
an existing DNA or RNA template (Figure 4.5a). Most polymerases can function only
if the template possesses a double-stranded region that acts as a primer for initiation of
polymerization.
Four types of DNA polymerase are used routinely in genetic engineering. The first is
DNA polymerase I, which is usually prepared from E. coli. This enzyme attaches to a
short single-stranded region (or nick) in a mainly double-stranded DNA molecule, and
then synthesizes a completely new strand, degrading the existing strand as it proceeds
(Figure 4.5b). DNA polymerase I is therefore an example of an enzyme with a dual
activity—DNA polymerization and DNA degradation.
The polymerase and nuclease activities of DNA polymerase I are controlled by different parts of the enzyme molecule. The nuclease activity is contained in the first 323
amino acids of the polypeptide, so removal of this segment leaves a modified enzyme
that retains the polymerase function but is unable to degrade DNA. This modified

enzyme, called the Klenow fragment, can still synthesize a complementary DNA strand
on a single-stranded template, but as it has no nuclease activity it cannot continue the
synthesis once the nick is filled in (Figure 4.5c). Several other enzymes—natural polymerases and modified versions—have similar properties to the Klenow fragment. The
major application of these polymerases is in DNA sequencing (p. 166).
The Taq DNA polymerase used in the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) (see Figure 1.2)
is the DNA polymerase I enzyme of the bacterium Thermus aquaticus. This organism
lives in hot springs, and many of its enzymes, including the Taq DNA polymerase, are
thermostable, meaning that they are resistant to denaturation by heat treatment. This
is the special feature of Taq DNA polymerase that makes it suitable for PCR, because if
it was not thermostable it would be inactivated when the temperature of the reaction is
raised to 94°C to denature the DNA.
The final type of DNA polymerase that is important in genetic engineering is reverse
transcriptase, an enzyme involved in the replication of several kinds of virus. Reverse
transcriptase is unique in that it uses as a template not DNA but RNA (Figure 4.5d). The
ability of this enzyme to synthesize a DNA strand complementary to an RNA template
is central to the technique called complementary DNA (cDNA) cloning (p. 133).

4.1.4 DNA modifying enzymes
There are numerous enzymes that modify DNA molecules by addition or removal of
specific chemical groups. The most important are as follows:

4.2 Enzymes for cutting DNA—restriction
endonucleases
Gene cloning requires that DNA molecules be cut in a very precise and reproducible
fashion. This is illustrated by the way in which the vector is cut during construction of
a recombinant DNA molecule (Figure 4.7a). Each vector molecule must be cleaved at a
single position, to open up the circle so that new DNA can be inserted: a molecule that
is cut more than once will be broken into two or more separate fragments and will be
of no use as a cloning vector. Furthermore, each vector molecule must be cut at exactly
the same position on the circle—as will become apparent in later chapters, random
cleavage is not satisfactory. It should be clear that a very special type of nuclease is
needed to carry out this manipulation.
Often it is also necessary to cleave the DNA that is to be cloned (Figure 4.7b). There
are two reasons for this. First, if the aim is to clone a single gene, which may consist of
only 2 or 3 kb of DNA, then that gene will have to be cut out of the large (often greater
than 80 kb) DNA molecules produced by skilfull use of the preparative techniques

described in Chapter 3. Second, large DNA molecules may have to be broken down
simply to produce fragments small enough to be carried by the vector. Most cloning
vectors exhibit a preference for DNA fragments that fall into a particular size range:
most plasmid-based vectors, for example, are very inefficient at cloning DNA molecules
more than 8 kb in length.
Purified restriction endonucleases allow the molecular biologist to cut DNA molecules in the precise, reproducible manner required for gene cloning. The discovery of
these enzymes, which led to Nobel Prizes for W. Arber, H. Smith, and D. Nathans in
1978, was one of the key breakthroughs in the development of genetic engineering.

4.2.1 The discovery and function of restriction endonucleases
The initial observation that led to the eventual discovery of restriction endonucleases was
made in the early 1950s, when it was shown that some strains of bacteria are immune
to bacteriophage infection, a phenomenon referred to as host-controlled restriction.
The mechanism of restriction is not very complicated, even though it took over
20 years to be fully understood. Restriction occurs because the bacterium produces
an enzyme that degrades the phage DNA before it has time to replicate and direct synthesis of new phage particles (Figure 4.8a). The bacterium’s own DNA, the destruction
of which would of course be lethal, is protected from attack because it carries additional methyl groups that block the degradative enzyme action (Figure 4.8b).
These degradative enzymes are called restriction endonucleases and are synthesized
by many, perhaps all, species of bacteria: over 2500 different ones have been isolated
and more than 300 are available for use in the laboratory. Three different classes of
restriction endonuclease are recognized, each distinguished by a slightly different mode
of action. Types I and III are rather complex and have only a limited role in genetic

engineering. Type II restriction endonucleases, on the other hand, are the cutting
enzymes that are so important in gene cloning.

4.2.2 Type II restriction endonucleases cut DNA at specific
nucleotide sequences
The central feature of type II restriction endonucleases (which will be referred to simply
as “restriction endonucleases” from now on) is that each enzyme has a specific recognition
sequence at which it cuts a DNA molecule. A particular enzyme cleaves DNA at the
recognition sequence and nowhere else. For example, the restriction endonuclease called
PvuI (isolated from Proteus vulgaris) cuts DNA only at the hexanucleotide CGATCG.
In contrast, a second enzyme from the same bacterium, called PvuII, cuts at a different
hexanucleotide, in this case CAGCTG.
Many restriction endonucleases recognize hexanucleotide target sites, but others cut
at four, five, eight, or even longer nucleotide sequences. Sau3A (from Staphylococcus
aureus strain 3A) recognizes GATC, and AluI (Arthrobacter luteus) cuts at AGCT. There
are also examples of restriction endonucleases with degenerate recognition sequences,
meaning that they cut DNA at any one of a family of related sites. HinfI (Haemophilus
influenzae strain Rf), for instance, recognizes GANTC, so cuts at GAATC, GATTC,
GAGTC, and GACTC. The recognition sequences for some of the most frequently used
restriction endonucleases are listed in Table 4.1.

4.2.3 Blunt ends and sticky ends
The exact nature of the cut produced by a restriction endonuclease is of considerable
importance in the design of a gene cloning experiment. Many restriction endonucleases
make a simple double-stranded cut in the middle of the recognition sequence (Figure 4.9a),
resulting in a blunt end or flush end. PvuII and AluI are examples of blunt end cutters.
Other restriction endonucleases cut DNA in a slightly different way. With these
enzymes the two DNA strands are not cut at exactly the same position. Instead the
cleavage is staggered, usually by two or four nucleotides, so that the resulting DNA fragments have short single-stranded overhangs at each end (Figure 4.9b). These are called
sticky or cohesive ends, as base pairing between them can stick the DNA molecule back
together again (recall that sticky ends were encountered on p. 20 during the description
of e phage replication). One important feature of sticky end enzymes is that restriction
endonucleases with different recognition sequences may produce the same sticky ends.
BamHI (recognition sequence GGATCC) and BglII (AGATCT) are examples—both
produce GATC sticky ends (Figure 4.9c). The same sticky end is also produced by
Sau3A, which recognizes only the tetranucleotide GATC. Fragments of DNA produced
by cleavage with either of these enzymes can be joined to each other, as each fragment
carries a complementary sticky end.

4.2.4 The frequency of recognition sequences in a DNA
molecule
The number of recognition sequences for a particular restriction endonuclease in a DNA
molecule of known length can be calculated mathematically. A tetranucleotide sequence
(e.g., GATC) should occur once every 44 = 256 nucleotides, and a hexanucleotide

(e.g., GGATCC) once every 46 = 4096 nucleotides. These calculations assume that the
nucleotides are ordered in a random fashion and that the four different nucleotides are
present in equal proportions (i.e., the GC content = 50%). In practice, neither of these
assumptions is entirely valid. For example, the e DNA molecule, at 49 kb, should
contain about 12 sites for a restriction endonuclease with a hexanucleotide recognition sequence. In fact, many of these recognition sites occur less frequently (e.g., six
for BglII, five for BamHI, and only two for SalI), a reflection of the fact that the GC
content for e is rather less than 50% (Figure 4.10a).
Furthermore, restriction sites are generally not evenly spaced out along a DNA
molecule. If they were, then digestion with a particular restriction endonuclease would
give fragments of roughly equal sizes. Figure 4.10b shows the fragments produced by
cutting e DNA with BglII, BamHI, and SalI. In each case there is a considerable spread
of fragment sizes, indicating that in e DNA the nucleotides are not randomly ordered.
The lesson to be learned from Figure 4.10 is that although mathematics may give an
idea of how many restriction sites to expect in a given DNA molecule, only experimental analysis can provide the true picture. We must therefore move on to consider
how restriction endonucleases are used in the laboratory.

4.2.5 Performing a restriction digest in the laboratory
As an example, we will consider how to digest a sample of e DNA (concentration
125 mg/ml) with BglII.
First, the required amount of DNA must be pipetted into a test tube. The amount of
DNA that will be restricted depends on the nature of the experiment. In this case we will
digest 2 fg of e DNA, which is contained in 16 fl of the sample (Figure 4.11a). Very
accurate micropipettes will therefore be needed.

The other main component in the reaction will be the restriction endonuclease,
obtained from a commercial supplier as a pure solution of known concentration. But
before adding the enzyme, the solution containing the DNA must be adjusted to provide the correct conditions to ensure maximal activity of the enzyme. Most restriction
endonucleases function adequately at pH 7.4, but different enzymes vary in their
requirements for ionic strength (usually provided by sodium chloride (NaCl)) and
magnesium (Mg 2+ ) concentration (all type II restriction endonucleases require Mg 2+ in
order to function). It is also advisable to add a reducing agent, such as dithiothreitol
(DTT), which stabilizes the enzyme and prevents its inactivation. Providing the right
conditions for the enzyme is very important—incorrect NaCl or Mg 2+ concentrations
not only decrease the activity of the restriction endonuclease, they might also cause

changes in the specificity of the enzyme, so that DNA cleavage occurs at additional,
non-standard recognition sequences.
The composition of a suitable buffer for BglII is shown in Table 4.2. This buffer is ten
times the working concentration, and is diluted by being added to the reaction mixture.
In our example, a suitable final volume for the reaction mixture would be 20 fl, so we
add 2 fl of 10 × BglII buffer to the 16 fl of DNA already present (Figure 4.11b).
The restriction endonuclease can now be added. By convention, 1 unit of enzyme
is defined as the quantity needed to cut 1 fg of DNA in 1 hour, so we need 2 units
of BglII to cut 2 fg of e DNA. Bgl II is frequently obtained at a concentration of
4 units/fl, so 0.5 fl is sufficient to cleave the DNA. The final ingredients in the reaction mixture are therefore 0.5 fl Bgl II + 1.5 fl water, giving a final volume of 20 fl
(Figure 4.11c).
The last factor to consider is incubation temperature. Most restriction endonucleases, including Bgl II, work best at 37°C, but a few have different requirements.
TaqI, for example, is a restriction enzyme from Thermus aquaticus and, like Taq DNA
polymerase, has a high working temperature. Restriction digests with TaqI must be
incubated at 65°C to obtain maximum enzyme activity.
After 1 hour the restriction should be complete (Figure 4.11d). If the DNA fragments
produced by restriction are to be used in cloning experiments, the enzyme must somehow be destroyed so that it does not accidentally digest other DNA molecules that may
be added at a later stage. There are several ways of “killing” the enzyme. For many a
short incubation at 70°C is sufficient, for others phenol extraction or the addition of
ethylenediamine tetraacetate (EDTA), which binds Mg 2+ ions preventing restriction
endonuclease action, is used (Figure 4.11e).

4.2.6 Analyzing the result of restriction endonuclease
cleavage
A restriction digest results in a number of DNA fragments, the sizes of which depend
on the exact positions of the recognition sequences for the endonuclease in the original
molecule (see Figure 4.10). A way of determining the number and sizes of the fragments
is needed if restriction endonucleases are to be of use in gene cloning. Whether or not a
DNA molecule is cut at all can be determined fairly easily by testing the viscosity of the
solution. Larger DNA molecules result in a more viscous solution than smaller ones, so
cleavage is associated with a decrease in viscosity. However, working out the number and
sizes of the individual cleavage products is more difficult. In fact, for several years this was
one of the most tedious aspects of experiments involving DNA. Eventually the problems
were solved in the early 1970s when the technique of gel electrophoresis was developed.

Separation of molecules by gel electrophoresis
Electrophoresis, like ion-exchange chromatography (see p. 30), is a technique that uses
differences in electrical charge to separate the molecules in a mixture. DNA molecules
have negative charges, and so when placed in an electric field they migrate toward
the positive pole (Figure 4.12a). The rate of migration of a molecule depends on two
factors, its shape and its charge-to-mass ratio. Unfortunately, most DNA molecules are
the same shape and all have very similar charge-to-mass ratios. Fragments of different
sizes cannot therefore be separated by standard electrophoresis.
The size of the DNA molecule does, however, become a factor if the electrophoresis is performed in a gel. A gel, which is usually made of agarose, polyacrylamide,
or a mixture of the two, comprises a complex network of pores, through which the
DNA molecules must travel to reach the positive electrode. The smaller the DNA molecule, the faster it can migrate through the gel. Gel electrophoresis therefore separates
DNA molecules according to their size (Figure 4.12b).
In practice the composition of the gel determines the sizes of the DNA molecules
that can be separated. A 0.5 cm thick slab of 0.5% agarose, which has relatively large
pores, would be used for molecules in the size range 1–30 kb, allowing, for example,
molecules of 10 and 12 kb to be clearly distinguished. At the other end of the scale, a
very thin (0.3 mm) 40% polyacrylamide gel, with extremely small pores, would be used
to separate much smaller DNA molecules, in the range 1–300 bp, and could distinguish
molecules differing in length by just a single nucleotide.

Visualizing DNA molecules in an agarose gel
The easiest way to see the results of a gel electrophoresis experiment is to stain the gel
with a compound that makes the DNA visible. Ethidium bromide (EtBr), already
described on p. 37 as a means of visualizing DNA in caesium chloride gradients, is also
routinely used to stain DNA in agarose and polyacrylamide gels (Figure 4.13). Bands
showing the positions of the different size classes of DNA fragment are clearly visible
under ultraviolet irradiation after EtBr staining, so long as sufficient DNA is present.
Unfortunately, the procedure is very hazardous because ethidium bromide is a powerful mutagen. EtBr staining also has limited sensitivity, and if a band contains less than
about 10 ng of DNA then it might not be visible after staining.
For this reason, non-mutagenic dyes that stain DNA green, red, or blue are now
used in many laboratories. Most of these dyes can be used either as a post-stain after
electrophoresis, as illustrated in Figure 4.13 for EtBr, or alternatively, because they
are non-hazardous, they can be included in the buffer solution in which the agarose
or polyacrylamide is dissolved when the gel is prepared. Some of these dyes require
ultraviolet irradiation in order to make the bands visible, but others are visualized by
illumination at other wavelengths, for example under blue light, removing a second
hazard as ultraviolet radiation can cause severe burns. The most sensitive dyes are able
to detect bands that contain less than 1 ng DNA.

4.2.7 Estimation of the sizes of DNA molecules
Gel electrophoresis separates different sized DNA molecules, with the smallest molecules
traveling the greatest distance toward the positive electrode. If several DNA fragments of
varying sizes are present (the result of a successful restriction digest, for example), then a
series of bands appears in the gel. How can the sizes of these fragments be determined?
The most accurate method is to make use of the mathematical relationship that links
migration rate to molecular mass. The relevant formula is:
D = a − b(log M)

where D is the distance moved, M is the molecular mass, and a and b are constants that

Because extreme accuracy in estimating DNA fragment sizes is not always necessary,
a much simpler though less precise method is more generally used. A standard restriction digest, comprising fragments of known size, is usually included in each electrophoresis gel that is run. Restriction digests of e DNA are often used in this way as size
markers. For example, HindIII cleaves e DNA into eight fragments, ranging in size from
125 bp for the smallest to over 23 kb for the largest. As the sizes of the fragments in this
digest are known, the fragment sizes in the experimental digest can be estimated by
comparing the positions of the bands in the two tracks (Figure 4.14). Special mixtures
of DNA fragments called DNA ladders, whose sizes are multiples of 100 bp or of 1 kb,
can also be used as size markers. Although not precise, size estimation by comparison
with DNA markers can be performed with as little as a 5% error, which is satisfactory
for most purposes.

4.2.8 Mapping the positions of different restriction sites in a
DNA molecule
So far we have considered how to determine the number and sizes of the DNA fragments
produced by restriction endonuclease cleavage. The next step in restriction analysis
is to construct a map showing the relative positions in the DNA molecule of the
recognition sequences for a number of different enzymes. Only when a restriction map
is available can the correct restriction endonucleases be selected for the particular
cutting manipulation that is required (Figure 4.15).

To construct a restriction map, a series of restriction digests must be performed. First,
the number and sizes of the fragments produced by each restriction endonuclease
must be determined by gel electrophoresis followed by comparison with size markers
(Figure 4.16). This information must then be supplemented by a series of double
digestions, in which the DNA is cut by two restriction endonucleases at once. It might
be possible to perform a double digestion in one step if both enzymes have similar
requirements for pH, Mg 2+ concentration, etc. Alternatively, the two digestions may
have to be carried out one after the other, adjusting the reaction mixture after the first
digestion to provide a different set of conditions for the second enzyme.
Comparing the results of single and double digests will allow many, if not all, of the
restriction sites to be mapped (Figure 4.16). Ambiguities can usually be resolved by
partial digestion, carried out under conditions that result in cleavage of only a limited
number of the restriction sites on any DNA molecule. Partial digestion is usually
achieved by reducing the incubation period, so the enzyme does not have time to cut all
the restriction sites, or by incubating at a low temperature (e.g., 4°C rather than 37°C),
which limits the activity of the enzyme.
The result of a partial digestion is a complex pattern of bands in an electrophoresis
gel. As well as the standard fragments, produced by total digestion, additional sizes are
seen. These are molecules that comprise two adjacent restriction fragments, separated
by a site that has not been cleaved. Their sizes indicate which restriction fragments in
the complete digest are next to one another in the uncut molecule (Figure 4.16).

4.2.9 Special gel electrophoresis methods for separating
larger molecules
During agarose gel electrophoresis, a DNA fragment migrates at a rate that is proportional to its size, but this relationship is not a direct one. The formula that links

migration rate to molecular mass has a logarithmic component (p. 59), which means
that the difference in migration rates become increasingly small for larger molecules
(Figure 4.17). In practice, molecules larger than about 50 kb cannot be resolved efficiently by standard gel electrophoresis.
This size limitation is not usually a problem when the restriction fragments being
studied have been obtained by cutting the DNA with an enzyme with a tetranucleotide
or hexanucleotide recognition sequence. Most, if not all, of the fragments produced
in this way will be less than 30 kb in length and easily resolved by agarose gel electrophoresis. Difficulties might arise, however, if an enzyme with a longer recognition sequence is used, such as NotI, which cuts at an eight-nucleotide sequence (see
Table 4.1). NotI would be expected, on average, to cut a DNA molecule once every

48 = 65,536 bp. It is therefore unlikely that NotI fragments will be separated by standard gel electrophoresis.
The limitations of standard gel electrophoresis can be overcome if a more complex
electric field is used. Several different systems have been designed, but the principle
is best illustrated by orthogonal field alternation gel electrophoresis (OFAGE).
Instead of being applied directly along the length of the gel, as in the standard method
(Figure 4.18a), the electric field now alternates between two pairs of electrodes, each

Chapter 4 Manipulation of Purified DNA

63

pair set at an angle of 45° to the length of the gel (Figure 4.18b). The result is a pulsed
field, with the DNA molecules in the gel having continually to change direction in
accordance with the pulses. As the two fields alternate in a regular fashion, the net movement of the DNA molecules in the gel is still from one end to the other, in more or less
a straight line. However, with every change in field direction, each DNA molecule has
to realign through 90° before its migration can continue. This is the key point, because
a short molecule can realign faster than a long one, allowing the short molecule to
progress toward the bottom of the gel more quickly. This added dimension increases the
resolving power of the gel quite dramatically, so that molecules up to several thousand
kilobases in length can be separated.
This size range includes not only restriction fragments but also the intact chromosomal molecules of many lower eukaryotes, including yeast, several important filamentous
fungi, and protozoans such as the malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum. OFAGE
and related techniques such as contour clamped homogeneous electric fields (CHEF)
and field inversion gel electrophoresis (FIGE) can therefore be used to prepare gels
showing the separated chromosomes of these organisms (Figure 4.18c), enabling DNA
from these individual chromosomes to be purified.

4.3 Ligation – joining DNA molecules together
The final step in construction of a recombinant DNA molecule is the joining together
of the vector molecule and the DNA to be cloned (Figure 4.19). This process is referred
to as ligation, and the enzyme that catalyzes the reaction is called DNA ligase.

4.3.1 The mode of action of DNA ligase
All living cells produce DNA ligases, but the enzyme used in genetic engineering is
usually purified from E. coli bacteria that have been infected with T4 phage. Within the
cell the enzyme carries out the very important function of repairing any discontinuities
that may arise in one of the strands of a double-stranded molecule (see Figure 4.4a). A
discontinuity is quite simply a position where a phosphodiester bond between adjacent
nucleotides is missing (contrast this with a nick, where one or more nucleotides are
absent). Although discontinuities may arise by chance breakage of the cell’s DNA
molecules, they are also a natural result of processes such as DNA replication and recombination. Ligases therefore play several vital roles in the cell.
In the test tube, purified DNA ligases, as well as repairing single-strand discontinuities, can also join together individual DNA molecules or the two ends of the same
molecule. The chemical reaction involved in ligating two molecules is exactly the same
as discontinuity repair, except that two phosphodiester bonds must be made, one for
each strand (Figure 4.20a).

The different joining reactions catalysed by DNA ligase: (a) ligation of blunt-ended molecules; (b) ligation of sticky-ended

4.3.2 Sticky ends increase the efficiency of ligation
The ligation reaction in Figure 4.20a shows two blunt-ended fragments being joined
together. Although this reaction can be carried out in the test tube, it is not very efficient.
This is because the ligase is unable to “catch hold” of the molecule to be ligated, and has
to wait for chance associations to bring the ends together. If possible, blunt end ligation
should be performed at high DNA concentrations, to increase the chances of the ends
of the molecules coming together in the correct way.
In contrast, ligation of complementary sticky ends is much more efficient. This is
because compatible sticky ends can base pair with one another by hydrogen bonding
(Figure 4.20b), forming a relatively stable structure for the enzyme to work on. If the
phosphodiester bonds are not synthesized fairly quickly then the sticky ends fall apart
again. These transient, base-paired structures do, however, increase the efficiency of
ligation by increasing the length of time the ends are in contact with one another.

4.3.3 Putting sticky ends onto a blunt-ended molecule
For the reasons detailed in the preceding section, compatible sticky ends are desirable
on the DNA molecules to be ligated together in a gene cloning experiment. Often these
sticky ends can be provided by digesting both the vector and the DNA to be cloned with
the same restriction endonuclease, or with different enzymes that produce the same
sticky end, but it is not always possible to do this. A common situation is where the
vector molecule has sticky ends, but the DNA fragments to be cloned are blunt-ended.
Under these circumstances one of three methods can be used to put the correct sticky
ends onto the DNA fragments.
Linkers
The first of these methods involves the use of linkers. These are short pieces of doublestranded DNA, of known nucleotide sequence, that are synthesized in the test tube.

Linkers and their use: (a) the structure of a typical linker; (b) the attachment of linkers to a blunt-ended molecule.

A typical linker is shown in Figure 4.21a. It is blunt-ended, but contains a restriction site,
BamHI in the example shown. DNA ligase can attach linkers to the ends of larger bluntended DNA molecules. Although a blunt end ligation, this particular reaction can be
performed very efficiently because synthetic oligonucleotides, such as linkers, can be
made in very large amounts and added into the ligation mixture at a high concentration.
More than one linker will attach to each end of the DNA molecule, producing the
chain structure shown in Figure 4.21b. However, digestion with BamHI cleaves the
chains at the recognition sequences, producing a large number of cleaved linkers and
the original DNA fragment, now carrying BamHI sticky ends. This modified fragment
is ready for ligation into a cloning vector restricted with BamHI.
Adaptors
There is one potential drawback with the use of linkers. Consider what would happen
if the blunt-ended molecule shown in Figure 4.21b contained one or more BamHI
recognition sequences. If this was the case, the restriction step needed to cleave the
linkers and produce the sticky ends would also cleave the blunt-ended molecule
(Figure 4.22). The resulting fragments will have the correct sticky ends, but that is no
consolation if the gene contained in the blunt-ended fragment has now been broken
into pieces.

The second method of attaching sticky ends to a blunt-ended molecule is designed
to avoid this problem. Adaptors, like linkers, are short synthetic oligonucleotides.
But unlike linkers, an adaptor is synthesized so that it already has one sticky end
(Figure 4.23a). The idea is of course to ligate the blunt end of the adaptor to the blunt
ends of the DNA fragment, to produce a new molecule with sticky ends. This may
appear to be a simple method but in practice a new problem arises. The sticky ends of individual adaptor molecules could base pair with each other to form dimers (Figure 4.23b),
so that the new DNA molecule is still blunt-ended (Figure 4.23c). The sticky ends
could be recreated by digestion with a restriction endonuclease, but that would defeat
the purpose of using adaptors in the first place.
The answer to the problem lies in the precise chemical structure of the ends of the
adaptor molecule. Normally the two ends of a polynucleotide strand are chemically
distinct, a fact that is clear from a careful examination of the polymeric structure of
DNA (Figure 4.24a). One end, referred to as the 5′ terminus, carries a phosphate group
(5′-P); the other, the 3′ terminus, has a hydroxyl group (3′-OH). In the double helix the
two strands are antiparallel (Figure 4.24b), so each end of a double-stranded molecule
consists of one 5′-P terminus and one 3′-OH terminus. Ligation takes place between
the 5′-P and 3′-OH ends (Figure 4.24c).
Adaptor molecules are synthesized so that the blunt end is the same as “natural”
DNA, but the sticky end is different. The 3′-OH terminus of the sticky end is the same
as usual, but the 5′-P terminus is modified: it lacks the phosphate group, and is in
fact a 5′-OH terminus (Figure 4.25a). DNA ligase is unable to form a phosphodiester
bridge between 5′-OH and 3′-OH ends. The result is that, although base pairing is
always occurring between the sticky ends of adaptor molecules, the association is never
stabilized by ligation (Figure 4.25b).
Adaptors can therefore be ligated to a blunt-ended DNA molecule but not to themselves. After the adaptors have been attached, the abnormal 5′-OH terminus is converted
to the natural 5′-P form by treatment with the enzyme polynucleotide kinase (p. 50),
producing a sticky-ended fragment that can be inserted into an appropriate vector.

Producing sticky ends by homopolymer tailing
The technique of homopolymer tailing offers a radically different approach to the
production of sticky ends on a blunt-ended DNA molecule. A homopolymer is
simply a polymer in which all the subunits are the same. A DNA strand made up entirely
of, say, deoxyguanosine is an example of a homopolymer, and is referred to as
polydeoxyguanosine or poly(dG).
Tailing involves using the enzyme terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (p. 50) to
add a series of nucleotides onto the 3′-OH termini of a double-stranded DNA molecule.
If this reaction is carried out in the presence of just one deoxyribonucleotide, a
homopolymer tail is produced (Figure 4.26a). Of course, to be able to ligate together

two tailed molecules, the homopolymers must be complementary. Frequently polydeoxycytosine (poly(dC)) tails are attached to the vector and poly(dG) to the DNA to
be cloned. Base pairing between the two occurs when the DNA molecules are mixed
(Figure 4.26b).
In practice, the poly(dG) and poly(dC) tails are not usually exactly the same length,
and the base-paired recombinant molecules that result have nicks as well as discontinuities (Figure 4.26c). Repair is therefore a two-step process, using Klenow polymerase
to fill in the nicks followed by DNA ligase to synthesize the final phosphodiester
bonds. This repair reaction does not always have to be performed in the test tube. If
the complementary homopolymer tails are longer than about 20 nucleotides, then quite
stable base-paired associations are formed. A recombinant DNA molecule, held together
by base pairing although not completely ligated, is often stable enough to be introduced
into the host cell in the next stage of the cloning experiment (see Figure 1.1). Once
inside the host, the cell’s own DNA polymerase and DNA ligase repair the recombinant
DNA molecule, completing the construction begun in the test tube.

4.3.4 Blunt end ligation with a DNA topoisomerase
A more sophisticated, but easier and generally more efficient way of carrying out blunt
end ligation, is to use a special type of enzyme called a DNA topoisomerase. In the cell,
DNA topoisomerases are involved in processes that require turns of the double helix to
be removed or added to a double-stranded DNA molecule. Turns are removed during
DNA replication in order to unwind the helix and enable each polynucleotide to be
replicated, and are added to newly synthesized circular molecules to introduce supercoiling. DNA topoisomerases are able to separate the two strands of a DNA molecule
without actually rotating the double helix. They achieve this feat by causing transient
single- or double-stranded breakages in the DNA backbone (Figure 4.27). DNA topoisomerases therefore have both nuclease and ligase activities.
To carry out blunt end ligation with a topoisomerase, a special type of cloning vector
is needed. This is a plasmid that has been linearized by the nuclease activity of the DNA
topoisomerase enzyme from vaccinia virus. The vaccinia topoisomerase cuts DNA
at the sequence CCCTT, which is present just once in the plasmid. After cutting the

plasmid, topoisomerase enzymes remain covalently bound to the resulting blunt ends.
The reaction can be stopped at this point, enabling the vector to be stored until it is
needed.
Cleavage by the topoisomerase results in 5′-OH and 3′-P termini (Figure 4.28a). If
the blunt-ended molecules to be cloned have been produced from a larger molecule
by cutting with a restriction enzyme, then they will have 5′-P and 3′-OH ends. Before
mixing these molecules with the vector, their terminal phosphates must be removed to
give 5′-OH ends that can ligate to the 3′-P termini of the vector. The molecules are
therefore treated with alkaline phosphatase (Figure 4.28b).
Adding the phosphatased molecules to the vector reactivates the bound topoisomerases, which proceed to the ligation phase of their reaction. Ligation occurs between
the 3′-P ends of the vectors and the 5′-OH ends of the phosphatased molecules. The
blunt-ended molecules therefore become inserted into the vectors. Only one strand is
ligated at each junction point (Figure 4.28c), but this is not a problem because the discontinuities will be repaired by cellular enzymes after the recombinant molecules have
been introduced into the host bacteria.

Transformation—the uptake of DNA by bacterial cells
Identification of recombinants
Introduction of phage DNA into bacterial cells
Identification of recombinant phages
Introduction of DNA into non-bacterial cells

The manipulations described in Chapter 4 allow the molecular biologist to create novel
recombinant DNA molecules. The next step in a gene cloning experiment is to introduce
these molecules into living cells, usually bacteria, which then grow and divide to produce
clones (see Figure 1.1). Strictly speaking, the word “cloning” refers only to the later stages
of the procedure, and not to the construction of the recombinant DNA molecule
itself.
Cloning serves two main purposes. First, it allows a large number of recombinant
DNA molecules to be produced from a limited amount of starting material. At the outset
only a few nanograms of recombinant DNA may be available, but each bacterium that
takes up a plasmid subsequently divides numerous times to produce a colony, each cell
of which contains multiple copies of the molecule. Several micrograms of recombinant
DNA can usually be prepared from a single bacterial colony, representing a thousandfold
increase over the starting amount (Figure 5.1). If the colony is used not as a source of
DNA but as an inoculum for a liquid culture, the resulting cells may provide milligrams
of DNA, a millionfold increase in yield. In this way cloning can supply the large amounts
of DNA needed for molecular biological studies of gene structure and expression
(Chapters 10 and 11).
The second important function of cloning can be described as purification. The
manipulations that result in a recombinant DNA molecule can only rarely be controlled
to the extent that no other DNA molecules are present at the end of the procedure. The

Unligated molecules rarely cause a problem because, even though they may be taken
up by bacterial cells, only under exceptional circumstances will they be replicated. It is
much more likely that enzymes within the host bacteria degrade these pieces of DNA.
Self-ligated vector molecules and incorrect recombinant plasmids are more important
because they are replicated just as efficiently as the desired molecule (Figure 5.2b). However, purification of the desired molecule can still be achieved through cloning because
it is extremely unusual for any one cell to take up more than one DNA molecule. Each
cell gives rise to a single colony, so each of the resulting clones consists of cells that all
contain the same molecule. Of course, different colonies contain different molecules:
some contain the desired recombinant DNA molecule, some have different recombinant molecules, and some contain self-ligated vector. The problem therefore becomes a
question of identifying the colonies that contain the correct recombinant plasmids.
This chapter is concerned with the way in which plasmid and phage vectors, and
recombinant molecules derived from them, are introduced into bacterial cells. During
the course of the chapter it will become apparent that selection for colonies containing recombinant molecules, as opposed to colonies containing self-ligated vector, is
relatively easy. The more difficult proposition of how to distinguish clones containing
the correct recombinant DNA molecule from all the other recombinant clones will be
tackled in Chapter 8.

5.1 Transformation—the uptake of DNA by
bacterial cells
Most species of bacteria are able to take up DNA molecules from the medium in which they
grow. Often a DNA molecule taken up in this way will be degraded, but occasionally it
is able to survive and replicate in the host cell. In particular this happens if the DNA
molecule is a plasmid with an origin of replication recognized by the host.

5.1.1 Not all species of bacteria are equally efficient at
DNA uptake
In nature, transformation is probably not a major process by which bacteria obtain
genetic information. This is reflected by the fact that in the laboratory only a few species
(notably members of the genera Bacillus and Streptococcus) can be transformed with ease.
Close study of these organisms has revealed that they possess sophisticated mechanisms
for DNA binding and uptake.
Most species of bacteria, including E. coli, take up only limited amounts of DNA
under normal circumstances. In order to transform these species efficiently, the bacteria
have to undergo some form of physical and/or chemical treatment that enhances their
ability to take up DNA. Cells that have undergone this treatment are said to be competent.

5.1.2 Preparation of competent E. coli cells
As with many breakthroughs in recombinant DNA technology, the key development as
far as transformation is concerned occurred in the early 1970s, when it was observed
that E. coli cells that had been soaked in an ice cold salt solution were more efficient
at DNA uptake than unsoaked cells. A solution of 50 mM calcium chloride (CaCl2) is
traditionally used, although other salts, notably rubidium chloride, are also effective.
Exactly why this treatment works is not understood. Possibly CaCl2 causes the DNA
to precipitate onto the outside of the cells, or perhaps the salt is responsible for some
kind of change in the cell wall that improves DNA binding. In any case, soaking in
CaCl2 affects only DNA binding, and not the actual uptake into the cell. When DNA is
added to treated cells, it remains attached to the cell exterior, and is not at this stage
transported into the cytoplasm (Figure 5.3). The actual movement of DNA into competent cells is stimulated by briefly raising the temperature to 42°C. Once again, the
exact reason why this heat shock is effective is not understood.

5.1.3 Selection for transformed cells
Transformation of competent cells is an inefficient procedure, however carefully the
cells have been prepared. Although 1 ng of the plasmid vector called pUC8 (p. 92) can
yield 1000–10,000 transformants, this represents the uptake of only 0.01% of all the
available molecules. Furthermore, 10,000 transformants is only a very small proportion of the total number of cells that are present in a competent culture. This last fact
means that some way must be found to distinguish a cell that has taken up a plasmid
from the many thousands that have not been transformed.
Uptake and stable retention of a plasmid is usually detected by looking for expression of the genes carried by the plasmid. For example, E. coli cells are normally
sensitive to the growth inhibitory effects of the antibiotics ampicillin and tetracycline.
However, cells that contain the plasmid pBR322 (p. 89), which was one of the first
cloning vectors to be developed back in the 1970s, are resistant to these antibiotics.
This is because pBR322 carries two sets of genes, one gene that codes for a b-lactamase
enzyme that modifies ampicillin into a form that is non-toxic to the bacterium, and a
second set of genes that code for enzymes that detoxify tetracycline. After a transformation experiment with pBR322, only those E. coli cells that have taken up a plasmid
are amp Rtet R and able to form colonies on an agar medium that contains ampicillin or
tetracycline (Figure 5.4); non-transformants, which are still amp Stet S, do not produce
colonies on the selective medium. Transformants and non-transformants are therefore
easily distinguished.

Phenotypic expression. Incubation at 37°C for 1 hour before plating out improves the survival of the transformants on
selective medium, because the bacteria have had time to begin synthesis of the antibiotic resistance enzymes.

Most plasmid cloning vectors carry at least one gene that confers antibiotic resistance
on the host cells, with selection of transformants being achieved by plating onto an agar
medium that contains the relevant antibiotic. Bear in mind, however, that resistance to
the antibiotic is not due merely to the presence of the plasmid in the transformed cells.
The resistance gene on the plasmid must also be expressed, so that the enzyme that
detoxifies the antibiotic is synthesized. Expression of the resistance gene begins immediately after transformation, but it will be a few minutes before the cell contains enough
of the enzyme to be able to withstand the toxic effects of the antibiotic. For this reason
the transformed bacteria should not be plated onto the selective medium immediately
after the heat shock treatment, but first placed in a small volume of liquid medium,
in the absence of antibiotic, and incubated for a short time. Plasmid replication and
expression can then get started, so that when the cells are plated out and encounter the
antibiotic, they will already have synthesized sufficient resistance enzymes to be able to
survive (Figure 5.5).

5.2 Identification of recombinants
Plating onto a selective medium enables transformants to be distinguished from nontransformants. The next problem is to determine which of the transformed colonies

comprise cells that contain recombinant DNA molecules, and which contain selfligated vector molecules (see Figure 5.2). With most cloning vectors, insertion of a
DNA fragment into the plasmid destroys the integrity of one of the genes present on
the molecule. Recombinants can therefore be identified because the characteristic
coded by the inactivated gene is no longer displayed by the host cells (Figure 5.6). We
will explore the general principles of insertional inactivation by looking at the different
methods used with the two cloning vectors mentioned in the previous section—pBR322
and pUC8.

5.2.1 Recombinant selection with pBR322—insertional
inactivation of an antibiotic resistance gene
pBR322 has several unique restriction sites that can be used to open up the vector before
insertion of a new DNA fragment (Figure 5.7a). BamHI, for example, cuts pBR322 at
just one position, within the cluster of genes that code for resistance to tetracycline. A
recombinant pBR322 molecule, one that carries an extra piece of DNA in the BamHI
site (Figure 5.7b), is no longer able to confer tetracycline resistance on its host, as one
of the necessary genes is now disrupted by the inserted DNA. Cells containing this
recombinant pBR322 molecule are still resistant to ampicillin, but sensitive to tetracycline
(amp Rtet S ).

(c) The colonies that grow on tetracycline medium are ampRtet R and therefore non-recombinants. Recombinants
(ampRtet S) do not grow, but their position on the ampicillin plate is now known.

Screening for pBR322 recombinants is performed in the following way. After transformation the cells are plated onto ampicillin medium and incubated until colonies
appear (Figure 5.8a). All of these colonies are transformants (remember, untransformed
cells are amp S and so do not produce colonies on the selective medium), but only a few
contain recombinant pBR322 molecules: most contain the normal, self-ligated plasmid.
To identify the recombinants the colonies are replica plated onto agar medium that
contains tetracycline (Figure 5.8b). After incubation, some of the original colonies
regrow, but others do not (Figure 5.8c). Those that do grow consist of cells that carry
the normal pBR322 with no inserted DNA and therefore a functional tetracycline

resistance gene cluster (amp Rtet R ). The colonies that do not grow on tetracycline agar
are recombinants (amp Rtet S ); once their positions are known, samples for further study
can be recovered from the original ampicillin agar plate.

5.2.2 Insertional inactivation does not always involve antibiotic
resistance
Although insertional inactivation of an antibiotic resistance gene provides an effective
means of recombinant identification, the method is made inconvenient by the need to
carry out two screenings, one with the antibiotic that selects for transformants, followed
by the second screen, after replica-plating, with the antibiotic that distinguishes recombinants. Most modern plasmid vectors therefore make use of a different system. An
example is pUC8 (Figure 5.9a), which carries the ampicillin resistance gene and a gene
called lacZ′, which codes for part of the enzyme b-galactosidase. Cloning with pUC8
involves insertional inactivation of the lacZ′ gene, with recombinants identified because
of their inability to synthesize b-galactosidase (Figure 5.9b).
b-Galactosidase is one of a series of enzymes involved in the breakdown of lactose to
glucose plus galactose. It is normally coded by the gene lacZ, which resides on the
E. coli chromosome. Some strains of E. coli have a modified lacZ gene, one that lacks
the segment referred to as lacZ′ and coding for the a-peptide portion of b-galactosidase
(Figure 5.10a). These mutants can synthesize the enzyme only when they harbor a
plasmid, such as pUC8, that carries the missing lacZ′ segment of the gene.
A cloning experiment with pUC8 involves selection of transformants on ampicillin
agar followed by screening for b-galactosidase activity to identify recombinants. Cells

that harbor a normal pUC8 plasmid are amp R and able to synthesize b-galactosidase
(Figure 5.9a); recombinants are also amp R but unable to make b-galactosidase
(Figure 5.9b).
Screening for b-galactosidase presence or absence is in fact quite easy. Rather than
assay for lactose being split to glucose and galactose, we test for a slightly different
reaction that is also catalyzed by b-galactosidase. This involves a lactose analog called
X-gal (5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-b-D-galactopyranoside) which is broken down by
b-galactosidase to a product that is colored deep blue. If X-gal (plus an inducer of
the enzyme such as isopropylthiogalactoside, IPTG) is added to the agar, along with
ampicillin, then non-recombinant colonies, the cells of which synthesize b-galactosidase,
will be colored blue, whereas recombinants with a disrupted lacZ′ gene and unable
to make b-galactosidase, will be white. This system, which is called Lac selection, is summarized in Figure 5.10b. Note that both ampicillin resistance and the presence or
absence of b-galactosidase are tested for on a single agar plate. The two screenings are
therefore carried out together and there is no need for the time-consuming replica-plating
step that is necessary with plasmids such as pBR322.

Chapter 5 Introduction of DNA into Living Cells

5.3 Introduction of phage DNA into bacterial cells
There are two different methods by which a recombinant DNA molecule constructed with
a phage vector can be introduced into a bacterial cell: transfection and in vitro packaging.

5.3.1 Transfection
Transfection is equivalent to transformation, the only difference being that phage DNA
rather than a plasmid is involved. Just as with a plasmid, the purified phage DNA, or
recombinant phage molecule, is mixed with competent E. coli cells and DNA uptake
induced by heat shock. Transfection is the standard method for introducing the doublestranded RF form of an M13 cloning vector into E. coli.

5.3.2 In vitro packaging of * cloning vectors
Transfection with e DNA molecules is not a very efficient process when compared with
the infection of a culture of cells with mature e phage particles. It would therefore be
useful if recombinant e molecules could be packaged into their e head-and-tail structures
in the test tube.
This may sound difficult but is actually relatively easy to achieve. Packaging requires
a number of different proteins coded by the e genome, but these can be prepared at a
high concentration from cells infected with defective e phage strains. Two different systems are in use. With the single strain system, the defective e phage carries a mutation
in the cos sites, so that these are not recognized by the endonuclease that normally
cleaves the e catenanes during phage replication (p. 21). This means that the defective
phage cannot replicate, though it does direct synthesis of all the proteins needed for
packaging. The proteins accumulate in the bacterium and can be purified from cultures
of E. coli infected with the mutated e. The protein preparation is then used for in vitro
packaging of recombinant e molecules (Figure 5.11a).
With the second system two defective e strains are needed. Both of these strains carry
a mutation in a gene for one of the components of the phage protein coat: with one
strain the mutation is in gene D, and with the second strain it is in gene E (see Figure 2.9).
Neither strain is able to complete an infection cycle in E. coli because in the absence of
the product of the mutated gene the complete capsid structure cannot be made. Instead
the products of all the other coat protein genes accumulate (Figure 5.11b). An in vitro
packaging mix can therefore be prepared by combining lysates of two cultures of cells,
one infected with the e D− strain, the other infected with the E − strain. The mixture now
contains all the necessary components for in vitro packaging.
With both systems, formation of phage particles is achieved simply by mixing the
packaging proteins with e DNA—assembly of the particles occurs automatically in
the test tube (Figure 5.11c). The packaged e DNA is then introduced into E. coli cells
simply by adding the assembled phages to the bacterial culture and allowing the normal
e infective process to take place.

5.3.3 Phage infection is visualized as plaques on an agar
medium
The final stage of the phage infection cycle is cell lysis (p. 18). If infected cells are spread onto
a solid agar medium immediately after addition of the phage particles, or immediately

lysates provide the complete set of capsid proteins and can package λ DNA molecules in the test tube.

after transfection with phage DNA, cell lysis can be visualized as plaques on a lawn of
bacteria (Figure 5.12a). Each plaque is a zone of clearing produced as the phages
lyse the cells and move on to infect and eventually lyse the neighboring bacteria
(Figure 5.12b).
Both e and M13 form plaques. With e these are true plaques, produced by cell lysis.
However, M13 plaques are slightly different as M13 does not lyse the host cells (p. 19).
Instead M13 causes a decrease in the growth rate of infected cells, sufficient to produce
a zone of relative clearing on a bacterial lawn. Although not true plaques, these zones
of clearing are visually identical to normal phage plaques (Figure 5.12c).
The end result of a gene cloning experiment using a e or M13 vector is therefore an
agar plate covered in phage plaques. Each plaque is derived from a single transfected or
infected cell and therefore contains identical phage particles. These may contain self-ligated
vector molecules, or they may be recombinants.

5.4 Identification of recombinant phages
A variety of ways of distinguishing recombinant plaques have been devised, the following being the most important.

5.4.1 Insertional inactivation of a lacZ′′ gene carried by the
phage vector
All M13 cloning vectors (p. 94), as well as several e vectors, carry a copy of the lacZ′
gene. Insertion of new DNA into this gene inactivates b-galactosidase synthesis, just
as with the plasmid vector pUC8. Recombinants are distinguished by plating cells onto
X-gal agar: plaques comprising normal phages are blue; recombinant plaques are clear
(Figure 5.13a).

5.4.2 Insertional inactivation of the * cI gene
Several types of e cloning vector have unique restriction sites in the cI gene (map position 38 on Figure 2.9). Insertional inactivation of this gene causes a change in plaque
morphology. Normal plaques appear “turbid”, whereas recombinants with a disrupted
cI gene are “clear” (Figure 5.13b). The difference is readily apparent to the experienced eye.

5.4.3 Selection using the Spi phenotype
e phages cannot normally infect E. coli cells that already possess an integrated form
of a related phage called P2. e is therefore said to be Spi+ (sensitive to P2 prophage

inhibition). Some e cloning vectors are designed so that insertion of new DNA causes
a change from Spi+ to Spi−, enabling the recombinants to infect cells that carry P2
prophages. Such cells are used as the host for cloning experiments with these vectors;
only recombinants are Spi− so only recombinants form plaques (Figure 5.13c).

5.4.4 Selection on the basis of * genome size
The e packaging system, which assembles the mature phage particles, can only insert
DNA molecules of between 37 and 52 kb into the head structure. Anything less than
37 kb is not packaged. Many e vectors have been constructed by deleting large segments
of the e DNA molecule (p. 98) and so are less than 37 kb in length. These can only be
packaged into mature phage particles after extra DNA has been inserted, bringing the
total genome size up to 37 kb or more (Figure 5.13d). Therefore, with these vectors only
recombinant phages are able to replicate.

Chapter 5 Introduction of DNA into Living Cells

5.5 Introduction of DNA into non-bacterial cells
Ways of introducing DNA into yeast, fungi, animals, and plants are also needed if these
organisms are to be used as the hosts for gene cloning. Strictly speaking, these processes
are not “transformation”, as that term has a specific meaning that applies only to uptake
of DNA by bacteria. However, molecular biologists have forgotten this over the years
and “transformation” is now used to describe uptake of DNA by any organism.
In general terms, soaking cells in salt is effective only with a few species of bacteria,
although treatment with lithium chloride or lithium acetate does enhance DNA uptake
by yeast cells, and is frequently used in the transformation of Saccharomyces cerevisiae.
However, for most higher organisms, more sophisticated methods are needed.

5.5.1 Transformation of individual cells
With most organisms the main barrier to DNA uptake is the cell wall. Cultured animal
cells, which usually lack cell walls, are easily transformed, especially if the DNA is
precipitated onto the cell surface with calcium phosphate (Figure 5.14a) or enclosed in
liposomes that fuse with the cell membrane (Figure 5.14b). For other types of cell the
answer is often to remove the cell wall. Enzymes that degrade yeast, fungal, and plant
cell walls are available, and under the right conditions intact protoplasts can be obtained
(Figure 5.14c). Protoplasts generally take up DNA quite readily, but transformation can
be stimulated by special techniques such as electroporation, during which the cells are
subjected to a short electrical pulse, thought to induce the transient formation of pores
in the cell membrane, through which DNA molecules are able to enter the cell. After
transformation the protoplasts are washed to remove the degradative enzymes and the
cell wall spontaneously re-forms.
In contrast to the transformation systems described so far, there are two physical
methods for introducing DNA into cells. The first of these is microinjection, which
makes use of a very fine pipette to inject DNA molecules directly into the nucleus of the
cells to be transformed (Figure 5.15a). This technique was initially applied to animal
cells but has subsequently been successful with plant cells. The second method involves
bombardment of the cells with high velocity microprojectiles, usually particles of gold
or tungsten that have been coated with DNA. These microprojectiles are fired at the
cells from a particle gun (Figure 5.15b). This unusual technique is termed biolistics and
has been used with a number of different types of cell.

5.5.2 Transformation of whole organisms
With animals and plants the desired end product might not be transformed cells, but a
transformed organism. Plants are relatively easy to regenerate from cultured cells,
though problems have been experienced in developing regeneration procedures for
monocotyledonous species such as cereals and grasses. A single transformed plant
cell can therefore give rise to a transformed plant, which carries the cloned DNA in
every cell, and passes the cloned DNA on to its progeny following flowering and seed
formation (see Figure 7.13). Animals, of course, cannot be regenerated from cultured
cells, so obtaining transformed animals requires a rather more subtle approach. One
technique with mammals such as mice is to remove fertilized eggs from the oviduct,
to microinject DNA, and then to reimplant the transformed cells into the mother’s
reproductive tract. We will look more closely at these methods for obtaining transformed animals in Chapter 13.

The basic experimental techniques involved in gene cloning have now been described.
In Chapters 3, 4, and 5 we have seen how DNA is purified from cell extracts, how
recombinant DNA molecules are constructed in the test tube, how DNA molecules are
reintroduced into living cells, and how recombinant clones are distinguished. Now we
must look more closely at the cloning vector itself, in order to consider the range of
vectors available to the molecular biologist, and to understand the properties and uses
of each individual type.
The greatest variety of cloning vectors exists for use with E. coli as the host organism. This is not surprising in view of the central role that this bacterium has played
in basic research over the past 50 years. The tremendous wealth of information that
exists concerning the microbiology, biochemistry, and genetics of E. coli has meant
that virtually all fundamental studies of gene structure and function were initially
carried out with this bacterium as the experimental organism. Even when a eukaryote
is being studied, E. coli is still used as the workhorse for preparation of cloned DNA
for sequencing, and for construction of recombinant genes that will subsequently be
placed back in the eukaryotic host in order to study their function and expression.
In recent years, gene cloning and molecular biological research have become mutually
synergistic—breakthroughs in gene cloning have acted as a stimulus to research, and
the needs of research have spurred on the development of new, more sophisticated
cloning vectors.

Chapter 6 Cloning Vectors for E. coli

89

In this chapter the most important types of E. coli cloning vector will be described,
and their specific uses outlined. In Chapter 7, cloning vectors for yeast, fungi, plants, and
animals will be considered.

6.1 Cloning vectors based on E. coli plasmids
The simplest cloning vectors, and the ones most widely used in gene cloning, are those
based on small bacterial plasmids. A large number of different plasmid vectors are available
for use with E. coli, many obtainable from commercial suppliers. They combine ease of
purification with desirable properties such as high transformation efficiency, convenient
selectable markers for transformants and recombinants, and the ability to clone reasonably
large (up to about 8 kb) pieces of DNA. Most “routine” gene cloning experiments make
use of one or other of these plasmid vectors.
One of the first vectors to be developed was pBR322, which was introduced in
Chapter 5 to illustrate the general principles of transformant selection and recombinant
identification (p. 77). Although pBR322 lacks the more sophisticated features of the
newest cloning vectors, and so is no longer used extensively in research, it still illustrates
the important, fundamental properties of any plasmid cloning vector. We will therefore
begin our study of E. coli vectors by looking more closely at pBR322.

6.1.1 The nomenclature of plasmid cloning vectors
The name “pBR322” conforms with the standard rules for vector nomenclature:
l
l

l

“p” indicates that this is indeed a plasmid.
“BR” identifies the laboratory in which the vector was originally constructed
(BR stands for Bolivar and Rodriguez, the two researchers who developed pBR322).
“322” distinguishes this plasmid from others developed in the same laboratory
(there are also plasmids called pBR325, pBR327, pBR328, etc.).

6.1.2 The useful properties of pBR322
The genetic and physical map of pBR322 (Figure 6.1) gives an indication of why this
plasmid was such a popular cloning vector.
The first useful feature of pBR322 is its size. In Chapter 2 it was stated that a cloning
vector ought to be less than 10 kb in size, to avoid problems such as DNA breakdown

during purification. pBR322 is 4363 bp, which means that not only can the vector itself
be purified with ease, but so can recombinant DNA molecules constructed with it. Even
with 6 kb of additional DNA, a recombinant pBR322 molecule is still a manageable size.
The second feature of pBR322 is that, as described in Chapter 5, it carries two sets
of antibiotic resistance genes. Either ampicillin or tetracycline resistance can be used as
a selectable marker for cells containing the plasmid, and each marker gene includes
unique restriction sites that can be used in cloning experiments. Insertion of new DNA
into pBR322 that has been restricted with PstI, PvuI, or ScaI inactivates the amp R gene,
and insertion using any one of eight restriction endonucleases (notably BamHI and
HindIII) inactivates tetracycline resistance. This great variety of restriction sites that
can be used for insertional inactivation means that pBR322 can be used to clone DNA
fragments with any of several kinds of sticky end.
A third advantage of pBR322 is that it has a reasonably high copy number. Generally
there are about 15 molecules present in a transformed E. coli cell, but this number can
be increased, up to 1000–3000, by plasmid amplification in the presence of a protein
synthesis inhibitor such as chloramphenicol (p. 39). An E. coli culture therefore provides
a good yield of recombinant pBR322 molecules.

6.1.3 The pedigree of pBR322
The remarkable convenience of pBR322 as a cloning vector did not arise by chance.
The plasmid was in fact designed in such a way that the final construct would possess
these desirable properties. An outline of the scheme used to construct pBR322 is shown
in Figure 6.2a. It can be seen that its production was a tortuous business that required
full and skilfull use of the DNA manipulative techniques described in Chapter 4. A
summary of the result of these manipulations is provided in Figure 6.2b, from which it
can be seen that pBR322 comprises DNA derived from three different naturally occurring
plasmids. The amp R gene originally resided on the plasmid R1, a typical antibiotic
resistance plasmid that occurs in natural populations of E. coli (p. 17). The tet R gene is
derived from R6-5, a second antibiotic-resistant plasmid. The replication origin of
pBR322, which directs multiplication of the vector in host cells, is originally from
pMB1, which is closely related to the colicin-producing plasmid ColE1 (p. 17).

6.1.4 More sophisticated E. coli plasmid cloning vectors
pBR322 was developed in the late 1970s, the first research paper describing its use being
published in 1977. Since then many other plasmid cloning vectors have been constructed, the majority of these derived from pBR322 by manipulations similar to those
summarized in Figure 6.2a. One of the first of these was pBR327, which was produced
by removing a 1089 bp segment from pBR322. This deletion left the amp R and tet R
genes intact, but changed the replicative and conjugative abilities of the resulting plasmid.
As a result, pBR327 differs from pBR322 in two important ways:
l

pBR327 has a higher copy number than pBR322, being present at about 30–45
molecules per E. coli cell. This is not of great relevance as far as plasmid yield is
concerned, as both plasmids can be amplified to copy numbers greater than 1000.
However, the higher copy number of pBR327 in normal cells makes this vector
more suitable if the aim of the experiment is to study the function of the cloned
gene. In these cases gene dosage becomes important, because the more copies there

are of a cloned gene, the more likely it is that the effect of the cloned gene on the
host cell will be detectable. pBR327, with its high copy number, is therefore a
better choice than pBR322 for this kind of work.
The deletion also destroys the conjugative ability of pBR322, making pBR327
a non-conjugative plasmid that cannot direct its own transfer to other E. coli
cells. This is important for biological containment, averting the possibility of a
recombinant pBR327 molecule escaping from the test tube and colonizing bacteria
in the gut of a careless molecular biologist. In contrast, pBR322 could theoretically
be passed to natural populations of E. coli by conjugation, though in fact pBR322
also has safeguards (though less sophisticated ones) to minimize the chances of this
happening. pBR327 is, however, preferable if the cloned gene is potentially
harmful should an accident occur.

Although pBR327, like pBR322, is no longer widely used, its properties have been
inherited by most of today’s modern plasmid vectors. There are a great number of these,
and it would be pointless to attempt to describe them all. Two additional examples will
suffice to illustrate the most important features.

pUC8—a Lac selection plasmid
This vector was mentioned in Chapter 5 when identification of recombinants by insertional inactivation of the b-galactosidase gene was described (p. 79). pUC8 (Figure 6.3a)
is descended from pBR322, although only the replication origin and the amp R gene
remain. The nucleotide sequence of the amp R gene has been changed so that it no longer
contains the unique restriction sites: all these cloning sites are now clustered into a short
segment of the lacZ′ gene carried by pUC8.
pUC8 has three important advantages that have led to it becoming one of the most
popular E. coli cloning vectors. The first of these is fortuitous: the manipulations
involved in construction of pUC8 were accompanied by a chance mutation, within the
origin of replication, which results in the plasmid having a copy number of 500–700
even before amplification. This has a significant effect on the yield of cloned DNA
obtainable from E. coli cells transformed with recombinant pUC8 plasmids.
The second advantage is that identification of recombinant cells can be achieved by
a single step process, by plating onto agar medium containing ampicillin plus X-gal
(p. 79). With both pBR322 and pBR327, selection of recombinants is a two-step procedure, requiring replica plating from one antibiotic medium to another (p. 78). A
cloning experiment with pUC8 can therefore be carried out in half the time needed
with pBR322 or pBR327.
The third advantage of pUC8 lies with the clustering of the restriction sites, which
allows a DNA fragment with two different sticky ends (say EcoRI at one end and BamHI
at the other) to be cloned without resorting to additional manipulations such as linker
attachment (Figure 6.3b). Other pUC vectors carry different combinations of restriction

sites and provide even greater flexibility in the types of DNA fragment that can be cloned
(Figure 6.3c). Furthermore, the restriction site clusters in these vectors are the same as
the clusters in the equivalent M13mp series of vectors (p. 95). DNA cloned into a member of the pUC series can therefore be transferred directly to its M13mp counterpart,
enabling the cloned gene to be obtained as single-stranded DNA (Figure 6.3d).
pGEM3Z—in vitro transcription of cloned DNA
pGEM3Z (Figure 6.4a) is very similar to a pUC vector: it carries the amp R and lacZ′
genes, the latter containing a cluster of restriction sites, and it is almost exactly the same
size. The distinction is that pGEM3Z has two additional short pieces of DNA, each of
which acts as the recognition site for attachment of an RNA polymerase enzyme. These
two promoter sequences lie on either side of the cluster of restriction sites used for
introduction of new DNA into the pGEM3Z molecule. This means that if a recombinant
pGEM3Z molecule is mixed with purified RNA polymerase in the test tube, transcription occurs and RNA copies of the cloned fragment are synthesized (Figure 6.4b). The
RNA that is produced could be used as a hybridization probe (p. 133), or might be
required for experiments aimed at studying RNA processing (e.g., the removal of introns)
or protein synthesis.
The promoters carried by pGEM3Z and other vectors of this type are not the standard
sequences recognized by the E. coli RNA polymerase. Instead, one of the promoters is
specific for the RNA polymerase coded by T7 bacteriophage and the other for the RNA
polymerase of SP6 phage. These RNA polymerases are synthesized during infection of
E. coli with one or other of the phages and are responsible for transcribing the phage
genes. They are chosen for use in in vitro transcription as they are very active enzymes
– remember that the entire lytic infection cycle takes only 20 minutes (p. 18), so the

Part I The Basic Principles of Gene Cloning and DNA Analysis

94

phage genes must be transcribed very quickly. These polymerases are able to synthesize
1–2 mg of RNA per minute, substantially more than can be produced by the standard
E. coli enzyme.

6.2 Cloning vectors based on M13 bacteriophage
The most essential requirement for any cloning vector is that it has a means of replicating in the host cell. For plasmid vectors this requirement is easy to satisfy, as relatively
short DNA sequences are able to act as plasmid origins of replication, and most, if not
all, of the enzymes needed for replication are provided by the host cell. Elaborate manipulations, such as those that resulted in pBR322 (see Figure 6.2a), are therefore possible
so long as the final construction has an intact, functional replication origin.
With bacteriophages such as M13 and e, the situation as regards replication is
more complex. Phage DNA molecules generally carry several genes that are essential for
replication, including genes coding for components of the phage protein coat and phagespecific DNA replicative enzymes. Alteration or deletion of any of these genes will
impair or destroy the replicative ability of the resulting molecule. There is therefore
much less freedom to modify phage DNA molecules, and generally phage cloning vectors
are only slightly different from the parent molecule.

6.2.1 How to construct a phage cloning vector
The problems in constructing a phage cloning vector are illustrated by considering M13.
The normal M13 genome is 6.4 kb in length, but most of this is taken up by ten closely
packed genes (Figure 6.5), each essential for the replication of the phage. There is only
a single 507-nucleotide intergenic sequence into which new DNA could be inserted
without disrupting one of these genes, and this region includes the replication origin
which must itself remain intact. Clearly there is only limited scope for modifying the
M13 genome.
The first step in construction of an M13 cloning vector was to introduce the lacZ′
gene into the intergenic sequence. This gave rise to M13mp1, which forms blue plaques
on X-gal agar (Figure 6.6a). M13mp1 does not possess any unique restriction sites in
the lacZ′ gene. It does, however, contain the hexanucleotide GGATTC near the start of
the gene. A single nucleotide change would make this GAATTC, which is an EcoRI site.
This alteration was carried out using in vitro mutagenesis (p. 200), resulting in M13mp2

(Figure 6.6b). M13mp2 has a slightly altered lacZ′ gene (the sixth codon now specifies
asparagine instead of aspartic acid), but the b-galactosidase enzyme produced by cells
infected with M13mp2 is still perfectly functional.
The next step in the development of M13 vectors was to introduce additional restriction sites into the lacZ′ gene. This was achieved by synthesizing in the test tube a short
oligonucleotide, called a polylinker, which consists of a series of restriction sites and has
EcoRI sticky ends (Figure 6.7a). This polylinker was inserted into the EcoRI site of
M13mp2, to give M13mp7 (Figure 6.7b), a more complex vector with four possible
cloning sites (EcoRI, BamHI, SalI, and PstI). The polylinker is designed so that it does

not totally disrupt the lacZ′ gene: a reading frame is maintained throughout the polylinker,
and a functional, though altered, b-galactosidase enzyme is still produced.
The most sophisticated M13 vectors have more complex polylinkers inserted into the
lacZ′ gene. An example is M13mp8, which has the same series of restriction sites as the
plasmid pUC8 (p. 92). As with the plasmid vector, one advantage of M13mp8 is its
ability to take DNA fragments with two different sticky ends.

6.2.2 Hybrid plasmid–M13 vectors
Although M13 vectors are very useful for the production of single-stranded versions of
cloned genes, they do suffer from one disadvantage. There is a limit to the size of DNA
fragment that can be cloned with an M13 vector, with 1500 bp generally being looked
on as the maximum capacity, though fragments up to 3 kb have occasionally been
cloned. To get around this problem a number of hybrid vectors (“phagemids”) have
been developed by combining a part of the M13 genome with plasmid DNA.
An example is provided by pEMBL8 (Figure 6.8a), which was made by transferring
into pUC8 a 1300 bp fragment of the M13 genome. This piece of M13 DNA contains

the signal sequence recognized by the enzymes that convert the normal double-stranded
M13 molecule into single-stranded DNA before secretion of new phage particles. This
signal sequence is still functional even though detached from the rest of the M13
genome, so pEMBL8 molecules are also converted into single-stranded DNA and secreted
as defective phage particles (Figure 6.8b). All that is necessary is that the E. coli cells used
as hosts for a pEMBL8 cloning experiment are subsequently infected with normal M13 to
act as a helper phage, providing the necessary replicative enzymes and phage coat proteins. pEMBL8, being derived from pUC8, has the polylinker cloning sites within the lacZ′
gene, so recombinant plaques can be identified in the standard way on agar containing
X-gal. With pEMBL8, single-stranded versions of cloned DNA fragments up to 10 kb
in length can be obtained, greatly extending the range of the M13 cloning system.

6.3 Cloning vectors based on 8 bacteriophage
Two problems had to be solved before e-based cloning vectors could be developed:
l

l

The e DNA molecule can be increased in size by only about 5%, representing the
addition of only 3 kb of new DNA. If the total size of the molecule is more than
52 kb, then it cannot be packaged into the e head structure and infective phage
particles are not formed. This severely limits the size of a DNA fragment that can
be inserted into an unmodified e vector (Figure 6.9a).
The e genome is so large that it has more than one recognition sequence for
virtually every restriction endonuclease. Restriction cannot be used to cleave the
normal e molecule in a way that will allow insertion of new DNA, because the
molecule would be cut into several small fragments that would be very unlikely
to re-form a viable e genome on religation (Figure 6.9b).

In view of these difficulties it is perhaps surprising that a wide variety of e cloning
vectors have been developed, their primary use being to clone large pieces of DNA,
from 5 to 25 kb, much too big to be handled by plasmid or M13 vectors.

6.3.1 Segments of the * genome can be deleted without
impairing viability
The way forward for the development of e cloning vectors was provided by the discovery that a large segment in the central region of the e DNA molecule can be removed
without affecting the ability of the phage to infect E. coli cells. Removal of all or part of
this non-essential region, between positions 20 and 35 on the map shown in Figure 2.9,
decreases the size of the resulting e molecule by up to 15 kb. This means that as much
as 18 kb of new DNA can now be added before the cut-off point for packaging is
reached (Figure 6.10).
This “non-essential” region in fact contains most of the genes involved in integration
and excision of the e prophage from the E. coli chromosome. A deleted e genome is
therefore non-lysogenic and can follow only the lytic infection cycle. This in itself is
desirable for a cloning vector as it means induction is not needed before plaques are
formed (p. 40).

6.3.2 Natural selection can be used to isolate modified * that
lack certain restriction sites
Even a deleted e genome, with the non-essential region removed, has multiple recognition sites for most restriction endonucleases. This is a problem that is often encountered when a new vector is being developed. If just one or two sites need to be removed,
then the technique of in vitro mutagenesis (p. 200) can be used. For example, an EcoRI
site, GAATTC, could be changed to GGATTC, which is not recognized by the enzyme.
However, in vitro mutagenesis was in its infancy when the first e vectors were under
development, and even today would not be an efficient means of changing more than a
few sites in a single molecule.
Instead, natural selection was used to provide strains of e that lack the unwanted
restriction sites. Natural selection can be brought into play by using as a host an E. coli
strain that produces EcoRI. Most e DNA molecules that invade the cell are destroyed
by this restriction endonuclease, but a few survive and produce plaques. These are
mutant phages, from which one or more EcoRI sites have been lost spontaneously
(Figure 6.11). Several cycles of infection will eventually result in e molecules that lack
all or most of the EcoRI sites.

6.3.3 Insertion and replacement vectors
Once the problems posed by packaging constraints and by the multiple restriction sites
had been solved, the way was open for the development of different types of e-based
cloning vectors. The first two classes of vector to be produced were e insertion and e
replacement (or substitution) vectors.

Insertion vectors
With an insertion vector (Figure 6.12a), a large segment of the non-essential region has
been deleted, and the two arms ligated together. An insertion vector possesses at least
one unique restriction site into which new DNA can be inserted. The size of the DNA
fragment that an individual vector can carry depends, of course, on the extent to which
the non-essential region has been deleted. Two popular insertion vectors are:
l

Egt10 (Figure 6.12b), which can carry up to 8 kb of new DNA, inserted into a
unique EcoRI site located in the cI gene. Insertional inactivation of this gene means
that recombinants are distinguished as clear rather than turbid plaques (p. 83).

restriction sites within a polylinker inactivates the lacZ′ gene carried by the vector.
Recombinants give clear rather than blue plaques on X-gal agar.

Replacement vectors
A e replacement vector has two recognition sites for the restriction endonuclease used
for cloning. These sites flank a segment of DNA that is replaced by the DNA to be
cloned (Figure 6.13a). Often the replaceable fragment (or “stuffer fragment” in cloning
jargon) carries additional restriction sites that can be used to cut it up into small pieces,
so that its own re-insertion during a cloning experiment is very unlikely. Replacement
vectors are generally designed to carry larger pieces of DNA than insertion vectors can
handle. Recombinant selection is often on the basis of size, with non-recombinant vectors
being too small to be packaged into e phage heads (p. 84).
An example of a replacement vectors is:
l

EEMBL4 (Figure 6.13b) can carry up to 20 kb of inserted DNA by replacing a
segment flanked by pairs of EcoRI, BamHI, and SalI sites. Any of these three
restriction endonucleases can be used to remove the stuffer fragment, so DNA
fragments with a variety of sticky ends can be cloned. Recombinant selection with
eEMBL4 can be on the basis of size, or can utilize the Spi phenotype (p. 83).

6.3.4 Cloning experiments with * insertion or replacement
vectors
A cloning experiment with a e vector can proceed along the same lines as with a plasmid vector—the e molecules are restricted, new DNA is added, the mixture is ligated,
and the resulting molecules used to transfect a competent E. coli host (Figure 6.14a).
This type of experiment requires that the vector be in its circular form, with the cos
sites hydrogen bonded to each other.
Although satisfactory for many purposes, a procedure based on transfection is not
particularly efficient. A greater number of recombinants will be obtained if one or two
refinements are introduced. The first is to use the linear form of the vector. When the
linear form of the vector is digested with the relevant restriction endonuclease, the
left and right arms are released as separate fragments. A recombinant molecule can

(Figure 6.14b). Ligation results in several molecular arrangements, including catenanes
comprising left arm–DNA–right arm repeated many times (Figure 6.14b). If the inserted
DNA is the correct size, then the cos sites that separate these structures will be the right
distance apart for in vitro packaging (p. 81). Recombinant phage are therefore
produced in the test tube and can be used to infect an E. coli culture. This strategy, in particular the use of in vitro packaging, results in a large number of recombinant plaques.

6.3.5 Long DNA fragments can be cloned using a cosmid
The final and most sophisticated type of e-based vector is the cosmid. Cosmids are
hybrids between a phage DNA molecule and a bacterial plasmid, and their design
centers on the fact that the enzymes that package the e DNA molecule into the phage
protein coat need only the cos sites in order to function (p. 21). The in vitro packaging
reaction works not only with e genomes, but also with any molecule that carries cos sites
separated by 37–52 kb of DNA.
A cosmid is basically a plasmid that carries a cos site (Figure 6.15a). It also needs a
selectable marker, such as the ampicillin resistance gene, and a plasmid origin of replication, as cosmids lack all the e genes and so do not produce plaques. Instead colonies are
formed on selective media, just as with a plasmid vector.

A typical cosmid and the way it is used to clone long fragments of DNA.

A cloning experiment with a cosmid is carried out as follows (Figure 6.15b). The
cosmid is opened at its unique restriction site and new DNA fragments inserted. These
fragments are usually produced by partial digestion with a restriction endonuclease, as
total digestion almost invariably results in fragments that are too small to be cloned with
a cosmid. Ligation is carried out so that catenanes are formed. Providing the inserted
DNA is the right size, in vitro packaging cleaves the cos sites and places the recombinant
cosmids in mature phage particles. These e phage are then used to infect an E. coli
culture, though of course plaques are not formed. Instead, infected cells are plated onto
a selective medium and antibiotic-resistant colonies are grown. All colonies are recombinants, as non-recombinant linear cosmids are too small to be packaged into e heads.

6.4 8 and other high-capacity vectors enable
genomic libraries to be constructed
The main use of all e-based vectors is to clone DNA fragments that are too long to be
handled by plasmid or M13 vectors. A replacement vector, such as eEMBL4, can carry
up to 20 kb of new DNA, and some cosmids can manage fragments up to 40 kb. This

compares with a maximum insert size of about 8 kb for most plasmids and less than 3 kb
for M13 vectors.
The ability to clone such long DNA fragments means that genomic libraries can be
generated. A genomic library is a set of recombinant clones that contains all of the DNA
present in an individual organism. An E. coli genomic library, for example, contains all
the E. coli genes, so any desired gene can be withdrawn from the library and studied.
Genomic libraries can be retained for many years, and propagated so that copies can be
sent from one research group to another.
The big question is how many clones are needed for a genomic library? The answer
can be calculated with the formula:
N=

ln(1 − p)
A
aD
ln 1 −
C
bF

where N is the number of clones that are required, p is probability that any given gene
will be present, a is the average size of the DNA fragments inserted into the vector, and
b is the total size of the genome.
Table 6.1 shows the number of clones needed for genomic libraries of a variety of
organisms, constructed using a e replacement vector or a cosmid. For humans and other
mammals, several hundred thousand clones are required. It is by no means impossible
to obtain several hundred thousand clones, and the methods used to identify a clone
carrying a desired gene (Chapter 8) can be adapted to handle such large numbers, so
genomic libraries of these sizes are by no means unreasonable. However, ways of reducing the number of clones needed for mammalian genomic libraries are continually being
sought.
One solution is to develop new cloning vectors able to handle longer DNA inserts.
The most popular of these vectors are bacterial artificial chromosomes (BACs), which
are based on the F plasmid (p. 16). The F plasmid is relatively large and vectors derived
from it have a higher capacity than normal plasmid vectors. BACs can handle DNA
inserts up to 300 kb in size, reducing the size of the human genomic library to just
30,000 clones. Other high-capacity vectors have been constructed from bacteriophage
P1, which has the advantage over e of being able to squeeze 110 kb of DNA into its

104

Part I The Basic Principles of Gene Cloning and DNA Analysis

capsid structure. Cosmid-type vectors based on P1 have been designed and used to clone
DNA fragments ranging in size from 75 to 100 kb. Vectors that combine the features
of P1 vectors and BACs, called P1-derived artificial chromosomes (PACs), also have a
capacity of up to 300 kb.

6.5 Vectors for other bacteria
Cloning vectors have also been developed for several other species of bacteria, including Streptomyces, Bacillus, and Pseudomonas. Some of these vectors are based on
plasmids specific to the host organism, and some on broad host range plasmids able to
replicate in a variety of bacterial hosts. A few are derived from bacteriophages specific
to these organisms. Antibiotic resistance genes are generally used as the selectable
markers. Most of these vectors are very similar to E. coli vectors in terms of their general
purposes and uses.

7.1 Vectors for yeast and other fungi
7.2 Cloning vectors for higher plants
7.3 Cloning vectors for animals

Most cloning experiments are carried out with E. coli as the host, and the widest variety
of cloning vectors are available for this organism. E. coli is particularly popular when the
aim of the cloning experiment is to study the basic features of molecular biology such as
gene structure and function. However, under some circumstances it may be desirable
to use a different host for a gene cloning experiment. This is especially true in biotechnology (Chapter 13), where the aim may not be to study a gene, but to use cloning
to obtain large amounts of an important pharmaceutical protein (e.g., a hormone such
as insulin), or to change the properties of the organism (e.g., to introduce herbicide
resistance into a crop plant). We must therefore consider cloning vectors for organisms
other than E. coli.

7.1 Vectors for yeast and other fungi
The yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae is one of the most important organisms in
biotechnology. As well as its role in brewing and breadmaking, yeast has been used as
a host organism for the production of important pharmaceuticals from cloned genes
(p. 237). Development of cloning vectors for yeast was initially stimulated by the discovery of a plasmid that is present in most strains of S. cerevisiae (Figure 7.1). The
2 fm plasmid, as it is called, is one of only a very limited number of plasmids found in
eukaryotic cells.

7.1.1 Selectable markers for the 2 (m plasmid
The 2 fm plasmid is an excellent basis for a cloning vector. It is 6 kb in size, which is
ideal for a vector, and exists in the yeast cell at a copy number of between 70 and 200.
Replication makes use of a plasmid origin, several enzymes provided by the host cell,
and the proteins coded by the REP1 and REP2 genes carried by the plasmid.
However, all is not perfectly straightforward in using the 2 fm plasmid as a cloning
vector. First, there is the question of a selectable marker. Some yeast cloning vectors
carry genes conferring resistance to inhibitors such as methotrexate and copper, but
most of the popular yeast vectors make use of a radically different type of selection
system. In practice, a normal yeast gene is used, generally one that codes for an enzyme
involved in amino acid biosynthesis. An example is the gene LEU2, which codes for
b-isopropyl-malate dehydrogenase, one of the enzymes involved in the conversion of
pyruvic acid to leucine.
In order to use LEU2 as a selectable marker, a special kind of host organism is
needed. The host must be an auxotrophic mutant that has a non-functional LEU2 gene.
Such a leu2− yeast is unable to synthesize leucine and can survive only if this amino acid
is supplied as a nutrient in the growth medium (Figure 7.2a). Selection is possible
because transformants contain a plasmid-borne copy of the LEU2 gene, and so are able
to grow in the absence of the amino acid. In a cloning experiment, cells are plated out
onto minimal medium, which contains no added amino acids. Only transformed cells
are able to survive and form colonies (Figure 7.2b).

7.1.2 Vectors based on the 2 (m plasmid—yeast episomal
plasmids
Vectors derived from the 2 fm plasmid are called yeast episomal plasmids (YEps). Some
YEps contain the entire 2 fm plasmid, others include just the 2 fm origin of replication.
An example of the latter type is YEp13 (Figure 7.3).
YEp13 illustrates several general features of yeast cloning vectors. First, it is a shuttle
vector. As well as the 2 fm origin of replication and the selectable LEU2 gene, YEp13
also includes the entire pBR322 sequence, and can therefore replicate and be selected
for in both yeast and E. coli. There are several lines of reasoning behind the use of
shuttle vectors. One is that it might be difficult to recover the recombinant DNA
molecule from a transformed yeast colony. This is not such a problem with YEps, which
are present in yeast cells primarily as plasmids, but with other yeast vectors, which
may integrate into one of the yeast chromosomes (p. 108), purification might be impossible. This is a disadvantage because in many cloning experiments purification of

recombinant DNA is essential in order for the correct construct to be identified by, for
example, DNA sequencing.
The standard procedure when cloning in yeast is therefore to perform the initial
cloning experiment with E. coli, and to select recombinants in this organism.
Recombinant plasmids can then be purified, characterized, and the correct molecule
introduced into yeast (Figure 7.4).

7.1.3 A YEp may insert into yeast chromosomal DNA
The word “episomal” indicates that a YEp can replicate as an independent plasmid, but
also implies that integration into one of the yeast chromosomes can occur (see the
definition of “episome” on p. 14). Integration occurs because the gene carried on the
vector as a selectable marker is very similar to the mutant version of the gene present
in the yeast chromosomal DNA. With YEp13, for example, homologous recombination
can occur between the plasmid LEU2 gene and the yeast mutant LEU2 gene, resulting

in insertion of the entire plasmid into one of the yeast chromosomes (Figure 7.5). The
plasmid may remain integrated, or a later recombination event may result in it being
excised again.

7.1.4 Other types of yeast cloning vector
In addition to YEps, there are several other types of cloning vector for use with S.
cerevisiae. Two important ones are as follows:
l

Yeast integrative plasmids (YIps) are basically bacterial plasmids carrying a
yeast gene. An example is YIp5, which is pBR322 with an inserted URA3 gene

(Figure 7.6a). This gene codes for orotidine-5′-phosphate decarboxylase
(an enzyme that catalyzes one of the steps in the biosynthesis pathway for
pyrimidine nucleotides) and is used as a selectable marker in exactly the same
way as LEU2. A YIp cannot replicate as a plasmid as it does not contain any parts
of the 2 fm plasmid, and instead depends for its survival on integration into yeast
chromosomal DNA. Integration occurs just as described for a YEp (Figure 7.5).
Yeast replicative plasmids (YRps) are able to multiply as independent plasmids
because they carry a chromosomal DNA sequence that includes an origin of
replication. Replication origins are known to be located very close to several
yeast genes, including one or two which can be used as selectable markers. YRp7
(Figure 7.6b) is an example of a replicative plasmid. It is made up of pBR322 plus
the yeast gene TRP1. This gene, which is involved in tryptophan biosynthesis, is
located adjacent to a chromosomal origin of replication. The yeast DNA fragment
present in YRp7 contains both TRP1 and the origin.

Three factors come into play when deciding which type of yeast vector is most suitable for a particular cloning experiment. The first of these is transformation frequency,
a measure of the number of transformants that can be obtained per microgram of
plasmid DNA. A high transformation frequency is necessary if a large number of recombinants are needed, or if the starting DNA is in short supply. YEps have the highest
transformation frequency, providing between 10,000 and 100,000 transformed cells
per fg. YRps are also quite productive, giving between 1000 and 10,000 transformants
per fg, but a YIp yields less than 1000 transformants per fg, and only 1–10 unless
special procedures are used. The low transformation frequency of a YIp reflects the fact
that the rather rare chromosomal integration event is necessary before the vector can
be retained in a yeast cell.
The second important factor is copy number. YEps and YRps have the highest copy
numbers: 20–50 and 5–100, respectively. In contrast, a YIp is usually present at just
one copy per cell. These figures are important if the objective is to obtain protein from
the cloned gene, as the more copies there are of the gene the greater the expected yield
of the protein product.
So why would one ever wish to use a YIp? The answer is because YIps produce very
stable recombinants, as loss of a YIp that has become integrated into a chromosome
occurs at only a very low frequency. In contrast, YRp recombinants are extremely unstable,
the plasmids tending to congregate in the mother cell when a daughter cell buds off, so
the daughter cell is non-recombinant. YEp recombinants suffer from similar problems,
though an improved understanding of the biology of the 2 fm plasmid has enabled

more stable YEps to be developed in recent years. Nevertheless, a YIp is the vector of
choice if the needs of the experiment dictate that the recombinant yeast cells must retain
the cloned gene for long periods in culture.

7.1.5 Artificial chromosomes can be used to clone long pieces
of DNA in yeast
The final type of yeast cloning vector to consider is the yeast artificial chromosome
(YAC), which presents a totally different approach to gene cloning. The development
of YACs was a spin-off from fundamental research into the structure of eukaryotic
chromosomes, work that has identified the key components of a chromosome as being
(Figure 7.7):
l

l

l

The centromere, which is required for the chromosome to be distributed correctly
to daughter cells during cell division;
Two telomeres, the structures at the ends of a chromosome, which are needed
in order for the ends to be replicated correctly and which also prevent the
chromosome from being nibbled away by exonucleases;
The origins of replication, which are the positions along the chromosome at which
DNA replication initiates, similar to the origin of replication of a plasmid.

Once chromosome structure had been defined in this way, the possibility arose that
the individual components might be isolated by recombinant DNA techniques and then
joined together again in the test tube, creating an artificial chromosome. As the DNA
molecules present in natural yeast chromosomes are several hundred kilobases in length,
it might be possible with an artificial chromosome to clone long pieces of DNA.
The structure and use of a YAC vector
Several YAC vectors have been developed but each one is constructed along the same
lines, with pYAC3 being a typical example (Figure 7.8a). At first glance, pYAC3 does not
look much like an artificial chromosome, but on closer examination its unique features
become apparent. pYAC3 is essentially a pBR322 plasmid into which a number of yeast
genes have been inserted. Two of these genes, URA3 and TRP1, have been encountered
already as the selectable markers for YIp5 and YRp7, respectively. As in YRp7, the DNA
fragment that carries TRP1 also contains an origin of replication, but in pYAC3 this
fragment is extended even further to include the sequence called CEN4, which is the
DNA from the centromere region of chromosome 4. The TRP1–origin–CEN4 fragment
therefore contains two of the three components of the artificial chromosome.
The third component, the telomeres, is provided by the two sequences called TEL.
These are not themselves complete telomere sequences, but once inside the yeast nucleus
they act as seeding sequences onto which telomeres will be built. This just leaves one
other part of pYAC3 that has not been mentioned: SUP4, which is the selectable marker
into which new DNA is inserted during the cloning experiment.

The cloning strategy with pYAC3 is as follows (Figure 7.8b). The vector is first
restricted with a combination of BamHI and SnaBI, cutting the molecule into three
fragments. The fragment flanked by BamHI sites is discarded, leaving two arms, each
bounded by one TEL sequence and one SnaBI site. The DNA to be cloned, which must
have blunt ends (SnaBI is a blunt end cutter, recognizing the sequence TACGTA), is
ligated between the two arms, producing the artificial chromosome. Protoplast transformation (p. 85) is then used to introduce the artificial chromosome into S. cerevisiae.
The yeast strain that is used is a double auxotrophic mutant, trp1− ura3−, which is converted to trp1+ ura3+ by the two markers on the artificial chromosome. Transformants
are therefore selected by plating onto minimal medium, on which only cells containing
a correctly constructed artificial chromosome are able to grow. Any cell transformed
with an incorrect artificial chromosome, containing two left or two right arms rather
than one of each, is not able to grow on minimal medium as one of the markers is
absent. The presence of the insert DNA in the vector can be checked by testing for insertional inactivation of SUP4, which is carried out by a simple color test: white colonies
are recombinants, red colonies are not.
Applications for YAC vectors
The initial stimulus in designing artificial chromosomes came from yeast geneticists who
wanted to use them to study various aspects of chromosome structure and behavior,

Part I The Basic Principles of Gene Cloning and DNA Analysis

112

for instance to examine the segregation of chromosomes during meiosis. These experiments established that artificial chromosomes are stable during propagation in yeast
cells and raised the possibility that they might be used as vectors for genes that are too
long to be cloned as a single fragment in an E. coli vector. Several important mammalian genes are greater than 100 kb in length (e.g., the human cystic fibrosis gene
is 250 kb), beyond the capacity of all but the most sophisticated E. coli cloning systems
(p. 102), but well within the range of a YAC vector. Yeast artificial chromosomes therefore opened the way to studies of the functions and modes of expression of genes that
had previously been intractable to analysis by recombinant DNA techniques. A new
dimension to these experiments was provided by the discovery that under some
circumstances YACs can be propagated in mammalian cells, enabling the functional
analysis to be carried out in the organism in which the gene normally resides.
Yeast artificial chromosomes are equally important in the production of gene
libraries. Recall that with fragments of 300 kb, the maximum insert size for the highest
capacity E. coli vector, some 30,000 clones are needed for a human gene library
(p. 103). However, YAC vectors are routinely used to clone 600 kb fragments, and
special types are able to handle DNA up to 1400 kb in length, the latter bringing the size
of a human gene library down to just 6500 clones. Unfortunately these “mega-YACs”
have run into problems with insert stability, the cloned DNA sometimes becoming
rearranged by intramolecular recombination. Nevertheless, YACs have been of immense
value in providing long pieces of cloned DNA for use in large-scale DNA sequencing
projects.

7.1.6 Vectors for other yeasts and fungi
Cloning vectors for other species of yeast and fungi are needed for basic studies of the
molecular biology of these organisms and to extend the possible uses of yeasts and fungi
in biotechnology. Episomal plasmids based on the S. cerevisiae 2 fm plasmid are able
to replicate in a few other types of yeast, but the range of species is not broad enough
for 2 fm vectors to be of general value. In any case, the requirements of biotechnology
are better served by integrative plasmids, equivalent to YIps, as these provide stable
recombinants that can be grown for long periods in bioreactors (p. 225). Efficient integrative vectors are now available for a number of species, including yeasts such as Pichia
pastoris and Kluveromyces lactis, and the filamentous fungi such as Aspergillus nidulans
and Neurospora crassa.

7.2 Cloning vectors for higher plants
Cloning vectors for higher plants were developed in the 1980s and their use has led to
the genetically modified (GM) crops that are in the headlines today. We will examine
the genetic modification of crops and other plants in Chapter 15. Here we look at the
cloning vectors and how they are used.
Three types of vector system have been used with varying degrees of success with
higher plants:

7.2.1 Agrobacterium tumefaciens—nature’s smallest genetic
engineer
Although no naturally occurring plasmids are known in higher plants, one bacterial
plasmid, the Ti plasmid of Agrobacterium tumefaciens, is of great importance.
A. tumefaciens is a soil microorganism that causes crown gall disease in many species
of dicotyledonous plants. Crown gall occurs when a wound on the stem allows A.
tumefaciens bacteria to invade the plant. After infection the bacteria cause a cancerous
proliferation of the stem tissue in the region of the crown (Figure 7.9).
The ability to cause crown gall disease is associated with the presence of the Ti (tumor
inducing) plasmid within the bacterial cell. This is a large (greater than 200 kb) plasmid
that carries numerous genes involved in the infective process (Figure 7.10a). A remarkable feature of the Ti plasmid is that, after infection, part of the molecule is integrated
into the plant chromosomal DNA (Figure 7.10b). This segment, called the T-DNA, is
between 15 and 30 kb in size, depending on the strain. It is maintained in a stable form
in the plant cell and is passed on to daughter cells as an integral part of the chromosomes. But the most remarkable feature of the Ti plasmid is that the T-DNA contains
eight or so genes that are expressed in the plant cell and are responsible for the cancerous properties of the transformed cells. These genes also direct synthesis of unusual
compounds, called opines, that the bacteria use as nutrients (Figure 7.10c). In short,
A. tumefaciens genetically engineers the plant cell for its own purposes.
Using the Ti plasmid to introduce new genes into a plant cell
It was realized very quickly that the Ti plasmid could be used to transport new genes
into plant cells. All that would be necessary would be to insert the new genes into the
T-DNA and then the bacterium could do the hard work of integrating them into the
plant chromosomal DNA. In practice this has proved a tricky proposition, mainly
because the large size of the Ti plasmid makes manipulation of the molecule very
difficult.
The main problem is, of course, that a unique restriction site is an impossibility with
a plasmid 200 kb in size. Novel strategies have to be developed for inserting new DNA
into the plasmid. Two are in general use:
l

The binary vector strategy (Figure 7.11) is based on the observation that the
T-DNA does not need to be physically attached to the rest of the Ti plasmid.

A two-plasmid system, with the T-DNA on a relatively small molecule, and the
rest of the plasmid in normal form, is just as effective at transforming plant cells.
In fact, some strains of A. tumefaciens, and related agrobacteria, have natural
binary plasmid systems. The T-DNA plasmid is small enough to have a unique
restriction site and to be manipulated using standard techniques.
The co-integration strategy (Figure 7.12) uses an entirely new plasmid, based
on an E. coli vector, but carrying a small portion of the T-DNA. The homology
between the new molecule and the Ti plasmid means that if both are present in
the same A. tumefaciens cell, recombination can integrate the E. coli plasmid into
the T-DNA region. The gene to be cloned is therefore inserted into a unique
restriction site on the small E. coli plasmid, introduced into A. tumefaciens cells
carrying a Ti plasmid, and the natural recombination process left to integrate the
new gene into the T-DNA. Infection of the plant leads to insertion of the new
gene, along with the rest of the T-DNA, into the plant chromosomes.

Production of transformed plants with the Ti plasmid
If A. tumefaciens bacteria that contain an engineered Ti plasmid are introduced into a
plant in the natural way, by infection of a wound in the stem, then only the cells in
the resulting crown gall will possess the cloned gene (Figure 7.13a). This is obviously
of little value to the biotechnologist. Instead a way of introducing the new gene into
every cell in the plant is needed.
There are several solutions, the simplest being to infect not the mature plant but a
culture of plant cells or protoplasts (p. 85) in liquid medium (Figure 7.13b). Plant cells
and protoplasts whose cell walls have re-formed can be treated in the same way as
microorganisms: for example, they can be plated onto a selective medium in order to

isolate transformants. A mature plant regenerated from transformed cells will contain
the cloned gene in every cell and will pass the cloned gene to its offspring. However,
regeneration of a transformed plant can occur only if the Ti vector has been “disarmed”
so that the transformed cells do not display cancerous properties. Disarming is possible
because the cancer genes, all of which lie in the T-DNA, are not needed for the infection process, infectivity being controlled mainly by the virulence region of the Ti
plasmid. In fact, the only parts of the T-DNA that are involved in infection are two
25 bp repeat sequences found at the left and right borders of the region integrated into
the plant DNA. Any DNA placed between these two repeat sequences will be treated as
“T-DNA” and transferred to the plant. It is therefore possible to remove all the cancer
genes from the normal T-DNA, and replace them with an entirely new set of genes,
without disturbing the infection process.
A number of disarmed Ti cloning vectors are now available, a typical example being
the binary vector pBIN19 (Figure 7.14). The left and right T-DNA borders present in
this vector flank a copy of the lacZ′ gene, containing a number of cloning sites, and a
kanamycin resistance gene that functions after integration of the vector sequences into
the plant chromosome. As with a yeast shuttle vector (p. 106), the initial manipulations

that result in insertion of the gene to be cloned into pBIN19 are carried out in E. coli,
the correct recombinant pBIN19 molecule then being transferred to A. tumefaciens and
thence into the plant. Transformed plant cells are selected by plating onto agar medium
containing kanamycin.
The Ri plasmid
Over the years there has also been interest in developing plant cloning vectors based on
the Ri plasmid of Agrobacterium rhizogenes. Ri and Ti plasmids are very similar, the
main difference being that transfer of the T-DNA from an Ri plasmid to a plant results
not in a crown gall but in hairy root disease, typified by a massive proliferation of a
highly branched root system. The possibility of growing transformed roots at high
density in liquid culture has been explored by biotechnologists as a potential means
of obtaining large amounts of protein from genes cloned in plants (p. 242).
Limitations of cloning with Agrobacterium plasmids
Higher plants are divided into two broad categories, the monocots and the dicots.
Several factors have combined to make it much easier to clone genes in dicots such as
tomato, tobacco, potato, peas, and beans, but much more difficult to obtain the same
results with monocots. This has been frustrating because monocots include wheat,
barley, rice, and maize, which are the most important crop plants and hence the most
desirable targets for genetic engineering projects.
The main difficulty stems from the fact that in nature A. tumefaciens and A. rhizogenes
infect only dicotyledonous plants; monocots are outside of the normal host range.
For some time it was thought that this natural barrier was insurmountable and that
monocots were totally resistant to transformation with Ti and Ri vectors, but eventually artificial techniques for achieving T-DNA transfer were devised. However, this
was not the end of the story. Transformation with an Agrobacterium vector normally
involves regeneration of an intact plant from a transformed protoplast, cell, or callus
culture. The ease with which a plant can be regenerated depends very much on the
particular species involved and, once again, the most difficult plants are the monocots. Attempts to circumvent this problem have centered on the use of biolistics—
bombardment with microprojectiles (p. 85)—to introduce plasmid DNA directly into
plant embryos. Although this is a fairly violent transformation procedure it does not
appear to be too damaging for the embryos, which still continue their normal development program to produce mature plants. The approach has been successful with maize
and several other important monocots.

7.2.2 Cloning genes in plants by direct gene transfer
Biolistics circumvents the need to use Agrobacterium as the means of transferring DNA
into the plant cells. Direct gene transfer takes the process one step further and dispenses
with the Ti plasmid altogether.
Direct gene transfer into the nucleus
Direct gene transfer is based on the observation, first made in 1984, that a supercoiled
bacterial plasmid, although unable to replicate in a plant cell on its own, can become
integrated by recombination into one of the plant chromosomes. The recombination
event is poorly understood but is almost certainly distinct from the processes responsible for T-DNA integration. It is also distinct from the chromosomal integration of a
yeast vector (p. 107), as there is no requirement for a region of similarity between the
bacterial plasmid and the plant DNA. In fact, integration appears to occur randomly at
any position in any of the plant chromosomes (Figure 7.15).
Direct gene transfer therefore makes use of supercoiled plasmid DNA, possibly a
simple bacterial plasmid, into which an appropriate selectable marker (e.g., a kanamycin
resistance gene) and the gene to be cloned have been inserted. Biolistics is frequently
used to introduce the plasmid DNA into plant embryos, but if the species being
engineered can be regenerated from protoplasts or single cells, then other strategies,
possibly more efficient than biolistics, are possible.
One method involves resuspending protoplasts in a viscous solution of polyethylene
glycol, a polymeric, negatively charged compound that is thought to precipitate DNA
onto the surfaces of the protoplasts and to induce uptake by endocytosis (Figure 7.16).
Electroporation (p. 85) is also sometimes used to increase transformation frequency.
After treatment, protoplasts are left for a few days in a solution that encourages
regeneration of the cell walls. The cells are then spread onto selective medium to identify
transformants and to provide callus cultures from which intact plants can be grown
(exactly as described for the Agrobacterium system, Figure 7.13b).

Plant protoplasts

Transfer of genes into the chloroplast genome
If biolistics is used to introduce DNA in a plant embryo, then some particles may
penetrate one or more of the chloroplasts present in the cells. Chloroplasts contain their
own genomes, distinct from (and much shorter) than the DNA molecules in the nucleus,
and under some circumstances plasmid DNA can become integrated into this chloroplast
genome. Unlike the integration of DNA into nuclear chromosomes, integration into the
chloroplast genome will not occur randomly. Instead the DNA to be cloned must be
flanked by sequences similar to the region of the chloroplast genome into which the
DNA is to be inserted, so that insertion can take place by homologous recombination
(see p. 107). Each of these flanking sequences must be 500 bp or so in length. A low level
of chloroplast transformation can also be achieved after PEG-induced DNA delivery
into protoplasts if the plasmid that is taken up carries these flanking sequences.
A plant cell contains tens of chloroplasts, and probably only one per cell becomes
transformed, so the inserted DNA must carry a selectable marker such as the kanamycin
resistance gene, and the embryos must be treated with the antibiotic for a considerable
period to ensure that the transformed genomes propagate within the cell. Although this
means that chloroplast transformation is a difficult method to carry out successfully, it
could become an important adjunct to the more traditional methods for obtaining GM
crops. As each cell has many chloroplasts, but only one nucleus, a gene inserted into the
chloroplast genome is likely to be expressed at a higher level than one placed in the
nucleus. This is particularly important when the engineered plants are to be used for
production of pharmaceutical proteins (Chapter 13). So far the approach has been most
successful with tobacco but chloroplast transformation has also been achieved with more
useful crops such as soybean and cotton.

7.2.3 Attempts to use plant viruses as cloning vectors
Modified versions of e and M13 bacteriophages are important cloning vectors for E. coli
(Chapter 6). Most plants are subject to viral infection, so could viruses be used to clone
genes in plants? If they could, then they would be much more convenient to use than
other types of vector, because with many viruses transformation can be achieved simply
by rubbing the virus DNA onto the surface of a leaf. The natural infection process then
spreads the virus throughout the plant.
The potential of plant viruses as cloning vectors has been explored for several years
but without great success. One problem is that the vast majority of plant viruses have
genomes not of DNA but of RNA. RNA viruses are not so useful as potential cloning vectors because manipulations with RNA are more difficult to carry out. Only
two classes of DNA virus are known to infect higher plants, the caulimoviruses and
geminiviruses, and neither is ideally suited for gene cloning.

120

Part I The Basic Principles of Gene Cloning and DNA Analysis

Caulimovirus vectors
Although one of the first successful plant genetic engineering experiments, back in 1984,
used a caulimovirus vector to clone a new gene into turnip plants, two general difficulties with these viruses have limited their usefulness.
The first is that the total size of a caulimovirus genome is, like that of e, constrained
by the need to package it into its protein coat. Even after deletion of non-essential
sections of the virus genome, the capacity for carrying inserted DNA is still very limited.
Recent research has shown that it might be possible to circumvent this problem by
adopting a helper virus strategy, similar to that used with phagemids (p. 96). In this
strategy, the cloning vector is a cauliflower mosaic virus (CaMV) genome that lacks
several of the essential genes, which means that it can carry a large DNA insert but
cannot by itself direct infection. Plants are inoculated with the vector DNA along with
a normal CaMV genome. The normal viral genome provides the genes needed for the
cloning vector to be packaged into virus proteins and spread through the plant.
This approach has considerable potential, but does not solve the second problem,
which is the extremely narrow host range of caulimoviruses. This restricts cloning experiments to just a few plants, mainly brassicas such as turnips, cabbages, and cauliflowers.
Caulimoviruses have, however, been important in genetic engineering as the source of
highly active promoters that work in all plants and that are used to obtain expression
of genes introduced by Ti plasmid cloning or direct gene transfer.
Geminivirus vectors
What of the geminiviruses? These are particularly interesting because their natural
hosts include plants such as maize and wheat, and they could therefore be potential
vectors for these and other monocots. But geminiviruses have presented their own set
of difficulties, one problem being that during the infection cycle the genomes of some
geminiviruses undergo rearrangements and deletions, which would scramble up any
additional DNA that has been inserted, an obvious disadvantage for a cloning vector.
Research over the years has addressed these problems, and geminiviruses are beginning
to find some specialist applications in plant gene cloning. One of these is in virusinduced gene silencing (VIGS), a technique used to investigate the functions of individual plant genes. This method exploits one of the natural defence mechanisms that
plants use to protect themselves against viral attack. This method, called RNA silencing,
results in degradation of viral mRNAs. If one of the viral RNAs is transcribed from a
cloned gene contained within a geminivirus genome, then not only the viral transcripts
but also the cellular mRNAs derived from the plant’s copy of the gene are degraded
(Figure 7.17). The plant gene therefore becomes silenced and the effect of its inactivation on the phenotype of the plant can be studied.

7.3 Cloning vectors for animals
Considerable effort has been put into the development of vector systems for cloning
genes in animal cells. These vectors are needed in biotechnology for the synthesis of
recombinant protein from genes that are not expressed correctly when cloned in E. coli
or yeast (Chapter 13), and methods for cloning in humans are being sought by clinical
molecular biologists attempting to devise techniques for gene therapy (p. 259), in which
a disease is treated by introduction of a cloned gene into the patient.
The clinical aspect has meant that most attention has been directed at cloning systems
for mammals, but important progress has also been made with insects. Cloning in insects

is interesting because it makes use of a novel type of vector that we have not met so far.
We will therefore examine insect vectors before concluding the chapter with an overview of the cloning methods used with mammals.

7.3.1 Cloning vectors for insects
The fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster, has been and still is one of the most important
model organisms used by biologists. Its potential was first recognized by the famous
geneticist Thomas Hunt Morgan, who in 1910 started to carry out genetic crosses
between fruit flies with different eye colors, body shapes, and other inherited characteristics. These experiments led to the techniques still used today for gene mapping in
insects and other animals. More recently, the discovery that the homeotic selector genes
of Drosophila—the genes that control the overall body plan of the fly—are closely
related to equivalent genes in mammals, has led to D. melanogaster being used as a
model for the study of human developmental processes. The importance of the fruit fly
in modern biology makes it imperative that vectors for cloning genes in this organism
are available.
P elements as cloning vectors for Drosophila
The development of cloning vectors for Drosophila has taken a different route to that
followed with bacteria, yeast, plants, and mammals. No plasmids are known in
Drosophila and although fruit flies are, like all organisms, susceptible to infection with
viruses, these have not been used as the basis for cloning vectors. Instead, cloning in
Drosophila makes use of a transposon called the P element.
Transposons are common in all types of organism. They are short pieces of DNA
(usually less than 10 kb in length) that can move from one position to another in the
chromosomes of a cell. P elements, which are one of several types of transposon in
Drosophila, are 2.9 kb in length and contain three genes flanked by short inverted repeat
sequences at either end of the element (Figure 7.18a). The genes code for transposase,
the enzyme that carries out the transposition process, and the inverted repeats form the
recognition sequences that enable the enzyme to identify the two ends of the inserted
transposon.
As well as moving from one site to another within a single chromosome, P elements
can also jump between chromosomes, or between a plasmid carrying a P element
and one of the fly’s chromosomes (Figure 7.18b). The latter is the key to the use of P

a cloning site (R) that disrupts its transposase
gene. The right-hand P element has an intact
transposase gene but cannot itself transpose
because it is “wings-clipped”—it lacks terminal
inverted repeats.

elements as cloning vectors. The vector is a plasmid that carries two P elements, one of
which contains the insertion site for the DNA that will be cloned. Insertion of the new
DNA into this P element results in disruption of its transposase gene, so this element is
inactive. The second P element carried by the plasmid is therefore one that has an intact
version of the transposase gene. Ideally this second element should not itself be transferred
to the Drosophila chromosomes, so it has its “wings clipped”: its inverted repeats are
removed so that the transposase does not recognize it as being a real P element (Figure 7.17c).
Once the gene to be cloned has been inserted into the vector, the plasmid DNA is
microinjected into fruit fly embryos. The transposase from the wings-clipped P element
directs transfer of the engineered P element into one of the fruit fly chromosomes. If this
happens within a germline nucleus, then the adult fly that develops from the embryo will
carry copies of the cloned gene in all its cells. P element cloning was first developed in
the 1980s and has made a number of important contributions to Drosophila genetics.
Cloning vectors based on insect viruses
Although virus vectors have not been developed for cloning genes in Drosophila, one
type of virus, the baculovirus, has played an important role in gene cloning with other
insects. The main use of baculovirus vectors is in the production of recombinant protein, and we will return to them when we consider this topic in Chapter 13.

7.3.2 Cloning in mammals
At present, gene cloning in mammals is carried out for one of three reasons:
l

To achieve a gene knockout, which is an important technique used to help
determine the function of an unidentified gene (p. 213). These experiments are
usually carried out with rodents such as mice.

For production of recombinant protein in a mammalian cell culture, and in the
related technique of pharming, which involves genetic engineering of a farm
animal so that it synthesizes an important protein such as a pharmaceutical, often
in its milk (p. 241).
In gene therapy, in which human cells are engineered in order to treat a disease
(p. 259).

Viruses as cloning vectors for mammals
For many years it was thought that viruses would prove to be the key to cloning in
mammals. This expectation has only partially been realized. The first cloning experiment
involving mammalian cells was carried out in 1979 with a vector based on simian virus
40 (SV40). This virus is capable of infecting several mammalian species, following a
lytic cycle in some hosts and a lysogenic cycle in others. The genome is 5.2 kb in size
(Figure 7.19a) and contains two sets of genes, the “early” genes, expressed early in the
infection cycle and coding for proteins involved in viral DNA replication, and the “late”
genes, coding for viral capsid proteins. SV40 suffers from the same problem as e and the
plant caulimoviruses, in that packaging constraints limit the amount of new DNA that
can be inserted into the genome. Cloning with SV40 therefore involves replacing one
or more of the existing genes with the DNA to be cloned. In the original experiment a
segment of the late gene region was replaced (Figure 7.19b), but early gene replacement is also an option.
In the years since 1979, a number of other types of virus have been used to clone
genes in mammals. These include:
l

l

Adenoviruses, which enable DNA fragments of up to 8 kb to be cloned, longer
than is possible with an SV40 vector, though adenoviruses are more difficult to
handle because their genomes are bigger.
Papillomaviruses, which also have a relatively high capacity for inserted DNA.
Bovine papillomavirus (BPV), which causes warts on cattle, is particularly
attractive because it has an unusual infection cycle in mouse cells, taking the form
of a multicopy plasmid with about 100 molecules present per cell. It does not

cause the death of the mouse cell, and BPV molecules are passed to daughter cells
on cell division, giving rise to a permanently transformed cell line. Shuttle vectors
consisting of BPV and E. coli sequences, and capable of replication in both mouse
and bacterial cells, have been used for the production of recombinant proteins in
mouse cell lines.
Adeno-associated virus (AAV), which is unrelated to adenovirus but often found
in the same infected tissues, because AAV makes use of some of the proteins
synthesized by adenovirus in order to complete its replication cycle. In the absence
of this helper virus, the AAV genome inserts into its host’s DNA. With most
integrative viruses this is a random event, but AAV has the unusual property of
always inserting at the same position, within human chromosome 19. Knowing
exactly where the cloned gene will be in the host genome is important if the
outcome of the cloning experiment must be checked rigorously, as is the case in
applications such as gene therapy. AAV vectors are therefore looked on as having
major potential in this area.
Retroviruses, which are the most commonly-used vectors for gene therapy.
Although they insert at random positions, the resulting integrants are very stable,
which means that the therapeutic effects of the cloned gene will persist for some
time. We will return to gene therapy in Chapter 14.

Gene cloning without a vector
One of the reasons why virus vectors have not become widespread in mammalian gene
cloning is because it was discovered in the early 1990s that the most effective way of
transferring new genes into mammalian cells is by microinjection. Although a difficult
procedure to carry out, microinjection of bacterial plasmids, or linear DNA copies of
genes, into mammalian nuclei results in the DNA being inserted into the chromosomes,
possibly as multiple copies in a tandem, head-to-tail arrangement (Figure 7.20). This
procedure is generally looked on as more satisfactory than the use of a viral vector
because it avoids the possibility that viral DNA will infect the cells and cause defects of
one kind or another.
Microinjection of DNA is the basis to creation of a transgenic animal, one that
contains a cloned gene in all of its cells. A transgenic mouse can be generated by microinjection of a fertilized egg cell which is subsequently cultured in vitro for several cell
divisions and then implanted into a foster mother. Alternatively, an embryonic stem
(ES) cell can be used. These are obtained from within an early embryo and, unlike most
mammalian cells, are totipotent, meaning that their developmental pattern is not preset and cells descended from them can form many different structures in the adult
mouse. After microinjection, the ES cell is placed back in an embryo which is implanted
into the foster mother. The resulting mouse is a chimera, comprising a mixture of
engineered and non-engineered cells, because the embryo that receives the ES cell also
contains a number of ordinary cells that contribute, along with the ES cell, to the
make-up of the adult mouse. Non-chimeric mice, which contain the cloned gene in all
their cells, are obtained by allowing the chimera to reproduce, as some of the offspring
will be derived from egg cells that contain the cloned gene.

The problem of selection
Direct selection
Identification of a clone from a gene library
Methods for clone identification

In the preceding chapters we have examined the basic methodology used to clone genes,
and surveyed the range of vector types that are used with bacteria, yeast, plants, and animals.
Now we must look at the methods available for obtaining a clone of an individual,
specified gene. This is the critical test of a gene cloning experiment, success or failure
often depending on whether or not a strategy can be devised by which clones of the
desired gene can be selected directly, or alternatively, distinguished from other recombinants. Once this problem has been resolved, and a clone has been obtained, the molecular biologist is able to make use of a wide variety of different techniques that will
extract information about the gene. The most important of these will be described in
Chapters 10 and 11.

8.1 The problem of selection
The problem faced by the molecular biologist wishing to obtain a clone of a single,
specified gene was illustrated in Figure 1.4. Even the simplest organisms, such as E. coli,
contain several thousand genes, and a restriction digest of total cell DNA produces
not only the fragment carrying the desired gene, but also many other fragments carrying all the other genes (Figure 8.1a). During the ligation reaction there is no selection
for an individual fragment: numerous different recombinant DNA molecules are produced, all containing different pieces of DNA (Figure 8.1b). Consequently, a variety of

recombinant clones are obtained after transformation and plating out (Figure 8.1c).
Somehow the correct one must be identified.

8.1.1 There are two basic strategies for obtaining the clone
you want
Although there are many different procedures by which the desired clone can be
obtained, all are variations on two basic themes:
l

l

Direct selection for the desired gene (Figure 8.2a), which means that the cloning
experiment is designed in such a way that the only clones that are obtained are
clones of the required gene. Almost invariably, selection occurs at the plating-out
stage.
Identification of the clone from a gene library (Figure 8.2b), which entails an
initial “shotgun” cloning experiment, to produce a clone library representing all or
most of the genes present in the cell, followed by analysis of the individual clones
to identify the correct one.

In general terms, direct selection is the preferred method, as it is quick and usually
unambiguous. However, as we shall see, it is not applicable to all genes, and techniques
for clone identification are therefore very important.

8.2 Direct selection
To be able to select for a cloned gene it is necessary to plate the transformants onto an
agar medium on which only the desired recombinants, and no others, can grow. The
only colonies that are obtained will therefore be ones that comprise cells containing the
desired recombinant DNA molecule.
The simplest example of direct selection occurs when the desired gene specifies resistance to an antibiotic. As an example we will consider an experiment to clone the gene
for kanamycin resistance from plasmid R6-5. This plasmid carries genes for resistances
to four antibiotics: kanamycin, chloramphenicol, streptomycin, and sulphonamide. The
kanamycin resistance gene lies within one of the 13 EcoRI fragments (Figure 8.3a).
To clone this gene, the EcoRI fragments of R6-5 could be inserted into the EcoRI site
of a vector such as pBR322. The ligated mix will comprise many copies of 13 different
recombinant DNA molecules, one set of which carries the gene for kanamycin resistance (Figure 8.3b).
Insertional inactivation cannot be used to select recombinants when the EcoRI site
of pBR322 is used. This is because this site does not lie in either the ampicillin or the
tetracycline resistance genes of this plasmid (see Figure 6.1). But this is immaterial for
cloning the kanamycin resistance gene because in this case the cloned gene can be used
as the selectable marker. Transformants are plated onto kanamycin agar, on which the
only cells able to survive and produce colonies are those recombinants that contain the
cloned kanamycin resistance gene (Figure 8.3c).

8.2.1 Marker rescue extends the scope of direct selection
Direct selection would be very limited indeed if it could be used only for cloning antibiotic resistance genes. Fortunately the technique can be extended by making use of
mutant strains of E. coli as the hosts for transformation.
As an example, consider an experiment to clone the gene trpA from E. coli. This
gene codes for the enzyme tryptophan synthase, which is involved in biosynthesis of
the essential amino acid tryptophan. A mutant strain of E. coli that has a non-functional
trpA gene is called trpA−, and is able to survive only if tryptophan is added to the growth
medium. E. coli trpA− is therefore another example of an auxotroph (p. 106).
The E. coli trpA− auxotroph can be used to clone the correct version of the trpA gene.
Total DNA is first purified from a normal (wild-type) strain of the bacterium. Digestion
with a restriction endonuclease, followed by ligation into a vector, produces numerous
recombinant DNA molecules, one of which may, with luck, carry an intact copy of the
trpA gene (Figure 8.4a). This is, of course, the functional gene, as it has been obtained
from the wild-type strain.

Figure 8.4
Direct selection for the trpA gene cloned in a trpA− strain of E. coli.

The ligation mixture is now used to transform the auxotrophic E. coli trpA− cells
(Figure 8.4b). The vast majority of the resulting transformants will be auxotrophic, but
a few now have the plasmid-borne copy of the correct trpA gene. These recombinants
are non-auxotrophic—they no longer require tryptophan as the cloned gene is able to
direct production of tryptophan synthase (Figure 8.4c). Direct selection is therefore
performed by plating transformants onto minimal medium, which lacks any added
supplements, and in particular has no tryptophan (Figure 8.4d). Auxotrophs cannot
grow on minimal medium, so the only colonies to appear are recombinants that contain
the cloned trpA gene.

8.2.2 The scope and limitations of marker rescue
Although marker rescue can be used to obtain clones of many genes, the technique is
subject to two limitations:
l
l

A mutant strain must be available for the gene in question.
A medium on which only the wild-type can survive is needed.

Marker rescue is applicable for most genes that code for biosynthetic enzymes, as
clones of these genes can be selected on minimal medium in the manner described for
trpA. The technique is not limited to E. coli or even bacteria. Auxotrophic strains of

Chapter 8 How to Obtain a Clone of a Specific Gene

yeast and filamentous fungi are also available, and marker rescue has been used to select
genes cloned into these organisms.
In addition, E. coli auxotrophs can be used as hosts for the selection of some genes
from other organisms. Often there is sufficient similarity between equivalent enzymes
from different bacteria, or even from yeast, for the foreign enzyme to function in E. coli,
so that the cloned gene is able to transform the host to wild type.

8.3 Identiﬁcation of a clone from a gene library
Although marker rescue is a powerful technique, it is not all-embracing and there are
many important genes that cannot be selected by this method. Many bacterial mutants
are not auxotrophs, so the mutant and wild-type strains cannot be distinguished by plating onto minimal or any other special medium. In addition, neither marker rescue nor
any other direct selection method is of much use in providing bacterial clones of genes
from animals or plants, as in these cases the differences are usually so great that the
foreign enzymes do not function in the bacterial cell.
The alternative strategy must therefore be considered. This is where a large number
of different clones are obtained and the desired one identified in some way.

8.3.1 Gene libraries
Before looking at the methods used to identify individual clones, the library itself must
be considered. A genomic library (p. 102) is a collection of clones sufficient in number
to be likely to contain every single gene present in a particular organism. Genomic
libraries are prepared by purifying total cell DNA, and then making a partial restriction
digest, resulting in fragments that can be cloned into a suitable vector (Figure 8.5), usually a e replacement vector, a cosmid, or possibly a yeast artificial chromosome (YAC),
bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) or P1 vector.
For bacteria, yeast, and fungi, the number of clones needed for a complete genomic
library is not so large as to be unmanageable (see Table 6.1). For plants and animals
though, a complete library contains so many different clones that identification of the
desired one may prove a mammoth task. With these organisms a second type of library,
specific not to the whole organism but to a particular cell type, may be more useful.

8.3.2 Not all genes are expressed at the same time
A characteristic of most multicellular organisms is specialization of individual cells. A
human being, for example, is made up of a large number of different cell types—brain
cells, blood cells, liver cells, etc. Each cell contains the same complement of genes, but
in different cell types different sets of genes are switched on, while others are silent
(Figure 8.6).
The fact that only relatively few genes are expressed in any one type of cell can be
utilized in preparation of a library if the material that is cloned is not DNA but messenger RNA (mRNA). Only those genes that are being expressed are transcribed into
mRNA, so if mRNA is used as the starting material then the resulting clones comprise
only a selection of the total number of genes in the cell.
A cloning method that uses mRNA would be particularly useful if the desired gene
is expressed at a high rate in an individual cell type. For example, the gene for gliadin,
one of the nutritionally important proteins present in wheat, is expressed at a very high

level in the cells of developing wheat seeds. In these cells over 30% of the total mRNA
specifies gliadin. Clearly, if we could clone the mRNA from wheat seeds we would
obtain a large number of clones specific for gliadin.

8.3.3 mRNA can be cloned as complementary DNA
Messenger RNA cannot itself be ligated into a cloning vector. However, mRNA can be
converted into DNA by complementary DNA (cDNA) synthesis.
The key to this method is the enzyme reverse transcriptase (p. 49), which synthesizes a DNA polynucleotide complementary to an existing RNA strand (Figure 8.7a).
Once the cDNA strand has been synthesized the RNA member of the hybrid molecule
can be partially degraded by treating with ribonuclease (RNase) HI (Figure 8.7b). The
remaining RNA fragments then serve as primers (p. 48) for DNA polymerase I, which
synthesizes the second cDNA strand (Figure 8.7c), resulting in a double-stranded DNA
fragment that can be ligated into a vector and cloned (Figure 8.7d).
The resulting cDNA clones are representative of the mRNA present in the original
preparation. In the case of mRNA prepared from wheat seeds, the cDNA library would
contain a large proportion of clones representing gliadin mRNA (Figure 8.7e). Other
clones will also be present, but locating the cloned gliadin cDNA is a much easier process than identifying the equivalent gene from a complete wheat genomic library.

8.4 Methods for clone identification
Once a suitable library has been prepared, a number of procedures can be employed
to attempt identification of the desired clone. Although a few of these procedures are
based on detection of the translation product of the cloned gene, it is usually easier to
identify directly the correct recombinant DNA molecule. This can be achieved by the
important technique of hybridization probing.

8.4.1 Complementary nucleic acid strands hybridize to
each other
Any two single-stranded nucleic acid molecules have the potential to form base pairs with
one another. With most pairs of molecules the resulting hybrid structures are unstable,
as only a small number of individual interstrand bonds are formed (Figure 8.8a).
However, if the polynucleotides are complementary, extensive base pairing can occur
to form a stable double-stranded molecule (Figure 8.8b). Not only can this occur
between single-stranded DNA molecules to form the DNA double helix, but also
between a pair of single-stranded RNA molecules or between combinations of one DNA
strand and one RNA strand (Figure 8.8c).
Nucleic acid hybridization can be used to identify a particular recombinant clone if a
DNA or RNA probe, complementary to the desired gene, is available. The exact nature of
the probe will be discussed later in this chapter. First we must consider the technique itself.

8.4.2 Colony and plaque hybridization probing
Hybridization probing can be used to identify recombinant DNA molecules contained
in either bacterial colonies or bacteriophage plaques. First the colonies or plaques are

transferred to a nitrocellulose or nylon membrane (Figure 8.9a) and then treated to
remove all contaminating material, leaving just DNA (Figure 8.9b). Usually this treatment
also results in denaturation of the DNA molecules, so that the hydrogen bonds between
individual strands in the double helix are broken. These single-stranded molecules can
then be bound tightly to the membrane by a short period at 80°C if a nitrocellulose
membrane is being used, or with a nylon membrane by ultraviolet irradiation. The
molecules become attached to the membrane through their sugar–phosphate backbones,
so the bases are free to pair with complementary nucleic acid molecules.

136

The probe must now be labeled with a radioactive or other type of marker, denatured
by heating, and applied to the membrane in a solution of chemicals that promote nucleic
acid hybridization (Figure 8.9c). After a period to allow hybridization to take place, the
filter is washed to remove unbound probe, dried, and the label detected in order to
identify the colonies or plaques to which the probe has become bound (Figure 8.9d).
Labeling with a radioactive marker
A DNA molecule is usually labeled by incorporating nucleotides that carry a radioactive
isotope of phosphorus, 32P (Figure 8.10). Several methods are available:
l

l

Nick translation. Most purified samples of DNA contain some nicked molecules,
however carefully the preparation has been carried out, which means that DNA
polymerase I is able to attach to the DNA and catalyze a strand replacement
reaction (Figure 8.11a). This reaction requires a supply of nucleotides: if one
of these is radioactively labeled, the DNA molecule will itself become labeled.
Nick translation can be used to label any DNA molecule but might under some
circumstances also cause DNA cleavage.
End filling is a gentler method than nick translation and rarely causes breakage of
the DNA, but unfortunately can only be used to label DNA molecules that have
sticky ends. The enzyme used is the Klenow fragment (p. 49), which “fills in” a
sticky end by synthesizing the complementary strand (Figure 8.11b)). As with nick
translation, if the end filling reaction is carried out in the presence of labeled
nucleotides, the DNA becomes labeled.

Random priming results in a probe with higher activity and therefore able to detect
smaller amounts of membrane-bound DNA. The denatured DNA is mixed with a
set of hexameric oligonucleotides of random sequence. By chance, these random
hexamers will contain a few molecules that will base pair with the probe and
prime new DNA synthesis. The Klenow fragment is used as this enzyme lacks the
nuclease activity of DNA polymerase I (p. 48) and so only fills in the gaps between
adjacent primers (Figure 8.11c). Labeled nucleotides are incorporated into the new
DNA that is synthesized.

After hybridization, the location of the bound probe is detected by autoradiography.
A sheet of X-ray-sensitive photographic film is placed over the membrane. The radioactive DNA exposes the film, which is developed to reveal the positions of the colonies
or plaques to which the probe has hybridized (see Figure 8.9d).
Non-radioactive labeling
Radioactive labeling methods are starting to fall out of favor, partly because of the
hazard to the researcher and partly because of the problems associated with disposal
of radioactive waste. As an alternative, the hybridization probe can be labeled in a
non-radioactive manner. A number of methods have been developed, two of which are
illustrated in Figure 8.12. The first makes use of deoxyuridine triphosphate (dUTP)
nucleotides modified by reaction with biotin, an organic molecule that has a high affinity
for a protein called avidin. After hybridization the positions of the bound biotinylated
probe can be determined by washing with avidin coupled to a fluorescent marker
(Figure 8.12a). This method is as sensitive as radioactive probing and is becoming
increasingly popular.
The same is true for a second procedure for non-radioactive hybridization probing,
in which the probe DNA is complexed with the enzyme horseradish peroxidase, and is
detected through the enzyme’s ability to degrade luminol with the emission of chemiluminescence (Figure 8.12b). The signal can be recorded on normal photographic film
in a manner analogous to autoradiography.

8.4.3 Examples of the practical use of hybridization probing
Clearly, the success of colony or plaque hybridization as a means of identifying a
particular recombinant clone depends on the availability of a DNA molecule that can
be used as a probe. This probe must share at least a part of the sequence of the cloned
gene. If the gene itself is not available (which presumably is the case if the aim of the
experiment is to provide a clone of it), then what can be used as the probe?
In practice, the nature of the probe is determined by the information available about
the desired gene. We will consider three possibilities:
l

l

l

Where the desired gene is expressed at a high level in a cell type from which a
cDNA clone library has been prepared;
Where the amino acid sequence of the protein coded by the gene is completely or
partially known;
Where the gene is a member of a family of related genes.

Abundancy probing to analyze a cDNA library
As described earlier in this chapter, a cDNA library is often prepared in order to obtain
a clone of a gene expressed at a relatively high level in a particular cell type. In the

example of a cDNA library from developing wheat seeds, a large proportion of the
clones are copies of the mRNA transcripts of the gliadin gene (see Figure 8.7e).
Identification of the gliadin clones is simply a case of using individual cDNA clones
from the library to probe all the other members of the library (Figure 8.13). A clone is
selected at random and the recombinant DNA molecule purified, labeled, and used to
probe the remaining clones. This is repeated with different clones as probes until one
that hybridizes to a large proportion of the library is obtained. This abundant cDNA is
considered a possible gliadin clone and analyzed in greater detail (e.g., by DNA sequencing and isolation of the translation product) to confirm the identification.
Oligonucleotide probes for genes whose translation products have been characterized
Often the gene to be cloned codes for a protein that has already been studied in some
detail. In particular, the amino acid sequence of the protein might have been determined, using sequencing techniques that have been available for over 50 years. If the

amino acid sequence is known, then it is possible to use the genetic code to predict the
nucleotide sequence of the relevant gene. This prediction is always an approximation,
as only methionine and tryptophan can be assigned unambiguously to triplet codons, all
other amino acids being coded by at least two codons each. Nevertheless, in most cases,
the different codons for an individual amino acid are related. Alanine, for example, is
coded by GCA, GCC, GCG, and GCT, so two out of the three nucleotides of the triplet
coding for alanine can be predicted with certainty.
As an example to clarify how these predictions are made, consider cytochrome c, a
protein that plays an important role in the respiratory chain of all aerobic organisms.
The cytochrome c protein from yeast was sequenced in 1963, with the result shown in
Figure 8.14. This sequence contains a segment, starting at amino acid 59, that runs
Trp–Asp–Glu– Asn–Asn–Met. The genetic code states that this hexapeptide is coded by
A
TGG–GACT –GAG
–AA CT–AA CT–ATG. Although this represents a total of 16 different possible sequences, 14 of the 18 nucleotides can be predicted with certainty.
Oligonucleotides of up to about 150 nucleotides in length can easily be synthesized
in the laboratory (Figure 8.15). An oligonucleotide probe could therefore be constructed
according to the predicted nucleotide sequence, and this probe might be able to

nucleotides cannot attach to one another, and
instead react only with the terminal 5′ group of the

identify the gene coding for the protein in question. In the example of yeast cytochrome
c, the 16 possible oligonucleotides that can code for Trp–Asp–Glu–Asn–Asn–Met
would be synthesized, either separately or as a pool, and then used to probe a yeast
genomic or cDNA library (Figure 8.16). One of the oligonucleotides in the probe will
have the correct sequence for this region of the cytochrome c gene, and its hybridization signal will indicate which clones carry this gene.
The result can be checked by carrying out a second probing with a mixture of
oligonucleotides whose sequences are predicted from a different segment of the
cytochrome c protein (Figure 8.16). However, the segment of the protein used for
nucleotide sequence prediction must be chosen with care: the hexapeptide Ser–Glu–
Tyr–Leu–Thr–Asn, which immediately follows our first choice, could be coded by
several thousand different 18-nucleotide sequences, clearly an unsuitable choice for a
synthetic probe.

Heterologous probing allows related genes to be identified
Often a substantial amount of nucleotide similarity is seen when two genes for the same
protein, but from different organisms, are compared, a reflection of the conservation of
gene structure during evolution. Frequently, two genes from related organisms are
sufficiently similar for a single-stranded probe prepared from one gene to form a stable
hybrid with the second gene. Although the two molecules are not entirely complementary, enough base pairs are formed to produce a stable structure (Figure 8.17a).
Heterologous probing makes use of hybridization between related sequences for
clone identification. For example, the yeast cytochrome c gene, identified in the previous section by oligonucleotide probing, could itself be used as a hybridization probe
to identify cytochrome c genes in clone libraries of other organisms. A probe prepared
from the yeast gene would not be entirely complementary to the gene from, say, the
fungus Neurospora crassa, but sufficient base pairing should occur for a hybrid to be
formed (Figure 8.17b).
Heterologous probing can also identify related genes in the same organism. If the
wheat gliadin cDNA clone, identified earlier in the chapter by abundancy probing,
is used to probe a genomic library, it will hybridize not only to its own gene but to a

variety of other genes as well (Figure 8.17c). These are all related to the gliadin cDNA,
but have slightly different nucleotide sequences. This is because the wheat gliadins
form a complex group of related proteins that are coded by the members of a multigene
family. Once one gene in the family has been cloned, then all the other members can
be isolated by heterologous probing.
Southern hybridization enables a specific restriction fragment containing a gene
to be identified
As well as colony and plaque hybridization analysis, there are also occasions when it is
necessary to use hybridization probing to identify which of a series of restriction fragments contains a gene of interest. As an example, we will return to the genomic clone
of the yeast cytochrome c gene, which we identified by oligonucleotide hybridization
probing. Let us imagine that this particular genomic library was prepared by partial
restriction of yeast DNA with BamHI followed by cloning in the cosmid vector pJB8
(p. 101). The cloned fragment containing the cytochrome c gene will therefore be
approximately 40 kb in length, and will probably contain about ten BamHI fragments,
remembering that the hexanucleotide recognition site for this enzyme will be present,
on average, once every 46 = 4096 bp.
The cytochrome c gene, on the other hand, is predicted to be just 309 bp in length
(we know the protein has 103 amino acids; see Figure 8.14). The gene therefore makes
up less than 1% of the cloned DNA fragment, and it is quite possible that other genes

that we are not interested in are also present in this insert (Figure 8.18). The method
called Southern hybridization enables the individual restriction fragment containing the
cytochrome c gene to be identified.
The first step in using Southern hybridization for this purpose would be to digest the
clone with BamHI and then separate the restriction fragments by electrophoresis in an
agarose gel (Figure 8.19a). The aim is to use the oligonucleotide probe for cytochrome
c to identify the fragment that contains the gene. This can be attempted while the restriction fragments are still contained in the electrophoresis gel, but the results are usually
not very good, as the gel matrix causes a lot of spurious background hybridization
that obscures the specific hybridization signal. Instead, the DNA bands in the agarose
gel are transferred to a nitrocellulose or nylon membrane, providing a much “cleaner”
environment for the hybridization experiment.
Transfer of DNA bands from an agarose gel to a membrane makes use of the technique perfected in 1975 by Professor E.M. Southern and referred to as Southern transfer. The membrane is placed on the gel, and buffer allowed to soak through, carrying
the DNA from the gel to the membrane where the DNA is bound. Sophisticated pieces
of apparatus can be purchased to assist this process, but many molecular biologists prefer a homemade set-up incorporating a lot of paper towels and considerable balancing

144

skills (Figure 8.19b). The same method can also be used for the transfer of RNA
molecules (“northern” transfer) or proteins (“western” transfer). So far no one has come
up with “eastern” transfers!
Southern transfer results in a membrane that carries a replica of the DNA bands from
the agarose gel. If the labeled probe is now applied, hybridization occurs and autoradiography (or the equivalent detection system for a non-radioactive probe) reveals
which restriction fragment contains the cloned gene (Figure 8.19c).

8.4.4 Identification methods based on detection of the
translation product of the cloned gene
Hybridization probing is usually the preferred method for identification of a particular
recombinant from a clone library. The technique is easy to perform and, with
modifications introduced in recent years, can be used to check up to 10,000 recombinants per experiment, allowing large genomic libraries to be screened in a reasonably
short time. Nevertheless, the requirement for a probe that is at least partly complementary to the desired gene sometimes makes it impossible to use hybridization in clone
identification. On these occasions a different strategy is needed.
The main alternative to hybridization probing is immunological screening. The distinction is that, whereas with hybridization probing the cloned DNA fragment is itself
directly identified, an immunological method detects the protein coded by the cloned
gene. Immunological techniques therefore presuppose that the cloned gene is being
expressed, so that the protein is being made, and that this protein is not normally present in the host cells.
Antibodies are required for immunological detection methods
If a purified sample of a protein is injected into the bloodstream of a rabbit, the
immune system of the animal responds by synthesizing antibodies that bind to and help
degrade the foreign molecule (Figure 8.20a). This is a version of the natural defense

mechanism that the animal uses to deal with invasion by bacteria, viruses, and other
infective agents.
Once a rabbit is challenged with a protein, the levels of antibody present in its bloodstream remain high enough over the next few days for substantial quantities to be
purified. It is not necessary to kill the rabbit, because as little as 10 ml of blood provides
a considerable amount of antibody (Figure 8.20b). This purified antibody binds only to
the protein with which the animal was originally challenged.
Using a purified antibody to detect protein in recombinant colonies
There are several versions of immunological screening, but the most useful method is a
direct counterpart of colony hybridization probing. Recombinant colonies are transferred to a polyvinyl or nitrocellulose membrane, the cells are lysed, and a solution containing the specific antibody is added (Figure 8.21a). In the original methods, either the
antibody itself was labeled, or the membrane was subsequently washed with a solution
of labeled protein A, a bacterial protein that specifically binds to the immunoglobulins
that antibodies are made of (as shown in Figure 8.21a). In the more modern methods,
the bound antibody—the primary antibody—is detected by washing the membrane with
a labeled secondary antibody, which binds specifically to the primary antibody. Several
secondary antibody molecules can bind to a single primary antibody molecule, increasing
the amount of signal that is produced and enabling a clearer detection of each positive
colony. In all three methods, the label can be a radioactive one, in which case the
colonies that bind the label are detected by autoradiography (Figure 8.21b), or nonradioactive labels resulting in a fluorescent or chemiluminescent signal can be used.

Part I The Basic Principles of Gene Cloning and DNA Analysis

The problem of gene expression
Immunological screening depends on the cloned gene being expressed so that the
protein translation product is present in the recombinant cells. However, as will be
discussed in greater detail in Chapter 13, a gene from one organism is often not
expressed in a different organism. In particular, it is very unlikely that a cloned animal
or plant gene (with the exception of chloroplast genes) will be expressed in E. coli cells.
This problem can be circumvented by using a special type of vector, called an expression vector (p. 227), designed specifically to promote expression of the cloned gene in
a bacterial host. Immunological screening of recombinant E. coli colonies carrying animal genes cloned into expression vectors has been very useful in identifying genes for
several important hormones.

The polymerase chain reaction in outline
PCR in more detail
After the PCR: studying PCR products
Real-time PCR enables the amount of starting material to be quantified

As a result of the last seven chapters we have become familiar not only with the basic
principles of gene cloning, but also with fundamental molecular biology techniques such
as restriction analysis, gel electrophoresis, DNA labeling, and DNA–DNA hybridization.
To complete our basic education in DNA analysis we must now return to the second
major technique for studying genes, the polymerase chain reaction (PCR). PCR is a very
uncomplicated technique: all that happens is that a short region of a DNA molecule,
a single gene for instance, is copied many times by a DNA polymerase enzyme (see
Figure 1.2). This might seem a rather trivial exercise, but it has a multitude of applications in genetics research and in broader areas of biology.
We begin this chapter with an outline of the polymerase chain reaction in order to
understand exactly what it achieves. Then we will look at the key issues that determine
whether or not an individual PCR experiment is successful, before examining some of
the methods that have been devised for studying the amplified DNA fragments that are
obtained.

9.1 The polymerase chain reaction in outline
The polymerase chain reaction results in the selective amplification of a chosen region
of a DNA molecule. Any region of any DNA molecule can be chosen, so long as the
sequences at the borders of the region are known. The border sequences must be known
because in order to carry out a PCR, two short oligonucleotides must hybridize to the

DNA molecule, one to each strand of the double helix (Figure 9.1). These oligonucleotides, which act as primers for the DNA synthesis reactions, delimit the region that
will be amplified.
Amplification is usually carried out by the DNA polymerase I enzyme from Thermus
aquaticus. As mentioned on p. 49, this organism lives in hot springs, and many of its
enzymes, including Taq polymerase, are thermostable, meaning that they are resistant
to denaturation by heat treatment. As will be apparent in a moment, the thermostability
of Taq polymerase is an essential requirement in PCR methodology.
To carry out a PCR experiment, the target DNA is mixed with Taq polymerase, the
two oligonucleotide primers, and a supply of nucleotides. The amount of target DNA
can be very small because PCR is extremely sensitive and will work with just a single
starting molecule. The reaction is started by heating the mixture to 94°C. At this temperature the hydrogen bonds that hold together the two polynucleotides of the double
helix are broken, so the target DNA becomes denatured into single-stranded molecules
(Figure 9.2). The temperature is then reduced to 50–60°C, which results in some rejoining of the single strands of the target DNA, but also allows the primers to attach to their
annealing positions. DNA synthesis can now begin, so the temperature is raised to 74°C,
just below the optimum for Taq polymerase. In this first stage of the PCR, a set of “long
products” is synthesized from each strand of the target DNA. These polynucleotides
have identical 5′ ends but random 3′ ends, the latter representing positions where DNA
synthesis terminates by chance.
The cycle of denaturation–annealing–synthesis is now repeated (Figure 9.3). The
long products denature and the four resulting strands are copied during the DNA
synthesis stage. This gives four double-stranded molecules, two of which are identical
to the long products from the first cycle and two of which are made entirely of new
DNA. During the third cycle, the latter give rise to “short products”, the 5′ and 3′ ends
of which are both set by the primer annealing positions. In subsequent cycles, the number of short products accumulates in an exponential fashion (doubling during each cycle)
until one of the components of the reaction becomes depleted. This means that after
30 cycles, there will be over 130 million short products derived from each starting
molecule. In real terms, this equates to several micrograms of PCR product from a few
nanograms or less of target DNA.

At the end of a PCR a sample of the reaction mixture is usually analyzed by agarose
gel electrophoresis, sufficient DNA having been produced for the amplified fragment
to be visible as a discrete band after staining with ethidium bromide. This may by itself
provide useful information about the DNA region that has been amplified, or alternatively the PCR product can be examined by techniques such as DNA sequencing.

9.2 PCR in more detail
Although PCR experiments are very easy to set up, they must be planned carefully if the
results are to be of any value. The sequences of the primers are critical to the success of
the experiment, as are the precise temperatures used in the heating and cooling stages
of the reaction cycle.

9.2.1 Designing the oligonucleotide primers for a PCR
The primers are the key to the success or failure of a PCR experiment. If the primers
are designed correctly the experiment results in amplification of a single DNA fragment,
corresponding to the target region of the template molecule. If the primers are incorrectly
designed the experiment will fail, possibly because no amplification occurs, or possibly
because the wrong fragment, or more than one fragment, is amplified (Figure 9.4).
Clearly a great deal of thought must be put into the design of the primers.
Working out appropriate sequences for the primers is not a problem: they must
correspond with the sequences flanking the target region on the template molecule.
Each primer must, of course, be complementary (not identical) to its template strand in

Only the desired
fragment is amplified

order for hybridization to occur, and the 3′ ends of the hybridized primers should point
toward one another (Figure 9.5). The DNA fragment to be amplified should not be
greater than about 3 kb in length and ideally less than 1 kb. Fragments up to 10 kb can
be amplified by standard PCR techniques, but the longer the fragment the less efficient
the amplification and the more difficult it is to obtain consistent results. Amplification
of very long fragments—up to 40 kb—is possible, but requires special methods.
The first important issue to address is the length of the primers. If the primers are
too short they might hybridize to non-target sites and give undesired amplification
products. To illustrate this point, imagine that total human DNA is used in a PCR
experiment with a pair of primers eight nucleotides in length (in PCR jargon, these are
called “8-mers”). The likely result is that a number of different fragments will be
amplified. This is because attachment sites for these primers are expected to occur, on
average, once every 48 = 65,536 bp, giving approximately 49,000 possible sites in the
3,200,000 kb of nucleotide sequence that makes up the human genome. This means
that it would be very unlikely that a pair of 8-mer primers would give a single, specific
amplification product with human DNA (Figure 9.6a).
What if the 17-mer primers shown in Figure 9.5 are used? The expected frequency
of a 17-mer sequence is once every 417 = 17,179,869,184 bp. This figure is over five

times greater than the length of the human genome, so a 17-mer primer would be
expected to have just one hybridization site in total human DNA. A pair of 17-mer
primers should therefore give a single, specific amplification product (Figure 9.6b).
Why not simply make the primers as long as possible? The length of the primer
influences the rate at which it hybridizes to the template DNA, long primers hybridizing
at a slower rate. The efficiency of the PCR, measured by the number of amplified
molecules produced during the experiment, is therefore reduced if the primers are too
long, as complete hybridization to the template molecules cannot occur in the time
allowed during the reaction cycle. In practice, primers longer than 30-mer are rarely used.

9.2.2 Working out the correct temperatures to use
During each cycle of a PCR, the reaction mixture is transferred between three temperatures (Figure 9.7):
l

l

l

The denaturation temperature, usually 94°C, which breaks the base pairs and
releases single-stranded DNA to act as templates in the next round of DNA
synthesis;
The hybridization or annealing temperature, at which the primers attach to the
templates;
The extension temperature, at which DNA synthesis occurs. This is usually set at
74°C, just below the optimum for Taq polymerase.

The annealing temperature is the important one because, again, this can affect the
specificity of the reaction. DNA–DNA hybridization is a temperature-dependent
phenomenon. If the temperature is too high no hybridization takes place; instead the
primers and templates remain dissociated (Figure 9.8a). However, if the temperature is
too low, mismatched hybrids—ones in which not all the correct base pairs have
formed—are stable (Figure 9.8b). If this occurs the earlier calculations regarding the
appropriate lengths for the primers become irrelevant, as these calculations assumed
that only perfect primer–template hybrids are able to form. If mismatches are tolerated,

(b) Annealing temperature is too low

(c) Correct annealing temperature

Priming occurs only at
the desired target sites

the number of potential hybridization sites for each primer is greatly increased, and
amplification is more likely to occur at non-target sites in the template molecule.
The ideal annealing temperature must be low enough to enable hybridization
between primer and template, but high enough to prevent mismatched hybrids from
forming (Figure 9.8c). This temperature can be estimated by determining the melting
temperature or Tm of the primer–template hybrid. The Tm is the temperature at which
the correctly base-paired hybrid dissociates (“melts”). A temperature 1–2°C below this
should be low enough to allow the correct primer–template hybrid to form, but too
high for a hybrid with a single mismatch to be stable. The Tm can be determined experimentally but is more usually calculated from the simple formula (Figure 9.9):
Tm = (4 × [G + C] ) + (2 × [A + T] )°C
in which [G + C] is the number of G and C nucleotides in the primer sequence, and
[A + T ] is the number of A and T nucleotides.
The annealing temperature for a PCR experiment is therefore determined by calculating the Tm for each primer and using a temperature of 1–2°C below this figure. Note
that this means the two primers should be designed so that they have identical Tms. If
this is not the case, the appropriate annealing temperature for one primer may be too
high or too low for the other member of the pair.

9.3 After the PCR: studying PCR products
PCR is often the starting point for a longer series of experiments in which the
amplification product is studied in various ways in order to gain information about the
DNA molecule that acted as the original template. We will encounter many studies of
this type in Parts II and III, when we examine the applications of gene cloning and PCR

in research and biotechnology. Although a wide range of procedures have been devised
for studying PCR products, three techniques are particularly important:
l
l
l

Gel electrophoresis of PCR products
Cloning of PCR products
Sequencing of PCR products.

The first two of these techniques are dealt with in this chapter. The third technique is
deferred until Chapter 10, when all aspects of DNA sequencing will be covered.

9.3.1 Gel electrophoresis of PCR products
The results of most PCR experiments are checked by running a portion of the amplified
reaction mixture in an agarose gel. A band representing the amplified DNA may be visible after staining, or if the DNA yield is low the product can be detected by Southern
hybridization (p. 142). If the expected band is absent, or if additional bands are present,
something has gone wrong and the experiment must be repeated.
In some cases, agarose gel electrophoresis is used not only to determine if a PCR
experiment has worked, but also to obtain additional information. For example, the
presence of restriction sites in the amplified region of the template DNA can be determined by treating the PCR product with a restriction endonuclease before running the
sample in the agarose gel (Figure 9.10). This is a type of restriction fragment length
polymorphism (RFLP) analysis and is important both in the construction of genome
maps (p. 180) and in studying genetic diseases (p. 257).
Alternatively, the exact size of the PCR product can be used to establish if the template DNA contains an insertion or deletion mutation in the amplified region (Figure 9.10).
Length mutations of this type form the basis of DNA profiling, a central technique in
forensic science (Chapter 16).
In some experiments, the mere presence or absence of the PCR product is the
diagnostic feature. An example is when PCR is used as the screening procedure to
identify a desired gene from a genomic or cDNA library. Carrying out PCRs with every
clone in a genomic library might seem to be a tedious task, but one of the advantages
of PCR is that individual experiments are quick to set up and many PCRs can be
performed in parallel. The workload can also be reduced by combinatorial screening,
an example of which is shown in Figure 9.11.

9.3.2 Cloning PCR products
Some applications require that after a PCR the resulting products are ligated into a
vector and examined by any of the standard methods used for studying cloned DNA.
This may sound easy, but there are complications.

column 9 of tray 6, then it can be deduced that there are positive clones in well A7 of tray 2 and well D9 of tray 6.
Although there are 960 clones, unambiguous identification of the positive clones is therefore achieved after just 200 PCRs.

T-tailed vector

Figure 9.13
Using a special T-tailed vector to clone a PCR product.

The first problem concerns the ends of the PCR products. From an examination of
Figure 9.3 it might be imagined that the short products resulting from PCR amplification
are blunt-ended. If this was the case they could be inserted into a cloning vector by
blunt-end ligation, or alternatively the PCR products could be provided with sticky ends
by the attachment of linkers or adaptors (p. 64). Unfortunately, the situation is not so
straightforward. Taq polymerase tends to add an additional nucleotide, usually an
adenosine, to the end of each strand that it synthesizes. This means that a doublestranded PCR product is not blunt-ended, and instead most 3′ termini have a single
nucleotide overhang (Figure 9.12). The overhangs could be removed by treatment with
an exonuclease enzyme, resulting in PCR products with true blunt ends, but this is not
a popular approach as it is difficult to prevent the exonuclease from becoming overactive and causing further damage to the ends of the molecules.
One solution is to use a special cloning vector which carries thymidine (T) overhangs
and which can therefore be ligated to a PCR product (Figure 9.13). These vectors are
usually prepared by restricting a standard vector at a blunt-end site, and then treating
with Taq polymerase in the presence of just 2′-deoxythymidine 5′-triphosphate (dTTP).
No primer is present so all the polymerase can do is add a T nucleotide to the 3′ ends
of the blunt-ended vector molecule, resulting in the T-tailed vector into which the PCR
products can be inserted. Special vectors of this type have also been designed for use
with the topoisomerase ligation method described on p. 69, and this is currently the
most popular way of cloning PCR products.
A second solution is to design primers that contain restriction sites. After PCR the
products are treated with the restriction endonuclease, which cuts each molecule
within the primer sequence, leaving sticky-ended fragments that can be ligated efficiently
into a standard cloning vector (Figure 9.14). The approach is not limited to those
instances where the primers span restriction sites that are present in the template DNA.
Instead, the restriction site can be included within a short extension at the 5′ end of
each primer (Figure 9.15). These extensions cannot hybridize to the template molecule,
but they are copied during the PCR, resulting in PCR products that carry terminal
restriction sites.

9.3.3 Problems with the error rate of Taq polymerase
All DNA polymerases make mistakes during DNA synthesis, occasionally inserting an
incorrect nucleotide into the growing DNA strand. Most polymerases, however, are
able to rectify these errors by reversing over the mistake and resynthesizing the correct
sequence. This property is referred to as the “proofreading” function and depends on
the polymerase possessing a 3′ to 5′ exonuclease activity (p. 168).
Taq polymerase lacks a proofreading activity and as a result is unable to correct
its errors. This means that the DNA synthesized by Taq polymerase is not always an
accurate copy of the template molecule. The error rate has been estimated at one mistake
for every 9000 nucleotides of DNA that is synthesized, which might appear to be almost
insignificant but which translates to one error in every 300 bp for the PCR products
obtained after 30 cycles. This is because PCR involves copies being made of copies of
copies, so the polymerase-induced errors gradually accumulate, the fragments produced
at the end of a PCR containing copies of earlier errors together with any new errors
introduced during the final round of synthesis.
For many applications this high error rate does not present a problem. In particular,
sequencing of a PCR product provides the correct sequence of the template, even though
the PCR products contain the errors introduced by Taq polymerase. This is because the
errors are distributed randomly, so for every molecule that has an error at a particular
nucleotide position, there will be many molecules with the correct sequence. In this
context the error rate is indeed insignificant.
This is not the case if the PCR products are cloned. Each resulting clone contains
multiple copies of a single amplified fragment, so the cloned DNA does not necessarily

have the same sequence as the original template molecule used in the PCR (Figure 9.16).
This possibility lends an uncertainty to all experiments carried out with cloned PCR
products and dictates that, whenever possible, the amplified DNA should be studied
directly rather than being cloned.

9.4 Real-time PCR enables the amount of starting
material to be quantified
The amount of product that is synthesized during a set number of cycles of a PCR
depends on the number of DNA molecules that are present in the starting mixture
(Table 9.1). If there are only a few DNA molecules at the beginning of the PCR then
relatively little product will be made, but if there are many starting molecules then the
product yield will be higher. This relationship enables PCR to be used to quantify the
number of DNA molecules present in an extract.

Note: The numbers assume that amplification is 100% efficient, none of the reactants becoming limiting during the course of the PCR.

9.4.1 Carrying out a quantitative PCR experiment
In quantitative PCR (qPCR) the amount of product synthesized during a test PCR is
compared with the amounts synthesized during PCRs with known quantities of starting
DNA. In the early procedures, agarose gel electrophoresis was used to make these
comparisons. After staining the gel, the band intensities were examined to identify the
control PCR whose product was most similar to that of the test (Figure 9.17). Although
easy to perform, this type of qPCR is imprecise, because large differences in the amount
of starting DNA give relatively small differences in the band intensities of the resulting
PCR products.
Today, quantification is carried out by real-time PCR, a modification of the standard
PCR technique in which synthesis of the product is measured over time, as the PCR
proceeds through its series of cycles. There are two ways of following product synthesis
in real time:
l

l

A dye that gives a fluorescent signal when it binds to double-stranded DNA
can be included in the PCR mixture. This method measures the total amount of
double-stranded DNA in the PCR at any particular time, which may over-estimate
the actual amount of the product because sometimes the primers anneal to one
another in various non-specific ways, increasing the amount of double-stranded
DNA that is present.
A short oligonucleotide called a reporter probe, which gives a fluorescent signal
when it hybridizes to the PCR product, can be used. Because the probe only
hybridizes to the PCR product, this method is less prone to inaccuracies caused by
primer-primer annealing. Each probe molecule has pair of labels. A fluorescent dye

Quantification by real-time PCR. The graph shows
product synthesis during three PCRs, each with a
different amount of starting DNA. During a PCR, product
accumulates exponentially, the amount present at any
particular cycle proportional to the amount of starting
DNA. The blue curve is therefore the PCR with the
greatest amount of starting DNA, and the green curve is
the one with the least starting DNA. If the amounts of
starting DNA in these three PCRs are known, then the
amount in a test PCR can be quantified by comparison
with these controls. In practice, the comparison is made
by identifying the cycle at which product synthesis
moves above a threshold amount, indicated by the
horizontal line on the graph.

is attached to one end of the oligonucleotide, and a quenching compound, which
inhibits the fluorescent signal, is attached to the other end (Figure 9.18). Normally
there is no fluorescence because the oligonucleotide is designed in such a way that
its two ends base pair to one another, placing the quencher next to the dye.
Hybridization between the oligonucleotide and the PCR product disrupts this base
pairing, moving the quencher away from the dye and enabling the fluorescent
signal to be generated.
Both systems enable synthesis of the PCR product to be followed by measuring the
fluorescent signal. Quantification again requires comparison between test and control
PCRs, usually by identifying the stage in the PCR at which the amount of fluorescent
signal reaches a pre-set threshold (Figure 9.19). The more rapidly the threshold is
reached, the greater the amount of DNA in the starting mixture.

9.4.2 Real-time PCR can also quantify RNA
Real-time PCR is often used to quantify the amount of DNA in an extract, for example
to follow the progression of a viral infection by measuring the amount of pathogen DNA
that is present in a tissue. More frequently, however, the method is used as a means of
measuring RNA amounts, in particular to determine the extent of expression of a
particular gene by quantifying its mRNA. The gene under study might be one that is
switched on in cancerous cells, in which case quantifying its mRNA will enable the

development of the cancer to be monitored and the effects of subsequent treatment to
be assessed.
How do we carry out PCR if RNA is the starting material? The answer is to use
reverse transcriptase PCR. The first step in this procedure is to convert the RNA
molecules into single-stranded complementary DNA (cDNA) (Figure 9.20). Once this
preliminary step has been carried out, the PCR primers and Taq polymerase are added
and the experiment proceeds exactly as in the standard technique. Some thermostable
polymerases are able to make DNA copies of both RNA and DNA molecules (i.e., they
have both reverse transcriptase and DNA-dependent DNA polymerase activities) and so
can carry out all the steps of this type of PCR in a single reaction.

10.1 The methodology for DNA sequencing
10.2 How to sequence a genome

Part I of this book has shown how a skilfully performed cloning or PCR experiment can
provide a pure sample of an individual gene, or any other DNA sequence, separated
from all the other genes and DNA sequences in the cell. Now we can turn our attention
to the ways in which cloning, PCR, and other DNA analysis techniques are used to study
genes and genomes. We will consider three aspects of molecular biology research:
l

l

l

The techniques used to obtain the nucleotide sequence of individual genes and
entire genomes (this Chapter);
The methods used to study the expression and function of individual genes
(Chapter 11);
The techniques that are used to study entire genomes (Chapter 12).

Probably the most important technique available to the molecular biologist is DNA
sequencing, by which the precise order of nucleotides in a piece of DNA can be determined. DNA sequencing methods have been around for 40 years, and since the mid-1970s
rapid and efficient sequencing has been possible. Initially these techniques were applied
to individual genes, but since the early 1990s an increasing number of entire genome
sequences have been obtained. In this chapter we will study the methodology used in
DNA sequencing and then examine how these techniques are used in genome projects.

10.1 The methodology for DNA sequencing
There are several procedures for DNA sequencing, the most popular being the chain termination method first devised by Fred Sanger and colleagues in the mid-1970s. Chain

termination sequencing has gained pre-eminence for several reasons, not least being the
relative ease with which the technique can be automated. As we will see later in this
chapter, in order to sequence an entire genome a huge number of individual sequencing experiments must be carried out, and it would take many years to perform all of
these by hand. Automated sequencing techniques are therefore essential if a genome
project is to be completed in a reasonable timespan.
Part of the automation strategy is to design systems that enable many individual
sequencing experiments to be carried out at once. With the chain termination method,
up to 96 sequences can be obtained simultaneously in a single run of a sequencing
machine. This is still not enough to fully satisfy the demands of genome sequencing,
and during the last few years an alternative method called pyrosequencing has become
popular. Pyrosequencing, which was invented in 1998, forms the basis to a massively
parallel strategy that enables hundreds of thousands of short sequences to be generated
at the same time.

10.1.1 Chain termination DNA sequencing
Chain termination DNA sequencing is based on the principle that single-stranded DNA
molecules that differ in length by just a single nucleotide can be separated from one
another by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. This means that it is possible to resolve
a family of molecules, representing all lengths from 10 to 1500 nucleotides, into a series
of bands in a slab or capillary gel (Figure 10.1).
Chain termination sequencing in outline
The starting material for a chain termination sequencing experiment is a preparation of
identical single-stranded DNA molecules. The first step is to anneal a short oligonucleotide to the same position on each molecule, this oligonucleotide subsequently acting as
the primer for synthesis of a new DNA strand that is complementary to the template
(Figure 10.2a).
The strand synthesis reaction, which is catalyzed by a DNA polymerase enzyme and
requires the four deoxyribonucleotide triphosphates (dNTPs—dATP, dCTP, dGTP, and
dTTP) as substrates, would normally continue until several thousand nucleotides had
been polymerized. This does not occur in a chain termination sequencing experiment

Figure 10.1

Polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis can resolve
single-stranded DNA molecules that differ in length
by just one nucleotide. The banding pattern shown
here is produced after separation of single-stranded
DNA molecules by denaturing polyacrylamide gel
electrophoresis. The molecules have been labeled
with a radioactive marker and the bands visualized
by autoradiography.

because, as well as the four deoxynucleotides, a small amount of each of four
dideoxynucleotides (ddNTPs—ddATP, ddCTP, ddGTP, and ddTTP) is added to the
reaction. Each of these dideoxynucleotides is labeled with a different fluorescent marker.
The polymerase enzyme does not discriminate between deoxy- and dideoxynucleotides, but once incorporated a dideoxynucleotide blocks further elongation because it
lacks the 3′-hydroxyl group needed to form a connection with the next nucleotide
(Figure 10.2b). Because the normal deoxynucleotides are also present, in larger amounts
than the dideoxynucleotides, the strand synthesis does not always terminate close
to the primer: in fact, several hundred nucleotides may be polymerized before a
dideoxynucleotide is eventually incorporated. The result is a set of new molecules, all
of different lengths, and each ending in a dideoxynucleotide whose identity indicates the
nucleotide—A, C, G, or T—that is present at the equivalent position in the template
DNA (Figure 10.2c).
To work out the DNA sequence, all that we have to do is identify the dideoxynucleotide at the end of each chain-terminated molecule. This is where the polyacrylamide gel
comes into play. The mixture is loaded into a well of a polyacrylamide slab gel, or into
a tube of a capillary gel system, and electrophoresis carried out to separate the molecules
according to their lengths. After separation, the molecules are run past a fluorescent
detector capable of discriminating the labels attached to the dideoxynucleotides
(Figure 10.3a). The detector therefore determines if each molecule ends in an A, C, G,
or T. The sequence can be printed out for examination by the operator (Figure 10.3b),
or entered directly into a storage device for future analysis.

Not all DNA polymerases can be used for sequencing
Any DNA polymerase is capable of extending a primer that has been annealed to a singlestranded DNA molecule, but not all polymerases can be used for DNA sequencing. This
is because many DNA polymerases have a mixed enzymatic activity, being able to
degrade as well as synthesize DNA (p. 48). Degradation can occur in either the 5′→3′
or 3′→5′ direction (Figure 10.4), and both activities are detrimental to accurate chain
termination sequencing. The 5′→3′ exonuclease activity enables the polymerase to
remove nucleotides from the 5′ ends of the newly-synthesized strands, changing the
lengths of these strands so that they no longer run through the polyacrylamide gel in the
appropriate order. The 3′→5′ activity could have the same effect, but more importantly

The exonuclease activities of DNA polymerases. (a) The 5′→3′ activity has an important role in DNA repair in the cell,
as it enables the polymerase to replace a damaged DNA strand. In DNA sequencing this activity can result in the 5′ ends
of newly-synthesized strands becoming shortened. (b) The 3′→5′ activity also has an important role in the cell, as it
allows the polymerase to correct its own mistakes, by reversing and replacing a nucleotide that has been added in
error (e.g., a T instead of a G). This is called proofreading. During DNA sequencing, this activity can result in removal
of a dideoxynucleotide that has just been added to the newly-synthesized strand, so that chain termination does
not occur.

Chapter 10 Sequencing Genes and Genomes

will remove a dideoxynucleotide that has just been added at the 3′ end, preventing chain
termination from occurring.
In the original method for chain termination sequencing, the Klenow polymerase
was used as the sequencing enzyme. As described on p. 49, this is a modified version of
the DNA polymerase I enzyme from E. coli, the modification removing the 5′→3′
exonuclease activity of the standard enzyme. However, the Klenow polymerase has low
processivity, meaning that it can only synthesize a relatively short DNA strand before
dissociating from the template due to natural causes. This limits the length of sequence
that can be obtained from a single experiment to about 250 bp. To avoid this problem,
most sequencing today makes use of a more specialized enzyme, such as Sequenase, a
modified version of the DNA polymerase encoded by bacteriophage T7. Sequenase has
high processivity and no exonuclease activity and so is ideal for chain termination
sequencing, enabling sequences of up to 750 bp to be obtained in a single experiment.
Chain termination sequencing requires a single-stranded DNA template
The template for a chain termination experiment is a single-stranded version of the
DNA molecule to be sequenced. One way of obtaining single-stranded DNA is to use
an M13 vector, but the M13 system, although designed specifically to provide DNA for
chain termination sequencing, is not ideal for this purpose. The problem is that cloned
DNA fragments that are longer than about 3 kb are unstable in an M13 vector and can
undergo deletions and rearrangements. This means that M13 cloning can only be used
with short pieces of DNA.
Plasmid vectors, which do not suffer instability problems, are therefore more
popular, but some means is needed of converting the double-stranded plasmid into a
single-stranded form. There are two possibilities:
l

l

Double-stranded plasmid DNA can be converted into single-stranded DNA by
denaturation with alkali or by boiling. This is a common method for obtaining
template DNA for DNA sequencing, but a shortcoming is that it can be difficult to
prepare plasmid DNA that is not contaminated with small quantities of bacterial
DNA and RNA, which can act as spurious templates or primers in the DNA
sequencing experiment.
The DNA can be cloned in a phagemid, a plasmid vector that contains an M13
origin of replication and which can therefore be obtained as both double- and
single-stranded DNA versions (p. 96). Phagemids avoid the instabilities of M13
cloning and can be used with fragments up to 10 kb or more.

The need for single-stranded DNA can also be sidestepped by using a thermostable
DNA polymerase as the sequencing enzyme. This method, called thermal cycle sequencing, is carried out in a similar way to PCR, but just one primer is used and the reaction
mixture includes the four dideoxynucleotides (Figure 10.5). Because there is only one
primer, only one of the strands of the starting molecule is copied, and the product accumulates in a linear fashion, not exponentially as is the case in a real PCR. The presence
of the dideoxynucleotides in the reaction mixture causes chain termination, as in the
standard methodology, and the family of resulting strands can be analyzed and the
sequence read in the usual way. Thermal cycle sequencing can therefore be used with
DNA cloned in any type of vector.
The primer determines the region of the template DNA that will be sequenced
In the first stage of a chain termination sequencing experiment, an oligonucleotide
primer is annealed onto the template DNA (see Figure 10.2a). The main function of the

primer is to provide the short double-stranded region that is needed in order for the
DNA polymerase to initiate DNA synthesis. The primer also plays a second critical role
in determining the region of the template molecule that will be sequenced.
For most sequencing experiments a universal primer is used, this being one that is
complementary to the part of the vector DNA immediately adjacent to the point into
which new DNA is ligated (Figure 10.6a). The 3′ end of the primer points toward the
inserted DNA, so the sequence that is obtained starts with a short stretch of the vector
and then progresses into the cloned DNA fragment. If the DNA is cloned in a plasmid
vector, then both forward and reverse universal primers can be used, enabling sequences
to be obtained from both ends of the insert. This is an advantage if the cloned DNA is
more than 750 bp and hence too long to be sequenced completely in one experiment.
Alternatively, it is possible to extend the sequence in one direction by synthesizing a nonuniversal primer, designed to anneal at a position within the insert DNA (Figure 10.6b).

Chapter 10 Sequencing Genes and Genomes

An experiment with this primer will provide a second short sequence that overlaps the
previous one.

10.1.2 Pyrosequencing
Pyrosequencing is the second important type of DNA sequencing methodology that is
in use today. Pyrosequencing does not require electrophoresis or any other fragment
separation procedure and so is more rapid than chain termination sequencing. It is only
able to generate up to 150 bp in a single experiment, and at first glance might appear
to be less useful than the chain termination method, especially if the objective is to
sequence a genome. The advantage with pyrosequencing is that it can be automated in
a massively parallel manner that enables hundreds of thousands of sequences to be
obtained at once, perhaps as much as 1000 Mb in a single run. Sequence is therefore
produced much more quickly than is possible by the chain termination method, which
explains why pyrosequencing is gradually taking over as the method of choice for
genome projects.
Pyrosequencing involves detection of pulses of chemiluminescence
Pyrosequencing, like the chain termination method, requires a preparation of identical
single-stranded DNA molecules as the starting material. These are obtained by alkali
denaturation of PCR products or, more rarely, recombinant plasmid molecules. After
attachment of the primer, the template is copied by a DNA polymerase in a straightforward manner without added dideoxynucleotides. As the new strand is being made,
the order in which the deoxynucleotides are incorporated is detected, so the sequence
can be “read” as the reaction proceeds.
The addition of a deoxynucleotide to the end of the growing strand is detectable
because it is accompanied by release of a molecule of pyrophosphate, which can be converted by the enzyme sulfurylase into a flash of chemiluminescence. Of course, if all
four deoxynucleotides were added at once, then flashes of light would be seen all the
time and no useful sequence information would be obtained. Each deoxynucleotide is
therefore added separately, one after the other, with a nucleotidase enzyme also present
in the reaction mixture so that if a deoxynucleotide is not incorporated into the polynucleotide then it is rapidly degraded before the next one is added (Figure 10.7). This
procedure makes it possible to follow the order in which the deoxynucleotides are incorporated into the growing strand. The technique sounds complicated, but it simply
requires that a repetitive series of additions be made to the reaction mixture, precisely
the type of procedure that is easily automated.
Massively parallel pyrosequencing
The high throughput version of pyrosequencing usually begins with genomic DNA,
rather than PCR products or clones. The DNA is broken into fragments between 300
and 500 bp in length (Figure 10.8a), and each fragment is ligated to a pair of adaptors
(p. 65), one adaptor to either end (Figure 10.8b). These adaptors play two important
roles. First, they enable the DNA fragments to be attached to small metallic beads. This
is because one of the adaptors has a biotin label attached to its 5′ end, and the beads
are coated with streptavidin, to which biotin binds with great affinity (p. 137). DNA
fragments therefore become attached to the beads via biotin-streptavidin linkages
(Figure 10.8c). The ratio of DNA fragments to beads is set so that, on average, just one
fragment becomes attached to each bead.

Each DNA fragment will now be amplified by PCR so that enough copies are made
for sequencing. The adaptors now play their second role as they provide the annealing
sites for the primers for this PCR. The same pair of primers can therefore be used for
all the fragments, even though the fragments themselves have many different sequences.
If the PCR is carried out immediately then all we will obtain is a mixture of all the
products, which will not enable us to obtain the individual sequences of each one. To
solve this problem, PCR is carried out in an oil emulsion, each bead residing in its own
aqueous droplet within the emulsion (Figure 10.8d). Each droplet contains all the
reagents needed for PCR, and is physically separated from all the other droplets by the
barrier provided by the oil component of emulsion. After PCR, the aqueous droplets are
transferred into wells on a plastic strip so there is one droplet and hence once PCR
product per well, and the pyrosequencing reactions are carried out in each well.

10.2 How to sequence a genome
The first DNA molecule to be completely sequenced was the 5386 nucleotide genome
of bacteriophage dX174, which was completed in 1975. This was quickly followed by
sequences for SV40 virus (5243 bp) in 1977 and pBR322 (4363 bp) in 1978. Gradually
sequencing was applied to larger molecules. Professor Sanger’s group published the
sequence of the human mitochondrial genome (16.6 kb) in 1981 and of bacteriophage
e (49 kb) in 1982. Nowadays sequences of 100–200 kb are routine and most research
laboratories have the necessary expertise to generate this amount of information.
The pioneering projects today are the massive genome initiatives, each aimed at
obtaining the nucleotide sequence of the entire genome of a particular organism. The
first chromosome sequence, for chromosome III of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae,
was published in 1992, and the entire yeast genome was completed in 1996. There
are now complete genome sequences for the worm Caenorhabditis elegans, the fly
Drosophila melanogaster, the plant Arabidopsis thaliana, the human Homo sapiens, and
over 1000 other species. It is even possible to obtain genome sequences for extinct
species such as mammoths and Neanderthals.
A single chain termination sequencing experiment produces about 750 bp of
sequence, and a single pyrosequence yields up to 150 bp. But the total size of a fairly
typical bacterial genome is 4,000,000 bp and the human genome is 3,200,000,000 bp
(Table 10.1). Clearly a large number of sequencing experiments must be carried out in

order to determine the sequence of an entire genome. In practice, thanks to automated
systems, the generation of sufficient sequence data is one of the more routine aspects of
a genome project. The first real problem that arises is the need to assemble the thousands
or perhaps millions of individual sequences into a contiguous genome sequence. Two
different strategies have been developed for sequence assembly (Figure 10.9):
l

l

The shotgun approach, in which the genome is randomly broken into short
fragments. The resulting sequences are examined for overlaps and these are used
to build up the contiguous genome sequence.
The clone contig approach, which involves a pre-sequencing phase during which a
series of overlapping clones is identified. This contiguous series is called a contig.
Each piece of cloned DNA is then sequenced, and this sequence placed at its
appropriate position on the contig map in order to gradually build up the
overlapping genome sequence.

10.2.1 The shotgun approach to genome sequencing
The key requirement of the shotgun approach is that it must be possible to identify
overlaps between all the individual sequences that are generated, and this identification
process must be accurate and unambiguous so that the correct genome sequence is
obtained. An error in identifying a pair of overlapping sequences could lead to the
genome sequence becoming scrambled, or parts being missed out entirely. The probability of making mistakes increases with larger genome sizes, so the shotgun approach
has been used mainly with the smaller bacterial genomes.
The Haemophilus influenzae genome sequencing project
The shotgun approach was first used successfully with the bacterium Haemophilus.

sequenced, the results being published in 1995. The first step was to break the 1830 kb
genome of the bacterium into short fragments, which would provide the templates for
the sequencing experiments (Figure 10.10). A restriction endonuclease could have been
used but sonication was chosen because this technique cleaves DNA in a more random
fashion and hence reduces the possibility of gaps appearing in the genome sequence.
It was decided to concentrate on fragments of 1.6–2.0 kb because these could yield
two DNA sequences, one from each end, reducing the amount of cloning and DNA

preparation that was required. The sonicated DNA was therefore fractionated by
agarose gel electrophoresis and fragments of the desired size purified from the gel.
After cloning, 28,643 chain termination sequencing experiments were carried out with
19,687 of the clones. A few of these sequences—4339 in all—were rejected because
they were less than 400 bp in length. The remaining 24,304 sequences were entered
into a computer, which spent 30 hours analyzing the data. The result was 140 contiguous sequences, each a different segment of the H. influenzae genome.
It might have been possible to continue sequencing more of the sonicated fragments
in order eventually to close the gaps between the individual segments. However,
11,631,485 bp of sequence had already been generated—six times the length of the
genome—suggesting that a large amount of additional work would be needed before the
correct fragments were, by chance, sequenced. At this stage of the project the most timeeffective approach was to use a more directed strategy in order to close each of the gaps
individually. Several approaches were used for gap closure, the most successful of these
involving hybridization analysis of a clone library prepared in a e vector (Figure 10.11).
The library was probed in turn with a series of oligonucleotides whose sequences
corresponded with the ends of each of the 140 segments. In some cases, two oligonucleotides hybridized to the same e clone, indicating that the two segment ends
represented by those oligonucleotides lay adjacent to one another in the genome. The
gap between these two ends could then be closed by sequencing the appropriate part of
the e clone.
Problems with shotgun sequencing
Shotgun sequencing has been successful with many bacterial genomes. Not only are
these genomes small, so the computational requirements for finding sequence overlaps
are not too great, but they contain little or no repetitive DNA sequences. These are

sequences, from a few base pairs to several kilobases, which are repeated at two or more
places in a genome. They cause problems for the shotgun approach because when
sequences are assembled those that lie partly or wholly within one repeat element might
accidentally be assigned an overlap with the identical sequence present in a different
repeat element (Figure 10.12). This could lead to a part of the genome sequence being
placed at the incorrect position or left out entirely. For this reason, it has generally been
thought that shotgun sequencing is inappropriate for eukaryotic genomes, as these have
many repeat elements. Later in this chapter (p. 183) we will see how this limitation can
be circumvented by using a genome map to direct assembly of sequences obtained by the
shotgun approach.

10.2.2 The clone contig approach
The clone contig approach does not suffer from the limitations of shotgun sequencing and
so can provide an accurate sequence of a large genome that contains repetitive DNA.
Its drawback is that it involves much more work and so takes longer and costs more
money. The additional time and effort is needed to construct the overlapping series of
cloned DNA fragments. Once this has been done, each cloned fragment is sequenced by
the shotgun method and the genome sequence built up step by step (see Figure 10.9).
The cloned fragments should be as long as possible in order to minimize the total
number needed to cover the entire genome. A high capacity vector is therefore used.
The first eukaryotic chromosome to be sequenced—chromosome III of Saccharomyces
cerevisiae – was initially cloned in a cosmid vector (p. 101) with the resulting contig
comprising 29 cloned fragments. Chromosome III is relatively short, however, and the
average size of the cloned fragments was just 10.8 kb. Sequencing of the much longer
human genome required 300,000 bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) clones (p. 103).
Assembling all of these into chromosome-specific contigs was a massive task.
Clone contig assembly by chromosome walking
One technique that can be used to assemble a clone contig is chromosome walking. To
begin a chromosome walk a clone is selected at random from the library, labeled, and

used as a hybridization probe against all the other clones in the library (Figure 10.13a).
Those clones that give hybridization signals are ones that overlap with the probe. One
of these overlapping clones is now labeled and a second round of probing carried out.
More hybridization signals are seen, some of these indicating additional overlaps
(Figure 10.13b). Gradually the clone contig is built up in a step-by-step fashion. But this
is a laborious process and is only attempted when the contig is for a short chromosome
and so involves relatively few clones, or when the aim is to close one or more small
gaps between contigs that have been built up by more rapid methods.
Rapid methods for clone contig assembly
The weakness of chromosome walking is that it begins at a fixed starting point and
builds up the clone contig step by step, and hence slowly, from that fixed point. The
more rapid techniques for clone contig assembly do not use a fixed starting point and
instead aim to identify pairs of overlapping clones: when enough overlapping pairs have
been identified the contig is revealed (Figure 10.14). The various techniques that can be
used to identify overlaps are collectively known as clone fingerprinting.
Clone fingerprinting is based on the identification of sequence features that are shared
by a pair of clones. The simplest approach is to digest each clone with one or more
restriction endonucleases and to look for pairs of clones that share restriction fragments
of the same size, excluding those fragments that derive from the vector rather than

the inserted DNA. This technique might appear to be easy to carry out, but in practice
it takes a great deal of time to scan the resulting agarose gels for shared fragments.
There is also a relatively high possibility that two clones that do not overlap will, by
chance, share restriction fragments whose sizes are indistinguishable by agarose gel
electrophoresis.
More accurate results can be obtained by repetitive DNA PCR, also known as interspersed repeat element PCR (IRE–PCR). This type of PCR uses primers that are designed
to anneal within repetitive DNA sequences and direct amplification of the DNA between
adjacent repeats (Figure 10.15). Repeats of a particular type are distributed fairly
randomly in a eukaryotic genome, with varying distances between them, so a variety of
product sizes are obtained when these primers are used with clones of eukaryotic DNA.
If a pair of clones gives PCR products of the same size, they must contain repeats that
are identically spaced, possibly because the cloned DNA fragments overlap.
Clone contig assembly by sequence tagged site content analysis
A third way to assemble a clone contig is to search for pairs of clones that contain a
specific DNA sequence that occurs at just one position in the genome under study. If two
clones contain this feature, then clearly they must overlap (Figure 10.16). A sequence
of this type is called a sequence tagged site (STS). Often an STS is a gene that has been
sequenced in an earlier project. As the sequence is known, a pair of PCR primers can
be designed that are specific for that gene and then used to identify which members of
a clone library contain the gene. The STS does not have to be a gene and can be any

short piece of DNA sequence, the only requirement being that it occurs just once in the
genome.

10.2.3 Using a map to aid sequence assembly
Sequence tagged site content mapping is a particularly important method for clone contig assembly, because often the positions of STSs within the genome will have been
determined by genetic mapping or physical mapping. This means that the STS positions
can be used to anchor the clone contig onto a genome map, enabling the position of the
contig within a chromosome to be determined. We will now look at how these maps are
obtained.
Genetic maps
A genetic map is one that is obtained by genetic studies using Mendelian principles and
involving directed breeding programmes for experimental organisms or pedigree
analysis for humans. In many cases the loci that are studied are genes, whose inheritance
patterns are followed by monitoring the phenotypes of the offspring produced after a
cross between parents with contrasting characteristics (e.g., tall and short for the pea
plants studied by Mendel). The inheritance patterns reveal the extent of genetic linkage
between genes present on the same chromosome, enabling the relative positions of those
genes to be deduced and a genetic map to be built up.
More recently, techniques have been devised for genetic mapping of DNA sequences
that are not genes but which still display variability in the human population. The most
important of these DNA markers are:
l

l

Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), which are positions in a genome where
either of two different nucleotides can occur (Figure 10.17). Some members of the
species have one version of the SNP and some have the other version. SNPs are
usually typed with short oligonucleotide probes that hybridize to the alternative
forms and hence distinguish which is present.
Restriction fragment length polymorphisms (RFLPs) are special types of SNPs,
ones which result in a restriction site being changed. When digested with a
restriction endonuclease the loss of the site is revealed because two fragments
remain joined together. Originally, RFLPs were typed by Southern hybridization

Typing a restriction site polymorphism by PCR. In
the middle lane the PCR product gives two bands

of restricted genomic DNA, but this is a time-consuming process, so nowadays
the presence or absence of the restriction site is usually determined by PCR
(Figure 10.18).
Short tandem repeats (STRs), also called microsatellites, are made up of short
repetitive sequences of 1–13 nucleotides in length, linked head to tail. The number
of repeats present in a particular STR varies, usually between 5 and 20. The
number can be determined by carrying out a PCR using primers that anneal either
side of the STR, and then examining the size of the resulting product by agarose or
polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (Figure 10.19).

All of these DNA markers are variable and so exist in two or more allelic forms.
Their inheritance patterns can be determined by analysis of DNA prepared from
the parents and offspring from a genetic cross, and the data used to place the DNA
markers on a genetic map, in exactly the same way as genes are mapped.
Physical maps
A physical map is generated by methods that directly locate the positions of specific
sequences on a chromosomal DNA molecule. As in genetic mapping, the loci that are
studied can be genes or DNA markers. The latter might include expressed sequence tags

(ESTs), which are short sequences obtained from the ends of complementary DNAs
(cDNAs) (p. 133). Expressed sequence tags are therefore partial gene sequences, and when
used in map construction they provide a quick way of locating the positions of genes,
even though the identity of the gene might not be apparent from the EST sequence.
Two types of technique are used in physical mapping:
l

l

Direct examination of chromosomal DNA molecules, for example by
fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). In this technique, a cloned DNA
fragment is labeled with a fluorescent marker and then hybridized to a
preparation of chromosomes immobilized on a glass slide. The physical position
of the DNA fragment within the chromosome is then revealed simply by
examining the preparation with a microscope (Figure 10.20). If FISH is carried
out simultaneously with two DNA probes, each labeled with a different
fluorochrome, the relevant positions on the chromosome of the two markers
represented by the probes can be visualized. Special techniques for working with
extended chromosomes, whose DNA molecules are stretched out rather than
tightly coiled as in normal chromosomes, enable markers to be positioned with
a high degree of accuracy.
Physical mapping with a mapping reagent, which is a collection of overlapping
DNA fragments spanning the chromosome or genome that is being studied. Pairs
of markers that lie within a single fragment must be located close to each other
on the chromosome: how close can be determined by measuring the frequency
with which the pair occurs together in different fragments in the mapping reagent
(Figure 10.21). The mapping reagent could be a clone library, possibly one that is
also being assembled into a contig prior to DNA sequencing. Radiation hybrids are
a second type of mapping reagent and were particularly important in the Human
Genome Project. These are hamster cell lines that contain fragments of human
chromosomes, prepared by a treatment involving irradiation (hence their name).
Mapping is carried out by hybridization of marker probes to a panel of cell lines,
each one containing a different part of the human genome.

The principle behind the use of a mapping reagent. It can be deduced that markers 1 and 2 are relatively close because
they are present together on four DNA fragments. In contrast, markers 3 and 4 must be relatively far apart because they
occur together on just one fragment.

The importance of a map in sequence assembly
It is possible to obtain a genome sequence without the use of a genetic or physical map.
This is illustrated by the H. influenzae project that we followed on p. 174, and many
other bacterial genomes have been sequenced without the aid of a map. But a map is
very important when a larger genome is being sequenced because it provides a guide that
can be used to check that the genome sequence is being assembled correctly from the
many short sequences that emerge from the automated sequencer. If a marker that has
been mapped by genetic and/or physical means appears in the genome sequence at an
unexpected position, then an error in sequence assembly is suspected.
Detailed genetic and/or physical maps have been important in the Human Genome
Project, as well as those for yeast, fruit fly, C. elegans, and A. thaliana, all of which were
based on the clone contig approach. Maps are also being used to direct sequence assembly
in projects that use the shotgun approach. As described on p. 176, the major problem
when applying shotgun sequencing to a large genome is the presence of repeated
sequences and the possibility that the assembled sequence “jumps” between two repeats,
so part of the genome is misplaced or left out (see Figure 10.12). These errors can be
avoided if sequence assembly makes constant reference to a genome map. Because it
avoids the laborious construction of clone contigs, this directed shotgun approach is
becoming the method of choice for sequencing large genomes.

11.1 Studying the RNA transcript of a gene
11.2 Studying the regulation of gene expression
11.3 Identifying and studying the translation product of a cloned gene

All genes have to be expressed in order to function. The first step in expression is
transcription of the gene into a complementary RNA strand (Figure 11.1a). For some
genes—for example, those coding for transfer RNA (tRNA) and ribosomal RNA (rRNA)
molecules—the transcript itself is the functionally important molecule. For other genes,
the transcript is translated into a protein molecule.
To understand how a gene is expressed, the RNA transcript must be studied. In
particular, the molecular biologist will want to know whether the transcript is a faithful
copy of the gene, or whether segments of the gene are missing from the transcript
(Figure 11.1b). These missing pieces are called introns and considerable interest centers
on their structure and possible function. In addition to introns, the exact locations of the
start and end points of transcription are important. Most transcripts are copies not only
of the gene itself, but also of the nucleotide regions either side of it (Figure 11.1c). The
signals that determine the start and finish of the transcription process are only partly
understood, and their positions must be located if the expression of a gene is to be studied.
In this chapter we will begin by looking at the methods used for transcript analysis.
These methods can be used to map the positions of the start and end points for
transcription and also to determine if a gene contains introns. Then we will briefly
consider a few of the numerous techniques developed in recent years for examining
how expression of a gene is regulated. These techniques are important as aberrations in
gene regulation underlie many clinical disorders. Finally, we will tackle the difficult
problem of how to identify the translation product of a gene.

11.1 Studying the RNA transcript of a gene
Over the years a variety of techniques have been devised for studying RNA transcripts.
Some of these techniques merely detect the presence of a transcript and give some
indication of its length, others enable the start and end of the transcript to be mapped
and the positions of introns to be located.

11.1.1 Detecting the presence of a transcript and determining
its nucleotide sequence
Before studying the more sophisticated techniques for RNA analysis, we must consider
the methods used to obtain basic information about a transcript. The first of these
methods is northern hybridization, the RNA equivalent of Southern hybridization

Northern hybridization. Three RNA extracts from
different tissues have been electrophoresed in an
agarose gel. The extracts are made up of many
RNAs of different lengths so each gives a smear
of RNA, but two distinct bands are seen, one for
each of the abundant ribosomal RNAs. The sizes
of these rRNAs are known (e.g. 4718 and 1874
nucleotides in mammals), so they can be used as
internal size markers. The gel is transferred to a
membrane, probed with a cloned gene, and the
results visualized, for example by autoradiography
if the probe has been radioactively labeled. Only
lane 1 gives a band, showing that the cloned gene
is expressed only in the tissue from which this
RNA extract was obtained.

Autoradiograph

(p. 142), which is used to measure the length of a transcript. An RNA extract is
electrophoresed in an agarose gel, using a denaturing electrophoresis buffer (e.g., one
containing formaldehyde) to ensure that the RNAs do not form inter- or intramolecular
base pairs, as base pairing would affect the rate at which the molecules migrate through
the gel. After electrophoresis, the gel is blotted onto a nylon or nitrocellulose membrane, and hybridized with a labeled probe (Figure 11.2). If the probe is a cloned gene,
the band that appears in the autoradiograph is the transcript of that gene. The size of
the transcript can be determined from its position within the gel, and if RNA from
different tissues is run in different lanes of the gel, then the possibility that the gene is
differentially expressed can be examined.
Once a transcript has been identified, cDNA synthesis (p. 133) can be used to convert
it into a double-stranded DNA copy, which can be cloned and sequenced. Comparison
between the sequence of the cDNA and the sequence of its gene will reveal the positions
of introns and possibly the start and end points of the transcript. For this to be possible, the cDNA must be a full length copy of the mRNA from which it is derived. The
3′ end of the transcript will usually be represented in the cDNA, because most methods
for cDNA synthesis begin with a primer that anneals to the poly(A) tail of the mRNA,
which means that the 3′ end is the first part to be copied (see Figure 8.7). The cDNA
synthesis might not, however, continue all the way to the 5′ end of the transcript, especially
if the RNA is more than a few hundred nucleotides in length. Premature termination of
cDNA synthesis will result in a cDNA that is not a full length copy of its transcript, and
whose 3′ end does not correspond to the true 5′ end of the mRNA (Figure 11.3). If this
is the case, then the start point for transcription cannot be identified from the sequence
of the cDNA. It will also be impossible to map the positions of any introns that are
located near the start of the gene.

11.1.2 Transcript mapping by hybridization between gene
and RNA
The problems with incomplete cDNA synthesis mean that other, more direct methods
are needed to identify the start point of a transcript. The most informative of these
methods are based on examination of the hybridization product formed between a
cloned gene and its RNA.
Nucleic acid hybridization occurs just as readily between complementary DNA and
RNA strands as between single-stranded DNA molecules. If a hybrid is formed between
a DNA strand, containing a gene, and its mRNA, then the boundaries between the
double- and single-stranded regions will mark the start and end points of the mRNA
(Figure 11.4a). Introns, which are present in the DNA but not in the mRNA, will “loop
out” as additional single-stranded regions.
Now consider the result of treating the DNA–RNA hybrid with a single-strandspecific nuclease such as S1 (p. 46). S1 nuclease degrades single-stranded DNA or RNA
polynucleotides, including single-stranded regions at the ends of predominantly doublestranded molecules, but has no effect on double-stranded DNA or on DNA–RNA
hybrids. S1 nuclease will therefore digest the non-hybridized single-stranded DNA

regions at each end of the DNA–RNA hybrid, along with any looped-out introns
(Figure 11.4b). The single-stranded DNA fragments protected from S1 nuclease digestion
can be recovered if the RNA strand is degraded by treatment with alkali.
Unfortunately, the manipulations shown in Figure 11.4 are not very informative.
The sizes of the protected DNA fragments could be measured by gel electrophoresis,
but this does not allow their order or relative positions in the DNA sequence to be
determined. However, a few subtle modifications to the technique allow the precise
start and end points of the transcript and of any introns it contains to be mapped onto
the DNA sequence.
An example of the way in which S1 nuclease mapping is used to locate the start point
of a transcript is shown in Figure 11.5. Here, a Sau3A fragment that contains 100 bp
of coding region, along with 300 bp of the leader sequence preceding the gene, has
been cloned into an M13 vector and obtained as a single-stranded molecule. A sample
of the RNA transcript is added and allowed to anneal to the DNA molecule. The DNA
molecule is still primarily single-stranded but now has a small region protected by
the RNA transcript. All but this protected region is digested by S1 nuclease and the
RNA is degraded with alkali, leaving a short single-stranded DNA fragment. If these

manipulations are examined closely it will become clear that the size of this singlestranded fragment corresponds to the distance between the transcription start point and
the right-hand Sau3A site. The size of the single-stranded fragment is therefore determined by gel electrophoresis and this information is used to locate the transcription
start point on the DNA sequence. Exactly the same strategy could locate the end point
of transcription and the junction points between introns and exons. The only difference would be the position of the restriction site chosen to delimit one end of the
protected single-stranded DNA fragment.

11.1.3 Transcript analysis by primer extension
S1 nuclease analysis is a powerful technique that allows both the 5′ and 3′ termini of a
transcript, as well as the positions of intron–exon boundaries, to be identified. The
second method of transcript analysis that we will consider—primer extension—is
less adaptable, because it can only identify the 5′ end of an RNA. It is, nonetheless, an
important technique that is frequently used to check the results of S1 analyses.
Primer extension can only be used if at least part of the sequence of the transcript is
known. This is because a short oligonucleotide primer must be annealed to the RNA at
a known position, ideally within 100–200 nucleotides of the 5′ end of the transcript.
Once annealed, the primer is extended by reverse transcriptase (p. 49). This is a cDNA
synthesis reaction, but one that is very likely to proceed to completion as only a short
segment of RNA has to be copied (Figure 11.6). The 3′ end of the newly synthesized
strand of DNA will therefore correspond with the 5′ terminus of the transcript. Locating

the position of this terminus on the DNA sequence is achieved simply by determining
the length of the single-stranded DNA molecule and correlating this information with the
annealing position of the primer.

11.1.4 Transcript analysis by PCR
We have already studied the way in which reverse transcriptase PCR is used to quantify the amount of a particular RNA in an extract (p. 160). The standard reverse transcriptase PCR procedure provides a copy of the internal region of an RNA molecule but
does not give any information about the ends of the molecule. A modified version called
rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE) can be used to identify the 5′ and 3′ termini
of RNA molecules and so, like S1 analysis, can be used to map the ends of transcripts.
There are several variations to the RACE method. Here we will consider how the 5′
end of an RNA molecule can be mapped (Figure 11.7). This procedure uses a primer

that is specific for an internal region of the RNA molecule. The primer attaches to the
RNA and directs the first, reverse transcriptase catalyzed, stage of the process, during
which a single-stranded cDNA is made. As in the primer extension method, the 3′ end
of the cDNA corresponds with the 5′ end of the RNA. Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (p. 50) is now used to attach a series of A nucleotides to the 3′ end of the cDNA,
forming the priming site for a second PCR primer, which is made up entirely of Ts and
hence anneals to the poly(A) tail created by terminal transferase. Now the standard PCR
begins, first converting the single-stranded cDNA into a double-stranded molecule, and
then amplifying this molecule as the PCR proceeds. The PCR product is then sequenced
to reveal the precise position of the start of the transcript.

11.2 Studying the regulation of gene expression
Few genes are expressed all the time. Most are subject to regulation and are switched
on only when their gene product is required by the cell. The simplest gene regulation
systems are found in bacteria such as E. coli, which can regulate expression of genes for
biosynthetic and metabolic processes, so that gene products that are not needed are not
synthesized. For instance, the genes coding for the enzymes involved in tryptophan
biosynthesis can be switched off when there are abundant amounts of tryptophan in
the cell, and switched on again when tryptophan levels drop. Similarly, genes for the
utilization of sugars such as lactose are activated only when the relevant sugar is there
to be metabolized. In higher organisms, gene regulation is more complex because there
are many more genes to control. Differentiation of cells involves wholesale changes in
gene expression patterns, and the process of development from fertilized egg cell to
adult requires coordination between different cells as well as time-dependent changes
in gene expression.
Many of the problems in gene regulation require a classical genetic approach: genetics
enables genes that control regulation to be distinguished, allows the biochemical signals
that influence gene expression to be identified, and can explore the interactions between
different genes and gene families. It is for this reason that most of the breakthroughs in
understanding development in higher organisms have started with studies of the fruit fly
Drosophila melanogaster. Gene cloning and DNA analysis complement classical genetics
as they provide much more detailed information on the molecular events involved in
regulating the expression of a single gene.
We now know that a gene subject to regulation has one or more control sequences
in its upstream region (Figure 11.8) and that the gene is switched on and off by the
attachment of regulatory proteins to these sequences. A regulatory protein may repress
gene expression, in which case the gene is switched off when the protein is bound to the
control sequence, or alternatively the protein may have a positive or enhancing role,
switching on or increasing expression of the target gene. In this section we will examine
methods for locating control sequences and determining their roles in regulating gene
expression.

11.2.1 Identifying protein binding sites on a DNA molecule
A control sequence is a region of DNA that can bind a regulatory protein. It should
therefore be possible to identify control sequences upstream of a gene by searching the
relevant region for protein binding sites. There are three different ways of doing this.
Gel retardation of DNA–protein complexes
Proteins are quite substantial structures and a protein attached to a DNA molecule
results in a large increase in overall molecular mass. If this increase can be detected, a
DNA fragment containing a protein binding site will have been identified. In practice a
DNA fragment carrying a bound protein is identified by gel electrophoresis, as it has
a lower mobility than the uncomplexed DNA molecule (Figure 11.9). The procedure is
referred to as gel retardation.
In a gel retardation experiment (Figure 11.10), the region of DNA upstream of the
gene being studied is digested with a restriction endonuclease and then mixed with the
regulatory protein or, if the protein has not yet been purified, with an unfractionated
extract of nuclear protein (remember that gene regulation occurs in the nucleus). The

restriction fragment containing the control sequence forms a complex with the regulatory
protein: all the other fragments remain as “naked” DNA. The location of the control
sequence is then determined by finding the position on the restriction map of the
fragment that is retarded during gel electrophoresis. The precision with which the
control sequence can be located depends on how detailed the restriction map is and
how conveniently placed the restriction sites are. A single control sequence may be less
than 10 bp in size, so gel retardation is rarely able to pinpoint it exactly. More precise
techniques are therefore needed to delineate the position of the control sequence within
the fragment identified by gel retardation.
Footprinting with DNase I
The procedure generally called footprinting enables a control region to be positioned
within a restriction fragment that has been identified by gel retardation. Footprinting
works on the basis that the interaction with a regulatory protein protects the DNA in
the region of a control sequence from the degradative action of an endonuclease such
as deoxyribonuclease (DNase) I (Figure 11.11). This phenomenon can be used to locate
the protein binding site on the DNA molecule.
The DNA fragment being studied is first labeled at one end, and then complexed
with the regulatory protein (Figure 11.12a). Then DNase I is added, but the amount
used is limited so that complete degradation of the DNA fragment does not occur.
Instead the aim is to cut each molecule at just a single phosphodiester bond
(Figure 11.12b). If the DNA fragment has no protein attached to it, the result of this
treatment is a family of labeled fragments, differing in size by just one nucleotide each.
After removal of the bound protein and separation on a polyacrylamide gel, the
family of labeled fragments appears as a ladder of bands (Figure 11.12c). However, the
bound protein protected certain phosphodiester bonds from being cut by DNase I,
meaning that in this case the family of fragments is not complete, as the fragments resulting from cleavage within the control sequence are absent. Their absence shows up as a
“footprint”, clearly seen in Figure 11.12c. The region of the DNA molecule containing
the control sequence can now be worked out from the sizes of the fragments on either
side of the footprint.
Modification interference assays
Gel retardation analysis and footprinting enable control sequences to be located, but do
not give information about the interaction between the binding protein and the DNA

molecule. The more precise of these two techniques—footprinting—only reveals the
region of DNA that is protected by the bound protein. Proteins are relatively large compared with a DNA double helix, and can protect several tens of base pairs when bound
to a control sequence that is just a few base pairs in length (Figure 11.13). Footprinting
therefore does not delineate the control region itself, only the region within which it is
located.

Nucleotides that actually form attachments with a bound protein can be identified by
the modification interference assay. As in footprinting, the DNA fragments must first
be labeled at one end. Then they are treated with a chemical that modifies specific
nucleotides, an example being dimethyl sulphate, which attaches methyl groups to
guanine nucleotides (Figure 11.14). This modification is carried out under limiting
conditions so an average of just one nucleotide per DNA fragment is modified. Now the
DNA is mixed with the protein extract. The key to the assay is that the binding protein
will probably not attach to the DNA if one of the guanines within the control region is
modified, because methylation of a nucleotide interferes with the specific chemical reaction that enables it to form an attachment with a protein.
How is the absence of protein binding monitored? If the DNA and protein mixture
is examined by agarose gel electrophoresis two bands will be seen, one comprising the
DNA–protein complex and one containing DNA with no bound protein – in essence,
this part of the procedure is a gel retardation assay (Figure 11.14). The band made up
of unbound DNA is purified from the gel and treated with piperidine, a chemical which

cleaves DNA molecules at methylated nucleotides. The products of piperidine treatment are now separated in a polyacrylamide gel and the labeled bands visualized. The
sizes of the bands that are seen indicate the position in the DNA fragment of guanines
whose methylation prevented protein binding. These guanines lie within the control
sequence. The modification assay can now be repeated with chemicals that target A, T,
or C nucleotides to determine the precise position of the control sequence.

11.2.2 Identifying control sequences by deletion analysis
Gel retardation, footprinting, and modification interference assays are able to locate
possible control sequences upstream of a gene, but they provide no information on the
function of the individual sequences. Deletion analysis is a totally different approach
that not only can locate control sequences (though only with the precision of gel retardation), but importantly also can indicate the function of each sequence.
The technique depends on the assumption that deletion of the control sequence
will result in a change in the way in which expression of a cloned gene is regulated
(Figure 11.15). For instance, deletion of a sequence that represses expression of a gene
should result in that gene being expressed at a higher level. Similarly, tissue-specific
control sequences can be identified as their deletion results in the target gene being
expressed in tissues other than the correct one.
Reporter genes
Before carrying out a deletion analysis, a way must be found to assay the effect of a
deletion on expression of the cloned gene. The effect will probably only be observed
when the gene is cloned into the species from which it was originally obtained: it
will be no good assaying for light regulation of a plant gene if the gene is cloned in a
bacterium.
Cloning vectors have now been developed for most organisms (Chapter 7), so cloning
the gene under study back into its host should not cause a problem. The difficulty is that
in most cases the host already possesses a copy of the gene within its chromosomes.
How can changes in the expression pattern of the cloned gene be distinguished from the
normal pattern of expression displayed by the chromosomal copy of the gene? The
answer is to use a reporter gene. This is a test gene that is fused to the upstream region

of the cloned gene (Figure 11.16), replacing this gene. When cloned into the host
organism the expression pattern of the reporter gene should exactly mimic that of the
original gene, as the reporter gene is under the influence of exactly the same control
sequences as the original gene.
The reporter gene must be chosen with care. The first criterion is that the reporter
gene must code for a phenotype not already displayed by the host organism. The phenotype of the reporter gene must be relatively easy to detect after it has been cloned into
the host, and ideally it should be possible to assay the phenotype quantitatively. These
criteria have not proved difficult to meet and a variety of different reporter genes have
been used in studies of gene regulation. A few examples are listed in Table 11.1.
Carrying out a deletion analysis
Once a reporter gene has been chosen and the necessary construction made, carrying out
a deletion analysis is fairly straightforward. Deletions can be made in the upstream
region of the construct by any one of several strategies, a simple example being shown
in Figure 11.17. The effect of the deletion is then assessed by cloning the deleted construct into the host organism and determining the pattern and extent of expression
of the reporter gene. An increase in expression will imply that a repressing or silencing
sequence has been removed, a decrease will indicate removal of an activator or
enhancer, and a change in tissue specificity (as shown in Figure 11.17) will pinpoint a
tissue-responsive control sequence.
The results of a deletion analysis project have to be interpreted very carefully.
Complications may arise if a single deletion removes two closely linked control

sequences or, as is fairly common, two distinct control sequences cooperate to produce
a single response. Despite these potential difficulties, deletion analyses, in combination
with studies of protein binding sites, have provided important information about how
the expression of individual genes is regulated, and have supplemented and extended
the more broadly based genetic analyses of differentiation and development.

11.3 Identifying and studying the translation
product of a cloned gene
Over the years gene cloning has become increasingly useful in the study not only of
genes themselves but also of the proteins coded by cloned genes. Investigations into
protein structure and function have benefited greatly from the development of
techniques that allow mutations to be introduced at specific points in a cloned gene,
resulting in directed changes in the structure of the encoded protein.
Before considering these procedures we should first look at the more mundane
problem of how to isolate the protein coded by a cloned gene. In many cases this
analysis will not be necessary, as the protein will have been characterized long before
the gene cloning experiment is performed and pure samples of the protein will already
be available. On the other hand, there are occasions when the translation product of a
cloned gene has not been identified. A method for isolating the protein is then needed.

11.3.1 HRT and HART can identify the translation product of a
cloned gene
Two related techniques, hybrid-release translation (HRT) and hybrid-arrest translation
(HART), are used to identify the translation product encoded by a cloned gene. Both
depend on the ability of purified mRNA to direct synthesis of proteins in cell-free
translation systems. These are cell extracts, usually prepared from germinating wheat
seeds or from rabbit reticulocyte cells (both of which are exceptionally active in protein
synthesis) and containing ribosomes, tRNAs, and all the other molecules needed for
protein synthesis. The mRNA sample is added to the cell-free translation system, along
with a mixture of the 20 amino acids found in proteins, one of which is labeled (often

S-methionine is used). The mRNA molecules are translated into a mixture of radioactive proteins (Figure 11.18), which can be separated by gel electrophoresis and
visualized by autoradiography. Each band represents a single protein coded by one of
the mRNA molecules present in the sample.
Both HRT and HART work best when the gene being studied has been obtained as
a cDNA clone. For HRT the cDNA is denatured, immobilized on a nitrocellulose or
nylon membrane, and incubated with the mRNA sample (Figure 11.19). The specific
mRNA counterpart of the cDNA hybridizes and remains attached to the membrane.
After discarding the unbound molecules, the hybridized mRNA is recovered and translated in a cell-free system. This provides a pure sample of the protein coded by the cDNA.
Hybrid-arrest translation is slightly different in that the denatured cDNA is added
directly to the mRNA sample (Figure 11.20). Hybridization again occurs between the
cDNA and its mRNA counterpart, but in this case the unbound mRNA is not discarded.
Instead the entire sample is translated in the cell-free system. The hybridized mRNA is
unable to direct translation, so all the proteins except the one coded by the cloned gene
are synthesized. The cloned gene’s translation product is therefore identified as the
protein that is absent from the autoradiograph.

11.3.2 Analysis of proteins by in vitro mutagenesis
Although HRT and HART can identify the translation product of a cloned gene, these
techniques tell us little about the protein itself. Some of the major questions asked by
the molecular biologist today center on the relationship between the structure of a

protein and its mode of activity. The best way of tackling these problems is to induce a
mutation in the gene coding for the protein and then to determine what effect the
change in amino acid sequence has on the properties of the translation product
(Figure 11.21). Under normal circumstances mutations occur randomly and a large
number may have to be screened before one that gives useful information is found. A
solution to this problem is provided by in vitro mutagenesis, a technique that enables
a directed mutation to be made at a specific point in a cloned gene.

A restriction fragment can be deleted (Figure 11.22a).
The gene can be opened at a unique restriction site, a few nucleotides removed
with a double-strand-specific endonuclease such as Bal31 (p. 46), and the gene
religated (Figure 11.22b).
A short, double-stranded oligonucleotide can be inserted at a restriction
site (Figure 11.22c). The sequence of the oligonucleotide can be such that
the additional stretch of amino acids inserted into the protein produces,
for example, a new structure such as an a-helix, or destabilizes an existing
structure.

Although potentially useful, these manipulations depend on the fortuitous occurrence
of a restriction site at the area of interest in the cloned gene. Oligonucleotide-directed
mutagenesis is a more versatile technique that can create a mutation at any point in the
gene.

Using an oligonucleotide to create a point mutation in a cloned gene
There are a number of different ways of carrying out oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis; we will consider one of the simplest of these methods. The gene to be mutated
must be obtained in a single-stranded form and so is generally cloned into an M13
vector. The single-stranded DNA is purified and the region to be mutated identified by
DNA sequencing. A short oligonucleotide is then synthesized, complementary to the
relevant region, but containing the desired nucleotide alteration (Figure 11.23a). Despite
this mismatch the oligonucleotide will anneal to the single-stranded DNA and act as a
primer for complementary strand synthesis by a DNA polymerase (Figure 11.23b). This

204

strand synthesis reaction is continued until an entire new strand is made and the recombinant molecule is completely double-stranded.
After introduction, by transfection, into competent E. coli cells, DNA replication
produces numerous copies of the recombinant DNA molecule. The semi-conservative
nature of DNA replication means that half the double-stranded molecules that are
produced are unmutated in both strands, whereas half are mutated in both strands.
Similarly, half the resulting phage progeny carry copies of the unmutated molecule and
half carry the mutation. The phages produced by the transfected cells are plated onto
solid agar so that plaques are produced. Half the plaques should contain the original
recombinant molecule, and half the mutated version. Which are which is determined by
plaque hybridization, using the oligonucleotide as the probe, and employing very strict
conditions so that only the completely base-paired hybrid is stable.
Cells infected with M13 vectors do not lyse, but instead continue to divide (p. 19).
The mutated gene can therefore be expressed in the host E. coli cells, resulting in
production of recombinant protein. The protein coded by the mutated gene can be
purified from the recombinant cells and its properties studied. The effect of a single
base pair mutation on the activity of the protein can therefore be assessed.
Other methods of creating a point mutation in a cloned gene
The oligonucleotide-directed procedure illustrated in Figure 11.23 is an effective way
of creating a single point mutation in a cloned gene. But what if the objective is to make
a number of changes to the sequence of the gene? The oligonucleotide procedure could,
of course, be repeated several times, introducing a new mutation at each stage, but this
would be a very lengthy process.
An alternative for short genes (up to about 1 kb) would be to construct the gene in
the test tube, placing mutations at all the desired positions. This approach is feasible now
that oligonucleotides of 150 units and longer can be made by chemical synthesis
(p. 140). The gene is constructed by synthesizing a series of partially overlapping
oligonucleotides, the sequences of these oligonucleotides making up the desired
sequence for the gene. The overlaps can be partial, rather than complete, because the
gaps can be filled in with a DNA polymerase, and the final phosphodiester bonds synthesized with DNA ligase, to create the completed, double-stranded gene (Figure 11.24).
If restriction sites are included in the end-sequences of the gene, then treatment with the
appropriate enzyme will produce sticky ends that allow the gene to be ligated into a
cloning vector. This procedure is called artificial gene synthesis.
PCR can also be used to create mutations in cloned genes, though like oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis, only one mutation can be created per experiment.
Various procedures have been devised, one of which is shown in Figure 11.25. In this
example, the starting DNA molecule is amplified by two PCRs. In each of these, one
primer is normal and forms a fully base-paired hybrid with the template DNA, but the
second is mutagenic, as it contains a single base-pair mismatch corresponding to the
mutation that we wish to introduce into the DNA sequence. This mutation is therefore
present in the two PCR products, each of which represents one half of the starting DNA
molecule. The two PCR products are mixed together and a final PCR cycle carried out.
In this cycle, complementary strands from the two products anneal to one another and
are then extended by the polymerase, producing the full-length, mutated DNA
molecule. This technique, and related ones using PCR, is very quick and easy to carry
out but a major problem is caused by the high error rate of the Taq polymerase used in
PCR (p. 157). This error rate makes it likely that not only the desired mutation, but also

random ones, will be present at the end of the experiment. The PCR product therefore
has to be cloned and the sequences of individual clones checked to find one that has just
the desired mutation.
The potential of in vitro mutagenesis
In vitro mutagenesis has remarkable potential, both for pure research and for applied
biotechnology. For example, the biochemist can now ask very specific questions about
the way that protein structure affects the action of an enzyme. In the past, it has been
possible through biochemical analysis to gain some idea of the identity of the amino

Part II The Applications of Gene Cloning and DNA Analysis in Research

206

acids that provide the substrate binding and catalytic functions of an enzyme molecule.
Mutagenesis techniques provide a much more detailed picture by enabling the role of
each individual amino acid to be assessed by replacing it with an alternative residue and
determining the effect this has on the enzymatic activity.
The ability to manipulate enzymes in this way has resulted in dramatic advances
in our understanding of biological catalysis and has led to the new field of protein
engineering, in which mutagenesis techniques are used to develop new enzymes for
biotechnological purposes. For example, careful alterations to the amino acid sequence
of subtilisin, an enzyme used in biological washing powders, have resulted in engineered
versions with greater resistances to the thermal and bleaching (oxidative) stresses
encountered in washing machines.

12.1 Genome annotation
12.2 Studies of the transcriptome and proteome

At the start of the 21st century the emphasis in molecular biology shifted from the
study of individual genes to the study of entire genomes. This change in emphasis
was prompted by the development during the 1990s of methods for sequencing large
genomes. Genome sequencing predates the 1990s—we saw in Chapter 10 how the first
genome, that of the phage dX174, was completed in 1975—but it was not until
20 years later, in 1995, that the first genome of a free-living organism, the bacterium
Haemophilus influenzae, was completely sequenced. The next five years were a watershed with the genome sequences of almost 50 other bacteria published, along with
complete sequences for the much larger genomes of yeast, fruit fly, Caenorhabditis
elegans (a nematode worm), Arabidopsis thaliana (a plant), and humans. Today, the
sequencing of bacterial genomes has become routine, with over 900 completed, and
almost 100 eukaryotic genomes have also been sequenced.
Genome sequencing has led to the development of a new area of DNA research,
loosely called post-genomics or functional genomics. Post-genomics includes the use
of computer systems in genome annotation, the process by which the genes, control
sequences, and other interesting features are identified in a genome sequence, as well as
computer-based and experimental techniques aimed at determining the functions of any
unknown genes that are discovered. Post-genomics also encompasses techniques
designed to identify which genes are expressed in a particular type of cell or tissue, and
how this pattern of genome expression changes over time.

12.1 Genome annotation
Once a genome sequence has been completed, the next step is to locate all the genes and
determine their functions. It is in this area that bioinformatics, sometimes referred to

as molecular biology in silico, is proving of major value as an adjunct to conventional
experiments.
Genome annotation is a far from trivial process, even with genomes that have been
extensively studied by genetic analysis and gene cloning techniques prior to complete
sequencing. For example, the sequence of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, one of
the best studied of all organisms, revealed that this genome contains about 6000 genes.
Of these, some 3600 could be assigned a function either on the basis of previous
studies that had been carried out with yeast or because the yeast gene had a similar
sequence to a gene that had been studied in another organism. This left 2400 genes
whose functions were not known. Despite a massive amount of work since the yeast
genome was completed in 1996, the functions of many of these orphans have still not
been determined.

12.1.1 Identifying the genes in a genome sequence
Locating a gene in a genome sequence is easy if the amino acid sequence of the protein
product is known, allowing the nucleotide sequence of the gene to be predicted, or if
the corresponding cDNA has been previously sequenced. But for many genes there is no
prior information that enables the correct DNA sequence to be recognized. How can
these genes be located in a genome sequence?
Searching for open reading frames
The DNA sequence of a gene is an open reading frame (ORF), a series of nucleotide
triplets beginning with an initiation codon (usually but not always ATG) and ending in
a termination codon (TAA, TAG, or TGA in most genomes). Searching a genome
sequence for ORFs, by eye or more usually by computer, is therefore the first step in
gene location. When carrying out the search it is important to remember that each DNA
sequence has six reading frames, three in one direction and three in the reverse direction on the complementary strand (Figure 12.1).
The key to the success of ORF scanning is the frequency with which termination
codons appear in the DNA sequence. If the DNA has a random sequence and a GC content of 50%, then each of the three termination codons will appear, on average, once
every 43 = 64 bp. This means that there should not be many ORFs longer than 30–40
codons in random DNA, and not all of these ORFs will start with ATG. Most genes are
much longer than this: the average lengths are 317 codons for Escherichia coli, 483
codons for S. cerevisiae, and approximately 450 codons for humans. ORF scanning, in
its simplest form, therefore takes a figure of 100 codons as the shortest length of a putative gene and records positive hits for all ORFs longer than this.
With bacterial genomes, simple ORF scanning is an effective way of locating most of
the genes in a DNA sequence. Most bacterial genes are much longer than 100 codons

in length and so are easily recognized (Figure 12.2). With bacteria the analysis is further
simplified by the fact that most genes are closely spaced with very little intergenic DNA
between them. If we assume that the real genes do not overlap, which is true for most
bacterial genomes, then it is only in these short intergenic regions that there is a possibility of mistaking a spurious ORF for a real gene.
Simple ORF scans are less effective at locating genes in eukaryotic genomes
Although ORF scans work well for bacterial genomes, they are less effective for locating genes in eukaryotic genomes. This is partly because there is substantially more intergenic DNA in a eukaryotic genome, increasing the chances of finding spurious ORFs,
but the main problem is the presence of introns (see Figure 11.1). If a gene contains one
or more introns, then it does not appear as a continuous ORF in the genome sequence.
Many exons are shorter than 100 codons, some fewer than 50 codons, and continuing
the reading frame into an intron usually leads to a termination sequence that appears
to close the ORF (Figure 12.3). In other words, many of the genes in a eukaryotic
genome are not long ORFs, and simple ORF scanning cannot locate them.
Finding ways of locating genes by inspection of a eukaryotic sequence is a major challenge in bioinformatics. Three approaches are being followed:
l

Codon bias can be taken into account. Not all codons are used equally frequently
in the genes of a particular organism. For example, leucine is specified by six
codons (TTA, TTG, CTT, CTC, CTA, and CTG), but in human genes leucine
is most frequently coded by CTG and is only rarely specified by TTA or CTA.
Similarly, of the four valine codons, human genes use GTG four times more
frequently than GTA. The biological reason for codon bias is not understood,
but all organisms have a bias, which is different in different species. Real exons
display this bias, whereas chance series of triplets usually do not.

ORF scans are complicated by introns. The nucleotide sequence of a short gene containing a single intron is shown.
The correct amino acid sequence of the protein translated from the gene is given immediately below the nucleotide
sequence, using the single-letter amino acid abbreviations. In this sequence the intron has been left out, because it
is removed from the transcript before the mRNA is translated into protein. In the lower line, the sequence has been
translated without recognizing that an intron is present. As a result of this error, the amino acid sequence appears to
terminate within the intron.

Exon–intron boundaries can be searched for as these have distinctive sequence
features, although unfortunately the distinctiveness of these sequences is not so
great as to make their location a trivial task. In vertebrates, the sequence of the
upstream exon–intron boundary is usually described as 5′–AG↓GTAAGT–3′
and the downstream one as 5′–PyPyPyPyPyPyNCAG↓–3′, where “Py” means
one of the pyrimidine nucleotides (T or C), “N” is any nucleotide, and the arrow
shows the precise location of the boundary (Figure 12.4). These are consensus
sequences, the averages of a large number of related but non-identical sequences,
so the search has to include not just the sequences shown but also at least the most
common variants. Despite these problems, this type of search can sometimes help
delineate the locations of the exons within a region thought to contain a gene.
Upstream regulatory sequences can be used to locate the regions where genes
begin. This is because these regulatory sequences, like exon–intron boundaries,
have distinctive sequence features that they possess in order to carry out their role
as recognition signals for the DNA binding proteins involved in gene expression.
As with exon–intron boundaries, the regulatory sequences are variable, and not all
genes have the same collection of regulatory sequences. Using these to locate genes
is therefore problematic.

These three extensions of simple ORF scanning, despite their limitations, are generally applicable to all higher eukaryotic genomes. Additional strategies are also possible
with individual organisms based on the special features of their genomes. For example,
vertebrate genomes contain CpG islands upstream of many genes, these being sequences
of approximately 1 kb in which the GC content is greater than the average for the
genome as a whole. Some 40–50% of human genes have an upstream CpG island. These
sequences are distinctive and when one is located in vertebrate DNA, a strong assumption can be made that a gene begins in the region immediately downstream.
Gene location is aided by homology searching
Tentative identification of a gene is usually followed by a homology search. This is an
analysis, carried out by computer, in which the sequence of the gene is compared with
all the gene sequences present in the international DNA databases, not just known genes
of the organism under study but also genes from all other species. The rationale is that
two genes from different organisms that have similar functions have similar sequences,
reflecting their common evolutionary histories (Figure 12.5).
To carry out a homology search the nucleotide sequence of the tentative gene is
usually translated into an amino acid sequence, as this allows a more sensitive search.
This is because there are 20 different amino acids but only 4 nucleotides, so there
is less chance of 2 amino acid sequences appearing to be similar purely by chance

Figure 12.6
Lack of homology between two sequences is often more apparent when comparisons are made at the amino acid level.
Two nucleotide sequences are shown, with nucleotides that are identical in the two sequences given in red and nonidentities given in blue. The two nucleotide sequences are 76% identical, as indicated by the asterisks. This might be
taken as evidence that the sequences are homologous. However, when the sequences are translated into amino acids,
the identity decreases to 28%, suggesting that the genes are not homologous, and that the similarity at the nucleotide
level was fortuitous. Identical amino acids are shown in brown, and non-identities in green. The amino acid sequences
have been written using the one-letter abbreviations.

(Figure 12.6). The analysis is carried out through the internet, by logging on to the web
site of one of the DNA databases and using a search program such as BLAST (Basic
Local Alignment Search Tool). If the test sequence is over 200 amino acids in length and
has 30% or greater identity with a sequence in the database (i.e., at 30 out of 100 positions the same amino acid occurs in both sequences), then the two are almost certainly
homologous and the ORF under study can be confirmed as a real gene. Further
confirmation, if needed, can be obtained by using transcript analysis (p. 186) to show
that the gene is transcribed into RNA.
Comparing the sequences of related genomes
A more precise version of homology searching is possible when genome sequences
are available for two or more related species. Related species have genomes that share
similarities inherited from their common ancestor, overladen with species-specific differences that have arisen since the two species began to evolve independently. Because
of natural selection, the sequence similarities between related genomes is greatest within
the genes and least in the intergenic regions. Therefore, when related genomes are compared, homologous genes are easily identified because they have high sequence similarity,
and any ORF that does not have a clear homolog in the related genome can discounted
as almost certainly being a chance sequence and not a genuine gene (Figure 12.7).
This type of homology analysis—called comparative genomics—has proved very
valuable for locating genes in the S. cerevisiae genome, as complete or partial sequences
are now available not only for this yeast but also for several related species, such as
Saccharomyces paradoxus, Saccharomyces mikatae, and Saccharomyces bayanus.
Comparisons between these genomes has confirmed the authenticity of a number of
S. cerevisiae ORFs, and also enabled almost 500 putative ORFs to be discounted on
the grounds that they have no equivalents in the related genomes. The gene maps of

these yeasts are very similar, and although each genome has undergone its own speciesspecific rearrangements, there are still substantial regions where the gene order in the
S. cerevisiae genome is the same as in one or more of the related genomes. Conservation of gene order is called synteny, and it makes it very easy to identify homologous
genes. More importantly, a spurious ORF, especially a short one, can be discarded with
confidence, because its expected location in a related genome can be searched in detail
to ensure that no equivalent is present.

12.1.2 Determining the function of an unknown gene
Homology searching serves two purposes. As well as testing the veracity of a tentative
gene, identification it can also give an indication of the function of the gene, presuming that the function of the homologous gene is known. Almost 2000 of the genes in the
yeast genome were assigned functions in this way. Frequently, however, the matches
found by homology searching are to other genes whose functions have yet to be determined. These unassigned genes are called orphans and working out their function is
one of the key objectives of post-genomics research.
In future years it will probably be possible to use bioinformatics to gain at least an
insight into the function of an orphan gene. It is already possible to use the nucleotide
sequence of a gene to predict the positions of a-helices and b-sheets in the encoded protein, albeit with limited accuracy, and the resulting structural information can sometimes be used to make inferences about the function of the protein. Proteins that attach
to membranes can often be identified because they possess a-helical arrangements that
span the membrane, and DNA binding motifs such as zinc fingers can be recognized. A
greater scope and accuracy to this aspect of bioinformatics will be possible when more
information is obtained about the relationship between the structure of a protein and
its function. In the meantime, functional analysis of orphans depends largely on conventional experiments.
Assigning gene function by experimental analysis requires a reverse approach to
genetics
Experimental identification of the function of an unknown gene is proving to be one of
the biggest challenges in genomics research. The problem is that the objective—to plot
a course from gene to function—is the reverse of the route normally taken by genetic
analysis, in which the starting point is a phenotype and the objective is to identify the
underlying gene or genes (Figure 12.8). In conventional genetic analysis, the genetic
basis of a phenotype is usually studied by searching for mutant organisms in which the
phenotype has become altered. The mutants might be obtained experimentally, for
example by treating a population of organisms, such as a culture of bacteria, with ultraviolet radiation or a mutagenic chemical, or the mutants might be present in a natural
population. The gene or genes that have been altered in the mutant organism are then
studied by genetic crosses, which can locate the position of a gene in a genome and also

determine if the gene is the same as one that has already been characterized. The gene
can then be studied further by molecular biology techniques such as cloning and
sequencing.
The general principle of this conventional analysis—forward genetics—is that the
genes responsible for a phenotype can be identified by determining which genes are
inactivated in organisms that display a mutant version of the phenotype. If the starting
point is the gene, rather than the phenotype, then the equivalent strategy—reverse genetics
—would be to mutate the gene and identify the phenotypic change that results. This is
the basis of most of the techniques used to assign functions to unknown genes.
Specific genes can be inactivated by homologous recombination
The easiest way to inactivate a specific gene is to disrupt it with an unrelated segment
of DNA (Figure 12.9). This can be achieved by homologous recombination between
the chromosomal copy of the gene and a second piece of DNA that shares some
sequence identity with the target gene.
How is gene inactivation carried out in practice? We will consider two examples,
the first with S. cerevisiae. Since completing the genome sequence in 1996, yeast molecular biologists have embarked on a coordinated, international effort to determine the
functions of as many of the unknown genes as possible. One technique makes use of a
deletion cassette, which carries a gene for antibiotic resistance (Figure 12.10). This gene
is not a normal component of the yeast genome but it will work if transferred into a
yeast chromosome, giving rise to a transformed yeast cell that is resistant to the antibiotic geneticin. Before using the deletion cassette, new segments of DNA are attached
as tails to either end. These segments have sequences identical to parts of the yeast gene
that is going to be inactivated. After the modified cassette is introduced into a yeast cell,
homologous recombination occurs between the DNA tails and the chromosomal copy
of the yeast gene, replacing the latter with the antibiotic resistance gene. The target
gene therefore becomes inactivated. Cells which have undergone the replacement are
selected by plating the culture onto agar medium containing geneticin, and their phenotypes examined to gain some insight into the function of the gene.
The second example of gene inactivation uses an analogous process, but with mice
rather than yeast. The mouse is frequently used as a model organism for humans because

the mouse genome contains many of the same genes. Identifying the functions of
unknown human genes is therefore being carried out largely by inactivating the equivalent genes in mice. The homologous recombination part of the procedure is identical
to that described for yeast and once again results in a cell in which the target gene has
been inactivated. The problem is that we do not want just one mutant cell, we want a
whole mutant mouse, as only with the complete organism can we make a full assessment
of the effect of the gene inactivation on the phenotype. To achieve this, the vector
carrying the deletion cassette is initially microinjected into an embryonic stem cell
(p. 124). The eventual result is a knockout mouse, whose phenotype will, with luck,
provide the desired information on the function of the gene being studied.

12.2 Studies of the transcriptome and proteome
So far we have considered those aspects of post-genomics research that are concerned
with studies of individual genes. The change in emphasis from genes to the genome has
resulted in new types of analysis that are aimed at understanding the activity of the
genome as a whole. This work has led to the invention of two new terms:
l

l

The transcriptome, which is the messenger RNA (mRNA) content of a cell, and
which reflects the overall pattern of gene expression in that cell;
The proteome, which is the protein content of a cell and which reflects its
biochemical capability.

Chapter 12 Studying Genomes

12.2.1 Studying the transcriptome
Transcriptomes can have highly complex compositions, containing hundreds or
thousands of different mRNAs, each making up a different fraction of the overall population. To characterize a transcriptome it is therefore necessary to identify the mRNAs
that it contains and, ideally, to determine their relative abundances.
Studying a transcriptome by sequence analysis
The most direct way to characterize a transcriptome is to convert its mRNA into cDNA,
and then to sequence every clone in the resulting cDNA library. Comparisons between
the cDNA sequences and the genome sequence will reveal the identities of the genes
whose mRNAs are present in the transcriptome. This approach is feasible but it is
laborious, with many different cDNA sequences being needed before a near-complete
picture of the composition of the transcriptome begins to emerge. Can any shortcuts be
used to obtain the vital sequence information more quickly?
Serial analysis of gene expression (SAGE) provides one possible solution. Rather than
studying complete cDNAs, SAGE yields short sequences, as little as 12 bp in length,
each of which represents an mRNA present in the transcriptome. The basis of the
technique is that these 12 bp sequences, despite their shortness, are sufficient to enable
the gene that codes for the mRNA to be identified.
The first step in generating the 12 bp sequences is to immobilize the mRNA in a
chromatography column by annealing the poly(A) tails present at the 3′ ends of these
molecules to oligo(dT) strands that have been attached to cellulose beads (Figure 12.11).
The mRNA is converted into double-stranded cDNA and then treated with a restriction
enzyme that recognizes a 4 bp target site, such as AluI, and so cuts frequently in each
cDNA. The terminal restriction fragment of each cDNA remains attached to the cellulose beads, enabling all the other fragments to be eluted and discarded. A short linker
is now attached to the free end of each cDNA, this linker containing a recognition
sequence for BsmFI. This is an unusual restriction enzyme in that rather than cutting
within its recognition sequence, it cuts 10–14 nucleotides downstream. Treatment with
BsmFI therefore removes a fragment with an average length of 12 bp from the end of
each cDNA. The fragments are collected, ligated head-to-tail to produce a catenane,
and sequenced. The individual sequences can be identified within the catenane, because
they are separated by BsmFI sites.
Studying transcriptomes by microarray or chip analysis
SAGE enables individual mRNAs to be identified in a transcriptome, but provides only
approximate information on the relative abundances of those mRNAs. The dominance
of one particular type of mRNA in a transcriptome, such as the gliadin mRNAs in wheat
seeds (p. 131), will be evident from the frequency of those mRNA sequences among the
SAGE fragments, but more subtle variations in mRNA levels will not be apparent.
Techniques that enable more accurate comparisons of the amounts of individual
mRNAs were first developed as part of the yeast post-genomics project. In essence, these
techniques involve a sophisticated type of hybridization analysis. Every yeast gene—all
6000 of them—was obtained as an individual clone and samples spotted onto glass slides
in arrays of 80 × 80 spots. This is called a microarray. To determine which genes are
active in yeast cells grown under particular conditions, mRNA was extracted from the
cells, converted to cDNA and the cDNA labeled and hybridized to the microarrays
(Figure 12.12). Fluorescent labels were used and hybridization was detected by

indicated genes that were active under the conditions being studied, and the intensities
of the hybridization signals revealed the relative amounts of the mRNAs in the
transcriptome. Changes in gene expression, when the yeast were transferred to different growth conditions (e.g., oxygen starvation), could be monitored by repeating the
experiment with a second cDNA preparation.
Microarrays are now being used to monitor changes in the transcriptomes of many
organisms. In some cases the strategy is the same as used with yeast, the microarray representing all the genes in the genome, but this is possible only for those organisms that

have relatively few genes. A microarray for all the human genes could be carried by just
10 glass slides of 18 × 18 mm, but preparing clones of every one of the 20,000–30,000
human genes would be a massive task. Fortunately this is not necessary. For example,
to study changes in the transcriptome occurring as a result of cancer, a microarray could
be prepared with a cDNA library from normal tissue. Hybridization with labeled cDNA
from the cancerous tissue would then reveal which genes are up- or down-regulated in
response to the cancerous state.
An alternative to microarrays is provided by DNA chips, which are thin wafers of
silicon that carry many different oligonucleotides (Figure 12.13). These oligonucleotides
are synthesized directly on the surface of the chip and can be prepared at a density of
1 million per cm2, substantially higher than is possible with a conventional microarray.
Hybridization between an oligonucleotide and the probe is detected electronically.
Because the oligonucleotides are synthesized de novo, using special automated procedures, a chip carrying 20,000–30,000 oligonucleotides, each one specific for a different
human gene, is relatively easy to prepare.

12.2.2 Studying the proteome
The proteome is the entire collection of proteins in a cell. Proteome studies (also called
proteomics) provide additional information that is not obtainable simply by examining
the transcriptome. Examination of the transcriptome gives an accurate indication of
which genes are active in a particular cell, but gives a less accurate indication of the
proteins that are present. This is because the factors that influence protein content
include not only the amount of each mRNA that is available, but also the rate at which
an mRNA is translated into protein and the rate at which the protein is degraded.
The method used to identify the constituents of a proteome is called protein profiling.
This is based on two techniques—protein electrophoresis and mass spectrometry—both
of which have long pedigrees but which were rarely applied together in the pregenomics era.
Separating the proteins in a proteome
In order to characterize a proteome, it is first necessary to prepare pure samples of its
constituent proteins. A mammalian cell may contain 10,000–20,000 different proteins,
so a highly discriminating separation system is needed.

Two-dimensional gel electrophoresis.

Polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis is the standard method for separating the proteins in a mixture. Depending on the composition of the gel and the conditions under
which the electrophoresis is carried out, different chemical and physical properties
of proteins can be used as the basis for their separation. The most popular technique
makes use of the detergent called sodium dodecyl sulphate, which denatures proteins
and confers a negative charge that is roughly equivalent to the length of the unfolded
polypeptide. Under these conditions, the proteins separate according to their molecular
masses, the smallest proteins migrating more quickly toward the positive electrode.
Alternatively, proteins can be separated by isoelectric focusing in a gel that contains
chemicals which establish a pH gradient when the electrical charge is applied. In this
type of gel, a protein migrates to its isoelectric point, the position in the gradient where
its net charge is zero.
In protein profiling, these methods are combined in two-dimensional gel electrophoresis. In the first dimension, the proteins are separated by isoelectric focusing. The
gel is then soaked in sodium dodecyl sulphate, rotated by 90° and a second electrophoresis, separating the proteins according to their sizes, carried out at right angles to the
first (Figure 12.14). This approach can separate several thousand proteins in a single gel.
After electrophoresis, staining the gel reveals a complex pattern of spots, each one
containing a different protein. When two gels are compared, differences in the pattern
and intensities of the spots indicate differences in the identities and relative amounts of
individual proteins in the two proteomes that are being studied. Interesting spots can
therefore be targeted for the second stage of profiling in which actual protein identities
are determined.
Identifying the individual proteins after separation
The second stage of protein profiling is to identify the individual proteins that have
been separated from the starting mixture. This used to be a difficult proposition but
peptide mass fingerprinting has provided a rapid and accurate identification procedure.
Peptide mass fingerprinting was made possible by advances in mass spectrometry.
Mass spectrometry was originally designed as a means of identifying a compound from
the mass-to-charge ratios of the ionized forms that are produced when molecules of the
compound are exposed to a high-energy field. The standard technique could not be
used with proteins because they are too large to be ionized effectively, but matrixassisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF), gets around this problem, at least with peptides of up to 50 amino acids in length. Of course, most proteins
are much longer than 50 amino acids, and it is therefore necessary to break them into
fragments before examining them by MALDI-TOF. The usual approach is to digest
the protein with a sequence-specific protease, such as trypsin, which cleaves proteins
immediately after arginine or lysine residues. With most proteins, this results in a series
of peptides 5–75 amino acids in length.

The use of MALDI-TOF in mass spectrometry. Ionized peptides are injected into the mass spectrometer (a) and their
mass-to-charge ratios measured and displayed as a spectrum (b).

Once ionized, the mass-to-charge ratio of a peptide is determined from its “time of
flight” within the mass spectrometer as it passes from the ionization source to the detector
(Figure 12.15). The mass-to-charge ratio enables the molecular mass of the peptide to
be worked out, which in turn allows its amino acid composition to be deduced. If a
number of peptides from a single protein spot in the two-dimensional gel are analyzed,
then the resulting compositional information can be related to the genome sequence to
identify the gene that specifies that protein.
If two proteomes are being compared, then a key requirement is that proteins that
are present in different amounts can be identified. If the differences are relatively large,
then they will be apparent simply by looking at the stained gels after two-dimensional
electrophoresis. However, important changes in the biochemical properties of a proteome can result from relatively minor changes in the amounts of individual proteins,
and methods for detecting small-scale changes are therefore essential. One possibility is
to label the constituents of two proteomes with different fluorescent markers, and then
run them together in a single two-dimensional gel. Visualization of the two-dimensional
gel at different wavelengths enables the intensities of equivalent spots to be judged more
easily than is possible when two separate gels are obtained. A more accurate alternative
is to label each proteome with an isotope coded affinity tag (ICAT). These markers can be
obtained in two forms, one containing normal hydrogen atoms and the other containing deuterium, the heavy isotope of hydrogen. The normal and heavy versions can be
distinguished by mass spectrometry, enabling the relative amounts of a protein in two

12.2.3 Studying protein–protein interactions
Important information on the activity of a genome can also be obtained by identifying
pairs or groups of proteins that work together. Within living cells, few if any proteins
act in total isolation. Instead, proteins interact with one another in biochemical pathways and in multiprotein complexes. Two important techniques, phage display and the
yeast two hybrid system, enable these protein–protein interactions to be examined.
Phage display
This technique is called phage display because it involves the “display” of proteins on
the surface of a bacteriophage, usually M13 (Figure 12.17a). This is achieved by cloning
the gene for the protein in a special type of M13 vector, one that results in the cloned
gene becoming fused with a gene for a phage coat protein (Figure 12.17b). After transfection of E. coli, this gene fusion directs synthesis of a hybrid protein, made up partly
of the coat protein and partly of the product of the cloned gene. With luck this hybrid
protein will be inserted into the phage coat so that the product of the cloned gene is now
located on the surface of the phage particles.
Normally this technique is carried out with a phage display library made up of many
recombinant phages, each displaying a different protein. Large libraries can be prepared
by cloning a mixture of cDNAs from a particular tissue or, less easily, by cloning
genomic DNA fragments. The library consists of phages displaying a range of different
proteins and is used to identify those that interact with a test protein. This test protein
could be a pure protein or one that is itself displayed on a phage surface. The protein is
immobilized in the wells of a microtiter tray or on particles that can be used in an affinity
chromatography column, and then mixed with the phage display library (Figure 12.17c).
Phages that are retained in the microtiter tray or within the column after a series of
washes are ones that display proteins that interact with the immobilized test protein.
The yeast two hybrid system
The yeast two hybrid system is very different to phage display. This procedure is based
on the discovery that gene expression in S. cerevisiae depends on interactions between
pairs of transcription factors (Figure 12.18a). In the two hybrid system, a pair of
transcription factors responsible for expression of a yeast gene is replaced by hybrid
proteins, each one made partly of transcription factor and partly of test protein. The
ability of this pair of hybrids to direct expression of the yeast target gene is then tested.

Part II The Applications of Gene Cloning and DNA Analysis in Research

To use the system, two yeast cloning experiments must be carried out. The first
cloning experiment involves the gene whose protein product is being studied. This gene
is ligated to the gene for one of the pair of transcription factors and the construct
inserted into a yeast vector. The recombinant yeasts that are produced are not able to
express the target gene, because this modified transcription factor cannot interact with
its partner (Figure 12.18b).
In the second cloning experiment, a hybrid version of the partner is made and cloned
into the yeast cells. Restoration of expression of the target gene indicates that the two
hybrid transcription factors can interact. The fusions are designed in such a way that this
can only happen if the interactions occur between the test protein components of the
hybrids, not between the transcription factor segments (Figure 12.18c). Pairs of interacting test proteins are therefore identified. The second cloning experiment can involve
a library of recombinants representing different proteins, so that one protein can be
tested against many others.

13.3 Production of recombinant protein by eukaryotic cells

Now that we have covered the basic techniques involved in gene cloning and DNA analysis and examined how these techniques are used in research, we can move on to consider how recombinant DNA technology is being applied in biotechnology. This is not
a new subject, although biotechnology has received far more attention during recent
years than it ever has in the past. Biotechnology can be defined as the use of biological
processes in industry and technology. According to archaeologists, the British biotechnology industry dates back 4000 years, to the late Neolithic period, when fermentation
processes that make use of living yeast cells to produce ale and mead were first introduced into this country. Certainly brewing was well established by the time of the
Roman invasion.
During the 20th century, biotechnology expanded with the development of a variety of industrial uses for microorganisms. The discovery by Alexander Fleming in 1929
that the mould Penicillium synthesizes a potent antibacterial agent led to the use of
fungi and bacteria in the large-scale production of antibiotics. At first the microorganisms were grown in large culture vessels from which the antibiotic was purified after the
cells had been removed (Figure 13.1a), but this batch culture method has been largely
supplanted by continuous culture techniques, making use of a fermenter, from which
samples of medium can be continuously drawn off, providing a non-stop supply of the
product (Figure 13.1b). This type of process is not limited to antibiotic production and
has also been used to obtain large amounts of other compounds produced by microorganisms (Table 13.1).
One of the reasons why biotechnology has received so much attention during the
past three decades is because of gene cloning. Although many useful products can be

obtained from microbial culture, the list in the past has been limited to those compounds
naturally synthesized by microorganisms. Many important pharmaceuticals, which are
produced not by microbes but by higher organisms, could not be obtained in this way.
This has been changed by the application of gene cloning to biotechnology. The ability
to clone genes means that a gene for an important animal or plant protein can now
be taken from its normal host, inserted into a cloning vector, and introduced into a
bacterium (Figure 13.2). If the manipulations are performed correctly the gene will be

expressed and the recombinant protein synthesized by the bacterial cell. It may then be
possible to obtain large amounts of the protein.
Of course, in practice the production of recombinant protein is not as easy as it sounds.
Special types of cloning vector are needed, and satisfactory yields of recombinant protein
are often difficult to obtain. In this chapter we will look at cloning vectors for recombinant protein synthesis and examine some of the problems associated with their use.

13.1 Special vectors for expression of foreign
genes in E. coli
If a foreign (i.e., non-bacterial) gene is simply ligated into a standard vector and cloned
in E. coli, it is very unlikely that a significant amount of recombinant protein will be
synthesized. This is because expression is dependent on the gene being surrounded by
a collection of signals that can be recognized by the bacterium. These signals, which are
short sequences of nucleotides, advertise the presence of the gene and provide instructions for the transcriptional and translational apparatus of the cell. The three most
important signals for E. coli genes are as follows (Figure 13.3):
l

The promoter, which marks the point at which transcription of the gene should
start. In E. coli, the promoter is recognized by the g subunit of the transcribing
enzyme RNA polymerase.

The terminator, which marks the point at the end of the gene where transcription
should stop. A terminator is usually a nucleotide sequence that can base pair with
itself to form a stem–loop structure.
The ribosome binding site, a short nucleotide sequence recognized by the
ribosome as the point at which it should attach to the mRNA molecule. The
initiation codon of the gene is always a few nucleotides downstream of this site.

The genes of higher organisms are also surrounded by expression signals, but their
nucleotide sequences are not the same as the E. coli versions. This is illustrated by comparing the promoters of E. coli and human genes (Figure 13.4). There are similarities,
but it is unlikely that an E. coli RNA polymerase would be able to attach to a human
promoter. A foreign gene is inactive in E. coli, simply because the bacterium does not
recognize its expression signals.
A solution to this problem would be to insert the foreign gene into the vector in such
a way that it is placed under control of a set of E. coli expression signals. If this can be
achieved, then the gene should be transcribed and translated (Figure 13.5). Cloning
vectors that provide these signals, and can therefore be used in the production of recombinant protein, are called expression vectors.

13.1.1 The promoter is the critical component of an expression
vector
The promoter is the most important component of an expression vector. This is because
the promoter controls the very first stage of gene expression (attachment of an RNA
polymerase enzyme to the DNA) and determines the rate at which mRNA is synthesized. The amount of recombinant protein obtained therefore depends to a great extent
on the nature of the promoter carried by the expression vector.
The promoter must be chosen with care
The two sequences shown in Figure 13.4a are consensus sequences, averages of all
the E. coli promoter sequences that are known. Although most E. coli promoters do not

differ much from these consensus sequences (e.g., TTTACA instead of TTGACA), a
small variation may have a major effect on the efficiency with which the promoter can
direct transcription. Strong promoters are those that can sustain a high rate of transcription; strong promoters usually control genes whose translation products are
required in large amounts by the cell (Figure 13.6a). In contrast, weak promoters, which
are relatively inefficient, direct transcription of genes whose products are needed in
only small amounts (Figure 13.6b). Clearly an expression vector should carry a strong
promoter, so that the cloned gene is transcribed at the highest possible rate.
A second factor to be considered when constructing an expression vector is whether
it will be possible to regulate the promoter in any way. Two major types of gene
regulation are recognized in E. coli—induction and repression. An inducible gene is one
whose transcription is switched on by addition of a chemical to the growth medium;
often this chemical is one of the substrates for the enzyme coded by the inducible gene
(Figure 13.7a). In contrast, a repressible gene is switched off by addition of the regulatory chemical (Figure 13.7b)).
Gene regulation is a complex process that only indirectly involves the promoter itself.
However, many of the sequences important for induction and repression lie in the
region surrounding the promoter and are therefore also present in an expression vector.
It may therefore be possible to extend the regulation to the expression vector, so that
the chemical that induces or represses the gene normally controlled by the promoter is
also able to regulate expression of the cloned gene. This can be a distinct advantage in
the production of recombinant protein. For example, if the recombinant protein has a

harmful effect on the bacterium, then its synthesis must be carefully monitored to prevent accumulation of toxic levels: this can be achieved by judicious use of the regulatory chemical to control expression of the cloned gene. Even if the recombinant protein
has no harmful effects on the host cell, regulation of the cloned gene is still desirable,
as a continuously high level of transcription may affect the ability of the recombinant
plasmid to replicate, leading to its eventual loss from the culture.

Five promoters frequently used in expression vectors. The lac and trp promoters are shown upstream of the genes that
they normally control in E. coli.

Examples of promoters used in expression vectors
Several E. coli promoters combine the desired features of strength and ease of regulation. Those most frequently used in expression vectors are as follows:
l

l

l

The lac promoter (Figure 13.8a) is the sequence that controls transcription of
the lacZ gene coding for b-galactosidase (and also the lacZ′ gene fragment carried
by the pUC and M13mp vectors; p. 79). The lac promoter is induced by
isopropylthiogalactoside (IPTG, p. 80), so addition of this chemical into the
growth medium switches on transcription of a gene inserted downstream of the
lac promoter carried by an expression vector.
The trp promoter (Figure 13.8b) is normally upstream of the cluster of genes
coding for several of the enzymes involved in biosynthesis of the amino acid
tryptophan. The trp promoter is repressed by tryptophan, but is more easily
induced by 3-b-indoleacrylic acid.
The tac promoter (Figure 13.8c) is a hybrid between the trp and lac promoters.
It is stronger than either, but still induced by IPTG.
The EPL promoter (Figure 13.8d) is one of the promoters responsible for
transcription of the e DNA molecule. ePL is a very strong promoter that is
recognized by the E. coli RNA polymerase, which is subverted by e into
transcribing the bacteriophage DNA. The promoter is repressed by the product
of the ecI gene. Expression vectors that carry the ePL promoter are used with a
mutant E. coli host that synthesizes a temperature-sensitive form of the cI protein
(p. 40). At a low temperature (less than 30°C) this mutant cI protein is able to

Part III The Applications of Gene Cloning and DNA Analysis in Biotechnology

232

l

repress the ePL promoter, but at higher temperatures the protein is inactivated,
resulting in transcription of the cloned gene.
The T7 promoter (Figure 13.8e) is specific for the RNA polymerase coded by
T7 bacteriophage. This RNA polymerase is much more active than the E. coli
RNA polymerase (p. 93), which means that a gene inserted downstream of the T7
promoter will be expressed at a high level. The gene for the T7 RNA polymerase is
not normally present in the E. coli genome, so a special strain of E. coli is needed,
one which is lysogenic for T7 phage. Remember that a lysogen contains an inserted
copy of the phage DNA in its genome (p. 19). In this particular strain of E. coli,
the phage DNA has been altered by placing a copy of the lac promoter upstream
of its gene for the T7 RNA polymerase. Addition of IPTG to the growth medium
therefore switches on synthesis of the T7 RNA polymerase, which in turn leads to
activation of the gene carried by the T7 expression vector.

13.1.2 Cassettes and gene fusions
An efficient expression vector requires not only a strong, regulatable promoter, but also
an E. coli ribosome binding sequence and a terminator. In most vectors these expression signals form a cassette, so-called because the foreign gene is inserted into a unique
restriction site present in the middle of the expression signal cluster (Figure 13.9).
Ligation of the foreign gene into the cassette therefore places it in the ideal position
relative to the expression signals.
With some cassette vectors the cloning site is not immediately adjacent to the ribosome binding sequence, but instead is preceded by a segment from the beginning of an
E. coli gene (Figure 13.10). Insertion of the foreign gene into this restriction site must
be performed in such a way as to fuse the two reading frames, producing a hybrid gene
that starts with the E. coli segment and progresses without a break into the codons
of the foreign gene. The product of gene expression is therefore a hybrid or fusion
protein, consisting of the short peptide coded by the E. coli reading frame fused to
the amino-terminus of the foreign protein. This fusion system has four advantages:
l

Efficient translation of the mRNA produced from the cloned gene depends not
only on the presence of a ribosome binding site, but is also affected by the
nucleotide sequence at the start of the coding region. This is probably because
secondary structures resulting from intrastrand base pairs could interfere with
attachment of the ribosome to its binding site (Figure 13.11). This possibility
is avoided if the pertinent region is made up entirely of natural E. coli
sequences.

The presence of the bacterial peptide at the start of the fusion protein may stabilize
the molecule and prevent it from being degraded by the host cell. In contrast,
foreign proteins that lack a bacterial segment are often destroyed by the host.
The bacterial segment may constitute a signal peptide, responsible for directing
the E. coli protein to its correct position in the cell. If the signal peptide is
derived from a protein that is exported by the cell (e.g., the products of the ompA
or malE genes), the recombinant protein may itself be exported, either into the
culture medium or into the periplasmic space between the inner and outer cell
membranes. Export is desirable as it simplifies the problem of purification of the
recombinant protein from the culture.
The bacterial segment may also aid purification by enabling the fusion protein
to be recovered by affinity chromatography. For example, fusions involving the
E. coli glutathione-S-transferase protein can be purified by adsorption onto agarose
beads carrying bound glutathione (Figure 13.12).

The disadvantage with a fusion system is that the presence of the E. coli segment
may alter the properties of the recombinant protein. Methods for removing the bacterial segment are therefore needed. Usually this is achieved by treating the fusion protein
with a chemical or enzyme that cleaves the polypeptide chain at or near the junction
between the two components. For example, if a methionine is present at the junction,
the fusion protein can be cleaved with cyanogen bromide, which cuts polypeptides

thrombin (which cleaves adjacent to arginine residues) or factor Xa (which cuts after the
arginine of Gly–Arg) can be used. The important consideration is that recognition
sequences for the cleavage agent must not occur within the recombinant protein.

13.2 General problems with the production of
recombinant protein in E. coli
Despite the development of sophisticated expression vectors, there are still numerous
difficulties associated with the production of protein from foreign genes cloned in
E. coli. These problems can be grouped into two categories: those that are due to the
sequence of the foreign gene, and those that are due to the limitations of E. coli as a host
for recombinant protein synthesis.

Chapter 13 Production of Protein from Cloned Genes

235

13.2.1 Problems resulting from the sequence of the foreign
gene
There are three ways in which the nucleotide sequence might prevent efficient expression of a foreign gene cloned in E. coli:
l

l

l

The foreign gene might contain introns. This would be a major problem, as E. coli
genes do not contain introns and therefore the bacterium does not possess the
necessary machinery for removing introns from transcripts (Figure 13.14a).
The foreign gene might contain sequences that act as termination signals in E. coli
(Figure 13.14b). These sequences are perfectly innocuous in the normal host cell,
but in the bacterium result in premature termination and a loss of gene expression.
The codon bias of the gene may not be ideal for translation in E. coli. As described
on p. 209, although virtually all organisms use the same genetic code, each

organism has a bias toward preferred codons. This bias reflects the efficiency with
which the tRNA molecules in the organism are able to recognize the different
codons. If a cloned gene contains a high proportion of disfavored codons, the E.
coli tRNAs may encounter difficulties in translating the gene, reducing the amount
of protein that is synthesized (Figure 13.14c).
These problems can usually be solved, although the necessary manipulations may be
time-consuming and costly (an important consideration in an industrial project). If the
gene contains introns then its complementary DNA (cDNA), prepared from the mRNA
(p. 133) and so lacking introns, might be used as an alternative. In vitro mutagenesis
could then be employed to change the sequences of possible terminators and to replace
disfavored codons with those preferred by E. coli. An alternative with genes that are less
than 1 kb in length is to make an artificial version (p. 204). This involves synthesizing
a set of overlapping oligonucleotides that are ligated together, the sequences of the
oligonucleotides being designed to ensure that the resulting gene contains preferred
E. coli codons and that terminators are absent.

13.2.2 Problems caused by E. coli
Some of the difficulties encountered when using E. coli as the host for recombinant
protein synthesis stem from inherent properties of the bacterium. For example:
l

l

E. coli might not process the recombinant protein correctly. The proteins of most
organisms are processed after translation, by chemical modification of amino acids
within the polypeptide. Often these processing events are essential for the correct
biological activity of the protein. Unfortunately, the proteins of bacteria and
higher organisms are not processed identically. In particular, some animal proteins
are glycosylated, meaning that they have sugar groups attached to them after
translation. Glycosylation is extremely uncommon in bacteria and recombinant
proteins synthesized in E. coli are never glycosylated correctly.
E. coli might not fold the recombinant protein correctly, and generally is unable to
synthesize the disulphide bonds present in many animal proteins. If the protein
does not take up its correctly folded tertiary structure, then usually it is insoluble
and forms an inclusion body within the bacterium (Figure 13.15). Recovery of the
protein from the inclusion body is not a problem, but converting the protein into
its correctly folded form can be difficult or impossible in the test tube. Under these
circumstances the protein is, of course, inactive.

Chapter 13 Production of Protein from Cloned Genes

l

E. coli might degrade the recombinant protein. Exactly how E. coli can recognize
the foreign protein, and thereby subject it to preferential turnover, is not known.

These problems are less easy to solve than the sequence problems described in the
previous section. Degradation of recombinant proteins can be reduced by using as the
host a mutant E. coli strain that is deficient in one or more of the proteases responsible
for protein degradation. Correct folding of recombinant proteins can also be promoted
by choosing a special host strain, in this case one that over-synthesizes the chaperone
proteins thought to be responsible for protein folding in the cell. But the main problem
is the absence of glycosylation. So far this has proved insurmountable, limiting E. coli
to the synthesis of animal proteins that do not need to be processed in this way.

13.3 Production of recombinant protein by
eukaryotic cells
The problems associated with obtaining high yields of active recombinant proteins from
genes cloned in E. coli have led to the development of expression systems for other
organisms. There have been a few attempts to use other bacteria as the hosts for recombinant protein synthesis, and some progress has been made with Bacillus subtilis, but the
main alternatives to E. coli are microbial eukaryotes. The argument is that a microbial
eukaryote, such as a yeast or filamentous fungus, is more closely related to an animal,
and so may be able to deal with recombinant protein synthesis more efficiently than
E. coli. Yeasts and fungi can be grown just as easily as bacteria in continuous culture, and
might express a cloned gene from a higher organism, and process the resulting protein
in a manner more akin to that occurring in the higher organism itself.

13.3.1 Recombinant protein from yeast and filamentous fungi
To a large extent the potential of microbial eukaryotes has been realized and these
organisms are now being used for the routine production of several animal proteins.
Expression vectors are still required because it turns out that the promoters and other
expression signals for animal genes do not, in general, work efficiently in these lower
eukaryotes. The vectors themselves are based on those described in Chapter 7.
Saccharomyces cerevisiae as the host for recombinant protein synthesis
The yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae is currently the most popular microbial eukaryote
for recombinant protein production. Cloned genes are often placed under the control
of the GAL promoter (Figure 13.16a), which is normally upstream of the gene coding
for galactose epimerase, an enzyme involved in the metabolism of galactose. The GAL
promoter is induced by galactose, providing a straightforward system for regulating
expression of a cloned foreign gene. Other useful promoters are PHO5, which is
regulated by the phosphate level in the growth medium, and CUP1, which is induced
by copper. Most yeast expression vectors also carry a termination sequence from an
S. cerevisiae gene, because animal termination signals do not work effectively in yeast.
Yields of recombinant protein are relatively high, but S. cerevisiae is unable to glycosylate animal proteins correctly, often adding too many sugar units (“hyperglycosylation”), although this can be prevented or at least reduced by using a mutant host strain.
S. cerevisiae also lacks an efficient system for secreting proteins into the growth medium.

In the absence of secretion, recombinant proteins are retained in the cell and consequently are less easy to purify. Codon bias (p. 209) can also be a problem.
Despite these drawbacks, S. cerevisiae remains the most frequently used microbial
eukaryote for recombinant protein synthesis, partly because it is accepted as a safe
organism for production of proteins for use in medicines or in foods, and partly because
of the wealth of knowledge built up over the years regarding the biochemistry and genetics
of S. cerevisiae, which means that it is relatively easy to devise strategies for minimizing
the difficulties that arise.
Other yeasts and fungi
Although S. cerevisiae retains the loyalty of many molecular biologists, there are other
microbial eukaryotes that might be equally if not more effective in recombinant protein
synthesis. In particular, Pichia pastoris, a second species of yeast, is able to synthesize
large amounts of recombinant protein (up to 30% of the total cell protein) and its
glycosylation abilities are very similar to those of animal cells. The sugar structures that
it synthesizes are not precisely the same as the animal versions (Figure 13.17), but the
differences are relatively trivial and would probably not have a significant effect on the
activity of a recombinant protein. Importantly, the glycosylated proteins made by
P. pastoris are unlikely to induce an antigenic reaction if injected into the bloodstream,
a problem frequently encountered with the over-glycosylated proteins synthesized by
S. cerevisiae. Expression vectors for P. pastoris make use of the alcohol oxidase (AOX )
promoter (Figure 13.16b), which is induced by methanol. The only significant problem
with P. pastoris is that it sometimes degrades recombinant proteins before they can be
purified, but this can be controlled by using special growth media. Other yeasts that
have been used for recombinant protein synthesis include Hansenula polymorpha,
Yarrowia lipolytica, and Kluveromyces lactis. The last of these has the attraction that it
can be grown on waste products from the food industry.
The two most popular filamentous fungi are Aspergillus nidulans and Trichoderma
reesei. The advantages of these organisms are their good glycosylation properties and

their ability to secrete proteins into the growth medium. The latter is a particularly
strong feature of the wood rot fungus T. reesei, which in its natural habitat secretes
cellulolytic enzymes that degrade the wood it lives on. The secretion characteristics
mean that these fungi are able to produce recombinant proteins in a form that aids
purification. Expression vectors for A. nidulans usually carry the glucoamylase promoter
(Figure 13.16c), induced by starch and repressed by xylose; those for T. reesei make
use of the cellobiohydrolase promoter (Figure 13.16d), which is induced by cellulose.

13.3.2 Using animal cells for recombinant protein production
The difficulties inherent in synthesis of a fully active animal protein in a microbial host
have prompted biotechnologists to explore the possibility of using animal cells for
recombinant protein synthesis. For proteins with complex and essential glycosylation
structures, an animal cell might be the only type of host within which the active protein
can be synthesized.
Protein production in mammalian cells
Culture systems for animal cells have been around since the early 1960s, but only during the past 20 years have methods for large-scale continuous culture become available.
A problem with some animal cell lines is that they require a solid surface on which to
grow, adding complications to the design of the culture vessels. One solution is to fill
the inside of the vessel with plates, providing a large surface area, but this has the
disadvantage that complete and continuous mixing of the medium within the vessel
becomes very difficult. A second possibility is to use a standard vessel but to provide the
cells with small inert particles (e.g., cellulose beads) on which to grow. Rates of growth
and maximum cell densities are much less for animal cells compared with microorganisms, limiting the yield of recombinant protein, but this can be tolerated if it is the only
way of obtaining the active protein.
Of course, gene cloning may not be necessary in order to obtain an animal protein
from an animal cell culture. Nevertheless, expression vectors and cloned genes are still
used to maximize yields, by placing the gene under control of a promoter that is stronger

than the one to which it is normally attached. This promoter is often obtained from
viruses such as SV40 (p. 123), cytomegalovirus (CMV), or Rous sarcoma virus (RSV).
Mammalian cell lines derived from humans or hamsters have been used in synthesis
of several recombinant proteins, and in most cases these proteins have been processed
correctly and are indistinguishable from the non-recombinant versions. However, this
is the most expensive approach to recombinant protein production, especially as the
possible co-purification of viruses with the protein means that rigorous quality control
procedures must be employed to ensure that the product is safe.
Protein production in insect cells
Insect cells provide an alternative to mammalian cells for animal protein production.
Insect cells do not behave in culture any differently to mammalian cells but they have
the great advantage that, thanks to a natural expression system, they can provide high
yields of recombinant protein.
The expression system is based on the baculoviruses, a group of viruses that are common in insects but do not normally infect vertebrates. The baculovirus genome includes
the polyhedrin gene, whose product accumulates in the insect cell as large nuclear inclusion bodies toward the end of the infection cycle (Figure 13.18). The product of this single
gene frequently makes up over 50% of the total cell protein. Similar levels of protein
production also occur if the normal gene is replaced by a foreign one. Baculovirus
vectors have been successfully used in production of a number of mammalian proteins,
but unfortunately the resulting proteins are not glycosylated correctly. In this regard
the baculovirus system does not offer any advantages compared with S. cerevisiae or
P. pastoris. However, the deficiencies in the insect glycosylation process can be circumvented by using a modified baculovirus that carries a mammalian promoter to express
genes directly in mammalian cells. The infection is not productive, meaning that the
virus genome is unable to replicate, but genes cloned into one of the BacMam vectors,
as they are called, are maintained stably in mammalian cells for enough time for expression to occur. This expression is accompanied by the mammalian cell’s own posttranslational processing activities, so the recombinant protein is correctly glycosylated
and therefore should be fully active.
Of course, in nature baculoviruses infect living insects, not cell cultures. For example,
one of the most popular baculoviruses used in cloning is the Bombyx mori nucleopolyhedrovirus (BmNPV), which is a natural pathogen of the silkworm. There is a huge conventional industry based on the culturing of silkworms for silk production, and this
expertise is now being harnessed for production of recombinant proteins, using expression vectors based on the BmNPV genome. As well as being an easy and cheap means
of obtaining proteins, silkworms have the additional advantage of not being infected by

Chapter 13 Production of Protein from Cloned Genes

241

viruses that are pathogenic to humans. The possibility that dangerous viruses are
co-purified with the recombinant protein is therefore avoided.

13.3.3 Pharming—recombinant protein from live animals
and plants
The use of silkworms for recombinant protein production is an example of the process
often referred to as pharming, where a transgenic organism acts as the host for protein
synthesis. Pharming is a recent and controversial innovation in gene cloning.
Pharming in animals
A transgenic animal is one that contains a cloned gene in all of its cells. Knockout mice
(p. 214), used to study the function of human and other mammalian genes, are examples
of transgenic animals. With mice, a transgenic animal can be produced by microinjection of the gene to be cloned into a fertilized egg cell (p. 85). Although this technique
works well with mice, injection of fertilized cells is inefficient or impossible with
many other mammals, and generation of transgenic animals for recombinant protein
production usually involves a more sophisticated procedure called nuclear transfer
(Figure 13.19). This involves microinjection of the recombinant protein gene into a
somatic cell, which is a more efficient process than injection into a fertilized egg. Because
the somatic cell will not itself differentiate into an animal, its nucleus, after microinjection, must be transferred to an oocyte whose own nucleus has been removed. After
implantation into a foster mother, the engineered cell retains the ability of the original
oocyte to divide and differentiate into an animal, one that will contain the transgene in
every cell. This is a lengthy procedure and transgenic animals are therefore expensive to
produce, but the technology is cost-effective because once a transgenic animal has been
made it can reproduce and pass its cloned gene to its offspring according to standard
Mendelian principles.
Although proteins have been produced in the blood of transgenic animals, and in the
eggs of transgenic chickens, the most successful approach has been to use farm animals
such as sheep or pigs, with the cloned gene attached to the promoter for the animal’s
b-lactoglobulin gene. This promoter is active in the mammary tissue which means that
the recombinant protein is secreted in the milk (Figure 13.20). Milk production can be

continuous during the animal’s adult life, resulting in a high yield of the protein.
For example, the average cow produces some 8000 liters of milk per year, yielding
40–80 kg of protein. Because the protein is secreted, purification is relatively easy. Most
importantly, sheep and pigs are mammals and so human proteins produced in this way
are correctly modified. Production of pharmaceutical proteins in farm animals therefore
offers considerable promise for synthesis of correctly modified human proteins for use
in medicine.
Recombinant proteins from plants
Plants provide the final possibility for production of recombinant protein. Plants and
animals have similar protein processing activities, although there are slight differences
in the glycosylation pathways. Plant cell culture is a well established technology that is
already used in the commercial synthesis of natural plant products. Alternatively, intact
plants can be grown to a high density in fields. The latter approach to recombinant protein production has been used with a variety of crops, such as maize, tobacco, rice, and
sugarcane. One possibility is to place the transgene next to the promoter of a seed
specific gene such as b-phaseolin, which codes for the main seed protein of the bean
Phaseolus vulgaris. The recombinant protein is therefore synthesized specifically in the
seeds, which naturally accumulate large quantities of proteins and are easy to harvest
and to process. Recombinant proteins have also been synthesized in leaves of tobacco
and alfalfa and the tubers of potatoes. In all of these cases, the protein has to be purified
from the complex biochemical mixture that is produced when the seeds, leaves, or
tubers are crushed. One way of avoiding this problem is to express the recombinant
protein as a fusion with a signal peptide that directs secretion of the protein by the
roots. Although this requires the plants to be grown in hydroponic systems rather than
in fields, the decrease in yield is at least partly offset by the low cost of purification.
Whichever production system is used, plants offer a cheap and low-technology means
of mass production of recombinant proteins. A range of proteins have been produced
in experimental systems, including important pharmaceuticals such as interleukins and
antibodies. This is an area of intensive research at the present time, with a number of
plant biotechnology companies developing systems that have reached or are nearing
commercial production. One very promising possibility is that plants could be used to
synthesize vaccines, providing the basis to a cheap and efficient vaccination program
(Chapter 14).

Chapter 13 Production of Protein from Cloned Genes

243

Ethical concerns raised by pharming
With our discussion of pharming we have entered one of the areas of gene cloning that
causes concern among the public. No student of gene cloning and DNA analysis should
ignore the controversies raised by the genetic manipulation of animals and plants but,
equally, no textbook on the subject should attempt to teach the “correct” response to
these ethical concerns. You must make up your own mind on such matters.
With transgenic animals, one of the fears is that the procedures used might cause
suffering. These concerns do not center on the recombinant protein, but on the manipulations that result in production of the transgenic animal. Animals produced by nuclear
transfer suffer a relatively high frequency of birth defects, and some of those that survive
do not synthesize the required protein adequately, meaning that this type of pharming
is accompanied by a high “wastage”. Even the healthy animals appear to suffer from
premature aging, as was illustrated most famously by “Dolly the sheep” who, although
not transgenic, was the first animal to be produced by nuclear transfer. Most sheep of
her breed live for up to 12 years, but Dolly developed arthritis at the age of 5 and was
put down one year later because she was found to be suffering from terminal lung
disease, which is normally found only in old sheep. It has been speculated that this premature aging was related to the age of the somatic cell whose nucleus gave rise to Dolly,
as this cell came from a six-year-old sheep and so Dolly was effectively six when she was
born. Although the technology has moved on dramatically since Dolly was born in 1997,
the welfare issues regarding transgenic animals have not been resolved, and the broader
issues concerning the use of nuclear transfer to “clone” animals (i.e., to produce identical offspring, rather than to clone individual genes) remain at the forefront of public
awareness.
Pharming in plants raises a completely different set of ethical concerns, relating in
part to the impact that genetically manipulated crops might have on the environment.
These concerns apply to all GM crops, not just those used for pharming, and we will
return to them in Chapter 15 after we have examined the more general uses of gene
cloning in agriculture.

14.1 Production of recombinant pharmaceuticals
14.2 Identification of genes responsible for human diseases
14.3 Gene therapy

Medicine has been and will continue to be a major beneficiary of the recombinant DNA
revolution, and an entire book could be written on this topic. Later in this chapter we
will see how recombinant DNA techniques are being used to identify genes responsible
for inherited diseases and to devise new therapies for these disorders. First, we will continue the theme developed in the last chapter and examine the ways in which cloned
genes are being used in the production of recombinant pharmaceuticals.

14.1 Production of recombinant pharmaceuticals
A number of human disorders can be traced to the absence or malfunction of a protein
normally synthesized in the body. Most of these disorders can be treated by supplying
the patient with the correct version of the protein, but for this to be possible the relevant protein must be available in relatively large amounts. If the defect can be corrected
only by administering the human protein, then obtaining sufficient quantities will be a
major problem unless donated blood can be used as the source. Animal proteins are
therefore used whenever these are effective, but there are not many disorders that can
be treated with animal proteins, and there is always the possibility of side effects such
as an allergenic response.
We learned in Chapter 13 that gene cloning can be used to obtain large amounts of
recombinant human proteins. How are these techniques being applied to the production of proteins for use as pharmaceuticals?

14.1.1 Recombinant insulin
Insulin, synthesized by the b-cells of the islets of Langerhans in the pancreas, controls
the level of glucose in the blood. An insulin deficiency manifests itself as diabetes mellitus, a complex of symptoms which may lead to death if untreated. Fortunately, many
forms of diabetes can be alleviated by a continuing program of insulin injections, thereby
supplementing the limited amount of hormone synthesized by the patient’s pancreas.
The insulin used in this treatment was originally obtained from the pancreas of pigs and
cows slaughtered for meat production. Although animal insulin is generally satisfactory,
problems may arise in its use to treat human diabetes. One problem is that the slight
differences between the animal and the human proteins can lead to side effects in some
patients. Another is that the purification procedures are difficult, and potentially
dangerous contaminants cannot always be completely removed.
Insulin displays two features that facilitate its production by recombinant DNA techniques. The first is that the human protein is not modified after translation by the addition of sugar molecules (p. 236): recombinant insulin synthesized by a bacterium should
therefore be active. The second advantage concerns the size of the molecule. Insulin is
a relatively small protein, comprising two polypeptides, one of 21 amino acids (the A
chain) and one of 30 amino acids (the B chain; Figure 14.1). In humans these chains are

synthesized as a precursor called preproinsulin, which contains the A and B segments
linked by a third chain (C) and preceded by a leader sequence. The leader sequence is
removed after translation and the C chain excised, leaving the A and B polypeptides
linked to each other by two disulphide bonds.
Several strategies have been used to obtain recombinant insulin. One of the first
projects, involving synthesis of artificial genes for the A and B chains followed by
production of fusion proteins in E. coli, illustrates a number of the general techniques
used in recombinant protein production.
Synthesis and expression of artificial insulin genes
In the late 1970s, the idea of making an artificial gene was extremely innovative.
Oligonucleotide synthesis was in its infancy at that time, and the available methods for
making artificial DNA molecules were much more cumbersome than the present-day
automated techniques. Nevertheless, genes coding for the A and B chains of insulin
were synthesized as early as 1978.
The procedure used was to synthesize trinucleotides representing all the possible
codons and then join these together in the order dictated by the amino acid sequences
of the A and B chains. The artificial genes would not necessarily have the same nucleotide sequences as the real gene segments coding for the A and B chains, but they would
still specify the correct polypeptides. Two recombinant plasmids were constructed, one
carrying the artificial gene for the A chain, and one the gene for the B chain.
In each case the artificial gene was ligated to a lacZ′ reading frame present in a
pBR322-type vector (Figure 14.2a). The insulin genes were therefore under the control
of the strong lac promoter (p. 231), and were expressed as fusion proteins, consisting
of the first few amino acids of b-galactosidase followed by the A or B polypeptides
(Figure 14.2b). Each gene was designed so that its b-galactosidase and insulin segments
were separated by a methionine residue, so that the insulin polypeptides could be
cleaved from the b-galactosidase segments by treatment with cyanogen bromide
(p. 233). The purified A and B chains were then attached to each other by disulphide
bond formation in the test tube.
The final step, involving disulphide bond formation, is actually rather inefficient. A
subsequent improvement was to synthesize not the individual A and B genes, but the
entire proinsulin reading frame, specifying B chain–C chain–A chain (see Figure 14.1).
Although this is a more daunting proposition in terms of DNA synthesis, the prohormone has the big advantage of folding spontaneously into the correct disulphide-bonded
structure. The C chain segment can then be excised relatively easily by proteolytic cleavage.

14.1.2 Synthesis of human growth hormones in E. coli
At about the same time that recombinant insulin was first being made in E. coli, other
researchers were working on similar projects with the human growth hormones somatostatin and somatotrophin. These two proteins act in conjunction to control growth
processes in the human body, their malfunction leading to painful and disabling disorders
such as acromegaly (uncontrolled bone growth) and dwarfism.
Somatostatin was the first human protein to be synthesized in E. coli. Being a very
short protein, only 14 amino acids in length, it was ideally suited for artificial gene synthesis. The strategy used was the same as described for recombinant insulin, involving
insertion of the artificial gene into a lacZ′ vector (Figure 14.3), synthesis of a fusion
protein, and cleavage with cyanogen bromide.

Somatotrophin presented a more difficult problem. This protein is 191 amino acids
in length, equivalent to almost 600 bp, an impossible prospect for the DNA synthesis
capabilities of the late 1970s. In fact, a combination of artificial gene synthesis and complementary DNA (cDNA) cloning was used to obtain a somatotrophin-producing
E. coli strain. Messenger RNA was obtained from the pituitary, the gland that produces
somatotrophin in the human body, and a cDNA library prepared. The somatotrophin
cDNA contained a single site for the restriction endonuclease HaeIII, which therefore
cuts the cDNA into two segments (Figure 14.4a). The longer segment, consisting of
codons 24–191, was retained for use in construction of the recombinant plasmid. The
smaller segment was replaced by an artificial DNA molecule that reproduced the start
of the somatotrophin gene and provided the correct signals for translation in E. coli
(Figure 14.4b). The modified gene was then ligated into an expression vector carrying
the lac promoter.

14.1.3 Recombinant factor VIII
Although a number of important pharmaceutical compounds have been obtained from
genes cloned in E. coli, the general problems associated with using bacteria to synthesize foreign proteins (p. 234) have led in many cases to these organisms being replaced
by eukaryotes. An example of a recombinant pharmaceutical produced in eukaryotic
cells is human factor VIII, a protein that plays a central role in blood clotting. The commonest form of hemophilia in humans results from an inability to synthesize factor VIII,

leading to a breakdown in the blood clotting pathway and the well-known symptoms
associated with the disease.
Until recently the only way to treat hemophilia was by injection of purified factor VIII
protein, obtained from human blood provided by donors. Purification of factor VIII is
a complex procedure and the treatment is expensive. More critically, the purification is
beset with difficulties, in particular in removing virus particles that may be present in the
blood. Hepatitis and acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) can be and have
been passed on to hemophiliacs via factor VIII injections. Recombinant factor VIII, free
from contamination problems, would be a significant achievement for biotechnology.
The factor VIII gene is very large, over 186 kb in length, and is split into 26 exons
and 25 introns (Figure 14.5a). The mRNA codes for a large polypeptide (2351 amino
acids), which undergoes a complex series of post-translational processing events,
eventually resulting in a dimeric protein consisting of a large subunit, derived from
the upstream region of the initial polypeptide, and a small subunit from the downstream
segment (Figure 14.5b). The two subunits contain a total of 17 disulphide bonds and
a number of glycosylated sites. As might be anticipated for such a large and complex
protein, it has not been possible to synthesize an active version in E. coli.
Initial attempts to obtain recombinant factor VIII therefore involved mammalian
cells. In the first experiments to be carried out the entire cDNA was cloned in hamster
cells, but yields of protein were disappointingly low. This was probably because the
post-translational events, although carried out correctly in hamster cells, did not convert all the initial product into an active form, limiting the overall yield. As an alternative, two separate fragments from the cDNA were used, one fragment coding for the
large subunit polypeptide, the second for the small subunit. Each cDNA fragment was
ligated into an expression vector, downstream of the Ag promoter (a hybrid between the
chicken b-actin and rabbit b-globin sequences) and upstream of a polyadenylation
signal from SV40 virus (Figure 14.6). The plasmid was introduced into a hamster cell
line and recombinant protein obtained. The yields were over ten times greater than
those from cells containing the complete cDNA, and the resulting factor VIII protein
was indistinguishable in terms of function from the native form.
Pharming (p. 241) has also been used for production of recombinant factor VIII. The
complete human cDNA has been attached to the promoter for the whey acidic protein

subsequent secretion of the protein in the milk. The factor VIII produced in this
way appears to be exactly the same as the native protein and is fully functional in blood
clotting assays.

14.1.4 Synthesis of other recombinant human proteins
The list of human proteins synthesized by recombinant technology continues to grow
(Table 14.1). As well as proteins used to treat disorders by replacement or supplementation of the dysfunctional versions, the list includes a number of growth factors (e.g.,
interferons and interleukins) with potential uses in cancer therapy. These proteins are
synthesized in very limited amounts in the body, so recombinant technology is the only
viable means of obtaining them in the quantities needed for clinical purposes. Other
proteins, such as serum albumin, are more easily obtained, but are needed in such large
quantities that production in microorganisms is still a more attractive option.

14.1.5 Recombinant vaccines
The final category of recombinant protein is slightly different from the examples given
in Table 14.1. A vaccine is an antigenic preparation that, after injection into the bloodstream, stimulates the immune system to synthesize antibodies that protect the body
against infection. The antigenic material present in a vaccine is normally an inactivated
form of the infectious agent. For example, antiviral vaccines often consist of virus
particles that have been attenuated by heating or a similar treatment. In the past, two
problems have hindered the preparation of attenuated viral vaccines:
l

l

The inactivation process must be 100% efficient, as the presence in a vaccine of
just one live virus particle could result in infection. This has been a problem with
vaccines for the cattle disease foot-and-mouth.
The large amounts of virus particles needed for vaccine production are usually
obtained from tissue cultures. Unfortunately some viruses, notably hepatitis B
virus, do not grow in tissue culture.

Producing vaccines as recombinant proteins
The use of gene cloning in this field centers on the discovery that virus-specific antibodies are sometimes synthesized in response not only to the whole virus particle, but
also to isolated components of the virus. This is particularly true of purified preparations
of the proteins present in the virus coat (Figure 14.7). If the genes coding for the antigenic proteins of a particular virus could be identified and inserted into an expression
vector, the methods described above for the synthesis of animal proteins could be
employed in the production of recombinant proteins that might be used as vaccines.
These vaccines would have the advantages that they would be free of intact virus particles
and they could be obtained in large quantities.
The greatest success with this approach has been with hepatitis B virus. Hepatitis B
is endemic in many tropical parts of the world and leads to liver disease and possibly,
after chronic infection, to cancer of the liver. A person who recovers from hepatitis B
is immune to future infection because their blood contains antibodies to the hepatitis B

Chapter 14 Gene Cloning and DNA Analysis in Medicine

surface antigen (HBsAg), which is one of the virus coat proteins. This protein has been
synthesized in both Saccharomyces cerevisiae, using a vector based on the 2 fm plasmid
(p. 105), and in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells. In both cases, the protein was
obtained in reasonably high quantities, and when injected into test animals provided
protection against hepatitis B.
The key to the success of recombinant HbsAg as a vaccine is provided by an unusual
feature of the natural infection process for the virus. The bloodstream of infected individuals contains not only intact hepatitis B virus particles, which are 42 nm in diameter,
but also smaller, 22 nm spheres made up entirely of HBsAg protein molecules. Assembly
of these 22 nm spheres occurs during HbsAg synthesis in both yeast and hamster cells
and it is almost certainly these spheres, rather than single HbsAg molecules, that are
the effective component of the recombinant vaccine. The recombinant vaccine therefore
mimics part of the natural infection process and stimulates antibody production, but as
the spheres are not viable viruses the vaccine does not itself cause the disease. Both the
yeast and hamster cell vaccines have been approved for use in humans, and the World
Health Organization is promoting their use in national vaccination programmes.
Recombinant vaccines in transgenic plants
The advent of pharming (p. 241) has led to the possibility of using transgenic plants as
the hosts for synthesis of recombinant vaccines. The ease with which plants can be
grown and harvested means that this technology might be applicable for developing
parts of the world where the more expensive approaches to recombinant protein
production might be difficult to sustain. If the recombinant vaccine is effective after
oral administration, then immunity could be acquired simply by eating part or all of
the transgenic plant. A simpler and cheaper means of carrying out a mass vaccination
program would be hard to imagine.
The feasibility of this approach has been demonstrated by trials with vaccines such
as HbsAg and the coat proteins of measles virus and respiratory syncytial virus. In each
case, immunity was conferred by feeding the transgenic plant to test animals. Attempts
are also being made to engineer plants that express a variety of vaccines, so that immunity against a range of diseases can be acquired from a single source. The main problem
currently faced by the companies developing this technology is that the amount of
recombinant protein synthesized by the plant is often insufficient to stimulate complete
immunity against the target disease. To be completely effective the yield of the vaccine
needs to make up 8–10% of the soluble protein content of the part of the plant which
is eaten, but in practice yields are much less than this, usually not more than 0.5%.
Variability in the yields between different plants in a single crop is also a concern. A partial solution is provided by placing the cloned gene in the chloroplast genome rather
than the plant nucleus (p. 119), as this generally results in much higher yields of recombinant protein. However, proteins made in the chloroplast are not glycosylated and so
those vaccines that require post-translational modification will be inactive if produced
in this way. These include most of the relevant viral coat proteins, but not bacterial surface proteins such as the Vibrio cholerae B subunit, which can be used to confer immunity
against diseases such as cholera. This protein has been synthesized in transgenic tobacco,
tomato, and rice plants and shown to elicit an anti-cholera immune response when
leaves, fruits, or seeds are fed to mice.
Live recombinant virus vaccines
The use of live vaccinia virus as a vaccine for smallpox dates back to 1796, when Edward
Jenner first realized that this virus, harmless to humans, could stimulate immunity

against the much more dangerous smallpox virus. The term “vaccine” comes from
vaccinia; its use resulted in the worldwide eradication of smallpox in 1980.
A more recent idea is that recombinant vaccinia viruses could be used as live
vaccines against other diseases. If a gene coding for a virus coat protein, for example
HBsAg, is ligated into the vaccinia genome under control of a vaccinia promoter, then
the gene will be expressed (Figure 14.8). After injection into the bloodstream, replication of the recombinant virus results not only in new vaccinia particles, but also in
significant quantities of the major surface antigen. Immunity against both smallpox and
hepatitis B would result.
This remarkable technique has considerable potential. Recombinant vaccinia viruses
expressing a number of foreign genes have been constructed and shown to confer immunity against the relevant diseases in experimental animals (Table 14.2). The possibility
of broad-spectrum vaccines is raised by the demonstration that a single recombinant
vaccinia, expressing the genes for influenza virus hemagglutinin, HBsAg, and herpes
simplex virus glycoprotein, confers immunity against each disease in monkeys. Studies
of vaccinia viruses expressing the rabies glycoprotein have shown that deletion of the
vaccinia gene for the enzyme thymidine kinase prevents the virus from replicating. This
avoids the possibility that animals treated with the live vaccine will develop any form
of cowpox, the disease caused by normal vaccinia. This particular live virus vaccine is
now being used in rabies control in Europe and North America.

14.2 Identification of genes responsible for
human diseases
A second major area of medical research in which gene cloning is having an impact is
in the identification and isolation of genes responsible for human diseases. A genetic or
inherited disease is one that is caused by a defect in a specific gene (Table 14.3), individuals carrying the defective gene being predisposed toward developing the disease at
some stage of their lives. With some inherited diseases, such as hemophilia, the gene is
present on the X chromosome, so all males carrying the gene express the disease state;
females with one defective gene and one correct gene are healthy but can pass the
disease on to their male offspring. Genes for other diseases are present on autosomes
and in most cases are recessive, so both chromosomes of the pair must carry a defective
version for the disease to occur. A few diseases, including Huntington’s chorea,
are autosomal dominant, so a single copy of the defective gene is enough to lead to the
disease state.
With some genetic diseases, the symptoms manifest themselves early in life, but with
others the disease may not be expressed until the individual is middle-aged or elderly.

Cystic fibrosis is an example of the former, and neurodegenerative diseases such as
Alzheimer’s and Huntington’s are examples of the latter. With a number of diseases
that appear to have a genetic component, cancers in particular, the overall syndrome is
complex with the disease remaining dormant until triggered by some metabolic or environmental stimulus. If predisposition to these diseases can be diagnosed, the risk factor
can be reduced by careful management of the patient’s lifestyle to minimize the chances
of the disease being triggered.
Genetic diseases have always been present in the human population but their importance has increased in recent decades. This is because vaccination programs, antibiotics,
and improved sanitation have reduced the prevalence of infectious diseases such as
smallpox, tuberculosis, and cholera, which were major killers up to the mid-20th
century. The result is that a greater proportion of the population now dies from a disease that has a genetic component, especially the late-onset diseases that are now more
common because of increased life expectancies. Medical research has been successful in
controlling many infectious diseases: can it be equally successful with genetic disease?
There are a number of reasons why identifying the gene responsible for a genetic
disease is important:
l

l

l

Gene identification may provide an indication of the biochemical basis to the
disease, enabling therapies to be designed.
Identification of the mutation present in a defective gene can be used to devise
a screening programme so that the mutant gene can be identified in individuals
who are carriers or who have not yet developed the disease. Carriers can receive
counseling regarding the chances of their children inheriting the disease. Early
identification in individuals who have not yet developed the disease allows
appropriate precautions to be taken to reduce the risk of the disease becoming
expressed.
Identification of the gene is a prerequisite for gene therapy (p. 259).

14.2.1 How to identify a gene for a genetic disease
There is no single strategy for identification of genes that cause diseases, the best
approach depending on the information that is available about the disease. To gain an
understanding of the principles of this type of work, we will consider the most common
and most difficult scenario. This is when all that is known about the disease is that
certain people have it. Even with such an unpromising starting point, DNA techniques
can locate the relevant gene.
Locating the approximate position of the gene in the human genome
If there is no information about the desired gene, how can it be located in the human
genome? The answer is to use basic genetics to determine the approximate position of
the gene on the human genetic map. Genetic mapping is usually carried out by linkage
analysis, in which the inheritance pattern for the target gene is compared with the inheritance patterns for genetic loci whose map positions are already known. If two loci
are inherited together, they must be very close on the same chromosome. If they are
not close together, then recombination events and the random segregation of chromosomes during meiosis will result in the loci displaying different inheritance patterns
(Figure 14.9). Demonstration of linkage with one or more mapped genetic loci is therefore the key to understanding the chromosomal position of an unmapped gene.

With humans it is not possible to carry out directed breeding programs aimed at
determining the map position of a desired gene. Instead, mapping of disease genes must
make use of data available from pedigree analysis, in which inheritance of the gene is
examined in families with a high incidence of the disease being studied. It is important
to be able to obtain DNA samples from at least three generations of each family, and the
more family members there are the better, but unless the disease is very uncommon it
is usually possible to find suitable pedigrees. Linkage between the presence/absence of
the disease and the inheritance of other genes could be studied, but as DNA samples are
being analyzed, linkage to DNA markers is more usually tested (p. 180).
To illustrate how linkage analysis is used we will look briefly at the way in which
one of the genes conferring susceptibility to human breast cancer was mapped. The first
breakthrough in this project occurred in 1990 as a result of restriction fragment length
polymorphism (RFLP) linkage analyses carried out by a group at the University of
California at Berkeley. This study showed that in families with a high incidence of breast
cancer, a significant number of the women who suffered from the disease all possessed
the same version of an RFLP called D17S74. This RFLP had previously been mapped
to the long arm of chromosome 17 (Figure 14.10): the gene being sought—BRCA1—
must therefore also be located on the long arm of chromosome 17.
This initial linkage result was extremely important, as it indicated in which region of
the human genome this breast cancer susceptibility gene was to be found, but it was far
from the end of the story. In fact, over 1000 genes are thought to lie in this particular
20 Mb stretch of chromosome 17. The next objective was therefore to carry out more
linkage studies to try to pinpoint BRCA1 more accurately. This was achieved by first
examining the region containing BRCA1 for short tandem repeats (STRs) (p. 181),
which are useful for fine scale mapping because many of them exist in three or more
allelic forms, rather than just the two alleles that are possible for an RFLP. Several
alleles of an STR might therefore be present within a single pedigree, enabling more
detailed mapping to be carried out. STR linkage mapping reduced the size of the BRCA1
region from 20 Mb down to just 600 kb (Figure 14.10). This approach to locating a
gene is called positional cloning.

Mapping the breast cancer gene. Initially the gene was mapped
to a 20 Mb segment of chromosome 17 (highlighted region in

down to a 600 kb region flanked by two previously mapped loci,
D17S1321 and D17S1325 (middle drawing). After examination
of expressed sequences, a strong candidate for BRCA1 was
eventually identified (right drawing).

Identification of candidates for the disease gene
One might imagine that once the map location of the disease gene has been determined
the next step is simply to refer to the genome sequence in order to identify the gene.
Unfortunately a great deal of work still has to be done. Genetic mapping, even in its
most precise form, only gives an approximate indication of the location of a gene. In the
breast cancer project the researchers were fortunate in being able to narrow the search
area down to just 600 kb—often 10 Mb or more of DNA sequence has to be examined.
Such large stretches of DNA could contain many genes: the 600 kb breast cancer region
contained over 60 genes, any one of which could have been BRCA1.
A variety of approaches can be used to identify which of the genes in a mapped region
is the disease gene:
l

l

l

l

The expression profiles of the candidate genes can be examined by hybridization
analysis or reverse transcription–polymerase chain reaction (RT–PCR) (p. 161) of
RNA from different tissues. For example, BRCA1 would be expected to hybridize
to RNA prepared from breast tissue, and also to ovary tissue RNA, ovarian cancer
frequently being associated with inherited breast cancer.
Southern hybridization analysis (p. 142) can be carried out with DNA from
different species (these are called zoo blots). The rationale is that an important
human gene will almost certainly have homologs in other mammals, and that this
homolog, although having a slightly different sequence from the human version,
will be detectable by hybridization with a suitable probe.
The gene sequences could be examined in individuals with and without the disease
to see if the genes from affected individuals contain mutations that might explain
why they have the disease.
To confirm the identity of a candidate gene, it might be possible to prepare a
knockout mouse (p. 214) that has an inactive version of the equivalent mouse
gene. If the knockout mouse displays symptoms compatible with the human
disease, then the candidate gene is almost certainly the correct one.

Chapter 14 Gene Cloning and DNA Analysis in Medicine

When applied to the breast cancer region, these analyses resulted in identification of
an approximately 100 kb gene, made up of 22 exons and coding for a 1863 amino acid
protein, that was a strong candidate for BRCA1. Transcripts of the gene were detectable
in breast and ovary tissues, and homologs were present in mice, rats, rabbits, sheep,
and pigs, but not chickens. Most importantly, the genes from five susceptible families
contained mutations (such as frameshift and nonsense mutations) likely to lead to a nonfunctioning protein. Although circumstantial, the evidence in support of the candidate
was sufficiently overwhelming for this gene to be identified as BRCA1. Subsequent
research has shown that both this gene and BRCA2, a second gene associated with
susceptibility to breast cancer, are involved in transcription regulation and DNA repair,
and that both act as tumor suppressor genes, inhibiting abnormal cell division.

14.3 Gene therapy
The final application of recombinant DNA technology in medicine that we will consider is gene therapy. This is the name originally given to methods that aim to cure an
inherited disease by providing the patient with a correct copy of the defective gene.
Gene therapy has now been extended to include attempts to cure any disease by introduction of a cloned gene into the patient. First we will examine the techniques used in
gene therapy, and then we will attempt to address the ethical issues.

14.3.1 Gene therapy for inherited diseases
There are two basic approaches to gene therapy: germline therapy and somatic cell
therapy. In germline therapy, a fertilized egg is provided with a copy of the correct
version of the relevant gene and re-implanted into the mother. If successful, the gene is
present and expressed in all cells of the resulting individual. Germline therapy is usually carried out by microinjection of a somatic cell followed by nuclear transfer into an
oocyte (p. 241), and theoretically could be used to treat any inherited disease.
Somatic cell therapy involves manipulation of cells, which either can be removed
from the organism, transfected, and then placed back in the body, or transfected in situ
without removal. The technique has most promise for inherited blood diseases (e.g.,
hemophilia and thalassaemia), with genes being introduced into stem cells from the
bone marrow, which give rise to all the specialized cell types in the blood. The strategy
is to prepare a bone extract containing several billion cells, transfect these with a
retrovirus-based vector, and then re-implant the cells. Subsequent replication and differentiation of transfectants leads to the added gene being present in all the mature
blood cells (Figure 14.11). The advantage of a retrovirus is that this type of vector has
an extremely high transfection frequency, enabling a large proportion of the stem cells
in a bone marrow extract to receive the new gene.
Somatic cell therapy also has potential in the treatment of lung diseases such as cystic
fibrosis, as DNA cloned in adenovirus vectors (p. 123) or contained in liposomes (p. 85)
is taken up by the epithelial cells in the lungs after introduction into the respiratory
tract via an inhaler. However, gene expression occurs for only a few weeks, and as yet
this has not been developed into an effective means of treating cystic fibrosis.
With those genetic diseases where the defect arises because the mutated gene does not
code for a functional protein, all that is necessary is to provide the cell with the
correct version of the gene: removal of the defective genes is unnecessary. The situation

is less easy with dominant genetic diseases (p. 255), as with these it is the defective gene
product itself that is responsible for the disease state, and so the therapy must include
not only addition of the correct gene but also removal of the defective version. This
requires a gene delivery system that promotes recombination between the chromosomal
and vector-borne versions of the gene, so that the defective chromosomal copy is
replaced by the gene from the vector. The technique is complex and unreliable, and
broadly applicable procedures have not yet been developed.

14.3.2 Gene therapy and cancer
The clinical uses of gene therapy are not limited to treatment of inherited diseases.
There have also been attempts to use gene cloning to disrupt the infection cycles of
human pathogens such as the AIDS virus. However, the most intensive area of current
research concerns the potential use of gene therapy as a treatment for cancer.
Most cancers result from activation of an oncogene that leads to tumor formation,
or inactivation of a gene that normally suppresses formation of a tumor. In both cases a
gene therapy could be envisaged to treat the cancer. Inactivation of a tumor suppressor
gene could be reversed by introduction of the correct version of the gene by one of the
methods described above for inherited disease. Inactivation of an oncogene would, however, require a more subtle approach, as the objective would be to prevent expression
of the oncogene, not to replace it with a non-defective copy. One possible way of doing
this would be to introduce into a tumor a gene specifying an antisense version of the

mRNA transcribed from the oncogene (Figure 14.12a). An antisense RNA is the reverse
complement of a normal RNA, and can prevent synthesis of the protein coded by
the gene it is directed against, probably by hybridizing to the mRNA producing a
double-stranded RNA molecule that is rapidly degraded by cellular ribonucleases
(Figure 14.12b). The target is therefore inactivated.
An alternative would be to introduce a gene that selectively kills cancer cells or promotes their destruction by drugs administered in a conventional fashion. This is called
suicide gene therapy and is looked on as an effective general approach to cancer treatment, because it does not require a detailed understanding of the genetic basis of the
particular disease being treated. Many genes that code for toxic proteins are known,
and there are also examples of enzymes that convert non-toxic precursors of drugs into
the toxic form. Introduction of the gene for one of these toxic proteins or enzymes into
a tumor should result in the death of the cancer cells, either immediately or after drug
administration. It is obviously important that the introduced gene is targeted accurately
at the cancer cells, so that healthy cells are not killed. This requires a very precise delivery
system, such as direct inoculation into the tumor, or some other means of ensuring that
the gene is expressed only in the cancer cells. One possibility is to place the gene under
control of the human telomerase promoter, which is active only in cancerous tissues.

262

Part III The Applications of Gene Cloning and DNA Analysis in Biotechnology

Another approach is to use gene therapy to improve the natural killing of cancer cells
by the patient’s immune system, perhaps with a gene that causes the tumor cells to synthesize strong antigens that are efficiently recognized by the immune system. All of these
approaches, and many not based on gene therapy, are currently being tested in the fight
against cancer.

14.3.3 The ethical issues raised by gene therapy
Should gene therapy be used to cure human disease? As with many ethical questions, there
is no simple answer. On the one hand, there could surely be no justifiable objection to the
routine application via a respiratory inhaler of correct versions of the cystic fibrosis gene
as a means of managing this disease. Similarly, if bone marrow transplants are acceptable,
then it is difficult to argue against gene therapies aimed at correction of blood disorders
via stem cell transfection. And cancer is such a terrible disease that the withholding of
effective treatment regimens on moral grounds could itself be criticized as immoral.
Germline therapy is a more difficult issue. The problem is that the techniques used
for germline correction of inherited diseases are exactly the same techniques that could
be used for germline manipulation of other inherited characteristics. Indeed, the
development of this technique with animals has not been prompted by any desire to
cure genetic diseases, the aims being to “improve” farm animals, for example by making
genetic changes that result in lower fat content. This type of manipulation, where the
genetic constitution of an organism is changed in a directed, heritable fashion, is clearly
unacceptable with humans. At present, technical problems mean that human germline
manipulation would be difficult. Before these problems are solved we should ensure
that the desire to do good should not raise the possibility of doing tremendous harm.

15.3 Problems with genetically modified plants

Agriculture, or more specifically the cultivation of plants, is the world’s oldest biotechnology, with an unbroken history that stretches back at least 10,000 years. Throughout
this period humans have constantly searched for improved varieties of their crop plants:
varieties with better nutritional qualities, higher yields, or features that aid cultivation
and harvesting. During the first few millennia, crop improvements occurred in a
sporadic fashion, but in recent centuries new varieties have been obtained by breeding
programs of ever increasing sophistication. However, the most sophisticated breeding
program still retains an element of chance, dependent as it is on the random merging
of parental characteristics in the hybrid offspring that are produced. The development
of a new variety of crop plant, displaying a precise combination of desired characteristics, is a lengthy and difficult process.
Gene cloning provides a new dimension to crop breeding by enabling directed
changes to be made to the genotype of a plant, circumventing the random processes
inherent in conventional breeding. Two general strategies have been used:
l

l

Gene addition, in which cloning is used to alter the characteristics of a plant by
providing it with one or more new genes;
Gene subtraction, in which genetic engineering techniques are used to inactivate
one or more of the plant’s existing genes.

A number of projects are being carried out around the world, many by biotechnology companies, aimed at exploiting the potential of gene addition and gene subtraction
in crop improvement. In this chapter we will investigate a representative selection of

these projects, and look at some of the problems that must be solved if plant genetic
engineering is to gain widespread acceptance in agriculture.

15.1 The gene addition approach to plant genetic
engineering
Gene addition involves the use of cloning techniques to introduce into a plant one or
more new genes coding for a useful characteristic that the plant lacks. A good example
of the technique is provided by the development of plants that resist insect attack by
synthesizing insecticides coded by cloned genes.

15.1.1 Plants that make their own insecticides
Plants are subject to predation by virtually all other types of organism—viruses, bacteria,
fungi, and animals—but in agricultural settings the greatest problems are caused by
insects. To reduce losses, crops are regularly sprayed with insecticides. Most conventional insecticides (e.g., pyrethroids and organophosphates) are relatively non-specific
poisons that kill a broad spectrum of insects, not just the ones eating the crop. Because
of their high toxicity, several of these insecticides also have potentially harmful side
effects for other members of the local biosphere, including in some cases humans. These
problems are exacerbated by the need to apply conventional insecticides to the surfaces
of plants by spraying, which means that subsequent movement of the chemicals in the
ecosystem cannot be controlled. Furthermore, insects that live within the plant, or on
the undersurfaces of leaves, can sometimes avoid the toxic effects altogether.
What features would be displayed by the ideal insecticide? Clearly it must be toxic
to the insects against which it is targeted, but if possible this toxicity should be highly
selective, so that the insecticide is harmless to other insects and is not poisonous to
animals and to humans. The insecticide should be biodegradable, so that any residues
that remain after the crop is harvested, or which are carried out of the field by rainwater, do not persist long enough to damage the environment. And it should be possible
to apply the insecticide in such a way that all parts of the crop, not just the upper
surfaces of the plants, are protected against insect attack.
The ideal insecticide has not yet been discovered. The closest we have are the
c-endotoxins produced by the soil bacterium Bacillus thuringiensis.
The 4-endotoxins of Bacillus thuringiensis
Insects not only eat plants: bacteria also form an occasional part of their diet. In
response, several types of bacteria have evolved defense mechanisms against insect
predation, an example being B. thuringiensis which, during sporulation, forms intracellular crystalline bodies that contain an insecticidal protein called the c-endotoxin.
The activated protein is highly poisonous to insects, some 80,000 times more toxic
than organophosphate insecticides, and is relatively selective, different strains of the
bacterium synthesizing proteins effective against the larvae of different groups of
insects (Table 15.1).
The c-endotoxin protein that accumulates in the bacterium is an inactive precursor.
After ingestion by the insect, this protoxin is cleaved by proteases, resulting in shorter
versions of the protein that display the toxic activity, by binding to the inside of the

insect’s gut and damaging the surface epithelium, so that the insect is unable to feed
and consequently starves to death (Figure 15.1). Variation in the structure of these binding sites in different groups of insects is probably the underlying cause of the high
specificities displayed by the different types of c-endotoxin.
B. thuringiensis toxins are not recent discoveries, the first patent for their use in crop
protection having been granted in 1904. Over the years there have been several attempts
to market them as environmentally friendly insecticides, but their biodegradability acts
as a disadvantage because it means that they must be reapplied at regular intervals during the growing season, increasing the farmer’s costs. Research has therefore been aimed
at developing c-endotoxins that do not require regular application. One approach is
via protein engineering (p. 206), modifying the structure of the toxin so that it is more
stable. A second approach is to engineer the crop to synthesize its own toxin.
Cloning a 4-endotoxin gene in maize
Maize is an example of a crop plant that is not served well by conventional insecticides.
A major pest is the European corn borer (Ostrinia nubilialis), which tunnels into the
plant from eggs laid on the undersurfaces of leaves, thereby evading the effects of insecticides applied by spraying. The first attempt at countering this pest by engineering

maize plants to synthesize c-endotoxin was made by plant biotechnologists in 1993,
working with the CryIA(b) version of the toxin. The CryIA(b) protein is 1155 amino
acids in length, with the toxic activity residing in the segment from amino acids 29–607.
Rather than isolating the natural gene, a shortened version containing the first 648
codons was made by artificial gene synthesis. This strategy enabled modifications to be
introduced into the gene to improve its expression in maize plants. For example, the
codons that were used in the artificial gene were those known to be preferred by maize,
and the overall GC content of the gene was set at 65%, compared with the 38% GC
content of the native bacterial version of the gene (Figure 15.2a). The artificial gene
was ligated into a cassette vector (p. 232) between a promoter and polyadenylation
signal from cauliflower mosaic virus (Figure 15.2b), and introduced into maize embryos
by bombardment with DNA-coated microprojectiles (p. 85). The embryos were grown
into mature plants, and transformants identified by PCR analysis of DNA extracts, using
primers specific for a segment of the artificial gene (Figure 15.2c).
The next step was to use an immunological test to determine if c-endotoxin was
being synthesized by the transformed plants. The results showed that the artificial
gene was indeed active, but that the amounts of c-endotoxin being produced varied
from plant to plant, from about 250–1750 ng of toxin per mg of total protein. These

differences were probably due to positional effects, the level of expression of a gene
cloned in a plant (or animal) often being influenced by the exact location of the gene in
the host chromosomes (Figure 15.3).
Were the transformed plants able to resist the attentions of the corn borers? This
was assessed by field trials in which transformed and normal maize plants were
artificially infested with larvae and the effects of predation measured over a period of
6 weeks. The criteria that were used were the amount of damage suffered by the foliage
of the infested plants, and the lengths of the tunnels produced by the larvae boring into
the plants. In both respects the transformed plants gave better results than the normal
ones. In particular, the average length of the larval tunnels was reduced from 40.7 cm
for the controls to just 6.3 cm for the engineered plants. In real terms, this is a very
significant level of resistance.
Cloning 4-endotoxin genes in chloroplasts
One objection that has been raised to the use of GM crops is the possibility that the
cloned gene might escape from the engineered plant and become established in a weed
species. From a biological viewpoint, this is an unlikely scenario as the pollen produced
by a plant is usually only able to fertilize the ovary of a plant of the same species, so
transfer of a gene from a crop to a weed is highly unlikely. However, one way of making such transfer totally impossible would be to place the cloned gene not in the nucleus
but in the plant’s chloroplasts. A transgene located in the chloroplast genome cannot
escape via pollen for the simple reason that pollen does not contain chloroplasts.
Synthesis of c-endotoxin protein in transgenic chloroplasts has been achieved in an
experimental system with tobacco. The CryIIA(a2) gene was used, which codes for a
protein that has a broader toxicity spectrum than the CryIA toxins, killing the larvae
of two-winged flies as well as lepidopterans (see Table 15.1). In the B. thuringiensis
genome, the CryIIA(a2) gene is the third gene in a short operon, the first two genes of
which code for proteins that help to fold and process the c-endotoxin (Figure 15.4). One
advantage of using chloroplasts as the sites of recombinant protein synthesis is that the
gene expression machinery of chloroplasts, being related to that of bacteria (because
chloroplasts were once free-living prokaryotes), is able to express all the genes in an
operon. In contrast, each gene that is placed in a plant (or animal) nuclear genome must
be cloned individually, with its own promoter and other expression signals, which makes
it very difficult to introduce two or more genes at the same time.
Biolistics (p. 85) was used to introduce the CryIIA(a2) operon into tobacco leaf cells.
Insertion into the chloroplast genome was ensured by attaching chloroplast DNA

Chapter 15 Gene Cloning and DNA Analysis in Agriculture

sequences to the operon (p. 119), and by rigorously selecting for the kanamycin resistance marker by placing leaf segments on agar containing kanamycin for up to 13 weeks.
Transgenic shoots growing out of the leaf segments were then placed on a medium that
induced root formation, and plants grown.
The amounts of CryIIA(a2) protein produced in the tissues of these GM plants was
quite remarkable, the toxin making up over 45% of the total soluble protein, more than
previously achieved in any plant cloning experiment. This high level of expression
almost certainly results from the combined effects of the high copy number for the
transgene (there being many chloroplast genomes per cell, compared with just two
copies of the nuclear genome) and the presence in the chloroplasts of the two helper
proteins coded by the other genes in the CryIIA(a2) operon. As might be anticipated,
the plants proved to be extremely toxic to susceptible insect larvae. Five days after being
placed on the GM plants, all cotton bollworm and beet armyworm larvae were dead,
with appreciable damage being visible only on the leaves of the plants exposed to armyworms, which have a relatively high natural resistance to c-endotoxins. The presence of
large amounts of toxin in the leaf tissues appeared not to affect the plants themselves,
the GM tobacco being undistinguishable from non-GM plants when factors such
as growth rates, chlorophyll content, and level of photosynthesis were considered.
Attempts to repeat this experiment with maize, cotton, and other more useful crops
have been hampered by the difficulties in achieving chloroplast transformation with
plants other than tobacco (see p. 119).
Countering insect resistance to 4-endotoxin crops
It has long been recognized that crops synthesizing c-endotoxins might become ineffective after a few seasons due to the build-up of resistance among the insect populations
feeding on the crops. This would be a natural consequence of exposing these populations to high amounts of toxins and, of course, could render the GM plants no better
than the non-GM versions after a just a few years. Various strategies have been proposed to prevent the development of c-endotoxin resistant insects. One of the first to be
suggested was to develop crops expressing both the CryI and CryII genes, the rationale
being that as these toxins are quite different it would be difficult for an insect population to develop resistance to both types (Figure 15.5a). Whether or not this is a sound
argument is not yet clear. Most examples of c-endotoxin resistance that have been documented have not been broad spectrum: for example, the CryIIA(a2) tobacco plants
described above were equally poisonous to cotton budworms that were or were not
resistant to CryIA(b). However, some strains of meal moth larvae exposed to plants
containing the CryIA(c) toxin have acquired a resistance that also provides protection
against the CryII toxins. In any case, it would be risky to base a counter-resistance strategy on assumed limitations to the genetic potential of the insect pests.
An alternative might be to engineer toxin production in such a way that synthesis
occurs only in those parts of the plant that need protection. For example, in a crop such
as maize, some damage to the non-fruiting parts of the plant could be tolerated if this
did not affect the production of cobs (Figure 15.5b). If expression of the toxin only
occurred late in the plant life cycle, when the cobs are developing, then overall exposure of the insects to the toxin might be reduced without any decrease in the value of
the crop. However, this strategy might delay the onset of resistance, but it is unlikely to
avoid it altogether.
A third strategy is to mix GM plants with non-GM ones, so that each field contains
plants that the insects can feed on without being exposed to the toxin produced by the

engineered versions (Figure 15.5c). These non-GM plants would act as a refuge for the
insects, ensuring that the insect population continually includes a high proportion of
non-resistant individuals. As all the c-endotoxin resistance phenotypes so far encountered are recessive, heterozygotes arising from a mating between a susceptible insect
and a resistant partner would themselves be susceptible, continually diluting the
proportion of resistant insects in the population. Trials have been carried out, and
theoretical models have been examined, to identify the most effective mixed planting
strategies. In practice, success or failure would depend to a very large extent on the
farmers who grow the crops, these farmers having to adhere to the precise planting
strategy dictated by the scientists, despite the resulting loss in productivity due to the
damage suffered by the non-GM plants. Again, this introduces an element of risk. The
success of GM projects with plants clearly depends on much more that the cleverness
of the genetic engineers.

15.1.2 Herbicide resistant crops
Although c-endotoxin production has been engineered in crops as diverse as maize,
cotton, rice, potato, and tomato, these plants are not the most widespread GM crops

grown today. In commercial terms the most important transgenic plants are those
that have been engineered to withstand the herbicide glyphosate. This herbicide,
which is widely used by farmers and horticulturists, is environmentally friendly, as it is
non-toxic to insects and to animals and has a short residence time in soils, breaking
down over a period of a few days into harmless products. However, glyphosate kills
all plants, both weeds and crop species, and so has to be applied to fields very carefully
in order to prevent the growth of weeds without harming the crop itself. GM crops
that are able to withstand the effects of glyphosate are therefore desirable as they would
enable a less rigorous and hence less expensive herbicide application regime to be
followed.
“Roundup Ready” crops
The first crops to be engineered for glyphosate resistance were produced by Monsanto
Co. and called “Roundup Ready”, reflecting the trade name of the herbicide. These
plants contain modified genes for the enzyme enolpyruvylshikimate-3-phosphate
synthase (EPSPS), which converts shikimate and phosphoenol pyruvate (PEP) into
enolpyruvylshikimate-3-phosphate, an essential precursor for synthesis of the aromatic
amino acids tryptophan, tyrosine, and phenylalanine (Figure 15.6). Glyphosate competes with PEP for binding to the enzyme surface, thereby inhibiting synthesis of
enolpyruvylshikimate-3-phosphate and preventing the plant from making the three
amino acids. Without these amino acids, the plant quickly dies.
Initially, genetic engineering was used to generate plants that made greater than
normal amounts of EPSPS, in the expectation that these would be able to withstand
higher doses of glyphosate than non-engineered plants. However, this approach was
unsuccessful because, although engineered plants that made up to 80 times the normal
amount of EPSPS were obtained, the resulting increase in glyphosate tolerance was not
sufficient to protect these plants from herbicide application in the field.
A search was therefore carried out for an organism whose EPSPS enzyme is resistant
to glyphosate inhibition and whose EPSPS gene might therefore be used to confer
resistance on a crop plant. After testing the genes from various bacteria, as well as
mutant forms of Petunia that displayed glyphosate resistance, the EPSPS gene from
Agrobacterium strain CP4 was chosen, because of its combination of high catalytic activity and high resistance to the herbicide. EPSPS is located in the plant chloroplasts, so the
Agrobacterium EPSPS gene was cloned in a Ti vector as a fusion protein with a leader
sequence that would direct the enzyme across the chloroplast membrane and into the
organelle. Biolistics was used to introduce the recombinant vector into soybean callus
culture. After regeneration, the GM plants were found to have a threefold increase in
herbicide resistance.

A new generation of glyphosate resistant crops
Roundup Ready versions of a variety of crops have been produced in recent years, and
several of these, in particular soybean and maize, are grown routinely in the USA and
other parts of the world. However, these plants do not actually destroy glyphosate,
which means that the herbicide can accumulate in the plant tissues. Glyphosate is not
poisonous to humans or other animals, so the use of such plants as food or forage should
not be a concern, but accumulation of the herbicide can interfere with reproduction of
the plant. The degree of resistance displayed by Roundup Ready crops has also been
found to be too low to provide a major economic benefit with some crops, notably
wheat.
Until recently, there had been only a few scattered reports of organisms capable of
actively degrading glyphosate. However, searches of microbial collections have revealed
that this property is relatively common among bacteria of the genus Bacillus, which
possess an enzyme, now called glyphosate N-acetyltransferase (GAT), which detoxifies
glyphosate by attaching an acetyl group to the herbicide molecule (Figure 15.7a). The
most active detoxifier known is a strain of B. licheniformis, but even this bacterium
detoxifies glyphosate at rates that are too low to be of value if transferred to a GM crop.
Is it possible to increase the activity of the GAT synthesized by B. licheniformis? The
discovery that the bacterium possesses three related genes for this enzyme pointed a
way forward. A type of directed evolution called multigene shuffling was used.
Multigene shuffling involves taking parts of each member of a multigene family and
reassembling these parts to create new gene variants. At each stage of the process, the
most active genes are identified by cloning all variants in E. coli and assaying the recombinant colonies for GAT activity. The most active genes are then used as the substrates
for the next round of shuffling. After 11 rounds, a gene specifying a GAT with 10,000
times the activity of the enzymes present in the original B. licheniformis strain was
obtained (Figure 15.7b). This gene was introduced into maize, and the resulting GM
plants were found to tolerate levels of glyphosate six times higher than the amount
normally used by farmers to control weeds, without any reduction in the productivity of
the plant. This new way of engineering glyphosate resistance is currently being examined
in greater detail to determine if it presents a real alternative to Roundup Ready crops.

15.1.3 Other gene addition projects
GM crops that synthesize c-endotoxins or glyphosate resistance enzymes are by no
means the only examples of plants engineered by gene addition. Examples of other gene
addition projects are listed in Table 15.2. These projects include an alternative means
of conferring insect resistance, using genes coding for proteinase inhibitors, small
polypeptides that disrupt the activities of enzymes in the insect gut, preventing or slowing growth. Proteinase inhibitors are produced naturally by several types of plant,
notably legumes such as cowpeas and common beans, and their genes have been successfully transferred to other crops which do not normally make significant amounts of
these proteins. The inhibitors are particularly effective against beetle larvae that feed on
seeds, and so may be a better alternative than c-endotoxin for plants whose seeds are
stored for long periods. Other projects are exploring the use of genetic modification to
improve the nutritional quality of crop plants, for example by increasing the content
of essential amino acids or by changing the plant biochemistry so that more of the
available nutrients can be utilized during digestion by humans or animals. Finally, in a
different sphere of commercial activity, ornamental plants with unusual flower colors

274

Part III The Applications of Gene Cloning and DNA Analysis in Biotechnology

are being produced by transferring genes for enzymes involved in pigment production
from one species to another.

15.2 Gene subtraction
The second way of changing the genotype of a plant is by gene subtraction. This term
is a misnomer, as the modification does not involve the actual removal of a gene, merely
its inactivation. There are several possible strategies for inactivating a single, chosen
gene in a living plant, the most successful so far in practical terms being the use of antisense RNA (p. 260).

15.2.1 Antisense RNA and the engineering of fruit ripening in
tomato
To illustrate how antisense RNA has been used in plant genetic engineering, we will
examine how tomatoes with delayed ripening have been produced. This is an important
example of plant genetic modification as it resulted in one of the first GM foodstuffs to
be approved for sale to the general public.
Commercially grown tomatoes and other soft fruits are usually picked before they are
completely ripe, to allow time for the fruits to be transported to the marketplace before
they begin to spoil. This is essential if the process is to be economically viable, but there
is a problem in that most immature fruits do not develop their full flavor if they are
removed from the plant before they are fully ripe. The result is that mass-produced
tomatoes often have a bland taste, which makes them less attractive to the consumer.
Antisense technology has been used in two ways to genetically engineer tomato plants
so that the fruit ripening process is slowed down. This enables the grower to leave the
fruits on the plant until they ripen to the stage where the flavor has fully developed,
there still being time to transport and market the crop before spoilage sets in.
Using antisense RNA to inactivate the polygalacturonase gene
The timescale for development of a fruit is measured as the number of days or weeks
after flowering. In tomato, this process takes approximately eight weeks from start to
finish, with the color and flavor changes associated with ripening beginning after about
six weeks. At this time a number of genes involved in the later stages of ripening are
switched on, including one coding for the polygalacturonase enzyme (Figure 15.8). This
enzyme slowly breaks down the polygalacturonic acid component of the cell walls in the
fruit pericarp, resulting in a gradual softening. The softening makes the fruit palatable,
but if taken too far results in a squashy, spoilt tomato, attractive only to students with
limited financial resources.
Partial inactivation of the polygalacturonase gene should increase the time between
flavor development and spoilage of the fruit. To test this hypothesis, a 730 bp restriction fragment was obtained from the 5′ region of the normal polygalacturonase gene,
representing just under half of the coding sequence (Figure 15.9). The orientation of the
fragment was reversed, a cauliflower mosaic virus promoter was ligated to the start of
the sequence, and a plant polyadenylation signal attached to the end. The construction
was then inserted into the Ti plasmid vector pBIN19 (p. 116). Once inside the plant,
transcription from the cauliflower mosaic virus promoter should result in synthesis of
an antisense RNA complementary to the first half of the polygalacturonase mRNA.

Previous experiments with antisense RNA had suggested that this would be sufficient to
reduce or even prevent translation of the target mRNA.
Transformation was carried out by introducing the recombinant pBIN19 molecules
into Agrobacterium tumefaciens bacteria and then allowing the bacteria to infect tomato
stem segments. Small amounts of callus material collected from the surfaces of these
segments were tested for their ability to grow on an agar medium containing kanamycin
(remember that pBIN19 carries a gene for kanamycin resistance; see Figure 7.14).
Resistant transformants were identified and allowed to develop into mature plants.
The effect of antisense RNA synthesis on the amount of polygalacturonase mRNA in
the cells of ripening fruit was determined by northern hybridization with a singlestranded DNA probe specific for the sense mRNA. These experiments showed that
ripening fruit from transformed plants contained less polygalacturonase mRNA than
the fruits from normal plants. The amounts of polygalacturonase enzyme produced in
the ripening fruits of transformed plants were then estimated from the intensities of the
relevant bands after separation of fruit proteins by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis,
and by directly measuring the enzyme activities in the fruits. The results showed that less
enzyme was synthesized in transformed fruits (Figure 15.10). Most importantly, the
transformed fruits, although undergoing a gradual softening, could be stored for a prolonged period before beginning to spoil. This indicated that the antisense RNA had not
completely inactivated the polygalacturonase gene, but had nonetheless produced a
sufficient reduction in gene expression to delay the ripening process as desired. The

GM tomatoes—marketed under the trade name “FlavrSavr”—were one of the first
genetically engineered plants to be approved for sale to the public, first appearing in
supermarkets in 1994.
Using antisense RNA to inactivate ethylene synthesis
The main trigger that switches on the genes involved in the later stages of tomato ripening is ethylene which, despite being a gas, acts as a hormone in many plants. A second
way of delaying fruit ripening would therefore be to engineer plants so that they do not
synthesize ethylene. Fruits on these plants would develop as normal for the first six
weeks, but would be unable to complete the ripening process. The unripe fruit could
therefore be transported to the marketplace without any danger of the crop spoiling.
Before selling to the consumer, or conversion into paste or some other product, artificial
ripening would be induced by spraying the tomatoes with ethylene.
The penultimate step in the ethylene synthesis pathway is conversion of S-adenosylmethionine to 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid (ACC), which is the immediate
precursor for ethylene. This step is catalyzed by an enzyme called ACC synthase. As
with polygalacturonase, ACC synthase inactivation was achieved by cloning into tomato
a truncated version of the normal ACC synthase gene, inserted into the cloning vector
in the reverse orientation, so that the construct would direct synthesis of an antisense
version of the ACC synthase mRNA. After regeneration, the engineered plants were
grown to the fruiting stage and found to make only 2% of the amount of ethylene produced by non-engineered plants. This reduction was more than sufficient to prevent the
fruit from completing the ripening process. These tomatoes have been marketed as the
“Endless Summer” variety.

15.2.2 Other examples of the use of antisense RNA in plant
genetic engineering
In general terms, the applications of gene subtraction in plant genetic engineering
are probably less broad than those of gene addition. It is easier to think of useful
characteristics that a plant lacks and which might be introduced by gene addition, than
it is to identify disadvantageous traits that the plant already possesses and which could
be removed by gene subtraction. There are, however, a growing number of plant

biotechnology projects based on gene subtraction (Table 15.3), and the approach is
likely to increase in importance as the uncertainties that surround the underlying principles of antisense technology are gradually resolved.

15.3 Problems with genetically modified plants
Ripening-delayed tomatoes produced by gene subtraction were among the first genetically modified whole foods to be approved for marketing. Partly because of this, plant
genetic engineering has provided the battleground on which biotechnologists and other
interested parties have fought over the safety and ethical issues that arise from our ability
to alter the genetic make-up of living organisms. A number of the most important questions do not directly concern genes and the expertise needed to answer them will not
be found in this book. For example, we cannot discuss in an authoritative fashion the
possible impact, good or otherwise, that GM crops might have on local farming practices
in the developing world. However, we can, and should, look at the biological issues.

15.3.1 Safety concerns with selectable markers
One of the main areas of concern to emerge from the debate over genetically modified
tomatoes is the possible harmful effects of the marker genes used with plant cloning
vectors. Most plant vectors carry a copy of a gene for kanamycin resistance, enabling
transformed plants to be identified during the cloning process. The kan R gene, also
called nptII, is bacterial in origin and codes for the enzyme neomycin phosphotransferase II. This gene and its enzyme product are present in all cells of an engineered
plant. The fear that neomycin phosphotransferase might be toxic to humans has been
allayed by tests with animal models, but two other safety issues remain:
l

l

Could the kan R gene contained in a genetically modified foodstuff be passed to
bacteria in the human gut, making these resistant to kanamycin and related
antibiotics?
Could the kan R gene be passed to other organisms in the environment, and would
this result in damage to the ecosystem?

Neither question can be fully answered with our current knowledge. It can be argued
that digestive processes would destroy all the kan R genes in a genetically modified food
before they could reach the bacterial flora of the gut, and that, even if a gene did avoid

destruction, the chances of it being transferred to a bacterium would be very small.
Nevertheless, the risk factor is not zero. Similarly, although experiments suggest that
growth of genetically modified plants would have a negligible effect on the environment,
as kan R genes are already common in natural ecosystems, the future occurrence of some
unforeseen and damaging event cannot be considered an absolute impossibility.
The fears surrounding the use of kan R and other marker genes have prompted
biotechnologists to devise ways of removing these genes from plant DNA after the transformation event has been verified. One of the strategies makes use of an enzyme from
bacteriophage P1, called Cre, which catalyzes a recombination event that excises DNA
fragments flanked by specific 34 bp recognition sequences (Figure 15.11). To use this
system the plant is transformed with two cloning vectors, the first carrying the gene
being added to the plant along with its kan R selectable marker gene surrounded by the
Cre target sequences, and the second carrying the Cre gene. After transformation,
expression of the Cre gene results in excision of the kan R gene from the plant DNA.
What if the Cre gene is itself hazardous in some way? This is immaterial as the two
vectors used in the transformation would probably integrate their DNA fragments into
different chromosomes, so random segregation during sexual reproduction would result
in first generation plants that contained one integrated fragment but not the other. A
plant that contains neither the Cre gene nor the kan R selectable marker, but does contain the important gene that we wished to add to the plant’s genome, can therefore be
obtained.

15.3.2 The terminator technology
The Cre recombination system also underlies one of the most controversial aspects of
plant genetic engineering, the so-called terminator technology. This is one of the processes by which the companies who market GM crops attempt to protect their financial
investment by ensuring that farmers must buy new seed every year, rather than simply
collecting seed from the crop and sowing this second generation seed the following
year. In reality, even with conventional crops, mechanisms have been devised to ensure
that second generation seed cannot be grown by farmers, but the general controversies
surrounding GM crops have placed the terminator technology in the public eye.
The terminator technology centers on the gene for ribosome inactivating protein
(RIP). The ribosome inactivating protein blocks protein synthesis by cutting one of
the ribosomal RNA molecules into two segments (Figure 15.12a). Any cell in which the
ribosome inactivating protein is active will quickly die. In GM plants that utilize the
terminator system, the RIP gene is placed under control of a promoter that is active
only during embryo development. The plants therefore grow normally but the seeds
that they produce are sterile.

How are the first generation seeds, those sold to farmers, obtained? To begin
with, the RIP gene is non-functional because it is disrupted by a segment of non-RIP
DNA (Figure 15.12b). However, this DNA is flanked by the 34 bp recognition
sequences for the Cre recombinase. In these plants the gene for the Cre recombinase
is placed under control of a promoter that is switched on by tetracycline. Once seeds
have been obtained, the supplier activates the Cre recombinase by placing the seeds in
a tetracycline solution. This removes the blocking DNA from the RIP gene, which
becomes functional but remains silent until its own promoter becomes active during
embryogenesis.

15.3.3 The possibility of harmful effects on the environment
A second area of concern regarding genetically modified plants is that their new gene
combinations might harm the environment in some way. These concerns have to be
addressed individually for each type of GM crop, as different engineered genes might
have different impacts. We will examine the work that has been carried out to assess
whether it is possible that herbicide resistant plants, one of the two examples of gene
addition that we studied earlier in this chapter, can have a harmful effect. As these
are the most widely grown GM crops, they have been subject to some of the most
comprehensive environmental studies. In particular, in 1999, the UK Government
commissioned an independent investigation into how herbicide resistant crops,
whose growth in the UK was not at that time permitted, might affect the abundance and
diversity of farmland wildlife.

279

280

Part III The Applications of Gene Cloning and DNA Analysis in Biotechnology

After delays due to activists attempting to prevent the work from being carried out,
the UK research team reported their findings in 2003. The study involved 273 field
trials throughout England, Wales, and Scotland, and included glyphosate resistant sugar
beet as well as maize and spring rape engineered for resistance to a second herbicide,
glufosinate-ammonium. The results, as summarized in the official report (see Burke
(2003) in Further Reading), were as follows:
The team found that there were differences in the abundance of wildlife between GM crop
fields and conventional crop fields. Growing conventional beet and spring rape was better
for many groups of wildlife than growing GM beet and spring rape. There were more
insects, such as butterflies and bees, in and around the conventional crops because there
were more weeds to provide food and cover. There were also more weed seeds in
conventional beet and spring rape crops than in their GM counterparts. Such seeds are
important in the diets of some animals, particularly some birds. In contrast, growing GM
maize was better for many groups of wildlife than conventional maize. There were more
weeds in and around the GM crops, more butterflies and bees around at certain times of the
year, and more weed seeds. The researchers stress that the differences they found do not
arise just because the crops have been genetically modified. They arise because these GM
crops give farmers new options for weed control. That is, they use different herbicides and
apply them differently. The results of this study suggest that growing such GM crops could
have implications for wider farmland biodiversity. However, other issues will affect the
medium- and long-term impacts, such as the areas and distribution of land involved, how
the land is cultivated and how crop rotations are managed. These make it hard for
researchers to predict the medium- and large-scale effects of GM cropping with any
certainty. In addition, other management decisions taken by farmers growing conventional
crops will continue to impact on wildlife.

DNA analysis in the identification of crime suspects
Studying kinship by DNA profiling
Six identification by DNA analysis
Archaeogenetics—using DNA to study human prehistory

Forensic science is the final area of biotechnology that we will consider. Hardly a week
goes by without a report in the national press of another high profile crime that has
been solved thanks to DNA analysis. The applications of molecular biology in forensics
center largely on the ability of DNA analysis to identify an individual from hairs, bloodstains, and other items recovered from the crime scene. In the popular media, these
techniques are called genetic fingerprinting, though the more accurate term for the
procedures used today is DNA profiling. We begin this chapter by examining the
methods used in genetic fingerprinting and DNA profiling, including their use both
in identification of individuals and in establishing if individuals are members of a single
family. This will lead us into an exploration of the ways in which genetic techniques are
being used in archaeology.

16.1 DNA analysis in the identification of crime
suspects
It is probably impossible for a person to commit a crime without leaving behind a trace
of his or her DNA. Hairs, spots of blood, and even conventional fingerprints contain
traces of DNA, enough to be studied by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The analysis does not have to be done immediately, and in recent years a number of past
crimes—so-called “cold cases”—have been solved and the criminal brought to justice
because of DNA testing that has been carried out on archived material. So how do these
powerful methods work?
The basis to genetic fingerprinting and DNA profiling is that identical twins are the
only individuals who have identical copies of the human genome. Of course, the human
genome is more or less the same in everybody—the same genes will be in the same order
with the same stretches of intergenic DNA between them. But the human genome, as
well as those of other organisms, contains many polymorphisms, positions where the
nucleotide sequence is not the same in every member of the population. We have already
encountered the most important of these polymorphic sites earlier, because these
variable sequences are the same ones that are used as DNA markers in genome mapping
(p. 180). They include restriction fragment length polymorphisms (RFLPs), short tandem
repeats (STRs), and single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). All three can occur within
genes as well as in intergenic regions, and altogether there are several million of these
polymorphic sites in the human genome, with SNPs being the most common.

16.1.1 Genetic fingerprinting by hybridization probing
The first method for using DNA analysis to identify individuals was developed in the
mid-1980s by Sir Alec Jeffreys of Leicester University. This technique was not based on
any of the types of polymorphic site listed above, but on a different kind of variation in
the human genome called a hypervariable dispersed repetitive sequence. As the name
indicates, this is a repeated sequence that occurs at various places (“dispersed”) in the
human genome. The key feature of these sequences is that their genomic positions are
variable: they are located at different positions in the genomes of different people
(Figure 16.1a).
The particular repeat that was initially used in genetic fingerprinting contains the
sequence GGGCAGGANG (where N is any nucleotide). To prepare a fingerprint, a
sample of DNA is digested with a restriction endonuclease, the fragments separated by
agarose gel electrophoresis, and a Southern blot prepared (p. 142). Hybridization to
the blot of a labeled probe containing the repeat sequence reveals a series of bands, each
one representing a restriction fragment that contains the repeat (Figure 16.1b). Because
the insertion sites of the repeat sequence are variable, the same procedure carried out
with a DNA sample from a second person will give a different pattern of bands. These
are the genetic fingerprints for those individuals.

16.1.2 DNA profiling by PCR of short tandem repeats
Strictly speaking, genetic fingerprinting refers only to hybridization analysis of dispersed
repeat sequences. This technique has been valuable in forensic work but suffers from
three limitations:

A relatively large amount of DNA is needed because the technique depends on
hybridization analysis. Fingerprinting cannot be used with the minute amounts of
DNA in hair and bloodstains.
Interpretation of the fingerprint can be difficult because of variations in the
intensities of the hybridization signals. In a court of law, minor differences in band
intensity between a test fingerprint and that of a suspect can be sufficient for the
suspect to be acquitted.
Although the insertion sites of the repeat sequences are hypervariable, there is a
limit to this variability and therefore a small chance that two unrelated individuals
could have the same, or at least very similar, fingerprints. Again, this consideration
can lead to acquittal when a case is brought to court.

The more powerful technique of DNA profiling avoids these problems. Profiling
makes use of the polymorphic sequences called STRs. As described on p. 181, an STR
is a short sequence, 1–13 nucleotides in length, which is repeated several times in a
tandem array. In the human genome, the most common type of STR is the dinucleotide
repeat [CA]n, where “n”, the number of repeats, is usually between 5 and 20 (Figure 16.2a).
The number of repeats in a particular STR is variable because repeats can be added
or, less frequently, removed by errors that occur during DNA replication. In the population as a whole, there might be as many as ten different versions of a particular STR,
each of the alleles characterized by a different number of repeats. In DNA profiling, the
alleles of a selected number of different STRs are identified. This can be achieved quickly
and with very small amounts of DNA by PCRs with primers that anneal to the DNA
sequences either side of a repeat (see Figure 10.19). After the PCR, the products can be
examined by agarose gel electrophoresis. The size of the band or bands that are seen in
the gel indicate the allele or alleles present in the DNA sample that has been tested
(Figure 16.2b). Two alleles of an STR can be present in a single DNA sample because

there are two copies of each STR, one on the chromosome inherited from the mother
and one on the chromosome from the father.
Because PCR is used, DNA profiling is very sensitive and enables results to be
obtained with hairs and other specimens that contain trace amounts of DNA. The results
are unambiguous, and a match between DNA profiles is usually accepted as evidence in
a trial. The current methodology, called CODIS (Combined DNA Index System), makes
use of 12 STRs with sufficient variability to give only a one in 1015 chance that two
individuals, other than identical twins, have the same profile. As the world population
is around 6 × 109, the statistical likelihood of two individuals on the planet sharing the
same profile is so low as to be considered implausible when DNA evidence is presented
in a court of law. Each STR is typed by PCRs with primers that are fluorescently labeled
and which anneal either side of the variable repeat region. The alleles present at the
STR are then typed by determining the sizes of the amplicons by capillary gel electrophoresis. Two or more STRs can be typed together in a multiplex PCR if their product
sizes do not overlap, or if the individual primer pairs are labeled with different
fluorescent markers, enabling the products to be distinguished in the capillary gel
(Figure 16.2c).

16.2 Studying kinship by DNA profiling
As well as identification of criminals, DNA profiling can also be used to infer if two or
more individuals are members of the same family. This type of study is called kinship
analysis and its main day-to-day application is in paternity testing.

16.2.1 Related individuals have similar DNA profiles
Your DNA profile, like all other aspects of your genome, is inherited partly from your
mother and partly from your father. Relationships within a family therefore become
apparent when the alleles of a particular STR are marked on the family pedigree (Figure 16.3). In this example, we see that 3 of the 4 children have inherited the 12-repeat
allele from the father. This observation in itself is not sufficient to deduce that these
three children are siblings, though the statistical chance would be quite high if the
12-repeat allele was uncommon in the population as a whole. To increase the degree of
certainty, more STRs would have to be typed but, as with identification of individuals,
the analysis need not be endless, because a comparison of 12 STRs gives an acceptable
probability that relationships that are observed are real.

16.2.2 DNA profiling and the remains of the Romanovs
An interesting example of the use of DNA profiling in a kinship study is provided by
work carried out during the 1990s on the bones of the Romanovs, the last members of
the Russian ruling family. The Romanovs and their descendents ruled Russia from the
early 17th century until the time of the Russian Revolution, when Tsar Nicholas II was
deposed and he and his wife, the Tsarina Alexandra, and their five children imprisoned.
On 17 July 1918, all seven, along with their doctor and three servants, were murdered
and their bodies disposed of in a shallow roadside grave near Yekaterinburg in the Urals.
In 1991, after the fall of communism, the remains were recovered with the intention
that they should be given a more fitting burial.
STR analysis of the Romanov bones
Although it was suspected that the bones recovered were indeed those of the Romanovs,
the possibility that they belonged to some other unfortunate group of people could
not be discounted. Nine skeletons had been found in the grave—six adults and three
children—examination of the bones suggesting that four of the adults were male and
two female, and the three children were all female. If these were the remains of the
Romanovs, then their son Alexei and one their daughters were, for some, reason, absent.
The bodies showed signs of violence, consistent with reports of their treatment during

and after death, and at least some of the remains were clearly aristocratic as their teeth
were filled with porcelain, silver, and gold, dentistry well beyond the means of the
average Russian of the early 20th century.
DNA was extracted from bones from each individual and five STRs typed by PCR to
test the hypothesis that the three children were siblings and that two of the adults were
their parents, as would be the case if indeed these were the Romanovs. The results
immediately showed that the three children could be siblings, as they have identical
genotypes for the STRs called VWA/31 and FES/FPS and share alleles at each of the
three other loci (Figure 16.4). The THO1 data show that female adult 2 cannot be the
mother of the children because she only possesses allele 6, which none of the children
have. Female adult 1, however, has allele 8, which all three children have. Examination
of the other STRs confirms that she could be the mother of each of the children, and so
she is identified as the Tsarina. The THO1 data exclude male adult 4 as a possible father
of the children, and the VWA/31 results exclude male adults 1 and 2. When all the STRs
are taken into account, male adult 3 could be the father of the children and therefore
is identified as the Tsar. Note that all these conclusions can be drawn simply from the
TH01 and VWA/31 results: the other STR data simply provide corroborating evidence.
Mitochondrial DNA was used to link the Romanov skeletons with living relatives
The STR analysis showed that the skeletons included a family group as expected, if
these were indeed the bones of the Romanovs. But could they be the remains of some

other unfortunate group of people? To address this problem, the DNA from the bones
was compared with DNA samples from living relatives of the Romanovs. This work
included studies of mitochondrial DNA, the small 16 kb circles of DNA contained in
the energy-generating mitochondria of cells. Mitochondrial DNA contains polymorphisms that can be used to infer relationships between individuals, but the degree of
variability is not as great as displayed by STRs, so mitochondrial DNA is rarely used for
kinship studies among closely related individuals such as those of a single family group.
But mitochondrial DNA has the important property of being inherited solely through
the female line, the father’s mitochondrial DNA being lost during fertilization and not
contributing to the son or daughter’s DNA content. This maternal inheritance pattern
makes it easier to distinguish relationships when the individuals being compared are
more distantly related, as was the case with the living relatives of the Romanovs.
Comparisons were therefore made between mitochondrial DNA sequences obtained
from the skeletons and that of Prince Philip, the Duke of Edinburgh, whose maternal grandmother was Princess Victoria of Hesse, the Tsarina Alexandra’s sister (Figure 16.5).
The mitochondrial DNA sequences from four of the female skeletons—the three
children and the adult female identified as the Tsarina—were exactly the same as that
of Prince Philip, strong evidence that the four females were members of the same lineage. Comparisons were also made with of two living matrilineal descendants of Tsar
Nicholas’s grandmother, Louise of Hesse-Cassel. This analysis was more complicated,
as two sequences were present among the clones of the PCR product obtained from the
adult male thought to be the Tsar. These sequences differed at a single position which
was either a C or a T, the former four times more frequent than the latter. This could
indicate that the sample was contaminated with somebody else’s DNA but instead was
interpreted as showing that the Tsar’s mitochondrial DNA was heteroplasmic, an infrequent situation where two different mitochondrial DNAs co-exist within the same cells.
The two descendents of the Tsar’s grandmother both had the mitochondrial DNA
version with a T at this position, suggesting that the mutation producing the C variant
had occurred very recently in the Tsar’s lineage. Support for this hypothesis was subsequently provided by analysis of DNA from the Tsar’s brother, Grand Duke George
Alexandrovich, who died in 1899, which showed that he also displayed heteroplasmy
at the same position in his mitochondrial DNA. On balance, the evidence suggested that
the Tsar’s remains had been correctly identified.

Chapter 16 Gene Cloning and DNA Analysis in Forensic Science and Archaeology

The missing children
Only three children were found in the Romanovs’ grave. Alexei, the only boy, and one
of the four girls were missing. During the middle decades of the 20th century, several
women claimed to be a Romanov princess, because even before the bones were recovered there had been rumors that one of the girls, Anastasia, had escaped the clutches of
the Bolsheviks and fled to the West. One of the most famous of these claimants was
Anna Anderson, whose case was first widely publicised in the 1920s. Anna Anderson
died in 1984 but she left an archived tissue sample whose mitochondrial DNA does not
match the Tsarina’s and suggests a woman of Polish origin. There have also been various people claiming to be descended from Tsarevich Alexei. But these stories are almost
certainly romances, as the partially cremated bodies of two other children found near
Yekaterinburg in 2007 have now been shown to have mitochondrial DNA sequences
that suggest that they are missing Romanov children.

16.3 Sex identification by DNA analysis
DNA analysis can also be used to identify the sex of an individual. The genetic difference between the sexes is the possession of a Y chromosome by males, so detection
of DNA specific for the Y chromosome would enable males and females to be
distinguished. Forensic scientists occasionally have to deal with bodies that are so badly
damaged that DNA analysis is the only way of identifying their sex.
DNA tests can also be used to identify the sex of an unborn child. Finding out if a
fetus is a boy or a girl is usually delayed until the anatomical differences have developed
and the sex can be identified by scanning, but under some circumstances an earlier indication of sex is desirable. An example is when the pedigree of the family indicates that
an unborn male might suffer from an inherited disease and the parents wish to make an
early decision about whether to continue the pregnancy.
A third application of DNA-based sex identification, and the one that has been
responsible for many of the developments in this field, is in the analysis of archaeological specimens. Male and female skeletons can be distinguished if key bones such as the
skull or the pelvis are intact, but with fragmentary remains, or those of young children,
there are not enough sex-specific anatomical differences for a confident identification
to be made. If ancient DNA is preserved in the bones, a DNA-based method can tell the
archaeologists if they are dealing with a male or a female.

16.3.1 PCRs directed at Y chromosome-specific sequences
The simplest way to use DNA analysis to identify sex is to design a PCR specific for a
region of the Y chromosome. The PCR has to be designed with care, because the X and
Y chromosomes are not completely different, some segments being shared between the
two. But there are many unique regions within the Y chromosome. In particular, there
are several repeated sequences that are only located in the Y chromosome, these
repeated sequences acting as multiple targets for the PCR and hence giving greater
sensitivity, an important consideration if you are dealing with a badly damaged body
or an ancient bone.
A PCR directed at Y-specific DNA sequences would give a product with male DNA
but no band if the sample comes from a female (Figure 16.6). This is a clear distinction between the two alternatives and hence a perfectly satisfactory system for most

applications. But what if the sample did not contain any DNA, or if the DNA was too
degraded to work in the PCR, or if the sample also contained inhibitors of Taq polymerase that prevented the enzyme from carrying out the PCR? All of these possibilities
could occur with archaeological specimens, especially those that have been buried in
the ground and become contaminated with humic acids and other compounds known
to inhibit many of the enzymes used in molecular biology research. Now the test
becomes ambiguous because a specimen that is unable to give a PCR product for one of
these reasons could mistakenly be identified as female. The result would be exactly the
same: no band on the gel.

16.3.2 PCR of the amelogenin gene
The lack of discrimination between “female” and “failed PCR” that occurs when
Y-specific sequences are studied has led to the development of more sophisticated DNA
tests for sex identification, ones that give unambiguous results for both males and
females. The most widely used of these involves PCRs that amplify the amelogenin gene.
The amelogenin gene codes for a protein found in tooth enamel. It is one of the few
genes that are present on the Y chromosome and, like many of these genes, there is also
a copy on the X chromosome. But the two copies are far from identical, and when the
nucleotide sequences are aligned a number of indels, positions where a segment of DNA
has either been inserted into one sequence or deleted from the other sequence, are seen
(Figure 16.7a). If the primers for a PCR anneal either side of an indel, the products
obtained from the X and Y chromosomes would have different sizes. Female DNA
would give a single band when the products are examined, because females only have
the X chromosome, whereas males would give two bands, one from the X chromosome
and one from the Y (Figure 16.7b). If the sample contains no DNA or the PCR fails for
some other reason, no band will be obtained: there is no confusion between the failure
and a male or female result.
The development of the amelogenin system for sex identification is having an important impact in archaeology. No longer is it necessary to assign sex to buried bones on
the basis of vague differences in the structures of the bones. The greater confidence that
DNA-based sex testing allows is resulting in some unexpected discoveries. In particular, archaeologists are now reviewing their preconceptions about the meaning of the
objects buried in a grave along with the body. It was thought that if a body was accompanied by a sword then it must be male, or if the grave contained beads then the body
was female. DNA testing has shown that these stereotypes are not always correct and
that archaeologists must take a broader view of the link between grave goods and sex.

16.4 Archaeogenetics—using DNA to study human
prehistory
Sex identification and kinship studies are not the only ways in which gene cloning and
DNA analysis are being applied in archaeology. By examining DNA sequences in living
and dead humans, archaeologists have begun to understand the evolutionary origins of
modern humans, and the routes followed by prehistoric people as they colonized the
planet. This area of research is called archaeogenetics.

16.4.1 The origins of modern humans
Paleontologists believe that humans originated in Africa because it is here that all of the
oldest pre-human fossils have been found. The fossil evidence reveals that hominids
first migrated out of Africa over one million years ago, but these were not modern
humans. Instead it was an earlier species called Homo erectus, who were the first
hominids to become geographically dispersed, eventually spreading to all parts of the
Old World.
The events that followed the dispersal of H. erectus are controversial. From studies
of fossils, many paleontologists believe that the H. erectus populations which became
located in different parts of the Old World gave rise to the modern Homo sapiens
populations found in those areas today (Figure 16.8a). This process is called multiregional evolution. There may have been a certain amount of interbreeding between
humans from different geographical regions but, to a large extent, these various populations remained separate throughout their evolutionary history.
DNA analysis has challenged the multiregional hypothesis
Doubts about the multiregional hypothesis were raised in 1987 when geneticists first
started using DNA analysis to ask questions about human evolution. In one of the very

first archaeogenetics projects, restriction fragment length polymorphisms (RFLPs) were
measured in mitochondrial DNA samples taken from 147 humans, from all parts of the
world. The resulting data were then used to construct a phylogenetic tree showing
the evolutionary relationships between different human populations. From this tree,
various deductions were made:
l

l

l

The root of the tree represents a woman (remember, mitochondrial DNA is
inherited only through the female line) whose mitochondrial genome is ancestral
to all the 147 modern mitochondrial DNAs that were tested. This woman has
been called mitochondrial Eve. Of course, she was not equivalent to the Biblical
character and was by no means the only woman alive at the time: she simply was
the person who carried the ancestral mitochondrial DNA that gave rise to all the
mitochondrial DNAs in existence today.
Mitochondrial Eve lived in Africa. This was deduced because the ancestral
sequence split the tree into two segments, one of which was composed solely of
African mitochondrial DNAs. Because of this split, it was inferred that the ancestor
was also located in Africa.
Mitochondrial Eve lived between 140,000 and 290,000 years ago. This conclusion
was drawn by applying the molecular clock to the phylogenetic tree. The
molecular clock is a measure of the speed at which evolutionary change occurs in
mitochondrial DNA sequences, and is calibrated from the rate at which mutations
are known to accumulate in mitochondrial DNA. By comparing the sequence
inferred for Eve’s mitochondrial DNA with the sequences of the 147 modern
DNAs, the number of years needed for all of the necessary evolutionary changes
to take place was calculated.

The key finding that mitochondrial Eve lived in Africa no earlier than 290,000 years
ago does not agree with the suggestion that we are all descended from H. erectus populations who left Africa over a million years ago. A new hypothesis for human origins was
therefore devised, called Out of Africa. According to this hypothesis, modern humans—
H. sapiens—evolved specifically from those H. erectus populations that remained in
Africa. Modern humans then moved into the rest of the Old World between 100,000
and 50,000 years ago, displacing the descendents of H. erectus that they encountered
(Figure 16.8b).

Chapter 16 Gene Cloning and DNA Analysis in Forensic Science and Archaeology

At first, the mitochondrial Eve results were heavily criticized. It became apparent
that the computer analysis used to construct the phylogenetic tree was flawed, mainly
because the algorithms used to compare the RFLP data were not sufficiently robust
to deal with this huge amount of information. However, the criticisms have now died
away as the results of more extensive mitochondrial DNA studies, using actual DNA
sequences rather than RFLPs and analyzed using modern, powerful computers, have all
confirmed the findings of the first project. To take one example, when the complete
mitochondrial genome sequences of 53 people, again from all over the world, were
compared, a date of 220,000–120,000 years for mitochondrial Eve was obtained. An
interesting complement has been provided by studies of the Y chromosome which,
of course, descends exclusively through the male line. This work has revealing that
“Y chromosome Adam” also lived in Africa between 40,000 and 140,000 years ago.
DNA analysis shows that Neanderthals are not the ancestors of modern Europeans
Neanderthals are extinct hominids who lived in Europe between 300,000 and 30,000
years ago. They were descended from the H. erectus populations who left Africa about
one million years ago and, according to the Out of Africa hypothesis, were displaced
when modern humans reached Europe about 50,000 years ago. Therefore, one prediction of the Out of Africa hypothesis is that Neanderthals are not the ancestors of
modern Europeans. Analysis of ancient DNA from Neanderthal bones has been used
to test this prediction.
The first Neanderthal specimen selected for study was the type specimen, which had
been found in Germany in the 19th century. This fossil has not been precisely dated but
is between 30,000 and 100,000 years old. This places it at the very limits of ancient
DNA survival, as natural degradation processes are thought to break down the DNA surviving in bones so that very little remains after about 50,000 years, even in specimens
that are kept very cold, for example by burial in permafrost. The Neanderthal specimen
had not been preserved under particularly cold conditions, but nonetheless it was
possible to obtain a short part of the mitochondrial DNA sequence of this individual.
This was achieved by carrying out nine overlapping PCRs, each one amplifying less than
170 bp of DNA but together giving a total length of 377 bp.
A phylogenetic tree was constructed to compare the sequence obtained from the
Neanderthal bone with the sequences of six of the main mitochondrial DNA variants
(called haplogroups) present in modern Europeans. The Neanderthal sequence was positioned on a branch of its own, connected to the root of the tree but not linked directly
to any of the modern human sequences (Figure 16.9). This was the first evidence suggesting that Neanderthals are not ancestral to modern Europeans.

Part III The Applications of Gene Cloning and DNA Analysis in Biotechnology

Next, the Neanderthal sequence was aligned with the equivalent sequences from 994
modern humans. The differences were striking. The Neanderthal sequence differed
from the modern sequences at an average of 27.2 ± 2.2 nucleotide positions, whereas
the modern sequences, which came from all over the world, not just Europe, differed
from each other at only 8.0 ± 3.1 positions. This degree of difference is incompatible
with the notion that modern Europeans are descended from Neanderthals. Similar
results were obtained when mitochondrial DNA from a second Neanderthal skeleton
was examined. The results therefore provide an independent proof of the Out of Africa
hypothesis, and show that, at least for Europe, the multiregional model is incorrect.

16.4.2 DNA can also be used to study prehistoric human
migrations
The modern humans that displaced Neanderthals arrived in Europe about 40,000 years
ago. This is clear from the fossil and archaeological records. But were these humans
themselves displaced by newer populations who migrated into Europe more recently?
The spread of agriculture into Europe
Some archaeologists have suggested that new populations of humans might have moved
into Europe during the past 10,000 years, and that these humans brought agriculture
into the continent. The transition from hunting and gathering to farming occurred in
southwest Asia about 10,000 years ago, when early Neolithic villagers began to cultivate crops such as wheat and barley. After becoming established, farming spread into
Asia, Europe, and North Africa. By searching archaeological sites for the remains
of cultivated plants or for implements used in farming, two routes by which agriculture spread into Europe have been traced. One of these trajectories followed the
Mediterranean coast to Spain and eventually to Britain, and the second passed along the
Danube and Rhine valleys to northern Europe (Figure 16.10).
One explanation for the spread of agriculture is that farmers moved from one place
to another, taking with them their implements, animals, and crops, and displacing the
indigenous, pre-agricultural communities that were present in Europe at that time.
This wave of advance model was initially supported by archaeogeneticists, as it agrees
with the results of a large phylogenetic study, carried out in the 1990s, of the allele
frequencies for 95 nuclear genes in populations from across Europe. This dataset was
analyzed by a technique often used in population genetics, called principal component
analysis, which attempts to identify patterns in the geographical distribution of alleles,
these patterns possibly being indicative of past population migrations.
The most striking pattern within the European dataset, accounting for about 28% of
the total genetic variation, is a gradation of allele frequencies running from southeast
to northwest across the continent (Figure 16.11). This pattern suggests that a migration
of people occurred either from southeast to northwest Europe, or in the opposite direction. Because the former migration coincides with the spread of farming, as revealed by
the archaeological record, this first principal component was looked on as providing
strong support for the wave of advance model.
Using mitochondrial DNA to study past human migrations into Europe
Principal component analysis has one weakness when applied to past human migrations. It is difficult to determine when a migration identified in this way took place.
This means that the link between the first principal component and the spread of

where the wild versions of wheat and barley grow, and where these plants were first cultivated by farmers some
10,000 years ago.

agriculture is based solely on the pattern of the allele gradation, not on any complementary evidence relating to the period when this gradation was set up.
A second study of European human populations, one which does include a time
dimension, has been carried out using mitochondrial DNA. To begin with, the distribution of mitochondrial DNA sequence variations in 821 individuals from populations
across Europe were compared. The data gave no evidence for a gradation of allele frequencies, and instead suggested that European populations have remained relatively
static over the past 20,000 years. This result raised important doubts about the wave of
advance model. How then did agriculture spread into Europe?
More sophisticated studies of mitochondrial DNA variations in modern European
populations is pointing toward a new model for the spread of agriculture. It has been
discovered that the mitochondrial genomes present among modern Europeans can be
grouped into 11 major sequence classes, or haplogroups, each one displaying distinctive
nucleotide sequence variations. For each of these haplogroups, the molecular clock can
be used to deduce a date of origin, which is thought to correspond with the date at
which the haplogroup entered Europe (Figure 16.12). The most ancient haplogroup,
called U, first appeared in Europe about 50,000 years ago, coinciding with the period
when, according to the archaeological record, the first modern humans moved into the
continent as the ice sheets withdrew to the north at the end of the last major glaciation.

Those haplogroups whose arrivals coincide with the spread of agriculture are shown in red.

The youngest haplogroups, J and T1, which at 9000 years in age could correspond to
the origins of agriculture, are possessed by just 8.3% of the modern European population, confirming that the spread of farming into Europe was not the huge wave of
advance indicated by the principal component study. Instead, it is now thought that
farming was brought into Europe by a smaller group of “pioneers” who interbred with
the existing pre-farming communities rather than displacing them.
Archaeogenetics truly illustrates how broad ranging an impact gene cloning and DNA
analysis have had on science.
