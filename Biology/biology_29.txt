INTRODUCTION

The roles of veterinarians in society range from clinician to researcher, food inspector to enlisted
military officer. Critical to the educational training of all of these veterinarians is the fundamental
understanding of basic anatomy, both gross and microscopic. The knowledge of normal anatomy
provides the basis of both physiology as well as pathology. Relating gross (e.g. physical exam findings)
or microscopic changes (e.g. surgical biopsy) to specific disease processes first requires firm knowledge
of “normal”; hence, disease is detected as an alteration of normal!
Teaching histology in the veterinary curriculum is the challenging process of conveying to the future
veterinarian the clinical relevance of microscopic anatomy, which may not be inherently appreciable
to the first-year veterinary student. The authors are fortunate to instruct professional students both
in the preclinical curriculum and the senior clinical rotations where the relevance is readily apparent.
When a senior student looks at a cytology of an osteosarcoma, they intuitively know that the neoplastic
cells observed are osteoblasts with a small proportion of non-neoplastic osteoclasts. The same goes
for ultrasonography of equine ovaries where they can extrapolate the “black hole” in an ovary as a
large pre-ovulatory follicle containing an oocyte and lined by granulosa cells. From the instructor’s
perspective, it is easy to go overboard in terms of the amount of information conveyed to the student
in this type of course, particularly if the instructor is passionate about a particular organ system! The
modern veterinary medical curriculum is constantly changing and expanding. It is the instructor’s
responsibility to focus on not only conveying the necessary information, but packaging this
information in the context of clinical medicine. For this reason, this text focuses on conveying the
basic material required for understanding the microscopic anatomy to better understand the disease
processes that they will learn later in the curriculum. Included is a basic overview of veterinary
histology of commonly reviewed organ systems, with the goal of illustrating important concepts of
cells, tissues, and organs in a manner that we hope is not only accessible to first-year veterinary
students, but serves as a reference for clinical medicine and pathology.
The textbook is meant to be utilized as both a companion to the course “Comparative Structure
and Function of Tissues”, VM6530 as well as a standalone reference for basic veterinary microscopic
anatomy.

OVERVIEW

The cell is the smallest and most basic unit of life and makes up all living organisms, whether
unicellular or multicellular. In multicellular organisms, several cell types can interact to form
specialized tissues and organs. Cells contain multiple organelles, or subcellular structures, that each
have distinct structures and specific functions. Functions of these organelles are often dictated by the
structure and are dependent on the location (tissue) of the cell and the physiological and disease status
of the organism.

CELL MEMBRANE

The cell membrane acts as the barrier between inside and outside of the cell. It is composed of an
asymmetric phospholipid bilayer with embedded proteins and carbohydrates and is approximately 7
nm thick. The phospholipids in the membrane can move through lateral diffusion, flexion, or rotation,
a process called the fluid mosaic model. The asymmetric bilayer serves an important function for the
cell by regulating molecular diffusion across the membrane based on charge and size. The two general
categories of proteins present in the cell membrane are referred to as integral or paramembrane
proteins. Integral proteins form hydrophobic bonds with lipids and other integral proteins. These
proteins penetrate partially or through lipid bilayer and may be glycoproteins (oligosaccharides
attached to N-terminal end of protein). Paramembrane proteins are less hydrophobic than integral
proteins. They may associate with lipid polar headgroups or integral proteins via H-bonds or ionic
interactions.
Some proteins exist as receptors located within the membrane, with functions ranging from
activating downstream intracellular signaling when bound by ligand or acting as channels to allow ions
to flow into or out of the cell. Other functions of the membrane are to subdivide the cytoplasm within
the cell and increase surface area of the cell. Within the membrane are structures named lipid rafts.
These areas are enriched in cholesterol, sphingolipid, and proteins. Lipid rafts are important to the cell
for signal transduction across the membrane.

NUCLEUS AND NUCLEAR STRUCTURES

The nucleus contains and confines the genetic material of a eukaryotic cell. Prokaryotic cells do not
have a defined nucleus, but rather have genetic material within the cytoplasm. The nuclear envelope
is the cellular component that surrounds and defines the nucleus. This structure is composed of two
membranes that are continuous with the rough endoplasmic reticulum that will be further discussed
later in this chapter. Within the nuclear envelope are nuclear pores, donut-shaped symmetric ring
structures that allows selective transport of materials such as RNA or proteins, lipids, and
carbohydrates into or out of the nucleus. However, a nuclear localization sequence is necessary before
transport can occur. The fibrous lamina is the third component of the nuclear envelope. The fibrous
lamina is composed of lamin and membrane-associated proteins and is found on the inner surface of
the inner nuclear envelope. This component is responsible for overall nuclear stability and organizing
nuclear events such as DNA replication and mitosis.
Within the nucleus, DNA and histones are packaged into either euchromatin or heterochromatin.
Euchromatin is loosely packed DNA, enabling genetic transcription to occur. T Heterochromatin is
densely packed DNA, which is inactivated and prevents transcription from occurring. Heterochromatin
appears more basophilic than euchromatin with standard hematoxylin and eosin staining. A specific
organelle within the nucleus is the nucleolus. A cell can contain one or several nucleoli, depending
on its activity. The nucleolus synthesizes ribosomal RNA, which is further assembled into ribosomes,
an organelle that will be covered in the next section. In light microscope, nucleolus appears intensely
basophilic, like a blob of heterochromatin. However, the bulk of nucleolus is RNA so the similarity is
very superficial.

ENDOPLASMIC RETICULUM

Rough endoplasmic reticulum (rER) is composed of a membrane (ER) that is a continuation of the
nuclear envelope and ribosomes. RER is arranged in a sheet-like pattern and functions to synthesize
membrane and secretory proteins. Ribosomes can also be free within the cell to synthesize cytoplasmic
proteins. They are composed of protein subunit structures that aid in the conversion of an mRNA
sequence into an amino acid sequence, thereby producing a polypeptide chain that will fold into a
three-dimensional protein. Ribosomes are composed of two asymmetric pieces: large (60S) and small
(40S) subunits. The large (60S) subunit is made of three pieces of RNA (28S, 5.8S and 5S) comprising
65% of subunit, and many other proteins, comprising 35%. The small (40S) subunit made of one piece
of RNA (18S) and many other proteins. The specificity of protein-RNA interactions is so high that a
test tube filled with the right RNA and proteins will self-assemble into a ribosome. Ribosome, mRNA,
tRNA, and enzymes may associate free in cytoplasm and make proteins. Cells use this format when
synthesizing cytoplasmic proteins.
In contrast, smooth endoplasmic reticulum (sER) is both structurally and functionally different than
rER. Firstly, sER does not contain ribosomes and, therefore, is not involved in protein synthesis. Within
the cell, sER appear as tubules that can either be parallel, similar to rER, or as tangles or a “lacelike” pattern. The sER has several important functions throughout the body. In the endocrine system,
this organelle is involved in the biosynthesis of steroids, including testosterone and estrogens, from
cholesterol. In the liver, it is highly involved in detoxification of drugs from the body. A third function
of the sER is its relationship to the contraction of smooth and striated muscle. In muscle, the sER
has the specific name of sarcoplasmic reticulum, which stores intracellular calcium ions. Release and
sequestration of calcium ions has a direct effect on muscle contraction and relaxation, which will be
covered in greater detail in in the muscle chapter.

GOLGI APPARATUS

Once proteins are synthesized by ribosomes and the rER, they are transported to the Golgi apparatus
where further processing takes place. This represents the end of the protein synthesis chain. The
Golgi apparatus performs two main functions in relation to protein processing and packaging. First,
it attaches sugars to proteins to form glycoproteins in a process called glycosylation. It receives the
newly formed polypeptides from the rough ER. Due to resident glycosyltransferase enzymes, the Golgi
can attach sugars to the proteins making glycoproteins. Second, the Golgi then condenses the proteins,
packaging them into membrane bound secretion granules.
The Golgi apparatus has a distinct cup-shaped structure with cisternae, or flattened membranes,
arranged in parallel sheets. Proteins enter the Golgi apparatus on the convex, or forming face, side and
exit on the concave, or maturing face, side.

DEGRADATION ORGANELLES

One of the organelles involved in degrading material is the lysosome. These structures are spherical
particles about 0.5 μm in diameter bounded by a single trilaminar membrane containing (usually)
homogeneous contents of variable densitywith a single layer of semipermeable membrane surrounding
it. The pH within the lysosome is maintained between 4.5-5 for optimal performance of hydrolytic
enzymes. The enzymes inside the intact lysosome are hidden from their substrates and are released
when the membrane is broken by detergents, osmotic shock or freezing-thawing reactions. Because of
this, the enzymes inside a lysosome are said to be latent. These enzymes synthesized in the ER and
packaged in the Golgi apparatus. Material from outside the cell can be ingested through phagocytosis
or pinocytosis and is digested by the lysosome. Similarly, the lysosome can digest material from inside
the cell that is either no longer needed or degraded through a process called autophagy. This process
allows for orderly digestion of cellular components without incurring damage to the entire cell. The
digested components can then be recycled.
A second organelle involved in degradation is a peroxisome or microbody. These are 0.5 μm spherical
membrane-bounded organelles that closely resemble a lysosome . Smaller “microperoxisomes” are
found in some types of cells, e.g., intestine. These structures are small and spherical with a single
semipermeable membrane. Unlike lysosomes though, peroxisomes have a crystalline core.
Peroxisomes contain catalases and oxidases, which use oxidation to break down H2O2 and excess
fatty acids. They also participate in the cholesterol biosynthesis. One of the enzymes involved, HMGCoA reductase, is the target of the popular cholesterol-lowering statins drugs. Perioxisomes also are
involved in the synthesis of bile acids and myelin lipids as well as the breakdown of excess purines to
uric acid.

MITOCHONDRIA

Mitochondria have a complex structure related to their sophisticated function in the cell and is the
primary organelle that produces energy (ATP) for the cell. The number of mitochondria within a
cell varies depending on the energy needs of the cell. For example, a muscle cell will have a high
number of mitochondria due to its high demand for energy. The mitochondria is composed of an
outer and an inner membrane. The outer membrane is composed of a 50:50 lipid:protein mixture,
porins, and numerous enzymes. Porins are proteins that create pores within the membrane, allowing
it to be permeable to molecules up to a certain size. Between the outer and inner membrane, and
intermembrane space contains enzymes that are necessary for nucleoside phosphate exchange. The
inner membrane is highly specialized and impermeable to most molecules that, in turn, is involved in
the mechanism of oxidative phosphorylation by allowing ionic charge separation across this membrane
(Mitchell hypothesis). Therefore, specific carriers are needed for the entry and exit of most
metabolites.
The inner membrane has a 20:80 lipid:protein ratio and contains the enzymes involved in the
respiratory electron transport chain and phosphorylation of ADP. Therefore, the inner membrane
is the primary site of ATP synthesis. Cristae are projections of the inner membrane into the
mitochondrial matrix; the number of cristae present is directly related to the amount of ATP
synthesized. The enzyme ATPase is attached to the matrix surface of cristae and directly couples the
electron transport chain to ADP phosphorylation. Other molecules attached to the cristae include
cytochrome C on the outer surface, which has a role in the electron transport chain and apoptosis, and
succinic dehydrogenase on the matrix surface. Within the mitochondrial matrix are enzymes involved
in metabolism of nucleic acids, lipid synthesis, protein synthesis, and the Kreb’s Cycle. Mitochondria
also play an important role in the regulation of programmed cell death (apoptosis).
Mitochondria acontain genetic material that is inherited from the mother and is found in the
mitochondrial matrix as a circular double stranded molecule. However, only mitochondrial RNAs
and a small number of inner membrane proteins are translated and transcribed from this DNA.
Most mitochondrial proteins are translated and transcribed from nuclear genes. Therefore, they are
synthesized in the cytoplasm of the cell and imported through porins in the outer membrane into the
mitochondria. The presence of DNA in mitochondria provides evidence for how mitochondria may have
developed in the cell, a process called mitochondrial biogenesis. It is theorized that mitochondria are
derived from aerobic endosymbiotic bacteria, meaning bacteria that entered and remained to provide
a benefit to the host cell. Another piece of evidence to support this theory is that mitochondria divide
through a process called binary fission, similar to bacteria.

CYTOSKELETON AND FILAMENTS

The cytoskeleton is the main support structure for the cell. Several filaments of various sizes compose
the cytoskeleton and will be discussed individually. These filaments include microfilaments,
intermediate filaments, and microtubules.
Microfilaments
Microfilaments are named this due to being the smallest filament structure of the cytoskeleton, usually
around 6 nm in diameter. One microfilament is actin, which is composed of monomers polymerized
into a double-stranded helix. While not a microfilament per se, myosins are a family of proteins that
interact with actin to perform various motor activities within the cell. Myosins contain three domains.
The head domain binds actin and hydrolyzes ATP to generate movement, the neck domain can bend
to accommodate the movement of the molecules, and the tail domain can bind other molecules for
transport. Actin and myosin are highly involved in cell motility, organelle and vesicular transport,
and muscle contraction as they are the main components of the sarcomere in muscles. A specialized
function of an actin and myosin compound is the contractile ring formed during telophase of cell
division, during which actin and myosin line up in the middle of the cell to push the two daughter cells
apart.
Intermediate Filaments
Several intermediate filaments are found within cells, with sizes around 10 nm in diameter. Some
examples of intermediate filaments include keratin, vimentin, desmin, and lamin. Keratin is formed
from monomers that combine into bundles, giving it an impermeable quality. Due to its toughness, it
functions to protect epithelial cells from damage, with one of its main locations in the body being the
outer layer of skin. Vimentin is also formed from monomers that interact to form a helical structure.
This filament attaches to several organelles in the cell to anchor them into position. It also has a highly
flexible nature, which suggests that it is responsible for cellular integrity and shape. Like the other
intermediate filaments, desmin has a helical structure that allows it to interact with other molecules.
However, desmin is typically not found in all cell types, instead being localized to cells that make up
smooth, skeletal, and cardiac muscle. Therefore, it plays a role in muscle contraction. As discussed
previously, lamin is found on the inner surface of the inner nuclear envelope and makes up the fibrous
lamina in the nucleus. It is also a helical filament that is involved in nuclear pore formation and
ensuring proper disassembling and reassembling of the nuclear envelope during and after mitosis.
Lamins are also a target during apoptosis.

Microtubules
The final type of filament that makes up the cytoskeleton is the microtubule. Around 25 nm in
diameter, it is composed of an α and β heterodimer of tubulin that align in rows called protofilaments.
Each tubulin dimer normally has bound to it one nonexchangeable molecule of GDP and one
exchangeable molecule of GTP. In addition, each dimer has binding sites for the drugs colchicine (used
in the treatment of gout) and vinblastine (used in cancer chemotherapy). The microtubule makes up
different structures depending on the number and organization of protofilaments. For example, central
pair and 9 outer doublet microtubules are the main structural units (axoneme) of flagella and cilia.
They also interact with the ATPase dynein and ATP resulting in transduction of chemical energy and
the sliding of outer doublets relative to each other. This results in the bending movements of the
organelles. In many asymmetrical cells, microtubules are positioned in a way that stiffens or supports
the cytoplasm, e.g., long spike-like pseudopods of some protozoa; axons and dendrites of nerve cells;
elongating embryonic cells. Microtubules are also involved in the mitotic apparatus during cell division
and the directed transport of organelles and molecules along a nerve cell axon (axoplasmic flow). The
centriole is a nonmembrane organelle which exists in pairs in each cell. Each centriole measures 0.15
x 3-5 μm and is a hollow cylinder closed at one end. The walls of the cylinder are composed of nine
sets of triplet microtubules, each tubule similar in dimension to a microtubule (250 Å in diameter). The
pair of centrioles usually lie near the Golgi apparatus in resting cells, but they divide and play a role
in establishing cell polarity and the spindle during cell division (but no direct contact of spindle fibers
with centrioles).

CELL INCLUSIONS

Cell inclusions are considered various nutrients or pigments that can be found within the cell, but do
not have activity like other organelles. Examples of cell inclusions are glycogen, lipids, and pigments
such as melanin, lipofuscin, and hemosiderin.
Glycogen
Glycogen is the long-term storage unit of glucose within the cell, typically in liver and muscles. Glucose
molecules are connected by α(1-4) linkages and branched off by α(1-6) linkages to form the complex
structure of glycogen, which also aids in rapid breakdown. Glycogen can be visualized in tissue using
a periodic acid-Schiff (PAS) stain. Under an electron microscopic, two forms of glycogen exist. The
first is a single spherical 15-30 nm particle (β–particle) that stain densely with lead. The second are
aggregates of small particles (β-particles) called rosettes (α-particle).
Lipids
Lipid spheres in tissues are caused by an accumulation of triglycerides and appear as perfectly spherical
structures. Due to processing, lipids cannot be visualized in paraffin-embedded tissues; it is assumed
lipid was present when clear, spherical structures are present. On frozen tissue, lipids can be visualized
using stains such as Sudan Black or Oil Red O. The material is prominent in adipocytes (fat cells), and
may be found in any cell. The quantity varies with metabolic state.
Pigments
Numerous pigments can be observed in tissues and cells. Melanin is a brown pigment in hair and
skin and is contained in melanosomes. These are dense ellipsoidal granules (about 0.3 x 0.7 μm)
produced by specialized cells called melanocytes and are transferred to hair and skin cells to produce a
pigmentary change.
A second pigment often found in cells and tissues is lipofuscin. Lipofuscin often appears as a
brown-yellow color that can be autofluorescent and accumulates over time, giving it the name “age
pigment”. It is mainly found in the lysosomes of postmitotic cells. Accumulation of lipofuscin can
have detrimental effects on the cell by disturbing cellular processes and leading to a degradation of
cellular activity. A third pigment is hemosiderin, which is a brown pigment that contains iron. When
hemoglobin breaks down, the products are phagocytized by macrophages and accumulate within the
cell. Excessive hemosiderin accumulation may indicate an increase in hemolysis of red blood cells.

CELL DIVISION

Chromosome number, or ploidy, is an important concept in regards to cell replication and division.
Somatic cells, which are most cells in the body, are diploid, meaning that the cell doubles its
chromosome number to 4N during mitosis before dividing and the resulting daughter cells are 2N.
Germ cells (sperm and egg) are haploid, meaning that during meiosis, the chromosome number
doubles to 4N, then divides into 2N, and divides again into 1N. N is the number of chromosome types
in the animal. The stages of mitosis and meiosis will be discussed later.
Karyotype is the arrangement of chromosomes based on size and morphology and is dependent
on centromere location. The centromere is the condensed region of the chromosome that connects
two chromatids together. The microtubule spindle fibers connect to the centromere to pull apart
chromatids during cell division. Karyotypes are specific for each species and can aid in identifying
chromosomal abnormalities that may lead to disease in the animal.
Rapidly growing cells (e.g., embryonic, stem cells), dividing cells that repopulate a continuously
dying population (e.g., bone marrow and intestinal cells), and cells stimulated to divide by the
environment (e.g., liver, kidney, endocrine and exocrine cells) all go through the cell cycle and mitotic
division. The stages of the cell cycle include G1, S, G2 and M (mitosis).
The Cell Cycle
Cells in G1 (G is for “gap”) are rapidly synthesizing RNA and protein, enlarging their nuclei and
cytoplasm from the last cell division. DNA replication (synthesis) occursin the S period. The cell will
double itsDNA in an exact copy in about 7 hours. Interestingly, not all DNA is replicated at once, but
in a cell-specific sequence (to preserve ploidy, chromosome number goes from 2n to 4n, then will
be reduced to 2n again at M). A second gap (G2) takes place that is another checkpoint prior to M.
Cells with polytene chromosomes and polyploid cells (e.g. mammalian liver cells) remain in this period
indefinitely. G2 is about an hour in rapidly renewing tissues.
Mitosis, or the process of cellular division, can be divided into four distinct phases, each with specific
changing cellular structures.
Prophase is the first phase and involves breakdown of the nuclear envelope, disappearance of the
nucleus, and condensation of chromatin. Chromatin coils, supercoils, and makes loops to become
a chromosome. Separate copies of genome become visually segregated into two sister chromatids,
remaining attached to each other by a protein called cohesin at the centromere (specific DNA
sequence). As discussed previously, the inner nuclear envelope is surrounded by lamin. The lamin
degrades when it receives signaling from mitosis promoting factors. The envelope then is contained in
numerous vesicles and interacts with the ER until two new cells are formed.

Veterinary Histology

After disintegration of the nuclear envelope, the cell is in metaphase. During this phase the
completely condensed chromosomes (each pair of sister chromatids) align themselves in a plane
normal to a line joining the two pairs of centrioles. This plane is called metaphase plate. Some
microtubules of spindle are inserted to the kinetochore (the disk-like protein attached to the
centromere of chromosomes), others (continuous fibers) stretch from pole to pole, avoiding the
chromosomes. Still a third class of microtubules, which originate at the centrioles, radiate away
from the metaphase plate and the chromosomes, forming the aster. Note that the homologous
chromosomes act independently in mitosis. Each is doubled into two sister chromatids, each will divide
and be represented in the daughter cells.
Eventually, each chromatid is separated from its sister during anaphase. The centromeres holding
the sister chromatids split in half, and each chromatid, now called a daughter chromosome moves in
opposite directions to the asters. The splitting to the entire genetic message into two equal halves has
been accomplished (karyokinesis: the dividing of the nucleus).
The process of uncoiling all chromosomes and reforming nuclear envelopes comprises the final
stage, telophase. At this time, the nucleoli reform and the cytoplasm divides (cytokinesis), aided
by a sub-plasma membrane purse-string of actin and myosin filaments, the contractile ring (creates
cleavage furrow). Once two distinct cells are formed, the nuclear envelope reassembles. Membrane
from the ER is used to form the envelope, with scaffolding from lamin forming the inner fibrous layer.
The chromosomes in the resulting cells tend to be identical to the cell from which they originated.
Meiosis
Conversely, meiosis is a process designed to result in genetic variation. This variation occurs through
either homologous recombination or random segregation of the chromatin. Meiosis is the process in
which germ cells (sperm and egg) are formed. Therefore, having genetically distinct cells compared to
the parent cell ensures that there will be genetic diversity in offspring. Also, germ cells have N number
of chromosomes due to the second cell division that occurs during meiosis. When the sperm fertilizes
the egg, the resulting cells in the offspring will have 2N number of chromosomes.
During meiosis, the ploidy is reduced from diploid (2n) to haploid (1n) in production of eggs
and sperm. With the successful union of egg and sperm, the normal diploid (2n) complement of
chromosomes is restored. To achieve this reduction in ploidy, the chromosome number is first doubled,
as in mitosis, but then divided twice, so that there are four haploid daughter gametes from one diploid
parent cell. Meiotic prophase is complex. What is important is that the homologous chromosomes do
not act independently, but pair together (synapsis) in complex patterns. The sites in pairing between
two homologous chromosomes is called synaptonemal complexes. In addition, chiasma (specific points
where two duplicated homologous – maternal and paternal – chromosomes are physically connected)
can form in two chromatids, one from each of the homologous chromosomes, where actual exchange
of chromosome segment takes place. These structures allow recombination and crossing over to occur,
the exchange and mixing of genetic information between maternal and paternal genes.
Metaphase I and Anaphase I proceed as in mitosis except that the homologous chromosomes pair
on the metaphase plate. Anaphase I separates the homologous chromosomes, each one composed of a
pair of sister chromatids. Random segregation of homologous chromosomes to two daughter cells has a
chance of creating 2N variations. So at the end of Anaphase I, the maternal and paternal chromosomes
are now spatially separated, except for those genes mixed during crossover. There is a brief interphase

here, but no new DNA is replicated. Each daughter cell now undergoes a second division, a Metaphase
II and Anaphase II. At this time each bivalent splits into two sister chromatids, which separate as in
mitosis. None of daughter cells have identical sets of chromosomes.

OVERVIEW

All epithelial tissue rests on a basement membrane. The basement membrane acts as a substrate
on which epithelium can attach to as well as grow and regenerate after injuries. Epithelial tissues
have a nerve supply, but they do not have a blood supply. Therefore, epithelia must be nourished by
substances diffusing from vascular structures in the underlying tissue.
The primary functions of epithelial tissues are:
1. To protect the tissues that lie beneath it from injury such as desiccation, invasion by
pathogens, and physical trauma
2. The regulation and exchange of molecules between the underlying tissues another
compartment
3. The secretion of hormones into the blood vascular system, and/or the secretion of sweat,
mucus, enzymes, and other products that are delivered by ducts
Epithelium lines both the outside (skin) and the inside cavities and lumina of bodies. For instance, the
uppermost layer of skin is composed of dead stratified squamous, keratinized epithelial cells while the
outer lining of many organs is comprised of mesothelium.
The type of epithelium that is present in an organ system depends on the function of the system.
Surfaces that require a water resistant surface and protection from abrasion often are composed of
keratinized stratified squamous epithelium (skin) or nonkeratinized stratified squamous epithelium
(oral cavity, esophagus,rectum). Other surfaces that separate body cavities within the body are lined
by simple squamous, columnar, or pseudostratified epithelial cells. Some types of epithelium can
form solid masses of tissue or the majority of an organ. Hepatocytes comprise a majority of the
hepatic parenchyma and are considered epithelial cells. Endothelium (the inner cell lining of vascular
structures) is a specialized form of epithelium. Another type of specialized epithelium, mesothelium,
forms the outside surface layer of the pericardium, pleura, and peritoneum. Some epithelial cells are
organized into secretory structures at different locations in an animal’s body known as glands.
All epithelial cells types share the following characteristics:
1. Close apposition of cells.
2. Free surface of epithelial cells is adjacent to the space.
3. Basal surface is adjacent to connective tissue.
4. Sheets of epithelial cells may be modified into tubes forming glands.
5. Absence of blood vessels within epithelial layer

MORPHOLOGICAL CLASSIFICATION OF
EPITHELIA

Epithelium is further characterized by several physical features. These include :
1. The number of layers of cells: an epithelium with only one layer is referred to as simple.
When there are more than one layer, the epithelium is referred to as stratified. A confusing
exception to this is pseudostratified epithelium which appears to be more than one cell thick
since the nuclei lie at different heights within the cell, but all cells are in contact with the
basement membrane.
2. Shape of cells at free surface: Shapes of epithelial cells include squamous (flattened),
cuboidal and columnar.
3. Function of the epithelium
4. Surface modifications (if present): Surface modifications include cilia and microvilli. Their
presence often depend on the requirements of the tissue location where the epithelial cell
resides.

CLASSIFICATION BY NUMBER OF LAYERS OF
CELLS

Simple epithelium
Simple epithelium is a single layer of cells with every cell in direct contact with the basement
membrane. It can serve many functions, including absorption, filtration and protection. The thinness
of the epithelial barrier facilitates easy movement of molecules across into another compartment.
In general, simple epithelial tissues are classified by the shape of their cells. The four major classes
of simple epithelium are as follows:
1. Simple squamous: this type is found in lining areas where passive diffusion of gases occur,
such as walls of capillaries and alveoli of the lungs. Endothelium is the special term used for
simple squamous epithelium that lines the inside surface of a vascular structure.
2. Simple cuboidal: these cells may have secretory, absorptive, or excretory functions. This
type of epithelium can be seen in the tubules of kidney, and the secretory ducts of the
pancreas and salivary gland.
3. Simple columnar: found in areas with extremely high secretory activity (as in the inside
lining of the stomach), or absorptive activity (as in small intestine). This type of epithelium
often possess apical modifications such as the microvilli in the small intestine, or cilia found
in some areas of the female reproductive tract).
4. Pseudostratified epithelium: this type of epithelium is almost exclusively located in the
larger respiratory airways of the nasal cavity, trachea and bronchi. For this reason, it is often
also called respiratory epithelium.

28

Stratified epithelium
Stratified epithelium differs from simple epithelium in that it is multilayered. It is therefore found
where body linings have to withstand mechanical or chemical insult such that layers can be abraded
and lost without exposing subepithelial layers.

CLASSIFICATION BY SHAPE OF THE CELLS AT
THE FREE SURFACE

The three principal shapes associated with epithelial cells are—squamous, cuboidal and columnar.
• Squamous epithelium is composed of cells that are wider than their height (flat and wide).
• Cuboidal epithelium is composed of cells whose height and width are approximately the
same (cube shaped).
• Columnar epithelium is composed of cells taller than they are wide.
By layer, epithelium is classed as either simple epithelium (one cell thick) or stratified epithelium
(two or more cells thick), and both can be made up of any of the cell shapes. When epithelium is
stratified, it is classified by the shape of the cells at the top or uppermost layer. A notable exception is
pseudostratified epithelium. In this type of epithelium, taller simple columnar epithelial cells appear
to have several nuclei at different heights, giving the appearance of stratification. However, in this type
of epithelium, all the cells are attached to the basement membrane.
Urothelium (formerly called transitional epithelium) is another type of unique epithelium in which
cells can change from squamous to cuboidal, depending on the amount of tension on the epithelium.

→ FIGURE(S): Epithelium Classification by Shape of the Cells at the Free Surface

CLASSIFICATION BY FUNCTION OF EPITHELIUM

Epithelium can have two functions. They can act as a lining (lining epithelia) and/or form secretory
structures (glandular epithelium).
Lining Epithelia covers the free surfaces of the body (internal and external) and cavities. Examples
of this include epidermis, lining of the gastrointestinal tract and ducts. Their position in contact with
the environment gives them great importance in regulating the composition of the body by controlling
the movement of materials in and out. Tissues that line the inside of the mouth, the esophagus and
part of the rectum are composed of nonkeratinized stratified squamous epithelium. Other surfaces
that separate body cavities from the outside environment are lined by simple squamous, columnar, or
pseudostratified epithelial cells. Other epithelial cells line the insides of the lungs, the gastrointestinal
tract, the reproductive and urinary tracts, and make up the exocrine and endocrine glands. The outer
surface of the cornea is covered with fast-growing, easily regenerated epithelial cells. Endothelium (the
inner lining of blood vessels, the heart, and lymphatic vessels) is a specialized form of epithelium.
Another type, mesothelium, forms the walls of the pericardium, pleurae, and peritoneum.
Glandular epithelium is an invagination or aggregation of epithelium that forms a solid tissue
structure. Glandular tissue is formed from glandular epithelium that forms structures from the
infolding of epithelium and subsequent growth in the underlying connective tissue. Glands can be
broadly classified into two types : endocrine and exocrine. Endocrine glands secrete their product into
the extracellular space where it is rapidly taken up by the blood vascular system. Exocrine glands
secrete their products into a duct that then delivers the product to the lumen of an organ or onto
the free surface of the epithelium. Exocrine glands are further characterized by the method in which
they secrete product. Merocrine secretion involves the exocytosis of secretory vesicles to the lumen of
the gland. Holocrine secretion involves the death of an entire cell within a gland which subsequently
sloughs off and releases content into the lumen of the gland. Apocrine secretion involves the release
of budding vesicles off the epithelial cells into the lumen of the gland

MODIFICATIONS TO EPITHELIUM

Microvilli
Microvilli are cell surface modifications which increase surface area of a cell without significantly
increasing the size of the cell. Microvilli are often seen in organs where the epithelium plays a primary
role in the absorption of molecules.
Cilia
Cilia are projections and a type of organelle seen on the apical surface of epithelial cells. In many
locations, they beat in a coordinated fashion. This assists in the movement of material over the
epithelial surface in a manner parallel with the surface of the epithelium.
Cellular Connections
Cell connections or junctions are especially abundant in epithelial tissues. These structures consist
of protein complexes and induce connectivity between adjacent epithelial cells, between a cell and
the extracellular matrix. They can contribute to the barrier function of epithelia and control the
paracellular transport.
Cell junctions are the contact points between plasma membrane and tissue cells. Some examples of
the major types of cell junctions: tight junctions, gap junctions, desmosomes and hemidesmosomes.
Tight junctions are transmembrane proteins fused on outer plasma membrane. Gap junctions connect
the cytoplasm of two cells and allow for the passage of molecules freely between cells.
Desmosomes and hemidesmosomes allow for strong attachment between cells or to a basement
membrane. Desmosomes attach to the microfilaments of cytoskeleton made up of keratin protein.
Hemidesmosomes are similar to desmosomes in terms of function, however, they attach the epithelial
cell to the basement membrane rather than to an adjacent cell.

OVERVIEW

Connective tissue is a term used to describe the tissue of mesodermal origin that that forms a matrix
beneath the epithelial layer and is a connecting or supporting framework for most of the organs of the
body.
In contrast to epithelia, connective tissue is sparsely populated by cells and contains an extensive
extracellular matrix consisting of protein fibers, glycoproteins, and proteoglycans. The function of
this type of tissue is to provide structural and mechanical support for other tissues, and to mediate
the exchange of nutrients and waste between the circulation and other tissues. These tissues have
two principal components, an extracellular matrix and a variety of support cells. Extracellular matrix
is comprised of two non-cellular biological materials, the fiber component and ground substance. In
addition, there is a cellular component to connective tissue that is comprised of the cells that produce
and maintain the extracellular matrix and that cells that migrate from the associated vasculature to
reside in the extracellular matrix.

THE FIBER COMPONENT

The different types of connective tissues are specified by the relative content of three distinguishing
types of extracellular fibers: collagenous fibers, elastic fibers, and reticular fibers.
Collagenous Fibers
The molecules of collagen fibers are oriented to form a lattice in many regions. However in some
tissues (tendon, ligaments), the fibers are oriented in dense parallel arrays to provide strength in one
direction. These fibers are inelastic, but have great tensile strength. Thus they can be bent without
breaking.
While the fibers themselves do not stretch, their lattice-like arrangement can allow tissues
containing the fibers to stretch to some extent. Thus, collagen fibers impart both strength and
flexibility to tissue.
Collagen is synthesized from the aggregation of precursor molecules, primarily procollagen.
Collagen molecules aggregate to larger chains of molecules called fibrils. Fibrils are further organized
to create fibers which are visible on light microscopy. Fibers often organized in parallel array forming
a bundle.
There are 5 generally accepted types of collagen:
• Type I: most common, found in every connective tissue.
• Type II: found in hyaline and elastic cartilage and in vitreous body of eye.
• Type III: found in reticular fibers, healing wounds, smooth muscle, and fetal skin.
• Type IV: found in basal laminae of epithelia
• Type V: found in placental basal laminae, tendon, and muscle sheaths.
Elastic Fibers
Elastic fibers are composed primarily of the protein elastin. These fibers are often organized into
lamellar (parallel) sheets, as in the walls of arteries. Dense, regular, elastic tissue is an important
component in many ligaments and tendons.
Elastic fibers are stretchable because they are normally disorganized – stretching these fibers makes
them take on an organized structure.

37

Ryan Jennings and Christopher Premanandan

Reticular Fibers
Reticular fibers are composed of type III collagen. Unlike the thick and coarse collagenous fibers,
reticular fibers form a thin reticular network. Such networks are widespread among different tissues
and form supporting frameworks in the liver, lymphoid organs, capillary endothelia, and muscle fibers.

GROUND SUBSTANCE

The ground substance is an aqueous gel of glycoproteins and proteoglycans that occupies the space
between cellular and fiber elements of the connective tissue. It is characterized by a gel-like
consistency. The characteristics of the ground substance determine the permeability of the connective
tissue layer to solutes and proteins.

THE CELLULAR COMPONENT

Fibroblasts
Fibroblasts are by far the most common native cell type of connective tissue. The fibroblast synthesizes
the collagen and ground substance of the extracellular matrix. These cells make a large amount of
protein that they secrete to build the connective tissue layer.
Sometimes the term fibrocyte is used to distinguish a small mature cell from a larger metabolically
active fibroblast; however, in general convention, the term fibroblast is more common.
Macrophage
The macrophage is the connective tissue representative of the reticuloendothelial, or mononuclear
phagocyte, system. This system consists of a number of tissue-specific, mobile, phagocytic cells that
descend from monocytes. These include the Kupffer cells of the liver, the alveolar macrophages of the
lung, the microglia of the central nervous system. The macrophage is the connective tissue version.
Macrophages phagocytose foreign material in the connective tissue layer and also play an important
role as antigen presenting cells.
Other Leukocytes
Other leukocytes are frequently present in small numbers in normal connective tissue. Lymphocytes
represent an adaptive immune response in tissue. These cells typically have a small amount of
cytoplasm, are round and have round nuclei. It cannot be determined from routine hematoxylin and
eosin staining as to whether the cells are B lymphocytes or T lymphocytes.
Neutrophils can rarely been seen in connective tissue and are more commonly observed in
inflammatory states. Neutrophils look slightly different on histology than on cytology. Unlike in a
cytologic preparation, the segmentations of the nuclei are difficult to see and the nucleus frequently
appear as joined hyperchromatic round structures in the cytoplasm.
Mast Cells
Mast cells are granulated cells typically found in connective tissue. These cells mediate immune
responses to foreign particles. In particular, they release large amounts of histamine and enzymes
in response to antigen recognition. This degranulation process is protective when foreign organisms
invade the body, but is also the cause of many allergic reactions.

Veterinary Histology

40

White Adipose Cells
White adipose (fat) cells are specialized for the storage of triglyceride, and occur singly or in small
groups scattered throughout the loose connective tissue. When fat cells have accumulated in such
abundance that they crowd out or replace cellular and fibrous elements, the accumulation is termed
adipose tissue.
These cells usually contain one centrally located vacuole of lipid. The cytoplasm forms a circular ring
around this vacuole and is rarely visible. The nuclei of these cells are compressed and displaced to the
side. The function of white fat is to serve as an energy source and thermal insulator.
Brown Adipose Cells
Brown adipose cells are highly specialized for temperature regulation. These cells are abundant in
newborns and hibernating mammals, but are typically rare in adults. Some species, such as the mouse,
have abundant brown adipose stores as adults.
They have numerous, smaller lipid droplets and a large number of mitochondria, whose cytochromes
impart the brown color of the tissue.

→ FIGURE(S): The Cellular Component of Connective Tissues

ORGANIZATION OF CONNECTIVE TISSUE

Fibrous connective tissue can be organized into four forms. The organization of the connective tissue
depends on the physical characteristics of tissue. Loose irregular connective tissue is composed of
haphazardly arranged loosely compacted collagen bundles. Dense irregular connective tissue is
composed of haphazardly arranged densely packed collagen bundles. Both these types of arrangements
are seen in tissues that require the tensile resistance of forces in many different directions. The dermis
of the integumentary system is a good example of this but it can be seen in many different locations
throughout the body. Dense regular connective tissue is composed of tightly bundled collagen fibers
running in one direction. This type of connective tissue provides excellent tensile strength in one
direction. Tendons and ligaments are composed of dense regular connective tissue and are critical
in maintaining musculoskeletal structure under the repeated strain of movement. The fourth
arrangement of connective tissue is known as embryonic connective tissue and, as the name suggests,
is only located in embryonic tissue. This is a very fragile connective tissue composed of thin strands of
collagen fibers that contains a large amount of interstitial water content. The fibroblasts in this type
of connective tissue frequently has a stellate appearance, meaning that instead of a spindle shape with
two pointed ends, the cells may have three pointed projections of cell membrane.

CARTILAGE

Cartilage is a specialized form of connective tissue produced by differentiated fibroblast-like cells
called chondrocytes. It is characterized by a prominent extracellular matrix consisting of various
proportions of connective tissue fibers embedded in a gel-like matrix.
Chondrocytes are cells unique to cartilage and are located within lacunae (holes) in the matrix that
they have built around themselves. Lacunae become separated from one another as a result of the
secretory activity of the chondrocytes.
Three kinds of cartilage are classified according to the abundance of certain fibers and the
characteristics of their matrix:
• Hyaline cartilage has a matrix composed of type II collagen and chondromucoprotein, a
copolymer of chondroitin sulfates A and C with protein. Its high concentration of negativelycharged sulfate groups makes it appear intensely basophilic under H&E staining. This type
of cartilage makes up the articular surface in joints.
• Fibrocartilage is distinguished by its high content and orderly arrangement of type I
collagen fibers. It is typically located in regions where tendons attach to bones, the
intervertebral discs, and the symphysis between certain bones.
• Elastic cartilage is characterized by the presence of abundant elastic fibers and is quite
cellular. It is made up of type II collagen and is located in the pinna of the ear, the turbinates
of the nose and the epiglottis.

OVERVIEW

Muscle is one of the four primary tissue types. There are three types of muscle tissue: skeletal muscle,
cardiac muscle, and smooth muscle. The three muscle types have some properties in common. They
all exhibit excitability as their plasma membranes change their electrical states (depolarization) and
send an electrical signal in a wave-like pattern called an action potential along the entire length of the
skeletal muscle cell membrane. Skeletal muscle depends on the nervous system to work properly. This
is referred to as voluntary motion. In contrast, the nervous system influences the activity of cardiac
and smooth muscle to a lesser degree. On the other hand, both cardiac muscle and smooth muscle can
respond to other stimuli, such as catecholamines (epinephrine and norepinephrine) from the blood,
hormones and local stimuli.
Myoepithelium and myofibroblasts are specialized types of epithelium and fibroblasts, respectively,
that have contractile ability. Myoepithelial cells are often located in and around glands where
extracellular product produced by the epithelial cells needs to be moved by contractile action towards
the duct system. Myofibroblasts are often seen in healing wounds and assist in maturation and
contraction of the granulation tissue (immature fibrous connective tissue) as it matures and contracts.

SKELETAL MUSCLE

Function
One of the most important functions of skeletal muscle is to contract and cause movement. Skeletal
muscles act not only to produce movement but also to stop movement. Constant small contractions
of the skeletal muscle are needed to hold a body upright in any position, even at rest. Muscles
also prevent excess movement of the bones and joints, maintaining skeletal stability and preventing
skeletal structure damage or deformation. Skeletal muscle is located throughout the body at the
openings of internal tracts to control the movement of various substances. This muscle allow voluntary
control of specific functions, such as swallowing, urination, and defecation. Skeletal muscles also
protect internal organs (particularly the abdominal organs) by acting as an external barrier or shield to
external trauma and by supporting the weight of the organs.
Skeletal muscles contribute to the generation of heat, primarily by shivering or intense bursts of
movement. Muscle contraction requires energy, and when ATP is broken down, heat is produced.
This heat is very noticeable during and following intense active movement such as running. In this
case, sustained muscle movement causes body temperature to rise. Similarly, when environmental
temperatures are low, random skeletal muscle around the appendicular skeletal produces random
skeletal muscle contractions to generate heat (shivering).
Structure
Each skeletal muscle is an organ that consists of various integrated tissues. These tissues include the
skeletal muscle fibers, blood vessels, nerve fibers, and connective tissue. Each skeletal muscle has three
levels of connective tissue that enclose it. These levels of connective tissue provide structure to the
muscle as a whole, and also compartmentalize the muscle fibers within the muscle in to groups. Each
large muscle is wrapped in a sheath of dense, irregular connective tissue called the epimysium, that
holds muscle fascicles in a group and also allows a muscle to contract while maintaining its structural
integrity. This is the outermost layer. The epimysium also allows the muscle to move independently
from other muscle groups and other types of tissue. Most individual muscles that you learn in gross
anatomy are surrounded by epimysium.
Muscle fiber is a term synonymous with muscle cell. The muscle fiber is a cell with multiple
peripherally located nuclei that runs the ENTIRE length of the actual muscle. Inside each skeletal
muscle, muscle fibers are organized into individual bundles (called fascicles), by intermediate layer
of connective tissue called the perimysium. Inside each fascicle, each muscle fiber is encased in an
extremely thin connective tissue layer called the endomysium.
Some terminology associated with muscle fibers are rooted in the Greek sarco, which means “flesh.”

Ryan Jennings and Christopher Premanandan

The plasma membrane of muscle fibers is called the sarcolemma, the cytoplasm is referred to as
sarcoplasm, and the specialized smooth endoplasmic reticulum that stores and controls the release
of calcium ions (Ca++) is called the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR). The functional unit of a skeletal
muscle fiber is the sarcomere, a highly organized arrangement of the contractile myofilaments actin
(thin filament) and myosin (thick filament), along with other support proteins. Individual sarcomeres
are joined together in a long chain called a myofibril and attaches to the sarcolemma at its end.
Myofibrils are bundled together within the sarcoplasm. In addition, there are invaginations of the
sarcolemma into the sarcoplasm that surround the myofibrils. These are referred to as t-tubules. The
t-tubules system conveys the action potential from the sarcolemma into the cell in order stimulate the
myofibrils.
Distinct lines or bands in the sarcomere are apparent where the myosin and actin filaments overlap
as well as where the sarcomere connect to each other consecutively. This is what gives skeletal muscle
its striated appearance on histology. In fact, skeletal muscle and cardiac muscle (because cardiac
muscle also has sarcomeres) are also known as striated muscle. As the sarcomeres and thus, the
myofibrils contract, the entire muscle cell contracts. Because the actin and its troponin-tropomyosin
complex (projecting from the Z-discs toward the center of the sarcomere) form strands that are thinner
than the myosin, together it is called the thin filament of the sarcomere. Because the myosin strands
and their multiple heads (projecting from the center of the sarcomere, toward but not all to way
to, the Z-discs) have more mass and are thicker, they are called the thick filaments. As mention
before, in order for a sarcomere to contract, calcium released from the sarcoplasmic reticulum after a
stimulatory action potential from the T-tubules is generated. Calcium interacts with molecules on the
actin filaments, troponin and tropomyosin, which normally block myosin binding sites on actin. ATP
binding to myosin causes release of the myosin head from actin.
Contraction
Contraction of the sarcomere involves several steps. In order to understand these step, you must
understand that myosin head has several important characteristics.
• It has ATP-binding sites into which fit molecules of ATP. ATP represents potential energy.
• It has actin-binding sites into which fit molecules of actin.
• It has a “hinge” at the point where it leaves the core of the thick myofilament. This allows
the head to swing back and forth, and this motion is what causes muscle contraction.
During contraction the following steps occur:
1. The activated myosin head attaches to the actin binding site; contraction refers to the
activation of myosin’s cross bridges – the sites that generate the force
2. The phosphate group, P, on the myosin head falls off
3. The myosin head then produces a power stroke which results in the sliding of the filaments
forcing the thin filaments to move towards each other. The ADP on the myosin also falls off.
4. Once the power stroke is complete, ATP again attaches to the myosin head causing the head
to detach from the actin site and return to its original position.

5. ATP attached to the myosin head is split by ATPase causing the myosin heads to be activated
again; the cycle can then be repeated over and over again as long as calcium and ATP are
present. Multiple cycles of this process are often necessary for full muscle contraction.

CARDIAC MUSCLE

Cardiac muscle tissue is only found in the heart, specifically the myocardium. Highly coordinated
contractions of cardiac muscle pump blood into the vessels of the circulatory system such as the
aorta and pulmonary artery. Cardiac muscle is striated and organized into sarcomeres, possessing the
same organization of myofilaments as skeletal muscle. However, cardiac muscle fibers are shorter than
skeletal muscle fibers and usually contain only one nucleus, which is located in the central region of
the cell. Cardiac muscle fibers also contain many mitochondria. This is necessary as large amounts of
ATP are required by the cells and this is produced primarily through aerobic metabolism.
Cardiac muscle fibers cells also are extensively branched and are connected to one another at
their ends by intercalated discs. An intercalated disc allows the cardiac muscle cells to contract
in a coordinated fashion so that the heart can work as a pump. Intercalated discs are part of the
sarcolemma and contain two structures important in cardiac muscle contraction: gap junctions and
desmosomes. Gap junction form channels between adjacent cardiac muscle fibers that allow the
depolarizing action potential to move between one cardiac muscle cell to the next. It allows the quick
transmission of action potentials and the coordinated contraction of the entire heart. The remainder
of the intercalated disc is composed of desmosomes that were discussed in the epithelium chapter.
Desmosomes anchor the ends of cardiac muscle fibers together so the cells do not pull apart during
individual fiber contraction.

SMOOTH MUSCLE

Smooth muscle (named as such because the cells do not have striations) is present in the walls of
organs that contain a lumen like the urinary bladder, uterus, stomach, intestines, and in the walls
of large vascular tubes, such as the arteries and veins of the circulatory system. The tracts of the
respiratory, urinary, and reproductive systems contain smooth muscle. Smooth muscle is also present
in the eye, where it functions to change the size of the pupil and in the skin where it causes hair to
stand erect in response to low temperatures or fear. Smooth muscle is referred to as an involuntary
muscle since is not under voluntary control. In certain locations, such as the walls of visceral organs,
stretching the muscle can trigger its contraction (the stretch-relaxation response).
Smooth muscle contraction relies on the presence of Ca++ ions similar to skeletal and cardiac
muscle. However, smooth muscle fibers are much smaller in all dimensions than skeletal muscle cells.
T-tubules are not required to reach the interior of the cell and therefore not necessary to transmit an
action potential deep into the fiber. Smooth muscle fibers have a limited calcium-storing sarcoplasmic
reticulum but have calcium channels in the sarcolemma that open during the action potential along
the sarcolemma. The influx of extracellular Ca++ ions, which diffuse into the sarcoplasm to reach a
protein called calmodulin. The calcium-calmodulin complex activates myosin light chain kinase, an
enzyme that phosphorylates myosin and allows it to bind to the actin network within the cell.
Muscle contraction continues until ATP-dependent calcium pumps actively transport Ca++ ions back
into the sarcoplasmic reticulum and out of the sarcoplasm. A small amount of calcium remains in the
sarcoplasm to maintain muscle tone and keep the cells contracted to a small degree. This is important
in certain organs and around blood vessels. Because most smooth muscles must function for long
periods without rest, their power output is relatively low, but contractions can continue without using
large amounts of energy.

OVERVIEW

Bone is a dynamic organ that functions to provide support, protection, and also act as a reservoir of
mineral salts and growth factors. The histologic structure of bone is highly specialized to perform these
functions.

BONE MICROANATOMY

Bone is primarily composed of extracellular matrix, with organic and inorganic components. The
organic component is largely Type I collagen and ground substance (collectively this is called osteoid).
Non collagenous proteins that contribute to osteoid include growth factors, ‘glues’, and proteins that
help to initiate mineralization. The inorganic matrix is calcium hydroxyapatite (this also contains
phosphorus), which adds rigidity. Due to this rigidity, bone can only undergo appositional growth
(layers on top of each other), not interstitial growth (growth from within the matrix). Routine
histologic sections of bone are generally demineralized, and mineral content becomes impossible to
evaluate.
The arrangement of collagen fibers in bone can be visualized under a polarizing microscope. Where
fibers are arranged into dense parallel arrays, the bone is referred to as ‘lamellar’. All normal bone
in an adult animal is lamellar. In the cortex, there are outer (periosteal) circumferential lamellae and
inner (endosteal) lamellae. Rapidly deposited osteoid (such as occurs during growth and injury) has
randomly arranged collagen fibers and is referred to as ‘woven’.
Osteoblasts are mesenchymal cells that contribute to bone production in two phases. First, they
synthesize and secrete a layer of organic materials (primarily tropocollagen) called the osteoid seam.
Secondly, osteoblasts contribute to mineralization of the osteoid seam (at which point the matrix
becomes bone). Osteoblasts are plump, angular cells that can be seen lining bone surfaces. With time,
osteoblasts become embedded within bone and become osteocytes.
Osteocytes are smaller and elongate, and are contained within small cavities called lacunae. They
have long cytoplasmic process that run within canaliculi, connecting to other osteocytes (these cell
processes are very hard to identify in routine histologic sections). Changes in interstitial fluid
movement and electric potential (piezoelectric forces) can be detected by the osteocytes, which can
then transmit a signal to osteoblasts. By this mechanism, osteocytes play an important role in
detecting local changes in the microenvironment (stress, microfractures, micronutrients) and coordinating adaptive responses. Osteocytes may also play a role in day to day calcium homeostasis by
‘fine-tuning’ the amount of calcium that is released/removed from the circulating calcium pool.
In a section of long bone, bone can anatomically be divided into compact bone and trabecular (also
called cancellous or spongy) bone. Compact bone is the dense bone that forms the cortex. Trabecular
bone forms multi-directional, anastomosing struts within the marrow cavity, and are interspersed
by adipose and hematopoietic tissue. The arrangement of trabecular bone generally reflects loading
patterns on the bone. Covering bone surfaces, there are two distinct envelopes: the periosteum and
endosteum. The periosteum covers the outermost aspect of the cortex. There are two layers of the
periosteum, the outer (fibrous) layer and the inner osteogenic (cambium) layer. In a normal adult bone,
the osteogenic layer may not be identifiable. The osteogenic layer of the periosteum is easily identified

59

Ryan Jennings and Christopher Premanandan

and ‘active’ during periods of growth and following injury. The endosteum lines the innermost margin
of the cortex, bone trabeculae, and osteonal canals.
Osteoclasts are hematopoietic derived, multinucleated cells that resorb bone. Physiologic stimuli
that induce osteoclastic resorption generally operate through the osteoblast (the osteoblast secretes
a molecule called ODF that binds RANK on osteoclasts, causing osteoclast activation). The osteoblast
initially releases collagenases that resorb the non-mineralized lamina limitans. The peripheral margin
of the osteoclast can then bind to the exposed mineralized bone, forming a tight seal. Carbonic acid
secreted across a brush border of the osteoclast resorbs the mineral and the matrix is dissolved by
secreted proteinases. A Howship’s lacuna is the scalloped cavity left after an osteoclast resorbs a
segment of bone.
Osteons are the functional unit of bone. They can be compared to reinforcing rods embedded in
concrete. An osteon is a long, cylindrical structure with a central osteonal canal (also called Haversian
canal) containing nerves, blood vessels and osteogenic cells. This central canal is surrounded by
densely arranged concentric lamellae of bone, that are approximately 2-3μm apart. Primary osteons
initially form at the periosteal surface. Secondary osteons form after primary osteons. To form,
secondary osteons must have a pre-existing tunnel allowing osteoclasts to enlarge the tunnel.
Osteoblasts then lay down bone in a centripetal direction, thus forming a secondary osteon. The
reversal line marks the point at which osteoclasis stops and osteogenesis begins. Interstitial bone
can be seen between osteons, and represents remnants of primary/secondary osteons and the
circumferential lamellae.

BONE FUNCTION

The different constituents of bone function together as a unit, to facilitate normal growth, adapt to
changing stress, repair microinjury, regulate mineral homeostasis, and respond to injury.
Changes in bone size and shape are called modeling. Modeling is the way in which bone responds
to loading. It is exemplified by normal growth, as the developing bone shapes to a contour that
allows it to withstand loading. Bone will also model during periods of abnormal use. The modeling
process occurs by Wolff’s Law, which states that bone shape and orientation will adapt to use. The
response is formation at sites of compression and resorption at sites of tension. When modeling occurs
slowly, the deposited bone is lamellar; where modeling occurs rapidly the deposited bone is woven.
Modeling differs remodeling as bone can directly begin forming or resorbing (not the same activationresorption-formation sequence as outlined below).
During remodeling, bone is removed from one area and replaced in another. Remodeling plays a
crucial role in normal cortical growth, as woven bone is replaced by osteonal bone. This process is
also important in repairing ‘wear and tear’ (microcracks), and replacing old bone with new bone. The
sequence of remodeling is always the same: activation, osteoclastic resorption, reversal, formation.
Collectively, osteoblasts and osteoclasts combine to form the ‘basic metabolic unit’ of bone. Activation
begins as osteoblasts are stimulated to contract and remove the lamina limitans (activation factors
include PTH and others). Reversal is the inhibition of resorption and initiation of formation. During
formation, the space left by osteoclasts becomes filled by osteoid deposited by osteoblasts. An osteonal
remodeling unit is constantly changing. The osteon has a central cavity shaped like an ice-cream
cone with osteoclasts at the top leading edge (called the ‘cutting cone’). Further away from the top,
the cavity left by the cutting cone becomes progressively filled by new bone deposited in concentric
lamellae (giving the remodeling unit a coned appearance in longitudinal section). There are
progressively more centripetal lamellae as sections are further from the site of osteoclastic resorption.
When osteoclastic activity ceases, the top of the remodeling unit becomes filled and becomes a mature
secondary osteon.

BONE GROWTH

Bone can grow by two mechanisms: membranous ossification and endochondral ossification.
Membranous ossification occurs primarily in flat bones (ie. bones of the skull, mandible), while
endochondral ossification is seen in long bones (ie. appendicular skeleton).
Membranous ossification
Membranous ossification begins as condensation of primitive mesenchyme, and cells differentiate into
an osteoblastic phenotype. These cells form bone directly that is laid in apposition, on top of the bone
that has just formed. Importantly, there is no cartilage intermediate. Membranous ossification is also
the way in which bones (including long bones) grow in width. It therefore contributes a significant
portion to the diaphyseal cortex of long bones.
Endochondral ossification
Endochondral ossification significantly differs from membranous ossification. A cartilage model that
becomes almost entirely replaced by bone precedes the formation of the actual bone. Increases in
bone length are primarily the result of endochondral ossification, as the cartilage model can grow
interstitially (from within the matrix). In the developing fetus, primitive mesenchyme condenses and
these cells differentiate into a chondroblastic phenotype. The chondroblastic population proliferates
to form a cartilage model that approximately mimics the final bone contour. Because this model is
initially composed entirely of cartilage (considerably less rigid than bone), the developing bone can
grow interstitially. Initially, the perichondrium that surrounds the cartilage model becomes invaded
by blood vessels, forming periosteal collar around the diaphyseal region. With this periosteum, there
are osteogenic precursors that form an bony sleeve around the primary center of ossification. This
primary center of ossification begins in the middle of a long bone as blood vessels invade into the
cartilage model. With time, vessels then invade the periphery of the bone, establishing secondary
centers of ossification. The primary and secondary centers of ossification progressively expand with
endochondral ossification occurring at the edges of an ossification center. Once the ossification centers
get to a certain point, there becomes a thin line of growing cartilage between the primary and
secondary ossification center. This is known as the physis (‘growth plate’) and its primary function is
to lengthen the bone. Endochondral ossification that occurs at the edge of a secondary ossification
center, immediately beneath an articular surface, is called the articular-epiphyseal complex (AEC).
Histologically the process of endochondral ossification is almost identical. Endochondral ossification
in any given ossification center occurs at different rates at different loci. This allows the bone to form

63

Ryan Jennings and Christopher Premanandan

its shape and spatial alignment. Once endochondral ossification finishes at the AEC, the subchondral
bone condenses to form an end plate.
The process of endochondral ossification can be seen in histologic sections of a growth plate
(physis), where multiple distinct layers can be identified. These include the zone of resting
chondrocytes, zone of proliferation, zone of hypertrophy, zone of mineralization, and zone of
ossification. Chondrocytes within the zone of proliferation and hypertrophy are arranged into linear
columns interspersed by chondroid matrix. For endochondral ossification to occur normally, three
things must happen in a very orderly fashion. These are mineralization of the cartilage matrix
surrounding the chondrocyte, death of the chondrocyte (mineralization stops transfer of nutrients
causing the cell to die), and vascular ingrowth. Vessels grow between spicules of mineralized matrix.
This process is particularly important as the new vessels bring osteogenic cells (osteoblasts) that can
then deposit osteoid on top of the mineralized cartilage. The area containing mineralized cartilage
spicules and early ossification is referred to as the primary spongiosa. In the secondary spongiosa,
the newly formed bony trabeculae become modeled into mature trabeculae that reflect tension and
compression on the bone.

CARTILAGE MICROANATOMY

Three distinct types of cartilage exist, and their location depends on the required function.
Hyaline cartilage is the most common type of cartilage in the body. It covers the surfaces of articular
joints and is the cartilage present in physes. Hyaline cartilage is primarily composed of water, present
as a viscoelastic hydrated gel, reinforced by type II collagen. Water is bound by proteoglycan, the
largest of which is a molecule called aggregin. Collagen fibers within the cartilage provide tensile
strength and contribute to shock absorption. The deepest aspect of cartilage is mineralized (the
junction between mineralized and unmineralized cartilage is the “tidemark”), which anchors cartilage
to the bone. Turnover of proteoglycan in cartilage is high and controlled by chondrocytes. This is in
contrast to collagen, which has low turnover. Adult chondrocytes have limited replicative potential.
Fibrocartilage is stronger and more robust than hyaline cartilage due to abundant collagen that is
arranged in bundles. These bundles are interspersed by islands of cartilage. This cartilage can be found
in menisci and the annulus fibrosus of intervertebral discs. Fibrocartilage is sparsely vascularized
and has limited response to injury. Elastic cartilage is similar to hyaline cartilage but contains many
elastin fibers. These fibers are best demonstrated with special stains. Elastic cartilage is strong but very
flexible; elastic cartilage is best demonstrated in the pinna.
Hyaline cartilage is separated from the surrounding tissue by perichondrium. Like periosteum, it
has an outer fibrous layer and an inner cellular layer (but has chondrogenic rather than osteogenic
potential). This cellular layer is only prominent during periods of growth or injury. The perichondrium
is lost from the surface of weight-bearing articular hyaline cartilage (although a thin rim of
perichondrium is maintained around the articular edge and is continuous with the periosteum).
Perichondrium also covers the periphery of physes (‘perichondrial ring’), supporting lateral expansion
of the physis by appositional growth.
Chondroblasts are only found within the perichondrium. Morphologically, chondroblasts are small
and oval with hyperchromatic nuclei and clear space surrounding the cell (this is an artifact).
Chrondroblasts lie in small lacunae, and are often found in groups. Chondroblasts undergo
hypertrophy into chondrocytes, taking an oval shape. Chondrocytes are the most frequent cell within
hyaline cartilage. Ultrastructurally, chondrocytes have extensive cellular processes, but these are
difficult to appreciate by light microscopy. The function of chondrocytes is to produce and maintain
the surrounding chondroid matrix. Cartilage can undergo both appositional growth (cells/matrix are
deposited on top of each other from the perichondrium) and interstitial growth (growth from within
the cartilage model). Hyaline cartilage is also avascular and must be nourished by synovial fluid. This
process is facilitated during periods of heavy loading.

TENDONS AND JOINTS

Lining the innermost aspect of the joint capsule is lined by synovium. Synovium is thought to contain
three distinct cell populations: phagocytic macrophages, antigen presenting cells, and fibroblast like
cells that produce glycosaminoglycans. Synovial fluid is a filtrate of plasma enriched with
proteoglycans. The synovial membrane is normally supported by a loose fibrovascular stroma admixed
with adipose. The outermost layer, the joint capsule, is composed of dense collagen. Tendons and
ligaments look histologically similar and are also composed of very dense collagen. The collagenous
fibers in tendons insert directly into bone, and these are called ‘Sharpey’s fibers’. In doing so, the
tendon is strongly anchored to the underlying bone. Sharpey’s fibers can easily be visualized under a
polarizing microscope.

OVERVIEW

The vasculature can broadly be divided into blood and lymphatic circulations. The blood circulatory
system serves to transport oxygen and nourish tissues, remove carbon dioxide as waste products,
regulate temperature, distribute humoral factors and deliver immune cells. While blood vessels move
blood away from and towards the heart (arteries and veins, respectively), flow in lymphatics moves
only towards the heart eventually reaching the cranial vena cava by way of the thoracic duct. In both
the blood and lymphatic circulation, the anatomy directly reflects the functional requirements of any
given vessel.

BLOOD CIRCULATION

The blood circulation has a systemic circuit and a pulmonary circuit. The latter operates at
considerably lower pressure to accommodate oxygenation of blood in the pulmonary capillaries. The
microscopic anatomy of both systems is similar, although systemic vessels tend to have thicker walls
to accommodate higher pressures.
The blood circulation is composed arteries, arterioles, microcirculation (capillaries and sinusoids),
venules, and veins. Arteries serve to conduct high-pressure blood to an organ. These transition into
arterioles and metaarterioles that distribute and regulate pressure to a vast network of delicate
capillaries. Following exchange at the level of the microvasculature, blood collected by venules is
returned to the heart by veins. Generally speaking, blood vessels closer to the heart have wider
diameter and thicker walls; arteries have thicker walls and smaller lumens than veins.

VASCULAR TUNICS

With the exception of capillaries and sinusoids, all larger vessels have the same three basic structural
elements (tunics). These are the tunica intima (inner or luminal layer), tunica media (middle layer),
and tunica adventitia (outer layer). Depending on the level of the vasculature, there are marked
differences in the tunic width.
Endothelial cells are arguably the most important component of the tunica intima and form the
primary barrier between blood and tissue. They are highly specialized cell type and cover the luminal
surface of the tunica intima. Endothelial cells have a number of critical functions. During a resting
phase, endothelial cells have important anti-clotting functions. They have anticoagulant effects
(expression of heparin like molecules, production of thrombomodulin, tissue factor pathway inhibitor),
inhibit platelet aggregation (ADPase, prostacyclin), and promote fibrinolysis (synthesis of tissue type
plasminogen activator). Under certain pathologic states, endothelium contributes to a prothrombotic
state by activating/aggregating platelets (ie. platelet activating factor, von Willebrand’s factor),
inhibiting fibrinolysis (plasminogen activator inhibitors), and producing procoagulant factors (ie.
tissue factor). Other functions include:
1. Synthesis of collagen and proteoglycan for basement membrane maintenance (connective
tissue interface)
2. Modulation of blood flow by secretion and metabolism of vasoactive mediators (ie. nitric
oxide, endothelin, angiotensin I)
3. Degradation of catecholamines
4. Expression of surface molecules that facilitate adhesion, rolling, and diapedesis of
inflammatory cells
5. Production of growth hormones (ie. FGF, PDGF)
6. Production of molecules that mediate the acute inflammatory reaction (ie. IL-1, 6, 8)
7. Antigen presentation
Endothelial cells can be identified by their location. They are the flattened, fusiform cells lining the
lumen of vessels. Von Willebrand’s factor can be contained in Weibel-Palade bodies that might be
apparent under electron microscopy. Other ultrastructural features include cytoplasmic vesicles that
reflect phagocytic and pinocytotic activity. Highly specialized endothelial modifications can be present
depending on the organ and location (see discussion on capillary structure and function). Supporting
the vascular endothelium, and forming the remainder of the tunica intima, is a basement membrane

and a subendothelial layer. The subendothelial layer contains collagen, elastic fibers and proteoglycan;
smooth muscle cells, fibroblasts and myofibroblasts are also present. Collagen, contained within the
subendothelium, is a particularly important stimulus for platelet activation and adhesion. Fibronectin
helps to stabilize cell-cell and cell-substrate interactions.
The tunica media is the middle portion of the vessel wall. It contains extracellular matrix (elastic
laminae, ground substance), and circumferentially arranged smooth muscle cells. The internal and
external elastic laminae delineate the inner and outer limits of the tunica media, respectively. These
elastic laminae become harder to identify in closer proximity to the microcirculation. In histologic
sections of arteries, arteries contract and the internal elastic lamina has extensive tortuous folds. In
arteries, the tunica media is extremely thick and is the primary constituent of the vessel wall. The
venous supply, which operates at considerably lower pressure, has an extremely thin tunica media.
Unlike arteries, the internal elastic lamina is only prominent in medium and large caliber veins.
The tunica adventitia is the outermost layer of the vessel wall. It is composed of a loose layer of
connective tissue, containing vasa vasorum, a vascular bed designed to perfuse the vessel wall itself.
The tunica adventitia is particularly prominent in large caliber veins (such as the caudal vena cava),
where it may also contain bundles of loosely arranged smooth muscle responsible for maintaining
venous tone. The adventitia of large veins is richly innervated by nerves and also contains lymphatic
vessels.

ARTERIES AND ARTERIOLES

Arteries can be classified as elastic or muscular. Elastic arteries lie closer to the heart and their primary
function is to conduct blood to different areas of the body. This blood flows at high pressure, with
marked changes in blood velocity. To accommodate this, elastic arteries have thick walls containing
many, concentrically arranged, fenestrated elastin laminae. These are interspersed by smooth muscle
cells and ground substance rich in proteoglycan. As elastic vessels become progressively smaller, the
pulsatile nature of blood flow is more a result of elastic recoil rather than the heat beat itself.
Moving away from the heart, arteries contain progressively less elastin and become muscular
arteries. This can be an abrupt or gradual transition. Muscular arteries have a distributive function,
serving to take blood to specific organs. Branching and increased number of arteries means that the
total volume is increased and flow velocity is reduced. Muscular arteries contain a thick wall of helically
arranged smooth muscle cells, with lesser quantities of elastin.
Arterioles are less than approximately 100 μm wide in the contracted state. Regulation of blood flow
to the capillary bed happens at the level of the metaarteriole. Precapillary sphincters can also limit
flow to the capillaries that cannot tolerate pressures normally encountered in the arterial system.
Blood flow to the capillary bed can be yet further regulated by arteriovenous anastomoses, which
allow blood to bypass regional capillaries. Anastomoses arising in close proximity, and surrounded by
a fibrous capsule, are referred to as a glomus bodies. The importance of arteriovenous anastomoses is
best demonstrated in erectile reproductive tissue.

CAPILLARIES AND SINUSOIDS

Capillaries have the smallest diameter of the vascular system. Their anatomy is such that it easily
facilitates interchange of nutrients/waste between blood and organ. Capillaries are tubules less than 10
μm wide (ie. not much larger than a red blood cell). Capillaries are often collapsed in routine histologic
sections and it can be difficult to appreciate this extensive, anastomosing network of small caliber
vessels. Structurally, capillaries are essentially formed of endothelium supported by a basal lamina.
The latter is selectively porous to small molecules approximately <70,000 MW. Loosely distributed
around capillaries are pericytes that are directly apposed to the basal lamina and are capable of
transdifferentiating into different cell types (ie. fibroblasts, smooth muscle cells). The most ubiquitous
microcirculatory vessel in the body is the continuous capillary, with endothelial cells linked by tight
junctions and intercellular gaps of approximately 1 nm. Examples of continuous capillaries are found
in the lungs and brain.
Capillary structure can be yet further modified to reflect the functional needs of an organ.
Fenestrated capillaries contain small cytoplasmic gaps and lie on an uninterrupted basal lamina. These
vessels are more permeable than continuous capillaries, allowing easy transfer between the blood and
interstitial fluid. Fenestrated capillaries are common in endocrine organs and the intestine. Porous
capillaries are demonstrated in the glomerulus and allow formation of the ultrafiltrate that ultimately
becomes urine.
Sinusoids are slightly larger than capillaries and are found in the adrenal glands, liver, spleen,
and bone marrow. Sinusoids have large gaps between endothelial cells; the basal lamina is either
discontinuous or absent. As a result, sinusoids are considerably more permeable and are capable of
considerable rapid nutrient exchange. Endothelial cells lining hepatic sinusoids are interspersed by
macrophages, which have an important phagocytic function.

VENULES AND VEINS

The structure of venules and veins is essentially similar structure to arterioles and arteries. In contrast
to arteries, the tunica media is considerably thinner and the tunica adventitia may form the thickest
wall component. Post capillary venules have a particularly important function in inflammatory
responses, contributing to fluid leakage and leukocyte diapedesis. This function is not readily apparent
in routine histologic sections. All veins and venules contain semilunar valves that prevent retrograde
flow.

LYMPHATIC CIRCULATION

Lymph is fluid that drains from the extracellular space of tissues. This fluid normally forms as capillary
fluid passes out of the vessels, and is composed of water, electrolytes, and lesser amounts of plasma
proteins. Lymph vessels return this fluid to the circulating blood. It is a one “circuit system” until the
two interconnected circulatory system comprised by the arteries and veins.
Lymph flows at extremely low pressure and filters through lymph nodes which act as the sentinels
for immune stimulation. Because of the low pressure, the walls of lymphatics are exceedingly thin and
are readily collapsible (often not apparent in routine histologic sections). The basement membrane
is largely absent and there are no pericytes. As a result, lymphatic endothelium is considerably more
permeable than continuous blood capillary endothelium. Anchoring filaments attach the endothelial
cells to surrounding connective tissue. Valves in lymphatic vessels prevent retrograde flow. The major
conduit for lymph in the body is the thoracic duct, which drains into the left brachiocephalic vein
(canine; species variations exist). Elevations in central venous pressure have potential to disrupt
lymphatic flow, resulting in chylothorax. Tissues that notably lack lymphatics include the central
nervous system, cartilage, bone, bone marrow, placenta, cornea, and teeth.

OVERVIEW OF THE HEART

The heart and associated structures are broadly broken into 6 functionally and structurally distinct
compartments: the pericardium/epicardium, endocardium, myocardium, valves, fibrous skeleton, and
conduction system.
Pericardium
The pericardium has fibrous and serous components. The fibrous component forms the outermost layer
of the pericardial sac and is composed of dense collagenous tissue. The serous pericardium lines the
pericardial cavity, and is covered by mesothelial cells which secrete the pericardial fluid. Quiescent
mesothelial cells are flattened under routine light microscopy. Following injury, these cells can become
cuboidal or even columnar.
The parietal (outer-most) layer forms the pericardial sac which is readily apparent grossly. This is
continuous with the visceral layer (synonymous with the epicardium) which is a thin layer covering the
surface of the heart. Beneath the visceral pericardium, there is often a thin layer of adipose containing
vessels and lymphatics. While the parietal pericardium is capable of adapting to changes in size of the
heart, it has limited ability to expand rapidly (such as following acute pericardial effusion). Chronic
distension of the pericardial sac is better tolerated as collagen fibers in the pericardium presumably
remodel.
Endocardium
The endocardium is the inner most lining of the heart and is the cardiac equivalent of the tunica
intima. It is lined by endothelial cells and supported by a small amount of fibrous stroma. The
endocardium is continuous with the atrioventricular valves and also covers chordae tendinae, papillary
muscles, and chordae tendinae. The endocardium may contain a small amount of adipose, lymphatic
vessels, and nerves. Purkinje fibers, important in electrical transmission, are also contained within the
endocardium.
Myocardium
Like skeletal muscle, cardiac muscle is striated with many of the same ultrastructural features,
including Z-lines, A bands, and I bands (described in Chapter 4 Muscle). Key differences from skeletal
muscle are:
1. Branching of cardiomyocytes

Veterinary Histology

80

2. Prominent connective tissue
3. Cardiomyocytes have centrally located nuclei with a perinuclear halo
4. Transversely orientated intercalated discs
A unique feature of atrial cardiomyocytes is the presence of cytoplasmic granules containing atrial
natriuretic factor (ANF). Secretion of ANF counteracts aldosterone, and induces natriuresis,
vasodilation, and suppression of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system.
The intercalated discs are especially important for cardiac muscle function, and are junctional
complexes between terminal Z lines. The intercalated disc contains desmosomes, gap junctions, and
fasciae adherentes. Cardiomyocytes are particularly rich in mitochondria and have large quantities of
myoglobin. Ventricular cardiomyocytes are arranged into outer, middle and inner layers that form a
convoluted helix around the heart. These layers are difficult to appreciate in routine sections. Cardiac
myocytes also form a thin sleeve of tissue that extend from the left atrium into the walls of pulmonary
veins. These cells are thought to be an important focus of ectopic activity in certain disease states (such
as in atrial fibrillation).
Valves
Valves are covered by endothelium which has a similar function to vascular endothelium elsewhere
in the body. Different layers of the tricuspid and mitral valves include the atrialis (on the atrial side),
spongiosa, fibrosa, and ventricularis (on the ventricular side). Beyond the proximal ½ of the valve, the
valve is avascular and these different layers are not readily appreciable. The valve stroma is composed
of a mixture of collagen, elastic fibers, and proteoglycans. Valve interstitial cells (VICs) are the primary
stromal cell and are responsible for homeostasis of the extracellular matrix. VICs are also activated
in valvulopathies, and play an important role in progression of diseases such as myxomatous valvular
degeneration (‘endocardiosis’).
Conduction System
Heart rate is determined by a collection of sinoatrial nodal cells (‘pacemaker cells’) located near
the confluence of the cranial vena cava and right atrium, in the subepicardial myocardium. While
these cells are essentially modified cardiomyocytes, they are slightly smaller and interspersed by
dense fibrous connective tissue. Sinoatrial node cells are often found in close association to the sinus
node artery. They are extensively modified by autonomic ganglia which are located in the adjacent
epicardium. The atrioventricular node is microscopically similar to the sinoatrial node, and can be
found slightly cranial (anterior) to the coronary sinus, and immediately dorsal to the tricuspid annulus.
Electrical impulses continue to be conducted through Purkinje fibers which branch at the basal aspect
of the interventricular septum, and send ventricular ramifications in the subendocardium. Purkinje
cells are considerably larger than regular cardiomyocytes and stain lightly eosinophilic. Electrical
conduction is facilitated by desmosomes and gap junctions. Intercalated discs are not present between
Purkinje cells.

OVERVIEW

The integumentary system, or skin, represents the interface between the internal body and the
external environment. As such, the primary role of skin is protection. This includes protection from
physical insults, including UV light, as well as providing a barrier to pathogens. In addition, the skin
is crucial to an animal’s thermoregulation, sensing of its environment, and energy and metabolic
functions.
The skin is composed of three primary components: Epidermis, Dermis, and Subcutaneous tissue (also
known as the hypodermis or subcutis).

STRUCTURE OF THE EPIDERMIS

The epidermis is a multilayered epithelial structure composed of keratinocytes that produce the
structural protein keratin. Histologically, the epidermis is composed primarily of four tightly-adherent
layers of squamous epithelium organized into distinct vertical zones by stages of differentiation.
The epidermis is reminiscent of a brick wall, with the keratinocytes representing bricks, and
intercellular matrix representing the mortar. From innermost to outermost the layers are: stratum
basale, stratum spinosum, stratum granulosum, and stratum corneum.
Stratum basale
The deepest/innermost layer of the epidermis is the stratum basale. Histologically, the stratum basale
is a single layer of cuboidal keratinocytes that directly abut and attach to the dermis. The two primary
functions of the stratum basale are 1) proliferation and 2) attachment of the epidermis to the dermis.
Cells of the stratum basale essentially represent germinal cells (“brick generators”) responsible
for the generation of all cells of the epidermis. As such, these cells are the most mitotically active
keratinocytes (apparent in histologic sections) and are the least differentiated. Stratum basale
keratinocytes divide and then “push up” towards the surface, differentiating into cells of the stratum
spinosum.
Stratum spinosum
Histologically, the stratum spinosum is located directly above (superficial to) the stratum basale. Cells
of the stratum spinosum have prominent cell-to-cell junctions, termed desmosomes, that appear as
spiky membrane projections on histology. For this reason, these are referred to as “prickle cells”.
Desmosomes are protein complexes that firmly attach keratinocytes to their surrounding cells
(intercellular, between cells), thereby providing significant structural integrity. Tonofilaments are
intracellular (within cells) protein complexes that anchor desmosomes to the cell membranes.
The thickness of the stratum spinosum can vary dramatically depending on the anatomic location on
an animal. For example, the stratum spinosum of canine inguinal skin is 1-2 cell layers thick, whereas
the stratum spinosum of the canine footpad is often >20 cell layers thick! The reason for this is clear
when the primary function of skin is considered: protection.
Stratum granulosum
The stratum granulosum, where present, sits above the stratum spinosum and directly below the
stratum corneum. Histologically, the stratum granulosum is a thin layer of keratinocytes containing

89

Ryan Jennings and Christopher Premanandan

dense, basophilic (blue/purple) cytoplasmic structures called keratohyalin granules. Keratohyalin
granules contain components responsible for keratinization, including fibrous proteins (keratohyalin)
and a lipid-rich secretory product.
It should be noted that the stratum granulosum is not apparent in all regions of the skin, particularly
in regions of thin skin (e.g. canine inguinal and axillary skin).
Stratum corneum
The stratum corneum is the variably thick (10-20 layers) outermost layer of the skin. Histologically,
cells of the stratum corneum, or corneocytes, are flattened eosinophilic keratinocytes that lack nuclei
(anuclear). Corneocytes, often considered “dead”, retain some metabolic and signaling functions
despite having no organelles or nuclei.
Keratinocytes of the stratum corneum have a thickened, insoluble, hydrophobic, cell membrane and
contain abundant keratin. In addition, the corneocytes are surrounded by a hydrophobic phospholipid
secretory product (produced by stratum granulosum). Together, these combine to provide the
hydrophobic and structural properties that serve to protect the epidermis from physical insults as
well as water loss. Desmosomal attachment become more sparse in superficial layers, resulting in
sloughing of keratinocytes, a process known as desquamation.

PHYSIOLOGY OF THE EPIDERMIS

The epidermis is essentially a layering of differentially mature keratinocytes, going from least
differentiated (stratum basale) to most differentiated (stratum corneum). The rate and extent of
differentiation may change according to physiologic demand, whether due to normal, everyday need
(e.g. digital pads) or in response to a disease process (e.g. bacterial dermatitis). In this way, the skin
responds to external, and sometimes internal, stimuli in an exceptionally dynamic manner.
Another important point to consider is the energy needs of the integumentary system. The constant
proliferation and generation of new keratinocytes is necessary to balance the constant loss of
superficial keratinocytes (desquamation). As a result, the skin has an immense nutritional
requirement. In the event of suboptimal nutrition, the skin and hair coat may be altered, reflecting this
systemic nutritional deficiency. In fact, dogs with chronic malnutrition often have epidermal atrophy
and other integumentary changes. Additionally, vitamin and mineral deficiencies (e.g. Vitamin A,
zinc, copper, et al.) manifest with integumentary changes including hyperkeratosis, defective hair coat
quality, and predisposition to secondary bacterial infections of the skin. Therefore, the skin often
reflects both the nutritional and health status of an animal, and is therefore a clinically important
aspect of the physical exam.

ADDITIONAL CELLS OF THE EPIDERMIS

Although keratinocytes comprise the vast majority of epidermal cells, there are a number of accessory
cells present in the normal epidermis that provide important contributions to the function of the skin.
Melanocytes
Melanocytes are professional melanin synthesizing cells located primarily within the basilar (deeper)
regions of the epidermis, and are histologically recognized as poorly staining “clear cells”. Variation in
epidermal melanin content is responsible for the color variety in most domestic species. The density
of melanocytes within the epidermis is relatively uniform between individual animals of a species.
Pigmentation is therefore largely dependent on the amount of melanin produced by melanocytes.
Melanocytes have complex dendritic processes that lie adjacent to keratinocytes and facilitate the
transfer of melanin to keratinocytes. Although melanocytes are the producers of melanin,
keratinocytes often contain the greatest amount of melanin, via transfer from melanocytes.
Melanogenesis, the process of melanin generation, occurs within specialized, melanocyte-specific
organelles called melanosomes. Production of melanin can vary based on anatomic location (e.g. oral
mucosa pigmentation in some dogs) and/or in response to physiologic need (e.g. chronically sunexposed skin). Tyrosine is an amino acid required for melanogenesis. Within melanosomes, tyrosine
is converted into intermediate compounds (e.g. dihydroxyphenylalanine, DOPA) by tyrosinase.
Tyrosinase is a copper-containing enzyme. For this reason, copper deficiency in sheep and cattle
results in a characteristic loss of hair coat pigmentation.
Melanin serves unique protective roles in the epidermis, including the ability to both scatter and
reflect ultraviolet (UV) rays, and as a scavenger of potentially damaging free radicals. Melanization
is also a dynamic process, and increased pigmentation (hyperpigmentation) or reduced pigmentation
(hypopigmentation) may be associated with various disease cutaneous processes.
Langerhans cells
Langerhans cells are dendritic cells sparsely located within the stratum basale. Although they are
functionally different from melanocytes, they also appear histologically as “clear cells”. As dendritic
cells, the primary function of Langerhans cells is to take up antigens (antigen = molecules that induce
an immune response) and present them to and activate cells of the immune system, such as T cells.
In this role, Langerhans cells serve as “sentinels” at the interface of the external environment and the
immune system. For example, in a bacterial skin infection, Langerhans cells may take up fragments
of the bacteria (bacterial antigens), migrate to the regional lymph node, and present these bacterial

Veterinary Histology

92

antigens to T cells present in the lymph node. In doing so, the Langerhans cell bridges aspects of the
innate (skin) and adaptive (T cells) immune responses.

STRUCTURE OF THE DERMIS

The dermis serves as the structural support foundation of the brick wall that is the epidermis. The
dermis is composed of a meshwork of collagen-rich fibrous connective tissue. Collagen is the primary
structural protein of the dermis. Elastin, an elastic protein, is present in lesser amounts but
contributes to flexibility of the dermis. The structural proteins are interspersed with a gel-like ground
substance composed of extracellular fluid and glycoaminoglycans. In this way, the dermis is similar to
a sponge where dynamic compression is possible.
The dermis is divided into two regions: the superficial, or papillary dermis, and the more substantial
reticular dermis. The functions of the dermis, in addition to providing structural and tensile strength,
include thermoregulation (vasculature), support for adnexal structures, a focus of immune responses,
and storage of fluid, electrolytes and nutrients.
Dermal cell populations
Dermal collagen, elastin and ground substance is produced by dermal fibroblasts, narrow spindloid
mesenchymal cells uniformly but sparsely distributed throughout the dermis. Dermal fibroblasts not
only generate the structural proteins of the dermis, but also play a major role in dermal inflammation
and wound healing. In addition, the dermis contains low numbers of resident immune cells, including
mast cells, macrophages, dendritic cells, and T cells. These immune cells are critical in the
development of both innate and adaptive immune responses in the skin.
Vasculature
The vascular supply for the epidermis and dermal adnexal structures is located within the dermis.
The vasculature is divided into three distinct layers: subcutaneous/deep dermal, cutaneous plexus,
and papillary plexus. The largest blood supply, the subcutaneous/deep dermal supply, is composed
of arteries and veins that branch superficially into the middermis to form the cutaneous plexus. The
cutaneous plexus is responsible for supplying blood to the adnexal structures of the dermis, including
follicles and glands. Finally, the cutaneous plexus branches superficially to form a fine network of
capillaries and venules called the papillary plexus, which lies directly subjacent to and supplies blood
to the epidermis.
Blood flow to the skin is dynamic, and factors such as environmental temperature, systemic disease
and/or localized inflammation can readily induce shunting of blood to or from the skin.

DERMAL ADNEXA - FOLLICLES

The dermal adnexa, or appendages, are accessory structures that include hair and feather follicles as
well as secretory glands.
Hair and feather follicles
Hair and feathers serve as an adjunct barrier to the skin, providing a thermal barrier, physical barrier,
and a photo-protective barrier. Hair and feathers are produced from follicles. Follicles are tubular
structures formed by invaginations of epidermis into the dermis. Follicles serve to generate, attach,
and support hair or feather shafts, and also contribute to epidermal re-epithelialization and repair
following injury.
Hair follicles have three distinct zones; from deep to superficial they are: bulb, isthmus, and
infundibulum. Hair growth begins at the deepest portion of the follicle, the bulb. A specialized
structure, the dermal papilla, lies adjacent to the bulb and induces growth of the hair follicle and hair
production. Hairs/feathers are essentially rolled cylinders of keratinocytes. On section, hair/feathers
have three distinct zones; from outermost to innermost, they are: cuticle, cortex, and medulla.
Hair and feather growth occurs in a cyclical pattern of proliferation progressing through distinct
stages of development which include anagen (growth phase), catagen, and telogen (resting phase).
Terminally, the hair is exfoliated (shed). Growth is influenced by numerous factors that include
anatomic location, hormones, daylight, ambient temperature, nutrition, and various growth factors.
Hair shafts are categorized into primary and secondary hairs. Primary hairs are larger and also
referred to as “guard hairs”, whereas secondary hairs are smaller, and comprise the “undercoat”.
Species such as horses only have primary hairs; dogs and cats have both primary and secondary hairs.
This, in part, accounts for the different texture of their coats. Further, hair follicles are categorized
as simple and compound. These categories are based on the number of hair shafts that exit a single
infundibulum. Horses and cattle only have simple follicles (one hair shaft emerges from one
infundibulum), whereas dogs and cats have both simple follicles interspersed with compound follicles
(multiple hair shafts emerge from one infundibulum). In sheep, wool is produced as compound
follicles.
Arrector pili muscle
The arrector pili muscle is a band-like bundle of smooth muscle that attaches to the hair follicle and
dermis. The primary role of the arrector pili muscle is pilo-erection (hair erection). Pilo-erection
serves to establish a layer of air between the surface of the hair/fur and the skin, serving as insulation.

95

Ryan Jennings and Christopher Premanandan

In addition, pilo-erection has a major role in animal behavior for domestic species such as the cat and
dog.
Tactile hairs (vibrissae, sinus hairs, whiskers)
Tactile hairs are modified hair follicles surrounded by a blood-filled sinus and highly innervated.
Because of this arrangement, motion of the hair transmits through the blood-filled sinus to the nerve,
transducing physical stimulus to sensation.

DERMAL ADNEXA - SEBACEOUS GLANDS

Sebaceous glands are composed of clusters of pale-staining, highly vacuolated epithelial cells
(sebocytes) that are located adjacent to follicles. Sebaceous glands are responsible for producing
sebum, a lipid-containing compound with moisturizing and antimicrobial properties. Sebocytes
secrete sebum in a manner called “holocrine secretion”, in which the sebocytes rupture, thereby
releasing their cytoplasmic contents (sebum) into the sebaceous duct. The sebaceous duct and the
sebum empties into the isthmus portion of the hair follicle, coating the hair shaft and surrounding
epidermis in sebum.
Specialized sebaceous glands by location
Meibomian gland – Eyelid
The Meibomian glands are sebaceous glands that open through a common duct onto the margin of the
eyelid. Histologically, the sebocytes of the Meibomian gland appear identical to those of sebaceous
glands in the skin, but are organized into a much larger, single gland. The Meibomian gland’s lipidrich secretion (meibum) contributes to the tear film.
Glands of Zeis – Eyelid
Glands of Zeis are specialized sebaceous glands that are associated with eyelashes, specialized hair
follicles located at the margins of the eyelid. The Glands of Zeis are histologically identical to
cutaneous sebaceous glands located elsewhere.
Hepatoid (perianal) glands – Perianal, parapreputial, and tail skin
Hepatoid glands are modified sebaceous glands in dogs, so named due to their morphologic similarity
to hepatocytes. These glands are primarily located in the perianal skin (perineum), as well as along
the base of the tail and prepuce. They are more developed in male dogs. Histologically, they appear as
discrete lobules composed of an outer layer of small basaloid cells surrounding larger, polygonal cells
with abundant eosinophilic (pink) cytoplasm (resembling hepatocytes).
These glands are of clinical importance as hepatoid gland adenomas (benign tumors) are common.
Tumors of hepatoid glands should be distinguished from the tumors of the apocrine glands of the anal
sac (discussed below).

DERMAL ADNEXA - EPITRICHIAL (APOCRINE)
GLANDS AND ECCRINE GLANDS

Epitrichial glands and eccrine glands are coiled tubular glands. Epitrichial glands secrete via apocrine
secretion in which small portions of membrane surrounding cytoplasmic contents are actively broken
off and secreted into the gland lumen. Eccrine glands secrete via merocrine secretion, in which
secretion is by exocytosis, and secrete directly onto the surface of the skin. These apocrine glands
empty into the hair follicle (epitrichial glands) or onto the skin surface (eccrine glands).
Apocrine glands are widely distributed in dogs and cats, always associated with haired skin. Eccrine
sweat glands, however, are present primarily in the non-haired skin of the footpads and nose.
Specialized apocrine glands by location
Anal sac glands – Perineum
The anal sacs are paired saccules that are located deep to the perineum and immediately ventrolateral
to the rectum in carnivores (cats and dogs). The anal sacs have ducts that empty directly into the
terminal rectum. Anal sacs are lined by a thin layer of keratinizing stratified squamous epithelium
and surrounded by skeletal muscle. These structures serve to receive and excrete the secretions of
specialized glands, called apocrine glands of the anal sac (anal sac glands) that line the wall of the
anal sac. Although histologically identical to apocrine glands of the skin, the anal sac glands are
functionally distinct, and produce an odiferous secretion that likely serves in olfactory communication
(territory, etc.).
The anal sacs and their glands are of significant clinical importance. Apocrine gland
adenocarcinomas of the anal sac are common and highly malignant tumors in dogs developing from
these anal sac glands. Additionally, inflammation and impaction of the anal sacs are common clinical
diseases.
Glands of Moll – Eyelash
Glands of Moll are specialized apocrine glands that are associated with eyelashes. The Glands of Moll
are histologically identical to apocrine glands of the skin.
Ceruminous glands – External ear canal
The ceruminous glands are modified apocrine glands throughout the skin of the external ear canal.

These glands are histologically identical to apocrine glands of the skin elsewhere. The ceruminous
glands contribute to cerumen, a waxy product composed of the combined secretions of ceruminous
glands and sebaceous glands of the external ear canal.

HYPODERMIS (SUBCUTIS, SUBCUTANEOUS
TISSUE)

The subcutis is the deepest layer of the integument, sandwiched between the dermis and skeletal
muscle. The hypodermis serves as physical protection, as well as an energy reserve and source of
insulation and thermal regulation. It is composed primarily of adipose tissue, the amount of which
varies based on species, anatomic site, and nutritional status. Adipose tissue is composed of clusters
or sheets of lipid-filled cells, called adipocytes. On histology, the lipid in adipocytes appears empty, as
the fat-soluble lipid is washed out during processing.

SPECIALIZED ANATOMIC SITES

Histology of the Digit
The anatomy of the digits of domestic species are varied, and some species, such as horses and
ruminants, have highly specialized digits worth additional consideration.
Carnivore digit
In carnivores, the ventrum of the digit is called the digital pad. The digital pad is the toughest and
thickest skin of the body. The digital cushion is an accumulation of abundant fibroadipose tissue
(similar to the subcutis) that is also rich in sensory nerves and glands.
The claw (nail) of carnivores is composed of specialized epidermis and dermis that are firmly affixed
to the underlying third phalanx (P3). Growth of the claw occurs outward from the epidermis adjacent
to the nail fold. The externally apparent outer layer of the claw is composed of abundant layers of
compact stratum corneum (anuclear cornified keratinocytes). This stratum corneum is the portion of
the claw that is “trimmed”. Beneath the epidermis is the highly vascular and well-innervated dermis,
or “quick”. The deep dermis fuses with the periosteum of the ungual process of the distal P3. In this
manner, the dermis anchors the claw to the digit.
Equine hoof
The equine hoof is an anatomically complex structure. The hoof itself can be compared to the claw of
the carnivore, as it represents abundant epidermis with underlying dermis attached to P3. The dorsal
and lateral hoof is called the wall, whereas the ventral aspect of the hoof is called the sole. The sole is
anatomically similar to that of the digital cushion of carnivores.
The hoof wall is composed of three distinct layers of stratum corneum. The outer two layers, the
stratum externum and stratum medium, are generated by and grow downward from the epidermis
of the coronary band (or coronet, similar to the cuticle of a fingernail). The stratum externum, or
periople, is the thin, outermost layer of the hoof wall. The stratum medium, or tubular horn, is the
middle and thickest layer of the hoof wall. This layer also may contain pigment.
The innermost layer of the hoof wall is the stratum internum. This layer is produced by the
epithelium of the laminar epidermis and is fused to the stratum medium, forming a relatively
contiguous hoof wall. The laminar epidermis sits on top of the laminar dermis, also referred to as the
corium. The corium is firmly affixed to P3, similar to that of the carnivore digit.
One of the most critical and specialized structures of the hoof are the laminae (singular: lamina). To
understand the anatomy of the hoof, it is beneficial to understand the physiologic roles of the hoof.

Veterinary Histology

102

The forces exerted on the hoof by animals such as the horse are significant. The hoof is required to
maintain its structural integrity despite these enormous forces (consider the forces exerted on the
hooves of a galloping horse)! Hoof laminae are anatomic adaptations that facilitate this structural
integrity. Laminae are interdigitating finger-like projections of dermis (dermal laminae) and epidermis
(epidermal laminae). The interdigitation of these laminae generates friction at the interface when
force is applied. What’s more, these interdigitations are extensive, and there are both primary laminae
as well as smaller projections, called secondary laminae. Secondary laminae greatly increase the
surface area of interdigitation between the dermal laminae and epidermal laminae. An increase
in surface area of contact between these structures corresponds to increased frictional surface and
increased resistance to separation, allowing for optimal structural integrity.
Although structural integrity at the interface of dermal and epidermal laminae is maintained in
normal animals, separation at this interface can occur, and is referred to as laminitis. Separation of
laminae results in loss of structural integrity and the characteristic radiographic finding of rotation of
the third phalanx (P3).

histologic changes expected following infection of a puppy with canine parvovirus-1 (i.e. if CPV-1
kills cells of the crypts, what consequences does this have to the intestinal mucosa?)

OVERVIEW

The gastrointestinal system of domestic species exemplifies the anatomic diversity encountered in
veterinary medicine. Despite this diversity, the gastrointestinal system of all species is unified through
the primary goal of breaking down ingested nutrients for absorption and utilization. This process
begins with prehension and ingestion, and follows with digestion, absorption, and waste elimination.
Knowledge of the microscopic anatomy of the gastrointestinal tract goes hand-in-hand with
understanding the functionality of this system. Additionally, knowledge of the histology will greatly
aid the veterinarian in understanding the processes, infectious and otherwise, that mediate clinical
disease in these species.

ORAL CAVITY

The major structures of the oral cavity are the lips, teeth, tongue, oral mucosa and salivary glands. The
primary function of the oral cavity is in prehending, masticating, and moistening of food. The latter
two functions prepare food for deglutition (swallowing).
The oral mucosa (labial and gingival) offers protection during mastication and deglutition, and is
composed of stratified squamous epithelium that may be keratinized. Below the mucosa is a dense
layer of vascular collagen-rich stroma, the lamina propria. Mobile regions of the oral cavity, such as
the soft palate, may also contain skeletal muscle that aids in mastication and deglutition.
Tongue
The tongue is a muscular organ that serves two major roles: mechanical manipulation of ingesta
and sensing (taste). The tongue is covered by typical oral mucosa (stratified squamous epithelium)
overlying a lamina propria and large amounts of organized skeletal muscle (discussed below).
The dorsal surface of the tongue is decorated by specialized structures called papillae. These
structures serve diverse functions, ranging from facilitating taste (e.g. circumvallate) to grooming
(e.g. filiform papillae in cats). There are four distinct papillae: filiform papillae, fungiform papillae,
foliate papillae, and circumvallate papillae. The filiform papillae generally predominate in the rostral
portion of the tongue. Species such as cats have well-developed filiform papillae which contribute to
the “sandpaper-like” feel of their tongues. Circumvallate and fungiform papillae are partially lined by
taste buds, specialized chemoreceptors that transmit the sensation of taste. These papillae are often
located caudally on the dorsal surface of the tongue and are bilaterally symmetric in distribution. They
may be prominent structures and should be not be misinterpreted as pathologic lesions.
The core of the tongue is composed of abundant skeletal muscle that is arranged in three distinct
layers of alternating orientations/planes (vertical, horizontal, and longitudinal). This robust
musculature facilitates the extreme mobility of the tongue.
Salivary Glands
Salivary glands, which include parotid, submaxillary, sublingual, zygomatic (carnivores) and accessory
glands, contribute to the production of saliva. Saliva is a complex watery secretion that acts to
lubricate, moisten and digest ingesta and is composed of a mixture of mucus, electrolytes, antibodies
and digestive enzymes (e.g. amylase).
Structurally, salivary glands are composed of lobules of exocrine tubuloacinar glands that secrete
into a duct. Secretion is mediated, in part, by contraction of myoepithelial cells that surround acini.
Salivary glands are composed of serous and/or mucus secretory epithelial cells. Serous secretory cells

Veterinary Histology

110

have an eosinophilic, slightly granular cytoplasm, whereas mucus cells have abundant foamy, lightly
staining cytoplasm. The parotid gland is entirely composed of serous acini, the sublingual primarily
mucous acini, and the submaxillary a combination of serous and mucous acini.

GENERAL HISTOLOGIC ANATOMY OF THE
TUBULAR DIGESTIVE TRACT

Distal, or aboral, to the oral cavity is the tubular digestive tract. The general histologic organization
of the tubular digestive tract, from esophagus to rectum, is quite similar. These organs have a central
luminal space through which digesta passes.
The wall of these tubular organs are organized into distinct anatomic layers; from innermost
(luminal) to outermost they are:
• Mucosa
• Submucosa
• Tunica muscularis, and
• Adventitia (serosa)
The mucosa includes both the lining epithelium as well as the lamina propria and muscularis mucosa.
The collagen-rich lamina propria lies directly below the mucosal epithelium (the lamina propria
is similar to the dermis of skin). The mucosa also contains a thin layer of smooth muscle, the
muscularis mucosa, that separates the mucosa from the submucosa. The submucosa is composed
of dense collagenous stroma and contains large blood vessels, lymphatics, and nerves. The tunica
muscularis is composed of two distinct layers of smooth muscle: an inner circular layer and an outer
longitudinal layer. Finally, the serosa is a thin layer of fibrovascular tissue that is, externally, lined by
a thin layer of flattened, specialized epithelium called mesothelial cells.
The autonomic innervation of the gastrointestinal tract functions through two distinct regions
containing autonomic ganglia: the submucosal (Meissener’s) plexus, and the myenteric (Auerbach’s)
plexus. This autonomic innervation enables the waves of contraction that propel food through the
tubular digestive tract, also known as peristalsis. These plexi are identified as discrete clusters of
neurons and nerve fibers. The submucosal plexus is located in the submucosa, whereas the myenteric
plexus is located between the inner circular and outer longitudinal smooth muscle layers of the tunica
muscularis.

ESOPHAGUS

The primary physiologic role of the esophagus is the physical transport of ingesta from the oral cavity
to the stomach. The esophageal mucosa is composed of a superficial layer of stratified squamous
epithelium. Beneath the mucosa lie variable numbers of mucous glands, which produce mucus to
lubricate and facilitate passage of digesta.
The constituents of the tunica muscularis varies based on species and location along the length of
the esophagus. For example, in species such as the cat and horse, the tunic muscularis is primarily
composed of skeletal muscle with distal segments incorporating smooth muscle. Dogs and ruminants
have uniform skeletal muscle along the entire length. Pigs, similar to humans, primarily contain
skeletal muscle in the orad 1/3 of the esophagus which transitions to a combination of skeletal and
smooth muscle, and terminates in uniform smooth muscle, distally.
Chickens
Chickens have a specialized outpouching, or diverticulum, located in the distal esophagus (at the
ventral base of the neck): the crop. The anatomy of the crop is identical to the esophagus. The crop
serves as storage for ingesta, allowing for the chicken to consume a large amount of food and digest
later.

STOMACH

There is marked interspecies variations in the gastric compartment, exemplified by the difference
between monogastrics (e.g. carnivores) and the multi-compartmentalized stomach of ruminants (e.g.
cattle). The reader is referred to veterinary gross anatomy texts for the specifics pertaining to these
structures, but the microscopic specifics will be noted here. Regardless, the primary function of
the stomach is mechanical and chemical breakdown of digesta in preparation for absorption in the
intestine.
Dogs and Cats
Domesticated carnivores (dogs and cats) have a single-compartment (simple) stomach that is entirely
lined by glandular mucosa. The stomach is divided into several segments. From oral to aboral they
are: cardia, fundus and pylorus.
The glandular stomach is so named due to the high secretory function of the mucosal epithelium,
which produces mucus, hydrochloric acid, and pepsin. The mucosal surface is formed by numerous
vertically oriented tubular glands. Superficially, the mucosa is composed of gastric pits, which are
small mucosal depressions that form communications between the tubular glands of the mucosa and
the gastric lumen. The gastric pits are primarily lined by mucus-secreting epithelial cells, columnar
epithelial cells with pale to non-staining cytoplasm (mucus) and basal nuclei. These cells produce the
mucus layer that coats the epithelial surface, protecting it from mechanical and chemical injury.
Below the gastric pits and comprising the majority of the mucosal epithelium within the fundus
are two specialized epithelial cell populations. Parietal cells (oxyntic cells) are polygonal epithelial
cells with abundant pale eosinophilic cytoplasm and round, central nuclei located within the central
regions of the fundic mucosa. Parietal cells secrete the hydrochloric acid that acts as the primary
chemical digestive effector of the stomach. Chief cells are low-columnar epithelial cells with granular
eosinophilic cytoplasm and round, eccentric nuclei. Chief cells secrete pepsinogen, which is rapidly
converted to the active form, pepsin, by hydrochloric acid. Pepsin is a proteolytic digestive enzyme
(protease), thereby contributing to digestion. The distribution of the glandular epithelial constituents
varies by region of the glandular stomach. The fundus contains large numbers of parietal cells,
whereas the pylorus is rich in mucus cells but contains few parietal cells.
A third secretory epithelial cell type, gastrin cells, are located primarily within the pylorus. Gastrin
cells secrete gastrin, a hormone induced by the presence of digesta within the stomach (e.g. eating)
that stimulates secretion of the digestive enzyme pepsin (i.e. pepsinogen) and hydrochloric acid by
chief and parietal cells, respectively. Gastrin cells are not readily discernible by routine histologic
methods.

115

Ryan Jennings and Christopher Premanandan

Similar to the other regions of the tubular digestive tract, a lamina propria underlies the gastric
mucosa. External to the lamina propria are the gastric submucosa, tunica muscularis and serosa.
The mucosa of the stomach may contain organized lymphoid aggregates, which are included in the
gastrointestinal-associated lymphoid tissue (GALT; discussed later).

STOMACH - RUMINANTS (CATTLE, GOATS,
SHEEP, CERVIDS)

The ruminant stomach is divided into the nonglandular forestomach (rumen, reticulum, omasum)
and the terminal glandular stomach, the abomasum. The distinct compartments of the ruminant
forestomach warrant specific discussion here.
Rumen
The rumen is the largest (by volume) compartment of the ruminant forestomach. The primary
function of the rumen is as a storage compartment to facilitate microbial (bacterial and protozoal)
fermentation of ingesta. Volatile fatty acids are biproducts of this fermentation process and are readily
absorbed across the ruminal mucosa into the circulation, where they serve as a directly accessible
energy source. In addition, microbial digestion of fibrous ingesta begins the digestion necessary
to access nutrients from ingesta that will undergo further breakdown in more distal parts of the
gastrointestinal tract (e.g. abomasum).
The mucosa of the rumen varies regionally, but forms variably pronounced leaf-like papillae. The
nonglandular mucosa of the rumen is composed of keratinizing stratified squamous epithelium. The
rumen does not contain a muscularis mucosa.
Reticulum
The reticulum and omasum largely act to further mechanical dissociation of digesta following
microbial breakdown. The mucosal surface of the reticulum is composed of long primary and shorter
secondary folds that form a grossly apparent honeycomb-like pattern. As in the rumen, the reticular
mucosa is composed of a keratinizing stratified squamous epithelium. The primary folds (large
papillae) of the retriculum contain bundles of smooth muscle within the lamina propria, also referred
to as the muscularis mucosa.
Omasum
The mucosal surface of the omasum is composed of large, thin, leaf-like structures called laminae. The
microscopic structure of the omasum is similar to the reticulum in that it too contains a muscularis
mucosa that extends into the laminae. In addition, the muscularis externa of the omasum extends into
the laminae, which is unique to this compartment.

Abomasum
The terminal chamber of the stomach of ruminants, the abomasum, is functionally and microscopically
analogous (identical) to that of the simple stomach of carnivores.

STOMACH - ADDITIONAL INTERSPECIES
VARIATIONS

Horses
The equine stomach is composed of a proximal nonglandular mucosal region and an aboral glandular
gastric mucosa. The anatomically distinct demarcation of these regions is referred to as the margo
plicatus. The nonglandular mucosa is lined by stratified squamous epithelium, whereas the glandular
portion is analogous to that of carnivores.
Pigs
In pigs, the gastric region immediately aboral to the esophageal sphincter is a well-delineated segment
of nonglandular mucosa, the pars esophagea. The pars esophagea is lined by stratified squamous
epithelium. The remaining gastric mucosa is glandular and analogous to that of carnivores.
South American Camelids (Llama, Alpaca)
Similar to the stomach of ruminants, the camelid stomach is anatomically divided into specialized
compartments that serve to facilitate digestion of fibrous ingesta (foregut fermentation). The stomach
of camelids is divided into three compartments: compartment 1 (C1), compartment 2 (C2), and
compartment 3 (C3). Compartment 1 (C1) is analogous to the ruminant rumen, and is a large volume
saccule that acts as a vat for microbial fermentation. In contrast to the rumen, C1 is lined primarily by
glandular mucosa with regions of non-glandular stratified squamous epithelium. The C1 also contains
numerous small out-pouchings, or saccules. The C2 is composed of both glandular mucosa and nonglandular stratified squamous epithelium. Finally, C3 is functionally and histologically analogous to
the ruminant abomasum and canine stomach and is entirely glandular.
Chickens (and other fowl)
The proventriculus is glandular stomach that is functionally, but not histologically, analogous to the
canine stomach. The wall of the proventriculus contains numerous large, well-circumscribed glands
(proventricular glands), each formed by collections of branching tubules lined by regions of columnar
mucous cells (microscopically similar to those of the gastric pits) and cuboidal to low columnar
secretory cells. These secretory cells have eosinophilic granular cytoplasm and produce pepsinogen
and hydrochloric acid, thereby serving the roles of both the chief and parietal cells of the canine

119

Ryan Jennings and Christopher Premanandan

stomach, respectively. The proventricular glands open to the luminal surface through apertures in the
mucosal surface. The superficial proventricular mucosal epithelium is primarily composed of mucous
cells.
The gizzard is the compartment immediately aboral to the proventriculus and is distinguished by a
remarkably well-developed and thick smooth muscle wall that contributes to mechanical breakdown of
ingesta. The gizzard is generally more developed in bird species with diets consisting of tough material
(grains) and less so in species with more soft diets (fruit). Histologically, the mucosa is composed of
vertically oriented tubular glands lined by columnar epithelium. The superficial (luminal) surface of
the mucosa is lined by a thick layer of homogeneous, glassy eosinophilic to slightly basophilic material
called koilin. Koilin forms a tough protective coating over the mucosal surface and contributes to the
ability of the gizzard to grind particles of ingesta. The molecular composition of koilin is similar to
but distinct from that of keratin. The koilin is produced by the tubular glands of the gizzard, which
interdigitate with the koilin to provide structural integrity.

SMALL INTESTINE

The small intestine of most domestic species is quite similar in function and histology. Structural
and functional differences in specific regions of the small intestine impart differential functional
capabilities to these segments. The small intestine is divided into three distinct segments, from oral
to aboral: duodenum, jejunum, and ileum. The major functions of the small intestine are digestion,
secretion, and absorption. The small intestinal mucosa has several anatomic adaptations that serve to
create an immense surface area with which to digest and absorb nutrients. These include the plicae
circulares (intestinal folds), villi, and microvilli.
The small intestinal mucosa is characterized by numerous, regularly distributed luminal papillary
projections called villi. Villi are lined by columnar epithelial cells, enterocytes. Enterocytes have
apical microvilli (brush border). Although individual microvilli are indistinguishable, the brush border
is apparent as a faintly staining, uniform ~1 μm layer along the superficial surface of enterocytes.
Enterocytes function mainly in digestion and absorption. The enterocytes are interspersed with goblet
cells, columnar epithelial cells with abundant, poorly staining cytoplasm, representing mucin. The
density of goblet cells is generally more abundant in more distal segments of the intestine.
The intestinal villi are contiguous with glands located at the base of villi: the crypts of Lieberkuhn,
or intestinal crypts. The crypts contain the mitotically active population of intestinal epithelial stem
cells. Mitotic figures are commonly seen in cells of the crypts. Within the crypts, epithelial stem
cells divide and push upward (luminally), further differentiating into enterocytes or goblet cells. In
this way, the small intestinal villi are similar to a production conveyor belt –intestinal epithelial cells
are generated in the crypts and progressively migrate superficially along the villi towards the luminal
surface where, at the tips of villi, the epithelial cells are sloughed into the lumen. This process occurs
continually and promotes a high rate of enterocyte replacement/turnover.
In addition to enterocytes and goblet cells, the small intestine contains low numbers of accessory
cells. In some species such as the horse, the crypts contain low numbers of cells, Paneth cells, that
contain abundant eosinophilic cytoplasmic granules. These granules contain antimicrobial molecules
important in gut innate immunity. Finally, low numbers of enteroendocrine cells are interspersed
within the crypts. These enteroendocrine cells produce hormones that may include somatostatin,
cholecystokinin, and secretin. Enteroendocrine cells are not readily apparent in routine H&E
sections.
The lamina propria of the small intestine extends into and forms the core of small intestinal villi.
The villous lamina propria is composed primarily of loose collagenous tissue, but contains a number
of important structures and cells. The villous lamina propria is rich in both capillaries and lymphatics
that help transport nutrients absorbed by enterocytes across the luminal surface. The small intestinal

121

Ryan Jennings and Christopher Premanandan

lamina propria also contains low numbers of immune cells, including lymphocytes and plasma cells,
and small numbers of lymphocytes are regularly located within the villous epithelium.
Microscopic anatomic features
Although much of the previously discussed features of the small intestine apply to the duodenum,
jejunum, and ileum, distinguishing microscopic anatomic features of the duodenum and ileum are
detailed below.
Duodenum
The gastric pylorus empties into the lumen of the duodenum. The duodenal submucosa contains
extensive tubuloacinar glands, Brunner’s glands, that are lined by tall columnar epithelial cells with
mucin-rich, poorly-staining cytoplasm. The Brunner’s glands communicate with the lumen of the
crypts of Lieberkuhn. The secretions of the Brunner’s glands are alkaline and help to neutralize the
acidic digesta received from the stomach.
The pancreatic duct and common bile duct insert into the wall of the duodenum and communicate
with the duodenal lumen.
Ileum
The ileal mucosa contains large numbers of organized lymphoid tissue (lymphoid follicles), termed
Peyer’s patches. The Peyer’s patches serve as both a primary and secondary lymphoid organ. Peyer’s
patches are critical components of the GALT.

CECUM AND LARGE INTESTINE

Similar to the stomach, the cecum and large intestine have a wide variation in size, shape and function
in domestic species. In species such as the cat, the cecum is small and relatively inconspicuous,
whereas species such as the horse and rabbit have large, well-developed ceca. This is largely attributed
to function: the horse and rabbit are hindgut fermenters. Regardless of the functional and gross
anatomic variations, the mucosas of the cecum and large intestine of most species are histologically
similar.
Unlike the small intestine, the cecal and large intestinal mucosa lack villi. Instead, the mucosa is
composed of densely arranged straight tubular glands (colonic glands). Colonic glands are lined by
enterocytes and goblet cells (see small intestine) with a much higher density of goblet cells than in
the small intestine. The base (crypts) of the glands are analogous to the small intestinal crypts of
Lieberkuhn and epithelial proliferation occurs in this population of epithelial cells.
Similar to the ileal Peyer’s patches, the cecum and large intestine contains abundant, well-organized
lymphoid tissue in the mucosa.
The rectal mucosa is similar to the large intestine in histologic appearance.

OVERVIEW

The liver is the largest visceral organ in the body, accounting for roughly 1-4% of total body weight,
depending on species (3-4% in carnviores and 1-2% in herbivores). The liver is arranged into distinct
lobes, each of which is encased by a thin, translucent layer of mesothelium (Glisson’s capsule). The
number of liver lobes varies among different species. Canines and felines have five liver lobes, and
herbivores have four liver lobes. The number of liver lobes does not represent function but is a
reflection of species diversification.

HEPATIC FUNCTIONS

Detailed discussion of the hepatic physiology is beyond the scope of this book. However, understanding
the roles of the liver is necessary when considering the microscopic anatomy.
Nutritional metabolic functions
The liver functions in the modification and transport of nutritional molecules, and therefore plays a
critical role in energy metabolism. This includes the generation, breakdown, modification, and storage
of nutritional molecules including glucose/glycogen, proteins, and lipids.
Xenobiotic metabolism
Xenobiotics include any compounds that are “foreign” to an animal. An example of xenobiotics are
medications such as the class pain relief drugs referred to as NSAIDs (NSAIDs = non-steroidal antiinflammatory drugs), but xenobiotics also include non-therapeutic compounds.
Xenobiotics are metabolized by hepatocytes via biotransformation, the process by which xenobiotics
are chemically modified and excreted into bile. Hepatocytes are rich in cytochrome P450, a metabolic
enzyme responsible for biotransformation. Biotransformation of a xenobiotic aims to render the
agent less toxic and soluble for excretion. Occasionally, activation of the xenobiotic during
biotransformation may result in an intermediate compound that is more toxic than the original form,
leading to toxicity! Nonetheless, hepatocytes are the workhorses of xenobiotic biotransformation, and
as such, they serve a major protective role in preventing the build-up and toxicity of xenobiotics.
Production of circulating plasma proteins
Hepatocytes produce many of the most abundant circulating plasma proteins including albumin,
lipoproteins (LDL, VLDL, and HDL), and glycoproteins. These hepatocyte-produced proteins function
in diverse areas such as energy and molecular transport and inflammation. The liver is also the
primary source of proteins of the coagulation cascade. Hepatocytes produce almost all of the clotting
factors (except Factor VIII, produced by endothelium) required in the coagulation cascade, including
fibrinogen, prothrombin, antithrombin III, Protein C and Protein S.
Storage and conversion of vitamins and minerals
The liver is a major site of storage and conversion of various vitamins and minerals that include
Vitamin A (retinol), Vitamin D, Vitamin B12, Vitamin K, iron and copper.

Bilirubin metabolism
The liver receives red blood cell fragments from the spleen and further processes these products for
recycling or excretion. Hemoglobin from red blood cells is broken down into heme and globin. The
iron containing heme is further processed into bilirubin. Hepatocytes conjugate bilirubin, converting
uncojugated (insoluble) bilirubin to conjugated (soluble) bilirubin, and is excreted and incorporated
into bile to be excreted into the gastrointestinal tract.

CELLS OF THE LIVER

Hepatocytes
The liver parenchyma is primarily comprised of hepatocytes. Hepatocytes are polygonal epithelial
cells with abundant eosinophilic, granular cytoplasm and large, centrally located round nuclei.
Hepatocyte nuclei often contain a prominent nucleolus. Binucleated hepatocytes (= containing two
nuclei) are not uncommon.
Hepatocytes contain many mitochondria and have extensive smooth and rough endoplasmic
reticulum and Golgi apparatus, all of which contribute to the eosinophilic staining of their cytoplasm.
However, the microscopic appearance of hepatocyte cytoplasm can vary based on the nutritional status
of the animal (recall that the liver plays a major role in energy and nutrient metabolism). The most
common cytoplasmic changes are due to intracytoplasmic glycogen and lipid. Histologically, glycogen
appears as irregular, poorly-defined non-staining (clear) spaces within the cytoplasm. In contrast,
lipid appears as either a single, large non-staining, sharply-defined cytoplasmic vacuole or as multiple
variably-sized non-staining vacuoles. Both glycogen and lipid are largely “washed-out” during routine
processing of histology slides, which accounts for their lack of staining in tissue section. While both of
these changes can be physiologically normal (or clinically inconsequential), excessive accumulation of
lipid within hepatocytes can be pathologic, and is referred to as hepatic lipidosis.
Hepatocytes are arranged in radiating cords (hepatic cords) approximately one to two cells in
thickness. Adjacent hepatic cords are separated by vessels: the sinusoidal capillaries (sinusoids).
These capillaries are lined by endothelial cells, which are difficult to appreciate in normal histologic
section due to their flattened nuclei. More on hepatic architecture as well as the vasculature and blood
supply to the liver will be discussed later in this chapter.
Ito cells
Ito cells are also known as stellate cells, fat storing cells, or lipocytes. Ito cells reside in the
perisinusoidal region known as the space of Disse. The space of Disse is the narrow region located
between endothelial cells and hepatocytes. These cells are identified histologically by their large lipid
vacuoles. Ito cells function in the uptake, storage and maintenance of vitamin A (retinol), as well as the
production of extracellular matrix (collagen types I and III), regulation of sinusoidal blood flow, and
hepatic tissue repair following injury.
Kupffer cells
Kupffer cells are phagocytes (“phago” = eating, “cyto” = cells) derived from monocytes and located

131

Ryan Jennings and Christopher Premanandan

within the vascular spaces of hepatic sinusoids lining the endothelial surfaces. These Kupffer cells
function in removing aged red blood cells from circulation and in phagocytizing and removing bloodborne microbes or endotoxins absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract. Histologically, Kupffer cells
are individualized round cells within sinusoids that are difficult to identify on histology unless they
contain phagocytized cytoplasmic material, such as red blood cells.
Oval cells
Oval cells are pluripotent stem cells that, due to their ability to differentiate into several different cell
types (“pluri” = several), serve a primary role in the repopulation of hepatocytes and other hepatic
cells (e.g. biliary epithelium) following hepatic injury. These cells are not readily identifiable in normal
tissue sections.
Pit cells
Pit cells are short-lived granular lymphocytes that reside within hepatic sinusoids and contribute to
immunity.

HEPATIC BLOOD SUPPLY

The liver is unique in that it receives blood from two sources: the hepatic artery and the portal vein.
As these vessels enter the liver, their terminal branches run alongside branches of the bile ducts and
course together throughout the liver parenchyma within portal triads (triad = three = hepatic artery,
portal vein, bile ductule). Note that lymphatics also run within portal triads.
Portal veins are identified as larger, blood-filled spaces with a thin to inapparent vessel wall. Hepatic
arteries are smaller in diameter but have a more well-developed smooth muscle wall. Blood from both
the hepatic arteries and portal veins empty into the adjacent peri-portal hepatic sinusoids and flows
towards the central vein.
The portal vein supplies the majority of blood to the liver. The portal circulation is a venous system
that drains blood from the gastrointestinal tract, gall bladder, spleen, and pancreas. Venous blood
coming from the gastrointestinal tract contains not only digested nutrients, but also toxins and,
frequently, microbes. A major role of the liver in receiving this portal circulation is to metabolize these
nutrients and eliminate or mitigate these toxins and microbes.
The hepatic artery delivers highly-oxygenated blood to the liver. However, once within the liver,
blood from the hepatic artery and the portal vein empty into the hepatic sinusoids, combining highly
oxygenated blood (hepatic arterial supply) with poorly oxygenated blood (portal vein supply). As a
result, hepatocytes receive blood with reduced oxygenation. Further, when considering that blood
flows from the portal triad towards the central vein, blood arriving to hepatocytes surrounding the
central vein is relatively poorly oxygenated. These concepts are important in the understanding of
liver pathology and how regions of the liver are differentially more susceptible to hypoxia.
The hepatic sinusoid endothelium is fenestrated, containing spaces between adjacent endothelial
cells. These gaps in the endothelium allow passage of nutrients and other small compounds into
the perisinusoidal space (space of Disse) where hepatocytes are able to take up these compounds.
Microvilli on the surface of hepatocytes provide additional surface area for absorption of these
molecules. Additionally, proteins and lipoproteins produced by hepatocytes are transferred into
circulation in these perisinusoidal spaces.

THE BILIARY SYSTEM

Production and transport of bile
The main function of the biliary system is the transportation of bile from the liver to the gut. Bile,
produced by hepatocytes, is composed of water, cholesterol, bile pigments (bilirubin), electrolytes
(sodium, potassium, chloride, bicarbonate, etc.), and bile salts. Bile salts (bile acids) serve as
emulsifying agents useful for the digestion and absorption of lipids and lipid soluble vitamins (e.g.
vimatin A and vitamin K) from the intestinal tract.
In contrast to blood flow, the direction of bile flow is from centrilobular (nearer the central vein)
towards the portal triads. Bile is produced by hepatocytes and secreted into bile canaliculi, narrow
channels formed between the cellular membranes of adjacent hepatocytes. These bile canaliculi are
extensive and connect to form a highway for bile transport, all flowing towards the portal triads. As the
bile canaliculi join near the periphery of the lobules, they form into larger canals (also known as the
Canals of Hering). The Canals of Hering empty into bile ductules, located within portal triads. Each
portal triad contains one or several bile ductules.
Bile ductules have a central lumen lined by a single layer of cuboidal epithelial cells. Bile ductules
from portal triads course through the liver and connect to form increasingly larger caliber structures,
bile ducts, that are lined by short to tall columnar epithelium. These bile ducts will eventually empty
into the hepatic duct, which empties into the cystic duct and gallbladder (dogs, cats, ruminants) or
common bile duct (species that lack gallbladders, such as horses and alpacas).
Gallbladder
The gallbladder is a blind-ended, sac-like organ attached to the visceral surface of the liver. The
gallbladder receives, stores and concentrates bile entering from the liver. In response to a fatty meal,
the enteroendocrine cells of the duodenum secrete cholecystokinin, a hormone that stimulates smooth
muscle contraction and release of bile from the gall bladder.
The structure of the gallbladder wall is multilayered, similar to the intestinal tract. The luminal
mucosal surface is lined by simple columnar epithelium. Beneath the epithelium lies a vascular-rich
lamina propria. External to the lamina propria is the muscularis externa, composed of randomly
oriented smooth muscle bundles. Occasionally, diverticula or invaginations of the mucosa can extend
in the muscularis externa. External to the muscularis externa lies the adventitia.

STRUCTURAL ORGANIZATION OF THE LIVER

Knowing the individual cellular and structural components of the liver, we now consider the structural
organization of the liver. There are two useful ways to describe the histological architecture of the
liver: lobules or acini.
Hepatic lobule (Kiernan’s lobule)
The lobular organization of the liver is one of the more histologically relevant ways to understand
hepatic architecture. The two major structural landmarks to consider when reviewing the
organizational aspects described below are the central veins and the portal triads. The central vein lies
within the central of the hepatic lobule. Each central vein has multiple portal triads that provide blood
supply to that region. Therefore, you can easily orient yourself by first identifying either a central vein
(the center of a lobule) or identifying a portal tract (the periphery of a lobule).
The hepatic lobule is observed as a hexagon-like structure where the central vein is located at the
center and the hepatocytes form radiating cords from the central vein, similar to the spokes of a wheel
radiating from the central hub. At the outside “corners” of the hexagon are portal triads.
The hepatocellular regions within the classical lobule include portal, midzonal and centrilobular.
For instance, portal hepatocytes are those closest to the portal triads, and centrilobular hepatocytes
surround the central vein.
The pig liver contains increased amounts of fibrous connective tissue that bridges portal tracts,
forming a band that highlights the perimeter of the lobule and illustrates the lobular organization of
the liver.
Hepatic acinus (Acinus of Rappaport)
Whereas the lobular organization is based on the physical organization of structures within the liver,
the hepatic acinus is based more on function. The acinus (plural: acini) highlights the hepatic blood
flow and metabolic activity, and is particularly useful when considered liver disease or pathology.
The acinus is shaped as a triangle. The central vein is located at the point of the triangle and the
base is at the outer edge, with the other two point of the triangle associated with portal triads. In this
model, hepatocytes are defined by zones. Hepatocytes in zone 1 (also called the periportal zone) are
located closest to the portal areas and are the first to receive oxygen and nutrient rich blood. These
hepatocytes are metabolically active and involved in cholesterol synthesis, fatty acid oxidation and
bile acid production. In contrast, hepatocytes in zone 3 (centrilobular) receive oxygen and nutrient
depleted blood and are a major effector of glycolysis, lipogenesis, and xenobiotic biotransformation

137

(highest cytochrome p450 concentration). Zone 2 (midzonal) hepatocytes have considerable
regenerative potential and this region contains the greatest number of oval cells.

KEYWORDS

Please familiarize yourself with these keywords before you start reading the chapter:

Club cells (Clara cells)
Cuboidal epithelial cells with apical microvilli located within and distal to bronchioles.
Club cells are rich in metabolic enzymes (cytochrome P450 enzymes) and therefore
serve a major role in the biotransformation of inhaled xenobiotics (see hepatocyte xenobiotic
biotransformation).
Goblet cells
Columnar epithelial cells that produce and secrete mucin, a glycoprotein that is a major
constituent of mucus. Histologically, goblet cells have swollen, basophilic to poorly staining
cytoplasm (representing cytoplasmic mucin vesicles). Goblet cells are abundant within the
respiratory tract and gastrointestinal tract.
Nasal turbinates
Scroll-like structures within the nasal cavity that are composed of a core of thin bone surrounded
by connective tissue and lined by respiratory epithelium. The nasal turbinates function to help
warm and humidify air and trap particulates.
Olfactory epithelium
Tall, pseudostratified sensory epithelium within the caudal portions of the nasal cavity that
contains a population of chemoreceptor cells, olfactory receptor cells, that generate the sensation
of smell.
Respiratory epithelium
A pseudostratified mucosal epithelium composed of columnar epithelial cells with apical cilia
often admixed with goblet cells. This epithelium is characteristic of the upper respiratory tract
(nasal cavity, sinuses, nasopharynx), eustachian tube, trachea, and large bronchi.

Veterinary Histology

Type I alveolar cells (type I pneumocytes)
Flattened squamous epithelial cells that line pulmonary alveoli and facilitate gas exchange.
Type II alveolar cells (type II pneumocytes)
Polygonal to cuboidal epithelial cells within alveoli that secrete pulmonary surfactant and readily
divide following tissue injury to type I alveolar cells.

142

OVERVIEW

The primary functions of the respiratory system are 1) smell, 2) air conduction, and 3) the exchange
of oxygen and carbon dioxide between the animal and the environment, referred to as respiration.
Respiration occurs at the air-blood interface, which lies at the most distal part of the respiratory tract.
Although this exchange of oxygen and carbon dioxide is the ultimate functional goal of the respiratory
tract, air must first be transported to this air-blood interface. Therefore, the two crucial functions
of the respiratory tract are air conduction and respiration. The importance of considering these two
roles is apparent during respiratory diseases in which interference with either air conduction (such as
obstructive respiratory disease) or the air-blood interface (such as bacterial bronchopneumonia) result
in life-threatening hypoxia.
Clinical discussion of the respiratory tract is generally divided into the upper respiratory tract and
lower respiratory tract. The upper respiratory tract is comprised of the nasal cavity and nasopharynx,
whereas the lower respiratory tract includes the larynx, trachea, bronchi, bronchioles, and alveoli.
Histologically, there is much overlap between the upper and lower respiratory tract, and therefore, the
distinction of upper vs lower respiratory tract is not reinforced in the discussion to follow. Instead,
regions of air conduction and gas exchange have important functional and histologic distinctions, and
this categorization will be utilized for the purpose of the discussion to follow.

AIR CONDUCTION: NASAL CAVITY, PARANASAL
SINUSES, AND VOMERONASAL ORGAN

Nasal Cavity
The paired external apertures of the nasal cavities in our domestic species are termed the external
nares (nostrils). During inspiration, air enters through the nares into the most rostral segment of
the nasal cavity: the nasal vestibule. The vestibule of most species is lined by keratinized stratified
squamous epithelium that may contain hair follicles and other adnexa.
The stratified squamous epithelium of the vestibule abruptly transitions into to the characteristic
respiratory epithelium. Traditional respiratory epithelium is ciliated, pseudostratified columnar
epithelium. Respiratory epithelium is primarily composed of these ciliated columnar epithelial cells
with basal nuclei and interspersed with moderate numbers of goblet cells. Goblet cells secrete mucus,
and are characterized by cytoplasm filled with poorly staining, basophilic material (mucin).
Respiratory epithelium lines the luminal surface of the nasal cavity, including the nasal turbinates.
The nasal turbinates are scroll-like structures within the nasal cavity that are formed by a thin core
of bone. The lamina propria and submucosa lie below the respiratory epithelium. The lamina propria
may contain variable numbers of tubuloalveolar secretory glands. Similar to the salivary glands of
the gastrointestinal tract, these glands may be comprised of serous cells, mucous cells, or a mixture
of serous and mucous cells. These glands secrete into ducts that communicate with the surface
epithelium.
Although the majority of the surface area of the nasal cavity mucosa is respiratory epithelium,
portions of the more caudal regions of the nasal cavity are covered by olfactory epithelium. Whereas
most of the nasal cavity is directed at physical air conduction, olfactory epithelium is a specialized
epithelium that facilitates the sense of smell. Olfactory epithelium is tall, pseudostratified epithelium
that contains three distinct cell types: olfactory receptor cells, sustentacular cells, and basal cells.
Olfactory receptor cells are modified neurons and chemoreceptor cells interspersed within the
olfactory epithelium. The cell bodies of these olfactory receptor cells reside within the epithelium
and have apical cilia that project onto the surface of the epithelium. These cilia are not readily
distinguishable on microscopy. Nerve fibers (axons) extend from the olfactory receptor cells into
the lamina propria and synapse with other axons to form collectively form olfactory nerves. These
olfactory nerves, in turn, pass through perforations in the cribriform plate of the skull and enter the
olfactory bulb of the brain. In this way, odors are detected by olfactory receptor cells and transmitted
via axons to the brain where these odors are converted to the sense of smell.
Sustentacular cells are histologically similar to respiratory epithelium and have apical microvilli.

145

Ryan Jennings and Christopher Premanandan

These cells provide structural and metabolic support to the epithelium. Basal cells are cuboidal to
short polygonal cells that reside adjacent to basement membrane.
Paranasal sinuses
The sinuses are bone-encased, air-filled spaces within the skull that communicate with the nasal
cavity. Species such as the horse have well-developed and distinct paranasal sinuses that include
the frontal, dorsal conchal, ventral conchal, rostral maxillary, caudal maxillary, and sphenopalatine.
Species such as the dog have only frontal and maxillary sinuses. Regardless, the paranasal sinuses are
lined by respiratory epithelium similar to that elsewhere in the nasal cavity and respiratory tract.
Vomeronasal organ
The vomeronasal organs are paired (left and right) specialized chemoreceptor organs adjacent to the
nasal septum within the nasal cavity of domestic species. Structurally, the vomeronasal organ is
a thick layer of sensory epithelium partially encased by cartilage and associated with an abundant
vascular supply. Histologically, the sensory epithelium is similar to that of olfactory epithelium, with a
thick pseudostratified epithelium that contains three populations of cells: receptor cells, sustentacular
cells, and basal cells. The vomeronasal receptor cells, similar to olfactory receptor cells, are modified
neurons that detect pheromones (e.g. pheromones in urine) and transmit to the brain via efferent
axons. Access of air to this region of the nasal cavity is facilitated through passage through ducts
in the dorsal aspect of the oral cavity (roof) of some species by the behavioral action of the flehmen
response. This behavior looks different in different species. Examples include the curling of the upper
lip in ungulates, chattering of the mouth in dogs (tonguing), and the open-mouthed posture of cats.

AIR CONDUCTION: LARYNX, TRACHEA, BRONCHI
AND BRONCHIOLES

Larynx
The larynx is a complex, tubular organ, the structure of which is primarily composed of elastic
and hyaline cartilage and skeletal muscle. The larynx connects the naso- and oro-pharynx with
the trachea, functioning in air conduction, vocalization, and in obstructing passage of ingesta into
the trachea during deglutition. The epithelium of the larynx is variable, but is generally stratified
squamous epithelium in the rostral segment proximal to the pharynx, and ciliated pseudostratified
columnar (respiratory) epithelium elsewhere. The lamina propria subjacent to the laryngeal
epithelium contains secretory glands.
Trachea, bronchi and bronchioles
The luminal (mucosal) surface of the trachea is lined by ciliated, pseudostratified columnar epithelium
(i.e. respiratory epithelium) interspersed with goblet cells. The lamina propria and submucosa also
contain small mixed (mucous and serous) glands and smooth muscle. The trachea is supported by
a series of C-shaped cartilaginous (hyaline cartilage) rings. Dorsally, the ends of the incomplete
cartilaginous rings of the trachea are connected by a band of smooth muscle: the trachealis muscle.
Externally, the trachea is surrounded by a thin layer of fibrovascular connective tissue (adventitia).
Distally, the trachea divides into the left and right mainstem bronchi. Bronchi are histologically
similar to the trachea. They are lined by ciliated, pseudostratified columnar epithelium (respiratory
epithelium) and interspersed with goblet cells. The walls of bronchi are also supported by cartilage
and smooth muscle. The smooth muscle of airways mediates bronchoconstriction, the process of
contraction and subsequent narrowing of the airway lumen. Bronchoconstriction is mediated, in
part, via mast cell-derive histamine, and bronchoconstriction is a life-threatening effect of massive
histamine release (e.g. anaphylaxis). Finally, the lamina propria of bronchi also contain moderate
numbers of mixed glands. These are particularly abundant in cats. As the bronchi extend deep into the
pulmonary parenchyma, they continue to bifurcate, giving rise to smaller caliber (diameter) secondary
and tertiary bronchi.
Eventually, bronchi give way to smaller conducting airways, bronchioles. Bronchioles are thinwalled airways lined by variably ciliated or non-ciliated columnar epithelium. The walls are composed
of tangentially arranged smooth muscle. Bronchioles lack cartilage and glands which, along with their
smaller size, distinguish them histologically from bronchi.

The transition between regions of air conduction (i.e. bronchioles) and regions of air exchange
(i.e. alveoli) in the lung progresses through sequentially distinct segments; from proximal to distal:
terminal bronchioles, respiratory bronchioles, alveolar ducts, alveolar sacs, and alveoli.

AIR CONDUCTION: TERMINAL BRONCHIOLES,
RESPIRATORY BRONCHIOLES AND ALVEOLAR
DUCTS

Terminal bronchioles, respiratory bronchioles and alveolar ducts
Bronchioles open into short segments called terminal bronchioles, which are thin-walled branches
of the bronchioles. Terminal bronchioles transition into respiratory bronchioles. Respiratory
bronchioles are lined by two types of epithelial cells: ciliated columnar cells and club cells (also
known as Clara cells). Histologically, club cells are cuboidal epithelial cells that lack cilia but contain
microvilli (difficult to appreciate microvilli on histopathology). Club cells are rich in cytochrome
P450, an enzyme responsible for the biotransformation of inhaled and circulating toxins. P450 is also
abundant and highly active in hepatocytes, another cell type responsible for the biotransformation
of toxins. Secondary functions of the club cells include production of pulmonary secretions and as
progenitor (proliferating) cells that may repopulate after cell loss and/or injury.
The walls of respiratory bronchioles are discontinuous, forming openings into alveolar ducts.
Alveolar ducts are conducting regions are lined by knob-like projections of cuboidal epithelium that
cover small amounts of smooth muscle. These projections of cuboidal epithelium are often located
on either side of the entrance into alveolar sacs, which branch from the “walls” of the alveolar ducts.
Alveolar sacs are indistinct segments that open into individual alveoli.

GAS EXCHANGE: ALVEOLI

Alveoli
Alveoli (singular: alveolus) are the site of gas exchange in the lung. Alveoli are thin-walled, saclike structures lined by a single layer of flattened squamous epithelial cells: type I pneumocytes.
This extremely thin nature of the type I pneumocytes facilitates gas exchange across their surface.
The alveolar wall, or septum, consists of capillaries and minimal connective tissue support. As such,
alveolar septal capillaries are almost in direct apposition with the type I pneumocyte. The type
I pneumocyte and capillary lumen are separated only by the basement membrane of the type I
pneumocytes, minimal or absent septal connective tissue, the basement membrane of the capillary
endothelium, and the endothelial cells themselves. This provides an extremely narrow gap through
which gases can diffuse, providing for efficient exchange of oxygen and carbon dioxide between
alveolar spaces and capillaries.
In addition to the type I pneumocytes, alveoli also contain several additional cell types. Type II
pneumocytes are cuboidal epithelial cells frequently residing in the corners of alveolar spaces. Type
II pneumocytes are responsible for the secretion of surfactant. Surfactant is a fluid composed of
phospholipids and proteins that coats the surface of alveolar spaces to reduce surface tension, allowing
for alveoli to expand and remain open. In addition, type II pneumocytes play a crucial role in tissue
repair in the lung. Following damage to type I pneumocytes, type II pneumocytes proliferate and
differentiate into type I pneumocytes, thereby restoring alveolar structure.
Finally, alveolar spaces contain a resident population of macrophages, alveolar macrophages.
Normally, these macrophages are located in close apposition to type I pneumocytes, and can be
mistaken for type II pneumocytes. These macrophages, which are relatively low in number, readily
phagocytize debris within alveoli, which can include surfactant, edema fluid, red blood cells, and
pathogens (e.g. bacteria). Low numbers of macrophages are also normally present within the alveolar
septal interstitium.

PLEURA

Pulmonary pleura (Visceral pleura)
The outer surface of the entire lung parenchyma is covered by the visceral pleura. The visceral
pleura is composed of a thin, loose connective tissue. The outer surface is lined by specialized
squamous-like cells, mesothelium. Mesothelial cells appear histologically similar to epithelial but
are mesoderm derived, and express proteins consistent with both mesenchymal (stromal) cells and
epithelial cells. The mesothelium produces a lubricating substance that acts to reduce friction between
the visceral pleura and the pleura coating the thoracic body wall (parietal pleura) during respiration.
The connective tissue of the visceral pleura is contiguous with the connective tissue of the pulmonary
lobular septae that course through the pulmonary parenchyma.

The lungs receive two distinct sources of blood supply: pulmonary arterial supply and bronchial
arterial supply. The pulmonary arterial circulation originates from the right side of the heart.
Histologically, pulmonary arteries and veins are often adjacent to bronchi and larger bronchioles.
These vessels progressively divide into smaller caliber vessels and, terminally, form a network of
capillaries that course through alveolar septa and function in gas exchange. These capillaries then
form into venules, then veins that progressively become larger in size and exit the lung, entering the
left atrium. Bronchial arteries originate from the thoracic aorta and also course along large airways,
providing much of the blood supply to these structures, as well as the pleura.

Please familiarize yourself with these keywords before you start reading the chapter:

Cortical labyrinth
Histologically apparent substructure of the renal cortex composed of glomeruli and
proximal tubules.
Lobe (renal)
An anatomical unit of the kidney composed of the medullary pyramid and the overlying cortex.
Lobule (renal)
An anatomical subunit of a renal lobe that is centered on a single medullary ray.
Medullary rays
Collections of renal tubules coursing from the renal cortex to the medulla and centered around a
collecting duct.
Ultrafiltration (renal)
The process by fluid and molecules selectively pass across the glomerular filtration barrier
(plasma -> urine). The ultrafiltrate is dependent on concentration gradients and hydrostatic blood
pressure.

OVERVIEW AND ANATOMY

Urine is formed in the kidney and delivered to the bladder by ureters. Urine exits the urinary bladder
through the urethra. On longitudinal section, the kidney can be divided into the cortex, medulla, renal
papilla and renal pelvis. The concave border of the kidney is known as the hilum (or hilus), where the
renal vessels (artery and vein) and nerves enter the kidney. At this location, the renal pelvis funnels
into the ureter.
In addition to dividing the kidney into cortex and medulla, it can also be separated into lobes and
lobules as well as medullary rays and the cortical labyrinth. Lobes are easiest to visualize in cattle
and pigs wherein every single renal papilla drains the overlying medulla and surrounding cortex. In
unipapillary kidneys (e.g. carnivores), the distinction between lobes is more difficult to appreciate.
A lobe can be further divided into lobules, which are composed of a single medullary ray and the
surrounding cortical labyrinth, both of which are described in more detail later.
Normally, the cortex comprises approximately 2/3 of the renal parenchyma and contains most of the
glomeruli and numerous cross sections of tubules. The medulla only has tubules and duct and does
not contain glomeruli.
An ultrafiltrate of urine is formed in the cortex and is modified during its course through the
medulla. The structures within the cortex, primarily the glomeruli, drive filtration and the tubules
within the medulla are responsible for reabsorbing, excreting and concentrating the urinary filtrate.
The nephron is the functional anatomic unit of the kidney. Each nephron has a glomerulus and
a long tubule which becomes a duct before emptying into the pelvis. The glomeruli, drive filtration
whereas the tubules are responsible for reabsorbing, excreting and concentrating the urinary filtrate.
The main components of the nephron include:
• Glomerulus
• Bowman’s space (surrounded by Bowman’s capsule)
• Proximal convoluted tubule
• Proximal straight tubule
• Loop of Henle (descending limb and ascending limb)
• Distal convoluted tubule
• Collecting duct (cortical and medullary)
• Papillary duct

THE GLOMERULUS

The glomerulus is a complex web of capillaries derived from the afferent arteriole. Glomeruli can be
located in the cortex of the kidney or the corticomedullary junction.
Blood that is traveling through the capillary loops is selectively filtered across the glomerular
filtration barrier to form an ultrafiltrate of the plasma. This filtration barrier permits passage of
small and some medium sized molecules while blocking the passage of large molecules. Filtration is
driven by hydrostatic and oncotic pressure. The former pushes fluid and solutes out of the capillary
lumen, whereas the latter retains fluid. The major players of the glomerular filtration barrier include:
endothelium, glomerular basement membrane, and podocytes.
The glomerular endothelial cells are characterized by numerous fenestrations. Using high
magnification with transmission electron microscopy (TEM), one can visualize the endothelial
cytoplasm, which has numerous fenestrations or transcytoplasmic holes that allow passage of the
plasma from the vasculature to the interstitium. Another important component of the endothelial cell
is the glycocalyx, which covers the luminal surface of the cell. The glycocalyx is composed of negatively
charged glycoproteins and proteoglycans (sugar-protein molecules). filtering out negatively charged
molecules, leukocytes, red blood cells, platelets and larger proteins.
The glomerular basement membrane (GBM) is a product of the fusion of the basement membrane
produced by endothelial cells and podocytes (described below). Using TEM, one can see that the GBM
is trilaminar (i.e., three-layered), and these components include, from the endothelial to the podocyte
aspect, the lamina rara interna, lamina densa, and lamina rara externa. This part of the filtration
barrier is also negatively charged and restricts passage of larger proteins.
Podocytes are epithelial cells. Aside from providing structural and functional stability of the
glomerulus, the podocyte is a vital component of the glomerular filtration barrier. They are located
on the “abluminal” (i.e., opposite of capillary lumen) surface of the capillary loop. Podocytes have
numerous processes, similar to tentacles, that surround the capillaries. Each process has many smaller
processes (foot processes or pedicles) that are oriented perpendicularly to the capillary wall and attach
to the underlying GBM. The foot processes interdigitate with foot processes of adjacent podocytes.
The space between the foot processes forms the slit diaphragm. The slit diaphragm is a molecular
sieve, and it provides an additional filtration barrier based mainly on size exclusion. Aside from being
part of the filtration barrier, podocytes also help maintain the shape of the capillary loop shape by
counteracting intraglomerular pressure. Lastly, podocytes produce vascular endothelial growth factor
(VEGF) to which is a molecule that the glomerular endothelial cell needs to survive.

Additional structures of the glomerulus
Mesangium
Collectively, the mesangial cells and the glomerular extracellular matrix that they produce constitute
the mesangium. The mesangium provides structural integrity to the glomerular tuft and modulates
glomerular perfusion through smooth muscle-like activity. These cells are also involved in the
production and secretion of cytokines in response to glomerular injury. Histologically, there are 2 to 3
mesangial cell nuclei beneath each capillary loop.
Bowman’s space and Bowman’s capsule
Once the ultrafiltrate is formed, the fluid enters Bowman’s space, the space between the capillary tuft
and Bowman’s capsule. Bowman’s capsule is lined by parietal epithelium, which is simple squamous
epithelium. The ultrafiltrate drains toward the urinary pole and enters the proximal convoluted tubule.
Efferent / Afferent Arterioles
The blood enters the glomerular tuft via the afferent arteriole and exits via the efferent arteriole. These
vessels are immediately adjacent to one another at the vascular pole, which is at the opposite end
of the glomerulus from the urinary pole. These vessels can contract or dilate, changing the amount
of blood that flows into the glomerular tuft. Importantly, the contraction can occur in response to
molecular signals from the immediately adjacent tubules.

RENAL TUBULES: MECHANISMS OF
REABSORPTION

The kidneys filter/excrete waste and reabsorb essential electrolytes, nutrients, and fluid (ultimately to
maintain homeostasis). Tubular reabsorption occurs via multiple mechanisms of transport.
Mechanisms of tubular reabsorption
Passive transport
Passive transport is movement of a molecule without utilizing energy. In this form of transport,
solutes move from a high concentration to low concentration (along their concentration gradient).
Active transport
Active transport requires energy in order to transfer a solute against an electrochemical gradient.
There are two major forms of active transport in the tubules:
• Primary active transport involves movement of a solute against an electrochemical gradient
at the expense of ATP (energy). An example of this type of transport is seen with the Na+/K+
ATPase pump on the basolateral cell membranes of the tubules. Sodium ( low intracellular
concentration, high extracellular concentration)is pumped out of the cell into the
interstitium. At the same time, potassium is moved into the cell from the interstitium, also
against its concentration gradient.
• Secondary active transport is a form of active transport where two different molecules interact
with a single membrane transporter to be translocated across the cell membrane. One
molecule is transported against its electrochemical gradient, whereas the other molecule is
transported along its electrochemical gradient. The SGLT2 carrier protein is an example,
transporting Na+ with its gradient and glucose against its gradient. This type of secondary
transport relies on the Na+/K+ ATPase pump described aboveto ensure that the intracellular
Na+ is low enough to pull in additional Na+ and bring glucose along with it.
Pinocytosis
Pinocytosis is mechanism of transport where the cells take up large particles and fluids by “drinking”
extracellular fluid. The cellular membrane invaginates to enclose filtrate within a vesicle that pinches

161

Ryan Jennings and Christopher Premanandan

off from the membrane and enters the cell cytoplasm. It then fuses with lysosomes to form
endolysosomes where the larger molecules in the fluid are degraded and digested into molecular
components.
Receptor-mediated endocytosis
Receptor mediated endocytosis is a variant of pinocytosis; however, in this process a larger protein will
bind to a receptor in the membrane before the vesicle forms.

PROXIMAL TUBULES

The major function of the proximal tubules (PT) is to reabsorb fluid, electrolytes and nutrients. There
is a convoluted portion, which is tortuous and often seen as rings of epithelial cells lining a basement
membrane, and a straight portion which is more linear running from the cortex to the medulla. This
PT is responsible for roughly 98% of glucose and 65% of sodium reabsorption. The PT is located in the
cortex and is composed of simple columnar epithelium joined together by tight junctions. The cellcell junctions are permeable to small molecules yet permit transport from the tubular lumen into the
interstitium in a paracellular manner. The apical brush border is a characteristic and distinguishing
feature of the PT. The brush border is composed of microvilli which facilitate reabsorption of small
peptides and simple sugars (monosaccharides and disaccharides).

→ FIGURE(S): Proximal Renal Tubules

LOOP OF HENLE

The thin descending limb of Henle travels from the PT and forms a hairpin loop to become the
thin ascending limb and the thick ascending limb before terminating into the distal convoluted
tubule. The thin limbs (descending and ascending) are lined by simple squamous epithelium. The thin
descending loop is highly permeable to water (which is easily transferred to the interstitium) and less
permeable to solutes. On the other hand, the thin ascending limb is highly permeable to sodium but
impermeable to water. During this part of the journey, the ultrafiltrate loses water to the interstitium
as it travels through the thin descending limb, and the remaining urine becomes hyperosmotic. As
the urine travels up the ascending limb, sodium passively diffuses out of the tubular lumen into the
interstitium. This creates a hyperosmotic (“salty”) medullary interstitium. The thick ascending limb is
composed of simple cuboidal epithelium. This portion of the tubule can be distinguished from the PT
by lack of a brush border. At this point, the ultrafiltrate has lost enough solutes to become hypoosmotic
as it reaches the thick ascending limb.

DISTAL CONVOLUTED TUBULE

The distal convoluted tubule (DCT) is composed of simple cuboidal epithelium. The DCT is located
in the cortex and corticomedullary junction. The functions of this segment include fine-tuning ion
concentrations and acid-base balance to maintain homeostasis. The epithelium of the DCT is also
involved in reabsorption or excretion of bicarbonate and hydrogen ions to maintain blood pH. It can
secrete potassium into the tubular lumen under the influence of the hormone aldosterone and reabsorb
calcium in response to parathyroid hormone.

→ FIGURE(S): Distal Convoluted Tubules

COLLECTING DUCTS

The collecting ducts span the renal cortex and medulla and concentrate the urine. The collecting
duct is composed of simple cuboidal epithelium. There are two distinct cell types present in the
collecting tubules: intercalated cells and principal cells. The principal cells are the predominant
cell type with short sparse microvilli and contain Na+/K+ ATPase pump and aquaporin, which is an
anti-diuretic hormone [ADH]-regulated water channel. The intercalated cells are fewer in number, but
they are important for the regulation of blood pH. These cells will adjust bicarbonate or hydrogen ion
reabsorption.

PAPILLARY DUCTS

These are continuous with the collecting ducts and their lumens widen slightly as they reach the renal
papilla. The epithelium lining these tubules transitions smoothly to the urothelium that lines the renal
papilla.

THE RENAL INTERSTITIUM

The interstitium is composed of fibrocytes and occasional macrophages. The interstitial cells produce
the extracellular matrix (collagen and glycosaminoglycans) , which surround the nephrons, duct, blood
vessels, and lymphatics.
Peritubular capillaries
The vessels that are responsible for reabsorbing all of the molecules that cross the tubular epithelial
cells are called peritubular capillaries. In order to do their job efficiently, they need to be immediately
adjacent to the tubules. If there is an aggregate of fibroblasts or inflammatory cells, then it is more
difficult for them to take up the products delivered to them by the tubular epithelial cells. Likewise,
this intricate tortuous network of capillaries delivers oxygen and glucose to the tubules as well. Loss
of the peritubular capillaries or an increase in the distance between the tubules and the capillaries will
therefore impact tubular epithelial energy balance and functionality.
Vasa recta
In addition to the peritubular capillaries that surround the cortical tubules, there is another aggregate
of thin-walled vessels known as the vasa recta. These vessels run alongside the Loop of Henle.

THE JUXTAGLOMERULAR APPARATUS

The juxtaglomerular apparatus (JGA) controls the rate of the glomerular blood flow depending on
various factors such as hydration, blood volume and ion concentration. The JGA includes the macula
densa and juxtaglomerular cells. The macula densa is a short segment of the distal convoluted tubule
that is located directly adjacent to the afferent and efferent arterioles at the vascular pole of the
glomerulus. The juxtaglomerular cells are within the interstitium between the macula densa and the
vascular pole. The macula densa cells sense sodium chloride concentration in the lumen and stimulates
the juxtaglomerular cells to synthesize and release renin into the bloodstream. This happens in
states of hypovolemia or low sodium chloride concentration in the blood (and in the urinary filtrate).
This activates the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) and triggers several key important
steps to help improve blood pressure. The release of renin in the bloodstream causes hydrolysis of
angiontensinogen to form angiotensin I. Angiotensin I is converted by angiotensin-converting enzyme
(ACE) to angiotensin II. Angiotensin II triggers the adrenal glands to produce and release aldosterone,
whichacts on tubules to upregulate sodium and water reabsorption back into the blood.

RENAL BLOOD SUPPLY

The cortex of the kidney receives the majority of renal blood flow. The renal artery enters at the hilum
of the kidneys and branches into the interlobar artery. The interlobar artery then travels between
the pyramids and continues as arcuate artery, which arches along the corticomedullary junction. The
interlobular artery is a stem off of the arcuate artery and travels through the cortex towards the
capsule. As the interlobular artery ascends towards the cortex, branches of afferent arterioles are sent
to each glomerulus. The afferent arterioles give rise to the capillaries that form the glomerulus. The
glomerular capillaries reunite and form the efferent arteriole which exits at the vascular pole. The
efferent arterioles of cortical nephrons give rise to the peritubular capillaries. As discussed previously,
in the juxtamedullary nephrons, the peritubular capillaries form the ascending and descending vasa
recta. The peritubular capillaries and vasa recta then drain into the interlobular vein, which unites with
others to form the arcuate vein. Then the interlobular vein exits the kidney as the renal vein.

URINE ELIMINATION

Once urine passes through the collecting ducts and enters the renal papilla, it will be delivered by the
ureters to the urinary bladder. Urothelium lines the ureters, bladder, and the urethra. The urothelium
is also referred to as transitional epithelium because it can transition from a plump rounded epithelium
in a contracted bladder to a flattened epithelium in a distended urine-filled bladder. The urothelium
is enveloped by a lamina propria and smooth muscle that is arranged in two layers (inner longitudinal
and outer circular). Urinary bladder innervation it is under control of both the parasympathetic and
sympathetic nervous system. Contraction of the urinary bladder occurs with the parasympathetic
system via the pelvic nerve. The sympathetic nervous system relaxes the bladder smooth muscle and
contracts the urethral smooth muscle (to keep urine from leaking out) via the hypogastric nerve.

OVERVIEW

The male reproductive tract functions to propagate germ cells by development of haploid spermatozoa
in the testes and delivery of the spermatozoa to the female reproductive tract. The male reproductive
tract consists of the gonads (testes), the tubular genitalia (epididymis, ductus deferens and urethra)
and the external genitalia (penis and scrotum).

DEVELOPMENT AND STRUCTURE OF THE
GONADS AND TUBULAR GENITALIA

Gonadal development
The first step in gonadal development takes place when the primordial germ cells migrate from
the allantois (portion of the placenta) to the genital ridge, the structure that will become the
undifferentiated gonad. The gonadal ridges are protuberances within the coelomic cavity of the
developing fetus. The structures of the primitive gonad that are not composed of primordial germs
cells (i.e. somatic gonadal cells) are derived from local mesenchymal cells, coelomic epithelium and
cells derived from mesonephric tubules. Ultimately Sex determination of the undifferentiated gonad is
dependent on the presence of the sex determining region Y (SRY) gene found on the short arm of the
Y chromosome. Therefore without the Y chromosome and SRY gene, differentiation to a female gonad
will take place.
Development of tubular genitalia
The formation of male tubular genitalia is directed by the hormones secreted by the developing
testes. The secretion of testosterone from the Leydig cells and paramesonephric inhibitory hormone
from the Sertoli cells induce the differentiation of the Wolffian body (mesonephros) and the Wolffian
ducts (mesonephric ducts). Paramesonephric inhibitory hormone inhibits the development of the
paramesonephric ducts (Muellarian ducts). In the absence of developing testes and the presence
of estrogens, the paramesonephric ducts develop into the uterus, uterine tubes and cranial vagina.
Estrogen also stimulates the development of female external genitalia, the caudal vagina, the vestibule
and the clitoris (more in chapter 13).

THE TESTES

The testes have two functions. The first is to produce spermatozoa and the second is to function as
an endocrine organ. A portion of mesonephric cells develop into cords of tissue called seminiferous
cords which incorporate the migrating primitive germ cells into their structure. The seminiferous
cords, also known as medullary cords, develop eventually into Sertoli cells, while mesodermal cells in
between seminiferous cords develop into Leydig cells (interstitial cells). Sertoli cells secrete factors
that regulated spermatogenesis and spermiogenesis, the function of Leydig cells. They also secrete
tubular fluid and produce inhibin that regulates hormone production. Leydig cells are responsible for
testosterone production.
Spematogenesis
Germ cells residing in the developing testes are referred to as spermatogonia. Successive rounds
of mitotic division increase the number of cells that can end as the terminally differentiated
spermatogonia, known as spermatozoa. Spermatogenesis is quiescent until puberty and the process
takes place within the seminiferous tubules.
The spermatogenic process can be divided into the mitotic, meiotic and metamorphic periods.
Spermatogenesis takes places at different stages throughout the length of the seminiferous tubules.
The mitotic phase of spermatogenesis results in increased numbers of spermatogonia, allowing for
an enlarged replicative pool before the first meiotic division. Two types of spermatogonia are present.
Type A spermatogonia have a large round nucleus with condensed chromatin, peripheral nucleoli
and a nuclear vacuole occasionally. These spermatogonia maintain the replicative pool of germ cells.
Type B spermatogonia have dispersed chromatin, central nucleoli and no nuclear vacuole. These
spermatogonia eventually produce spermatozoa.
Formation of spermatocytes represents the meiotic stage of spermatogenesis. Primary
spermatocytes are derived from the spermatogonium and are still diploid cells. Primary spermatocytes
undergo the first meiotic division to become haploid cells called secondary spermatocytes. These soon
enter the second meiotic division to become spermatids.
Spermiogenesis
The conversion of spermatids to spermatozoa represents the metamorphic stage known as
spermiogenesis. During this process, granules in the Golgi vesicles coalesce to form a large vesicle
(acrosomal vesicle) containing a structure called the acrosome. The acrosomal vesicle expands to
cover half of the nucleus. The acrosome and the acrosomal vesicle form the (acrosomal) head cap.
Simultaneously, centrioles, mitochondria and the Golgi remnants migrate to the cytoplasm opposite

177

Ryan Jennings and Christopher Premanandan

to the acrosomal cap. One centriole elongates to become the developing flagella. The centrioles also
interface with the nucleus to form the neck. During the entire process, the spermatid elongates and it
nucleus condenses.
The mature spermatozoon is divided into 5 sections
1. Head
2. Neck – where the centriole migrated and connects the head to the tail
3. Midpiece
4. Principal piece
5. Tail or end piece
The stage of spermatozoon development is variable between regions of seminiferous tubules and
progression is cyclical in nature. This variability is known as the spermatogenic wave.
The activity in the seminiferous tubules is primarily regulated by the products of the hypothalamus
and the anterior pituitary. Luteinizing hormone (LH) and Follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) are
secreted by the anterior pituitary. FSH initiates spermatogenesis, while LH stimulates testosterone
secretion that is required for spermatozoon maturation.
Testicular structure
A capsule composed of dense collagenous material that encloses the testicle is called the tunica
albuginea. Most species contain a vascular layer within the tunica albuginea. Horses often contain
smooth muscle fibers within the tunica albuginea. The double layer of simple squamous epithelium
and mesentery directly covering the testes and apposed to the tunica albuginea is the tunica vaginalis.
The parenchyma of the testicle is divided into lobules by loose connective tissue bands (septuli
testes). These lobules are composed of tubules lined by stratified epithelium composed of maturing
germ cells (spermatogonia, spermatocytes, spermatids and spermatozoa) and Sertoli cells. These
tubules are supported by a basement membrane which contains fibroblasts and myofibroblasts. The
Sertoli cells are triangular or oval in shape with a prominent nucleolus and fine chromatin. These
tubules (seminiferous tubules) constitute the exocrine portion of the testes. The maturing germ
cells are stratified so that the spermatogonia constitute the basilar compartments closest to the
basement membrane. The spermatocytes, spermatids and spermatozoa constitute the next layer or the
apical compartment with the spermatocytes adjacent to the basilar compartment and the spermatozoa
closest to the lumen.
The endocrine portion of the testes is comprised by the Leydig or interstitial cells which are present
between seminiferous tubules primarily located in the extra-tubular connective tissue. These cells are
responsible for testosterone secretion.
As spermatozoa mature in the seminiferous tubules, they are guided out of the testes by the rete
testis (randomly arranged) or tubuli recti (straight tubules) which are connected to the seminiferous
tubules. These tubules eventually lead to the extragonadal tubular structures.

MALE TUBULAR GENITALIA

These structures are derived from the caudal remnants of embryonic structures called the mesonephric
ducts (Wolffian ducts). They function to transport spermatozoa towards the urethra.
The structures that are derived from the mesonephric ducts include:
1. Efferent ductules – These structures connect the rete testes to the ductus epididymis. They
consist of 6-20 coiled tubules lined by ciliated columnar epithelium which assist in the
movement of spermatozoa.
2. Ductus epididymus – This coiled tube functions to store spermatozoa. Some maturation of
spermatozoa also takes place here. The epididymus and its associated connective tissue and
muscle are divided into the head (where the efferent ductules terminate), the body and the
tail. The tail is continuous with the ductus deferens. The mucosa of the epididymus is lined
by ciliated pseudostratified columnar epithelium. Under the lamina propria lies a thin band
of smooth muscle (muscularis mucosa) which is slightly thicker at the tail. The submucosa of
this structure is continuous with the connective tissue of the tunica albuginea.
3. Ductus (vas) deferens – This structure is lined by pseudostratified columnar epithelium. In
contrast to the previous tubular structures, the lamina propria lies on top of a thick smooth
muscle tunica muscularis which is divided into inner and outer layers. The ductus deferens
contains an outer serosa.

MALE ACCESSORY SEX GLANDS

The accessory sex glands function to: 1. nourish spermatozoa, 2. activate spermatozoa, 3. clear the
urethral tract before ejaculation, 4. produce secretions that assist in transport to the female
reproductive tract, 5. in some species (rodents), form a plug that helps retain spermatozoa in the
female reproductive tract.
There is variation between species in terms of presence, size, location and function of these glands.
The glands are derived from outpouchings of the ductus deferens or the urethra during development.
The structure of most of the accessory sex glands is arranged as branched tubular or tubuloalveolar
pattern which are arranged in lobules. Each lobular structure drains into the ductus deferens or
urethra.
The four major accessory sex glands are the ampulla, the vesicular glands (seminal vesicles) and the
bulbourethral glands.
1. Ampulla – This gland is an enlargement of the terminal portion of the ductus deferens and
consists of branched tubular or tubuloalveolar glands without a specialized excretory duct.
The ampulla is fully developed in ruminants, and horses where the glandular structures are
located in the lamina propria. These glands are absent in dogs, cats and swine.
2. Vesicular glands (seminal vesicles) – These glands are typically paired and are composed
of simple columnar glandular epithelium which is arranged in lobules. The excretory ducts
are lined by stratified columnar epithelium. Vesicular glands are absent in carnivores but
present in horses, swine and ruminants.
3. Prostate glands – The prostate glands consists of the main body and a disseminate portion.
The body is surrounded by a thick collagenous capsule while the disseminate portion is
embedded in loose collagenous matrix extending along the dorsal aspect of the urethra and
eventually extends laterally and ventrally to join the body. The gland is histologically
composed of tubuloalveolar structures composed of low columnar to cuboidal cells, have
apocrine gland type secretory activity and have acidophilic granules and lipid droplets in the
epithelial cytoplasm. The body is well developed in carnivores and horses while the
disseminate portion is better developed in cattle and swine. Rams do not have a well
developed prostate.
4. Bulbourethral glands – These are paired structures located dorsolaterally to the pelvic
urethra and are composed of paired tubuloalveolar glands with columnar epithelium. The
ducts of this gland are lined by columnar, pseudostratified or transitional epithelium. All
domestic animals except for dogs have bulbourethral glands. The mucus production from

MALE GENITAL LIGAMENTS

The gubernaculum develops during testicular development as a column of fibrous connective tissue
between the inguinal regions to the caudal pole of the testis. The abdominal component of the
gubernaculum is covered by mesentery. The extra-abdominal component is initially attached to the
abdominal wall, but moves caudally as the inguinal rings and scrotal sac develop. During late gestation
or the early post-natal period (depending on the species), the intraabdominal developing testes
descend through the inguinal rings to the scrotum while a portion of the gubernaculum shortens and
eventually becomes the scrotal ligament. The mechanism in which the gubernaculum condenses and
shortens is not completely understood.

MALE EXTERNAL GENITALIA

The major external structures are the penis, penile urethra and scrotum. Embryologically, the cloacal
folds fuse ventrally to form the genital tubercle. The genital tubercles elongate and the accompanying
urogenital folds fuse to convert the groove in between the folds to a tube which becomes the urethra.
The surrounding genital tubercles form the penis. Proliferating tissue lateral to the urogenital folds
called the genital swellings form the scrotum. The midline region of fusion between the genital
swellings becomes the medial raphe which separates the testes. The prepuce is formed from loose
connective surrounding the penis.
The urethra is divided into the pelvic and penile portions. Both portions are lined by transitional
epithelium. Under the lamina propria, portions of the tunica muscularis is formed from striated muscle
rather than smooth muscle. A tunica adventitia is present in this region. The mucosa of the penile
urethra changes to squamous epithelium at the external opening. Glands are present in the lamina
propria, particularly in the stallion and boar. The tunica muscularis is composed of smooth muscle in
the penile urethra.
The anatomy of the penis can vary tremendously by tissue composition and organization between
species. In general terms, the penis can be divided into the glans, the body and the roots. The glans is
covered by a reflection of preputial skin. The tissue of the glans can be composed of vascular erectile
tissue, cartilage in bulls or in the case of the carnivores, bony tissue. The body is enclosed by a
capsule which is thick and prominent in swine and ruminants (fibrous penis) and thin in carnivores
(vascular penis). The subcapsular tissue encloses vascular erectile tissue (corpora cavernosa and
corpus spongiosum). This tissue is composed of collagenous tissue and vascular spaces which can
expand due to the presence of elastin fibers in the connective tissue. The roots are the most proximal
aspects of the penis and are similar in structure to the body.
The scrotum is enclosed in haired skin with an underlying layer of smooth muscle (tunica dartos).
The scrotum contains invaginations of peritoneal mesentery (the parietal and visceral vaginal tunics)
which enclose the testes, epididymus, ductus deferens and associated vascular structures.

OVERVIEW

The female reproductive system is comprised of the gonads (ovaries), the tubular reproductive tract
(uterine tubes, uterus, cervix, vagina and vestibule) and the external genitalia. While the mammary
glands are not part of the female reproductive tract, it is a tissue integral to the reproductive biology of
the female. Learning histology of the female reproductive system can be difficult as tissues can change
in morphology in response to hormonal stimulation. But understanding the structure of the tissue
greatly assists in understanding the estrus cycle in domestic animals.

GONADAL DEVELOPMENT

The first step in gonadal development takes place when the primordial germ cells migrate from
the allantois (portion of the placenta) to the genital ridge, the structure that will become the
undifferentiated gonad. The gonadal ridges are protuberances within the coelomic cavity of the
developing fetus. The structures of the primitive gonad that are not composed of primordial germs
cells (i.e. somatic gonadal cells) are derived from local mesenchymal cells, coelomic epithelium and
cells derived from mesonephric tubules. Ultimately Sex determination of the undifferentiated gonad is
dependent on the presence of the sex determining region Y (SRY) gene found on the short arm of the
Y chromosome. Therefore without the Y chromosome and SRY gene, differentiation to a female gonad
will take place.

DEVELOPMENT OF TUBULAR GENITALIA

The formation of male tubular genitalia is directed by the hormones secreted by the developing testes.
The secretion of testosterone from the Leydig cells and paramesonephric inhibitory hormone from
the Sertoli cells induce the differentiation of the Wolffian body (mesonephros) and the Wolffian ducts
(mesonephric ducts) (refer back to chapter 12). Paramesonephric inhibitory hormone inhibits the
development of the paramesonephric ducts (Muellarian ducts). In the absence of developing testes
and the presence of estrogens, the paramesonephric ducts develop into the uterus, uterine tubes
and cranial vagina. Estrogen also stimulates the development of female external genitalia, the caudal
vagina, the vestibule and the clitoris.

THE OVARY

Ovarian function and development
The ovaries function 1.) to produce ova, 2.) as an endocrine gland (i.e. secrete mediators into the
bloodstream to act at a distant site). During ovarian development from the primordial gonad,
structures termed sex cords form which are likely derived from mesothelial cells forming the gonads.
These linear plates of tissue incorporate the migrating germ cells into their structure.
Oogenesis refers to the development of oocytes within the ovary. The process can be divided into
three stages – fetal, prepuberty (resting stage) and puberty.
During fetal oogenesis, the sex cords break down and the germ cells undergo enhanced mitosis. In
most mammals, this prolonged mitotic activity ceases before or soon after birth. These cells arrest in
prophase of meiosis I (primary oocytes), are enclosed in basal lamina surrounded by follicular cells and
are referred to as primordial follicles.
The following concepts must be understood regarding oogonia and oocytes in relationship to the
prepubertal, pubertal and post pubertal periods.
1. Primary oocytes enter a resting phase in which full maturation does not occur until
stimulation by gonadotrophic hormones takes place (puberty).
2. Large numbers of post mitotic germ cells (oogonia) and primary oocytes undergo atresia or
death in the prenatal period, the prepuberty period and the post puberty period.
Following puberty, the primary oocyte surrounded by follicular cells enters follicular maturation when
stimulated by gonadotrophic hormones. This maturation occurs in cyclical waves. In regards to the
developing follicle, the surrounding follicular cells proliferate, become stratified and change
morphology from a spindle shaped cell to a cuboidal phenotype (called granulosa cells).
Completion of the first meiotic division results in the formation of the secondary oocyte and
extrusion of the first polar body. This change typically takes place before ovulation, except in dogs,
where formation of the secondary oocyte takes place after ovulation. The second meiotic division takes
place during fertilization and results in the extrusion of the second polar body.
Ovarian structure and histologic organization
The ovary is divided anatomically into the cortex and medulla. The cortical aspect of the ovary
is covered by cuboidal epithelium during development that converts to squamous epithelium with
age. The cortical parenchyma is composed of follicles (oocytes and follicular cells), interstitial cells
and collagenous connective tissue stroma. The ovarian medulla contains large arteries and veins,

Veterinary Histology

194

lymphatics, nerves embedded in a loose collagenous matrix. The rete ovarii are also present in the
medulla, which are cords of cells found in the medulla homologous to the rete testis.
In most domestic species, the cortex contains the developing follicles. However in the horse, the
anatomy of the ovary is reversed. In this species, the follicular development takes place in the region
of the ovary corresponding to the medulla. A concavity forms in the ovary called the ovulation fossa,
corresponding to the site in the equine ovary which ovulation occurs. In addition, ovaries in the equine
fetus and neonates are markedly enlarged compared to the size of the animal. This enlargement in
attributed primarily to hyperplasia and hypertrophy of the interstitial cells. Subsequent atrophy takes
place post-natally.
Follicular development
Development of the ovarian follicle is a sequential process which is primarily directed by the influence
of gonadotrophins (follicle stimulating hormone [FSH] and luteinizing hormone [LH]) and can be
variable between species.
The sequence of follicular development is 1.) primordial follicle, 2.) primary follicle, 3.) secondary
follicle, 4.) tertiary follicles.
• Primordial follicles contain a primary oocyte and are surrounded by a single layer of
flattened follicular cells.
• Primary follicles still contain a primary oocyte but the follicular cells become more cuboidal
and are now known as granulosa cells. Follicular (granulosa) cells proliferate (membrane
granulosa) but are separated from the oocyte by a thick periodic acid Schiff (PAS) positive
basement membrane called the zona pellucida. The organized stromal cells around the
follicles are called theca cells.
• Secondary follicles start develop spaces between granulosa cells that coalesce to eventually
form a large space called the follicular antrum. The granulosa cells secrete PAS positive
material into these spaces. The stromal cells surrounding the follicle form two layers, the
theca interna and the theca externa.
• Graafian (tertiary, mature) follicles are large preovulatory follicles which bulge from the
surface of the ovary. Once the follicular antrum is formed, the oocyte is surrounded by a
remnant of granulosa cells called the cumulus oophorus. The cells of the cumulus oophorus
immediately adjacent to the oocyte are known as the corona radiata.

Ryan Jennings and Christopher Premanandan

Endpoints of follicular development
A follicle only has two potential fates, atresia or ovulation. Follicular atresia or degeneration of
the developing follicle can take place any time during development. During this process the oocyte
liquefies with subsequent collapse of the zona pellucida and the wall of the follicle. Fibrous tissue,
phagocytes and vascular tissue replace the region of the atretic follicle while the remnants of the theca
interna undergo hypertrophy. Ovulation involves the rupture of the follicle and release of the oocyte.
This is induced by a surge of luteinizing hormone released by the anterior pituitary. Only the corona
radiata is present on the oocyte after release from the follicle.
Consequences of ovulation
The corpus hemorrhagicum is formed soon after ovulation from hemorrhage into the remnants of
the follicular structure resulting in a large blood clot. The remaining granulosa cells and cells of the
theca interna undergo hypertrophy, proliferate and invade the corpus hemorrhagicum, transforming
into granulosa lutein cells and theca lutein cells respectively (luteinization). These cells organize
into a highly vascular glandular organ called the corpus luteum (yellow body). The yellow color
of this structure is imparted by intracellular accumulations of a pigment, lutein, in some species
(equine, bovine, canine and feline). In ewes and sows, other lipid pigments impart the yellow color.
If fertilization successfully takes place, the corpus luteum will be maintained. However, if fertilization
does not take place, the corpus luteum will degenerate and be replaced by fibrous connective tissue
forming the corpus albicans. The corpus luteum is the main source of progesterone, which is important
for the maintenance of pregnancy and synergistic with estrogen during estrus.

FEMALE TUBULAR GENITALIA

Female tubular genitalia is composed of the uterine tubes (oviducts), the uterine horns, the uterine
body, the cervix and the vagina.
The uterine tubes are projections from each of the uterine horns which interface with each ovary.
These structures provide transport of the oocyte towards the uterine horns and provide a site for
fertilization. The uterine tubes are divided anatomically into the infundibulum, the ampulla and
the isthmus. The mucosa is typically composed of ciliated columnar epithelium although in some
species (bovine and porcine) it is composed of ciliated pseudostratified epithelium. The cilia move the
fertilized ova towards the uterine horns.
The uterus is responsible for the maintenance of pregnancy and the transport of semen, although in
some species, such as the horse, it is also the receptacle for semen. In other species, semen is deposited
in the cervix or vagina. The shape of the uterus is highly species dependent. The bicornuate uterus has
two large uterine horns, a uterine body and a single cervix – porcine, canine and feline, ruminants and
equine. However, between species, the bicornuate uterus varies in structure. In canines, felines and
swine, the uterine horns are highly developed. In cattle, sheep and horses, the uterine horns are poorly
developed.
Rodents and rabbits have a duplex uterus that has two uterine openings with corresponding cervices
which open into a common vagina.
The cross sectional anatomy of the uterus is divided into the endometrium, the myometrium and
the perimetrium. The endometrium is typically covered with simple columnar epithelium although in
some species, pseudostratified or cuboidal epithelium can be present as well. This epithelium rests on
a loose collagenous tissue called the lamina propria. Beneath the mucosa, simple or branched tubular
uterine glands extend from the lamina propria to the submucosa.
The endometrium is divided histologically into 3 layers.
1. Stratum basalis – Deepest layer adjacent to the myometrium.
2. Stratum spongiosum – Broad intermediate layer with a spongy appearance.
3. Stratum compactum – Superficial layer with a compact stromal appearance.
Some species variation exists between the distribution of glands in the endometrium. The ruminant
endometrium contains large vascularized protrusions (caruncles) which have relatively little glandular
tissue. In addition, species variation exists in the degree of coiling at the distal ends of the glands. The
depth of the gland penetration into the lamina propria and submucosa is also dependent on the stage
of the estrus cycle.
The myometrium is analogous to the muscular layers found in the small and large intestine. It

197

Ryan Jennings and Christopher Premanandan

is composed of smooth muscle arranged in an inner circular layer and an outer longitudinal layer.
Between the smooth muscle layers is a prominent vascular layer.
The perimetrium is the outermost layer and is composed of loose connective tissue, lymphatics and
small arteries and veins with an overlying mesothelial surface.

→ FIGURE(S): Female Tubular Genitalia

The cervix lies between the uterine body and the vaginal vault where it acts as a barrier during
certain phases of the estrus cycle and during pregnancy.
The mucosa of the cervix is thrown up in longitudinal folds and its mucosal composition varies
between species. In the canine, the mucosa is composed of stratified squamous epithelium. The
bovine cervix is contains large numbers of goblet like cells with interspersed ciliated epithelium. The
structure of the cervix exhibits species variability as well. The bovine cervical mucosa contains ringlike folds which span its circumference. Longitudinal ridges are present which intersect the rings.
Small ruminants (sheep and goats) have more prominent and numerous ridges which make uterine
catheterization more difficult. The equine cervix is shorter (~ 6 cm) and has mucosal folds which are
prominent at the caudal aspect but disappear cranially. The canine cervix is also short and has a dorsal
fold of mucosa which extends into the vagina as well as transverse grooves. The porcine cervix is long
(~ 25 cm) and has numerous interdigitating mucosal prominences that occlude the lumen.
The vagina is composed of four layers, the mucosa, the lamina propria, the muscularis and the
adventitia. It is formed from the embryonic vaginal plate and the fused ends of the paramesonephric
ducts. In the cranial vagina, the adventitia is replaced by a serosa. The mucosa in all species, except the
cow, is composed of stratified squamous epithelium. The bovine vagina is lined by stratified columnar
epithelium with interspersed goblet cells. Initially, the lumen of the vagina is separated from the
vestibule by a thin membrane called the hymen.

The vaginal mucosa undergoes cyclical variation depending on the stage of the estrus cycle and this

is of primary value in the canine. By examining the cytology from the vaginal vault, the approximate
stage of estrus can be predicted.
1. During anestrus (period of inactivity), the vagina contains large numbers of non-cornified,
round to oval epithelial cells with large uniform nuclei. A few neutrophils may be present.
2. During proestrus, large cornifying epithelial cells with shrunken or absent nuclei are
present. Neutrophils are rare. Erythrocytes and bacteria may be present.
3. During estrus, large cornified epithelial cells predominate. Many cells will not have nuclei.
Erythrocytes are reduced.
4. During diestrus, the smaller non-cornified epithelial cells reappear and neutrophils are
dominant. Erythrocytes are rare.

FEMALE GENITAL LIGAMENTS

As the mesonephros degenerates (since it is a precursor to male tubular genitalia), the developing
ovaries and ductular genitalia is enveloped in folds of peritoneum. This structure is called the genital
fold and its divisions are named by the attached portions of the reproductive tract. The mesovarium
supports and suspends the ovaries in the peritoneum. The mesosalpinx attaches to the uterine tube
and portions of the ovary. The mesometrium (broad ligament of the uterus) supports the uterus in the
pelvic canal and abdomen.

FEMALE EXTERNAL GENITALIA

The vestibule forms from the urogenital sinus and, as mentioned previously, it is separated from the
vagina initially by the hymen. The vestibule develops as a structure separate from the vagina and fuses
with it later in development. The vestibule, however, is similar in structure to the vagina and is lined by
stratified squamous epithelium. Below the lamina propria of this structure is a tunica muscularis with
an inner circular and outer longitudinal smooth muscle layer. The outer muscular layer is composed
of two different muscles, the constrictor vestibule and the constrictor vulvae.The vestibular glands
are tubuloalveolar glands present in the constrictor vestibule muscle and are homologous to the male
bulbourethral glands and the urethral glands.
The clitoris is homologous to the penis. It is composed of the body, glans and preputial covering.
The body is composed of cavernous tissue, smooth muscle and adipose tissue surrounded by a thick
collagenous capsule. The glans is composed of cavernous tissue (in canines and horses) or highly
vascular connective tissue. The preputial covering is the reflection of the stratified squamous epithelial
lined vestibular mucosa.
The labia are simply folds of skin just caudal to the opening of the vestibule. The histologic structure
is similar to what you will read in the integumentary chapter.

AVIAN FEMALE REPRODUCTIVE TRACT

In contrast to most mammalian reproductive systems, the avian reproductive tract allows internal
fertilization, but allows survival and development of the ovum outside of the body. Only the left
ovary and oviduct are retained in the adult female animal. The avian ovary is not as compact as the
mammalian ovary, but it does have a cortex and a poorly defined medulla. Ovarian follicles can reach
a diameter of 30 mm, contain a single oocyte with a single layer of granulosa cells and a think theca
interna and externa. A corpus luteum is not formed after ovulation.
The oviduct is divided into the infundibulum, the magnum, the isthmus and the shell gland. The
infundibulum is the extension of the oviduct with a vascularized mucosa lined by pseudostratified
columnar. The magnum deposits the egg white and is lined by ciliated and nonciliated columnar cells.
The lamina propria contains branched tubular glands. The isthmus is responsible for formation of
the shell membranes and is similar in structure to the magnum. The shell gland is essentially the
avian uterus but does not allow for ova implantation. This organ is lined by pseudostratified columnar
epithelium with sporadic ciliated cells. The avian vagina is similar in histologic structure to the shell
gland and contains glands which store sperm in preparation for fertilization.

THE MAMMARY GLAND

The mammary gland functions primarily to produce milk and colostrum for neonates. However, there
are many anatomic differences between the mammary glands of different species. This organ is
composed of compound tubuloalveolar glands. The secretory component of these glands has two
parts. The first part is composed of columnar cells that form the alveolar epithelium. The second
part is composed of columnar cells forming the intralobular ducts. The cells typically exhibit apocrine
secretion. Inactive secretory epithelium often has a lower profile or more cuboidal appearance. The
space between alveoli and ducts is taken up by loose, well vascularized connective tissue. Myoepithelial
cells or epithelial cells with contractile properties are present around alveolar structures. Sloughing
epithelial cells, macrophages and much smaller numbers of other leukocytes are also seen. Concretions
of casein and cellular debris also known as corpora amylacea can be seen in glandular structures.
One or two alveoli drain into each intralobular duct. The intralobular ducts drain into a lobular
duct and several lobular ducts drain into and form a lobar duct. Each lobar duct drains a lobe of the
mammary gland. Many lobar ducts drain into the lactiferous sinus, the common chamber at the base of
each gland. The sinus is constricted at its distal end (annulus) where the sinus enters the teat structure.
The sinus narrows to the lactiferous sinus also known as the teat canal. While most of the lactiferous
sinus is lined by stratified columnar epithelium, the canal is lined by stratified squamous epithelium.
In lactating mammary glands, the number of alveoli is far greater than the numbers in inactive
mammary glands. The inactive glands have large amounts of glandular tissue replaced by fibrous
connective tissue and adipose. The larger ductal elements remain intact in these glands.

OVERVIEW

The eye itself can be divided into 3 concentric tunics plus the internal components. The three tunics
from the outside surface of the eye inward are, (1) the fibrous tunic (cornea and sclera), (2) the vascular
tunic (iris, ciliary body, and choroid) and (3) the neuroectodermal (nervous) tunic (retina). These
tunics inwardly decrease in size as they become more specialized. Internally, the eye contains the lens
and the aqueous and vitreous humors.
Below is a breakdown of the eye structure:

FIBROUS TUNIC

The fibrous tunic is comprised of 2 components, the clear cornea and the opaque sclera. They differ
primarily in the arrangement or organization of their collagen and water content with this accounting
for the difference in their transparency.
Cornea
The mammalian cornea is a transparent, avascular structure that functions to transmit and refract
light, and as a protective barrier for the internal ocular contents. Although the cornea is avascular,
it does contain nerve fibers. These are branches of the ophthalmic branch of cranial nerve 5 and are
primarily concentrated in the anterior third of the cornea.
In general, the cornea of various species is remarkably similar, differing in thickness, curvature, and
shape only. The cornea is thickest peripherally. The histologic layers of the cornea, from the outside
in, are the corneal epithelium, the corneal stroma, Descemet’s membrane and corneal endothelium.
Corneal Epithelium
The corneal epithelium is composed of a stratified squamous, non-keratinized cell layer.
Embryologically, the cells of the epithelium originate from surface ectoderm. The number of epithelial
cell layers varies in thickness with the species and increases in number towards the limbus. Epithelial
cells are anchored to each other by desmosomes and to the basement membrane by hemidesmosomes
and anchoring fibrils. External to the epithelium is the tear film. The tear film supplies oxygen to the
cornea and approximately 10% of the glucose used by the cornea. The epithelial cells are divided into
basal, wing, and superficial cells. The superficial cells have microvilli, microplicae, and a glycocalyx on
their surface to stabilize the tear film. Beneath the superficial cells are the wing cells that represent
a transition zone between the basal and superficial cells. A single layer of tall, columnar basal cells is
the deepest layer of the epithelium. These cells contain abundant glycogen stores and are the source
of cells for the renewal of the outer layers. The turnover rate of these cells is 7 days. In addition to the
outer layers of the epithelium, the basal cell layer is also responsible for the secretion of the basement
membrane. This membrane is composed of type IV collagen and glycosaminoglycans (GAG’s).
Stroma
The corneal stroma comprises 90% of the corneal thickness. It is composed of collagen fibers,
keratocytes, and GAGs that account for 22% of the stroma. The remaining 78% of the stroma is
water. The collagen fibers are regularly arranged in lamellar sheets and span the entire diameter

209

Ryan Jennings and Christopher Premanandan

of the cornea. These lamellae lie parallel to the corneal surface, but obliquely to adjacent lamellae.
The transparency of the cornea depends on the arrangement of these lamellae and the distance
between them. It is hypothesized that an interfiber distance of less than a wavelength of light allows
transmission with minimal interference. The normal collagen in the corneal stroma is type I and is
more heavily glycosylated than in skin. When injured this is replaced by type III collagen. Between
the corneal collagen fibers are flat cells termed keratocytes and GAGs. The keratocytes are capable
of fibroblast transformation and phagocytosis, but normally are a quiescent population of cells. The
GAGs of the stroma affect hydration, thickness, and transparency. Lymphocytes and Langerhans cells
are also reported in the cornea, especially near the limbus.
Descemet’s membrane
The posterior limiting membrane or Descemet’s membrane is a basal lamina secreted by the
endothelium . It is comprised of type IV collagen and is produced throughout life, continuing to
increase in thickness with age. It is insoluble except in strong acid or alkali and is more resistant to
collagenase than is the corneal stroma.
Endothelium
The innermost layer of the cornea is the endothelium. The origin of this layer is thought to be the
neural crest cells. The endothelium is a single cell layer of hexagonal cells, 15-20 um in diameter,
attached to each other by terminal bars. In most species these cells are capable of mitosis only very
early in life. The greatest cell density of the endothelial cells is in the neonate. Once damaged,
endothelial cells repair defects through enlargement and spreading rather than by replacement.
Sclera
The sclera constitutes the major portion of the fibrous tunic and joins the cornea at the limbus.
Anteriorly it is covered by bulbar conjunctiva beneath which is the episclera, the scleral stroma, and the
lamina fusca. The episclera is composed of loose bundles of collagen and elastic fibers, blood vessels,
nerves, fibroblasts and, depending on the species and color pattern, melanocytes. Like the corneal
stroma that of the sclera consists of collagen lamellae but unlike the cornea they are obliquely arranged
and lack uniformity. This lack of uniformity, along with the variability in collagen fiber diameter and
the relative deficiency in water-binding glycosaminoglycans’s, account for the lack of transparency to
the sclera. The sclera possesses several channels or emissaria to allow the passage of nerves and blood
vessels. Examples of these are the optic nerve, the vortex veins, long posterior ciliary arteries, and
the long and short ciliary nerves. These emissaria are weak points and are potential sites of rupture
following a trauma.

VASCULAR TUNIC

The vascular tunic is comprised of three distinct regions, (1) the iris, (2) the ciliary body, and (3) the
choroid. The vascular tunic is mesodermal in origin and is situated between the outer fibrous tunic and
the inner nervous tunic. The vascular tunic is also refered to as the uvea.
Iris
The iris is the anterior most portion of the vascular tunic and functions as a moveable diaphragm
between the anterior and posterior chambers. Embryologically, the iris is comprised of components
that originate from neural ectoderm, the sphincter and dilator muscles and the 2-layered posterior
epithelium, and mesodermal components that form the iris stroma. The pupil varies in shape between
species and can be circular (dog, rabbit), oval (horse, cow), or vertical (cat). This central portion of
the iris normally rest against the anterior lens surface and in the absence of this support, the iris will
tremble. The color of the iris can vary with species, age, and sex, and can even differ between eyes or
within eyes in the same animal. The color of the iris depends on the pigmentation of both the stromal
melanocytes and the posterior epithelium. In animals with blue eyes the pigment is absent in the
stroma, while in the albino it is lacking in both the stroma and the posterior epithelium.
The anterior border of the iris is often discussed as possessing an epi- or endothelial cell layer. This
is incorrect. The anterior border is formed by fibroblasts and melanocytes. The peripheral portion of
the iris inserts as the pectinate ligaments in the area where Descemet’s membrane ends. This angle
formed by the cornea and the root of the iris is termed the iridocorneal angle and is the entrance to the
trabecular meshwork, the site of outflow of the aqueous humor.
The iris stroma is a loose tissue comprised of collagen bundles, blood vessels, nerves, melanocytes,
fibroblasts, and the sphincter muscle of the iris. The blood vessels are endothelial lined structures with
a basement membrane, smooth muscle, and pericytes. The capillary endothelium is not fenestrated
and is part of the blood-eye-barrier.
The sphincter muscle is found within the iris stroma. It is smooth muscle in mammals and striated
in birds and lower vertebrates. As stated previously, it has its origin from neural ectoderm. It is
situated in the pupillary zone and varies in shape depending on the shape of the pupil. Contraction of
the sphincter muscle results in a decrease in the pupil diameter, termed miosis. The sphincter muscle
is innervated by parasympathetic fibers from the Edinger-Westphal nucleus, the fibers of which travel
with the third cranial nerve (oculomotor).
The posterior epithelium of the iris is actually 2 cell layers, both of neuroectodermal origin. Because
of their origin from the invaginating optic cup these cells are situated apex to apex and remnants of
the optic vesicle may occasionally persist between these cell layers. The posterior most cell layer is

211

pigmented and is continuous with the non-pigmented layer of the ciliary body and ultimately with
the neural retina. It is separated from the posterior chamber by a basal lamina. Adjacent, posterior
epithelial cells are attached by desmosomes and terminal bars to each other. The anterior epithelial
layer consists of a pigmented apical portion and a myoepithelial basal portion which forms the dilator
muscle of the pupil. The dilator muscle is a radially-arranged, smooth muscle and is innervated
primarily by sympathetic fibers.
In herbivores a structure termed the corpora nigra or granula iridica is found. This an extension of
the posterior epithelium into the pupil both dorsally and ventrally. These appear as 3-4 pigmented,
irregular masses. The superior ones are usually larger. They are a normal finding.
Ciliary Body
The ciliary body, like the iris, contains both neurectodermal and mesodermal tissue. It is divided into
2 parts, the anterior pars plicata and the posterior pars plana. In saggital section the ciliary body is
triangular in shape with its base at the iris and the apex posteriorly at the ora ciliaris retinae. The
pars plicata possesses 70-100 major ciliary processes and between these ciliary processes are valleys
in which can be found smaller minor processes. Each ciliary process contains a vascular core and is
covered by a 2-layer epithelium. The ciliary processes are the source of production of the aqueous
humor.
The posterior two layered epithelium of the iris continues over the ciliary body as the outer
pigmented and inner non-pigmented epithelia. As is the case in the iris, these epithelial cells are
arranged apex to apex. At the junction of the ciliary body and the retina, the single layered nonpigmented epithelium (NPE) continues as the multi-layered retina and the pigmented epithelium of
the ciliary body continues as the retinal pigment epithelium. Unlike in the retina and the iris, the two
cell layers of the ciliary epithelium are strongly attached to each other by terminal bars. In addition,
there are zonulae adherentes and zonulae occludens between the apices of the non-pigmented cells.
This is the site of the ciliary body blood-aqueous-barrier.
The lenticular zonules that support the lens originate in the pars plana and travel forward in the
valleys between the ciliary processes. The zonules ensheath the ciliary processes as they insert on
the lens capsule both anterior and posterior to the lens equator. The zonules appear to be elastic
microfibrils.
The pigmented cells are joined to each other by desmosomes and the intercellular space of these
cells is therefore permeable. The basal portion of the cell faces the ciliary body stroma and is covered
by a basal lamina. Beneath the pigmented cell layer is the stroma of the ciliary body. This is
mesodermal in origin and contains vessels, nerves, collagen bundles, smooth muscle, melanocytes,
and fibroblasts. The stroma of the ciliary processes is a highly vascularized connective tissue with
capillaries containing large fenestrations, 300-1000A. The ciliary muscle is smooth and in all primates
is comprised of 3 parts: the longitudinal, circular, and radial portions. This muscle is poorly developed
in most other mammals, with the longitudinal portion predominating. This muscle is primarily
innervated by parasympathetic fibers, but also has some adrenergic innervation. This is the muscle of
accommodation and serves to change the shape of the lens.

212

Choroid
The choroid is the third component of the uvea. It extends from the edge of the optic nerve to the
pars plana. The choroid is loosely attached to sclera. The choroidal stroma varies from being darkly
pigmented to a complete absence of pigmentation depending on the species, breed, and individual.
In those animals lacking pigmentation, the fundic reflex appears red and on ophthalmoscopic
examination the choroidal vessels are visible. The stroma itself is composed of collagen fibrils,
melanocytes, fibroblasts, nerves, and larger blood vessels. The majority of the vessels are veins with
arteries situated amongst them.
The capillary layer of the choroid, the choriocapillaris, is found in the inner portion just below
the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE). It is responsible for the nutrition of the RPE and the outer
retina and, in some species, for the entire retinal nutrition. The capillaries form a lobular network
and are comprised of typical fenestrated endothelial cells surrounded by a basal lamina that surrounds
and is shared by pericytes and smooth muscle cells. These lobules are supplied by a central arteriole
and are surrounded by a ring of postcapillary venules. Venous drainage from the choroid occurs in
four quadrants where blood collects in an ampulla and then drains via one of four vortex veins that
penetrate the sclera.
In addition to above structures, some species also contain a layer in the choroid, the tapetum
lucidum, situated between the larger choroidal vessels and the choriocapillaris. Because of its
location, the vascular communications between the larger vessels and the choriocapillaris must
traverse the tapetum. The tapetum is responsible for the so called “eye-shine” or bright, colored
reflection seen in certain species. It is situated in the superior one-half to one-third of the choroid.
The color of the tapetum varies with and within species and can be green, blue, yellow, orange, or
a variation of these. The tapetum is found in dogs, cats, ferrets, horses, ruminants, and nocturnal
animals. It is absent in humans, other primates, pigs, rabbits, rats, guinea pigs, and mice. The
tapetum can be cellular (dog, cat, ferret, and other carnivores) or fibrous (horse, ruminants, and other
ungulates).

NERVOUS TUNIC

The retina is the most complex of all the ocular tissues. The classic description of the retina includes
10 layers that, from the outside in, are as follows:
1. Retinal pigment epithelium (RPE)
2. Photoreceptor outer segments – Rods and Cones
3. Outer limiting membrane
4. Outer nuclear layer
5. Outer plexiform layer
6. Inner nuclear layer
7. Inner plexiform layer
8. Ganglion cell layer
9. Nerve fiber layer
10. Inner limiting membrane
Embryologically, the retina is neuroectodermal in origin and forms first as an optic vesicle and later
invaginates to form the optic cup. The posterior wall of the optic cup gives rise to the retinal pigment
epithelium (RPE), while the anterior wall gives rise to the remaining 9 layers of the retina. The space
between these layers that was present embryologically remains as a potential space and it is here,
between the RPE and the sensory retina, that retinal detachments usually occur. In humans, the retina
is mature at birth but, in many other species, the development of the retina continues postnatally.
In the dog and cat, the retina is not mature until approximately 3-5 weeks centrally and 8-9 weeks
peripherally.
Retinal pigmented epithelium (RPE)
The RPE is the homolog of the epithelium of the choroid plexus of the brain. It is a monolayer
of hexagonal cells which is continuous anteriorly with the pigmented epithelial layer of the ciliary
body and the anterior epithelium of the iris. External to the RPE is Bruch’s membrane and the
choriocapillaris. The inner apical surface of the RPE has numerous long villous processes that
surround the outer segment of the photoreceptors. There is no attachment between these cells, but an
acid mucopolysaccharide ground substance exists between them. The lateral RPE cell margins, near
the apical surface, have terminal bar attachments (zonula occludens, zonula adherens) which are one

Veterinary Histology

214

portion of the blood-retinal barrier. As the name suggests, the RPE contains melanin granules. These
are found predominantly in the inner third of the cytoplasm. An important exception to this is seen
in animals possessing a tapetum where the RPE overlying the tapetal portion of the choroid is nonpigmented.
Sensory retina
The sensory retina is thickest near the optic nerve and thins towards the periphery. External to the
sensory retina is the RPE and internally is the vitreous humor. The photoreceptors are in the outer
portion of the sensory retina and can be divided into the cell body, inner segment, and outer segment.
In addition, photoreceptors are divided into rods and cones based on their morphology, physiology,
and sensitivity. As suggested by their name, the rods are long and slender, while the cones tend to
have a shorter, wider appearance. The cones are further divided according to their spectral absorption
characteristics into the red-sensitive (570 nm), green-sensitive (540 nm), and the blue-sensitive (440
nm) cones.
Photoreceptors (first neuron layer)
This is the outermost cells of the sensory retina and is also known as the rod and cone layer.
In this layer, a photochemical process takes place to convert light to an electrical impulse occurs in
the outer segment. The nuclei of the photoreceptor cell forms the outer nuclear layer and the axons of
the photoreceptors synapse with processes of the bipolar neurons in the outer plexiform layer
The rods are highly sensitive to light. They provide minimal detail and are inactive during daylight
vision. The rods predominate in all portions of retina (except the fovea of birds and primates)
The cones are less sensitive to light. They provide more detailed vision, color vision and
predominant only in the fovea.
Integrating neurons (second neuron layer)
The integrating neurons receive input from the photoreceptors and transmit it to the ganglion cells.
The nuclei of these cells form the inner nuclear layer.
Ganglion cells (third neuron layer)
The ganglion cells receive input from the integrating neurons and transmit impulses to the brain. The
axons of the ganglion cells form the nerve fiber layer and converge at the posterior pole of the eye to
form the optic nerve
Muller cells
These are the supporting cells of the retina, however they do not participate directly in the electrical
impulse transmission. The nuclei of Muller cells lie in the inner nuclear layer among the nuclei of the
bipolar neurons

Retinal blood vessels
The microanatomy of retinal blood vessels varies according to species. Some species lack retinal blood
vessels entirely. The retinal blood vessels are located in the nerve fiber layer and nourish the only inner
third of the retina. The outer 2/3 of retina nourished by choroidal vasculature. The pattern of retinal
vessels varies among species, but in all species retinal vessels originate from or directly adjacent to the
optic nerve

VISION

Vision is a complex process that involves a photochemical reaction converting light into electrical
impulses. Light photons enter the eye through the cornea and pass through the transparent media of
the aqueous humor, the lens and the vitreous body. After passing through the sensory retina and the
retinal photoreceptors. Some of these photons are absorbed and converted to an electrical potential.
The remaining light passes through the RPE and choriocapillaris to the tapetum. The tapetum acts to
reflect light back to the retina and allow more photons to be absorbed by photoreceptors and converted
to an electrical potential.
These electrical impulses are transmitted to the bipolar neuron, modified then transmitted to the
ganglion cell. The axons of ganglion cells become part of the optic nerve. The optic nerve perforates
the sclera at the lamina cribrosa and proceeds toward the brain. The two optic nerves meet at the optic
chiasm.
Certain species possess a highly specialized area of the retina, the macula, which contains the fovea.
This is found in humans, primates, birds, and some fish and reptiles. In addition, an area centralis is
described in several other laboratory animals such as the cat, but these animals do not possess a true
fovea. In the center of the macula is an area, the fovea, which is the area of highest visual acuity. It is
completely rod free, containing only cone photoreceptors. The fovea is an avascular area and lacks all
retinal layers except the photoreceptors and their nuclei.

THE LENS

The lens is a biconvex transparent structure and is the second refracting unit of the eye. It lies
posterior to the iris and is suspended from the ciliary body by the zonular fibers. It also has a posterior
attachment to the anterior vitreous face where it lies in a depression of the vitreous, the patellar
fossa. It is a unique tissue in that it is avascular, transparent, lacks nerve supply, and has the highest
concentration of protein in the body. Embryologically, the lens originates from the surface ectoderm
that is induced to form the lens placode and invaginate by the advancing optic vesicle and cup.
The lens is surrounded by a basement membrane, the lens capsule, which is secreted by the lens
epithelial cells anteriorly and the cortical fibers posteriorly. The capsule is thickest anteriorly and
thinnest at the posterior pole and continues to grow throughout life.
Beneath the lens capsule, anteriorly, is the lens epithelium. These form a monolayer of cuboidal
cells whose apices face the cortical fibers with the basal portion of the cell adjacent to the lens
capsule. The apical portion of the epithelial cells has terminal bars. Adjacent to the lens equator
is the pre-equatorial or germinative zone where the lens epithelial cells replicate. It is these cells
that are susceptible to radiation and toxic insult, resulting in cataract formation. The newly formed
cells migrate equatorially where they elongate, differentiate into cortical fibers, are displaced inward,
compressed, and loose their nuclei. This replicative process occurs throughout life. As these cortical
fibers elongate anteriorly and posteriorly they attach at a line, the lens suture. In human, dogs, and
cats these suture lines are in a Y-shape, upright anteriorly and inverted posteriorly, but this varies
with other species. This results in a layered arrangement of the lens fibers with the oldest fibers in
the center and the newest fibers surrounding them. On cross-section, the lens fibers are hexagonal
and adjacent cells interdigitate with each other in the form of microplicae and by a ball-and-socket
arrangement

THE VITREOUS

The vitreous is a semifluid and transparent structure composed of 99% water with the remnants
composed of collagen fiber matrix and mucopolysaccharide (hyaluronic acid). It is normally avascular
and does not contain nerves or lymphatics. The vitreous is attached anteriorly to the zonules and to
the posterior lens and peripherally at the pars plana and around the optic nerve.
Primary vitreous (the hyaloid vessel system) forms as the lens vesicle and optic cup ar forming. The
hyaloid artery originates from the site of the future optic nerve and extends to the posterior aspect
of the developing lens. This system is compressed centrally and gradually atrophies as the secondary
vitreous forms. It has usually disappeared completely by 2-3 weeks of age in the dog but portions may
persist for a few months in ruminants.
Secondary vitreous is produced by the Muller cells of the retina. As it forms, and the eye enlarges,
the primary vitreous becomes proportionally smaller and axially located. The secondary vitreous
becomes the adult vitreous.
Tertiary vitreous consists of the ciliary zonules (lenticular zonules) suspending the lens. It forms
from the neural ectoderm (surface epithelium) of the ciliary body and condenses into the individual
zonules.

OPTIC NERVE

The optic nerve is formed by axons of the nerve fiber layer. These nerve fibers develop from the
ganglion cells to form the nerve fiber layer of the retina, extend posteriorly to form the optic nerve and
extent toward the brain. Myelin develops from the brain outward to reach the eye a few weeks after
birth. In the dog, myelin usually extends into the eye and a short distance along the nerve fiber layer.
In the cat, myelin usually does not enter the eye. Dura mater and arachnoid of the brain extend along
the optic nerve to blend into the posterior sclera.

EPILOGUE AND
ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS
This textbook is an amalgamation of three important conversations concerning 1) veterinary student
debt, 2) accessible learning materials, and 3) course design of the Comparative Structure and Function
of Tissues course (VM6530). Our veterinary students incur a substantial amount of debt in the pursuit
of their veterinary medical education. As such, any means by which we can reduce this debt load should
be a priority. Further, it was our opinion that available histology textbooks suffered from being either
non-veterinary focused, poorly interactive, or poorly adapted to an introductory level histology course.
In considering these issues and approaches, it became clear to us that we needed to start from scratch
and author a new, interactive and accessible, no-cost textbook.
Veterinary medical education is in a crisis of sorts regarding the student debt of graduates. The Ohio
State University’s Office of Distance Education and E-Learning and the Affordable Learning Exchange
(ALX) program, which “pairs excellence with affordability at Ohio State through grants, research, and
faculty outreach”, provided the foundational support for this project. ALX estimates that projects
funded by their program will save OSU students approximately $1 million by the end of 2017. Our
project proposal was funded by the ALX in Fall 2016. The ALX provided us not only with the funds
necessary to produce such an ambitious project, but expertise, experience, organization, creativity and
technical support. We would especially like to thank Alexis Duffy (ODEE Educational Technologist),
Ashley Miller (ODEE Program Manager, Affordability and Access), and Mike Shiflet (ODEE Educational
Technologist) who have given us endless support.
Additionally, we could not have created this book without the support of members of the College
of Veterinary Medicine’s Office of Teaching and Learning. Dr. Melinda Rhodes-DiSalvo was critical to
the development of our project proposal and in generating project goals, encouraging us to aim high!
Similarly, we are incredibly grateful to Jay Hsiao, Instructional Designer for the OSU CVM Office of
Teaching and Learning. Jay was a major driver in the production of this book, and Jay’s technical savvy,
enthusiasm, creativity and commitment to creating innovative and valuable learning resources made
this possible.
Finally, we would like to thank Dr. Jessica Kendziorski, who not only contributed to the text of
this book (The Cell chapter), but took on the time-consuming task of finding representative normal
tissues from our extensive archives, photographing representative cells, structures and tissues, and
annotating. Her diligence and meticulousness has resulted in many of the beautiful histologic images
that adorn this book.

APPENDIX 1: GENERAL PRINCIPLES OF
HISTOTECHNOLOGY

The simplest method for the direct observation of living cells is to remove them from the organism,
place them on a slide and examine them by dark-field or phase-contrast microscopy or light microscopy
after staining.
However, living tissues and cells are difficult to examine microscopically; instead, they are usually
killed by careful fixation to minimize alterations of in vivo morphology. Subsequent processing ends
with tissues embedded in a material which facilitates thin sectioning; for light microscopy this is
usually paraffin. The steps for processing tissue for histology are as follows.
• Removal of the tissue.
• Fixation. The sample, preferably small, is placed in a reagent (e.g. formalin which is 10%
aqueous solution of 40% formaldehyde) which preserves substances and structures in the
cells and tissues and prevents autolytic changes. Depending on the size of the piece, it
should be fixed from 4-24 hours.
• Washing and Dehydration. After fixation the specimen is washed in water to remove the
excess fixative then placed in increasing strengths of alcohol or other dehydrating agents.
(So the original water in the tissue and what was in the water and not precipitated by the
formalin can be removed by the dehydrating agent – eg. edema fluid with low level albumin/
protein).
• Clearing. This is the process of removing the dehydrating agent with some fluid which is
miscible both with the dehydrating agents and with the embedding medium. (Since a
common embedding agent is paraffin which is an oil, clearing agents often replace oils that
are not precipitated by formalin – eg. triglycerides in fat cells).
• Infiltration and Embedding. In this process the clearing agent is replaced with the
embedding medium, usually paraffin.
• Cutting. Slicing and removing of 3 and 10 micrometers (microns) – thick sections of the
tissues with a microtome.
• Section Mounting. It is accomplished by transferring the sections to a clean glass
microscope slide.
• Deceration. This is the removal of the embedding agent.

Veterinary Histology

222

• Staining. This is a process of increasing the visibility of cells by the application of dyes or by
their reaction with chemical agents to form visible substances.
• Mounting. This is the act of covering the cleared section with a drop of mounting medium
and a thin glass cover-slip. Mounting media have the same indices of refraction as glass and
harden as the solvent evaporates, thus making the preparation permanent.

APPENDIX 2: HISTOLOGICAL STAINING
METHODS

Staining brings out in contrasting colors otherwise colorless structural details of tissue sections. The
coloring ability of many dyes resides in either their acid or basic radical. If in the anion, the dye is
called acid, if in the cation, it is called basic.
Acid components of a cell (like nuclear chromatin or chromosomes) stain with basic dyes (e.g.,
hematoxylin) and these components are referred to as basophilic or hematoxylinophilic (blue).
Basic components (various kinds of cytoplasm and intercellular substance) take acid dyes (e.g.,
eosin), and are called acidophilic or eosinophilic (pink). Please note that there are numerous stains
used to evaluate tissue for different purposes. Hematoxylin and eosin (or H&E) staining is the most
common method of staining used for histologic sections.

APPENDIX 3: MEASUREMENT FOR MICROSCOPY

Though the millimeter is a convenient unit for measurement with magnification, it is too large
for measuring microscopic objects conveniently. For microscopic measurement the millimeter is
divided into 1000 equal parts, each part being called a micrometer or a micron. The symbol is um.
A micrometer, then, is one millionth part of a meter. The smallest object under the most favorable
background conditions that can be observed with the unaided eye is of the dimensions of 0.1 millimeter
or 100 um.
Under the ideal background conditions the human ovum and the largest of nerve cells are barely
visible. Objects which are below the size for visual examination with the unaided eye and are yet large
enough to be seen with a bright field microscope are said to be microscopic. The range is from 0.1
millimeter to 0.0001 mm or from 100 um and 0.1 um. Particles from 0.1 um to 0.004 um in size are
called submicroscopic (or ultrastructural) particles.
A still finer unit of measurement is the angstrom unit (A). Its value is 0.000,000,1 of a mm. The
angstrom unit has recently been abandoned in favor of the nanometer, but many references to it
remain.
