Preface

Biological research is in the midst of a revolutionary change due to the integration of powerful technologies along with new concepts and methods derived
from inclusion of physical sciences, mathematics, computational sciences, and
engineering. As never before, advances in biological sciences hold tremendous
promise for surmounting many of the major challenges confronting the United
States and the world. Historically, major advances in science have provided
solutions to economic and social challenges. At the same time, those challenges
have inspired science to focus its attention on critical needs. Scientific efforts
based on meeting societal needs have laid the foundation for countless new
products, industries, even entire economic sectors that were unimagined when
the work began.
The lessons of history led the Committee on a New Biology for the 21st
Century to recommend that a New Biology Initiative be put in place and
charged with finding solutions to major societal needs: sustainable food production, protection of the environment, renewable energy, and improvement in
human health. These challenges represent both the mechanism for accelerating
the emergence of a New Biology and its first fruits. Responding to its Statement
of Task, the committee found the answer to the question “How can a fundamental understanding of living systems reduce uncertainty about the future of
life on earth, improve human health and welfare, and lead to the wise stewardship of our planet?” in calling for a national initiative to apply the potential of
the New Biology to addressing these societal challenges.
As the report explains, the essence of the New Biology is integration––
re-integration of the many subdisciplines of biology, and the integration into
biology of physicists, chemists, computer scientists, engineers, and mathematicians to create a research community with the capacity to tackle a broad range
of scientific and societal problems. The committee chose biological approaches
ii

PREFACE

to solving problems in the areas of food, environment, energy and health as the
most inspiring goals to drive the development of the New Biology. But these are
not the only problems that we both hope and expect a thriving New Biology to
be able to address; fundamental questions in all areas of biology, from understanding the brain to carbon cycling in the ocean, will all be more tractable
as the New Biology grows into a flourishing reality. Given the fundamental
unity of biology, it is our hope and our expectation that the New Biology will
contribute to advances across the life sciences. Throughout the report, “New
Biology” is capitalized to emphasize that it is intended to be an additional and
complementary effort to traditional life sciences research, not a replacement.
Peer-reviewed, independent investigator-initiated research is the foundation on
which the New Biology rests and on which it will continue to rely.
Many exciting and important areas of biological research are not considered in this report. America’s research capability in life sciences leads the world.
This committee strongly endorses current research endeavors, both in the
public and private sector. Within biology, the excellent work underway must
be continued. But for this study, the intent was not to comprehensively review
all life sciences research. Instead the committee focused on those opportunities
that cannot be addressed by any one subdiscipline or agency––opportunities
that require integration across biology and with other sciences and engineering, and that are difficult to capitalize on within traditional institutional and
funding structures.
It is not merely the sciences that need to be integrated. The New Biology
will draw on the research and development capabilities of universities, government, and industry. Individual federal agencies will continue to lead important,
independent efforts. For the New Biology to flourish, however, interagency
co-leadership of projects will be needed to a far greater extent than is the case
today. This approach is not simply a matter of funding. The combined capabilities and expertise of numerous organizations are required to address society’s
greatest challenges.
This study represents the collective efforts of the committee during meetings, workshops, a December 2008 Biology Summit, and many teleconferences.
We would like to thank the Summit and workshop participants for their valuable input. We also thank the committee members who volunteered countless
hours and the Board of Life Sciences staff for their efforts and dedication to
the study.
America’s investment in basic research in the life sciences has paid rich
dividends. A commitment to the New Biology will extend this proud record.
In the words of President Obama when he addressed the 2009 annual
meeting of the National Academy of Sciences:

ix
As you know, scientific discovery takes far more that the occasional flash of brilliance—
as important as that can be. Usually, it takes time and hard work and patience; it takes
training; it requires the support of a nation. But it holds promise like no other area of
human endeavor.

The well-being, security, and prosperity of our nation are the prize. We
fully endorse the recommendations here presented.

Summary

In July, 2008, the National Institutes of Health (NIH), National Science
Foundation (NSF), and Department of Energy (DOE) asked the National
Research Council’s Board on Life Sciences to convene a committee to examine the current state of biological research in the United States and recommend
how best to capitalize on recent technological and scientific adances that hae
allowed biologists to integrate biological research findings, collect and interpret
astly increased amounts of data, and predict the behaior of complex biological
systems. From September 2008 through July of 2009, a committee of 16 experts
from the fields of biology, engineering and computational science undertook to
delineate those scientific and technological advances and come to a consensus
on how the U.S. might best capitalize on them. This report, authored by the
Committee on a New Biology for the 21st Century, describes the committee’s
work and conclusions.
The committee concluded that biological research has indeed experienced
extraordinary scientific and technological advances in recent years. In the chapter entitled “Why Now?” the committee describes the integration taking place
within the field of biology, the increasingly fruitful collaboration of biologists with
scientists and engineers from other disciplines, the technological advances that
have allowed biologists to collect and make sense of ever more detailed observations at ever smaller time intervals, and the enormous and largely unanticipated
payoffs of the Human Genome Project. Despite this potential, the challenge of
advancing from identifying parts, to defining complex systems, to systems design,
manipulation, and prediction is still well beyond current capabilities, and the
barriers to advancement are similar at all levels from cells to ecosystems.
Having delineated the advances, the committee set about reaching an
agreement as to how the U.S. could best capitalize on them. The committee was
invited to use the following series of questions to guide its discussions:


A NEW BIOLOGY FOR THE ST CENTURY

• What fundamental biological questions are ready for major adances in
understanding? What would be the practical result of answering those questions?
How could answers to those questions lead to high impact applications in the near
future?
• How can a fundamental understanding of liing systems reduce uncertainty about the future of life on earth, improe human health and welfare, and
lead to the wise stewardship of our planet? Can the consequences of enironmental, stochastic or genetic changes be understood in terms of the related properties of robustness and fragility inherent in all biological systems?
• How can federal agencies more effectiely leerage their inestments in
biological research and education to address complex problems across scales of
analysis from basic to applied? In what areas would near term inestment be most
likely to lead to substantial long-term benefit and a strong, competitie adantage
for the United States? Are there high-risk, high pay-off areas that desere serious
consideration for seed funding?
• Are new funding mechanisms needed to encourage and support crosscutting, interdisciplinary or applied biology research?
• What are the major impediments to achieing a newly integrated biology?
• What are the implications of a newly integrated biology for infrastructural
needs?
• How should infrastructural priorities be identified and planned for?
• What are the implications for the life sciences research culture of a newly
integrated approach to biology? How can physicists, chemists, mathematicians and
engineers be encouraged to help build a wider biological enterprise with the scope
and expertise to address a broad range of scientific and societal problems?
• Are changes needed in biology education—to ensure that biology majors
are equipped to work across traditional subdisciplinary boundaries, to proide
biology curricula that equip physical scientists and engineers to take adantage
of adances in biological science, and to proide nonscientists with a leel of biological understanding that gies them an informed oice regarding releant policy
proposals? Are alternatie degree programs needed or can biology departments be
organized to attract and train students able to work comfortably across disciplinary boundaries?
The committee found that the third bullet, “How can federal agencies
more effectiely leerage their inestments in biological research and education
to address complex problems across scales of analysis from basic to applied? In
what areas would near term inestment be most likely to lead to substantial
long-term benefit and a strong, competitie adantage for the United States?”
provided a compelling platform from which to consider each of the questions,
and a robust framework upon which to organize its conclusions. Thus, the
committee’s overarching recommendation is that the most effective leveraging
of investments would come from a coordinated, interagency effort to encourage

A New Biology for the 21st Century


the emergence of a New Biology approach that would enunciate and address
broad and challenging societal problems. The committee focused on examples
of opportunities that cannot be addressed by any one subdiscipline or agency—
opportunities that require integration across biology and with other sciences
and engineering, and that are difficult to capitalize on within traditional institutional and funding structures. Fully realizing these opportunities will require
the enabling of an integrated approach to biological research, an approach the
committee calls the New Biology.
The essence of the New Biology, as defined by the committee, is integration—
re-integration of the many sub-disciplines of biology, and the integration into
biology of physicists, chemists, computer scientists, engineers, and mathematicians to create a research community with the capacity to tackle a broad range
of scientific and societal problems. Integrating knowledge from many disciplines
will permit deeper understanding of biological systems, which will both lead to
biology-based solutions to societal problems and also feed back to enrich the
individual scientific disciplines that contribute new insights. The New Biology is
not intended to replace the research that is going on now; that research, much of
it fundamental and curiosity-driven by individual scientists, is the foundation on
which the New Biology rests and on which it will continue to rely.
Instead, the New Biology represents an additional, complementary approach
to biological research. Purposefully organized around problem-solving, this
approach marshals the basic research to advance fundamental understanding,
brings together researchers with different expertise, develops the technologies
required for the task and coordinates efforts to ensure that gaps are filled,
problems solved, and resources brought to bear at the right time. Combining
the strengths of different communities does not necessarily mean bringing these
experts into the same facility to work on one large project––indeed, advanced
communication and informatics infrastructures make it easier than ever to
assemble virtual collaborations at different scales. The New Biology approach
would aim to attract the best minds from across the scientific landscape to
particular problems, ensure that innovations and advances are swiftly communicated, and provide the tools and technologies needed to succeed. The
committee expects that such efforts would include projects at different scales,
from individual laboratories, to collaborations involving many participants, to
consortia involving multiple institutions and types of research.
Many scientists in the United States are already practicing the integrated
and interdisciplinary approach to biology that the committee has called the New
Biology. The New Biology is indeed already emerging, but it is as yet poorly recognized, inadequately supported, and delivering only a fraction of its potential.
The committee concludes that the most effective way to speed the emergence of
the New Biology is to challenge the scientific community to discover solutions
to major societal problems. In the chapter entitled “How the New Biology Can
Address Societal Challenges” the committee describes four broad challenges, in

A New Biology for the 21st Century
http://www.nap.edu/catalog/12764.html
A NEW BIOLOGY FOR THE ST CENTURY

food, environment, energy and health that could be tackled by the New Biology.
These challenges represent both the mechanism for accelerating the emergence
of a New Biology and its first fruits. The committee chose to focus on these four
areas of societal need because the benefits of achieving these goals would be
large, progress would be assessable, and both the scientific community and the
public would find such goals inspirational. Each challenge will require technological and conceptual advances that are not now at hand, across a disciplinary
spectrum that is not now encompassed by the field. Achieving these goals will
demand, in each case, transformative advances. It can be argued, however, that
other challenges could serve the same purpose. Large-scale efforts to understand
how the first cell came to be, how the human brain works, or how living organisms affect the cycling of carbon in the ocean could also drive the development
of the New Biology and of the technologies and sciences necessary to advance
the entire field. In the committee’s view, one of the most exciting aspects of the
New Biology Initiative is that success in achieving the four goals chosen here as
examples will propel advances in fundamental understanding throughout the life
sciences. Because biological systems have so many fundamental similarities, the
same technologies and sciences developed to address these four challenges will
expand the capabilities of all biologists.
. Generate food plants to adapt and grow sustainably in changing enironments
The New Biology could deliver a dramatically more efficient approach to
developing plant varieties that can be grown sustainably under local conditions.
The result of this focused and integrated effort will be a body of knowledge,
new tools, technologies, and approaches that will make it possible to adapt all
sorts of crop plants for efficient production under different conditions, a critical
contribution toward making it possible to feed people around the world with
abundant, healthful food, adapted to grow efficiently in many different and
ever-changing local environments.
. Understand and sustain ecosystem function and biodiersity in the face of rapid
change
Fundamental advances in knowledge and a new generation of tools and
technologies are needed to understand how ecosystems function, measure
ecosystem services, allow restoration of damaged ecosystems, and minimize
harmful impacts of human activities and climate change. What is needed is the
New Biology, combining the knowledge base of ecology with those of organismal biology, evolutionary and comparative biology, climatology, hydrology,
soil science, and environmental, civil, and systems engineering, through the
unifying languages of mathematics, modeling, and computational science. This
integration has the potential to generate breakthroughs in our ability to monitor
ecosystem function, identify ecosystems at risk, and develop effective interventions to protect and restore ecosystem function.


. Expand sustainable alternaties to fossil fuels
Making efficient use of plant materials––biomass––to make biofuels is
a systems challenge, and this is another example of an area where the New
Biology can make a critical contribution. At its simplest, the system consists
of a plant that serves as the source of cellulose and an industrial process that
turns the cellulose into a useful product. There are many points in the system
that can be optimized. The New Biology offers the possibility of advancing the
fundamental knowledge, tools, and technology needed to optimize the system
by tackling the challenge in a comprehensive way.
. Understand indiidual health
The goal of a New Biology approach to health is to make it possible to
monitor each individual’s health and treat any malfunction in a manner that is
tailored to that individual. In other words, the goal is to provide individually
predictive surveillance and care. Between the starting point of an individual’s
genome sequence and the endpoint of that individual’s health is a web of
interacting networks of staggering complexity. The New Biology can accelerate
fundamental understanding of the systems that underlie health and the development of the tools and technologies that will in turn lead to more efficient
approaches to developing therapeutics and enabling individualized, predictive
medicine.
Finally, in the chapter entitled “Putting the New Biology to Work,” the
committee proposes that a national initiative dedicated to addressing challenges
like those described for the areas of food, the environment, energy, and health
would provide a framework whereby the U.S. could best capitalize on recent
scientific and technological advances. The committee recommends setting big
goals and then letting the problems drive the science. It contends that interagency collaboration will be essential and that information technologies will
be of central importance. Finally, the committee discusses new approaches to
education that could speed the emergence of the New Biology, and provides
examples of how a national initiative could spur the implementation of those
new approaches.
The committee does not provide a detailed plan for implementation of
such a national initiative, which would depend strongly on where administrative
responsibility for the initiative is placed. Should the concept of an initiative be
adopted, the next step would be careful development of strategic visions for
the programs and a tactical plan with goals. It would be necessary to identify
imaginative leaders, carefully map the route from ‘grand visions’ to specific
programs, and develop ambitious, but measurable milestones, ensuring that
each step involves activities that result in new knowledge and facilitates the
smooth integration of cooperative interdisciplinary research into the traditional
research culture.

A NEW BIOLOGY FOR THE 21ST CENTURY

A New Biology Initiative would represent a daring addition to the nation’s
research portfolio, but the potential benefits are remarkable and far-reaching:
a life sciences research community engaged in the full spectrum of knowledge
discovery and its application; new bio-based industries; and most importantly,
innovative means to produce food and biofuels sustainably, monitor and restore
ecosystems and improve human health. To that end, the committee provides
the following findings and recommendations:
Finding 1
• The United States and the world face serious societal challenges in the
areas of food, environment, energy, and health.
• Innovations in biology can lead to sustainable solutions for all of these
challenges. Solutions in all four areas will be driven by advances in fundamental
understanding of basic biological processes.
• For each of these challenges, solutions are within reach, based on building the capacity to understand, predict, and influence the responses and capabilities of complex biological systems.
• There is broad support across the scientific community for pursuing
interdisciplinary research, but opportunities to do so are constrained by institutional barriers and available resources.
• Approaches that integrate a wide range of scientific disciplines, and
draw on the strengths and resources of universities, federal agencies, and the
private sector will accelerate progress toward making this potential a reality.
• The best way for the United States to capitalize on this scientific and
technological opportunity is to add to its current research portfolio a New
Biology effort that will accelerate understanding of complex biological systems,
driving rapid progress in meeting societal challenges and advancing fundamental knowledge.
Recommendation 1
The committee recommends a national initiative to accelerate the emergence
and growth of the New Biology to achieve solutions to societal challenges in
food, energy, environment, and health.
Finding 2
• For its success, the New Biology will require the creative drive and deep
knowledge base of individual scientists from across biology and many other
disciplines including physical, computational and geosciences, mathematics,
and engineering.
• The New Biology offers the potential to address questions at a scale
and with a focus that cannot be undertaken by any single scientific community,
agency or sector.
• Providing a framework for different communities to work together will

SUMMARY

lead to synergies and new approaches that no single community could have
achieved alone.
• A broad array of programs to identify, support, and facilitate biology
research exists in the federal government but value is being lost by not integrating these efforts.
• Interagency insight and oversight is critical to support the emergence
and growth of the New Biology Initiative. Interagency leadership will be needed
to oversee and coordinate the implementation of the initiative, evaluate its progress, establish necessary working subgroups, maintain communication, guard
against redundancy, and identify gaps and opportunities for leveraging results
across projects.
Recommendation 2:
The committee recommends that the national New Biology Initiative be an
interagency effort, that it have a timeline of at least 10 years, and that its funding be in addition to current research budgets.
Finding 3
• Information is the fundamental currency of the New Biology.
• Solutions to the challenges of standardization, exchange, storage, security, analysis, and visualization of biological information will multiply the value
of the research currently being supported across the federal government.
• Biological data are extraordinarily heterogeneous and interrelating various bodies of data is currently precluded by the lack of the necessary information infrastructure.
• It is critical that all researchers be able to share and access each others’
information in a common or fully interactive format.
• The productivity of biological research will increasingly depend on longterm, predictable support for a high-performance information infrastructure.
Recommendation 3
The committee recommends that, within the national New Biology Initiative,
priority be given to the development of the information technologies and sciences that will be critical to the success of the New Biology.
Finding 4
• Investment in education is essential if the new biology is to reach its full
potential in meeting the core challenges of the 21st century.
• The New Biology Initiative provides an opportunity to attract students
to science who want to solve real-world problems.
• The New Biologist is not a scientist who knows a little bit about all disciplines, but a scientist with deep knowledge in one discipline and a “working
fluency” in several.



A NEW BIOLOGY FOR THE 21ST CENTURY

• Highly developed quantitative skills will be increasingly important.
• Development and implementation of genuinely interdisciplinary undergraduate courses and curricula will both prepare students for careers as New
Biology researchers and educate a new generation of science teachers well
versed in New Biology approaches.
• Graduate training programs that include opportunities for interdisciplinary work are essential.
• Programs to support faculty in developing new curricula will have a
multiplying effect.
Recommendation 4
The committee recommends that the New Biology Initiative devote resources
to programs that support the creation and implementation of interdisciplinary
curricula, graduate training programs, and educator training needed to create
and support New Biologists.

Introduction
A Vision of the Future

Imagine a world:
•
•
•
•

where there is abundant, healthful food for everyone
where the environment is resilient and flourishing
where there is sustainable, clean energy
where good health is the norm

Each of these goals is a daunting challenge. Furthermore, none can be
attained independently of the others––we want to grow more food without
using more energy or harming natural environments, and we want new sources
of energy that do not contribute to global warming or have adverse health
effects. The problems raised by these fundamental biological and environmental questions are interdependent and “solutions” that work at cross purposes
will not in fact be solutions.
Fortunately, advances in the life sciences have the potential to contribute
innovative and mutually reinforcing solutions to reach all of these goals and, at
the same time, serve as the basis for new industries that will anchor the economies of the future. Here are some of the many different ways in which the life
sciences could contribute to meeting these challenges:
• A wide variety of plants with faster maturation, drought tolerance,
and disease resistance could contribute to a sustainable increase in local food
production.
• Food crops could be engineered for higher nutritional value, including
higher concentrations of vitamins and healthier oils.
• Critical habitats could be monitored by arrays of remote sensors,

enabling early detection of habitat damage and providing feedback on the
progress of restoration efforts.
• Water supplies and other natural resources could be monitored and
managed using biosensors and other biologically based processes.
• Biological systems could remove more carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, thus helping to maintain a stable climate; the carbon they capture
could be used to create biologically based materials for construction and
manufacturing.
• Biological sources could contribute at least 20 percent of the fuel for
transportation through a 10-fold increase in biofuel production.
• Bio-inspired approaches to producing hydrogen could provide another
affordable and sustainable source of fuel.
• Biologically inspired approaches to capturing solar energy could increase
the efficiency and lower the cost of photovoltaic technology.
• Manufactured products could increasingly be made from renewable
resources and be either recyclable or biodegradable.
• Industrial manufacturing processes could be designed to produce zero
waste through a combination of biological treatment of byproducts and efficient recycling of water and other manufacturing inputs.
• Greater understanding of what it means to be healthy could lead to
health care focused on maintaining health rather than reacting to illness.
• Individualized risk profiles and early detection could make it possible
to provide each person with the right care at the right time.
Science and technology alone, of course, cannot solve all of our food,
energy, environmental, and health problems. Political, social, economic, and
many other factors have major roles to play in both setting and meeting goals
in these areas. Indeed, increased collaboration between life scientists and social
scientists is another exciting interface that has much to contribute to developing
and implementing practical solutions. But the life sciences have the potential to
provide a set of tools and solutions that can significantly increase the options
available to society for dealing with problems. Integration of the biological sciences with physical and computational sciences, mathematics, and engineering
promises to build a wider biological enterprise with the scope and expertise
to address a broad range of scientific and societal problems. The following
chapters will discuss why the life sciences are poised to tackle major challenges
of the 21st century, describe why we reside at such an exceptional moment for
the life sciences, and finally, provide recommendations for shaping investment
in life science research.

The New Biology’s Great Potential

In July, 2008, the National Institutes of Health (NIH), National Science
Foundation (NSF), and Department of Energy (DOE) asked the National
Research Council’s Board on Life Sciences to examine the current state of
biological research in the United States and recommend how best to capitalize
on recent technological and scientific advances that have allowed biologists
to integrate biological research findings, collect and interpret vastly increased
amounts of data, and predict the behavior of complex biological systems. The
board convened a committee entitled the Committee on a New Biology for the
21st Century to take on this assignment. The committee’s statement of task was
broad, calling for an appraisal of areas in which the life sciences are poised to
make major advances and how these advances could contribute to practical
applications and improved environmental stewardship, human health, and
quality of life. The committee was asked to examine current trends toward integration and synthesis within the life sciences and the increasingly important role
of interdisciplinary teams and the resultant implications for funding strategies,
decision-making, infrastructure, and education in the life sciences.
Ultimately, the committee was asked to make recommendations aimed at
ensuring that the United States takes the lead in the emergence of a biological science that will support a higher level of confidence in our understanding
of living systems, thus reducing uncertainty about the future, contributing to
innovative solutions for practical problems, and allowing the development of
robust and sustainable new technologies.
The study included a “Biology Summit” on December 3, 2008, at which
leaders of major biology research funding agencies and private research foundations outlined the great potential of biology research and the challenges in
reaching that potential. Other speakers included private sector “consumers”
of life sciences research results, a university president, and several biology

A NEW BIOLOGY FOR THE 21ST CENTURY

researchers who illustrated the interdisciplinary, high-impact biology research
that is already taking place. The Summit proceedings were published as a workshop report in January 2009 (National Research Council, 2009).
Given the statement of task’s imperative that the committee provide recommendations to federal agencies on how best to support emerging capabilities
in the life sciences, the committee invited several speakers to its first meeting
in November 2008 for advice on how to develop effective and implementable
recommendations. Both Ralph Cicerone, president of the National Academy
of Sciences, and Charles Vest, president of the National Academy of Engineering, spoke with the committee, as did several speakers knowledgeable about
the impact of past National Academies reports. The committee also heard talks
on how basic life sciences research contributes to diverse economic sectors and
international science policy efforts. After the Biology Summit in December
2008, the committee met three times, in February, April, and July 2009, to
develop the report and its recommendations.
Because the statement of task was broad, the committee wrestled with how
best to address it. Some of the questions the committee was invited to consider
focused on scientific priorities––for example, what fundamental biological questions are ready for major advances in understanding? Other questions were more
practical––are new funding mechanisms needed to support cross-­cutting, interdisciplinary, or applied biology research? The committee explored several different approaches to addressing so wide a range of questions. One approach would
have been to examine the current life sciences landscape and highlight specific
areas of biological research that are particularly exciting or promising. This was
the approach taken in a 1989 National Research Council (NRC) report called
­Opportunities in Biology (National Research Council, 1989). Over 400 pages
in length and with a chapter devoted to each of nine major subdisciplines of
­biology, the report identified questions each of those sub-disciplines was poised
to answer. Certainly there would be no shortage of material if this committee had
followed that model: Across biology from neuroscience to ­organismal biology
to ecology, genomics, and bioengineering, the pace of discovery is rapid, making ambitious goals ever more realistic (Institute of Medicine, 2008; Schwenk
et al., 2009; National Academy of Engineering, 2009). But such a list would, by
necessity, be incomplete and almost immediately outdated. Furthermore, the
committee felt that such an approach would miss a critical insight with tremendous implications.
Biology is at a point of inflection. Years of research have generated detailed
information about the components of the complex systems that characterize
life––genes, cells, organisms, ecosystems––and this knowledge has begun to
fuse into greater understanding of how all those components work together
as systems. Powerful tools are allowing biologists to probe complex systems
in ever-greater detail, from molecular events in individual cells to global biogeochemical cycles. Integration within biology and increasingly fruitful col-

laboration with physical, earth, and computational scientists, mathematicians,
and engineers are making it possible to predict and control the activities of
biological systems in ever greater detail.
These trends both reflect and depend on the fundamental nature of life.
Biology’s tremendous potential rests on two powerful facts, the first being that
all organisms are related by evolution. Therefore, work on one gene, one cell,
one species is directly relevant to understanding all others because processes
may be identical or highly similar between different organisms due to their
shared descent. Second, the process of evolution has generated countless variations on these common themes––a vast array of organisms with myriad adaptations to diverse environments––and comparison is a powerful illuminator.
­Biology is now at a point of being able to capitalize on these essential characteristics of the living world, and that ability has implications across many sectors. Just
as the Internet, combined with powerful search engines, makes vast amounts of
information accessible, the core commonalities of biology, combined with increasingly sophisticated ways to compare, predict, and manipulate their characteristics,
can make the resources of biology accessible for a wide range of applications. The
committee concluded that the life sciences have reached a point where a new
level of inquiry is possible, a level that builds on the strengths of the traditional
research establishment but provides a framework to draw on those strengths
and focus them on large questions whose answers would provide many practical benefits. We call this new level of inquiry the New Biology and believe that
it has the potential to take on more ambitious challenges than ever before. As
examples of the kinds of challenges this approach can address, the committee
has chosen aspects of critical economic sectors––food, the environment, energy,
and health––to which the New Biology could make important contributions.
Though the problems are indeed diverse, many of the solutions the life sciences
can offer will derive from greater understanding of core biological processes—
processes that are common to all living systems. Achieving understanding at
this systemic level is the promise of the New Biology.
Biological research is supported by many federal agencies (Box 1.1). Each
nurtures a talented community of scientists and engineers, supports technology
and tool development, builds infrastructure, and funds training and education
programs. Because of biology’s increasing trend toward integration, the work
of these agencies is potentially more complementary than ever before. In fact,
the committee concludes that if a framework were in place for these agencies
and others to work together and solicit input from academia, the private sector,
and foundations, significant progress could be made on meeting major societal
challenges.
The committee concludes that a bold proposal to focus the newly emerging
capabilities of biological research on major societal challenges is timely and that
a relatively small investment could have large benefits by leveraging resources
and skills across the federal government, private, and academic sectors.

The committee discussed each of the points in its statement of task (Appendix A). Although each question may not be explicitly addressed in this report,
those discussions had a major impact on leading the committee to recommend
a problem-focused approach. For example, the committee argues that focusing attention on solving practical problems will require, and in turn lead to,
advances in fundamental understanding. Implications for infrastructure, education, and research culture are raised throughout the report, and suggestions
are offered for positive approaches to implement change. It is the committee’s
hope that the report presents a convincing vision of how federal agencies could
more effectively leverage their investments in biological research and education
to address complex problems and a compelling argument that this near-term
investment will lead to substantial long-term benefits and a strong, competitive
advantage for the United States.

How the New Biology
Can Address Societal Challenges

In the 1800s, those who studied the living world were called “naturalists”
and they were highly interdisciplinary, combining observations from biology,
geology, and physics to describe the natural world. In this 200th anniversary
year of Darwin’s birth, after decades of highly productive specialization, the
study of life is again becoming more interdisciplinary, by necessity combining
previously disparate fields to create a “New Biology.” The essence of the New
Biology is re-integration of the subdisciplines of biology, along with greater
integration with the physical and computational sciences, mathematics, and
engineering in order to devise new approaches that tackle traditional and systems level questions in new, interdisciplinary, and especially, quantitative ways
(Figure 2.1).
As illustrated in Figure 2.1, the New Biology relies on integrating knowledge from many disciplines to derive deeper understanding of biological systems. That deeper understanding both allows the development of biology-based
solutions for societal problems and also feeds back to enrich the individual scientific disciplines that contributed to the new insights. It is critically important
to recognize that the New Biology does not replace the research that is going
on now; that research is the foundation on which the New Biology rests and
on which it will continue to rely. If we compare our understanding of the living
world to the assembly of a massive jigsaw puzzle, each of the subdisciplines
of biology has been assembling sections of the puzzle. The individual sections
are far from complete and continued work to fill those gaps is critical. Indeed,
biological systems are so complex that it is likely that major new discoveries are
still to be expected, and new discoveries very frequently come from individual
scientists who make the intellectual leap from the particular system they study
to an insight that illuminates many biological processes. The additional contri17

Who Is the New Biologist?
The committee believes that virtually every biologist who reads this report’s
description of the New Biologist will recognize him or herself. All biologists
think across levels of biological complexity—molecular biologists consider the
impact of genetic regulatory pathways on the health of organisms, ecologists
consider the impact of environmental change on the gene pool of an ecosystem, and neuroscientists link cell-to-cell communication with behavior. Rare is
the biologist who does not use computational tools to analyze data, or rely on
large-scale shared facilities for some experiments. And an increasing fraction of
biologists collaborate closely with physical scientists, computational scientists
or engineers. The workshop held at the beginning of this committee’s work
highlighted a number of laboratories where the New Biology is already well
advanced (Box 2.1). The committee does not intend to suggest that there is
a stark division between ‘old’ biologists and ‘new’ biologists, but rather that
there is a continuum from more reductionist, focused research within particular

BOX 2.1
A Wiring Diagram for Cells
Cellular systems can be represented in “wiring diagrams” analogous to those
of electronic circuits. But the components in the diagram are proteins, nucleic acids,
and other biologically active molecules while the wires are interactions among those
components.
Lucy Shapiro’s laboratory at the Stanford University School of Medicine chose
a simple organism, a bacterium called Caulobacter crescentus, and set out to understand all the integrated processes that this organism needs to function as a living
cell. Among these processes are the biochemical circuits that control cell division
and ­ differentiation. Four proteins serve as master regulators of these processes,
Shapiro and her colleagues have found. Rising and falling quantities of these proteins
in particular parts of the cell produce “an exquisite coordination of events in a threedimensional grid.”
Building these circuit diagrams has allowed researchers to identify nodes that
control cellular functions and are attractive targets for drugs designed to alter the
functioning of cells. Research in Shapiro’s lab, for example, has led to drug development projects for two new antibiotics and an antifungal agent.
Shapiro’s lab members are about half biologists and half physicists and engineers. Each has had to learn the language of the others so that they can work together.
“You put all these people together and amazing things happen,” Shapiro says. “Now
we understand in a completely different way how this bacterial cell works.”

subdisciplines of biology to more problem-focused, collaborative and interdisciplinary research. Each is important, and many, if not most, biologists have
feet in both worlds.
So if many biologists already practice the New Biology at some level, what
is the role of this report? Its role is to bring attention to the remarkable depth
and scope of the emerging New Biology that is as yet poorly recognized, inade­
quately supported, and delivering only a fraction of its potential.
Consider the newly hired assistant professor in the immunology department of a medical school who wants to collaborate with an ecologist who
studies the impact of changing land use patterns on natural ecosystems and
an engineer who models complex networks. Together they hope to develop a
biosensor to detect emerging infectious diseases. Where will this group apply
for funding? How will that assistant professor’s tenure committee react to a
series of publications in engineering and ecology journals?
Or consider the physics professor who wants to develop an inter­disciplinary
course on the physics and chemistry of DNA replication with colleagues from
the chemistry and molecular biology departments. Will any of these professors
be given credit for contributing to the teaching needs of their own departments? Such a course would likely not count toward degree requirements in any
of the three departments. And yet the students who took such a course would
be well-prepared to work across disciplinary boundaries no matter which of the
three sciences they decided to pursue in depth.
Importantly, the New Biologist is not a scientist who knows a little bit
about all disciplines, but a scientist with deep knowledge in one discipline and
basic “fluency” in several. One implication of this is that not all “New Biologists” are now, or will in the future be, biologists! The physicists who study
how the laws of physics play out in the crowded and decidedly non-equilibrium
environment of the cell, or the mathematicians who derive new equations to
describe the complex network interactions that characterize living systems are
New Biologists as well as being physicists or mathematicians. In fact, the New
Biology includes any scientist, mathematician, or engineer striving to apply his
or her expertise to the understanding and application of living systems.
During its deliberations, the committee came to the conclusion that the
best way for the United States to capitalize on the new capabilities emerging
in the life sciences would be a multi-agency initiative to marshal the necessary
resources and provide the coordination to enable the academic, public, and
private sectors to address major societal challenges. The challenges laid out in
this chapter are analogous to that of placing a man on the moon––the technologies do not all yet exist, there are still fundamental gaps in understanding—but
the committee believes that a relatively small investment could reap enormous
returns in each of these major societal challenge areas.

HOW THE NEW BIOLOGY CAN ADDRESS SOCIETAL CHALLENGES

21

A New Biology Approach to the Food Challenge:
Generate food plants to adapt and grow sustainably
in changing environments
The United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization has estimated that
923 million people were undernourished in 2007, an increase of 75 million over
the 2003–2005 estimate of 848 million (FAO, 2008). Growing enough food
worldwide to address this shortfall, as well as providing the higher quality food
that will be expected by people living in countries where standards of living are
improving, is an enormous challenge. This challenge will be compounded by the
changing climatic conditions of the future, which will change the temperature
and rainfall patterns of the world’s farmlands, and may also lead to inundation
of low-lying fertile land. A better fundamental understanding of plant growth
and productivity, as well as of how plants can be conditioned or bred to tolerate extreme conditions and adapt to climate change, will be key components
in increasing food production and nutrition in all areas of agriculture to meet
the needs of 8.4 billion people by 2030 (Census Bureau, 2008), while allowing
adequate land for energy production and environmental services.
Understanding Plant Growth
The long-term future of agriculture depends on a deeper understanding of
plant growth. Growth—or development—is the path from the genetic instructions stored in the genome to a fully formed organism. Surprisingly little is now
known about this path in plants. A genome sequence provides both a list of
parts and a resource for plant breeding methods, but does not give the information needed to understand how each gene contributes to the formation and
behavior of individual plant cells, how the cells collaborate and communicate to
form tissues (such as the vascular system or the epidermis), and how the tissues
function together to form the entire plant. There is simply a lack of fundamental information—we have the parts list for some plants, but not the assembly
instructions, so we don’t yet have a useful assembly manual. Understanding
at a fundamental and detailed level of the assembly manual of even one plant
would be a powerful tool. A recent NRC report, Achievements of the National
Plant Genome Initiative and New Horizons in Plant Biology (National Research
Council, 2008), provides a series of recommendations that could serve as the
basis for planning a coordinated effort to understand plant growth, including
a call to develop “reference genomes.” The report details the benefits of such
genomes and outlines the characteristics of desirable reference sequences. The
NPGI report recognizes that sequencing is just a first step in understanding
plant growth. A fully characterized model plant would provide a scaffold upon
which the myriad variations found throughout the plant kingdom could be
interpreted and put to use. Here lies the connection between biodiversity and
meeting the challenge of revolutionizing our capacity to generate plant ­varieties

22

A NEW BIOLOGY FOR THE 21ST CENTURY

to meet local needs and conditions. Every plant species, even every local population of a species, contains unique genetic resources that could contribute to
improving the crops we depend on. Assessing and protecting biodiversity is
therefore a critical ingredient in meeting the challenge of achieving sustainable
food production.
Fundamental understanding will require predictive models that include all
of the factors that affect growth and development; several technologies that will
have to be developed to be applied in parallel to model and crop plants; new
methods for live visualization of growing plants and for computational modeling
of their growth and development at the molecular and cellular levels; cell-type
specific gene expression, proteomic, and metabolomic data; high-throughput
phenotyping, both visual and chemical; methods to characterize the dynamics
and functions of microbial communities; and ready access to next-generation
sequencing methods. The same technologies and measurement techniques will
find useful application in energy, environmental, and human health research.
The New Biology––integrating life science research with physical science,
engineering, computational science, and mathematics––will enable the development of models of plant growth in cellular and molecular detail. Such predictive
models, combined with a comprehensive approach to cataloguing and appreciating plant biodiversity and the evolutionary relationships among plants, will
allow scientific plant breeding of a new type, in which genetic changes can be
targeted in a way that will predictably result in novel crops and crops adapted
to their conditions of growth. The goal of predictability is a critical one; genuine understanding of plant growth will reduce uncertainty about any possible
health or environmental consequences of genetic changes, changes in growth
conditions, or in associated microbial or insect communities. The New Biology
promises to deliver a dramatically more efficient approach to developing plant
varieties that can be grown sustainably under local conditions. Advances in
plant breeding and engineering, combined with a more profound and comprehensive understanding of plant growth and development and more complete
knowledge of plant diversity, will make it faster and less expensive to develop
plant varieties with helpful characteristics.
Genetically Informed Breeding
As a result of plant genome sequencing, plant genome analysis, and advances
in bioinformatics, it is now possible to recast the principles of highly successful traditional plant breeding into a new and accelerated type of plant breeding termed “genetically informed breeding.” Previously, the offspring of plant
crosses had to be screened after their full life cycle to see which of them had
acquired the traits sought by the breeder or farmer. Growing thousands of plant
offspring required a lot of time and space, and therefore limited the numbers of
offspring that could be analyzed. New quantitative methods—the ­methods of the

HOW THE NEW BIOLOGY CAN ADDRESS SOCIETAL CHALLENGES

23

New Biology—are being developed that use next-­generation DNA ­sequencing
to identify the differences in the genomes of parental ­varieties, and to identify
which genes of the parents are associated with particular desired traits through
quantitative trait mapping. Once this is done, the genetic sequence, or genotype, of millions of offspring can be determined from seeds or seedlings, and
only those with the desired trait combinations retained. This will allow a much
deeper selection from larger numbers of offspring, hence enormously speeding
the overall rate and power of plant breeding.
Continued advances in genotyping (including the same next-generation
sequencing methods that are contributing to the revolution in medicine, and
the same bioinformatics of genetic association studies used in human ­genomics)
and application of novel engineering methods to automatically record the relevant traits of growing plants, will greatly accelerate the process of breeding
plants with desired characteristics.
Transgenics and Genetic Engineering of Crops
The advancement of plant genomics will also allow us to engineer crops
in another way. By adding genes to the crop DNA from species other than the
crop plant of interest, we may be able to capitalize on all of the many molecular
mechanisms that can contribute to high crop yields. For example, some plants
use an alternate photosynthetic pathway (called C4) that increases carbon
fixation in dry environments. If the higher C4 photosynthetic rates could be
transferred to crops that normally use conventional C3 photosynthesis, it could
increase photosynthetic rates in most of the world’s food crops. Or, manipulating the effects and concentration of hormones could optimize not just growth,
but also partitioning of the carbohydrates produced by photosynthesis into
grains and other edible parts of the plant. Additional advanced genetic and
molecular methods, including those in place and others now being explored,
are leading to improvement in the nutritional value of crops, for example by
changing the composition of soybean oil to reduce transfat concentrations
(Fehr, 2007).
Biodiversity, Systematics, and Evolutionary Genomics
Research in biodiversity, enhanced by rapid advances in comparative and
evolutionary biology, is a critical ingredient in expanding the range of options
available for developing new food crops and improving current ones. Information technology, imaging, and high-throughput sequencing are a few of the
technological advances that promise to drive rapid advances in understanding
and managing biological diversity. Developing a comprehensive knowledge
of plant diversity and greater understanding of evolutionary relationships is
the functional equivalent of building a fully stocked parts warehouse with an

A NEW BIOLOGY FOR THE 21ST CENTURY

inventory control system that quickly locates exactly the right part. Much of this
potential is as yet unrealized because most species on Earth are yet unnamed,
indeed undiscovered, and their precise evolutionary relationships are unknown.
The field of systematics––the study of the diversity of life and the relationships
among organisms––is undergoing a renaissance as a result of adding genomic
and computational analysis to the many other ways organisms can be compared.
The practical benefits of expanding knowledge in this area are enormous; tapping into the vast resources represented by biological diversity will contribute
to adapting and improving crops for food and bioenergy, understanding ecosystem function, and finding new biologically active chemicals for medical and
industrial applications (Chivian & Bernstein, 2008).
Crops as Ecosystems
All crops grow in a complex environment, characterized by physical
­ arameters like temperature, moisture, and light, and biological parameters
p
including the viruses, bacteria, fungi, insects, birds, and others that interact with
the crop plants. Therefore, greater understanding of insect-plant interactions,
both beneficial and harmful, offers another route toward increasing crop productivity. Furthermore, complex microbial communities in the soil, previously
difficult to study, play critical roles in providing nutrients and protecting plants
from pests and diseases. Understanding these microbial communities in predictive detail will also point to new ways to increase plant productivity. Genetic
engineering (as well as plant breeding) has been of great importance in improving crop resistance to plant diseases caused by viruses, bacteria, and fungi, and
in resistance to herbivores such as insects.
Detailed understanding of how plants grow, a comprehensive catalogue
of plant diversity and evolutionary relationships, and a systems approach
to understanding how plants interact with the microbes and insects in their
environments––each of these areas is ripe for major advances in fundamental
understanding and none of them can be addressed by any one community
of scientists. Molecular and cellular biologists, ecologists, evolutionary biologists, and computational and physical scientists will all be needed. Biomedical
­researchers with expertise in identifying and growing stem cells, neuroscientists
with expertise in how neural networks monitor internal processes and seek
out and respond to external signals, environmental engineers with expertise in
monitoring and remediating contaminated ecosystems, hydrologists, soil scientists and meteorologists who study the physical systems that affect plant growth,
private sector researchers with expertise in identifying promising research
results and translating them into products––all of these and many others could
make critical contributions, if their efforts can be coordinated.
The result of this focused and integrated effort will be a body of knowledge,
new tools, technologies, and approaches that will make it possible to adapt all

sorts of crop plants for efficient production under different conditions, a critical contribution toward making it possible to feed people around the world
with abundant, healthful food, adapted to grow efficiently in many different,
ever-changing local environments. At the same time, the tools and approaches
developed through this effort will enhance the productivity of individual scientists around the world, whatever plant or ecosystem they are studying.

Challenge: Understand and sustain ecosystem
function and biodiversity in the face of rapid change
Humans do not exist independently of the rest of the living world. From
the most basic requirements of oxygen, clean water, and food, to raw materials
like fuel, building material, fiber for clothing, and shelter that have allowed
human societies to flourish around the globe, to intangible benefits that enrich
the quality of life such as the shade of a tree on a hot day or the inspiration
of an eagle in flight, humans are dependent on other organisms. Together, the
resources and benefits that are provided by the living world are considered
“ecosystem services” (Millennium Ecosystem Assessment, 2005). The amount
of services that ecosystems can provide depends, at base, on their ­productivity:
that is, their ability to use energy from the sun to make complex carbon­containing molecules like sugars and starches. Sustaining ecosystems so that
their productivity remains high even in the face of rapid climate change is
essential to sustaining and enhancing the quality of life of a growing human
population.
Fundamental advances in knowledge and a new generation of tools and
technologies are needed to understand how ecosystems function, measure
ecosystem services, allow restoration of damaged ecosystems, and minimize
harmful impacts of human activities and climate change. What is needed is the
New Biology, combining the knowledge base of ecology with those of organismal biology, evolutionary and comparative biology, climatology, hydrology,
soil science, and environmental, civil, and systems engineering, through the
unifying languages of mathematics, modeling, and computational science. This
integration has the potential to generate breakthroughs in our ability to monitor
ecosystem function, identify ecosystems at risk, and develop effective interventions to protect and restore ecosystem function.
Monitor Ecosystem Services
Ecosystem services are varied and some of them are easier to measure than
others. The amount of wood in a forest, for example, is easier to measure than the
amount of protection a mangrove swamp will provide from coastal flooding. Measuring qualities like the impact of ecosystems on air and water quality, or placing

a value on the carbon that is stored in undisturbed ecosystems, is challenging.
Detecting changes in biodiversity and predicting the impact of extinctions on ecosystem services is even harder. But if the value of ecosystems is to be appreciated,
the impact of human activities understood, and management decisions made on a
scientific basis, it is important to develop a methodology and the necessary tools
to monitor the state of ecosystems.
The New Biology has a great deal to offer in bringing together the necessary
expertise and resources to implement a practical ecosystem monitoring system.
Monitoring activities are already carried out by several agencies; the Environmental Protection Agency measures air and water quality, the National Science
Foundation administers the National Ecological Observatory Network and Long
Term Ecological Research Network programs, U.S. Geological Survey has the
National Water Quality Assessment, the United States Forest Service carries out
forest inventories, the Department of Energy and the National Aeronautical and
Space Administration administer Ameriflux (which measures ecosystem level
exchanges of CO2, water, energy, and momentum across the Americas), and the
Department of Agriculture carries out agricultural and soil inventories. Several
nonprofit groups also maintain extensive databases of ecological information.
However, each of these efforts measures different things, for different reasons,
and the parts do not add up to a whole that provides the nation with a comprehensive understanding of the state of its ecosystems.
Ultimately, monitoring is required that is both intensive (covering eco­
system services in depth) and extensive (covering all kinds of ecosystems, and
at regional and national scales). Current efforts focus on in-depth understanding of a few natural ecosystems and crisis intervention in damaged environments with measurements limited to a few key physical air or water quality
characteristics.
Considerable research has already explored how ecosystem services can be
measured. A 2000 NRC report, Ecological Indicators for the Nation (National
Research Council, 2000a), recommended a set of national ecological indicators
that would measure the extent and status of the nation’s ecosystems, the nation’s
ecological capital, and ecological functioning or performance. The years since
that report have seen many advances in ecosystem science, technology, and computational and mathematical approaches to describing ecosystem function. GIS,
GPS, and remote sensing technologies (providing higher resolution and lowered
costs) have led to rapid advances in ecology. GPS units are now cheap enough
to be part of every ecologist’s toolbox, allowing accurate mapping of species’
distributions against existing maps of geological profiles, hydrological dynamics,
and other environmental information. These technological advances have been
as important in ecological research as inexpensive high-throughput sequencing
has been in molecular, cell, comparative, and evolutionary biology.
The Heinz Center for Science, Economics, and the Environment, established in 1995, pulls together information from all of these sources to produce

reports on indicators including two editions, in 2002 and 2008, of the comprehensive State of the Nation’s Ecosystems (H. John Heinz III Center for Science,
Economics, and the Environment, 2002, 2008). The Heinz Center acknowledges, however, that the current system is fragmented. A recent article by three
Heinz Center directors (O’Malley et al., 2009) contended that—
[A] coherent and well-targeted environmental monitoring system will not appear without concerted action at the national level. The nation’s environmental monitoring ­efforts
grew up in specific agencies to meet specific program needs, and a combination of
lack of funding for integration, fragmented decision-making, and institutional inertia
cry out for a more strategic and effective approach. Without integrated environmental
information, policymakers lack a broad view of how the environment is changing and
risk wasting taxpayer dollars.

The article goes on to point out that—
[T]here are data gaps for many geographic areas, important ecological endpoints, and
contentious management challenges as well as mismatched datasets that make it difficult
to detect trends over time or to make comparisons across geographic scales. . . . In The
State of the Nation’s Ecosystems 2008, only a third of the indicators could be reported
with all of the needed data, another third had only partial data, and the remaining
40 indicators were left blank, largely because there were not enough data to present a
big-picture view.

No single scientific community, federal agency, or foundation can develop
and implement a comprehensive set of ecosystem indicators, capable of monitoring the ecosystem services on which the nation relies. The New ­ Biology
approach––coordinating the resources already available and supporting
research that integrates biology with physical and earth sciences, engineering,
and computation––can be applied to build on such existing resources as the
2000 NRC report and the Heinz Center’s 2002 and 2008 reports to evaluate
potential ecological indicators in light of current capabilities and develop an
implementable system for monitoring ecosystem function.
The goal of a monitoring system is to provide an accurate assessment of the
services provided by ecosystems and to indicate when those services are at risk.
The next step for the New Biology is to develop the knowledge and means to
respond to the information provided by the monitoring system––to minimize
the impact of human activities on ecosystem services and, even more importantly, to restore ecosystem function where it has been compromised.
Advance Understanding of Ecosystem Restoration
Medical doctors follow diagnosis with treatment options. The “medicine”
of ecosystem treatment, however, has few arrows in its quiver. We do not
currently have the tools needed to manage the biosphere. Between the two

extremes of, on the one hand, preserving some ecosystems in their pristine state
and, on the other hand, carrying out human activities with minimal regard to
measuring or predicting their ecological impact, there are few options. The
capacity to evaluate human impacts on ecosystem services and to provide
options for minimizing or healing those impacts is another potentially valuable
contribution of the New Biology.
A growing subfield in ecology is restoration, which ultimately holds the
key to recovery of ecosystem services in heavily degraded areas (e.g., recovery
of watershed function), and perhaps even to mitigation of climate change
through designing ecosystems with even greater capacity for removing carbon
from the atmosphere. Ecological restoration has a role to play in improving
crop productivity, reducing energy needs and slowing the loss of biodiversity.
The question the New Biology can address is: Once we know that a system is at
risk, how do we return it to a state that is more capable of providing ecosystem
services?
Integrate Basic Knowledge about Ecosystem
Function with Problem-Solving Techniques
Developing a science of ecosystem restoration will require integration of
many fields of knowledge. For example, ecologists rely on soils science and
hydrological studies for meaningful ecological niche modeling, which is heavily
used in conservation (e.g., reserve design) and in climate change impact studies.
Interdisciplinary work is already common as many ecosystem biologists reside
in Earth Sciences Departments and institutes, and climate change biologists collaborate as often with meteorologists as with other biologists. Facilitating these
efforts and integrating organismal, agricultural, evolutionary, and comparative
biologists, engineers, computational scientists, and others to focus on the question of ecosystem restoration has the potential to provide treatment options for
critical ecosystems. The New Biology could contribute to the development of a
field one might call ecosystem engineering, analogous to the MD-PhDs of the
biomedical field, grounded in both research and treatment.
A New Biology Approach to the Energy Challenge:
Expand Sustainable Alternatives to Fossil Fuels
World annual requirements for energy grow at about the same rate as Gross
Domestic Product (GDP) and are expected to increase by around 60 percent by
2030. Most of this increase will come from rapidly developing economies like
India and China (IEA, 2008). More than three-fourths of the current need is
currently met by fossil sources (EIA, 2007). The United States is no exception

to this pattern, with our high dependence on such carbon-rich fossil fuels as oil,
coal, and natural gas for our energy needs. Fossil fuels increase carbon dioxide
emissions, which are linked to increased risk of global warming (Houghton
& Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. Working Group I., 2001). A
growing population, desiring a higher standard of living, has put even greater
demands on our energy supplies. Thus we face the consequences of burning of
high sulfur coal, depletion of petroleum reserves for transportation, and excess
CO2 being produced as stored hydrocarbon reserves are depleted. The environment is damaged both by the extraction of these resources and then by the subsequent release of the byproducts of their use. Sustainable, efficient, and clean
sources of energy are crucial to reducing our dependence on and the depletion
of fossil fuels. The New Biology can help propel the sustainable production of
biofuels, and the United States could be the leader in this increasingly important
industrial sector.
Direct conversion of biomass to thermal energy via combustion was our
first source of energy. Improvements in biomass combustion continue, as does
development of liquid fuels derived from thermochemical conversion of raw
cellulose to liquid fuels. The major motivation for producing more biofuels is
to reduce dependence on petroleum-based transportation fuel. In 2007, Congress passed the Energy Independence and Security Act (Public Law 110-140).
Among other things, the legislation included the Renewable Fuel Standard
(RFS) program, which calls for the volume of renewable fuel required to be
blended into gasoline from 9 billion gallons in 2008 to 36 billion gallons by
2022. In 2007, the United States consumed 176 billion gallons of fuel for transportation, so 36 billion gallons of renewable fuel (assuming equivalent energy
content per unit volume) would cover roughly 20 percent of our transportation
fuel needs (Bureau of Transportation Statistics, 2009). The RFS further stipulates that a substantial fraction of the biofuel must be advanced or cellulosebased fuels, rather than ethanol derived from corn.
In fact, technology is not currently available to meet the RFS, but the New
Biology offers the possibility of advancing the fundamental knowledge, tools
and technology needed to achieve it. Making efficient use of plant ­materials—
biomass––to make biofuels is a systems challenge, and this is where the New
­Biology can make a critical contribution. At its simplest, the system consists of
a plant that serves as the source of cellulose and an industrial process that turns
the cellulose into a useful product. There are many points in the system that can
be optimized: choosing the right crops as sources of biomass, engineering these
crops so that they grow with a minimum of energy, fertilizer, and water input
and produce cellulose that is easy to ferment, and engineering enzymes that
are efficient at digesting the cellulose. The optimization of each of these steps
depends on the others, so maintaining a view of the whole system is important.
Each of these steps involves a large number of choices. Which plants can
produce the most biomass with the least input of fertilizers and water and the

A NEW BIOLOGY FOR THE 21ST CENTURY

least impact on the land needed to grow food and sustain ecosystem services?
How can those plants be modified to produce biomass even more efficiently or
produce cellulose that is easier to digest? How can that biomass be converted
to fuel? What enzymes and metabolic pathways have evolved in microbes that
could be adapted for biomass conversion? How can the fermentation process
be optimized to produce the most fuel at lowest cost? Work in all of these areas
is underway in laboratories and companies, but the New Biology approach can
tackle this challenge in a comprehensive way, bringing together expertise from
many different scientific communities, federal agencies, and the private sector to generate the advances in fundamental knowledge and translational and
developmental research needed to provide innovative solutions.
Identifying and Optimizing Sources of Biomass for Biofuel
Today, the United States leads the world in the volume of biofuels produced, and nearly all U.S. biofuel today is made by using fermentation to
convert starch from corn into ethanol. More than 30 percent of the U.S. corn
crop is used for ethanol production (USDA, 2009). As a result of the application of biotechnology to agriculture, per-acre corn yields are increasing at 2 to
3 percent per year (Egli, 2008). Grain alone, however, will not allow dramatic
expansion of biofuel production, and must be supplemented, and ultimately
replaced, with other sources of biomass. Development of energy crops that are
direct sources of fermentable sugars, such as sugarcane or sweet sorghum, or
sources of cellulosic materials, such as switchgrass, miscanthus, or agricultural
and forestry byproducts, is an important priority. The same fundamental knowledge, tools, and technologies developed in the New Biology approach to the
food challenge would be directly applicable here: understanding plant growth;
advancing genetically informed breeding, transgenics and genetic engineering;
advancing biodiversity, systematics and evolutionary genomics; and understanding crops as ecosystems. Thus, both the agriculture and energy research
communities will be stakeholders in the effort to transform plant breeding
capabilities.
Identifying and Optimizing Microbial Biocatalysts
Ethanol is a first-generation biofuel, produced via fermentation of sugars
by wild-type yeast. Ethanol has limitations, such as low energy density, high
vapor pressure, and water solubility. By combining recent advances in technologies such as high-throughput sequencing, automated gene expression measurement, and metabolic engineering, future generations of biofuels are now within
reach. Advanced biofuels targets include higher alcohols, long-chain fatty acids
and derivatives, even olefinic and alkane derivatives––all products that can be
made by microorganisms, with subsequent chemical processing in some cases.

HOW THE NEW BIOLOGY CAN ADDRESS SOCIETAL CHALLENGES

31

For each fuel molecule, microbial hosts are being selected, metabolic pathways
are being identified, and using recombinant methods, organisms are being
engineered to deliver biofuels at acceptable rates and yields. The challenge
for advanced biofuels is to be able to produce fuel more cheaply than using
yeast to ferment starch or sugar into ethanol. Again, the unique contribution
the New Biology can add to these existing efforts is the coordination of efforts
to discover, characterize, and engineer microbes so that they serve as factories
for high production rates, with efforts to engineer production systems that
maximize those microbes’ productivity, for example by continuously adjusting
levels of nutrients and end-products. These optimized systems will allow nextgeneration biofuels to compete with gasoline at prevailing prices.
Approaching Biofuel Production as a Systems Challenge
Clearly, the road to meeting the U.S. Renewable Fuel Standard consists
of multiple steps, steps that are interdependent. An integrated approach that
includes scientists and engineers expert at each step is essential. The combined
efforts of plant scientists, microbiologists, ecologists, chemical and industrial
process engineers, molecular biologists, geneticists, and many others are needed
to develop and optimize the biomass-to-biofuel system. Combining the strengths
of these communities does not necessarily mean bringing these experts into the
same facility. Indeed, advancing communication and informatics infrastructures
make it easier than ever to assemble a virtual collaboration. The New Biology
Initiative proposed in this report would provide the resources to attract the
best minds from across the scientific landscape to the problem, ensure that
innovations and advances are swiftly communicated, and provide the tools and
technologies needed to succeed.
A coordinated effort to optimize the conversion of biomass to biofuel
would create knowledge and technologies that would have an immediate and
direct impact on other sectors, including therapeutics and industrial materials,
which can also be produced in this way (Box 2.2).
A New Biology Approach to the Health Challenge:
Understanding Individual Health
The New Biology approach to the environmental challenge aims to make
it possible to monitor ecosystem function and restore that function when it is
compromised. The goal of a New Biology approach to health is similar––to
make it possible to monitor each individual’s health and treat any malfunction
in a manner that is tailored to that individual. In other words, the goal is to
provide individually predictive surveillance and care. In both cases, reaching
these goals means understanding how the interactions of myriad components
are related to overall system function.

Biomass to Biomaterials and Biosynthesis of
Chemicals and Therapeutics
Liquid transportation fuels represent by far the largest-volume opportunity for
renewable products made by living organisms from biomass. Chemicals and materials
made from petroleum account for about 10 percent of total U.S. oil consumption. The
same fermentation-based technology that is being developed for biofuels can also
be harnessed to replace petroleum-based materials and make many other useful
products.
Microbes can also be engineered to produce chemicals, industrial enzymes,
and therapeutics at industrial scales. Insulin was the first material produced using an
engineered organism, in the 1980s. Many pharmaceutically active proteins, ­antibiotics,
vitamins, and amino acids for food and animal feed followed. Microorganisms are
now widely used to produce industrial enzymes for many uses. Fermentation-based
large-scale (>10 ktons/year) production of chemicals and materials is an emerging
opportunity. For example, lactic acid, produced by bacteria, can be polymerized into
a substance that has useful properties in both fiber and molded form. Large-volume
­production of propanediol (PDO), using an engineered E. coli host, was commercialized
in 2007. PDO is used in applications ranging from deicing fluids to personal care products. BioPDO is also an important component of poly (trimethylene ­terephthalate), a
polymer with true engineering properties. We can now foresee a range of such chemical
building blocks as succinic acid, dodecanedioic acid, and p-hydroxybenzoic acid being
made from biomass via fermentation (Pacific Northwest National Laboratory, 2009).

At present, medical decision-making is often based on probabilities. For
example, high cholesterol levels are associated with heart disease and earlystage cancers metastasize at a predictable rate. But some individuals with high
cholesterol do not develop heart disease, and metastasis of a given tumor type
occurs with frightening speed in some individuals and not at all in others. Each
individual has a unique set of genes and a unique environmental history, yet
the relationship of all of this variation to health is uncertain. Understanding the
relationship of an individual’s genetic makeup and environmental history to that
individual’s health risks, disease susceptibility, and response to treatment is a challenge well beyond current capabilities. Critical to improving that understanding
is a quantum leap in our ability to understand the functioning of and interactions
among complex networks, or systems of interconnected components.
The Genotype-Phenotype Challenge
It seems likely that it will soon be economically feasible to determine the
full genome sequence of every individual. An individual’s genetic make-up, or

HOW THE NEW BIOLOGY CAN ADDRESS SOCIETAL CHALLENGES

33

genotype, is directly related to his or her phenotype (i.e., the various traits of
an individual that can be observed or measured). Because genetic sequences
serve as the blueprints for all biological processes, genetic variation affects the
functioning of all of the networks that underlie human health.
As if the challenge of understanding the connection between an individual’s
genome sequence and health were not difficult enough, two additional factors
add further layers of complexity. First, feedback from the environment affects
how the genetic blueprint is executed. For example, individuals who live at
high altitudes, where the air holds less oxygen, produce more red blood cells.
All individuals have the genetic potential for this adaptation, but it only occurs
under particular environmental circumstances. Diet, exercise, exposure to sunlight, chemicals, viruses, and bacteria––all of these and much more can affect
the connection between genotype and phenotype. Furthermore, new kinds of
gene regulation continue to be discovered, including epigenetic mechanisms
(mechanisms that change gene expression without changing the underlying
gene sequence) and mechanisms like small, interfering RNA, in which short
RNA fragments regulate expression or translation.
The second layer of complication recently added to the challenge of understanding the genotype-phenotype connection is the discovery that our own
human genes are not the only genetic material affecting our health. Humans are
intimately associated with a complex microbial community—the microbiome.
Rapidly accumulating discoveries of the many essential roles of this microbial
consortium are redefining our understanding of human health and making it
clear that a true understanding of human health must take into account not
only the human genome, but also the genomes of each human’s microbial community. For example, differences in the microbiomes of twins has been shown
to be associated with obese versus lean physiological states (Turnbaugh et al.,
2009). The normal, healthy human body contains ten times more microbes
than human cells, and these microbes carry out many essential functions. The
microbes in the human intestine synthesize essential amino acids and vitamins,
and digest complex carbohydrates (Backhed et al., 2005). Genomic and other
new technologies are now making it possible for life scientists to characterize
the human microbiome and the factors that influence the distribution, function, and evolution of our microbial partners. Recognizing the importance of
the microbiome means assessing how these evolutionarily ancient microbial
partnerships influence health and predisposition to diseases. In other words, the
connection of genotype to phenotype must include not only the human genome,
but also the genomes of the microbes that live in and on us. The important
influence of viruses on the genotype-phenotype connection must also be taken
into account, from their role in cancer (for example, HIV and Kaposi’s sarcoma, human papilloma virus and cervical cancer) to the role that the immune
response to persistent viruses plays in the development of autoimmune and
other chronic diseases. Understanding the role of microbes and viruses in

34

A NEW BIOLOGY FOR THE 21ST CENTURY

human health is a major challenge, but it also holds the promise of providing
new intervention points for prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of disease.
A growing body of evidence suggests that many diseases, including types 1
and 2 diabetes, coronary artery disease, and glioblastoma, typically result from
small defects in many genes, rather than catastrophic defects in a few genes
(Altshuler et al., 2008). It is likely that many different combinations of genetic
changes, acting in the context of particular environmental influences (for example, a viral infection), can produce the same disease, so that understanding
how genes work together in regulatory networks, and how those networks are
affected by external factors, will be crucial to untangling the intricate web of
interactions associated with a particular disease phenotype.
Large-scale studies that associate genotype to phenotype are rapidly identifying many, many genetic variations (both human and microbial) and environmental factors that are associated with specific diseases. The key word in that
sentence is “associated.” While some of these variations may have a direct role
in causing disease, there is currently a substantial gap between discovering an
association and uncovering a causal mechanism. But ultimately, if health care
is to move from treatment based on statistical likelihood to treatment based
on each individual’s specific circumstances––in other words, truly personalized medicine––the chasm between genotype and phenotype will have to be
bridged. This is a challenge that is beyond the scope of any single Institute
at the NIH. Indeed, it is a challenge that will demand a New Biology-driven
research community empowered by scientific and technical resources from
across the federal government, the broad community of scientists, and the
private sector. Unraveling the genotype-phenotype connection will require
combining increasingly sophisticated genotype-phenotype associations with
experimentation, modeling, systems analyses, and comparative biology.
Understanding Networks
Between the starting point of an individual’s gene sequences and the endpoint of that individual’s health is a web of interacting networks of staggering
complexity. Recent advances are enabling biomedical researchers to begin to
study humans more comprehensively, as individuals whose health is determined
by the interactions between these complex structural and metabolic networks.
On the path from genotype to phenotype, each network is interlocked with
many others through intricate interfaces, such as feedback loops. Study of the
complex networks that monitor, report, and react to changes in human health is
an area of biology that is poised for exponential development. These networks
consist of circuits of interacting genes, gene products, metabolites, and signals
that function together much like electronic integrated circuits. Unlike electronic
circuits, however, almost all of the components of living networks are constantly
changing, with results that ripple through all of the other networks. Tools and

35

methodologies are being developed that can detect, synthesize, and process
complex biological information at a network level, image cellular events in real
time, delineate how proteins interact, and access single sites within the DNA
library of the cell. Computational and modeling approaches are beginning to
allow analysis of these complex systems, with the ultimate goal of predicting
how variations in individual components affect the function of the overall system. Many of the pieces are identified, and some circuits and interactions have
been described, but true understanding is still well beyond reach. Combining
fundamental knowledge with physical and computational analysis, modeling
and engineering, in other words, the New Biology approach, is going to be the
only way to bring understanding of these complex networks to a useful level
of predictability.
Such complex events as how embryos develop or how cells of the immune
system differentiate (that is, the actual processes by which an individual’s
phenotype––the appearance and characteristics of the individual––come into
being) must be viewed from a global yet detailed perspective because they are
composed of a collection of molecular mechanisms that include junctions that
interconnect vast networks of genes. It is essential to take a broader view and
analyze entire gene regulatory networks, and the circuitry of events underlying
complex biological systems. Data obtained from mutational, chemical genetic
or imaging analyses of organisms such as Drosophila, C. elegans, Arabidopsis,
mouse, sea urchin, and other species will continue to uncover rich sets of interactions between gene products that comprise such regulatory networks. Analysis of developing and differentiating systems at a network level will be critical
for understanding complex events of how tissues and organs are assembled.
These studies have obvious import in regenerative medicine.
Similarly, networks of proteins interact at a biochemical level to form
complex metabolic machines that produce distinct cellular products. Understanding these and other complex networks from a holistic perspective offers
the possibility of diagnosing human diseases that arise from subtle changes in
network components.
Perhaps the most complex, fascinating, and least understood networks
involve circuits of nerve cells that act in a coordinated fashion to produce
learning, memory, movement, and cognition. These studies can be approached
both experimentally, at the cellular level, as well as at the whole brain level via
functional imaging approaches. In addition, recent computational approaches
allow modeling of neurobiological systems that provide valuable predictive
information.
Understanding networks will require increasingly sophisticated, quantitative technologies to measure intermediates and output, which in turn may
demand conceptual and technical advances in mathematical and computational
approaches to the study of networks.

A NEW BIOLOGY FOR THE 21ST CENTURY

Studying Complex Systems Directly in Humans
Work in model organisms, as discussed earlier, is immensely productive because fundamental developmental and metabolic pathways have been
conserved throughout evolution and are shared among many organisms. In
fact, model organisms are increasingly useful as genomics makes it possible to
understand the differences and similarities among organisms at an ever more
detailed level. Advances in imaging, high-throughput technologies, and computational biology increasingly make it possible to relate model system information directly to the study of complex systems in the human. New technologies
and sciences that allow, for example, comprehensive comparisons of genomes
and gene expression will enable much more sophisticated associations between
genotype and phenotype.
Another approach to the genotype-phenotype challenge is to survey the
“read-out” from the genome: that is, the collection of proteins and metabolites that are the end-products of gene activities. Technologies for characterizing proteomes (all the proteins in a sample) and metabolomes (all the
metabolites in a sample) are less capable and more expensive than sequencing
technologies. But they are increasingly being used to generate profiles from
body fluids, such as blood, sweat, and urine, which contain the products and
byproducts of metabolic processes that reflect a composite of an individual’s
genomic activity together with that of his or her particular microbiome. These
profiles can be used, for example, to design tailor-made drugs (i.e., drugs
that would take into account differences in how individuals break down and
assimilate a given pharmaceutical). Ultimately, high-throughput assessment
of the metabolome could provide a remarkably precise picture of the overall
activities within and on the human body and critical insights into the relationship of “composite genotype” to phenotype. Achieving those insights,
however, will require new technologies to measure proteins and metabolites,
massive collections of samples from healthy and sick individuals, and novel
mathematical and computational tools, and concepts to discern the patterns
associated with health and disease. Such a task dwarfs the complexity of the
Human Genome Project.
A Systems Approach to the Genotype-Phenotype Challenge
Unraveling the genotype-phenotype connection will require that the efforts
of biomedical researchers be complemented and supplemented by the skills
and different approaches of engineers, mathematicians, and physical and computational scientists. The efforts of scientists nurtured by separate institutes
of the NIH will need to be joined by those supported by NSF and DOE, for
example, who study non-human organisms and who create and support various multi-user facilities. Agencies like the National Institute of Standards and
Technology could add interdisciplinary expertise in the development of mea-

surement technologies, pharmaceutical companies their extensive databases,
and nonprofit disease research foundations their refined expertise. By providing
the framework for these communities to work together to address the challenge
of understanding the genotype-phenotype connection, the New Biology can
accelerate fundamental understanding of the systems that underlie health and
the development of the tools and technologies that will in turn lead to more
efficient approaches to developing therapeutics (Box 2.3). And just as with
sequencing technology, the technological and conceptual breakthroughs that
emerge from these efforts could revolutionize the capacity and sophistication
of all biological research.
Interconnected Problems, Interconnected Solutions
The future holds truly imposing challenges for humankind: efficiently
improving the sustainable productivity of diverse food crops, producing sustainable substitutes for fossil fuels, monitoring and restoring ecosystem services, and understanding and promoting human health. The New Biology
described in this report, if properly nurtured and supported, has the potential
to contribute to real progress in meeting these challenges and many tools and
approaches will be shared for all four problem areas. The projected impacts are
significant, from both a societal and economic perspective. Furthermore, the
importance of the challenges to which the New Biology will contribute ensure

BOX 2.3
Developing Therapeutics to
Prevent, Treat, and Cure Disease
The future of therapeutics lies in the application of new technologies as tools
for detecting and treating diseases. Therapeutic efforts will also benefit from an
increased understanding of networks. Therapeutics that focus on a single driver
may miss both the critical role played by other genes as well as the ease with which
a malignant cell, for instance, may utilize alternative parts of the larger network
to side-step the drug’s effect, and thus continue to thrive. Similarly, adverse side
effects can result when intervention in one network causes unforeseen changes in
others. Complicated as these networks are, we are now in a position to study the
response of complex systems to a range of perturbagens (both natural mutations
and introduced chemicals), providing an important opportunity to probe the pattern
of interactions and refine the model. This approach may also identify underappreciated network pressure points—possible drug targets or biomarkers that are less
evident in traditional linear models.

Why Now?

The moment is ripe to invest in the development of the new biology
because the life sciences are in the midst of a historical period analogous to
the early 20th century in the physical sciences. The discovery of the electron
in 1897 marked the beginning of a major turning point in the history of science. Over the next few decades, physics, chemistry, and astronomy were all
transformed. Physicists uncovered the fundamental constituents of matter and
energy and discovered that these constituents interact in unanticipated ways.
Chemists related the structure and properties of substances to the interactions
of electrons surrounding atomic nuclei. Astronomers related the light received
from stars and the sun to the chemical properties of the atoms generating that
light. In this way, new connections within the physical sciences became apparent and drove further advances.
These theoretical advances also led to practical applications that transformed society. Having a “parts list” of the physical world enabled scientists and
engineers to develop technologies that would not have been possible without
this understanding. These technologies led in turn to the electronic industry,
the computer industry, and the information technology industry, which together
have created a world that could scarcely have been imagined a century ago.
Before the transition associated with the discovery of the electron, scientists
gathered increasing amounts of data, but those data could not be put to full use
because of the lack of a conceptual framework. After that discovery, previously
gathered data took on new usefulness, entirely new areas of inquiry emerged,
and discovery and application accelerated rapidly. Such discoveries are critical
junctures that send science and society in new directions.
These moments of rapid acceleration of scientific progress have different
origins. Some occur due to technological advances, such as the invention of the
telescope or microscope. Some occur due to conceptual advances, such as the

description of evolution by natural selection or the development of ­relativity
theory. In some cases there is a principal driver; in others, multiple factors
combine to accelerate progress. New discoveries and new technologies do not
guarantee that discovery will accelerate. The world must be ready for change,
and the tools and resources must be available to capitalize on new capabilities
or knowledge.
This committee believes that the life sciences currently stand at such a point
of inflection. Drawing ever nearer is the possibility of understanding how all of the
parts of living systems operate together in biological organisms and ecosystems.
This understanding could have a profound influence on the future of the human
species. It could help produce enough food for a growing population, prevent
and cure chronic and acute diseases, meet future needs for energy, and manage
the preservation of Earth’s biological heritage for future generations.
The approach of this moment of opportunity in the life sciences has become
increasingly evident over the last decade, and in many ways, the New Biology has
already begun to emerge. It has become common to hear statements that the 21st
century will be the century of biology. What are the factors that have brought
biology to this point? And what current ideas, tools and approaches represent
the emergence of new capabilities?
The Fundamental Unity of Biology Has
Never Been Clearer or More Applicable
The great potential of the life sciences to contribute simultaneously to so
many areas of societal need rests on the fact that biology, like physics and chemistry, relies on a small number of core organizational principles. The ­reality of
these core commonalities, conserved throughout evolution––that DNA is the
chemical of inheritance, that the cell is the smallest independent unit of life, that
cells can be organized into complex, multicellular organisms, that all organisms
function within interdependent communities and that photo-systems capture
the solar radiation to provide energy for all of life processes––means that any
knowledge gained about one genome, cell, organism, community, or ecosystem
is useful in understanding many others. Because living systems are so complex, much biological experimentation has had to focus on individual or small
numbers of components within a single organizational level. The reductionist
approach has helped reveal many of the basic molecular, cellular, physiological,
and ecological processes that govern life.
This work needs to continue in the future. Many aspects of biological function remain unknown on all levels. But biologists are now gaining the capability
to go beyond the interactions of components within a single level of biological
organization and the study of one or a few components at a time. As microbiologist and evolutionist Carl Woese said over 30 years ago, “Our task now is
to resynthesize biology; put the organism back into its environment; connect it

WHY NOW?

again to its evolutionary past. . . . The time has come for biology to enter the
nonlinear world (Woese & Fox, 1977). The practical ability to achieve Woese’s
vision is now beginning to emerge. Biologists are increasingly able to integrate
information across many organisms, from multiple levels of organization (such
as cells, organisms, and populations) and about entire systems (such as all the
genes in a genome or all the cells in a body) to gain a new integrated understanding that incorporates more and more of the complexity that characterizes
biological systems (Box 3.1).
As the biological sciences advanced during the 20th century, separate fields
emerged to tackle the complex subsystems that together make up living systems. Genetics, cell biology, ecology, microbiology, biochemistry, and ­molecular
biology each took on various aspects of the challenge. The sheer volume of
knowledge generated in each of these subdisciplines made it increasingly difficult for researchers who studied organisms to keep up with the progress
being made by researchers studying cells, and those studying molecules rarely
interacted with those studying ecosystems. Scientists in each of these specialties

attended separate meetings, published in different journals, and generally had
little communication. Although it was understood on a conceptual level that
the organizational levels are tightly interlocked, most researchers focused on a
single system in great detail.
Recently, though, the connections among the fields of the life sciences
have become easier to study. For example, tools and concepts that arose within
individual subdisciplines within the life sciences are now applied throughout biology. Thus, biochemistry and molecular biology are now techniques
that are applied nearly universally across the life sciences. Genomic data and
techniques have widespread applications in biology and reveal the connections among fields. In particular, genomic comparisons reveal the common
descent of organisms and enable researchers to make comparisons of different
types of organisms (Box 3.2), while also highlighting the differences that have
arisen in separate evolutionary lineages. These cross-species investigations have
started to blur the boundaries between such fields as microbiology, botany, and
­zoology. Discovering and understanding the features shared by all living organisms, and the differences that make each system or organism unique, has never
been easier or more productive.
Despite the development of common tools, questions, and methodologies,
scientists within subdisciplines that were historically separate still do not have
the optimal level of interaction. This is particularly true when the goal is to
develop new science linking multiple levels of organization in biological systems. To accelerate progress in the life sciences, researchers from different subdisciplines need to interact and collaborate to a greater extent. Presenting these
communities with a common problem to solve will provide an opportunity for
them to bring their different skills and perspectives to bear and accelerate the
development of conceptual and technological approaches to understanding the
connections between the different levels of biological organization (Box 3.3).
New Players are Entering the Field,
Bringing New Skills and Ideas
Just as integration is becoming more important within the life sciences,
immense value is emerging from the integration of the life sciences with other
disciplines. For example, the recent and continuing revolution in genomics
has come from an integration of techniques and concepts from engineering,
robotics, computer science, mathematics, statistics, chemistry, and many other
fields. The precipitous decline in the cost of genome sequencing would not have
been possible without a combination of engineering of equipment, robotics for
automation, and chemistry and biochemistry to make the sequencing accurate.
Similarly, expertise from fields as diverse as evolutionary biology, computer
science, mathematics, and statistics was necessary to analyze raw genomic data
and to extend the use of these data to other fields.

WHY NOW?

BOX 3.2
Common Descent and the
Integration of the Life Sciences
Though every species on the planet is unique in some ways, all species are linked
to each other by common descent: that is, any two species evolved from a common
ancestor that lived at some point in the past. As a result, all species share some biological properties due to the inheritance of features present in their common ancestor.
Work in one species can be of direct relevance to the understanding of other species
because processes may be identical or highly similar between the two due to their
shared descent. This is part of the reason for the importance of “model organisms.”
Studies in mammalian model systems such as the mouse have led to major insights
into human biology. Examples include studies of cholesterol metabolism (which led
to the development of the statins, a class of drugs that have dramatically reduced
atherosclerosis and cardiovascular disease; beta adrenergic receptors, which led to
the development of beta blockers for the treatment of hypertension and heart disease;
and tumor necrosis factor, which led to the development of therapeutic antibodies that
provide relief to people with rheumatoid arthritis.
Frequently, discoveries in one organism have implications even for very distantly
related organisms. The degree of relatedness of two organisms, which is determined
in large measure by the amount of time that has elapsed since their common ancestor,
indicates how much of their biology they share. Consequently, the older a biological
process, the more likely that it will be shared by a great number of organisms. Thus,
an important mechanism for regulating protein levels in cells, called “small interfering
RNA” or siRNA, was initially discovered in plants, but was then found to be at work
in human cells and shows great promise as a new approach for drug development
(Carthew & Sontheimer, 2009). Even more distantly related organisms can share
common genes and pathways. Studies of mutational processes in the bacterium
Escherichia coli and the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae helped identify the genes
that are defective in hereditary nonpolyposis colon cancer (HNPCC) in humans (Fishel
& Kolodner, 1995).
Because no two species are exactly the same, work in model organisms does not
always translate perfectly into other species, even if the two species are quite closely
related. For example, the most promising AIDS vaccine candidate failed in human
clinical trials (Buchbinder et al., 2008) despite showing promise in experiments with
monkeys (Shiver et al., 2002). Animal models of neurodegenerative disease, such
as Alzheimer’s or Parkinson’s, and of psychiatric diseases, such as schizophrenia
or depression, do not fully reproduce the clinical signs seen in humans with these
disorders. Moreover, drugs shown to have efficacy in such animal models have failed
in human clinical trials. Better understanding of which characteristics are shared and
which are not is a major outstanding challenge in biology, which, when met, will greatly
improve our ability to predict how results in one organism will apply to another.

BOX 3.3
Eco-Evo-Devo: Integration across Subdisciplines
The field of evolutionary-developmental biology (known as evo-devo) has
emerged in the last 15 years. It offers a powerful example of the potential for integration of biological theory and practice across the hierarchy of life, from molecules to
ecosystems. Studies in evo-devo have demonstrated that different animal body plans
can result from the alternative expression patterns of a “toolbox” of conserved genes
(such as the homeobox genes) and gene networks. The research frontiers of this
field lie in the continued development of computational and mathematical tools for
the study of the links between development and evolution, and determination of the
environmental cues that underlie developmental processes over evolutionary time and
within the life of a given individual.
As an indication of the kind of mathematical and computational tools needed,
analyses of gene sequence data to derive the phylogeny of the animal kingdom
required the full-time use of 120 processors over several months (Hejnol et al., in
press). Widespread application of such approaches is prohibited by technical constraints, demonstrating the need for significantly more efficient means of computational analysis for such large datasets.
The field of evo-devo is now poised for integration across the entire hierarchy
of molecular through organismal biology. For example, at the broadest levels, biologists have long known that the environmental parameters, such as temperature and
length of daylight, can profoundly influence developmental processes. However, until
recently, developmental biologists have focused almost entirely on an understanding
of the gene-to-organism aspects of development—that is, they have studied how the
cells and tissues of an organism progress from fertilization through death. Much must
still be done to understand these processes, but at the same time they can now be
placed within a context of the “ecology of development,” or eco-devo.
Developmental processes are often the “canaries” of environmental perturbation.
For example, the biogeographic distributions of many marine animals are determined
by the temperature sensitivity of their larval stages. The distribution of large numbers
of marine taxa is likely to be dramatically altered by either changes in ocean temperatures or in ocean circulation patterns. The ripple effects of such changes would affect
many aspects of human interface with the oceans, including fisheries. Predicting and
minimizing the impact of environmental changes on development, species ranges,
and ecosystem services will require collaboration among developmental biologists,
ecologists, computational scientists, oceanographers, climate scientists, and others
to integrate their knowledge of different parts of the system.

The need to analyze these data has driven a rapid expansion in the application of mathematics to biology. In particular, two aspects of computation
have been critical. First, algorithms and computational power for analysis of
large data sets help make sense of the massive amounts of data produced by
genomic studies. Second, the placement of data in accessible digital databases
has greatly improved the ability to share information and build on prior work.

WHY NOW?

Such advances in computation have been critical in many areas of biology, such
as ecosystem studies, conservation biology, evolutionary biology, and epidemiology. Each of these fields needs to handle large complex data sets, digitize and
share information, and test complex models and theories. To carry out this
work, biology has taken advantage of developments from other fields such
as physics, astronomy, and earth sciences, which have been for many years
­handling and analyzing massive data sets. Biological data sets are especially
challenging because they must cover so many diverse organisms and measure
many different characteristics that are constantly changing. Connecting those
data sets is extremely difficult but absolutely essential. Success will demand
close cooperation between the biologists and other scientists who study the system, computer scientists and mathematicians who develop new ways to analyze
the data, and engineers who bring expertise in modeling.
The issue of predictability is one major reason why even the present level
of integration of life sciences with engineering is already productive. Engineering offers a way of thinking that can contribute substantively to unraveling
the inherent complexity of biological science. The essence of engineering is
predictive design. Engineers seek to create systems that can operate reliably
within some circumscribed conditions. Moreover, engineering design is almost
always undertaken in the face of incomplete information. Even with technologies based on the physical and chemical sciences, there remain many poorly
characterized parameters. These limitations also apply to the biological systems,
even under the best of circumstances, so bringing an engineering mindset to
bear on biological questions is already beginning to add a new layer of value
to basic biological research.
Already, large numbers of physicists are being drawn into the biological
sciences and teams that include engineers, earth scientists, biologists, computational scientists, and others are beginning to conceive and approach biological
research in new ways (Boxes 3.4 and 3.5). What needs to occur next is for the
boundaries between disciplines to be broken down even further, much as the
boundaries within biology are being broken down. Making the New Biology
a reality will require not only the best in technology and science, but also a
uniquely interdisciplinary approach. Efforts to date must be seen as a “first
pass” rather than as a complete integration across multiple fields. The eventual
goal is for all scientists and engineers who study biological systems, whether
their in-depth training is in physics, mathematics, or chemical engineering, to
see themselves also as New Biologists, together contributing to the emergence
of the New Biology.
A Strong Foundation Has Already Been Built
Over the past 40 years, large investments have produced remarkable discoveries in the biological sciences. These discoveries have in a large part come

Brain-Machine Interfaces
Brain-machine interfaces are systems that allow people or animals to control
an external device through their brain activity. In 2003, scientists demonstrated that
monkeys with electrode implants in their brains, connected to a robotic arm, could
manipulate a robotic arm using only their thoughts. In 2008, scientists demonstrated
for the first time that brain signals from a monkey could make a robot walk on a treadmill. Scientists hope that such technology will be a great benefit for people who are
paralyzed or no longer have control of their physical movements. Such technology and
experiments will also lead to an increased understanding of how the brain works.
Brain-machine interfaces are an example of the convergence of different areas
of science and technology, and the importance of encouraging the emergence of the
New Biology as an integrated science. In the case of the brain-machine interface that
permitted monkey thoughts to make a robot walk, the electrodes were placed in the
part of the brain that earlier neurobiological studies had shown contained neurons
that fired when primates walk. Detailed video images of leg movements were then
combined with measurements of simultaneous brain cell activity, and then analyzed
using sophisticated computational methods. A robot, previously designed to closely
mimic human locomotion, was then programmed to respond to the brain signals in
the monkey (Blakeslee, 2008).

Nanotechnology—The Artificial Retina
The intertwined nature of the physical and life sciences is exemplified in the progress that has been made with the artificial retina, a device that resulted from a multilaboratory initiative supported by the Department of Energy. The device has already

the elderly. The nerves that are responsible for visual perception are at the surface of
the retina, such that these nerves are accessible to electrodes. Microchips composed
of ordered arrays of microscopic solar cells, capable of converting light into electrical
pulses, have been implanted into the eyes of animals and patients. With a 60-electrode
array, patients who had been blind are able to recognize objects and read a large print

from a reductionist focus on the basic molecular components of cells, which
has uncovered many of the molecular and cellular processes that govern life.
Work focusing on other levels of organization––organisms, communities, and
ecosystems––also has produced profound new insights.
Reductionism, which dissects and analyzes individual components of ­living
systems to infer mechanisms and to account for the behavior of the whole,
has been remarkably successful. And nothing in this report should be interpreted to suggest that support for what is often called “small science” should
­diminish—indeed it must grow––as the traditional approach to life sciences
research will continue to be a major source of discovery and innovation. It has
already revolutionized concepts of molecular interactions and cellular functioning, unraveled many of the processes that allow the development of a
multi-cellular organism from a fertilized egg, and identified many of the factors
that contribute to ecosystem stability. The effort to construct the “parts list”
for living systems has been a tremendously exciting intellectual adventure in
its own right and has had revolutionary outcomes, such as the biotechnology
revolution in medicine and agriculture. Continuing support for peer-reviewed,
investigator-initiated research across the broad spectrum of biological sciences
is critically important. The New Biology cannot replace––indeed, will not
flourish without––those efforts. Construction of an interstate highway does
not mean that local road maintenance can cease; the two systems depend on and
benefit from each other. Just so, continued support is needed for the science
that lays the groundwork for synthesis.
Past Investments Are Paying Big Dividends
The release in 2000 of the draft sequence of the human genome was the
product of a decade-long program that involved billions of dollars in investment. Funding for this project came from multiple U.S. government agencies
(especially the National Institutes of Health and the Department of Energy),
as well as from international governmental and private sources. In addition,
the project was spurred on by competition and collaboration with the private
sector, and by the development of new technologies.
The sequencing of the human genome was a goal akin to that of sending
humans to the moon, in that the science and technology needed to achieve
the mission did not exist when the goal was announced. But new technologies
and concepts were developed that have now become routine components of
all genome sequencing projects. The magnitude of the challenge spurred creative engagement leading to transformative advances. Many of the advances in
sequencing technology were incremental, but there were some game-changing
developments, like the demonstration that random shotgun sequencing could
be applied successfully to a large complex genome. That kind of transformative event cannot be predicted, but setting an important goal and providing

WHY NOW?

resources to reach it makes it more likely that creative minds will turn to developing revolutionary new approaches in addition to incremental progress.
Random shotgun sequencing, in which a computer detects overlaps of raw
sequencing “reads” to construct a complete genome, was not considered useful
for human genome sequencing due to the size and complexity of the human
genome. However, with the development of new sequencing and computational
methods (developed by engineers and computational scientists who turned their
efforts to solving biological problems), shotgun genome sequencing became
the standard method for genome sequencing and has led to an exponential
increase in the number of complete or nearly complete genomes available. This
in turn has led to the development of next-generation sequencing technologies that produce massive amounts of sequence data that can only be analyzed
computationally.
With the rapid development of sequencing and analysis capabilities, DNA
sequencing has become a routine tool in unanticipated areas. A good example
is metagenomics, which involves the random sequencing of DNA isolated from
environmental samples (such as from soil or water). Metagenomics provides
insight into what has previously been a mostly hidden world of microbial diversity, which itself is important because microbes have a fundamental impact on
the biogeochemical cycles of the planet and on the health of all its inhabitants
(Box 3.6). Another example is population genomics, where researchers are
generating multiple complete genomes of different individuals within a species.
These data, in turn, serve as valuable input for multiple areas of biology, including genetics, plant and animal breeding, and disease studies. Other biological
areas being transformed by genome sequencing include ecology, agriculture,
bioenergy research, forensics, and biodefense. None of this would have been
possible without the tools and resources developed as part of efforts geared
primarily toward sequencing the human genome.
The past 15 years have seen the development of tools and technologies that
have extended research capabilities well beyond genome sequencing. These
tools include methods to characterize the presence and quantities of many
other biological molecules, including transcribed RNA, proteins, metabolites,
molecules secreted by cells, DNA methylation patterns, and so on. The comprehensive sets of data generated about these biological molecules––commonly
referred to as “omes” (transcriptomes, proteomes, metabolomes, etc.)—are
as yet more difficult and expensive to generate and less standardized than
genomes. Advances in these technologies will be critical to rapid advances in
the life sciences.
Being able to collect and analyze these comprehensive data sets allows
researchers to relate and integrate the components of biological systems, a
pursuit known as systems biology. They also allow researchers to investigate
organisms other than the model systems that have been studied in the past.
With relatively little effort and cost, researchers can derive information on an

Microbial Genomics
Microbiology, through microbial genomics, is experiencing a renaissance enabled
by technological advances over the past several years that have allowed researchers
to explore the diversity and metabolic capabilities of a microbial world thousands of
times more diverse than before appreciated. This newfound potential is allowing us to
understand the critical position that microbes have in the biological world. ­Harnessing
the molecular biology and biochemistry of microbes, either in pure culture under
laboratory conditions or in naturally occurring complex communities, promises to
contribute significantly to addressing all four challenges presented in this report (Maloy
& Schaechter, 2006; Woese & Goldenfeld, 2009). Microbial communities support the
growth of plants, affect human health, are critical components of all ecosystems, and
can be engineered to produce fuels.
Until the advent of low cost, high throughout sequencing, most of the microbial
world was essentially invisible. By necessity, microbiologists focused on the study of
individual microbial species grown in pure laboratory culture. Increasingly, it is clear
that pure culture does not reflect how microbes live outside of the laboratory and that
the microbial world is more diverse, more important, and far more interdependent than
had previously been imagined. Interdependence––whereby complex communities of
microbes work together to carry out such functions as digesting food, breaking down
waste and capturing solar or geothermal energy––is the rule, and the many microbes
that can only grow in community were never isolated by classical culturing methods.
There is now a tremendous opportunity, and imperative, to develop ­methods to efficiently characterize these communities. For any given circumstance (e.g., the body
of an organism, the soil supporting a specific crop, or the water sustaining temperate fisheries), we must be able to determine the composition of such communities,
how they function under conditions that promote the health of the system, and the
effects of imbalances in these communities when they are perturbed. The patterns
that emerge from these studies can be used to develop predictive models, so that we
might recognize problems early and intervene before the situation is irreversible. Integrating microbiology into healthcare, agriculture, energy production, and eco­system
management will be critical to the future of all of these areas.

organism’s genome, gene expression patterns, and population variation. One
result has been the development of fields such as “polar genomics,” “agricultural genomics,” and “ecological genomics.”
The explosion of unanticipated benefits of the Human Genome Project
demonstrates how biology can benefit from large-scale interdisciplinary efforts.
Another lesson from the Human Genome Project is that even scientific efforts
that appear incremental can spawn transformative advances. Similar efforts to
allow systematic characterizations at other levels of biological complexity, like
the cell, organism, and community, could have similarly dramatic downstream
payoffs.
New Tools And Emerging New Sciences
Are Expanding What Is Possible
Recent technological advances in a number of fields outside biology make
possible unprecedented quantitative analyses of biological systems. These fields
are diverse, including physics, electronics, chemistry, nanotechnology, computer
science, and information technology. In most instances, tools and methods
developed for specific applications in their respective fields have been adapted
for use in probing biological systems. But in many cases the complexity of
biological systems presents new challenges that call for creative solutions and
additional innovation. The descriptions that follow are not meant to be exhaustive or prescriptive. They are examples of the kinds of technologies and sciences
that would have major impacts in many areas of biological inquiry.
Foundational Technologies
Information Technologies
Advances in information technology (IT), particularly during the last two
decades, have dramatically affected our private lives and all aspects of society.
The steady increase in computer power, accompanied by a sharp decrease in
cost, has been particularly remarkable. Calculations that would take weeks only
10 years ago and required access to large mainframe computers can now be
executed in minutes on a laptop.
The advent of optical fibers with bandwidth of up to 40 Gb/sec (100 Gb/sec
predicted for 2010) has enabled increasingly large volumes of data to be seamlessly transferred over the network. The interactive and dynamic manipulation
and visualization of complex images has become commonplace, with many
ubiquitous applications, most notably in computer games.
It must be realized that implementation of these advances required not
only the availability of specialized hardware but very importantly, the development of sophisticated software (e.g. the operating systems and their user

friendly interfaces, the algorithms capable of carrying out the computations
efficiently, the software protocol for ensuring error-free data transmission, and
the standards for data exchange and communication between computers and
other devices).
The impact of these developments has been particularly far-reaching for
the life sciences, because it has come at the very moment in time when the
life sciences are undergoing a historical transition, from a low-throughput
descriptive experimental discipline to a high-throughput increasingly quantitative science.
More than ever before, the life sciences are about collecting, archiving,
and analyzing information on living organisms and their myriad components,
and this effort is distributed across the globe. Worldwide genome sequencing
efforts, including the recent efforts to sequence the genome of 1000 individuals, are generating terabytes of sequence data (1TB [terabyte] = 1 trillion
bytes) that need to be processed, stored, and analyzed. While information on
genome sequences is relatively straightforward to represent because of its onedimensional nature, it is much more difficult to represent information on the
biological function of genes and proteins and their organization into dynamic
cellular processes.
Nevertheless, much of the output of life sciences researchers is now captured in electronic form, and databases now include far more than just DNA
sequence data. Biological imaging and scanning are producing vast amounts
of data about biomolecules, cells, organs, organisms, and environments that
is difficult to index and interpret because of its three-dimensional pictorial or
even four-dimensional dynamic nature. It is often necessary to preserve such
data in its raw form because of uncertainty about how it will eventually be summarized and codified for downstream analyses by diverse users. The sheer size
of some of these files suggests that some decisions will be required about what
must be saved or made easily accessible. Applications in commerce, Internet
search, and data acquisition in the sciences have spurred advances in database
systems to handle large data volumes and provide versatile tools for facilitating
user interaction, data management, and visualization. Nonetheless, the volume,
complexity and diversity of biological data, and the lack of proper conceptual
frameworks for representing and analyzing it, will continue to push the limits
of data modeling methods and database technology.
In vivo and Real Time Imaging of Cells, Organisms, and Ecosystems
The technologies of in vivo and real-time imaging include a related set of
such methods as fluorescence, total internal reflection fluorescence, near-field
and confocal microscopy, and functional magnetic resonance imaging, and their
related technologies, such as the manipulation of fluorescent proteins, fluorescent dyes, and MRI contrast reagents at the cellular and organismal level.

A NEW BIOLOGY FOR THE 21ST CENTURY

Cells are densely packed with thousands of interacting components that
must be produced, transported, assembled into complexes, and recycled all at
the appropriate time and place. Whereas proteomics techniques such as those
discussed below aim to provide large-scale systematic characterization of the
components of cells or other biological samples, current technology does not
allow observation of the spatial and temporal organization of these entities
while they are at work in cells. The main limitations to reaching a systems level
understanding of living cells is the lack of experimental tools that can analyze
the cell’s complicated internal complexes as they are forming, working, and
disassembling. Several of the experimental tools described below are starting
to fill this void; significant progress in this area would be valuable across the
life sciences.
Recent advances in imaging techniques, such as cryogenic electron tomography (Cryo-ET), offer the capability of charting cellular landscapes at previously unattainable resolutions of less than 10Å, with predictions to attain near
atomic resolution in specific cases (Leis et al., 2009). To date Cryo-ET analyses
have been mostly restricted to isolated macromolecular assemblies, small bacterial cells, or thin regions of more complex cells, due to the limited penetration
depth of electrons. However, recently developed cryo-sectioning techniques
make it possible to transcend these limitations and acquire detailed views of
many kinds of cells and tissues. The interpretation of these views relies on help
from various techniques for labeling protein constituents (immunolabelling,
or use of fluorescent tags), and is a fast evolving area. These techniques can
be complemented by information from the rapidly expanding repertoire of
known 3D structures of individual proteins, as atomic models of these proteins
can be used to expand the lower resolution images obtained by the Cryo-ET
technique. This combination of techniques provides unprecedented insight into
the molecular organization of cellular landscapes.
Similarly, the technology to characterize the location and activity of individual cells within a living organism is also improving. Substantial progress has
been made over the last two decades in extending the application of fluorescent
semiconductor nanocrystals (also known as quantum dots or qdots) from electronic materials science to biological systems (Gao et al., 2004). Examples of
their recent use in the analysis of biological systems include monitoring the diffusion of individual receptor proteins (e.g., glycine receptors) in living neurons
and the identification of lymph nodes in live animals by near-infrared emission
during surgery. Multifunctional nanoparticle probes based on semiconductor
quantum dots (qdots) have recently been developed for cancer targeting and
imaging in living animals. The applications include in vivo targeting studies of
human prostate cancer growing in mice and sensitive and multicolor fluorescence imaging of cancer cells under in vivo conditions (Box 3.7). In addition,
microfluidic and microfabrication approaches are generating the ability to
monitor cells and their components at unprecedented levels of resolution.

central problem areas that have been identified, including crop productivity (in
analysis of plant cells and growth of tissues) and sustainable crop production,
ecological monitoring by ecosystem visualization, and better understanding of
human health through advances in medical imaging. To the degree that plant
growth is central to biofuel production, these technology platforms are also of
importance in this area.
Satellite remote sensing of the earth’s surface, beginning in the early 1970s,
has dramatically influenced understanding of the distribution of life processes
on the planet, as well as pointing critical attention to the rapid human-induced
changes at global scales. Broad-spectral reflectance optical sensors, such as the

series of Landsat satellites, have been used to measure rates of deforestation,
and these and similar sensors are now used routinely to measure these rates
over tropical South America. NASA has developed global data sets for the
1980s, 1990s, 2000, and 2005 that cover essentially the entire terrestrial surface
in six visible and near-infrared spectral bands at approximately 30 m spatial
resolution. This is a powerful time series of the actual change in land-cover and
vegetation for the earth’s surface, and has already proven useful not only for
understanding amounts and rates of deforestation and habitat change, but also
for assessing agricultural extent and productivity.
These medium resolution data have been substantially augmented by higher
temporal resolution sampling of a broader range of spectral reflectances from
sensors such as MODIS on NASA’s TERRA and AQUA platforms. MODIS
provides twice daily sampling of a wider range of more precise spectral bands,
and enables the analysis of long (now nearly a decade) time series of net primary productivity, vegetation distribution, seasonality, surface temperatures,
and along with other optical sensors, ocean biological productivity through the
measurement of ocean color (i.e., observations of the chlorophyll concentrations of the surface ocean).
Through experimental missions, aircraft missions, and some space observations, remote measurements can increasingly be used to derive specific process-based information, or to retrieve critical parameters directly. Examples
include the use of hyperspectral information to detect canopy nitrogen and
lignin content, and therefore estimate photosynthetic potential and distinguish
individual species distributions, the use of synthetic aperture radar to estimate
the distribution of above-ground biomass, and the use of lidars to measure the
height distribution of vegetation canopies and thus estimate the vertical distribution of woody biomass, in addition to its total mass.
Earth Science and Applications from Space (National Research Council,
2007b) has identified 17 missions, many of which have specific biological goals
related to understanding the interaction of ecosystems, the physical climate
system, and human disturbances. These represent the scientific community’s
best summary to date of the fundamental advances that are believed possible,
and that would transform understanding of how ecosystems function now, and
how they are expected to function in the future.
High-Throughput Technologies
Recent advances in DNA sequencing technologies have been tremendous.
Using current next-generation technology, the Joint Genome Institute, headed
by the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory and Lawrence Livermore
National Laboratory, sequenced over 20 billion nucleotides in the month of
October 2008 (DOE Joint Genome Institute, 2009). The ability to sequence
individual genomes, or relevant portions of genomes, will have a major impact

on the ability to develop and deliver personalized medicines, to speed plant
breeding, and to monitor environmental conditions. Already, sequencing costs
are so low that they do not represent a barrier to experiments that would have
been unthinkable even five years ago. Box 3.8 describes one new sequencing
approach made possible by advances in nanotechnology.
Proteins play key roles in virtually all cellular processes. Measuring their
expression levels and the chemical modifications that they undergo as a result
of changing cellular environments and developmental and disease states has
become one of the major goals of present-day biology and medicine. Also,
proteins rarely act alone. They interact with one another, often forming large
edifices that act as complex molecular machines. The systematic characterization of these interactions is required in order to elucidate the functional interdependencies among proteins.
Technological advances over the past 10 years have made it possible to
carry out these various analyses on very large scales, giving rise to the field of
proteomics, or the study of all of the proteins in a particular biological sample
(for example, a single cell or a drop of saliva). Progress in molecular biology
techniques and purification methods, coupled with mass spectrometry (MS)
techniques, have played a major role in these advances, with MS increasingly
becoming the method of choice for the analysis of complex protein samples.

BOX 3.8
Nanotechnology and Sequencing
There are many competing technologies being developed for DNA sequencing
(Shendure & Ji, 2008). One of them provides an illustrative example of the interface
between biology and nanotechnology, referred to as single-molecule, real-time DNA
sequencing. This method utilizes DNA polymerase, an enzyme that synthesizes DNA,
and fluorescent nucleotides (different labels for each of the four nucleotides). Because
DNA polymerase incorporates complementary nucleotides, monitoring the fluorescent
signal of the added nucleotide during synthesis allows one to determine the DNA
sequence of the original DNA. A critical component of the method is the use of a zeromode waveguide (ZMW), a nanofabricated hole that only allows light to penetrate a
tiny distance, so that the fluorescence of a single molecule can be detected despite
the presence of high concentrations of fluorescent molecules in the remainder of the
sample. A single molecule of DNA polymerase is immobilized at the bottom of a ZMW,
which is illuminated from below with a laser light. As each incoming fluorescently
labeled nucleotide binds to the DNA polymerase, the signal is detected using singlemolecule spectroscopy. The faster, cheaper sequencing that may result from this
approach (again, only one of many being pursued) emphasizes the potential impact
of collaborations that cross traditional disciplines (here, molecular biology, chemistry,
applied physics, and nanoengineering) in the life sciences (Eid
�������������������
et al., 2009).

Of the different MS-based techniques for protein profiling, the most sensitive ones are currently able to detect protein expressed at levels of only a few
hundred copies per cell. MS-based methods for detecting protein interaction
partners and protein complexes have been successful in identifying thousands
of protein interactions and hundreds of multi-protein complexes in simple
organisms such as yeast and bacteria, and are now being extended to higher
organisms such as the mouse and human.
Silicon microelectronics has made computation ever faster, cheaper, more
accessible, and more powerful. Microfluidic chips, feats of minuscule plumbing
where more than a hundred cell cultures or other experiments can reside in a
rubbery silicone integrated circuit the size of a quarter, could bring a similar
revolution of automation to biological and medical research. Using techniques
drawn from engineering, chemistry, and physics, highly miniaturized sensors
and analysis devices can be generated that measure real-time parameters at the
level of individual cells or even subcellular compartments, allowing the study
and manipulation of processes at relevant functional levels.
The expense, inefficiency, and high maintenance and space requirements
of robotic automation systems present barriers to performing experiments. By
contrast, microfluidic chips are inexpensive and require little maintenance or
space. They also need very small amounts of samples and chemical inputs to
make experiments work, making them more efficient and potentially cheaper
to use. These chips are made using optical lithography to etch the circuit pattern into silicon. The etched silicon acts as a mold. Silicone is poured into the
mold and then removed. By stacking several layers of molded silicone and then
encasing them in glass, researchers can create an integrated circuit of channels,
valves and chambers for chemicals and cells—like a rubbery labyrinth.
Cell culture chips with up to 100 chambers have been designed to hold
individual cells and all the microscopic plumbing necessary to add any combination of different chemical inputs to those chambers. Such chips can be
used to test how different inputs might cause stem cells to transform into more
specific cells needed for particular treatments. They could also be used to test
how different combinations of antibiotics affect a particular bacterium. Other
chips can be designed for the preparation of valuable and expensive purified
proteins for structural analysis by X-ray diffraction. The tedious trial-and-error
process of preparing crystals of macromolecules may be greatly accelerated
using microfluidic chips. A recent report describes a new type of microfluidic
chip enabling the detailed analysis of up to a dozen different protein indicators of diseases from a single drop of blood in less than 10 minutes (Chen
et al., 2008). Such chips would significantly lower the cost of clinical lab
tests that measure the presence and relative abundance of specific proteins,
thereby enabling early detection of diseases such as cancer. Microfluidic-based
­“sippers” that allow monitoring of cell contents in living systems, devices that
allow sequencing of the genome from a single cell, and multiplexed systems

that monitor ­parameters in high throughput are all pushing the boundaries of
our understanding of the dynamics and complexity of living systems (Box 3.9).
These monitoring approaches are also beginning to impact ecological sciences,
with real-time 24/7 monitoring of habitat function within reach. In addition,
the ability to monitor health parameters from a wristwatch, eyeglass, or even
contact lenses is under development for real-time health monitoring and reporting that can occur anywhere.

BOX 3.9
The Chemistrode
The chemistrode is a new microfluidic device created by Rustem Ismagilov and
colleagues at the University of Chicago that “sips” from a living cell in a way analogous
to that in which a microelectrode measures electrical signals. Using a V-shaped tube
with an opening at the point of the V, small amounts of cell contents are delivered to
aqueous droplets separated by a hydrophobic carrier, which are then passed through
a splitter to create replicate arrays of the contents for downstream analysis. This
system has the potential to stimulate, record, and analyze molecular signals in cells
(Chen et al., 2008).

A NEW BIOLOGY FOR THE 21ST CENTURY

Major areas that still require development are nanoscale electrochemical
sensors to enable multiplexing with optical sensors, extension of existing sensor
technology to broad ranges of analytes, creation of novel platforms for facile
deployment, and an increase in the reliability and reproducibility to allow a
range of biologically meaningful measurements. The coupling of microfluidics
with microfabricated parts will also broaden applicability, and the addition
of remote transmission of data will extend the use of these devices outside of
the laboratory. In the future, imbedded and largely invisible systems for measurement, analysis, and reporting will become commonplace and will change
our lives tomorrow, in much the same way that miniaturized communications
technology has changed our world today.
Engineered Biological Systems
Understanding and manipulation of biological systems depends crucially
on being able to grow them reproducibly in the laboratory and, for some applications, to scale that ability to commercial production scales. ­ Technological
breakthroughs in materials and devices are making it easier to maintain biological entities in an environment that maximizes their production of a particular
product or allows their experimental observation and manipulation. Generally
these systems are designed to grow cells of a particular type, microbial, plant, or
animal, but systems to maintain communities of microbes or support the growth
of tissues and organs are the next wave of engineered biological systems.
This capability was developed first for microbial cells in the 1970s and
next for animal cells in the 1980s, via in vitro cell culture bioreactors aimed
predominantly toward production of therapeutic proteins and non-medical
biomolecules such as polymers and specialty chemicals. These reactors included
process control systems that could not only track environmental conditions,
but also modulate the bioreactors to keep conditions in a desired state. For the
most part, however, these bioreactors were limited to cell types that would be
productive when growing in fluid suspensions, attached to particle surfaces, or
immobilized within membranes.
If tissues and organs from multi-cellular organisms like animals and plants
are to be studied in culture, the conditions under which they normally grow must
be reproduced––tissues have internal and external surfaces, they often respond
to signals from an extracellular matrix, and depend on the continuous delivery
of nutrients and removal of waste. Efforts to create effective environments along
these lines have accelerated since the early 1990s, in a field generally called ­“tissue
engineering.” Tissue engineers develop materials, scaffolds, or devices that provide biochemical and biophysical cues to facilitate cell survival, proliferation, differentiation, and organization into functional three-dimensional tissues. The field
of tissue engineering promises to provide more effective experimental systems for
studying complex human tissue physiology and pathophysiology in vitro. This

WHY NOW?

capability is highly desirable because animal models fail to capture many crucial
facets of human physiology, notably in the areas of tissue-specific transcriptional regulation, drug-induced liver toxicity, pathogenic infection, host immune
responses, and cancer. Engineered tissues built with human cells are thus being
developed for a range of application areas, including hepatic drug metabolism
and toxicity, mammary gland morphogenesis and oncogenesis, lymphoid tissue
neogenesis, and stem cell differentiation, and offer promise for scaling to the data
collection demands of high-throughput screening and systems biology.
Foundational Sciences
Systems Biology
A crucial requisite for basic science understanding and technology design
is a capability for predicting how the entity under consideration will behave
under conditions not yet examined. In the New Biology, pursuing and applying this capability to the greatest extent feasible must be a high priority in
order to accomplish the kinds of objectives laid out elsewhere in this report. In
particular, maximal impact of the molecular and genomic biology revolutions
in late-20th century life science will arise from endeavoring to build predictive
models of physiological behaviors, in terms of underlying molecular component properties. The lesson from physical and chemical sciences over the past
century is that a combination of quantitative multivariate measurement with
computational analysis is typically essential for predictive models, and the
challenge for life science is that for the foreseeable future it will still have an
incomplete knowledge of all of the components and interactions that make up
biological systems.
Improved measurement technologies and mathematical and computational
tools have led to the emergence of a new approach to biological questions,
termed “systems biology,” which strives to achieve predictive modeling. Systems
biology seeks a deep quantitative understanding of complex biological processes through dynamic interaction of components that may include multiple
molecular, cellular, organismal, population, community, and ecosystem functions. It builds on foundational large-scale cataloguing efforts (e.g., ­genomics,
proteomics, metabolomics, etc.) that specify the “parts list” needed for constructing models. The models relate the properties of parts to the dynamic
operation of the systems they participate in. The systems approach was applied
early on to ecosystem processes (Hagen, 1992), a legacy that has resulted in the
development of complex simulation models capable of evaluating interactions
among plant communities, ecosystem processes, and atmospheric dynamics.
More recently, systems biology has expanded to molecular components
involved in intrinsic cellular processes including gene expression, metabolism,
structure and force generation, and regulatory signal transduction. These new

62

A NEW BIOLOGY FOR THE 21ST CENTURY

advances in systems biology at the cellular level now make it feasible to analyze
large data sets of molecular level data that then may be related to phenotypic
functions at cellular and higher levels via appropriate kinds of computational
methods. A broad range of computational modeling approaches for studying
cell signaling and its physiological consequences is needed in the arsenal of
systems biology. Fortunately, a wide spectrum of algorithmic methods relevant
to systems biology modeling is available from mathematical and computational
science, as well as the physical sciences. These tools include Bayesian networks,
Boolean and fuzzy logic, inverse modeling, and data assimilation, among others.
It clearly can be anticipated that development and application of novel mathematical and computational approaches will be motivated by the difficult problems continuing to arise in systems biology due to issues such as incomplete
information concerning system components and properties, heterogeneity and
stochasticity, convolution of biochemical and biophysical processes, and the
multiple length- and time-scales inherent in attempting to establish predictive
models at all levels of biological organization, from the molecular, through the
organism, population, ecosystem, and finally, the global scales.
Computational Biology
Biology and mathematics have long been intertwined. The dynamic interplay of hosts and parasites, molecular forces in proteins, biological pattern
formation, and signal transmission along axons has been studied using tools
of mathematical analysis such as non-linear dynamics and partial differential
equations. Fluid dynamics and differential geometry have been applied to heart
physiology, group theory to x-ray crystallography, and topological knot theory
to the coiling of DNA. From its very origin it was recognized that the study
of genetic processes requires probability and statistics. In all these instances
the data requirements of the mathematical models were relatively modest, and
the daily work of most experimental biologists was relatively unaffected by the
results of these studies.
The picture changed completely with the advent of genome sequencing,
functional genomics, and systems biology. Biology became an informationbased field in which large shared databases are an indispensable tool. The
mathematical underpinnings of the field expanded to embrace probabilistic
and combinatorial methods. Combinatorial algorithms are essential for solving
the puzzles of genome assembly, sequence alignment, and phylogeny construction based on molecular data. Probabilistic models such as Hidden Markov
models and Bayesian networks are now applied to gene finding and comparative genomics. Algorithms from statistics and machine learning are applied to
genome-wide association studies and to problems of classification, clustering
and feature selection arising in the analysis of large-scale gene expression data.
The rate of innovation in these statistical disciplines is rapid as new problems

WHY NOW?

of increasing complexity arise in the analysis of models based on heterogeneous
data sources. Close collaboration between biologists and mathematicians is
increasingly fruitful for both fields by providing new approaches to biological
questions and also driving innovation in mathematics.
Synthetic Biology
Another foundational science that reflects the growing role of engineering
in biology is synthetic biology. The ability not only to understand, but also to
modify and construct biological systems will be essential if we are to apply the
power of biology to diverse environmental, energy, and health problems. Synthetic biology aims to use biological modules as the components with which to
engineer new biological systems. By standardizing biological parts and the way
in which classes of parts can be functionally linked together, this field aims to
make large-scale genetic engineering easier and more predictable, potentially
leading to cells, organisms, or biologically inspired systems with highly optimized industrial or therapeutic applications.
Synthetic biology is also proving to be an effective teacher as a way to
learn more about the fundamental logic of biological systems. Traditionally,
natural biological systems have been studied by observation and by dissection
(reverse engineering). These approaches alone, however, are often insufficient
to uncover the core design principles of a system It can be difficult to identify
which components and parameters are most important, especially when dealing
with natural systems that have arisen through idiosyncratic evolutionary paths.
The ability to build and modify a biological system provides tools to directly
probe and interrogate the system. One can modify individual parameters in a
controlled and combinatorial fashion to understand which ones are functionally most important and under what circumstances. One can identify minimal
or alternative systems that can achieve a particular function, thereby more
clearly outlining core design principles. Success in forward engineering is the
ultimate test of predictable understanding; failure can be our most constructive
teacher. These approaches are already bearing fruit and may ultimately generate the next great conceptual advance: a general understanding of how nature
constructs robust and precise systems from noisy and imperfect parts (as well
as why these systems fail under certain circumstances).
Conclusion
All of these factors—increasing integration within the life sciences and
between the life sciences and other disciplines, a deep pool of detailed knowledge of biological components and processes, previous investment in the generation of shared data resources, stunning technological innovations, and crosscutting sciences that are foundational across many applications—have put the

life sciences unmistakably on course to a major acceleration of discovery and
innovation. It is a matter of great and justified excitement that a sharp upturn
in the curve of conceptual progress is coming into view.
But realizing this potential will require a crucial transition within the life
sciences. It will require significant investment and will no doubt cause some
disruption of engrained educational, institutional, and even intellectual habits.
The question must be asked whether the life sciences are ready to capitalize
on this potential. Perhaps it would be preferable to continue to focus on current approaches until further progress makes success more likely. What is the
urgency, or the claimed opportunity, to move forward now?
One response appeals to America’s competitive spirit. The United States
was a leader in the development of the life sciences throughout the 20th century
and would benefit greatly by remaining in that position in the 21st century.
Especially in economically challenging times, the drive to stay at the forefront
of critical areas of research can motivate needed investments and changes.
The time to move forward is now.

Putting the New Biology to Work

The New Biology approach has the potential to meet critical societal goals
in food, the environment, energy, and health, but taking a “business-as-usual”
approach to supporting the emerging field will delay achieving its full potential.
Success depends on new kinds of investments to enable and drive new, broadly
integrated approaches.
Setting Big Goals:
Letting the Problems Drive the Science
Responses to great challenges often must be enunciated, formulated, and
launched before the capabilities to meet those challenges are in place. In this
way, the response often motivates the creation of the necessary capabilities. The
decisions to send humans to the moon and to sequence the human genome
were both made when the relevant technologies were far from being up to the
job. In each case, establishing a bold and specific target created unforeseen
routes to solutions.
Recent technological and scientific advances have brought the life sciences
to a point where rapid progress toward understanding complex biological
systems is possible. Many of the essential ingredients are already in place.
The New Biology is already emerging, but the interdisciplinary, system-level,
computationally intensive projects it encompasses fit uneasily within traditional
funding opportunities and institutional structures. A piecemeal strategy, with
many different agencies funding interdisciplinary projects and investing in
various technologies would continue to advance the efforts of some pioneer
researchers whose work has enormous promise. But the cross-cutting technologies and tools that would genuinely empower the New Biology will require
significant investment and advance planning. Currently, no mechanism exists

for the extremely diverse community of current and future New ­Biologists to
identify, prioritize, and advocate for the investments that would have the biggest impact on the most sectors.
An alternative approach is to set an ambitious goal and invest in the
research and technology development needed to meet it. This approach
has led to some of America’s most spectacular scientific achievements. The
committee believes that the best way to capitalize on the unique opportunity
presented by emerging capabilities in the life sciences is to undertake a bold
national program to apply the New Biology to the solution of major societal
problems.
The call for a large commitment to applying the New Biology to big goals
is not meant to imply that such a program would consist only of “big science”
collaborative projects. The enunciation of big goals is important because it
invites the participation of both collaborative groups and individuals from a
broad spectrum of disciplines. Solutions to large-scale problems demand contributions from investigators operating both individually and together. Given
the need to stimulate both conceptual and technological advances to fulfill the
promise of the New Biology, a mixture of both individual and large-scale projects will be necessary. The Institute of Medicine and National Research Council addressed this question in the 2003 report Large-Scale Biomedical ­ Science
(National Research Council, 2003c). That report states that “the objective of a
large-scale project should be to produce a public good—an end project that is
valuable for society and is useful to many or all investigators in the field.” The
report goes on to point out that “large-scale collaborative projects may also
complement smaller projects by achieving an important, complex goal that
could not be accomplished through the traditional model of single-investigator,
small-scale research.” The report lists several criteria that characterize ­projects
that are best carried out on a large scale, including external coordination
and management, a required budget larger than can be met under traditional
funding mechanisms, a time frame longer than that of smaller projects, and
strategic planning with intermediate goals and endpoints as well as a phase-out
strategy.
The committee chose to focus on four areas of societal need because the
benefits of achieving these goals would be large, progress would be assessable,
and both the scientific community and the public would find such goals inspirational. Each challenge will require technological and conceptual advances
that are not now at hand, across a disciplinary spectrum that is not now encompassed by the field. Achieving these goals will demand, in each case, transformative advances. It can be argued, however, that other challenges could serve
the same purpose. Large-scale efforts to understand how the first cell came to
be, how the human brain works, or how living organisms affect the cycling of
carbon in the ocean could also drive the development of the New Biology and
of the technologies and sciences necessary to advance the entire field. In the

committee’s view, one of the most exciting aspects of the New Biology Initiative
is that success in achieving the four goals chosen here as examples will propel
advances in fundamental understanding throughout the life sciences. Because
biological systems have so many fundamental similarities, the same technologies and sciences developed to address these four challenges will expand the
capabilities of all biologists.
The committee suggests that a New Biology approach to the areas of food,
the environment, energy, and health will require support for work at different
scales, and from basic science to industrial application. As described in chapter 2, the New Biology has the potential to make significant contributions to
addressing problems in each of these areas. In each area, the committee has
suggested a challenge that is beyond the scope of any one scientific community
or federal agency: for food, to generate food plants to adapt and grow sustainably in changing environments; for the environment, to understand and sustain
ecosystem function and biodiversity in the face of rapid change; for energy,
to expand sustainable alternatives to fossil fuels; and for health, to achieve
individualized surveillance and care. The committee’s descriptions are meant
to be evocative, not prescriptive. The first, and critical, step in designing New
Biology programs in these four areas would be to bring to the table all of the
stakeholders who could contribute, including scientists and engineers from
many different communities, representatives of the relevant federal agencies,
and private sector participants from both the commercial and non-profit sector.
This step alone––bringing together the diverse talent and resources that already
exist and giving them a mandate to plan a long-term, coordinated strategy for
solving concrete problems––will already provide significant momentum to the
emergence of the New Biology.
The committee does not provide a detailed plan for implementation of
such a national initiative, which would depend strongly on where administrative
responsibility for the initiative is placed. Should the concept of an initiative be
adopted, the next step would be careful development of strategic visions for
the programs and a tactical plan with goals. It would be necessary to identify
imaginative leaders, carefully map the route from ‘grand visions’ to specific
programs, and develop ambitious, but measurable milestones, ensuring that
each step involves activities that result in new knowledge and facilitates the
smooth integration of cooperative interdisciplinary research into the traditional
research culture.
Implementation of a national New Biology Initiative project does not
require creation of a new agency; coordination of the resources already existing
in the academic, public, and private sectors is the goal. Estimating the cost of
such an Initiative is beyond the scope of this committee, but for the purpose
of providing a relative scale, the Interagency Working Group overseeing the
National Plant Genome Initiative estimated that the program would require
$1.3 billion to fund its programs from 2003 to 2008 ($260 million/year)(NSTC,

2003). The Common Fund, which funds the NIH Roadmap for Biomedical
Research, had a budget of $480 million in 2008. Each of these programs has a
more limited scope than any of the four proposed New Biology Initiative programs in food, energy, environment and health, so the cost will be too large to
be extracted from current research budgets. Whatever the budget, the timeline
for such an Initiative must be long enough to justify investing in projects and
technologies that will take time to bear fruit—at least ten years. As President
Obama said in his address to the annual meeting of the National Academy of
Sciences on April 28, 2009:
As Vannevar Bush, who served as scientific advisor to President Franklin Roosevelt,
famously said: “Basic scientific research is scientific capital.” An investigation . . . might
not pay off for a year, or a decade, or at all. And when it does, the rewards are . . .
­enjoyed by those who bore its costs, but also by those who did not. That’s why the
private sector under-invests in basic science—and why the public sector must invest in
this kind of research (The White House, 2009).

Cross-Cutting Technologies and
Foundational Life Sciences
A quantum jump in the level at which we understand biological systems
will be required to solve these grand challenges. Although there are increasing
efforts to apply quantitative approaches to biological questions, more must be
done to transform biology from its origins as a descriptive science to a predictive science. We will ultimately be limited in our ability to deploy biological
systems to solve large-scale problems unless we significantly deepen our fundamental understanding of the organizational principles of complex biological
systems, a staggeringly difficult challenge. The growth of the New Biology
will be dramatically accelerated by developing frameworks for systematically
analyzing, predicting, and modulating the behavior of complex biological systems. Only with powerful tools to interface with biological systems, accessible
to diverse researchers, will it be possible to effectively generate biology-based
solutions to the diverse problem areas described in chapter 2.
Many of the foundational technologies and sciences identified as central
to New Biology contribute to meeting all four of the critical societal goals.
The case for informational technologies is obvious; they will provide the
means of disseminating discoveries whether they arise out of research focused
on energy, food, environment, or health. Perhaps less obvious is systems
biology. Discovering the general principles of dynamic control of the flow
of energy, chemicals, and organisms through units spanning from cells to
ecosystems is critical for all four societal challenges. The advances in systems
biological research will come from insights of computational and physical
scientists and engineers as well as cell and molecular biologists. For example,
to model the flow of information from the surface of a cell when a hormone

stimulates a receptor, to the activation of a set of genes, and, ultimately, cell
division requires biologists to establish the experimental system, engineers
to measure the time course of changes in thousands of molecules, computational scientists to analyze the data, and all three to integrate the results into
a cohesive, testable model. The tools and concepts for each of these steps also
have to be created.
The technologies and sciences are highly interconnected. Progress in any of
them will support and advance all the others, leading to faster progress in meeting all four goals. Take, for example, the role of synthetic biology in improving
pharmaceuticals. Synthetic biologists have already transferred into bacteria
all of the necessary molecular machinery to synthesize artemisinin (Martin et
al., 2003). This potent anti-malaria compound is naturally produced in small
amounts in the leaves of the wormwood tree. Through synthetic biology, the
compound can be produced in greater quantity and at lower cost. Clearly
synthetic biology has great promise in the area of improving therapeutics and
thereby human health. But synthetic biology also has the potential to engineer
bacteria that produce high-energy biofuels, thus contributing to the energy
challenge; bacterial communities that digest pollutants, thus cleaning the environment; or even sentinel plants that signal the presence of invasive species or
crop pests. The field of synthetic biology, however, does not exist in a vacuum;
to reach its greatest potential it will require imaging technology to watch individual proteins at work in cells, high throughput technology to measure the
output of individual bacteria, engineered biological systems to support high
yields of desired products, and information technologies to analyze and model
complex metabolic networks.
The foundational sciences and technologies described here are by no means
a complete list. In fact, the emergence of new technologies and fields of science
as a result of the interdisciplinary collaborations in New Biology is another
likely benefit of a major interagency initiative. What is clear is that there are
certain technologies and sciences that are of cross-cutting importance and will
support communities of researchers whether they are working on food, the
environment, energy, or health. Therefore, an interagency initiative will benefit
from a mechanism for planning investments in these and other cross-cutting
areas. These investments will drive progress in all four problem areas. But
advances in these foundational sciences and technologies will not only advance
the work of the communities working directly on the New Biology Initiative.
The lesson of the Human Genome Project is that these advances will spread
into the wider scientific community, multiplying the value and increasing the
productivity of researchers throughout the life sciences community. Investment
in cross-cutting technologies will make it likely that the United States will be
the leader in the resulting new industries with all the attendant economic and
job creation benefits.

A NEW BIOLOGY FOR THE 21ST CENTURY

Necessity for Interagency Collaboration
Biology-based solutions to major societal problems will not come exclusively from any one area of research. Many federal agencies already support
researchers who are pioneers in the development of the New Biology and invest
in the cross-cutting technologies and sciences discussed above. But current
institutional and disciplinary fragmentation has two consequences. First, traditionally separate research communities often are not aware of the significance
of––and therefore do not quickly capitalize upon––advances made in other
communities, and second, the multiplying value of investments in cross-­cutting
technologies and foundational sciences that would benefit all the different
kinds of biological research is not readily recognized. Fragmentation within
and across institutional structures poses a significant barrier to realizing the full
potential of the New Biology. Interagency collaboration will be critical for accelerating the emergence of the New Biology. Through collaboration, the unique
strengths of each agency­­––for example, in technology development, shared
facility management, basic and applied research support, or grant review and
administration––can be combined to the benefit of all and needless redundancy
can be minimized. Most importantly, synergies and entirely new approaches will
emerge that would otherwise never have been realized.
Interdisciplinary programs either within or across agencies do exist and
some can provide valuable insight into what makes such programs succeed.
For example, the Ecology of Infectious Diseases (EID) initiative began in 1999
as a joint program of the National Science Foundation (NSF) and the Fogarty
International Center (FIC) of the National Institutes of Health (NIH). The
jointly administered program solicits competitive research grants for research
on relationships between environmental change and the spread of infectious
agents. A 2005 review (Burke et al., 2005) concluded that the program “successfully bridged disparate scientific disciplines and institutional cultures to
develop new approaches to critical environmental and health challenges. It
has also played an important role in building a cadre of interdisciplinary scientists” and that “the first five years of the EID program have been successful
and productive. A total of 34 projects have been funded, and all of them have
been both interdisciplinary and appropriately targeted.” The review went on
to note that—
The EID program mission overlaps with the missions of several of the NIH Institutes
and NSF Directorates. As one of the few joint NIH-NSF programs, the EID program
is also a valuable example of effective interagency cooperation. It is to the credit of the
program officers and the original partner agencies that the need was recognized and the
gap was effectively bridged. It is hoped that the lessons learned from the EID program
can help encourage and inform future intra-agency and interagency cooperation.

The report points out management issues that arose from the interagency
nature of the program, and made several recommendations that will be even

more critical for enabling the larger scale interagency cooperation needed to
implement the New Biology. For example, the report recommended that proposal application and reporting processes be streamlined into a single process
and that data and sample sharing be promoted. Because of the many lessons
learned in implementing this inherently interdisciplinary program, the review
suggested that the EID program continue to evolve as a model for interagency
cooperation and to strive to include other institutes at NIH and other divisions
of NSF.
Another successful interagency program is the National Plant Genome
Initiative (NPGI), established in 1998. The NPGI is overseen by the Interagency Working Group (IWG) on Plant Genomes, which includes representatives from NSF, NIH, the Department of Agriculture (USDA), Department
of Energy (DOE), Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP), Office
of Management and Budget (OMB), and, since 2003, the Agency for International Development (USAID). The IWG coordinates all plant genome research
activities supported by the participating agencies. In 2008 the NRC issued the
report Achievements of the National Plant Genome Initiative and New Horizons in Plant Biology (National Research Council, 2008), which evaluated the
first five years of the NPGI and made recommendations for the next five-year
effort. The report concluded that “NPGI has been very successful by all measures applied in this study” and that “plant genome scientists, as a community,
have . . . elucidate[d] basic biological principles that are likely to be broadly
operative across plant biology and can thus facilitate rapid applications to crop
genomics and improvement.” The report also noted that “basic research funded
by NPGI to date has served as the springboard for several applied, agencyspecific, ­ mission-oriented programs” and that “NPGI principal investigators
also reported diverse and substantive translational activities . . . rang[ing] from
starting their own companies on the basis of research results to patent filings
and licensing arrangements with a variety of plant biotechnology entities.”
The NIH Roadmap for Medical Research, which began in 2004, shares
many characteristics of an interagency program, although it is confined to
NIH. Its goal is to support research that crosses individual Institute and Center
missions and to—
address roadblocks to research . . . by overcoming specific hurdles or filling defined
knowledge gaps. Roadmap programs span all areas of health and disease research and
boundaries of NIH Institutes and Centers (ICs). These are programs that might not
otherwise be supported by the NIH ICs because of their scope or because they are
inherently risky. Roadmap Programs are expected to have exceptionally high potential
to transform the manner in which biomedical research is conducted (NIH, 2009).

The first round of funding included support for Interdisciplinary Research
consortia, Clinical and Translational Science awards, projects in nanomedicine
and structural biology, and centers for biomedical computing, and networks

A New Biology for the 21st Century

72

A NEW BIOLOGY FOR THE 21ST CENTURY

and pathways, among others. The second round of funding, in 2008, added
epigenomics and analysis of the human microbiome. No external review of
the program has taken place comparable to the NRC review of the NPGI, but
many of the projects funded in the first round of funding were given renewed
support for a second term, and internal evaluation of the effectiveness of the
programs is built into the program.
The joint effort between DOE and NIH to make synchrotron resources
available to the life sciences research community is another example of successful interagency collaboration. The DOE funds the building and operation
of the synchrotron facilities and NIH funds the building and operation of
beamlines and experimental stations specifically designed for life sciences
applications. These collaborations have been especially important for structural biology and support for life sciences research is an increasingly important
part of DOE’s portfolio. Currently “>40% of all research done at synchrotrons
is in the biomedical sciences, although synchrotrons were originally developed for high energy physics experiments” (National Center for Research
Resources, 2009).
The effort required for success in meeting the four major societal goals
is different in scale from NPGI, EID, or the NIH Roadmap: it will need to
involve more agencies, a larger investment and a long-term commitment. True
interagency collaboration will demand interagency strategic planning (including
a commitment to supporting the development of novel, integrated approaches
to education), interagency funding, and interagency evaluation and review.
Such an infrastructure for interagency collaboration will empower and enable
the joint efforts of individuals and groups who are currently insulated from
one another by bureaucratic barriers. Importantly, the need is not for a new
agency, which would merely establish another silo, or even for a reorganization
of existing agencies, but rather for mechanisms that actively permeate their
current boundaries. Successful “permeation” would bring together scientists
with different backgrounds, expertise, and goals, sparking new shared visions
and synergies that could not have been realized separately, new ways of conceiving and addressing major societal challenges, and eventually, transformational
advances (Box 4.1).
It is worth emphasizing explicitly three elements essential for achieving
these ends. First, availability of dedicated interagency funds, outside of each
agency’s individual budget needs, will motivate their involvement. Second,
interagency strategic planning will place the focus of a broad spectrum of scientists and engineers on discovering novel, shared, life sciences-based approaches
to these societal goals. Inclusion of some private sector scientists in this integrated planning effort might evolve novel public-private partnerships that could
help drive late-stage efforts. And finally, given the cross-cutting and interdisciplinary nature of the science that will be needed, establishment of a common
interagency peer-review and evaluation process will set shared standards of

BOX 4.1
How Might Interagency Programs
Catalyze the New Biology?
Most key scientific advances to date have been funded by disciplinary funding
programs. Advances in the New Biology will require programs that compel integration
across disciplines, and synthesis that allows fundamental biology to be applied to key
social challenges. One example of a funding program that stimulates such integration
of computer science, informatics, and biology is the National Science Foundation–
­supported National Center for Ecological Analysis and Synthesis (NCEAS), located
at the University of California-Santa Barbara. NCEAS provides long-term support in
ecoinformatics, with on-site expertise in mathematics and geospatial modeling, visualization, and data synthesis, and invites individuals and teams to assemble at the
center to conduct new kinds of research (NCEAS, 2009).
The United Kingdom’s Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Program
provides another approach to stimulating interdisciplinary scientific research through
“sandpits.” Sandpits are residential workshops that include 20–30 participants from
multiple disciplines, who work together to develop new research projects. By providing an opportunity for exploring possible collaborations and immediate feedback on
proposals, sandpits aim to “drive lateral thinking and radical approaches to addressing
particular research challenges” (EPSRC, 2009). These efforts are resulting in dramatic
advances. Similar efforts by interagency programs could launch the New Biology in
the United States.

excellence and drive periodic assessments of progress. A national New Biology
Initiative would provide all three of these elements.
There is every reason to expect that just as the Human Genome Project
(HGP) had an impact across the life sciences far beyond the sequence data
generated, investments in problem-focused projects and foundational technologies and sciences will have similarly profound effects. The HGP had the
advantage of a clear and definable endpoint––the complete sequence of the
human genome––and a similar endpoint for some of these interdisciplinary and
cross-cutting projects may be more difficult to define. However, the success of
the HGP justifies community-wide efforts to plan and implement strategies to
address challenges in the areas of food, the environment, energy, and health,
and to invest in those technologies whose development would most significantly
contribute to the success of those programs.
The Essentiality of Interdisciplinary Collaboration
The New Biology depends on interdisciplinary collaborations among scientists and engineers who share sufficient common language and understanding to

A NEW BIOLOGY FOR THE 21ST CENTURY

envision and embrace common goals. To expand the pool of such indi­viduals,
it will be important to educate students in new ways. Interagency funding
mechanisms could give universities incentives to create novel interdisciplinary
entities that provide the basis both for new research approaches and for new
educational strategies.
Research universities and academic medical centers have for hundreds of
years been structured around departments and colleges that circumscribe specific disciplines and intellectual approaches (National Academies, 2004). These
structures have had enormous value in encouraging discovery, establishing sufficient focus to virtually define whole fields, and imparting increasingly refined
expertise to successive generations of trainees. Indeed, it is in many ways due
to the success of these delineated departmental structures that the base of
knowledge in each field has advanced sufficiently to make each relevant and
potentially contributory to the others. Analogous to the separate government
agencies, however, traditional department structures also serve as bureaucratic
barriers that inhibit communication and productive interaction. Traditional
metrics of success are accomplishments that can be ascribed to individual
units, including grant generation, buildings, laboratory equipment acquisition,
and financial support for faculty. Faculty within these units being considered
for tenure and promotion are reviewed within the department structure, leaving them vulnerable if their focus is interdisciplinary. Certain institutions have
recognized these limitations of traditional departments for establishing the New
Biology, and have responded not by eliminating departmental structures, but
rather by supplementing or overlaying them with interdisciplinary programs or
institutes that have both research and educational objectives. Examples include
the QB3 Institute at the University of California, Berkeley and the Institute for
Bioengineering and Bioscience at the Georgia Institute of Technology.  The
availability of interagency funds targeted to foster and nurture such integrative
programs and institutes would strongly incentivize universities to establish and
maintain them, and could prompt a reframing of promotion standards that recognizes the value of collaborative and interdisciplinary education and research
in the life sciences.

Technologies in Enabling the New Biology

collaboration to develop the information sciences and technologies necessary

life sciences research productivity. Provision of resources for the transmission,
exchange, storage, security, analysis, and visualization of biological information
will be essential. Biological research is increasingly supported by large-scale
information resources available over computer networks. The development of
these resources is a community effort. Researchers provide data acquired in
their own laboratories, and data management systems organize the shared data
and provide software tools for accessing, displaying, and interpreting parts of
the data.
Traditional dissemination of results through publications in journals can
convey only a fraction of the information that is generated in most experiments.
To capture the full benefit of funded scientific work, one must maximize the
ability to share that information. Information about research results that is not
made accessible is lost to the rest of the research community and thus can be
considered a hidden tax on scientific research funding. Ongoing support for
the storage, curation, and accessibility of data is critical, but it is also exceedingly expensive and, for funding agencies, comes at the expense of funding
new research. Many specialized communities already exist to support database
resources, for example, those focused on model organisms, such as Fly Base
for the Drosophila community and TAIR for the Arabidopsis community. There
will be increasing demand for resources to support these efforts, especially to
support coordination among these specialized communities.
Because so much can be learned in biology by comparing results across
different organisms and systems, biological data have more value if made available in a form that can be easily shared, meaning that measurements from
one laboratory to another need to be clearly defined. Ideally, biological and
biomedical experiments should adhere to nomenclatures and protocols specified by standards bodies in consultation with communities of researchers. As
much as possible, data should be reproducible, with no ambiguity as to their
meaning and the experimental conditions under which they were acquired.
However, rigid application of standards can hold back the introduction of
new technologies and their application to a widening range of environments
and conditions. Innovation in experimental technologies and their application
will inevitably outpace efforts at standardization. Thus, while enforcing standards for mature technologies, data management systems must also incorporate
diverse types of ad hoc experimental measurements that are informative even
if loosely characterized.
A more recent development in the life sciences is the potential to derive
new information from existing collections of data. Hypotheses can be tested and
connections across different biological systems discovered using data acquired
from the published literature by curation or automated search, transferred from
other databases, or inferred from experimental data by various forms of aggregation, classification, clustering, comparison, annotation, or even analogical reasoning. For example, most of the reported assignments of proteins to functional

A NEW BIOLOGY FOR THE 21ST CENTURY

categories are derived not by biochemical experiments, but by imputation from
the functional classification of similar proteins, often from a different species.
The value of existing data can be multiplied by these approaches, but the basic
scientific requirement of reproducibility requires that database management
systems provide tools enabling researchers to trace the origins of such indirect
inferences and assess the supporting evidence.
The study of complex biological problems typically requires the integration of diverse data sources (Box 4.2). For example, understanding the possible

BOX 4.2
The Critical Role of an Information Infrastructure:
Two Examples
Electronic Medical Records
The revolution in information technology has provided an enormous opportunity
to make electronic medical records (EMR) a reality. These records not only have the
potential to improve the quality of health care, but also could contribute substantially
to basic biomedical research. In his speech to the annual meeting of the National
Academy of Sciences, President Obama noted that EMRs offer “the opportunity to
offer billions and billions of anonymous data points to medical researchers who may
find in this information evidence that can help us better understand disease” (The
White House, 2009).
The great potential of an EMR for biomedical research is that it provides integrated
health information, demographic data, imaging, and laboratory results for each individual. Currently, all the information that resides in each individual’s medical records
is essentially invisible to researchers. The ability to search this massive data source
would allow researchers to detect patterns in drug side effects, relationships between
genomic information and disease incidence, spread of infectious diseases, and many
others. However, the power of this resource to drive discovery and improve health has
yet to be realized. This tremendous opportunity depends on developing an adequate
information infrastructure.
Turning all of the information in patients’ medical records into a form that can be
standardized, digitized, secure, and anonymous is a major challenge and will require
developing adequate network and analysis capabilities so that researchers can make
full use of the data. The range of useful information that could be included is already
vast and will only grow with time as the affordable genome, high-throughput proteomics and metabolomics technologies, and ever more sophisticated imaging are just
over the horizon. A major effort to standardize (and anonymize) an EMR that provides
the full complement of patient information, and to develop the resources to make those
anonymized records fully accessible to researchers, would be an enormous boon to
clinical research.

impact of a new cancer drug might involve data from human genome-wide association studies, experiments with mice, characterizations of known molecular
pathways and metabolic processes in yeast, and clinical experience with related
drugs. A database on biodiversity might contain genetic sequence, photographs,
movies, museum catalogues and digital representations of samples, geospatial
coordinates, satellite images of collection sites over time, and detailed information about range, habitat, or behavior; ideally all of these kinds of data would
be cross-referenced. Statistics, machine learning, and data mining, supported by

The National Ecological Observatory Network
It has become increasingly evident that long-term measurements of ecological
function are key to sensing critical changes in the environment. Many studies are now
revealing that short-term assessments are not capable of revealing such diagnostic
and critical trends as changes in lake ice-melt, glacial melting, or changes in seasonal
behavior that signal biological responses to climate change. Research platforms that
allow early detection of changes in biological functioning over continental scales are
­necessary not only for understanding the interactions of climatic change and land use
with ecological processes, but also for anticipating threshold responses that could occur
during rapid environmental change. Similar to monitoring human health over broad
scales to assess trends in risk and improvement, regular collection of data on ecosystem
carbon dioxide exchange, land use change, and invasive and other species distributions
is critical for understanding and predicting future conditions that influence human wellbeing. The currently planned NEON research platform represents such an initiative.a
Just as with EMRs, the kinds of data researchers will need to share, compare, and analyze are exceedingly diverse: satellite images; air, water and soil characteristics; measurements of species diversity and population sizes; changes in the genomes, health,
and behavior of organisms; and many others. The benefits of such a data resource to
understand, monitor, and predict environmental conditions would be great.
Achieving either of these goals––making the information collected in EMRs available to clinical researchers or the environmental information provided by NEON and
many other sources to ecologists––will require a concerted effort. Ideally, even those
two very different sets of data would benefit from being inter-operable; understanding
the impact of the environment on human health, or how infectious agents pass between
animals and humans would be just two possible applications. The full benefit of the
impending revolutions in the life sciences discussed in this report will require a national
effort to develop an information infrastructure that would support these applications.

advances in probabilistic modeling, computational simulation, discrete mathematics, algorithms, and data structures, are rapidly advancing in their ability to
extract more information from such complex data sets. Innovative methods of
information display, based on advanced graphics capabilities including animation and virtual reality, will be essential for biological researchers to visualize
such complex models.
As argued throughout this report, the fundamental unity of biology means
that data generated to develop biofuels are relevant to biomedical researchers
and vice versa. Thus, building a system that captures the most possible value
from ongoing research is a challenge that must be addressed above the level of
any single biological subdiscipline or any one funding agency. The value of providing a standardized, shared database with a user-friendly interface is exemplified by Genbank (National Center for Biotechnology Information, 2009), which
provides researchers with a steadily increasing database of sequence information and standardized tools such as BLAST with which to analyze it. Genbank
is housed within NIH, but its use is cross-agency. Every biology-related publication is required to deposit any sequence generated into this central sequence
database, and biologists funded by every agency make use of it. The Genbank
model has not been achieved for other types of data that may not be as easy to
share and standardize as sequence information. But this does not make such
data less important.
There is no single, obvious solution to the challenge of providing a flexible,
efficient, and high-performance information infrastructure for the data that will
power the New Biology. As technology and biological knowledge advance, both
requirements and capabilities will shift. But explicitly acknowledging the essential role of information to the life sciences and investing the effort and resources
necessary to develop robust informational technologies and sciences would
have an enormous pay-off in capturing the full value of life sciences research
results. An immediate, interdisciplinary, and interagency effort to address the
information requirements of the New Biology would provide a system-wide
solution to a problem that is imposing greater and greater costs on the life sciences research establishment.
Engaging the Private Sector in the New Biology
The private sector has a great deal to contribute to the proposed New
Biology Initiative and should be engaged in the review and assessment of these
interdisciplinary projects. Both commercial and non-profit entities will be helpful in assessing knowledge in the field, helping to set objectives and evaluating
progress. In some areas, the private sector has capabilities more advanced than
the public sector, and is setting the standards for the field (e.g., handling of data
for use by web-based search engines). In such cases, interdisciplinary projects
would benefit from involving the private sector not only in review and assess-

ment, but also as explicit participants in the projects. In other areas, the private
sector has data that are not readily available in the public domain that could be
included in the projects. For example, efforts in the analysis of biological signaling pathways and networks rely on the compilation of extensive experiments
involving manipulation of gene expression. The pharmaceutical industry has a
large amount of such data, based on small-molecule drug manipulation, that is
not readily available in the public domain. Similarly, there is a large amount of
data from genetically informed breeding experiments in the agriculture industry. Such data would greatly facilitate the advancement of these pre-competitive
opportunities, which would serve to benefit all stakeholders.
Educating the New Biologist
To thrive, the New Biology will require researchers with both depth of
knowledge in a specific discipline and highly developed computational and
quantitative skills. In addition, the New Biology will require these investigators
to be well versed enough in varied disciplines and technologies to facilitate
dialogue with other researchers and participate in integrated research.
The emergence of the New Biology signals the need for changes in how
scientists are educated and trained. A highly visible science program like a New
Biology Initiative could inspire a new generation of students to see becoming a
scientist or engineer as a way to contribute to solving important societal problems. The Initiative itself would provide the opportunity to put in place and
evaluate new educational and training opportunities.
Thousands of reports, surveys, public speeches, articles, and television
shows have bemoaned the quality of science education in the United States and
numerous solutions to poor performance have been proposed. Many of these
solutions would contribute to preparing students for careers as New Biologists.
Implementing these solutions will require investment in human resources and
materials and interaction among educators and researchers from a broad spectrum of disciplines.
The New Biology represents an integrated, problem-focused approach to
science that is entirely consistent with research on how students learn best.
Just as the goal of landing on the moon inspired a generation of students, high
visibility projects using biology to solve important problems could provide
a platform to engage all students in the process of science, and illustrate the
excitement and benefits of using science and engineering to solve problems.
An ambitious, high visibility program would demonstrate that basic science
research is not distinct from society but is a critical ingredient in developing
innovative solutions to societal problems.
Integrating information from several disciplines to study practical questions is a valuable approach at any educational level from kindergarten on.
But it is at the undergraduate and graduate levels that the New Biology both

demands and presents an opportunity for new approaches. The New Biology
makes it clear that biology is not only about observing and describing natural
history and phenomena. Rather than teaching each level of biological organization separately––from molecules to cells to organs, etc., and on to ecosystems
(if time allows)––a New Biology curriculum would emphasize the interconnections among those levels to understand system-level phenomena. Harvard
University, for example, has recently introduced introductory courses that teach
basic science material in the context of understanding AIDS treatment, or the
possibility of synthetic life (Box 4.3).
Such an approach makes it clear that quantitative analysis, physics, and
chemistry are necessary to understand complex issues, along with biology. As

BOX 4.3
Connecting Bio 101 to Real-World Issues:
An Interdisciplinary Approach
In 2005–2006, Harvard University launched two semester-long introductory
courses that provide an interdisciplinary introduction to biology and chemistry. The
first course synthesizes essential topics in chemistry, molecular biology, and cell
­biology and the second synthesizes essential topics in genetics, genomics, probability,
and evolutionary biology. Scientific facts and concepts are introduced in the context of
exciting and interdisciplinary questions, such as understanding the possibility of synthetic life, the biology and treatment of AIDS and cancer, human population ­genetics,
and malaria. Through interdisciplinary teaching, students’ grasp of fundamental concepts is reinforced as they encounter the same principles in multiple situations.
Each course is taught by a small team of faculty from multiple departments.
Members of each teaching team attend all lectures and participate for the entire term.
The preparation for and teaching effort in each course offering is integrated. Teaching
assistants are also drawn from different departments and work in small interdepartmental teams.
Development of these courses required institutional support. The President,
Dean of the Faculty, and the Chair of the Life Sciences Council all provided funds
to support a one-year curriculum development effort, lab renovations, lower teaching fellow-student ratios, equipment, and development of teaching materials. One of
the founding faculty member’s HHMI undergraduate education award contributed to
developing specific sets of teaching materials.
Success depended on finding faculty members with personal commitments to
the principles of the courses and willingness to work as a team to build the new
courses from scratch. This effort was rewarded as individual departments agreed to
count these interdepartmental and interdisciplinary courses toward their respective
departmental teaching expectations.
Since the courses were implemented, undergraduate enrollment in introductory
life sciences courses is up more than 30 percent and the number of life sciences
majors has risen 18 percent.

students are taught to approach science as an exercise that solves a problem,
they will recognize how mathematics, physics, chemistry, computational science, and engineering contribute to the problem-solving process and therefore
see the relevance of and be more motivated to master these other disciplines.
Students and teachers alike will recognize that memorization of observations
and facts do not allow one to understand or predict how complicated biological systems behave—and without that ability one will not be able to solve
problems.
Engaging students in the New Biology will require science teachers who
understand and can pass on the interdisciplinary nature of science problemsolving. Exciting undergraduate experiences that are science based will not
only help attract students into research careers, but also equip those life science
majors who choose teaching careers with the disciplinary knowledge and handson experience to teach the New Biology.
Many of the changes that would help prepare students to practice the New
Biology have been recommended in several previous reports (Box 4.4), especially
a 2003 NRC report, Bio 2010: Transforming Undergraduate Education for Future
Research Biologists (National Research Council, 2003a). Bio 2010 recommended
that each institution of higher education reexamine its current curricula and
ensure that biology students gain a strong foundation in mathematics, physical

and chemical sciences, and engineering as biology research becomes increasingly interdisciplinary. Concepts, examples, and techniques from mathematics,
and the physical/chemical sciences should be included in biology courses, and
biological concepts and examples should be included in other science courses.
­College and university administrators, as well as funding agencies, should support mathematics and science faculty in the development or adaptation of techniques that improve interdisciplinary education for biologists. Bio 2010 also
called for laboratory courses to be as interdisciplinary as possible, and for all
students to be encouraged to pursue independent research as early as is practical
in their education. Finally, the report recognized that faculty development is a
crucial component to improving undergraduate biology education and called for
efforts to provide faculty the time necessary to refine their own understanding of
how the integrative relationships of biology, mathematics, the physical/chemical
sciences, and engineering can be best melded into either existing courses or new
courses in the particular areas of science in which they teach.
Implementing the recommendations of the Bio 2010 report would go a long
way toward preparing the biology students of the future to practice the New
Biology. The advances in life sciences research described in this report will create tremendous opportunities for students in the coming decades. Both at the
undergraduate and graduate level, a new generation of students could learn in
different ways, be challenged by new curricula and approaches, and contribute
to breakthroughs that can barely be imagined today. Implementation, however,
requires resources, time, and flexibility on the part of university administrators, faculty, and even students, who must be convinced that interdisciplinary
courses will satisfy graduate school or medical school admissions requirements.
A national New Biology Initiative could have a lasting impact by devoting some
of its resources to providing incentives for universities and researchers to find
innovative ways to implement recommendations like those in Bio 2010, and to
identifying and disseminating best practices. Grants programs could support
development of interdisciplinary courses like Harvard’s introductory biology
courses, or Princeton’s integrated science curriculum at other institutions. The
National Academies Summer Institute on Undergraduate Education in Biology,
created in direct response to a Bio 2010 recommendation, is another approach
that could be expanded with additional funding (Box 4.5).
A national New Biology Initiative could also support graduate training
programs designed to prepare researchers for careers as New Biologists. The
Integrative Graduate Education and Research Traineeship (IGERT) program
is an example of such a program (Box 4.6).
The new biology will be most successful if it attracts the best students from
a wide range of backgrounds. Communicating the excitement of biological

BOX 4.5
National Academies Summer Institute on
Undergraduate Education in Biology
The National Academies Summer Institute seeks to transform undergraduate
biology education at research universities nationwide by improving classroom teaching and attracting diverse students to science (Handelsman et al., 2004; Pfund et
al., 2009). Teams of two or three faculty members, most of whom teach introductory
courses, learn about and implement the themes of “scientific teaching” ­(Handelsman, et
al., 2004)—active learning, assessment, and diversity—during a week-long workshop
dedicated to teaching and learning. Participants work together to develop ­materials and
lessons that they agree to implement in their courses in the following year.
The impact of the Summer Institute is far greater than the individual teaching
materials; it transforms how individual faculty members view their teaching and, by
extension, influence other members of their departments and their disciplines to make
similar transformations (Pfund et al., 2009). Participants are asked to disseminate
what they learn at the Institute with colleagues on their campuses, and university
administrators commit to support participants in tangible ways upon their return to
campus. Participants are named National Academies Education Fellows in the Life
Sciences and are encouraged to become ambassadors for education reform on their
campuses and throughout their professional communities. The aim is, therefore, to
leverage a program that directly reaches 40–50 faculty per year—who themselves
teach 15,000–25,000 students per year—into one that reaches hundreds of thousands
of students.
Since 2004, more than 250 instructors from 82 institutions in 40 states have
participated in the Summer Institute including a broad cross-section of faculty from
throughout all of biology—anatomy to zoology—as well as deans and department
chairs, curriculum and laboratory coordinators, lecturers to postdocs.
The Summer Institute is supported by the Howard Hughes Medical Institute,
the Research Corporation for Science Advancement, the Burroughs Wellcome Fund,
the Presidents’ Committee of the National Research Council, and the University of
Wisconsin–Madison.

research is crucial to attracting, retaining, and sustaining a greater diversity of
students to the field (Box 4.7).
All of the agencies that support life sciences research have implemented
programs to attract participants from underrepresented groups. Some groups
remain underrepresented––in 2005, African Americans received 3.6 percent
and Hispanics 5.2 percent of doctorates in the biological sciences (Hill, 2006)—
it is certain that there is much to be learned by studying the effectiveness of
these different programs. A recent NRC workshop summary Understanding
Interventions that Encourage Minorities to Pursue Research Careers (National
Research Council, 2007a) discussed the need for research efforts to identify the

The Integrative Graduate Education and
Research Traineeship Program
Federal agency funding programs can be very effective at stimulating entrepreneurship and change at academic institutions. For example, the National Science Foundation supports large grants through its Integrative Graduate Education
and Research Traineeship (IGERT) program. This program has catalyzed numerous
universities (currently 125) to advance interdisciplinary education. According to the
program website—
the IGERT program was developed to meet the challenges of educating U.S.
Ph.D. scientists, engineers, and educators with the interdisciplinary backgrounds, deep knowledge in chosen disciplines, and technical, professional,
and personal skills to become in their own careers the leaders and creative
agents for change. The program is intended to catalyze a cultural change in
graduate education, for students, faculty, and institutions, by establishing innovative new models for graduate education and training in a fertile environment
for collaborative research that transcends traditional disciplinary boundaries.
The IGERT program, which has supported almost 5,000 students since its inception in 1998, is an example of how federal agencies can catalyze change within U.S.
institutions to reach true interdisciplinarity.

elements that characterize programs that are successful in increasing minority
participation. Including resources in a New Biology Initiative to encourage
minority participation and, importantly, to evaluate the success of those efforts,
will have an important pay-off in ensuring that the new biology benefits from
all of the talent this diverse country has to offer.
Conclusion
Many intellectual, technological, and institutional challenges will need to
be met in order for the New Biology to reach its full potential. Perhaps the
most challenging step will be achieving widespread recognition that an integrated approach to solving problems with the life sciences is important and
worthwhile. Some portion of the life sciences research enterprise will need to
be devoted to approaching the science in this new way. Empowering the New
Biology means adding a new layer to the traditional approach; an approach
that is purposefully organized around problem-solving; marshalling the basic
science, teams of researchers, technologies, and foundational sciences required
for the task; and coordinating efforts to ensure that gaps are filled, problems

BOX 4.7
The International Genetically Engineered Machine
(iGEM) Competition
Every November for the last five years, hundreds of dedicated young synthetic
biologists from around the world have gathered at MIT for the annual iGEM competition. Modeled after popular robotic design competitions, iGEM brings together
teams of students whose challenge is to use standard biological parts to design
and build a novel genetic-encoded machine that carries out an interesting or useful
function. In 2008, 84 teams from over 20 countries participated. Most teams are from
­undergraduate colleges and universities, but more recently, high school teams have
also begun to participate.
The iGEM competition has become a major force in both education and innovation. Scores of top students are drawn to the excitement of the new field of synthetic
biology, a field that is revolutionizing how biological systems are viewed and has the
potential to solve many societal problems. Students come from biology, computer
science, engineering, and many other fields, but work together to formulate their own
projects. All the standard biological parts they design are submitted to the iGEM parts
registry and projects are described on open websites. The teams gather at MIT to
present their work to a panel of judges.
iGEM projects rival those of professional research laboratories and biotech companies in sophistication, and frequently exceed them in innovative thinking. Projects
have included design of bacteria that sense arsenic, a bacterial replacement for blood,
and a synthetic cellular organelle that could be used to house biofuel pathways.
The iGEM competition provides a model for future modes of education in ­biology.
Unlike many summer research projects, iGEM projects are emergent—students come
up with their own ideas and work as a team to develop and execute them. The creative
challenge, competitive framework, and required self-investment results in extraordinary levels of motivation and innovation. The forward-looking iGEM team projects may
foreshadow how biology will be practiced and applied in the future.

solved, and resources brought to bear at the right time to keep the project moving forward. Close interaction between larger, problem-oriented projects and
the more decentralized basic research enterprise will be critical––and mutually
beneficial––as discoveries will continue to emerge from traditional approaches,
and advances that benefit all researchers will emerge from the large projects.
The New Biology Initiative would represent a daring addition to the nation’s
research portfolio, but the potential benefits are considerable: an immensely
more productive life sciences research community; new bio-based industries;
and, most importantly, innovative means to produce food and biofuels sustainably, monitor and restore ecosystems, and improve human health.

Recommendations

Society is at a tipping point in terms of challenges that influence our collective long-term future; the United States is well-poised to exert leadership in
addressing these urgent needs by creating a New Biology. Our response will
require launching an ambitious new effort that empowers individuals, agencies,
academic institutions, and the private sector to integrate a deeper understanding of biology with practical applications across the agriculture, environmental,
energy, and health sectors. Reaching these goals will require investing in a
new approach to setting research goals—taking a long-term and cross-cutting
approach both to foundational science and technology development, and to
evaluating progress and outcomes. A key factor in meeting these challenges will
be putting in place a flexible and functional interface among all of the agencies
whose programs touch on the life sciences. The committee believes that the
most promising way to achieve this interface is through a national initiative. It
will be individual agencies, however, that implement components of the initiative; therefore developing an efficient management and oversight structure to
facilitate communication and shared decision-making on cross-cutting investments is critical.
Finding 1
• The United States and the world face serious societal challenges in the
areas of food, environment, energy, and health.
• Innovations in biology can lead to sustainable solutions for all of these
challenges. Solutions in all four areas will be driven by advances in fundamental
understanding of basic biological processes.
• For each of these challenges, solutions are within reach, based on building the capacity to understand, predict, and influence the responses and capabilities of complex biological systems.

A NEW BIOLOGY FOR THE 21ST CENTURY

• There is broad support across the scientific community for pursuing
interdisciplinary research, but opportunities to do so are constrained by institutional barriers and available resources.
• Approaches that integrate a wide range of scientific disciplines, and
draw on the strengths and resources of universities, federal agencies, and the
private sector will accelerate progress toward making this potential a reality.
• The best way for the United States to capitalize on this scientific and
technological opportunity is to add to its current research portfolio a New
Biology effort that will accelerate understanding of complex biological systems,
driving rapid progress in meeting societal challenges and advancing fundamental knowledge.
Recommendation 1
The committee recommends a national initiative to accelerate the emergence
and growth of the New Biology to achieve solutions to societal challenges in
food, energy, environment, and health.
Finding 2
• For its success, the New Biology will require the creative drive and deep
knowledge base of individual scientists from across biology and many other
disciplines including physical, computational, and earth sciences, mathematics,
and engineering.
• The New Biology offers the potential to address questions at a scale
and with a focus that cannot be undertaken by any single scientific community,
agency, or sector.
• Providing a framework for different communities to work together will
lead to synergies and new approaches that no single community could have
achieved alone.
• A broad array of programs to identify, support, and facilitate biology
research exists in the federal government but value is being lost by not integrating these efforts.
• Interagency insight and oversight is critical to support the emergence
and growth of the New Biology Initiative. Interagency leadership will be needed
to oversee and coordinate the implementation of the initiative, evaluate its
­progress, establish necessary working subgroups, maintain communication,
guard against redundancy, and identify gaps and opportunities for leveraging
results across projects.
Recommendation 2:
The committee recommends that the national New Biology Initiative be an
interagency effort, that it have a timeline of at least 10 years, and that its funding be in addition to current research budgets.

RECOMMENDATIONS

89

Finding 3
• Information is the fundamental currency of the New Biology.
• Solutions to the challenges of standardization, exchange, storage, security, analysis, and visualization of biological information will multiply the value
of the research currently being supported across the federal government.
• Biological data are extraordinarily heterogeneous and interrelating various bodies of data is currently precluded by the lack of the necessary information infrastructure.
• It is critical that all researchers be able to share and access each others’
information in a common or fully interactive format.
• The productivity of biological research will increasingly depend on longterm, predictable support for a high-performance information infrastructure.
Recommendation 3
The committee recommends that, within the national New Biology Initiative,
priority be given to the development of the information technologies and sciences that will be critical to the success of the New Biology.
Finding 4
• Investment in education is essential if the New Biology is to reach its
full potential in meeting the core challenges of the 21st century.
• The New Biology Initiative provides an opportunity to attract students
to science who want to solve real-world problems.
• The New Biologist is not a scientist who knows a little bit about all disciplines, but a scientist with deep knowledge in one discipline and a “working
fluency” in several.
• Highly developed quantitative skills will be increasingly important.
• Development and implementation of genuinely interdisciplinary undergraduate courses and curricula will both prepare students for careers as New
Biology researchers and educate a new generation of science teachers well
versed in New Biology approaches.
• Graduate training programs that include opportunities for interdisciplinary work are essential.
• Programs to support faculty in developing new curricula will have a
multiplying effect.
Recommendation 4
The committee recommends that the national New Biology Initiative devote
resources to programs that support the creation and implementation of interdisciplinary curricula, graduate training programs, and educator training
needed to create and support New Biologists.

Appendix A
Statement of Task

An ad hoc committee will examine the current state of biological research
in the United States and recommend how best to capitalize on recent technological and scientific advances that have allowed biologists to integrate biological research findings, collect and interpret vastly increased amounts of data, and
predict the behavior of complex biological systems. Among the questions the
committee may address are:
• What fundamental biological questions are ready for major advances in
understanding? What would be the practical result of answering those questions? How could answers to those questions lead to high impact applications
in the near future?
• How can a fundamental understanding of living systems reduce uncertainty about the future of life on earth, improve human health and welfare,
and lead to the wise stewardship of our planet? Can the consequences of environmental, stochastic or genetic changes be understood in terms of the related
properties of robustness and fragility inherent in all biological systems?
• How can federal agencies more effectively leverage their investments in
biological research and education to address complex problems across scales
of analysis from basic to applied? In what areas would near term investment
be most likely to lead to substantial long-term benefit and a strong, competitive
advantage for the United States? Are there high-risk, high pay-off areas that
deserve serious consideration for seed funding?
• Are new funding mechanisms needed to encourage and support crosscutting, interdisciplinary or applied biology research?
• What are the major impediments to achieving a newly integrated
biology?

APPENDIX A

• What are the implications of a newly integrated biology for infrastructural
needs? How should infrastructural priorities be identified and planned for?
• What are the implications for the life sciences research culture of a
newly integrated approach to biology? How can physicists, chemists, mathematicians and engineers be encouraged to help build a wider biological enterprise
with the scope and expertise to address a broad range of scientific and societal
problems?
• Are changes needed in biology education—to ensure that biology
majors are equipped to work across traditional subdisciplinary boundaries, to
provide biology curricula that equip physical scientists and engineers to take
advantage of advances in biological science, and to provide nonscientists with
a level of biological understanding that gives them an informed voice regarding relevant policy proposals? Are alternative degree programs needed or can
biology departments be organized to attract and train students able to work
comfortably across disciplinary boundaries?
The subgroup of the committee will organize a Biology Summit to ­garner
input from a broad spectrum of stakeholders—government and private agencies
that fund biological research, the biotech and pharmaceutical industries, universities and medical schools—to consider barriers to progress and to highlight
exciting new areas of research that cross traditional disciplinary boundaries.
The Summit’s proceedings will be published as a separate, type-3 workshop
report. In a subsequent consensus report, the committee will recommend actions
that federal policy makers can take to ensure that the United States takes the
lead in the emergence of a biological science that will support a higher level of
confidence in our understanding of living systems, thus reducing uncertainty
about the future, contributing to innovative solutions for practical problems,
and allowing the development of robust and sustainable new technologies.
The committee will not make specific budgetary or government organizational
recommendations.
