Preface

Like all of the previous authors of this book, we are dedicated
to the concept that immunology is best taught and learned in
an experimentally-based manner, and we have retained that
emphasis with this edition. It is our goal that students should
complete an immunology course not only with a firm grasp
of content, but also with a clear sense of how key discoveries
were made, what interesting questions remain, and how they
might best be answered. We believe that this approach ensures
that students both master fundamental immunological concepts and internalize a vision of immunology as an active and
ongoing process. Guided by this vision, the new edition has
been extensively updated to reflect the recent advances in all
aspects of our discipline.

New Authorship
As a brand-new team of authors, we bring experience in both
research and undergraduate teaching to the development of this
new edition, which continues to reflect a dedication to pedagogical excellence originally modeled by Janis Kuby. We remain
deeply respectful of Kuby’s unique contribution to the teaching
of immunology and hope and trust that this new manifestation
of her creation will simply add to her considerable legacy.

OVERVIEW FIGURE 1-9 Collaboration between innate and
adaptive immunity in resolving an infection.

A new capstone chapter (Chapter 14) integrates the events
of an immune response into a complete story, with particular reference to the advanced imaging techniques that have
become available since the writing of the previous edition.
In this way, the molecular and cellular details presented in
Chapters 2-13 are portrayed in context, a moving landscape
of immune response events in time and space (Figure 14-5).

Understanding
Immunology As a Whole
We recognize that the immune system is an integrated network
of cells, molecules, and organs, and that each component relies
on the rest to function properly. This presents a pedagogical
challenge because to understand the whole, we must attain
working knowledge of many related pieces of information,
and these do not always build upon each other in simple linear fashion. In acknowledgment of this challenge, this edition
presents the “big picture” twice; first as an introductory overview to immunity, then, thirteen chapters later, as an integration of the details students have learned in the intervening text.
Specifically, Chapter 1 has been revised to make it more
approachable for students who are new to immunology. The
chapter provides a short historical background to the field and
an introduction to some of the key players and their roles in
the immune response, keeping an eye on fundamental concepts (Overview Figure 1-9). A new section directly addresses
some of the biggest conceptual hurdles, but leaves the cellular
and molecular details for later chapters.

The order of chapters in the seventh edition has been revised
to better reflect the sequence of events that occurs naturally
during an immune response in vivo. This offers instructors
the opportunity to lead their students through the steps of
an immune response in a logical sequence, once they have
learned the essential features of the tissues, cells, molecular
structures, ligand-receptor binding interactions, and signaling pathways necessary for the functioning of the immune
system. The placement of innate immunity at the forefront
of the immune response enables it to take its rightful place
as the first, and often the only, aspect of immunity that an
organism needs to counter an immune insult. Similarly, the
chapter on complement is located within the sequence in a
place that highlights its function as a bridge between innate
and adaptive immune processes. However, we recognize that
a course in immunology is approached differently by each
instructor. Therefore, as much as possible, we have designed
each of the chapters so that it can stand alone and be offered
in an alternative order.

signaling, as well as to specific molecules and pathways
involved in signaling through antigen receptors. Chapter
4 includes a more thorough introduction to the roles of
cytokines and chemokines in the immune response.
• An expanded and updated treatment of innate immunity
(Chapter 5), which now includes comprehensive coverage of the many physical, chemical, and cellular defenses
that constitute the innate immune system, as well as
the ways in which it activates and regulates adaptive
immunity.
• Substantial rewriting of chapters concerned with
complement (Chapter 6) and antigen receptor gene
rearrangement (Chapter 7). These chapters have been extensively revised for clarity in both text and figures. The
description of the complement system has been updated
to include the involvement of complement proteins in
both innate and adaptive aspects of immunity.
• A restructured presentation of the MHC, with the addition of new information relevant to cross-presentation
pathways (Chapter 8) (Figure 8-22b).

Challenging All Levels
While this book is written as a text for students new to immunology, it is also our intent to challenge students to reach
deeply into the field and to appreciate the connections with
other aspects of biology. Instead of reducing difficult topics to vague and simplistic forms, we instead present them
with the level of detail and clarity necessary to allow the
beginning student to find and understand information they
may need in the future. This offers the upper level student
a foundation from which they can progress to the investigation of advances and controversies within the current
immunological literature. Supplementary focus boxes have
been used to add nuance or detail to discussions of particular experiments or ideas without detracting from the flow
of information. These boxes, which address experimental
approaches, evolutionary connections, clinical aspects, or
advanced material, also allow instructors to tailor their use
appropriately for individual courses. They provide excellent
launching points for more intensive in class discussions
relevant to the material.
Some of the most visible changes and improvements
include:
• A rewritten chapter on the cells and organs of the immune system (Chapter 2) that includes up to date images
reflecting our new understanding of the microenvironments where the host immune system develops and
responds.
• The consolidation of signaling pathways into two
chapters: Chapter 3 includes a basic introduction to
ligand:receptor interactions and principles of receptor

• The dedication of specialized chapters concerned with
T cell development and T cell activation (Chapters 9
and Chapter 11, respectively). Chapter 11 now includes
current descriptions of the multiple helper T cell subsets
that regulate the adaptive immune response.
• Substantially rewritten chapters on B cell development
and B cell activation (Chapters 10 and 12, respectively)
that address the physiological locations as well as the nature of the interacting cells implicated in these processes.
• An updated discussion of the role of effector cells and
molecules in clearing infection (Chapter 13), including a
more thorough treatment of NK and NKT cells.

Preface

• A new chapter that describes advances in understanding and visualizing the dynamic behavior and activities of immune cells in secondary and tertiary tissue
(Chapter 14).
• Substantial revision and updating of the clinical chapters
(Chapters 15-19) including the addition of several new
clinically relevant focus boxes.
• Revised and updated versions of the final methods chapter (Chapter 20), and the appendices of CD antigens,
chemokines, and cytokines and their receptors.
Throughout the book, we attempt to provide a “big picture”
context for necessary details in a way that facilitates greater
student understanding.

Recent Advances and Other Additions
Immunology is a rapidly growing field, with new discoveries,
advances in techniques, and previously unappreciated connections coming to light every day. The 7th edition has been
thoroughly updated throughout, and now integrates the following new material and concepts:
• New immune cell types and subtypes, as well as the
phenotypic plasticity that is possible between certain
subtypes of immune cells.
• A greater appreciation for the wide range of mechanisms
responsible for innate immunity and the nature and roles
of innate responses in sensing danger, inducing inflammation, and shaping the adaptive response (Figure 5-18).

Connections to the Bench,
the Clinic, and Beyond
We have made a concerted effort in the 7th edition to integrate
experimental and clinical aspects of immunology into the
text. In Chapter 2, illustrations of immune cells and tissues are
shown alongside histological sections or, where possible, electron

micrographs, so students can see what they actually look like.
Throughout the text, experimental data are used to demonstrate the bases for our knowledge (Figure 3-4b), and the
clinical chapters at the end of the book (Chapters 15 through
19) describe new advances, new challenges, and newly appreciated connections between the immune system and disease.

FIGURE 3-4b Targeted delivery of cytokines (pink).

Featured Boxes
Associated with each chapter are additional boxed materials
that provide specialized information on historically-important
studies (Classic Experiments) that changed the way immunologists viewed the field, noteworthy new breakthroughs
(Advances) that have occurred since the last edition, the
clinical relevance of particular topics (Clinical Focus) and
the evolution of aspects of immune functioning (Evolution).
Examples of such boxes are “The Prime and Pull Vaccine
strategy,” “Genetic defects in components of innate and inflammatory responses associated with disease,” “The role of
miRNAs in the control of B cell development” and an updated
“Stem cells: Clinical uses and potential.” We have involved our
own undergraduate students in the creation of some of these
boxes, which we believe have greatly benefitted from their
perspective on how to present interesting material effectively
to their fellow students.

Critical Thinking and Data Analysis
Integration of experimental evidence throughout the book
keeps students focused on the how and why. Detailed and
clear descriptions of the current state of the field provide
students with the knowledge, skills, and vocabulary to read
critically in the primary literature. Updated and revised study
questions at the end of the chapter range from simple recall of
information to analyzing original data or proposing hypotheses to explain remaining questions in the field. Classic Experiment boxes throughout the text help students to appreciate
the seminal experiments in immunology and how they were
conducted, providing a bridge to the primary research articles
and emphasizing data analysis at every step.

Overview of the
Immune System

T

he immune system evolved to protect
multicellular organisms from pathogens. Highly
adaptable, it defends the body against invaders
as diverse as the tiny (~30 nm), intracellular
virus that causes polio and as large as the giant parasitic
kidney worm Dioctophyme renale, which can grow to
over 100 cm in length and 10 mm in width. This
diversity of potential pathogens requires a range of
recognition and destruction mechanisms to match the
multitude of invaders. To accomplish this feat,
vertebrates have evolved a complicated and dynamic
network of cells, molecules, and pathways. Although
elements of these networks can be found throughout the
plant and animal kingdoms, the focus of this book will
be on the highly evolved mammalian immune system.
The fully functional immune system involves so many
organs, molecules, cells, and pathways in such an
interconnected and sometimes circular process that it is
often difficult to know where to start! Recent advances in
cell imaging, genetics, bioinformatics, as well as cell and
molecular biology, have helped us to understand many of
the individual players in great molecular detail. However,
a focus on the details (and there are many) can make
taking a step back to see the bigger picture challenging,
and it is often the bigger picture that motivates us to study
immunology. Indeed, the field of immunology can be
credited with the vaccine that eradicated smallpox, the
ability to transplant organs between humans, and the
drugs used today to treat asthma. Our goal in this chapter
is therefore to present the background and concepts in
immunology that will help bridge the gap between the
cellular and molecular detail presented in subsequent
chapters and the complete picture of an immune response.
A clear understanding of each of the many players involved
will help one appreciate the intricate coordination of an
immune system that makes all of this possible.
The study of immunology has produced amazing and
fascinating stories (some of which you will see in this
book), where host and microbe engage in battles waged
over both minutes and millennia. But the immune system
is also much more than an isolated component of the
body, merely responsible for search-and-destroy missions.
In fact, it interleaves with many of the other body systems,

including the endocrine, nervous, and metabolic systems,
with more connections undoubtedly to be discovered in
time. Finally, it has become increasingly clear that elements
of immunity play key roles in regulating homeostasis in the
body for a healthy balance. Information gleaned from the
study of the immune system, as well as its connections
with other systems, will likely have resounding
repercussions across many basic science and biomedical
fields, not to mention in the future of clinical medicine.
This chapter begins with a historical perspective,
charting the beginnings of the study of immunology, largely
driven by the human desire to survive major outbreaks of
infectious disease. This is followed by presentation of a few
key concepts that are important hallmarks of the
mammalian immune response, many of which may not
have been encountered elsewhere in basic biology. This is
not meant as a comprehensive overview of the mammalian
immune system but rather as a means for jumping the large
conceptual hurdles frequently encountered as one begins to
describe the complexity and interconnected nature of the
immune response. We hope this will whet the appetite and
prepare the reader for a more thorough discussion of the
specific components of immunity presented in the

Introduction

following chapters. We conclude with a few challenging
clinical situations, such as instances in which the immune
system fails to act or becomes the aggressor, turning its
awesome powers against the host. More in-depth coverage
of these and other medical aspects of immunology can be
found in the final chapters of this book.

A Historical Perspective
of Immunology
The discipline of immunology grew out of the observation
that individuals who had recovered from certain infectious
diseases were thereafter protected from the disease. The
Latin term immunis, meaning “exempt,” is the source of the
English word immunity, a state of protection from infectious disease. Perhaps the earliest written reference to the
phenomenon of immunity can be traced back to Thucydides, the great historian of the Peloponnesian War. In
describing a plague in Athens, he wrote in 430 bc that only
those who had recovered from the plague could nurse the
sick because they would not contract the disease a second
time. Although early societies recognized the phenomenon
of immunity, almost 2000 years passed before the concept
was successfully converted into medically effective practice.

Early Vaccination Studies Led
the Way to Immunology
The first recorded attempts to deliberately induce immunity
were performed by the Chinese and Turks in the fifteenth
century. They were attempting to prevent smallpox, a disease
that is fatal in about 30% of cases and that leaves survivors
disfigured for life (Figure 1-1). Reports suggest that the dried
crusts derived from smallpox pustules were either inhaled or
inserted into small cuts in the skin (a technique called variolation) in order to prevent this dreaded disease. In 1718,
Lady Mary Wortley Montagu, the wife of the British ambassador in Constantinople, observed the positive effects of
variolation on the native Turkish population and had the
technique performed on her own children.
The English physician Edward Jenner later made a giant
advance in the deliberate development of immunity, again
targeting smallpox. In 1798, intrigued by the fact that milkmaids who had contracted the mild disease cowpox were subsequently immune to the much more severe smallpox, Jenner
reasoned that introducing fluid from a cowpox pustule into
people (i.e., inoculating them) might protect them from smallpox. To test this idea, he inoculated an eight-year-old boy with
fluid from a cowpox pustule and later intentionally infected the
child with smallpox. As predicted, the child did not develop
smallpox. Although this represented a major breakthrough, as
one might imagine, these sorts of human studies could not be
conducted under current standards of medical ethics.
Jenner’s technique of inoculating with cowpox to protect
against smallpox spread quickly through Europe. However, it

was nearly a hundred years before this technique was applied
to other diseases. As so often happens in science, serendipity
combined with astute observation led to the next major
advance in immunology: the induction of immunity to cholera. Louis Pasteur had succeeded in growing the bacterium
that causes fowl cholera in culture, and confirmed this by
injecting it into chickens that then developed fatal cholera.
After returning from a summer vacation, he and colleagues
resumed their experiments, injecting some chickens with an
old bacterial culture. The chickens became ill, but to Pasteur’s
surprise, they recovered. Interested, Pasteur then grew a fresh
culture of the bacterium with the intention of injecting this
lethal brew into some fresh, unexposed chickens. But as the
story is told, his supply of fresh chickens was limited, and
therefore he used a mixture of previously injected chickens
and unexposed birds. Unexpectedly, only the fresh chickens
died, while the chickens previously exposed to the older
bacterial culture were completely protected from the disease.
Pasteur hypothesized and later showed that aging had weakened the virulence of the pathogen and that such a weakened
or attenuated strain could be administered to provide immunity against the disease. He called this attenuated strain a

vaccine (from the Latin vacca, meaning “cow”), in honor of
Jenner’s work with cowpox inoculation.
Pasteur extended these findings to other diseases, demonstrating that it was possible to attenuate a pathogen and administer the attenuated strain as a vaccine. In a now classic
experiment performed in the small village of Pouilly-le-Fort in
1881, Pasteur first vaccinated one group of sheep with anthrax
bacteria (Bacillus anthracis) that were attenuated by heat treatment. He then challenged the vaccinated sheep, along with
some unvaccinated sheep, with a virulent culture of the anthrax
bacillus. All the vaccinated sheep lived and all the unvaccinated
animals died. These experiments marked the beginnings of the
discipline of immunology. In 1885, Pasteur administered his
first vaccine to a human, a young boy who had been bitten
repeatedly by a rabid dog (Figure 1-2). The boy, Joseph Meister,
was inoculated with a series of attenuated rabies virus preparations. The rabies vaccine is one of very few that can be successful
when administered shortly after exposure, as long as the virus
has not yet reached the central nervous system and begun to
induce neurologic symptoms. Joseph lived, and later became a
caretaker at the Pasteur Institute, which was opened in 1887 to
treat the many rabies victims that began to flood in when word
of Pasteur’s success spread; it remains to this day an institute
dedicated to the prevention and treatment of infectious disease.

Vaccination Is an Ongoing,
Worldwide Enterprise
The emergence of the study of immunology and the discovery
of vaccines are tightly linked. The development of effective
vaccines for some pathogens is still a major challenge, discussed in greater detail in Chapter 17. However, despite many
biological and social hurdles, vaccination has yielded some of
the most profound success stories in terms of improving mortality rates worldwide, especially in very young children.
In 1977, the last known case of naturally acquired smallpox was seen in Somalia. This dreaded disease was eradicated by universal application of a vaccine similar to that
used by Jenner in the 1790s. One consequence of eradication
is that universal vaccination becomes unnecessary. This is a
tremendous benefit, as most vaccines carry at least a slight
risk to persons vaccinated. And yet in many cases every
individual does not need to be immune in order to protect
most of the population. As a critical mass of people acquire
protective immunity, either through vaccination or infection,
they can serve as a buffer for the rest. This principle, called
herd immunity, works by decreasing the number of individuals who can harbor and spread an infectious agent, significantly decreasing the chances that susceptible individuals
will become infected. This presents an important altruistic
consideration: although many of us could survive infectious
diseases for which we receive a vaccine (such as the flu), this
is not true for everyone. Some individuals cannot receive the
vaccine (e.g., the very young or immune compromised), and
vaccination is never 100% effective. In other words, the susceptible, nonimmune individuals among us can benefit from
the pervasive immunity of their neighbors.
However, there is a darker side to eradication and the end
of universal vaccination. Over time, the number of people
with no immunity to the disease will begin to rise, ending
herd immunity. Vaccination for smallpox largely ended by
the early to mid-1970s, leaving well over half of the current
world population susceptible to the disease. This means that
smallpox, or a weaponized version, is now considered a
potential bioterrorism threat. In response, new and safer
vaccines against smallpox are still being developed today,
most of which go toward vaccinating U.S. military personnel
thought to be at greatest risk of possible exposure.
In the United States and other industrialized nations, vaccines have eliminated a host of childhood diseases that were
the cause of death for many young children just 50 years ago.
Measles, mumps, chickenpox, whooping cough (pertussis),
tetanus, diphtheria, and polio, once thought of as an inevitable part of childhood are now extremely rare or nonexistent in the United States because of current vaccination
practices (Table 1-1). One can hardly estimate the savings to
society resulting from the prevention of these diseases. Aside
from suffering and mortality, the cost to treat these illnesses
and their aftereffects or sequelae (such as paralysis, deafness,
blindness, and mental retardation) is immense and dwarfs
the costs of immunization. In fact, recent estimates suggest

that significant economic and human life benefits could be
realized by simply scaling up the use of a few childhood vaccines in the poorest nations, which currently bear the brunt
of the impact of these childhood infectious diseases. For
example, it is estimated that childhood pneumonia alone,
caused primarily by vaccine-preventable Streptococcus pneumoniae (aka, pneumococcus) and Haemophilus influenzae
type b (aka, Hib), will account for 2.7 million childhood
deaths in developing nations over the next decade if vaccine
strategies in these regions remain unchanged.
Despite the many successes of vaccine programs, such as
the eradication of smallpox, many vaccine challenges still
remain. Perhaps the greatest current challenge is the design of
effective vaccines for major killers such as malaria and AIDS.
Using our increased understanding of the immune system,
plus the tools of molecular and cellular biology, genomics, and
proteomics, scientists will be better positioned to make progress toward preventing these and other emerging infectious
diseases. A further issue is the fact that millions of children in
developing countries die from diseases that are fully preventable by available, safe vaccines. High manufacturing costs,
instability of the products, and cumbersome delivery problems
keep these vaccines from reaching those who might benefit the
most. This problem could be alleviated in many cases by development of future-generation vaccines that are inexpensive,
heat stable, and administered without a needle. Finally, misinformation and myth surrounding vaccine efficacy and side
effects continues to hamper many potentially life-saving vaccination programs (see Clinical Focus Box on p. 5).

Immunology Is About More Than Just Vaccines
and Infectious Disease
For some diseases, immunization programs may be the best or
even the only effective defense. At the top of this list are infec-

tious diseases that can cause serious illness or even death in
unvaccinated individuals, especially those transmitted by
microbes that also spread rapidly between hosts. However, vaccination is not the only way to prevent or treat infectious disease. First and foremost is preventing infection, where access to
clean water, good hygiene practices, and nutrient-rich diets can
all inhibit transmission of infectious agents. Second, some
infectious diseases are self-limiting, easily treatable, and nonlethal for most individuals, making them unlikely targets for
costly vaccination programs. These include the common cold,
caused by the Rhinovirus, and cold sores that result from Herpes Simplex Virus infection. Finally, some infectious agents are
just not amenable to vaccination. This could be due to a range
of factors, such as the number of different molecular variants
of the organism, the complexity of the regimen required to
generate protective immunity, or an inability to establish the
needed immunologic memory responses (more on this later).
One major breakthrough in the treatment of infectious
disease came when the first antibiotics were introduced in
the 1920s. Currently there are more than a hundred different
antibiotics on the market, although most fall into just six or
seven categories based on their mode of action. Antibiotics
are chemical agents designed to destroy certain types of bacteria. They are ineffective against other types of infectious
agents, as well as some bacterial species. One particularly
worrying trend is the steady rise in antibiotic resistance
among strains traditionally amenable to these drugs, making
the design of next-generation antibiotics and new classes of
drugs increasingly important. Although antiviral drugs are
also available, most are not effective against many of the most
common viruses, including influenza. This makes preventive
vaccination the only real recourse against many debilitating
infectious agents, even those that rarely cause mortality in
healthy adults. For instance, because of the high mutation
rate of the influenza virus, each year a new flu vaccine must

CLINICAL FOCUS

Vaccine Controversy: What’s Truth and What’s Myth?
Despite the record of worldwide success of vaccines in improving public health,
some opponents claim that vaccines do
more harm than good, pressing for elimination or curtailment of childhood vaccination programs. There is no dispute that
vaccines represent unique safety issues,
since they are administered to people who
are healthy. Furthermore, there is general
agreement that vaccines must be rigorously tested and regulated, and that the
public must have access to clear and complete information about them. Although
the claims of vaccine critics must be evaluated, many can be answered by careful and
objective examination of records.
A recent example is the claim that vaccines given to infants and very young
children may contribute to the rising incidence of autism. This began with the suggestion that thimerosal, a mercury-based
additive used to inhibit bacterial growth in
some vaccine preparations since the
1930s, was causing autism in children. In
1999 the U.S. Centers for Disease Control
and Prevention (CDC) and the American
Association of Pediatricians (AAP) released
a joint recommendation that vaccine
manufacturers begin to gradually phase
out thimerosal use in vaccines. This recommendation was based on the increase in
the number of vaccines given to infants
and was aimed at keeping children at or
below Environmental Protection Agency
(EPA)–recommended maximums in mercury exposure. However, with the release
of this recommendation, parent-led public
advocacy groups began a media-fueled
campaign to build a case demonstrating

what they believed was a link between
vaccines and an epidemic of autism. These
AAP recommendations and public fears
led to a dramatic decline in the latter half
of 1999 in U.S. newborns vaccinated for
hepatitis B. To date, no credible study has
shown a scientific link between thimerosal
and autism. In fact, cases of autism in children have continued to rise since thimerosal was removed from all childhood
vaccines in 2001. Despite evidence to the
contrary, some still believe this claim.
A 1998 study appearing in The Lancet, a
reputable British medical journal, further
fueled these parent advocacy groups and
anti-vaccine organizations. The article,
published by Andrew Wakefield, claimed
the measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine caused pervasive developmental disorders in children, including autism
spectrum disorder. More than a decade of
subsequent research has been unable to
substantiate these claims, and 10 of the
original 12 authors on the paper later withdrew their support for the conclusions of
the study. In 2010, The Lancet retracted the
original article when it was shown that the
data in the study had been falsified to
reach desired conclusions. Nonetheless, in
the years between the original publication
of the Lancet article and its retraction, this
case is credited with decreasing rates of
MMR vaccination from a high of 92% to a
low of almost 60% in certain areas of the
United Kingdom. The resulting expansion
in the population of susceptible individuals led to endemic rates of measles and
mumps infection, especially in several
areas of Europe, and is credited with thou-

be prepared based on a prediction of the prominent genotypes likely to be encountered in the next season. Some years
this vaccine is more effective than others. If and when a more
lethal and unexpected pandemic strain arises, there will be a
race between its spread and the manufacture and administration of a new vaccine. With the current ease of worldwide
travel, present-day emergence of a pandemic strain of influenza could dwarf the devastation wrought by the 1918 flu
pandemic, which left up to 50 million dead.

sands of extended hospitalizations and
several deaths in infected children.
Why has there been such a strong urge
to cling to the belief that childhood vaccines
are linked with developmental disorders in
children despite much scientific evidence to
the contrary? One possibility lies in the timing of the two events. Based on current AAP
recommendations, in the United States
most children receive 14 different vaccines
and a total of up to 26 shots by the age of 2.
In 1983, children received less than half this
number of vaccinations. Couple this with
the onset of the first signs of autism and
other developmental disorders in children,
which can appear quite suddenly and peak
around 2 years of age. This sharp rise in the
number of vaccinations young children
receive today and coincidence in timing of
initial autism symptoms is credited with
sparking these fears about childhood vaccines. Add to this the increasing drop in
basic scientific literacy by the general public
and the overabundance of ways to gather
such information (accurate or not). As concerned parents search for answers, one can
begin to see how even scientifically unsupported links could begin to take hold as
families grapple with how to make intelligent public health risk assessments.
The notion that vaccines cause autism
was rejected long ago by most scientists.
Despite this, more work clearly needs to be
done to bridge the gap between public
perception and scientific understanding.

However, the eradication of infectious disease is not the
only worthy goal of immunology research. As we will see later,
exposure to infectious agents is part of our evolutionary history, and wiping out all of these creatures could potentially
cause more harm than good, both for the host and the environment. Thanks to many technical advances allowing scientific
discoveries to move efficiently from the bench to the bedside,
clinicians can now manipulate the immune response in ways
never before possible. For example, treatments to boost, inhibit,

or redirect the specific efforts of immune cells are being applied
to treat autoimmune disease, cancer, and allergy, as well as
other chronic disorders. These efforts are already extending
and saving lives. Likewise, a clearer understanding of immunity has highlighted the interconnected nature of body systems, providing unique insights into areas such as cell biology,
human genetics, and metabolism. While a cure for AIDS and a
vaccine to prevent HIV infection are still the primary targets
for many scientists who study this disease, a great deal of basic
science knowledge has been gleaned from the study of just this
one virus and its interaction with the human immune system.

Immunity Involves Both Humoral
and Cellular Components
Pasteur showed that vaccination worked, but he did not
understand how. Some scientists believed that immune protection in vaccinated individuals was mediated by cells, while
others postulated that a soluble agent delivered protection.
The experimental work of Emil von Behring and Shibasaburo
Kitasato in 1890 gave the first insights into the mechanism
of immunity, earning von Behring the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1901 (Table 1-2). Von Behring and

FIGURE 1-3 Drawing by Elie Metchnikoff of phagocytic cells surrounding a foreign particle (left) and modern image of a
phagocyte engulfing the bacteria that cause tuberculosis (right). Metchnikoff first described and named the process of phagocytosis,
or ingestion of foreign matter by white blood cells. Today, phagocytic cells can be imaged in great detail using advanced microscopy techniques.

Kitasato demonstrated that serum—the liquid, noncellular
component recovered from coagulated blood—from animals previously immunized with diphtheria could transfer
the immune state to unimmunized animals.
In 1883, even before the discovery that a serum component could transfer immunity, Elie Metchnikoff, another
Nobel Prize winner, demonstrated that cells also contribute
to the immune state of an animal. He observed that certain
white blood cells, which he termed phagocytes, ingested
(phagocytosed) microorganisms and other foreign material (Figure 1-3, left). Noting that these phagocytic cells
were more active in animals that had been immunized,
Metchnikoff hypothesized that cells, rather than serum
components, were the major effectors of immunity. The
active phagocytic cells identified by Metchnikoff were
likely blood monocytes and neutrophils (see Chapter 2),
which can now be imaged using very sophisticated microscopic techniques (Figure 1-3, right).
Humoral Immunity
The debate over cells versus soluble mediators of immunity raged for decades. In search of the protective agent of
immunity, various researchers in the early 1900s helped
characterize the active immune component in blood
serum. This soluble component could neutralize or precipitate toxins and could agglutinate (clump) bacteria. In
each case, the component was named for the activity it
exhibited: antitoxin, precipitin, and agglutinin, respectively. Initially, different serum components were thought
to be responsible for each activity, but during the 1930s,
mainly through the efforts of Elvin Kabat, a fraction of

serum first called gamma globulin (now immunoglobulin) was shown to be responsible for all these activities.
The soluble active molecules in the immunoglobulin fraction of serum are now commonly referred to as antibodies. Because these antibodies were contained in body
fluids (known at that time as the body humors), the immunologic events they participated in was called humoral
immunity.
The observation of von Behring and Kitasato was quickly
applied to clinical practice. Antiserum, the antibodycontaining serum fraction from a pathogen-exposed individual, derived in this case from horses, was given to patients
suffering from diphtheria and tetanus. A dramatic vignette
of this application is described in the Clinical Focus box on
page 8. Today there are still therapies that rely on transfer of
immunoglobulins to protect susceptible individuals. For
example, emergency use of immune serum, containing antibodies against snake or scorpion venoms, is a common
practice for treating bite victims. This form of immune protection that is transferred between individuals is called passive immunity because the individual receiving it did not
make his or her own immune response against the pathogen.
Newborn infants benefit from passive immunity by the presence of maternal antibodies in their circulation. Passive
immunity may also be used as a preventive (prophylaxis) to
boost the immune potential of those with compromised
immunity or who anticipate future exposure to a particular
microbe.
While passive immunity can supply a quick solution, it is
short-lived and limited, as the cells that produce these antibodies are not being transferred. On the other hand, administration

Introduction

CLINICAL FOCUS

Passive Antibodies and the Iditarod
In 1890, immunologists Emil Behring
and Shibasaburo Kitasato, working
together in Berlin, reported an extraordinary experiment. After immunizing rabbits
with tetanus and then collecting blood
serum from these animals, they injected a
small amount of immune serum (cell-free
fluid) into the abdominal cavity of six mice.
Twenty-four hours later, they infected the
treated mice and untreated controls with
live, virulent tetanus bacteria. All of the control mice died within 48 hours of infection,
whereas the treated mice not only survived
but showed no effects of infection. This
landmark experiment demonstrated two
important points. One, it showed that substances that could protect an animal
against pathogens appeared in serum following immunization. Two, this work demonstrated that immunity could be passively
acquired, or transferred from one animal to
another by taking serum from an immune
animal and injecting it into a nonimmune
one. These and subsequent experiments
did not go unnoticed. Both men eventually
received titles (Behring became von Behring and Kitasato became Baron Kitasato). A
few years later, in 1901, von Behring was

awarded the first Nobel Prize in Physiology
or Medicine (see Table 1-2).
These early observations, and others,
paved the way for the introduction of passive immunization into clinical practice.
During the 1930s and 1940s, passive
immunotherapy, the endowment of
resistance to pathogens by transfer of
antibodies from an immunized donor to
an unimmunized recipient, was used to
prevent or modify the course of measles
and hepatitis A. Subsequently, clinical
experience and advances in the technology of immunoglobulin preparation have
made this approach a standard medical
practice. Passive immunization based on
the transfer of antibodies is widely used in
the treatment of immunodeficiency and
some autoimmune diseases. It is also used
to protect individuals against anticipated
exposure to infectious and toxic agents
against which they have no immunity.
Finally, passive immunization can be lifesaving during episodes of certain types of
acute infection, such as following exposure to rabies virus.
Immunoglobulin for passive immunization is prepared from the pooled

of a vaccine or natural infection is said to engender active
immunity in the host: the production of one’s own immunity.
The induction of active immunity can supply the individual
with a renewable, long-lived protection from the specific infectious organism. As we discuss further below, this long-lived
protection comes from memory cells, which provide protection for years or even decades after the initial exposure.
Cell-Mediated Immunity
A controversy developed between those who held to the
concept of humoral immunity and those who agreed with
Metchnikoff ’s concept of immunity imparted by specific
cells, or cell-mediated immunity. The relative contributions
of the two were widely debated at the time. It is now obvious
that both are correct—the full immune response requires
both cellular and humoral (soluble) components. Early studies of immune cells were hindered by the lack of genetically
defined animal models and modern tissue culture tech-

plasma of thousands of donors. In effect,
recipients of these antibody preparations are receiving a sample of the antibodies produced by many people to a
broad diversity of pathogens—a gram of
intravenous immune globulin (IVIG) contains about 1018 molecules of antibody
and recognize more than 107 different
antigens. A product derived from the
blood of such a large number of donors
carries a risk of harboring pathogenic
agents, particularly viruses. This risk is
minimized by modern-day production
techniques. The manufacture of IVIG
involves treatment with solvents, such
as ethanol, and the use of detergents
that are highly effective in inactivating
viruses such as HIV and hepatitis. In
addition to treatment against infectious
disease, or acute situations, IVIG is also
used today for treating some chronic
diseases, including several forms of
immune deficiency. In all cases, the
transfer of passive immunity supplies
only temporary protection.
One of the most famous instances of
passive antibody therapy occurred in
1925, when an outbreak of diphtheria

niques, whereas early studies with serum took advantage of
the ready availability of blood and established biochemical
techniques to purify proteins. Information about cellular
immunity therefore lagged behind a characterization of
humoral immunity.
In a key experiment in the 1940s, Merrill Chase, working
at The Rockefeller Institute, succeeded in conferring immunity
against tuberculosis by transferring white blood cells
between guinea pigs. Until that point, attempts to develop an
effective vaccine or antibody therapy against tuberculosis
had met with failure. Thus, Chase’s demonstration helped to
rekindle interest in cellular immunity. With the emergence
of improved cell culture and transfer techniques in the
1950s, the lymphocyte was identified as the cell type responsible for both cellular and humoral immunity. Soon thereafter, experiments with chickens pioneered by Bruce Glick at
Mississippi State University indicated the existence of two
types of lymphocytes: T lymphocytes (T cells), derived from

was diagnosed in what was then the
remote outpost of Nome, Alaska. Lifesaving diphtheria-specific antibodies were
available in Anchorage, but no roads
were open and the weather was too dangerous for flight. History tells us that 20
mushers set up a dogsled relay to cover
the almost 700 miles between Nenana,
the end of the railroad run, and remote

Nome. In this relay, two Norwegians and
their dogs covered particularly critical territory and withstood blizzard conditions:
Leonhard Seppala (Figure 1, left), who
covered the most treacherous territory,
and Gunnar Kaasen, who drove the final
two legs in whiteout conditions, behind
his lead dog Balto. Kaasen and Balto
arrived in time to save many of the chil-

the thymus, and B lymphocytes (B cells), derived from the
bursa of Fabricius in birds (an outgrowth of the cloaca). In a
convenient twist of nomenclature that makes B and T cell
origins easier to remember, the mammalian equivalent of
the bursa of Fabricius is bone marrow, the home of developing B cells in mammals. We now know that cellular immunity
is imparted by T cells and that the antibodies produced by B
cells confer humoral immunity. The real controversy about
the roles of humoral versus cellular immunity was resolved
when the two systems were shown to be intertwined and it
became clear that both are necessary for a complete immune
response against most pathogens.

How Are Foreign Substances Recognized
by the Immune System?
One of the great enigmas confronting early immunologists
was what determines the specificity of the immune response

dren in the town. To commemorate this
heroic event, later that same year a statue
of Balto was placed in Central Park, New
York City, where it still stands today. This
journey is memorialized every year in the
running of the Iditarod sled dog race. A

for a particular foreign material, or antigen, the general
term for any substance that elicits a specific response by B
or T lymphocytes. Around 1900, Jules Bordet at the Pasteur Institute expanded the concept of immunity beyond
infectious diseases, demonstrating that nonpathogenic
substances, such as red blood cells from other species,
could also serve as antigens. Serum from an animal that
had been inoculated with noninfectious but otherwise
foreign (nonself) material would nevertheless react with
the injected material in a specific manner. The work of
Karl Landsteiner and those who followed him showed that
injecting an animal with almost any nonself organic chemical could induce production of antibodies that would bind
specifically to the chemical. These studies demonstrated
that antibodies have a capacity for an almost unlimited
range of reactivity, including responses to compounds
that had only recently been synthesized in the laboratory
and are otherwise not found in nature! In addition, it was

Introduction

shown that molecules differing in the smallest detail, such
as a single amino acid, could be distinguished by their
reactivity with different antibodies. Two major theories
were proposed to account for this specificity: the selective
theory and the instructional theory.
The earliest conception of the selective theory dates to
Paul Ehrlich in 1900. In an attempt to explain the origin
of serum antibody, Ehrlich proposed that cells in the
blood expressed a variety of receptors, which he called
side-chain receptors, that could bind to infectious agents
and inactivate them. Borrowing a concept used by Emil
Fischer in 1894 to explain the interaction between an
enzyme and its substrate, Ehrlich proposed that binding
of the receptor to an infectious agent was like the fit
between a lock and key. Ehrlich suggested that interaction
between an infectious agent and a cell-bound receptor
would induce the cell to produce and release more receptors with the same specificity (Figure 1-4). In Ehrlich’s
mind, the cells were pluripotent, expressing a number of

FIGURE 1-4 Representation of Paul Ehrlich’s side chain
theory to explain antibody formation. In Ehrlich’s initial theory,
the cell is pluripotent in that it expresses a number of different receptors or side chains, all with different specificities. If an antigen
encounters this cell and has a good fit with one of its side chains,
synthesis of that receptor is triggered and the receptor will be
released. [From Ehrlich’s Croonian lecture of 1900 to the Royal Society.]

different receptors, each of which could be individually
“selected.” According to Ehrlich’s theory, the specificity of
the receptor was determined in the host before its exposure to the foreign antigen, and therefore the antigen
selected the appropriate receptor. Ultimately, most aspects
of Ehrlich’s theory would be proven correct, with the following minor refinement: instead of one cell making
many receptors, each cell makes many copies of just one
membrane-bound receptor (one specificity). An army of
cells, each with a different antigen specificity, is therefore
required. The selected B cell can be triggered to proliferate
and to secrete many copies of these receptors in soluble form
(now called antibodies) once it has been selected by antigen
binding.
In the 1930s and 1940s, the selective theory was challenged by various instructional theories. These theories held
that antigen played a central role in determining the specificity of the antibody molecule. According to the instructional
theorists, a particular antigen would serve as a template
around which antibody would fold—sort of like an impression mold. The antibody molecule would thereby assume a
configuration complementary to that of the antigen template. This concept was first postulated by Friedrich Breinl
and Felix Haurowitz in about 1930 and redefined in the
1940s in terms of protein folding by Linus Pauling.
In the 1950s, selective theories resurfaced as a result of
new experimental data. Through the insights of F. Macfarlane Burnet, Niels Jerne, and David Talmadge, this model
was refined into a hypothesis that came to be known as the
clonal selection theory. This hypothesis has been further
refined and is now accepted as an underlying paradigm of
modern immunology. According to this theory, an individual B or T lymphocyte expresses many copies of a membrane
receptor that is specific for a single, distinct antigen. This
unique receptor specificity is determined in the lymphocyte
before it is exposed to the antigen. Binding of antigen to its
specific receptor activates the cell, causing it to proliferate
into a clone of daughter cells that have the same receptor
specificity as the parent cell. The instructional theories were
formally disproved in the 1960s, by which time information
was emerging about the structure of protein, RNA, and DNA
that would offer new insights into the vexing problem of how
an individual could make antibodies against almost anything, sight unseen.
Overview Figure 1-5 presents a very basic scheme of
clonal selection in the humoral (B cell) and cellular (T cell)
branches of immunity. We now know that B cells produce
antibodies, a soluble version of their receptor protein, which
bind to foreign proteins, flagging them for destruction. T cells,
which come in several different forms, also use their surfacebound T-cell receptors to sense antigen. These cells can
perform a range of different functions once selected by antigen encounter, including the secretion of soluble compounds
to aid other white blood cells (such as B lymphocytes) and
the destruction of infected host cells.

evolved to protect us against an enormous range of invaders
of all shapes, sizes, and chemical structures. In this section,
we cover the range of organisms that challenge the immune
system and several of the important new concepts that are
unique hallmarks of how the immune system carries out
this task.

Introduction

Pathogens Come in Many Forms and Must
First Breach Natural Barriers
Organisms causing disease are termed pathogens, and the
process by which they induce illness in the host is called
pathogenesis. The human pathogens can be grouped into
four major categories based on shared characteristics:
viruses, fungi, parasites, and bacteria (Table 1-3). Some
example organisms from each category can be found in
Figure 1-6. As we will see in the next section, some of the
shared characteristics that are common to groups of pathogens, but not to the host, can be exploited by the immune
system for recognition and destruction.
The microenvironment in which the immune response
begins to emerge can also influence the outcome; the same
pathogen may be treated differently depending on the context in which it is encountered. Some areas of the body, such
as the central nervous system, are virtually “off limits” for
the immune system because the immune response could do
more damage than the pathogen. In other cases, the environment may come with inherent directional cues for
immune cells. For instance, some foreign compounds that
enter via the digestive tract, including the commensal
microbes that help us digest food, are tolerated by the
immune system. However, when these same foreigners
enter the bloodstream they are typically treated much more
aggressively. Each encounter with pathogen thus engages a
distinct set of strategies that depends on the nature of the
invader and on the microenvironment in which engagement occurs.
It is worth noting that immune pathways do not become
engaged until foreign organisms first breach the physical
barriers of the body. Obvious barriers include the skin and

TABLE 1-3

/Volumes/203/MHR00209/siL52070/disk1of1/0071052070

the mucous membranes. The acidity of the stomach contents, of the vagina, and of perspiration poses a further barrier to many organisms, which are unable to grow in low pH
conditions. The importance of these barriers becomes obvious when they are surmounted. Animal bites can communicate rabies or tetanus, whereas insect puncture wounds can
transmit the causative agents of such diseases as malaria
(mosquitoes), plague (fleas), and Lyme disease (ticks). A
dramatic example is seen in burn victims, who lose the protective skin at the burn site and must be treated aggressively
with drugs to prevent the rampant bacterial and fungal
infections that often follow.

The Immune Response Quickly Becomes
Tailored to Suit the Assault
With the above in mind, an effective defense relies heavily on
the nature of the invading pathogen offense. The cells and
molecules that become activated in a given immune response
depend on the chemical structures present on the pathogen,
whether it resides inside or outside of host cells, and the
location of the response. This means that different chemical
structures and microenvironmental cues need to be detected
and appropriately evaluated, initiating the most effective
response strategy. The process of pathogen recognition involves
an interaction between the foreign organism and a recognition
molecule (or molecules) expressed by host cells. Although
these recognition molecules are frequently membranebound receptors, soluble receptors or secreted recognition
molecules can also be engaged. Ligands for these recognition
molecules can include whole pathogens, antigenic fragments
of pathogens, or products secreted by these foreign organisms. The outcome of this ligand binding is an intracellular

labeling and destruction of the pathogen—simply referred to
as the immune response. The entirety of this response is
actually engagement of a complex system of cells that can
recognize and kill or engulf a pathogen (cellular immunity),
as well as a myriad of soluble proteins that help to orchestrate labeling and destruction of foreign invaders (humoral
immunity).
The nature of the immune response will vary depending
on the number and type of recognition molecules engaged.

gens that spend the majority of their life cycle residing inside
host cells. An effective defense strategy must therefore
involve identification of infected host cells along with recognition of the surface of the pathogen. This means that some
immune cells must be capable of detecting changes that occur
in a host cell after it becomes infected. This is achieved by a
range of cytotoxic cells but especially cytotoxic T lymphocytes (aka CTLs, or Tc cells), a part of the cellular arm of
immunity. In this case, recognition molecules positioned
inside cells are key to the initial response. These intracellular
receptors bind to viral proteins present in the cytosol and

Introduction

initiate an early warning system, alerting the cell to the presence of an invader.
Sacrifice of virally infected cells often becomes the only
way to truly eradicate this type of pathogen. In general, this
sacrifice is for the good of the whole organism, although in
some instances it can cause disruptions to normal function.
For example, the Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV)
infects a type of T cell called a T helper cell (TH cell). These
cells are called helpers because they guide the behavior of
other immune cells, including B cells, and are therefore pivotal for selecting the pathway taken by the immune response.
Once too many of these cells are destroyed or otherwise rendered nonfunctional, many of the directional cues needed for
a healthy immune response are missing and fighting all types
of infections becomes problematic. As we discuss later in this
chapter, the resulting immunodeficiency allows opportunistic infections to take hold and potentially kill the patient.
Similar but distinct immune mechanisms are deployed to
mediate the discovery of extracellular pathogens, such as
fungi, most bacteria, and some parasites. These rely primarily on cell surface or soluble recognition molecules that
probe the extracellular spaces of the body. In this case, B cells
and the antibodies they produce as a part of humoral immunity play major roles. For instance, antibodies can squeeze
into spaces in the body where B cells themselves may not be
able to reach, helping to identify pathogens hiding in these
out-of-reach places. Large parasites present yet another problem; they are too big for phagocytic cells to envelop. In this
case, cells that can deposit toxic substances or that can
secrete products that induce expulsion (e.g., sneezing,
coughing, vomiting) become a better strategy.
As we study the complexities of the mammalian immune
response, it is worth remembering that a single solution does
not exist for all pathogens. At the same time, these various
immune pathways carry out their jobs with considerable
overlap in structure and in function.

Pathogen Recognition Molecules
Can Be Encoded in the Germline
or Randomly Generated
As one might imagine, most pathogens express at least a few
chemical structures that are not typically found in mammals.
Pathogen-associated molecular patterns (or PAMPs) are
common foreign structures that characterize whole groups of
pathogens. It is these unique antigenic structures that the
immune system frequently recognizes first. Animals, both
invertebrates and vertebrates, have evolved to express several
types of cell surface and soluble proteins that quickly recognize many of these PAMPs; a form of pathogen profiling.
For example, encapsulated bacteria possess a polysaccharide
coat with a unique chemical structure that is not found on
other bacterial or human cells. White blood cells naturally
express a variety of receptors, collectively referred to as pattern recognition receptors (PRRs), that specifically recognize
these sugar residues, as well as other common foreign struc-

tures. When PRRs detect these chemical structures, a cascade
of events labels the target pathogen for destruction. PPRs are
proteins encoded in the genomic DNA and are always
expressed by many different immune cells. These conserved,
germline-encoded recognition molecules are thus a first line of
defense for the quick detection of many of the typical chemical identifiers carried by the most common invaders.
A significant and powerful corollary to this is that it allows
early categorizing or profiling of the sort of pathogen of concern. This is key to the subsequent immune response routes
that will be followed, and therefore the fine tailoring of the
immune response as it develops. For example, viruses frequently expose unique chemical structures only during their
replication inside host cells. Many of these can be detected via
intracellular receptors that bind exposed chemical moieties
while still inside the host cell. This can trigger an immediate
antiviral response in the infected cell that blocks further virus
replication. At the same time, this initiates the secretion of
chemical warning signals sent to nearby cells to help them
guard against infection (a neighborhood watch system!). This
early categorizing happens via a subtle tracking system that
allows the immune response to make note of which recognition molecules were involved in the initial detection event
and relay that information to subsequent responding immune
cells, allowing the follow-up response to begin to focus attention on the likely type of assault underway.
Host-pathogen interactions are an ongoing arms race;
pathogens evolve to express unique structures that avoid host
detection, and the host germline-encoded recognition system
co-evolves to match these new challenges. However, because
pathogens generally have much shorter life cycles than their
vertebrate hosts, and some utilize error-prone DNA polymerases to replicate their genomes, pathogens can evolve rapidly to
evade host encoded recognition systems. If this were our only
defense, the host immune response would quickly become
obsolete thanks to these real-time pathogen avoidance strategies. How can the immune system prepare for this? How can our
DNA encode a recognition system for things that change in
random ways over time? Better yet, how do we build a system to
recognize new chemical structures that may arise in the future?
Thankfully, the vertebrate immune system has evolved a
clever, albeit resource intensive, response to this dilemma: to
favor randomness in the design of some recognition molecules. This strategy, called generation of diversity, is
employed only by developing B and T lymphocytes. The result
is a group of B and T cells where each expresses many copies of
one unique recognition molecule, resulting in a population
with the theoretical potential to respond to any antigen that
may come along (Figure 1-7). This feat is accomplished by
rearranging and editing the genomic DNA that encodes the
antigen receptors expressed by each B or T lymphocyte. Not
unlike the error-prone DNA replication method employed by
pathogens, this system allows chance to play a role in generating a menu of responding recognition molecules.
As one might imagine, however, this cutting and splicing of
chromosomes is not without risk. Many B and T cells do not

T and B lymphocytes. Maturation in T and B cells, which occurs in
primary lymphoid organs (bone marrow for B cells and thymus for
T cells) in the absence of antigen, produces cells with a committed
antigenic specificity, each of which expresses many copies of surface receptor that binds to one particular antigen. Different clones
of B cells (1, 2, 3, and 4) are illustrated in this figure. Cells that do not
die or become deleted during this maturation and weeding-out process move into the circulation of the body and are available to interact with antigen. There, clonal selection occurs when one of these cells

survive this DNA surgery or the quality control processes that
follow, all of which take place in primary lymphoid organs: the
thymus for T cells and bone marrow for B cells. Surviving cells
move into the circulation of the body, where they are available
if their specific, or cognate, antigen is encountered. When
antigens bind to the surface receptors on these cells, they trigger clonal selection (see Figure 1-7). The ensuing proliferation
of the selected clone of cells creates an army of cells, all with
the same receptor and responsible for binding more of the
same antigen, with the ultimate goal of destroying the pathogen in question. In B lymphocytes, these recognition molecules are B-cell receptors when they are surface structures
and antibodies in their secreted form. In T lymphocytes,
where no soluble form exists, they are T-cell receptors. In
1976 Susumu Tonegawa, then at The Basel Institute for Immunology in Switzerland, discovered the molecular mechanism
behind the DNA recombination events that generate B-cell
receptors and antibodies (Chapter 7 covers this in detail). This

encounters its cognate or specific antigen. Clonal proliferation of an
antigen-activated cell (number 2 or pink in this example) leads to
many cells that can engage with and destroy the antigen, plus
memory cells that can be called upon during a subsequent exposure.
The B cells secrete antibody, a soluble form of the receptor, reactive with the activating antigen. Similar processes take place in the
T-lymphocyte population, resulting in clones of memory T cells and
effector T cells; the latter include activated TH cells, which secrete
cytokines that aid in the further development of adaptive immunity,
and cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs), which can kill infected host cells.

was a true turning point in immunologic understanding; for
this discovery he received widespread recognition, including
the 1987 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine (see Table 1-2).

Tolerance Ensures That the Immune System
Avoids Destroying the Host
One consequence of generating random recognition receptors is that some could recognize and target the host. In
order for this strategy to work effectively, the immune system must somehow avoid accidentally recognizing and
destroying host tissues. This principle, which relies on self/
nonself discrimination, is called tolerance, another hallmark
of the immune response. The work credited with its illumination also resulted in a Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine, awarded to F. Macfarlane Burnet and Peter Medawar in
1960. Burnet was the first to propose that exposure to nonself antigens during certain stages of life could result in an

Introduction

immune system that ignored these antigens later. Medawar
later proved the validity of this theory by exposing mouse
embryos to foreign antigens and showing that these mice
developed the ability to tolerate these antigens later in life.
To establish tolerance, the antigen receptors present on
developing B and T cells must first pass a test of nonresponsiveness against host structures. This process, which begins
shortly after these randomly generated receptors are produced, is achieved by the destruction or inhibition of any
cells that have inadvertently generated receptors with the
ability to harm the host. Successful maintenance of tolerance
ensures that the host always knows the difference between self
and nonself (usually referred to as foreign).
One recent re-envisioning of how tolerance is operationally maintained is called the danger hypothesis. This hypothesis suggests that the immune system constantly evaluates
each new encounter more for its potential to be dangerous to
the host than for whether it is self or not. For instance, cell
death can have many causes, including natural homeostatic
processes, mechanical damage, or infection. The former is a
normal part of the everyday biological events in the body,
and only requires a cleanup response to remove debris. The
latter two, however, come with warning signs that include
the release of intracellular contents, expression of cellular
stress proteins, or pathogen-specific products. These pathogen or cell-associated stress compounds, sometimes referred
to as danger signals, can engage specific host recognition
molecules (e.g., PRRs) that deliver a signal to immune cells to
get involved during these unnatural causes of cellular death.
One unintended consequence of robust self-tolerance is
that the immune system frequently ignores cancerous cells
that arise in the body, as long as these cells continue to
express self structures that the immune system has been
trained to ignore. Dysfunctional tolerance is at the root of
most autoimmune diseases, discussed further at the end of
this chapter and in greater detail in Chapter 16. As one
might imagine, failures in the establishment or maintenance
of tolerance can have devastating clinical outcomes.

The Immune Response Is Composed of Two
Interconnected Arms: Innate Immunity
and Adaptive Immunity
Although reference is made to “the immune system,” it is
important to appreciate that there are really two interconnected systems of immunity: innate and adaptive. These two
systems collaborate to protect the body against foreign
invaders. Innate immunity includes built-in molecular and
cellular mechanisms that are encoded in the germline and
are evolutionarily more primitive, aimed at preventing infection or quickly eliminating common invaders (Chapter 5).
This includes physical and chemical barriers to infection, as
well as the DNA-encoded receptors recognizing common
chemical structures of many pathogens (see PRRs, above). In
this case, rapid recognition and phagocytosis or destruction
of the pathogen is the outcome. Innate immunity also
includes a series of preexisting serum proteins, collectively

referred to as complement, that bind common pathogenassociated structures and initiate a cascade of labeling and
destruction events (Chapter 6). This highly effective first line
of defense prevents most pathogens from taking hold, or
eliminates infectious agents within hours of encounter. The
recognition elements of the innate immune system are fast,
some occurring within seconds of a barrier breach, but they
are not very specific and are therefore unable to distinguish
between small differences in foreign antigens.
A second form of immunity, known as adaptive immunity, is much more attuned to subtle molecular differences.
This part of the system, which relies on B and T lymphocytes,
takes longer to come on board but is much more antigen
specific. Typically, there is an adaptive immune response
against a pathogen within 5 or 6 days after the barrier breach
and initial exposure, followed by a gradual resolution of the
infection. Adaptive immunity is slower partly because fewer
cells possess the perfect receptor for the job: the antigenspecific, randomly generated receptors found on B and T
cells. It is also slower because parts of the adaptive response
rely on prior encounter and “categorizing” of antigens undertaken by innate processes. After antigen encounter, T and B
lymphocytes undergo selection and proliferation, described
earlier in the clonal selection theory of antigen specificity.
Although slow to act, once these B and T cells have been
selected and have honed their attack strategy, they become
formidable opponents that can typically resolve the infection.
The adaptive arm of the immune response evolves in real
time in response to infection and adapts (thus the name) to
better recognize, eliminate, and remember the invading
pathogen. Adaptive responses involve a complex and interconnected system of cells and chemical signals that come
together to finish the job initiated during the innate immune
response. The goal of all vaccines against infectious disease
is to elicit the development of specific and long-lived adaptive responses, so that the vaccinated individual will be protected in the future when the real pathogen comes along.
This arm of immunity is orchestrated mainly via B and T
lymphocytes following engagement of their randomly generated antigen recognition receptors. How these receptors are
generated is a fascinating story, covered in detail in Chapter 7
of this book. An explanation of how these cells develop to
maturity (Chapters 9 and 10) and then work in the body to
protect us from infection (Chapters 11-14) or sometimes fail
us (Chapters 15-19) takes up the vast majority of this book.
The number of pages dedicated to discussing adaptive
responses should not give the impression that this arm of the
immune response is more important, or can work independently from, innate immunity. In fact, the full development of
the adaptive response is dependent upon earlier innate pathways. The intricacies of their interconnections remain an area
of intense study. The 2011 Nobel Prize in Physiology or
Medicine was awarded to three scientists who helped clarify
these two arms of the response: Bruce Beutler and Jules Hoffmann for discoveries related to the activation events important for innate immunity, and Ralph Steinman for his discovery
of the role of dendritic cells in activating adaptive immune

/Volumes/203/MHR00209/siL52070/disk1of1/0071052070

responses (see Table 1-2). Because innate pathways make first
contact with pathogens, the cells and molecules involved in
this arm of the response use information gathered from their
early encounter with pathogen to help direct the process of
adaptive immune development. Adaptive immunity thus provides a second and more comprehensive line of defense, informed
by the struggles undertaken by the innate system. It is worth
noting that some infections are, in fact, eliminated by innate
immune mechanisms alone, especially those that remain
localized and involve very low numbers of fairly benign foreign invaders. (Think of all those insect bites or splinters in
life that introduce bacteria under the skin!) Table 1-4 compares the major characteristics that distinguish innate and
adaptive immunity. Although for ease of discussion the
immune system is typically divided into these two arms of
the response, there is considerable overlap of the cells and
mechanisms involved in each of these arms of immunity.
For innate and adaptive immunity to work together, these
two systems must be able to communicate with one another.
This communication is achieved by both cell-cell contact
and by soluble messengers. Most of these soluble proteins
are growth factor–like molecules known by the general
name cytokines. Cytokines and cell surface ligands can bind
with receptors found on responding cells and signal these
cells to perform new functions, such as synthesis of other
soluble factors or differentiation to a new cell type. A subset
of these soluble signals are called chemokines because they
have chemotactic activity, meaning they can recruit specific
cells to the site. In this way, cytokines, chemokines, and
other soluble factors produced by immune cells recruit or
instruct cells and soluble proteins important for eradication
of the pathogen from within the infection site. We’ve probably all felt this convergence in the form of swelling, heat,
and tenderness at the site of exposure. These events are a part
of a larger process collectively referred to as an inflammatory
response, which is covered in detail in Chapter 15.

response to injected antigen reflect the phenomenon of
immunologic memory. When an animal is injected with an antigen, it produces a primary antibody response (dark blue) of low magnitude and short duration, peaking at about 10 to 20 days. At some
later point, a second exposure to the same antigen results in a secondary response that is greater in magnitude, peaks in less time (1–4 days),
and is more antigen specific than the primary response. Innate
responses, which have no memory element and occur each time an
antigen is encountered, are unchanged regardless of how frequently
this antigen has been encountered in the past (light blue).
memory. This is the ability of the immune system to respond
much more swiftly and with greater efficiency during a second exposure to the same pathogen. Unlike almost any other
biological system, the vertebrate immune response has
evolved not only the ability to learn from (adapt to) its
encounters with foreign antigen in real time but also the
ability to store this information for future use. During a first
encounter with foreign antigen, adaptive immunity undergoes what is termed a primary response, during which the
key lymphocytes that will be used to eradicate the pathogen
are clonally selected, honed, and enlisted to resolve the
infection. As mentioned above, these cells incorporate messages received from the innate players into their tailored
response to the specific pathogen.
All subsequent encounters with the same antigen or pathogen are referred to as the secondary response (Figure 1-8).

This very basic scheme shows the sequence of events that occurs
during an immune response, highlighting interactions between
innate and adaptive immunity. 1. Pathogens are introduced at a
mucosal surface or breach in skin (bacteria entering the throat, in this
case), where they are picked up by phagocytic cells (yellow). 2a. In this
innate stage of the response, the phagocytic cell undergoes changes
and carries pieces of bacteria to a local lymph node to help activate
adaptive immunity. 2b. Meanwhile, at the site of infection resident
phagocytes encountering antigen release chemokines and cytokines
(black dots) that cause fluid influx and help recruit other immune cells
to the site (inflammation). 3. In the lymph node, T (blue) and B (green)
cells with appropriate receptor specificity are clonally selected when

During a secondary response, memory cells, kin of the final
and most efficient B and T lymphocytes trained during the
primary response, are re-enlisted to fight again. These cells
begin almost immediately and pick up right where they left
off, continuing to learn and improve their eradication strategy
during each subsequent encounter with the same antigen.
Depending on the antigen in question, memory cells can
remain for decades after the conclusion of the primary
response. Memory lymphocytes provide the means for subsequent responses that are so rapid, antigen-specific, and effective that when the same pathogen infects the body a second
time, dispatch of the offending organism often occurs without
symptoms. It is the remarkable property of memory that prevents us from catching many diseases a second time. Immunologic memory harbored by residual B and T lymphocytes is
the foundation for vaccination, which uses crippled or killed
pathogens as a safe way to “educate” the immune system to
prepare it for later attacks by life-threatening pathogens.

their surface receptors bind antigen that has entered the system,
kicking off adaptive immunity. 4. Collaboration between T and B cells
and continued antigen encounter occurs in the lymph node, driving
lymphocyte proliferation and differentiation, generating cells that
can very specifically identify and eradicate the pathogen. For example: 5a. B cells secrete antibodies specific for the antigen, which travels to the site of infection to help label and eradicate the pathogen.
5b. In addition to the cells that will destroy the pathogen here,
memory T and B cells are generated in this primary response and
will be available at the initiation of a secondary response, which will
be much more rapid and antigen specific. (Abbreviations: T ⫽ T cell,
B ⫽ B cell, P = phagocyte; N = neutrophil, a type of immune cell.)

resolve an infection. In this example, bacteria breach the
mucosal lining of the throat, a skin or mucous barrier,
where it is recognized and engulfed by a local phagocytic
cell (step 1). As part of the innate immune system, the
phagocytic cell releases cytokines and chemokines that
attract other white blood cells to the site of infection, initiating inflammation (step 2b). That phagocytic cell may
then travel to a local lymph node, the tissue where antigen
and lymphocytes meet, carrying bacterial antigens to B and
T lymphocytes (step 2a). Those lymphocytes with receptors
that are specific for the antigen are selected, activated, and
begin the adaptive immune response by proliferating (step 3).
Activated TH cells help to activate B cells, and clonal
expansion of both types of lymphocyte occurs in the lymph
node (step 4). This results in many T and B cells specific for
the antigen, with the latter releasing antibodies that can
attach to the intruder and direct its destruction (step 5a).
The adaptive response leaves behind memory T and B cells
available for a future, secondary encounter with this antigen (step 5b). It is worth noting that memory is a unique

c01OverviewoftheImmuneSystem.indd Page 19 12/19/12 11:14 PM user-t044

Overview of the Immune System
capacity that arises from adaptive responses; there is no
memory component of innate immunity.
Sometimes, as is the case for some vaccines, one round of
antigen encounter and adaptation is not enough to impart
protective immunity from the pathogen in question. In
many of these cases, immunity can develop after a second or
even a third round of exposure to an antigen. It is these sorts
of pathogens that necessitate the use of vaccine booster
shots. Booster shots are nothing more than a second or third
episode of exposure to the antigen, each driving a new round
of adaptive events (secondary response) and refinements in
the responding lymphocyte population. The aim is to hone
these responses to a sufficient level to afford protection
against the real pathogen at some future date.

The Good, Bad, and Ugly
of the Immune System
The picture we’ve presented so far depicts the immune
response as a multicomponent interactive system that
always protects the host from invasion by all sorts of
pathogens. However, failures of this system do occur.
They can be dramatic and often garner a great deal of
attention, despite the fact that they are generally rare.
Certain clinical situations also pose unique challenges to
the immune system, including tissue transplants between
individuals (probably not part of any evolutionary plan!)
and the development of cancer. In this section we briefly
describe some examples of common failures and challenges to the development of healthy immune responses.
Each of these clinical manifestations is covered in much
greater detail in the concluding chapters of this book
(Chapters 15–19).

Inappropriate or Dysfunctional
Immune Responses Can Result
in a Range of Disorders
Most instances of immune dysfunction or failure fall into
one of the following three broad categories:

•

Hypersensitivity (including allergy): overly zealous
attacks on common benign but foreign antigens

•

Autoimmune Disease: erroneous targeting of selfproteins or tissues by immune cells

•

Immune Deficiency: insufficiency of the immune
response to protect against infectious agents

A brief overview of these situations and some examples of
each are presented below. At its most basic level, immune
dysfunction occurs as a result of improper regulation that
allows the immune system to either attack something it
shouldn’t or fail to attack something it should. Hypersensitivities, including allergy, and autoimmune disease are cases
of the former, where the immune system attacks an improper

target. As a result, the symptoms can manifest as pathological
inflammation—an influx of immune cells and molecules that
results in detrimental symptoms, including chronic inflammation and rampant tissue destruction. In contrast, immune
deficiencies, caused by a failure to properly deploy the
immune response, usually result in weakened or dysregulated immune responses that can allow pathogens to get the
upper hand.
This is a good time to mention that the healthy immune
response involves a balancing act between immune aggression and immune suppression pathways. While we rarely
fail to consider erroneous attacks (autoimmunity) or failures to engage (immune deficiency) as dysfunctional, we
sometimes forget to consider the significance of the suppressive side of the immune response. Imperfections in
the inhibitory arm of the immune response, present as a
check to balance all the immune attacks we constantly
initiate, can be equally profound. Healthy immune
responses must therefore be viewed as a delicate balance,
spending much of the time with one foot on the brakes
and one on the gas.
Hypersensitivity Reactions
Allergies and asthma are examples of hypersensitivity reactions. These result from inappropriate and overly active
immune responses to common innocuous environmental
antigens, such as pollen, food, or animal dander. The possibility that certain substances induce increased sensitivity
(hypersensitivity) rather than protection was recognized in
about 1902 by Charles Richet, who attempted to immunize
dogs against the toxins of a type of jellyfish. He and his colleague Paul Portier observed that dogs exposed to sublethal
doses of the toxin reacted almost instantly, and fatally, to a
later challenge with even minute amounts of the same
toxin. Richet concluded that a successful vaccination typically results in phylaxis (protection), whereas anaphylaxis
(anti-protection)—an extreme, rapid, and often lethal overreaction of the immune response to something it has
encountered before—can result in certain cases in which
exposure to antigen is repeated. Richet received the Nobel
Prize in 1913 for his discovery of the anaphylactic response
(see Table 1-2). The term is used today to describe a severe,
life-threatening, allergic response.
Fortunately, most hypersensitivity or allergic reactions in
humans are not rapidly fatal. There are several different types
of hypersensitivity reactions; some are caused by antibodies
and others are the result of T-cell activity (see Chapter 15).
However, most allergic or anaphylactic responses involve a
type of antibody called immunoglobulin E (IgE). Binding of
IgE to its specific antigen (allergen) induces the release of
substances that cause irritation and inflammation, or the
accumulation of cells and fluid at the site. When an allergic
individual is exposed to an allergen, symptoms may include
sneezing, wheezing (Figure 1-10), and difficulty in breathing
(asthma); dermatitis or skin eruptions (hives); and, in more
severe cases, strangulation due to constricted airways

Introduction

BOX 1-3

CLINICAL FOCUS

The Hygiene Hypothesis
Worldwide, 300 million people
suffer from asthma and approximately
250,000 people died from the disease in
2007 (see Chapter 15). As of 2009, in the
United States alone, approximately 1 in 12
people (8.2%) are diagnosed with asthma.
The most common reason for a trip to a
hospital emergency room (ER) is an
asthma attack, accounting for one-third of
all visits. In addition to those treated in the
ER, over 400,000 hospitalizations for
asthma occurred in the United States in
2006, with an average stay of 3 to 4 days.
In the past 25 years, the prevalence of
asthma in industrialized nations has doubled. This is coupled with an overall rise in
other types of allergic disease during the
same time frame. What accounts for this
climb in asthma and allergy in the last few
decades? One idea, called the hygiene
hypothesis, suggests that a decrease in
human exposure to environmental
microbes has had adverse effects on the
human immune system. The hypothesis
suggests that several categories of allergic
or inflammatory disease, all disorders
caused by excessive immune activation,
have become more prevalent in industrialized nations thanks to diminished exposure to particular classes of microbes
following the widespread use of antibiotics, immunization programs, and overall
hygienic practices in those countries. This
idea was first proposed by D. P. Strachan
and colleagues in an article published in
1989 suggesting a link between hay fever
and household hygiene. More recently, this
hypothesis has been expanded to include
the view by some that it may be a contributing factor in many allergic diseases, several autoimmune disorders, and, more
recently, inflammatory bowel disease.
What is the evidence supporting the
hygiene hypothesis? The primary clinical
support comes from studies that have
shown a positive correlation between
growing up under environmental conditions that favor microbe-rich (sometimes

called “dirty”) environments and a decreased
incidence of allergy, especially asthma. To
date, childhood exposure to cowsheds and
farm animals, having several older siblings,
attending day care early in life, or growing
up in a developing nation have all been
correlated with a decreased likelihood of
developing allergies later in life. While viral
exposures during childhood do not seem
to favor protection, exposure to certain
classes of bacteria and parasitic organisms
may. Of late, the primary focus of attention
has been on specific classes of parasitic
worms (called helminthes), spawning New
Age allergy therapies involving intentional
exposure. This gives whole new meaning to
the phrase “Go eat worms”!
What are the proposed immunologic
mechanisms that might underlie this link
between a lack of early-life microbial
exposure and allergic disease? Current
dogma supporting this hypothesis posits
that millions of years of coevolution of
microbes and humans has favored a system in which early exposure to a broad
range of common environmental bugs
helps set the immune system on a path of
homeostatic balance between aggression
and inhibition. Proponents of this immune
regulation argument, sometimes referred
to as the “old friends” hypothesis, suggest
that antigens present on microbial organisms that have played a longstanding role
in our evolutionary history (both pathogens and harmless microbes we ingest or
that make up our historical flora) may
engage with the pattern recognition
receptors (PPRs) present on cells of our
innate immune system, driving them to
warn cells involved in adaptive responses
to tone it down. This hypothesis posits
that without early and regular exposure of
our immune cells to these old friends and
their antigens, the development of “normal” immune regulatory or homeostatic
responses is thrown into disarray, setting
us up for an immune system poised to
overreact in the future.

Animal models of disease lend some
support to this hypothesis and have
helped immunologists probe this line of
thinking. For instance, certain animals
raised in partially or totally pathogen-free
environments are more prone to type 1,
or insulin-dependent, diabetes, an autoimmune disease caused by immune
attack of pancreatic cells (see Chapter 16).
The lower the infectious burden of exposure in these mice, the greater the incidence of diabetes. Animals specifically
bred to carry enhanced genetic susceptibility favoring spontaneous development
of diabetes (called NOD mice, for nonobese diabetic) and treated with a variety
of infectious agents can be protected
from diabetes. Meanwhile, NOD mice
maintained in pathogen-free housing
almost uniformly develop diabetes. Much
like this experimental model, susceptibility to asthma and most other allergies is
known to run in families. Although all the
genes linked to asthma have not yet been
characterized, it is known that you have a
30% chance of developing the disease if
one of your parents is a sufferer, and a 70%
chance if both parents have asthma. While
the jury may still be out concerning the
verdict behind the hygiene hypothesis,
animal and human studies clearly point to
strong roles for both genes and environment in susceptibility to allergy. As data in
support of this hypothesis continue to
grow, the old saying concerning a dirty
child—that “It’s good for their immune
system”—may actually hold true!

following extreme inflammation. A significant fraction of
our health resources is expended to care for those suffering
from allergies and asthma. One particularly interesting
rationale to explain the unexpected rise in allergic disease is
called the hygiene hypothesis and is discussed in the Clinical
Focus on page 20.
Autoimmune Disease
Sometimes the immune system malfunctions and a breakdown in self-tolerance occurs. This could be caused by a
sudden inability to distinguish between self and nonself or
by a misinterpretation of a self-component as dangerous,
causing an immune attack on host tissues. This condition,
called autoimmunity, can result in a number of chronic
debilitating diseases. The symptoms of autoimmunity differ,
depending on which tissues or organs are under attack. For
example, multiple sclerosis is due to an autoimmune attack
on a protein in nerve sheaths in the brain and central nervous system that results in neuromuscular dysfunction.
Crohn’s disease is an attack on intestinal tissues that leads to
destruction of gut epithelia and poor absorption of food.
One of the most common autoimmune disorders, rheumatoid arthritis, results from an immune attack on joints of the
hands, feet, arms, and legs.
Both genetic and environmental factors are likely involved
in the development of most autoimmune diseases. However,
the exact combination of genes and environmental exposures that favor the development of a particular autoimmune
disease are difficult to pin down, and constitute very active
areas of immunologic research. Recent discoveries in these
areas and the search for improved treatments are all covered
in greater detail in Chapter 16.

CHAPTER 1

Immune Deficiency
In most cases, when a component of innate or adaptive
immunity is absent or defective, the host suffers from some
form of immunodeficiency. Some of these deficiencies produce major clinical effects, including death, while others are
more minor or even difficult to detect. Immune deficiency
can arise due to inherited genetic factors (called primary
immunodeficiencies) or as a result of disruption/damage by
chemical, physical, or biological agents (termed secondary
immunodeficiencies). Both of these forms of immune deficiency are discussed in greater detail in Chapter 18.
The severity of the disease resulting from immune deficiency depends on the number and type of affected immune
response components. A common type of primary immunodeficiency in North America is a selective immunodeficiency in which only one type of antibody, called
Immunoglobulin A is lacking; the symptoms may be an
increase in certain types of infections, or the deficiency may
even go unnoticed. In contrast, a more rare but much more
extreme deficiency, called severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID), affects both B and T cells and basically wipes
out adaptive immunity. When untreated, SCID frequently
results in death from infection at an early age.
By far, the most common form of secondary immunodeficiency is Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS),
resulting from infection with Human Immunodeficiency
Virus (HIV). As discussed further in Chapter 18, humans do
not effectively recognize and eradicate this virus. Instead, a
state of persistent infection occurs, with HIV hiding inside
the genomes of TH cells, its target cell type and the immune
cell type that is critical to guiding the direction of the adaptive immune response. As the immune attack on the virus
mounts, more and more of these TH cells are lost. When the
disease progresses to AIDS, so many TH cells have been
destroyed or otherwise rendered dysfunctional that a gradual collapse of the immune system occurs. It is estimated
that at the end of 2010, more than 34 million people worldwide suffered from this disease (for more current numbers,
see www.unaids.org), which if not treated can be fatal. For
patients with access, certain anti-retroviral treatments can
now prolong life with HIV almost indefinitely. However,
there is neither a vaccine nor a cure for this disease.
It is important to note that many pervasive pathogens in
our environment cause no problem for healthy individuals
thanks to the immunity that develops following initial exposure. However, individuals with primary or secondary deficiencies in immune function become highly susceptible to
disease caused by these ubiquitous microbes. For example,
the fungus Candida albicans, present nearly everywhere and
a nonissue for most individuals, can cause an irritating rash
and a spreading infection in the mucosal surface of the
mouth and vagina in patients suffering from immune deficiency (see Figure 1-6b). The resulting rash, called thrush,
can sometimes be the first sign of immune dysfunction (Figure 1-11). If left unchecked, C. albicans can spread, causing
systemic candidiasis, a life-threatening condition. Such

infections by ubiquitous microorganisms that cause no harm
in an immune competent host but which are often observed
only in cases of underlying immune deficiency, are termed
opportunistic infections. Several rarely seen opportunistic
infections identified in early AIDS patients were the first
signs that these patients had seriously compromised immune
systems, and helped scientists to identify the underlying
cause. Unchecked opportunistic infections are still the main
cause of death in AIDS patients.

The Immune Response Renders Tissue
Transplantation Challenging
Normally, when the immune system encounters foreign cells,
it responds strongly to rid the host of the presumed invader.
However, in the case of transplantation, these cells or tissues
from a donor may be the only possible treatment for lifethreatening disease. For example, it is estimated that more than
70,000 persons in the United States alone would benefit from a
kidney transplant. The fact that the immune system will attack
and reject any transplanted organ that is nonself, or not a
genetic match, raises a formidable barrier to this potentially
lifesaving treatment, presenting a particularly unique challenge
to clinicians who treat these patients. While the rejection of
this transplant by the recipient’s immune system may be seen
as a “failure,” in fact it is just a consequence of the immune
system functioning properly. Normal tolerance processes governing self/nonself discrimination and immune engagement
caused by danger signals (partially the result of the trauma
caused by surgical transplantation) lead to the rapid influx of

immune cells and coordinated attacks on the new resident
cells. Some of these transplant rejection responses can be suppressed using immune inhibitory drugs, but treatment with
these drugs also suppresses general immune function, leaving
the host susceptible to opportunistic infections.
Research related to transplantation studies has played a
major role in the development of the field of Immunology. A
Nobel Prize was awarded to Karl Landsteiner (mentioned
earlier for his contributions to the concept of immune specificity) in 1930 for the discovery of the human ABO blood
groups, a finding that allowed blood transfusions to be carried out safely. In 1980, G. Snell, J. Dausset, and B. Benacerraf
were recognized for discovery of the major histocompatibility
complex (MHC). These are the tissue antigens that differ
most between non-genetically identical individuals, and are
thus one of the primary targets of immune rejection of transplanted tissues. Finally, in 1991 E. D. Thomas and J. Murray
were awarded Nobel prizes for treatment advances that paved
the way for more clinically successful tissue transplants (see
Table 1-2). Development of procedures that would allow a
foreign organ or cells to be accepted without suppressing
immunity to all antigens still remains a major goal, and a
challenge, for immunologists today (see Chapter 16).

Cancer Presents a Unique Challenge
to the Immune Response
Cancer, or malignancy, occurs in host cells when they
begin to divide out of control. Since these cells are self in
origin, self-tolerance mechanisms can inhibit the development of an immune response, making the detection and
eradication of cancerous cells a continual challenge. That
said, it is clear that many tumor cells do express unique or
developmentally inappropriate proteins, making them
potential targets for immune cell recognition and elimination, as well as targets for therapeutic intervention. However, as with many microbial pathogens, the increased
genetic instability of these rapidly dividing cells gives them
an advantage in terms of evading immune detection and
elimination machinery.
We now know that the immune system actively participates in the detection and control of cancer in the body (see
Chapter 19). The number of malignant disorders that arise in
individuals with compromised immunity highlights the
degree to which the immune system normally controls the
development of cancer. Both innate and adaptive elements
have been shown to be involved in this process, although
adaptive immunity likely plays a more significant role. However, associations between inflammation and the development
of cancer, as well as the degree to which cancerous cells evolve
to become more aggressive and evasive under pressure from
the immune system, have demonstrated that the immune
response to cancer can have both healing and disease-inducing
characteristics. As the mechanics of these elements are
resolved in greater detail, there is hope that therapies can be
designed to boost or maximize the anti-tumor effects of

come a very long way in a fairly short time. Yet much still
remains to be learned about the mammalian immune
response and the ways in which this system interacts with

hope is that we will be better poised to design ways to modulate these immune pathways through intervention. This
would allow us to develop more effective prevention and
treatment strategies for cancer and other diseases that plague
society today, not to mention preparing us to respond
quickly to the new diseases or infectious agents that will
undoubtedly arise in the future.

Immunity is the state of protection against foreign pathogens or substances (antigens).
Vaccination is a means to prepare the immune system to
effectively eradicate an infectious agent before it can cause
disease, and its widespread use has saved many lives.
Humoral immunity involves combating pathogens via
antibodies, which are produced by B cells and can be found
in bodily fluids. Antibodies can be transferred between
individuals to provide passive immune protection.
Cell-mediated immunity involves primarily antigenspecific T lymphocytes, which act to eradicate pathogens
or otherwise aid other cells in inducing immunity.
Pathogens fall into four major categories and come in
many forms. The immune response quickly becomes tailored to the type of organism involved.
The immune response relies on recognition molecules that
can be germline encoded or randomly generated.
The process of self-tolerance ensures that the immune
system avoids destroying host tissue.
The vertebrate immune response can be divided into two
interconnected arms of immunity: innate and adaptive.
Innate responses are the first line of defense, utilizing
germline-encoded recognition molecules and phagocytic

cells. Innate immunity is faster but less specific than adaptive responses, which take several days but are highly
antigen specific.
Innate and adaptive immunity operate cooperatively; activation of the innate immune response produces signals that
stimulate and direct subsequent adaptive immune pathways.
Adaptive immunity relies upon surface receptors, called
B- and T-cell receptors, that are randomly generated by
DNA rearrangements in developing B and T cells.
Clonal selection is the process by which individual T and
B lymphocytes are engaged by antigen and cloned to create a population of antigen-reactive cells.
Memory cells are residual B and T cells that remain after
antigen exposure and that pick up where they left off during a subsequent, or secondary, response.
Dysfunctions of the immune system include common
maladies such as allergies, asthma, and autoimmune disease (overly active or misdirected immune responses) as
well as immune deficiency (insufficient immune responses).
Transplanted tissues and cancer present unique challenges to
clinicians, because the healthy immune system typically
rejects or destroys nonself proteins, such as those encountered
in most transplant situations, and tolerates self cells.

Cells, Organs, and
Microenvironments
of the Immune System

A

successful immune response to a pathogen
depends on finely choreographed interactions
among diverse cell types (see Figure 1-9):
innate immune cells that mount a first line of
defense against pathogen, antigen-presenting cells that
communicate the infection to lymphoid cells, which
coordinate the adaptive response and generate the
memory cells, which prevent future infections. The
coordination required for the development of a full
immune response is made possible by the specialized
anatomy and microanatomy of the immune system,
which is dispersed throughout the body and organizes
cells in time and space. Primary lymphoid organs—
including the bone marrow and the thymus—regulate
the development of immune cells from immature
precursors. Secondary lymphoid organs—including the
spleen, lymph nodes, and specialized sites in the gut and
other mucosal tissues—coordinate the encounter of
antigen with antigen-specific lymphocytes and their
development into effector and memory cells. Blood
vessels and lymphatic systems connect these organs,
uniting them into a functional whole.
Remarkably, all functionally specialized, mature blood
cells (red blood cells, granulocytes, macrophages,
dendritic cells, and lymphocytes) arise from a single cell
type, the hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) (Figure 2-1).
The process by which HSCs differentiate into mature
blood cells is called hematopoiesis. Two primary
lymphoid organs are responsible for the development of
stem cells into mature immune cells: the bone marrow,
where HSCs reside and give rise to all cell types; and the
thymus, where T cells complete their maturation. We will
begin this chapter by describing the structure and
function of each cell type that arises from HSCs, and the
structure and function of both the bone marrow and
thymus in the context of hematopoiesis and
thymopoiesis. We will then describe the secondary
lymphoid organs, where the immune response is
initiated. The lymph nodes and spleen will be featured,
but lymphoid tissue associated with mucosal layers will
also be discussed. Four focused discussions are also

stem cells, and finally, in an Evolution Box, we describe
some intriguing variations in the anatomy of the immune
system among our vertebrate relatives.

Cells of the Immune System
Stem cells are defined by two capacities: (1) the ability to
regenerate or “self-renew” and (2) the ability to differentiate
into all diverse cell types. Embryonic stem cells have the
capacity to generate every specialized cell type in an organism (in other words, they are pluripotent). Adult stem cells,
in contrast, have the capacity to give rise to the diverse cell
types that specify a particular tissue. Multiple adult organs
harbor stem cells (“adult stem cells”) that can give rise to
mature tissue-specific cells. The HSC is considered the paradigmatic adult stem cell because it can differentiate into all
the types of blood cells.

FIGURE 2-1 Hematopoiesis. Self-renewing hematopoietic stem cells give rise to lymphoid and myeloid progenitors. Most immune cells
mature in the bone marrow and then travel to peripheral organs via the blood. Some, including mast cells and macrophages, undergo further
maturation outside the bone marrow. T cells develop to maturity in the thymus.

Hematopoietic Stem Cells Have the Ability to
Differentiate into Many Types of Blood Cells
HSCs are rare—fewer than one HSC is present per 5  104
cells in the bone marrow—and their numbers are strictly controlled by a balance of cell division, death, and differentiation.
Under conditions where the immune system is not being
challenged by a pathogen (steady state or homeostatic conditions), most HSCs are quiescent. A small number divide,
generating daughter cells. Some daughter cells retain the

stem-cell characteristics of the mother cell—that is, they
remain self-renewing and able to give rise to all blood cell
types. Other daughter cells differentiate into progenitor cells
that lose their self-renewal capacity and become progressively
more committed to a particular blood cell lineage. As an
organism ages, the number of HSCs decreases, demonstrating that there are limits to an HSC’s self-renewal potential.
When there is an increased demand for hematopoiesis (e.g.,
during an infection or after chemotherapy), HSCs display an
enormous proliferative capacity. This can be demonstrated in

c02Cells,Organs,andMicroenvironmentsoftheImmuneSystem.indd Page 29 12/19/12 11:26 PM user-t044

Cells, Organs, and Microenvironments of the Immune System
mice whose hematopoietic systems have been completely
destroyed by a lethal dose of x-rays (950 rads). Such irradiated
mice die within 10 days unless they are infused with normal
bone marrow cells from a genetically identical mouse. Although
a normal mouse has 3  108 bone marrow cells, infusion of
only 104 to 105 bone marrow cells from a donor is sufficient to
completely restore the hematopoietic system, which demonstrates the enormous capacity of HSCs for self-renewal. Our
ability to identify and purify this tiny subpopulation has
improved considerably, and investigators can now theoretically
rescue irradiated animals with just a few purified stem cells,
which give rise to progenitors that proliferate rapidly and
populate the blood system relatively quickly.
Because of the rarity of HSCs and the challenges of culturing them in vitro, investigators initially found it very difficult
to identify and isolate HSCs. The Classic Experiment Box on

pages 29–31 describes experimental approaches that led to
successful enrichment of HSCs. Briefly, the first successful
efforts featured clever process-of-elimination strategies. Investigators reasoned that undifferentiated hematopoietic stem
cells would not express surface markers specific for mature
cells from the multiple blood lineages (“Lin” markers). They
used several approaches to eliminate cells in the bone marrow
that did express these markers (Lin cells) and then examined
the remaining (Lin) population for its potential to continually give rise to all blood cells over the long term. Lin cells
were, indeed, enriched for this potential. Other investigators
took advantage of two technological developments that revolutionized immunological research—monoclonal antibodies
and flow cytometry (see Chapter 20)—and identified surface
proteins, including CD34, Sca-1, and c-Kit, that distinguished
the rare hematopoietic stem cell population.

BOX 2-1

CLASSIC EXPERIMENT

Isolating Hematopoietic Stem Cells
By the 1960s researchers knew that
hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) existed
and were a rare population in the bone
marrow. However, they did not know what
distinguished them from the other millions
of cells that crowded the bone marrow. It
was clear that in order to fully understand
how these remarkable cells give rise to all
other blood cells, and in order to harness
this potential for clinical use, investigators
would have to find a way to isolate HSCs.
But how do you find something that is
very rare, whose only distinctive feature is
its function—its ability to give rise to all
blood cells? Investigators devised a variety of strategies that evolved rapidly with
every technological advance, particularly
with the advent of monoclonal antibodies
and flow cytometry.
Regardless of what method one uses to
try to isolate a cell, it is critically important to
have a reliable experimental assay that can
tell you that the cells that you have teased
out are, indeed, the ones you are looking
for. Fundamentally, in order to prove that
you have enriched or purified an HSC, you
have to show that it can proliferate and give
rise to all blood cell types in an animal over
the long term. Many of the assays that were
originally established to show this are still in
use. They include colony formation assays,

where the ability of individual cells to proliferate (and differentiate) is determined by
looking for evidence of cell division either in
vitro (on plates) or in vivo (in the spleens of
irradiated mice). However, the best evidence for successful isolation of HSCs is the
demonstration that they can restore the
blood cells and immune system of a lethally
irradiated animal, preventing its death. This
can be done for mouse stem cells by injecting stem cell candidates into irradiated
mice and determining if they confer survival and repopulate all blood cell types.
The development of a mouse model that
accepts human hematopoietic stem cells
(the SCID-hu (man) mouse model) has
greatly enhanced investigators’ ability to
verify the pluripotentiality of candidate
human stem cell populations.
In the 1970s investigators did not have
the ability to easily compare differences in
protein and gene expression among single cells, so they had to try to distinguish
cell types based on other physical and
structural features. It wasn’t until monoclonal antibodies were introduced into
research repertoires that investigators
could seriously consider purifying a stem
cell. Monoclonal antibodies (described in
Chapter 20) can be raised to virtually any
protein, lipid, or carbohydrate. Monoclo-

nal antibodies can, themselves, be covalently modified with gold particles,
enzymes, or fluorochromes in order to
visualize their binding by microscopy.
In the early 1980s, investigators reasoned
that HSCs were unlikely to express proteins
specific for mature blood cells. Using monoclonal antibodies raised against multiple
mature cells, they trapped and removed
them from bone marrow cell suspensions,
first via a process called panning, where the
heterogeneous pool of cells was incubated
with antibodies bound to a plastic and then
those cells that did not stick were dislodged
and poured off. The cells that did not stick
to the antibodies were, indeed, enriched (in
some cases by several thousandfold) in cells
with HSC potential. This negative selection
strategy against mature cell lineages continues to be useful and is now referred to as
“lineage or Lin” selection; cells enriched by
this method are referred to as “Lin.” The
panning process that yielded one of the first
images of cells that included human hematopoietic stem cells is shown in Figure 1.
Investigators also worked to identify
surface molecules that were specific to
hematopoietic stem cells, so that they
could positively select them from the diverse
bone marrow cell types. The first protein
that identified human HSCs, now known as

plastic plates coated with antibodies that could bind multiple different mature (“lineage positive”) blood cells. They waited 1 to 2 hours and then washed the
cells that did not stick (the immature, “lineage negative” blood cells) off the plate. Most cells—mature blood cells—did stick firmly to the plate. However, the
cells that did not stick were enriched for hematopoietic stem cells. This process led to the first image of human bone marrow cells enriched for hematopoietic

CD34, was identified with a monoclonal
antibody raised against a tumor of primitive
blood cell types (acute myeloid leukemia).
Although one can positively select cells
from a diverse population using the panning procedures described above (or by
using its more current variant where cells
are applied to columns of resin-bound
monoclonal antibodies or equivalents), the
flow cytometer provides the most efficient
way to pull out a rare population from a
diverse group of cells. This machine,
invented by the Herzenberg laboratory and
its interdisciplinary team of scholars and
inventors, has revolutionized immunology
and clinical medicine. In a nutshell, it is a
machine that allows one to identify, separate, and recover individual cells from a
diverse pool of cells on the basis of the profiles of proteins and/or genes they express.
Chapter 20 provides you with an under-the-

hood introduction to the remarkable technology. Briefly, cells from a heterogeneous
suspension are tagged with (“stained with”)
monoclonal antibodies (or other molecules)
that bind to distinct features and are coupled to distinct fluorochromes. These cells
flow single file in front of lasers that excite
the several fluorochromes, and the intensities of the multiple wavelengths given off by
each individual cell are recorded. Cells that
express specific antigens at desired levels
(e.g., showing evidence for expression of
CD34) can be physically separated from
other cells and recovered for further studies.
In the late 1980s, Irv Weissman and his
laboratories discovered that differences in
expression of the Thy protein (a T-cell
marker), and later the expression of Sca protein, differentiated mouse hematopoietic
stem cells from more mature cells. His laboratory combined both negative and positive

selection techniques to develop one of the
most efficient approaches for hematopoietic stem cell enrichment (Figure 2). As other
surface molecules were identified, the
approach was honed. Currently, HSCs are
most frequently identified by their Lin Sca1 c-Kit (“LSK”) phenotype. It has become
clear that even this subgroup, which represents less than 1% of bone marrow cells, is
phenotypically and functionally heterogeneous. Other surface markers, including
SLAM proteins, that can distinguish among
these subpopulations continue to be identified. The synergy between technical developments and experimental strategies will
undoubtedly continue so that, ultimately,
we will be able to unambiguously identify,
isolate, and manipulate what remains the
holy grail of HSC investigations: the longterm stem cell that can both self-renew and
give rise to all blood cell types.

on differentiated (mature) lineages but absent from the undifferentiated stem cells (S) and progenitor cells (P), followed by (2) retention (positive selection) of cells
within the resulting partly enriched preparation that bound to antibodies specific for Sca-1 and c-Kit, two early differentiation antigens. Cells that are enriched by
removal of differentiated cells are referred to as “lineage-minus” or Lin populations. Cells that are further enriched by positive selection according to Sca-1 and
c-Kit expression are referred to as LSK (for LinSca-1c-Kit) cells. M  monocyte; B  basophil; N  neutrophil; Eo  eosinophil; L  lymphocyte; E  erythrocyte.

occurs survive. Progressive enrichment of stem cells (from whole bone marrow, to Lin populations, to LSK populations) is indicated by the decrease in the number of injected cells needed to restore hematopoiesis. A total enrichment of about 1000-fold is possible by this procedure.

Introduction

Hematopoiesis Is the Process by Which
Hematopoietic Stem Cells Develop into
Mature Blood Cells
An HSC that is induced to differentiate (undergo hematopoiesis) loses its self-renewal capacity and makes one of two
broad lineage commitment choices (see Figure 2-1). It can
become a common myeloid-erythroid progenitor (CMP),
which gives rise to all red blood cells (the erythroid lineage), granulocytes, monocytes, and macrophages (the myeloid
lineage), or it can become a common lymphoid progenitor
(CLP), which gives rise to B lymphocytes, T lymphocytes,
and NK cells. Myeloid cells and NK cells are members of the
innate immune system, and are the first cells to respond to
infection or other insults. Lymphocytes are members of the
adaptive immune response and generate a refined antigenspecific immune response that also gives rise to immune
memory.
As HSCs progress along their chosen lineages, they lose
the capacity to contribute to other cellular lineages. Interestingly, both myeloid and lymphoid lineages give rise to dendritic cells, antigen-presenting cells with diverse features and
functions that play an important role in initiating adaptive
immune responses. The concentration and frequency of
immune cells in blood are listed in Table 2-1.
Regulation of Lineage Commitment
during Hematopoiesis
Each step a hematopoietic stem cell takes toward commitment
to a particular cellular lineage is accompanied by genetic
changes. Multiple genes that specify lineage commitment have
been identified. Many of these are transcriptional regulators.
For instance, the transcription factor GATA-2 is required for
the development of all hematopoietic lineages; in its absence
animals die during embryogenesis. Another transcriptional
regulator, Bmi-1, is required for the self-renewal capacity of
HSCs, and in its absence animals die within 2 months of birth
because of the failure to repopulate their red and white blood

cells. Ikaros and Notch are both families of transcriptional
regulators that have more specific effects on hematopoiesis.
Ikaros is required for lymphoid but not myeloid development; animals survive in its absence but cannot mount a full
immune response (i.e., they are severely immunocompromised). Notch1, one of four Notch family members, regulates
the choice between T and B lymphocyte lineages (see Chapter 9). More master regulators of lineage commitment during
hematopoiesis continue to be identified.
The rate of hematopoiesis, as well as the production and
release of specific cell lineages, is also responsive to environmental changes experienced by an organism. For instance,
infection can result in the release of cytokines that markedly
enhance the development of myeloid cells, including neutrophils. Investigators have also recently shown that the release
of mature cells from the bone marrow is responsive to circadian cycles and regulated by the sympathetic nervous system.
Distinguishing Blood Cells
Early investigators originally classified cells based on their
appearance under a microscope, often with the help of dyes.
Their observations were especially helpful in distinguishing
myeloid from lymphoid lineages, granulocytes from macrophages, neutrophils from basophils and eosinophils. Hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) stains are still commonly used in
combination to distinguish cell types in blood smears and
tissues. They highlight intracellular differences because of
their pH sensitivity and different affinities for charged macromolecules in a cell. Thus, the basic dye hematoxylin binds
basophilic nucleic acids, staining them blue, and the acidic
dye eosin binds eosinophilic proteins in granules and cytoplasm, staining them pink.
Microscopists drew astute inferences about cell function
by detailed examination of the structure stained cells, as well
as the behavior of live cells in solution. The advent of the flow
cytometer in the 1980s revolutionized our understanding of
cell subtypes by allowing us to evaluate multiple surface and
internal proteins expressed by individual cells simultaneously. The development of ever more sophisticated fluorescent microscopy approaches to observe live cells in vitro and
in vivo have allowed investigators to penetrate the complexities of the immune response in time and space. These
advances coupled with abilities to manipulate cell function
genetically have also revealed a remarkable diversity of cell
types among myeloid and lymphoid cells, and continue to
expose new functions and unexpected relationships among
hematopoietic cells. Therefore, while our understanding of
the cell subtypes is impressive, it is by no means complete.

Cells of the Myeloid Lineage Are the
First Responders to Infection
Cells that arise from a common myeloid progenitor (CMP)
include red blood cells (erythroid cells) as well as various
types of white blood cells (myeloid cells such as granulocytes,
monocytes, macrophages, and some dendritic cells). Myeloid

c02Cells,Organs,andMicroenvironmentsoftheImmuneSystem.indd Page 33 12/19/12 11:26 PM user-t044

Cells, Organs, and Microenvironments of the Immune System
cells are the first to respond to the invasion of a pathogen and
communicate the presence of an insult to cells of the lymphoid lineage (below). As we will see in Chapter 15, they also
contribute to inflammatory diseases (asthma and allergy).
Granulocytes
Granulocytes are at the front lines of attack during an immune
response and are considered part of the innate immune system.
Granulocytes are white blood cells (leukocytes) that are classified as neutrophils, basophils, mast cells, or eosinophils on the
basis of differences in cellular morphology and the staining of
their characteristic cytoplasmic granules (Figure 2-2). All
granulocytes have multilobed nuclei that make them visually
distinctive and easily distinguishable from lymphocytes, whose
nuclei are round. The cytoplasm of all granulocytes is replete
with granules that are released in response to contact with
pathogens. These granules contain a variety of proteins with
distinct functions: Some damage pathogens directly; some
regulate trafficking and activity of other white blood cells,
including lymphocytes; and some contribute to the remodeling
of tissues at the site of infection. See Table 2-2 for a partial list
of granule proteins and their functions.
Neutrophils constitute the majority (50% to 70%) of circulating leukocytes (see Figure 2-2a) and are much more
numerous than eosinophils (1%–3%), basophils (1%), or
mast cells (1%). After differentiation in the bone marrow,
neutrophils are released into the peripheral blood and circulate for 7 to 10 hours before migrating into the tissues, where
they have a life span of only a few days. In response to many
types of infections, the number of circulating neutrophils
increases significantly and more are recruited to tissues, partially in response to cues the bone marrow receives to produce and release more myeloid cells. The resulting transient
increase in the number of circulating neutrophils, called
leukocytosis, is used medically as an indication of infection.
Neutrophils are recruited to the site of infection in response
to inflammatory molecules (e.g., chemokines) generated by
innate cells (including other neutrophils) that have engaged a
pathogen. Once in tissues, neutrophils phagocytose (engulf)
bacteria very effectively, and also secrete a range of proteins
that have antimicrobial effects and tissue remodeling potential. Neutrophils are the dominant first responders to infection
and the main cellular components of pus, where they accumulate at the end of their short lives. Although once considered a
simple and “disposable” effector cell, the neutrophil has
recently inspired renewed interest from investigations indicating that it may also regulate the adaptive immune response.
Basophils are nonphagocytic granulocytes (see Figure 2-2b)
that contain large granules filled with basophilic proteins
(i.e., they stain blue in standard H&E staining protocols).
Basophils are relatively rare in the circulation, but can be
very potent. In response to binding of circulating antibodies,
basophils release the contents of their granules. Histamine,
one of the best known proteins in basophilic granules,
increases blood vessel permeability and smooth muscle
activity. Basophils (and eosinophils, below) are critical to

our response to parasites, particularly helminths (worms),
but in areas where worm infection is less prevalent, histamines are best appreciated as the cause of allergy symptoms.
Like neutrophils, basophils may also secrete cytokines that
modulate the adaptive immune response.
Mast cells (see Figure 2-2c) are released from the bone
marrow into the blood as undifferentiated cells; they mature
only after they leave the blood. Mast cells can be found in a
wide variety of tissues, including the skin, connective tissues
of various organs, and mucosal epithelial tissue of the respiratory, genitourinary, and digestive tracts. Like circulating
basophils, these cells have large numbers of cytoplasmic
granules that contain histamine and other pharmacologically active substances. Mast cells also play an important role
in the development of allergies.
Basophils and mast cells share many features and their
relationship is not unequivocally understood. Some speculate
that basophils are the blood-borne version of mast cells; others speculate that they have distinct origins and functions.
Eosinophils, like neutrophils, are motile phagocytic cells
(see Figure 2-2d) that can migrate from the blood into the
tissue spaces. Their phagocytic role is significantly less
important than that of neutrophils, and it is thought that
they play their most important role in the defense against
multicellular parasitic organisms, including worms. They
can be found clustering around invading worms, whose
membranes are damaged by the activity of proteins released
from eosinophilic granules. Like neutrophils and basophils,
eosinophils may also secrete cytokines that regulate B and T
lymphocytes, thereby influencing the adaptive immune
response. In areas where parasites are less of a health problem, eosinophils are better appreciated as contributors to
asthma and allergy symptoms.
Myeloid Antigen-Presenting Cells
Myeloid progenitors also give rise to a group of phagocytic
cells (monocytes, macrophages, and dendritic cells) that
have professional antigen-presenting cell (APC) function
(Figure 2-3). Myeloid APCs are considered cellular bridges
between the innate and adaptive immune systems because
they make contact with a pathogen at the site of infection
and communicate this encounter to T lymphocytes in the
lymph node (“antigen presentation”). Each APC can respond
to pathogens and secrete proteins that attract and activate
other immune cells. Each can ingest pathogens via phagocytosis, digest pathogenic proteins into peptides, then present
these peptide antigens on their membrane surfaces. Each
can be induced to express a set of costimulatory molecules
required for optimal activation of T lymphocytes. However,
it is likely that each plays a distinct role during the immune
response, depending on its locale and its ability to respond
to pathogens. Dendritic cells, in particular, play a primary
role in presenting antigen to—and activating—naïve T cells.
Macrophages and neutrophils are especially efficient in
removing both pathogen and damaged host cells, and can
provide a first line of defense against pathogens.

Monocytes make up about 5% to 10% of white blood cells
and are a heterogeneous group of cells that migrate into tissues and differentiate into a diverse array of tissue-resident
phagocytic cells, including macrophages and dendritic cells
(see Figure 2-3a). During hematopoiesis in the bone marrow,
granulocyte-monocyte progenitor cells differentiate into promonocytes, which leave the bone marrow and enter the
blood, where they further differentiate into mature monocytes. Two broad categories of monocytes have recently been
identified. Inflammatory monocytes enter tissues quickly in
response to infection. Patrolling monocytes, a smaller group
of cells that crawl slowly along blood vessels, provide a reservoir for tissue-resident monocytes in the absence of infection,
and may quell rather than initiate immune responses.
Monocytes that migrate into tissues in response to infection can differentiate into specific tissue macrophages. Like
monocytes, macrophages can play several different roles.
Some macrophages are long-term residents in tissues and
play an important role in regulating their repair and regeneration. Other macrophages participate in the innate
immune response and undergo a number of key changes
when they are stimulated by encounters with pathogens or
tissue damage. These are referred to as inflammatory macrophages and play a dual role in the immune system as effective
phagocytes that can contribute to the clearance of pathogens
from a tissue, as well as antigen-presenting cells that can
activate T lymphocytes. Osteoclasts in the bone, microglial
cells in the central nervous system, and alveolar macrophages in the lung are tissue-specific examples of macrophages with these properties.
Activated, inflammatory macrophages are more effective
than resting ones in eliminating potential pathogens for several reasons: They exhibit greater phagocytic activity, an
increased ability to kill ingested microbes, increased secretion of inflammatory and cytotoxic mediators, and the abil-

ity to activate T cells. More will be said about the
antimicrobial activities of macrophages in Chapter 5. Activated macrophages also function more effectively as antigenpresenting cells for helper T cells (TH cells), which, in turn
regulate and enhance macrophage activity. Thus, macrophages and TH cells facilitate each other’s activation during
the immune response.
Many macrophages also express receptors for certain
classes of antibody. If an antigen (e.g., a bacterium) is coated
with the appropriate antibody, the complex of antigen and
antibody binds to antibody receptors on the macrophage
membrane more readily than antigen alone and phagocytosis
is enhanced. In one study, for example, the rate of phagocytosis of an antigen was 4000-fold higher in the presence of
specific antibody to the antigen than in its absence. Thus, an
antibody is an example of an opsonin, a molecule that binds
an antigen marking it for recognition by immune cells. The
modification of particulate antigens with opsonins (which
come in a variety of forms) is called opsonization, a term
from the Greek that literally means “to supply food” or “make
tasty.” Opsonization is traditionally described as a process
that enhances phagocytosis of an antigen, but it serves multiple purposes that will be discussed in subsequent chapters.
Although most of the antigen ingested by macrophages is
degraded and eliminated, early experiments with radiolabeled
antigens demonstrated the presence of antigen peptides on the
macrophage membrane. Although the macrophage is a very
capable antigen-presenting cell, the dendritic cell is considered
the most efficient activator of naïve T cells.
The discovery of the dendritic cell (DC) by Ralph Steinman in the mid 1970s resulted in awarding of the Nobel Prize
in 2011. Dendritic cells are critical for the initiation of the
immune response and acquired their name because they are
covered with long membranous extensions that resemble the
dendrites of nerve cells and extend and retract dynamically,

Cells, Organs, and Microenvironments of the Immune System
increasing the surface area available for browsing lymphocytes. They are more diverse a population of cells than once
was thought, and seem to arise from both the myeloid and
lymphoid lineages of hematopoietic cells. The functional
distinctions among these diverse cells are still being clarified
and are likely critically important in tailoring immune
responses to distinct pathogens and targeting responding
cells to distinct tissues.
Dendritic cells perform the distinct functions of antigen
capture in one location and antigen presentation in another.
Outside lymph nodes, immature forms of these cells monitor the body for signs of invasion by pathogens and capture
intruding or foreign antigens. They process these antigens,
then migrate to lymph nodes, where they present the antigen
to naïve T cells, initiating the adaptive immune response.
When acting as sentinels in the periphery, immature dendritic cells take on their cargo of antigen in three ways. They
engulf it by phagocytosis, internalize it by receptor-mediated
endocytosis, or imbibe it by pinocytosis. Indeed, immature
dendritic cells pinocytose fluid volumes of 1000 to 1500 m3
per hour, a volume that rivals that of the cell itself. Through
a process of maturation, they shift from an antigen-capturing
phenotype to one that is specialized for presentation of
antigen to T cells. In making the transition, some attributes
are lost and others are gained. Lost is the capacity for phagocytosis and large-scale pinocytosis. However, the ability to
present antigen increases significantly, as does the expression
of costimulatory molecules that are essential for the activation of naïve T cells. After activation, dendritic cells abandon
residency in peripheral tissues, enter the blood or lymphatic
circulation, and migrate to regions of the lymphoid organs,
where T cells reside, and present antigen.
It is important to note that, although they share a name,
follicular dendritic cells do not arise in bone marrow and
have completely different functions from those described for
the dendritic cells discussed above. Follicular dendritic cells
do not function as antigen-presenting cells for TH-cell activation. These dendritic cells were named for their exclusive
location in organized structures of the lymph node called
lymph follicles, which are rich in B cells. As discussed in
Chapters 12 and 14, the interaction of B cells with follicular
dendritic cells is an important step in the maturation and
diversification of B cells.
It is clear that myeloid cells are not the only cells that can
present antigen efficiently. As mentioned above, lymphoidderived dendritic cells are fully capable APCs. In addition,
activated B lymphocytes can act as professional antigenpresenting cells. B cells can internalize antigen very efficiently via their antigen-specific receptor, and can process
and present antigenic peptides at the cell surface. Activated
B cells also express the full complement of costimulatory
molecules that are required to activate T cells. By presenting
antigen directly to T cells, B cells efficiently solicit help, in
the form of cytokines, that induces their differentiation into
memory cells, as well as into antibody-producing cells
(plasma cells).

CHAPTER 2

Erythroid Cells
Cells of the erythroid lineage—erythrocytes, or red blood
cells—also arise from a common myeloid precursor (sometimes referred to as a common myeloid-erythroid precursor). They contain high concentrations of hemoglobin, and
circulate through blood vessels and capillaries delivering
oxygen to surrounding cells and tissues. Damaged red blood
cells can also release signals (free radicals) that induce innate
immune activity. In mammals, erythrocytes are anuclear;
their nucleated precursors (erythroblasts) extrude their
nuclei in the bone marrow. However, the erythrocytes of
almost all nonmammalian vertebrates (birds, fish, amphibians, and reptiles) retain their nuclei. Erythrocyte size and
shape vary considerably across the animal kingdom—the
largest red blood cells can be found among some amphibians, and the smallest among some deer species.
Megakaryocytes
Megakaryocytes are large myeloid cells that reside in the
bone marrow and give rise to thousands of platelets, very
small cells (or cell fragments) that circulate in the blood and
participate in the formation of blood clots. Although platelets have some of the properties of independent cells, they do
not have their own nuclei.

Cells of the Lymphoid Lineage Regulate
the Adaptive Immune Response
Lymphocytes (Figure 2-4) are the principal cell players in the
adaptive immune response. They represent 20% to 40% of
circulating white blood cells and 99% of cells in the lymph.
Lymphocytes can be broadly subdivided into three major
populations on the basis of functional and phenotypic differences: B lymphocytes (B cells), T lymphocytes (T cells), and
natural killer (NK) cells. In humans, approximately a trillion
(1012) lymphocytes circulate continuously through the blood
and lymph and migrate into the tissue spaces and lymphoid
organs. We briefly review the general characteristics and
functions of each lymphocyte group and its subsets below.
Lymphocytes are relatively nondescript cells that are very
difficult to distinguish morphologically. T and B cells, in
particular, appear identical under a microscope. We therefore rely heavily on the signature of surface proteins they
express to differentiate among lymphocyte subpopulations.
Surface proteins expressed by immune cells are often
referred to by the cluster of differentiation (CD or cluster of
designation) nomenclature. This nomenclature was established
in 1982 by an international group of investigators who recognized that many of the new antibodies produced by laboratories all over the world (largely in response to the advent of
monoclonal antibody technology) were seeing the same proteins. They therefore defined clusters of antibodies that
appeared to be seeing the same protein and assigned a name—
a cluster of differentiation or CD—to each group. Although
originally designed to categorize the multiple antibodies, the

the typical morphology of the cells indicated accompany each

CD nomenclature is now firmly associated with specific surface proteins found on cells of many types. Table 2-3 lists some
common CD molecules found on human and mouse lymphocytes. Note that the shift from use of a “common” name to the
more standard “CD” name can take place slowly. (For example,
investigators often still refer to the pan-T cell marker as “Thy1” rather than CD90, and the costimulatory molecules as “B7-1”
and “B7-2,” rather than CD80 and CD86.) Appendix 1 lists over
three hundred CD markers expressed by immune cells.
In addition to their CD surface signatures, each B or T
cell also expresses an antigen-specific receptor (the B cell
receptor (BCR) or the T cell receptor (TCR), respectively)
on its surface. Although the populations of B cells and T cells
express a remarkable diversity of antigen receptors (more
than a billion), all receptors on an individual cell’s surface
have identical structures and therefore have identical specificities for antigen. If a given lymphocyte divides to form two
daughter cells, both daughters bear antigen receptors with
antigen specificities identical to each other and to the parental cell from which they arose, and so will any descendants
they produce. The resulting population of lymphocytes, all
arising from the same founding lymphocyte, is a clone.

naïve lymphocyte; this is full of granules that are used to kill target
cells. (e) A branch diagram that depicts the basic relationship among

At any given moment, a human or a mouse will contain
tens of thousands, perhaps a hundred thousand, distinct
mature T- and B-cell clones, each distinguished by its own
unique and identical cohort of antigen receptors. Mature B
cells and T cells are ready to encounter antigen, but they are
considered naïve until they do so. Contact with antigen
induces naïve lymphocytes to proliferate and differentiate
into both effector cells and memory cells. Effector cells carry
out specific functions to combat the pathogen, while the
memory cells persist in the host, and upon rechallenge with
the same antigen mediate a response that is both quicker and
greater in magnitude. The first encounter with antigen is
termed a primary response, and the re-encounter a secondary response.
B Lymphocytes
The B lymphocyte (B cell) derived its letter designation
from its site of maturation, in the bursa of Fabricius in birds;
the name turned out to be apt, as bone marrow is its major
site of maturation in humans, mice, and many other mammals. Mature B cells are definitively distinguished from
other lymphocytes and all other cells by their synthesis and

display of the B-cell receptor (BCR), a membrane-bound
immunoglobulin (antibody) molecule that binds to antigen.
Each B cell expresses a surface antibody with a unique
specificity, and each of the approximately 1.5–3  105 molecules of surface antibody has identical binding sites for
antigen. B lymphocytes also can improve their ability to bind
antigen through a process known as somatic hypermutation
and can generate antibodies of several different functional
classes through a process known as class switching. Somatic
hypermutation and class switching are covered in detail in
Chapter 12.
Ultimately, activated B cells differentiate into effector
cells known as plasma cells (see Figure 2-4c). Plasma cells
lose expression of surface immunoglobulin and become
highly specialized for secretion of antibody. A single cell is
capable of secreting from a few hundred to more than a
thousand molecules of antibody per second. Plasma cells
do not divide and, although some long-lived populations
of plasma cells are found in bone marrow, many die within
1 or 2 weeks.

T Lymphocytes
T lymphocytes (T cells) derive their letter designation
from their site of maturation in the thymus. Like the B cell,
the T cell expresses a unique antigen-binding receptor called
the T-cell receptor. However, unlike membrane-bound antibodies on B cells, which can recognize soluble or particulate
antigen, T-cell receptors only recognize processed pieces of
antigen (typically peptides) bound to cell membrane proteins called major histocompatibility complex (MHC)
molecules. MHC molecules are genetically diverse glycoproteins found on cell membranes (their structure and function are covered in detail in Chapter 8). The ability of MHC
molecules to form complexes with antigen allows cells to
decorate their surfaces with internal (foreign and self) proteins, exposing them to browsing T cells. MHC comes in two
versions: class I MHC molecules, which are expressed by
nearly all nucleated cells of vertebrate species, and class II
MHC molecules, which are expressed by professional
antigen-presenting cells and a few other cell types during
inflammation.

Introduction

T lymphocytes are divided into two major cell types—T
helper (TH) cells and T cytotoxic (TC) cells—that can be
distinguished from one another by the presence of either
CD4 or CD8 membrane glycoproteins on their surfaces. T
cells displaying CD4 generally function as TH cells and recognize antigen in complex with MHC class II, whereas those
displaying CD8 generally function as TC cells and recognize
antigen in complex with MHC class I. The ratio of CD4 to
CD8 T cells is approximately 2:1 in normal mouse and
human peripheral blood. A change in this ratio is often an
indicator of immunodeficiency disease (e.g., HIV), autoimmune diseases, and other disorders.
Naïve CD8 T cells browse the surfaces of antigenpresenting cells with their T-cell receptors. If and when they
bind to an MHC-peptide complex, they become activated,
proliferate, and differentiate into an effector cell called a cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL). The CTL has a vital function in
monitoring the cells of the body and eliminating any cells
that display foreign antigen complexed with class I MHC,
such as virus-infected cells, tumor cells, and cells of a foreign
tissue graft. To proliferate and differentiate optimally, naïve
CD8 T cells also need help from mature CD4 T cells.
Naïve CD4 T cells also browse the surfaces of antigenpresenting cells with their T-cell receptors. If and when they
recognize an MHC-peptide complex, they can become activated and proliferate and differentiate into one of a variety of
effector T cell subsets (see Figure 2-4e). T helper type 1
(TH1) cells regulate the immune response to intracellular
pathogens, and T helper type 2 (TH2) cells regulate the
response to many extracellular pathogens. Two additional TH
cell subsets have been recently identified. T helper type 17
cells (TH17), so named because they secrete IL-17, play an
important role in cell-mediated immunity and may help the
defense against fungi. T follicular helper cells (TFH) play an
important role in humoral immunity and regulate B-cell
development in germinal centers. Which helper subtype
dominates a response depends largely on what type of pathogen (intracellular versus extracellular, viral, bacterial, fungal,
helminth) has infected an animal. Each of these CD4 T-cell
subtypes produces a different set of cytokines that enable or
“help” the activation of B cells, TC cells, macrophages, and
various other cells that participate in the immune response.
The network of cytokines that regulate and are produced by
these effector cells is described in detail in Chapter 11.
Another type of CD4 T cell, the regulatory T cell (TREG),
has the unique capacity to inhibit an immune response. These
cells can arise during maturation in the thymus from autoreactive cells (natural TREG), but also can be induced at the site of
an immune response in an antigen-dependent manner
(induced TREG). They are identified by the presence of CD4 and
CD25 on their surfaces, as well as the expression of the internal
transcription factor FoxP3. TREG cells are critical in helping us
to quell autoreactive responses that have not been avoided via
other mechanisms. In fact, mice depleted of TREG cells are
afflicted with a constellation of destructive self-reactive inflammatory reactions. However, TREG cells may also play a role in

limiting our normal T-cell response to a pathogen. CD4 and
CD8 T-cell subpopulations may be even more diverse than
currently described, and the field should expect identification
of additional functional subtypes in the future.
Natural Killer Cells
Natural killer (NK) cells are lymphoid cells that are closely
related to B and T cells. However, they do not express antigenspecific receptors and are considered part of the innate
immune system. They are distinguished by the expression of
a surface marker known as NK1.1, as well as the presence of
cytotoxic granules. Once referred to as “large granular lymphocytes” because of their appearance under a microscope,
NK cells constitute 5% to 10% of lymphocytes in human
peripheral blood. They are efficient cell killers and attack a
variety of abnormal cells, including some tumor cells and
some cells infected with virus. They distinguish cells that
should be killed from normal cells in a very clever way: by
“recognizing” the absence of MHC class I, which is expressed
by almost all normal cells, but is specifically down-regulated
by some tumors and in response to some viral infections.
How can cells recognize an absence? NK cells express a variety of receptors for self MHC class I that, when engaged,
inhibit their ability to kill other cells. When NK cells encounter cells that have lost their MHC class I, these receptors are
no longer engaged and can no longer inhibit the potent cytotoxic tendencies of the NK cell, which then releases its cytolytic granules and kills the abnormal target cell.
NK cells also express receptors for immunoglobulins and
can therefore decorate themselves with antibodies that bind
pathogens or proteins from pathogens on the surface of infected
cells. This allows an NK cell to make a connection with a variety
of target cells (independently of their MHC class I expression).
Once the antibodies bring the NK cell in contact with target
cells, the NK cell releases its granules and induces cell death.
The mechanism of NK-cell cytotoxicity, the focus of much current experimental study, is described further in Chapter 13.
NKT Cells
Another type of cell in the lymphoid lineage, NKT cells, have
received a great deal of recent attention and share features
with both conventional T lymphocytes and NK cells. Like T
cells, NKT cells have T-cell receptors (TCRs), and some
express CD4. Unlike most T cells, however, the TCRs of NKT
cells are not very diverse and recognize specific lipids and
glycolipids presented by a molecule related to MHC proteins
known as CD1. Like their innate immune relatives, NK cells,
NKT cells have antibody receptors, as well as other receptors
classically associated with NK cells. Activated NKT cells can
release cytotoxic granules that kill target cells, but they can
also release large quantities of cytokines that can both
enhance and suppress the immune response. They appear to
be involved in human asthma, but also may inhibit the development of autoimmunity and cancer. Understanding the
exact role of NKT cells in immunity is one research priority.

Cells, Organs, and Microenvironments of the Immune System

Primary Lymphoid Organs—Where
Immune Cells Develop
The ability of any stem cell to self-renew and differentiate
depends on the structural organization and cellular function
of specialized anatomic microenvironments known as stem
cell niches. These sequestered regions are typically populated by a supportive network of stromal cells. Stem cell
niche stromal cells express soluble and membrane-bound
proteins that regulate cell survival, proliferation, differentiation, and trafficking. The organs that have microenvironments that support the differentiation of hematopoietic stem
cells actually change over the course of embryonic development. However, by mid to late gestation, HSCs take up residence in the bone marrow, which remains the primary site
of hematopoiesis throughout adult life. The bone marrow
supports the maturation of all erythroid and myeloid cells
and, in humans and mice, the maturation of B lymphocytes
(as described in Chapter 10).
HSCs are also found in blood and may naturally recirculate between the bone marrow and other tissues. This observation has simplified the process used to transplant blood
cell progenitors from donors into patients who are deficient
(e.g., patients who have undergone chemotherapy). Whereas
once it was always necessary to aspirate bone marrow from
the donor—a painful process that requires anesthesia—it is
now sometimes possible to use enriched hematopoietic precursors from donor blood, which is much more easily
obtained (see the Clinical Focus Box 2-2 on pages 42–43).
Unlike B lymphocytes, T lymphocytes do not complete
their maturation in the bone marrow. T lymphocyte precursors need to leave the bone marrow and travel to the unique
microenvironments provided by the other primary lymphoid organ, the thymus, in order to develop into functional
cells. The structure and function of the thymus will be discussed below and in more detail in Chapter 9.

The Bone Marrow Provides Niches for
Hematopoietic Stem Cells to Self-Renew
and Differentiate into Myeloid Cells
and B Lymphocytes
The bone marrow is a primary lymphoid organ that supports self-renewal and differentiation of hematopoietic stem
cells (HSCs) into mature blood cells. Although all bones
contain marrow, the long bones (femur, humerus), hip bones
(ileum), and sternum tend to be the most active sites of
hematopoiesis. The bone marrow is not only responsible for
the development and replenishment of blood cells, but it is
also responsible for maintaining the pool of HSCs throughout the life of an adult vertebrate.
The adult bone marrow (Figure 2-5), the paradigmatic
adult stem cell niche, contains several cell types that coordinate HSC development, including (1) osteoblasts, versatile
cells that both generate bone and control the differentiation

/Volumes/203/MHR00209/siL52070/disk1of1/0071052070

of HSCs, (2) endothelial cells that line the blood vessels and
also regulate HSC differentiation, (3) reticular cells that send
processes connecting cells to bone and blood vessels, and,
unexpectedly, (4) sympathetic neurons, which can control the
release of hematopoietic cells from the bone marrow. A
microscopic cross-section reveals that the bone marrow is
tightly packed with stromal cells and hematopoietic cells at
every stage of differentiation. With age, however, fat cells
gradually replace 50% or more of the bone marrow compartment, and the efficiency of hematopoiesis decreases.
The choices that an HSC makes depend largely on the
environmental cues it receives. The bone marrow is packed
with hematopoietic cells at all stages of development, but it is
likely that the precursors of each myeloid and lymphoid subtype mature in distinct environmental micro-niches within
the bone marrow. Our understanding of the microenvironments within the bone marrow that support specific stages of
hematopoiesis is still developing. Evidence suggests, however,
that the endosteal niche (the area directly surrounding the
bone and in contact with bone-producing osteoblasts) and
the vascular niche (the area directly surrounding the blood
vessels and in contact with endothelial cells) play different
roles (see Figure 2-5c). The endosteal niche appears to be
occupied by quiescent HSCs in close association with osteoblasts that regulate stem cell proliferation. The vascular niche
appears to be occupied by HSCs that have been mobilized to
leave the endosteal niche to either differentiate or circulate. In
addition, the more differentiated a cell is, the farther it
appears to migrate from its supportive osteoblasts and the
closer it moves to the more central regions of the bone. For
example, the most immature B lymphocytes are found closest
to the endosteum and osteoblasts, while the more mature B
cells have moved into the more central sinuses of the bone
marrow that are richly served by blood vessels.
Finally, it is important to recognize that the bone marrow
is not only a site for lymphoid and myeloid development but
is also a site to which fully mature myeloid and lymphoid
cells can return. Mature antibody-secreting B cells (plasma
cells) may even take up long-term residence in the bone
marrow. Whole bone marrow transplants, therefore, do not
simply include stem cells but also include mature, functional
cells that can both help and hurt the transplant effort.

The Thymus Is a Primary Lymphoid Organ
Where T Cells Mature
T cell development is not complete until the cells undergo
selection in the thymus (Figure 2-6). The importance of the
thymus in T-cell development was not recognized until the
early 1960s, when J.F.A.P. Miller, an Australian biologist,
worked against the power of popular assumptions to advance
his idea that the thymus was something other than a graveyard for cells. It was an underappreciated organ, very large in
prepubescent animals, that was thought by some to be detrimental to an organism, and by others to be an evolutionary
dead-end. The cells that populated it—small, thin-rimmed,

Introduction

CLINICAL FOCUS

Stem Cells—Clinical Uses and Potential
Stem cell transplantation holds great
promise for the regeneration of diseased,
damaged, or defective tissue. Hematopoietic stem cells are already used to restore
hematopoietic function, and their use in
the clinic is described below. However,
rapid advances in stem cell research have
raised the possibility that other stem cell
types may soon be routinely employed
for replacement of a variety of cells and
tissues. Two properties of stem cells
underlie their utility and promise. They
have the capacity to give rise to lineages
of differentiated cells, and they are selfrenewing—each division of a stem cell
creates at least one stem cell. If stem cells
are classified according to their descent
and developmental potential, three levels
of stem cells can be recognized: pluripotent, multipotent, and unipotent.
Pluripotent stem cells can give rise to an
entire organism. A fertilized egg, the
zygote, is an example of such a cell. In
humans, the initial divisions of the zygote
and its descendants produce cells that are
also pluripotent. In fact, identical twins
develop when pluripotent cells separate
and develop into genetically identical
fetuses. Multipotent stem cells arise from
embryonic stem cells and can give rise to
a more limited range of cell types. Further
differentiation of multipotent stem cells
leads to the formation of unipotent stem
cells, which can generate only the same
cell type as themselves. (Note that “pluripotent” is often used to describe the hematopoietic stem cell. Within the context of
blood cell lineages this is arguably true;
however, it is probably strictly accurate to
call the HSC a multipotent stem cell.)
Pluripotent cells, called embryonic
stem cells, or simply ES cells, can be iso-

lated from early embryos, and for many
years it has been possible to grow mouse
ES cells as cell lines in the laboratory. Strikingly, these cells can be induced to generate many different types of cells. Mouse ES
cells have been shown to give rise to
muscle cells, nerve cells, liver cells, pancreatic cells, and hematopoietic cells.
Advances have made it possible to
grow lines of human pluripotent stem cells
and, most recently, to induce differentiated
human cells to become pluripotent stem
cells. These are developments of considerable importance to the understanding of
human development, and they also have
great therapeutic potential. In vitro studies
of the factors that determine or influence
the development of human pluripotent
stem cells along specific developmental
paths are providing considerable insight
into how cells differentiate into specialized
cell types. This research is driven in part by
the great potential for using pluripotent
stem cells to generate cells and tissues that
could replace diseased or damaged tissue.
Success in this endeavor would be a major
advance because transplantation medicine now depends entirely on donated
organs and tissues, yet the need far exceeds
the number of donations, and the need is
increasing. Success in deriving cells, tissues,
and organs from pluripotent stem cells
could provide skin replacement for burn
patients, heart muscle cells for those with
chronic heart disease, pancreatic islet cells
for patients with diabetes, and neurons for
the treatment of Parkinson’s disease or
Alzheimer’s disease.
The transplantation of HSCs is an
important therapy for patients whose
hematopoietic systems must be replaced.
It has three major applications:

featureless cells called thymocytes—looked dull and inactive. However, Miller proved that the thymus was the allimportant site for the maturation of T lymphocytes (see the
Classic Experiment Box 2-3 on pages 46–47).
T-cell precursors, which still retain the ability to give rise
to multiple hematopoietic cell types, travel via the blood
from the bone marrow to the thymus. Immature T cells,

•

Providing a functional immune system
to individuals with a genetically determined immunodeficiency, such as
severe combined immunodeficiency
(SCID).

•

Replacing a defective hematopoietic
system with a functional one to cure
patients with life-threatening nonmalignant genetic disorders in hematopoiesis, such as sickle-cell anemia or
thalassemia.

•

Restoring the hematopoietic system of
cancer patients after treatment with
doses of chemotherapeutic agents and
radiation. This approach is particularly
applicable to leukemias, including acute
myeloid leukemia, which can be cured
only by destroying the patient’s own
hematopoietic system—the source of
the leukemia cells. Clinicians also hope
that this approach can be used to facilitate treatment of solid tumors. Highdose radiation and cytotoxic regimens
can be much more effective at killing
solid tumors than therapies using more
conventional doses of cytotoxic agents;
however, they destroy the immune system, and stem cell transplantation
makes it possible to recover from such
drastic treatment.

Hematopoietic stem cells have extraordinary powers of regeneration. Experiments in mice indicate that as few as one
HSC can completely restore the erythroid
population and the immune system. In
humans, for instance, as little as 10% of a
donor’s total volume of bone marrow can
provide enough HSCs to completely
restore the recipient’s hematopoietic system. Once injected into a vein, HSCs enter
the circulation and find their own way to

known as thymocytes (thymus cells) because of their site of
maturation, pass through defined developmental stages in
specific thymic microenvironments as they mature into
functional T cells. The thymus is a specialized environment
where immature T cells generate unique antigen receptors
(T cell receptors, or TCRs) and are then selected on the basis
of their reactivity to self MHC-peptide complexes expressed

the bone marrow, where they begin the
process of engraftment. In addition, HSCs
can be preserved by freezing. This means
that hematopoietic cells can be “banked.”
After collection, the cells are treated with a
cryopreservative, frozen, and then stored
for later use. When needed, the frozen
preparation is thawed and infused into the
patient, where it reconstitutes the hematopoietic system. This cell-freezing technology even makes it possible for
individuals to store their own hematopoietic cells for transplantation to themselves
at a later time. Currently, this procedure is
used to allow cancer patients to donate
cells before undergoing chemotherapy
and radiation treatments, then later reconstitute their hematopoietic system using
their own cells.
Transplantation of stem cell populations may be autologous (the recipient is
also the donor), syngeneic (the donor is
genetically identical; i.e., an identical twin
of the recipient), or allogeneic (the donor
and recipient are not genetically identical). In any transplantation procedure,
genetic differences between donor and
recipient can lead to immune-based
rejection reactions. Aside from host rejection of transplanted tissue (host versus
graft), lymphocytes conveyed to the
recipient via the graft can attack the recipient’s tissues, thereby causing graftversus-host disease (GVHD), a
life-threatening affliction. In order to suppress rejection reactions, powerful immunosuppressive drugs must be used.
Unfortunately, these drugs have serious
side effects, and immunosuppression
increases the patient’s risk of infection and
susceptibility to tumors. Consequently,
HSC transplantation has the fewest complications when there is genetic identity
between donor and recipient.

At one time, bone marrow transplantation was the only way to restore the
hematopoietic system. However, both
peripheral blood and umbilical cord
blood are now also common sources of
hematopoietic stem cells. These alternative sources of HSCs are attractive because
the donor does not have to undergo
anesthesia or the highly invasive procedure used to extract bone marrow.
Although peripheral blood may replace
marrow as a major source of hematopoietic stem cells for many applications,
bone marrow transplantation still has
some advantages (e.g., marrow may
include stem cell subsets that are not as
prevalent in blood). To obtain HSCenriched preparations from peripheral
blood, agents are used to induce increased
numbers of circulating HSCs, and then the
HSC-containing fraction is separated from
the plasma and red blood cells in a process called leukapheresis. If necessary,
further purification can be done to
remove T cells and to enrich the CD34
population.
Umbilical cord blood contains an
unusually high frequency of hematopoietic stem cells. Furthermore, it is obtained
from placental tissue (the “afterbirth”),
which is normally discarded. Consequently, umbilical cord blood has become
an attractive source of cells for HSC transplantation. For reasons that remain
incompletely understood, cord blood
stem cell transplants do not engraft as
reliably as peripheral blood stem cell
transplants; however, grafts of cord blood
cells produce GVHD less frequently than
marrow grafts, probably because cord
blood has fewer mature T cells.
Beyond its current applications in
cancer treatment, autologous stem cell
transplantation can also be useful for

on the surface of thymic stromal cells. Those thymocytes
whose T-cell receptors bind self MHC-peptide complexes
with too high affinity are induced to die (negative selection), and those thymocytes that bind self MHC-peptides
with an intermediate affinity undergo positive selection,
resulting in their survival, maturation, and migration to the
thymic medulla. Most thymocytes do not navigate the jour-

gene therapy, the introduction of a
normal gene to correct a disorder
caused by a defective gene. One of the
most highly publicized gene therapy
efforts—the introduction of the adenosine deaminase (ADA) gene to correct a
form of severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID)—was performed successfully on hematopoietic stem cells. The
therapy entails removing a sample of
hematopoietic stem cells from a patient,
inserting a functional gene to compensate for the defective one, and then
reinjecting the engineered stem cells
into the donor.
The advantage of using stem cells in
gene therapy is that they are selfrenewing. Consequently, at least in theory, patients would have to receive only a
single injection of engineered stem cells.
In contrast, gene therapy with engineered mature lymphocytes or other
blood cells would require periodic injections because these cells are not capable
of self-renewal. In the case of the SCID
patients, hematopoietic stem cells were
successfully infected with a retrovirus
engineered to express the ADA gene. The
cells were returned to the patients and
did, indeed, correct the deficiency.
Patients who previously could not generate lymphocytes to protect themselves
from infection were able to generate normal cells and live relatively normal lives.
Unfortunately, in a number of patients,
the retrovirus used to introduce the ADA
gene integrated into parts of the genome
that resulted in leukemia. Investigators
continue to work to improve the safety
and efficiency of gene delivery; more successful gene therapy efforts are clearly in
the future.

ney through the thymus successfully; in fact, it is estimated
that 95% of thymocytes die in transit. The majority of cells
die because they have too low an affinity for the self-antigenMHC combinations that they encounter on the surface of
thymic epithelial cells and fail to undergo positive selection.
These developmental events take place in several distinct
thymic microenvironments (see Figure 2-6). T-cell precursors

Introduction

CLASSIC EXPERIMENT

The Discovery of a Thymus—and Two
J.F.A.P. MILLER DISCOVERED THE
FUNCTION OF THE THYMUS
In 1961, Miller, who had been investigating the thymus’s role in leukemia, published a set of observations in The Lancet
that challenged notions that, at best, this
organ served as a cemetery for lymphocytes and, at worst, was detrimental to
health (Figure 1). He noted that when this
organ was removed in very young mice
(in a process known as thymectomy), the
subjects became susceptible to a variety
of infections, failed to reject skin grafts,
and died prematurely. On close examination of their circulating blood cells, they
also appeared to be missing a type of cell
that another investigator, James Gowans,
had associated with cellular and humoral
immune responses. Miller concluded that
the thymus produced functional immune
cells.
Several influential investigators could
not repeat the data and questioned
Miller’s conclusions. Some speculated
that the mouse strain he used was peculiar, others that his mice were exposed to
too many pathogens and their troubles
were secondary to infection. Dr. Miller
responded to each of these criticisms

experimentally, assessing the impact of
thymectomy in different mouse strains
and in germ-free facilities. His results were
unequivocal, and his contention that this
organ generated functional lymphocytes
was vindicated. Elegant experiments by
Dr. Miller, James Gowans, and others subsequently showed that the thymus produced a different type of lymphocyte than
the bone marrow. This cell did not produce antibodies directly, but, instead, was
required for optimal antibody production.
It was called a T cell after the thymus, its
organ of origin. Immature T cells are
known as thymocytes. Miller is one of the
few scientists credited with the discovery
of the function of an entire organ.

A SECOND THYMUS
No one expected a new anatomical discovery in immunology in the 21st century.
However, in 2006 Hans-Reimer Rodewald
and his colleagues reported the existence
of a second thymus in mice. The conventional thymus is a bi-lobed organ that
sits in the thorax right above the heart.
Rodewald and his colleagues discovered
thymic tissue that sits in the neck, near the
cervical vertebrae, of mice. This cervical

FIGURE 1

(opposite) of his Lancet article (1961) describing his
discovery of the function of the thymus. [The Walter and
Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research.]

thymic tissue is smaller in mass than the
conventional thymus, consists of a single
lobe or clusters of single lobes, and is
populated by relatively more mature
thymocytes. However, it contributes to
T-cell development very effectively and
clearly contributes to the mature T-cell
repertoire. Rodewald’s findings raise the
possibility that some of our older observations and assumptions about thymic
function need to be reexamined. In particular, studies based on thymectomy that
indicated T cells could develop outside
the thymus may need to be reassessed.
The cells found may have come from this
more obscure but functional thymic tissue.
The evolutionary implications of this
thymus are also interesting—thymi are
found in the neck in several species,
including the koala and kangaroo.

Introduction

enter the thymus in blood vessels at the corticomedullary
junction between the thymic cortex, the outer portion of the
organ, and the thymic medulla, the inner portion of the
organ. At this stage thymocytes express neither CD4 nor
CD8, markers associated with mature T cells. They are therefore called double negative (DN) cells. DN cells first travel to
the region under the thymic capsule, a region referred to as
the subcapsular cortex, where they proliferate and begin to
generate their T-cell receptors. Thymocytes that successfully
express TCRs begin to express both CD4 and CD8, becoming
double positive (DP) cells, and populate the cortex, the site
where most (85% or more) immature T cells are found. The
cortex features a distinct set of stromal cells, cortical thymic
epithelial cells (cTECs), whose long processes are perused by
thymocytes testing the ability of their T-cell receptors to bind
MHC-peptide complexes (Video 2-1). Thymocytes that survive selection move to the thymic medulla, where positively
selected thymocytes encounter specialized stromal cells,
medullary thymic epithelial cells (mTECs). Not only do
mTECs support the final steps of thymocyte maturation, but
they also have a unique ability to express proteins that are
otherwise found exclusively in other organs. This allows them
to negatively select a group of potentially very damaging, autoreactive T cells that could not be deleted in the cortex.1
Mature thymocytes, which express only CD4 or CD8 and
are referred to as single positive (SP), leave the thymus as
they entered: via the blood vessels of the corticomedullary
junction. Maturation is finalized in the periphery, where
these new T cells (recent thymic emigrants) explore antigens
presented in secondary lymphoid tissue, including spleen
and lymph nodes.

Secondary Lymphoid Organs—Where
the Immune Response Is Initiated
As just described, lymphocytes and myeloid cells develop to
maturity in the primary lymphoid system: T lymphocytes in
the thymus, and B cells, monocytes, dendritic cells, and
granulocytes in the bone marrow. However, they encounter
antigen and initiate an immune response in the microenvironments of secondary lymphoid organs (SLOs).

Secondary Lymphoid Organs Are Distributed
Throughout the Body and Share Some
Anatomical Features
Lymph nodes and the spleen are the most highly organized
of the secondary lymphoid organs and are compartmentalized from the rest of the body by a fibrous capsule. A some-

Note that some investigators describe positive selection as taking place in
the cortex and negative selection solely in the medulla. However, several
lines of evidence suggest that negative selection can also occur in the cortex,
and we have adopted this perspective for this text.

what less organized system of secondary lymphoid tissue,
collectively referred to as mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT), is found associated with the linings of multiple
organ systems, including the gastrointestinal (GI) and respiratory tracts. MALT includes tonsils, Peyer’s patches (in the
small intestine), and the appendix, as well as numerous lymphoid follicles within the lamina propria of the intestines
and in the mucous membranes lining the upper airways,
bronchi, and genitourinary tract (Figure 2-7).
Although secondary lymphoid organs vary in their location and degree of organization, they share key features. All
SLOs include anatomically distinct regions of T-cell and
B-cell activity, and all develop lymphoid follicles, which are
highly organized microenvironments that are responsible
for the development and selection of B cells that produce
high-affinity antibodies.

Lymphoid Organs Are Connected to Each
Other and to Infected Tissue by Two Different
Circulatory Systems: Blood and Lymphatics
The immune cells are the most mobile cells in a body and use
two different systems to traffic through tissues: the blood
system and the lymphatic system. The blood has access to
virtually every organ and tissue and is lined by endothelial
cells that are very responsive to inflammatory signals. Hematopoietic cells can transit through the blood system—away
from the heart via active pumping networks (arteries) and
back to the heart via passive valve-based systems (veins)
within minutes. Most lymphocytes enter secondary lymphoid organs via specialized blood vessels, and leave via the
lymphatic system.
The lymphatic system is a network of thin walled vessels
that play a major role in immune cell trafficking, including
the travel of antigen and antigen-presenting cells to secondary lymphoid organs and the exit of lymphocytes from
lymph nodes.
Lymph vessels are filled with a protein-rich fluid (lymph)
derived from the fluid component of blood (plasma) that
seeps through the thin walls of capillaries into the surrounding tissue. In an adult, depending on size and activity, seepage can add up to 2.9 liters or more during a 24-hour period.
This fluid, called interstitial fluid, permeates all tissues and
bathes all cells. If this fluid were not returned to the circulation, the tissue would swell, causing edema that would eventually become life threatening. We are not afflicted with such
catastrophic edema because much of the fluid is returned to
the blood through the walls of venules. The remainder of the
interstitial fluid enters the delicate network of primary lymphatic vessels. The walls of the primary vessels consist of a
single layer of loosely apposed endothelial cells. The porous
architecture of the primary vessels allows fluids and even
cells to enter the lymphatic network. Within these vessels,
the fluid, now called lymph, flows into a series of progressively larger collecting vessels called lymphatic vessels (see
Figures 2-7b and 2-7c).

organs (bone marrow and thymus) are shown in red; secondary
organs and tissues, in blue. These structurally and functionally
diverse lymphoid organs and tissues are interconnected by the
blood vessels (not shown) and lymphatic vessels (purple). Most of
the body’s lymphatics eventually drain into the thoracic duct, which
empties into the left subclavian vein. However, the vessels draining
the right arm and right side of the head (shaded blue) converge to

form the right lymphatic duct, which empties into the right subclavian vein. The inset (b) shows the lymphatic vessels in more detail,
and (c) shows the relationship between blood and lymphatic capillaries in tissue. The lymphatic capillaries pick up interstitial fluid,
particulate and soluble proteins, as well as immune cells from the
tissue surrounding the blood capillaries (see arrows). [Part (a):
Adapted from H. Lodish et al., 1995, Molecular Cell Biology, 3rd ed.,

All cells and fluid circulating in the lymph are ultimately
returned to the blood system. The largest lymphatic vessel,
the thoracic duct, empties into the left subclavian vein. It
collects lymph from all of the body except the right arm and
right side of the head. Lymph from these areas is collected
into the right lymphatic duct, which drains into the right
subclavian vein (see Figure 2-7a). By returning fluid lost
from the blood, the lymphatic system ensures steady-state
levels of fluid within the circulatory system.

The heart does not pump the lymph through the lymphatic system; instead, the slow, low-pressure flow of lymph
is achieved by the movements of the surrounding muscles.
Therefore, activity enhances lymph circulation. Importantly,
a series of one-way valves along the lymphatic vessels
ensures that lymph flows in only one direction.
When a foreign antigen gains entrance to the tissues, it is
picked up by the lymphatic system (which drains all the tissues of the body) and is carried to various organized

Introduction

lymphoid tissues such as lymph nodes, which trap the foreign
antigen. Antigen-presenting cells that engulf and process the
antigen also can gain access to lymph. In fact, as lymph passes
from the tissues to lymphatic vessels, it becomes progressively enriched in specific leukocytes, including lymphocytes,
dendritic cells, and macrophages. Thus, the lymphatic system
also serves as a means of transporting white blood cells and
antigen from the connective tissues to organized lymphoid
tissues, where the lymphocytes can interact with the trapped
antigen and undergo activation. Most secondary lymphoid
tissues are situated along the vessels of the lymphatic system.
The spleen is an exception and is served only by blood vessels.
All immune cells that traffic through tissues, blood, and
lymph nodes are guided by small molecules known as chemokines. These proteins are secreted by stromal cells, antigenpresenting cells, lymphocytes, and granulocytes, and form
gradients that act as attractants and guides for other immune
cells, which express an equally diverse set of receptors for
these chemokines. The interaction between specific chemokines and cells expressing specific chemokine receptors allows
for a highly refined organization of immune cell movements.

The Lymph Node Is a Highly Specialized
Secondary Lymphoid Organ
Lymph nodes (Figure 2-8) are the most specialized SLOs.
Unlike the spleen, which also regulates red blood cell flow and
fate, lymph nodes are fully committed to regulating an immune
response. They are encapsulated, bean-shaped structures that
include networks of stromal cells packed with lymphocytes,
macrophages, and dendritic cells. Connected to both blood
vessels and lymphatic vessels, lymph nodes are the first organized lymphoid structure to encounter antigens that enter the
tissue spaces. The lymph node provides ideal microenvironments for encounters between antigen and lymphocytes and
productive, organized cellular and humoral immune responses.
Structurally, a lymph node can be divided into three
roughly concentric regions: the cortex, the paracortex, and
the medulla, each of which supports a distinct microenvironment (see Figure 2-8). The outermost layer, the cortex, contains lymphocytes (mostly B cells), macrophages, and
follicular dendritic cells arranged in follicles. Beneath the
cortex is the paracortex, which is populated largely by T
lymphocytes and also contains dendritic cells that migrated
from tissues to the node. The medulla is the innermost layer,
and the site where lymphocytes exit (egress) the lymph node
through the outgoing (efferent) lymphatics. It is more sparsely
populated with lymphoid lineage cells, which include plasma
cells that are actively secreting antibody molecules.
Antigen travels from infected tissue to the cortex of the
lymph node via the incoming (afferent) lymphatic vessels,
which pierce the capsule of a lymph node at numerous sites
and empty lymph into the subcapsular sinus (see Figure 2-8b).
It enters either in particulate form or is processed and
presented as peptides on the surface of migrating antigenpresenting cells. Particulate antigen can be trapped by resident

antigen-presenting cells in the subcapsular sinus or cortex,
and it can be passed to other antigen-presenting cells,
including B lymphocytes. Alternatively, particulate antigen
can be processed and presented as peptide-MHC complexes
on cell surfaces of resident dendritic cells that are already in
the T-cell-rich paracortex.
T Cells in the Lymph Node
It takes every naïve T lymphocyte about 16 to 24 hours to
browse all the MHC-peptide combinations presented by the
antigen-presenting cells in a single lymph node. Naïve lymphocytes enter the cortex of the lymph node by passing
between the specialized endothelial cells of high endothelial
venules (HEV), so-called because they are lined with unusually tall endothelial cells that give them a thickened appearance (Figure 2-9a).
Once naïve T cells enter the lymph node, they browse
MHC-peptide antigen complexes on the surfaces of the dendritic cells present in the paracortex. The paracortex is traversed by a web of processes that arise from stromal cells called
fibroblast reticular cells (FRCs) (Figure 2-9b). This network is
referred to as the fibroblast reticular cell conduit system
(FRCC) and guides T-cell movements via associated adhesion
molecules and chemokines. Antigen-presenting cells also
appear to wrap themselves around the conduits, giving circulating T cells ample opportunity to browse their surfaces as
they are guided down the network. The presence of this specialized network elegantly enhances the probability that T cells
will meet their specific MHC-peptide combination.
T cells that browse the lymph node but do not bind
MHC-peptide combinations exit not via the blood, but via
the efferent lymphatics in the medulla of the lymph node (see
Figure 2-8). T cells whose TCRs do bind to an MHC-peptide
complex on an antigen-presenting cell that they encounter in
the lymph node will stop migrating and take up residence in
the node for several days. Here it will proliferate and,
depending on cues from the antigen-presenting cell itself, its
progeny will differentiate into effector cells with a variety of
functions. CD8 T cells gain the ability to kill target cells.
CD4 T cells can differentiate into several different kinds of
effector cells, including those that can further activate macrophages, CD8 T cells, and B cells.
B Cells in the Lymph Node
The lymph node is also the site where B cells are activated
and differentiate into high-affinity antibody-secreting
plasma cells. B cell activation requires both antigen engagement by the B-cell receptor (BCR) and direct contact with an
activated CD4 TH cell. Both events are facilitated by the
anatomy of the lymph node. Like T cells, B cells circulate
through the blood and lymph and visit the lymph nodes on
a daily basis, entering via the HEV. They respond to specific
signals and chemokines that draw them not to the paracortex but to the lymph node follicle. Although they may initially take advantage of the FRCC for guidance, they

FIGURE 2-8 Structure of a lymph node. The microenvironments of the lymph node support distinct cell activities. (a) The lymph
nodes are dispersed throughout the body and are connected by lymphatic vessels as well as blood vessels (not shown). (b) A drawing of the
major features of a lymph node shows the major vessels that serve the
organ: incoming (afferent) and outgoing (efferent) lymphatic vessels,
and the arteries and veins. It also depicts the three major tissue layers:
the outer cortex, the paracortex, and the innermost region, the
medulla. Macrophages and dendritic cells, which trap antigen, are present in the cortex and paracortex. T cells are concentrated in the paracortex; B cells are primarily in the cortex, within follicles and germinal

centers. The medulla is populated largely by antibody-producing
plasma cells and is the site where cells exit via the efferent lymphatics.
Naïve lymphocytes circulating in the blood enter the node via high
endothelial venules (HEV) via a process called extravasation (see
Advances Box 14-2). Antigen and some leukocytes, including antigenpresenting cells, enter via afferent lymphatic vessels. All cells exit via
efferent lymphatic vessels. (c) This stained tissue section shows the
cortex with a number of ovoid follicles, which is surrounded by the

ultimately depend upon follicular dendritic cells (FDCs) for
guidance (Figure 2-9c). FDCs are centrally important in
maintaining follicular and germinal center structure and
“presenting” antigen to differentiating B cells.
B cells differ from T cells in that their receptors can recognize free antigen. A B cell will typically meet its antigen
in the follicle. If its BCR binds to antigen, the B cell
becomes partially activated and engulfs and processes that
antigen. As mentioned above, B cells, in fact, are specialized antigen-presenting cells that present processed peptideMHC complexes on their surface to CD4 TH cells. Recent
data show that B cells that have successfully engaged and
processed antigen change their migration patterns and

move to the T-cell-rich paracortex, where they increase
their chances of encountering an activated CD4 TH cell
that will recognize the MHC-antigen complex they present.
When they successfully engage this TH cell, they maintain
contact for a number of hours, becoming fully activated
and receiving signals that induce B cell proliferation (see
Chapter 14).
Some activated B cells differentiate directly into an antibody-producing cell (plasma cell) but others re-enter the
follicle to establish a germinal center. A follicle that develops
a germinal center is sometimes referred to as a secondary
follicle; a follicle without a germinal center is sometimes
referred to as a primary follicle.

Germinal centers are remarkable substructures that
facilitate the generation of B cells with increased receptor
affinities. In the germinal center, an antigen-specific B cell
clone will proliferate and undergo somatic hypermutation
of the genes coding for their antigen receptors. Those receptors that retain the ability to bind antigen with the highest
affinity survive and differentiate into plasma cells that travel
to the medulla of the lymph node. Some will stay and
release antibodies into the bloodstream; others will exit
through the efferent lymphatics and take up residence in the

bone marrow, where they will continue to release antibodies
into circulation.
The initial activation of B cells and establishment of the
germinal center take place within 4 to 7 days of the initial infection, but germinal centers remain active for 3 weeks or more
(Chapter 12). Lymph nodes swell visibly and sometimes painfully, particularly during those first few days after infection. This
swelling is due both to an increase in the number of lymphocytes induced to migrate into the node as well as the proliferation of antigen-specific T and B lymphocytes within the lobe.

Cells, Organs, and Microenvironments of the Immune System
The Generation of Memory T and B Cells
in the Lymph Node
The interactions between TH cells and APCs, and between
activated TH cells and activated B cells, results not only in the
proliferation of antigen-specific lymphocytes and their
functional differentiation, but also in the generation of memory T and B cells. Memory T and B cells can take up residence
in secondary lymphoid tissues or can exit the lymph node and
travel to and among tissues that first encountered the pathogen. Memory T cells that reside in secondary lymphoid organs
are referred to as central memory cells and are distinct in phenotype and functional potential from effector memory T cells
that circulate among tissues. Memory cell phenotype, locale,
and activation requirements are an active area of investigation
and will be discussed in in more detail in Chapters 11 and 12.

The Spleen Organizes the Immune Response
Against Blood-Borne Pathogens
The spleen, situated high in the left side of the abdominal cavity, is a large, ovoid secondary lymphoid organ that plays a
major role in mounting immune responses to antigens in the
bloodstream (Figure 2-10). Whereas lymph nodes are specialized for encounters between lymphocytes and antigen drained
from local tissues, the spleen specializes in filtering blood and
trapping blood-borne antigens; thus, it is particularly important in the response to systemic infections. Unlike the lymph
nodes, the spleen is not supplied by lymphatic vessels. Instead,
blood-borne antigens and lymphocytes are carried into the
spleen through the splenic artery and out via the splenic vein.
Experiments with radioactively labeled lymphocytes show
that more recirculating lymphocytes pass daily through the
spleen than through all the lymph nodes combined.
The spleen is surrounded by a capsule from which a number of projections (trabeculae) extend, providing structural
support. Two main microenvironmental compartments can
be distinguished in splenic tissue: the red pulp and white
pulp, which are separated by a specialized region called the
marginal zone (see Figure 2-10d). The splenic red pulp consists of a network of sinusoids populated by red blood cells,
macrophages, and some lymphocytes. It is the site where old
and defective red blood cells are destroyed and removed;
many of the macrophages within the red pulp contain
engulfed red blood cells or iron-containing pigments from
degraded hemoglobin. It is also the site where pathogens first
gain access to the lymphoid-rich regions of the spleen, known
as the white pulp. The splenic white pulp surrounds the
branches of the splenic artery, and consists of the periarteriolar lymphoid sheath (PALS) populated by T lymphocytes as
well as B-cell follicles. As in lymph nodes, germinal centers are
generated within these follicles during an immune response.
The marginal zone, which borders the white pulp, is populated
by unique and specialized macrophages and B cells, which are
the first line of defense against certain blood-borne pathogens.
Blood-borne antigens and lymphocytes enter the spleen
through the splenic artery, and interact first with cells at the

/Volumes/203/MHR00209/siL52070/disk1of1/0071052070

CHAPTER 2

marginal zone. In the marginal zone, antigen is trapped and
processed by dendritic cells, which travel to the PALS. Specialized, resident marginal zone B cells also bind antigen via complement receptors and convey it to the follicles. Migrating B
and T lymphocytes in the blood enter sinuses in the marginal
zone and migrate to the follicles and the PALS, respectively.
The events that initiate the adaptive immune response in
the spleen are analogous to those that occur in the lymph
node. Briefly, circulating naïve B cells encounter antigen in
the follicles, and circulating naïve CD8 and CD4 T cells
meet antigen as MHC-peptide complexes on the surface of
dendritic cells in the T-cell zone (PALS). Once activated,
CD4 TH cells then provide help to B cells and CD8 T cells
that have also encountered antigen. Some activated B cells,
together with some TH cells, migrate back into follicles and
generate germinal centers.
It is unclear whether a reticular network operates as
prominently within the spleen as it does in the lymph node.
However, given that T cells, dendritic cells, and B cells find a
way to interact efficiently within the spleen to initiate an
immune response, it would not be surprising if a similar
conduit system were present.
Although animals can lead a relatively healthy life without
a spleen, its loss does have consequences. In children, in particular, splenectomy (the surgical removal of a spleen) can
lead to overwhelming post-splenectomy infection (OPSI)
syndrome characterized by systemic bacterial infections
(sepsis) caused by primarily Streptococcus pneumoniae, Neisseria meningitidis, and Haemophilus influenzae. Although
fewer adverse effects are experienced by adults, splenectomy
can still lead to an increased vulnerability to blood-borne
bacterial infections, underscoring the role the spleen plays in
our immune response to pathogens that enter the circulation.
It is also important to recognize that the spleen has other
functions (e.g., in iron metabolism, thrombocyte storage,
hematopoiesis) that will also be compromised if it is removed.

MALT Organizes the Response to Antigen
That Enters Mucosal Tissues
Lymph nodes and the spleen are not the only organs that
develop secondary lymphoid microenvironments. T- and
B-cell zones and lymphoid follicles are also found in mucosal
membranes that line the digestive, respiratory, and urogenital systems, as well as in the skin.
Mucosal membranes have a combined surface area of about
400 m2 (nearly the size of a basketball court) and are the major
sites of entry for most pathogens. These vulnerable membrane
surfaces are defended by a group of organized lymphoid tissues
known collectively as mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue
(MALT). Lymphoid tissue associated with different mucosal
areas is sometimes given more specific names; for instance, the
respiratory epithelium is referred to as bronchus-associated
lymphoid tissue (BALT) or nasal-associated lymphoid tissue
(NALT), and that associated with the intestinal epithelium is
referred to as gut-associated lymphoid tissue (GALT).

pierces the capsule and divides into progressively smaller arterioles,

The erythrocyte-filled red pulp surrounds the sinusoids. The white
pulp forms a sleeve—the periarteriolar lymphoid sheath (PALS)—
around the arterioles; this sheath contains numerous T cells. Closely
associated with the PALS are the B-cell-rich lymphoid follicles that
can develop into secondary follicles containing germinal centers.
The marginal zone, a site of specialized macrophages and B cells,
surrounds the PALS and separates it from the red pulp. [2-10b: Dr. Keith

The structure of GALT is well described and ranges from
loose, barely organized clusters of lymphoid cells in the lamina
propria of intestinal villi to well-organized structures such as
the tonsils and adenoids (Waldeyer’s tonsil ring), the appendix,
and Peyer’s patches, which are found within the intestinal lining

and contain well-defined follicles and T-cell zones. As shown in
Figure 2-11, lymphoid cells are found in various regions within
the lining of the intestine. The outer mucosal epithelial layer
contains intraepithelial lymphocytes (IELs), many of which
are T cells. The lamina propria, which lies under the epithelial

layer, contains large numbers of B cells, plasma cells, activated
T cells, and macrophages in loose clusters. Microscopy has
revealed more than 15,000 lymphoid follicles within the intestinal lamina propria of a healthy child. Peyer’s patches, nodules
of 30 to 40 lymphoid follicles, extend into the muscle layers that
are just below the lamina propria. Like lymphoid follicles in
other sites, those that compose Peyer’s patches can develop into
secondary follicles with germinal centers. The overall functional importance of MALT in the body’s defense is underscored by its large population of antibody-producing plasma
cells, whose number exceeds that of plasma cells in the spleen,
lymph nodes, and bone marrow combined.
Some cellular structures and activities are unique to MALT.
For instance, the epithelial cells of mucous membranes play an
important role in delivering small samples of foreign antigen
from the respiratory, digestive, and urogenital tracts to the

underlying mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue. In the digestive tract, specialized M cells transport antigen across the epithelium (Figure 2-12). The structure of M cells is striking: they
are flattened epithelial cells lacking the microvilli that characterize the rest of the mucosal epithelium. They have a deep
invagination, or pocket, in the basolateral plasma membrane,
which is filled with a cluster of B cells, T cells, and macrophages. Antigens in the intestinal lumen are endocytosed into
vesicles that are transported from the luminal membrane to
the underlying pocket membrane. The vesicles then fuse with
the pocket membrane, delivering antigens to clusters of lymphocytes and antigen-presenting cells, the most important of
which are dendritic cells, contained within the pocket. Antigen
transported across the mucous membrane by M cells ultimately leads to the activation of B cells that differentiate and
then secrete IgA. This class of antibody is concentrated in

body to combat many types of infection at mucosal sites.

The Skin Is an Innate Immune Barrier
and Also Includes Lymphoid Tissue
The skin is the largest organ in the body and a critical anatomic
barrier against pathogens. It also plays an important role in
nonspecific (innate) defenses (Figure 2-13). The epidermal
(outer) layer of the skin is composed largely of specialized epithelial cells called keratinocytes. These cells secrete a number
of cytokines that may function to induce a local inflammatory

by M cells, whose nuclei are labeled. Lymphocytes are also present in the lamina propria. [2-12c: Kucharzik, T., Lugering, N., Schmid,

reaction. Scattered among the epithelial-cell matrix of the epidermis are Langerhans cells, skin-resident dendritic cells that
internalize antigen by phagocytosis or endocytosis. These
Langerhans cells undergo maturation and migrate from the
epidermis to regional lymph nodes, where they function as
potent activators of naïve T cells. In addition to Langerhans
cells, the epidermis also contains intraepidermal lymphocytes, which are predominantly T cells; some immunologists
believe that they play a role in combating infections that enter
through the skin, a function for which they are well positioned.
The underlying dermal layer of the skin also contains scattered
lymphocytes, dendritic cells, monocytes, macrophages, and

Tissues that are the sites of infection are referred to as tertiary lymphoid tissue. Lymphocytes activated by antigen in
secondary lymphoid tissue can return to these organs (e.g.,
lung, liver, brain) as effector cells and can also reside there as
memory cells. It also appears as if tertiary lymphoid tissues
can generate defined microenvironments that organize the
returning lymphoid cells. Investigators have recently found
that the brain, for instance, establishes reticular systems that
guide lymphocytes responding to chronic infection with the
protozoan that causes toxoplasmosis. These observations
together highlight the remarkable adaptability of the immune
system, as well as the intimate relationship between anatomical structure and immune function. The conservation of
structure/function relationships is also illustrated by the
evolutionary relationships among immune systems and
organs (see the Evolution Box 2-4 below on pages 57–59).

Langerhans cells reside in the outer layer, the epidermis. They travel
to lymph nodes via the lymphatic vessels in the dermis, a layer of
connective tissue below the epidermis. Dendritic cells also reside in
the dermis and also can travel via the lymphatic vessels to lymph
nodes when activated. White blood cells, including monocytes and
lymphocytes travel to both layers of the skin via blood vessels,
extravasating in the dermis, as shown.

BOX 2-4

EVOLUTION

Variations on Anatomical Themes
In Chapter 5, we will see that innate
systems of immunity are found in vertebrates, invertebrates, and even in plants.
Adaptive immunity, which depends on
lymphocytes and is mediated by antibodies
and T cells, only evolved in the subphylum
Vertebrata. However, as shown in Figure 1,
the kinds of lymphoid tissues seen in different orders of vertebrates differ dramatically.
All multicellular living creatures, plant
and animal, have cellular and molecular
systems of defense against pathogens.
Vertebrates share an elaborate anatomical
immune system that is compartmentalized in several predictable ways. For example, sites where immune cells develop
(primary lymphoid organs) are separated
from where they generate an immune
response (secondary lymphoid tissue).
Likewise, sites that support the development of B cells and myeloid cells, are separated from sites that generate mature T

cells. The spectrum of vertebrates ranges
from the jawless fishes (Agnatha, the earliest lineages, which are represented by the
lamprey eel and hagfish), to cartilaginous
fish (sharks, rays), which represent the
earliest lineages of jawed vertebrates
(Gnathosomata), to bony fish, reptiles,
amphibians, birds, and mammals, the
most recently evolved vertebrates. If you
view these groups as part of an evolutionary progression, you see that, in general,
immune tissues and organs evolved by
earlier orders have been retained as newer
organs of immunity, such as lymph nodes,
have appeared. For example, all vertebrates have gut-associated lymphoid tissue (GALT), but only jawed vertebrates
have a well-developed thymus and spleen.
The adaptive immune system of jawed
vertebrates emerged about 500 million
years ago. T cells were the first cell population to express a diverse repertoire of anti-

gen receptors, and their appearance is
directly and inextricably linked to the
appearance of the thymus. This dependence is reflected in organisms today: all
jawed vertebrates have a thymus, and the
thymus is absolutely required for the development of T cells. Until recently, it was
thought that jawless vertebrates (e.g., the
lamprey eel) did not have any thymic tissue.
However, recent studies indicate that even
the lamprey supports the development of
two distinct lymphocyte populations reminiscent of T and B cells, and may also harbor
distinct thymic-like tissue in their gill regions
(Figure 2). In contrast, their B-lymphocytelike cells may develop in distinct regions
associated with the kidneys and intestine
(typhlosole). These findings suggest that
jawed and jawless vertebrates share a common ancestor in which lymphocyte lineages and primary lymphoid organs were
already compartmentalized.

Evolutionary distribution of lymphoid tissues. The presence and location of lymphoid tissues in several major orders of vertebrates are shown.
Although they are not shown in the diagram, cartilaginous fish such as sharks and rays have GALT, a thymus, and a spleen. Reptiles also have GALT, a thymus,
and a spleen and may also have lymph nodes that participate in immunological reactions. The sites and nature of primary lymphoid tissues in reptiles are
under investigation. Although jawless animals were thought not to have a thymus, recent data suggest that they might have thymic tissue and two types of
lymphocytes analogous to B cells and T cells. [Adapted from Dupasquier and M. Flajnik, 2004, in Fundamental Immunology, 5th ed., W. E. Paul, ed., Lippincott-Raven, Philadelphia.]

Whereas T-cell development is inextricably linked to the presence of a thymus, B-cell development does not
appear to be bound to one particular
organ. Although the bone marrow is the
site of B-cell development in many mammals, including mouse and human, it is
not the site of B-cell development in all

species. For instance, the anatomical
sites of B-cell development shift over the
course of development in sharks (from
liver to kidney to spleen), in amphibians
and reptiles (from liver and spleen to
bone marrow). In contrast, B-cell development in bony fish takes place primarily
within the kidney.

In birds, B cells complete their development in a lymphoid organ associated
with the gut, the bursa of Fabricius (Figure 3). The gut is also a site of B-cell development in some mammals. In cattle and
sheep, early in gestation, B cells mature in
the fetal spleen. Later in gestation, however, this function is assumed by the

the intestine called the ileal Peyer’s patch,
which contains a large number of B cells
as well as T cells. The rabbit, too, uses gutassociated tissues, especially the appendix, as primary lymphoid tissue for
important steps in the proliferation and
diversification of B cells. Recent work suggests that even in animals that depend
largely on the bone marrow to complete
B cell maturation, lymphoid tissue in the
gut can act as a primary lymphoid organ
for generating mature B lymphocytes.

Secondary lymphoid organs are more
variable in their numbers and location
than primary lymphoid organs (e.g.,
rodents do not have tonsils, but do have
well-developed lymphoid tissue at the
base of the nose). The structural and
functional features of these organs are,
however, shared by most vertebrates
with at least one interesting exception:
pig lymph nodes exhibit a striking peculiarity—they are “inverted” anatomically,
so that the medulla of the organ, where
lymphocytes exit the organ, is on the

outside, and the cortex, where lymphocytes meet their antigen and proliferate,
is on the inside. Lymphocyte egress is
also inverted: they exit via blood vessels,
rather than via efferent lymphatics. The
adaptive advantages (if any) of these odd
structural variations are unknown, but
the example reminds us of the remarkable plasticity of structure/function relationships within biological structures and
the creative opportunism of evolutionary
processes.

■

The immune response results from the coordinated activities of many types of cells, organs, and microenvironments
found throughout the body.
Many of the body’s cells, tissues, and organs arise from
different stem cell populations. All red and white blood
cells develop from a pluripotent hematopoietic stem cell
during a highly regulated process called hematopoiesis.
In the adult vertebrate, hematopoiesis occurs in the bone
marrow, a stem cell niche that supports both the selfrenewal of stem cells and their differentiation into multiple blood cell types.
Hematopoietic stem cells give rise to two main blood cell
progenitors: common myeloid progenitors and common
lymphoid progenitors.
Four main types of cells develop from common myeloid
progenitors: red blood cells (erythrocytes), monocytes
(which give rise to macrophages and myeloid dendritic
cells), granulocytes (which include the abundant neutrophils and less abundant basophils, eosinophils, and mast
cells), and megakaryocytes.
Macrophages and neutrophils are specialized for the phagocytosis and degradation of antigens. Macrophages also have
the capacity to present antigen with MHC to T cells.
Immature forms of dendritic cells have the capacity to
capture antigen in one location, undergo maturation, and
migrate to another location, where they present antigen to
T cells. Dendritic cells are the most potent antigen-presenting
cell for activating naïve T cells.
There are three types of lymphoid cells: B cells, T cells, and
natural killer (NK) cells. B and T cells are members of
clonal populations distinguished by antigen receptors of
unique specificity. B cells synthesize and display membrane antibody, and T cells synthesize and display T-cell
receptors (TCRs). NK cells do not synthesize antigenspecific receptors; however a small population of TCRexpressing T cells have features of NK cells and are called
NKT cells.
T cells can be further subdivided into helper T cells, which
typically express CD4 and see peptide bound to MHC
class II, and cytotoxic T cells, which typically express CD8
and see peptide bound to MHC class I.
Primary lymphoid organs are the sites where lymphocytes
develop and mature. T cell precursors come from the bone

marrow but develop fully in the thymus; in humans and
mice, B cells arise and develop in bone marrow. In birds,
B cells develop in the bursa.
■

Secondary lymphoid organs provide sites where lymphocytes encounter antigen, become activated, and undergo
clonal expansion and differentiation into effector cells.
They include the lymph node, spleen, and more loosely
organized sites distributed throughout the mucosal system
(the mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue, or MALT) and
are typically compartmentalized into T-cell areas and
B-cell areas (follicles).

■

Lymph nodes and the spleen are the most highly organized secondary lymphoid organs. T-cell and B-cell activity are separated into distinct microenvironments in both.
T cells are found in the paracortex of the lymph nodes and
the periarteriolar sheath of the spleen. B cells are organized into follicles in both organs.

■

The spleen is the first line of defense against blood-borne
pathogens. It also contains red blood cells and compartmentalizes them in the red pulp from lymphocytes in the
white pulp. A specialized region of macrophages and B cells,
the marginal zone, borders the white pulp.

■

In secondary lymphoid tissue, T lymphocytes can develop
into killer and helper effector cells. CD4 T cells can help
B cells to differentiate into plasma cells, which secrete
antibody or can also develop into effector cells that further
activate macrophages and CD8 cytotoxic T cells. Both B
and T cells also develop into long-lived memory cells.

■

B cells undergo further maturation in germinal cells, a
specialized substructure found in follicles after infection;
here they can increase their affinity for antigen and
undergo class switching.

■

Lymphoid follicles and other organized lymphoid microenvironments are found associated with the mucosa, the
skin, and even tertiary tissues at the site of infection.

■

Mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) is an important defense against infection at epithelial layers and
includes a well-developed network of follicles and lymphoid microenvironments associated with the intestine
(gut-associated lymphoid tissue, GALT).

■

Unique cells found in the lining of the gut, M cells, are
specialized to deliver antigen from the intestinal spaces to
the lymphoid cells within the gut wall.

RESEARCH FOCUS QUESTION Notch is a surface protein that

regulates cell fate. When bound by its ligand, it releases and
activates its intracellular region, which regulates new gene
transcription. Investigators found that the phenotype of de-

veloping cells in the bone marrow differed dramatically when
they overexpressed the active, intracellular portion of Notch.
In particular, the frequency of BCR cells plummeted, and
the frequency of TCR cells increased markedly. Interestingly,

Receptors and Signaling:
B and T-Cell Receptors

T

he coordination of physiological functions
throughout the body depends on the ability of
individual cells to sense changes in their
environment and to respond appropriately. One
of the major routes by which a cell interprets its
surroundings is through the binding of signaling
molecules to cell-associated receptor proteins. A
molecule that binds to a receptor is a ligand.
Noncovalent binding of a ligand to its receptor may
induce alterations in the receptor itself, in its
polymerization state, and/or in the environment of that
receptor. These changes act to transmit or transduce the
ligand-binding signal into the interior of the cell, leading
to alterations in cellular functions. In the nervous
system, we would call the signaling molecules
neurotransmitters; in the endocrine system, hormones.
In the immune system, the foreign molecules that signal
the presence of non-self entities are antigens, and the
small molecules that communicate among the various
populations of immune cells are cytokines. Specialized
cytokines that induce chemo-attraction or -repulsion are
termed chemokines.
In this chapter, we provide a general introduction to
receptor-ligand binding and to the broad concepts and
strategies that underlie signal transduction. We then focus
specifically on the antigens and receptors of the adaptive
immune system, introducing the B- and T-cell receptors
and the intracellular signaling events that occur upon
antigen binding.
Because the cells of the immune system are distributed
throughout the body—with some resident in fixed tissues
and others circulating through the various lymphoid
tissues, the blood, and the lymphatics—the ability of these
cells to communicate with and signal to one another via
soluble cytokine and chemokine molecular messengers is
essential to their function. In Chapter 4, we describe the
signaling events that result when cytokines and chemokines
bind to their cognate (matching) receptors. Chapter 5
includes a description of the pattern recognition receptors
(PRRs) of the innate immune system and of the signaling
events initiated by their antigen binding.

All signaling events begin with a
complementary interaction between a ligand
and a receptor. This figure depicts the
molecular interaction between the variable
regions of an antibody molecule (light and
heavy chains are shown in blue and red,
respectively) and the tip of the influenza
hemagglutinin molecule, shown in yellow.

The essential concepts that underlie cell signaling in

•

A cellular signal is any event that instructs a cell to
change its metabolic or proliferative state.

•

Signals are usually generated by the binding of a ligand
to a complementary cell-bound receptor.

•

A cell can become more or less susceptible to the actions of
a ligand by increasing (up-regulating) or decreasing (downregulating) the expression of the receptor for that ligand.

Introduction

•

The ligand may be a soluble molecule, or it may be a
peptide, carbohydrate, or lipid presented on the surface
of a cell.

•

The ligand may travel long distances from its entry point
through the body in either the bloodstream or the lymphatics
before it reaches a cell bearing the relevant receptor.

•

Ligand-receptor binding is noncovalent, although it may
be of quite high affinity.

•

Ligand binding to the receptor induces a molecular
change in the receptor. This change may be in the form
of a conformational alteration in the receptor, receptor
dimerization or clustering, a change in the receptor’s
location in the membrane, or a covalent modification.

•

are individually weak, many such interactions are required
to form a biologically significant receptor-ligand connection.
Furthermore, since each of these noncovalent interactions
operates only over a very short distance—generally about
1 Angstrom, (1 Å  1010 meters)—a high-affinity receptorligand interaction depends on a very close “fit,” or degree of
complementarity, between the receptor and the ligand
(Figure 3-1).

How Do We Quantitate the Strength of
Receptor-ligand Interactions?
Consider a receptor, R, binding to a ligand, L. We can
describe their binding reaction according to the following
equation,

Such receptor alterations set off cascades of intracellular
events that include the activation of enzymes, and changes
in the intracellular locations of important molecules.

•

The end result of cellular signaling is often, but not
always, a change in the transcriptional program of the
target cell.

•

Sometimes a cell must receive more than one signal
through more than one receptor in order to effect a
particular outcome.

•

Integration of all the signals received by a cell occurs at
the molecular level inside the recipient cell.

Receptor-Ligand Interactions
The antigen receptors of the adaptive immune system are
transmembrane proteins localized at the plasma membrane.
Ligand binding to its cognate receptor normally occurs via
specific, noncovalent interactions between the ligand and the
extracellular portion of the membrane receptor. Although a
single lymphocyte expresses only one type of antigen receptor,
it also may express many different receptor molecules for signals such as cytokines and chemokines, and therefore a healthy
cell must integrate the signals from all the receptors that are
occupied at any one time.

Receptor-Ligand Binding Occurs via
Multiple Noncovalent Bonds
The surface of a receptor molecule binds to its complementary ligand surface by the same types of noncovalent chemical linkages that enzymes use to bind to their substrates.
These include hydrogen and ionic bonds, and hydrophobic
and van der Waals interactions. The key to a meaningful
receptor-ligand interaction is that the sum total of these
bonding interactions hold the two interacting surfaces
together with sufficient binding energy, and for sufficient
time, to allow a signal to pass from the ligand to the cell
bearing the receptor. Because these noncovalent interactions

FIGURE 3-1 Receptor-ligand binding obeys the rules of
chemistry. Receptors bind to ligands using the full-range of noncovalent bonding interactions, including ionic and hydrogen bonds
and van der Waals and hydrophobic interactions. For signaling to
occur, the bonds must be of sufficient strength to hold the ligand
and receptor in close proximity long enough for downstream events
to be initiated. In B- and T-cell signaling, activating interactions also
require receptor clustering. In an aqueous environment, noncovalent
interactions are weak and depend on close complementarity of the
shapes of receptor and ligand.

receptor-ligand pair. The association constant is defined as
the relationship between the concentration of reaction product, [RL], and the product of the concentrations of reactants,
[R] multiplied by [L]. The units of affinity are therefore M1.
The higher the Ka, the higher the affinity of the interaction.

The reciprocal of the association constant, the dissociation
constant, Kd, is often used to describe the interactions
between receptors and ligands. It is defined as:
Kd 

3R4 3L 4
3RL4

(Eq. 3-3)

The units of the dissociation constant are in molarity (M).
Inspection of this equation reveals that when half of the
receptor sites are filled with ligand—that is, [R][RL]—the
Kd is equal to the concentration of free ligand [L]. The lower
the Kd, the higher the affinity of the interaction.
For purposes of comparison, it is useful to consider that
the Kd values of many enzyme-substrate interactions lie in
the range of 103 M to 105 M. The Kd values of antigenantibody interactions at the beginning of an immune
response are normally on the order of 104 to 105 M. However, since the antibodies generated upon antigen stimulation are mutated and selected over the course of an immune
response, antigen-antibody interactions late in an immune
response may achieve a Kd as low as 1012 M. Under these
conditions, if an antigen is present in solution at a concentration as low as 1012 M, half of the available antibody-binding
sites will be filled. This is an extraordinarily strong interaction between receptor and ligand.

Interactions Between Receptors and Ligands
Can Be Multivalent
Many biological receptors, including B-cell receptors, are multivalent—that is, they have more than one ligand binding site
per molecule. When both receptors and ligands are multivalent—as occurs, for example, when a bivalent immunoglobulin
receptor on the surface of a B cell binds to two, identical,
repeated antigens on a bacterial surface—the overall binding
interaction between the bacterial cell and the B-cell receptor is
markedly enhanced compared with a similar, but univalent,
interaction. In this way, multiple concurrent receptor-ligand
interactions increase the strength of binding between two cell
surfaces. Note, however, that binding via two identical receptor
sites to two identical ligands on the same cell may be a little less
than twice as firm as binding through a single receptor site.
This is because the binding of both receptor sites to two ligands
on a single antigen may somewhat strain the geometry of the
binding at one or both of the sites and therefore slightly interfere with the “fit” of the individual interactions.
Much of the benefit of multivalency results from the
fact that noncovalent-binding interactions are inherently

reversible; the ligand spends some of its time binding to
the receptor, and some of its time in an unbound, or “off ”
state (Figure 3-2a). When more than one binding site is
involved, it is less likely that all of the receptor sites will
simultaneously be in the “off ” state, and therefore that the
receptor will release the ligand (Figures 3-2b and 3-2c).
The term avidity is used to describe the overall strength of
the collective binding interactions that occur during multivalent binding. In the early phases of the adaptive immune
response to multivalent antigens, B cells secrete IgM antibody,
which has 10 available antigen binding sites per molecule. IgM
is therefore capable of binding to antigens at a biologically
significant level, even if the affinity of each individual binding
site for its antigen is low, because of the avidity of the entire
antigen-antibody interaction. Likewise, when a cell-bound
receptor binds to a cell-bound ligand, their interaction may be
functionally multivalent, even if the individual receptor molecules are monovalent, because multiple receptor molecules
can cluster in the cell membrane and participate in the receptor-ligand interaction. In addition, other co-receptor interactions can also contribute to the overall avidity of the
engagement between a cell and its antigen (see below).
The affinity of receptor-ligand interactions can be measured by techniques such as equilibrium dialysis or surface
plasmon resonance (SPR). Both of these methods are
described in Chapter 20.

“on” state), and part of the time it is unbound (binding is in the “off ”

determines the affinity of the receptor-ligand interaction and is
related to the strength of the sum of the noncovalent binding interactions between the receptor and the ligand.

a bivalent receptor, binding to two sites on a single multivalent ligand.
This could represent, for example, a bivalent antibody molecule binding to a bacterium with repeated antigens on its surface. In this rendering, both sites are occupied. (c) In this rendering, the bivalent receptor

has momentarily let go from one of its sites, but still holds onto the
ligand with the other. Large proteins such as antibodies continuously
vibrate and “breathe,” resulting in such on-off kinetics. Bivalent or multivalent binding helps to ensure that, when one site momentarily
releases the ligand, the interaction is not entirely lost, as it is in part (a).

Receptor and Ligand Expression Can Vary
During the Course of an Immune Response

cytes and antigen-presenting cells engaged in an immune
response spend significant amounts of time held together by
multiple receptor-ligand interactions. Cytokine signals
released by a T cell, for example, are received by a bound
antigen-presenting cell at the interface between the cells,
before the cytokine has time to diffuse into the tissue fluids.
The secretion of cytokines into exactly the location where
they are needed is facilitated by the ability of antigen receptor signaling to induce redistribution of the microtubule
organizing center (MTOC) within the activated T cell. The
MTOC reorientation, in turn, causes the redistribution of
the secretory organelles (the Golgi body and secretory vesicles) within the T-cell cytoplasm, so that cytokines made by
the T cell are secreted in the direction of the T-cell receptor,
which, in turn, is binding to the antigen-presenting cell. The
technical term for this phenomenon is the vectorial (directional) redistribution of the secretory apparatus. Thus,
cytokines are secreted directly into the space between the
activated T cell and antigen-presenting cell.
Vectorial redistribution of the secretory apparatus in antigen-presenting dendritic cells also occurs upon interaction
with antigen-specific T cells. This ensures that cytokines,
such as IL-12, which are secreted by dendritic cells, are efficiently delivered to antigen-recognizing T cells. Figure 3-4
shows the directional secretion of the cytokine IL-12 by an
antigen-presenting dendritic cell engaged in the activation
of a T cell.
The effector cells of the immune system, such as B cells,
are also capable of presenting antigens on their cell surface
for recognition by helper T cells. A B cell that has specifically
recognized an antigen through its own receptor will process
the antigen and express a particularly high concentration of
those antigenic peptides bound to Major Histocompatibility
Complex (MHC) molecules on its surface. A helper T cell,
binding to an antigen presented on the surface of a B cell,

One of the most striking features of the molecular logic of
immune responses is that receptors for some growth factors
and cytokines are expressed only on an as-needed basis.
Most lymphocytes, for example, express a hetero-dimeric
(two-chain), low-affinity form of the receptor for the cytokine interleukin 2 (IL-2), which initiates a signal that promotes lymphocyte proliferation. (This cytokine and its
receptor are covered in more detail in Chapter 4.) This lowaffinity form of the receptor is unable to bind to IL-2 at
physiological cytokine concentrations. However, when a
lymphocyte is activated by antigen binding, the signal from
the antigen-binding receptor causes an increase in the cell
surface expression of a third chain of the IL-2 receptor (see
Figure 3-3). Addition of this third chain converts the lowaffinity form of the IL-2 receptor to a high-affinity form,
capable of responding to the cytokine levels found in the
lymphoid organs. The functional corollary of this is that only
those lymphocytes that have already bound to antigen and
have been stimulated by that binding have cytokine receptors of sufficiently high affinity to respond to the physiological cytokine concentrations. By waiting until it has interacted
with its specific antigen before expressing the high-affinity
cytokine receptor, the lymphocyte both conserves energy
and prevents the accidental initiation of an immune response
to an irrelevant antigen.

Local Concentrations of Cytokines and Other
Ligands May Be Extremely High
When considering the interactions between receptors and
their ligands, it is important to consider the anatomical environment in which these interactions are occurring. Lympho-

upregulated following cell stimulation. White blood cells

untreated (left) or stimulated using the human T-cell mitogen

will therefore deliver a high concentration of cytokines
directly to an antigen-specific, activated B cell. The local
concentration of cytokines at the cellular interfaces can
therefore be extremely high, much higher than in the tissue
fluids generally.

Common Strategies Used in Many
Signaling Pathways
A signal transduction pathway is the molecular route by
which a ligand-receptor interaction is translated into a
biochemical change within the affected cell. Communication of the ligand’s message to the cell is initiated by the
complementarity in structure between the ligand and its
receptor, which results in a binding interaction of suffi-

cient strength and duration to bring about a biochemical
change in the receptor and/or its associated molecules.
This biochemical change can, in turn, cause a diverse array
of biochemical consequences in the cell (Overview Figure 3-5). The terms upstream and downstream are frequently used to describe elements of signaling pathways.
The upstream components of a signaling pathway are
those closest to the receptor; the downstream components
are those closest to the effector molecules that determine
the outcome of the pathway—for example, the transcription factors or enzymes whose activities are modified
upon receipt of the signal.
As disparate and complex as some of these signaling
pathways may be, many share common features. In this section, in order to provide a framework for analyzing the individual pathways employed by cells of the immune system, we

Ligand binding to receptors on a cell induces a variety of downstream effects, many of which culminate in transcription factor
activation. Here we illustrate a few of the pathways that are
addressed in this chapter. Binding of receptor to ligand induces
clustering of receptors and signaling molecules into regions of
the membrane referred to as lipid rafts (red). Receptor binding of
ligand may be accompanied by binding of associated coreceptors to their own ligands, and causes the activation of
receptor-associated tyrosine kinases, which phosphorylate receptor-associated proteins. Binding of downstream adapter molecules to the phosphate groups on adapter proteins creates a
scaffold at the membrane that then enables activation of a variety
of enzymes including phospholipase C (PLC), PI3 kinase, and
additional tyrosine kinases. PLC cleaves phosphatidyl inositol
bisphosphate (PIP2) to yield inositol trisphosphate (IP3), which
interacts with receptors on endoplasmic reticulum vesicles to

cause the release of calcium ions. These in turn activate calcineurin,
which dephosphorylates the transcription factor NFAT, allowing it
to enter the nucleus. Diacylglycerol (DAG), remaining in the membrane after PLC cleavage of PIP2, binds and activates protein
kinase C (PKC), which phosphorylates and activates enzymes
leading to the destruction of the inhibitor of the transcription factor NF-B. With the release of the inhibitor, NF-B enters the
nucleus and activates a series of genes important to the immune
system. Binding of the adapter protein Ras-GRP to the signaling
complex allows for the binding and activation of the Guanine
nucleotide Exchange Factor (GEF) Son of Sevenless (SOS), which
in turn initiates the phosphorylation cascade of the MAP kinase
pathways. This leads to the entry of a third set of transcription factors into the nucleus, and activation of the transcription factor
AP-1. (Many details that are explained in the text have been omitted from this figure for clarity.)

Receptors and Signaling: B and T-Cell Receptors
describe some of the strategies shared by many signaling
pathways. The next section provides three examples of signaling pathways used by the immune system, as well as by
other organ systems.

Ligand Binding Can Induce Conformational
Changes in, and/or Clustering of, the Receptor
The first step necessary to the activation of a signaling pathway is that the binding of the ligand to its receptors in some
way induces a physical or chemical change in the receptor
itself, or in molecules associated with it. In the case of many
growth factor receptors, ligand binding induces a conformational change in the receptor that results in receptor
dimerization (Figure 3-6). Since the cytoplasmic regions of
many growth factor receptors have tyrosine kinase activity,
this results in the reciprocal phosphorylation of the cytoplasmic regions of each of the receptor molecules by its
dimerization partner.
Other receptors undergo conformational changes upon
ligand binding that result in higher orders of receptor
polymerization. The receptors on B cells are membranebound forms of the antibody molecules that the B cell will
eventually secrete. Two different types of antigen receptors
exist on the surface of naïve B cells, which we term immunoglobulins M and D (IgM and IgD). Structural studies of the
IgM form of the receptor have revealed that ligand binding
induces a conformational change in a nonantigen binding
part of the receptor, close to the membrane, that facilitates
aggregation of the receptors into multimeric complexes and
their subsequent movement into specialized membrane

regions. T-cell receptors similarly cluster upon antigen binding. Whether or not they undergo a conformational change
upon antigen binding remains controversial.

Some Receptors Require Receptor-Associated
Molecules to Signal Cell Activation
In contrast to growth factor receptors, which have inducible
enzyme activities built into the receptor molecule itself,
B- and T-cell receptors have very short cytoplasmic components and therefore need help from intracellular
receptor-associated molecules to bring about signal transduction. The Ig/Ig (CD79/) heterodimer in B cells, and
the hexameric CD3 complex in T cells are closely associated
with their respective antigen receptors and are responsible
for transmitting the signals initiated by ligand binding into
the interior of the cell (Figure 3-7). Both of these complexes
have a pair of long cytoplasmic tails that contain multiple
copies of the Immuno-receptor Tyrosine Activation Motif
or ITAM. ITAMs are recurrent sequence motifs found on
many signaling proteins within the immune system, which
contain tyrosines that become phosphorylated following
signal transduction through the associated receptor. Phosphorylation of ITAM-tyrosine residues then allows docking
of adapter molecules, thus facilitating initiation of the signaling cascade.
Other molecules associated with the B- or T-cell antigen
receptors may also interact with the antigen or with other
molecules on the pathogen’s surface. For example, in the case
of B cells, the CD19/CD21 complex binds to complement
molecules covalently attached to the antigen (see Figure
3-7a). Similarly, CD4 and CD8 molecules on T cells bind to
nonpolymorphic regions of the antigen-presenting MHC
molecule and aid in signal transduction (see Figure 3-7b).
Finally, the co-receptor CD28 on naïve T cells must interact
with its ligands CD80 (B7-1) and CD86 (B7-2) for full T-cell
activation to occur.

Ligand-Induced Receptor Clustering

Ligand-induced clustering of B- and T-cell receptors slows
down the rates of their diffusion within the planes of their
respective cell membranes, and facilitates their movement
into specialized regions of the lymphocyte membrane
known as lipid rafts. These rafts are highly ordered, detergent-insoluble, cholesterol- and sphingolipid-rich membrane regions, populated by many molecules critical to
receptor signaling. Moving receptors and co-receptors into
the lipid rafts renders them susceptible to the action of
enzymes associated with those rafts. Figure 3-8 shows how
the raft-associated tyrosine kinase Lyn initiates the B-cell
signaling cascade by phosphorylating the receptor-associated
molecules Ig and Ig. The tyrosine kinase Lck serves a
similar role in the TCR signaling cascade.

allows reciprocal phosphorylation of the dimerized receptor chains
at multiple sites, thus initiating the signal cascade. As one example,
stem cell factor binds to its receptor, c-kit (CD117) on the surface of
bone marrow stromal cells.

CD21 co-receptor, which is associated with CD19, binds to the complement molecule C3d, which binds covalently to the antigen. The
interaction between CD21 on the B cell, and C3d associated with the
antigen, keeps the antigen in contact with the B-cell receptor, even
when the antigen-BCR binding is relatively weak. The yellow bands
on the cytoplasmic regions of the receptor-associated molecules
indicate Immuno-receptor Tyrosine Activation Motifs (ITAMs). Phosphorylation of tyrosine residues in these motifs allows the binding of
downstream adapter molecules and facilitates signal transduction

from the receptors. Both CD19 and Ig/Ig bear intracytoplasmic
ITAMs and, along with CD81 (TAPA-1), participate in downstream
signaling events. (b) T-cell receptors use CD3, a complex of

MHC Class II. This binding secures the connection between the T cell
and the antigen presenting cell, and also initiates a signal through
CD4/8. The CD28 co-receptor provides another signal upon binding
to CD80 or CD86. CD28 binding to costimulatory molecules on
antigen-presenting cells is required for stimulation of naïve, but not

to the enzymatic site. Opening up the kinase also allows phosphorylation of a different internal tyrosine (pY397), which further stimulates
the Src kinase activity.

Tyrosine Phosphorylation is an Early Step in
Many Signaling Pathways
Many signaling pathways, particularly those that signal cell
growth or proliferation, are initiated with a tyrosine phosphorylation event. Many of the tyrosine kinases that initiate
BCR and TCR activation belong to the family of enzymes
known as the Src-family kinases. Src (pronounced “sark”)
family kinases have homology to a gene, c-src, that was first
identified in birds. A constitutively active Rous sarcoma virus

cancer, fibrosarcoma, in birds. The fact that a simple mutation in this viral form of a tyrosine kinase gene could result
in the development of a tumor was the first hint that tyrosine
kinase genes may be important in the regulation of cell proliferation and, indeed, in many aspects of cell signaling.
Src-family kinases are important in the earliest stages of
activation of both T and B cells: Lck and Fyn are critical to
T-cell activation, and Lyn, Fyn, and Blk play the corresponding
initiating roles in B cells. Since inadvertent activation of these
enzymes can lead to uncontrolled proliferation—a precursor
to tumor formation—it is not surprising that their activity is
tightly regulated in two different but interconnected ways.
Inactive Src-family tyrosine kinase enzymes exist in a
closed conformation, in which a phosphorylated tyrosine is
tightly bound to an internal SH2 domain (Src homology 2
domain) (Figure 3-9, Table 3-1). (SH2 domains in proteins
bind to phosphorylated tyrosine residues.) For as long as the
inhibitory tyrosine is phosphorylated, the Src-family kinase
remains folded in on itself and inactive. In lymphocytes, the
tyrosine kinase enzyme Csk is responsible for maintaining
phosphorylation of the inhibitory tyrosine. However, upon
cell activation, a tyrosine phosphatase removes the inhibitory
phosphate and the Src-family kinase opens up into a partially
active conformation. Thus, the initiating event in signal transduction is often the movement of the tyrosine kinase into a
region of the cell or the membrane populated by an appropriate, activating phosphatase and distant from the inhibitory
kinase Csk. Full activity is then achieved when the Src-kinase
phosphorylates itself on a second, activating tyrosine residue.

Introduction
specificity for a particular molecular structure. In many signaling pathways, multiple adapter proteins may participate in
the formation of a protein scaffold that provides a structural
framework for the interaction among members of a signaling
cascade. Particularly common domains in adapter proteins
functioning in immune system signaling are the SH2 domain
that binds to phosphorylated tyrosine (pY) residues, the SH3
domain that binds to clusters of proline residues, and the
pleckstrin homology (PH) domain that binds to phosphatidyl inositol trisphosphate in the plasma membrane.
Binding of adapter proteins may simply bring molecules
into contact with one another, so that, for example, an enzyme
may act on its substrate. Alternatively, the binding of an
adapter protein may induce a conformational change, which in
turn can stabilize, destabilize, or activate the binding partner.
Signal transduction may induce conformational changes
in proteins that in turn result in the uncovering of one or
more protein domains with specific affinity for other proteins. Such interactions may be homotypic (interactions
between identical domains) or heterotypic (interactions
between different domains).

Tyrosine phosphorylation can bring about changes in a
signaling pathway in more than one way. Sometimes, phosphorylation of a tyrosine residue can induce a conformational change in the phosphorylated protein itself, which can
turn its enzymatic activity on or off. Alternatively, tyrosine
phosphorylation of components of a receptor complex can
permit other proteins to bind to it via their SH2 or phosphotyrosine binding domains (see Table 3-1), thereby altering
their locations within the cell. Note that a phosphorylated
tyrosine is often referred to as a “pY” residue.

Adapter Proteins Gather Members
of Signaling Pathways
It is easy to imagine the cytoplasm as an ocean of macromolecules, with little structure or organization, in which proteins bump into one another at a frequency dependent only
on their overall cytoplasmic concentrations. However, nothing could be further from the truth. The cytoplasm is, in fact,
an intricately organized environment, in which threedimensional arrays of proteins form and disperse in a manner directed by cellular signaling events. Many of these
reversible interactions between proteins are mediated by
adapter proteins as well as by interactions between members of signaling pathways with cytoskeletal components.
Adapter proteins have no intrinsic enzymatic or receptor
function, nor do they act as transcription factors. Their function is to bind to specific motifs or domains on proteins or
lipids, linking one to the other, bringing substrates within the
range of enzymes, and generally mediating the redistribution
of molecules within the cell. Table 3-1 lists a number of representative adapter domains along with their binding specificities. Adapter proteins are characterized by having multiple
surface domains, each of which possesses a precise binding

Whereas tyrosine phosphorylation is frequently seen at the

occur at later steps in cell activation. Serine or threonine
phosphorylation may serve to activate a phosphorylated
enzyme, to induce the phosphorylated protein to interact
with a different set of proteins, to alter the protein’s location
within the cell, to protect the protein from destruction, or, in

Phosphorylation of Membrane Phospholipids
Recruits PH Domain-Containing Proteins to
the Cell Membrane
The phospholipid Phosphatidyl Inositol bis-Phosphate
(PIP2) is a component of the inner face of eukaryotic plasma
membranes. However, PIP2 is much more than a structural
phospholipid; it also actively participates in cell signaling. The
enzyme Phosphatidyl Inositol-3-kinase (PI3 kinase), activated during the course of signaling through many immune
receptors, phosphorylates PIP2 to form Phosphatidyl Inositol
tris-Phosphate (PIP3) (Figure 3-11). PIP3 remains in the
membrane and serves as a binding site for proteins bearing
pleckstrin homology (PH) domains (see Table 3-1). Thus, this
lipid phosphorylation event serves to move proteins from the
cytosol to the membrane by providing them with a binding site

at the inner membrane surface. Localization of proteins at the
membrane brings them into contact with other members of a
signaling cascade, allowing enzymes access to new substrates
and enabling the modification of adapter proteins with the
subsequent assembly of signaling complexes.

Signal-Induced PIP2 Breakdown by PLC
Causes an Increase in Cytoplasmic Calcium
Ion Concentration
In addition to being phosphorylated by PI3 kinase, PIP2 is also
susceptible to a second type of signal-induced biochemical
modification. A second enzyme (more correctly, a family of
enzymes), Phospholipase C (PLC), is also activated upon antigen signaling of lymphocytes (Figure 3-12). PLC hydrolyzes
PIP2, cleaving the sugar inositol trisphosphate (IP3) from the
diacylglyerol (DAG) backbone. The DAG remains in the
membrane, where it binds and activates a number of important
signaling enzymes. IP3 is released into the cytoplasm, where it
interacts with specific IP3 receptors on the surface of endoplasmic reticulum vesicles, inducing the release of stored calcium
ions (Ca2) into the cytoplasm. These calcium ions then bind
several cellular proteins, changing their conformation and
altering their activity.
The calcium ion’s double positive charge and the size of its
ionic radius render it particularly suitable for binding to many
proteins; however, in the field of cell signaling, calmodulin
(CaM) is unquestionably the most important calcium-binding
protein. As shown in Figure 3-13a, CaM is a dumbbell-shaped
protein, with two globular subunits separated by an -helical
rod. Each of the two subunits has two calcium binding sites,
such that calmodulin has the capacity to bind four Ca2 ions.
On binding calcium, CaM undergoes a dramatic conformational change (Figure 3-13b), which allows it to bind to and
activate a number of different cellular proteins.
As cytoplasmic Ca2 ions are used up in binding to cytoplasmic proteins, and the free cytoplasmic Ca2 ion concentration drops, Ca2 channel proteins begin to assemble at the
membrane. Eventually the channels open to allow more calcium to flood in from the extracellular fluid and complete
the activation of the calcium-regulated proteins. The assembly of these so-called store-operated calcium channel proteins
is prohibited in the presence of high intracellular calcium.
Many different types of ions are present in a cell, and it is
reasonable to ask why eukaryotes should have evolved proteins with activities that are so responsive to intracellular
Ca2 ion concentrations. The answer to this question in part
lies in the fact that it is relatively easy to alter the intracytoplasmic concentration of Ca2 ions. The concentration of
Ca2 in the blood and tissue fluids is on the order of 1 mM,
whereas the cytosolic concentration in a resting cell is closer
to 100 nM—10,000 times lower than the extracellular concentration. This difference is maintained by an efficient
(although energetically expensive) system of membrane
pumps. Furthermore, higher-concentration Ca2 stores exist

within intracellular vesicles associated with the endoplasmic
reticulum and the mitochondria. Thus, any signaling event
that opens up channels in the membrane of the endoplasmic

by polymerization of a chain of ubiquitins onto selected
lysine residues of the conjugated ubiquitin. This results in
poly-ubiquitination of the target protein. In most instances,
mono- or poly-ubiquitination serves as a mechanism by
which the tagged proteins are targeted for destruction by the
proteasome of the cell. However, we now know that ubiquitination on certain residues of proteins can also serve as an
activating signal, and we will come across this alternative role
of ubiquitin below as we learn about the activation of the
NF-B transcription factor, as well as in Chapters 4 and 5.

Frequently Encountered
Signaling Pathways
Analysis of the biochemical routes by which molecular signals pass from cell surface receptors to the interior of the cell
has revealed that a few signal transduction pathways are
used repeatedly in the cellular responses to different ligands.
These pathways are utilized, in slightly different forms, in
multiple cellular and organ systems, and in many species.
The end result of most of these pathways is an alteration in
the transcriptional program of the cell. Here we briefly
describe three such pathways of particular relevance to the
adaptive immune system (see Overview Figure 3-5). Each of
these pathways is triggered by antigen binding to the receptor and leads to the activation of a different family of transcription factors. The generation of these active transcription
factors in turn initiates the up-regulation of a cascade of
genes important to the immune response, including those
encoding cytokines, antibodies, survival factors, and proliferative signals.
Although the conceptual framework of these signaling
pathways is shared among many cell types, small modifications in the molecular intermediates and transcription factors involved allows for variations in the identities of the
genes controlled by particular signals and for cell-type specific transcriptional control mechanisms. For example, the
enzyme PLC exists in different forms; PLC1 is used in T
cells and PLC2 in B cells. Similarly, the Nuclear Factor of
Activated T cells (NFAT) family of transcription factors
includes five members, some of which are expressed as differentially spliced variants, and each of which is affected by
different arrays of molecular signals.
Furthermore, activation of transcription from some promoters requires the binding of multiple transcription factors. For example, full expression of the gene encoding
interleukin 2 (IL-2) requires the binding of AP-1, NF-B,
and NFAT, in addition to several other transcription factors,
to the interleukin promoter. In this way, the promoter can be
partially activated in the presence of some of these transcription factors, but not fully active until all of them are in place.
In the next section, we focus on the general principles that
govern the control of these three pathways, from the receipt
of an antigen signal, to the activation of a particular type of
transcription factor.

CHAPTER 3

The PLC Pathway Induces Calcium
Release and PKC Activation
We have already met the essential elements of this pathway in
our discussion of the enzymes that modulate PIP2 upon cell
activation (see Figure 3-12), and we now know that PLC breaks
down PIP2 to IP3 and DAG. But how does PLC become activated in the first place? We use T cells here as our example.
As mentioned, T cells use the PLC1 form of the enzyme.
On antigen stimulation, tyrosine phosphorylation of the ITAM
residues of the CD3 receptor-associated complex results in the
localization of the adapter protein LAT to the membrane (Figure 3-14). LAT in turn is phosphorylated, and PLC1 then
binds to phosphorylated LAT. This binding ensures that PLC1
localizes to the cell membrane, the site of its substrate, PIP2.

Introduction

Once located at the plasma membrane, PLC1 is further activated by tyrosine phosphorylation mediated by the receptoractivated kinase, Lck, as well as by a second tyrosine kinase, Itk.
The phosphorylated and activated PLC1 then mediates cleavage of PIP2 to IP3 and DAG as described above.
How do these secondary mediators then function to
bring about lymphocyte activation? Calcium ions, released
from intracellular stores by IP3, bind to the signaling intermediate, calmodulin. Each molecule of calmodulin binds to
four calcium ions, and this binding results in a profound
alternation in its conformation (see Figure 3-13). The
calcium-calmodulin complex then binds and activates the
phosphatase calcineurin, which dephosphorylates the transcription factor NFAT (see Figure 3-14). This dephosphorylation induces a conformational change in NFAT, revealing a
nuclear localization sequence, which directs NFAT to enter
the nucleus and activate the transcription of a number of
important T-cell target genes. Genes activated by NFAT
binding include that encoding interleukin 2, a cytokine pivotally important in the control of T cell proliferation.
The importance of the PLC1 pathway to T cell activation
is illustrated by the profound immunosuppressant effects of the
drug cyclosporine, which is used to treat both T-cell–mediated
autoimmune disease and organ transplant rejection. In T cells,
cyclosporine binds to the protein cyclophilin (immunophilin),
and the cyclosporine/cyclophilin complex binds and inhibits
calcineurin, effectively shutting down T-cell proliferation.
PIP2 cleavage by PLC is a particularly efficient signaling strategy as both products of PIP2 breakdown are active in subsequent
cellular events. DAG, the second product of PIP2 breakdown
(see Figure 3-12) remains in the membrane, where it binds and
activates enzymes of the protein kinase C (PKC) family. These
kinases are serine/threonine kinases active in a variety of signaling pathways. Protein kinase C, important in T-cell signaling,
only requires DAG binding, whereas its relative, protein kinase
C, must also bind Ca2 ions for full activation. DAG is also
implicated in the Ras pathway (described in the next section).

The Ras/Map Kinase Cascade Activates
Transcription Through AP-1
The Ras signaling pathway was discovered initially after a
mutated, viral form of the Ras protein was found to induce
cancer in a rat model. Ras is a monomeric, GTP-binding
protein (G protein, for short). When Ras binds to GTP, its
conformation changes into an active state, in which it is
capable of binding, and activating a number of serine/threonine kinases. However, the Ras protein possesses an intrinsic
GTPase activity that hydrolyzes GTP to GDP, and the Ras–
GDP form of the protein is incapable of transmitting a positive signal to downstream kinases (Figure 3-15). Activation
of the Ras pathway is therefore dependent on the ability to
maintain Ras in its GTP-bound state. Modulation between
the active, GTP-bound form and the inactive, GDP-bound
form is brought about by two families of enzymes. Guaninenucleotide Exchange Factors (GEFs) activate Ras by induc-

ing it to release GDP and accept GTP; GTPase Activating
Proteins (GAPs) inhibit the protein’s activity by stimulating
Ras’s intrinsic ability to hydrolyze bound GTP.
Like the PLC pathway, the Ras pathway is initiated during
both B and T lymphocyte activation and, again, we will use T
cells as our example. DAG, released after PLC1-mediated
PIP2 cleavage, binds and activates Ras-GRP, an adapter protein that then recruits the GEF, Son of Sevenless (SOS). SOS
binds to Ras, inducing it to bind GTP, at which point Ras gains
the ability to bind and activate the first member of a cascade
of serine/threonine kinase enzymes that phosphorylate and
activate one another. Because the members of this cascade
were first identified in experiments that studied the activation
of cells by mitogens (agents that induce proliferation), it is
referred to as the Mitogen Activated Protein Kinase or MAP
kinase cascade. The members of the cascade are held in close
proximity to one another by the adapter protein KSR.
In the T-cell activation form of this cascade (illustrated in
Figure 3-16), RasGTP binds to the MAP kinase kinase
kinase (MAPKKK) Raf. Binding of RasGTP alters the conformation of Raf and stimulates its serine/threonine kinase
activity. Raf then phosphorylates and activates the next
enzyme in the relay, a MAP kinase kinase (MAPKK), in this
case MEK. Activated MEK then phosphorylates its substrate,
Extracellular signal-Related Kinase, or Erk, a MAP kinase,
which consequently gains the ability to pass through the
nuclear membrane.
Once inside the nucleus, Erk phosphorylates and activates a transcription factor, Elk-1, which cooperates with a
second protein, serum response factor (SRF), to activate the
transcription of the fos gene. The Fos protein is also phosphorylated by Erk, and along with its partner, Jun, forms the
master transcription factor, AP-1. Jun is phosphorylated and
activated via a slightly different form of the MAP kinase
pathway. AP-1 is another of the transcription factors that
facilitates the transcription of the IL-2 gene.

FIGURE 3-16 The Ras pathway involves a cascade of serine/threonine phosphorylations and culminates in the entry
of the MAP kinase, Erk, into the nucleus where it phosphorylates the transcription factors Elk-1 and Fos.
The Ras pathway is an important component in many
developmental and cell activation programs. Each pathway
uses slightly different combinations of downstream protein
kinases, but all adhere to the same general mode of passing
the signal from the cell surface through to the nucleus via a
cascade of phosphorylation reactions, with the resultant
activation of a new transcriptional program.

PKC Activates the NF-B Transcription Factor
NF-␬B belongs to a family of heterodimeric transcription
factors, and each dimer activates its own repertoire of promoters. In resting cells, NF-B heterodimers are held in the

cytoplasm by binding to the Inhibitor of NF-␬B (I␬B) protein. Cell activation induces the phosphorylation of these
inhibitory proteins by an I␬B kinase (IKK) complex. The
phosphorylated IB protein is then targeted for proteasomal
degradation, releasing the freed NF-B to enter the nucleus
and bind to the promoters of a whole array of immunologically important genes.
NF-B is important in the transcription control of proteins needed for the proper functioning of many innate and
adaptive immune system cell types; in general, NF-Bmediated transcription is associated with proinflammatory
and activation events, rather than with regulatory processes. Different types of cells and receptors use various
forms of protein kinase activation as well as diverse combinations of adapter molecules in the pathway leading to
NF-B activation. However, all of these pathways culminate in the phosphorylation and subsequent destruction of
the inhibitor of NF-B, IB. Below, we describe the pathway to NF-B activation that is triggered by TCR antigen
recognition.

Introduction

In T cells, activation of NF-B begins when DAG, generated by PLC1, recruits the serine/threonine kinase PKC␪ to
the membrane (Figure 3-17). As mentioned above, PKC is
the form of the serine/threonine kinase that is used in the
T-cell receptor signaling pathway. Once bound to DAG,
PKC is activated and phosphorylates adapter proteins
including Carma1, initiating a cascade that ultimately recruits
the ubiquitin ligase TRAF6. TRAF6 ubiquitinates and partially activates the IKK complex, which is made up of the
regulatory protein NEMO, and two catalytic IKK subunits.
The IKK complex is fully activated only when it is both phosphorylated and ubiquitinated. (Note that this is one of those
instances in which ubiquitination does not result in subsequent protein degradation, but rather in its activation.) Other
T cell mediated signals activate the TAK1 complex, which
phosphorylates IKK, thus completing its activation and
allowing it to phosphorylate IB. In this step, phosphorylation of IB signals its degradation, rather than its activation.
NF-B is then free to move into the nucleus and activate the
transcription of its target genes, including the IL2 gene.
In addition to this T-cell receptor-mediated pathway of
NF-B activation, signaling through CD28, the T-cell coreceptor, also positively controls NF-B activation in T cells.
These three pathways together illustrate how the broad
concepts introduced earlier in this chapter can be applied to
understand the mechanisms underlying T-cell activation.
These themes recur in numerous forms throughout the
immune system.

The Structure of Antibodies
Having outlined some of the general concepts that underlie
many different receptor-ligand interactions and signaling
pathways, we now turn our attention more specifically to the
antigen receptors of the adaptive immune system.
On stimulation with antigen, B cells secrete antibodies
with antigen-binding sites identical to those on the B-cell
membrane antigen receptor. The identity between the binding sites of the secreted antibody and the membrane-bound
B-cell receptor (BCR) was first demonstrated by making
reagents that bound to antibodies secreted by a particular
clone of B cells and showing that those reagents also bound
to the receptors on the cells that had secreted the antibodies.
Since working with soluble proteins is significantly easier
than manipulating membrane receptor proteins, the presence of a soluble form of the receptor greatly facilitated the
characterization of B-cell receptor structure. Consequently,
the basic biochemistry of the B-cell receptor was established
long before that of the T-cell receptor (TCR), which, unlike
the BCR, is not released in a secreted form. Box 3-1: Classic
Experiment details the Nobel Prize–winning experiments
that established the four-chain structure of the antibody
molecule.
We begin this section with a discussion of antibody
structure, and then go on to describe the B-cell membrane

receptor and its associated signaling pathways. Secreted
antibodies and their membrane-bound receptor forms
belong to the immunoglobulin family of proteins. This large
family of proteins, which includes both B- and T-cell receptors, adhesion molecules, some tyrosine kinases, and other
immune receptors, is characterized by the presence of one
or more immunoglobulin domains.

Antibodies Are Made Up of Multiple
Immunoglobulin Domains
The immunoglobulin domain (Figure 3-18) is generated when
a polypeptide chain folds into an organized series of antiparallel -pleated strands. Within each domain, the  strands
are arranged into a pair of  sheets that form a tertiary, compact domain. The number of strands per sheet varies among
individual proteins. In antibody molecules, most immunoglobulin domains contain approximately 110 amino acids,
and each  sheet contains three to five strands. The pair of 
sheets within each domain are stabilized with respect to one
another by an intrachain disulfide bond. Neighboring domains
are connected to one another by a stretch of relatively unstructured polypeptide chain. Within the  strands, hydrophobic
and hydrophilic amino acids alternate and their side chains
are oriented perpendicular to the plane of the sheet. The
hydrophobic amino acids on one sheet are oriented toward
the opposite sheet, and the two sheets within each domain are
therefore stabilized by hydrophobic interactions between the
two sheets as well as by the covalent disulfide bond.
The immunoglobulin fold provides a perfect example of
how structure determines and/or facilitates function. At the
ends of each of the  sheets, more loosely folded polypeptide
regions link one  strand to the next, and these loosely folded
regions can accommodate a variety of amino acid side-chain
lengths and structures without causing any disruption to the
overall structure of the molecule. Hence, in the antibody molecule, the immunoglobulin fold is superbly adapted to provide
a single scaffold onto which multiple different binding sites can be
built, as the antigen-binding sites can simply be built into these
loosely folded regions of the antigen-binding domains. These
properties explain why the immunoglobulin domain has been
used in so many proteins with recognition or adhesive functions. The essential domain structure provides a molecular
backbone, while the loosely folded regions can be adapted to
bind specifically to many adhesive or antigenic structures.
Indeed, the immunoglobulin domain structure is used by
many proteins besides the BCR chains. As we will see later in
this chapter, the T-cell receptor is also made up of repeating
units of the immunoglobulin domain. Other proteins that
use immunoglobulin domains include Fc receptors; the
T-cell receptor accessory proteins CD2, CD4, CD8, and
CD28; the receptor-associated proteins of both the TCR and
the BCR; adhesion molecules; and others. Some of these
immunoglobulin domain-containing proteins are illustrated
in Figure 3-19. Each of these proteins is classified as a member

denote proteins derived from a common primordial gene
encoding the basic domain structure.

Antibodies Share a Common Structure of Two
Light Chains and Two Heavy Chains
All antibodies share a common structure of four polypeptide
chains (Figure 3-20), consisting of two identical light (L)
chains and two identical heavy (H) chains. Each light chain
is bound to its partner heavy chain by a disulfide bond
between corresponding cysteine residues, as well as by noncovalent interactions between the VH and VL domains and
the CH1 and CL domains. These bonds enable the formation

Hypervariable regions are usually called complementarity-determining
regions (CDRs). Heavy-chain domains have the same characteristic
structure. (b) The -pleated sheets are opened out to reveal the relationship of the individual  strands and joining loops. Note that the
variable domain contains two more  strands than the constant
domain. [Part (a) adapted from M. Schiffer et al., 1973, Biochemistry 12: 4620;

of a closely associated heterodimer (H-L). Multiple disulfide
bridges link the two heavy chains together about halfway
down their length, and the C-terminal parts of the two heavy
chains also participate in noncovalent bonding interactions
between corresponding domains.
As shown in Figure 3-21, the antibody molecule forms a
Y shape with two identical antigen-binding regions at the
tips of the Y. Each antigen-binding region is made up of
amino acids derived from both the heavy- and the lightchain amino-terminal domains. The heavy and light chains
both contribute two domains to each arm of the Y, with the
non–antigen-binding domain of each chain serving to
extend the antigen-binding arm. The base of the Y consists
of the C-terminal domains of the antibody heavy chain.

CLASSIC EXPERIMENT

The Elucidation of Antibody Structure

FIRST SET OF EXPERIMENTS
Arne Tiselius, Pers Pederson, Michael
Heidelberger, and Elvin Kabat
Since the late nineteenth century, it has
been known that antibodies reside in the
blood serum—that is, in that component of
the blood which remains once cells and
clotting proteins have been removed. However, the chemical nature of those antibodies remained a mystery until the experiments
of Tiselius and Pederson of Sweden and
Heidelberger and Kabat, in the United
States, published in 1939. They made use of
the fact that, when antibodies react with a
multivalent protein antigen, they form a
multimolecular cross-linked complex that
falls out of solution. This process is known as
immunoprecipitation (see Chapter 20 for
modern uses of this technique). They immunized rabbits with the protein ovalbumin
(the major component of egg whites), bled
the rabbits to obtain an anti-ovalbumin
antiserum, and then divided their antiserum
into two aliquots. They subjected the first
aliquot to electrophoresis, measuring the
amount of protein that moved different
distances from the origin in an electric field.
The blue plot in Figure 1 depicts the four
major protein subpopulations resolved by
their technique. The first, and largest, is the
albumin peak, the most abundant protein in
serum, with responsibility for transporting
lipids through the blood. They named the
other peaks globulins. Two smaller peaks are
denoted the  and  globulin peaks, and
then a third globulin peak,  globulin, clearly
represents a set of proteins in high concentration in the serum.
However, the most notable part of the
experiment occurred when the investigators mixed their second serum aliquot with
ovalbumin, the antigen. The antibodies in
the serum bound to ovalbumin in a multivalent complex, which fell out of solution
into a precipitate. The precipitate was then

82

removed by centrifugation. Now that they
had succeeded in removing the antibodies
from an antiserum, the question was,
which protein peak would be affected?
The black plot in Figure 1 illustrates
their results. Very little protein was lost from
the albumin, or the  or  globulin peaks.
However, immunoprecipitation resulted in
a dramatic decrease in the size of the 
globulin peak, demonstrating that the
majority of their anti-ovalbumin antibodies
could be classified as  globulins.
We now know that most antibodies of
the IgG class are indeed found in the 
globulin class. However, antibodies of
other classes are found in the  and 
globulin peaks, which may account for
the slight decrease in protein concentration found after immunoprecipitation in
these other protein peaks.

SECOND SET OF EXPERIMENTS
Sir Rodney Porter, Gerald Edelman,
and Alfred Nisonoff
Knowing the class of serum protein into
which antibodies fall was a start, but immunochemists next needed to figure out

what antibodies looked like. The fact that
they could form precipitable multivalent
complexes suggested that each antibody
was capable of binding to more than one
site on a multivalent antigen. But the scientists still did not know how many polypeptide chains made up an antibody molecule
and how many antigen-binding sites were
present in each molecule.
Two lines of experimentation conducted in a similar time frame on both
sides of the Atlantic combined to provide
the answers to these two questions. Ultracentrifugation experiments had placed the
molecular weight of IgG antibody molecules at approximately 150,000 Daltons.
Digestion of IgG with the enzyme papain
produced three fragments, two of which
were identical and a third which was clearly
different (Figure 2). The third fragment, of
approximately 50,000 Daltons, spontaneously formed crystals and was therefore
named Fragment crystallizable, or Fc. By
demonstrating that they could competitively inhibit the binding of antibodies to
their antigen, the other two fragments
were shown to retain the antigen-binding

The experiments that first identified antibodies as serum immunoglobulins and
then characterized their familiar four-chain
structure represent some of the most elegant adaptations of protein chemistry ever
used to solve a biological problem.

pooled and electrophoresed, which separated the serum proteins according to their electric charge
and mass. The blue line shows the electrophoretic pattern of untreated antiserum. The black line shows
the pattern of antiserum that was first incubated with OVA to remove anti-OVA antibody and then
subjected to electrophoresis. [Adapted from A. Tiselius and E. A. Kabat, 1939, Journal of Experimental Medicine

capacity of the original antibody. These
fragments were therefore named Fab, or
Fragment antigen binding. This experiment indicated that a single antibody molecule contained two antigen binding sites
and a third part of the molecule that did
not participate in the binding reaction.
Use of another proteolytic enzyme, pepsin, resulted in the formation of a single
fragment of 100,000 Daltons, which contained two antigen-binding sites that were
still held together in a bivalent molecule.
Because the molecule acted as though it
contained two Fab fragments, but clearly
had an additional component that facilitated the combination of the two fragments
into one molecule, it was named F(ab’)2.
Pepsin digestion does not result in a recoverable Fc fragment, as it apparently digests it
into small fragments. However, F(ab’)2 derivatives of antibodies are often used in experiments in which scientists wish to avoid
artifacts resulting from binding of antibodies to Fc receptors on cell surfaces.
In the second set of experiments, investigators reduced the whole IgG molecule
using -mercaptoethanol, in order to break
disulfide bonds, and alkylated the reduced
product so that the disulfide bonds could
not spontaneously reform. They then used
a technique called gel filtration to separate
and measure the size of the protein fragments generated by this reduction and
alkylation. (Nowadays, we would use SDS
PAGE gels to do this experiment.) In this
way, it was shown that each IgG molecule
contained two heavy chains, MW 50,000
and two light chains, MW 22,000.
Now the challenge was to combine
the results of these experiments to create a consistent model of the antibody
molecule. To do this, the scientists had to
determine which of the chains was implicated in antigen binding, and which
chains contributed to the crystallizable
fragments. Immunologists often use
immunological means to answer their
questions, and this was no exception.
They elected to use Fab and Fc fragments purified from rabbit IgG antibodies to immunize two separate goats.
From these goats, they generated antiFab and anti-Fc antibodies, which they
reacted, in separate experiments, with
the heavy and light chains from the

reduction and alkylation experiments.
The answer was immediately clear.
Anti-Fab antibodies bound to both
heavy and light chains, and therefore the
antigen binding site of the original rabbit
IgG was made up of both heavy and light
chain components. However, anti-Fc antibodies bound only to the heavy chains,
but not to the light chains of the IgG molecule, demonstrating that the Fc part of
the molecule was made up of heavy
chains only. Finally, careful protein chemistry demonstrated that the amino-termini
of the two chains resided in the Fab portion of the molecule. In this way, the familiar four-chain structure, with the binding
sites at the amino-termini of the heavy
and light chain pairs, was deduced from
some classically elegant experiments.
In 1972, Sir Rodney Porter and Gerald
Edelman were awarded the Nobel Prize
in Physiology and Medicine for their
work in discovering the structure of
immunoglobulins.

FIGURE 3-19 Some examples of proteins bearing immunoglobulin domains. Each immunoglobulin domain is depicted by a blue
loop and, where relevant, is labeled as variable (V) or constant (C).

Figure 3-21 further shows that the overall structure of the
antibody molecule consists of three relatively compact regions,
joined by a more flexible hinge region. The hinge region is particularly susceptible to proteolytic cleavage by the enzyme
papain. Papain cleavage resolves the antibody molecule into
two identical fragments that retain the antigen-binding specificity of the original antibody (shown as Fab regions in Figure
3-21), and the remaining region of the molecule, which consists
of the non antigen-binding portion. This latter region, which is
identical for all antibodies of a given class, crystallizes easily and
was thus called the Fc region (fragment crystallizable).

Each Fab region and Fc region of antibodies mediates its
own particular functions during an antibody response to
an antigen. The Fab regions bind to the antigen, and the Fc
region of the antigen-coupled antibody binds to Fc receptors on phagocytic or cytolytic cells, or to immune effector
molecules. In this way, antibodies serve as physiological
bridges between an antigen present on a pathogen, and
the cells or molecules that will ultimately destroy it. A family of Fc receptors exists; each Fc receptor is expressed on
a different array of cells and binds to a different class of
antibodies.

FIGURE 3-20 Schematic diagram of the structure of immunoglobulins derived from amino acid sequence analysis.
Each heavy (dark blue) and light (light blue) chain in an immunoglobulin molecule contains an amino-terminal variable (V) region
that consists of 100 to 110 amino acids and differs from one antibody to the next. The remainder of each chain in the molecule—
the constant (C) regions—exhibits limited variation that defines the
two light-chain subtypes and the five heavy-chain subclasses.
Some heavy chains (, 	, and ) also contain a proline-rich hinge
region. The amino-terminal portions, corresponding to the V
regions, bind to antigen; effector functions are mediated by the carboxy-terminal domains. The  and  heavy chains, which lack a hinge
region, contain an additional domain in the middle of the molecule.
CHO denotes a carbohydrate group linked to the heavy chain.

There are Two Major Classes of
Antibody Light Chains
Amino acid sequencing of antibody light chains revealed
that the amino-terminal half (approximately 110 amino
acids) of the light chain was extremely variable, whereas the
sequence of the carboxyl-terminal half could be classified
into one of two major sequence types. The N-terminal half
of light chains is thus referred to as the variable, or VL,
region of the light chain, and the less variable part of the
sequence is termed the constant, or CL, region. The two
major light chain constant region sequences are referred to
as ␬ (kappa) or ␭ (lambda) chains. As more light-chain
sequences were generated, it became apparent that the 
chain constant region sequences could be further subdivided
into four subtypes—1, 2, 3, and 4—based on amino
acid substitutions at a few positions. In humans, the light
chains are fairly evenly divided between the two light-chain
classes; 60% of human light chains are  whereas only 40%
are . In mice, the situation is quite different: Only 5% of
mouse light chains are of the  light-chain type. All light
chains have a molecular weight of approximately 22 kDa.
Further analysis of light-chain sequences demonstrated
that, even within the variable regions of the light chain, there

Clearly visible in this representation are the 110 amino acid immunoglobulin domains of which the molecule is constructed, along with

were regions of hypervariability. Since these hypervariable
regions could be shown to interact with the bound antigen,
they were renamed the complementarity-determining
regions, or CDRs.
Those readers with expertise in genetics will immediately
identify a problem: How is it possible to encode a single
protein chain with some regions that are extremely diverse
and other regions that are relatively constant, while maintaining that distinction across millions of years of evolutionary drift? The solution to this puzzle involves the encoding
of a single antibody variable region in multiple genetic segments that are then joined together in different combinations in each individual antibody-producing cell. This
unique mechanism will be fully described in Chapter 7.

There are Five Major Classes of
Antibody Heavy Chains
Using antibodies directed toward the constant region of immunoglobulins and amino acid sequencing of immunoglobulins
derived from plasmacytoma tumor cells, investigators discovered that the sequences of the heavy-chain constant regions fall
into five basic patterns. These five basic sequences have been
named with Greek letters:  (mu), 	 (delta),  (gamma), 
(epsilon), and  (alpha). Each different heavy-chain constant
region is referred to as an isotype, and the isotype of the heavy

chains of a given antibody molecule determines its class. Thus,
antibodies with a heavy chain of the  isotype are of the IgM
class; those with a 	 heavy chain are IgD; those with , IgG;
those with , IgE; and those with , IgA. The length of the
constant region of the heavy chains is either 330 amino acid
residues (for , 	, and  chains) or 440 amino acids (for  and

 chains). Correspondingly, the molecular weights of the heavy
chains vary according to their class. IgA, IgD, and IgG heavy
chains weigh approximately 55 kDa, whereas IgM and IgE
antibodies are approximately 20% heavier.
Minor differences in the amino acid sequences of groups
of  and  heavy chains led to further subclassification of
these heavy chains into sub-isotypes and their corresponding antibodies therefore into subclasses (Table 3-2). There
are two sub-isotypes of the  heavy chain, 1 and 2, and
thus two IgA subclasses, IgA1 and IgA2. Similarly, there are
four sub-isotypes of  heavy chains, 1, 2, 3, and 4, with
the corresponding formation of the four subclasses of IgG:
IgG1, IgG2, IgG3, and IgG4. In mice, the four  chain subisotypes are 1, 2, 2, and 3, and the corresponding
subclasses of mouse IgG antibodies are IgG1, IgG2a, IgG2b,
and IgG3, respectively.
Further analysis revealed that the exact number, and precise positions of the disulfide bonds between the heavy
chains of antibodies, vary among antibodies of different
classes and subclasses (Figure 3-22).

Antibodies and Antibody Fragments
Can Serve as Antigens
The essential principles of antibody structure were established prior to the development of the technology required
to artificially generate monoclonal antibodies, and indeed

much of the basic work of structure determination was
completed before techniques were available for rapid DNA
sequencing. As a source of homogenous antibodies, immunologists therefore turned to the protein products of antibody-secreting tumors. Plasmacytomas are tumors of
plasma cells, the end-stage cell of B-cell differentiation, and
the cells from that tumor are normally located in the bone
marrow. When a single clone of plasma cells becomes cancerous, it is called a plasmacytoma for as long as it remains
in a single bone. However, once it metastasizes into multiple bone marrow sites, the tumor is referred to as multiple
myeloma. Plasmacytoma or myeloma tumors secrete large
amounts of monoclonal antibodies into the serum and tissue fluids of the patients, and these antibodies can be purified in large quantities. Rather than secreting the whole
antibody, some of these tumors will secrete only the light
chains, or sometimes both the light chains and the whole
antibodies, into the serum. The homogenous light chains
secreted by these myeloma tumors are referred to as
Bence-Jones proteins.
In the middle to late twentieth century, tumor-derived
antibodies were used to generate a great deal of information
regarding antibody structure and sequence. When a means
was developed by which to generate these tumors artificially
in mice, data from human tumors were supplemented with
information derived from laboratory-generated murine cell
lines, many of which are still in use to this day.
Both tumor-derived and purified serum antibodies
were also used as antigens, and the anti-immunoglobulin
antibodies so derived proved to be extraordinarily useful
in the elucidation of antibody structure. Antibodies, or
antibody fragments derived from one animal species (for
example, a rabbit), can be injected into a second species

IgD heavy chains contain four domains and a hinge region, whereas
the IgM and IgE heavy chains contain five domains but no hinge
region. The polymeric forms of IgM and IgA contain a polypeptide,

called the J chain, that is linked by two disulfide bonds to the Fc
region in two different monomers. Serum IgM is always a pentamer;
most serum IgA exists as a monomer, although dimers, trimers, and
even tetramers are sometimes present. Not shown in these figures
are intrachain disulfide bonds and disulfide bonds linking light and
heavy chains (see Figure 3-23).

(for example, a goat), or even into another animal of the
same species, in which the antibody or antibody fragment
will serve as an antigen. Box 3-1 describes the series of
experiments in which antibodies made against isolated
proteolytic fragments of immunoglobulin molecules were
used to help determine immunoglobulin structure. To
understand these experiments, and many others that also
use antibodies directed against whole immunoglobulins or
against immunoglobulin fragments, it is important to have
a good grasp of the nature of the antigenic determinants
on immunoglobulin molecules. An antigenic determinant is defined as a region of an antigen that makes con-

tact with the antigen-combining region on an antibody.
The different types of antibodies that recognize immunoglobulin determinants are described in Table 3-3.
Anti-isotype antibodies are directed against antigenic
determinants present on the constant region of one particular heavy- or light-chain class of antibody, but not on
any of the others. For example, an anti-isotype antibody
may bind only to human  heavy chains, but not to human
	, , , or  constant regions. Alternatively, it may bind to
 but not to  light chains. Thus, an anti-isotype antibody
binds only to a single antibody constant region class or
subclass. Anti-isotype antibodies are usually specific for

Introduction

Antibodies that recognize other antibodies

What it recognizes

Anti-Fab (Fragment, antigen-binding)

Papain-generated fragment of antibodies consisting of the VHCH1–VLCL domains

Anti-Fc (Fragment, crystallizable)

Papain-generated fragment of antibodies consisting of the paired CH2CH3 (and, for IgM
and IgE, CH4) domains

Anti-isotype

Antigenic determinants specific to each heavy chain class

Anti-allotype

Antigenic determinants that are allele specific—small differences in the constant region
of light and heavy chains that vary among individuals

Anti-idiotype

Antigenic determinants characteristic of a particular antigen combining site. Each antibody will have its own characteristic idiotypic determinants made up of residues from
the heavy and light chains that contribute to the antigen-binding regions.

determinants present on the constant region of antibodies from a particular species of animal, although some
cross-reactivity among related species—for example, mice
and rats—may occur.
Some heavy- or light-chain genes occur in multiple allelic
forms, and alternative allelic forms of the same isotype are
referred to as allotypes. Generally, two antibodies with allotypic differences will vary in just a few residues of one of the
immunoglobulin chains, and these residues constitute the
allotypic determinants. Anti-allotype antibodies are
generated by immunizing an individual of one species with
antibodies derived from a second animal of the same species
bearing an alternative form (allele) of the particular immunoglobulin gene. After an immune response has occurred,
the investigator purifies or selects those antibodies that recognize the allotypic determinants from the immunized individual. Anti-allotype antibodies are used, for example, to
trace particular cell populations in experiments in which B
cells from a strain of animals bearing a particular allotype
are transferred into a second strain that differs in immunoglobulin allotype.
Finally, antibodies directed against the antigen-binding
site of a particular antibody are referred to as anti-idiotypic
antibodies. They can be generated by immunizing an animal
with large quantities of a purified monoclonal antibody,
which, by definition, bears a single antigen-binding site.
Those antibodies from the immunized animal that recognize
the antigen-binding site of the original antibody can then be
purified. Anti-idiotypic antibodies were used in the initial
experiments that proved that the B-cell receptor had the
same antigen-binding site as the antibody secreted by that B
cell, and they are now used to follow the fate of B cells bearing a single receptor specificity in immuno-localization
experiments.
As described above, treatment of whole antibody molecules with the enzyme papain cleaves the antibody molecule at the hinge region and releases two antigen-binding

Fab fragments and one Fc fragment per antibody molecule.
Anti-Fab antibodies and anti-Fc antibodies are made by
immunizing a different species of animal from that which
provided the antibody fragments with Fab or Fc fragments,
respectively.

Each of the Domains of the Antibody Heavy
and Light Chains Mediate Specific Functions
Antibodies protect the host against infection, by binding to
pathogens and facilitating their elimination. Antibodies of
different heavy-chain classes are specialized to mediate particular protective functions, such as complement activation
(Chapter 6), pathogen agglutination, or phagocytosis (Chapter 13), and each different domain of the antibody molecule
plays its own part in these host defense mechanisms. Here we
briefly examine the structure of each of the antibody heavychain domains in turn, beginning with the CH1 and CL
domains, which are those proximal to the VH and VL domains
respectively (see Figure 3-20).
CH1 and CL Domains
As discussed above, the strength (avidity) of receptor binding to antigen is greatly enhanced by receptor multivalency.
Antibodies have evolved to take advantage of this property
by employing two antigen-binding sites, each of which can
bind to individual determinants on multivalent antigens,
such as are found on bacterial surfaces. The CH1 and CL
domains serve to extend the antigen-binding arms of the
antibody molecule, facilitating interactions with multivalent antigens and maximizing the ability of the antibody to
bind to more than one site on a multivalent antigen. An
interchain disulfide bond between these two domains
holds them together and may facilitate the ability of some
VH-VL pairs to hold on to one another and form a stable
combining site.

FIGURE 3-23 General structure of the four subclasses of human IgG, which differ in the number and arrangement of the interchain disulfide bonds (thick black lines) linking the heavy chains. A notable feature of human IgG3 is its 11 interchain disulfide bonds.

The Hinge Regions
The , 	, and  heavy chains contain an extended peptide
sequence between the CH1 and CH2 domains that has no
homology with the other domains (see Figures 3-20 and
3-22). This so-called hinge region is rich in proline residues,
rendering it particularly flexible, and as a consequence, the
two antigen-binding arms of IgG, IgD, and IgA antibodies
can assume a wide variety of angles with respect to one

another, which facilitates efficient antigen binding. The
extended nature of the amino acid chain in the hinge region
contributes to the vulnerability of this part of the molecule
to protease cleavage, a vulnerability that was ingeniously
exploited in the early experiments that characterized antibody structure (see Box 3-1).
In addition to these proline residues, the hinge region
also contains a number of cysteines, which participate in
heavy-chain dimerization. The actual number of interchain
disulfide bonds in the hinge region varies considerably
among different heavy-chain classes and subclasses of antibodies (Figure 3-23) as well as between species. Lacking a
hinge region, the heavy chains of IgE make their inter-heavy
chain disulfide bonds between the CH1 and CH3 domains. In
IgM, disulfide bonds bridge the pairs of heavy chains at the
level of CH3 and CH4. Although  and 
 chains have no
hinge regions, they do have an additional immunoglobulin
domain that retains some hingelike qualities.
Carbohydrate Chains
The two CH2 domains of , 	, and  chains and the two CH3
domains of  and 
 chains are separated from their partner
heavy-chain domains by oligosaccharide side chains that prevent the two heavy chains from nestling close to one another
(Figure 3-24). As a result, the paired domains are significantly
more accessible to the aqueous environment than other constant region domains. This accessibility is thought to contribute to the ability of IgM and IgG antibodies to bind to
complement components. Immunoglobulins are in general
quite extensively glycosylated, and some antibodies even have
carbohydrates attached to their light chains.

have a hydrophilic amino acid sequence of various lengths at
the carboxyl terminus of the final CH domain. In membranebound immunoglobulin receptors, this hydrophilic region is
replaced by three regions (Figure 3-25):

X-ray Crystallography Has Been Used to
Define the Structural Basis of AntigenAntibody Binding

• An extracellular, hydrophilic “spacer” sequence of
approximately 26 amino acids
• A hydrophobic transmembrane segment of about 25
amino acids
• A very short, approximately three amino acid,
cytoplasmic tail

Crystallography has been used to explore the nature of
antigen-antibody binding for a large number of antibodies
and has demonstrated that either or both chains might provide the majority of contact residues with any one antigen.
Thus, some antibodies bind to the antigen mainly via contacts with heavy-chain variable region residues, with the
light chain merely providing structural support to the binding site; for other antigen-antibody interactions, the opposite is true. Still other antibodies use residues from both
chains to directly contact the antigen. In most cases, though,
contacts between antigen and antibody occur over a broad
face and protrusions or depressions in the antibody surface
are likely to be matched by complementary depressions or
protrusions in the antigen. Figure 3-26 illustrates the binding of an antibody to the tip of the influenza hemagglutinin
molecule. In another well-studied case of an antibody binding to the protein lysozyme, the surface area of interaction
was shown to be quite large, ranging in different antibodylysozyme pairs from 650 to 900 square Angstroms. Given the
tight binding between an antibody and its complementary
antigen, it should not be surprising that, at least in some
cases, binding of antigen to antibody induces a conformational change in the antibody, which can be visualized by
x-ray crystallography (Figure 3-27).

B cells express different classes of membrane immunoglobulin at particular developmental stages and under different stimulatory conditions. Immature, pre-B cells express
only membrane IgM. Membrane IgD co-expression along
with IgM is one of the markers of differentiation to a fully
mature B cell that has yet to encounter antigen. Following
antigen stimulation, IgD is lost from the cell surface, and the
constant region of the membrane and secreted immunoglobulin can switch to any one of the other isotypes. The
antibody class secreted by antigen-stimulated B cells is
determined by cytokines released by T cells and antigen
presenting cells in the vicinity of the activated B cell. Antibodies of different heavy-chain classes have selective affinities for particular cell surface Fc receptors, as well as for
components of the complement system. The effector functions of particular antibody classes are further discussed in
Chapters 6 and 13.

Molecular Biology 267:1207; courtesy of G. Bentley, Institute Pasteur.]

Signal Transduction in B Cells
Having described the structure of antibody molecules and their
membrane-bound form, the B-cell receptor (BCR), we now
turn our attention to BCR function. Recall that the structure of

the BCR is identical to that of the antibodies that the cell will
secrete on antigen stimulation, with the exception of the
C-terminal portion of the heavy chain; this portion is modified
so as to anchor the receptor into the B-cell plasma membrane.
Prior to antigen recognition, mature B cells residing in the
secondary lymphoid tissues, such as the spleen or lymph
nodes, express membrane-bound forms of both IgM and IgD.
As described above, the cytoplasmic tail of the BCR heavy
chain is extremely short—only three amino acids—and so one
of the puzzles that had to be solved by those exploring BCRmediated antigen activation was how such a short cytoplasmic
tail could efficiently pass a signal into the cytoplasm. This
problem was solved when co-immunoprecipitation experiments revealed that each BCR molecule was noncovalently
associated with a heterodimer, Ig/Ig (see Figure 3-7a), that
is responsible for transducing the antigen signal into the interior of the cell. Recall that Ig/Ig chains contain ITAMs,
which include tyrosine residues that become phosphorylated
on activation through the receptor, and serve as docking residues for downstream signaling components. The BCR is
therefore structurally and functionally divided into two components: a recognition component (the immunoglobulin
receptor) and a signal transduction component (Ig/Ig).
In previous sections of this chapter, we described some
general principles of signal transduction and outlined three
commonly employed signal transduction pathways (see Overview Figure 3-5). In this section, we show how those principles
apply to the intracellular events that follow upon antigenreceptor interactions in B cells.

BCAP and CD19 recruit PI3 kinase to the membrane with generation of PIP3 and subsequent localization of PDK1 and Akt to the
membrane. Phosphorylation by Akt enhances cell survival and
leads to activation of the transcription factors NF-B and CREB as

described. Activation of the B cell isoform of PLC, PLC2 occurs

receptor heavy chains. Interactions between neighboring
receptor molecules through these domains seed receptor
oligomerization (formation of small clusters of antigenreceptor complexes) and subsequent movement of these
receptor clusters into specialized lipid raft regions of the B-cell
membrane. There, the ITAM residues of Ig/Ig are brought
into close proximity with the Src-family kinases Lyn (Figure 3-28), Fyn, and Blk. Tyrosine phosphorylation of the
Ig/Ig ITAM residues by these Src-family kinases, particularly Lyn, then provides attachment sites for the adapter protein BLNK and an additional tyrosine kinase, Syk, which is
phosphorylated and activated by the Src-family kinases. Syk

then phosphorylates BLNK, providing docking sites for multiple downstream components of the signaling pathway. The
adapter protein BCAP and CD19, the B-cell co-receptor, are
also phosphorylated by these tyrosine kinases and serve to
recruit the enzyme PI3 kinase to the plasma membrane.

B Cells Use Many of the Downstream Signaling
Pathways Described Above
The downstream signaling pathways used by the BCR will now
be familiar. The tyrosine kinases Syk and Btk together phosphorylate and activate PLC2, which hydrolyzes PIP2, as

described above. The resultant increase in intracytoplasmic
Ca2 concentrations induces the activation of calcineurin and
the movement of NFAT into the nucleus (see Figure 3-14). The
other product of PIP2 hydrolysis, DAG (see Figure 3-12),
remains in the membrane and binds the B-cell isoform of protein kinase C, leading to the phosphorylation and release of the
NF-B inhibitor as described above for T cells (see Figure 3-17).
This results in the nuclear localization and activation of NFB.
Additional downstream effector pathways elicit the many
other changes that take place upon B-cell activation. For
example, PI3 kinase, now localized at the membrane, phosphorylates PIP2 to PIP3 (see Figure 3-11), allowing the
recruitment of the PH domain–containing proteins PDK1
and Akt. On phosphorylation by the serine-threonine kinase
PDK1, Akt promotes cell survival by phosphorylating and
inactivating pro-apoptotic molecules such as Bax and Bad. It
also phosphorylates and further activates the transcription
factors NF-B and CREB, which both support proliferation,
differentiation, and survival functions of the activated B cells.
The MAP kinase pathway (see Figure 3-16) is also activated during B-cell activation. Grb2 attachment to BLNK

brings about the binding of the GEF SOS, followed by the
binding and activation of Ras, as described above. Similarly,
Rac, another small monomeric G protein of the Ras family,
is activated by binding to the GEF protein Vav. Ras and Rac
are both small G proteins that act to initiate MAP kinase
signaling pathways. As described above, activation of the
MAP kinase pathway culminates in the expression of the
phosphorylated transcription factor Elk. In B cells, Elk promotes the synthesis of the transcription factor Egr-1, which
acts to induce alterations in the cell-surface expression of
important adhesion molecules, and ultimately serves to aid
B lymphocyte migration into and within the secondary lymphoid tissues. Downstream effectors from Rac promote actin
polymerization, further facilitating B-cell motility.
In conclusion, antigen binding at the BCR leads to multiple changes in transcriptional activity, as well as in the
localization and motility of B cells, which together result in
their enhanced survival, proliferation, differentiation, and
eventual antibody secretion. As exemplified in Box 3-2,
defects in proteins involved in B-cell signaling can lead to
immunodeficiencies.

Box 3-2

CLINICAL FOCUS

Defects in the B-Cell Signaling Protein Btk Lead to X-Linked
Agammaglobulinemia
The characterization of the proteins necessary for B- and T-cell signaling
opened up new avenues of exploration
for clinicians working with patients suffering from immunodeficiency disorders. Clinicians and immunogeneticists now work
closely together to diagnose and treat
patients with immunodeficiencies, to the
benefit of both the clinical and the basic
sciences.
Characterization of the genes responsible for disorders of the immune system is
complicated by the fact that antibody
deficiencies may result from defective
genes encoding either T- or B-cell proteins
(since T cells provide helper factors necessary for B-cell antibody production), or even
from mutations in genes encoding proteins
in stromal cells important for healthy B-cell
development in the bone marrow. However, no matter what the cause, all antibody
deficiencies manifest clinically in increased
susceptibility to bacterial infections, particularly those of the lung, intestines, and (in
younger children) the ear.

In 1952, a pediatrician, Ogden Bruton,
reported in the journal Pediatrics the case
of an eight-year-old boy who suffered from
multiple episodes of pneumonia. When
the serum of the boy was subjected to
electrophoresis, it was shown to be completely lacking in serum globulins, and his
disease was therefore named agammaglobulinemia. This was the first immunodeficiency disease for which a laboratory
finding explained the clinical symptoms,
and the treatment that Bruton applied—
administering subcutaneous injections of
gamma globulin—is still used today. As
similar cases were subsequently reported,
it was noted that most of the pediatric
cases of agammaglobulinemia occurred in
boys, whereas when the disease was
reported in adults, both men and women
appeared to be similarly affected. Careful
mapping of the disease susceptibility to
the X chromosome resulted in the pediatric form of the disease being named XLA,
for X-linked agammaglobulinemia.
With the characterization of the BCR
signal transduction pathway components

in the 1980s and 1990s came the opportunity to define which proteins are damaged
or lacking in particular immunodeficiency
syndromes. In 1993, 41 years after the initial
description of the disease, two groups
independently reported that many cases
of XLA resulted from mutations in a cytoplasmic tyrosine kinase called Bruton’s tyrosine kinase, or Btk; at this point, we now
know that fully 85% of patients affected
with XLA have mutations in the Btk gene.
Btk is a member of the Tec family of
cytoplasmic tyrosine kinases, which are
predominantly expressed in hematopoietic
cells. Tec family kinases share a C-terminal
kinase domain, preceded by SH2 and SH3
domains, a proline-rich domain, and an
amino-terminal PH domain, capable of
binding to PIP3 phospholipids generated by
PI3 kinase activity. Btk is expressed in both B
cells and platelets and is activated following
signaling through the BCR, the pre-BCR
(which is expressed in developing B cells),
the IL-5 and IL-6 receptors, and also the
CXCR4 chemokine receptor. Its involvement in pre-BCR signaling explains why

children with XLA suffer from defective
B-cell development.
Following activation, Btk moves to the
inner side of the plasma membrane, where
it is phosphorylated and partially activated
(see Figure 3-28). Activation is completed
when it autophosphorylates itself at a second phosphorylation site. Btk binds to the
adapter protein BLNK, along with PLC2.
Btk then phosphorylates and activates
PLC2, leading, as described, to calcium
flux and activation of the NF-B and NFAT
pathways. Btk therefore occupies a central
position in B-cell activation, and it is no
surprise that mutations in its gene result in
such devastating consequences.
Over 600 different mutations have
been identified in the btk gene, with the
vast majority of these resulting from single base pair substitutions, or the insertion or deletion of less than five base pairs.
As for other X-linked mutations that are
lethal without medical intervention, XLA
disease is maintained in the population by
the generation of new mutations.
Patients with XLA are usually healthy in
the neonatal (immediately after birth)
period, when they still benefit from maternal antibodies. However, recurrent bacterial infections begin between the ages of
3 months and 18 months, and currently
the mean age at diagnosis in North
America is 3 years. XLA is a so-called “leaky”
defect; almost all children with mutations
in btk have some serum immunoglobulin,
and a few B cells in the peripheral circulation. The prognosis for patients who are
treated with regular doses of gamma
globulin has improved dramatically over
the last 25 years, with the use of prophylactic injections of gamma globulin.

The B cells in patients with XLA have a
distinctive phenotype that can be used for
diagnostic purposes. CD19 expression is
low and variable in patients with XLA,
whereas membrane IgM expression, normally variable in mature B cells, is relatively
high and consistent in patients with XLA.
This phenotype can be observed in Figure
1, which shows the flow cytometric profiles of a normal control individual (left two
graphs) and a patient with a defective btk
gene (right two graphs). In the top two
plots, we note that the XLA patient has
very few CD19 B cells compared with
the control and that the levels of CD19 on
the surface of those B cells that do exist are
lower than those of the control cells. In the
lower two plots, we note that, although

there are fewer CD19 B cells overall in the
btk-compromised patient, all of those
CD19 B cells have relatively high levels of
surface IgM, whereas the levels of membrane IgM are much more variable in the
healthy controls.

B Cells Also Receive Signals Through
Co-Receptors
The immunoglobulin receptor on the B cell membrane is
noncovalently associated with three transmembrane molecules: CD19, CD21, and CD81 (TAPA-1) (see Figure 3-7a).
Antigens are sometimes presented to the BCR already covalently bound to complement proteins, in particular to the
complement component C3d. (The complement cascade is

discussed in Chapter 6.) The B-cell co-receptor CD21 specifically binds to C3d, on C3d-coated antigens. This coengagement of the BCR and CD21 brings the co-receptor
and the BCR into close apposition with one another. When
this happens, tyrosine residues on the cytoplasmic face of
the co-receptor become phosphorylated by the same
enzymes that phosphorylate the ITAMs on Ig/Ig, providing sites of attachment for PI3 kinase. As illustrated in Figure
3-28, localization of PI3 kinase to the co-receptor enhances

both cell survival and the alterations in the transcriptional
program that accompany cell activation. CD19 also serves as
an additional site of recruitment of PLC.

T-Cell Receptors and Signaling
T cells bind complex antigens made up of peptides located
in the groove of membrane-bound MHC proteins. When
the T-cell receptor makes contact with its MHC-peptide
antigen on the surface of an antigen-presenting cell, the
two cell membranes are brought into close apposition with
one another. This adds an additional layer of complexity to
the process of T-cell activation that finds no parallel in
B-cell signaling. Notwithstanding this additional complexity, the events of T-cell activation still unfold according to
a mix of the strategies described above, and bear many
similarities to B-cell receptor signaling. Here, we briefly
describe T-cell receptor structure and then turn to a characterization of the signaling routes through this receptor.
In Box 3-3, we provide a description of the experiments
that resulted in the isolation and characterization of the
TCR.

The T-Cell Receptor is a Heterodimer with
Variable and Constant Regions
There are two types of T-cell receptors, both of which are
heterodimers (dimers made up of two different polypeptides). The majority of recirculating T cells bear  heterodimers, which bind to ligands made up of an antigenic
peptide presented in a molecular groove on the surface of
a type I or type II MHC molecule. A second subset of T
cells instead expresses a heterodimeric T-cell receptor
composed of a different pair of protein chains, termed 
and 	. T cells bearing 	 receptors have particular localization patterns (often in mucosal tissues) and some 	 T cells
recognize different types of antigens from those bound by
 T cells. Although some 	 T cells recognize conventional MHC-presented peptide antigens, other 	 T cells
bind lipid or glycolipid moieties presented by noncanonical
MHC molecules. Yet other 	 T-cell clones appear to recognize self-generated heat shock proteins or phosphoantigens derived from microbes. A unified theory of the
precise nature of antigens recognized by 	 T cells remains
elusive. However, this ability of 	 T cells to break the rules
of MHC restriction may account for the evolution of a
slight difference in the angle between the antigen-binding
and constant regions of the T-cell receptor, which is apparent in an x-ray crystallographic analysis of the two types of
receptor (Figure 3-29). Notwithstanding these functional
differences in the  versus the 	 receptors, their essential
biochemistry is quite similar.
For the remainder of this chapter, we focus on the structure and signaling of the dominant  TCR type, recognizing

that minor differences may exist between the two types of
receptors and their downstream components.
Although the TCR is not an immunoglobulin per se, the
TCR proteins are members of the immunoglobulin superfamily of proteins and therefore the domain structures of
 and 	 TCR heterodimers are strikingly similar to
those of the immunoglobulins (see Figure 3-19). The 
chain has a molecular weight of 40–50 kDa, and the 
chain’s is 40–45 kDa. Like the antibody light chains, the
TCR chains have two immunoglobulin-like domains, each
of which contains an intrachain disulfide bond spanning 60
to 75 amino acids. The C domain of the TCR differs from
most immunoglobulin domains in that it possesses only a
single  sheet, rather than a pair, and the remainder of the
sequence is more variably folded. The amino-terminal
(variable) domain in both chains exhibits marked sequence
variation, but the sequences of the remainder of each chain
are conserved (constant). Each of the TCR variable domains
has three hypervariable regions, which appear to be equivalent to the complementarity-determining regions (CDRs)
in immunoglobulin light and heavy chains. A fourth
hypervariable region on the TCR chain does not appear
to contact antigen, and its functional significance is therefore uncertain.
At the C-terminal end of the constant domain, each
TCR chain contains a short connecting sequence, in which
a cysteine residue forms a disulfide link with the other
chain of the heterodimer. C-terminal to this disulfide is a
transmembrane region of 21 or 22 amino acids, which
anchors each chain in the plasma membrane. The transmembrane domains of the TCR  and  chains are unusual
in that they each contain positively charged amino acid
residues that promote interaction with corresponding
negatively charged residues on the chains of the signaltransducing CD3 complex. Finally, like BCRs, each TCR
chain contains only a very short cytoplasmic tail at the
carboxyl-terminal end.

that the BCR was simply a membranebound form of the secreted antibody,
the elucidation of BCR structure became
a significantly more tractable problem.

BOX 3-3
hybridomas—made the analysis of the
TCR more technically feasible.
A hybridoma is a fusion product of two
cells. B-cell hybridomas are generated by
artificially fusing antibody-producing,
short-lived lymphocytes with long-lived
tumor cells in order to generate long-lived
daughter cells secreting large amounts of
monoclonal antibodies. (The term monoclonal refers to the fact that all of the cells
in a given hybridoma culture are derived
from the single clone of cells, and therefore carry the same DNA; details of the
technology are described in Chapter 20.)
Although this technique was first developed for the generation of long-lived B
cells, scientists working in the laboratory
of John Kappler and Philippa Marrack also
applied it to T lymphocytes.
The researchers began by immunizing
a mouse with the protein ovalbumin
(OVA), allowing OVA-specific T cells to
divide and differentiate for a few days, and
then harvesting the lymph nodes from
the immunized animal. To enrich their
starting population with as many OVAspecific T cells as possible, they cultured
the harvested lymph node cells in vitro
with OVA for several hours (Figure 1, step 1).

7

After some time in culture, they fused
these activated, OVA-specific T cells with
cells derived from a T-cell tumor (Figure 1,
step 2), thus generating a number of
long-lived T-cell hybridoma cultures
that recognized OVA peptides in the context of the MHC of the original mouse, an
MHC allele called H-2d. They then diluted
out the fused cells in each culture, generating several T-cell hybridoma lines in
which all the cells in an individual hybridoma line derived from the product of a
single fusion event (Figure 1, step 3). This
is referred to as cloning by limiting dilution. In this way, they isolated a T-cell
hybridoma that expressed a TCR capable
of recognizing a peptide from OVA, in the
context of MHC Class 2 proteins from
mice of the H-2d strain.
These T cells could now be used as
antigens and injected into a mouse (Figure
1, step 4). The spleen of this mouse was
removed a few days later, and the mouse B
cells were fused with B lineage tumor cells
(Figure 1, step 5). After culturing to stabilize
the hybrids, the investigators cloned the
B-cell hybridomas and selected a B-cell
hybridoma line that produced monoclonal
antibodies that bound specifically to the

T-cell hybridoma (Figure 1, step 6). Most
important, these antibodies interfered with
the T cell’s ability to recognize its cognate
antigen (Figure 1, step 7). The fact that this
monoclonal antibody inhibited TCR antigen binding suggested that the antibody
was binding directly to the receptor, and
competing with the antigen for TCR binding. They then used these antibodies to
immunoprecipitate the TCR from detergent-solubilized membrane preparations
and purify the TCR protein (Figure 1, step 8).
Concurrent with these experiments,
the laboratories of Stephen Hedrick and
Mark Davis at NIH and Tak Mak in Toronto
had been making headway searching for
the genes encoding the T-cell receptor.
These experiments, as well as subsequent
work by Susumu Tonegawa, which completed the identification of the TCR genes,
are described in detail in Chapter 7.

Introduction

The T-Cell Signal Transduction Complex
Includes CD3
Just as B-cell signaling requires the participation of the
Ig/Ig signal transduction complex, signaling through the
TCR depends on a complex of proteins referred to collectively
as CD3 (Figure 3-30). The CD3 complex is made up of three
dimers: a 	 (delta epsilon) pair, a  (gamma epsilon) pair,
and a third pair that is made up either of two CD3 (zeta)
(a)

/Volumes/203/MHR00209/siL52070/disk1of1/0071052070

molecules or a  (zeta, eta) heterodimer. (Note that the CD3
 and 	 chains are different from the chains that make up the
	 TCR.) Like Ig and Ig, the cytoplasmic tails of the CD3
molecules are studded with ITAM sequences that serve as
docking sites for adapter proteins following activationinduced tyrosine phosphorylation. Each of the CD3 dimers
contains negatively charged amino acids in its transmembrane
domain that form ionic bonds with the positively charged
residues on the intramembrane regions of the T-cell receptor.

The T-cell receptor is noncovalently associated with a
number of accessory molecules on the cell surface (Table
3-4). However, the only two such molecules that also recognize the MHC-peptide antigen are CD4 and CD8. Recall
that mature T cells can be subdivided into two populations
according to their expression of CD4 or CD8 on the
plasma membrane. CD4 T cells recognize peptides that
are combined with class II MHC molecules, and function
primarily as helper or regulatory T cells, whereas CD8 T
cells recognize antigen that is expressed on the surface of
class I MHC molecules, and function mainly as cytotoxic
T cells.
CD4 is a 55 kDa monomeric membrane glycoprotein
that contains four extracellular immunoglobulin-like
domains (D1–D4), a hydrophobic transmembrane region,
and a long cytoplasmic tail containing three serine residues that can be phosphorylated (Figure 3-31). CD8 takes
the form of a disulfide-linked  heterodimer or 
homodimer. (These are not the same as the  and 
chains that constitute the TCR heterodimer.) Both the 
and  chains of CD8 are small glycoproteins of approximately 30 to 38 kDa. Each chain consists of a single,
extracellular, immunoglobulin-like domain, a stalk
region, a hydrophobic transmembrane region, and a cytoplasmic tail containing 25 to 27 residues, several of which
can be phosphorylated.
The extracellular domains of CD4 and CD8 bind to conserved regions of MHC class II and MHC class I molecules
respectively (see Figure 3-7b). The co-engagement of a single
MHC molecule by both the TCR and its CD4 or CD8 coreceptor enhances the avidity of T-cell binding to its target.
This co-engagement also brings the cytoplasmic domains of
the TCR/CD3 and the respective co-receptor into close
proximity, and it helps to initiate the cascade of intracellular
events that activate a T cell.

Signaling through the antigen receptor, even when combined with that through CD4 or CD8, is insufficient to activate a T cell that has had no prior contact with antigen (a
naïve T cell). A naïve T cell needs to be simultaneously signaled through the TCR and its co-receptor, CD28, in order
to be activated. The TCR and CD28 molecules on a naïve T
cell must co-engage the MHC-presented peptide and the
CD28 ligand, CD80 (or CD86), respectively, on the antigenpresenting cell for full activation to occur. The signaling
events mediated through CD28, which include the stimulation of interleukin 2 synthesis by the T cell, were alluded to
above and are discussed fully in Chapter 11.

Lck is the First Tyrosine Kinase Activated
in T Cell Signaling
When the T-cell receptor interacts with its cell-bound antigen, receptors, co-receptors, and signaling molecules cluster
into the cholesterol-rich lipid rafts of the plasma membrane
(Figure 3-32). The Src-family tyrosine kinase Lck is normally
found associated with CD4 and CD8, and the association
between Lck and CD4 is particularly close. Antigen-induced
clustering of the receptor–co-receptor complex brings Lck
into the vicinity of the membrane-associated tyrosine phosphatase, CD45, which removes the inhibitory phosphate
group on Lck. Reciprocal phosphorylation by nearby Lck
molecules at their activating tyrosine sites (see Figure 3-9)
then induces Lck to phosphorylate CD3 ITAM residues.
(Note that these early events parallel those induced in B cells
by the Src-family kinase Lyn, which is also regulated by the
phosphatase activity of CD45.)
Once the CD3 ITAMs are phosphorylated, a second tyrosine kinase, ZAP-70, docks at the phosphorylated tyrosine

FIGURE 3-32 Signal transduction pathways emanating from the TCR. T cell antigen binding activates
the src-family kinase Lck, which phosphorylates the
kinase ZAP-70. ZAP-70 in turn phosphorylates the adapter
molecules LAT, SLP76, and GADS which form a scaffold
enabling the phosphorylation and activation of PLC1
and PKC with the consequent effects on transcription
factor activation described in the text. The GEF proteins
Vav and SOS are also activated on binding to LAT, leading
to activation of the Ras/MAP kinase transcription factor
pathway and the Rac/Rho/cdc42 pathway, leading to
changes in cell shape and motility. PI3 kinase, translocated to the cytoplasmic side of CD28, forms PIP3, inducing localization of the enzymes PDK1 and Akt to the
membrane. This leads to further NF-B activation and
increased cell survival as described.
residues of the CD3 chains. ZAP-70 is activated by Lckmediated phosphorylation and goes on to phosphorylate
many adapter molecules including SLP-76 and LAT, as well
as enzymes important in T-cell activation, such as PLC1.

T Cells Use Downstream Signaling Strategies
Similar to Those of B Cells
Just as in B cells, signals initiating at the antigen receptor of
T cells with tyrosine phosphorylation events are then fanned
out to intracellular enzymes and transcription factors using
a network of adapter molecules and enzymes.
In T cells, one of the earliest adapter molecules to be incorporated into the signaling complex is LAT (Linker protein of
Activated T cells), a transmembrane protein associated with
lipid rafts in the plasma membrane. Following TCR ligation,
LAT is phosphorylated on multiple residues by ZAP-70, and
these phosphorylated residues now provide docking sites for
several important enzymes bearing SH2 domains, including
PLC1 (see Figure 3-32). Phosphorylated LAT also binds to

Receptors and Signaling: B and T-Cell Receptors
the adapter protein GADS, which is constitutively associated
with the adapter SLP-76. This combination of adapter proteins
is critical to T-cell receptor signaling, providing the structural
framework for most downstream signaling events.
Many of those downstream events will now be familiar.
PLC1, localized to the plasma membrane by binding to LAT,
is further activated by tyrosine phosphorylation, mediated by
the kinase Itk (which belongs to a family of kinases referred to
as Tec kinases). As described earlier, PLC1 breaks down PIP2,
releasing IP3, which induces the release of calcium and the
activation of NFAT via calcineurin activation. The DAG created by PIP2 hydrolysis binds, in T cells, to a specialized form
of PKC called PKC (theta). As described above, this part of
the signaling cascade similarly culminates in the degradation
of the inhibitors of NF-B and the translocation of the active
transcription factor into the nucleus (see Figure 3-17).
Phosphorylated LAT also associates with the SH2 domain
of Grb2, the now-familiar adapter molecule that brings in
components of the Ras pathway to the signaling complex.
Recall that Grb2 binds constitutively to SOS, the GEF that

|

facilitates activation of the Ras pathway. In T cells, the Ras
pathway is important both to the activation of the transcription
factor AP-1, which functions to signal cytokine secretion, and
to the passage of the signals that reorganize the actin cytoskeleton for directed cytokine release.
Thus, as for B cells, TCR-antigen binding leads to a multitude of consequences including transcription factor upregulation, reorganization of the cytoskeleton, and cytokine secretion.
Again, as for B cells, T-cell signaling also affects the expression
of adhesion molecules such as integrins on the cell surface, and
chemokines, which has subsequent effects on cell localization.
Clearly the description of adaptive immune signaling
offered in this chapter represents just the tip of the iceberg,
and these signaling cascades contain more components and
outcomes that can be alluded to in this brief outline. However, just as the adapter proteins provide a scaffold for the
immune system to organize its signaling proteins, so we
hope that this chapter has provided a similar scaffold for the
organization of the reader’s thoughts regarding these fascinating and complex processes.

Antigens bind to receptors via noncovalent bonding interactions.
The interactions between antigens and receptors of the
immune system are enhanced by simultaneous interactions
between lymphocyte-expressed co-receptors and molecules on antigen-presenting cells or on complex antigens.
Most receptor-antigen interactions are multivalent, and
this multivalency significantly increases the avidity of the
receptor-antigen binding interaction.
Binding of antigen to receptor induces a signaling cascade
in the receptor-bearing cell, which leads to alterations in
the motility, adhesive properties, and transcriptional program of the activated cell.
Antigen signaling is initiated in both T and B cells by
antigen-mediated receptor clustering. The clustered receptors are located in specialized regions of the membranes
called lipid rafts.
The CD3 and Ig/Ig proteins, which are T- and B-cell
receptor-associated signal transduction elements, are
phosphorylated on Immunoreceptor Tyrosine Activation
Motifs (ITAMs), and these serve as docking points for
adapter molecules.
Downstream signaling enzymes and GEFs dock onto the
adapter molecules and make contact with their substrates.
These enzymes include phospholipase C, which breaks
down PIP2 into DAG and IP3. IP3 interaction with ERlocated receptors leads to release of intracellular calcium
and activation of calcium-regulated proteins such as calcineurin phosphatase. Calcineurin dephosphorylates the
transcription factor NFAT, allowing it access to the

nucleus. DAG binds and activates protein kinase C, leading eventually to NF-B activation. Docking of the adapter
molecule Grb2 onto adapter proteins facilitates its binding
to the GEF protein SOS and activation of the MAP kinase
pathway, resulting in activation of the transcription factor
AP-1.
■

The antigen receptor on B cells is a membrane-bound
form of the four-chain immunoglobulin molecule that the
B cell secretes upon stimulation. An immunoglobulin
molecule is commonly known as an antibody. Antibodies
have two heavy and two light chains.

■

The antibodies secreted by B cells upon stimulation are
classified according to the amino acid sequence of the
heavy chain, and antibodies of different classes perform
different functions during an immune response.

■

Antigen signaling in B cells proceeds according to signaling strategies shared among many cell types.

■

The antigen receptor on T cells is not an immunoglobulin
molecule, although its protein domains are classified as
belonging to the immunoglobulin superfamily of proteins.

■

■

■

Most T cells bear receptors made up of an  heterodimer
that recognizes a complex antigen, made up of a short
peptide inserted into a groove on the surface of a protein
encoded by the major histocompatibility complex (MHC)
of genes.
Some T cells bear receptors made up of 	 receptor chains
that recognize a different array of antigens.
Antigen signaling in T cells shares many characteristic
strategies with B cell signaling.

Q U E S T I O N S

1. The NFAT family is a ubiquitous family of transcription

factors.
a. Under resting conditions, where is NFAT localized in a

cell?
b. Under activated conditions, where is NFAT localized in

a cell?
c. How is it released from its resting condition and per-

mitted to relocalize?
d. Immunosuppressant drugs such as cyclosporin act via

inhibition of the calcineurin phosphatase. If NFAT is ubiquitous, how do you think these drugs might act with so few
side effects on other signaling processes within the body?
2. In the early days of experiments designed to detect the

T-cell receptor, several different research groups found that
antibodies directed against immunoglobulin proteins
appeared to bind to the T-cell receptor. Given what you
know about the structure of immunoglobulins and the
T-cell receptor, why is this not completely surprising?
3. True or false? Explain your answers.

Interactions between receptors and ligands at the cell surface:
a. are mediated by covalent interactions.
b. can result in the creation of new covalent interactions

within the cell.
4. Describe how the following experimental manipulations

were used to determine antibody structure.
a. Reduction and alkylation of the antibody molecule
b. Enzymatic digestion of the antibody molecule
c. Antibody detection of immunoglobulin fragments
5. What is an ITAM, and what proteins modify the ITAMs in

Ig and Ig?

8. You and another student are studying a cytokine receptor

on a B cell that has a Kd of 106 M. You know that the cytokine receptor sites on the cell surface must be at least 50%
occupied for the B cell to receive a cytokine signal from a
helper T cell. Your lab partner measures the cytokine concentration in the blood of the experimental animal and
detects a concentration of 107 M. She tells you that the
effect you have been measuring could not possibly result
from the cytokine you’re studying. You disagree. Why?

9. Activation of Src-family kinases is the first step in several

different types of signaling pathways. It therefore makes
biological sense that the activity of this family of tyrosine
kinases is regulated extremely tightly. Describe how phosphorylation of Src-family kinases can deliver both activating and inhibitory signals to Src kinases.
10. You have generated a T-cell clone in which the Src-family

tyrosine kinase Lck is inactive. You stimulate that clone
with its cognate antigenic peptide, presented on the appropriate MHC platform and test for interleukin 2 secretion,
as a measure of T cell activation. Do you expect to see IL-2
secretion or not? Explain.
11. Name one protein shown to be defective in many cases of

X-linked agammaglobulinemia, and describe how a reduction in the activity of this protein could lead to immunodeficiency.
12. The B- and T-cell receptor proteins have remarkably short

intracytoplasmic regions of just a few amino acids. How can
you reconcile this structural feature with the need to signal
the presence of bound antigen to the interior of the cell?
13. Describe one way in which the structure of antibodies is

superbly adapted to their function.

6. Define an adapter protein. Describe how an interaction

between proteins bearing SH2 and phosphorylated tyrosine (pY) groups helps to transduce a signal from the T-cell
receptor to the ZAP-70 protein kinase.

clone that appears to be constitutively (always) activated,
although at a low level, even in the absence of antigenic
stimulation, and he has asked you to figure out why. Your
benchmate suggests you start by checking out the sequence
of its lck gene, or the status of the Csk activity in the cell. You
agree that those are good ideas. What is your reasoning?

7. IgM has ten antigen-binding sites per molecule, whereas

IgG only has two. Would you expect IgM to be able to bind
five times as many antigenic sites on a multivalent antigen
as IgG? Why/why not?

he hundreds of millions of cells that comprise
the vertebrate immune system are distributed
throughout the body of the host (see Chapter 2).
Some cells circulate through the blood and
lymph systems, whereas others are sessile (remain in
place) in the primary and secondary lymphoid tissues,
the skin, and the mucosa of the respiratory, alimentary,
and genito-urinary tracts. The key to success for such a
widely dispersed organ system is the ability of its various
components to communicate quickly and efficiently with
one another, so that the right cells can home to the
appropriate locations and take the necessary measures to
destroy invading pathogens.
Molecules that communicate among cells of the
immune system are referred to as cytokines. In general,
cytokines are soluble molecules, although some also exist
in membrane-bound forms. The interaction of a cytokine
with its receptor on a target cell can cause changes in the
expression of adhesion molecules and chemokine
receptors on the target membrane, thus allowing it to
move from one location to another. Cytokines can also
signal an immune cell to increase or decrease the activity
of particular enzymes or to change its transcriptional
program, thereby altering and enhancing its effector
functions. Finally, they can instruct a cell when to survive
and when to die.
In an early attempt to classify cytokines,
immunologists began numbering them in the order of
their discovery, and naming them interleukins. This
name reflects the fact that interleukins communicate
between (Latin, inter) white blood cells (leukocytes).
Examples include interleukin 1 (IL-1), secreted by
macrophages, and interleukin 2 (IL-2), secreted by
activated T cells. However, many cytokines that were
named prior to this attempt at rationalizing nomenclature
have resisted reclassification, and so students will come
across cytokines such as Tumor Necrosis Factor or
Interferons, that are also “interleukins” in all but name.
Although the term cytokine refers to all molecules that
communicate among immune cells, the name chemokine
is used specifically to describe that subpopulation of

cytokines that share the specific purpose of mobilizing
immune cells from one organ, or indeed, from one part of
an organ, to another. Chemokines belong to the class of
molecules called chemoattractants, molecules that attract
cells by influencing the assembly, disassembly, and
contractility of cytoskeleton proteins and the expression
of cell-surface adhesion molecules. Chemokines attract
cells with the appropriate chemokine receptors to regions
where the chemokine concentration is highest. For
example, chemokines are important in attracting cells of

Introduction

the innate immune system to the site of infection and
inducing T cells to move toward antigen-presenting cells
in the secondary lymphoid tissues. Leukocytes change
their pattern of expression of chemokine receptors over
the course of an immune response, first migrating to the
secondary immune organs, in which they undergo
differentiation to mature effector cells, and then moving
out into the affected tissues to fight the infection,
responding to different chemokine gradients with each
movement. As we will learn in a later section, chemokines
are also capable of instructing cells to alter their
transcriptional programs.
The classification and nomenclature of chemokines is
more logical than that of interleukins, and is based on
their biochemical structures. Although chemokines
technically fall under the umbrella classification of
“cytokines,” normal usage is evolving such that the term
chemokine is used when referring to molecules that move
immune cells from place to place, and the term cytokine is
employed when referring to any other messenger
molecule of the immune system.
Like all signaling molecules, cytokines can be further
classified on the basis of the distance between the cell
secreting the signaling ligand and the cell receiving that
chemical signal. Cytokines that act on cells some distance
away from the secreting cell, such that they must pass
through the bloodstream before reaching their target, are
referred to as endocrine (Figure 4-1). Those that act on
cells near the secreting cell, such that the cytokine merely
has to diffuse a few Ångstroms through tissue fluids or

across an immunological synapse, are referred to as
paracrine. Sometimes, a cell needs to receive a signal
through its own membrane receptors from a cytokine that
it, itself, has secreted. This type of signaling is referred to as
autocrine. Of note, the T-cell interleukin IL-2 acts
effectively in all three modes. Unlike the classical
hormones, such as insulin and glucagon, that generally act
at long range in an endocrine fashion, many cytokines act
over a short distance in an autocrine or paracrine fashion.
We begin this chapter with an introduction to the
general properties of cytokines and chemokines followed
by a discussion of the specific receptors and signaling
pathways used by the six families of immune system
cytokines and chemokines. Next, we describe the ways in
which cytokine signaling can be regulated by antagonists.
Finally, we turn to the role of cytokines and chemokines
in disease and medicine.

General Properties of Cytokines
and Chemokines
The activity of cytokines was first recognized in the mid1960s, when supernatants derived from in vitro cultures of
lymphocytes were found to contain soluble factors, usually
proteins or glycoproteins, that could regulate proliferation,
differentiation, and maturation of immune system cells. Production of these factors by cultured lymphocytes was
induced by activation with antigens or with nonspecific
mitogens (molecules inducing cell division, or mitosis).
However, biochemical isolation and purification of cytokines was initially hampered because of their low concentrations in the culture supernatants and the absence of
well-defined assay systems for individual cytokines.
The advent of hybridoma technology (see Chapter 20)
allowed the production of artificially generated T-cell tumors
that constitutively produced IL-2, allowing for its purification and characterization. Gene cloning techniques developed during the 1970s and 1980s then made it possible to
generate pure cytokines by expressing the proteins from
cloned genes derived from hybridomas or from normal leukocytes, after transfection into bacterial or yeast cells. Using
these pure cytokine preparations, researchers were able to
identify cell lines whose growth depended on the presence of
a particular cytokine, thus providing them with biological
cytokine assay systems. Since then, monoclonal antibodies
specific for many cytokines have made it possible to develop
rapid, quantitative, cytokine-specific immunoassays. ELISA
assays measure the concentrations of cytokines in solution,
Elispot assays quantitate the cytokines secreted by individual
cells, and cytokine-specific antibodies can be used to identify cytokine-secreting cells using intracellular cytokine
staining followed by flow cytometry or immuno-fluorescence
microscopy (see Chapter 20).

Receptors and Signaling: Cytokines and Chemokines

Cytokines Mediate the Activation, Proliferation,
and Differentiation of Target Cells
Cytokines bind to specific receptors on the membranes of
target cells, triggering signal transduction pathways that
ultimately alter enzyme activity and gene expression (Figure  4-2). The susceptibility of a target cell to a particular
cytokine is determined by the presence of specific membrane receptors. In general, cytokines and their fully assembled receptors exhibit very high affinity for one another, with
dissociation constants for cytokines and their receptors
ranging from 10⫺8 to 10⫺12 M⫺1. Because their receptor
affinities are so high and because cytokines are often secreted
in close proximity to their receptors, such that the cytokine
concentration is not diluted by diffusion (as mentioned in
Chapter 3), the secretion of very few cytokine molecules can
mediate powerful biological effects.
Cytokines regulate the intensity and duration of the
immune response by stimulating or inhibiting the activation, proliferation, and/or differentiation of various cells, by
regulating the secretion of other cytokines or of antibodies,
or in some cases by actually inducing programmed cell death
in the target cell. In addition, cytokines can modulate the

FIGURE 4-2 Overview of the induction and function of
cytokines. An inducing stimulus, which may be an antigen or
another cytokine, interacts with a receptor on one cell, inducing it to
secrete cytokines that in turn act on receptors of a second cell, bringing about a biological consequence. In the case of IL-2, both cells
may be antigen-activated T cells that secrete IL-2, which acts both on
the secreting cell and on neighboring, activated T cells.

expression of various cell-surface receptors for chemokines,
other cytokines, or even for themselves. Thus, the cytokines
secreted by even a small number of antigen-activated lymphocytes can influence the activity of many different types of
cells involved in the immune response.
Cytokines exhibit the attributes of pleiotropy, redundancy, synergism, antagonism, and cascade induction (Figure 4-3), which permit them to regulate cellular activity in a
coordinated, interactive way. A cytokine that induces different biological effects depending on the nature of the target
cells is said to have a pleiotropic action, whereas two or
more cytokines that mediate similar functions are said to be
redundant. Cytokine synergy occurs when the combined
effect of two cytokines on cellular activity is greater than the
additive effects of the individual cytokines. In some cases,
the effects of one cytokine inhibit or antagonize the effects
of another. Cascade induction occurs when the action of
one cytokine on a target cell induces that cell to produce one
or more additional cytokines.

Cytokines Have Numerous Biological Functions
Although a variety of cells can secrete cytokines that instruct
the immune system, the principal producers are TH cells,
dendritic cells, and macrophages. Cytokines released from
these cell types are capable of activating entire networks of
interacting cells (Figure 4-4). Among the numerous physiological responses that require cytokine involvement are the
generation of cellular and humoral immune responses, the
induction of the inflammatory response, the regulation of
hematopoiesis, and wound healing.
The total number of proteins with cytokine activity grows
daily as research continues to uncover new ones. Table 4-1
summarizes the activities of some commonly encountered
cytokines. An expanded list of cytokines can be found in
Appendix II. Note, however, that many of the listed functions have been identified from analyses of the effects of
recombinant cytokines, sometimes added alone to in vitro
systems at nonphysiologic concentrations. In vivo, cytokines
rarely, if ever, act alone. Instead, a target cell is exposed to a
milieu containing a mixture of cytokines whose combined
synergistic or antagonistic effects can have a wide variety of
consequences. In addition, as we have learned, cytokines
often induce the synthesis of other cytokines, resulting in
cascades of activity.

Cytokines Can Elicit and Support the
Activation of Specific T-Cell Subpopulations
As described in Chapters 2 and 11, helper T cells can be
classified into subpopulations, each of which is responsible
for the support of a different set of immune functions. For
example, TH1 cells secrete cytokines that promote the differentiation and activity of macrophages and cytotoxic T cells,
thus leading to a primarily cytotoxic immune response, in
which cells that have been infected with viruses and

intracellular bacteria are recognized and destroyed. The
cytokines IL-12 and interferon (IFN) ␥ induce TH1 differentiation. In contrast, TH2 cells activate B cells to make
antibodies, which neutralize and bind extracellular pathogens, rendering them susceptible to phagocytosis and
complement-mediated lysis. IL-4 and IL-5 support the generation of TH2 cells. TH17 cells promote the differentiation
of activated macrophages and neutrophils, and support the

inflammatory state; their generation is induced by IL-17
and IL-23. The differentiation and activity of each distinctive T-cell subpopulation is therefore supported by the
binding of different combinations of cytokines to T-cell
surface receptors, with each cytokine combination inducing its own characteristic array of intracellular signals, and
sending the helper T cell down a particular differentiation
pathway.

Cell Activation May Alter the Expression
of Receptors and Adhesion Molecules
The ability of cytokines to activate most, if not all, members
of particular immune cell subpopulations appears to conflict
with the established specificity of the immune system. What
keeps cytokines from activating all T cells, for example, in a
nonspecific fashion during the immune response?
In order for a cell to respond to a signaling molecule, it
must express receptors for that molecule, and responsiveness to a molecular signal can thus be controlled by signal
receptor expression. For example, antigen stimulation of a
T cell induces alterations in the T-cell surface expression of
chemokine receptors. Reception of chemokine signals

through these receptors therefore instructs only those cells
that have previously been activated by antigen to migrate to
nearby lymph nodes or to the spleen. Furthermore, activationinduced changes in the adhesion molecules that are
expressed on the cell membrane ensures that stimulated
cells migrate to, and then remain in, the location best suited
to their function. T-cell activation by antigen also up-regulates
the expression of the receptors for cytokines that provide
proliferative signals, such as IL-2 (as described in Chapter 3),
and also for differentiative cytokines such as IL-4. In this
way, following antigen encounter, only those T cells that
have been activated by antigen are primed to relocate and
to receive the proliferative and differentiative signals they
need to function as a mature immune effector cell. This

pattern of activation-induced alteration in the cell surface
expression of adhesion molecules, chemokine receptors,
and cytokine receptors is a common strategy employed by
the immune system.

Cytokines Are Concentrated Between
Secreting and Target Cells
During the process of T-cell activation by an antigen-presenting dendritic cell, or of B-cell activation by a cognate T cell,
the respective pairs of cells are held in close juxtaposition for
many hours (see Chapter 14). Over that time period, the cells
release cytokines that bind to relevant receptors on the partner cell surface, without ever entering the general circulation.
Furthermore, during this period of close cell-cell contact, the
secretory apparatus of the stimulating cell is oriented so that
the cytokines are released right at the region of the cell membrane that is in closest contact with the recipient cell (see
Figure 3-4). The close nature of the cell-cell interaction and

the directional release of cytokines by the secretory apparatus
means that the effective concentration of cytokines in the
region of the membrane receptors may be orders of magnitude higher than that experienced outside the contact region
of the two cells. Thus, discussions of membrane receptor
affinity and cytokine concentrations within tissue fluids must
always take into account the biology of the responding system and the geography of the cell interactions involved. In
addition, the half-life of cytokines in the bloodstream or
other extracellular fluids into which they are secreted is usually very short, ensuring that cytokines usually act for only a
limited time and over a short distance.

Signaling Through Multiple Receptors
Can Fine Tune a Cellular Response
Cytokine and chemokine signaling in the immune response
can be a strikingly complex and occasionally redundant
affair. Effector molecules such as cytokines can bind to more

c04ReceptorsandSignalingCytokinesandChemokines.indd Page 111 12/19/12 11:47 PM user-t044

Receptors and Signaling: Cytokines and Chemokines
than one receptor, and receptors can bind to more than one
signaling molecule. Nowhere is the latter concept more
clearly illustrated than in the chemokine system, in which
approximately 20 receptors bind to close to 50 distinct chemokines (see Appendix III). Effector molecule signaling can
also cooperate with signaling through antigen-specific
receptors. Signals received through more than one receptor
must then be integrated at the level of the biological
response, with multiple pathways acting to tune up or tune
down the expression of particular transcription factors or
the activity of particular enzymes. Thus, the actual biological
response mounted by a cell to a particular chemical signal
depends not only on the nature of the individual receptor for
that signal, but also on all of the downstream adapters and
enzymes present in the recipient cell.

CHAPTER 4

Six Families of Cytokines and
Associated Receptor Molecules
In recent years, immunologists have enjoyed an explosion of
information about new cytokines and cytokine receptors as a
result of advances in genomic and proteomic analysis.
Advances Box 4-1 describes a recently developed proteomic
approach to the search for new, secreted cytokines and illustrates the manner in which a sophisticated appreciation of the
molecular and cell biology of secretory pathways aids in the
identification of new cytokines. The purpose of this chapter is
not to provide an exhaustive list of cytokines and their receptors (see Appendices II and III for a comprehensive and current list of cytokines and chemokines), but rather to outline

Methods Used to Map the Secretome
The related approaches of genomics
and proteomics provide scientists with
tools they can use to assess the complex
changes that occur in gene and protein
expression induced by stimuli, such as
antigen or cytokine stimulation. Vast
arrays of information regarding the derivation and readout of genes in different
cells and organisms, and the expression of
particular proteins, can be analyzed and
presented in ways not available to scientists just a few years ago.
Recently, the science of proteomics has
been extended to address the mapping of
proteins that are secreted by various cell
types. The array of proteins secreted by a
cell is referred to as its secretome, and the
secretome can be more formally defined
as the “proteins released by a cell, tissue, or
organisms through classical and nonclassical secretion mechanisms.”
Scientists first became interested in the
concept of the secretome as a way to diagnose and identify various types of cancer.
They reasoned that they could use the set
of proteins secreted into the serum or other
tissue fluids as a biological marker for spe-

cific tumor types. If particular proteins can
be shown to be secreted at high concentration only under conditions of malignancy,
then rapid and inexpensive tests can be
developed that have the potential to screen
for tumors at an early stage, when they are
still amenable to treatment. Although such
tumor-specific profiles of secreted proteins
are surprisingly difficult to develop, given
the range of mutations associated with the
generation of a cancer, the ability to diagnose a tumor at an early stage using only a
serum sample provides intense motivation,
and many such attempts are ongoing.
The approaches used to define a set of
cancer secretomes have since been
applied to studies of many other, nonmalignant cell populations for which the
description of a secretome would be a
useful analytical tool. These populations
include stem cells, cells of the immune
system, and adipose cells. Given the diversity of cytokines that can be secreted by a
single cell, and the manner in which the
activities of cytokines can interact at the
level of the target cell, cytokine biology is
a superb target for such a global approach.

A recent secretome analysis (Botto
et al., 2011) addressed the question of how
the human cytomegalovirus induces the
formation of new blood vessels (angiogenesis). Virus-free supernatant from
virus-infected endothelial cells was found
to induce angiogenesis. Secretome analysis of the infected endothelial cell supernatant revealed the presence of multiple
cytokines, including IL-8, GM-CSF, and IL-6.
The addition of a blocking anti-IL-6 antibody at the same time as the virus-free
supernatant was then shown to inhibit its
angiogenic activity, thus demonstrating
that it was the IL-6 activity in the supernatant that was primarily responsible for
inducing the new blood vessel growth.
One difficulty that is frequently
encountered in trying to analyze the secretome of a particular type of cell is the
need of many cells to grow in a tissue
culture fluid supplemented with serum,
which is itself a complex mixture of proteins. In this case it is important to distinguish between proteins released by the
cells under study and those which were
originally present in the serum. Several

techniques are available to discriminate
between secreted proteins and those
from the tissue culture media, including
adding inhibitors of secretion to some
cultures and then comparing those proteins present in the culture supernatant in
the presence and absence of inhibitors.
Alternatively, culturing the cells in the
presence of radioisotopes that only label
newly synthesized proteins, such as 35S
methionine, can be used to distinguish
these proteins from preexisting proteins
in the culture medium.
In the case, such as that described
above, that a cell line is being tested to
determine whether it secretes a set of
cytokines for which antibody assays
already exist, two different types of multiplex measurements may be used (see Figure 1). Both of these approaches utilize
antibodies to the array of cytokines to be
analyzed, attached to some sort of solid
phase support. This support may be glass,
a membrane, or a set of beads, with each
antibody attached to a bead of a different
color. The sample of tissue culture fluid is
added to the solid phase antibody, excess
fluid is washed away, and then biotinylated antibodies are added. (Biotin, a small
molecule, is used because it has an
extremely high affinity for a protein, streptavidin, and is therefore used to couple
two molecules together in assays such as
these. For more details, see Chapter 20.)
After antibody binding, the excess biotinylated antibodies are removed by washing and the cytokine concentrations are
assessed by the addition of fluorescent
streptavidin, which will bind to the biotin.
A fluorescent signal indicates the presence
of the cytokine in the sample, and the level
of the signal reveals its concentration
Since each bead fluoresces at a different
wavelength, the fluorescence associated
with each cytokine can be distinguished.
Various bioinformatics tools have been
developed that have particular application to secretome analysis. These include
SignalP, which identifies the presence of
signal peptides and also shows the location of signal peptide cleavage sites in
bacterial and eukaryotic proteins. In addition, SecretomeP can be used for the pre-

some general principles of cytokine and receptor architecture
and function that should then enable the reader to place any
cytokine into its unique biological context.
Detailed studies of cytokine structure and function have
revealed common features among families of cytokines.
Cytokines are relatively small proteins and generally have a
molecular mass of less than 30 kDa. Many are glycosylated,
and glycosylation appears to contribute to cytokine stability,
although not necessarily to cytokine activity. Cytokines
characterized so far belong to one of six groups: the Interleukin 1 (IL-1) family, the Hematopoietin (Class I cytokine)
family, the Interferon (Class II cytokine) family, the Tumor
Necrosis Factor (TNF) family, the Interleukin 17 (IL-17)
family, and the Chemokine family (Table 4-2). Each of these
six families of cytokines, the receptors that engage them, and
the signaling pathways that transduce the message received
upon cytokine binding into the appropriate biological outcome are described in the following pages.

Cytokines of the IL-1 Family Promote
Proinflammatory Signals
Cytokines of the interleukin 1 (IL-1) family are typically
secreted very early in the immune response by dendritic cells
and monocytes or macrophages. IL-1 secretion is stimulated
by recognition of viral, parasitic, or bacterial antigens by
innate immune receptors. IL-1 family members are generally
proinflammatory, meaning that they induce an increase in
the capillary permeability at the site of cytokine secretion,
along with an amplification of the level of leukocyte migration into the infected tissues. In addition, IL-1 has systemic
(whole body) effects and signals the liver to produce acute

phase proteins such as the Type I interferons (IFNs ␣ and ␤),
IL-6, and the chemokine CXCL8. These proteins further
induce multiple protective effects, including the destruction
of viral RNA and the generation of a systemic fever response
(which helps to eliminate many temperature-sensitive bacterial strains). IL-1 also activates both T and B cells at the
induction of the adaptive immune response.
Cytokines of the IL-1 Family
Members of the IL-1 cytokine and receptor family are
shown in Figure 4-5. The canonical (most representative)
members of the IL-1 family, IL-1␣ and IL-1␤, are both synthesized as 31 kDa precursors, pro-IL-1␣ and pro-IL-1␤. Pro
IL-1␣ is biologically active, and often occurs in a membranebound form, whereas pro-IL-1␤ requires processing to the
fully mature soluble molecule before it can function. Pro-IL-1␣
and ␤ are both trimmed to their 17 kDa active forms by the
proteolytic enzyme caspase-1 inside the secreting cell. Active
caspase-1 is located in a complex set of proteins referred to
as the inflammasome (see Chapter 5).
Other IL-1 family members, IL-18 and IL-33, have also
been shown to be processed by caspase-1 in vitro (although
there is ambiguity as to whether IL-33 requires this processing for full activity in vivo). IL-18 is related to IL-1, uses the
same receptor family, and has a similar function; like IL-1,
IL-18 is expressed by monocytes, macrophages, and dendritic
cells and is secreted early in the immune response. In contrast, IL-33 is constitutively expressed in smooth muscle and
in bronchial epithelia, and its expression can be induced by
IL-1␤ and TNF-␣ in lung and skin fibroblasts. IL-33 has been
shown to induce TH2 cytokines that promote T-lymphocyte
interactions with B cells, mast cells, and eosinophils. IL-33

Introduction

has also been implicated in the pathology of diseases such as
asthma and inflammatory airway and bowel diseases.
Two additional members of this cytokine family act as
natural inhibitors of IL-1 family function. The soluble protein
IL-1Ra (IL-1 Receptor antagonist) binds to the IL-1RI receptor, but prevents its interaction with its partner receptor
chain, IL-1RAcP, thus rendering it incapable of transducing
a signal to the interior of the cell. IL-1Ra therefore functions
as an antagonist ligand of IL-1. IL-18BP adopts a different
strategy of inhibition, binding to IL-18 in solution and preventing IL-18 from interacting productively with its receptor. The inhibitory effect of IL-18BP is enhanced by the
further binding of IL-1F7 (see Figure 4-5b).

The IL-1 Family of Cytokine Receptors

(a)

(b)

The Interleukin 1 family of receptors includes the receptors
for IL-1, IL-18, and IL-33. Both forms of IL-1—IL-1␣ and
IL-1␤—bind to the same receptors and mediate the same
responses. Two different receptors for IL-1 are known, and
both are members of the immunoglobulin superfamily of
proteins (see Chapter 3). Only the type I IL-1R (IL-1RI),
which is expressed on many cell types, is able to transduce a
cellular signal; the type II IL-1R (IL-1RII) is limited to B cells
and is inactive. For full functioning, the Type 1 IL-1R also
requires the presence of an interacting accessory protein, IL1RAcP (IL-1 Receptor Accessory Protein (see Figure 4-5a).

FIGURE 4-5 Ligands and receptors of the IL-1 family. (a) The
two agonist ligands, IL-1␣ and IL-1␤, are represented by IL-1 and the
antagonist ligand by IL-1Ra. The IL-1 receptor, IL-1RI, has a long cytoplasmic domain and, along with IL-1RAcP, activates signal transduction pathways. IL-1Ra functions as an IL-1 inhibitor by binding to
IL-1RI while not allowing interaction with IL-1RAcP. IL-1RII does not
activate cells but functions as an IL-1 inhibitor both on the plasma
membrane and in the cell microenvironment as a soluble receptor
(sIL-1RII). IL-1RAcP can also inhibit IL-1 signals by cooperating with
IL-1RII in binding IL-1 either on the plasma membrane or as a soluble
molecule (sIL-1RAcP). (b) IL-18 binds to the IL-18R␣ chain, and this
complex then engages the IL-18R␤ chain to initiate intracellular signals. The soluble protein IL-18BP functions as an inhibitor of IL-18 by
binding this ligand in the fluid phase, preventing interaction with the
IL-18R␣ chain. IL-1F7 appears to enhance the inhibitory effect of
IL-18BP. (c) IL-33 binds to the T1/ST2 receptor, and this complex
engages the IL-1RAcP as a co-receptor. A soluble form of ST2 (sST2)
may function as an inhibitor of IL-33 by binding IL-33 in the cell microenvironment and sIL-1RAcP may enhance the inhibitory effects of sST2.

Receptors and Signaling: Cytokines and Chemokines
Note that both the IL-1RI and the IL-1RII receptor chains
as well as the receptor accessory protein exist in both soluble
and membrane-bound forms. However, a full signal is transmitted only from the dimer of the membrane-bound forms of
IL-1RI and IL-1RAcP. The alternative, membrane-bound
and soluble forms of IL-1 binding proteins, can “soak up”
excess cytokine, but they are unable to transduce the interleukin signal. Thus, by secreting more or fewer of these inactive receptors, at different times during an immune response,
the organism has the opportunity to fine-tune the cytokine
signal by allowing the inactive and soluble receptors to compete with the signal-transducing receptor for available cytokine. This theme finds echoes in other immune system
receptor families, and appears to be a frequently evolved
strategy for controlling the strength of signals that give rise
to important outcomes. In the case of IL-1, the ultimate
result of successful IL-1 signaling is a global, proinflammatory state, and so the penalty paid by the host for an inappropriately strong IL-1 response would be physiologically
significant and even potentially fatal.
The receptor for IL-18 is also a heterodimer, made up of
IL-18R␣ and IL-18R␤. IL-33 is recognized by the IL-1RAcP
in combination with a novel receptor protein, variously
termed T1/ST-2 or IL-1RL1. As for IL-1, inhibitory receptors
exist for IL-33 (see Figure 4-5c).
Signaling from IL-1 Receptors
Productive ligand binding to the extracellular portion of the
IL-1 receptor leads to a conformational alteration in its cytoplasmic domain. This structural alteration in the receptor
leads to a series of downstream signaling events (Figure 4-6).
Most of the themes of these events will be familiar to the
reader from Chapter 3, and we will encounter them again in
the discussion of innate immune receptors in Chapter 5.
First, binding of the adapter protein MyD88 to the occupied receptor allows recruitment to the receptor complex of
one or more members of the IL-1 Receptor Activated
Kinase (IRAK) protein family. One of these, IRAK-4, is
activated by autophosphorylation and phosphorylates its fellow IRAKs, resulting in the generation of binding sites for
TNF Receptor Associated Factor 6 (TRAF6), which is associated with a ubiquitin-ligase complex capable of generating
polyubiquitin chains. The IRAK-TRAF6 complex now dissociates from the receptor and interacts with a preformed
cytosolic complex made up of the kinase TGF␤⫺Associated
Kinase 1 (TAK1) and two TAK1-Binding proteins, TAB1
and TAB2. Binding of polyubiquitin chains to the TAB proteins in the TAK1 complex activates it.
The TAK1 complex now performs two functions with
which the reader should be familiar. It phosphorylates and
activates the IKK complex, leading to the destruction of I␬B
and the resultant activation of the transcription factor NF-␬B
(see Figure 3-17). In addition, TRAF6 also plays a role in
IKK activation by providing ubiquitination sites to which
the NEMO component of IKK can bind, resulting in its further activation. TAK1 also activates downstream members

adapter protein MyD88 via its TIR domain. MyD88 recruits one or
more IL-1 receptor activated kinases (IRAKs) to the receptor complex,
which phosphorylate one another providing binding sites for TRAF6.
The IRAK-TRAF6 complex dissociates from the receptor complex and
interacts with the cytoplasmic protein TAK1 and its two binding proteins, TABs 1 and 2. TRAF6, together with a ubiquitin-ligase complex,
catalyzes the generation of polyubiquitin chains that activate the

TAK1 also activates downstream members of the MAP kinase cascade, leading to activation of the AP-1 transcription factor.

of the MAP kinase cascade, which in turn activate the AP-1
transcription factor (see Figure 3-16). Binding of IL-1 family
cytokines to their receptors thereby leads to a global alteration in the transcription patterns of the affected cells, which
in turn results in the up-regulation of proinflammatory cytokines and adhesion molecules.

Introduction

Hematopoietin (Class I) Family Cytokines Share
Three-Dimensional Structural Motifs, but
Induce a Diversity of Functions in Target Cells
Members of the hematopoietin (Class I) cytokine family
are small, soluble cytokines that communicate between and
among cells of the immune system. Their name is somewhat
misleading in that not all members of this family are implicated in hematopoietic (blood-cell forming) functions per
se. However, some of the earliest members of this family to
be characterized indeed have hematopoietic functions, and
the cytokine family was then defined on the basis of structural similarities among all the participants. Because the
hematopoietin family contains some of the earliest cytokines
to be structurally characterized, it is sometimes also referred
to as the Class I cytokine family.
Cytokines of the Hematopoietin (Class I) Family
As more hematopoietin family members have been defined,
it has become clear that their cellular origins and target cells
are as diverse as their ultimate functions, which range from
signaling the onset of T- and B-cell proliferation (e.g., IL-2),
to signaling the onset of B-cell differentiation to plasma cells
and antibody secretion (e.g., IL-6), to signaling the differentiation of a T helper cell along one particular differentiation
pathway versus another (e.g., IL-4 vs. IL-12) and, finally, to
initiating the differentiation of particular leukocyte lineages
(e.g., GM-CSF, G-CSF). Appendix II lists the cytokines
described in this book, along with their cells of origin, their
target cells, and the functions they induce.
Significant homology in the three-dimensional structure
of hematopoietin family cytokines defines them as members
of a single protein family, despite a relatively high degree of
amino acid sequence diversity. The defining structural feature of this class of cytokines is a four-helix bundle motif,
organized into four anti-parallel helices (Figure 4-7). Members of this family can then be further subclassified on the
basis of helical length. Cytokines such as IL-2, IL-4, and IL-3
typically have short helices of 8 to 10 residues in length. In
contrast, the so-called long-chain cytokines, which include
IL-6 and IL-12, typically have helical lengths of 10 to 20
residues.
The Hematopoietin or Class I Receptor Family
Most hematopoietin cytokine receptors include two types of
protein domains: an immunoglobulin-like domain, made
up of ␤ sheets, as described in Chapter 3, and domains that
bear structural homology to the FNIII domain of the extracellular matrix protein fibronectin. Binding sites for most
cytokines are to be found in a structure made up of two,
tandem (side-by-side) FNIII domains referred to as
Cytokine-binding Homology Regions (CHRs). As we will
see, the CHR motif is common to cytokine receptors from
several families.
A feature common to most of the Hematopoietin and Interferon cytokine receptor families is the presence of multiple
subunits. Table 4-3 lists the three subfamilies of hematopoietin

that is shared among all members of that family.
The ␥-Chain Bearing, or IL-2 Receptor, Subfamily
Expression of a common ␥ chain defines the IL-2 receptor
subfamily, which includes receptors for IL-2, IL-4, IL-7, IL-9,
IL-15, and IL-21. The IL-2 and the IL-15 receptors are heterotrimers, consisting of a cytokine-specific ␣ chain and two
chains—␤ and ␥—responsible for both signal transduction
and cytokine recognition. The IL-2 receptor ␥ chain also
functions as the signal-transducing subunit for the other
receptors in this subfamily, which are all dimers. Congenital
X-linked severe combined immunodeficiency (XSCID)
results from a defect in the ␥-chain gene, which maps to the
X chromosome. The immunodeficiency observed in this

Introduction

(Figure 4-8b). Important additional contacts with the IL-2
ligand are contributed when the ␣ chain is present, accounting
for the higher affinity of binding by the trimer.
The expression of the three chains of the IL-2 receptor
varies among cell types and in different activation states. The
intermediate affinity (␤␥) IL-2 receptors are expressed on
resting T cells and on NK cells, whereas activated T and B
cells express both the low-affinity (␣) and the high-affinity
(␣␤␥) receptor forms (see Figure 4-8a). Since there are
approximately ten times as many low-affinity as high-affinity
receptors on activated T cells (50,000 vs. 5000), one must ask
what the function of the low-affinity receptor might be, and
two possible ideas have been advanced. It may serve to concentrate IL-2 onto the recipient cell surface for passage to the
high-affinity receptor. Conversely, it may reduce the local
concentration of available IL-2, ensuring that only cells bearing the high-affinity receptor are capable of being activated.
Whatever the answer to this question may be, the restriction
of the high-affinity IL-2 receptor expression to activated T
cells ensures that only antigen-activated CD4⫹ and CD8⫹ T
cells will proliferate in response to physiologic levels of IL-2.
The ␤⫺Chain Bearing, or GM-CSF, Receptor Subfamily
Members of the GM-CSF receptor subfamily, which includes
the receptors for IL-3, IL-5, and GM-CSF, share the ␤ signaling subunit. Each of these cytokines binds with relatively low
affinity to a unique, cytokine-specific receptor protein, the ␣
subunit of a dimeric receptor. All three low-affinity subunits
associate noncovalently with the common signal-transducing
␤ subunit. The resulting ␣␤ dimeric receptor has a higher
affinity for the cytokine than the specific ␣ chain alone, and
is also capable of transducing a signal across the membrane
upon cytokine binding (Figure 4-9a).
IL-3, IL-5, and GM-CSF exhibit redundant activities. IL-3
and GM-CSF both act on hematopoietic stem cells and progenitor cells, activate monocytes, and induce megakaryocyte
differentiation, and all three of these cytokines induce
eosinophil proliferation and basophil degranulation with
release of histamine.
Since the receptors for IL-3, IL-5, and GM-CSF share a common signal-transducing ␤ subunit, each of these cytokines
would be expected to transduce a similar activation signal,
accounting for the redundancy seen among their biological
effects, and indeed, all three cytokines induce the same patterns
of protein phosphorylation upon cell activation. However,
when introduced simultaneously to a cell culture, IL-3 and GMCSF appear to antagonize one another; the binding of IL-3 is
inhibited by GM-CSF, and binding of GM-CSF is inhibited by
IL-3. This antagonism is caused by competition for a limited
number of ␤ subunits available to associate with the cytokinespecific ␣ subunits of the dimeric receptors (Figure 4-9b).
The gp130 Receptor Subfamily
The importance of the gp130 cytokine receptor family to the
development and health of the individual is underscored by

and a common signal-transducing subunit of the ␤-chain family
of cytokine receptors. (a) Schematic diagram of the low-affinity and
high-affinity receptors for IL-3, IL-5, and GM-CSF. The cytokine-specific
subunits exhibit low-affinity binding and cannot transduce an activation signal. Noncovalent association of each subunit with a common
␤ subunit yields a high-affinity dimeric receptor that can transduce a
signal across the membrane. (b) Competition of ligand-binding chains
of different receptors for a common subunit can produce antagonistic
effects between cytokines. Here binding of IL-3 by ␣ subunits of the IL-3
receptor allows them to outcompete ␣ chains of the GM-CSF receptor
for ␤ subunits. [Part a adapted from T. Kishimoto et al., 1992, Interleukin-6 and its
receptor: A paradigm for cytokines, Science 258:593.]

the targeted disruption of gp130 in mice during embryonic
development is lethal. Receptors in this family include those
for IL-6, important in the initiation of the immune response,
and IL-12, critical for signaling differentiation of helper T
cells along the TH1 pathway. Targeted disruption of individual cytokine receptors, as well as of the cytokines themselves,
has provided much functional information about signaling
via these cytokine family members.
Cytokine specificity of the gp130 family of receptors is
determined by the regulated expression of ligand-specific
chains in dimers, or trimers, with the gp130 component. The

gp130 subunit family of cytokine receptors is further subdivided into receptors specific for monomeric cytokines, such as
IL-6, and those which bind the dimeric cytokines, such as IL-12.
Because the Hematopoietin (Class I) and Interferon
(Class II) cytokine receptor families utilize similar signaling
pathways, we will first describe the Interferons and their
receptors and then consider the signaling pathways used by
the two families together.

The Interferon (Class II) Cytokine Family Was
the First to Be Discovered
In the late 1950s, investigators studying two different viral
systems in two laboratories half a world apart almost simultaneously discovered interferons. Yasu-Ichi Nagano and Yashuhiko Kojima, Japanese virologists, were using a rabbit skin
and testes tissue culture model to develop a vaccine against
smallpox. They noted that immunization with a UV-inactivated
form of the cowpox virus resulted in the localized inhibition
of viral growth, following a subsequent injection of the same
virus. Viral growth inhibition was restricted to a small area of
skin close to the site of the original immunization, and the
scientists postulated that the initial injection had resulted in
the production of a “viral inhibitory factor.” After showing
that their “inhibitory factor” was not simply antibody, they
published a series of papers about it. With hindsight, scientists
now believe that their protective effect was mediated by interferons. However, the technical complexity of their system, and
the fact that their papers were published in French, rather
than in English, delayed the dissemination of their findings to
the broader scientific community.
Meanwhile, in London, Alick Isaacs and Jean Lindenman
were growing live influenza virus on chick egg chorioallantoic
membranes (a method that is still used today), and noticed
that exposure of their membranes to a heat-inactivated form
of influenza interfered with subsequent growth of a live virus
preparation on that surface preparation. They proved that the
growth inhibition resulted from the production of an inhibiting molecule by the chick membrane. They named it “interferon” because of its ability to “interfere” with the growth of
the live virus. Their more straightforward in vitro assay system
enabled them to rapidly characterize the biological effects of
the molecule involved, and they wrote a series of papers
describing the biological effects of interferon(s) in the late
1950s. However, since interferons are active at very low concentrations, it was not until 1978 that they were produced in
quantities sufficient for biochemical and crystallographic
analysis. Since that time, investigators have shown that there
are two major types of interferons, Types 1 and 2, and that
Type 1 interferons can be subdivided into two subgroups.
Interferons
Type I interferons are composed of Interferons ␣, a family of
about 20 related proteins, and interferon-␤, which are secreted
by activated macrophages and dendritic cells, as well as by
virus-infected cells. Interferons ␣ and ␤ are also secreted by

virally infected cells after recognition of viral components by
pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) located either at the
cell surface, or inside the cell (see Chapter 5). Intracellular
PRRs may interact with virally derived nucleic acids or with
endocytosed viral particles. The secreted Type I interferons
then interact in turn with membrane-bound interferon
receptors on the surfaces of many different cell types. The
results of their interaction with these receptors are discussed
in detail in Chapter 5, but they include the induction of ribonucleases that destroy viral (and cellular) RNA, and the cessation of cellular protein synthesis. Thus, interferons prevent
virally infected cells from replicating and from making new
viral particles. However, they simultaneously inhibit normal
cellular functions and destroy virally infected cells so that the
infection cannot spread.
Type I interferons are dimers of 18 to 20 kDa polypeptides,
predominantly helical in structure, and some members of this
family are naturally glycosylated. Type I interferons are used
in the treatment of a variety of human diseases, most notably
hepatitis infections.
Type II interferon, otherwise known as interferon-␥, is
produced by activated T and NK cells and is released as a
dimer (Figure 4-10). Interferon-␥ is a powerful modulator of

FIGURE 4-10 The complex between IFN-␥ and the ligandbinding chains of its receptor. This model is based on the x-ray
crystallographic analysis of a crystalline complex of interferon-␥ (dark
and light purple) bound to ligand-binding ␣ chains of the receptors
(green and yellow). Note that IFN-␥ is shown in its native dimeric
form; each member of the dimer engages the ␣ chain of an IFN-␥
receptor, thereby bringing about receptor dimerization and signal
transduction. [From M. R. Walter et al., 1995, Crystal structure of a complex

Introduction

CLINICAL FOCUS

Therapy with Interferons
Interferons are an extraordinary
group of proteins with important effects
on the immune system. Their actions
affect both the adaptive and the innate
arms of the immune system and include
the induction of increases in the expression of both Class I and Class II MHC molecules and the augmentation of NK-cell
activity. Cloning of the genes that encode
IFN-␣, IFN-␤, and IFN-␥ has made it possible for the biotechnology industry to
produce large amounts of each of these
interferons at costs that make their clinical
use practical (Table 1).
IFN-␣ (also known by its trade names
Roferon and Intron A) has been used for
the treatment of hepatitis C and hepatitis
B. It has also been found useful in a number of different applications in cancer
therapy. A type of B-cell leukemia known
as hairy-cell leukemia (because the cells
are covered with fine, hairlike cytoplasmic
projections) responds well to IFN-␣.
Chronic myelogenous leukemia, a disease
characterized by increased numbers of
granulocytes, begins with a slowly developing chronic phase that changes to an
accelerated phase and terminates in a
blast phase, which is usually resistant to
treatment. IFN-␣ is an effective treatment
for this leukemia in the chronic phase
(70% response rates have been reported),
and some patients (as many as 20% in
some studies) undergo complete remission. Kaposi’s sarcoma, the cancer most
often seen in AIDS patients in the United
States, also responds to treatment with
IFN-␣, and there are reports of a trend
toward longer survival and fewer oppor-

tunistic infections in patients treated with
this agent. Most of the effects mentioned
above have been obtained in clinical
studies that used IFN-␣ alone, but certain
applications such as hepatitis C therapy
commonly use it with an antiviral drug
such as ribavirin. The clearance time of
IFN-␣ is lengthened by using it in a form
complexed with polyethylene glycol
(PEG) called pegylated interferon.
IFN-␤ has emerged as the first drug
capable of producing clinical improvement in multiple sclerosis (MS). Young
adults are the primary target of this autoimmune neurologic disease, in which
nerves in the central nervous system
(CNS) undergo demyelination. This results
in progressive neurologic dysfunction,
leading to significant and, in many cases,
severe disability. This disease is often characterized by periods of nonprogression
and remission alternating with periods of
relapse. Treatment with IFN-␤ provides
longer periods of remission and reduces
the severity of relapses. Furthermore,
magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies of CNS damage in treated and
untreated patients revealed that MSinduced damage was less severe in a
group of IFN-␤⫺treated patients than in
untreated ones.
IFN-␥ has been used, with varying
degrees of success, to treat a variety of
malignancies that include non-Hodgkin’s
lymphoma, cutaneous T-cell lymphoma,
and multiple myeloma. A more successful
clinical application of IFN-␥ in the clinic is
in the treatment of the hereditary immunodeficiency chronic granulomatous dis-

the adaptive immune response, biasing T cell help toward
the TH1 type and inducing the activation of macrophages,
with subsequent destruction of any intracellular pathogens
and the differentiation of cytotoxic T cells. All three interferons increase the expression of MHC complex proteins on the
surface of cells, thus enhancing their antigen-presentation
capabilities.

ease (CGD; see Chapter 18). CGD features
a serious impairment of the ability of
phagocytic cells to kill ingested microbes,
and patients with CGD suffer recurring
infections by a number of bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella, Pseudomonas,
and others) and fungi such as Aspergillus
and Candida. Before interferon therapy,
standard treatment for the disease
included attempts to avoid infection,
aggressive administration of antibiotics,
and surgical drainage of abscesses. A failure to generate microbicidal oxidants
(H2O2, superoxide, and others) is the basis
of CGD, and the administration of IFN-␥
significantly reverses this defect. Therapy
of CGD patients with IFN-␥ significantly
reduces the incidence of infections. Also,
the infections that are contracted are less
severe, and the average number of days
spent by patients in the hospital is
reduced.
IFN-␥ has also been shown to be effective in the treatment of osteopetrosis (not
osteoporosis), a life-threatening congenital
disorder characterized by overgrowth of
bone that results in blindness and deafness. Another problem presented by this
disease is that the buildup of bone
reduces the amount of space available for
bone marrow, and the decrease in hematopoiesis results in fewer red blood cells
and anemia. The decreased generation of
white blood cells causes an increased
susceptibility to infection.
The use of interferons in clinical
practice is likely to expand as more is
learned about their effects in combination with other therapeutic agents.

Interferon-␥ is used medically to bias the adaptive immune
system toward a cytotoxic response in diseases such as leprosy and toxoplasmosis, in which antibody responses are less
effective than those that destroy infected cells. Clinical Focus
Box 4-2 describes additional roles of interferons in the clinic.
Minority members of the Interferon family of cytokines
include IL-10, secreted by monocytes and by T, B, and

Introduction

members of the Hematopoietin receptor family. Initially,
only interferon-␣, -␤, and -␥ were thought to be ligands for
these receptors. However, recent work has shown that the
receptor family consists of 12 receptor chains that, in their
various assortments, bind no fewer than 27 different cytokines, including six members of the IL-10 family, 17 Type I
interferons, one Type II interferon, and three members of
the recently described interferon–␭ family, including IL-28A,
IL-28B, and IL-29.
The JAK-STAT Signaling Pathway
Early experiments in cytokine signaling demonstrated that a
series of protein tyrosine phosphorylations rapidly followed
the interaction of a cytokine with a receptor from the Class I
or Class II cytokine receptor families. These results were
initially puzzling, since the cytokine receptors lack the
immunotyrosine activation motifs (ITAMs) characteristic of
B- and T-cell receptors. However, studies of the molecular
events triggered by binding of interferon gamma (IFN-␥) to
its receptor shed light on the mode of signal transduction
used by members of both the Hematopoietin and Interferon
cytokine families.
In the absence of cytokine, the receptor subunits are
associated only loosely with one another in the plane of the
membrane, and the cytoplasmic region of each of the
receptor subunits is associated noncovalently with inactive
tyrosine kinases named Janus Activated Kinases (JAKs).
(Some members of this family of kinases retain their earlier
name of Tyk, but share structural and functional properties
with the JAK family of kinases.) The process of signal
transduction from Class I and Class II cytokine receptors
has been shown to proceed according to the following steps
(Figure 4-11):

•

Cytokine binding induces the association of the two separate cytokine receptor subunits and activation of the
receptor-associated JAKs.

•

The receptor-associated JAKs phosphorylate specific
tyrosines in the receptor subunits.

•

These phosphorylated tyrosine residues serve as docking
sites for inactive transcription factors known as Signal
Transducers and Activators of Transcription (STATs).

•

The inactive STATs are phosphorylated by JAK and Tyk
kinases.

•

Phosphorylated STAT transcription factors dimerize,
binding to one another via SH2/phosphotyrosine
interactions.

•

Phosphorylation also results in a conformational change in
the STAT dimer that reveals a nuclear localization signal.

•

The STAT dimer translocates into the nucleus, where it
initiates the transcription of specific genes.

Currently, we know of seven STAT proteins (STAT 1-4,
5A, 5B, and 6) and four JAK proteins (JAK 1–3 and Tyk2) in

FIGURE 4-11 General model of signal transduction mediated by most Class I and Class II cytokine receptors. Binding of
a cytokine induces dimerization of the receptor subunits, which leads
to the activation of receptor subunit-associated JAK tyrosine kinases
by reciprocal phosphorylation. Subsequently, the activated JAKs
phosphorylate various tyrosine residues, resulting in the creation of
docking sites for STATs on the receptor and the activation of one or
more STAT transcription factors. The phosphorylated STATs dimerize
and translocate to the nucleus, where they activate transcription of
specific genes.

mammals. Specific STATs play essential roles in the signaling
pathways of a wide variety of cytokines (Table 4-4).
Given the generality of this pathway among Class I and
Class II cytokines, how does the immune system induce a
specific response to each cytokine? First, there is exquisite
specificity in the binding of cytokines to their receptors. Secondly, particular cytokine receptors are bound to specific
partner JAK enzymes that in turn activate unique STAT transcription factors. Third, the transcriptional activity of activated STATs is specific because a particular STAT homodimer
or heterodimer will only recognize certain sequence motifs
and thus can interact only with the promoters of certain
genes. Finally, only those target genes whose expression is
permitted by a particular cell type can be activated within
that variety of cell. For example, promoter regions in some
cell types may be caught up in heterochromatin and

inaccessible to transcription factors. In this way, the Class I
cytokine IL-4 can induce one set of genes in T cells, another
in B cells, and yet a third in eosinophils.
JAK-STAT pathways are not unique to the immune system. Among the many genes known to be regulated by
mammalian STAT proteins are those encoding cell survival
factors such as the Bcl-2 family members, those involved in
cell proliferation such as cyclin D1 and myc, and those implicated in angiogenesis or metastasis such as vascular endothelial growth factor, or VEGF.
At the close of cytokine signaling, negative regulators of
the STAT pathway, such as protein inhibitor of activated
STAT (PIAS), suppressor of cytokine signaling (SOCS), and
protein tyrosine phosphatases are believed to be responsible
for turning off JAK-STAT signaling and returning the cell to
a quiescent state.

Members of the TNF Cytokine Family Can
Signal Development, Activation, or Death
The Tumor Necrosis Family (TNF) family of cytokines
regulates the development, effector function, and homeostasis of cells participating in the skeletal, neuronal, and
immune systems, among others.
Cytokines of the TNF Family Can Be Soluble
or Membrane Bound
TNF-related cytokines are unusual in that they are often
firmly anchored into the cell membrane. Generally they are
Type 2 transmembrane proteins with a short, intracytoplasmic N-terminal region, and a longer, extracellular C-terminal
region. The extracellular region typically contains a canonical TNF-homology domain responsible for interaction with
the cytokine receptors. Members of the TNF family can also act
as soluble mediators, following cleavage of their extracellular

regions, and in some cases, the same cytokine exists in both
soluble and membrane-bound forms.
There are two eponymous (having the same name as)
members of the TNF family: TNF-␣ and TNF-␤, though
TNF-␤ is more commonly known as Lymphotoxin-␣, or LT-␣.
Both of these are secreted as soluble proteins. TNF-␣ (frequently referred to simply as TNF) is a proinflammatory
cytokine, produced primarily by activated macrophages, but
also by other cell types including lymphocytes, fibroblasts,
and keratinocytes (skin cells), in response to infection,
inflammation, and environmental stressors. TNF elicits its
biological effects by binding to its receptors, TNF-R1 or
TNF-R2, which are described below. Lymphotoxin-␣ is produced by activated lymphocytes and can deliver a variety of
signals. On binding to neutrophils, endothelial cells, and
osteoclasts (bone cells), Lymphotoxin-␣ delivers activation
signals; in other cells, binding of Lymphotoxin-␣ can lead to
increased expression of MHC glycoproteins and of adhesion
molecules.
We will also encounter five physiologically significant,
membrane-bound members of the TNF cytokine family
throughout this book. Lymphotoxin-␤, a membrane-bound
cytokine, is important in lymphocyte differentiation. We will
learn about BAFF and APRIL in the context of B-cell development and homeostasis (Chapter 10). CD40L is a cytokine
expressed on the surface of T cells that is required to signal
for B-cell differentiation (Chapter 12). Fas ligand (FasL), or
CD95L, induces apoptosis on binding to its cognate receptor,
Fas, or CD95.
Whether membrane-bound or in soluble form, active
cytokines of the TNF family assemble into trimers. Although
in most cases they are homotrimeric, heterotrimeric cytokines
do form between the TNF family members Lymphotoxin-␣
and Lymphotoxin-␤ and between APRIL and BAFF. Crystallographic analysis of TNF family members has revealed that

Introduction
tant questions still await resolution. One reason that these
pathways have been so difficult to define is that the same
receptor, TNF-R1, can transduce both activating and deathpromoting signals, depending on the local cellular and
molecular environment in which the signal is received, and
investigators have yet to determine the trigger that shifts the
signaling program from life to death. However, much is
known about how each of these signaling pathways work,
once that all-important decision has been made.
We will start by describing the proapoptotic (deathinducing) pathway that is initiated when the membranebound TNF family member FasL on one cell binds to a Fas
receptor on a second cell, leading to death in the cell bearing
the Fas receptor. With this as our foundation, we will then
illustrate how the TNF-R1 receptor mediates both life- and
death- promoting signals. Signaling through other TNF-R
family members, such as CD40, BAFF, and April, will be
described in later chapters in the context of the various
immune responses in which they are involved.

FIGURE 4-12 The TNF-family members act as trimers in
vivo. [PDB ID 1TNF]

they have a conserved tertiary structure and fold into a
␤-sheet sandwich. The conserved residues direct the folding
in the internal ␤ strands that, in turn, promote the trimer
formation (Figure 4-12).
TNF Receptors
Members of the TNF receptor superfamily are defined by the
presence of Cysteine-Rich Domains (CRDs) in the extracellular, ligand-binding domain. Each CRD typically contains
six cysteine residues, which form three disulfide bonded
loops, and individual members of the superfamily can contain from one to six CRDs.
Although most TNF receptors are Type 1 membrane proteins (their N-terminals are outside the cell), a few family
members are cleaved from the membrane to form soluble
receptor variants. Alternatively, some lack a membrane
anchoring domain at all, or are linked to the membrane only
by covalently bound, glycolipid anchors. These soluble forms
of TNF family receptors are known as “decoy receptors,” as
they are capable of intercepting the signal from the ligand
before it can reach a cell, effectively blocking the signal. This
is a theme that we have encountered before in our consideration of the IL-1 receptor family.
Signaling Through TNF Superfamily Receptors
The work of delineating the precise pathways of signaling
through TNF family receptors is ongoing, and some impor-

Signaling Through the Fas Receptor
At the close of an immune response, when the pathogen is
safely demolished and the immune system needs to eliminate the extra lymphocytes it has generated to deal with the
invader, responding lymphocytes begin to express the TNF
family receptor Fas on their cell surfaces. Fas, and its ligand
FasL, are specialized members of the TNF receptor and the
TNF cytokine families, respectively, and they work together
to promote lymphocyte homeostasis. Mice with mutations
in either the fas (mrl/lpr mice) or the fasL (gld mice) genes
consequently suffer from severe lympho-proliferative disorders, indicative of their inability to eliminate lymphocytes
that are no longer serving a useful purpose.
On interaction with other immune cells bearing FasL,
the Fas receptor trimerizes and transduces a signal to the
interior of the Fas-bearing cell that results in its elimination by apoptosis. Apoptosis, or programmed cell death,
is a mechanism of cell death in which the cell dies from
within and is fragmented into membrane-bound vesicles
that can be rapidly phagocytosed by neighboring macrophages (Figure 4-13a). By using such well-controlled apoptotic pathways, the organism ensures that minimal
inflammation is associated with the natural end of an
immune response. Activation of the apoptotic pathway
invokes the activation of caspases; these are proteases,
bearing Cysteine residues at their active sites, which cleave
after ASPartic acid residues.
Binding of Fas to FasL results in the clustering of the Fas
receptors (Figure 4-13b). This, in turn, promotes interaction between their cytoplasmic regions, which include
domains common to a number of proapoptotic signaling
molecules called death domains. This type of interaction,
between homologous protein domains expressing affinity
for one another, is referred to as a homotypic interaction. As
they bind to one another, the clustered Fas protein death
domains incorporate death domains from the adapter

the DED domains of procaspase-8 into the membrane complex.
Clustering of procaspase-8 induces cleavage of the pro domains
of procaspase-8, leading to the release of the active caspase-8
protease. Caspase-8 cleaves the pro domains from the executioner caspases, caspase-3 and caspase-7, which in turn cleave
and activate nucleases leading to the degradation of nuclear
DNA. Caspase-8 also cleaves and activates the proapoptotic Bcl-2
family member protein, BID. [Taimen, Pekka and Kallajoki, Markku.

protein FADD (Fas-Associated Death Domain-containing
protein). FADD contains not only death domains, but also a
related type of domain called a Death Effector Domain
(DED). This, in turn, binds homotypically to the DED
domains of procaspase-8, resulting in the clustering of
procaspase-8 molecules. Procaspase-8 molecules contain
the active caspase-8 enzyme, held in an inactive state by
binding to prodomains.
The multimerization of procaspase-8 molecules results in
mutual cleavage of their prodomains and induces capsase-8
activation. Caspase-8 then cleaves many target proteins

critical to the generation of apoptosis. The target proteins of
caspase-8 include the executioner caspases, -3 and -7 (which
cleave and activate nucleases leading to the degradation of
nuclear DNA), and the proapoptotic Bcl-2 family member
BID. The complex of Fas, FADD, and procaspase-8 is
referred to as the Death-Inducing Signaling Complex
(DISC). The ultimate result of activation of this cascade is
the condensation of nuclear material (see Figure 4-13a), the
degradation of nuclear DNA into 240 base pair, nucleic acid
fragments, and the subsequent breakdown of the cell into
“easily digestible” membrane-bound fragments.

Introduction

Signaling Through the TNF-R1 Receptor
The TNF-R1 receptor is present on the surface of all vertebrate cells and, like Fas, has an intracytoplasmic death
domain (DD). Although this receptor is capable of binding
to both TNF-␣ and Lymphotoxin-␣, we will focus on the
signaling that is elicited by TNF-␣ (TNF). TNF binding to
the TNF-R1 receptor can lead to two very different outcomes: apoptosis (death) or survival (life). How it does so is
still the focus of intensive investigation, but the story as it is
unfolding is already a fascinating one.
The mechanism by which TNF binding leads to apoptosis
is slightly different from that which follows Fas-FasL binding. Like FasL, binding of TNF to the TNF-R1 receptor
induces trimerization of the receptor as well as an alteration
in its conformation, and these together result in the binding
of a DD-containing adapter molecule, in this case TRADD,
to the internal face of the receptor molecule (Figure 4-14).
The TRADD adapter molecule provides additional binding
sites for the components RIP1 (a serine/threonine kinase,
rather evocatively named Rest In Peace 1), which binds via
its own DDs and TRAF2, the TNF Receptor Associated Factor 2. This is known as complex I. Intracellular localization
experiments have shown that this complex can dissociate
from the TNF-R at the membrane, and migrate to the cytoplasm where it binds to the now familiar DD-containing protein FADD. FADD recruits procaspase-8, as described above,
resulting in the generation of an apoptotic signal. The proapoptotic cytoplasmic complex generated upon TNF-R1
receptor binding is shown in Figure 4-14a as complex II.
Counterintuitively, binding of this same molecule, TNF,
to the same receptor, TNF-R1, can result in the delivery of
survival as well as of proapoptotic signals. How can the same
cytokine, acting through the same receptor, bring about two
apparently opposing actions?
In the TNF-mediated survival pathway (Figure 4-14b),
the generation of the original membrane complex appears to
initiate in the same general manner as for the proapoptotic
pathway. However, in the case of the prosurvival pathway,
the TRADD-containing complex does not dissociate from
the membrane, but rather remains at the cell surface and
recruits a number of other components, including the ubiquitin ligases cIAP1 and cIAP2.
Once cIAP1 and cIAP2 join the TNF-R1 complex at the
cell membrane, they recruit the LUBAC proteins, which
attach linear ubiquitin chains to RIP1. Polyubiquitinated
RIP1 then binds to the NEMO component of IKK as well as
to TAK1, which is already complexed with its associated
TAB proteins as described above. RIP1 and TAK1 activate
the IKK complex, leading to I␬B phosphorylation and
destruction, and subsequent activation of NF-␬B. Once
NF-␬B is fully activated, it turns on the expression of the
cFLIP protein that then inhibits the activity of caspase-8.
This effectively shuts down the antagonistic, proapoptotic
pathway (Figure 4-14a). As previously described, the TAK1
complex also acts to activate the MAP kinase pathway, which
further enhances survival signaling.

Signaling through TNF-R family receptors can lead to pro- or antiapoptotic outcomes depending on the nature of the signal, the
receptor, and the cellular context. (a) Apoptosis. Binding of TNF to
TNF-R1 induces trimerization of the receptor and conformational
alteration in its cytoplasmic domain, resulting in the recruitment of
the DD-containing adapter molecule TRADD to the cytoplasmic face
of the receptor. TRADD binds to the serine-threonine kinase RIP1 and
the TNF receptor associated factor TRAF2. This complex of TRADD,
RIP1, and TRAF2, known as complex I, dissociates from the receptor
and migrates to the cytoplasm where it binds to the adapter protein
FADD. FADD recruits procaspase-8, leading to apoptosis as described
in Figure 4-13. The proapoptotic complex generated upon TNF-R1
receptor binding is shown as Complex II. (b). Survival. As for the apoptotic pathway, TNF ligation results in receptor trimerization, TRADD
binding, and RIP1 recruitment. In this case, however, TRADD also
recruits the ubiquitin ligases cIAP1 and cIAP2, which in turn bind to
the proteins of the linear ubiquitin assembly complex (LUBAC) proteins. Polyubiquitination of RIP1 allows it to bind to the NEMO component of the IKK complex as well as to TAK1. TAK1 and RIP1 together
activate the IKK complex, leading to I␬B phosphorylation and
destruction, and release of NF-␬B to enter the nucleus. Among other
prosurvival effects, NF-␬B activates the transcription of the cFLIP
protein, which inhibits caspase-8 action, thus tipping the scales in
favor of survival. The TAK1 complex also activates MAP kinase signaling, which enhances cell survival.

Receptors and Signaling: Cytokines and Chemokines
The survival versus death decisions that are made at the
level of the TNF-R1 receptor depend upon the outcome of
the race between the generation of active caspase-8 on the
one hand and the generation of the caspase-8 inhibitor cFLIP
on the other. Although we now understand the molecular
mechanisms that bring about the consequences of these
decisions, we still have much to learn regarding how the cell
integrates the signals received through TNF-R1 with other
signals delivered to the cell in order to determine which of
the two competing pathways will prevail. Since the generation of the membrane-bound complex that is capable of
activating NF-␬B is entirely dependent on interactions
between various ubiquitinated proteins, it now appears that
the life-death decision for a cell may be executed by a small
protein previously thought to have only destructive intent.

The IL-17 Family Is a Recently Discovered,
Proinflammatory Cytokine Cluster
The most recently described family of cytokines, the IL-17
family, includes interleukins 17A, 17B, 17C, 17D, and 17F.
Signaling through most members of this family culminates
in the generation of inflammation. IL-17 receptors are found
on neutrophils, keratinocytes, and other nonlymphoid cells.
Members of the IL-17 family therefore appear to occupy a

location at the interface of innate and adaptive immunity.
IL-17 cytokines do not share sequence similarity with other
cytokines, but intriguingly the amino acid sequence of
IL-17A is 58% identical to an open reading frame (ORF13)
found in a T-cell–tropic herpesvirus. The significance of this
sequence relationship is so far unknown; did the virus hijack
the cytokine sequence for its own needs, or did the pilfering
occur in the opposite direction?
IL-17 Cytokines
IL-17A, the first member of this family to be identified, is
released by activated T cells and stimulates the production of
factors that signal a proinflammatory state, including IL-6,
CXCL8, and granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF).
As characterization of IL-17A and the T cells that secreted it
progressed, it became clear that the T cells secreting this
cytokine represent a new lineage, the TH17 cell subset, which
is currently the focus of intense investigation (see Chapter
11). Genomic sequencing has since led to the identification
of a number of homologs of IL-17A (see Table 4-5). Most of
the interleukins in the IL-17 family share the property of
operating at the interface of innate and adaptive immunity,
serving to coordinate the release of proinflammatory and
neutrophil-mobilizing cytokines. However, IL-17E provides an exception to this general rule, instead promoting

FIGURE 4-15 The IL-17 family of cytokines and their associated receptors. The cytokines that form the IL-17 family share
a highly conserved structure, with four conserved cysteines. Only
one of the proteins has so far been subject to x-ray analysis, which
demonstrates that the structure is that of a “cysteine knot,” a
tightly folded protein that exists naturally as a dimer. The five proteins that make up the IL-17 receptor family are IL-17RA, IL-17RB,
IL-17RC, IL-17RD, and IL-17RE. These are arranged into homo- and
hetero- dimers and trimers to create the complete receptor mol-

the differentiation of the anti-inflammatory TH2 subclass,
while suppressing further TH17 cell responses, in what
amounts to a negative feedback loop.
In general, members of the IL-17 family exist as homodimers, but heterodimers of IL-17A and IL-17F have been
described. Monomeric units of IL-17 family members range in
molecular weight from 17.3 to 22.8 kDa, and crystallographic
analysis has revealed that they share a structure that is primarily ␤ sheet in nature, stabilized by intrachain disulfide bonds.
The IL-17 Family Receptors
The IL-17 receptor family is composed of five protein chains—
IL-17RA, IL-17RB, IL-17RC, IL-17RD, and IL-17RE—which
are variously arranged into homo- and hetero- dimeric and
trimeric units to form the complete receptor molecules (Figure 4-15). Members of the IL-17 receptor family share fibronectin domains with the Hematopoietin and Interferon family
cytokine receptors and are single transmembrane proteins.
They all contain cytoplasmic SEF/IL-17R (Similar Expression
to Fibroblast growth factor interleukin 17 Receptor, or SEFIR)
domains, responsible for mediating the protein-protein interactions of the IL-17R signal transduction pathway. The IL17RA chain also contains a TIR-like loop (TILL) domain,
analogous to structures found in the Toll and IL-1 receptor
molecules, as well as a C/EBP␤ activation domain (CBAD),
capable of activating the C/EBP␤ transcription factor.
Signaling Through IL-17 Receptors
Analogous to signaling through IL-1 receptors, signaling
through most IL-17 receptors results in an inflammatory
response, and so it should not come as a surprise to learn
that signaling through the IL-17 receptor results in activa-

domain that is important in mediating downstream signaling
events. The IL-17RA protein also includes a TIR-like loop domain
(TILL), similar to that found in Toll-like receptors and IL-1 receptors,
as well as a C/EBP␤ activation domain, capable of interacting with
the downstream transcription factor C/EBP. [Adapted from S. Gaffen,

tion of NF-␬B, a hallmark transcription factor of inflammation. Details of the signaling pathways that emanate from the
IL-17R are still being worked out, but Figure 4-16 illustrates
the major features of our current knowledge.

NF-␬B activation via IL-17RA and IL-17RC. Binding of
IL-17A to the receptor molecules IL-17RA and IL-17RC
results in the recruitment of the adapter protein ACT1 to
the SEFIR domain. ACT1 binds other proteins, including
TRAF3 and TRAF6, which then engage with the TAK1
complex. TAK1 activation results in the phosphorylation
and inactivation of the inhibitor of NF-␬B (I␬B), allowing
NF-␬B activation and nuclear migration.

2.

Activation of MAP kinase pathway and cytokine mRNA
stabilization. Adapter proteins bound to the receptor also
recruit components of the MAP kinase pathway, resulting
in the activation of MAP kinases, including the extracellular signal-regulated kinase Erk1. Though unusual, it
appears that the most important role of Erk1 in IL-17
signaling is not in the generation of phosphorylated
transcription factors (as is the case for its involvement in
TCR- and BCR-mediated cell signaling), but rather in
controlling the stability of cytokine mRNA transcripts.
Many of the target genes of IL-17 signaling are cytokines
and chemokines whose transcription is up-regulated on
receipt of an IL-17 signal. The levels of cytokine mRNA
are controlled in part by binding of the cytoplasmic protein tristetraprolin to AU-rich elements (AREs) in the
3⬘-untranslated regions of mRNA transcripts. Tristetraprolin then delivers the cytokine mRNAs to the exosome
complexes of the cells, where they are degraded. However,
phosphorylation of tristetraprolin by MAP kinases inhibits

which promote expression of IL-6, one of the quintessential inflammatory cytokines.

Chemokines are a structurally related family of small cytokines that bind to cell-surface receptors and induce the
movement of leukocytes up a concentration gradient and
toward the chemokine source. This soluble factor-directed
cell movement is known as chemotaxis, and molecules that
can elicit such movement are referred to as chemoattractants
(Box 4-3). Some chemokines display innate affinity for the
carbohydrates named glycosaminoglycans, located on the
surfaces of endothelial cells, a property that enables them to
bind to the inner surfaces of blood vessels and set up a cellbound chemoattractant gradient along blood vessel walls,
directing leukocyte movement.
Chemokine Structure
Chemokines are relatively low in molecular weight (7.5–
12.5kDa) and structurally homologous. The tertiary structure of chemokines is constrained by a set of highly conserved
disulfide bonds; the positions of the cysteine residues determine the classification of the chemokines into six different
structural categories (Figure 4-17). Within any one category,
chemokines may share 30% to 99% sequence identity.
The grouping of chemokines into the subclasses shown in
Figure 4-17 has functional, as well as structural, significance.
For example, the seven human CXC chemokines within the
ELR subclass share the same receptor (CXCR2), attract neutrophils, are angiogenic, and have greater than 40% sequence
identity. (A substance is angiogenic if it promotes the formation of new blood vessels; it is angiostatic if it prevents the
formation of new blood vessels.) The non-ELR, CXCL chemokines CXCL9, CXCL10, and CXCL11, are also more than
40% identical to one another; however, this group is angiostatic, not angiogenic, and utilizes the CXCR4 receptor.
Members of the two, structurally distinct CC groups are
chemoattractants that attract monocytes and macrophages
(although not neutrophils) to the site of infection. See
Appendix III for a more comprehensive tabulation of chemokines and their immunologic roles.
Chemokine Receptors
In the 1950s, investigations of the mechanisms by which
glucagon and adrenaline signaling led to an increase in the
rate of glycogen metabolism revealed the existence of a class
of receptors that threads through the membrane seven times
and transduces the ligand signal via interactions with a polymeric GTP/GDP-binding “G protein.” This class of G-Protein–
Coupled Receptors (GPCRs) is used in the recognition of
many types of signals, including those mediated by chemokines. Certain essential features of this pathway are conserved in all GPCR-type responses. (These larger, polymeric,
seven membrane pass receptor-associated G proteins are
different from the small, monomeric G proteins such as ras,
which participate farther downstream in intracellular signaling pathways. Although both types of G proteins are

Introduction

ADVANCES

How Does Chemokine Binding to a Cell-Surface Receptor Result
in Cellular Movement Along the Chemokine Gradient?
Chemotaxis is

the mechanism by
which the speed and direction of cell
movement are controlled by a concentration gradient of signaling molecules.
Receptors on the surface of responsive
cells bind to chemotactic factors and
direct the cell to move toward the source
of factor secretion. Chemotaxis was recognized as a biological phenomenon as
early as the 1880s, and is found in organisms as simple as bacteria, which use
chemotaxis to locate sources of nutrition.
However, only as scientists have developed the ability to analyze signaling pathways and to observe the movement of
individual cells under in vivo conditions
have we been able to approach a mechanistic understanding of the complex
series of intracellular events that culminate in chemically directed cell movement in the immune system. Although
we still do not understand all the details of
this process, some general principles have
begun to emerge.
We first address the means by which
cells sense chemoattractant signals. We
next develop an appreciation for how
cells move, and finally we can describe a
little of what we know regarding how
they become polarized in order to direct
their movement as specified by the chemotactic signal.

SIGNAL SENSING
Leukocytes recognize chemoattractant signals, or chemokines, using the G-protein–
coupled receptors described in this chapter.
Such receptors are located at the plasma
membrane, and the cytoplasmic face of

these receptors is associated with a polymeric G protein, so called because of its
affinity for guanosine phosphates. On binding to its chemokine ligand, the receptor
alters its conformation, passing on that
conformational change to its associated G
protein. The bound G protein then loses
affinity for guanosine diphosphate (GDP)
and instead binds guanosine triphosphate
(GTP), thus achieving its active conformation. Next, the G protein dissociates into
two subunits, termed G␣-GTP and G␤␥.
The signaling pathways emanating from
each of these subunits are described in
the text. It is difficult to overstate the
effectiveness of these receptor signals in
determining the direction and speed of
cellular movement. For example, neutrophils can recognize and move in response
to extremely shallow chemoattractant
gradients, in which the concentration of
the chemoattractant at the front of the
gradient is as little as 2% higher than that
at the back.

and almost like wires (filopodia), or protrude from the surface of the cell like a
sheet (lamellipodia). The nucleus of the
migrating cell lies behind these protrusions in the cell body, and at the posterior
part of the cell lies a near-cylindrical tail,
the uropod, which may be as long as 10 ␮m.

HOW CELLS MOVE
Figure 1 illustrates a model of amoeboid
cellular movement, the mechanism used
by leukocytes. Ameboid migration is a
rapid type of cell movement; leukocytes
and stem cells, which use this mode of
migration, may move as quickly as 30 ␮m/
minute. Cells routinely move over other
cells and tissues (the substrata) by first
forming cellular protrusions at their leading edge—the edge closest to the direction of movement. Depending on the cell
type and the nature of the chemoattractant signal, these protrusions may be thin,

BOX 4-3
The protrusions at the leading edge of
a moving leukocyte form noncovalent
attachments to the substratum using
adhesive interactions between proteins
on the cell protrusion and other proteins
on the substratum. The substratum may,
for example, be a capillary endothelial cell,
when a white blood cell rolls along the
inside of a blood capillary. Alternatively,
during leukocyte movement within a
lymph node, the adhesive interaction may

occur between B or T lymphocyte surface
integrins and proteins located on a cellular extension from a follicular reticular cell.
Once the migrating cell is temporarily
attached to the substratum, contractions
of the cell body mediated by actin and
myosin, and resulting cytoskeletal rearrangements, bring the rest of the cell forward toward the leading edge and then
the cycle of reaching forward with cellular
protrusions and contraction of the rest of
the cell in the direction of the leading
edge can recur.

GENERATION OF POLARITY SIGNALS:
HOW CELLS DECIDE ON THE
DIRECTION OF MOVEMENT

neutrophil exposed to a chemoattractant organizes filamentous actin at the protrusions on the

here stained green). [Fei Wang, The signaling mechanisms underlying cell polarity and chemotaxis. ColdSpring Harbor Perspectives in Biology, October 2009,

Upon receipt of a chemotactic signal,
leukocytes polarize very rapidly, and leukocyte locomotion is clearly visible within
30 seconds after the receipt of the chemokine by the cell.
Scientists initially hypothesized that
movement of a leukocyte toward a particular chemoattractant may result from
an asymmetric distribution of chemoattractant receptors on the cell surface,
with a higher concentration of receptors
localized to the leading edge of the cell.
However, microscopic observations suggest that this initial hypothesis was incorrect. Instead, investigators found an
asymmetrical distribution of signaling
molecules and cytoskeletal components
(Figure 2). Thus, although there is a uniform distribution of receptors on the cell
surface, the distribution of occupied
receptors is asymmetrical, which means
that the signal received from chemokines
on the side of the cell facing the chemokine source is stronger than that received
elsewhere on the cell surface. The ultimate result of this asymmetrical signal
from the occupied receptors is an internal

redistribution of signaling pathway components and cytoskeletal elements; this
in turn causes the cell to move toward
the source of the signal.
Many of the signaling pathways that
mediate this directional movement are
already familiar to you from Chapter 3
and from this chapter. The ␤␥ dimer of
the activated G protein recruits a particular subclass of PI3 kinase enzymes to
the inner leaflet of the leading edge of
the membrane, where it phosphorylates
PIP2 and other phosphatidyl inositol
phosphates. These phosphorylated lipids then serve as docking sites for PHdomain–containing proteins, including
Akt, which in turn phosphorylates downstream effectors leading to actin polymerization. Depending on the cell type
and the nature of the stimulation, the
small GTPases Rac, Cdc42, and Rho are
also implicated in the chemokinemediated cytoskeletal modifi cations
that are necessary for cell movement,
and these are activated via tyrosine
kinases in lymphocytes and by pathways
that are as yet not fully characterized in
other leukocyte cell types.
A cell can only move in response to a
gradient if the trailing edge of the cell
moves at the same rate as the leading
edge, and the uropod of moving leukocytes is susceptible to its own set of
G-protein–mediated signals. Following
redistribution of the internal signaling
components, the chemokine receptors at
the trailing edge of the cell are coupled to
a set of G-protein trimers different from
those at the leading edge. Interaction of
the uropod-localized G-Protein–Coupled
Receptors (GPCRs) leads to the formation
and contraction of actin-myosin complexes and subsequent retraction of the
uropod.

FIGURE 4-17 Disulfide bridges in chemokine structures.
A schematic of the locations of cysteine residues in chemokines that
shows how the locations of cysteines determine chemokine class.
Chemokines are proteins of small molecular weight which share two,
four, or six conserved cysteine residues at particular points in their
sequence that form intrachain disulfide bonds. The number of cyste-

activated by GTP binding, their structures and functions
are quite different).
The GPCRs are classified according to the type of chemokine they bind. For example, the CC receptors (CCRs) recognize CC chemokines, the CXCRs recognize CXCL
chemokines, and so on. Chemokine receptors bind to their
respective ligands quite tightly (Kd ≅ 10⫺9 M). Interestingly,
the intrinsic specificity of the receptors is balanced by the
capacity of many receptors to bind more than one chemokine from a particular family and of several chemokines to
bind to more than one receptor. For example, the receptor
CXCR2 recognizes seven different chemokines, and CCL5
can bind to both CCR3 and CCR5.
Signaling Through Chemokine Receptors
The cytoplasmic faces of seven membrane pass GPCRs associate with intracellular, trimeric GTP-binding proteins
consisting of G␣, G␤, and G␥ subunits (Figure 4-18a).
When the receptor site is unoccupied, the G␣ subunit of the
trimeric G protein binds to GDP. Chemokine ligation to the
receptor results in a conformational change that is transmitted to the G protein and in turn induces an exchange of GDP
for GTP at the G␣ binding site that is analogous to what
occurs upon GTP binding to the small GTP-binding proteins such as Ras. This results in the dissociation of the G
protein into a G␣-GTP monomer and a G␤␥ dimer. In the
case of the chemokine receptor associated G proteins,
chemokine signaling is mediated by both the dissociated
G␤␥ dimer (which has no nucleotide binding site) and the
G␣-GTP subunit.
Just as for the small G-protein–coupled pathways, the
duration of signaling through the chemokine receptor is
limited by the intrinsic GTPase activity of the G␣ subunit,
which in turn can be increased by GTPase Activating

ines as well as the positions of the disulfide bonds determine the
subclass of these cytokines as shown. The overscores indicate the
cysteines between which disulfide bonds are made. The naming of
chemokines in part reflects the cysteine-determined class (see
Appendix III). [Adapted from W. E. Paul, 2008, Fundamental Immunology,
6th ed. Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, Philadelphia, Figure 26.1]

Proteins (GAPs), also known as Regulators of G-protein
Signaling (RGSs). Because the pathway is active only when
the protein binds to GTP, GAPs down-regulate the activity
mediated by the receptor (see Figure 3-15). Once the GTP in
the G␣ binding site is hydrolyzed to GDP, G␣ re-associates
with the G␤␥ dimers, effectively terminating signaling.
There are multiple subtypes of G␣ and G␤ subunits that vary
in representation between different cell types. Signaling
through different subunits can give rise to different consequences, depending on the downstream pathways that are
elicited. Just as for the small G protein, there are several different large polymeric G proteins, which vary in their cellular distribution and receptor partners.
Once released from its G␣ partner, the G␤␥ subunit of
the trimeric G protein activates a variety of downstream
effector molecules, including those of the Ras/MAP kinase
pathway (path 1 in Figure 4-18). Full activation of MAP
kinase is further facilitated by tyrosine phosphorylation
mediated by G␣-GTP-activated tyrosine kinases (not
shown). Activation of the Ras pathway culminates in the
initiation of transcription as well as in up-regulation of integrin adhesion molecules on the cell membrane. G␤␥ signaling also cooperates with signaling mediated by G␣-GTP to
activate one isoform of phospholipase C, PLC␤, resulting in
an increase in the activity of the transcription factor NF-␬B
(path 2).
The G␣GTP complex also activates a signaling pathway
that is initiated by the small G protein, Rho (path 3). This
pathway leads to actin polymerization and the promotion of
cell migration, so it is this third pathway that is responsible
for the most commonly described aspect of chemokine signaling: cell movement (see also Box 4-3). Rho signaling is
also instrumental in bringing about changes in the transcriptional program of the cell. Finally, a JAK associated with

the GPCR initiates signaling through PKC-mediated pathways that culminate in the activation of Akt and increased
cell survival (path 4) as well as in further transcriptional
alterations.
The quality of the response elicited by particular chemokines in different types of cells is dependent on the nature of
the chemokine ligand, as well as on the signaling microenvironment, which in turn is determined by the range of G
protein subtypes and regulatory molecules present in that
cell. But from the complexity of signaling options available
to the receptor, it is not difficult to see how binding of a chemokine molecule to its receptor can simultaneously bring
about alterations in the location, the adhesion molecule
binding capacity, and the transcriptional program of the
chemokine-activated cell.

Gene expression

FIGURE 4-18 G-protein–coupled receptors interact with
G proteins that transduce chemokine signals into the interior of the cell. Different chemokines can induce different signaling pathways. This figure therefore represents a composite of some
of the most common pathways elicited by chemokine binding,
which lead collectively to alterations in the transcriptional program,
the enabling of cell movement, and changes in the adhesive properties of the signaled cell. (1) The G␤␥ subunit binds to the adapter
molecule Grb2, activating it and initiating the Ras signaling pathway
that leads eventually to activation of MAP kinase and an alteration in
the cell’s transcriptional program, as shown in Figure 3-16. Ras pathway activation also leads eventually to activation of integrin adhesion molecules on the cell surface. G␣ GTP simultaneously binds and
activates a protein tyrosine kinase that phosphorylates and further
activates MAP kinase (not shown). (2) Both G␣GTP and G␤␥ cooperate to activate PLC␤, which activates the NF-␬B pathway. (3) G␣GTP
activates the small cytoplasmic G protein, Rho, initiating actin
polymerization and cell movement. Other pathways emanate from
Rho that lead to the activation of the transcription factor Serum
Response Factor (SRF). (4) A JAK is stimulated by chemokine binding
to the receptor, and it turns on the activity of PKC, leading eventually
to the activation of the enzyme Akt. Akt affects cell survival by phosphorylating the proapoptotic genes Bax and Bad (not shown) and
marking them for destruction and enhancing cell survival. It also
phosphorylates and further activates the transcription factor NF-␬B.
JAK-mediated PKC activation can also lead to phosphorylation of
the transcription factor Jun, and its dimerization with Fos to create
the complete transcription factor AP-1.

A number of proteins that inhibit the biological activity of
cytokines have been reported. These proteins act in one of
two ways: either they bind directly to a cytokine receptor but
fail to activate the cell, thus blocking the active cytokine
from binding, or they bind directly to the cytokine itself,
inhibiting its ability to bind to the cognate receptor. In this
section, we describe some naturally occurring cytokine
antagonists that modulate and refine the power of particular
cytokine responses, as well as the ways in which various
pathogens have hijacked cytokine responses to their own
ends.

The IL-1 Receptor Antagonist Blocks the IL-1
Cytokine Receptor
The best-characterized cytokine inhibitor is the IL-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1Ra), which binds to the IL-1 receptor but
does not elicit activation of the signaling pathway (see
above). As previously described, ligation of IL-1Ra to the
IL-1 receptor blocks the binding of both IL-1␣ and IL-1␤,
thus accounting for its inhibitory properties. IL-1Ra is synthesized by the same cells that secrete IL-1␣ and IL-1␤, and
its synthesis in the liver is up-regulated under inflammatory
conditions, along with that of IL-1. Several animal and
human models exist in which the levels of IL-1Ra are naturally reduced, and humans carrying an allele that decreases
the expression of IL-1Ra suffer from arthritis and a variety of
other autoimmune diseases. This observation suggests that
the normal function of IL-1Ra is to provide for the host a
means by which to modulate the numbers of receptors that
are capable of mounting a physiological response to IL-1.
Given the fiercely proinflammatory effects of IL-1, it makes
sense that responses to this powerful cytokine should be
carefully controlled. Indeed, we note quite often in biological
systems that a process—if it has the potential to lead to deleterious consequences to the organism—is subject to several
different means of regulation.

Introduction

Recombinant IL-Ra has been used clinically, under the
name of anakrina, for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis.
Investigations into how cells control the balance of IL-1 and
IL-1Ra secretion are still ongoing, but preliminary studies
suggest that the activation of different isoforms of PI3 kinase
may play an important role in determining the relative
amounts of IL-1 and IL-1Ra that are secreted by a stimulated
monocyte.

Cytokine Antagonists Can Be Derived
from Cleavage of the Cytokine Receptor
Some naturally occurring soluble antagonists arise from
enzymatic cleavage of the extracellular domains of cytokine
receptors. These soluble receptor components can compete
with the membrane-bound receptor for cytokine binding
and thus down-modulate the potential cytokine response.
The best characterized of the soluble cytokine receptors
consists of a segment containing the amino-terminal 192
amino acids of the IL-2R␣ (CD25) subunit, which is
released by proteolytic cleavage, forming a 45-kDa soluble
IL-2 receptor (sIL-2R or sCD25). The shed receptor retains
its ability to bind IL-2 and can therefore prevent the cytokine’s productive interaction with the membrane-bound
IL-2 receptor.
The origin of sIL-2R is still a matter for debate. Recently,
regulatory T cells, which express high levels of CD25 on
their membrane surfaces, have been shown to release sIL-2R
upon activation. Since these T cells serve the function of
down-regulating ongoing immune responses, it has been
suggested that the soluble IL-2 receptors may serve the
physiological function of soaking up excess IL-2 and thus
reducing the amount of the cytokine that is available to irrelevant or even to competing effector T cells. The soluble IL-2
receptor is also found in the serum and bodily fluids of
patients suffering from a number of hematologic malignancies (blood cell cancers), and high levels of sIL-2R in the
blood correlate with a poor disease prognosis. However, the
issue of whether the sIL-2R is released from the tumor cells
per se, or whether it is released from regulatory T cells that
may be acting to dampen the host anti-tumor response, has
yet to be resolved.

Some Viruses Have Developed Strategies
to Exploit Cytokine Activity
The cytokine antagonists described above derive from an
organism’s own immune system. However, as is so often the
case in immunology, some pathogens have evolved ways in
which to circumvent cytokine responses, by mimicking molecules and pathways used by the host. The evolution of anticytokine strategies by microbial pathogens provides
biological evidence of the importance of cytokines in organizing and promoting effective antimicrobial immune

responses. The following are among the various anti-cytokine
strategies used by viruses:
• The generation of viral products that interfere with
cytokine secretion
• The generation of cytokine homologs that compete with
natural cytokines or inhibit anti-viral responses
• The production of soluble cytokine-binding proteins
• The expression of homologs of cytokine receptors
• The generation of viral products that interfere with
intracellular signaling
• The induction of cytokine inhibitors in the host cell
Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), for example, produces an
IL-10–like molecule (viral IL-10 or vIL-10) that binds to the
IL-10 receptor. Just like host-derived IL-10, this viral homologue suppresses TH1-type cell-mediated responses that
would otherwise be effective in fighting a viral infection.
Other cytokine mimics produced by viruses allow them to
manipulate the immune response in alternative ways that aid
the survival of the pathogen. For example, EBV produces an
inducer of IL-1Ra, the host antagonist of IL-1. Poxviruses
have also been shown to encode a soluble TNF-binding protein and a soluble IL-1-binding protein that block the ability
of the bound cytokines to elicit a response. Since both
TNF-␣ and IL-1 are critical to the early phases of an inflammatory, antiviral response, these soluble cytokine-binding
proteins may allow the viruses an increased time window in
which to replicate.
Yet other viruses produce molecules that inhibit the production of cytokines. One such example is the cytokine
response modifier (Crm) protein of the cowpox virus, which
inhibits the production of caspase-1 and hence prevents the
processing of IL-1 precursor proteins. Finally, some viruses
produce soluble chemokines and chemokine-binding proteins that interfere with normal immune cell trafficking, and
allow the producing viruses and virally infected cells to
evade an immune response. Table 4-6 lists a number of viral
products that inhibit cytokines, chemokines, and their
activities.

Cytokine-Related Diseases
Defects in the complex regulatory networks governing the
expression of cytokines and cytokine receptors have been
implicated in a number of diseases. Genetic defects in cytokines, their receptors, or the molecules involved in cytokinedirected signal transduction lead to immunodeficiencies
such as those described in Chapter 18. Other defects in the
cytokine network can cause an inability to defend against
specific families of pathogens. For example, people with a
defective receptor for IFN-␥ are susceptible to mycobacterial

infections that rarely occur in the general population. In
addition to the diseases rooted in genetic defects in cytokine
activity, a number of other pathologic states result from
overexpression or underexpression of cytokines or cytokine
receptors. Several examples of these diseases are given below,
followed by an account of therapies aimed at preventing the
potential harm caused by cytokine activity.

Septic Shock Is Relatively Common
and Potentially Lethal
Despite the widespread use of antibiotics, bacterial infections remain a major cause of septic shock, which may
develop a few hours after infection by certain bacteria,
including Staphyloccocus aureus, E. coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterobacter aerogenes,
and Neisseria meningitidis.
Bacterial septic shock is one of the conditions that falls
under the general heading of sepsis. Sepsis, in turn, may be
caused not only by bacterial infection but also by trauma,
injury, ischemia (decrease in blood supply to an organ or a
tissue), and certain cancers. Sepsis is the most common
cause of death in U.S. hospital intensive-care units and the
13th leading cause of death in the United States. A common
feature of sepsis, whatever the underlying cause, is an overwhelming production of proinflammatory and fever-inducing
cytokines such as TNF-␣ and IL-1␤. The cytokine imbalance
induces abnormal body temperature, alterations in the respiratory rate, and high white blood cell counts, followed by
capillary leakage, tissue injury, widespread blood clotting,
and lethal organ failure.
Bacterial septic shock often develops because bacterial cell
wall endotoxins bind to innate immune system pathogen
receptors, such as Toll-like receptors (see Chapter 5), on dendritic cells and macrophages, causing them to produce IL-1
and TNF-␣ at levels that lead to pathological capillary perme-

ability and loss of blood pressure. A condition resembling
bacterial septic shock can be produced in the absence of any
bacterial infection simply by injecting mice with recombinant TNF-␣. Several studies offer hope that neutralizing
TNF-␣ or IL-1 activity with monoclonal antibodies or antagonists will prevent fatal shock from developing. In one such
investigation, monoclonal antibodies to TNF-␣ protected
animals from endotoxin-induced shock. In another, injection
of a recombinant IL-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1Ra), which
prevents binding of IL-1 to the IL-1 receptor as described
above, resulted in a threefold reduction in mortality.
However, neutralization of TNF-␣ does not reverse the
progression of septic shock in all cases, and antibodies
against TNF-␣ give little benefit to patients with advanced
disease. Recent studies in which the cytokine profiles of
patients with septic shock were followed over time shed
some light on this apparent paradox.
The increases in TNF-␣ and IL-1␤ occur rapidly in early
sepsis, so neutralizing these cytokines is most beneficial
early in the process. Indeed, in animal experiments, early
intervention can prevent sepsis altogether. However, approximately 24 hours following the onset of sepsis, the levels of
TNF-␣ and IL-1␤ fall dramatically, and other factors become
more important. Cytokines critical in the later stages of sepsis include IL-6, MIF, and CCL-8. Sepsis remains an area of
intense investigation, and clarification of the process involved
in bacterial septic shock and other forms of sepsis can be
expected to lead to advances in therapies for this major killer
in the near future.

Bacterial Toxic Shock Is Caused by
Superantigen Induction of T-Cell
Cytokine Secretion
A variety of microorganisms produce toxins that act as superantigens. As described in Chapters 9 and 11, superantigens

Introduction

BOX 4-4

CLINICAL FOCUS

Cytokines and Obesity
Even as those in the Third World
suffer from malnutrition, among the leading current causes of disease and death in
developed countries are obesity and its
corollary, Type 2 diabetes.
Type 1, or juvenile onset, diabetes has
long been known to have an autoimmune
etiology (cause). Cells of the adaptive
immune system kill the ␤ cells of the Islets
of Langerhans in the pancreas, leading to
the complete absence of insulin in the
diabetic patient, who must rely on exogenously delivered hormone to survive.
In Type 2 diabetes, the body fails to
respond to insulin in an appropriate manner, and the cells fail to take in glucose
from the blood and into the tissues. Just as
in Type 1 diabetes, the presence of high
levels of glucose in the blood and tissue
fluids facilitates nonenzymatic glucose
conversions to reactive carbohydrate
derivatives such as glyoxals. These derivatives cross-link proteins and carbohydrates
in the membranes and walls of blood vessels and neurons and within the extracellular matrix, leading to the familiar array of
diabetic symptoms: poor peripheral circulation, plaque buildup in the arteries, and
heart disease. However, we are now beginning to understand that Type 2, just like
Type 1, diabetes is a disease closely related
to the workings of the immune system.
In 1993, a seminal publication by
Hotamisligil and colleagues made the

link between inflammation and metabolic conditions such as Type 2 diabetes
and obesity. These authors demonstrated
that adipocytes (fat cells) constitutively
express the proinflammatory cytokine
TNF-␣, and that TNF-␣ expression in adipocytes of obese animals is markedly
increased. Later research demonstrated
that this finding could be extended to
humans. The adipose tissue of human
subjects was found to constitutively
express TNF-␣, and blood levels of TNF-␣
fall after weight loss.
But is this increase in TNF-␣ expression
affecting insulin sensitivity? On binding of
insulin to its receptor, tyrosine kinase
activity in the cytoplasmic region of the
receptor is activated. This Receptor Tyrosine Kinase (RTK) then phosphorylates
both itself (autophosphorylation) and
some nearby proteins. The signaling cascade is initiated from the insulin receptor
by the binding of adapter proteins such as
Grb2 and IRS-1 via their SH2 domains to
the phosphorylated tyrosine sites on the
receptor molecule. We now know that
TNF-␣ signaling in adipocytes inhibits the
autophosphorylation of tyrosine residues
of the insulin receptor and instead induces
phosphorylation of serine residues of
both the insulin receptor and the IRS-1
adapter. The serine phosphorylation
inhibits any subsequent phosphorylation
at tyrosine residues, and thus the passage

bind to MHC Class II molecules at a location in the MHC
molecule that is outside the groove normally occupied by
antigenic peptides (see Figure 11-6). They then bind to a part
of the V␤ chain of the T-cell receptor that is outside the normal antigen-binding site, and this binding is sufficient to
trigger T-cell activation. This means that a given superantigen can simultaneously activate all T cells bearing a particular V␤ domain. Because of their unique binding ability,
superantigens can activate large numbers of T cells irrespective of the antigenic specificity of their canonical antigenbinding site.

of signals from insulin to the interior of the
fat cell is prevented. Recently, the interleukin IL-6 has also been shown to inhibit
insulin signal transduction in hepatocytes
(liver cells) through a similar mechanism.
The decrease in effectiveness of insulin
signaling then becomes a self-reinforcing
problem, as insulin signaling itself is antiinflammatory, and so any decrease in the
insulin signal can give rise to inflammatory side effects.
However, TNF-␣ and IL-6 are not the
only cytokines implicated in the etiology
of Type 2 diabetes. With the discovery
and characterization of the proinflammatory cytokine family represented by IL-17,
interest has arisen in the relationship
between members of this family, obesity,
and the control of fat cell metabolism.
Since IL-6 is implicated in the differentiation of T lymphocytes to secrete IL-17,
obesity and its associated inflammation
tend to predispose an individual to
secrete IL-17. However, again we find ourselves in a positive feedback loop, as IL-17
acts on monocytes to induce the further
secretion of IL-6, thus ensuring the maintenance of an inflammatory state.
It is therefore clear that cytokine signaling plays a profound role in a disease
that is emblematic of our time, and which
is predicted to afflict close to 40% of the
U.S. population by the middle of the next
decade.

Although less than 0.01% of T cells respond to a given
conventional antigen (see Chapter 11), 5% or more of the
T-cell population can respond to a given superantigen.
Bacterial superantigens have been implicated as the causative agent of several diseases, such as bacterial toxic
shock and food poisoning. Included among these bacterial
superantigens are several enterotoxins, exfoliating toxins,
and toxic shock syndrome toxin (TSST1) from Staphylococcus aureus; pyrogenic exotoxins from Streptococcus
pyrogenes; and Mycoplasma arthritidis supernatant (MAS).
The large number of T cells activated by these superantigens

c04ReceptorsandSignalingCytokinesandChemokines.indd Page 137 12/19/12 11:47 PM user-t044

Receptors and Signaling: Cytokines and Chemokines
results in excessive production of cytokines. The TSST1,
for example, has been shown to induce extremely high
levels of TNF-␣ and IL-1␤. As in bacterial septic shock,
these elevated concentrations of cytokines can induce systemic reactions that include fever, widespread blood clotting, and shock.
In addition to those diseases described above, in which
cytokines or their receptors are directly implicated, recent
information has indicated the importance of cytokine
involvement in the most important public health crisis currently afflicting the developed world: the increasing incidence of Type 2 diabetes. The roles of TNF-␣ and IL-6 in the
induction and maintenance of this disease are described in
Box 4-4.

Cytokine Activity Is Implicated in Lymphoid
and Myeloid Cancers
Abnormalities in the production of cytokines or their
receptors have been associated with some types of cancer.
For example, abnormally high levels of IL-6 are secreted
by cardiac myxoma (a benign heart tumor), myeloma and
plasmacytoma cells, as well as cervical and bladder cancer
cells. In myeloma and plasmacytoma cells, IL-6 appears to
operate in an autocrine manner to stimulate cell proliferation. When monoclonal antibodies to IL-6 are added to in
vitro cultures of myeloma cells, their growth is inhibited.
In contrast, transgenic mice that express high levels of
IL-6 have been found to exhibit a massive, fatal, plasmacell proliferation, called plasmacytosis. In addition, as
described above, high serum concentrations of the sIL-2R
are found in patients suffering from various blood cell
cancers, which may impede a vigorous anti-tumor
response.

Cytokine Storms May Have Caused Many
Deaths in the 1918 Spanish Influenza
Occasionally, a particularly virulent infection may induce
the secretion of extremely high levels of cytokines, that
then feed back on the immune cells to elicit yet more cytokines. Normally, these positive feedback loops represent
effective modes of immune amplification; they are themselves usually kept in check by self-regulating immune
mechanisms, such as the activation of regulatory T cells
(see Chapter 11). However, some viruses cause a localized,
exaggerated response, resulting in the secretion of extraordinarily high levels of cytokines. If this occurs in the lungs,
for example, the localized swelling, inflammation, and
increase in capillary permeability can lead to the accumulation of fluids and leukocytes that block the airways,
thereby causing exacerbation of symptoms, or even death,
before the cytokine levels can be controlled. It is unclear
why some viruses induce these cytokine storms and others
do not.

CHAPTER 4

Historical documents detailing the symptoms of the 1918
Spanish influenza suggest that the massive fatalities associated with that pandemic most likely resulted from cytokine
storms, and there is some evidence that the severe acute
respiratory syndrome (SARS) epidemic of 1993 may have
caused a similar, unregulated, immune cell cytokine secretion. Transplant surgeons also observe this phenomenon on
occasions when leukocytes associated with a graft—often a
bone marrow transplant—mount an immune response
against the host. Effective treatments for patients undergoing
cytokine storms are still being developed. Currently, patients
are offered steroidal and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory
medications, but other drugs that are more specifically
directed at the reduction of cytokine secretion and/or activity are being tested.

Cytokine-Based Therapies
The availability of purified cloned cytokines, monoclonal
antibodies directed against cytokines, and soluble cytokine
receptors offers the prospect of specific clinical therapies to
modulate the immune response. Cytokines such as interferons (see Clinical Focus Box 4-2), colony-stimulating factors
such as G-CSF, and IL-2 have all been used clinically. In
addition, several reagents that specifically block the proinflammatory effects of TNF-␣ have proven to be therapeutically useful in certain diseases. Specifically, soluble TNF-␣
receptor (Enbrel) and monoclonal antibodies against TNF-␣
(Remicade and Humira) have been used to treat rheumatoid
arthritis and ankylosing spondylitis in more than a million
patients. These anti–TNF-␣ drugs reduce proinflammatory
cytokine cascades; help to alleviate pain, stiffness, and joint
swelling; and promote healing and tissue repair. In addition,
as described above, the recombinant form of IL-1Ra—
anakinra (Kineret)—has been shown to be relatively effective in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis. Monoclonal
antibodies directed against the ␣ chain of the IL-2R—
basiliximab (Simulect) and daclizumab (Zenapax)—are also
in clinical use for the prevention of transplantation rejection
reactions.
As powerful as these reagents may be, interfering with
the normal course of the immune response is not without
its own intrinsic hazards. Reduced cytokine activity brings
with it an increased risk of infection and malignancy, and
the frequency of lymphoma is higher in patients who are
long-term users of the first generation of TNF-␣ blocking
drugs.
In addition, the technical problems encountered in
adapting cytokines for safe, routine medical use are far
from trivial. As described above, during an immune
response, interacting cells may produce extremely high
local concentrations of cytokines in the vicinity of target
cells, but achieving such high concentrations over a clinically significant time period, when cytokines must be

Introduction

administered systemically, is difficult. Furthermore, many
cytokines have a very short half-life—recombinant human
IL-2 has a half-life of only 7 to 10 minutes when administered intravenously—so frequent administration may be
required. Finally, cytokines are extremely potent biological
response modifiers, and they can cause unpredictable and
undesirable side effects. The side effects from administration of recombinant IL-2, for example, range from mild
(e.g., fever, chills, diarrhea, and weight gain) to serious

(e.g., anemia, thrombocytopenia, shock, respiratory distress, and coma).
The use of cytokines and anti-cytokine therapies in
clinical medicine holds great promise, and efforts to
develop safe and effective cytokine-related strategies continue, particularly in those areas of medicine that have so
far been resistant to more conventional approaches, such as
inflammation, cancer, organ transplantation, and chronic
allergic disease.

■

Cytokines are proteins that mediate the effector functions
of the immune system.

■

Most cytokines are soluble proteins, but some—for example, members of the TNF family, may be expressed in a
membrane-bound form.
Some cytokines are secreted following stimulation of the
innate immune system (e.g., IL-1, TNF-␣, CXCL8), whereas
others are secreted by the T and B lymphocytes of the
adaptive immune system (IL-2, IL-4, IL-17).
Cytokines bind to receptors on the plasma membrane and
elicit their effects through the activation of an intracellular
signaling cascade.
Cytokines can effect alterations in the differentiative, proliferative, and survival capacities of their target cells.
Cytokines exhibit the properties of redundancy, pleiotropy, synergy, antagonism, and cascade induction.
The levels of expression of cytokine receptors on the cell surface may change according to the activation status of a cell.
There are six families of cytokines with associated receptors, distinguished on the basis of the structures of the
cytokines and the receptor molecules, and on the nature of
their signaling pathways.
IL-1 family members interact with dimeric receptors to
induce responses that are primarily proinflammatory. The
physiological responses to some IL-1 family members are
modulated by the presence of soluble forms of the receptors and soluble cytokine-binding proteins.
The Hematopoietin (Class I cytokine) family is the largest
family of cytokines, and members mediate diverse effects,
including proliferation, differentiation, and antibody
secretion. The Hematopoietin family members share a
common, four-helix bundle structure.

■

■

■

■

■

■

■

■

■

Receptors for cytokines from the Hematopoietin family
are classified into three subgroups—the ␥, ␤, or gp130
receptors—each of which shares a common signaling
chain.

■

The Interferon (Class II cytokine) family includes the Type
I interferons (interferon ␣ and interferon ␤), which were
the first cytokines to be discovered and mediate early antiviral responses.
Type II interferons (interferon ␥) activate macrophages,
interact with cells of the adaptive immune system and support the generation of TH1 cells.
The TNF family of cytokines act as trimers and may occur
in either soluble or membrane-bound forms.
FasL, a TNF family member, interacts with its receptor,
Fas, to stimulate apoptosis in the recipient cell. This interaction is important at the close of the immune response.
TNF interacts with the TNF-R1 receptor on the surface of
the cell to induce either apoptosis or survival, depending
on the physiological environment.
The IL-17 family of cytokines has been defined quite
recently, and its members are primarily proinflammatory
in action.
Chemokines act on GPCR-coupled receptors to promote
chemoattraction, the movement of immune system cells
into, within, and out of lymphoid organs.
Naturally occurring and pathogen-derived inhibitors of
cytokine function may modulate their activity in vivo.
Levels of inflammatory cytokines such as IL-1, IL-6, and
TNF may be increased in certain disease states such as
rheumatoid arthritis, and such diseases are susceptible to
treatment with drugs that inhibit cytokine activities.

Innate Immunity

ertebrates are protected by both innate
immunity and adaptive immunity. In contrast
to adaptive immune responses, which take
days to arise following exposure to antigens,
innate immunity consists of the defenses against
infection that are ready for immediate action when a
host is attacked by a pathogen (viruses, bacteria, fungi,
or parasites). The innate immune system includes
anatomical barriers against infection—both physical
and chemical—as well as cellular responses (Overview
Figure 5-1). The main physical barriers—the body’s
first line of defense—are the epithelial layers of the skin
and of the mucosal and glandular tissue surfaces
connected to the body’s openings; these epithelial
barriers prevent infection by blocking pathogens from
entering the body. Chemical barriers at these surfaces
include specialized soluble substances that possess
antimicrobial activity as well as acid pH. Pathogens that
breach the physical and chemical barriers due to
damage to or direct infection of the epithelial cell layer
can survive in the extracellular spaces (some bacteria,
fungi, and parasites) or they can infect cells (viruses
and some bacteria and parasites), eventually replicating
and possibly spreading to other parts of the body.
The cellular innate immune responses to invasion by
an infectious agent that overcomes the initial epithelial
barriers are rapid, typically beginning within minutes of
invasion. These responses are triggered by cell surface or
intracellular receptors that recognize conserved molecular
components of pathogens. Some white blood cell types
(macrophages and neutrophils) are activated to rapidly
engulf and destroy extracellular microbes through the
process of phagocytosis. Other receptors induce the
production of proteins and other substances that have a
variety of beneficial effects, including direct antimicrobial
activity and the recruitment of fluid, cells, and molecules
to sites of infection. This influx causes swelling and other
physiological changes that collectively are called
inflammation. Such local innate and inflammatory
responses usually are beneficial for eliminating pathogens
and damaged or dead cells and promoting healing. For
example, increased levels of antimicrobial substances and

phagocytic cells help to eliminate the pathogens, and
dendritic cells take up pathogens for presentation to
lymphocytes, activating adaptive immune responses.
Natural killer cells recruited to the site can recognize and kill
virus-infected, altered, or stressed cells. However, in some
situations these innate and inflammatory responses can be
harmful, leading to local or systemic consequences that can
cause tissue damage and occasionally death. To prevent
these potentially harmful responses, regulatory mechanisms
have evolved that usually limit such adverse effects.
Despite the multiple layers of the innate immune
system, some pathogens may evade the innate defenses.
On call in vertebrates is the adaptive immune system,
which counters infection with a specific tailor-made

Key elements of innate immunity include the physical and chemical barriers that prevent infection, provided by the epithelial cell
layers of the skin, mucosal tissues (e.g., gastrointestinal, respiratory,
and urogenital tracts), and glandular tissues (e.g., salivary, lacrimal,
and mammary glands). Once pathogens enter the body, such as
through a breach in an epithelial layer, they are confronted by an
array of cells with cell surface and intracellular receptors that recognize pathogen components and trigger a variety of cellular
responses. Pathogen recognition by these receptors activates some
cells to phagocytose and degrade the pathogen, and many cells

response to the attacking pathogen. This attack occurs in
the form of B and T lymphocytes, which generate
antibodies, and effector T cells that specifically recognize
and neutralize or eliminate the invaders. Table 5-1

are activated through their receptors to produce a variety of antimicrobial substances that kill pathogens, as well as cytokine and
chemokine proteins that recruit cells, molecules, and fluid to the
site of infection, leading to swelling and other symptoms collectively known as inflammation. The innate natural killer (NK) cells
recognize and kill some virus-infected cells. Cytokines and chemokines can cause systemic effects that help to eliminate an infection,
and also contribute—along with dendritic cells that carry and present pathogens to lymphocytes—to the activation of adaptive
immune responses.

all multicellular plants and animals, adaptive immunity is
a much more recent evolutionary invention, having arisen
in vertebrates. In these animals, adaptive immunity

mechanisms that share important features with those of
our invertebrate ancestors. A large and growing body of
research has revealed that as innate and adaptive
immunity have co-evolved in vertebrates, a high degree of
interaction and interdependence has arisen between the
two systems. Recognition by the innate immune system
not only kicks off the adaptive immune response but also
helps to ensure that the type of adaptive response
generated will be effective for the invading pathogen.
This chapter describes the components of the innate
immune system—physical barriers, chemical agents, and
a battery of protective cellular responses carried out by
numerous cell types—and illustrates how they act
together to defend against infection. We conclude with an
overview of innate immunity in plants and invertebrates.

Anatomical Barriers to Infection
The most obvious components of innate immunity are the
external barriers to microbial invasion: the epithelial layers
that insulate the body’s interior from the pathogens of the
exterior world. These epithelial barriers include the skin and
the tissue surfaces connected to the body’s openings: the
mucous epithelial layers that line the respiratory, gastrointestinal, and urogenital tracts and the ducts of secretory glands
such as the salivary, lacrimal, and mammary glands (which
produce saliva, tears, and milk, respectively) (Figure 5-2).
Skin and other epithelia provide a kind of living “plastic
wrap” that encases and protects the inner domains of the

body from infection. But these anatomical barriers are more
than just passive wrappers. They contribute to physical and
mechanical processes that help the body shed pathogens and
also generate active chemical and biochemical defenses by
synthesizing and deploying molecules, including peptides
and proteins, that have or induce antimicrobial activity.

Epithelial Barriers Prevent Pathogen Entry
into the Body’s Interior
The skin, the outermost physical barrier, consists of two distinct layers: a thin outer layer, the epidermis, and a thicker
layer, the dermis. The epidermis contains several tiers of tightly
packed epithelial cells; its outer layer consists of mostly dead
cells filled with a waterproofing protein called keratin. The
dermis is composed of connective tissue and contains blood
vessels, hair follicles, sebaceous glands, sweat glands, and scattered myeloid leukocytes such as dendritic cells, macrophages,
and mast cells. In place of skin, the respiratory, gastrointestinal,
and urogenital tracts and the ducts of the salivary, lacrimal, and
mammary glands are lined by strong barrier layers of epithelial
cells stitched together by tight junctions that prevent pathogens
from squeezing between them to enter the body.
A number of nonspecific physical and chemical defense
mechanisms also contribute to preventing the entry of pathogens through the epithelia in these secretory tissues. For
example, the secretions of these tissues (mucus, urine, saliva,
tears, and milk) wash away potential invaders and also contain antibacterial and antiviral substances. Mucus, the viscous fluid secreted by specialized cells of the mucosal
epithelial layers, entraps foreign microorganisms. In the

In addition to serving as physical barriers, the skin and mucosal and

membrane, cover the epithelial cells. The synchronous movement of cilia propels mucus-entrapped microorganisms from
these tracts. Coughing is a mechanical response that helps us
get rid of excess mucus, with trapped microorganisms, that
occurs in many respiratory infections. The flow of urine
sweeps many bacteria from the urinary tract. With every
meal, we ingest huge numbers of microorganisms, but they

must run a gauntlet of defenses in the gastrointestinal tract
that begins with the antimicrobial compounds in saliva and
in the epithelia of the mouth and includes the hostile mix of
digestive enzymes and acid found in the stomach. Similarly,
the acidic pH of vaginal secretions is important in providing
protection against bacterial and fungal pathogens.
Some organisms have evolved ways to evade these
defenses of the epithelial barriers. For example, influenza

virus has a surface molecule that enables it to attach
firmly to cells in mucous membranes of the respiratory
tract, preventing the virus from being swept out by the
ciliated epithelial cells. Neisseria gonorrhoeae, the bacteria
that causes gonorrhea, binds to epithelial cells in the
mucous membrane of the urogenital tract. Adherence of
these and other bacteria to mucous membranes is generally mediated by hairlike protrusions on the bacteria
called fimbriae or pili that have evolved the ability to bind
to certain glycoproteins or glycolipids only expressed by
epithelial cells of the mucous membrane of particular tissues (Figure 5-3).

(which also incudes calprotectin) with potent antibacterial
activity against Escherichia coli, an enteric (intestinal) bacterial
species. This finding answered a long-standing question: Why
is human skin resistant to colonization by E. coli despite exposure to it from fecal matter resulting from lack of cleanliness or
poor sanitation? As shown in Figure 5-4, incubation of E. coli
on human skin for as little as 30 minutes kills the bacteria.
Antimicrobial proteins can show some specificity toward particular pathogens. For example, psoriasin is a key antimicrobial
for E. coli on the skin (and also on the tongue), but, as shown
in Figure 5-4, it does not kill Staphylococcus aureus (a major
cause of food poisoning and skin infections), whereas the
related protein calprotectin kills S. aureus but not E. coli.

Antimicrobial Proteins and Peptides Kill
Would-be Invaders
To provide strong defense at these barrier layers, epithelial
cells secrete a broad spectrum of proteins and peptides that
provide protection against pathogens. The capacity of skin
and other epithelia to produce a wide variety of antimicrobial
agents on an ongoing basis is important for controlling the
microbial populations on these surfaces, as breaks in these
physical barriers from wounds provide routes of infection
that would be readily exploited by pathogenic microbes if
not defended by biochemical means.
Among the antimicrobial proteins produced by the skin
and other epithelia in humans (Table 5-2), several are enzymes
and binding proteins that kill or inhibit growth of bacterial and
fungal cells. Lysozyme is an enzyme found in saliva, tears, and
fluids of the respiratory tract that cleaves the peptidoglycan
components of bacterial cell walls. Lactoferrin and calprotectin
are two proteins that bind and sequester metal ions needed by
bacteria and fungi, limiting their growth. Among the many
antibacterial agents produced by human skin, recent research
has identified psoriasin, a small protein of the S-100 family

*Examples listed in this table are all produced by cells in the epithelia of mucosal and glandular tissues; examples of prominent epithelial sites are listed. Most proteins
and peptides are produced constitutively at these sites, but their production can also be increased by microbial or inflammatory stimuli. Many are also produced constitutively in neutrophils and stored in granules. In addition, synthesis and secretion of many of these molecules may be induced by microbial components during
innate immune responses by various myeloid leukocyte populations (monocytes, macrophages, dendritic cells, and mast cells).
**While some mammals have multiple cathelicidins, humans have only one.

Another major class of antimicrobial components
secreted by skin and other epithelial layers is comprised of
antimicrobial peptides, generally less than 100 amino acids
long, which are an ancient form of innate immunity present
in vertebrates, invertebrates, plants, and even some fungi.
The discovery that vertebrate skin produces antimicrobial
proteins came from studies in frogs, where glands in the skin
were shown to secrete peptides called magainins that have
potent antimicrobial activity against bacteria, yeast, and protozoans. Antimicrobial peptides generally are cysteine-rich,
cationic, and amphipathic (containing both hydrophilic and
hydrophobic regions). Because of their positive charge and
amphipathic nature, they interact with acidic phospholipids
in lipid bilayers, disrupting membranes of bacteria, fungi,
parasites, and viruses. They then can enter the microbes,
where they have other toxic effects, such as inhibiting the
synthesis of DNA, RNA, or proteins, and activating antimicrobial enzymes, resulting in cell death.
The main types of antimicrobial peptides found in humans
are - and -defensins and cathelicidin. Human defensins
kill a wide variety of bacteria, including E. coli, S. aureus,
Streptococcus pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and
Hemophilus influenzae. Antimicrobial peptides also attack
the lipoprotein envelope of enveloped viruses such as influ-

enza virus and some herpesviruses. Defensins and cathelicidin LL-37 (the only cathelicidin expressed in humans) are
secreted constitutively by epithelial cells in many tissues, as
well as stored in neutrophil granules where they contribute to
killing phagocytosed microbes. Recent studies have shown
that human -defensin antimicrobial peptides secreted into
the gut by intestinal epithelial Paneth cells, located in the
deep valleys (crypts) between the villi, are important for
maintaining beneficial bacterial flora that are necessary for
normal intestinal immune system functions. As we will see
later, production of these antimicrobial peptides also can be
induced in many epithelial and other cell types by the binding
of microbial components to cellular receptors.
The epithelium of the respiratory tract secretes a variety of
lubricating lipids and proteins called surfactants. Two surfactant proteins, SP-A and SP-D, which are present in the lungs
as well as in the secretions of some other mucosal epithelia,
are members of a class of microbe-binding proteins called collectins. SP-A and SP-D bind differentially to sets of carbohydrate, lipid, and protein components of microbial surfaces and
help to prevent infection by blocking and modifying surface
components and promoting pathogen clearance. For example,
they differentially bind two alternating states of the lung
pathogen Klebsiella pneumonia that differ in whether or not

c05InnateImmunity.indd Page 147 12/19/12 11:54 PM user-t044

they are coated with a thick polysaccharide capsule: SP-A
binds the complex polysaccharides coating many of the capsulated forms, while SP-D only binds the exposed cell wall lipopolysaccharide of the nonencapsulated form.

Phagocytosis
Despite the strong defenses of our protective epithelial layers,
some pathogens have evolved strategies to penetrate these
defenses, and epithelia may be disrupted by wounds, abrasions, and insect bites that may transmit pathogens. Once
pathogens penetrate through the epithelial barrier layers into
the tissue spaces of the body, an array of cellular membrane
receptors and soluble proteins that recognize microbial components play the essential roles of detecting the pathogen and
triggering effective defenses against it. Phagocytic cells make
up the next line of defense against pathogens that have penetrated the epithelial cell barriers. Macrophages, neutrophils,
and dendritic cells in tissues and monocytes in the blood are
the main cell types that carry out phagocytosis—the cellular
uptake (eating) of particulate materials such as bacteria—a
key mechanism for eliminating pathogens. This major role of
the cells attracted to the site of invading organisms is evolutionarily ancient, present in invertebrates as well as vertebrates. Elie Metchnikoff initially described the process of
phagocytosis in the 1880s using cells from starfish (echinoderm invertebrates) similar to vertebrate white blood cells
and ascribed to phagocytosis a major role in immunity. He
was correct in this conclusion; we now know that defects in
phagocytosis lead to severe immunodeficiency.
As described in Chapter 2, most tissues contain resident
populations of macrophages that function as sentinels for

the innate immune system. Through various cell surface
receptors they recognize microbes such as bacteria, extend
their plasma membrane to engulf them, and internalize
them in phagosomes (endosomes resulting from phagocytosis, Figure 5-5). Lysosomes then fuse with the phagosomes, delivering agents that kill and degrade the microbes.
Neutrophils are a second major type of phagocyte, usually
recruited to sites of infection. Finally, dendritic cells also
can bind and phagocytose microbes. As will be described
later in this chapter and more extensively in Chapters 8
and 11, uptake and degradation of microbes by dendritic
cells play key roles in the initiation of adaptive immune
responses. In addition to triggering phagocytosis, various
receptors on phagocytes recognize microbes and activate
the production of a variety of molecules that contribute in
other ways to eliminating infection, as will be described
later in this chapter. A phagocyte’s recognition of microbes
and the responses that result are shown in Overview
Figure 5-6.

Microbes are Recognized by Receptors on
Phagocytic Cells
How does a phagocytic cell recognize microbes, triggering
their phagocytosis? Phagocytes express on their surfaces a
variety of receptors, some of which directly recognize specific conserved molecular components on the surfaces of
microbes, such as cell wall components of bacteria and
fungi. These conserved motifs, usually present in many copies on the surface of a bacterium, fungal cell, parasite, or
virus particle, are called pathogen-associated molecular
patterns (PAMPs). Note that they can be expressed by
microbes whether or not the microbes are pathogenic (cause

Microbial invasion brings many effectors of innate immunity into
play. Entry of microbial invaders through lesions in epithelial barriers generates inflammatory signals and exposes the invaders to
attack by different effector molecules and cells. Microbes with surface components recognized by C-reactive protein (CRP), mannosebinding lectin (MBL), or surfactant proteins A or D (SP-A and SP-D)
are bound by these opsonizing molecules, marking the microbes
for phagocytosis by neutrophils and macrophages. Some bacteria
and fungi can activate complement directly, or via bound CRP or
MBL, leading to further opsonization or direct lysis. Inflammatory
signals cause phagocytes such as monocytes and neutrophils to
bind to the walls of blood vessels, extravasate, and move to the
site of infection, where they phagocytose and kill infecting

microorganisms. Binding of microbes to receptors on phagocytes
activates phagocytosis and production of additional antimicrobial
and proinflammatory molecules that intensify the response, in part
by recruiting more phagocytes and soluble mediators (CRP, MBL,
and complement) from the bloodstream to the site of infection.
Inset: Dendritic cells bind microbes via receptors and are activated
to mature; they also internalize and degrade microbes. These dendritic cells migrate through lymphatic vessels to nearby lymph
nodes, where they present antigen-derived peptides on their MHC
proteins to T cells. Antigen-activated T cells then initiate adaptive
immune responses against the pathogen. Cytokines produced during innate immune responses also support and direct the adaptive
immune responses to infection.

disease); hence some researchers have started to use the
more general term microbe-associated molecular patterns
(MAMPs). The receptors that recognize PAMPs are called
pattern recognition receptors (PRRs). Some PRRs that
bind microbes and trigger phagocytosis of the bound
microbes are listed at the top of Table 5-3, along with the
PAMPs they recognize. As we will see later, there are other
PRRs that, after PAMP binding, do not activate phagocytosis
but trigger other types of responses. Most PAMPs that
induce phagocytosis are cell wall components, including
complex carbohydrates such as mannans and -glucans,
lipopolysaccharides (LPS), other lipid-containing molecules,
peptidoglycans, and surface proteins.
As shown in Figure 5-6, activation of phagocytosis can
also occur indirectly, by phagocyte recognition of soluble
proteins that have bound to microbial surfaces, thus enhancing phagocytosis, a process called opsonization (from the
Greek word for “to make tasty”). Many of these soluble
phagocytosis-enhancing proteins (called opsonins) also
bind to conserved, repeating components on the surfaces of
microbes such as carbohydrate structures, lipopolysaccharides, and viral proteins; hence they are sometimes referred
to as soluble pattern-recognition proteins. Once bound to
microbe surfaces, opsonins are recognized by membrane
opsonin receptors on phagocytes, activating phagocytosis
(see Table 5-3, bottom).
A variety of soluble proteins function as opsonins; many
play other roles as well in innate immunity. For example, the
two surfactant collectin proteins mentioned earlier, SP-A and
SP-D, are found in the blood as well as in mucosal secretions

in the lungs and elsewhere, where they function as opsonins.
After binding to microbes they are recognized by the CD91
opsonin receptor (see Table 5-3) and promote phagocytosis
by alveolar and other macrophage populations. This function
of SP-A and SP-D contributes to clearance of the fungal respiratory pathogen Pneumocystis carinii, a major cause of pneumonia in individuals with AIDS. Mannose-binding lectin
(MBL), a third collectin with opsonizing activity, is found in
the blood and respiratory fluids. L-ficolin, a member of the
ficolin family that is related to MBL and other collectins, is
found in the blood, where it binds to acetylated sugars on
microbes, including some streptococcal bacteria. The complement component C1q also functions as an opsonin, binding bacterial cell wall components such as lipopolysaccharides
and some viral proteins.
MBL (and other collectins), ficolins, and C1q share structural features, including similar polymeric structures with
collagen-like shafts, but have recognition regions with different binding specificities (Figure 5-7). As a result of their
structural similarities, all are bound by the CD91 opsonin
receptor (see Table 5-3) and activate pathogen phagocytosis.
Another opsonin, C-reactive protein (CRP), recognizes
phosphorylcholine and carbohydrates on bacteria, fungi,
and parasites, and is then bound by Fc receptors (FcRs) for
IgG found on most phagocytes (see Chapter 3). Fc receptors
also are important for the opsonizing activity of IgA antibodies and some IgG antibody subclasses. After binding
specifically to antigens on microbe surfaces, the Fc regions of
these antibodies can be recognized by specific FcRs, triggering phagocytosis. As an important mechanism by which the

antibodies (not shown in Figure 5-6) will be discussed in
Chapter 13.
As mentioned above, among the most effective opsonins
are several components of the complement system, which is
described detail in Chapter 6. Present in both invertebrates
and vertebrates, complement straddles both the innate and
adaptive immune systems, indicating that it is ancient and
important. In vertebrates, complement consists of more than
30 binding proteins and enzymes that function in a cascade
of sequential activation steps. It can be triggered by several
innate soluble pattern-recognition proteins (including the

pathway. C1, the first component of complement, has a multimeric
structure similar to that of MBL and H-ficolin. C1q can bind LPS on
bacterial cell walls (c) or antibodies bound to antigens (d). After C1
binds to the pathogen-associated LPS or antibodies, the associated
C1r and C1s subunit proteases, which are similar to MASPs, become
activated and can initiate complement activation. [Adapted from

first complement component, C1q, and the structurally
related lectins MBL and ficolins, C-reactive protein, and
properdin), as well as by microbe-bound antibodies generated by the adaptive immune response. As we will see in
Chapter 6, phagocytosis is one of many important antimicrobial effects resulting from complement activation. The
importance of MBL’s roles as both an opsonizer and an
inducer of complement activation has been indicated by the
effects of MBL deficiencies, which affect about 25% of the
population. Individuals with MBL deficiencies are predisposed to severe respiratory tract infections, especially pneumococcal pneumonia. Interestingly, MBL deficiencies may

be protective against tuberculosis, probably reflecting MBL’s
opsonizing role in enhancing the phagocytosis of Mycobacterium tuberculosis, the route by which it infects macrophages, potentially leading to tuberculosis.

Phagocytosed Microbes are Killed
by Multiple Mechanisms
The binding of microbes—bacteria, fungi, protozoan parasites,
and viruses—to phagocytes via pattern recognition receptors
or opsonins and opsonin receptors (see Figure 5-6) activates
signaling pathways. These signaling pathways trigger actin
polymerization, resulting in membrane extensions around the
microbe particles and their internalization, forming phagosomes (see Figure 5-5). The phagosomes then fuse with lysosomes and, in neutrophils, with preformed primary and
secondary granules (see Figure 2-2a). The resulting phagolysosomes contain an arsenal of antimicrobial agents that then
kill and degrade the internalized microbes. These agents
include antimicrobial proteins and peptides (including defensins and cathelicidins), low pH, acid-activated hydrolytic
enzymes (including lysozyme and proteases), and specialized
molecules that mediate oxidative attack.
Oxidative attack on the phagocytosed microbes, which
occurs in neutrophils, macrophages, and dendritic cells,
employs highly toxic reactive oxygen species (ROS) and
reactive nitrogen species (RNS), which damage intracellular components (Figure 5-8). The reactive oxygen species are
generated by the phagocytes’ unique NADPH oxidase
enzyme complex (also called phagosome oxidase), which is

|

CHAPTER 5

activated when microbes bind to the phagocytic receptors.
The oxygen consumed by phagocytes to support ROS production by NADPH oxidase is provided by a metabolic
process known as the respiratory burst, during which oxygen
uptake by the cell increases severalfold. NADPH oxidase
converts oxygen to superoxide ion (•O2); other ROS generated by the action of additional enzymes are hydrogen
peroxide (H2O2), and hypochlorous acid (HClO), the active
component of household bleach.
The generation of RNS requires the transcriptional activation of the gene for the enzyme inducible nitric oxide
synthase (iNOS, or NOS2)—called that to distinguish it
from related NO synthases in other tissues. Expression of
iNOS is activated by microbial components binding to various PRRs. iNOS oxidizes L-arginine to yield L-citrulline and
nitric oxide (NO), a potent antimicrobial agent. In combination with superoxide ion (•O2) generated by NADPH oxidase, NO produces an additional reactive nitrogen species,
peroxynitrite (ONOO) and toxic S-nitrosothiols. Collectively the ROS and RNS are highly toxic to phagocytosed
microbes due to the alteration of microbial molecules
through oxidation, hydroxylation, chlorination, nitration,
and S-nitrosylation, along with formation of sulfonic acids
and destruction of iron-sulfur clusters in proteins. One
example of how these oxidative species may be toxic to
pathogens is the oxidation by ROS of cysteine sulfhydryls
that are present in the active sites of many enzymes, inactivating the enzymes. ROS and RNS also can be released from
activated neutrophils and macrophages and kill extracellular
pathogens.

Innate Immunity

Evidence from genetic defects in humans and mice
highlights the critical roles of these reactive chemical species in microbial elimination by phagocytic cells. The
importance to antimicrobial defense of phagosomal
NADPH oxidase and its products, ROS and RNS, is illustrated by chronic granulomatous disease (CGD). Patients
afflicted with this disease have dramatically increased susceptibility to some fungal and bacterial infections, caused
by defects in subunits of NADPH oxidase that destroy its
ability to generate oxidizing species. In addition, studies
with mice in which the genes encoding iNOS were knocked
out have shown that nitric oxide and substances derived
from it account for much of the antimicrobial activity of
macrophages against bacteria, fungi, and parasites. These
mice lost much of their usual ability to control infections
by such intracellular pathogens as M. tuberculosis and
Leishmania major, the intracellular protozoan parasite that
causes leishmaniasis.

Phagocytosis Contributes to Cell Turnover
and the Clearance of Dead Cells
Our discussion of phagocytosis thus far has focused on its
essential roles in killing pathogens. As the body’s main scavenger cells, macrophages also utilize their phagocytic receptors to take up and clear cellular debris, cells that have died
from damage or toxic stimuli (necrotic cell death) or from
apoptosis (programmed cell death), and aging red blood cells.
Considerable progress has been made in recent years in
understanding the specific markers and receptors that trigger macrophage phagocytosis of dead, dying, and aging cells.
Collectively the components of dead/dying cells and damaged tissues that are recognized by PRRs leading to their
clearance are sometimes referred to as damage-associated
molecular patterns (DAMPs). As the presence of these
components may also be an indicator of conditions harmful
to the body or may contribute to harmful consequences
(such as autoimmune diseases), the D in DAMP also can
refer to a “Danger” signal. Phagocytosis is the major mode of
clearance of cells that have undergone apoptosis as part of
developmental remodeling of tissues, normal cell turnover,
or killing of pathogen-infected or tumor cells by innate or
adaptive immune responses.
Apoptotic cells attract phagocytes by releasing the lipid
mediator lysophosphatidic acid, which functions as a chemoattractant. These dying cells facilitate their own phagocytosis by expressing on their surfaces an array of molecules
not expressed on healthy cells, including phospholipids
(such as phosphatidyl serine and lysophosphatidyl choline),
proteins (annexin I), and altered carbohydrates. These
DAMPs are recognized directly by phagocytic receptors such
as the phosphatidyl serine receptor and scavenger receptor
SR-A1. Other DAMPs are recognized by soluble pattern
recognition molecules that function as opsonins, including
the collectins MBL, SP-A, and SP-D mentioned earlier; various complement components; and the pentraxins C-reactive

protein and serum amyloid protein. These opsonins are then
recognized by opsonin receptors, activating phagocytosis
and degradation of the apoptotic cells.
An important additional activity of macrophages in the
spleen and those in the liver (known as Kupffer cells) is to
recognize, phagocytose, and degrade aging and damaged red
blood cells. As these cells age, novel molecules that are recognized by phagocytes accumulate in their plasma membrane. Phosphatidyl serine flips from the inner to the outer
leaflet of the lipid bilayer and is recognized by phosphatidyl
serine receptors on phagocytes. Modifications of erythrocyte
membrane proteins have also been detected that may promote phagocytosis.
Obviously it is important for normal cells not to be
phagocytosed, and accumulating evidence indicates that
whether or not a cell is phagocytosed is controlled by sets of
“eat me” signals—the altered membrane components
(DAMPs) described above—and “don’t eat me” signals
expressed by normal cells. Young, healthy erythrocytes avoid
being phagocytosed by not expressing “eat me” signals, such
as phosphatidyl serine, and also by expressing a “don’t eat
me” signal, the protein CD47. CD47, expressed on many cell
types throughout the body, is recognized by the SIRP-
receptor on macrophages, which transmits signals that
inhibit phagocytosis. Recent studies have shown that tumors
use elevated CD47 expression to evade tumor surveillance
and phagocytic elimination by the immune system. Increased
expression of CD47 on all or most human cancers is correlated with tumor progression, probably because the CD47
activates SIRP-1-mediated inhibition of the phagocytosis
of tumor cells by macrophages. This understanding of the
role of CD47 in preventing phagocytosis is being used to
develop novel therapies for certain cancers, such as using
antibodies to block CD47 on tumor cells, which should then
allow them to be phagocytosed and eliminated.

Induced Cellular Innate Responses
In addition to triggering their own uptake and killing by
phagocytic cells, microbes induce a broad spectrum of cellular innate immune responses by a wide variety of cell
types. Several families of pattern recognition receptors
(PRRs) other than those described earlier as mediating
phagocytosis (see Table 5-3) play major roles in innate
immunity. As we will see in this section, these PRRs bind
to PAMPs as well as to some endogenous (self) DAMPs
and trigger signal-transduction pathways that turn on
expression of genes with important functions in innate
immunity. Among the proteins encoded by these genes
are antimicrobial molecules such as antimicrobial peptides
and interferons, chemokines and cytokines that recruit and
activate other cells, enzymes such as iNOS (mentioned
earlier) that generate antimicrobial molecules, and proinflammatory mediators (i.e., components that promote
inflammation).

CHAPTER 5

Cellular Pattern Recognition Receptors Activate
Responses to Microbes and Cell Damage
Several families of cellular PRRs contribute to the activation
of innate immune responses that combat infections. Some of
these PRRs are expressed on the plasma membrane, while
others are actually found inside our cells, either in endosomes/lysosomes or in the cytosol. This array of PRRs
ensures that the cell can recognize PAMPs on both extracellular and intracellular pathogens. DAMPs released by cell
and tissue damage also can be recognized by both cell surface and intracellular PRRs. Many cell types in the body
express these PRRs, including all types of myeloid white
blood cells (monocytes, macrophages, neutrophils, eosinophils, mast cells, basophils, dendritic cells) and subsets of the
three types of lymphocytes (B cells, T cells, and NK cells).
PRRs are also expressed by some other cell types, especially
those commonly exposed to infectious agents; examples
include the skin, mucosal and glandular epithelial cells, vascular endothelial cells that line the blood vessels, and fibroblasts and stromal support cells in various tissues. While it is
unlikely that any single cell expresses all of these PRRs, subsets of the receptors are expressed by various cell subpopulations. The rest of this section describes the four main
families of mammalian PRRs and the signaling pathways
that they activate, leading to protective responses.

Toll-Like Receptors Recognize Many Types
of Pathogen Molecules
Toll-like receptors (TLRs) were the first family of PRRs to
be discovered and are still the best-characterized in terms of
their structure, how they bind PAMPs and activate cells, and
the extensive and varied set of innate immune responses that
they induce.
Discovery of Invertebrate Toll and Vertebrate
Toll-like Receptors
In the 1980s, researchers in Germany discovered that Drosophila
fruit fly embryos could not establish a proper dorsal-ventral
(back to front) axis if the gene encoding the Toll membrane
protein is mutated. (The name “Toll” comes from German
slang meaning “weird,” referring to the mutant flies’ bizarrely
scrambled anatomy.) For their subsequent characterization of
the toll and related homeobox genes and their role in the
regulation of embryonic development, Christiane NussleinVolhard, Eric Wieschaus, and Edward B. Lewis were awarded
the Nobel Prize in Physiology and Medicine in 1995. But what
does this have to do with immune system receptors? Many
mutations of the toll gene were generated, and in 1996 Jules
Hoffman and Bruno Lemaitre discovered that mutations in
toll made flies highly susceptible to lethal infection with
Aspergillus fumigatus, a fungus to which wild-type flies were
immune (Figure 5-9). This striking observation led to other
studies showing that Toll and related proteins are involved in
the activation of innate immune responses in invertebrates.

FIGURE 5-9 Impaired innate immunity in fruit flies with a
mutation in the Toll pathway. Severe infection with the fungus
Aspergillus fumigatus (yellow) results from a mutation in the signaling
pathway downstream of the Toll pathway in Drosophila that normally
activates production of the antimicrobial peptide drosomycin. [Electron micrograph adapted from B. Lemaitre et al., 1996, Cell 86:973; courtesy of
J. A. Hoffman, University of Strasbourg.]

For his pivotal contributions to the study of innate immunity
in Drosophila, Jules Hoffman was a co-winner of the 2011
Nobel Prize in Physiology and Medicine.
Characterization of the Toll protein surprisingly revealed
that its cytoplasmic signaling domain was homologous to
that of the vertebrate receptor for the cytokine IL-1 (IL-1R).
Through a search for human proteins with cytoplasmic
domains homologous to those of Toll and IL-1R, in 1997
Charles Janeway and Ruslan Medzhitov discovered a human
gene for a protein similar to Toll that activated the expression of innate immunity genes in human cells. Appropriately, this and other vertebrate Toll relatives discovered soon
thereafter were named Toll-like receptors (TLRs).
Through studies with mutant mice, in 1998 Bruce Beutler
obtained the important proof that TLRs contribute to normal immune functions in mammals. Mice homozygous for a
mutant form of a gene called lps were resistant to the harmful responses induced by lipolysaccharide (LPS; also known
as endotoxin), a major component of the cell walls of Gramnegative bacteria (Figure 5-10). In humans, a buildup of
endotoxin from severe bacterial infection can induce too
strong of an innate immune response, causing septic shock,
a life-threatening condition in which vital organs such as the

whereas the stain is easily washed out of the less-dense cell walls

brain, heart, kidney, and liver may fail. Each year, about
20,000 people die in the United States of septic shock caused
by Gram-negative bacterial infections, so it was striking that
some mutant strains of mice were resistant to fatal doses of
LPS. Beutler found that the defective mouse lps gene
encoded a mutant form of one TLR, TLR4, which differed
from the normal form by a single amino acid so that it no
longer was activated by LPS. This work provided an unequivocal demonstration that TLR4 is the cellular innate pattern
recognition receptor that recognizes LPS and earned Beutler
a share of the 2011 Nobel Prize.
Thus, this landmark series of experiments showed in
rapid succession that invertebrates respond to pathogens,
that they use receptors also found in vertebrates, and that
one of these receptors is responsible for LPS-induced innate
immune responses.

TLRs and Their Ligands

Intensive work over the last decade and a half has identified
multiple TLR family members in mice and humans—as of
2011, 13 TLRs that function as PRRs have been identified in
these species. TLRs 1-10 are conserved between mice and
humans, although TLR10 is not functional in mice, while
TLRs 11-13 are expressed in mice but not in humans. While
TLRs have not been shown to be involved in vertebrate development, unlike in fruit flies, the set of TLRs present in a
human or mouse can detect a wide variety of PAMPs from
bacteria, viruses, fungi, and parasites, as well as DAMPs from
damaged cells and tissues. Each TLR has a distinct repertoire
of specificities for conserved PAMPs; the TLRs and some of
their known PAMP ligands are listed in Table 5-4. Biochemical studies have revealed the structure of several TLRs and

how they bind their specific ligands. TLRs are membranespanning proteins that share a common structural element
in their extracellular region called leucine-rich repeats
(LRRs); multiple LRRs make up the horseshoe-shaped
extracellular ligand-binding domain of the TLR polypeptide
chain (Figure 5-11a).
When TLRs bind their PAMP or DAMP ligands via their
extracellular LRR domains, they are induced to dimerize. In
most cases each TLR dimerizes with itself, forming a homodimer, but TLR2 forms heterodimers by pairing with either
TLR1 or TLR6. How TLRs bind their ligands was not known
until complexes of the extracellular LRR domain dimers with
bound ligands were analyzed by x-ray crystallography. Structures of TLR2/1 with a bound lipopeptide and TLR3 with
dsRNA are shown in Figure 5-11b; the characteristic
“m”-shaped conformation of TLR dimers is apparent.
As shown in Figure 5-12, TLRs exist both on the plasma
membrane and in the membranes of endosomes and lysosomes; their cellular location is tailored to enable them to
respond optimally to the particular microbial ligands they
recognize. TLRs that recognize PAMPs on the outer sur-

face of extracellular microbes (see Table 5-4) are found on
the plasma membrane, where they can bind these PAMPs
and induce responses. In contrast, TLRs that recognize
internal microbial components that have to be exposed by
the dismantling or degradation of endocytosed pathogens—
nucleic acids in particular—are found in endosomes and
lysosomes. Unique among the TLRs, TLR4 has been
shown to move from the plasma membrane to endosomes/
lysosomes after binding LPS or other PAMPs. As we will
see below, it activates different signaling pathways from
the two locations.
In addition to microbial ligands, TLRs also recognize
DAMPs, endogenous (self) components released by dead/
dying cells or damaged tissues. Among the DAMPS recognized by plasma membrane TLRs are heat shock and chromatin proteins, fragments of extracellular matrix components
(such as fibronectin and hyaluronin), and oxidized lowdensity lipoprotein and amyloid-. While self nucleic acids
usually do not activate the intracellular PRR, under certain
circumstances (such as when bound by anti-DNA or antichromatin antibodies in individuals with the autoimmune

Each TLR polypeptide chain is made up of a ligand-binding exterior domain that contains many leucine-rich repeats (LRRs,

membrane-spanning domain (blue), and an interior Toll/IL-1R

that induce the expression of subsets of proteins, some of
which are particularly effective in combating the type of
pathogen recognized by the particular TLR(s). An important
example is expression of the potent antiviral Type 1 interferons, IFNs- and -, induced by pathways downstream of the
TLRs that bind viral components. As described below, activation of the interferon regulatory factors (IRFs) is essential for inducing transcription of the genes encoding IFN-
and -. Combinations of transcription factors contribute to
inducing the expression of many of these genes; examples
include combinations of NF-B, IRFs, and/or transcription
factors downstream of MAP kinase (MAPK) pathways (see
Chapters 3 and 4), such as AP-1, that can be activated by
signaling intermediates downstream of certain TLRs.
The particular signal transduction pathway(s) activated by
a TLR dimer following PAMP binding are largely determined
by the TLR and by the initial protein adaptor (see Chapter 3)
that binds to the TLR’s cytoplasmic domain. As shown in Figure 5-11a, this region is called the TIR domain (from Toll/IL-1
receptor), referring to the similarity noted earlier between the
cytoplasmic domains of TLRs and IL-1 receptors (see Figure
4-5a). TIR domains of all TLR dimers serve as binding sites for
the TIR domains of adaptors that activate the downstream

Signaling Through TLRs: Overview
Given the wide variety of potential pathogens the innate
immune system needs to recognize and combat, how does
binding of a specific pathogen evoke an appropriate response
for that pathogen? Signaling through TLRs utilizes many of
the principles and some of the signaling molecules described
in Chapters 3 and 4, along with some unique to pathways
activated by TLRs (and by other PRRs, described below).
Detailed studies of the signaling pathways downstream of
all of the TLRs, summarized schematically in Figure 5-13,
have revealed that they include some shared components
and activate expression of many of the same genes. An
important example of a shared component is the transcription factor NF-B. NF-B is key for inducing many innate
and inflammatory genes, including those encoding defensins; enzymes such as iNOS; chemokines; and cytokines
such as the proinflammatory cytokines TNF-, IL-1, and
IL-6, produced by macrophages and dendritic cells. There
are also TLR-specific signaling pathways and components

compartment, where it can activate different signaling components.

signaling pathways. The two key adaptors are MyD88 (Myeloid
differentiation factor 88) and TRIF (TIR-domain-containing
adaptor-inducing IFN- factor). As shown in Figure 5-13, most
TLRs, whether found on the cell surface or in endosomes/
lysosomes, bind the adaptor protein MyD88 (activating
MyD88-dependent signaling pathways). In contrast, TLR3
binds the alternative adaptor protein TRIF (activating TRIFdependent signaling pathways). TLR4 is unique in binding
both MyD88 (when it is in the plasma membrane, signaling its
endocytosis) and TRIF (when it is in endosomes, after internalization). Figure 5-13 also shows the presence of two additional adaptors associated with most TLRs: TIRAP (TIR-domain
containing adaptor protein) and TRAM (TRIF-related adaptor
molecule). They are TIR domain-containing adaptors that
serve as sorting receptors: TIRAP helps to recruit MyD88 to
TLRs 2/1, 2/6, and 4, and TRAM helps to recruit TRIF to both
TLR3 and endosomal/lysosomal TLR4.

vated IKK then phosphorylates the inhibitory IB subunit of
NF-B, releasing NF-B to enter the nucleus and activate
gene expression. TAK1 does double duty in this TLR signaling cascade. After separating from the IKK complex, it activates MAPK signaling pathways (see Chapter 3) that result
in the activation of transcription factors including Fos and
Jun, which make up the AP-1 dimer (see Figure 3-16).
In addition to activating NF-B and MAPK pathways via
the MyD88-dependent pathway, the endosomal TLRs 7, 8,
and 9, which bind microbial nucleic acids (especially viral
RNA and bacterial DNA), also trigger pathways that activate
IRFs. As shown in Figure 5-13, when triggered by these TLRs,
the MyD88/IRAK4/TRAF6 complex activates a complex containing TRAF3, IRAK1, and IKK, leading to the phosphorylation, dimerization, activation, and nuclear localization of
IRF7. IRF7 induces the transcription of genes for both Type 1
interferons, IFN- and -, which have potent antiviral
activity. Thus different TLRs may differentially activate distinct
transcription factors (NF-B, certain IRFs, and/or those activated by MAPK pathways), leading to variation in which genes
are turned on to help protect us against the invading pathogens.

MyD88-Dependent Signaling Pathways
After associating with a TLR dimer following ligand binding,
MyD88 initiates a signaling pathway that activates the
NF-B and MAPK pathways by essentially the same pathway as that activated by IL-1 (see Figure 4-6). As shown for
plasma membrane TLRs 2/1, 4, and 5 in Figure 5-13, MyD88
recruits and activates several IRAK protein kinases, which
then bind and activate TRAF6. TRAF6 ubiquitinates NEMO
and TAB proteins, leading to the activation of TAK1, which
then phosphorylates the IB kinase (IKK) complex. Acti-

TRIF-Dependent Signaling Pathways
For the two endosomal TLRs that recruit the TRIF adaptor
instead of MyD88—TLR3 and endosomal TLR4—the
downstream signaling pathways differ somewhat from those
activated by MyD88 (see Figure 5-13). TRIF recruits the RIP1
protein kinase that in turn recruits and activates TRAF6,

FIGURE 5-13 TLR signaling pathways. Signaling pathways
downstream of TLRs are shown for three cell surface TLRs (TLR2/1,

and for endosomal/lysosomal TLRs TLR7 and TLR 9 (in endosome

which then initiates the same steps as in the MyD88-dependent pathway. TLR3 also activates PI3K, which enhances
MAPK pathway activation. In addition, TRIF activates
TRAF3 and a complex of TBK-1 and IKK, which phosphorylates and activates IRF7 and a different IRF—IRF3.
IRF3 and IRF7 dimerize and move into the nucleus and
(together with NF-B and AP-1) induce the transcription of
the IFN- and - genes. Thus, all of the intracellular TLRs
that bind viral PAMPs in an infected cell induce the synthesis

and secretion of Type I interferons, which feed back to potently
inhibit the replication of the virus in that infected cell.

C-Type Lectin Receptors Bind Carbohydrates
on the Surfaces of Extracellular Pathogens
The second family of cell surface PRRs that activate innate and
inflammatory responses is the C-type lectin receptor (CLR)
family. CLRs are plasma membrane receptors expressed

c05InnateImmunity.indd Page 159 12/19/12 11:54 PM user-t044

Innate Immunity
variably on monocytes, macrophages, dendritic cells, neutrophils, B cells, and T-cell subsets. CLRs generally recognize
carbohydrate components of fungi, mycobacteria, viruses,
parasites, and some allergens (peanut and dust mite proteins).
Humans have at least 15 CLRs that function as PRRs, most of
which recognize one or more specific sugar moieties such as
mannose (e.g., the mannose receptor and DC-SIGN), fucose
(e.g., Dectin-2 and DC-SIGN), and glucans (e.g., Dectin-1).
CLRs have a variety of functions. Unlike TLRs, which do
not promote phagocytosis, some CLRs function as phagocytic receptors (see Table 5-3), and all CLRs trigger signaling
pathways that activate transcription factors that induce effector gene expression. Some CLRs trigger signaling events that
initially differ from TLR signaling but generally lead to
downstream steps similar to the MyD88-dependent TLR
pathways that activate the transcription factors NF-B and
AP-1. An example of this is Dectin-1, which binds cell wall
-1,3 glucans on mycobacteria, yeast, and other fungi (Fig-

ure 5-14). Dectin-1 contains a cytoplasmic domain with an
ITAM similar to those in the signaling chains of B-cell and
T-cell antigen receptors (see Chapter 3). After Dectin-1 binds
a ligand, its ITAM is phosphorylated and then recognized by
the tyrosine kinase Syk, also involved in the initial stages of
B-cell activation (see Figure 3-28). Syk triggers MAPK pathways, leading to the activation of the transcription factor
AP-1, and also activates CARD9, one of many signaling components with Caspase recruitment domains (CARD; see
Table 3-1 and additional examples below). CARD9 forms a
complex with additional signaling components, leading to
the activation of IKK and the nuclear translocation of NF-B
as described above for TLR. NF-B and AP-1 cooperate in
inducing expression of inflammatory cytokines and IFN-.
Signals through different PRRs can modulate each other’s
effects, enhancing or inhibiting expression of particular genes.

TLRs are similar, signals coming into a cell from TLRs and

control expression of genes for additional cytokines that regulate helper-T-cell differentiation, as we will see later. Other
CLRs have different cytoplasmic domains, downstream signaling pathways, and outcomes. For example, the binding of
PAMPs to one CLR, DC-SIGN, on dendritic cells curtails
inflammation by inducing expression of the anti-inflammatory
cytokine IL-10 or by reducing mRNA levels for proinflammatory cytokines. In some cases such modulatory effects are
beneficial, as responses can be switched from potentially
harmful inflammatory responses to the activation of protective T-cell populations. However, as is discussed later, pathogens can also take advantage of these control circuits to reduce
responses that would contribute to their elimination.

Retinoic Acid-Inducible Gene-I-Like Receptors
Bind Viral RNA in the Cytosol of Infected Cells
The Retinoic acid-inducible gene-I-like receptors (RLRs)
are soluble PRRs that reside in the cytosol of many cell types,
where they play critical roles as sensors of viral infection (see
Figure 5-14). The three known RLRs (RIG-I, MDA5, and
LGP2) are CARD-containing RNA helicases that recognize
viral RNAs, usually from RNA viruses such as influenza,
measles, and West Nile. These receptors appear to distinguish
viral from cellular RNA on the basis of particular structural
features not shared by normal cellular RNA, such as doublestranded regions of the RNA, virus-specific sequence motifs,
and, in the case of RIG-I, a 5 triphosphate modification that
arises during viral RNA synthesis and processing. Upon viral
RNA binding, RIG-I undergoes a conformational change that
leads to binding via CARD-CARD interactions to its downstream adaptor molecule located in mitochondrial membranes, the mitochondria-associated MAVS (mitochondrial
anti-viral signaling) protein. MAVS aggregates and recruits
additional proteins, including the adaptor TRADD, TRAF3,
and RIP1, which activate NEMO/IKKs that lead to the activation of IKK complexes, which activate IRFs 3 and 7 and the
NF-B pathway, leading to expression of IFNs  and , other
antimicrobials, chemokines, and proinflammatory cytokines.

Nod-Like Receptors are Activated by a Variety of
PAMPs, DAMPs, and Other Harmful Substances
The final family of PRRs is the NLRs. (NLR is an acronym
that stands for both Nod-like receptors and nucleotide
oligomerization domain/leucine-rich repeat-containing
receptors). The NLRs are a large family of cytosolic proteins
activated by intracellular PAMPs and substances that alert
cells to damage or danger (DAMPs and other harmful substances). They play major roles in activating beneficial innate
immune and inflammatory responses, but, as we will see,

some NLRs also trigger inflammation that causes extensive
tissue damage and disease. The human genome contains
approximately 23 NLR genes, and the mouse genome up to
34. NLR proteins are divided into three major groups, based
largely on their domain structure, as shown in Figure 5-15:
NLRCs (which have caspase recruitment domains, CARD),
NLRBs (some of which have baculovirus inhibitory repeat,
BIR, domains), and NLRPs (which have pyrin domains, PYD).
The functions of many NLRs have not yet been well characterized; those of several NLRs are described below.
NOD1 and NOD2
The best-characterized members of the NLRC family are
NOD1 and NOD2. Important PAMPs recognized by NOD1
and NOD2 are breakdown products (such as muramyl dipeptides) produced during the synthesis or degradation of cell wall
peptidoglycans of either intracellular or extracellular bacteria—
peptides from the latter must enter the cell to activate NODs.
Studies in mice have shown that NOD1 also provides protection against the intracellular protozoan parasite Trypanosoma
cruzi, which causes Chagas disease in humans, and that NOD2
activates responses to some viruses, including influenza.
PAMP binding to the LRR regions of NODs initiates signaling
by activating NOD binding to the serine/threonine kinase
RIP2 through their CARDs (Figure 5-14). RIP2 then activates
IKK, leading to nuclear translocation of NF-B. RIP2 also
activates MAPK pathways, leading to AP-1 activation. The
activated NF-B and AP-1 initiate transcription of inflammatory cytokines—including TNF-, IL-1, and IL-6—and antimicrobial and other mediators. In addition, RIP2 activates the
TRAF3/TBK1/IKK complex, leading to phosphorylation of
IRFs 3 and 7 and to production of IFNs- and -.
NLR Inflammasomes
Whereas the NOD1 and NOD2 NLRCs activate the transcription of genes encoding inflammatory cytokines and
antimicrobial and other proteins, some other NLRs do not
trigger signaling pathways inducing expression of genes
involved in innate immune responses. Instead, these NLRs
assemble with other proteins into a complex that activates
proteases necessary for converting the inactive large precursor forms (procytokines) of IL-1 and IL-18 into the mature
forms that are secreted by activated cells. Because of the very
potent inflammatory effects of secreted IL-1 (and also to
some extent IL-18) (see Chapter 4), these complexes of
certain NLRs with other proteins, including key proteases,
are now referred to as inflammasomes. The discovery and
surprising properties of inflammasomes are described in
Advances Box 5-1.

FIGURE 5-15 NLR families. NLRs are characterized by distinct
protein domains. All NLRs have a leucine-rich repeat (LRR) domain,
similar to those in TLRs, that functions in ligand binding in at least
some NLRs, and a nuclear-binding domain (NBD). The three main
classes are distinguished by their N-terminal domain (the lowest
domains in the figure): NLRC receptors have CARD domains, NLRP

proteins that help us to mount protective responses. Some of
the induced proteins are antimicrobial and directly combat
pathogens, while others serve key roles in activating and
enhancing innate and adaptive immune responses. There is
tremendous variation in what proteins are made in response
to pathogens, reflecting their PAMPs as well as the responding cell types and their arrays of PRRs. Some of the most
common proteins and peptides that are secreted by cells following PAMP activation of PRRs and that contribute to
innate and inflammatory responses are listed in Table 5-5.
Antimicrobial Peptides
Defensins and cathelicidins were mentioned earlier as being
important in barrier protection, such as on the skin and the
epithelial layers connected to the body’s openings (see
Table 5-2). Some cells and tissues constitutively (i.e., continually, without activation) express these peptides. For
example, human intestinal Paneth epithelial cells constitutively express -defensins and some -defensins, and some
defensins and the cathelicin LL-37 are constitutively synthesized and packaged in the granules of neutrophils, ready to

receptors have pyrin domains (PYD), and NLRB receptors have BIR
(baculovirus inhibitor repeat) domains (although the related protein
IPAF does not). These domains function in protein-protein interactions, largely through homotypic domain interactions. [Adapted from

et al. 2011. Immunity 34:665.]

kill phagocytosed bacteria, fungi, viruses, and protozoan
parasites. However, in some other cell types, such as mucosal
and glandular epithelial cells, skin keratinocytes, and NK
cells, the expression of these antimicrobial peptides is
induced or enhanced by signaling through PRRs, in particular TLRs and the NOD NLRs. Macrophages do not produce
these antimicrobial peptides following PRR activation; interestingly, however, there is an indirect pathway by which
microbes induce cathelicidin in macrophages. Binding of
microbial ligands to macrophage TLRs induces increased
expression of receptors for vitamin D; binding of vitamin D
to these receptors activates the macrophages to produce
cathelicidin, which then can help the macrophages kill the
pathogens.
Type I Interferons
Another major class of antimicrobial proteins transcriptionally induced directly by PRRs is the Type I interferons
(IFN-,). Type I interferon production is generally activated by those cell surface TLRs and intracellular TLRs,
RLRs, and NLRs that recognize viral nucleic acids and other

Inflammasomes
The cytokine IL-1 has been recognized as
one of the potent inducers of inflammation.
While it was known that the IL-1 gene is transcriptionally activated following exposure to
pathogen, damage, or danger-associated
molecules, additional steps were needed to
generate the mature IL-1 protein from its
large intracellular pro-IL-1 precursor. An
enzyme, initially called IL-1 Converting
Enzyme (ICE), now known as caspase-1, was
shown to carry out the cleavage of pro-IL-1,
but the enzyme itself existed in most cells as
a large inactive precursor. The breakthrough
in understanding how mature IL-1 is produced came in 2002 when Jurg Tschopp and
others published biochemical studies show-

ing that activation of cells by LPS induced the
formation of a large multiprotein aggregate
containing an NLR and mature caspase-1
that cleaved pro-IL-1 into mature IL-1, allowing its release from cells. Because of the
importance of IL-1 in promoting inflammation, Tschopp and his colleagues coined the
term inflammasome for the large protein
complex that activates caspase-1 to generate
IL-1. Three NLRs (NLRP1, NLRP3, and NLRC4)
have been shown to form inflammasomes
that activate caspase-1 to cleave the large
precursors of both IL-1 and IL-18, generating
the mature proinflammatory cytokines.
The best-characterized inflammasome
is the NLRP3 inflammasome, which is

expressed by monocytes, macrophages,
neutrophils, dendritic cells, and some lymphocytes and epithelial cells. NLRP3 is a large
complex containing multiple copies each of
NLRP3, the adaptor protein ASC (which binds
to NLRP3 via homotypic PYD:PYD domain
interactions), and caspase-1 (Figure 1). NLRP3
can be activated in cells by a variety of components from bacteria, fungi, and some
viruses. In addition to microbial components, NLRP3 can also be activated by nonmicrobial (“sterile”) substances, including
several DAMPs released by damaged tissues
and cells, such as hyaluronan, -amyloid
(associated with Alzheimer’s plaques), and
extracellular ATP and glucose. Recent

BOX 5-1
research has also implicated NLRP3 in mediating serious inflammatory conditions
caused by an unusual class of harmful substances: crystals. Crystals of monosodium
urate in individuals with hyperuricemia
cause gout, an inflammatory joint condition,
and inhalation of environmental silica or
asbestos crystals cause the serious, often
fatal, inflammatory lung conditions silicosis
and asbestosis. When these crystals are
phagocytosed, they damage lysosomal
membranes, releasing lysosomal components into the cytosol. Similar effects may be
responsible for the loosening (aseptic osteolysis) of artificial joints, caused by tiny metal
alloy particles from the prosthesis that also
activate NLRP3-mediated inflammation.
How these disparate PAMPs, DAMPs,
crystals, and metal particles all activate the
NLRP3 inflammasome is under intense
investigation. However, to date there is no
conclusive evidence for the binding of any
ligands directly to NLRP3; thus it may not act
as a PRR for PAMPs and DAMPs per se but
instead may sense changes in the intracellular milieu resulting from exposure to these
materials. Current models, summarized in
Figure 2, involve the activation by these varied stimuli of a common set of intracellular
signals, such as potassium ion efflux, reactive
oxygen species (ROS), and/or leakage of
lysosomal contents, all of which appear to
induce NLRP3 inflammasome assembly and
caspase-1 activation, leading to the processing and secretion of IL-1 and IL-18. It is clear,
however, that inflammasomes usually work
in tandem with other PRRs in a cell to generate these cytokines. Activation of many TLRs,
CLRs, RLRs, and NOD NLRs by PAMPs or
DAMPs primes the inflammatory response
by inducing transcription of the IL-1 and
IL-18 genes by the signaling pathways
described above. Once activated by as yet
unknown intracellular mediators, the NLRP3
inflammasome then processes the procytokine precursors to the mature, active IL-1 and
IL-18, which then are released by the cell by
an unknown atypical secretion process.
Somewhat less is known about the
other inflammasomes, although they are
also large multiprotein aggregates containing NLRs or related proteins and caspases
and generate mature IL-1 and IL-18. The

inflammasome discovered
by Tschopp contains the NLR
protein now called NLRP1
(see Figure 5-15), which is
expressed in a wide array of
hematopoietic and other
cell types. Its activation by
the lethal toxin of Bacillus
anthracis contributes to the
lethality of anthrax. The
NLRC4 (also called IPAF)
inflammasome, expressed
predominantly in hematopoietic cells, is activated by
certain Gram-negative bacteria and by the cytosolic
presence of bacterial flagellin. A fourth inflammasome
utilizes the AIM2 protein,
which does not contain an
NBD and hence is not an
NLR, but does contain a PYD
domain and hence can form
inflammasomes with ASC
and caspase-1. Interestingly,
AIM2, which is induced by
interferons, has been shown
recently to bind cytosolic
double-stranded DNA, such
as from intracellular viruses
and bacteria, and also to
generate mature IL-1 and
IL-18.
The recent discovery of
inflammasomes has provided the answer to one
long-standing question:
How is mature IL-1 generated in cells in response to
innate and inflammatory
stimuli? But other challenges remain, the most
important being to identify
the mechanism(s) by which
inflammasomes are activated, so that their key caspase-1 enzyme becomes
functional. In addition, as no
functions are known yet for
several other NLRs, more
inflammasomes may yet be
discovered.

FIGURE 2
Models for NLRP3 inflammasome activation. Three
major models for NLRP3 inflammasome activation have been
proposed, which may not be mutually exclusive. Model 1: The NLRP3
activator, ATP, triggers P2X7-dependent pore formation by the
pannexin-1 hemichannel, allowing potassium ion efflux and entry
into the cytosol of extracellular DAMPs and/or PAMPs which then
directly engage NLRP3. Model 2: Crystalline or particulate NLRP3
agonists are engulfed, and their physical characteristics lead to
lysosomal rupture. Released lysosomal contents, including enzymes,
then activate NLRP3 inflammasome in the cytoplasm by unknown
mechanisms; one possibility is cathepsin-B-dependent processing of
a direct NLRP3 ligand. Model 3: All DAMPs and PAMPs, including ATP
and particulate/crystalline activators, induce the generation of
reactive oxygen species (ROS). A ROS-dependent pathway triggers
NLRP3 inflammasome complex formation. Following these initial
activation steps, caspase-1 clustering in the inflammasome activates
caspase-1, which then cleaves pro-IL-1 and pro-IL-18 precursors
cytokines, generating IL-1 and IL-18, which are then secreted. In
some instances the death of the cell may also be induced. [Adapted

components and activate the IRF transcription factors. As
summarized in Table 5-5, Type I interferons are produced in
two situations. When virus infected, many cell types are
induced to make IFN- and/or IFN- following binding of
cytosolic viral PAMPs, such as nucleic acids, to their RLRs or
NLRs (see Figure 5-14). In addition, many cells express cell
surface TLRs recognizing viral PAMPs and/or internalize
virus without necessarily being infected, allowing endosomal TLRs to recognize viral components. Signaling from
these TLRs activates the IRFs and IFN-, production. One
particular type of dendritic cell, called the plasmacytoid
dendritic cell (pDC) because of its shape, is a particularly
effective producer of Type I IFNs. The pDCs endocytose
virus that has bound to various cell surface proteins (including CLRs such as DC-SIGN, which, for example, binds
HIV). TLRs 7 and 9 in the endosomes then are activated by
viral PAMPs (ssRNA and CpG DNA, respectively), leading
to IRF activation.

CHAPTER 5

165

Type I interferons exert their antiviral and other effects by
binding to a specific receptor, frequently called IFNAR (IFNalpha receptor), expressed by most cell types (see Chapter 4).
Similar to signaling pathways downstream of many cytokine
receptors (see Table 4-3 and Figure 4-11), binding of IFN-
or - activates IFNAR to recruit and activate specific JAKs
(JAK1 and Tyk2), which then activate specific STATs (STATs 1
and 2; see Figure 5-16). STAT1/1 and STAT1/2 dimers then
induce expression of various genes, including those for the
three proteins that block viral replication: protein kinase R
(PKR), which inhibits viral (and cellular) protein synthesis
by inhibiting the elongation factor eIF2; 2,5-oligoadenlyate
A synthetase, which activates the ribonuclease RNase L that
degrades viral mRNA; and Mx proteins, which inhibit both
the transcription of viral genes into mRNAs and the assembly of virus particles. Reflecting the potent antiviral activities
of Type I interferons, they are used to treat some viral infections, such as hepatitis B and C. In addition to their key

roles in controlling viral infections, Type I interferons have
other immune-related activities in that they activate NK cells
and regulate activities of macrophages and T cells. Treatment with IFN- has been shown to have beneficial effects
in some forms of multiple sclerosis, a T-cell-mediated autoimmune disease with inflammatory involvement, probably
by inhibiting production of certain proinflammatory T-cellderived cytokines (see Chapter 16).
Cytokines
Among the proteins transcriptionally induced by PRR activation are several key cytokines, which—while not directly
antimicrobial—activate and regulate a wide variety of cells
and tissues involved in innate, inflammatory, and adaptive
responses. As introduced in Chapter 4, cytokines function as
the protein hormones of the immune system, produced in
response to stimuli and acting on a variety of cellular targets.
Several key examples of cytokines induced by PRR activation during innate immune responses are listed in Table 5-5,
along with their effects on target cells and tissues.
Three of the most important cytokines are IL-1, IL-6, and
TNF-, the major proinflammatory cytokines that act locally
on blood vessels and other cells to increase vascular permeability and help recruit and activate cells at sites of infection;
they also have systemic effects (see below). IL-1, IL-6, and
GM-CSF also feed back on bone marrow hematopoiesis to
enhance production of neutrophils and other myeloid cells
that will contribute to pathogen clearance. Activation of
monocytes, macrophages, and dendritic cells through some
TLRs also induces production of IL-12 and IL-18, cytokines
that play key roles in inducing naïve helper T cells to become
TH1 cells, in particular by inducing production of IFN-. As
will be discussed in Chapter 11, the hallmark cytokine of
TH1 cells is IFN-, which stimulates cell-mediated immunity
and is an important macrophage-activating cytokine. Hence
IL-12 and IL-18 are also considered proinflammatory. IL-10
is another important cytokine specifically induced by some
TLRs in macrophages, dendritic cells, other myeloid cells,
and subsets of T, B, and NK cells. IL-10 is anti-inflammatory,
in that it inhibits macrophage activation and the production
of proinflammatory cytokines by other myeloid cells. IL-10
levels increase over time and contribute to controlling the
extent of inflammation-caused tissue damage.
Chemokines
These small protein chemoattractants (agents that induce
cells to move toward higher concentrations of the agent)
recruit cells into, within, and out of tissues (see Chapters 4
and 14 and Appendix III). Some chemokines are responsible
for constitutive (homeostatic) migration of white blood cells
throughout the body. Other chemokines, produced in
response to PRR activation, have key roles in the early stages
of immune and inflammatory responses in that they attract
cells that contribute both to clearing the infection or damage
and to amplifying the response. The first chemokine to be
cloned, IL-8 (also called CXCL8), is produced in response to

activation—by PAMPs, DAMPs, or some cytokines—of
a variety of cells at sites of infection or tissue damage, including macrophages, dendritic cells, epithelial cells, and vascular endothelial cells. One of IL-8’s key roles occurs in the
initial stages of infection or tissue damage; it serves as a
chemoattractant for neutrophils, recruiting them to sites of
infection. Other chemokines are specifically induced by PRR
activation of epithelial cells in certain mucosal tissues and
serve to recruit cells specifically to those sites, where they
generate immune responses appropriate for clearing the
invading pathogen. For example, B cells are recruited to the
lamina propria, the lymphocyte-rich tissue under the intestinal epithelium, by two chemokines, CCL28 and CCL20,
produced by intestinal epithelial cells activated by PAMP
binding to their TLRs. These activated epithelial cells (as well
as local dendritic cells activated by PAMPs) also produce
cytokines that stimulate the B cells to produce IgA, the class
of antibodies most effective in protecting against mucosal
infections (see Chapter 13).
Enzymes: iNOS and COX2
Among other genes activated in many cell types by PRRactivated signaling pathways are those for two enzymes that
contribute importantly to the generation of antimicrobial
and proinflammatory mediators: inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and cyclooxygenase 2 (COX2). As described
earlier, the iNOS enzyme catalyzes an important step in the
formation of nitric oxide, which kills phagocytosed microbes
(see Figure 5-8). COX2, whose synthesis is induced by PRR
activation in monocytes, macrophages, neutrophils, and
mast cells, is key to converting the lipid intermediate arachidonic acid to prostaglandins, potent proinflammatory
mediators. The next section provides an overview of the
main processes of inflammatory responses initiated by
innate immune responses. Inflammation will be covered in
more detail in Chapter 15.

Inflammatory Responses
When the outer barriers of innate immunity—skin and
other epithelial layers—are damaged, the resulting innate
responses to infection or tissue injury can induce a complex
cascade of events known as the inflammatory response.
Inflammation may be acute (short-term effects contributing
to combating infection, followed by healing)—for example,
in response to local tissue damage—or it may be chronic
(long term, not resolved), contributing to conditions such as
arthritis, inflammatory bowel disease, cardiovascular disease, and Type 2 diabetes.
The hallmarks of a localized inflammatory response were
first described by the Roman physician Celsus in the first
century AD as rubor et tumor cum calore et dolore (redness
and swelling with heat and pain). An additional mark of
inflammation added in the second century by the physician
Galen is loss of function ( functio laesa). Today we know that

Innate Immunity
these symptoms reflect an increase in vascular diameter
(vasodilation), resulting in a rise of blood volume in the area.
Higher blood volume heats the tissue and causes it to redden. Vascular permeability also increases, leading to leakage
of fluid from the blood vessels, resulting in an accumulation
of fluid (edema) that swells the tissue. Within a few hours,
leukocytes also enter the tissue from the local blood vessels.
These hallmark features of inflammatory responses reflect
the activation of resident tissue cells—macrophages, mast
cells, and dendritic cells—by PAMPs and DAMPs to release
chemokines, cytokines, and other soluble mediators into the
vicinity of the infection or wound. Recruited leukocytes are
activated to phagocytose bacteria and debris and to amplify
the response by producing additional mediators. Resolution
of this acute inflammatory response includes the clearance
of invading pathogens, dead cells, and damaged tissue; the
activation of the systemic acute phase response and additional physiological responses, including the initiation of
wound healing; and the induction of adaptive immune
responses. However, if the infection or tissue damage is not
resolved, it can lead to a chronic inflammatory state that can
cause more local tissue damage and potentially have systemic consequences for the affected individual.

Inflammation Results from Innate Responses
Triggered by Infection, Tissue Damage,
or Harmful Substances
When there is local infection, tissue damage, or exposure to
some harmful substances (such as asbestos or silica crystals
in the lungs), sentinel cells residing in the epithelial layer—
macrophages, mast cells, and dendritic cells—are activated
by PAMPs, DAMPs, crystals, and so on to start phagocytosing the offending invaders (Figure 5-17). The cells are also
activated to release innate immunity mediators that trigger a
series of processes that collectively constitute the inflammatory response.
The recruitment of various leukocyte populations to the
site of infection or damage is a critical early component of
inflammatory responses. PRR signaling activates resident
macrophages, dendritic cells, and mast cells to release the
initial components of cellular innate immune responses,
including the proinflammatory cytokines TNF-, IL-1, and
IL-6; chemokines; prostaglandins (following the induced
expression of the COX2 enzyme); and histamine and other
mediators released by mast cells. These factors act on the
vascular endothelial cells of local blood vessels, increasing

Innate Immunity

vascular permeability and the expression of cell adhesion
molecules (CAMs) and chemokines such as IL-8. The
affected epithelium is said to be inflamed or activated. Cells
flowing through the local capillaries are induced by chemoattractants and adhesion molecule interactions to adhere to
vascular endothelial cells in the inflamed region and pass
through the walls of capillaries and into the tissue spaces, a
process called extravasation that will be described in detail
in Chapter 14. Neutrophils are the first to be recruited to a
site of infection where they enhance local innate responses,
followed by monocytes that differentiate into macrophages
that participate in pathogen clearance and help initiate
wound healing.
In addition to these key events at the site of infection or
damage, the key cytokines made early in response to innate
and inflammatory stimuli—TNF-, IL-1, and IL-6—also
have systemic effects, which will be described in more detail
in Chapter 15. They induce fever (a protective response, as
elevated body temperature inhibits replication of some
pathogens) by inducing COX-2 expression, which activates
prostaglandin synthesis, as mentioned above. Prostaglandin
E2 (PGE2) acts on the hypothalamus (the brain center controlling body temperature), causing fever. These three proinflammatory cytokines also act on the liver, inducing the
acute phase response, which contributes to the resolution of
the inflammatory response.

Proteins of the Acute Phase Response Contribute
to Innate Immunity and Inflammation
During the 1920s and 1930s, before the introduction of antibiotics, much attention was given to controlling pneumococcal pneumonia. Researchers noted changes in the
concentration of several serum proteins during the acute
phase of the disease, the phase preceding recovery or death.
The serum changes were collectively called the acute phase
response (APR), and the proteins whose concentrations rise
during the acute phase are still called acute phase response
proteins (APR proteins). The physiological significance of
some APR proteins is still not understood, but we now know
that some contribute to the innate immune response to
infection.
The acute phase response (discussed more fully in
Chapter 15) is induced by signals that travel through the
blood from sites of injury or infection. The proinflammatory
cytokines TNF-, IL-1, and IL-6 are the major signals
responsible for induction of the acute phase response; they
act on hepatocytes in the liver, inducing them to secrete APR
proteins at higher levels. Among APR proteins are many
components of the complement system, which contribute to
both innate and adaptive immune responses, and other proteins that function as opsonins, enhancing phagocytosis (see
Table 5-3). As was mentioned briefly earlier and will be
described in more detail in Chapter 6, complement components and fragments contribute to pathogen inactivation and
clearance in a variety of ways, including serving as opsonins.

Several other proteins are produced at higher levels during the APR. Mannose-binding lectin (MBL), described
earlier, is a collectin that recognizes mannose-containing
molecular patterns on microbes and promotes phagocytosis
by blood monocytes. When MBL binds to the surface of
microorganisms it also initiates complement activation (see
Chapter 6). Another important APR made in the liver is
C-reactive protein (CRP), which belongs to a family of pentameric proteins called pentraxins that bind ligands in a
calcium-dependent reaction. Among the ligands recognized
by CRP are a polysaccharide found on the surface of pneumococcal bacteria and phosphorylcholine, which is present
on the surface of many microbes. CRP is an opsonin and
also activates a complement-mediated attack on the microbe.
Circulating CRP levels are considered an indicator of the
level of ongoing inflammation. Two other pentraxins, serum
amyloid protein and PTX, similarly function as both opsonins and activators of the complement pathway. Also released
into the blood at higher levels are the surfactant protein
opsonins SP-A and SP-D, mentioned earlier as providing
protection against lung infections, and a number of proteins
that participate in or regulate the coagulation (clotting)
pathway, such as fibrinogen. While most of these APR proteins are always present in the blood at low levels, their
increased concentrations during the acute phase response
provide enhanced protective functions during infections.
With the combined defenses mounted by innate and
inflammatory responses, together with those of the laterarising adaptive immune responses, most infections are
eliminated. Immune and inflammatory responses generally
are self-limiting, so once the pathogen and damaged tissue
are cleared, inflammation usually diminishes and the tissues
heal. However, persistence of pathogens (e.g., in tuberculosis) or other harmful substances (e.g., monosodium urate
crystals in gout) can cause chronic inflammation and continuing tissue damage and illness.

Natural Killer Cells
In addition to the mechanisms of innate immunity described
above, which largely are the responsibility of nonlymphoid
cell types, a population of lymphocytes also recognizes components associated with pathogens, damage, or stress and
generates rapid protective responses. Natural killer (NK)
cells constitute a third branch of lymphoid cells, along with
B and T lymphocytes of the adaptive immune system, all differentiating from the common lymphoid progenitor into
three separate lineages (see Chapter 2). Unlike B and T lymphocytes, whose receptors have tremendous diversity for
foreign antigens, NK cells express a limited set of invariant,
nonrearranging receptors that enable the cells to be activated
by indicators of infection, cancer, or damage that are
expressed by other cells. Again unlike B and T cells, which
require days of activation, proliferation, and differentiation
to generate their protective antibody and cell-mediated

c05InnateImmunity.indd Page 169 12/19/12 11:54 PM user-t044

/Volumes/203/MHR00209/siL52070/disk1of1/0071052070

Innate Immunity
immune responses, NK cells are preprogrammed to respond
immediately to appropriate stimuli, releasing from preformed secretory granules effector proteins that kill altered
cells by inducing apoptosis. This mechanism of cell-mediated
cytotoxicity is also carried out by cytotoxic T cells, which
appear days later (see Chapter 13). NK-cell-mediated cytotoxic activity is enhanced by IFN- produced early during
virus infections, an example of positive feedback regulation
in innate immunity. In addition to releasing cytotoxic mediators, activated NK cells also secrete cytokines—the proinflammatory cytokines IL-6 and TNF-, as well as Type I
IFNs and the Type II IFN, IFN-, a potent macrophage activator that also helps to activate and shape the adaptive
response. Thus, along with the Type I IFNs produced by virusinfected cells or induced during innate responses by viral
PAMPs, NK cells are an important part of the early innate
response to viral infections (as well as to malignancy and
other indicators of danger). These early innate responses control the infection for the days to week it takes for the adaptive
response (antibodies and cytotoxic T cells) to be generated.
How do NK cells sense that our cells have become
infected, malignant, or potentially harmful in other ways? As
will be described more fully in Chapter 13, NK cells express
a variety of novel receptors (collectively called NK receptors). Members of one group serve as activating receptors (of
which more than 20 have been described in humans and
mice) that have specificity for various cell surface ligands
that serve as indicators of infection, cancer, or stress. While
one of these activating ligands in mice has been shown to be
a protein component of a virus (mouse cytomegalovirus),
most NK activating receptors apparently have specificity not
for a pathogen-associated component but for proteins specifically up-regulated on infected, malignant, or stressed
cells, which serve as danger signals perceived by NK cells.
NK cells also express TLRs, and binding of PAMPs or
DAMPs can add to the activation signals.
As will be described later, to limit potential killing of normal cells in our body, NK cells also express inhibitory receptors that recognize membrane proteins (usually conventional
MHC proteins) on normal healthy cells and inhibit NK-cellmediated cytotoxic killing of those cells. Many virus-infected
or tumor cells lose expression of their MHC proteins and
thus do not send these inhibitory signals. Receiving an
excess of activating signals compared to inhibitory signals
tells an NK cell that a target cell is abnormal, and the NK cell
is activated to kill the target cell. Thus NK cells are part of
our innate sensing mechanisms that provide immediate protection, in this case recognizing and eliminating our own
body’s cells that have become harmful. Recent studies suggest that initial activation increases the population and/or
activity of responding NK cells, which therefore would generate a greater response when exposed later to the same
activating ligand(s). This resembles the immunological
memory in the adaptive immune system and represents the
best example of immunological memory in the vertebrate
innate immune system.

Regulation and Evasion of Innate
and Inflammatory Responses
Innate immune responses and the inflammatory responses
they induce play key roles in clearing infections and healing
infected or damaged tissues. The importance of some of the
individual molecules involved in the generation of innate
and inflammatory responses is dramatically demonstrated
by the impact on human health of genetic defects and polymorphisms (genetic variants) that alter the expression or
function of these molecules. Some of these defects and their
clinical consequences are described in Clinical Focus box 5-2.
As illustrated by these conditions, and by the many known
roles (cited throughout this chapter) of innate and inflammatory mechanisms in protecting us against pathogens,
these responses are essential to keeping us healthy. However,
some other disorders show that innate and inflammatory
responses can also be harmful, in that overproduction of
various normally beneficial mediators and uncontrolled
local or systemic responses can cause illness and even death.
Therefore it is important that the occurrence and extent of
innate and inflammatory responses be carefully regulated to
optimize the beneficial responses and minimize the harmful
responses.

Innate and Inflammatory Responses
Can Be Harmful
To be optimally effective in keeping us healthy, innate and
inflammatory responses should use their destructive mechanisms to eliminate pathogens and other harmful substances
quickly and efficiently, without causing tissue damage or
inhibiting the normal functioning of the body’s systems. However, this does not always occur—a variety of conditions result
from excessive or chronic innate and inflammatory responses.
The most dangerous of these conditions is sepsis, a systemic response to infection that includes fever, elevated
heartbeat and breathing rate, low blood pressure, and compromised organ function due to circulatory defects. Several
hundred thousand cases of sepsis occur annually in the
United States, and mortality rates range from 20% to 50%,
but sepsis can lead to septic shock, circulatory and respiratory collapse that has a 90% mortality rate. Sepsis results
from septicemia, infections of the blood, in particular those
involving Gram-negative bacteria such as Salmonella,
although other pathogens can also cause sepsis.
The major cause of sepsis from Gram-negative bacteria is
the cell wall component LPS (also known as endotoxin),
which as we learned earlier is a ligand of TLR4. As we have
seen, LPS is a highly potent activator of innate immune
mediators, including the proinflammatory cytokines TNF-,
IL-1, and IL-6; chemokines; and antimicrobial components.
Systemic infections activate blood cells including monocytes
and neutrophils, vascular endothelial cells, and resident
macrophages and other cells in the spleen, liver, and other

CLINICAL FOCUS

Genetic Defects in Components of Innate and Inflammatory
Responses Associated with Disease
In combination with our rapidly
expanding understanding of the mechanisms by which innate and inflammatory
responses contribute to disease susceptibility and resistance, in recent years advances
in human genetics have helped to identify
a number of genetic defects that confer
greater susceptibility to infectious and
inflammatory diseases. The adverse effects
of mutations in genes encoding essential
components of innate and inflammatory
processes highlight the critical roles of
these proteins in keeping us healthy.
Since 2003, when the first mutations in
innate immune components that predispose individuals to recurrent bacterial
infections were discovered, a number of
mutations interfering with the generation
of protective innate immune responses
have been identified. Two examples were
mentioned earlier in this chapter: defects
in NADPH oxidase, which cause chronic
granulomatous disease, and MBL deficiencies, which predispose to respiratory
infections. Also leading to defects in
innate immunity are mutations in two
proteins—MyD88 and IRAK4—required
for the MyD88-dependent signaling pathway downstream of all TLRs except TLR3
(see Figure 5-13). Children with these
defects suffer from severe invasive S.
pneumococcus infections, some fatal, and

are also susceptible to Staphylococcus
aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (Figure 1a). The MyD88 mutations completely
prevent cytokine and chemokine induction by ligands for TLRs 2/1, 2/6, 5, 7, and
8. Not surprisingly, the effects of these
mutations are less significant for TLR3
(which activates TRIF signaling pathways
instead of MyD88) and TLR4 (which activates both MyD88 and TRIF signaling
pathways). That the MyD88 mutations do
not leave these children more susceptible
to a wider variety of pathogens probably
reflects the induction of protective immunity by other PRRs as well as by the adaptive immune system. In fact, the children
become less susceptible to infections as
they get older (see Figure 1b), consistent
with the buildup of adaptive immunological memory to these pathogens.
Other genetic defects with clinical consequences have been identified in the
pathways by which Type 1 interferons (IFN,) are induced by viral nucleic acid
PAMPs and then block virus replication in
infected cells. As highlighted in Figure 2,
mutations that completely or partially
block these pathways (red symbols) have
been found in TLR3 and other components
of the pathway that induce IFN-,. Mutations have also been found in TYK2 and
STAT1, key components that activate the

antiviral effects of the interferons in
infected cells. Interestingly, these mutations were all discovered in children presenting with herpes simplex virus (HSV)
encephalopathy, a severe HSV infection of
the central nervous system. Cells in the
CNS express TLR3, and it may be that the
mutations in these pathways severely disable innate responses that are critical to
protection against CNS infection by this
virus. Children with TYK2 and STAT1 mutations are also very susceptible to other
infections, especially with mycobacteria,
probably because macrophages must be
activated by IFN- (which also utilizes TYK2
and STAT1 in its signaling pathway) to be
able to kill these intracellular bacteria.
The final set of genetic defects associated with disease states to be discussed
here involves the effects of genetic variants in NLRs (including inflammasomes) in
promoting inflammatory diseases.
Genome-wide genetic association studies
have indicated that a number of allelic
variants of TLRs and NLRs are associated
with inflammatory disorders. Several variants are associated with inflammatory
bowel disease, which includes ulcerative
colitis and Crohn’s disease. The most
impressive genetic association was of
Crohn’s disease with mutations in NOD2 in
or near its ligand-binding LRR region. As

associated with greater susceptibility to viral diseases are shown in red.
Viruses are taken up by dendritic cells via specific receptors, and viral
nucleic acids are detected by the various TLRs expressed in endosomes. Transport to endosomes of TLRs 3, 7, 8, and 9 is dependent on
the ER protein UNC93B. Cytoplasmic signaling components activate

NOD2 is activated by bacterial cell wall
fragments, investigators have hypothesized that intestinal epithelial cells with the
mutant NOD2 PRRs are unable to activate
adequate protective responses to gut bacteria and/or to maintain appropriate balance between normal commensals and
pathogenic bacteria, and that these defective innate immune functions contribute
to Crohn’s disease pathogenesis. Consistent with this hypothesis, recent studies
have found that intestinal Paneth cells
from NOD2-defective individuals secrete
reduced amounts of -defensins which, as
mentioned earlier, are essential for maintaining normal commensal gut flora.
Genetic variants of the NLRP3 inflammasome have also been shown to be

transcription factors, including IRFs and NF-B, leading to synthesis and
secretion of IFN-,. TLR3, UNC93B, TRAF3, and NEMO deficiencies are
associated with impaired IFN production, particularly during herpesvirus
infection. The binding of IFN-, to their receptor induces the phosphorylation of JAK1 and TYK-2, activating the signal transduction proteins
STAT-1, STAT-2, and IRF9. This complex translocates as a heterotrimer to
the nucleus, where it acts as a transcriptional activator, binding to specific
DNA response elements in the promoter region of IFN-inducible genes.
TYK-2 and STAT-1 deficiencies are associated with impaired IFN responses.

associated with Crohn’s disease and other
inflammatory disorders. In fact, mutations
in NLRP3 (originally called cryopyrin) have
been show to be responsible for a set of
autoinflammatory diseases (i.e., noninfectious inflammatory diseases affecting the
body’s tissues) collectively known as CAPS
(for cryopyrin-associated periodic fever
syndromes); one example is NOMID (neonatal onset multisystem inflammatory disorder). These devastating syndromes
include many signs of systemic inflammation, including fever, rashes, arthritis, pain,
and inflammation affecting the nervous
system, with adverse effects on vision and
hearing.
More than 70 inherited and novel
mutations in NLRP3 associated with

CAPS have been identified. Most are in
the NRLP3 NBD domain, though some
are in the LRR domain. What many have
in common is their deregulating effect
on NLRP3 activation of caspase-1, which
may become constitutively active. Cells
from NOMID patients have recently
been shown to secrete higher levels of
IL-1 and IL-18, both spontaneously and
induced by PAMPs and DAMPs, promoting chronic inflammation. Another consequence of constitutive NLRP3
activation is the death of the activated
cells, releasing DAMPs that lead to more
inflammation. Fortunately, new therapeutic approaches that inhibit IL-1 activity seem to alleviate these symptoms in
some patients.

tissues, to release these soluble mediators. They, in turn,
systemically activate vascular endothelial cells, inducing
them to produce cytokines, chemokines, adhesion molecules, and clotting factors that amplify the inflammatory
response. Enzymes and reactive oxidative species released by
activated neutrophils and other cells damage the vasculature;
this damage, together with TNF--induced vasodilation and
increased vascular permeability, results in fluid loss into the
tissues that lowers blood pressure. TNF also stimulates
release of clotting factors by vascular endothelial cells,
resulting in blood clotting in capillaries. These effects on the
blood vessels are particularly damaging to the kidneys and
lungs, which are highly vascularized. High circulating
TNF- and IL-1 levels also adversely affect the heart. Thus
the systemic inflammatory response triggered by septicemia
can lead to circulatory and respiratory failure, resulting in
shock and death. As high levels of circulating TNF-, IL-1,
and IL-6 are highly correlated with morbidity, considerable
effort is being invested in developing treatments that block
the adverse effects of these normally beneficial molecules.
While not as immediately dangerous as septic shock,
chronic inflammatory responses resulting from ongoing
activation of innate immune responses can have adverse
consequences for our health. For example, a toxin from Helicobacter pylori bacteria damages the stomach by disrupting
the junctions between gastric epithelial cells and also induces
chronic inflammation that has been implicated in peptic
ulcers and stomach cancer. Also, increasing evidence suggests that the noninfectious DAMPs cholesterol (as insoluble
aggregates or crystals) and amyloid  contribute, respectively, to atherosclerosis (hardening of the arteries) and
Alzheimer’s disease. Other examples of harmful sterile
(noninfectious) inflammatory responses discussed earlier—
including gout, asbestosis, silicosis, and aseptic osteolysis—
are induced, respectively, by crystals of monosodium urate,
asbestos, and silica, and by metal alloy particles from artificial joint prostheses. These varied substances are all potent
inflammatory stimuli due to their shared ability to activate
the NLRP3 inflammasome, resulting in the release of the
proinflammatory cytokines IL-1 and IL-18.

Innate and Inflammatory Responses are
Regulated Both Positively and Negatively
As innate immune responses play essential roles in eliminating infections but also can be harmful when not adequately
controlled, it is not surprising that many regulatory processes have evolved that either enhance or inhibit innate and
inflammatory responses. These mechanisms control the
induction, type, and duration of these responses, in most
cases leading to the elimination of an infection without damaging tissues or causing illness.
Positive Feedback Mechanisms
Innate and inflammatory responses are increased by a variety of mechanisms to enhance their protective functions. To

amplify the early stages of protective innate responses, two
of the initial cytokines induced by PAMP or DAMP binding
to PRRs—TNF- and IL-1—activate pathways similar to
those downstream of TLRs (see Chapter 4) and hence induce
more of themselves, an example of positive feedback regulation. In other words, a cell’s response to TNF- or IL-1 signaling can include production of more TNF- and IL-1. In a
parallel fashion, in some cells Type I interferons can signal
cells through the IFNAR receptor to produce more IFN.
Other positive feedback mechanisms triggered by PRR activation include the activation of higher transcription rates of
the genes for some TLRs, for the subunits of NF-B itself,
and for NLRP3 and caspase-1. Collectively the increases in
these proteins amplify IL-1 secretion, as production of IL-1
requires not only the transcription of its gene but also the
processing of its large precursor protein by caspase-1, which
is activated by NLRP3.
Negative Feedback Mechanisms
On the other side of the equation, as uncontrolled innate and
inflammatory responses can have adverse consequences,
many negative feedback mechanisms are activated to limit
these responses. Several proteins whose expression or activity is increased following PRR signaling inhibit steps in the
signaling pathways downstream of PRRs. Examples include
production of a short form of the adaptor MyD88 that inhibits normal MyD88 function, the activation of protein phosphatases that remove key activating phosphate groups on
signaling intermediates, and the increased synthesis of IB,
the inhibitory subunit that keeps NF-B in the cytoplasm.
The activation of these and other intracellular negative feedback mechanisms can lead cells to become less responsive,
limiting the extent of the innate immune response. In a wellstudied example, when macrophages are exposed continually to the TLR4 ligand LPS, their initial production of
antimicrobial and proinflammatory mediators is followed by
the induction of inhibitors (including IB and the short
form of MyD88) that block the macrophages from continuing to respond to LPS. This state of unresponsiveness, called
LPS tolerance (or endotoxin tolerance), reduces the possibility that continued exposure to LPS from a bacterial infection will cause septic shock.
Other feedback pathways inhibit the inflammatory effects
of TNF- and IL-1. Each induces production of a soluble
version of its receptor or a receptor-like protein that binds
the circulating cytokine molecules (see Chapter 4), preventing them from acting on other cells. In addition, the antiinflammatory cytokine IL-10 is produced late in the
macrophage response to PAMPs; it inhibits the production
and effects of inflammatory cytokines and promotes wound
healing. Another anti-inflammatory cytokine, TGF-, is also
produced by macrophages, dendritic cells, and other cells,
especially after PRR activation by apoptotic cells. The inhibitory effects of TGF- reduce the likelihood that DAMPs
released by cells undergoing apoptosis will induce inflammatory responses. As a final example of a negative feedback

Helicobacter, Coxiella, and Legionella bacteria have altered LPS that is

HTLV-1 virus p30 protein inhibits transcription and expression of TLR4.
Several viruses (Ebola, influenza, Vaccinia) encode proteins that bind
cytosolic viral dsRNA and prevent it from binding and activating RLR.

Vaccinia virus protein A46R and several bacterial proteins have TIR

Several viruses block TBK1/IKK-activation of IRF3 and IRF7, required
for IFN production.
West Nile Virus NS1 protein inhibits NF-B and IRF transport into

loop, levels of circulating TNF- and IL-1 that could potentially induce harmful inflammatory responses act via the
hypothalamus to induce the adrenal medulla to secrete
glucocorticoid hormones, which have a variety of potent
anti-inflammatory effects, including inhibiting the production of TNF- and IL-1 themselves.

Pathogens Have Evolved Mechanisms to Evade
Innate and Inflammatory Responses
As it is advantageous to pathogens to evolve mechanisms
that allow them to evade elimination by the immune system,
many have acquired the ability to inhibit various innate and
inflammatory signaling pathways and effector mechanisms
that would clear them from the body. Most bacteria, viruses,
and fungi replicate at high rates and, through mutation, may
alter their components to avoid recognition or elimination
by innate immune effector mechanisms. Other pathogens
have evolved complex mechanisms that block normally effective
innate clearance mechanisms. A strategy employed especially
by viruses is to acquire genes from their hosts that have
evolved and function as inhibitors of innate and inflammatory
responses. Several strategies by which viruses evade immune
responses triggered by interferons and other cytokines are

listed in Table 4-5. Examples of mechanisms by which
pathogens more generally avoid detection by PRRs, activation of innate and inflammatory responses, or elimination
by those responses are described in Table 5-6.

Interactions Between the Innate
and Adaptive Immune Systems
The many layers of innate immunity are important to our
health, as illustrated by the illnesses seen in individuals lacking one or another component of the innate immune system
(see the Clinical Focus box and other examples mentioned
earlier in this chapter). However, innate immunity is not sufficient to protect us fully from infectious diseases, in part
because many pathogens have features that allow them to
evade innate immune responses, as discussed above. Hence
the antigen-specific responses generated by our powerful
adaptive immune system are usually needed to resolve infections successfully. While our B and T lymphocytes are the
key producers of adaptive response effector mechanisms—
antibodies and cell-mediated immunity—it is becoming
increasingly clear that our innate immune system plays
important roles in helping to initiate and regulate adaptive

Innate Immunity

immune responses so that they will be optimally effective. In
addition, the adaptive immune system has co-opted several
mechanisms by which the innate immune system eliminates
pathogens, modifying them to enable antibodies to clear
pathogens.

The Innate Immune System Activates and
Regulates Adaptive Immune Responses
When pathogens invade our body, usually by penetrating
our epithelial barriers, the innate immune system not only
reacts quickly to begin to clear the invaders but also plays
key roles in activating adaptive immune responses. While
innate cells at the infection site (resident macrophages,
dendritic cells, mast cells, and newly recruited neutrophils)
are sensing the invading pathogens through their pattern
recognition receptors and generating antimicrobial and proinflammatory responses that will slow down the infection,
they are also initiating steps to bring the pathogens to the
attention of lymphocytes and help activate responses that,
days later, will generate the strong antigen-specific antibody
and cell-mediated responses that will resolve the infection.
The first step in the generation of adaptive immune
responses to pathogens is the delivery of the pathogen to
lymphoid tissues where T and B cells can recognize it and
respond. As is discussed in more detail in Chapter 14, dendritic cells (usually immature) that serve as sentinels in epithelial tissues bind microbes through various pattern-recognition
receptors. The dendritic cells carry the bound microbes—
either still attached to the cell surface or in phagosomes—via
the lymphatic vessels to nearby secondary lymphoid tissues,
such as the draining lymph nodes. There the dendritic cells
can transfer or present the microbes or microbial components
to other cells. In many cases the dendritic cell has internalized
and degraded the microbe, and microbe-derived peptides
come to the cell surface bound to its MHC class II proteins.
Meanwhile, the binding of microbial PAMPs to the dendritic
cell’s PRRs also has activated the dendritic cell to mature. It
now expresses higher levels of MHC class II proteins and has
turned on expression of costimulatory membrane proteins,
such as CD80 or CD86 (see Chapter 3), that are recognized by
receptors on TH cells. As a result of these processes of microbe
binding, processing, and maturation, mature dendritic cells
are the most effective antigen-presenting cells, particularly for
the activation of naïve (not previously activated) TH cells.
Pathogen-Specific Activation of TH Cell Subsets
Activation of dendritic cells by binding of various PAMPs to
PRRs has additional important consequences for adaptive
immune responses. Depending on the nature of the pathogen
and what PRRs and downstream signaling pathways are
activated, dendritic cells are induced to secrete specific cytokines that influence what cytokines a naïve TH (CD4	) cell
will produce after activation, thus determining its functional

phenotype (Figure 5-18). These distinct phenotypes, or TH
cell subsets, will be discussed in detail in Chapter 11.
As one example, a Gram-negative bacteria may express
PAMPs that bind to TLR4, TLR5, and/or the endosomal/lysosomal TLRs that bind bacterial nucleic acids. This binding
stimulates dendritic cells to produce IL-12, which induces naïve
TH cells to become TH1 cells (see Chapter 4). The hallmark
cytokine of TH1 cells is IFN-, which activates macrophages to
kill intracellular bacteria, reinforces the TH1 phenotype, contributes to the activation of virus-specific cytotoxic T cells, and,
along with IL-2 (another TH1 cytokine), helps to activate B cells.
In contrast, binding of PAMPs from fungi, Gram-positive
bacteria, or helminths to TLR 2/1 or 2/6 activates production
of IL-10 and inhibits secretion of IL-12. This combination of
effects of stimulation through TLR2-containing receptors
supports naïve TH cell differentiation into TH2 cells, which
promote strong antibody responses that are more important
for providing protection against these pathogens than are
cell-mediated responses. Fungal PAMPs bind to the CLR
Dectin-1, which activates the dendritic cell to produce the
proinflammatory cytokines TNF-, IL-6, and IL-23; the latter two induce the TH to become TH17 cells, which are characterized by the secretion of proinflammatory cytokines
such as IL-17 and IL-6. These cytokines help recruit neutrophils to the site, which then phagocytose and kill the fungi.
It is important to recognize that the schematic shown in
Figure 5-18 is oversimplified, as there are many complexities to
the regulation of TH phenotype not shown. For example, IL-4,
a key cytokine for inducing formation of TH2 cells, may be
made by mast cells and/or basophils following PRR activation
by certain pathogens, including helminth worms. The resulting
TH2 cells induce production of IgG and IgE antibodies that are
particularly effective against some of these pathogens.
In summary, through their differential activation of specific
PRRs, various pathogens induce dendritic and other innate
cells to produce cytokines that activate TH cells to acquire distinct cytokine-producing phenotypes. These distinct TH subsets
generally elicit the types of adaptive immune responses that
will be most effective in eliminating the particular pathogen
invaders. The molecular mechanisms by which naïve CD4	
TH cells are influenced to differentiate into various mature
TH subsets will be described in Chapter 11.
Pathogen-Specific Activation of TC Cells
Recent research has also revealed key roles of dendritic cells in
the activation of cytotoxic T-cell-mediated responses that are
needed to kill cells in our body that have become harmful
through infection with viruses or other intracellular pathogens
or through malignant transformation. As was the case with
naïve TH (CD4	) cells, naïve cytotoxic TC (CD8	) cells also are
most effectively activated by mature dendritic cells (see Chapter
13). Again, dendritic cell maturation (also referred to as licensing) is usually induced by the binding of microbial components
to a dendritic cell’s PRRs. These mature/licensed DCs also
are  capable of novel pathways for processing internalized

PRRs influences helper T cell functions. Microbial PAMPs bind
and activate distinct PRRs and signaling pathways that differentially
induce production of various cytokines and other mediators, such as
retinoic acid (RA). These cytokines interact with receptors on naïve
CD4	 T cells that are in the process of being activated both by antigen-derived peptides bound to dendritic cell MHC class II proteins

pathogens so that peptides generated by endosomal/lysosomal
degradation are carried to the cell surface bound to MHC class
I proteins rather than to class II proteins (this process is called
cross-presentation and explained in Chapter 8). These peptide/
MHC class I complexes, together with costimulatory proteins
such as CD80 or CD86 on the surface of the mature/licensed
dendritic cell, activate the naïve TC to give rise to cytotoxic
T effector cells. As was the case with the activation of TH cells,
cytokines such as IL-12 and IFN- produced by innate cells
(dendritic cells, macrophages, NK cells, or other cells) contribute to the differentiation and activation of TC cells.
T-Independent Antigens
In addition to their indirect roles in promoting and regulating antibody and cell-mediated responses via their activation
of DC and other innate cells, described above, TLRs also can
be more directly involved in activating B and T cells. B cells
express TLRs, and the binding of PAMPs to these TLRs activates signaling pathways that can add to or substitute for the
signals from TH cells normally required for B-cell activation.
One example has been well studied in mouse B cells. In
combination with signals from the B cells’ BCR after antigen
binding, TLR4 binding of LPS (at low concentrations) can
activate sufficient signals to induce the B cell to proliferate

and by interactions with costimulatory molecules such as CD80 or
CD86. Note that activation of dendritic cells by PAMP binding to TLRs
stimulates increased expression of MHC class II and costimulatory
proteins. The particular cytokine(s) to which a naïve CD4	 T cell is
exposed induces that cell turn on genes for certain cytokines, determining that cell’s functional phenotype (see text). [Adapted from B.
Pulendran et al. 2010. Nature Immunology 11:647.]

and differentiate into antibody-secreting plasma cells without
TH cells. At high concentrations of LPS, TLR4-activated signals are sufficient to activate all B cells (polyclonal activation),
regardless of their antigen-binding specificity; hence LPS has
for many years been called a T-independent antigen (see
Chapter 12). Human B cells do not express TLR4 and hence
do not respond to LPS; however, they do express TLR9 and
can be activated by microbial CpG DNA. The ability of TLR
signals to replace TH signals is often beneficial; co-binding of
bacteria to both BCR and TLR on a cell may activate that cell
more quickly than if it had to wait for signals from a TH cell.
Some T cells also express TLRs, which similarly function as
costimulatory receptors to enhance protective responses. For
example, mouse CD8	 T cells express TLR2; costimulation of
CD8	 T cells by TLR2 ligands along with TCR recognition of
peptide/MHC class I complexes reduces the T cells’ need for
costimulatory signals provided by dendritic cells and
enhances their proliferation, survival, and functions.

Adjuvants Activate Innate Immune Responses
to Increase the Effectiveness of Immunizations
Given these activating and potentiating effects of PRR ligands
on adaptive immune responses, can they be used to enhance

Innate Immunity

the efficacy of vaccines in promoting protective immunity
against various pathogens? In fact, many of the materials—
known as adjuvants—that have been shown over the years by
trial and error to enhance immune responses in both laboratory animals and humans contain ligands for TLRs or other
PRRs (see Chapter 17). For example, Complete Freund’s Adjuvant, perhaps the most potent adjuvant for immunizations in
experimental animals, is a combination of mineral oil and
killed Mycobacteria. The mineral oil produces a slowly dispersing depot of antigen, a property of many effective adjuvants,
while fragments of the bacteria’s cell wall peptidoglycans serve
as activating PAMPs. Alum (a precipitate of aluminum hydroxide and aluminum phosphate) is used in some human vaccines;
it has recently been shown to activate the NRLP3 inflammasome, thereby enhancing IL-1 and IL-18 secretion and promoting inflammatory processes that enhance adaptive immune
responses. As the responding innate cells do not make IL-12,
immunizations with alum usually lead the activated T cells to
become TH2 cells, which promote strong antibody responses.
While many vaccines consist of killed or inactivated
viruses or bacteria and hence contain their own PAMPS,
which function as built-in adjuvants, some new vaccines
consist of protein antigens that themselves are not very
stimulatory to the immune system. Tumor antigens also tend
to induce weak responses. Hence, considerable effort is being
invested in developing new adjuvants based on current
knowledge about PRRs. LPS is a highly potent adjuvant but
generates too much inflammation to use; less harmful versions of LPS are being developed as potential adjuvants. The
ability of the TLR3 ligand poly I:C (synthetic double-stranded
RNA) to activate innate immunity and initiate inflammatory
responses has inspired clinical trials to test its ability to
enhance the effectiveness of weak vaccines, including antitumor vaccines. Vaccines using the TLR9 ligand CpG DNA
(which mimics bacterial DNA) as an adjuvant are in clinical
trials; there is great interest in CpG DNA as it preferentially
elicits a TH1 response, important for inducing cell-mediated
immunity (see Figure 5-18). Other approaches for generating
an effective vaccine for a pathogen protein include fusing the
protein to a TLR ligand using genetic engineering. For
example, fusions of pathogen proteins to the TLR5 ligand
flagellin are currently being tested. These are all examples of
how our expanding knowledge of the interactions between
the innate and adaptive immune systems may contribute to
the development of more effective vaccines.

Some Pathogen Clearance Mechanisms
are Common to Both Innate and Adaptive
Immune Responses
Adaptive immune responses—antibody responses in particular—have adopted and modified several effector functions
by which the innate immune system eliminates antigen, so
that they are also triggered by antibody binding to antigens.
While some will be discussed in more detail in Chapters 6
and 13, several examples are mentioned briefly here as illus-

trations of important interactions between innate and adaptive immune responses.
As discussed earlier in this chapter, several soluble proteins that recognize microbial surface components—including
SP-A, SP-D, and MBL—function as opsonins; when they are
bound to microbial surfaces they are recognized by receptors
on phagocytes, leading to enhanced phagocytosis. Antibodies
of the IgG and IgA classes also serve as opsonins; after binding to microbial surfaces these antibodies can be recognized
by Fc receptors that are expressed on macrophages and other
leukocytes, triggering phagocytosis (see Chapter 3). One
receptor for IgG Fc regions (FcR), called CD16, is also
expressed on NK cells, where it serves as an activating receptor. Thus, when IgG antibodies bind to foreign antigens on
the cell surfaces (such as viral or tumor antigens), the IgG
antibodies can be recognized by the FcR on the NK cell,
triggering NK-cell-mediated cytotoxic killing of the infected
or malignant cell (see Chapter 13).
Finally, as mentioned earlier and described fully in Chapter 6, the complement pathway can be activated by both
innate and antibody-mediated mechanisms. Components
on microbe surfaces can be directly recognized by soluble
pattern-recognition proteins, including MBL and C-reactive
protein, leading to activation of the complement cascade.
Similarly, when antibodies of the IgM class and certain IgG
subclasses bind microbe surfaces, their Fc regions are recognized by the C1 component of complement, also triggering
the complement cascade. As was shown in Figure 5-7, MBL
and C1 are related structurally. Once the complement pathway is activated by any of these microbe-binding proteins, it
generates a common set of protective activities; various
complement components and fragments promote opsonization, lysis of membrane-bounded microbes, and generation
of fragments that have proinflammatory and chemoattractant activities. Thus, the adaptive immune system makes
good use of mechanisms that initially evolved to contribute
to innate immunity, co-opting them for the elimination of
pathogens.

Ubiquity of Innate Immunity
Determined searches among plant and invertebrate animal
phyla for the signature proteins of the highly efficient adaptive immune system—antibodies, T cell receptors, and MHC
proteins—have failed to find any homologs of these important vertebrate proteins. Yet without them multicellular
organisms have managed to survive for hundreds of millions
of years. The interior spaces of organisms as diverse as the
tomato, fruit fly, and sea squirt (an early chordate, without a
backbone) do not contain unchecked microbial populations.
Careful studies of these and many other representatives of
nonvertebrate phyla have found arrays of well-developed
processes that carry out innate immune responses. The accumulating evidence leads to the conclusion that multiple
immune mechanisms protect all multicellular organisms

from microbial infection and exploitation (Table 5-7). Some
of the innate immune system components occur across the
plant and animal kingdoms. For example, as mentioned
early in this chapter, virtually all plant and animal species,
and even some fungi, have antimicrobial peptides similar to
defensins. Most multicellular organisms have patternrecognition receptors containing leucine-rich repeats
(LRRs), although many organisms also have other families of
PRRs. While the innate immune responses activated by
these receptors in plants and invertebrates show both similarities and differences compared to those of vertebrates,
innate immune response mechanisms are essential for the
health and survival of these varied organisms.

Plants Rely on Innate Immune Responses
to Combat Infections
Despite plants’ tough outer protective barrier layers, such as
bark and cuticle, and the cell walls surrounding each cell,
plants can be infected by a wide variety of bacteria, fungi,
and viruses, all of which must be combated by the plant
innate immune system. Plants do not have phagocytes or
other circulating cells that can be recruited to sites of infection to mount protective responses. Instead, they rely on

local innate immune responses for protection against
infection. As described in Box 5-3, some resemble innate
responses of animals, while others are quite distinct.

Invertebrate and Vertebrate Innate Immune
Responses Show Both Similarities
and Differences
Additional innate immune mechanisms evolved in animals,
and we vertebrates share a number of innate immunity
features with invertebrates. PRRs (including relatives of
Drosophila Toll and vertebrate TLRs) that have specificities
for microbial carbohydrate and peptidoglycan PAMPs are
found in organisms as primitive as sponges. Together with
soluble opsonin proteins (including some related to complement components), some of these early invertebrate PRRs
function in promoting phagocytosis, an early mechanism for
clearing pathogens. Innate signaling has been well studied in
Drosophila, and signaling proteins have been identified in
the flies that are homologous to several of those downstream
of vertebrate TLRs (including MyD88 and IRAK homologs).
A difference is that fly Toll does not bind to PAMPs directly
but is indirectly activated by the soluble protein product of
an enzyme cascade triggered by pathogen binding to soluble

EVOLUTION

Plant Innate Immune Responses
In the plasma membrane
under the cell wall, plant cells express
pattern recognition receptors with LRR
domains reminiscent of animal TLRs.
These PRRs recognize what plant biologists refer to as microbe-associated
molecular patterns (MAMPs), including
bacterial flagellin, a highly conserved
bacterial translation elongation factor,

and various bacterial and fungal cell wall
components (Figure 1). As is true for animal TLRs, some plant PRRs respond to
danger-associated molecular patterns
(DAMPs), which usually are created by
pathogen enzymes that attack and fragment cell wall components. Some bacterial and fungal pathogens directly inject
into plant cells toxin effector proteins

that inhibit signaling through the plasma
membrane PRRs. These toxins are recognized by a distinct class of LRR receptors
in the cytoplasm called R proteins, which,
like animal NLR proteins, have both LRR
and
nucleotide-binding
domain
domains. After ligand binding, plant PRRs

vertebrate cells (plants do not have
NF-B or IRF homologs), triggering
innate responses.
The primary protective innate immune
response mechanisms of plants to infection are the generation of reactive oxygen and nitrogen species, elevation of
internal pH, and induction of a variety of
antimicrobial peptides (including defensins) and antimicrobial enzymes that can
digest the walls of invading fungi (chitin-

ases) or bacteria (-1,3 glucanase). Plants
may also be activated to produce organic
molecules, such as phytoalexins, that
have antibiotic activity. In some cases, the
responses of plants to pathogens even
goes beyond these protective substances
to include structural responses. For example, to limit infection of leaves, PAMP
binding to PRRs induces the epidermal
guard cells that form the openings (stomata) involved in leaf gas exchange to

Tomato

close, preventing further invasion (Figure
2). Other protective mechanisms include
the isolation of cells in the infected area
by strengthening the walls of surrounding noninfected cells and the induced
death (necrosis) of cells in the vicinity of
the infection to prevent the infection
from spreading to the rest of the plant.
Mutations that disrupt any of these processes usually result in loss of the plant’s
resistance to a variety of pathogens.

pattern-recognition proteins. Through this pathway bacterial
and fungal infections lead to the degradation of an IB homolog and activation of NF-B family members, Dif and Dorsal, which induce the production of drosomycin, an insect
defensin, and other antimicrobial peptides. In addition to
these and other pathways activated by PRRs, Drosophila and

other arthropods employ other innate immune strategies,
including the activation of phenoloxidase cascades that result
in melanization—the deposition of a melanin clot around
invading organisms that prevents their spread. Thus invertebrates and vertebrates have common as well as distinct
innate immune response mechanisms.

The receptors of the innate immune system recognize
conserved pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs),
which are molecular motifs found in microbes, and damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) from aging,
damaged, or dead cells. Therefore these receptors are
called pattern-recognition receptors (PRRs).
The epithelial layers that insulate the interior of the body
from outside pathogens—the skin and epithelial layers of
the mucosal tracts and secretory glands—constitute an
anatomical barrier that is highly effective in protecting
against infection. These epithelial layers produce a variety
of protective substances, including acidic pH, enzymes,
binding proteins, and antimicrobial proteins and peptides.
Phagocytosis—engulfment and internalization of particulate materials such as microbes—is mediated by receptors
on phagocytes (monocytes, macrophages, neutrophils,
and dendritic cells) that either directly recognize PAMPs
on the surface of microbes or recognize soluble proteins
(opsonins) that bind to the microbes. PAMP binding triggers microbe uptake into phagosomes, which fuse with
lysosomes or prepackaged granules, leading to their killing through enzymatic degradation, antimicrobial proteins
and peptides, and toxic effects of reactive oxygen species
(ROS) and reactive nitrogen species (RNS).
Families of PRRs (TLRs, CLRs, RLRs, and NLRs) recognize a wide variety of PAMP (and DAMP) ligands and
trigger signaling pathways that activate genes encoding
proteins that contribute to innate and inflammatory
responses.
Vertebrate Toll-like receptors (TLRs, homologous to the
fruit fly Toll receptor) are dimers of chains with extracellular leucine-rich (LRR) domains that bind PAMPs and
DAMPs. Of the 13 TLRs found in mice and humans, some
are on the cell surface, while others are in endosomes and
lysosomes, where each binds PAMPs revealed by the disassembly or degradation of pathogens, such as microbial
nucleic acids.
TLR binding of PAMPs activates signaling pathways; the
particular pathway varies depending on the TLR and the
adaptor protein that binds to its cytoplasmic TIR domain
(either MyD88 or TRIF). The signaling pathways activate
transcription factors NF-B, various interferon regulating
factors (IRFs), and transcription factors (such as AP-1)
downstream of MAP kinase (MAPK) pathways.

C-type lectin receptors (CLRs) comprise a heterogeneous
family of cell surface PRRs that recognize cell wall components, largely sugars and polysaccharides, of bacteria and
fungi. They trigger a variety of distinct signaling pathways
that activate transcription factors, of which some are
similar to those activated by TLRs.
RIG-I-like receptors (RLRs) are RNA helicases that function as cytosolic PRRs. Most PAMPs that they recognize
are viral double-stranded RNAs; after PAMP binding,
RLRs trigger signaling pathways that activate IRFs and
NF-B.
NOD-like receptors (NLRs) are a large family of cytosolic
PRRs activated by intracellular PAMPs, DAMPs, and
other harmful substances. The NOD NLRs bind intracellular microbial components such as cell wall fragments.
Other NLRs, such as NLRP3, function as inflammasomes;
they are activated by a wide variety of PAMPs, DAMPs,
and crystals by sensing changes in the intracellular milieu.
Inflammasomes then activate the caspase-1 protease,
which cleaves the inactive large precursors of the proinflammatory cytokines IL-1 and IL-18, so that active cytokines
can be released from cells.
The signaling pathways downstream of PRRs activate
expression of a variety of genes, including those for antimicrobial peptides, Type 1 interferons (potent antiviral
agents), cytokines (including proinflammatory IL-1,
TNF-, and IL-6), chemokines, and enzymes that help to
generate antimicrobial and inflammatory responses.
Inflammatory responses are activated by the innate
immune response to local infection or tissue damage—in
particular, by the proinflammatory cytokines and certain chemokines that are produced. Key early components of inflammatory responses are increased vascular
permeability, allowing soluble innate mediators to reach
the infected or damaged site, and the recruitment of
neutrophils and other leukocytes from the blood into
the site.
A later component of inflammatory responses is the acute
phase response (APR), induced by certain proinflammatory cytokines (IL-1, TNF-, and IL-6). The APR involves
increased synthesis and secretion by the liver of several
antimicrobial proteins, including MBL, CRP, and complement components, which activate a variety of processes
that contribute to eliminating pathogens.

immune functions. They express a set of activating receptors that recognize surface components of the body’s cells
induced by infection, malignant transformation, or other
stresses. Activated NK cells can kill the altered self cell
and/or produce cytokines that help to induce adaptive
immune responses to the altered cell.
The importance of innate and inflammatory responses is
demonstrated by the impact of a variety of genetic defects
in humans. Defects in PRRs and signaling pathways activating innate responses lead to increased susceptibility to
certain infections, while other defects that constitutively
activate inflammasomes contribute to a variety of inflammatory disorders.
As innate and inflammatory responses can be harmful as
well as helpful, they are highly regulated by positive and
negative feedback pathways.
To escape elimination by innate immune responses,
pathogens have evolved a wide array of strategies to block
antimicrobial responses.
There are many interactions between the innate and adaptive immune systems. The adaptive immune system has

co-opted several pathogen-clearance mechanisms, such as
opsonization and complement activation, so that they
contribute to antibody-mediated pathogen elimination.
■

B cells and some T cells express TLRs, which can serve
as costimulatory receptors. PAMP binding helps activate
these cells to generate adaptive immune responses.
TLRs expressed by NK cells can serve as activating
receptors.

■

Dendritic cells are a key cellular bridge between innate
and adaptive immunity. Microbial components acquired
by dendritic cells via PRR binding during the innate
response are brought from the site of infection to lymph
nodes. Activation of a dendritic cell by PAMPs stimulates
the cell to mature, so that it acquires the abilities to activate naïve T cells to become mature cytotoxic and helper
T cells and to influence the sets of cytokines that the
mature TH will produce.

■

Innate immunity appeared early during the evolution of
multicellular organisms. While TLRs are unique to animals,
PRRs with leucine-rich repeat (LRR) ligand-binding domains
that induce innate immune responses are found in virtually all plants and animals.

ANALYZE THE DATA A variety of studies have shown that hel-

minth worm parasites have developed numerous mechanisms
for inhibiting innate and inflammatory responses that otherwise would contribute to their elimination. One particular
parasite, the filarial nematode Acanthocheilonema viteae, has
been shown to secrete a lipoglycoprotein, ES-62, that inhibits
proinflammatory responses. Based on these initial observations, a group of investigators has been studying how ES-62
achieves this anti-inflammatory effect and whether ES-62
might inhibit the development of septic shock in individuals
with sepsis. Interestingly, they found that ES-62 binds to TLR4
(but not to any other TLR). Based on what you have learned
in this chapter and the information and data provided below
from these investigators’ recent paper (P. Puneet et al., 2011,
Nature Immunology 12:344), answer the following questions.
(Note: The various methods used to obtain the data below are

b. The investigators tested whether ES-62 inhibits the production of proinflammatory mediators by macrophages
from normal people and from patients hospitalized with
sepsis. Shown in panel (a) above are the results with macrophages from patients with sepsis; cells from normal
individuals gave similar results. What effect does ES-62
have on the responses induced by the two PAMPs? Given
that ES-62 binds to TLR4 but not TLR2, what do these
results say about the mechanism of ES-62 inhibition?
The investigators compared the levels of TLR4 and
TLR2 expressed by macrophages and neutrophils from
normal people with those from patients with sepsis. As had
been seen by others, panel (b) shows that cells from patients
with sepsis express higher levels of these TLRs than do cells
from normal individuals. Of what kind of feedback regulation is this an example? Why is this feedback response
normally beneficial in individuals with limited infections
but disadvantageous in individuals with sepsis?

In the same experiment shown in panel (b), some
cells from patients with sepsis were incubated with
ES-62. What effect does ES-62 have on TLR4 expression? on TLR2 expression?
The investigators also looked at the levels of MyD88
in macrophages and neutrophils from sepsis patients
after no exposure or 3 or 6 hours of exposure to ES-62
(panel [c]). What does this Western blot show?
Returning to the initial finding that ES-62 inhibits
the induction of proinflammatory mediators by PAMPs
that activate either TLR4 or TLR2 [panel (a)], how
might that finding be explained by the data shown in
panels (b) and (c) (i.e., the effects of ES-62 on TLR and
MyD88 expression)?
Given these results, do you think injection of ES-62
might be used to cure septic shock once it has occurred?
Do you think ES-62 might prevent septic shock from
occurring in patients with sepsis? Explain your answers.

The Complement System

T

he term complement (spelled with an e) refers to
a set of serum proteins that cooperates with both
the innate and the adaptive immune systems to
eliminate blood and tissue pathogens. Like the
components of the blood clotting system, complement
proteins interact with one another in catalytic cascades.
As mentioned in Chapters 3 and 5, various complement
components bind and opsonize bacteria, rendering them
susceptible to receptor-mediated phagocytosis by
macrophages, which express membrane receptors for
complement proteins. Other complement proteins elicit
inflammatory responses, interface with components of the
adaptive immune system, clear immune complexes from
the serum, and/or eliminate apoptotic cells. Finally, a
Membrane Attack Complex (MAC) assembled from
complement proteins directly kills some pathogens by
creating pores in microbial membranes. The biological
importance of complement is emphasized both by the
pathological consequences of mutations in the genes
encoding complement proteins as well as by the broad
range of strategies that have evolved in microorganisms to
evade it.
Research on complement began in the 1890s when
Jules Bordet at the Institut Pasteur in Paris showed that
sheep antiserum to the bacterium Vibrio cholerae caused
lysis (membrane destruction) of the bacteria, and that
heating the antiserum destroyed its bacteriolytic activity.
Surprisingly, the ability to lyse the bacteria was restored to
the heated serum by adding fresh serum that contained
no antibacterial antibodies. This finding led Bordet to
reason that bacteriolysis required two different
substances: the heat-stable specific antibodies that bound
to the bacterial surface, and a second, heat-labile
(sensitive) component responsible for the lytic activity.
In an effort to purify this second, nonspecific
component, Bordet developed antibodies specific for red
blood cells and used these, along with purified serum
fractions, to identify those fractions that cooperated with
the antibodies to induce lysis of the red blood cells
(hemolysis). The famous immunologist Paul Ehrlich,
working independently in Berlin, carried out similar

experiments and coined the term complement, defining it
as “the activity of blood serum that completes the action
of antibody.”
In the ensuing years, researchers have discovered that
the action of complement is the result of interactions
among a complex group of more than 30 glycoproteins.
Most complement components are synthesized in the liver
by hepatocytes, although some are also produced by other
cell types, including blood monocytes, tissue macrophages,
fibroblasts, and epithelial cells of the gastrointestinal and
genitourinary tracts. Complement components constitute
approximately 15% of the globulin protein fraction in
plasma, and their combined concentration can be as high
as 3 mg/ml. In addition, several of the regulatory
components of the system exist on cell membranes, so the
term complement therefore now embraces glycoproteins
distributed among the blood plasma and cell membranes.
Complement components can be classified into seven
functional categories (Overview Figure 6-1):

complex (MAC). Effector complement proteins can label an
antibody-antigen complex for phagocytosis (opsonins), initiate
inflammation (anaphylatoxins), or bind to a pathogen and nucleate the formation of the MAC. Often, these effectors act through
(6) complement receptors on phagocytic cells, granulocytes, or
erythrocytes. (7) Regulatory proteins limit the effects of complement by promoting their degradation or preventing their binding to host cells.

The Complement System

1.

2.

3.

Initiator complement components. These proteins initiate
their respective complement cascades by binding to particular soluble or membrane-bound molecules. Once bound
to their activating ligand, they undergo conformational
alterations resulting in changes in their biological activity.
The C1q complex, Mannose Binding Lectin (MBL), and the
ficolins are examples of initiator complement components.
Enzymatic mediators. Several complement components,
(e.g., C1r, C1s, MASP2, and factor B) are proteolytic
enzymes that cleave and activate other members of the
complement cascade. Some of these proteases are activated by binding to other macromolecules and undergoing a conformational change. Others are inactive until
cleaved by another protease enzyme and are thus termed
zymogens: proteins that are activated by proteolytic cleavage. The two enzyme complexes that cleave complement
components C3 and C5, respectively, are called the C3
and C5 convertases and occupy places of central importance in the complement cascades.
Membrane-binding components or opsonins. Upon activation of the complement cascade, several proteins are
cleaved into two fragments, each of which then takes on a
particular role. For C3 and C4, the larger fragments, C3b
and C4b, serve as opsonins, enhancing phagocytosis by
binding to microbial cells and serving as binding tags for
phagocytic cells bearing receptors for C3b or C4b. As a
general rule, the larger fragment of a cleaved complement
component is designated with the suffix “b,” and the
smaller with the suffix “a.” However, there is one exception to this rule: the larger, enzymatically active form of
the C2 component is named C2a.

4.

Inflammatory mediators. Some small complement fragments act as inflammatory mediators. These fragments
enhance the blood supply to the area in which they are
released, by binding to receptors on endothelial cells lining the small blood vessels and inducing an increase in
capillary diameter. They also attract other cells to the site
of tissue damage. Because such effects can be harmful in
excess, these fragments are called anaphylatoxins, meaning substances that cause anaphylaxis (“against protection”). Examples include C3a, C5a, and C4a.

5.

Membrane attack proteins. The proteins of the membrane
attack complex (MAC) insert into the cell membranes of
invading microorganisms and punch holes that result in
lysis of the pathogen. The complement components of the
MAC are C5b, C6, C7, C8, and multiple copies of C9.

6.

Complement receptor proteins. Receptor molecules on cell
surfaces bind complement proteins and signal specific cell
functions. For example, some complement receptors such as
CR1 bind to complement components such as C3b on the
surface of pathogens, triggering phagocytosis of the
C3-bound pathogen. Binding of the complement component C5a to C5aR receptors on neutrophils stimulates

|

CHAPTER 6

189

neutrophil degranulation and inflammation. Complement
receptors are named with “R,” such as CR1, CR2, and C5aR.
7.

Regulatory complement components. Host cells are protected from unintended complement-mediated lysis by
the presence of membrane-bound as well as soluble regulatory proteins. These regulatory proteins include factor I,
which degrades C3b, and Protectin, which inhibits the
formation of the MAC on host cells.

This chapter describes the components of the
complement system, their activation via three major
pathways, the effector functions of the molecules of the
complement cascade, as well as their interactions with other
cellular and molecular components of innate and adaptive
immunity. In addition, it addresses the mechanisms that
regulate the activity of these complement components, the
evasive strategies evolved by pathogens to avoid destruction
by complement, and the evolution of the various
complement proteins. This chapter’s Classic Experiment
tells the story of the scientist who discovered the alternative
pathway of complement. In the Clinical Focus segment, we
address various therapies that target elements of the
complement cascades. Finally, an Advances Box describes
some of the many tactics used by Staphylococcus aureus
bacteria to escape complement-mediated destruction.

The Major Pathways of
Complement Activation
Complement components represent some of the most evolutionarily ancient participants in the immune response. As
viruses, parasites, and bacteria have attacked vertebrate
hosts and learned to evade one aspect of the complement
system, alternative pathways have evolved in an endless
dance of microbial attack and host response. In the complex
pathways that follow, we can gain a glimpse of the current
state of what is actually an ongoing evolutionary struggle on
the part of host organisms to combat microbial infection,
while minimizing damage to their own cells.
The major initiation pathways of the complement cascade
are shown in Figure 6-2. Although the initiating event of each of
the three pathways of complement activation is different, they
all converge in the generation of an enzyme complex capable of
cleaving the C3 molecule into two fragments, C3a and C3b. The
enzymes that accomplish this biochemical transformation are
referred to as C3 convertases. As illustrated in Figure 6-2, the
classical and lectin pathways use the dimer C4b2a for their C3
convertase activity, while the alternative pathway uses C3bBb to
achieve the same end; however, the final result is the same: a
dramatic increase in the concentration of C3b, a centrally
located and multifunctional complement protein.
The second set of convertase enzymes of the cascade, C5
convertases, are formed by the addition of a C3b component

FIGURE 6-2 The generation of C3 and C5 convertases by
the three major pathways of complement activation. The
classical pathway is initiated when C1q binds to antigen-antibody
complexes. The antigen is shown here in dark red and the initiating
antibody in green. The C1r enzymatic component of C1 (shown in
blue) is then activated and cleaves C1s, which in turn cleaves C4 to
C4a (an anaphylatoxin, bright red) and C4b. C4b attaches to the
membrane, and binds C2, which is then cleaved by C1s to form C2a
and C2b. (C2b is then acted upon further to become an inflammatory mediator.) C2a remains attached to C4b, forming the classical
pathway C3 convertase (C4b2a). In the lectin pathway, mannosebinding lectin (MBL, green) binds specifically to conserved carbohy-

to the C3 convertases. C5 convertases cleave C5 into the
inflammatory mediator, C5a, and C5b, which is the initiating
factor of the MAC.
We will now describe each of these pathways in more
detail. The proteins involved in each of these pathways are
listed in Table 6-1.

The Classical Pathway Is Initiated
by Antibody Binding
The classical pathway of complement activation is considered part of the adaptive immune response since it begins with
the formation of antigen-antibody complexes. These complexes may be soluble, or they may be formed when an antibody binds to antigenic determinants, or epitopes, situated on
viral, fungal, parasitic, or bacterial cell membranes. Soluble

drate arrays on pathogens, activating the MBL-associated serine
proteases (MASPs, blue). The MASPs cleave C2 and C4 generating the
C3 convertase as in the classical pathway. In the alternative pathway,
C3 undergoes spontaneous hydrolysis to C3(H2O), which binds
serum factor B. On binding to C3(H2O), B is cleaved by serum factor
D, and the resultant C3(H2O)Bb complex forms a fluid phase C3 convertase. Some C3b, released after C3 cleavage by this complex, binds
to microbial surfaces. There, it binds factor B, which is cleaved by
factor D, forming the cell-bound alternative pathway C3 convertase,
C3bBb. This complex is stabilized by properdin. The C5 convertases
are formed by the addition of a C3b fragment to each of the C3
convertases.

antibody-antigen complexes are often referred to as immune
complexes, and only complexes formed by IgM or certain subclasses of IgG antibodies are capable of activating the classical
complement pathway (see Chapter 13). The initial stage of
activation involves the complement components C1, C2, C3,
and C4, which are present in plasma as zymogens.
The formation of an antigen-antibody complex induces
conformational changes in the nonantigen-binding (Fc)
portion of the antibody molecule. This conformational
change exposes a binding site for the C1 component of
complement. In serum, C1 exists as a macromolecular complex consisting of one molecule of C1q and two molecules
each of the serine proteases, C1r and C1s, held together in a
Ca2⫹-stabilized complex (C1qr2s2) (Figure 6-3a). The C1q
molecule itself is composed of 18 polypeptide chains that
associate to form six collagen-like triple helical arms, the tips

FIGURE 6-4 Models of pentameric IgM in planar form (a) and “staple” form (b). Several C1q-binding sites in the Fc region are
accessible in the staple form, whereas none are exposed in the planar form. [From A. Feinstein et al., 1981, Monographs in Allergy 17:28, and 1981, Annals
of the New York Academy of Sciences 190:1104.]

of which bind the CH2 domain of the antigen-bound antibody molecule (Figure 6-3b, c).
Each C1 macromolecular complex must bind by its C1q
globular heads to at least two Fc sites for a stable C1-antibody
interaction to occur. Recall from Chapter 3 that serum IgM
exists as a pentamer of the basic four-chain immunoglobulin structure. Circulating, nonantigen-bound IgM adopts
a planar configuration (Figure 6-4a), in which the C1qbinding sites are not exposed. However, when pentameric
IgM is bound to a multivalent antigen, it undergoes a conformational change, assuming the so-called “staple” configuration (Figure 6-4b), in which at least three binding sites for
C1q are exposed. Thus, an IgM molecule engaged in an
antibody-antigen complex can bind C1q, whereas circulating, nonantigen-bound IgM cannot.
In contrast to pentameric IgM, monomeric IgG contains
only one C1q binding site per molecule, and the conformational changes IgG undergoes on antigen binding are much
more subtle than those experienced by IgM. There is therefore
a striking difference in the efficiency with which IgM and IgG
are able to activate complement. Less than 10 molecules of
IgM bound to a red blood cell can activate the classical complement pathway and induce lysis, whereas some 1000 molecules of cell-bound IgG are required to ensure the same result.
The intermediates in the classical activation pathway are
depicted schematically in Figure 6-5. Proteins of the classical
pathway are numbered in the order in which the proteins
were discovered, which does not quite correspond with the
order in which the proteins act in the pathway (a disconnect
that has troubled generations of immunology students).
Note that binding of one component to the next always
induces either a conformational change or an enzymatic
cleavage, which allows for the next reaction in the sequence
to occur.

Binding of C1q to the CH2 domains of the Fc regions of
the antigen-complexed antibody molecule induces a conformational change in one of the C1r molecules that converts it
to an active serine protease enzyme. This C1r molecule then
cleaves and activates its partner C1r molecule. The two C1r
proteases then cleave and activate the two C1s molecules
(see Figure 6-5, part 1).
C1s has two substrates, C4 and C2. C4 is activated when
C1s hydrolyzes a small fragment (C4a) from the amino terminus of one of its chains (see Figure 6-5, part 2). The C4b
fragment attaches covalently to the target membrane surface
in the vicinity of C1, and then binds C2. C4b binding to the
membrane occurs when an unstable, internal thioester on
C4b, exposed upon C4 cleavage, reacts with hydroxyl or
amino groups of proteins or carbohydrates on the cell membrane. This reaction must occur quickly, otherwise the
thioester C4b is further hydrolyzed and can no longer make a
covalent bond with the cell surface (Figure 6-6). Approximately
90% of C4b is hydrolyzed before it can bind the cell surface.
On binding C4b, C2 becomes susceptible to cleavage by
the neighboring C1s enzyme, and the smaller C2b fragment
diffuses away, leaving behind an enzymatically active C4b2a
complex. In this complex, C2a is the enzymatically active
fragment, but it is only active when bound by C4b. This
C4b2a complex is called C3 convertase, referring to its role
in converting C3 into an active form. The smaller fragment
generated by C4 cleavage, C4a, is an anaphylatoxin, and its
function is described below.
The membrane-bound C3 convertase enzyme, C4b2a,
now hydrolyzes C3, generating two unequal fragments; the
small anaphylatoxin C3a and the pivotal fragment C3b. A
single C3 convertase molecule can generate over 200 molecules of C3b, resulting in tremendous amplification at this
step of the classical pathway.

The generation of C3b is centrally important to many of
the actions of complement. Deficiencies of complement
components that act prior to C3 cleavage leave the host
extremely vulnerable to both infectious and autoimmune
diseases, whereas deficiencies of components later in the
pathway are generally of lesser consequence. This is because
C3b acts in three important and different ways to protect the
host.

First, in a manner very similar to that of C4b, C3b binds
covalently to microbial surfaces, providing a molecular “tag”
and thereby allowing phagocytic cells with C3b receptors to
engulf the tagged microbes. This process is called opsonization. Second, C3b molecules can attach to the Fc portions of
antibodies participating in soluble antigen-antibody complexes. These C3b-tagged immune complexes are bound by
C3b receptors on phagocytes or red blood cells, and are

either phagocytosed, or conveyed to the liver where they are
destroyed.
Finally, some molecules of C3b bind the membranelocalized C4b2a enzyme to form the trimolecular, membranebound, C5 convertase complex C4b2a3b. The C3b component
of this complex binds C5, and the complex then cleaves C5
into the two fragments: C5b and C5a (see Figure 6-5 part 4).
C4b2a3b is therefore the C5 convertase of the classical pathway. This trio of tasks accomplished by the C3b molecule
places it right at the center of complement attack pathways.
As we will see, C5b goes on to form the MAC with C6, C7,

dimensional array. Thus, one can think of MBL as a classic
pattern recognition receptor (see Chapter 5). Consistent
with MBL’s place at the beginning of an important immune
cascade, many individuals with low levels of MBL suffer
from repeated, serious bacterial infections.
MBL is constitutively expressed by the liver and, like C1q,
which it structurally resembles, MBL belongs to the subclass
of lectins known as collectins (see Chapter 5). More recently,

The Lectin Pathway Is Initiated When Soluble
Proteins Recognize Microbial Antigens
The lectin pathway, like the classical pathway, proceeds
through the activation of a C3 convertase composed of C4b
and C2a. However, instead of relying on antibodies to recognize the microbial threat and to initiate the complement
activation process, this pathway uses lectins—proteins that
recognize specific carbohydrate components primarily
found on microbial surfaces—as its specific receptor molecules (Figure 6-7; see also Figure 5-7a). Mannose-binding
lectin (MBL), the first lectin demonstrated to be capable of
initiating complement activation, binds close-knit arrays of
mannose residues that are found on microbial surfaces such
as those of Salmonella, Listeria, and Neisseria strains of bacteria; Cryptococcus neoformans and Candida albicans strains
of fungi; and even the membranes of some viruses such as
HIV-1 and respiratory syncytial virus. The complement
pathway that it initiates is referred to as the lectin pathway
of complement activation.
Further characterization of the sugars recognized by MBL
demonstrated that MBL also recognizes structures in addition to mannose, including N-acetyl glucosamine, D-glucose,
and L-fucose. All those sugars, including mannose, present
their associated hydroxyl groups in a particular three-

carbohydrates. Once attached to the carbohydrates, they bind the
MASP family serine proteases, which cleave C2 and C4 with the formation of a lectin-pathway C3 convertase.

the ficolins (see Chapter 5), another family of proteins structurally related to the collectins, have been recognized as
additional initiators of the lectin pathway of complement
activation. L-ficolin, H-ficolin, and M-ficolin each bind specific types of carbohydrates on microbial surfaces. We will
use MBL as our example in subsequent paragraphs.
MBL is associated in the serum with MBL-Associated Serine Proteases, or MASP proteins. Three MASP proteins—
MASP1, MASP2, and MASP3—have been identified, but most
studies of MASP function point to the MASP2 protein as being
the most important actor in the next step of the MBL pathway.
MASP-2 is structurally related to the serine protease C1s,
and can cleave both C2 and C4 (see Figure 6-2), giving rise to
the C3 convertase, C4b2a, that we first encountered in our
discussion of the classical pathway. Thus, the lectin pathway
utilizes all the same components as the classical pathway with
the single exception of the C1 complex. The soluble lectin
receptor replaces the antibody as the antigen-recognizing component, and MASP proteins take the place of C1r and C1s in
cleaving and activating the C3 convertase. Once the C3 convertase is formed, the reactions of the lectin pathway are the same
as for the classical pathway; the C5 convertase of the lectin
pathway, like that of the classical pathway, is also C4b2a3b.

binds another serum protein, factor B (Figure 6-8a). When
bound to C3(H2O), factor B becomes susceptible to cleavage
by a serum protease, factor D. Factor D cleaves B, releasing a
smaller Ba subunit, which diffuses away and leaves a catalytically active Bb subunit that remains bound to C3(H2O).
This C3(H2O)Bb complex, which at this point is still in
the fluid phase (i.e., in the plasma, not bound to any cells),
has C3 convertase activity. It rapidly cleaves many molecules
of C3 into C3a and C3b (Figure 6-8b). This initiating C3
convertase is constantly being formed in plasma, and breaking down a few C3 molecules, but it is then just as rapidly
degraded. However, if there is an infection present, some of

Initiation of the alternative pathway of complement activation is independent of antibody-antigen interactions, and so
this pathway, like the lectin pathway, is also considered to be
part of the innate immune system. However, unlike the lectin
pathway, the alternative pathway uses its own set of C3 and C5
convertases (see Figure 6-2). As we will see, the alternative pathway C3 convertase is made up of one molecule of C3b and one
molecule unique to the alternative pathway, Bb. A second C3b
is then added to make the alternative pathway C5 convertase.
Recent investigations have revealed that the alternative pathway can itself be initiated in three distinct ways. The first mode
of initiation to be discovered, the “tickover” pathway, utilizes the
four serum components C3, factor B, factor D, and properdin
(see Table 6-1). The term tickover refers to the fact that C3 is
constantly being made and spontaneously inactivated and is
thus undergoing “tickover.” Two additional modes of activation
for the alternative pathway have also been identified: one is
initiated by the protein properdin, and the other by proteases
such as thrombin and kallikrein. The story of the discovery of
properdin is addressed in Classic Experiment Box 6-1.
The Alternative Tickover Pathway
The alternative tickover pathway is initiated when C3, which
is at high concentrations in serum, undergoes spontaneous
hydrolysis at its internal thioester bond, yielding the molecule
C3(H2O). The conformation of C3(H2O) has been demonstrated by spectrophotometric means to be different from that
of the parent protein, C3. C3(H2O) accounts for approximately 0.5% of plasma C3 and, in the presence of serum Mg2⫹

C3(H2O) binds factor B in such a way as to make B susceptible to factor D-mediated cleavage. (c) However, membrane-bound C3bBb is
unstable in the absence of properdin (factor P), which binds the
C3bBb complex on the membrane and stabilizes it. Addition of a
second C3b molecule to the C3bBb complex forms the C5 convertase, which is also stabilized by factor P.

the newly formed C3b molecules bind nearby microbial
surfaces via their thioester linkages.
Since factor B is capable of binding to C3b as well as to
C3(H2O), factor B now binds the newly attached C3b molecules on the microbial cell surface (see Figure 6-8b), and
again becomes susceptible to cleavage by factor D, with the
generation of C3bBb complexes. These C3bBb complexes are
now located on the microbial membrane surface. Like the
C4b2a complexes of the classical pathway, the cell-bound
C3bBb complexes have C3 convertase activity, and this complex now takes over from the fluid phase C3(H2O)Bb as the
predominant C3 convertase.
To be clear, there are two C3 convertases in the alternative
tickover pathway: a fluid phase C3(H2O)Bb, which kicks off
the pathway, and a membrane-bound C3bBb C3 convertase.
The cell-bound C3bBb C3 convertase is unstable until it is
bound by properdin, a protein from the serum (Figure 6-8c).
Once stabilized by properdin, these cell-associated, C3bBb C3
convertase complexes rapidly generate large amounts of C3b
at the microbial surface; these, in turn, bind more factor B,
facilitating its cleavage and activation and resulting in a dramatic amplification of the rate of C3b generation. This amplification pathway is rapid and, once the alternative pathway has
been initiated, more than 2 ⫻ 106 molecules of C3b can be
deposited on a microbial surface in less than 5 minutes.
Just as the C5 convertase of the classical and lectin
pathways was formed by the addition of C3b to the C4b2a
C3 convertase complex, so the C5 convertase of the alternative pathway is formed by the addition of C3b to the
alternative pathway C3 convertase complex. The C5 convertase complex therefore has the composition C3bBbC3b,
and, like the C3 convertase, is also stabilized by binding to
factor P. Like the classical and lectin pathway C5 convertase, C3bBbC3b cleaves C5, which goes on to form the
MAC (see Figure 6-8c).
The Alternative Properdin-Activated Pathway
In the previous section, we introduced properdin as a regulatory factor that stabilizes the C3bBb, membrane-bound C3
convertase. However, recent data suggest that, in addition to
stabilizing the ongoing activity of the alternative pathway,
properdin may also serve to initiate it.
In vitro experiments demonstrated that if properdin molecules were attached to an artificial surface and allowed to
interact with purified complement components in the presence of Mg2⫹, the immobilized properdin bound C3b and
factor B (Figure 6-9). This bound factor B proved to be susceptible to cleavage by factor D, and the resultant C3bPBb
complex acted as an effective C3 convertase, leading to the
amplification process discussed above. Thus, it seemed that
properdin could initiate activation of the alternative pathway
on an artificial substrate.
However, proving that a set of reactions can occur in vitro
does not necessarily mean that it actually does occur in vivo.
Investigators next proved properdin’s ability to bind specifically to certain microbes, including Neisseria gonorrhoeae, as

well as to apoptotic and necrotic cell surfaces. Once bound,
properdin was indeed able to initiate the alternative pathway,
as indicated above.
Support for the physiological relevance of this properdininitiated pathway is provided by the observation that patients
with a deficiency in properdin production are uniquely susceptible to meningococcal disease induced by the Neisseria
gonorrhoeae bacterium. These findings suggest that properdin
has the capacity to act as a pattern recognition receptor (PRR),
specifically directing the activation of the alternative pathway
onto the surface of Neisseria and other microbial cells.
Note that this pathway relies on the preexistence of low
levels of C3b, which must be generated by mechanisms such
as the tickover pathway. However, the specific binding of properdin to Neisseria membranes demonstrates how the properdin pathway can provide greater selectivity than that available
from the nonspecific C3b binding of the tickover pathway.
The Alternative Protease-Activated Pathway
The complement and blood-coagulation pathways both use
protease cleavage and conformational alterations to modify
enzyme activities, as well as amplification of various steps of the
pathways by feed-forward loops. Recently, some elegant work
has revealed the existence of functional interactions as well as
theoretical parallels between these two proteolytic cascades.
Several decades ago, it was shown that protein factors
involved in blood clotting, such as thrombin, could cleave the
complement components C3 and C5, in vitro, with the
release of the active anaphylatoxins C3a and C5a. Since these
cleavage reactions required relatively high thrombin concentrations, they were at first thought not to be physiologically
meaningful. More recently, however, it has been demonstrated in a mouse disease model that initiation of the coagulation cascade may result in the cleavage of physiologically
relevant amounts of C3 and C5 to produce C3a and C5a.
Specifically, in an immune-complex model of acute lung
inflammation, thrombin was shown to be capable of cleaving
C5, with the release of active C5a. This thrombin-mediated
C5 cleavage was also demonstrated in C3 knockout mice, in
which the canonical C5 convertases could not possibly have
been generated. Thus, strong inflammatory reactions can
result in the activation of at least a part of the alternative

Innate Immunity

CLASSIC EXPERIMENT

The Discovery of Properdin
The study of the history of science
shows us that scientists, like any other
professionals, are often tempted to think
about problems only in ways that are
already well trodden and familiar. Science,
like art and fashion, has its fads and its “in
crowds.” Indeed, sometimes those whose
work moves in directions too different
from that of the mainstream in their field
have difficulty gaining credibility until the
thinking of the rest of their colleagues
catches up with their own. Such was the
case for Louis Pillemer, the discoverer of
properdin; by the time others in the burgeoning field of immunochemistry appreciated the power of his discovery, it was
quite simply too late.
Louis Pillemer (Figure 1) was born in
1908 in Johannesburg, South Africa. In
1909 the family emigrated to the United
States and settled in Kentucky. Pillemer
completed his bachelor’s degree at Duke
University and started medical school at
the same institution. However, in the middle of his third year, the emotional problems that would plague him for the rest of

his life surfaced for the first time, and he
left. At that time, deep in the Depression,
individuals in Kentucky who could pass an
exam in the rudiments of medical care
were encouraged to care for patients not
otherwise served by a physician. Pillemer
dutifully passed this examination and
began to travel through Kentucky on
horseback, visiting the sick and tendering
whatever treatments were then available.
In 1935, he quit this wandering life and
entered graduate school at what was
then Western Reserve University (now
Case Western Reserve University).
There, Pillemer earned his Ph.D. and,
except for some time at Harvard and a
tour of duty at the Army Medical School in
Washington D.C., he remained at Case
Western Reserve for the rest of his life,
developing a reputation as an excellent
biochemist. Among his more noteworthy
accomplishments were the first purifications of both tetanus and diphtheria toxins, which were used, along with killed
pertussis organisms, in the development
of the standard DPT vaccine.

FIGURE 1
Louis Pillemer, the discoverer of properdin. [Presidential Address to the AAI, 1980, by Lepow; reprinted
in J. Immunol. 125, 471, 1980. Fig.1. 1980. The American Association of Immunologists, Inc.]

After these successes, Pillemer turned
his attention to the biochemistry of the
complement system, which he had initially encountered during his graduate
work. The antibody-mediated classical
pathway had already been established.
However, Pillemer was intrigued by some
more recent experiments that had shown
that mixing human serum with zymosan,
an insoluble carbohydrate extract from
yeast cell walls, at 37⬚C resulted in the
selective loss of the vital third component
of complement, C3. He was curious about
the mechanism of this loss of C3, and initially interpreted the result to suggest that
the C3 was being selectively adsorbed
onto the zymosan surface. He reasoned
that, if this were true, adsorption to zymosan might be used as a method to purify
C3 from plasma. However, that first idea
was proven incorrect, and instead he
began to investigate whether the loss of
C3 resulted from C3 cleavage that was
occurring at the zymosan surface.
Pillemer succeeded in demonstrating
that such was indeed the case and went
on to show that C3 cleavage only happened when his experiments were run at
pH 7.0 and at 37⬚C. This suggested to him
that perhaps an enzyme in the serum
was binding to the zymosan and causing
the inactivation of the C3 component.
Consistent with this hypothesis, when he
mixed the serum and the zymosan at
17⬚C, no cleavage occurred. However, if
he allowed the serum and zymosan to
mix at 17⬚C and then warmed up the
mixture to 37⬚C, the C3 was cleaved as
effectively as if it had been incubated at
37⬚C all along.
Next, he incubated the serum and
zymosan together at 17⬚C, spun down
and removed the zymosan from the mixture, and then added fresh zymosan to
the remaining serum containing the C3.
He then raised the temperature to 37⬚C.
Nothing happened. The C3 was untouched.
Whatever enzymic activity in the serum
was responsible for the breakdown of C3

had been adsorbed by the zymosan and
removed from the serum.
Pillemer concluded that a factor present in serum and adsorbed onto the
zymosan was necessary for the cleavage
of C3. With his students and collaborators,
he purified this component and named it
properdin, from the Latin perdere meaning “to destroy.” His flow sheet for these
initial experiments, and published as part
of his landmark Science paper of 1954, is
shown in Figure 2. He also identified a
heat-labile factor in the serum that was
required for C3 cleavage to occur.
Pillemer and colleagues went on to
characterize properdin as a protein that
represented less than 0.03% of serum
proteins and whose activity was absolutely dependent on the presence of
magnesium ions. In a brilliant series of
experiments, Pillemer demonstrated the
importance of his newly discovered factor
in complement-related antibacterial and
antiviral reactions, as well as its role in the
disease known as paroxysmal nocturnal
hemoglobinemia.
In light of today’s knowledge, we can
interpret exactly what was happening in
his experiments. Properdin bound to the
zymosan and stabilized the C3 convertase

of the alternative pathway, resulting in C3
cleavage. Indeed, experiments performed
as recently as 2007 show that properdin
binds to zymosan in a manner similar to
its binding to Neisseria membranes.
Pillemer’s discovery of properdin coupled with his purification of the tetanus
and diphtheria toxins should have sealed
his reputation as a world-class biochemist.
Indeed, his findings were deemed of sufficient general interest at the time that
they were publicized in the lay press as
well as in the scientific media; articles and
editorials about them appeared in the
New York Times, Time magazine, and Collier’s.
Nor did Pillemer oversell his case. Scientists writing about this period are at pains
to note that Pillemer did not make or
broadcast any claims for his molecule
beyond what appeared in the reviewed
scientific literature.
However, in 1957 and 1958, scientist
Robert Nelson offered an alternative
explanation for Pillemer’s findings. He
pointed out that what Pillemer had
described as a new protein could simply
be a mixture of natural antibodies specific for zymosan. If that were the case,
then all Pillemer had succeeded in doing
was describing the classical pathway a

serum that is adsorbed onto zymosan, the yeast cell wall extract, is capable of

second time. Sensitive biochemical
experiments indeed demonstrated the
presence of low levels of antizymosan
antibodies in properdin preparations, and
the immunological community began to
doubt the relevance of properdin to the
complement activation that Pillemer
described.
Pillemer was devastated. Never completely stable emotionally, Pillemer’s
“behavior became erratic, he occasionally
abused alcohol and he appeared to be
experimenting with drugs,” according to
his former graduate student, Irwin H.
Lepow, who went on to become a distinguished immunologist in his own right.
On August 31, 1957, right in the midst of
the controversy over properdin, Pillemer
died of acute barbiturate intoxication. His
death was ruled a suicide, although
nobody can know whether he was merely
seeking short-term relief from stress and
his death was therefore accidental, or
whether he truly meant to bring an end to
his life.
Subsequent experiments demonstrated that antibodies to zymosan could
be removed from partially purified properdin without loss of the ability of the
preparation to catalyze the cleavage of
C3, thus confirming Pillemer’s finding.
Furthermore, the heat-labile factor identified by Pillemer’s experiments was identified as a previously unknown molecule,
which was subsequently named factor B.
By the late 1960s other laboratories
entered the arena, and slowly Pillemer’s
discovery was confirmed and extended
into what we now know as the alternative
pathway of complement activation. It is
one of the great tragedies of immunology
that Pillemer did not live to enjoy the validation of his elegant work.

complement pathway, via the enzymes of the coagulation
cascade. Given the proinflammatory roles of the anaphylatoxins, this would result in further amplification of the
inflammatory state. Additional experiments have since
revealed that other coagulation pathway enzymes, such as
plasmin, are capable of generating both C3a and C5a.
Furthermore, when blood platelets are activated during a
clotting reaction, they release high concentrations of ATP
and Ca2⫹ along with serine/threonine kinases. These
enzymes act to phosphorylate extracellular proteins, including C3b. Phosphorylated C3b is less susceptible to proteolytic degradation than its unphosphorylated form, and thus,
by this route, activation of the clotting cascade enhances all
of the complement pathways.

The Three Complement Pathways Converge at
the Formation of the C5 Convertase
The end result of the three initiation pathways is the formation
of a C5 convertase. For the classical and lectin pathways, the C5
convertase has the composition C4b2a3b; for the alternative
pathway, the C5 convertase has the formulation C3bBbC3b. (In

the thrombin-initiated pathway, the anaphylatoxin C5a is
formed by cleavage of C5 by the blood clotting enzymes, but
functionally meaningful C5b concentrations are not generated
by this route.) However, the end result of all types of C5 convertase activity is the same: the cleavage of the C5 molecule into two
fragments, C5a and C5b. The large C5b fragment is generated
on the surface of the target cell or immune complex and provides a binding site for the subsequent components of the
MAC. However, the C5b component is extremely labile, is not
covalently bound to the membrane like C3b and C4b, and is
rapidly inactivated unless it is stabilized by the binding of C6.

C5 Initiates the Generation of the MAC
Up to this point in the complement cascades, all of the complement reactions take place on the hydrophilic surfaces of
microbes or on immune complexes in the fluid phase of blood,
lymph, or tissues. In contrast, when C5b binds C6 and C7, the
resulting complex undergoes a conformational change that
exposes hydrophobic regions on the surface of the C7 component capable of inserting into the interior of the microbial
membrane (Figure 6-10a). If, however, the reaction occurs on

The Complement System
an immune complex or other noncellular activating surface,
then the hydrophobic binding sites cannot anchor the complex
and it is released. Released C5b67 complexes can insert into the
membrane of nearby cells and mediate “innocent bystander”
lysis. Under physiologic conditions, such lysis is usually minimized by regulatory proteins (see below).
C8 is made up of two peptide chains: C8␤ and C8␣␥. Binding of C8␤ to the C5b67 complex induces a conformational
change in the C8 dimer such that the hydrophobic domain of
C8␣␥ can insert into the interior of the phospholipid membrane. The C5b678 complex can create a small pore, 10 Å in
diameter, and formation of this pore can lead to lysis of red
blood cells, but not of nucleated cells. The final step in the
formation of the MAC is the binding and polymerization of
C9 to the C5b678 complex. As many as 10 to 19 molecules of
C9 can be bound and polymerized by a single C5b678 complex. During polymerization, the C9 molecules undergo a
transition, so that they, too, can insert into the membrane. The
completed MAC, which has a tubular form and functional
pore diameter of 70 Å to 100 Å, consists of a C5b678 complex
surrounded by a poly-C9 complex (Figure 6-10b). Loss of
plasma membrane integrity leads irreversibly to cell death.

of Complement

each of which is discussed below. In addition to its longunderstood role in antibody-induced lysis of microbes,

complement also has important functions in innate immunity, many of which are mediated by the soluble innate
immune receptors such as MBL and the ficolins. The pivotal importance of C3b-mediated responses such as opsonization has been clearly demonstrated in C3⫺/⫺ knockout
animals, which display increased susceptibility to both
viral and bacterial infections. In addition, recent experiments have explored the roles of various complement components at the interface of innate and adaptive immunity,
and identified multiple mechanisms by which the release of
active complement fragments acts to regulate the adaptive
immune system. Complement also plays an important role
in the contraction phase of the adaptive immune response,
and recent work has even suggested that it is important in
the elimination of excess synapses during the development
of the nervous system. These various functions are
described below.

Complement Receptors Connect ComplementTagged Pathogens to Effector Cells
Many of the biological activities of the complement system
depend on the binding of complement fragments to cell
surface complement receptors. In addition, some complement receptors play an important role in regulating complement activity by mediating proteolysis of biologically active
complement components. The levels of a number of the
complement receptors are subject to regulation by aspects of
the innate and adaptive immune systems. For example, activation of phagocytic cells by various agents, including the

anaphylatoxins of the complement system, has been shown
to increase the number of complement receptors by as much
as tenfold.
Therefore, before we venture into a discussion of the biological functions of complement, we should first become
familiar with the receptors for complement components and
their activities. The complement receptors and their primary
ligands are listed in Table 6-3. Where receptors have more
than one name, we have offered both on first introduction,
and subsequently refer to that receptor by the more common
name.
CR1 (CD35) is expressed on both leukocytes and erythrocytes and binds with high affinity to C4b, C3b, and smaller
C3b breakdown products. CR1 receptors on erythrocytes
bind immune complexes and take them to the liver where
they are picked up by phagocytes and cleared. Binding of

complement-opsonized microbial cells via CR1 on phagocytes results in receptor-mediated phagocytosis and the
secretion of proinflammatory molecules such as IL-1 and
prostaglandins. CR1 on B cells mediates antigen uptake of
C3b-bound antigen, leading to its degradation in the B-cell
lysosomal system and subsequent presentation to T cells.
This process makes CR1 an actor in the adaptive, as well as
in the innate immune response. As we will see later, CR1 also
mediates the protection of host cells against the ravages of
complement attack, by serving as a cofactor for the destructive cleavage of C3b and C4b on host cell membranes by
factor I, as well as acting as an accelerator of the decay of the
C3 and C5 convertases.
C3b, either in solution or bound to the surface of cells, is
subject to breakdown by endogenous proteases. CD21
(CR2) is expressed on B cells and binds specifically to the

FIGURE 6-11 Coligation of antigen to B cells via IgM and

molecules, CD21 (CR2), CD81 (TAPA-1), and CD19. The CD19 component is important in BCR antigen receptor signaling. Antigen that has
been covalently bound to fragments of the C3 complement compo-

breakdown products of C3b: iC3b, C3d, and C3dg. Since
C3b can form covalent bonds with antigens, the presence of
CD21 on B cells enables the B cell to bind antigen via both
the B-cell receptor and CD21 (Figure 6-11). This ability to
simultaneously coengage antigen through two receptors has
the effect of reducing the antigen concentration necessary
for B-cell activation by up to a hundredfold (see Chapter 12).
Deficiencies in CD21 have been identified in patients suffering from autoimmune diseases such as systemic lupus erythematosus (see below).
CR3 (a complex of CD11b and CD18) and CR4 (a complex of CD11c and CD18) are important in the phagocytosis
of complement-coated antigens. CR3 and CR4 bind C3b
and several of its breakdown products, including iC3b, C3c,
and C3dg.
CRIg also binds C3b. It is expressed on macrophages
resident in the fixed tissues, including on the Kupffer cells of
the liver. Its importance in clearing C3b-opsonized antigens
by facilitating their removal from circulation in the liver is
emphasized by the finding that CRIg-deficient mice are
unable to efficiently clear C3-opsonized particles. Animals
with this deficiency are therefore subject to higher mortalities during infections.

binding the small anaphylatoxins, C3a and C5a, respectively

through C5aR and C5L2 knockout animals express
enhanced inflammatory responses upon C5a binding to its
receptor.
More recently, a transmembrane lectin, SIGN-R1, able to
bind C1q has been shown to be expressed on the surface of
macrophages located in the marginal zone of the spleen.
SIGN-R1 exists on the macrophage cell surface in aggregated
form and is also able to bind carbohydrates present on the
coat of the Gram-positive bacterium Staphylococcus pneumoniae. When SIGN-R1 binds to bacterial polysaccharides,
the C1q-binding capacity is activated in the same, or in
nearby SIGN-R1 molecules, eventually resulting in the opsonization of the bacterium with C3b. The opsonized bacteria
are then released from these macrophages and bound by
nearby phagocytes, B cells, or dendritic cells. This unusual
mechanism explains a problem long noted with patients who
have undergone splenectomy: an increased susceptibility to
infection by S. pneumoniae.

Complement Enhances Host Defense
Against Infection
Complement proteins actively engage in host defense against
infection by forming the MAC, by opsonizing potentially
pathogenic microbes, and by inducing an inflammatory
response that helps to guide leukocytes to the site of infection.
MAC-Induced Cell Death
The first function of complement to be described was its role
in inducing cell death following insertion of the MAC into
target cell membranes. Early experiments on MAC formation used erythrocytes as the target membranes, and in this
cellular system large pores involving 17 to 19 molecules of
C9 were reported. Formation of these holes in the cell membrane (see Figure 6-10b) facilitated the free movement of
small molecules and ions. The penetrated red blood cell
membranes were unable to maintain osmotic integrity, and
the cells lysed after massive influx of water from the extracellular fluid.
However, subsequent studies using nucleated eukaryotic
cells indicated that smaller pores can be generated using
only a few molecules of C9, and that death under these circumstances occurs via a type of apoptosis (programmed cell
death), following calcium influx into the cytoplasm. Nuclear
fragmentation, a hallmark of apoptotic death, was observed
during MAC-induced lysis of nucleated cells, which further
supported the notion that at least some MAC-targeted cells
succumb to apoptosis. More careful observations indicated
that the apoptosis induced by the MAC does not share all the
biochemical characteristics normally associated with pro-

grammed cell death, and so this MAC-induced apoptosis
has been termed apoptotic necrosis.
Killing eukaryotic cells with complement is actually quite
difficult, as the membranes of such cells have a number of
factors that act together to inactivate the complement proteins, and thus protect the host cells from collateral damage
during a complement-mediated attack on infectious microorganisms (see below). However, when high concentrations
of complement components are present, MACs can overwhelm the host defenses against MAC attack, and the resulting cell fragments, if present in sufficiently high concentrations,
can induce autoimmunity. Indeed, complement-mediated
damage is a problem in several autoimmune diseases, and
the complement system is considered a target for therapeutic
intervention in autoimmune syndromes.
Can a eukaryotic cell recover from a MAC attack? Welldocumented studies have demonstrated that MACs can be
removed from the cell surface, either by shedding MACcontaining membrane vesicles into the extracellular fluid, or
by internalizing and degrading the MAC-containing vesicles
in intracellular lysosomes. If the MAC is shed or internalized
soon enough after its initial expression on the membrane, the
cell can repair any membrane damage and restore its osmotic
stability. An unfortunate corollary of this capacity to recover
from MAC attack is that complement-mediated lysis directed
by tumor-specific antibodies may be rendered ineffective by
endocytosis or shedding of the MAC (see Chapter 19).
Different types of microorganisms are susceptible to
complement-induced lysis to varying degrees. Antibody and
complement play an important role in host defense against
viruses and can be crucial both in containing viral spread

during acute infection and in protecting against reinfection.
Most enveloped viruses, including herpesviruses, orthomyxoviruses such as those causing measles and mumps,
paramyxoviruses such as influenza, and retroviruses are susceptible to complement-mediated lysis.
However, some bacteria are not susceptible to MAC
attack. Gram-positive bacteria efficiently repel complement
assault, as the complement proteins cannot penetrate the
bacterial cell wall to gain access to the membrane beyond.
In contrast, when attacking Gram-negative bacteria, complement first permeabilizes the outer layer and, following
destruction of the thin cell wall, lyses the inner bacterial
membrane. In some cases, the MAC has been found to
localize at regions of apposition of the inner and outer cell
walls, and breaches them both simultaneously. Neisseria

meningitidis is a Gram-negative bacterium that is susceptible to MAC-induced lysis, and patients who are deficient in
any of the complement components of the MAC are particularly vulnerable to potentially fatal meningitis caused by
this bacterial species.
Promotion of Opsonization
As described in Chapter 5, the term opsonization refers to
the capacity of antibodies and complement components (as
well as other proteins) to coat dangerous antigens that can
then be recognized by Fc receptors (for antibodies) or complement receptors (for complement components) on phagocytic cells. Binding of complement-coated antigen by
phagocytic cells results in complement receptor-mediated
phagocytosis and antigen destruction (Figure 6-13). In

Innate Immunity

addition, complement receptors on erythrocytes also serve
to bind immune complexes, which are then transported to
the liver for phagocytosis by macrophages (Figure 6-14).
Although less visually compelling than MAC formation,
opsonization may be the most physiologically important
function assumed by complement components.
Opsonization with antibody and complement provides
critical protection against viral infection. Antibody and
complement can create a thick protein coat around a virus
that neutralizes viral infectivity by preventing the virus from
binding to receptors on the host cell. It also promotes phagocytosis via the complement receptors, followed by intracellular destruction of the digested particle.
Promotion of Inflammation
So far, we have focused on the roles of the larger products of
complement factor fragmentation: C3b and C4b in opsonization and C5b in the formation of the MAC. However, the
smaller fragments of C3, C4, and C5 cleavage—C3a, C4a,
and C5a—are no less potent and mediate critically important events in immune responses, acting as anaphylatoxins
or inducers of inflammation. We will focus here specifically
on the activities of C3a and C5a.
C3a and C5a are structurally similar, small proteins
(about 9 kDa, or 74–77 amino acid residues in size) that
promote inflammation and also serve as chemoattractants
for certain classes of leukocytes. C3a and C5a bind G-proteincoupled, activating receptors (C3aR for C3a, C5aR for C5a)
on granulocytes, monocytes, macrophages, mast cells, endothelial cells, and some dendritic cells (see Figure 6-12). Binding of these anaphylatoxins to their receptors on some cells
triggers a signaling cascade that leads to the secretion of
soluble mediators such as IL-6 and TNF-␣. These cytokines
in turn induce localized increases in vascular permeability
that enable leukocyte migration into the site of infection,
and a concomitant increase in smooth muscle motility that
helps to propel the released fluid to the site of damage. In
addition, these proinflammatory mediators promote phagocytosis of offending pathogens and localized degranulation
of granulocytes (neutrophils, basophils, and eosinophils)
with the resultant release of a second round of inflammatory
mediators, including histamines and prostaglandins. Inflammatory mediators expedite the movement of lymphocytes
into neighboring lymph nodes where they are activated by
the pathogen. This localized inflammatory response is
further supported by systemic effects, such as fever, that
decrease microbial viability.
The central role of the anaphylatoxins in the promotion of
physiologically important inflammatory responses has
brought them to the attention of clinicians seeking ways to
tamp down the pathological levels of inflammation experienced by patients suffering from diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE).
Clinical Focus Box 6-2 describes some approaches that
investigators are taking to explore the complement system as
a potential therapeutic target.

The Complement System

Complement Mediates the Interface Between
Innate and Adaptive Immunities
Experiments in the past two or three decades have revealed
multiple mechanisms by which components of the complement system modulate adaptive immunity. Many of these
findings are extremely recent, and the study of how the binding of complement components and regulatory proteins may
affect antigen-presenting cells, T cells, and B cells is still in its
early phases.
Complement and Antigen-Presenting Cells
Dendritic cells (DCs), follicular dendritic cells (FDCs), and
macrophages express all of the known complement receptors. When bound to antigens, MBL, C1q, C3b, and C4b are
each capable of engaging their respective receptors on antigenpresenting cells during the process of antigen recognition,
and signaling through their respective receptors acts to
enhance antigen uptake.
In addition, signaling of antigen-presenting cells through
the C5aR anaphylatoxin receptor has been shown to modulate their migration and affect interleukin production, particularly that of the cytokine IL-12. Production of IL-12 by an
antigen-presenting cell normally skews the T-cell response
toward the TH1 phenotype (see Chapter 11). Since both
induction and suppression of IL-12 production have been
detected after activation of the anaphylatoxin receptors,
depending upon the route of antigen delivery, the nature of
the antigen, and the maturation status of the antigen-presenting
cell, we must infer that many signaling pathways are being
integrated to arrive at the eventual biological response to
antigen and complement components.
Complement and B-Cell-Mediated
Humoral Immunity
In 1972, Pepys showed that depleting mice of C3 impaired
their T-dependent antigen-specific B-cell responses, thus
implying that complement may participate in the initiation
of the B-cell response. It now appears that this seminal
observation was the first description of the complement
receptor CD21 acting as a coreceptor in antigen recognition.
Recall that the C3b molecule is capable of covalently “tagging” antigen by interaction between its reactive thioester
group and hydroxyl or amino groups on the surface of the
antigen. As described in Chapters 3 and 12, the immunoglobulin receptor is expressed on the B-lymphocyte membrane along with the complement receptor CD21, the
signaling protein CD19, and the transmembrane CD81 (tetraspanin, or TAPA-1) molecule (see Figure 6-11). CD21 is a
receptor with specificity for both C3b and the products of
C3b proteolytic breakdown, C3d (human) or C3dg (mouse).
If C3b was originally bound to a microbial surface, the C3d
or C3dg fragments remain bound to that surface after C3b
proteolysis. A B cell bearing an immunoglobulin receptor
specific for that microbe will therefore be able to bind the
microbe with both its immunoglobulin receptor and with

the associated CD21 complement receptor, thus enhancing
the interaction between the B cell and antigen and reducing
the amount of antigen that is required to signal a B-cell
response by a factor of tenfold to a thousandfold.
Complement and T-Cell-Mediated Immunity
The mechanisms by which complement affects T-cell responses
are not as well characterized as those for B cells and antigenpresenting cells. However, some recent, interesting results have
been generated by the study of mice either genetically deficient
in one or more complement components or following treatment with complement inhibitors. For example, mice lacking
the C3 gene have reduced CD4⫹ and CD8⫹ T cell responses,
implying that signaling through C3 enhances T-cell function.
Furthermore, mice treated with inhibitors of C5aR signaling
produced fewer antigen-specific CD8⫹ T cells, following influenza infection, than wild-type mice, indicating that C5a may
act as a costimulator during CD8⫹ T-cell activation, possibly
by increasing IL-12 production by antigen-presenting cells, as
described above. Both these experiments demonstrate that
signaling through complement components may have positive
effects on T-cell-mediated adaptive immune responses.
The study of T-cell regulation by complement components is in its infancy, but these provocative findings suggest
that there is much to learn and that complement may have
more powerful effects on adaptive immunity than previously
thought. As these effects are further explored, the question
of whether complement is acting directly on the T cells, or
indirectly, via effects on antigen-presenting cells, is an issue
that will need to be clearly defined.

Complement Aids in the Contraction Phase
of the Immune Response
At the close of an adaptive immune response, most of the
lymphocytes that were generated in the initial proliferative
phase undergo apoptosis (programmed cell death), leaving
only a few antigen-specific cells behind to provide immunological memory (see Chapters 11 and 12). In addition, soluble antigen-antibody complexes may still be present in the
bloodstream and immune organs. If autoimmune disease is
to be avoided, these excess lymphocytes and immune complexes must be disposed of safely, without the induction of
further inflammation, and complement components play a
major role in these processes.
Disposal of Apoptotic Cells and Bodies
Apoptotic cells express the phospholipid phosphatidyl serine
on the exterior surface of their plasma membranes. In healthy
cells, this phospholipid is normally restricted to the cytoplasmic side of the membrane, and this change in its location
serves to signal the immune system that the cell is undergoing
programmed cell death. Surprisingly, experiments have also
demonstrated the presence of nucleic acids on the surface
membrane of apoptotic cells. Nuclear fragmentation and

CLINICAL FOCUS

The Complement System as a Therapeutic Target
The involvement of complementderived anaphylatoxins in inflammation
makes complement an interesting therapeutic target in the treatment of inflammatory diseases, such as arthritis. In addition,
autoimmune diseases that potentially result
in complement-mediated damage to host
cells, such as multiple sclerosis and agerelated macular degeneration, are also
potential candidates for complementfocused therapeutic interventions.
The last three decades have seen the
crystallization and molecular characterization of several complement components,
a necessary precursor to the development
of designer drugs targeted to specific proteins. At the time of writing, however, just
two therapies directed at interfering with
complement components are approved
for clinical use, although at least one more
is currently in clinical trials.
Purified C1 esterase inhibitor is currently in use in the clinic as a therapeutic
option for the treatment of hereditary
angioedema. However, its beneficial
effects are most likely the result of the
inhibition of excess esterase activation
external to the complement system per se.
The other successful complementrelated treatment is more specifically
directed toward a dysregulation of the
complement cascade. Paroxysmal noctur-

nal hemoglobinuria (PNH) manifests as
increased fragility of erythrocytes, leading
to chronic hemolytic anemia, pancytopenia (loss of blood cells of all types), and
venous thrombosis (formation of blood
clots). The name PNH derives from the
presence of hemoglobin in the urine, most
commonly observed in the first urine
passed after a night’s sleep. The cause of
PNH is a general defect in the synthesis of
cell-surface proteins, which affects the
expression of two regulators of complement: DAF (CD55) and Protectin (CD59).
DAF and Protectin are cell-surface proteins that function as inhibitors of complement-mediated cell lysis, acting at
different stages of the process. DAF
induces dissociation and inactivation of
the C3 convertases of the classical, lectin,
and alternative pathways (see Figure
6-16). Protectin acts later in the pathway
by binding to the C5b678 complex and
inhibiting C9 binding, thereby preventing
formation of the membrane pores that
destroy the cell under attack. Deficiency
in these proteins leads to increased sensitivity of host cells to complement-mediated lysis and is associated with a high risk
of thrombosis.
Protectin and DAF are attached to the
cell membrane via glycosylphosphatidyl
inositol (GPI) anchors, rather than by

DNA cleavage follow quickly after outer membrane phosphatidyl serine expression. Once apoptosis begins, the dying cell
is broken down into membrane-bound vesicles termed apoptotic bodies, which express phosphatidyl serine and/or surfacebound DNA on their exterior surfaces. Recent work has
demonstrated that C1q binds specifically to DNA.
The complement component C1q specifically binds apoptotic bodies and assists in their clearance. When light-sensitive
keratinocytes (skin cells) are treated with UVB to initiate apoptosis and then stained with anti-C1q antibody, C1q staining is
restricted to the apoptotic blebs, where DNA, exposed on
apoptotic membranes, is specifically recognized by C1q (Figure 6-15). With C1q deposition, the classical pathway is initiated and the apoptotic cells are then opsonized by C3b. This, in
turn, leads to clearance of the apoptotic cells by phagocytes.

stretches of hydrophobic amino acids, as is
the case for many membrane proteins.
Patients with PNH lack an enzyme, Phosphatidyl Inositol Glycan Class A (PIGA), that
attaches the GPI anchors to the appropriate proteins. Patients thus lack the expression of DAF and Protectin needed to
protect erythrocytes against lysis. The term
paroxysmal refers to the fact that episodes
of erythrocyte lysis are often triggered by
stress or infection, which result in increased
deposition of C3b on host cells. The gene
encoding the PIGA enzyme is X-linked.
The defect identified in PNH occurs
early in the enzymatic pathway leading to
formation of a GPI anchor and resides in
the pig-a gene. Transfection of cells from
PNH patients with an intact pig-a gene
restores the resistance of the cells to host
complement lysis. Further genetic analysis revealed that the defect is not encoded
in the germline genome (and therefore is
not transmissible to offspring), but rather
is the result of mutations that occurred
within the hematopoietic stem cells
themselves, such that any one individual
may have both normal and affected cells.
Those patients who are most adversely
affected display a preferential expansion
of the affected cell populations.
PNH is a chronic disease with a mean
survival time between 10 and 15 years.

In the absence of C1q, the apoptotic membrane blebs
are released from the dying cells as apoptotic bodies,
which can then act as antigens and initiate autoimmune
responses. As a consequence, mice deficient in C1q show
increased mortality and higher titers of auto-antibodies
than control mice and also display an increased frequency
of glomerulonephritis, an autoimmune kidney disease.
Analysis of the kidneys of C1q knockout mice reveal
deposition of immune complexes as well as significant
numbers of apoptotic bodies.
Disposal of Immune Complexes
As mentioned earlier, the coating of soluble immune complexes with C3b facilitates their binding by CR1 on erythrocytes. Although red blood cells express lower levels of CR1

BOX 6-2
The most common causes of mortality in
PNH are venous thromboses affecting
hepatic veins and progressive bone marrow failure.
A breakthrough in treatment of PNH
was reported in 2004 using a humanized
monoclonal antibody that targets complement component C5 and thus inhibits
the terminal steps of the complement
cascade and formation of the membraneattack complex. This antibody—eculizumab (Soliris)—was infused into patients,
who were then monitored for the loss of
red blood cells. A dramatic improvement
was seen in patients during a 12-week
period of treatment with eculizumab (Figure 1). Treatment of PNH patients with

eculizumab relieves hemoglobinuria,
reverses the kidney damage resulting
from high levels of protein in the urine,
and significantly reduces the frequency of
thromboses. In 2007, eculizumab was
approved for the treatment of PNH in the
general population.
Since the control of infections with
Meningococcal bacteria (Neisseria meningitidis) relies upon an intact and functioning membrane attack complex (MAC),
patients being treated with eculizumab
are routinely vaccinated against meningococcus.
The pathology of PNH underscores the
potential danger to the host that is inherent in the activation of the complement

(100–1000 molecules per cell, depending on the age of the
cell and the genetic constitution of the donor) than do
granulocytes (5 ⫻ 104 per cell), there are about 1000 erythrocytes for every white blood cell, and therefore erythrocytes account for about 90% of the CR1 in blood.
Erythrocytes also therefore play an important role in clearing C3b-coated immune complexes by conveying them to
the liver and spleen where the immune complexes are
stripped from the red blood cells and phagocytosed (see
Figure 6-14).
The importance of the complement system in immune
complex clearance is emphasized by the finding that patients
with SLE, the autoimmune disease, have high concentrations
of immune complexes in their serum that are deposited in

system. Complex systems of regulation
are necessary to protect host cells from
the activated complement complexes
generated to lyse intruders, and alterations in the expression or effectiveness of
these regulators has the potential to result
in a pathological outcome.
The centrality of C3 within the complement cascades may suggest that it
would be an excellent target for therapeutic intervention in complementmediated disease. However, its very position
at the crossroads of the three pathways
means that interference with C3 activity
places patients at increased risk for infectious diseases normally curtailed by the
activities of the innate as well as the adaptive immune systems, and so systemic
drugs specifically targeting C3 may prove
to have too high a risk-benefit ratio.
However, in one success story, targeted to a particular organ system, the
drug Compstatin was developed as a
result of phage display experiments
designed to discover compounds that
bound to C3. Chemical refinements based
on structural and computational studies
followed, and a Compstatin derivative,
POT-4, is now in clinical trials for the treatment of age-related macular degeneration, a progressive and debilitating eye
disease that leads inexorably and quickly
to total blindness. Because POT-4 can be
delivered directly into the vitreous humor
of the eye, systemic side effects on the
patient’s immune system are minimized.

the tissues. Complement is activated by these tissue-deposited
immune complexes, and pathological inflammation is induced
in the affected tissues (see Chapter 15).
Since complement activation is implicated in the pathogenesis of SLE, it may therefore seem paradoxical that the
incidence of SLE is highly correlated to C4 deficiency.
Indeed, 90% of individuals who completely lack C4 develop
SLE. The resolution to this paradox lies in the fact that deficiencies in the early components of complement lead to a
reduction in the levels of C3b that are deposited on the
immune complexes. This reduction, in turn, inhibits their
clearance by C3b-mediated opsonization and allows for the
activation of the later inflammatory and cytolytic phases of
complement activation.

levels of complement components in the adult retina during
the early phases of the disease, suggesting that inappropriate,
complement-mediated synaptic pruning may be a causal
factor in that disease. C1q up-regulation has also been
observed in animal models of both ALS and Alzheimer’s
disease, potentially implicating inappropriate complement
activation in the etiology of some clinically important neurodegenerative illnesses.

The Regulation of
Complement Activity

FIGURE 6-15 Binding of C1q to apoptotic keratinocytes
(skin cells) is limited to surface apoptotic blebs. Apoptosis was
induced in human skin cells by exposure to ultraviolet light. The cells
were then incubated in human serum and stained with an antibody
to C1q. This is an image derived from confocal microscopy that
shows the C1q staining in green, clearly localizing to the apoptotic
blebs. The cell itself is visualized by phase contrast microscopy, and
the image was generated by merging the phase contrast and immunofluorescent frames. [Korb and Ahearn. 1997. J. Immunol. 158: 4525–4528.]

Complement Mediates CNS Synapse
Elimination
Complement has also been shown to play an important role
outside the boundaries of the immune system. In the developing nervous system, growing neurons first form a relatively high number of connections (synapses) with one
another; the number of those synapses is then pruned as the
nervous system matures. Scientists studying the development of the mouse eye have demonstrated that animals
deficient in C1q or C3 fail to eliminate these early, excess
synapses, and display anatomical abnormalities in the visual
nervous system, indicating that complement may play an
important role in the process of synaptic remodeling.
In healthy animals, the expression of complement components in mouse neurons is up-regulated early in development, in response to signals provided by immature astrocytes
(glial cells that assist in the function and maintenance of the
nervous system). Complement component expression is
then down-regulated as the animals mature and astrocyte
function is dampened. However, patients suffering from
glaucoma have been shown to display erroneously high

All biological systems with the potential to damage the host,
be they metabolic pathways, cytotoxic cells, or enzyme cascades, are subject to rigorous regulatory mechanisms, and
the complement system is no exception to this general rule.
Especially in light of the potent positive feedback mechanisms and the absence of antigen specificity of the alternative pathway, the host must ensure that the destructive
potential of complement proteins is confined to the appropriate pathogen surfaces and that collateral damage to
healthy host tissue is minimized.
Below, we discuss the different mechanisms by which the
host protects itself against the potential ravages of inadvertent complement activation.

Complement Activity Is Passively Regulated by
Protein Stability and Cell-Surface Composition
Protection of vertebrate host cells against complementmediated damage is achieved by both general, passive and
specific, active regulatory mechanisms. The relative instability of many complement components is the first means by
which the host protects itself against inadvertent complement activation. For example, the C3 convertase of the
alternative pathway, C3bBbC3b, has a half-life of only 5 minutes before it breaks down, unless it is stabilized by reaction
with properdin. A second passive regulatory mechanism
depends upon the difference in the cell surface carbohydrate
composition of host versus microbial cells. For example, fluid
phase proteases that destroy C3b bind much more effectively to host cells, which bear high levels of sialic acid,
than to microbes that have significantly lower levels of this
sugar. Hence, any C3b that happens to alight on a host cell
is likely to be destroyed before it can effect significant
damage.
In addition to these more passive environmental brakes
on inappropriate complement activation, a series of active
regulatory proteins act to inhibit, destroy, or tune down the
activity of complement proteins and their active fragments.
The stages at which complement activity is subject to regulation are illustrated in Figure 6-16, and the regulatory proteins are listed in Table 6-4.

to control the time period during which they can remain
active.

C1INH, the C1 inhibitor, is a plasma protein that binds in
the active site of serine proteases, effectively poisoning
them. C1INH belongs to the class of proteins called serine
protease inhibitors (serpins), and it acts by forming a complex with the C1 proteases, C1r2s2, causing them to dissociate from C1q and preventing further activation of C4 or
C2 (see Figure 6-16a). C1INH inhibits both C3b and the
serine protease MASP2. It is the only plasma protease
capable of inhibiting the initiation of both the classical and
lectin complement pathways. Its presence in plasma serves

Decay Accelerating Factors Promote Decay
of C3 Convertases
Since the reaction catalyzed by the C3 convertase enzymes
is the major amplification step in complement activation,
the generation and lifetimes of the C3 convertases C4b2a
and C3bBb are subject to rigorous control. Several membrane-bound factors accelerate the decay of the C4b2a on
the surface of host cells, including decay accelerating factor, or DAF (CD55), CR1, and C4BP (C4 binding protein)

(see Figure 6-16b). These decay accelerating factors cooperate to accelerate the breakdown of the C4b2a complex
into its separate components. The enzymatically active
C2a diffuses away, and the residual membrane-bound C4b
is degraded by another regulatory protein, factor I (see
Figure 6-16c).
In the alternative pathway, DAF and CR1 function in a
similar fashion and are joined by factor H in separating the
C3b component of the alternative pathway C3 convertase
from its partner, Bb. Again, Bb diffuses away, and residual
C3b is degraded (see Figure 6-16b).
Whereas DAF and CR1 are membrane-bound components and their expression is therefore restricted to host
cells, factor H and C4BP are soluble regulatory complement
components. Host-specific function of factor H is ensured
by its binding to polyanions such as sialic acid and heparin,
essential components of eukaryotic, but not prokaryotic, cell
surfaces. Similarly, C4BP is preferentially bound by host cell
membrane proteoglycans such as heparan sulfate. In this

way, host cells are protected from deposition of complement
components, whereas it is permitted on the membranes of
microbial invaders that lack DAF and CR1 expression and
fail to bind factor H or C4BP.

Factor I Degrades C3b and C4b
Factor H, C4BP, and CR1 also figure in a second and potentially more critical pathway of complement regulation: that
catalyzed by factor I. Factor I is a soluble, constitutively
(always) active serine protease that can cleave membraneassociated C3b and C4b into inactive fragments (Figure 6-16c).
However, if factor I is indeed soluble, constitutively
active, and designed to destroy C3b and C4b, one might
wonder how the complement cascades described above can
ever succeed in destroying invading microbes? The answer is
that factor I requires the presence of cofactors in order to
function and that two of these cofactors, Membrane Cofactor
of Proteolysis (MCP, or CD46) and CR1, are found on the

c06TheComplementSystem.indd Page 213 12/20/12 12:11 AM user-t044

The Complement System
surface of host cells, but not on the surfaces of the microbial
cells (see Figure 6-16c). The other two cofactors, factor H
and C4BP, described above, bind host cell-surface peptidoglycans. Hence, cleavage of membrane-bound C3b on host
cells is conducted by factor I in collaboration with the
membrane-bound host cell proteins, CD46 and CR1, and
the soluble cofactor H. Similarly, cleavage of membranebound C4b is effected again by factor I, this time in collaboration with membrane-bound CD46 and CR1 and soluble
cofactor C4BP. Since these membrane-bound, or membranebinding cofactors are not found on microbial cells, C3b and
C4b are thus allowed to remain on microbial cells and effect
their specific functions.
CD46 has recently been implicated as a factor in the control of apoptosis of dying T cells. When a T cell commits to
apoptosis, it expresses DNA on its cell membrane that binds
circulating C1q, as described above. It then begins to shed
CD46 from the cell surface. Only after CD46 is lost can progression of the classical pathway occur, with increased C3b
binding and phagocytosis of the apoptotic T cells. As the cell
continues to deteriorate, it may also begin to release nucleotides and other molecules into the tissue fluids that serve as
chemotactic signals for phagocytes.

Protectin Inhibits the MAC Attack
In the case of a particularly robust antibody response, or of an
inflammatory response accompanied by extensive complement activation, inappropriate assembly of MAC complexes
on healthy host cells can potentially occur, and mechanisms
have evolved to prevent the resulting inadvertent host cell
destruction. A host cell surface protein, Protectin (CD59),
binds any C5b678 complexes that may be deposited on host
cells and prevents their insertion into the host cell membrane
(see Figure 6-16d). Protectin also blocks further C9 addition
to developing MACs. In addition, the soluble complement S
protein, otherwise known as Vitronectin, binds any fluid
phase C5b67 complexes released from microbial cells, preventing their insertion into host cell membranes.

Carboxypeptidases Can Inactivate the
Anaphylatoxins C3a and C5a
Anaphylatoxin activity is regulated by cleavage of the
C-terminal arginine residues from both C3a and C5a by
serum carboxypeptidases, resulting in rapid inactivation of
the anaphylatoxin activity (Figure 6-16e). Carboxypeptidases are a general class of enzymes that remove amino acids
from the carboxyl termini of proteins; the specific enzymes
that mediate the control of anaphylatoxin concentrations are
carboxypeptidases N, B, and R. These enzymes remove arginine residues from the carboxyl termini of C3a and C5a to
form the so-called des-Arg (“without Arginine”), inactive
forms of the molecules. In addition, as mentioned above,
binding of C5a by C5L2 also serves to modulate the inflammatory activity of C5a.

CHAPTER 6

213

Complement Deficiencies
Genetic deficiencies have been described for each of the
complement components. Homozygous deficiencies in any
of the early components of the classical pathway (C1q, C1r,
C1s, C4, and C2) result in similar symptoms, notably a
marked increase in immune-complex diseases such as SLE,
glomerulonephritis, and vasculitis. The effects of these deficiencies highlight the importance of the early complement
reactions in generating C3b and C3b’s role in the solubilization and clearance of immune complexes. In addition, as
described above, C1q has been shown to bind apoptotic
blebs. In the absence of C1q binding, cells bearing these
apoptotic blebs, or the blebs themselves, can act as autoantigens and lead to the development of autoimmune diseases such as SLE. Individuals with deficiencies in the early
complement components may also suffer from recurrent
infections by pyogenic (pus-forming) bacteria such as streptococci and staphylococci. These organisms are Gram-positive
and therefore are normally resistant to the lytic effects of the
MAC. Nevertheless, the early complement components can
help to mitigate such infections by mediating a localized
inflammatory response and opsonizing the bacteria.
A deficiency in MBL, the first component of the lectin
pathway, has been shown to be relatively common, and
results in serious pyrogenic (fever-inducing) infections in
babies and children. Children with MBL deficiency suffer
from respiratory tract infections. MBL deficiency is also
found with a frequency two to three times higher in SLE
patients than in normal subjects, and certain mutant forms of
MBP are found to be prevalent in chronic carriers of hepatitis
B. Deficiencies in factor D and properdin—early components
of the alternative pathway—appear to be associated with
Neisseria infections but not with immune-complex disease.
People with C3 deficiencies display the most severe clinical manifestations of any of the complement deficiency
patients, reflecting the central role of C3 in opsonization and
in the formation of the MAC. The first person identified with
a C3 deficiency was a child suffering from frequent, severe
bacterial infections leading to meningitis, bronchitis, and
pneumonia, who was initially diagnosed with agammaglobulinemia. After tests revealed normal immunoglobulin levels, a deficiency in C3 was discovered. This case highlighted
the critical function of the complement system in converting
a humoral antibody response into an effective defense mechanism. The majority of people with C3 deficiency have
recurrent bacterial infections and may also present with
immune-complex diseases.
Levels of C4 (one of the proteins operative very early in
the classical pathway) vary considerably in the population.
Specifically, the genes encoding C4 are located in the major
histocompatibility locus (see Chapter 8), and the number of
C4 genes may vary among individuals from two to six. Low
gene copy numbers are associated with lower levels of C4 in
plasma and with a correspondingly higher incidence of SLE,
for the reasons described above. Patients with complete

Innate Immunity

deficiencies of the components of the classical pathway such
as C4 suffer more frequent infections with bacteria such as
S. pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenza, and N. meningitidis.
However, even patients with low copy numbers of C4 appear
to be relatively well protected against such infections. Interestingly, C4 exists in two isoforms: C4A and C4B. C4B is
more effective in binding to the surfaces of the three bacterial
species mentioned above, and homozygous C4B deficiency
has been shown to result in a slightly higher incidence of
infection than is experienced by individuals with C4A deficiency, or those who are heterozygous for the two isoforms.
Individuals with deficiencies in members of the terminal
complement cascade are more likely than members of the
general population to suffer from meningococcal infections,
indicating that cytolysis by complement components C5-C9
is of particular relevance to the control of N. meningitidis.
This has resulted in the release of public health guidelines
that highlight the need for vaccinations against N. meningitidis for individuals deficient in the terminal complement
components.
Deficiencies of complement regulatory proteins have also
been reported. As described above, C1INH, the C1 inhibitor,
regulates activation of the classical pathway by preventing
excessive C4 and C2 activation by C1. However, as a serine
protease inhibitor, it also controls two serine proteases in the
blood clotting system. Therefore, patients with C1INH deficiency suffer from a complex disorder that includes excessive
production of vasoactive mediators (molecules that control
blood vessel diameter and integrity), which in turn leads to
tissue swelling and extracellular fluid accumulation. The
resultant clinical condition is referred to as hereditary angioedema. It presents clinically as localized tissue edema that
often follows trauma, but sometimes occurs with no known

TABLE 6-5

/Volumes/203/MHR00209/siL52070/disk1of1/0071052070

cause. The edema can be in subcutaneous tissues; within the
bowel, where it causes abdominal pain; or in the upper respiratory tract, where it can result in fatal obstruction of the
airway. C1INH deficiency is an autosomal dominant condition with a frequency of 1 in 1000 in the human population.
Studies in humans and experimental animals with homozygous deficiencies in complement components have provided important information regarding the roles of individual
complement components in immunity. These initial observations have been significantly enhanced by studies using
knockout mice, genetically engineered to lack expression of
specific complement components. Investigations of in vivo
complement activity in these animals has allowed dissection
of the complex system of complement proteins and the
assignment of precise biologic roles to each.

Microbial Complement
Evasion Strategies
The importance of complement in host defense is clearly
illustrated by the number and variety of strategies that have
evolved in microbes, enabling them to evade complement
attack (see Table 6-5). Gram-positive bacteria have developed thick cell walls and capsules that enable them to shrug
off the insertion of MAC complexes, while others escape into
intracellular vacuoles to escape immune detection. However,
these two general strategies are energy intensive for the
microbe, and many microbes have adopted other tactics to
escape complement-mediated destruction.
In Advances Box 6-3, we describe the multiple ways in
which Staphylococcus aureus, a major human pathogen, protects itself against complement-mediated destruction. In this

The Complement System
section, we address complement microbial evasion at a more
conceptual level, categorizing the approaches that microbes
have evolved to elude this effector arm of the immune
response.

Some Pathogens Interfere with the First Step
of Immunoglobulin-Mediated Complement
Activation
Many classes of viruses act at the beginning of the classical
complement pathway by synthesizing proteins and glycoproteins that specifically bind the Fc regions of antibodies, thus
preventing complement binding and the generation of the
classical pathway reactions. Some viruses also effect enhanced
clearance of antibody-antigen complexes from the surfaces of
virus-infected cells and/or manufacture proteins that induce
rapid internalization of viral protein-antibody complexes.

Microbial Proteins Bind and Inactivate
Complement Proteins
Since highly specific protein-protein interactions between
complement components are central to the functioning of
the cascade, it is logical that microbes have evolved mechanisms that interfere with some of these binding reactions.
Advances Box 6-3 describes those used by S. aureus, but the
strategy of inhibiting the interactions between complement
proteins is not restricted to bacteria. The production of molecules that inhibit the interactions between complement
components has also been detected in certain human parasites. Specifically, a protein generated by some species of
both Schistosoma and Trypanosoma, the complement C2
receptor trispanning protein, disrupts the interaction
between C2a and C4b and thus prevents the generation of
the classical pathway C3 convertase.

Microbial Proteases Destroy
Complement Proteins
Some microbes produce proteases that destroy complement
components. This strategy is utilized primarily by bacteria,
and numerous bacterial proteases exist that are capable of
digesting a variety of complement components. For example, elastase and alkaline protease proteins from Pseudomonas aeruginosa target the degradation of C1q and C3/C3b,
and two proteases derived from Streptococcal bacteria, scpA
and scpB, specifically attack the anaphylatoxin C5a. Streptococcal pyrogenic exotoxin B was found to degrade the complement regulator properdin, with resultant destabilization
of the alternative pathway C3 convertase on the bacterial
surface.
Fungi can also inactivate complement proteins. The
opportunistic human pathogen Aspergillus fumigatus
secretes an alkaline protease, Alp1, that is capable of cleaving
C3, C4, C5, and C1q, as well as IgG. Since this pathogen

tends to attack patients who are already immunocompromised, its capacity to further damage the immune system is
particularly troubling to the clinician.

Some Microbes Mimic or Bind Complement
Regulatory Proteins
Several microbial species have exploited the presence of cellsurface or soluble regulators of complement activity for their
own purposes, either by mimicking the effects of these regulators, or by acquiring them directly. Indeed, recent work
suggests that sequestration of host-derived regulators of
complement activity may be one of the most widely utilized
microbial mechanisms for complement evasion.
Many microbes have developed the ability to bind one or
another of the fluid phase inhibitors of complement, C4BP
or factor H. For example, Streptococcus pyogenes, an important human pathogen, expresses a family of proteins called
“M proteins” capable of binding to C4BP and factor H.
Expression of these regulatory proteins on the bacterial surface results in the inhibition of the later steps of complement
fixation.
More surprisingly, some microbes appear to acquire
membrane-bound regulators from host cells. Helicobacter
pylori, obtained from patients suffering from gastric ulcers,
was found to stain positive for Protectin, a potent host inhibitor of MAC complex formation. Protectin is normally
attached to the host membrane by a glycosylphosphatidyl
inositol anchor, and this anchor must be transferable in
some way from the host to the bacterial cell membrane.
Many viruses have evolved the capacity to produce proteins that closely mimic the structure and function of complement regulatory proteins. For example, the Variola
(smallpox) and Vaccinia (cowpox) viruses express complement inhibitory proteins that bind C3b and C4b and serve as
cofactors for factor I, thus preventing complement activation
at the viral membrane. In addition to generating complement regulatory proteins, it should be noted that some
viruses actively induce regulatory complement components
within the cells that harbor them. Other viruses camouflage
themselves during budding from the host cell by hiding
within regions of the host membrane on which regulatory
complement components are expressed. And finally, some
viruses mimic eukaryotic membranes by incorporating high
levels of sialic acid into the viral membrane, thus facilitating
the binding of the cofactors for factor I that normally bind
only to host cell membranes. This therefore results in the
inhibition of complement activation on the viral surface.

The Evolutionary Origins of the
Complement System
Although the complement system was initially characterized
by its ability to convert antibody binding into pathogen
lysis, studies of complement evolution have identified the

components of the lytic MAC as relatively late additions to
the animal genome. Long before the emergence of the adaptive immune system, complement components provided
invertebrate organisms with an important advance on the
peptide-based humoral immunity previously available to
them (see Chapter 5). Activation of complement cascades in
invertebrates and early vertebrates most likely culminated in
opsonization and phagocytosis by primitive hemocytes. It
appears probable that, among the non-MAC complement
components, the proteins of the alternative pathway were the
first to appear, followed by those of the lectin recognition
systems. A fully fledged MAC emerged only around the
same time as the appearance of the adaptive immune system
(see Figure 6-17 and Table 6-6).

Mechanisms by which S. aureus avoids
opsonophagocytosis. (1) The capsular polysaccharides denies access of neutrophils to opsonized

(4) Staphylokinase (Sak), secreted by the bacterium,

binds factor I and localizes it to the microbial surface,
where it cleaves and inactivates any C3b that binds
there. [Adapted from Foster, T. J., 2005. Immune evasion by
Staphylococci. Nature Reviews Microbiology 3: 948–958, Figure 3.]

Genomic analysis has classified complement components
into five gene families, each of which possesses unique
domain structures that have enabled investigators to trace
their phylogenetic origins. The first of these gene families
encodes C1q, mannose-binding lectin (MBL), and ficolins.
Genes for prototypical C1q molecules have been identified
in species as primitive as lampreys (the jawless fishlike vertebrate; Phylum Chordata, Subphylum Vertebrata), sea
urchins (Phylum Echinodermata, Subphylum Echinozoa),
and ascidians (Phylum Chordata, Subphylum Urochordata).
Analysis of C1q gene clusters in different species has demonstrated that C1q genes appeared prior to the generation of
immunoglobulin genes, and that at least some of these C1q
proteins bind to specific carbohydrates, implying that they

the complement cascade. A second protein secreted by S. aureus, the Extracellular Fibrinogen-Binding protein (Efb),
binds C3, thus preventing its deposition
on the bacterial cell surface (2). But if the
immune system succeeds in depositing
C3, in spite of all these evasive actions by
the bacterium, S. aureus has evolved the
capacity to manufacture other proteins
to destroy it. Recently, a metalloproteinase enzyme, aureolysin, has been shown
to be secreted by S. aureus. Aureolysin
cleaves C3 in such a manner that it is then
further degraded and inactivated by host
regulatory proteins.
Other mechanisms interfere with the
ability of antibodies to initiate the complement cascade. Staphylococcal protein
A (SpA) is anchored into the carbohydrate cell wall, and possesses four or five
extracellular domains, each of which is
capable of binding to the Fc portion of a
molecule of IgG, thus effectively blocking effector functions of the antibody
molecules, including complement activation (3). In addition, S. aureus secretes
an enzyme called Staphylokinase (SAK)
that attaches to the bacterial surface and
binds to plasminogen, the host cell
plasma zymogen, activating it upon
binding (4). The activated plasminogen
has a serine protease activity that cleaves
and releases any surface-bound IgG and
C3b.

The S. aureus protein Sbi, which is
found both in association with the bacterial cell and in solution, contains two
immunoglobulin-binding domains and
two other domains that bind to the C3
complement component. The cellassociated Sbi has been demonstrated
to be capable of preventing Fc-mediated
protective functions such as opsonization and complement activation, by
blocking complement, or Fc receptor
binding, to the IgG constant regions. In
addition, the portion of the Sbi protein
that is released into the extracellular
fluid has also been shown to be protective for the bacterium. Although the
precise nature of the protective mechanism is still being investigated, it is
thought to result from the depletion of
complement components in the vicinity of the bacterium.
S. aureus has also evolved mechanisms that take advantage of host complement control strategies. A bacterial
cell-surface protein, Clumping factor A
(ClfA) is able to bind factor I, thus localizing it to the bacterial surface, where it
cleaves and inactivates any C3b that has
bound there (5). Another complement
inhibitory protein secreted by S. aureus
acts in a slightly different way. The Chemotaxis Inhibitory Protein of S. aureus
(CHIPs) binds two chemotactic receptors
on neutrophils, the C5a receptor, and

are potentially able to discriminate between host and pathogen. Thus, C1q may have expressed the capacity to recognize
foreign molecules at a very early point in time, independent
of antibody binding and in a manner similar to that of MBL.
Mannose-binding lectins have been identified in lampreys,
thus placing the origin of the MBLs at least as far back as the
early vertebrates. Indeed, functional lectin pathways have
been characterized in ascidians. However, although genes
encoding MBL-like proteins have been characterized in
ascidian genomes, the nature of their relationship to vertebrate MBL proteins is still unclear.
The next three gene families to be considered all encode
proteins that are implicated in the cleavage of the C3, C4,
and C5 components of complement. The first of these fami-

the formylated peptide receptor, thus
effectively eliminating the capacity of
neutrophils to respond to C5a-mediated
chemotactic signals. Other Staphylococcal proteins are active in the inhibition of
neutrophil binding to the membrane
surfaces of the endothelial cells lining
blood capillaries, and thus retard the
extravasation of neutrophils in the vicinity of a local infection.
The variety and effectiveness of these
inhibitory mechanisms that have evolved
in just one strain of bacteria emphasize for
us the importance of the complement
system in the normal control of bacterial
infections, and the complexity that
researchers and clinicians face when
attempting to develop the next generation of antibacterial therapies.

the second family comprises the serine proteases MASP-1,
MASP-2, MASP-3, C1r, and C1s; and the third family contains the C3 family members C3, C4, and C5, which are not
themselves proteases, but which share a common internal
thioester and are subject to protease cleavage and activation.
Studies of a number of invertebrate species have indicated
that the genome of each species contains only a single copy
representative of each of these three gene families. In contrast,
one or more gene duplication events have occurred within each
gene family in most vertebrates, suggesting that the gene duplications found in vertebrates probably occurred in the early
stages of jawed vertebrate evolution. Genes for each of the

The Complement System
invertebrate deuterostomes that have so far been analyzed,
with the single exception of the MASP family gene, which is
missing from the sea urchin (Phylum Echinodermata) genome.
The situation in protostomes is somewhat more complicated. Whereas members of the C3 and Bf families have been
identified in some very early protostomes—for example, the
horseshoe crab and the carpet-shell clam (Phyla: Arthropoda and Mollusca respectively)—analysis of whole genome
sequences of insects such as Drosophila melanogaster
(Arthropoda) or the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans
(Nematoda) have failed to locate any proto-complement
protein sequences. This contrasts starkly with the presence
of all three family genes in sea anemones and corals (Phylum, Cnidaria), and suggests that the ability to encode proteins of the complement system has been lost from the
genome of the common, model-system protostomes D.
melanogaster and C. elegans. The absence of genes encoding
any of the later, cytolytic components of the complement
cascade in protostomes and cnidarians supports the hypothesis that the proto-complement systems of cnidarians and
protostomes function by opsonization.
The proteins encoded by the fifth gene family, C6, C7,
C8␣, C8␤␥, and C9, together make up the terminal complement complex (TCC). They share a unique domain structure
that enables molecular phylogenetic analysis. In particular,
the mammalian TCCs, C6, C7, C8␣, C8␤␥, and C9 all share
the MAC/perforin (MACPF) domain, in addition to other
domains common among two or more members of this protein group. Mammals, birds, and amphibians share all TCC
genes (with the exception of the bird C9 gene, which is miss-

ing from the chicken genome sequence). Although the full
complement of MAC proteins has not yet been documented
in cartilaginous fishes such as the sharks (the earliest known
organisms to possess an adaptive immune system), a gene
encoding a C8␣ subunit orthologous to mammalian C8␣
has been cloned and characterized. Furthermore, the serum
of sharks has been known for decades to express hemolytic
activity, and microscopic analysis of the pores formed on
target cell surfaces reveals a transmembrane pore structure
indistinguishable from that induced by a MAC attack. It thus
seems likely that the functionality of the MAC emerged not
long after the adaptive immune system.
Genomic analysis has traced the origin of the TCC genes
back to before the divergence of the urochordates, cephalochordates, and vertebrates (see Figure 6-17) as ascidians
(urochordates) and amphioxus (cephalochordates) possess
primitive copies of TCC genes. However, the ascidian and
amphioxus TCC proteins could not have functioned in a
manner similar to that of later vertebrate species because
they lack the domain responsible for interacting with the C5
protein. Intriguingly, toxins of the venomous sea anemone,
which express a very high hemolytic potential, are closest in
structure to the TCCs of the complement pathway.
In summary, complement evolution is based on the diversification and successive duplications of members of five
gene families that evolved first in response to the need for
microbial recognition and opsonization and then responded
to the appearance of the adaptive immune system by additional gene duplication and functional adaptation to form
the complement system as we know it today.

The complement system comprises a group of serum proteins, many of which circulate in inactive forms that must
first be cleaved or undergo conformational changes prior
to activation.
Complement proteins include initiator molecules, enzymatic mediators, membrane-binding components or opsonins, inflammatory mediators, membrane attack proteins,
complement receptor proteins, and regulatory components.
Complement activation occurs by three pathways—classical,
lectin, and alternative—which converge in a common
sequence of events leading to membrane lysis.
The classical pathway is initiated by antibodies of the IgM
or IgG classes binding to a multivalent antigen. This allows
binding of the first component of complement, C1q, and
begins the process of complement deposition.
The lectin pathway is initiated by binding of lectins such as
mannose-binding lectin or members of the ficolin family
to microbial surface carbohydrates.
The alternative pathway is initiated when the third component of complement, C3, undergoes nonspecific break-

down. C3b is formed and adheres to a cell surface.
Inadvertent initiation is prevented by the presence of control proteins on host cell membranes.
The end result of the initiating sequence of all three pathways is the generation of enzymes that cleave C3 into C3a
and C3b, and C5 into C5a and C5b.
C3b opsonizes microbial cells and immune complexes,
rendering them suitable for phagocytosis.
Activation of the terminal components of the complement
cascade C5b, C6, C7, C8 and C9 results in the deposition
of a membrane attack complex (MAC) onto the microbial
cell membrane. This complex introduces large pores in the
membrane, preventing it from maintaining osmotic integrity and resulting in the death of the cell.
Binding of the complement component C1q to apoptotic
cells, apoptotic bodies, and immune complexes results in
their opsonization with C3b and subsequent phagocytosis.
Patients deficient in the early complement components do
not clear apoptotic cells efficiently and suffer disproportionally from autoimmune disease such as SLE.

Innate Immunity

■

In addition to acting during host defense against infection,
complement proteins also bind to receptors on the surfaces
of antigen-presenting cells, T cells, and B cells, inducing
interleukin production and aiding in their activation.

■

A system of regulatory complement proteins ensures that
inadvertent complement activation on the surface of host
cells is prevented and controlled, by deactivating complement components on the surface of host cells, and ensuring that regulatory proteins are bound specifically to host,
but not to microbial cell membranes.
Patients suffering from complement deficiencies often
present with immune complex disorders and suffer disproportionally from infections by encapsulated bacteria
such as Neisseria meningitidis. Animal models exist for
most complement deficiencies.

■

Underscoring the importance of complement in the
immune system, a broad variety of complement evasion
strategies has evolved in viruses, bacteria, fungi, and
parasites, including mimicking regulatory proteins, interfering with the interactions between antibodies and
complement components, or between proteins of the
complement pathways, or by destruction of the complement components.

■

The genes encoding complement components belong to
five families. Genes of the alternative pathway components appear first in evolution, and those encoding the
terminal complement components appear last. Thus,
prior to the emergence of adaptive immunity, complement served its protective functions by mediating
phagocytosis.

o protect its host, the immune system must
recognize a vast array of rapidly evolving
microorganisms. To accomplish this, it must
generate a diverse and flexible repertoire of
receptor molecules, while minimizing the expression of
receptors that recognize self antigens. As described in
Chapter 3, each B or T lymphocyte expresses a unique
antigen-specific receptor. When these receptors bind to
their corresponding antigens under the appropriate
conditions (described in Chapters 11 and 12), T and B
lymphocytes proliferate and differentiate into effector
cells that eliminate the microbial threat (Chapter 13).
In Chapter 3, we described the biochemistry of the T
and B lymphocyte receptors and the secreted antibodies
formed by B lymphocytes following antigen stimulation.
We also outlined the experiments which demonstrated
that secreted antibodies are identical in antigen-binding
specificity to the B-cell receptors of the secreting cell. In
this chapter, we address the question of how an organism
can encode and express receptors capable of recognizing a
constantly evolving universe of microbial threats using a
finite amount of genetic information.
The production of specific lymphocyte receptors
employs a number of genetic mechanisms that are unique
to the immune system. In 1987, Susumu Tonegawa won
the Nobel Prize for Physiology or Medicine “for his
discovery of the genetic principle for generation of
antibody diversity,” a discovery that challenged the
fundamental concept that one gene encoded one
polypeptide chain. Tonegawa and his colleagues showed
that the antibody light chain was encoded in the germ line
by not one but three families of gene segments separated by
kilobases of DNA (Figure 7-1). (The germ-line DNA is the
genetic information encoded in the sperm and egg, which
can be passed on to future generations.) Their work
demonstrated that two DNA segments, one from each
family, are conjoined, only in B lymphocytes, to create the
mature form of the light-chain variable region of the
immunoglobulin (Ig) gene. A third segment encodes the
constant region of the gene. Different combinations of

The Recombination Signal Sequence (RSS)
serves as the site of DNA cleavage. The RSS is
composed of conserved heptamer and

region of 12 or 23 bp, which is conserved in
length, but not in sequence. Cleavage occurs
at the junction of the heptamer and the
variable region coding segment. [Adapted from

segments are used in each B cell, to create the diverse
repertoire of light-chain receptor genes. Subsequent
experiments have shown that all of the B- and T-cell
receptor genes are assembled from multiple gene
segments by similar rearrangements.
We describe below the unique genetic arrangements of
T- and B-cell receptor gene segments, and the
mechanisms by which they are rearranged and expressed.
We will address here only those mechanisms that shape
the receptor repertoires of mouse and human naïve B and
T cells, which have not yet been exposed to antigen.

FIGURE 7-1 The antibody light-chain gene encodes three
families of DNA segments. During B-cell development, one V segment and one J segment (which encode contiguous parts of the
light-chain variable region) join together with the C (constant) region
to form the gene for the antibody light chain. This gene rearrangement occurs in the DNA, prior to gene transcription into mRNA.

Additional layers of diversity are generated in B cells
following antigen exposure and those will be addressed in
Chapter 12. These powerful mechanisms include the
generation of antibodies of different heavy-chain classes,
each capable of mediating a discrete set of effector
functions, as well as the creation of modified antigenbinding regions by somatic hypermutation, followed by
antigen-driven selection. Both of these processes are
triggered in human and mouse B cells only after antigen
contact.

The Puzzle of Immunoglobulin
Gene Structure
The immune system relies on a vast array of B-cell receptors
(BCRs) that possess the ability to bind specifically to a correspondingly large number of potential pathogens. The first
indication of the immense size of the antibody repertoire was
provided by immunologists using synthetic molecules to
stimulate antibody production. They discovered that antibodies can discriminate between small synthetic molecules
differing in as little as the position of an amino or hydroxyl
group on a phenyl ring. If the immune system can discriminate between small molecules that it had presumably never
encountered during evolutionary selection and that differ in
such subtle ways, then, it was reasoned, the number of potential antibodies must be very large indeed. A series of experiments conducted in the late 1970s and early 1980s estimated
the number of different BCRs generated in a normal mouse
immune system to be at least 107, but we now know that estimate was many orders of magnitude too small.
Investigators trying to make sense of Ig genetics were also
faced with an additional puzzle: protein sequencing of mouse
and human antibody heavy and light chains revealed that the
first (amino terminal) 110 amino acids of antibody heavy and
light chains are extremely variable among different antibody
molecules. This region was therefore defined as the variable
(V) region of the antibody molecule. In contrast, the remainder of the light and heavy chains could be classified into one

FIGURE 7-2 Early sequencing studies indicated that the
light chain may be encoded in more than one segment.
(a) Many Ig variable regions in both heavy and light chains could be
found in association with few constant regions. (b) The same variable
region can be found in contiguity with several different heavy-chain
constant regions.
of only four sequences (light chain) or eight sequences (heavy
chain) (Figure 7-2a) and was, therefore, named the constant
(C) region. This raised an intriguing question: If each of 105
to 107 antibodies is encoded by a separate gene, how could
the constant region part of the gene remain constant in
sequence in the face of evolutionary drift?
Furthermore, antibodies could be found in which the
same antibody variable (V) region was associated with more
than one heavy-chain constant (C) region (Figure 7-2b),
lending further support to the possibility that the expression
of the variable and constant regions of each antibody chain
were independently controlled. (These additional constant
regions are generated by the antigen-induced process of class
switch recombination, discussed in Chapter 12. In the current context, the only point of relevance is the independence
with which the variable and constant regions appear to be
expressed.) It was rapidly becoming clear that the solution to
the antibody gene puzzle was more complex than had previously been imagined.

Investigators Proposed Two Early Theoretical
Models of Antibody Genetics
Classical germ-line theories of antibody diversity suggested
that the genetic information for each antibody is encoded, in
its entirety, within the germ-line genome. This means that
the genes encoding the entire sequence of every antibody
heavy or light chain that the animal could ever make must be
present in every cell. However, a quick calculation is sufficient to demonstrate that if there are 107 or more antibodies,
each of which requires approximately 2,000 nucleotides, this
would require massive expenditure of genetic information—
indeed, more DNA would be required to encode the receptors of the immune system than is available to the organism.
Although arguments were initially made that the dedication
of a considerable fraction of the genome to the immune system may represent a reasonable evolutionary strategy, it

The Organization and Expression of Lymphocyte Receptor Genes
became clear, as estimates of the size of the antibody repertoire were revised upward, that there simply was not enough
DNA to go around and new ideas must be found.
In 1965, William Dreyer and J. Claude Bennett proposed
that antibody heavy and light chains are each encoded in two
separate segments in the germ-line genome and that one of
each of the V region- and C region-encoding segments are
brought together in B-cell DNA to form complete antibody
heavy and light-chain genes. The idea that DNA in somatic
cells might engage in recombinatorial activity was revolutionary. However, germ-line theorists began to modify their
ideas to embrace this possibility.
Others suggested the equally innovative idea that the
number of variable region genes in the genome might be
extremely limited, and proposed the somatic hypermutation theory. According to this hypothesis, a limited number
of antibody genes is acted upon by unknown mutational
mechanisms in somatic cells to generate a diverse receptor
repertoire in mature B lymphocytes. This latter idea had the
advantage of explaining how a large repertoire of antibodies
could be generated from a relatively small number of genes,
but the disadvantage that such a process, like the somatic cell
gene recombination suggested by others, had never been
observed. There was additional argument over whether
mutation would occur prior to, or only after, antigen contact
and, therefore, whether mutation was responsible for generation of the so-called “primary repertoire” that exists prior
to antigen binding by the B cell.

CHAPTER 7

227

Heated debate continued between the proponents of
modified germ-line versus somatic mutation theories
throughout the early 1970s, until a seminal set of experiments revealed that both sides were correct. We now know
that each antibody molecule is encoded by multiple, germline, variable-region gene segments, which are rearranged
differently in each naïve immune cell to produce a diverse
primary receptor repertoire. These rearranged genes are
then further acted upon after antigen encounter by somatic
hypermutation and antigenic selection, resulting in an
expanded and exquisitely honed repertoire of antigenspecific B cells (see Chapter 12).

Breakthrough Experiments Revealed
That Multiple Gene Segments Encode
the Light Chain
From the mid 1970s until the mid 1980s, a small group of
brilliant immunologists completed a series of experiments
that fundamentally altered the way in which scientists think
about the genetics of immune receptor molecules. The first
breakthrough occurred when Susumu Tonegawa showed, as
Dreyer and Bennett had predicted, that multiple gene segments encode the antibody light chain. His achievement is
all the more impressive because the modern tools of molecular biology were not yet available. The experiment he performed with Nobumichi Hozumi is described in Classic
Experiment Box 7-1.

BOX 7-1

CLASSIC EXPERIMENT

Hozumi and Tonegawa’s Experiment: DNA Recombination Occurs
in immunoglobulin Genes in Somatic Cells
The

paradigm-shifting

experiment of Hozumi and Tonegawa was
designed to determine whether the DNA
encoding Ig light-chain constant and variable regions existed in separate segments
in non antibody-producing cells, such that
a single constant region gene could associate with different variable region genes in
different B cells. They hypothesized that
this might be the case, because of Ig amino
acid sequencing data showing that the
sequences of the constant regions of many
Ig light chains were identical. They reasoned that if multiple copies of a constant
region gene existed, then each copy would
be expected to accumulate silent or neutral mutations over time. The most likely
explanation for the finding of a single con-

stant region amino acid sequence arranged
in tandem with many different variable
regions was, therefore, that a single constant region gene segment was cooperating with multiple variable region gene
segments in different cells or situations to
generate the light-chain gene. However,
this notion was heretical to a generation of
scientists brought up on the concept that
one gene encodes one polypeptide chain.
Scientists are accustomed to thinking
about the concept of alternative RNA
splicing, wherein different proteins may
be encoded by the same piece of DNA by
differentially using particular RNA segments, cut and spliced following transcription of a long precursor RNA
transcript. However, this experiment

asked an entirely new question: Can a
piece of DNA change its place on a chromosome in a somatic cell?
To serve as their source of germ-line
DNA, Hozumi and Tonegawa used DNA
from an organ in which Ig genes would not
be expressed, embryonic liver in this case.
(Sperm and egg DNA would have been
much more difficult to obtain.) For B-cell
DNA, they used DNA from an antibodyproducing plasma cell tumor line, MOPC
321, which secretes fully functional  light
chains. They separately cut both sets of DNA
with the same restriction enzyme and used
radioactive probes to determine the sizes of
the DNA fragments on which the variable
and constant regions of the light-chain
gene were found in the two sets of cells.

Below, we describe how Hozumi and
Tonegawa conducted their experiment,
and indicate how the experimental protocol would be modified using the reagents
and techniques available to a modern
molecular biologist. We then display their
data as it would appear both in the modern gel format as well as in its original form.
Hozumi and Tonegawa:
a. Purified genomic DNA from embryonic liver cells and from the MOPC
321 tumor cell line.
b. Cut the two sets of genomic DNA
with a restriction endonuclease
(BamHI) and separated the DNA
fragments using electrophoresis.
(Today we would use a polyacrylamide gel and electrophorese submicrogram quantities of samples
over the course of a few hours;
Hozumi and Tonegawa used a footlong agarose gel that needed 2
liters of agarose. They loaded 5 mg
of DNA and ran the gel for 3 days.)
c. Made 125I-labeled nucleic acid
probes specific for the two regions
of mouse  light chain. One of
Tonegawa’s probes was a full-length
radiolabeled piece of mRNA encoding the entire -chain sequence. The
other probe was the 3 half of the
sequence, which would hybridize to
the constant, but not to the variable
region of the -chain gene. Today,
making enzymatically labeled, stable
DNA probes for any particular
sequence is a safe and relatively
straightforward task. In Hozumi and
Tonegawa’s day, this task was significantly more challenging.
d. Probed the nuclease-generated
DNA fragments to determine the
size of the fragments carrying the
variable and constant region
sequences. We would normally use
a Southern blot procedure, electrophoresing the fragments, blotting
the gel with nitrocellulose paper,
and then probing the paper with
enzyme-labeled fragments complementary to the sequences of
interest, developing the blots with

The  light-chain gene is formed by DNA recombination between variable and constant

luminescent or fluorescent substrates. Hozumi and Tonegawa’s
approach was much more timeconsuming. They cut the gel into
about 30 slices, melted the agarose,
and separately eluted the DNA
from each slice. To each DNA sample, they added radiolabeled RNA,

allowed it to anneal, and removed
the un-annealed RNA using RNase.
The radioactivity remaining in each
fraction was then plotted against
the size of the DNA in the slice.

blot of Tonegawa’s fragments. The germline DNA blot probed with the constant
region mRNA sequence probe (lane 1)
shows only a single band. This indicates
that the restriction endonuclease is not
cutting in the middle of the light-chain
constant region, but rather that the whole
constant region sequence is encoded
within a single fragment.
In contrast, probing the blot with the
whole light-chain sequence (V and C,
lane 2) yields two bands. Since the difference between lanes 1 and 2 is the presence of the variable region sequence in
the probe used for lane 2, the presence of
two bands in lane 2 indicates that the
restriction endonuclease used to generate
the DNA fragments is cutting somewhere
in between the variable and constant
regions in the germ-line DNA, such that
the variable region lies on a DNA fragment distinct from that bearing the constant region.
Analyzing the blots from the plasma
cell tumor, we first note that the large
fragment containing the constant region
DNA and the midsized fragment bearing
the variable region DNA have disappeared. Both the variable and constant
region gene segments are now located
on smaller fragments. This implies that a
new pair of restriction endonuclease sites
now forms the boundaries of each of the
constant and variable region fragments.
Right away, we can tell that the DNA environment around the light-chain genes
changes as the B cell differentiates.
Next, we note that the sizes of the
DNA fragments on which the constant
and variable region gene segments are
located are apparently the same. This
implies, although it does not yet prove,
that the movement of the constant and/
or variable region gene segments has
brought them into close proximity with
one another, such that the constant and
variable region gene segments co-locate
on the same fragment. An alternative
explanation is that they have both altered
their locations and the similarity in the
size of the fragments is coincidental.
DNA sequencing supported the former

FIGURE 2
The original data from Hozumi and Tonegawa’s classic experiment
proving immunoglobulin gene recombination occurs in B cells.
DNA from the sources shown was run out on an agarose gel for 3 days at
4C. The gel was sliced, the DNA eluted, and then each sample was hybridized with radiolabeled probes for either the constant region of the  light
chain, or the whole chain. The plot shows the amount of radioactivity in
each fraction as a function of the migration distance, which reflects the
molecular weight of the DNA fragment. (See text for details.) [ From N.

Academy of Sciences USA 73:3628–3632.]

interpretation: as the B cell differentiates,
the variable and constant region gene segments are moved from distant regions of the
chromosome into close apposition with one
another.
It is all too easy, with modern molecular biology technologies, to forget what a
tour de force this experiment actually
represented. Few of the reagents or pieces
of apparatus we commonly encounter in
the molecular biology laboratory today
were available to Hozumi and Tonegawa—
they had to make their own.
The original paper speaks of purifying
their own restriction endonuclease
(BamHI) from a bacterial sample obtained
from a colleague, and of performing the
electrophoresis at 4oC for 3 days. Furthermore, technical difficulties precluded their
being able to make a good 5 (V-region)
probe. They therefore probed each sample

with a 3 (C-region) probe, as well as one
that bound to the whole light chain, and
then inferred 5 (V-region) binding by
subtraction. It was an extraordinary piece
of work. Their original data are shown in
Figure 2.
What happened to the DNA on the
alternative allele that did not encode the
tumor cell secreted light chain? Subsequent analysis of the DNA from this tumor
showed that the DNA from both chromosomes had undergone rearrangement.
Hozumi and Tonegawa were fortunate
that the variable regions used by both
rearrangements were close to one another
and so the fragment patterns overlapped.

Adaptive Immunity: Antigen Receptors and MHC

Tonegawa’s experiment showed that, in the DNA from
non-antibody-producing, embryonic liver cells, there is a
BamHI endonuclease site between the variable and constant
regions. We know this because probes for the variable and
constant regions each recognized a different DNA fragment
in BamHI-digested germ-line DNA. However, in the antibodyproducing tumor cell, the DNA encoding the variable and
constant regions appeared to be combined in just one fragment, thus demonstrating that DNA rearrangement must
have occurred during the formation of an antibody lightchain gene (see Classic Experiment Box 7-1 for further
details).
Although this experiment demonstrated that the V and C
regions of antibody genes were located in different contexts
in the DNA of non-antibody-producing cells, it did not
speak to their relative locations; indeed, the initial experiment did not rule out the possibility that the V and C fragments could be encoded on different chromosomes in the
embryonic cells. However, sequencing experiments subsequently showed that the segments encoding the V and C
genes of the  light chains are on the same chromosome and
that, in non B cells, the two segments are separated by a long
non-coding DNA sequence.
The impact of this result on the biological community
was profound. For the first time, DNA was shown to be cut
and rejoined during the process of cell differentiation. This
experiment not only provided the experimental proof of
Dreyer and Bennett’s prediction; it also paved the way for the
next surprising finding.
Tonegawa’s experiment had identified the V and C segments encoding the kappa light chain. However, when scientists in his group sequenced the antibody light-chain DNA,
they encountered another unexpected result. As expected,
the embryonic (unrearranged) V region segment had, at its
5 terminus, a short hydrophobic leader sequence, a common feature of membrane proteins necessary to guide the
nascent protein chain into the membrane (Figure 7-3a). A 93
bp sequence of non-coding DNA separated the leader
sequence from a long stretch of DNA that encoded the first
97 amino acids of the V region. But the light-chain V region

domain is approximately 110 amino acids long. Where was
the coding information for the remaining 13 amino acids?
Sequencing of the light-chain constant region fragment
from embryonic DNA provided the answer. Upstream from
the constant region coding sequence, and separated from it
by a non-coding DNA segment of 1250 bp, were the 39 bp
encoding the remaining 13 amino acids of the V region. This
additional light-chain coding segment was named the joining (J) gene segment (shown in red in Figure 7-3a). Further
sequencing of mouse and human light-chain variable and
constant region genes confirmed Tonegawa’s second, astonishing finding. Not only are the variable and constant
regions encoded in two separate segments, but the lightchain variable regions themselves are encoded in two separate gene segments, the V and J segments, that are made
contiguous only in antibody-producing cells.
The heavy-chain variable region gene was then shown to
require yet a third genetic segment. Adopting a similar
strategy of cloning and sequencing Ig heavy-chain genes,
Lee Hood’s group identified a germ-line Heavy-chain Variable Region (VH) gene fragment that encoded amino acid
residues 1–101 of the antibody heavy chain and a second
fragment that included a Heavy-chain Joining gene segment (JH) that determined the sequence of amino acid residues 107–123. Neither of these segments contained the
DNA sequence necessary to encode residues 102–106 of the
heavy chain. Significantly, these missing residues were
included in the third complementarity-determining region
of the antibody heavy chain, CDR3, which provides contact
residues in the binding of most antigens (see Chapter 3).
Gene segments encoding this part of the antibody heavy
chain were eventually located 5 of the J region in mouse
embryonic DNA by Hood and colleagues (Figure 7-3b). The
importance of the contribution made by this gene segment
to the diversity of antibody specificities is denoted by its
name; the Diversity (D) region. (Because there is no D
region in the light chain, immunologists usually drop the
subscript denoting the heavy chain.)
Thus, the variable region of the heavy chain of the antibody molecule is encoded by three discrete gene segments,

The mouse Ig locus spans 3.5 Mb and includes 91 potentially
functional V genes, which have been grouped into 18 V gene
families based on sequence homology (Figure 7-4a). (If two
sequences are greater than 80% identical, they are classified as
belonging to the same V gene family.) These V gene families
can be further grouped into V gene clans, based again on
sequence homology. Each V segment includes the leader
exon encoding the signal peptide. Individual V segments are
separated by non-coding gaps of 5 to 100 kb. The transcriptional orientation of particular V segments may be in the
same or in the opposite direction as the constant region segment. The relative orientations of the variable and constant
region segments do not affect the use of the segments, but do
alter some details of the recombinational mechanism that creates the complete light-chain gene, as will be discussed later.
Downstream of the V region cluster are four functional
J segments and one pseudogene, or other nonfunctional
open reading frame (Table 7-2). A similar arrangement is
found in the human V locus, although the numbers of V
and J gene segments vary. A single C segment is found
downstream of the J region, and all kappa light-chain constant regions are encoded by this segment.

and the variable region of the light chain by two segments, in
the germ-line genome. These segments are brought together
by a process of DNA recombination that occurs only in the
B lymphocyte lineage to create the complete variable region
gene. Furthermore, the DNA at the junction between the
V and J segments for light chains, and at the VD and DJ
junctions in heavy chains, accounts for the extraordinary
diversity that was first observed by Kabat and Wu in the
CDR3 regions of both heavy and light chains (see Chapter 3).
Below, we will describe how further genetic diversity is generated at these junctions by additional processes unique to
immune system genetics.

Recall that Ig proteins consist of two identical heavy chains
and two identical light chains (see Chapter 3). The light chains
can be either kappa () light chains or lambda () light
chains. The heavy-chain, kappa, and lambda gene families are
each encoded on separate chromosomes (Table 7-1).

The mouse Ig locus spans a region of approximately 190 kb.
Lambda light chains are only found in 5% of mouse antibodies
because of a deletional event in the mouse genome that has
eliminated most of the lambda light-chain variable region
segments. It was therefore not surprising to discover that

there are only three fully functional V␭ gene segments,
although this number varies somewhat by strain (see Table
7-2). Interestingly, there are also three fully functional 
chain constant regions, each one associated with its own J
region segment (Figure 7-4b). The J-C4 segments are not
expressed because of a splice site defect.
Since recombination of Ig gene segments always occurs in
the downstream direction (V to J), the location of the V1
variable region sequence upstream of the JC3 and JC1 segments but downstream from JC2 means that V1 is always
expressed with either JC3 or JC1 but never with JC2. For
the same reason, V2 is usually associated with the JC2
pairing, although occasional pairings of V2 with the 190 kb
distant JC1 segments have been observed.
In humans, 40% of light chains are of the  type and
about 30 V-chain gene segments are used in mature antibody light chains (see Table 7-2). Downstream from the
human V locus is a series of seven JC pairs, of which four
pairs are fully functional.

mouse strains). Just 0.7 kb downstream of the most 3 D segment is the JH region cluster, which contains four functional
JH regions. A further gap separates the last JH segment from
the first constant region exon, C1.
The human VH locus has a similar arrangement with
approximately 30 functional D segments, and 6 functional JH
segments. Human D regions can be read in all three reading
frames, whereas mouse D regions are mainly read in reading
frame 1, because of the presence of stop codons in reading
frames 2 and 3 in most mouse D regions.
The eight constant regions of antibody heavy chains are
encoded in a span of 200 kb of DNA downstream from the
JH locus, as illustrated in Figure 7-4c. Recall that the constant
regions of antibodies determine their heavy-chain class and,
ultimately, their effector functions (see Chapter 13).

Heavy-Chain Gene Organization Includes VH,
D, JH, and CH Segments

In V(D)J recombination, the DNA encoding a complete
antibody V-region is assembled from V, D, and J (heavy
chain) or V and J (light chain) segments that are initially
separated by many kilobases of DNA. Each developing B cell
generates a novel pair of variable region genes by recombination at the level of genomic DNA. Recombination is catalyzed by a set of enzymes, many of which are also involved
in DNA repair functions (Table 7-3), and is directed to the
appropriate sites on the Ig gene by recognition of specific
DNA sequence motifs called Recombination Signal
Sequences (RSSs). These sequences ensure that one of each

Multiple VH gene segments lie across a region of approximately 3.0 Mb in both mice and humans (Figure 7-4c).
These segments can be classified, like V segments, into
families of homologous sequences. Humans express at least
38 functional VH segments and mice approximately 101 (see
Table 7-2). Downstream from the cluster of mouse VH
region segments is an 80 kb region containing approximately
14 D regions (the actual number varies among different

Recombination Is Directed by Signal Sequences
If recombination is to occur in the DNA of every lymphocyte, then a mechanism must exist to ensure that it only
occurs in antibody and T-cell receptor genes, and that the
moving DNA segments end up exactly where they should be
in the genome. Otherwise, dire consequences, including
malignancy, can ensue.
In the late 1970s, investigators working with light-chain
genes, described two blocks of conserved sequences—a
nonamer (a set of nine base pairs) and a heptamer (a set of
seven base pairs)—that are highly conserved and occur in
the noncoding regions upstream of each J segment. The heptamer appeared to end exactly at the J region coding
sequence. Further sequencing showed that the same motif
was repeated in an inverted manner on the downstream side
of the V region coding sequences, again with the heptamer
sequence ending flush with the V-region gene segment
(Figure 7-5a).
A further noteworthy feature of these sequences was the
presence of a spacer sequence of either 12 or 23 bp between
the heptamer and the nonamer. The significance of the
spacer lengths was clear; they represented one, or two, turns

FIGURE 7-6 Recombination between gene segments is
required to generate a complete light chain gene. (a) Recombination between a V region (in this case, V3) and a J region (in this
case J3) generates a single VC light-chain gene in each B cell. The
recombinase enzymes recognize the RSS downstream of the V
region (orange triangle) and upstream of the J region (brown triangle). In every case, an RSS with a 12-bp (one-turn) spacer is paired

with an RSS with a 23-bp (two-turn) spacer. This ensures that there is
no inadvertent V-V or J-J joining. (b) Recombination of V (blue), D
(purple), and J (red) segments creates a complete heavy-chain variable region gene. Again, the recombinase enzyme recognizes the

of the double helix. Thus, the spacer sequence ensures that
the ends of the nonamer and heptamer closest to the spacers
would be on the same side of the double helix and, thus,
accessible to binding by the same enzyme. The investigators
correctly concluded that they had discovered the signal that
directs recombination between the V and J gene segments
and termed this heptamer 12/23 nonamer motif, the recombination signal sequence (RSS).
To summarize, the RSS consists of three elements:

sequence with a 12-bp spacer with one sequence with a
23-bp spacer, something we now know to be the case.
Figures 7-6a and 7-6b illustrate the generation of complete light-chain and heavy-chain genes from individual V
and J and V, D, and J segments, respectively.

•

Two proteins, encoded by closely linked genes, RAG1
(Recombination Activating Gene 1) and RAG2 (Recombination Activating Gene 2), were shown to be necessary
for recombining antibody genes. The RAG1 and RAG2
genes are encoded just 8 kilobases apart and are transcribed together. The expression of RAG1 and RAG2 is
developmentally regulated in both T and B cells (see Chapters 9 and 10) and, although RAG1 is expressed at all
phases of the cell cycle, RAG2 is stable only in G0- or
G1-phase cells. RAG1 is the predominant recombinase; it
forms a complex with the RSS that is stabilized by the binding of RAG2. RAG2 by itself does not exhibit detectable
RSS binding activity.

FIGURE 7-7 Overview of recombination of immunoglobulin variable region genes. The RAG1/2 complex (represented together
by the green oval) binds the RSSs and catalyzes recombination. Other enzymes fill in or cleave nucleotides at the coding end, and ligase completes the process. See text for details. [Adapted from Krangel, M. Nature Immunology 4, p. 625. 2003]
Only three of the proteins implicated in V(D)J recombination are unique to lymphocytes: RAG1, RAG2, and Terminal
deoxynucleotidyl Transferase (TdT), which is responsible
for the generation of additional diversity in the CDR3 region
of the antibody heavy chain (as we will see below). TdT is
expressed only in developing lymphocytes and adds untemplated “N” nucleotides to the free 3 termini of coding ends
following their cleavage by RAG1/2 recombinases.
Other enzymes participating in the recombination process are not lymphoid specific. Whereas binding of the RSS
by RAG1/2 can occur in the absence of any other proteins,
other cellular factors, most of which are part of the NonHomologous End Joining (NHEJ) pathway of DNA repair
are necessary for completion of V(D)J recombination. These
other non-lymphocyte-specific proteins known to participate in V(D)J joining are described in Table 7-3.

V(D)J Recombination Results in a Functional
Ig Variable Region Gene
The process of V(D)J recombination occurs in several
phases (Figure 7-7). The end product of each successful
rearrangement is an intact Ig gene, in which V and J (light
chains) or V, D, and J (heavy chains) segments are brought
together to create a complete heavy or light chain gene. The
new joints in the antibody V region gene, created by this
recombination process are referred to as coding joints. The
joints between the heptamers from the RSSs are referred to
as signal joints.

The first phase of this process, DNA recognition and
cleavage, is catalyzed by the RAG1/2 proteins. The second
phase, end processing and joining, requires a more complex
set of enzymatic activities in addition to RAG1/2, including
Artemis, TdT, DNA ligase lV, and other NHEJ proteins. The
individual steps involved in the process of recombination
between V and J segments are shown sequentially in
Figure 7-8.
Step 1 Recognition of the heptamer-nonamer Recombination Signal Sequence (RSS) by the RAG1/RAG2 enzyme
complex. The RAG1/2 recombinase forms a complex with
the heptamer-nonamer RSSs contiguous with the two gene
segments to be joined. Complex formation is initiated by
recognition of the nonamer RSS sequences by RAG1 and the
12-23 rule is followed during this binding.
Step 2 One-strand cleavage at the junction of the coding and
signal sequences. The RAG1/2 proteins then perform one of
their unique functions: the creation of a single-strand nick, 5 of
the heptameric signal sequence on the coding strand of each V
segment and a similar nick on the non-coding strand exactly at
the heptamer-J region junction. (Figure 7-8 shows this process
for the V segment only.)
Step 3 Formation of V and J region hairpins and blunt
signal ends. The free 3 hydroxyl group at the end of the coding strand of the VK segment now attacks the phosphate
group on the opposite, non-coding VK strand, forming a
new covalent bond across the double helix and yielding a
DNA hairpin structure on the V-segment side of the break
(coding end). Simultaneously, a blunt DNA end is formed at

FIGURE 7-8 The mechanism of V(D)J recombination. 1. The
RAG1/2 complex (pale green oval) binds to the RSSs and catalyzes
synapse formation. The coding (5 → 3) strand of DNA is drawn in a
thick line, the non-coding (3 → 5) strand in a thin line. For steps 1
to 5 we show only the events associated with the V region gene
segment, although the single-strand cleavage, hairpin formation, and
templated nucleotide addition simultaneously occur at the borders
of the V and the J segments. In this example, the V and J regions are
encoded in the same direction on the chromosome, and so the DNA
encoding the RSSs and the intervening DNA is released into the
nucleus as a circular episome and will be lost on cell division. The
DNA that was on the coding strand of the V region prior to rearrangement is emboldened. The actual signal joint is between the
residues that were in contiguity with the V and J regions, respectively.
Only the heptamer sequence is written out to preserve clarity.
Nucleotides encoded in the germ-line genome are shown in black; P
nucleotides are in blue, and non-templated nucleotides added by
TdT at heavy chain VD and DJ joints are shown in red. Steps 8, 9, and

the edge of the heptameric signal sequence. The same process occurs simultaneously on the J side of the incipient
joint. At this stage, the RAG1/2 proteins and HMG proteins
are still associated with the coding and signal ends of both
the V and J segments in a postcleavage complex.
Step 4 Ligation of the signal ends. DNA ligase IV then
ligates the free blunt ends to form the signal joint. The involvement of particular enzymes in this process was deduced from
observations of V(D)J recombination in natural and artificially
generated systems lacking one or more enzymes (see Table 7-3).
Step 5 Hairpin cleavage. The hairpins at the ends of the
V and J regions are now opened in one of three ways. The
identical bond that was formed by the reaction described in
step 3 above, may be reopened to create a blunt end at the
coding joint. Alternatively, the hairpin may be opened asymmetrically on the “top” or on the “bottom” strand, to yield a
5 or a 3 overhang, respectively. A 3 overhang is more common in in vivo experiments. Hairpin opening is catalyzed by
Artemis, a member of the NHEJ pathway.
Step 6 Overhang extension, leading to palindromic
nucleotides. In Ig light-chain rearrangements, the resulting
overhangs can act as substrates for extension DNA repair
enzymes, leading to double stranded palindromic (P)
nucleotides at the coding joint. For example, the top row of
bases in the V region in the 5 to 3 direction reads TCGA.
Reading backward on the bottom strand from the point of
ligation also yields TCGA. The palindromic nature of the
bases at this joint is a direct function of an asymmetric hairpin opening reaction. P nucleotide addition can also occur
at both the VD and DJ joints of the heavy-chain gene segments, but, as described below, other processes can intervene to add further diversity at the VH-D and D-JH junctions.
Step 7 Ligation of light-chain V and J Segments. Members
of the NHEJ pathway repair both the signal and the coding
joints, but the precise roles of each, and potentially other
enzymes in this process, have yet to be fully characterized.

CHAPTER 7

237

During B-cell development, Ig heavy-chain genes are
rearranged first, followed by the light-chain genes. This temporal dissociation of the two processes enables two additional diversifying mechanisms to act on heavy-chain V
region segments. The enzymes responsible for these mechanisms are usually turned off before light-chain rearrangements begin.
Comparative sequence analysis of germ-line and mature
B-cell Ig genes demonstrated that both loss of templated
nucleotides (nucleotides found in the germ-line DNA) and
addition of untemplated nucleotides (nucleotides not found
in germ-line DNA) could be identified in heavy-chain
sequences. Two distinct enzyme-catalyzed activities are
responsible for these findings.
Step 8 Exonuclease trimming. An exonuclease activity,
which has yet to be identified, trims back the edges of the
V region DNA joints. Since the RAG proteins themselves
can trim DNA near a 3 flap, it is possible that the RAG
proteins may cut off some of the lost nucleotides. Alternatively, Artemis has also been shown to have exonuclease, as
well as endonuclease activity, and could be the enzyme
responsible for the V(D)J-associated exonuclease function.
Exonuclease trimming does not necessarily occur in sets of
three nucleotides, and so can lead to out-of-phase joining.
V segment sequences in which trimming has caused the
loss of the correct reading frame for the chain cannot
encode antibody molecules, and such rearrangements are
said to be unproductive. As mentioned above, such exonuclease trimming is more common at the two heavychain V gene joints (V-D and D-J) than at the light-chain
V-J joint. In cases where trimming is extensive, it can lead
to the loss of the entire D region as well as the elimination
of any P nucleotides formed as a result of asymmetric hairpin cleavage.
Step 9 N nucleotide addition. Non-templated (N)
nucleotides are added by TdT to the coding joints of heavychain genes after hairpin cleavage. This enzyme can add up
to 20 nucleotides to each side of the joint. The two ends are
held together throughout this process by the enzyme complex, and again, loss of the correct phase may occur if
nucleotides are not added in the correct multiples of three
required to preserve the reading frame.
Step 10 Ligation and repair of the heavy-chain gene. This
occurs as for the light-chain genes.
In describing V(D)J recombination, investigators must
explain not only the mechanism of RSS recognition, cleavage, and ligation but also address the question of how two
RSSs, located many kilobases distant from one another in
the linear DNA sequence, are brought into close apposition.
Furthermore, once successful recombination has occurred
on one heavy-chain and one light-chain allele, this information must be communicated to the homologous chromosome, so that the other alleles can be silenced. How does
this occur?
Recent research indicates that both the structure and the
location of recombinationally active, Ig V region DNA

change significantly as B-cell development proceeds, and
that some of these changes are signaled by epigenetic alterations in the chromatin structure, mediated by specific methylation reactions on associated histone residues. DNA close
to the nuclear membrane (pericentric DNA) does not
include recombinationally active V regions; rather, DNA
undergoing recombination moves away from the nuclear
membrane, toward the center of the nucleus. The structure
of the chromatin undergoing recombination also alters,

such that long stretches of DNA are condensed into loops
that allow the recombining sequences to come into closer
contact with one another. Once successful recombination
has occurred, the inactive allele has been shown to migrate
to the pericentric regions. Thus, the recombination process
is occurring within an actively modulating nucleoplasmic
context, and is controlled by enzymes that alter chromatin
structure, in addition to those that cleave and recombine
the DNA.

V(D)J Recombination Can Occur between
Segments Transcribed in Either the Same or
Opposite Directions
Sequencing of chromosomal fragments containing multiple
antibody V region genes showed that transcription of some V
region genes occurs in a direction opposite from that of
downstream D and J segments. However, work with artificial
recombinase substrates has demonstrated that the same general mechanism of recombination is used, regardless of the
transcriptional direction of the gene segments involved.
When recombination occurs between two gene segments that
are transcribed in the same direction, the intervening DNA is
deleted and lost (Figure 7-9a). When they are transcribed in
opposite directions, the DNA that was located between the V
and J segments is retained, in an inverted orientation, in the
DNA upstream of the rearranged VJ region (Figure 7-9b).

Five Mechanisms Generate Antibody Diversity
in Naïve B Cells
This description of the complex and sophisticated apparatus
by which Ig genes are created allows us to understand how
such an immensely diversified antibody repertoire can be
generated from a finite amount of genetic material. To summarize, the diversity of the naïve BCR repertoire is shaped
by the following mechanisms:
1.

2.

3.
4.

Multiple gene segments exist at heavy (V, D, and J) and
light-chain (V and J) loci. These can be combined with
one another to provide extensive combinatorial diversity
(Table 7-4).
P nucleotide addition results when the DNA hairpin at the
coding joint is cleaved asymmetrically. Filling in the singlestranded DNA piece resulting from this asymmetric
cleavage generates a short palindromic sequence.
Exonuclease trimming sometimes occurs at the VDJ and
VJ junctions, causing loss of nucleotides.
Non-templated N nucleotide addition in heavy chains
results from TdT activity. Mechanisms 2, 3, and 4 give rise
to extra diversity at the junctions between gene segments,
which contribute to CDR3.

5.

In addition to these four mechanisms for generating antibody diversity that operate on individual
heavy- or light-chain variable segments, the combination of different heavy and light-chain pairs to form a
complete antibody molecule provides further opportunities for increasing the number of available antibody
combining sites (Table 7-4).
Combinatorial diversity: The same heavy chain can combine with different light chains, and vice versa.

These five mechanisms are responsible for the creation of
the diverse repertoire of BCRs and antibodies that is available to the organism before any contact with pathogens or
antigen has occurred. Following antigenic stimulation, B
cells are able to use yet another mechanism, unique to the
immune system, to further diversify and refine the antigenspecific receptors and antibodies: somatic hypermutation.
As described in Chapter 12, a specialized enzyme complex
targets the genes encoding the variable regions of Ig genes
only in those B cells that have undergone antigen-specific
activation in the presence of T-cell help. B cells are exposed
to successive cycles of mutation at the BCR loci, followed by
antigen-mediated selection in specialized regions of the
lymph node and spleen. The end result of this process is that
the average affinity of antigen-specific BCRs and antibodies
formed at the end of an immune response is considerably
higher than that at its instigation. This process is referred to
as affinity maturation.
This section has described the process of the generation
of the primary Ig variable region repertoire as it occurs in
humans and rodents. Although the same principles apply
to most vertebrate species, different species have evolved
their own variations. For example, the process of gene
conversion is used in chickens, and some species, such as
sheep and cows, use somatic hypermutation in the generation of the primary as well as the antigen-experienced
repertoire.
In Evolution Box 7-2, we describe the evolution of this
system of recombined lymphocyte receptors, addressing the
current hypothesis that the key event was the introduction of
the RAG1/2 gene segment into the early vertebrate genome
as a transposon.

understand how the process of V(D)J
recombination may have evolved. With
that understanding has come an appreciation for the fact that the BCRs and TCRs of
the vertebrate adaptive immune system
may not be the only immune receptor
molecules generated by recombinatorial
genetics.
Ig-like receptors have been identified
in species as ancient as the earliest jawed
vertebrates. However, extensive analyses
of the only surviving jawless vertebrates
(Agnathans), the hagfish and lamprey,
show no evidence of TCR or BCR V(D)J
segments, RAG1/2 genes, or genes encoding elements of a primitive Major HistoCompatibility Complex (MHC) system.
This suggests that the RSS-based, recombinatorially generated set of adaptive
immune receptors first emerged in a
common ancestor of jawed vertebrates,
most probably more than 500 million
years ago (Figure 1).
The driving force in the development
of the adaptive immune system was most
probably the incorporation of an ancestor
of the RAG1 genes into the ancestral
genome in the form of a transposable element. This hypothesis is supported by
several observations and experiments:

served transposon in flies, the HERMES
transposon, has been shown to induce
a double-strand break via the hairpinformation mechanism described above
for V(D)J recombination.
RAG proteins have the ability to transpose an RSS-containing segment of
DNA to an unrelated target DNA in vitro.

have provided the substrate for the transposon invasion. When the transposon
subsequently jumped out of the gene,
the RSSs would have been left behind.
Multiple such rounds of transposition followed by gene duplication would have
given rise to the TCR and BCR loci we
know today. Interestingly, our knowledge
of phylogeny suggests that two waves of
gene duplications occurred at the time of
vertebrate origin, right around the time of
the proposed transposon entry.
Much still remains unknown about the
evolution of the adaptive immune receptor molecules. What was the nature of the
primordial antigen receptor that was the
target for the first transposition? At what
stage did the RAG2 gene become associated with the RAG1 component? And
how do we account for the evolution of
the Ig receptors of species such as the
shark, in which fully rearranged V(D)J
genes exist in the germ-line genome?
Recent evidence has suggested that
the recombinatorial strategy for generating antigen receptors is not limited to the
RSS-based Ig and TCR systems of vertebrates. Jawless fish, such as lampreys and
hagfish, possess lymphocyte-like cells
that can be stimulated to divide and differentiate. Moreover, these cells release
specific agglutinins after immunization
with antigens, and higher serum levels of
these agglutinins are secreted after a secondary, than after a primary, immunization, suggesting that immunological
memory exists in these fish. These lymphocyte-like cells therefore appear to
express all the hallmarks of adaptive
immunity, and yet the agglutinins they
secrete do not appear to have an Ig-like
structure.
Analysis of the agglutinins has revealed
that activated lamprey “lymphocytes”
express abundant quantities of leucinerich-repeat (LRR)-containing proteins.
LRRs are protein motifs that are frequently
associated with protein-protein recognition, and such motifs have already been
encountered in the context of the Toll-like
receptors described in Chapter 5. The
lamprey agglutinin receptors are gener-

(GPI) anchor and a hydrophobic peptide.
Lymphocyte activation leads to phospholipase cleavage at the GPI anchor, enabling
soluble forms of the VLRs to be released
from the lymphocyte following antigen
stimulation.
The assembly process that generates
the completed protein occurs only in
lymphocytes. In the germ-line DNA, LRR
cassettes flank the skeleton LRR genes,
which consist initially only of sequences
coding for parts of the LRRNT and LRRCT,
separated by non-coding DNA (Figure 2b).
During lymphocyte development, the
non-coding sequence is replaced with
variable LRRs. Gene segments are copied
from one part of the genome into another
in a one-way process, similar to gene
conversion. Each lamprey lymphocyte

expresses a unique VLR gene from a single allele, and the diversity of the repertoire is limited only by the number of
lymphocytes.
Figure 2c shows a cartoon of the structure of one of these receptors, generated
from an x-ray crystallographic model.
Comparison of the sequences of several
of these primarily 
-stranded structures
has shown that their sequence diversity is
concentrated on the concave (left) side of
the molecule and can be attributed to the
inherent diversity of the LRR cassettes.
Did the two LRR- and V(D)J-based,
recombinatorially derived sets of immune
receptors exist side by side in an ancestral
species? This we do not know. Agnathans
other than lampreys and hagfish were
extinguished 400 million years ago, and

B-Cell Receptor Expression
The expression of a receptor on the surface of a B cell is the
end result of a complex and tightly regulated series of events.
First, the cell must ensure that the various gene recombination
events culminate in productive rearrangements of both the
heavy- and light-chain loci. Second, only one heavy-chain
and one light-chain allele must be expressed in each B cell.
Finally, the receptor must be tested to ensure it does not bind
self antigens, in order to protect the host against the generation of an autoimmune response.

The random nature of Ig heavy- and light-chain gene rearrangement means that more than one heavy-light-chain
pair could potentially be expressed on the surface of individual B cells. Furthermore, since each heavy chain could
potentially combine with both light chains and vice versa,
this could result in the creation of B cells bearing a variety
of different antigen-binding sites. Whereas this opportunity to increase the number of available receptors may initially sound advantageous to the organism, in practice the
presence of more than one receptor per B cell creates prohibitive difficulties for those mechanisms that protect
against the generation of autoimmunity. The mechanism by
which B cells ensure that only one heavy- and one lightchain allele are transcribed and translated is referred to as
allelic exclusion.

The rearrangement of Ig genes occurs in an ordered way,
and begins with recombination at one of the two homologous chromosomes carrying the heavy-chain loci. The production of a complete heavy chain and its expression on the
B-cell surface in concert with a surrogate light chain, made
up of two proteins, VpreB and 5 (Figure 7-10), signals the
end of heavy-chain gene rearrangement and, thus, only one
antibody heavy chain is allowed to complete the rearrangement process. The mechanism by which this allelic exclusion
occurs is still under investigation. However, we do know that
following successful arrangement at one allele, the VH gene
locus on the other chromosomes is methylated and recruited
to heterochromatin.

we have access only to the fossil remains
of ostracoderms (agnathans with dermal
skeletons), which are thought to be the
ancestors of the gnathostomes. One theory would hold that the VLR recombinatorial system evolved in an ancestor
common only to hagfish and lampreys,
and could have been causal in their ability to survive when other agnathan species succumbed to environmental insult.
Alternatively, the VLR and Ig-based systems may have co-existed for a time, with
lymphocytes bearing both types of
receptors, until one of the systems was
lost.
Combinatorial genetics in the generation of the vertebrate antigen receptors
may not be as unique a mechanism as
immunologists had previously thought.

FIGURE 7-11 The generation of a functional immunoglobulin receptor requires productive rearrangement at
heavy- and light-chain alleles. Heavy-chain genes rearrange first,
and once a productive heavy-chain gene rearrangement occurs, the
pre-BCR containing the  protein product prevents rearrangement of
the other heavy-chain allele and initiates light-chain rearrangement.
In the mouse, rearrangement of  light-chain genes precedes rear-

If the first attempt at a heavy-chain rearrangement is
unproductive (i.e., results in the formation of out-of-frame
joints caused by P and N nucleotide addition or by exonuclease trimming at the joint), rearrangement will initiate at the
second heavy-chain allele. If this is also unsuccessful, the B
cell will die. Once a complete heavy chain is expressed, lightchain rearrangement begins. In mice, light-chain rearrangement always begins on one of the  alleles, and continues until
a productive light-chain rearrangement is completed. In
humans, it may begin at either a  or a  light-chain locus.
Because successive arrangements (using upstream V regions
and downstream J regions) can occur on the same light-chain
chromosome (see below) and there are four alleles (two  and
two ) to choose from, once a B cell has made a complete
heavy chain, it will normally progress to maturity. Successful
completion of light-chain rearrangement results in the expression of the BCR on the cell surface, and this signals the end of
further Ig receptor gene rearrangement events (Figure 7-11).

rangement of the  genes, as shown here. In humans, either  or 
rearrangement can proceed once a productive heavy-chain rearrangement has occurred. Formation of IgM inhibits further light-chain
gene rearrangement. If a nonproductive rearrangement occurs for
one allele, then the cell attempts rearrangement of the other allele.
[Adapted from G. D. Yancopoulos and F. W. Alt, 1986, Regulation of the assembly
and expression of variable-region genes, Annual Review of Immunology 4:339.]

The process of generating a fully functional set of B cells
is energetically expensive for the organism because of the
amount of waste involved. On average, two out of three
attempts at the first heavy-chain chromosomal locus will
result in an unproductively rearranged heavy chain, and the
same is true for the rearrangement process at the second
heavy-chain locus. Therefore the probability of successfully
generating a functional heavy chain is only 1/3 (at the first
allele) 	 {2/3 (probability the first rearrangement was not
successful)  1/3 (probability that the second rearrangement is successful)}  0.55 or 55%.

Receptor Editing of Potentially Autoreactive
Receptors Occurs in Light Chains
The immune system can still make some changes even after
the completed receptor is on the cell surface. If the receptor
is found to be auto-reactive, the cell can swap it out for

a different one, in a process termed receptor editing. Since
the receptor’s binding site contains elements of both the
heavy and the light chain, changing just one of these is often
sufficient to alter the specificity, and light-chain receptor
editing has been shown to occur quite frequently.
In this process, the DNA rearrangement machinery is
switched back on after the first completed receptor in the
immature B cell has been found to have autoimmune specificity. For example, as shown in Figure 7-12, the initial rearrangement of V3 to J3 may result in an Ig receptor molecule
that bound to a self antigen. The B cell can then rearrange a
light-chain gene at the second -chain allele, it can rearrange
a -chain allele, or it can edit the original -chain rearrangement. All of these choices have been demonstrated in different B cells. However, the term receptor editing refers to the
process in which a B cell uses the same allele more than
once, and engages in a second rearrangement process in
which a variable region gene segment upstream of the original segment (in this case V2) is recombined with a J segment
downstream of the initially utilized J region (in this case, J4).
Switching out the rearranged VH segments is less common. Since rearrangement of the heavy-chain variable
region deletes the RSSs on either side of the D region
sequences, it was at first thought to be impossible. However,
recent advances have demonstrated that cryptic RSSs exist
that can be used in heavy-chain editing, and so some measure of heavy-chain receptor editing does occur.

Ig Gene Transcription Is Tightly Regulated
Immunoglobulin genes are expressed only in cells of the B
lymphocyte lineage, and within this lineage, expression of Ig

genes is developmentally regulated (see Chapter 10). The
control of Ig gene transcription is therefore necessarily complex, although it involves the familiar paradigm of transcription factors that bind to sequence elements in the DNA
(Table 7-5 and Figure 7-13).
Expression of the Ig genes requires the coordination of
two types of cis regulatory elements: promoters and
enhancers. Like other promoters, the Ig heavy and lightchain gene promoters contain a highly conserved, AT-rich
sequence called the TATA box, which serves as the binding site for RNA polymerase. RNA polymerase II starts
transcribing the DNA from the initiation site, about 25
base pairs (bp) downstream of the TATA box. Each VH and
VL gene segment has a promoter located just upstream
from its leader sequence. The promoters upstream of Ig VH
and VL gene segments bind to RNA polymerase II quite
weakly, and the rate of transcription of VH and VL coding
regions is very low in unrearranged germ-line DNA. Rearrangement of Ig genes brings the promoters close enough
to enhancers located in the intron sequences and in
regions downstream of the C region genes for them to
influence the V region promoters. Consequently, the rate
of transcription is increased by a factor of 104 upon V gene
rearrangement.
However, although the transcription of unrearranged
genes is low, it is not absent in developing B cells; evidence
now suggests that, as the Ig genes move out of the pericentric regions of the nucleus and assume more euchromatic
configurations prior to recombination, a low level of transcription occurs which indicates to the recombination
machinery that they are in a state of readiness for rearrangement to occur.

Occasionally, the powerful B-cell Ig enhancers can engage

constitutive expression of the c-Myc protein and the generation of an aggressive, highly proliferative B-cell lymphoma.
Similarly, the translocation of the bcl-2 gene close to the Ig

cells, resulting in follicular B-cell lymphoma.

Adaptive Immunity: Antigen Receptors and MHC

Mature B Cells Express Both IgM and IgD
Antibodies by a Process That Involves
mRNA Splicing
As described above, the same Ig heavy-chain variable region
can be expressed in association with more than one heavychain constant region. Furthermore, each of the heavy-chain
constant regions can be synthesized as both membranebound and secreted forms.
Immature B cells in the bone marrow express only membrane IgM receptors. However, as the B cells mature, they
also place IgD receptors on their cell surface. These IgD
receptors bear the identical antigen-binding V region, but
carry a , rather than a  constant region. In this section, we
describe how cells create the membrane-bound and secreted
forms of IgM and IgD by RNA splicing. The generation of
antibodies belonging to the heavy-chain classes other than
IgM and IgD occurs by an additional DNA recombination
process, referred to as class switch recombination (CSR),
and results in the loss of the DNA encoding the  and  gene
segments. CSR is described in Chapter 12, because it is a
process that occurs only after antigen-mediated activation of
B cells.
The primary heavy-chain transcript in a B cell that has
not yet been exposed to antigen encodes both the C and
the C constant regions, and is approximately 15 kb in
length. The determination of whether a cell will synthesize
the membrane-bound or secreted forms of  and/or  heavy
chains is made by nuclear proteins that select particular
choices of polyadenylation and RNA splicing sites. During
mRNA processing, polyadenylation sites signal for the cleavage and addition of a poly-A sequence at a particular site on
the primary transcript, that then becomes the 3 terminus of
the mature, processed mRNA. (Poly-A tails are characteristically found at the 3 termini of many eukaryotic mRNA
species.) A nuclear complex called the spliceosome determines the sites at which the primary transcript will be
cleaved and spliced to form the mature mRNA.
Figure 7-14 illustrates the splicing and polyadenylation
choices made when a cell generates membrane bound IgM
(the only Ig species expressed by immature B cells) versus
membrane-bound IgD, which is expressed upon B-cell
maturation. Both of these species are present on the cell
membrane prior to antigen encounter.
Analysis of the primary Ig transcript revealed that the
C4 exon (the 3-most exon of the  heavy chain) ends in a
nucleotide sequence called S (secreted), which encodes the
hydrophilic portion of the CH4 domain of secreted IgM. The
S portion of the mRNA sequence includes a polyadenylation
site, polyadenylation site 1. Two additional exons, M1 and
M2 (M for membrane), are located 1.8 kb downstream of the
3 end of the C4 exon. M1 encodes the membranespanning region of the heavy chain. M2 encodes the three
cytoplasmic amino acids at the C-terminus of IgM, followed
by polyadenylation site 2 (see Figure 7-14a). Production of

mRNA encoding the membrane-bound form of the  chain
occurs when cleavage of the primary transcript and addition
of the poly-A tail occurs at polyadenylation site 2 (see Figure 7-14b). RNA splicing then removes the S sequence at the
3 end of the C4 exon, and joins the remainder of the C4
exon to the M1 and M2 exons. The RNA sequence between
the M1 and M2 exons is also spliced out, resulting in the
production of mRNA encoding the membrane-bound form
of the IgM heavy chain. This is the only splicing pattern that
occurs in immature B cells.
As the B cell matures, it begins to express membranebound IgD in addition to membrane IgM (see Figure 7-14c).
The exons encoding the membrane-bound and secreted
forms of IgD are arranged similarly to those of IgM, with
polyadenylation sites 3 and 4 at the 3 termini of the
sequences encoding the secreted and membrane-bound
forms of IgD respectively. If polyadenylation occurs at site 4,
and the C RNA is spliced out, the cell will make the
membrane-bound  chain, and express IgD as well as IgM
on the cell surface. Since mature B cells bear both IgM and
IgD on their surfaces, it is clear that both splicing patterns
can occur simultaneously.
Following antigen stimulation, the B cell begins to generate the secreted form of IgM (Figure 7-15a). Polyadenylation
shifts to site 1, and the mRNA sequences downstream of site
1 are degraded. (Similarly, the use of splice site 3 generates
secreted IgD, although this is not shown for purposes of clarity.) The secreted form of IgD is used less frequently than the
secreted form of the other antibody heavy-chain classes, and
so splice site 3 is used relatively rarely.
At the protein level, the carboxyl-terminus of the membrane-bound form of the Ig  chain consists of a sequence of
about 40 amino acids, which is composed of a hydrophilic
segment that extends outside the cell, a hydrophobic transmembrane segment, and a very short hydrophilic segment
at the carboxyl end that extends into the cytoplasm (Figure 7-15b). In the secreted form, these 40 amino acids are
replaced by a hydrophilic sequence of about 20 amino acids
in the carboxyl terminal domain.
What mechanism determines which splice sites are
used? This question is not yet fully resolved. However,
work with artificial constructs containing different combinations of the various splice sites suggests that there is an
intrinsic “strength” to each of the splice sites that determines how frequently it is used, and that this strength
reflects the binding affinity between the DNA sequence at
the splice site and the spliceosome. Analysis of the
sequences of the splice sites in Ig mRNA suggests that
splice site 2 is considerably “stronger” than splice site 1,
which explains why immature B cells make a preponderance of the membrane form of the  chain. B-cell stimulation appears to cause an increase in the concentration of
the splice site recognition proteins, as well as the early termination of transcription prior to the M1 and M2
sequences, thereby facilitating the use of splice site 1 and

T-Cell Receptor Genes and Expression
The initial characterization of the BCR molecule was facilitated by the fact that the secreted Ig product of the B cell
shares the antigen-binding region with the membrane receptor. The secreted Ig proteins could be used as antigens to
generate antibodies in other species that recognized the
B-cell surface receptor and these anti-receptor antibodies
could then be employed as reagents to isolate and characterize the BCR. In addition, a set of monoclonal B-cell tumors
secreting high concentrations of soluble antibodies was
available.
Investigators attempting to purify and analyze the T-cell
receptor (TCR) enjoyed no such advantages, and therefore it
should not be surprising to learn that several decades

elapsed between the characterization of the BCR and that of
its T-cell counterpart. Indeed, characterization of the TCR
was so difficult and vexing that one of the distinguished writers for the scientific journal Nature, Miranda Robertson,
referred to it as “The Hunting of the Snark,” in reference to
the Lewis Carroll poem of the same name, which described
the search for a mythical creature.
In Chapter 3, we described the TCR protein. Below, we
describe the parallel story of the discovery of the TCR genes.

Understanding the Protein Structure
of the TCR Was Critical to the Process
of Discovering the Genes
In Chapter 3 we described how investigators were able to use
a monoclonal antibody (mAb) specific for the TCR to purify
and characterize it as an 
 heterodimeric protein. Each
chain was shown to consist of one variable and one constant
region domain, and both chains contained regions arranged

in the characteristic Ig fold (Figure 7-16). The presence of
these variable and constant regions provided clues as to the
potential arrangement of the genes that encode the TCR
proteins, and enabled researchers to design the experiments
that ultimately led to the characterization of the TCR genes.

The 
-Chain Gene Was Discovered
Simultaneously in Two Different Laboratories
Two different research groups published papers in the same
issue of Nature in 1984 that described the discovery of the
TCR genes in mice and in humans respectively. Mark Davis,
Stephen Hedrick, and their collaborators utilized a uniquely
creative approach to isolate the receptor genes from several
mouse T-cell hybridoma cell lines, which we describe below.
The other group, headed by Tak Mak, used more classical
methods of genetic analysis to isolate the TCR genes from
human cell lines.
The Davis-Hedrick group strategy was based on four
assumptions about TCR genes:

•
•

TCR genes will be expressed in T cells but not B cells.
Since the genes encode a membrane-bound receptor, the
transcribed mRNA will be found associated with
membrane-bound polyribosomes.

|

CHAPTER 7

249

Like Ig genes, TCR genes will code for a variable and a
constant region.
Like Ig genes, the genes that encode the TCR will
undergo rearrangement in T cells.

Prior experiments had revealed that only about 2% of
the genes expressed by lymphocytes differed between T
and B cells. Furthermore, only a small proportion (about
3%) of T-cell mRNA had been shown to be associated with
membrane-bound polyribosomes. Davis and Hedrick reasoned that if they could generate 32P-labeled DNA copies
(cDNA) of the membrane-bound polyribosomal fraction
of antigen-specific T-cell mRNA, and remove from that
population those sequences that were also expressed in B
cells, they would be left with labeled, T-cell-derived cDNA
that would be greatly enriched in sequences encoding the
TCR (Figure 7-17).
They therefore performed the following steps:

•

FIGURE 7-16 The heterodimeric ␣␤ T-cell receptor. The
alpha chain is shown here in green and the beta chain in blue.

/Volumes/203/MHR00209/siL52070/disk1of1/0071052070

•
•

Extract membrane-bound polysomal mRNA (RNA
sequences that encode membrane-bound proteins) from
several T hybridoma lines.
Reverse transcribe the polysomal mRNA in the presence
of 32P-labeled nucleotides, to generate radioactive cDNA
copies of each of the mRNA species.
Mix the 32P-labeled T-cell cDNA with B-cell mRNA and
remove all the cDNA that hybridized with B-cell mRNA.
(This leaves behind only the T-cell mRNA that encodes
proteins not expressed in B cells.)
Recover the “T-cell-specific cDNAs” and use them to
identify hybridizing DNA clones from a T-cell specific
library.
Radioactively label those clones that hybridized to the
“T-cell-specific” cDNAs, and use cloned probes
individually to probe Southern blots of DNA from liver
cells and B-cell lymphomas (which would not be
expected to rearrange TCR genes) and DNA from
different T-cell hybridomas (which would be expected to
show different patterns of rearrangements in different
T-cell clones).

Probing with the TM90 cDNA probe (see bottom of Figure 7-17) resulted in a pattern of bands that did not vary
depending on the origin of the cellular DNA. This indicated
that TM90 recognizes DNA found in T cells but not B cells,
that does not rearrange in different ways in different cells,
and therefore is probably not complementary to a TCR gene.
In contrast, the TM86 cDNA probe hybridized to bands in
the T-cell DNA of different sizes than in either the liver or
the B-cell DNA. Furthermore, TM86 showed different patterns of hybridization in different T-cell hybridomas, indicating that the sequence recognized by the TM86 probe is
found in varying contexts within the DNA of different
hybridomas. Note that this probe also shows the same pattern of bands in the liver cells and B cells. This is consistent
with the notion that the genes encoding the TCR recombine in
T cells, but not in any other cell type. These results indicated

to obtain 32P-labeled cDNA clones corresponding to T-cell-specific
mRNAs. DNA subtractive hybridization was used to isolate T-cellspecific cDNA fragments that were cloned and labeled with 32P. The
labeled cDNA clones were used to probe Southern blots of DNA
isolated from embryonic liver (TCR genes should be in the germ-line
configuration), from a B-cell lymphoma (TCR genes should also be in
the germ-line configuration), and from a panel of T-cell clones. (TCR
genes should be differently arranged in each clone.) Their clone,
TM86, encodes a gene that rearranged differently in each T-cell clone
analyzed. Comparison of its sequence to that of the protein sequence
of the 
 TCR isolated by Kappler and Marrack revealed TM86 to
encode the 
 chain of the TCR. TM90 cDNA identified the gene for
another T cell membrane molecule that does not undergo rearrangement. [Based on S. M. Hedrick et al., 1984, Isolation of cDNA clones encoding

that the TM86 cDNA probe was binding to DNA that is rearranged specifically only in T cells and thus most probably
encodes a gene for a TCR protein. In this way the first mouse
TCR gene was isolated.
Comparison of the DNA sequence of Mak’s human clone
with the amino acid sequence from a human hybridoma
confirmed that Davis and Hedrick et al., and Mak et al., had
isolated the gene for the mouse and human forms of the
TCR 
 gene, respectively.

Focus now switched to the search for the TCR  chain. But
here, immunology took one of its strange and wonderful
twists.
Tonegawa’s lab, this time using the subtractive hybridization approach pioneered by Hedrick and Davis, succeeded in
cloning a gene that appeared at first to have all the hallmarks
of the TCR  chain gene. It was expressed in T cells, but not
in B cells; it was rearranged in T cell clones; and on sequencing, it revealed regions corresponding to a signal peptide,
two Ig family domains, a transmembrane region, and a short
cytoplasmic peptide. Furthermore, the predicted molecular
weight of the encoded chain appeared to be very close to that
of the -chain protein. Tonegawa’s lab initially suggested
that “while direct evidence is yet to be produced, it is very
likely the pHDS4/203 codes for the  subunit of the T cell
receptor.”
However, biochemical analysis of the TCR  and 
 chain
proteins by another laboratory had clearly demonstrated
that both the  and the 
 chains of the TCR heterodimer
were glycosylated. A search for potential sequences corresponding to sites of carbohydrate attachment on Tonegawa’s
putative -chain sequence came up short. It therefore
seemed that the gene Tonegawa’s lab had isolated was not the
 chain, but something very similar. Further work demonstrated that they had discovered a gene encoding an hitherto
unknown receptor that contained both variable and constant
regions and recombined only in T cells. They named this
gene (and the receptor chain it encoded) .
Davis and colleagues next isolated a genomic sequence
expressed in T and not B cells that encoded a protein with
four potential N-linked glycosylation sites, and a molecular
weight consistent with that of the  chain of the TCR. With

FIGURE 7-18 Germ-line organization of the mouse TCR ␣-,
␤-, ␥-, and ␦- chain gene segments. Each C gene segment is
composed of a series of exons and introns, which are not shown. The
organization of TCR gene segments in humans is similar. Approximate numbers of the gene segments are shown in Table 7-7. [Adapted

the genes for the  and 
 chains of the TCR fully characterized, those attempting to understand TCR genetics were left
with a series of intriguing questions. Was the  chain
expressed by the same T cells that expressed the 
 receptor? Did the  chain that Tonegawa had discovered also exist
as a heterodimer? If so, what was its partner, and who would
find it first?
After 3 years of searching, Chien and colleagues, working
in the Davis lab, described a fourth TCR gene that they
named . Intriguingly, the V chain gene was found to lie
downstream of the previously described V genes and just 5
to the JC coding regions. Rearrangement of this locus was
found to occur very early in thymic differentiation, and
expression of -chain RNA paralleled that of the expression
of the  chain in thymic subpopulations, occurring in the
same T cells. Most striking about the location of the  genes
was the observation that, if a T cell rearranged the  chain,
the intervening  genes would be lost (Figure 7-18). Study of
the T cells expressing these , receptors demonstrated that
,-bearing T cells represented an entirely new T-cell subset

and a different anatomical distribution within the lymphoid
system in the host.

TCR Genes Undergo a Process of Rearrangement
Very Similar to That of Ig Genes
Table 7-6 shows the chromosomal locations of the TCR
receptor genes in mice and humans and Figure 7-18 shows
the arrangement of the TCR genes in the mouse genome.
The four TCR loci are organized in the germ line in a manner remarkably similar to the multigene organization of the
Ig loci, shown in Figure 7-4, and as in the case of Ig genes,
functional TCR genes are produced by rearrangements of V
and J segments in the - and -chain families and between
V, D, and J segments in the 
- and -chain genes.
The approximate numbers of different V, D, and J segments in each of the TCR gene families of mice and humans
are shown in Table 7-7. Interestingly, some of the V and V
gene segments have been shown to be used in both  and 
TCR chains, which further adds to the diversity of the TCR
repertoire.
Rearrangement of TCR variable region genes follows the
same general outline as that of Ig genes. One point of contrast however is that, whereas Ig light chains incorporate few
N nucleotides because of the developmental down-regulation
of expression of the TdT enzyme in B cells by the time of
light-chain rearrangement, N nucleotides are seen at similar
frequencies in all of the TCR chains.
The - and -chain variable genes, like the Ig light-chain
gene, are generated from one V and one J segment. The TCR

 and  chain variable region genes are assembled from V,

D, and J segments, like the Ig heavy chains. In contrast to
the Ig genes, however, the TCR families do not have a functionally diverse set of C regions. There is one constant region
gene for each of the  and  gene families, and although
there is more than one gene encoding each of the C
 and C
regions, they are highly homologous and do not appear to
differ in function.
Animals deficient in RAG1/2 or the other enzymes affecting Ig gene recombination, such as Artemis or TdT, are
similarly deficient in the generation of both their BCRs and
their TCRs, and so it is thought that the essential features of
the rearrangement processes are similar in B and T cells
(Clinical Focus Box 7-3). The heptamer-nonamer recombination signal sequences are found at the 3 termini of the V
sequences, the 5 and 3 termini of the D sequences, and the
5 termini of the J sequences, just as for the Ig variable region
gene segments.
Recall that the 12-23 rule specifies that recombination
can only occur between gene segments contiguous in one
case with an RSS containing a 12 (one-turn) bp spacer and
in the other with an RSS containing 23 (two-turn) bp spacer
(see Figure 7-5). By this rule, recombination between VH
and JH immunoglobulin gene segments is disallowed, and
hence all properly rearranged heavy-chain V regions must
have all three segments represented.
In contrast, the D regions of the TCR 
 and  chain
genes are bordered on the one side by a 12-bp spacer and on
the other by a 23-bp spacer (Figure 7-19). By the 12-23 rule,

V and J segments from the 
 and  gene families can theoretically recombine directly, without an intervening D segment. Furthermore, the rule would also allow for D-D
segment recombination. Do these unusual recombinations
occur in vivo?
In the case of the 
-chain gene, the answer appears to be
that they do not. Evidence obtained from sequencing cDNA
fragments containing precisely known V, D, and J sequences
has demonstrated that functioning TCR 
-chain genes
always contain one each of the V, D, and J segments. However, the situation is not quite as simple for the TCR -chain
genes.
Scientists noted that many TCR V genes were considerably longer than TCR V
 genes; furthermore, the increased
sequence length seemed primarily to occur in those parts of
the gene encoding the CDR3 residues that make antigen
contact. Subsequent analysis showed that many TCR V
genes have incorporated not one but two D-region segments, and this additional segment is primarily responsible
for the observed increase in gene length. In some V genes,
further length was added to the TCR -chain gene by N
nucleotide addition at the D-D joint.
In contrast to the dramatic levels of diversity facilitated by
the incorporation of N nucleotides in all chains of the TCR,
TCRs do not appear to undergo somatic hypermutation following antigen contact at any appreciable rate.
Table 7-8 compares the mechanisms of the generation
and expression of diversity in BCR versus TCR molecules.

 segments
has not been observed in vivo.

TCR Expression Is Controlled by Allelic Exclusion
Allelic exclusion occurs among TCR genes almost as efficiently
as among BCR genes, with one exception: some fraction of
T cells bear more than one TCR  chain. However, it would be
unlikely, although not impossible, that a T cell bearing two 
chains would be able to recognize more than one antigen, given
the complexity of T-cell antigen recognition. In Chapter 8,
we explain how T cells recognize an antigen made up of a
foreign peptide presented to the immune system in a specialized groove in a Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC)
antigen. As we will learn in Chapter 9, TCRs are tested twice
within the thymus to determine their functionality before the
T cells are released into the periphery. First, T cells are tested to
ensure that the  and 
 chains can pair into a functioning TCR
that is capable of recognizing self MHC antigens bearing self
peptides with low to moderate affinity (positive selection). This
is necessary because the T cell must have some minimal capacity to recognize self MHC if it is to be able to bind to a peptide
presented on the surface of the MHC antigen. Then, T cells
bearing receptors that recognize self peptides in association
with MHC antigens at high affinity are eliminated in order to
eliminate the generation of autoreactive receptors (negative
selection). The likelihood that a single TCR 
 chain could pair
with more than one TCR  chain and meet all these stringent
criteria is extremely small. The presence of even one 
 TCR
capable of binding self antigens at high affinity would result in
the elimination of the cell, irrespective of the specificity of the
receptor formed using an alternative  chain.
Although B and T cells use very similar mechanisms for
variable region gene rearrangements, complete rearrangement of Ig genes does not occur in T cells and complete rearrangement of TCR genes does not occur in B cells. Not only

is the recombinase enzyme system differently regulated in
each lymphocyte lineage, but chromatin is uniquely reconfigured in B cells and T cells to allow the recombinase access
only to the appropriate specific antigen receptor genes.

TCR Gene Expression Is Tightly Regulated
As at Ig loci, expression of TCR genes requires the coordinated use of transcriptional promoters and enhancers that
serve at specific stages in T-cell development to make the
receptor chromatin open and accessible for recombination
(see Chapter 9). T cells begin to rearrange the TCR 
 gene
at the pro-T-cell stage. The mouse TCR
 locus (see Figure
7-18) consists of approximately 40 V
 genes located upstream
of 2 distinct D
J
 clusters. Immediately upstream of each of
the two D
 genes is a promoter region (PD
1 and PD
2).
These promoters require the activity of a single enhancer, E
,
located at the 3end of the locus. Activation of the enhancer
serves to facilitate the opening of the chromatin throughout
the D
J
 locus, and activation of each of the two PD
 promoters localizes the rearrangement to their own set of DJ
regions.
Several TCR enhancer-binding proteins have been identified and, as for B-cell Ig genes, some of these are shared
among cells of many different types. Among the T-cellspecific proteins is GATA-3, which binds in a sequencespecific manner to the enhancer elements of all four TCR
genes. Tissue- and stage-specific expression of enhancerbinding proteins at the TCR loci helps to facilitate locus
accessibility that in turn allows the complex processes of
recombination and transcription of the TCR genes and,
eventually, cell-surface expression of the TCR proteins.

BOX 7-3

CLINICAL FOCUS

Some Immunodeficiencies Result from Impaired Receptor
Gene Recombination
Since the RAG1/2 enzymes are
responsible for both BCR and TCR gene
rearrangements, mutations in the genes
encoding RAG1 or RAG2 have catastrophic consequences for the immune
system, resulting in patients with severe
combined immunodeficiency, or SCID.
The RAG1/2 genes are located on human
chromosome 11 (i.e., an autosome), so
such mutations are inherited in an autosomally recessive manner.
Babies born with nonfunctional RAG1
or RAG2 genes have essentially no circulating B or T cells, although they do
express normal levels of natural killer (NK)
cells and their myeloid and erythroid cells
are normal in number and function.
Because infants receive antibodies passively from the maternal circulation, the
first manifestation of this disease is the
complete absence of T-cell function, and
hence such infants suffer from severe,
recurrent infections with fungi and viruses
that would normally be combated by T
cells in a healthy neonate. SCID used to be
inevitably fatal within the first few months
of life, unless babies were delivered
directly into a sterile environment. The life
span of a SCID patient can be prolonged
by preventing contact with all potentially
harmful microorganisms. Air must be fil-

tered, all food must be sterilized, and
there must be no direct contact with
other people. Such isolation is feasible
only as a temporary measure, pending
treatment.
Nowadays, babies diagnosed sufficiently early with RAG1/2 deficiency can
be successfully treated with bone marrow
transplantation. If a suitable donor can be
found, and transplantation is performed
early in the patient’s first year of life, the
chances of the patient surviving to live a
normal life are 97% or greater.
Patients who carry mutations resulting
in partially active or impaired RAG1 or
RAG2 genes are diagnosed with Omenn
syndrome. Omenn syndrome patients
have no circulating B cells and abnormal
lymph node architecture with deficiencies
in the B-cell zones of the lymph nodes.
Although some T cells are present, they
are oligoclonal (derived from a very few
precursors and hence have very few different receptors), and these T cells tend to
be inappropriately activated. They do not
respond normally to mitogens or to antigens in vitro. This condition, like RAG1/2
deficiency, is invariably fatal unless corrected by bone marrow transplantation.
If deficiency in RAG1/2 genes causes
such a catastrophic loss of immune func-

tion, it makes sense that loss of any of the
other genes implicated in V(D)J recombination would also result in a SCID phenotype. In 1998, it was determined that
deficiency of the Artemis DNA repair
enzyme also results in the loss of T- and
B-cell function, in the face of normal NK
cell activity. Loss of Artemis results in a
SCID syndrome referred to as Athabascan
SCID. Since Artemis is necessary for normal
DNA repair, as well as V(D)J recombination, patients with Athabascan SCID also
suffer from increased radiation sensitivity
of skin fibroblasts and bone marrow cells.
Similarly, human patients suffering from a
deficiency in DNA ligase IV present with
an immunodeficiency that affects T, B, and
NK cells. Since DNA ligase IV is implicated
in DNA repair functions outside the
immune system, such patients also suffer
from generalized chromosomal instability,
radiosensitivity, and developmental and
growth retardation.
A SCID defect in mice, first noted and
characterized by Prof. Melvin Bosma, results
from a nonsense mutation in the gene
encoding the DNA-PKcs. Although a similar
recessive mutation has been found in Arabian horses, few, if any, human cases of
SCID have been reported carrying this
mutation.

The antigen receptor on the surface of a B cell is an Ig with
the same binding site as the antibody the B cell’s progeny
will eventually secrete.
The number of different antibody molecules that can be made
by a single individual mouse or human is vast: close to 1013–14.
This number is achieved by combinatorial association of multiple gene segments termed V (variable) and J (joining),
which together encode the variable region of the light chain
of the Ig molecule and V, D (diversity), and J, which encode
the variable region of the heavy chain of the Ig molecule.
V(D)J recombination occurs at the level of the DNA and
is catalyzed by the lymphoid-specific enzymes RAG1 and
RAG2.

■

■

RAG1 and RAG2 recognize Recombination Signal
Sequences (RSSs) that are contiguous with the coding
regions. RSSs consist of a conserved heptamer and a conserved nonamer sequence, separated by a spacer region
conserved in length, but not completely in sequence.
Spacer regions have a length corresponding to one turn of
the double helix (12-bp spacer) or two turns of the double
helix (23-bp spacer). RAG1/2 catalyzes recombination
between segments bordered by different spacers.
At the sites of recombination, hairpin cleavage can be
asymmetric, resulting in P nucleotides, and in the heavychain genes, non-templated nucleotide addition can result
in N nucleotides. Exonuclease nibbling can reduce the

number of N and P nucleotides in the final receptor gene
products.
The variable regions of TCRs are generated by the same
general mechanism. Most T cells have receptors of the 

type. The variable regions of  chains are made up of V and
J segments, whereas those of 
 chains have V, D, and J

regions. Other T cells have  receptors. The variable
regions of  chains, like those of  chains, have V and J
segments.  chains are encoded within the TCR locus,
and their variable regions are made up of V, D, and J segments.  but not 
 chains can express more than one D
region per chain.

The Major
Histocompatibility
Complex and Antigen
Presentation

A

lthough both T and B cells use surface
molecules to recognize antigen, they
accomplish this in very different ways. In
contrast to antibodies or B-cell receptors,
which can recognize an antigen alone, T-cell receptors
only recognize pieces of antigen that are positioned on
the surface of other cells. These antigen pieces are held
within the binding groove of a cell surface protein called the
major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecule,
encoded by a cluster of genes collectively called the MHC
locus. These fragments are generated inside the cell
following antigen digestion, and the complex of the
antigenic peptide plus MHC molecule then appears on
the cell surface. MHC molecules thus act as a cell surface
vessel for holding and displaying fragments of antigen so
that approaching T cells can engage with this molecular
complex via their T-cell receptors.
The MHC got its name from the fact that the genes in
this region encode proteins that determine whether a
tissue transplanted between two individuals will be
accepted or rejected. The pioneering work of Benacerraf,
Dausset, and Snell helped to characterize the functions
controlled by the MHC, specficially, organ transplant fate
and the immune responses to antigen, resulting in the
1980 Nobel Prize in Medicine and Physiology for the
trio (see Table 1-2). Follow-up studies by Rolf
Zinkernagel and Peter Doherty illustrated that the
proteins encoded by these genes play a seminal role in
adaptive immunity by showing that T cells recognize
MHC proteins as well as antigen. Structural studies done
by Don Wiley and others showed that different MHC
proteins bind and present different antigen fragments.
There are many alleles of most MHC genes, and the
specific alleles one inherits play a significant role in
susceptibility to disease, including the development of
autoimmunity. The mechanisms by which this family of
molecules exerts such a strong influence on the
development of immunity to nearly all types of antigens

the study of the MHC far beyond its origins in the field of

There are two main classes of MHC molecules: class I
and class II. These two molecules are very similar in their
final quaternary structure, although they differ in how
they create these shapes via primary through quaternary
protein arrangements. Class I and class II MHC molecules
also differ in terms of which cells express them and in the
source of the antigens they present to T cells. Class I
molecules are present on all nucleated cells in the body
and specialize in presenting antigens that originate from

the cytosol, such as viral proteins. These are presented to
CD8 T cells, which recognize and kill cells expressing
such intracellular antigens. In contrast, class II MHC
molecules are expressed almost exclusively on a subset of
leukocytes called antigen-presenting cells (APCs) and
specialize in presenting antigens from extracellular spaces
that have been engulfed by these cells, such as fungi and
extracellular bacteria. Once expressed on the cell surface,
the MHC class II molecule presents the antigenic peptide
to CD4 T cells, which then become activated and go on
to stimulate immunity directed primarily toward
destroying extracellular invaders.
This chapter will begin by discussing the structure of
MHC molecules, followed by the genetic organization of
the DNA region that encodes these proteins and
inheritance patterns. We then turn to the function of the
MHC in regulating immunity, including reference to
several seminal studies in these areas. In this section we
also discuss regulation of MHC expression. This is
followed by a detailed discussion of the cellular pathways
that lead to antigen degradation and association with each
type of MHC molecule (antigen processing) and the
appearance of these MHC-peptide complexes on the cell
surface for recognition by T cells (antigen presentation).
The role of particular APCs in these processes will also be
presented (no pun intended!). The chapter concludes with
a discussion of unique processing and presentation
pathways, such as cross-presentation and the handling of
nonpeptide antigens by the immune system.

The Structure and Function
of MHC Molecules
Class I and class II MHC molecules are membrane-bound
glycoproteins that are closely related in both structure and
function. Both classes of MHC molecule have been isolated
and purified, and the three-dimensional structures of their
extracellular domains have been resolved by x-ray crystallography. These membrane glycoproteins function as highly
specialized antigen-presenting molecules with grooves that
form unusually stable complexes with peptide ligands, displaying them on the cell surface for recognition by T cells via
T-cell receptor (TCR) engagement. In contrast, class III
MHC molecules are a group of unrelated proteins that do
not share structural similarity or function with class I and II
molecules, although many of them do participate in other
aspects of the immune response.

Class I Molecules Have a Glycoprotein Heavy
Chain and a Small Protein Light Chain
Two polypeptides assemble to form a single class I MHC
molecule: a 45-kilodalton (kDa)  chain and a 12-kDa

␤2-microglobulin molecule (Figure 8-1, left). The  chain is
organized into three external domains (1, 2, and 3), each
approximately 90 amino acids long; a transmembrane domain
of about 25 hydrophobic amino acids followed by a short
stretch of charged (hydrophilic) amino acids; and a cytoplasmic anchor segment of 30 amino acids. Its companion,
2-microglobulin, is similar in size and organization to the
3 domain. 2-microglobulin does not contain a transmembrane region and is noncovalently bound to the MHC class I
 chain. Sequence data reveal strong homology between the
3 domain of MHC class I, 2-microglobulin, and the constant-region domains found in immunoglobulins.
The 1 and 2 domains interact to form a platform of
eight antiparallel  strands spanned by two long -helical
regions (Figure 8-2a). The structure forms a deep groove, or
cleft, with the long  helices as sides and the  strands of the
 sheet as the bottom (Figure 8-2b). This peptide-binding
groove is located on the top surface of the class I MHC molecule, and it is large enough to bind a peptide of 8 to 10 amino
acids. During the x-ray crystallographic analysis of class I
molecules, small noncovalently associated peptides that had
co-crystallized with the protein were found in the groove.
The big surprise came when these peptides were later discovered to be processed self-proteins bound to this deep groove
and not the foreign antigens that were expected.
The 3 domain and 2-microglobulin are organized into
two  pleated sheets each formed by antiparallel  strands of
amino acids. As described in Chapter 3, this structure, known
as the immunoglobulin fold, is characteristic of immunoglobulin domains. Because of this structural similarity, which
is not surprising given the considerable sequence similarity
with the immunoglobulin constant regions, class I MHC molecules and 2-microglobulin are classified as members of the
immunoglobulin superfamily (see Figure 3-19). The 3
domain appears to be highly conserved among class I MHC
molecules and contains a sequence that interacts strongly with
the CD8 cell surface molecule found on TC cells.
All three molecules (class I  chain, 2-microglobulin,
and a peptide) are essential to the proper folding and expression of the MHC-peptide complex on the cell surface. This is
demonstrated in vitro using Daudi tumor cells, which are
unable to synthesize 2-microglobulin. These tumor cells
produce class I MHC  chains but do not express them on
the cell membrane. However, if Daudi cells are transfected
with a functional gene encoding 2-microglobulin, class I
molecules will appear on the cell surface.

Class II Molecules Have Two Non-Identical
Glycoprotein Chains
Class II MHC molecules contain two different polypeptide
chains, a 33-kDa  chain and a 28-kDa  chain, which associate by noncovalent interactions (see Figure 8-1, right). Like
class I  chains, class II MHC molecules are membranebound glycoproteins that contain external domains, a transmembrane segment, and a cytoplasmic anchor segment. Each

molecules are classified as members of the immunoglobulin superfamily.
chain in a class II molecule contains two external domains: 1
and 2 domains in one chain and 1 and 2 domains in the
other (Figure 8-2c). The membrane-proximal 2 and 2
domains, like the membrane-proximal 3/2-microglobulin
domains of class I MHC molecules, bear sequence similarity
to the immunoglobulin-fold structure. For this reason, class II
MHC molecules are also classified in the immunoglobulin
superfamily. The 1 and 1 domains form the peptide-binding
groove for processed antigen (Figure 8-2d). Although similar
to the peptide-binding groove of MHC class I, this groove is
thus formed by the association of two separate chains.
X-ray crystallographic analysis reveals the similarity
between these two classes of molecule, strikingly apparent when
class I and class II molecules are superimposed (Figure 8-3).
Interestingly, despite the fact that these two structures are
encoded quite differentially (one chain versus two), the final
quaternary structure is similar and retains the same overall
function: the ability to bind antigen and present it to T cells.
The peptide-binding groove of class II molecules, like that found
in class I molecules, is composed of a floor of eight antiparallel
 strands and sides of antiparallel  helices, where peptides
typically ranging from 13 to 18 amino acids can bind. The class
II molecule lacks the conserved residues in the class I molecule
that bind to the terminal amino acids of short peptides, and
therefore forms more of an open pocket. In this way, class I
presents more of a socket-like opening, whereas class II pos-

sesses an open-ended groove. The functional consequences of
these differences in fine structure will be explored below.

Class I and II Molecules Exhibit Polymorphism
in the Region That Binds to Peptides
Several hundred different allelic variants of class I and II
MHC molecules have been identified in humans. Any one
individual, however, expresses only a small number of these
molecules—up to six different class I molecules and 12 or
more different class II molecules. Yet this limited number of
MHC molecules must be able to present an enormous array
of different antigenic peptides to T cells, permitting the
immune system to respond specifically to a wide variety of
antigenic challenges. Thus, peptide binding by class I and II
molecules does not exhibit the fine specificity characteristic
of antigen binding by antibodies and T-cell receptors. Instead,
a given MHC molecule can bind numerous different peptides,
and some peptides can bind to several different MHC molecules. Because of this broad specificity, the binding between a
peptide and an MHC molecule is often referred to as “promiscuous.” This promiscuity of peptide binding allows many
different peptides to match up with the MHC binding groove
and for exchange of peptides to happen on occasion, unlike
the relatively stable, high-affinity cognate interactions of antibodies and T-cell receptors with their specific ligands.

no such requirement for class II peptide binding. The association of peptide and MHC molecule is very stable under
physiologic conditions (Kd values range from ~ 106 to
1010). Thus, most of the MHC molecules expressed on the
membrane of a cell will be associated with a peptide.

FIGURE 8-3 The peptide-binding groove of a human class II
MHC molecule (blue), superimposed over the corresponding
regions of a human class I MHC molecule (red). Overlapping
regions are shown in white. These two molecules create very similar
binding grooves such that most of the structural differences (long
stretches, kinks, bends, etc.) lie outside the peptide-binding regions.
[From J. H. Brown et al., 1993, Nature 364:33.]

Given the similarities in the structures of the peptidebinding grooves in class I and II MHC molecules, it is not
surprising that they exhibit some common peptide-binding
features (Table 8-1). In both types of MHC molecules, peptide ligands are held in a largely extended conformation that
runs the length of the groove. The peptide-binding groove in
class I molecules is blocked at both ends, whereas the ends
of the groove are open in class II molecules (Figure 8-4). As
a result of this difference, class I molecules bind peptides that
typically contain 8 to 10 amino acid residues, whereas the
open groove of class II molecules accommodates slightly
longer peptides of 13 to 18 amino acids. Another difference
is that class I binding requires that the peptide contain specific amino acid residues near the N and C termini; there is

TABLE 8-1

Class I MHC-Peptide Interaction
Class I MHC molecules bind peptides and present them to
CD8 T cells. These peptides are often derived from endogenous intracellular proteins that are digested in the cytosol. The
peptides are then transported from the cytosol into the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), where they interact with class I MHC
molecules. This process, known as the cytosolic or endogenous
processing pathway, is discussed in detail later in this chapter.
Each human or mouse cell can express several unique
class I MHC molecules, each with slightly different rules for
peptide binding. Because a single nucleated cell expresses
about 105 copies of each of these unique class I molecules,
each with its own peptide promiscuity rules, many different
peptides will be expressed simultaneously on the surface of a
nucleated cell. This means that although many of the peptide
fragments of a given foreign antigen will be presented to
CD8 T cells, the set of MHC class I alleles inherited by each
individual will determine which specific peptide fragments
from a larger protein get presented.
The bound peptides isolated from different class I molecules have two distinguishing features: they are 8 to 10
amino acids in length, most commonly 9, and they contain
specific amino acid residues at key locations in the
sequence. The ability of an individual class I MHC molecule to bind to a diverse spectrum of peptides is due to the
presence of the same or similar amino acid residues at
these key positions along the peptides (Figure 8-5). Because
these amino acid residues anchor the peptide into the
groove of the MHC molecule, they are called anchor residues. The side chains of the anchor residues in the peptide
are complementary with surface features of the binding
groove of the class I MHC molecule. The amino acid residues lining the binding sites vary among different class I
allelic variants, and this is what determines the chemical

identity of the anchor residues that can interact with a
given class I molecule.
In a critical study of peptide binding by MHC molecules,
peptides bound by two different class I MHC proteins were
released chemically and analyzed by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) mass spectrometry. More than
2000 distinct peptides were found among the peptide ligands
released from these two class I MHC molecules. Since there

are approximately 105 copies of each class I protein per cell,
it is estimated that each of the 2000 distinct peptides is presented with a frequency of between 100 and 4000 copies per
cell. Evidence suggests that even a single MHC-peptide complex may be sufficient to target a cell for recognition and lysis
by a cytotoxic T lymphocyte with a receptor specific for that
target structure.
All peptides examined to date that bind to class I molecules contain a carboxyl-terminal anchor (e.g., see position
9 in Figure 8-5). These anchors are generally hydrophobic
residues (e.g., leucine, isoleucine), although a few charged
amino acids have been reported. Besides the anchor residue
found at the carboxyl terminus, another anchor is often
found at the second, or second and third, positions at the
amino-terminal end of the peptide. In general, any peptide
of the correct length that contains the same or chemically
similar anchor residues will bind to the same class I MHC
molecule. Knowledge of these key positions and the chemical restrictions for amino acids at these positions may allow
for more nuanced clinical design studies, such as future vaccines targeted at eliciting protective immunity to particular
pathogens.
X-ray crystallographic analyses of class I MHC-peptide
complexes have revealed how the peptide-binding groove in
a given MHC molecule can interact stably with a broad spectrum of different peptides. The anchor residues at both ends
of the peptide are buried within the binding groove, thereby
holding the peptide firmly in place (see Figure 8-4a). Nonameric peptides are bound preferentially. The main contacts
between class I MHC molecules and the peptides they bind

but the binding characteristics are determined by the central
13 residues. The peptides that bind to a particular class II
molecule often have internal conserved sequence motifs, but
unlike class I–binding peptides, they appear to lack conserved anchor residues (see Table 8-1). Instead, hydrogen
bonds between the backbone of the peptide and the class II
molecule are distributed throughout the binding site rather
than being clustered predominantly at the ends of the site as
is seen in class I–bound peptides. Peptides that bind to class
II MHC molecules contain an internal sequence of 7 to 10
amino acids that provide the major contact points. Generally, this sequence has an aromatic or hydrophobic residue at
the amino terminus and three additional hydrophobic residues in the middle portion and carboxyl-terminal end of the
peptide. In addition, over 30% of the peptides eluted from
class II molecules contain a proline residue at position 2 and
another cluster of prolines at the carboxyl-terminal end. This
relative flexibility contributes to peptide binding promiscuity.

involve residue 2 at the amino-terminal end and residue 9 at
the carboxyl terminus of the peptide. Between the anchors,
the peptide arches away from the floor of the groove in the
middle (Figure 8-6), allowing peptides that are slightly longer or shorter to be accommodated. Amino acids in the
center of the peptide that arch away from the MHC molecule
are more exposed and presumably can interact more directly
with the T-cell receptor.
Class II MHC-Peptide Interaction
Class II MHC molecules bind and present peptides to CD4
T cells. Like class I molecules, MHC class II molecules can
bind a variety of peptides. These peptides are typically
derived from exogenous proteins (either self or nonself) that
are degraded within the exogenous processing pathway,
described later in this chapter. Most of the peptides associated with class II MHC molecules are derived from self
membrane-bound proteins or foreign proteins internalized
by phagocytosis or by receptor-mediated endocytosis and
then processed through the exogenous pathway.
Peptides recovered from class II MHC-peptide complexes
generally contain 13 to 18 amino acid residues, somewhat
longer than the nonameric peptides that most commonly
bind to class I molecules. The peptide-binding groove in
class II molecules is open at both ends (see Figure 8-4b),
allowing longer peptides to extend beyond the ends, like an
extra-long hot dog in a bun. Peptides bound to class II MHC
molecules maintain a roughly constant elevation on the floor
of the binding groove, another feature that distinguishes
peptide binding to class I and class II molecules.
Peptide-binding studies and structural data for class II
molecules indicate that a central core of 13 amino acids
determines the ability of a peptide to bind class II. Longer
peptides may be accommodated within the class II groove,

General Organization and
Inheritance of the MHC
Every vertebrate species studied to date possesses the tightly
linked cluster of genes that constitute the MHC. As we have
just discussed, MHC molecules have the important job of
deciding which fragments of a foreign antigen will be “seen”
by the host T cells. In general terms, MHC molecules face a
similar ligand binding challenge to that faced, collectively, by
B-cell and T-cell receptors: they must be able to bind a wide
variety of antigens, and they must do so with relatively
strong affinity. However, these immunologically relevant
molecules meet this challenge using very different strategies.
Although B- and T-cell receptor diversity is generated
through genomic rearrangement and gene editing (described
in Chapter 7), MHC molecules have opted for a combination
of peptide binding promiscuity (discussed above) and the
expression of several different MHC molecules on every cell
(described below). Using this clever combined strategy, the
immune system has evolved a way of maximizing the
chances that many different regions, or epitopes, of an antigen will be recognized.
Studies of the MHC gene cluster originated when it was
found that the rejection of foreign tissue transplanted between
individuals in a species was the result of an immune response
mounted against cell surface molecules, now called histocompatibility antigens. In the mid-1930s, Peter Gorer, who was
using inbred strains of mice to identify blood-group antigens,
identified four groups of genes that encode blood-cell antigens.
He designated these I through IV. Work carried out in the 1940s
and 1950s by Gorer and George Snell established that antigens
encoded by the genes in the group designated as II took part in
the rejection of transplanted tumors and other tissue. Snell
called these histocompatibility genes; their current designation
as histocompatibility-2 (H-2, or MHC) genes in the mouse was
in reference to Gorer’s original group II blood-cell antigens.

FIGURE 8-7 Comparison of the organization of the major
histocompatibility complex (MHC) in mouse and human. The
MHC is referred to as the H-2 complex in mice and as the HLA complex in humans. In both species, the MHC is organized into a number
of regions encoding class I (pink), class II (blue), and class III (green)

gene products. The class I and II gene products shown in this figure
are considered to be the classical MHC molecules. The class III gene
products include other immune function–related compounds such
as the complement proteins (C’) and tumor necrosis factors (TNF-
and Lymphotoxin ).

The MHC Locus Encodes Three Major
Classes of Molecules

human, this region in mouse is noncontinuous, interrupted
by the class II and III regions (Figure 8-8). Recall that there
are two chains to the MHC class I molecule: the more
variable and antigen-binding  chain and the common
-2-microglobulin chain. The  chain molecules are encoded
by the K and D regions in mice, with an additional L region
found in some strains, and by the A, B, and C loci in humans.
2-microglobulin is encoded by a gene outside the MHC.
Collectively, these are referred to as classical class I molecules;
all posses the functional capability of presenting protein
fragments of antigen to T cells.
Additional genes or groups of genes within the class I
region of both mouse and human encode nonclassical class I
molecules that are expressed only in specific cell types and
have more specialized functions. Some appear to play a role in
self/nonself discrimination. One example is the class I HLA-G
molecule. These are present on fetal cells at the maternal-fetal
interface and are credited with inhibiting rejection by maternal CD8 T cells by protecting the fetus from identification as
foreign, which may occur when paternally derived antigens
begin to appear on the developing fetus.
Class II MHC molecules are encoded by the IA and IE
regions in mice and by the DP, DQ, and DR regions in
humans (see Figures 8-7 and 8-8). The terminology is somewhat confusing, since the D region in mice encodes class I
MHC molecules, whereas DP, DQ, and DR in humans refers
to class II genes and molecules. Recall that class II molecules
are composed of two chains, both of which interact with

The major histocompatibility complex is a collection of
genes arrayed within a long continuous stretch of DNA on
chromosome 6 in humans and on chromosome 17 in mice.
The MHC is referred to as the human leukocyte antigen
(HLA) complex in humans and as the H-2 complex in mice,
the two species in which these regions have been most studied. Although the arrangement of genes is somewhat different in the two species, in both cases the MHC genes are
organized into regions encoding three classes of molecules
(Figure 8-7):
• Class I MHC genes encode glycoproteins expressed on
the surface of nearly all nucleated cells; the major function of the class I gene products is presentation of
endogenous peptide antigens to CD8 T cells.
• Class II MHC genes encode glycoproteins expressed
predominantly on APCs (macrophages, dendritic cells,
and B cells), where they primarily present exogenous
antigenic peptides to CD4 T cells.
• Class III MHC genes encode several different proteins,
some with immune functions, including components of
the complement system and molecules involved in
inflammation.
Class I MHC molecules were the first discovered and are
expressed in the widest range of cell types. Unlike in the

nonclassical MHC genes are labeled in black. The concept of classical and nonclassical does not apply to class III. Only some of the non-classical

antigen. The class II region of the MHC locus encodes both
the  chain and the  chain of a particular class II MHC
molecule, and in some cases multiple genes are present for
either or both chains. For example, individuals can inherit
up to four functional DR -chain genes, and all of these are
expressed simultaneously in the cell. This allows any DR
-chain gene product to pair with any DR  chain product.
Since the antigen-binding groove of class II is formed by a
combination of the  and  chains, this creates several
unique antigen-presenting DR molecules on the cell.
As with the class I loci, additional nonclassical class II
molecules with specialized immune functions are encoded
within this region. For instance, human nonclassical class II
genes designated DM and DO have been identified. The DM
genes encode a class II–like molecule (HLA-DM) that
facilitates the loading of antigenic peptides into class II
MHC molecules. Class II DO molecules, which are expressed
only in the thymus and on mature B cells, have been shown
to serve as regulators of class II antigen processing.

Class I and II MHC molecules have common structural
features, and both have roles in antigen processing and presentation. By contrast, the class III MHC region encodes
several molecules that are critical to immune function but
have little in common with class I or II molecules. Class III
products include the complement components C4, C2, and
factor B (see Chapter 6), as well as several inflammatory
cytokines, including the two tumor necrosis factor proteins
(TNF- and Lymphotoxin- [TNF-]). Allelic variants of
some of these class III MHC gene products have been linked
to certain diseases. For example, polymorphisms within the
TNF- gene, which encodes a cytokine involved in many
immune processes (see Chapter 4), have been linked to susceptibility to certain infectious diseases and some forms of
autoimmunity, including Crohn’s disease and rheumatic
arthritis. Despite its differences from class I and class II
genes, the linked class III gene cluster is conserved in all species with an MHC region, suggesting similar evolutionary
pressures have come to bear on this cluster of genes.

Adaptive Immunity: Antigen Receptors and MHC

The Exon/Intron Arrangement of Class I and II
Genes Reflects Their Domain Structure
Separate exons encode each region of the class I and II proteins. Each of the mouse and human class I genes has a 5
leader exon encoding a short signal peptide followed by five
or six exons encoding the  chain of the class I molecule
(Figure 8-9a). The signal peptide serves to facilitate insertion
of the  chain into the ER and is removed by proteolytic
enzymes after translation is complete. The next three exons
encode the extracellular 1, 2, and 3 domains, and the
following downstream exon encodes the transmembrane
(Tm) region. Finally, one or two 3-terminal exons encode
the cytoplasmic domains (C).
Like class I MHC genes, the class II genes are organized
into a series of exons and introns mirroring the domain

structure of the  and  chains (Figure 8-9b). Both the 
and the  genes encoding mouse and human class II MHC
molecules have a leader exon, an 1 or 1 exon, an 2 or
2 exon, a transmembrane exon, and one or more cytoplasmic exons.

Allelic Forms of MHC Genes Are Inherited
in Linked Groups Called Haplotypes
The genes that reside within the MHC region are highly
polymorphic; that is, many alternative forms of each gene,
or alleles, exist within the population. The individual genes of
the MHC loci (class I, II, and III) lie so close together that their
inheritance is linked. Crossover, or recombination between
genes, is more likely when genes are far apart. For instance, the
recombination frequency within the H-2 complex (i.e., the

frequency of chromosome crossover events during meiosis,
indicative of the distance between given genes) is only 0.5%.
Thus, crossover occurs only once in every 200 meiotic cycles.
For this reason, most individuals inherit all the alleles
encoded by these genes as a set (known as linkage disequilibrium). This set of linked alleles is referred to as a haplotype. An individual inherits one haplotype from the mother
and one haplotype from the father, or two sets of alleles.
In outbred populations, such as humans, the offspring are
generally heterozygous at the MHC locus, with different
alleles contributed by each of the parents. If, however, mice
are inbred, each H-2 locus becomes homozygous because
the maternal and paternal haplotypes are identical, and all
offspring begin to express identical MHC molecules. Certain
mouse strains have been intentionally inbred in this manner
and are employed as prototype strains. The MHC haplotype
expressed by each of these strains is designated by an arbitrary italic superscript (e.g., H-2a, H-2b). These designations
refer to the entire set of inherited H-2 alleles within a strain
without having to list the specific allele at each locus individually (Table 8-2). Different inbred strains may share the
same set of alleles, or MHC haplotype, with another strain
(i.e., CBA, AKR, and C3H) but will differ in genes outside
the H-2 complex.
Detailed analysis of the H-2 complex in mice has been
made possible by the development of congenic H-2 strains
that differ only at the MHC locus. Inbred mouse strains are
said to be syngeneic, or identical at all genetic loci. Two
strains are congenic if they are genetically identical except at
a single genetic region. Any phenotypic differences that can
be detected between congenic strains is therefore related to
the genetic region that distinguishes the two strains. Congenic strains that are identical with each other except at the

TABLE 8-2

CHAPTER 8

271

MHC can be produced by a series of crosses, backcrosses,
and selections between two inbred strains that differ at the
MHC. A frequently used congenic strain, designated B10.A,
is derived from B10 mice (which is H-2b) genetically manipulated to possess the H-2a haplotype at the MHC locus.
Recombination within the H-2 region of congenic mouse
strains then allows the study of individual MHC genes and
their products. Examples of these are included in the list in
Table 8-2. For example, the B10.A (2R) strain has all the
MHC genes from the a haplotype except for the D region,
which is derived from the H-2b parent.

MHC Molecules Are Codominantly Expressed
The genes within the MHC locus exhibit a codominant form
of expression, meaning that both maternal and paternal gene
products (from both haplotypes) are expressed at the same
time and in the same cells. Therefore, if two mice from inbred
strains possessing different MHC haplotypes are mated, the
F1 generation inherits both parental haplotypes and will
express all these MHC alleles. For example, if an H-2b strain
is crossed with an H-2k strain, then the F1 generation inherits
both parental sets of alleles and is said to be H-2b/k (Figure 8-10a). Because such an F1 generation expresses the
MHC proteins of both parental strains on its cells, it is said
to be histocompatible with both parental strains. This means
offspring are able to accept grafts from either parental
source, each of which expresses MHC alleles viewed as
“self ” (Figure 8-10b). However, neither of the inbred parental strains can accept a graft from its F1 offspring because half
of the MHC molecules (those coming from the other parent)
will be viewed as “nonself,” or foreign, and thus subject to
recognition and rejection by the immune system.

The Major Histocompatibility Complex and Antigen Presentation
In an outbred population such as humans, each individual is generally heterozygous at each locus. The human HLA
complex is highly polymorphic, and multiple alleles of each
class I and class II gene exist. However, as with mice, the
human MHC genes are closely linked and usually inherited
as a haplotype. When the father and mother have different
haplotypes, as in the example shown in Figure 8-10c, there is
a one-in-four chance that siblings will inherit the same
paternal and maternal haplotypes and therefore will be histocompatible (i.e., genetically identical at their MHC loci)
with each other; none of the offspring will be fully histocompatible with the parents.
Although the rate of recombination by crossover is low
within the HLA complex, it still contributes significantly to
the diversity of the loci in human populations. Genetic
recombination can generate new allelic combinations, or
haplotypes (see haplotype R in Figure 8-10c), and the high
number of intervening generations since the appearance of
humans as a species has allowed extensive recombination.
As a result of recombination and other mechanisms for generating mutations, it is rare for any two unrelated individuals
to have identical sets of HLA genes. This makes transplantation between individuals who are not identical twins quite
challenging! To address this, clinicians begin by looking for
family members who will be at least partially histocompatible with the patient, or they rely on donor databases to look
for an MHC match. Even with partial matches, physicians
still need to administer heavy doses of immunosuppressive
drugs to inhibit the strong rejection responses that typically
follow tissue transplantation due to differences in the MHC
proteins (see Chapter 16).

Class I and Class II Molecules Exhibit Diversity
at Both the Individual and Species Levels
As noted earlier, any particular MHC molecule can bind
many different peptides (called promiscuity), which gives the
host an advantage in responding to pathogens. Rather than
relying on just one gene for this task, the MHC region has
evolved to include multiple genetic loci encoding proteins
with the same function. In humans, HLA-A, B, or C molecules can all present peptides to CD8 T cells and HLA-DP,
DQ, or DR molecules can present to CD4 T cells. The MHC
region is thus said to be polygenic because it contains multiple genes with the same function but with slightly different
structures. Since the MHC alleles are also codominantly
expressed, heterozygous individuals will express the gene
products encoded by both alleles at each MHC gene locus. In
a fully heterozygous individual this amounts to 6 unique classical class I molecules on each nucleated cell. An F1 mouse,
for example, expresses the K, D, and L class I molecules from
each parent (six different class I MHC molecules) on the
surface of each of its nucleated cells (Figure 8-11). The
expression of so many individual class I MHC molecules
allows each cell to display a large number of different peptides in the peptide-binding grooves of its MHC molecules.

FIGURE 8-11 Diagram illustrating the various MHC molecules expressed on antigen-presenting cells of a heterozygous H-2k/d mouse. Both the maternal and paternal MHC genes are
expressed (codominant expression). Because the class II molecules are
heterodimers, new molecules containing one maternal-derived and
one paternal-derived chain are also produced, increasing the diversity
of MHC class II molecules on the cell surface. The 2-microglobulin
component of class I molecules (pink) is encoded by a nonpolymorphic gene on a separate chromosome and may be derived from
either parent.

MHC class II molecules have even greater potential for
diversity. Each of the classical class II MHC molecules is
composed of two different polypeptide chains encoded by
different loci. Therefore, a heterozygous individual can
express - combinations that originate from the same
chromosome (maternal only or paternal only) as well as class
II molecules arising from unique chain pairing derived from
separate chromosomes (new maternal-paternal - combinations). For example, an H-2k mouse expresses IAk and IEk
class II molecules, whereas an H-2d mouse expresses IAd and
IEd molecules. The F1 progeny resulting from crosses of these
two strains express four parental class II molecules (identical
to their parents) and also four new molecules that are mixtures from their parents, containing one parent’s  chain and
the other parent’s  chain (as shown in Figure 8-11). Since
the human MHC contains three classical class II genes (DP,
DQ, and DR), a heterozygous individual expresses six class II
molecules identical to the parents and six molecules containing new  and  chain combinations. The number of
different class II molecules expressed by an individual can be
further increased by the occasional presence of multiple
-chain genes in mice and humans, and in humans by the
presence of multiple -chain genes. The diversity generated
by these new MHC molecules likely increases the number of
different antigenic peptides that can be presented and is
therefore advantageous to the organism in fighting infection.

Adaptive Immunity: Antigen Receptors and MHC

The variety of peptides displayed by MHC molecules
echoes the diversity of antigens bound by antibodies and
T-cell receptors. This evolutionary pressure to diversify comes
from the fact that both need to be able to interact with antigen
fragments they have never before seen, or that may not yet
have evolved. However, the strategy for generating diversity
within MHC molecules and the antigen receptors on T and
B cells is not the same. Antibodies and T-cell receptors are
generated by several somatic processes, including gene rearrangement and the somatic mutation of rearranged genes (see
Chapters 7 and 12). Thus, the generation of T- and B-cell
receptors is dynamic, changing over time within an individual. By contrast, the MHC molecules expressed by an individual are fixed. However, promiscuity of antigen binding
ensures that even “new” proteins are likely to contain some
fragments that can associate with any given MHC molecule.

Source: Data obtained from http://hla.alleles.org, a Web site maintained by the
HLA Informatics Group based at the Anthony Nolan Trust in the United Kingdom,
with up-to-date information on the numbers of HLA alleles and proteins.

Collectively, this builds in enormous flexibility within the host
for responding to unexpected environmental changes that
might arise in the future—an elegant evolutionary strategy.
Countering this limitation on the range of peptides that can
be presented by any one individual is the vast array of peptides
that can be presented at the species level, thanks to the diversity
of the MHC in any outbred population. The MHC possesses an
extraordinarily large number of different alleles at each locus
and is one of the most polymorphic genetic complexes known
in higher vertebrates. These alleles differ in their DNA
sequences from one individual to another by 5% to 10%. The
number of amino acid differences between MHC alleles can be
quite significant, with up to 20 amino acid residues contributing to the unique structural nature of each allele. Analysis of
human HLA class I genes as of July 2012 reveals approximately
2013 A alleles, 2605 B alleles, and 1551 C alleles (Table 8-3
shows the number of protein products; not all alleles encode
expressed proteins). In mice, the polymorphism is similarly
enormous. The human class II genes are also highly polymorphic, and in some cases, different individuals can even inherit
different numbers of genes. The number of HLA-DR ␤-chain
genes (DRB) may vary from 2 to 9 in different haplotypes, and
over 1200 alleles of DRB genes alone have been reported. Interestingly, the DRA gene is highly conserved, with only seven
different alleles and two proteins identified. Current estimates
of actual polymorphism in the human MHC are likely on the
low side because the earliest and most detailed data have primarily concentrated on populations of European descent.
This enormous polymorphism results in a tremendous
diversity of MHC molecules within a species. Using the numbers given above for the allelic forms of human HLA-A, -B,
and -C, we can calculate a theoretical number of combinations
that can exist, which is upward of 1.7 billion different class I
haplotypes possible in the population. If class II loci are considered, the numbers are even more staggering, with over 1015
different class II combinations. Because each haplotype contains
both class I and class II genes, multiplication of the numbers
gives a total of more than 1.7 ⫻ 1024 possible combinations of
these class I and II alleles within the entire human population!
Some evidence suggests that a reduction in MHC polymorphism within a species may predispose that species to infectious disease (see Evolution Box 8-1). In one example, cheetahs
and certain other wild cats, such as Florida panthers, that have
been shown to be highly susceptible to viral disease also have
very limited MHC polymorphism. It is postulated that the
present cheetah population arose from a limited breeding
population, or genetic bottleneck, causing a loss of MHC diversity. This increased susceptibility of cheetahs to various viruses
may result from a reduction in the number of different MHC
molecules available to the species as a whole and a corresponding limitation on the range of processed antigens with which
these MHC molecules can interact. As a corollary, this suggests
that the high level of MHC polymorphism that has been
observed in many outbred species, including humans, may
provide a survival advantage by supplying a broad range of
MHC molecules and thus a broad range of presentable antigens.

BOX 8-1

EVOLUTION

The Sweet Smell of Diversity
As early as

the mid-1970s, mate
choice in mice was shown to be influenced by genes at the MHC (H-2) locus.
This was followed by investigations in
other rodents, fish, and birds, all with similar conclusions. Thanks to results from
several studies conducted in the last 15
years, it looks like humans could be added
to this list. However, questions remain as
to the precise evolutionary pressures, the
mechanism, and the magnitude of this
effect, among others, in influencing mate
choice in humans.
In terms of evolutionary pressure, local
pathogens play a significant role in maintaining MHC diversity in the population
and in selecting for specific alleles. As we
now appreciate, this is because the MHC
influences immune responsiveness. Due
to its role in selecting the peptide fragments that will be presented, the inheritance of specific alleles at particular loci
can predispose individuals to either
enhanced susceptibility or resistance to
specific infectious agents and immune
disorders (see Clinical Focus Box 8-2). Over
long time periods, endemic local pathogens exert evolutionary pressures that
drive higher- or lower-than-expected
rates of certain MHC alleles in a population, as well as overrepresentation of
other resistance-associated genes.
The degree of diversity at the MHC
locus clearly influences susceptibility to
disease in populations; witness the
enhanced viral susceptibility seen in
cheetahs (see page 274) and some devastating human stories. For instance, the
European introduction of the smallpox
virus to New World populations is credited with wiping out large Native American groups. This may be due to a lack of
past evolutionary pressure for conservation of resistance-associated MHC alleles,
which would therefore be rare or nonexistent in this population, as well as to a lack
of any individuals with immunity from
prior infection.

But how does an individual evaluate
how well a potential mate will contribute
“new” MHC alleles to one’s offspring, leading to greater diversity and the potential
for enhanced fitness? The primary candidate is odor: the MHC is known to influence odor in many vertebrate species. For
example, the urine of mice from distinct
MHC congenic lines can be distinguished
by both humans and rodents. Mice show
a distinct preference for mating with animals that carry MHC alleles that are dissimilar to their own. In terms of
maximizing the range of peptides that
can be presented, this makes clear evolutionary sense, as increased diversity at the
MHC should increase the number of different pathogenic peptides that can be
“seen” by the immune system, increasing
the likelihood of effective anti-pathogen
responses. To back this up, the advantage
of overall MHC diversity has been shown
experimentally in mice, where most simulated epidemic experiments have found
a survival advantage for H-2 heterozygous
animals over their homozygous counterparts. In humans, research in HIV-infected
individuals has shown that extended survival and a slower progression to AIDS are
correlated with full heterozygosity at the
HLA class I locus, as well as absence of
certain AIDS-associated HLA-B and -C
alleles. This specific link to class I is not
surprising in light of the key role of CD8
T cells in combating viral infections.
Human studies of attraction and mating also point to preferences for individuals with MHC dissimilar alleles. In one key
study involving what is commonly known
as the “sweaty T-shirt test,” college-age
volunteers were asked to rate their preference or sexual attraction to the odor of
T-shirts worn by individuals of the opposite sex. In general, both males and
females preferred the odor of T-shirts
worn by individuals with dissimilar HLA
types. The one key exception was seen in
women who were concurrently using an

estrogen-based birth control pill; they
instead showed a preference for the odors
of MHC-similar individuals, suggesting
that this hormone not only interferes with
this response but that it potentially shifts
the outcome.
But how? you ask. Soluble forms of
MHC molecules have been found in
many bodily fluids, including urine, saliva,
sweat, and plasma. However, these molecules are unlikely to be small or volatile
enough to account for direct olfactory
detection. Other hypotheses for how
MHC might influence odor include via
olfactory recognition of natural ligands
or specific volatile peptides carried by
MHC molecules, or by MHC-driven differences in natural flora, which are also
known to impact body odor. The recent
finding that some polymorphic olfactory
receptor genes are closely linked to the
MHC may also help explain this apparent
association with mating preference. To
date, the jury is still out on which
mechanism(s) likely account(s) for MHCspecific odor differences.
As one might imagine, large methodological challenges are inherent in asking
questions related to mate choice in
humans, where differing levels of outbreeding as well as social and cultural
factors influence the outcome. Nonetheless, it appears that like most primate species tested so far, we humans may also
have the capacity to use smell as an evolutionary strategy for promoting a robust
immune response in our offspring.

Adaptive Immunity: Antigen Receptors and MHC

Although some individuals within a species may not be able to
develop an immune response to a given pathogen and therefore will be susceptible to infection, extreme polymorphism
ensures that at least some members of a species will be resistant
to that disease. In this way, MHC diversity at the population
level may protect the species as a whole from extinction via a
wide range of infectious diseases.

MHC Polymorphism Has Functional Relevance
Although the sequence divergence among alleles of the MHC
within a species is very high, this variation is not randomly
distributed along the entire polypeptide chain. Instead, polymorphism in the MHC is clustered in short stretches, largely
within the membrane-distal 1 and 2 domains of class I
molecules (Figure 8-12a). Similar patterns of diversity are
observed in the 1 and 1 domains of class II molecules.

Structural comparisons have located the polymorphic residues within the three-dimensional structure of the membranedistal domains in class I and class II MHC molecules and
have related allelic differences to functional differences (Figure 8-12b). For example, of 17 amino acids previously shown
to display significant polymorphism among HLA-A molecules, 15 were shown by x-ray crystallographic analysis to be in
the peptide-binding groove of this molecule. The location of so
many polymorphic amino acids within the binding site for
processed antigen strongly suggests that allelic differences contribute to the observed differences in the ability of MHC molecules to interact with a given peptide ligand. Polymorphisms
that lie outside these regions and might affect basic domain
folding are rare. This clustering of polymorphisms around
regions that make contact with antigen also suggest possible
reasons why certain MHC genes or haplotypes can become
associated with certain diseases (see Clinical Focus Box 8-2).

BOX 8-2

CLINICAL FOCUS

MHC Alleles and Susceptibility to Certain Diseases
Some HLA alleles

occur at a
much higher frequency in people suffering from certain diseases than in the general population. The diseases associated
with particular MHC alleles include autoimmune disorders, certain viral diseases,
disorders of the complement system,
some neurologic disorders, and several
different allergies. In humans, the association between an HLA allele and a given
disease may be quantified by determining
the frequency of that allele expressed by
individuals afflicted with the disease, then
comparing these data with the frequency
of the same allele in the general population. Such a comparison allows calculation
of an individual’s relative risk (RR).

RR 

frequency of disease in the allele group
frequency of disease in the allele group

(Eq. 8.1)

A RR value of 1 means that the HLA
allele is expressed with the same frequency
in disease-afflicted and general populations, indicating that this allele confers no
increased risk for the disease. A RR value
substantially above 1 indicates an association between the HLA allele and the disease. For example, individuals with the
HLA-B27 allele are 90 times more likely
(RR  90) to develop the autoimmune
disease ankylosing spondylitis, an inflammatory disease of vertebral joints characterized by destruction of cartilage, than are
individuals who lack this HLA-B allele. Other
disease associations with significantly high
RR include HLA-DQB1 and narcolepsy
(RR  130) and HLA-DQ2 with celiac disease (RR50), an allergy to gluten. A few
HLA alleles have also been linked to relative
protection from disease or clinical progres-

sion. This is seen in the case of individuals
inheriting HLA-B57, which is associated
with greater viral control and a slower progression to AIDS in HIV-infected individuals.
When the associations between MHC
alleles and disease are weak, reflected by
low RR values, it is possible that multiple
genes influence susceptibility, of which only
one lies within the MHC locus. The genetic
origins of several autoimmune diseases,
such as multiple sclerosis (associated with
DR2; RR = 5) and rheumatoid arthritis (associated with DR4; RR = 10) have been studied in depth. The observation that these
diseases are not inherited by simple Mendelian segregation of MHC alleles can be
seen clearly in identical twins, where both
inherit the same MHC risk factor, but frequently only one develops the disease. This
finding suggests that multiple genetic factors
plus one or more environmental factors are at
play in development of this disease. As we
highlight in Chapter 16, this combined role
for genes and the environment in the development of autoimmunity is not uncommon.
The existence of an association
between an MHC allele and a disease
should not be interpreted to imply that
the expression of the allele has caused the
disease. The relationship between MHC
alleles and development of disease is
more complex, partly thanks to the
genetic phenomenon of linkage disequilibrium. The fact that some of the class I
MHC alleles are in linkage disequilibrium
with the class II and class III alleles can
make their contribution to disease susceptibility appear more pronounced than
it actually is. If, for example, DR4 contrib-

The preceding discussion points to additional parallels
between MHC molecules and lymphocyte antigen receptors.
The somatic hypermutations seen in B-cell receptor genes is
also not randomly arrayed within the molecule, but instead
is clustered in the regions most likely to interact directly with
peptide (see Chapter 12), providing yet another example of
how the immune system has solved a similar functional
dilemma using a very different strategy.

utes to risk of a disease and it also occurs
frequently in combination with HLA-A3
because of linkage disequilibrium, then
A3 would incorrectly appear to be associated with the disease. Improved genomic
mapping techniques make it possible to
analyze the fine linkage between genes
within the MHC and various diseases
more fully and to assess the contributions
from other loci. In the case of ankylosing
spondylitis, for example, it has been suggested that alleles of TNF-␣ and Lymphotoxin-␣ may produce protein variants that
are involved in destruction of cartilage,
and these alleles happen to be linked to
certain HLA-B alleles. In the case of HLAB57 and AIDS progression, the allele has
been linked more directly to disease. It is
believed that this class I allele is particularly efficient at presenting important
components of the virus to circulating
Tc cells, leading to increased destruction
of virally infected cells and delayed disease progression.
Other hypotheses have also been
offered to account for a direct role of particular MHC alleles in disease susceptibility. In some rare cases, certain allelic forms
of MHC genes can encode molecules that
are recognized as receptors by viruses or
bacterial toxins, leading to increased susceptibility in the individuals who inherit
these alleles. As will be explored further in
Chapters 15 through 19, in many cases
complex interactions between multiple
genes, frequently including the MHC, and
particular environmental factors are
required to create a bias toward the development of certain diseases.

The Role of the MHC
and Expression Patterns
As we have just discussed, several genetic features help ensure
a diversity of MHC molecules in outbred populations, including polygeny, polymorphism, and codominant expression. All
this attention paid to maximizing the number of different

binding grooves suggests that variety within the MHC plays
an important role in survival (see Clinical Focus Box 8-2). In
fact, in addition to fighting infection, MHC expression
throughout the body plays a key role in maintaining homeostasis and health even when no foreign antigen is present.
Although the presentation of MHC molecules complexed
with foreign antigen to T cells garners much attention (and
space in this book!), most MHC molecules spend their lives
presenting other things, and often to other cells. There are
several reasons why an MHC molecule on the surface of a
cell is important. In general, these include the following:
• To display self class I to demonstrate that the cell is
healthy
• To display foreign peptide in class I to show that the cell
is infected and to engage with TC cells
• To display a self-peptide in class I and II to test developing T cells for autoreactivity (primary lymphoid organs)
• To display a self-peptide in class I and II to maintain tolerance to self-proteins (secondary lymphoid organs)
• To display a foreign peptide in class II to show the body
is infected and activate TH cells
It is worth noting that although some of these instances lead
to immune activation, some do not. It is also important to
note that the cell type, tissue location, and timing of expression vary for each of these situations. For instance, developing T cells first encounter MHC class I and II molecules
presenting self peptides in the thymus, where these signals
are designed to inhibit the ability of T cells to attack selfstructures later (see Chapter 9). Others occur only after
certain types of exposure, such as during an immune
response to extracellular pathogens or when cells in the body
are infected with viral invaders, and is designed to activate T
cells to act against the pathogen (see Chapter 11).
To help set the stage for this discussion, we turn now to
the where, when, and why of MHC expression. This is followed by a description of the how, detailing the pathways
that lead to peptide placement in the binding groove of each
class of molecule. As we will see in greater detail in the following sections, the type of MHC molecule(s) expressed by
a given cell is linked to the role of the cell and the function
of each class of molecule.

MHC Molecules Present Both Intracellular
and Extracellular Antigens
In very general terms, the job of MHC class I molecules is to
collect and present antigens that come from intracellular locations. This is a form of ongoing surveillance of the internal
happenings of the cell—in essence, a window for displaying
on the surface of the cell snippets of what is occurring inside.
Basically, all cells in the body need this form of check and balance, and this shows up in the fairly ubiquitous nature of
MHC class I expression in the body (there are a few notable
exceptions, which we will touch on later). Often, nothing

other than normal cellular processes are occurring in the cytosol, and in these instances our cells present self-peptides in the
groove of MHC class I molecules. The expresssion of self-MHC
class I (with self peptides) signals that a cell is healthy; absence
of self-MHC class I (as can occur in virus-infected and tumor
cells) targets that cell for killing by NK cells (see Chapter 13).
When foreign proteins are present in the cytosol and begin to
appear in the groove of MHC class I on the cell surface, this alerts
CD8 T cells to the presence of this unwelcome visitor, targeting the cell for destruction. In this case, the cell is called a target cell because it becomes a target for lysis by cytotoxic T cells.
Conversely, MHC class II molecules primarily display
peptides that have come from the extracellular spaces of the
body. Since this sampling of extracellular contents is not a
form of policing that all cells need to perform, only specialized leukocytes posses this ability. These cells are collectively
referred to as antigen-presenting cells (APCs), because their
job is to present extracellular antigen to T cells, charging
them with the ultimate job of coordinating the elimination
of this extracellular invader. While all cells in the body
express MHC class I proteins and can present peptides from
foreign intracellular antigens, the term APC is usually
reserved for MHC class II-expressing cells.

MHC Class I Expression Is Found
Throughout the Body
In general, classical class I MHC molecules are expressed
constitutively on almost all nucleated cells of the body. However, the level of expression differs among different cell types,
with the highest levels of class I molecules found on the surface of lymphocytes. These molecules may constitute approximately 1% of the total plasma membrane proteins, or some
5  105 MHC class I molecules per lymphocyte. In contrast,
some other cells, such as fibroblasts, muscle cells, liver hepatocytes, and some neural cells, express very low to undetectable levels of class I MHC molecules. This low-level expression
on liver cells may contribute to the relative success of liver
transplants by reducing the likelihood of graft rejection by Tc
cells of the recipient. A few cell types (e.g., subsets of neurons
and sperm cells at certain stages of differentiation) appear to
lack class I MHC molecules altogether. Nucleated cells without class I expression are, however, very rare. Non-nucleated
cells, such as red blood cells in mammals, do not generally
express any MHC molecules.
In normal, healthy cells, class I molecules on the surface
of the cell will display self-peptides resulting from normal
turnover of self-proteins inside the cell. In cells infected by a
virus, viral peptides as well as self-peptides will be displayed.
Therefore, a single virus-infected cell can be envisioned as
having various class I molecules on its membrane, some
displaying a subset of viral peptides derived from the viral
proteins being manufactured within. Because of individual
allelic differences in the peptide-binding grooves of the class I
MHC molecules, different individuals within a species will
have the ability to bind and present different sets of viral

c08TheMajorHistocompatibilityComplexandAntigenPresentation.indd Page 279 12/20/12 12:33 AM user-t044

The Major Histocompatibility Complex and Antigen Presentation
peptides. In addition to virally infected cells, altered self cells
such as cancer cells, aging body cells, or cells from an allogeneic graft (i.e., from a genetically-different individual), also
can serve as target cells due to their expression of foreign
MHC proteins and can be lysed by TC cells. The importance
of constitutive expression of class I is highlighted by the
response of natural killer (NK) cells to somatic cells that lack
MHC class I, as can occur during some viral infections. NK
cells can kill a cell that has stopped expressing MHC class I
on the surface, presumably because this suggests that the cell
is no longer healthy or has been altered by the presence of an
intracellular invader.

Expression of MHC Class II Molecules Is Primarily
Restricted to Antigen-Presenting Cells
MHC class II molecules are found on a much more restricted
set of cells than class I, and sometimes only after an inducing
event. As mentioned above, cells that display peptides associated with class II MHC molecules to CD4 TH cells are
called antigen-presenting cells (APCs), and these cells are
primarily certain types of leukocytes. APCs are specialized
for their ability to alert the immune system to the presence
of an invader and drive the activation of T cell responses.
Among the various APCs, marked differences in the level
of MHC class II expression have been observed. In some
cases, class II expression depends on the cell’s differentiation
stage or level of activation (such as in macrophages; see
below). APC activation usually occurs following interaction
with a pathogen and/or via cytokine signaling, which then
induces significant increases in MHC class II expression.
A variety of cells can function as bona fide APCs. Their
distinguishing feature is their ability to express class II MHC
molecules and to deliver a costimulatory, or second activating signal, to T cells. Three cell types are known to have these
characteristics and are thus often referred to as professional
antigen-presenting cells (pAPCs): dendritic cells, macrophages, and B lymphocytes. These cells differ from one
another in their mechanisms of antigen uptake, in whether
they constitutively express class II MHC molecules, and in
their costimulatory activity, as follows:
• Dendritic cells are generally viewed as the most effective
of the APCs. Because these cells constitutively express a

high levels of class II MHC molecules and have inherent
costimulatory activity, they can activate naïve TH cells.
• Macrophages must be activated (e.g., via TLR signaling)
before they express class II MHC molecules or costimulatory membrane molecules such as CD80/86.
• B cells constitutively express class II MHC molecules
and posses antigen-specific surface receptors, making
them particularly efficient at capturing and presenting
their cognate antigen. However, they must be activated by,
for example, antigen, cytokines, or pathogen-associated
molecular patterns (PAMPs), before they express the
costimulatory molecules required for activating naïve
TH cells.
Several other cell types, classified as nonprofessional
APCs, can be induced to express class II MHC molecules
and/or a costimulatory signal under certain conditions
(Table 8-4). These cells can be deputized for professional
antigen presentation for short periods and in particular situations, such as during a sustained inflammatory response.

MHC Expression Can Change with
Changing Conditions
As noted above, MHC class I is constitutively expressed by
most cells in the body, whereas class II is only expressed
under certain conditions and in a very limited number of
cell types. The different roles of the two molecules help
explain this, and suggest that in certain instances specific
changes in MHC expression may prove advantageous. The
MHC locus can respond to both positive and negative regulatory pressures. For instance, MHC class I production can
be disrupted or depressed by some pathogens. MHC class II
expression on APCs is already quite variable, and the microenvironment surrounding an APC can further modulate
expression, usually enhancing the expression of these molecules. APCs in particular are conditioned to respond to local
cues leading to their activation and heightened MHC
expression, enabling them to arm other cells in the body for
battle. As one might imagine, this activation and arming of
APCs must be carefully regulated, lest these cells orchestrate
unwanted aggressive maneuvers against self components or
benign companions, as occurs in clinical conditions such as
autoimmunity or allergy, respectively. The mechanisms driving these changes in expression are described below.
Genetic Regulatory Components
The presence of internal or external triggers, such as intracellular invaders or cytokines (see below), can induce a signal
transduction cascade that leads to changes in MHC gene
expression. Research aimed at understanding the mechanism
of control of MHC expression has been advanced by the now
complete sequence of the mouse genome. Both class I and
class II MHC genes are flanked by 5 promoter sequences that
bind sequence-specific transcription factors. The promoter

Adaptive Immunity: Antigen Receptors and MHC

motifs and the transcription factors that bind to these motifs
have been identified for a number of MHC genes, with
examples of regulation mediated by both positive and negative elements. For example, a class II MHC transcriptional
activator called CIITA (also known as class II, major histocompatibility complex, transactivator) and another transcription factor called RFX, have both been shown to activate
the promoter of class II MHC genes. Defects in these transcription factors cause one form of bare lymphocyte syndrome. Patients with this disorder lack class II MHC molecules
on their cells and suffer from severe immunodeficiency, highlighting the central role of class II molecules in T-cell maturation and activation.
Viral Interference
One clear example of negative regulation of MHC comes
from viruses that interfere with MHC class I expression and
thus avoid easy detection by CD8 T cells. These viruses
include human cytomegalovirus (CMV), hepatitis B virus
(HBV), and adenovirus 12 (Ad12). In some cases, reduced
expression of class I MHC molecules is due to decreased
levels of a component needed for peptide transport or MHC
class I assembly rather than decreased transcription. For
example, in the case of cytomegalovirus infection, a viral
protein binds to 2-microglobulin, preventing assembly of
class I MHC molecules and their transport to the plasma
membrane. Adenovirus 12 infection causes a pronounced
decrease in transcription of the transporter genes (TAP1 and
TAP2). As described in the following section on antigen
processing, the TAP gene products play an important role in
peptide transport from the cytoplasm into the rough endoplasmic reticulum (RER). Blocking of TAP gene expression
inhibits peptide transport; as a result, class I MHC molecules
cannot assemble with 2-microglobulin or be transported to
the cell membrane. These observations are especially important because decreased expression of class I MHC molecules,
by whatever mechanism, is likely to help viruses evade the
immune response. Lower levels of class I decrease the likelihood that virus-infected cells can display viral peptide complexes on their surface and become targets for CTL-mediated
destruction.
Cytokine-Mediated Signaling
The expression of MHC molecules is externally regulated by
various cytokines. Leading among these are the interferons
(, , and 	) and the tumor necrosis factors (TNF- and
Lymphotoxin-), each of which have been shown to increase
expression of class I MHC molecules on cells. Typically,
phagocytic cells that are involved in innate responses, or
locally infected cells, are the first to produce these MHCregulating cytokines. In particular, IFN- (produced by a
cell following viral or bacterial infection) and TNF-
(secreted by APCs after activation) are frequently the first
cytokines to kick off an MHC class I up-regulation event. In
the later stages, interferon gamma (IFN-	), secreted by activated TH cells as well as other cell types, also contributes to
increased MHC expression.

Binding of these cytokines to their respective receptors
induces intracellular signaling cascades that activate transcription factors and alter expression patterns. These factors
bind to their target promoter sequences and coordinate
increased transcription of the genes encoding the class I 
chain, 2-microglobulin, and other proteins involved in
antigen processing and presentation. IFN-	 has been shown
to induce expression of the class II transcriptional activator
(CIITA), thereby indirectly increasing expression of class II
MHC molecules on a variety of cells, including non-APCs
(e.g., skin keratinocytes, intestinal epithelial cells, vascular
endothelium, placental cells, and pancreatic beta cells).
Other cytokines influence MHC expression only in certain cell types. For example, IL-4 increases expression of
class II molecules in resting B cells, turning them into more
efficient APCs. Conversely, expression of class II molecules
by B cells is down-regulated by IFN-	. Corticosteroids and
prostaglandins can also decrease expression of class II MHC
molecules. These naturally occurring, membrane-permeable
compounds bind to intracellular receptors and are some of
the most potent suppressors of adaptive immunity, primarily
based on this ability to inhibit MHC expression. This property is exploited in many clinical settings, where these compounds are used as treatments to suppress overly zealous
immune events, such as in allergic responses or during
transplant rejection (see Chapters 15 and 16).
Class II MHC Alleles Play a Critical Role
in Immune Responsiveness
MHC haplotype plays a strong role in the outcome of an
immune response, as these alleles determine which fragments
of protein will be presented. Recall that class II MHC molecules present foreign antigen to CD4 TH cells, which go on to
activate B cells to produce serum antibodies. Early studies by
Benacerraf in which guinea pigs were immunized with simple
synthetic antigens were the first to show that the ability of an
animal to mount an immune response, as measured by the
production of serum antibodies, is determined by its MHC
haplotype. Later experiments by H. McDevitt, M. Sela, and
their colleagues used congenic (matched at the MHC locus
but not elsewhere) and recombinant congenic mouse strains
to specifically map the control of immune responsiveness to
class II MHC genes. In early reports, the genes responsible for
this phenotype were designated Ir or immune response genes;
retaining the initial I, mouse class II products are now called
IA and IE. We now know that the dependence of immune
responsiveness on the genes within the class II MHC reflects
the central role of these molecules in determining which fragments of foreign proteins are presented as antigen to TH cells.
Two explanations have been proposed to account for this
variability in immune responsiveness observed among different haplotypes. According to the determinant-selection
model, different class II MHC molecules differ in their ability
to bind particular processed antigens. In the end, some peptides may be more crucial to eliminating the pathogen than
others. A separate hypothesis, termed holes-in-the-repertoire
model, postulates that T cells bearing receptors that recognize

c08TheMajorHistocompatibilityComplexandAntigenPresentation.indd Page 281 12/20/12 12:33 AM user-t044

/Volumes/203/MHR00209/siL52070/disk1of1/0071052070

The Major Histocompatibility Complex and Antigen Presentation
certain foreign antigens which happen to closely resemble
self-antigens may be eliminated during T-cell development,
leaving the organism without these cells/receptors for future
responses to foreign molecules. Since the T-cell response to
an antigen involves a trimolecular complex of the T-cell
receptor, an antigenic peptide, and an MHC molecule (discussed in detail in Chapter 11), both models appear correct.
That is, the absence of an MHC molecule that can bind and
present a particular peptide, or the absence of T-cell receptors
that can recognize a given MHC-peptide molecule complex,
both result in decreased immune responsiveness to a given
foreign substance, and can account for the observed relationship between MHC haplotype and the ability to respond to
particular exogenous antigens.

T Cells Are Restricted to Recognizing Peptides
Presented in the Context of Self-MHC Alleles
In the 1970s a series of experiments were carried out to further explore the relationship between the MHC and immune
response. These investigations contributed two very crucial
discoveries: (1) that both CD4 and CD8 T cells can recognize antigen only when it is presented in the groove of an
MHC molecule, and (2) that the MHC haplotype of the APC
and the T cell must match. This happens naturally in the
host, where T cells develop alongside host APCs, both
expressing only that individual’s MHC molecules (see Chapter 9). This constraint is referred to as self-MHC restriction,
which refers to the dual specificity of T cells for self MHC as
well as for foreign antigen.
A. Rosenthal and E. Shevach showed that antigen-specific
proliferation of TH cells occurs only in response to antigen
presented by macrophages of the same MHC haplotype as
the T cells recognizing the antigen. In their experimental
system, guinea pig macrophages from strain 2 were initially
incubated with an antigen (Figure 8-13). After the “antigenpulsed” macrophages had processed the antigen and presented it on their surface, they were mixed with T cells from
the same strain (strain 2), a different strain (strain 13), or
their F1 progeny (2 X 13), and the magnitude of T-cell proliferation in response to the antigen-pulsed macrophages
was measured. The results of these experiments showed that
strain-2 antigen-pulsed macrophages activated T cells from
strain-2 and F1 mice but not T cells from strain-13 animals.
Similarly, strain-13 antigen-pulsed macrophages activated
strain-13 and F1 T cells but not strain-2 T cells. Subsequently, congenic and recombinant congenic strains of mice,
which differed from each other only in selected regions of
the MHC were used as the source of macrophages and T
cells. These experiments confirmed that the CD4 TH cell is
activated and proliferates only in the presence of antigenpulsed macrophages that share class II MHC alleles. Thus,
antigen recognition by the CD4 TH cell is said to be class II
MHC restricted. In 1974, Zinkernagel and Doherty similarly
demonstrated the self-MHC class I restriction of CD8 T cells
(see Classic Experiment Box 8-3). Over two decades later,
the pair was awarded the Nobel Prize in Medicine for their

seminal studies (see Table 1-2 for a list of Nobel Prizes

thymus, where only T cells that recognize self-MHC are
selected for survival.

CLASSIC EXPERIMENT

Demonstration of the Self-MHC Restriction of CD8 T Cells
In 1974, R. M. Zinkernagel and P. C.

Doherty demonstrated that CD8 T cells
are restricted to recognizing antigen in
the context of self-MHC molecules. For
this seminal study, they took advantage of
recently derived inbred mice strains, a
virus that causes widespread neurological
damage in infected animals, and new
assays that allowed quantification of cytotoxic T cell responses.
In their experiments, mice were first
immunized with lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV), a pathogen that

results in central nervous system inflammation and neurological damage. Several days later, the animals’ spleen cells,
which included TC cells specific for the
virus, were isolated and incubated with
LCMV-infected target cells of the same
or different haplotype (Figure 1). The
assay relied on measuring the release of
a radioisotope (51Cr) from labeled target
cells (called a chromium release assay;
see Figure 13-18). They found that the TC
cells killed syngeneic virus-infected target cells (or cells with matched MHC

cells from this LCMV-primed mouse were then added to target cells of different H-2 haplotypes that
were intracellularly labeled with 51Cr (black dots) and either infected or not with the LCMV. CTL-mediated
killing of the target cells, as measured by the release of 51Cr into the culture supernatant, occurred only
if the target cells were infected with LCMV and had the same MHC haplotype as the CTLs. [Adapted from

alleles) but not uninfected cells or
infected cells from a donor that shared
no MHC alleles with these cytotoxic
cells.
Later studies with congenic and
recombinant congenic strains showed
that the TC cell and the virus-infected target cell must specifically share class I
molecules encoded by the K or D regions
of the MHC. Thus, antigen recognition by
CD8 cytotoxic T cells is class I MHC
restricted. In 1996, Doherty and Zinkernagel were awarded the Nobel Prize in
Medicine for their major contribution to
understanding the role of the MHC in cellmediated immunity.
Before this discovery, histocompatibility antigens were mainly blamed for transplantation rejection, but their importance
in the everyday process of cellular immunity was not appreciated. Zinkernagel and
Doherty’s discovery is all the more revolutionary when one takes into consideration
that little was known about cellular immunity and no T-cell receptor had yet been
discovered!
This milestone in immunologic understanding set the stage for the development of two key models of how T cells
respond to foreign antigen: altered self and
dual recognition. The altered self hypothesis posited that histocompatibility molecules that associate with foreign particles,
such as viruses, may appear to be altered
forms of self-proteins. The dual recognition
model proposed that T cells must be capable of simultaneous recognition of both
the foreign substance and these selfhistocompatibility molecules. We now
appreciate the validity of both of these
models, and the role of MHC restriction in
the immune response to both microorganisms and allogeneic transplants.

The Major Histocompatibility Complex and Antigen Presentation
Processing of Antigen Is Required
for Recognition by T Cells
In the 1980s, K. Ziegler and E. R. Unanue showed that an
intracellular processing step by APCs was required to activate T cells. These researchers observed that TH-cell activation by bacterial protein antigens was prevented by treating
the APCs with paraformaldehyde prior to antigen exposure
(in essence, killing the cells and immobilizing the antigens in
the membrane; see Figure 8-14a). However, if the APCs were
first allowed to ingest the antigen and were fixed with paraformaldehyde 1 to 3 hours later, TH-cell activation still
occurred (Figure 8-14b). During that interval of 1 to 3 hours,
the APCs had taken up the antigen, processed it into peptide
fragments, and displayed these fragments on the cell membrane in a form capable of activating T cells.
Subsequent experiments by R. P. Shimonkevitz showed
that internalization and processing could be bypassed if
APCs were exposed to already digested peptide fragments
instead of the native antigen (Figure 8-14c). In these experi-

ments, APCs were treated with glutaraldehyde (this chemical, like paraformaldehyde, fixes the cell, rendering it
metabolically inactive) and then incubated with native ovalbumin or with ovalbumin that had been subjected to partial
enzymatic digestion. The digested ovalbumin was able to
interact with the glutaraldehyde-fixed APCs, thereby activating ovalbumin-specific TH cells. However, the native ovalbumin failed to do so. These results suggest that antigen
processing requires the digestion of the protein into peptides
that can be recognized by the ovalbumin-specific TH cells.
At about the same time, several investigators, including W.
Gerhard, A. Townsend, and their colleagues, began to identify the proteins of influenza virus that were recognized by TC
cells. Contrary to their expectations, they found that internal
proteins of the virus, such as polymerase and nucleocapsid
proteins, were often recognized by TC cells better than the
more exposed envelope proteins found on the surface of the
virus. Moreover, Townsend’s work revealed that TC cells recognized short linear peptide sequences of influenza proteins.

Adaptive Immunity: Antigen Receptors and MHC

In fact, when noninfected target cells were incubated in vitro
with synthetic peptides corresponding to only short sequences
of internal influenza proteins, these cells could be recognized
by TC cells and subsequently lysed just as well as target cells
that had been infected with whole, live influenza virus. These
findings, along with those presented below, suggest that antigen processing is a metabolic process that digests proteins into
peptides, which can then be displayed on the cell surface
together with a class I or class II MHC molecule.

Endogenous pathway
(class I MHC)

Evidence Suggests Different Antigen
Processing and Presentation Pathways
The immune system typically uses different pathways to
eliminate intracellular and extracellular antigens. As a general rule, endogenous antigens (those generated within the
cell) are processed in the cytosolic or endogenous pathway
and presented on the membrane with class I MHC molecules. Exogenous antigens (those taken up from the extracellular environment by endocytosis) are typically processed in
the exogenous pathway and presented on the membrane
with class II MHC molecules (Figure 8-15).
Experiments carried out by L. A. Morrison and T. J. Braciale provided an excellent demonstration that the antigenic
peptides presented by class I and class II MHC molecules
follow different routes during antigen processing. To do this,
they used a set of T-cell clones specific for an influenza virus
antigen; some recognized the antigen presented by MHC
class I, and others recognized the same antigen presented by
MHC class II. Examining the T-cell responses, they derived
the following general principles about the two pathways:
• Class I presentation requires internal synthesis of virus
protein, as shown by the requirement that the target cell
be infected by live virus, and by the inhibition of class I
presentation observed when protein synthesis was
blocked by the inhibitor emetine.
• Class II presentation can occur with either live or replication-incompetent virus; protein synthesis inhibitors
had no effect, indicating that new protein synthesis is
not a necessary condition of class II presentation.
• Class II, but not class I, presentation is inhibited by
treatment of the cells with an agent that blocks endocytic processing within the cell (e.g., chloroquine).
These studies support the distinction between the processing of exogenous and endogenous antigens. They suggest
a preferential, but not absolute, association of exogenous
antigens with class II MHC molecules and of endogenous
antigens with class I molecules. What they do not show is
that both the APC of choice and the antigen of choice can
influence the outcome, as will be seen later when these rules
are subverted during cross-presentation. In the experiments
described above, association of viral antigen with class I
MHC molecules required replication of the influenza virus
and viral protein synthesis within the target cells, but asso-

FIGURE 8-15 Overview of endogenous and exogenous
pathways for processing antigen. In the endogenous pathway
(left), antigens are degraded by the proteasome, converting proteins
into smaller peptides. In the exogenous pathway (right), extracellular
antigens are engulfed into endocytic compartments where they are
degraded by acidic pH-dependent endosomal and lysosomal
enzymes. The antigenic peptides from proteasome cleavage and
those from endocytic compartments associate with class I or class II
MHC molecules respectively, and the MHC-peptide complexes are
then transported to the cell membrane. It should be noted that the
ultimate fate of most peptides in the cell is neither of these pathways
but rather to be degraded completely into amino acids.
ciation with class II did not. These findings suggested that
the peptides presented by class I and class II MHC molecules
are trafficked through separate intracellular compartments;
class I MHC molecules interact with peptides derived from
cytosolic degradation of endogenously synthesized proteins,
class II molecules with peptides derived from endocytic degradation of exogenous antigens. The next two sections examine these two pathways in detail.

The Major Histocompatibility Complex and Antigen Presentation

The Endogenous Pathway of Antigen
Processing and Presentation
In eukaryotic cells, protein levels are carefully regulated.
Every protein is subject to continuous turnover and is
degraded at a rate that is generally expressed in terms of its
half-life. Some proteins (e.g., transcription factors, cyclins,
and key metabolic enzymes) have very short half-lives.
Denatured, misfolded, or otherwise abnormal proteins also
are degraded rapidly. Defective ribosomal products are polypeptides that are synthesized with imperfections and constitute a large part of the products that are rapidly degraded.
The average half-life for cellular proteins is about 2 days, but
many are degraded within 10 minutes. The consequence of
steady turnover of both normal and defective proteins is a
constant deluge of degradation products within a cell. Most
will be degraded to their constituent amino acids and recycled, but some persist in the cytosol as peptides. The cell
samples these peptides and presents some on the plasma
membrane in association with class I MHC molecules,
where cells of the immune system can sample these peptides
to survey for foreign proteins. The pathway by which these
endogenous peptides are generated for presentation with
class I MHC molecules utilizes mechanisms similar to those
involved in the normal turnover of intracellular proteins, but
exactly how particular proteins are selected for degradation
and peptide presentation still remains unclear.

Peptides Are Generated by Protease
Complexes Called Proteasomes
Intracellular proteins are degraded into short peptides by a
cytosolic proteolytic system present in all cells, called the
proteasome (Figure 8-16a). The large (20S) proteasome is
composed of 14 subunits arrayed in a barrel-like structure of
symmetrical rings. Many proteins are targeted for proteolysis when a small protein called ubiquitin is attached to
them. These ubiquitin-protein conjugates enter the proteasome complex, consisting of the 20S base and an attached
19S regulatory component, through a narrow channel at the
19S end. The proteasome complex cleaves peptide bonds in
an ATP-dependent process. Degradation of ubiquitin-protein
complexes is thought to occur within the central hollow of
the proteasome.
The immune system also utilizes this general pathway of
protein degradation to produce small peptides for presentation by class I MHC molecules. In addition to the standard
20S proteasomes resident in all cells, a distinct proteasome of
the same size can be found in pAPCs and the cells of infected
tissues. This distinct proteasome, called the immunoproteasome, has some unique components that can be induced by
exposure to interferon-	 or TNF- (Figure 8-16b). LMP2
and LMP7, genes that are located within the class I region
(see Figure 8-8) and are responsive to these cytokines,
encode replacement catalytic protein subunits that convert

replaced by proteins encoded by the LMP genes and specific to the
immunoproteasome (1i, 2i, and 5i). This immunoproteasome has
increased proteolytic efficiency for creating peptides that can assemble with MHC class I molecules. [Adapted from M. Groettrup et al. 2010.

standard proteasomes into immunoproteasomes, increasing
the production of peptides that bind efficiently to MHC class
I proteins. The immunoproteasome turns over more rapidly
than a standard proteasome, possibly because the increased
level of protein degradation in its presence may have consequences beyond the targeting of infected cells. It is possible
that in some cases autoimmunity results from increased
processing of self-proteins in cells with high levels of immunoproteasomes.

Peptides Are Transported from
the Cytosol to the RER
Insight into the cytosolic processing pathway came from
studies of cell lines with defects in peptide presentation by
class I MHC molecules. One such mutant cell line, called
RMA-S, expresses about 5% of the normal levels of class I
MHC molecules on its membrane. Although RMA-S cells
synthesize normal levels of class I  chain and 2-microglobulin,
few class I MHC complexes appear on the membrane. A clue
to the mutation in the RMA-S cell line was the discovery by
Townsend and his colleagues that “feeding” these cells peptides restored their level of membrane-associated class I
MHC molecules to normal. These investigators suggested
that peptides might be required to stabilize the interaction
between the class I  chain and 2-microglobulin. The ability

to restore expression of class I MHC molecules on the membrane by feeding the cells predigested peptides suggested that
the RMA-S cell line might have a defect in peptide transport.
Subsequent experiments showed that the defect in the
RMA-S cell line occurs in the protein that transports peptides from the cytoplasm into the RER, where class I molecules are synthesized. When RMA-S cells were transfected
with a functional gene encoding the transporter protein, the
cells began to express class I molecules on the membrane.
The transporter protein, designated TAP (for transporter
associated with antigen processing), is a membrane-spanning
heterodimer consisting of two proteins: TAP1 and TAP2
(Figure 8-17a). In addition to their multiple transmembrane

2i, and 5i (colored spheres) with a proteasome changes its catalytic specificity to favor production of peptides that bind to class I

segments, the TAP1 and TAP2 proteins each have a domain
projecting into the lumen of the RER and an ATP-binding
domain that projects into the cytosol. Both TAP1 and TAP2
belong to the family of ATP-binding cassette proteins found
in the membranes of many cells, including bacteria. These
proteins mediate ATP-dependent transport of amino acids,
sugars, ions, and peptides.
Peptides generated in the cytosol by the proteasome are
translocated by TAP into the RER by a process that requires
the hydrolysis of ATP (Figure 8-17b). TAP has affinity for
peptides containing 8 to 16 amino acids. The optimal peptide length for class I MHC binding is around 9 amino
acids, and longer peptides are trimmed by enzymes present
in the ER, such as ERAP (endoplasmic reticulum aminopeptidase). In addition, TAP appears to favor peptides with
hydrophobic or basic carboxyl-terminal amino acids, the
preferred anchor residues for class I MHC molecules. Thus,
TAP is optimized to transport peptides that are most likely
to interact with class I MHC molecules. The TAP1 and
TAP2 genes map within the class II MHC region, adjacent
to the LMP2 and LMP7 genes, and different allelic forms of
these genes exist within the population. TAP deficiencies
can lead to a disease syndrome that has aspects of both
immunodeficiency and autoimmunity (see Clinical Focus
Box 8-4).

Chaperones Aid Peptide Assembly
with MHC Class I Molecules
Like other proteins destined for the plasma membrane, the
 chain and 2-microglobulin components of the class I
MHC molecule are synthesized on ribosomes on the RER.
Assembly of these components into a stable class I MHC
molecular complex that can exit the RER requires the presence of a peptide in the binding groove of the class I molecule. The assembly process involves several steps and includes
the participation of molecular chaperones that facilitate the
folding of polypeptides.
The first molecular chaperone involved in class I MHC
assembly is calnexin, a resident membrane protein of the
ER. ERp57, a protein with enzymatic activity, and calnexin
associate with the free class I  chain and promote its folding
(Figure 8-18). When 2-microglobulin binds to the  chain,
calnexin is released and the class I molecule associates with
the chaperone calreticulin and with tapasin. Tapasin (TAPassociated protein) brings the TAP transporter into proximity with the class I molecule and allows it to acquire an
antigenic peptide. The TAP protein promotes peptide capture by the class I molecule before the peptides are exposed
to the luminal environment of the RER.
Exoproteases in the ER will act on peptides not associated with class I MHC molecules. One ER aminopeptidase,
ERAP1, removes the amino-terminal residue from peptides
to achieve optimum class I binding size (see Figure 8-18).
ERAP1 has little affinity for peptides shorter than eight
amino acids in length. As a consequence of productive

CLINICAL FOCUS

Deficiencies in TAP Can Lead to Bare Lymphocyte Syndrome
A relatively rare condition known
as bare lymphocyte syndrome (BLS) has
been recognized for more than 20 years.
The lymphocytes in BLS patients express
MHC molecules at below-normal levels
and, in some cases, not at all. Type 1 BLS
is caused by a deficiency in MHC class I
molecules; in type 2 BLS, expression of
class II molecules is impaired. The pathogenesis of type 1 BLS underscores the
importance of the class I family of MHC
molecules in their dual roles of preventing autoimmunity as well as defending
against pathogens.
One study identified a group of
patients with type 1 BLS caused by defects
in TAP1 or TAP2 genes. As described in this
chapter, TAP proteins are necessary for the
loading of peptides onto class I molecules,
a step that is essential for expression of
class I MHC molecules on the cell surface.
Lymphocytes in individuals with TAP deficiency express levels of class I molecules
significantly lower than those of normal
controls. Other cellular abnormalities
include increased numbers of NK and 	
 T
cells and decreased levels of CD8  T
cells. As we will see, the disease manifestations are reasonably well explained by
these deviations in the levels of certain
cells involved in immune function.
In early life, the TAP-deficient individual suffers frequent bacterial infections of
the upper respiratory tract and in the second decade begins to experience chronic
infection of the lungs. It is thought that a
postnasal-drip syndrome common in
younger patients promotes the bacterial
lung infections in later life. Noteworthy is
the absence of susceptibility to severe
viral infection, which is common in immunodeficiencies with T-cell involvement
(see Chapter 18). Bronchiectasis (dilation
of the bronchial tubes) often occurs, and

recurring infections can lead to lung damage that may be fatal. The most characteristic mark of the deficiency is the
occurrence of necrotizing skin lesions on
the extremities and the midface (Figure 1).
These lesions ulcerate and may cause
disfigurement. The skin lesions are probably due to activated NK cells and 	
 T cells;
NK cells were isolated from biopsied skin
from several patients, supporting this possibility. Normally, the activity of NK cells is
limited through the action of killer-cellinhibitory receptors (KIRs), which deliver a
negative signal to the NK cell following
interaction with class I molecules (see
Chapter 13). The lack of class I molecules
in BLS patients with TAP deficiency explains
the excessive activity of the NK cells.

Activation of NK cells further explains the
absence of severe viral infections, which
are limited by NK and 	
 T cells.
The best treatment for the characteristic lung infections appears to be a combination of antibiotics and intravenous
immunoglobulin. Attempts to limit the
skin disease by immunosuppressive regimens, such as steroid treatment or cytotoxic agents, can lead to exacerbation of
lesions and are therefore contraindicated.
Mutations in the promoter region of TAP
that prevent expression of the gene were
found for several patients, suggesting the
possibility of gene therapy, but the cellular distribution of class I is so widespread
that it is not clear what cells would need
to be corrected to alleviate all symptoms.

FIGURE 1
Necrotizing granulomatous lesions in the midface of a patient with TAPdeficiency syndrome. TAP deficiency leads to a condition with symptoms characteristic of
autoimmunity, such as the skin lesions that appear on the extremities and the midface, as well as
immunodeficiency that causes chronic sinusitis, leading to recurrent lung infection. [From S. D. Gadola
et al., 1999, Lancet 354:1598, and 2000, Clinical and Experimental Immunology 121:173.]

The Exogenous Pathway of Antigen
Processing and Presentation
APCs can internalize particulate material by simple phagocytosis (also called “cell eating”), where material is engulfed by
pseudopods of the cell membrane, or by receptor-mediated
endocytosis, where the material first binds to specific surface
receptors. Macrophages and dendritic cells internalize antigen
by both processes. Most other APCs, whether professional or
not, demonstrate little or no phagocytic activity and therefore
typically internalize exogenous antigen only by endocytosis
(either receptor-mediated endocytosis or by pinocytosis, “cell
drinking”). B cells, for example, internalize antigen very effectively by receptor-mediated endocytosis using their antigenspecific membrane immunoglobulin as the receptor.

Peptides Are Generated from Internalized
Antigens in Endocytic Vesicles
Once an antigen is internalized, it is degraded into peptides
within compartments of the endocytic processing pathway.

with the peptide transporter TAP. This association promotes binding
of an antigenic peptide. Antigens in the ER can be further processed
via exopeptidases such as ERAP1, producing fragments ideally
suited for binding to class I. Peptide association stabilizes the class I
molecule-peptide complex, allowing it to be transported from the RER
to the plasma membrane.

As the experiment shown in Figure 8-14 demonstrated,
internalized antigen takes 1 to 3 hours to traverse the endocytic pathway and appear at the cell surface in the form of
class II MHC-peptide complexes. The endocytic antigen
processing pathway appears to involve several increasingly
acidic compartments, including early endosomes (pH 6.0–
6.5); late endosomes, or endolysosomes (pH 4.5–5.0); and
lysosomes (pH 4.5). Internalized antigen progresses
through these compartments, encountering hydrolytic
enzymes and a lower pH in each compartment (Figure 8-19).
Antigen-presenting cells have a unique form of late endosome, the MHC class II-containing compartment (MIIC),
in which final protein degradation and peptide loading
into MHC class II proteins occurs. Within the compartments of the endocytic pathway, antigen is degraded into
oligopeptides of about 13 to 18 residues that meet up with
and bind to class II MHC molecules in late endosomes.
Because the hydrolytic enzymes are optimally active under
acidic conditions (low pH), antigen processing can be
inhibited by chemical agents that increase the pH of the compartments (e.g., chloroquine) as well as by protease inhibitors (e.g., leupeptin).
The mechanism by which internalized antigen moves
from one endocytic compartment to the next has not been
conclusively demonstrated. It has been suggested that early
endosomes from the periphery move inward to become late
endosomes and eventually lysosomes. Alternatively, small

the ER and do not transit past the cis-Golgi. However, in
cells transfected with both the class II MHC genes and
the Ii gene, the class II molecules were localized in the

transport vesicles may carry antigens from one compartment to the next. Eventually the endocytic compartments,
or portions of them, return to the cell periphery, where
they fuse with the plasma membrane. In this way, the surface receptors are recycled.

The Invariant Chain Guides Transport of Class II
MHC Molecules to Endocytic Vesicles
Since APCs express both class I and class II MHC molecules,
some mechanism must exist to prevent class II MHC molecules from binding to the antigenic peptides destined for the
class I molecules. When class II MHC molecules are synthesized within the RER, these class II  chains associate with
a protein called the invariant chain (Ii, CD74). This conserved, non-MHC encoded protein interacts with the class II
peptide-binding groove preventing any endogenously
derived peptides from binding while the class II molecule is
within the RER (Figure 8-20a). The invariant chain also appears
to be involved in the folding of the class II  and  chains, their
exit from the RER, and the subsequent routing of class II
molecules to the endocytic processing pathway from the
trans-Golgi network.
The role of the invariant chain in the routing of class
II molecules has been demonstrated in transfection
experiments with cells that lack both the genes encoding
class II MHC molecules and the invariant chain. Immunofluorescent labeling of these cells transfected only with
class II MHC genes revealed that, in the absence of
invariant chain, class II molecules remain primarily in

Peptides Assemble with Class II MHC
Molecules by Displacing CLIP
Recent experiments indicate that most class II MHCinvariant chain complexes are transported from the RER,
where they are formed, through the Golgi complex and
trans-Golgi network, and then through the endocytic pathway, moving from early endosomes to the MIIC late endosomal compartment in some cases. As the proteolytic activity
increases in each successive compartment, the invariant
chain is gradually degraded. However, a short fragment of the
invariant chain termed CLIP (for class II–associated invariant chain peptide) remains bound to the class II molecule
after the majority of the invariant chain has been cleaved
within the endosomal compartment. Like antigenic peptide,
CLIP physically occupies the peptide-binding groove of the
class II MHC molecule, preventing any premature binding of
antigen-derived peptide (Figure 8-20b).
A nonclassical class II MHC molecule called HLA-DM
is required to catalyze the exchange of CLIP with antigenic
peptides (see Figure 8-20a). The DM and DM genes are
located near the TAP and LMP genes in the MHC complex
of humans, with similar genes in mice (see Figure 8-8).
Like other class II MHC molecules, HLA-DM is a heterodimer of  and  chains. However, unlike other class II
molecules it is relatively nonpolymorphic and is not normally expressed at the cell membrane but is found predominantly within the endosomal compartment. HLA-DM
has been found to associate with the class II MHC  chain
and to function in removing or “editing” peptides, including CLIP, that associate transiently with the binding
groove of classical class II molecules. Peptides that make
especially strong molecular interactions with class II
MHC, creating long-lived complexes, are harder for HLADM to displace, and thus become the repertoire of peptides that ultimately make it to the cell surface as
MHC-peptide complexes.
As with class I MHC molecules, peptide binding is
required to maintain the structure and stability of class II
MHC molecules. Once a peptide has bound, the class II
MHC-peptide complex is transported to the plasma membrane, where the neutral pH appears to enable the complex
to assume a compact, stable form. Peptide is bound so
strongly in this compact form that it is difficult to replace a
class II–bound peptide on the membrane with another peptide at physiologic conditions.

One additional nonclassical member of the class II MHC
family, HLA-DO, like DM, is another relatively nonpolymorphic class II molecule. Unlike other class II molecules,
its expression is not induced by IFN-	. HLA-DO has been
found to act as a negative regulator of antigen binding,
modulating the function of HLA-DM and changing the
repertoire of peptides that preferentially bind to classical
class II molecules. In cells that express both DO and DM,
these two molecules strongly associate in the ER and maintain this interaction all the way to the endosomal compartments. Although this interaction has been recognized for
many years, the function of this negative regulator and the
impact of this changed peptide repertoire is only now being
resolved.
Originally observed only in B cells and the thymus, the
cellular expression profile of HLA-DO has recently been
expanded to dendritic cells (DCs), where it is thought to
play a role in the maintenance of self-tolerance (discussed
further in Chapter 16). This phenomenon was studied by L.
K. Denzin and colleagues using diabetes-prone mice engineered to express human HLA-DO. DCs are known to be
essential in the establishment of self-tolerance, as well as in
the presentation of autoantigens to self-reactive T cells. Selfreactive T cells develop in these non-obese diabetic animals,
and these cells ultimately destroy pancreatic  cells, causing

the rough endoplasmic reticulum, a newly synthesized class II MHC
molecule binds an invariant chain. The bound invariant chain prevents premature binding of peptides to the class II molecule and
helps to direct the complex to endocytic compartments containing
peptides derived from exogenous antigens. Digestion of the invariant chain leaves CLIP, a small fragment remaining in the binding
groove of the class II MHC molecule. HLA-DM, a nonclassical MHC
class II molecule present within the MIIC compartment, mediates
exchange of antigenic peptides for CLIP. The nonclassical class II
molecule HLA-DO may act as a negative regulator of class II antigen
processing by binding to HLA-DM and inhibiting its role in the dissociation of CLIP from class II molecules. (b) Comparison of threedimensional structures showing the binding groove of HLA class II
molecules (1, 1) containing different antigenic peptides or CLIP.
The red lines show HLA-DR4 complexed with collagen II peptide,
yellow lines are HLA-DR1 with influenza hemagglutinin peptide,
and dark blue lines are HLA-DR3 associated with CLIP. (N indicates
the amino-terminus and C the carboxyl-terminus of the peptides.)
No major differences in the structures of the class II molecules or in
the conformation of the bound peptides are seen. This comparison
shows that CLIP binds the class II molecule in a manner identical to
that of antigenic peptides. [Part b from A. Dessen et al., 1997, Immunity

diabetes. In this study, the development of diabetes was
blocked by the presence of the HLA-DO transgene in DCs.
In addition, using specific monoclonal antibodies, they
showed that the repertoire of peptides being presented to
the autoreactive T cells was significantly altered, resulting in
a reduced efficiency in presenting key self-peptides. This
and other work suggest that normal DO expression may
play an important role in modulating DM behavior to
ensure the presentation of a self-peptide repertoire that
encourages tolerance to self-antigens. Interestingly, in wildtype mice and humans, DO expression is down-regulated
following DC activation by antigen, releasing HLA-DM to
carry out its normal function of encouraging the presentation of a diverse array of peptides, many of which will presumably be derived from the foreign proteins that stimulated
these APCs.
Figure 8-21 illustrates the endogenous pathway (left side)
and compares it with the separate exogenous pathway (right),
described above. Whether an antigenic peptide associates
with class I or with class II molecules is partially dictated by
the mode of entry into the cell, either exogenous or endogenous, by the site of processing, and by the cell type. However,
in the next section, we will see that these assignments are not
absolute and that exogenous antigens may, in some APCs, be
presented by class I antigens via a unique pathway.

Cross-Presentation of
Exogenous Antigens
We have seen that after pAPCs internalize extracellular
antigen they can process and present these antigens via
the exogenous pathway. Because pAPCs also express
costimulatory molecules, engagement of CD4 T cells
with these class II MHC-peptide complexes can lead to

activation of T helper responses. On the other hand,
infected cells will generally process and present cytosolic
peptides via the endogenous pathway, leading to class I
MHC-peptide complexes on their surface. However,
unless these infected cells are pAPCs, they will not express
the costimulatory molecules necessary to activate naïve
CD8 T cells. This leaves us with a dilemma: how does the
immune system activate naïve CD8 T cells to eliminate

intracellular microbes unless a professional antigenpresenting cell happens to become infected? And if a
pAPC is not harboring an intracellular infection, how
does this cell present pathogens, such as viruses that have
been engulfed from extracellular sources in ways that will
activate the needed CTL responses (usually mediated by
the endogenous pathway)?
The answer to this dilemma is a process called crosspresentation. In some instances, APCs will divert antigen
obtained by endocytosis (exogenous antigen) to a pathway
that leads to class I MHC loading and peptide presentation
to CTLs (like in the endogenous pathway)—in other words,
crossing the two pathways. First reported by Michael Bevan
and later described in detail by Peter Cresswell and colleagues, the phenomenon of cross-presentation requires that
internalized antigens that would normally be handled by the
exogenous pathway leading to class II MHC presentation
somehow become redirected to a class I peptide loading pathway. When this form of antigen presentation leads to the
activation of CTL responses, it is referred to as cross-priming;
when it leads to the induction of tolerance in these CD8
T cells it is called cross-tolerance.

Dendritic Cells Appear to Be the Primary
Cross-Presenting Cell Type
The concept of cross-presentation was first recognized as
early as 1976, but the relevant cell types and mechanisms of
action remained a mystery until more recently. New studies,
focused on subsets of DCs that are now recognized to be the
most efficient of the cross-presenters, are just beginning to
shed light on this process. For example, in vivo depletion or
inactivation of DCs compromises cross-presentation. The
most potent of the cross-presenting DCs appear to reside in
secondary lymphoid organs, where they are believed to
receive antigen from extracellular sources by handoff from
migrating APCs or from dying infected cells. A few other
cells types, such as B cells, macrophages, neutrophils, and
mast cells, have been found capable of cross-presentation in
vitro, although evidence that they cross-present in vivo or
that they have the ability to prime CTL responses (i.e., activate naïve CD8 T cells) is still lacking.

Mechanisms and Functions
of Cross-Presentation
Two possible models have been proposed for how DCs
accomplish cross-presentation. The first hypothesizes that
cross-presenting cells possess special antigen-processing
machinery that allows loading of exogenously derived
peptides onto class I MHC molecules. The second theory
postulates specialized endocytosis machinery that can
send internalized antigen directly to an organelle (such as
a phagosome or early endosome), where peptides from
those antigens are then loaded onto class I MHC mole-

cules using conventional machinery. These two proposed
mechanisms are not mutually exclusive, and evidence for
both exists.
The means by which antigen achieves the crossover
from its exogenous or extracellular origins to the endogenous pathway is unresolved. However, in many instances
cross-presented antigen has been found to enter the cytoplasm. In the early 1990s, it was shown that bead-conjugated
antigens captured by cross-presenting DCs could reach the
cytosol of these cells. Later, M. L. Lin and colleagues showed
that exogenously added cytochrome c, which causes programmed cell death when present in the cytosol, could
induce cross-presenting DCs to undergo apoptosis. It is
now proposed that retro-translocation, or movement of
endocytosed proteins out of endocytic compartments and
into the cytosol, can occur via TAP molecules present in
these endocytic membranes—a sort of backflow out of
endocytic vesicles. However, TAP-independent cross-presentation of some antigens has also been observed, suggesting multiple mechanisms may exist for targeting externally
derived peptides to class I molecules.
The ability of some DCs to cross-present antigens has
great advantage for the host. It allows these APCs to capture
virus from the extracellular environment or from dying cells,
process these viral antigens, and activate CTLs that can
attack virus-infected cells, inhibiting further spread of the
infection. One outstanding question remains: if this pathway
is so important, why don’t all APCs cross-present? The
answer may lie in the fact that cross-presenting cells could
quickly become targets of lysis themselves. Another dilemma
concerns how cross-presenting DCs handle self-peptides
presented in MHC class I. Shouldn’t these cells break tolerance by presenting extracellularly-derived self-peptides to
CD8 T cells, activating anti-self CTL responses?
To help explain how cross-presentation is regulated and
tolerance is maintained, scientists have proposed that DCs
might first need to be “licensed” before they can crosspresent. The cell type postulated to supply this licensing role
is activated CD4 T cells. The way this is believed to work
is that, first, the classical exogenous pathway of antigen
processing in DCs leads to presentation of antigen to CD4
T cells via class II, leading to activation of these cells (Figure 8-22a). These activated helper cells might then return
the favor by inducing costimulatory molecules in the DC
and by cytokine secretion (e.g., IL-2), supplying a “second
opinion” that, respectively, licenses the DC to present internalized antigens via MHC class I and helps activate naïve
CD8 T cells (Figure 8-22b). This requirement for licensing
by a TH cell could help avoid accidental induction of CTLs to
nonpathogenic antigens or self-proteins.
If this is the case, any unlicensed DCs that cross-present
antigens may serve the opposite and equally important purpose. Since they have not received the go-ahead from the TH
cell to activate CTL responses, they may instead induce tolerance in the CD8 T cells they encounter, helping to
dampen reactivity to these antigens.

CD40-CD40L engagement. (b) These activated TH cells can then serve
as a bridge to help activate CTL responses; they provide local IL-2 and
they in turn license the DC to cross-present internalized antigen in
MHC class I, up-regulate costimulatory molecules, and down-regulate
their inhibitory counterparts. DC licensing creates an ideal situation
for the stimulation of antigen-specific CD8 T cell responses. When
the TLRs on these DCs are engaged, this further activates these cells,
providing added encouragement for cross-presentation. Dashed
arrows indicate antigen directed for cross-presentation. [Adapted from
Kurts et al., 2010, Nature Reviews Immunology 10:403.]

Presentation of Nonpeptide Antigens
To this point, the discussion of the presentation of antigens
has been limited to protein antigens and their presentation
by classical class I and II MHC molecules. It is well known

/Volumes/203/MHR00209/siL52070/disk1of1/0071052070

CHAPTER 8

293

that some nonprotein antigens are also recognized by T cells,
and in the 1980s T-cell proliferation was detected in the presence of nonprotein antigens derived from infectious agents.
Many reports now indicate that various types of T cells
(expressing 	
 as well as  T–cell receptors) can react
against lipid antigens, such as mycolic acid, derived from
well-known pathogens, such as Mycobacterium tuberculosis.
These antigens are presented by members of the CD1 family
of nonclassical class I molecules.
CD1 molecules share structural similarity to classical
MHC class I but overlap functionally with MHC class II.
Five human CD1 genes are known; all are encoded on a
chromosome separate from the classical class I molecules
and display very limited polymorphism. Much like classical
MHC class I, CD1 proteins are formed by a transmembrane
heavy chain, composed of three extracellular  domains,
which associates noncovalently with 2-microglobulin. In
terms of trafficking and expression profile, however, most
CD1 molecules resemble MHC class II proteins, moving
intracellularly to endosomal compartments, where they
associate with exogenous antigen. Like MHC class II molecules, CD1 proteins are expressed by many immune cell
types, including thymocytes, B cells, and DCs, although
some members of the family have also been found on hepatocytes and epithelial cells.
Many different lipid or lipid-linked structures have been
found to associate non-covalently with CD1 molecules. In
general, most of these are glycolipid or lipoprotein antigens,
where the lipid moiety fits into deep pockets within the CD1
binding groove and the hydrophilic head group remains
exposed, allowing recognition by T cells. Crystal structures
have demonstrated that CD1 contains a binding groove that
is both deeper and narrower than classical MHC molecules.
These grooves are lined with nonpolar amino acids, which
can easily accommodate lipid structures. Some of these
pockets correspond roughly with the antigen-binding pockets of classical MHC class I and allow antigen access to a
deep groove through a narrow opening—more like a foot
sliding into a shoe (Figure 8-23a). Figure 8-23b illustrates a
comparison of the binding groove of CD1b holding a lipid
antigen with a classical class I molecule complexed with
peptide antigen. The relatively nonspecific manner of antigen association with the CD1 binding groove, which relies
primarily on many hydrophobic interactions, probably
accounts for the diversity of self- and foreign antigens that
can be presented by these nonclassical class I molecules. A
variety of T cells are known to bind these nonclassical MHC
molecules.
It is now hypothesized that short-chain self-lipids with
relatively low affinity are loaded onto CD1 molecules in the
ER, shortly after translation, and allow proper CD1 protein
folding. These self-antigen loaded CD1 molecules then travel
to the cell surface, where in some cases exogenous lipids may
be exchanged with these low-affinity self-antigens. Like with
MHC class II molecules, after endocytosis and movement to
lower pH environments, CD1 proteins are believed to

exchange their self peptide, low-affinity binding partners for
exogenously derived long-chain, high-affinity lipid antigens
resident in phagolysosomes or late endosomes. These newly
loaded CD1 molecules then return to the cell surface for

recognition by CD1-restricted T cells. Recently constructed
transgenic mice that express human CD1 molecules will likely
lead the way to new murine models aimed at better defining
the role of CD1 restricted T cells in protection from infection.

The major histocompatibility complex (MHC) encodes class
I and II molecules, which function in antigen presentation to
T cells, and class III molecules, which have diverse functions.
Class I MHC molecules consist of a large glycoprotein 
chain encoded by an MHC gene, and 2-microglobulin, a
protein with a single domain that is encoded elsewhere.
Class II MHC molecules are composed of two noncovalently associated glycoproteins, the  and  chains, encoded
by separate MHC genes.
MHC genes are tightly linked and generally inherited as a
unit from parents; these linked units are called haplotypes.
MHC genes are polymorphic (many alleles exist for each
gene in the population), polygenic (several different MHC
genes exist in an individual), and codominantly expressed
(both maternal and paternal copies).
MHC alleles influence the fragments of antigen that are
presented to the immune system, thereby influencing susceptibility to a number of diseases.
Class I molecules are expressed on most nucleated cells;
class II molecules are restricted to B cells, macrophages,
and dendritic cells (pAPCs).

■

■

In most cases, class I molecules present processed endogenous antigen to CD8 TC cells and class II molecules
present processed exogenous antigen to CD4 TH cells.
Endogenous antigens are degraded into peptides within
the cytosol by proteasomes, assemble with class I molecules in the RER, and are presented on the membrane to
CD8 TC cells. This is the endogenous processing and
presentation pathway.
Exogenous antigens are internalized and degraded within the
acidic endocytic compartments and subsequently combine
with class II molecules for presentation to CD4 TH cells.
This is the exogenous processing and presentation pathway.
Peptide binding to class II molecules involves replacing a
fragment of invariant chain in the binding groove by a process catalyzed by nonclassical MHC molecule HLA-DM.
In some cases, exogenous antigens in certain cell types
(mainly DCs) can gain access to class I presentation pathways in a process called cross-presentation.
Presentation of nonpeptide (lipid and lipid-linked) antigens
derived from pathogens involves the nonclassical class I–like
CD1 molecules.

ANALYZE THE DATA Smith and colleagues (2002, Journal of

Immunology 169:3105) examined the ability of two peptides
to bind two different allotypes—Ld and Lq—of the mouse class
I MHC molecule. They looked at (a) the binding of a murine
cytomegalovirus peptide (MCMV; amino acid sequence YPHFMPTNL) and (b) a synthesized peptide, tum P91A 14–22
(TQNHRALDL). Before and after pulsing the cells with the
target peptides, the investigators measured the amount of
peptide-free MHC molecules on the surface of cells expressing either Ld, Lq, or a mutant Ld in which tryptophan had been
mutated to arginine at amino acid 97 (Ld W97R). The ability of
the peptide to decrease the relative number of open forms on
the cell surface reflects increased peptide binding to the class I
MHC molecules. Answer the following questions based on the
data and what you have learned from reading this book.

T-Cell Development

T

cells initiate the adaptive immune response by
interacting, via their T-cell receptors, with
MHC/peptide complexes on antigen-presenting
cells that have been exposed to pathogens. The
range of pathogens to which we are exposed is
considerable, and, as described in Chapter 7, vertebrates
have evolved a remarkable mechanism to generate a
comparable range of T-cell (and B-cell) receptor
specificities. Each of the several million T cells
circulating in the body expresses a distinct T-cell
receptor. The generation of this diverse population, with
its diverse receptor repertoire, takes place in the thymus,
an organ both required for and dedicated to the
development of T cells. Immature cells entering the
thymus from the bone marrow express no mature
lymphocyte features and no antigen receptors; those
leaving the thymus are mature T cells that are diverse in
their receptor specificities, and are both tolerant to self
and restricted to self-MHC.
How do we generate such a diverse self-restricted
and self-tolerant group of T cells? This question has
intrigued immunologists for decades and has inspired
and required much experimental ingenuity. The
innovation has paid off and, although our
understanding is not comprehensive, we now have a
fundamental appreciation of the remarkable strategies
taken by the thymus, the nursery of immature T cells or
thymocytes, to produce a functional, safe, and useful
T-cell repertoire.
In this chapter we describe these strategies and
divide T-cell development into two clusters of events:
early thymocyte development, during which a
dizzyingly diverse TCR⫹ population of immature
T cells is generated, and selection events that depend
on TCR interactions to shape this population so that
only those cells that are self-restricted and selftolerant will leave to populate the periphery
(Overview Figure 9-1). Early thymocyte development
is T-cell receptor independent and brings cells
through uncommitted CD4⫺CD8⫺ (double negative,
DN) stages to the T-cell receptor-expressing,

the selection and expansion of cells that have successfully rearranged one of their T-cell receptor genes

The second phase of T-cell development is largely
dependent on T-cell receptor interactions and brings cells
to maturity from the CD4⫹CD8⫹ stage to the CD4⫹ or
CD8⫹ single positive (SP) stage. The events in this last
phase of development include:
1.

positive selection, selection for those cells whose T-cell
receptors respond to self-MHC,

2.

negative selection, selection against those cells whose
T-cell receptors react strongly to self-peptide/MHC
combinations, and

3.

lineage commitment, commitment of thymocytes to
effector cell lineages, including CD4⫹ helper or CD8⫹
cytotoxic populations.

T-cell precursors from the bone marrow travel to the thymus via
the bloodstream, undergo development to mature T cells, and are
exported to the periphery, where they can undergo antigeninduced activation and differentiation into effector cells and
memory cells. Each stage of development occurs in a specific
microenvironment and is characterized by specific intracellular
events and distinctive cell-surface markers. The most immature
thymocytes are CD4CD8 (double negative, DN) and pass
through several stages (DN1-DN4) during which they commit to
the T-cell lineage and begin to rearrange their T-cell receptor (TCR)
gene loci. Those that successfully rearrange their TCR chain proliferate, initiate rearrangement of their TCR chains, and become
CD4CD8 (double positive, DP) thymocytes, which dominate the

300

CD4

thymus. DP thymocytes undergo negative and positive selection
in the thymic cortex (see text and Overview Figure 9-5 for details).
Positively selected thymocytes continue to mature and migrate to
the medulla, where they are subject to another round of negative
selection to self-antigens that include tissue-specific proteins.
Mature T cells express either CD4 or CD8 (single positive, SP) and
leave the thymus with the potential to initiate an immune
response. Although most thymocytes develop into conventional
TCR CD4 or CD8 T cells, some DN and DP thymocyte cells
develop into other cell lineages, including lymphoid dendritic
cells, TCR T cells, natural killer T cells (NKT), regulatory T cells
(TREG), and intraepithelial lymphocytes (IELs), each of which has a
distinct function (see text).

T-Cell Development
Understanding T-cell development has been a
challenge for students and immunologists alike, but it
helps to keep in mind the central purpose of the process:
to generate a large population of T cells that express a
diverse array of receptor specificities that can interact with
self-MHC, but do not respond to self proteins.

CHAPTER 9

301

Bone marrow stem cells

Early Thymocyte Development
T-cell development occurs in the thymus and begins with
the arrival of small numbers of lymphoid precursors
migrating from the bone marrow and blood into the thymus, where they proliferate, differentiate, and undergo
selection processes that result in the development of
mature T cells.
The precise identity of the bone marrow cell precursor
that gives rise to T cells is still debated. However, it is clear
that this precursor, which is directed to the thymus via chemokine receptors, retains the potential to give rise to more
than one type of cell, including natural killer (NK) cells,
dendritic cells (DC), B cells, and even myeloid cells. This
precursor only becomes fully committed to the T-cell lineage
in the late DN2 stage of T-cell development (see Overview
Figure 9-1).
Studies revealed that commitment to the T-cell lineage
was dependent on a receptor, Notch, which had been classically associated with embryonic cell development. Notch, in
fact, regulates the decision of a lymphoid precursor to
become a T versus a B lymphocyte. When a constitutively
active version of Notch1, one of four versions of Notch, is
overexpressed in hematopoietic cells, T cells rather than B
cells develop in the bone marrow. Reciprocally, when the
Notch1 gene is knocked out among hematopoietic precursors, B cells rather than T cells develop in the thymus (!).
The importance of Notch in T-cell commitment was
underscored by an in vitro system for studying T-cell
development. Until recently, we thought that development
of T cells from their hematopoietic precursors required the
intact architecture of the thymus. Whereas B-cell development could be achieved in vitro using a preparation of bone
marrow stem cells grown on stromal cells in the presence of
appropriate cytokines, in vitro studies of T-cell development
once could only be performed using intact fetal thymic
organ culture systems. In 2002, J. C. Zuniga-Pfluker and colleagues demonstrated that T cells could be induced to
develop when bone marrow stem cells were cultured on a
stromal cell line that expressed a ligand for Notch. As shown
in Figure 9-2, growth of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) on
stromal cells that express Notch ligand drives the development of these multipotent stem cells to the T-cell lineage.
This assay system has been invaluable in defining interactions that control early T-cell development and have helped
investigators reveal, for instance, that the transcription factor GATA-3 is a critical participant in Notch-mediated T-cell
commitment.

FIGURE 9-2 Development of T cells from hematopoietic
stem cells on bone marrow stromal cells expressing the
Notch ligand. Investigators can induce lymphoid development
from hematopoietic stem cells in vitro using a combination of stromal cell lines and soluble cytokines and growth factors, as indicated.
Investigators discovered that Notch signaling was the key to inducing development to the T- rather than B-lymphocyte lineage. After
transfecting the stromal cell line with a gene encoding the Notch
ligand, lymphoid precursors would adopt the T-cell lineage. Otherwise, they would develop into B cells. [Adapted from J. C. Zuniga-Pflucker,
2002, Nature Reviews Immunology 4:67–72.]

Thymocytes Progress through Four DoubleNegative Stages
T-cell development is elegantly organized, spatially and temporally. Different stages of development take place in distinct
microenvironments that provide membrane-bound and soluble signals that regulate maturation. After arriving in the thymus from the bone marrow via blood vessels at the
cortico-medullary boundary, T-cell precursors encounter
Notch ligands, which are abundantly expressed by the thymic
epithelium. Recall that T-cell precursors first travel to the
outer cortex where they slowly proliferate, then they pass
through the thymic medulla before exiting at the corticomedullary junction (see Figure 2-6). During the time it takes
cells to develop in the thymus (1 to 3 weeks), thymocytes pass
through a series of stages defined by changes in their cell surface phenotype (see Overview Figure 9-1). The earliest T cells
lack detectable CD4 and CD8 and are therefore referred to as
double-negative (DN) cells. DN T cells can be subdivided

into four subsets (DN1-4) based on the presence or absence of
other cell surface molecules, including c-kit (CD117), the
receptor for stem cell growth factor; CD44, an adhesion molecule; and CD25, the  chain of the IL-2 receptor (Table 9-1).
DN1 thymocytes are the first to enter the thymus and
are still capable of giving rise to multiple cell types. They
express only c-kit and CD44 (c-kitCD44CD25), but
once they encounter the thymic environment and become
resident in the cortex, they proliferate and express CD25,
becoming DN2 thymocytes (c-kitCD44 CD25 ).
During this critical stage of development, the genes for
the TCR , , and  chains begin to rearrange; however, the
TCR  locus does not rearrange, presumably because the
region of DNA encoding TCR genes is not yet accessible to
the recombinase machinery. At the late DN2 stage, T-cell
precursors fully commit to the T-cell lineage and reduce
expression of both c-kit and CD44. Cells in transition
from the DN2 to DN3 (c-kitCD44CD25) stages continue rearrangement of the TCR, TCR, and TCR
chains and make the first major decision in T-cell development: whether to join the TCR or TCR T-cell lineage. Those DN3 T cells that successfully rearrange their
 chain and therefore commit to the TCR T-cell lineage
lose expression of CD25, halt proliferation, and enter the
final phase of their DN stage of development, DN4
(c-kit low/CD44CD25), which mature directly into
CD4CD8 DP thymocytes.

Thymocytes Can Express Either TCR
or TCR Receptors
Vertebrates generate two broad categories of T cells: those
that express TCR and  receptor chains and those that
express TCR and  receptor chains. TCR cells are the
dominant participants in the adaptive immune response in
secondary lymphoid organs; however, TCR cells also play
an important role, particularly in protecting our mucosal
tissues from outside infection. Both types of cells are generated in the thymus, but how does a cell make the decision to
become one or the other? To a large extent, the choice to

become a  or  T cell is dictated by when and how fast
the genes that code for each of the four receptor chains successfully rearrange.
Recall from Chapter 7 that TCR genes are generated by
the shuffling (rearrangement) of V and J (and sometimes D)
segments, an event responsible for the vast diversity of
receptor specificities. Rearrangement of the , , and  loci
begins during the DN2 stage. To become an  T cell, a cell
must generate a TCR chain—an event that depends on a
single in-frame VDJ rearrangement event. To become a 
cell, however, a thymocyte must generate two functional
proteins that depend on two separate in-frame rearrangement events. Probability favors the former fate and, in fact,
T cells are at least three times as likely to become TCR
cells than TCR cells.
TCR T-cell generation is also regulated developmentally. They are the first T cells that arise during fetal development, and provide a very important protective function
perhaps even prior to birth. Studies show, for instance,
that  T cells are required to protect very young mice
against the protozoal pathogen that causes coccidiosis.
However, production of  T cells declines after birth, and
the TCR T-cell population represents only 0.5% of all
mature thymocytes in the periphery of an adult animal
(Figure 9-3).
Most TCR T cells are quite distinct in phenotype and
function from conventional TCR T cells. Most do not
go through the DP stage of thymocyte development and
leave the thymus as mature DN T cells. Many emerge from
the thymus with the ability to secrete cytokines, a capacity
gained by most TCR cells only after they encounter
antigen in secondary lymphoid tissues. The TCR T-cell
population also expresses receptors that are not as diverse
as TCR T cells, and many appear to recognize unconventional antigens, including lipids associated with unconventional MHC molecules. Many take up long-term
residence in mucosal tissues and skin and join innate
immune cells in providing a first line of attack against
invading microbes, as well as the response to cellular
stress.

cells also express an immature receptor complex (the preBCR) that is coded by distinct genes, but is fully analogous
to the pre-TCR.

and ␣␤ thymocytes during mouse fetal development. The
graph shows the percentage of cells in the thymus that are double
negative (CD4CD8) and bear the  T-cell receptor (black) or are
double positive (CD4CD8) and bear the  T-cell receptor (blue).
Fetal animals generate more  T cells than  T cells, but the proportion of  T cells generated drops off dramatically after birth. This
early dominance of TCR cells may have adaptive value: a large portion of these cells express nondiverse TCR specificities for common
pathogen proteins and can mount a quick defense before the more
traditional adaptive immune system has fully developed.

It is important to note that the proliferative phase prior to
 chain rearrangement enhances receptor diversity considerably by generating clones of cells with the same TCR
-chain rearrangement. Each of the cells within a clone can
then rearrange a different -chain gene, thereby generating
an even more diverse population than if the original cell had
undergone rearrangement at both the - and -chain loci
prior to proliferation. TCR -chain gene rearrangement
does not begin until double-positive thymocytes stop proliferating.
Most T cells fully rearrange and express a TCR chain
from only one of their two TCR alleles, a phenomenon
known as allelic exclusion. Allelic exclusion is the result of
inhibition of further rearrangement at the other TCR
allele (which must be fully rearranged to be expressed).
This can be accomplished by reducing RAG expression so
no more rearrangement can occur, as well as by making the
locus inaccessible to further RAG interaction via more
permanent changes in chromatin packaging. The details of
the mechanisms responsible for this shutdown are still
being investigated. However, negative feedback signals
from a successfully assembled pre-TCR/pre-T complex
during -selection clearly have a significant influence.
Other events, including the proliferative burst that follows
-selection, which dilutes RAG protein levels, can also play
a role.
RAG levels continue to change after -selection. They are
restored after the proliferative burst and allow TCR rearrangement to occur. They decrease once again after expression of a successfully assembled TCR dimer.*

For the rest of this chapter, we will focus on the development of TCR T cells, which make up the vast majority of
T lymphocytes in the body and are continually being generated, even after puberty, when the thymus shrinks considerably in size (involutes).

DN Thymocytes Undergo -Selection, Which
Results in Proliferation and Differentiation
Double-negative (DN) thymocytes that have successfully
rearranged their TCR chains are valuable, and are identified and expanded via a process known as -selection (see
Overview Figure 9-1). This process involves a protein that is
uniquely expressed at this stage of development, a 33-kDa
invariant glycoprotein known as the pre–T chain. Pre-T
acts as a surrogate for the real TCR chain, which has yet to
rearrange, and assembles with a successfully rearranged and
translated  chain, as well as CD3 complex proteins. This
precursor TCR/CD3 complex is known as the pre-TCR
(Figure 9-4a) and acts as a sensor by initiating a signal transduction pathway. The signaling that the pre-TCR complex
initiates is dependent on many of the same T-cell specific
kinases used by a mature TCR (see Chapter 3), but does not
appear to be dependent on ligand binding. In fact, little if
any of the complex is expressed on the cell surface; rather,
successful assembly of the complex may be sufficient to acti-

*

The mechanisms that turn off rearrangement at this (DP) stage of
development are not as efficient as those that turn off additional TCR chain
rearrangement. In fact, both TCR alleles successfully rearrange more frequently than we originally supposed. This means that many T cells actually
express two TCR specificities: an interesting reality check that complicates a
fundamentalist interpretation of the clonal selection hypothesis.

Once a young double-positive (DP) thymocyte successfully rearranges and expresses a TCR chain, this chain will
associate with the already produced TCR chain, taking the
place of the surrogate pre-TCR chain, which is no longer
actively expressed (Figure 9-4b). At this point, several
“goals” have been accomplished by the thymus: hematopoietic cell precursors have expanded in the subcapsular cortex,
committed to the T-cell lineage, and rearranged a set of TCR
genes. They have also “chosen” to become a TCR or
TCR T cell. This TCR population now expresses both
CD4 and CD8, and is ready for the second stage of T-cell
development: selection.

T-cell receptor through T-cell development. (a) The pre-TCR.
The pre-TCR is assembled during the DN stage of development when
a successfully rearranged TCR chain dimerizes with the nonvariant
pre-T chain. Like the mature TCR dimer, the pre-TCR is noncovalently associated with the CD3 complex. Assembly of this complex
results in intracellular signals that induce a variety of processes, including the maturation to the DP stage. (b) Mature TCR expressed at the
DP stage of development. Once a DP thymocyte has successfully rearranged a TCR chain, it will dimerize with the TCR, replacing the preT chain. This mature TCR generates the signals that lead to either
positive or negative selection (differentiation or death, respectively),
depending on the affinity of the interaction. Note that the TCR chain
has a shorter intracellular region than the pre-T chain and cannot
generate intracellular signals independently. (c) Mature TCR
expressed at the SP stage. Although the TCR/CD3 complex
expressed by mature SP T cells is structurally the same as that expressed
by DP thymocytes, the signals it generates are distinct. It responds to
high-affinity engagement not by dying, but by initiating cell proliferation, activation, and the expression of effector functions. Low-affinity
signals generate survival signals. The basis for the differences in signals
generated by DP and SP TCR complexes is still unknown.

Positive and Negative Selection
CD4CD8 (DP) thymocytes, small, nonproliferating cells
that reside in the thymic cortex, are the most abundant subpopulation in the thymus, comprising more than 80% of
cells. Most important, they are the first subpopulation of
thymocytes that express a fully mature surface TCR/CD3
complex and are therefore the primary targets of thymic
selection (see Figure 9-1). Thymic selection shapes the TCR
repertoire of DP thymocytes based on the affinity of their
T-cell receptors for the MHC/peptides they encounter as
they browse the thymic cortex.

c09T-CellDevelopment.indd Page 305 12/20/12 5:05 PM user-t044

/Volumes/203/MHR00209/siL52070/disk1of1/0071052070

T-Cell Development
Why is thymic selection necessary? The most distinctive property of the mature T cells is that they recognize
only foreign antigen combined with self-MHC molecules.
However, randomly generated TCRs will certainly have
no inherent affinity for “foreign antigen plus self-MHC
molecules.” They could just as well recognize foreign
MHC/peptide combinations, which would not be useful,
or self-MHC/self-peptide combinations, which could be
dangerous.
Two distinct selection processes are required:
• Positive selection, which selects for those thymocytes
bearing receptors capable of binding self-MHC molecules, resulting in MHC restriction
• Negative selection, which selects against thymocytes
bearing high-affinity receptors for self-MHC/peptide
complexes, resulting in self-tolerance.
Because only self-peptides are presented in the thymus,
and only in association with self-MHC molecules, these two
selection processes ensure that surviving thymocytes
express TCRs that have low affinity for self-peptides in selfMHC. On the other hand, the processes do not guarantee
that the T cells generated will bear receptors with high affinity for any specific self-MHC/foreign peptide combination.
The ability of the immune system to respond to a foreign
antigen depends on the probability that one of the millions
of T cells that survives selection will bind one of the many
MHC/peptide combinations expressed by an antigenpresenting cell that has processed pathogenic proteins outside the thymus.
The vast majority of DP thymocytes (~98%) never
meet the selection criteria and die by apoptosis within the
thymus (Overview Figure 9-5). The bulk of DP thymocyte
death (~95%) occurs among thymocytes that fail positive
selection because their receptors do not specifically recognize self-MHC molecules. These cells do not receive
survival signals through their TCRs, and die by a process
known as death by neglect. A small percentage of cells
(2%–5%) are eliminated by negative selection. Only 2% to
5% of DP thymocytes actually exit the thymus as mature
T cells.
Below, we briefly describe the experimental evidence
for thymic involvement in MHC restriction. We also
describe what is currently known about the positive and
negative selection processes, as well as the models that
have been advanced to explain what is known as “the thymic paradox.”

Thymocytes “Learn” MHC Restriction
in the Thymus
Early evidence for the role of the thymus in selection of the
T-cell repertoire came from chimeric mouse experiments
performed by R. M. Zinkernagel and his colleagues. Recall
that Zinkernagel won the Nobel Prize for showing that
mature T cells are MHC restricted (i.e., they need to recog-

CHAPTER 9

nize antigen in the context of the MHC of their host to
respond; see Classic Experiment in Chapter 8). However, he
and his colleagues were curious to know how T cells became
so “restricted.” They considered two possibilities: Either the
T cell and APC simply had to have matching MHC types
(i.e., an “A” strain T cell had to see an “A” strain antigenpresenting cell) or T cells, regardless of their own MHC type,
“learned” the MHC type of their host sometime during
development. Zinkernagel and colleagues thought that such
learning could take place in the thymus, the T-cell nursery.
To determine if T cells could be “taught” to recognize the
host MHC, they removed the thymus (thymectomized) and
irradiated (A  B) F1 mice so they had no functional
immune system (Figure 9-6). They then reconstituted the
hematopoietic cells with an intravenous infusion of F1 bone
marrow cells, but replaced the thymus with one from a
B-type mouse. (To be certain that the thymus graft did not
contain any mature T cells, they irradiated it before transplantation.)
In this experimental system, T-cell progenitors from the
(A  B) F1 bone marrow would mature within a thymus that
expresses only B-haplotype MHC molecules on its stromal
cells. Would these (A  B) F1 T cells now be MHC restricted
to the B haplotype of the thymus in which they developed?
Or, because they expressed both A and B MHC, would they
be able to recognize both A and B MHC haplotypes? To
answer this question, the investigators infected the chimeric
mice with lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV, the
antigen) and removed the immunized, mature splenic T cells
to see which LCMV-infected target cells (APCs) they could
kill. They tested them against infected APCs from strain A,
strain B, and strain A  B mice. As shown in Figure 9-6,
T cells from the chimeric mice could only lyse LCMVinfected target cells from strain B mice. Thus, the MHC
haplotype of the thymus in which T cells develop determines
their MHC restriction. T cells “learned” which MHC haplotype they are restricted to during their early days in the
thymus. Although once we referred to this process as “T-cell
education,” we now know that it is the consequence of a
brutal selection process.

T Cells Undergo Positive and
Negative Selection
In the thymus, thymocytes come into contact with thymic
epithelial cells that express high levels of class I and class II
MHC molecules on their surface. These self-MHC molecules present self-peptides, which are typically derived from
intracellular or extracellular proteins that are degraded in
the normal course of cellular metabolism. DP thymocytes
undergo positive and negative selection, depending on the
signals they receive when they encounter self-MHC/selfpeptide combinations with their TCRs.
While working to understand negative and positive
selection, it helps to picture an early model that was
advanced by several seminal immunologists (see Overview

Thymic selection involves multiple interactions of DP and SP thymocytes with both the cortical and medullary thymic stromal cells, as
well as dendritic cells and macrophages. Selection results in a mature
T-cell population that is both self-MHC restricted and self-tolerant. DP
thymocytes that express new TCR dimers browse the MHC/
peptide complexes expressed by the cortical thymic epithelial cells
(cTECs). The large majority of DP thymocytes die in the cortex by
neglect because of their failure to bind MHC/peptide combinations
with sufficient affinity. The small percentage whose TCRs bind MHC/

306

peptide with high affinity die by clonal deletion (negative selection).
Those DP thymocytes whose receptors bind to MHC/peptide with
intermediate affinity are positively selected and mature to singlepositive (CD4 or CD8) T lymphocytes. These migrate to the
medulla, where they are exposed to AIRE medullary thymic epithelial cells (mTECs), which express tissue-specific antigens and can
mediate negative selection. Medullary dendritic cells can acquire
mTEC antigens by engulfing mTECs, and mediate negative selection
(particularly of MHC Class II restricted CD4 thymocytes).

only those T cells that could recognize antigen combined with

Figure 9-5). Although we now know that some aspects of
this model are too simplistic, its core principles remain relevant and provide a very useful framework for understanding thymic selection. Briefly, DP thymocytes can be
considered to have one of three fates, depending on the
affinity of their new T-cell receptors for the MHC/selfpeptide combinations that they encounter: If their newly
generated TCRs do not bind to any of the MHC/self-peptides
they encounter on stromal cells, they will die by neglect. If
they bind too strongly to MHC/self-peptide complexes they
encounter, they will be negatively selected. If they bind with
a low, “just right” affinity to MHC/self-peptide complexes,
they will be positively selected and mature to the singlepositive stage of development. (We will also see that cells
that are positively selected in the cortex undergo a second,
very important round of negative selection in the medulla,
following lineage commitment to CD4 or CD8 cells.) We
review the origins of the model and discuss some of the
modifications that have been suggested by recent data
below. See Classic Experiment Box 9-1 for experimental
evidence in support of this model from the earliest TCR
transgenic mouse.
Thymic stromal cells, including epithelial cells, macrophages, and dendritic cells, play essential roles in positive
and negative selection and should be part of our visualization of thymic selection events. Young DP thymocytes are in
intimate contact with these cells and “browse” the MHC/
self-peptides displayed on their surfaces. Each of these cell
types has the capacity to express high levels of class I and
class II MHC proteins, and typically have extended processes that contact many developing thymocytes. Some also
express costimulatory ligands, including CD80 (B7-1) and
CD86 (B7-2). As the thymocytes migrate through the thymus, they encounter multiple different stromal cell surfaces,
and have the opportunity to bind many different MHC/
peptide combinations.

Positive Selection Ensures MHC Restriction
If a CD4CD8 thymocyte recognizes a self-MHC/peptide
complex on the cortical epithelial cells that they browse, it
will undergo positive selection, a process that induces both
survival and differentiation of DP thymocytes. Remarkably,
the majority of newly generated thymocytes do not successfully engage the MHC/peptides they encounter with their
TCRs. Either they have not generated a functional TCR
combination or the combination does not bind MHC/peptide
complexes with sufficient affinity. These cells have “failed”
the positive selection test and die by apoptosis within 3 to
4 days. TCR/MHC/self-peptide interactions that initiate
positive selection are thought to be at least three times lower
in intensity than interactions that initiate negative selecting
signals (Figure 9-7).
The signal cascade generated by positive selecting TCR
interactions has not yet been fully characterized. We do
know that many of the signaling molecules required for

CLASSIC EXPERIMENT

Insights about Thymic Selection from the First TCR Transgenic
Mouse Have Stood the Test of Time
In the late 1980s

Harald von
Boehmer and colleagues published a series
of seminal experiments that provided direct
and compelling evidence for the influence
of T-cell receptor interactions on positive
and negative selection. They recognized
that in order to understand how positive
and negative selection worked, they would
need to be able to trace and compare the
fate of thymocytes with defined T-cell
receptor specificities. But how could one do
that if every one of the hundreds of millions
of normal thymocytes expresses a different
receptor? The researchers decided to
develop a system in which all thymocytes
expressed a T-cell receptor of known specificity, and thereby generated one of the first
TCR transgenic mice.
Transgenic animals are made by injecting a gene under the control of a defined
promoter into a fertilized egg (zygote)
(see Chapter 20). The gene—in fact, often
many copies of the gene—will be incorporated randomly into the genome of the
zygote. Therefore, the gene will be present in all cells of the mouse that develop
from that zygote; however, only those
cells that can activate the promoter will
express the gene.
The team of von Boehmer et al. developed the first TCR transgenic animals by
isolating fully rearranged TCR and TCR
genes of a mature CD8 T-cell line that
was known to be specific for an antigen
expressed only in male mice (the “H-Y”
antigen) in the context of H-2Db Class I
MHC molecules (Figure 1). They generated a genetic construct that included
both rearranged genes under the control
of a T-cell specific promoter and injected
this into a mouse zygote. Since the receptor transgenes were already rearranged,
other TCR gene rearrangements were
suppressed in the transgenic mice (the
phenomenon of allelic exclusion; see text
and Chapter 7); therefore, a very high percentage of the thymocytes in the transgenic mice expressed the TCR
combination specific for the H-Y/H-2Db.
(It turns out that not all thymocytes
expressed this TCR combination. Why not?

308

Recall that allelic exclusion does not operate well for the TCR locus in particular.)
The team’s choice of specificities was
very clever. Because all thymocytes
expressed an anti-male antigen TCR specificity, the researchers could directly compare the phenotype of autoreactive
thymocytes and non-autoreactive thymocytes simply by comparing male and
female mice in the same litter. Because the

MHC restriction of the TCR was known, they
could also observe the influence of MHC
haplotype on thymocyte development
simply by breeding the mice to other
inbred strains.
The results of a comparison of CD4
versus CD8 phenotype among thymocytes in H-2Db male versus female mice is
shown in Figure 1. The primary data from
one of the first publications are shown in

FIGURE 1
Experimental demonstration that negative selection of thymocytes requires both
self-antigen and self-MHC, and positive selection requires self-MHC. In this experiment, H-2Db male and female transgenics were generated by injecting TCR transgenes specific for H-Y
antigen plus the Db MHC molecule into zygotes. The H-Y antigen is expressed only in males. H-2Dd mice
were also generated by backcrossing these transgenics onto an H-2d strain (e.g., BALB/c). FACS analysis
of thymocytes from the transgenics showed that mature CD8 T cells expressing the transgene were
absent in the male H-2Db mice but present in the female H-2Db mice, suggesting that thymocytes that
bind with high affinity to a self antigen (in this case, H-Y antigen in the male mice) are deleted during
thymic development. Results also show that DP but not CD8 thymocytes develop in female H-2Dd
mice, which do not express the proper self-MHC. These findings indicate that positive selection and
maturation require self-MHC interactions. [Adapted from H. von Boehmer and P. Kisielow, 1990, Science 248:1369.]

BOX 9-1
Figure 2 and depict flow cytometric data
of CD4 and CD8 expression of thymocytes.
The flow cytometric profile (see Chapter 20)
of a typical wild-type thymus is shown in
Figure 2a and can be used for comparison.
In this profile, the CD8-expression status of
a cell is shown on the X-axis, the CD4expression status on the Y-axis. The data
are quantified in the upper right corner of
the profile. As you can see, more than 80%
of normal thymocytes are DP, 10% to 15%
are CD4 single positive, 3% to 5% are CD8
single-positive cells, and only a small percentage of cells are DN. How do the CD4
versus CD8 phenotypes of male and
female H-Y TCR transgenic mice (Figure 2b)
differ, and what does this tell you?
Thymocytes in female mice are in all
stages of development: DN, DP, and SP. In
fact, they seem to have an abundance of
mature CD8 SP thymocytes. We’ll come
back to this below. The male mice, however,
have few if any anti-H-Y TCR transgenic DP
thymocytes. These data show that in an
environment where DP thymocytes are
exposed to the antigen for which they are
specific (in this case the male H-Y antigen),
they are eliminated. This result was fully
consistent with the concept of negative
selection and showed that self-reactive
cells were removed from the developing
repertoire, perhaps at the DP stage. However, the mice offered insights into many
more aspects of thymic selection.
Evidence for the role of TCR interactions
in positive selection, for instance, came

(b)

from a different experiment in which the
investigators asked what would happen if
the “correct” restricting element, H-2Db,
was not present in the mouse. To do this
they performed backcrosses of their TCR
transgenic mice to mice that expressed a
different H-2 haplotype, an H-2Dd mouse.
(For those who want to brush up on their
genetics, determine what crosses you
would make to do this, and include a plan
for assessing the genotype of your mice.)
Figure 2c shows the CD4 versus CD8 phenotype of H-Y TCR transgenic thymocytes
from female H-2Db/d mice and H-2Dd mice.
What did they find?
H-2Dd females had no mature T cells,
indicating that in the absence of the MHC
haplotype to which the TCR was restricted,
thymocytes could not mature beyond the
DP stage. These data provided direct evidence for the necessity of a TCR/self-MHC
interaction for thymocyte maturation
(positive selection) to occur.
These “simple” experiments also revealed
a third feature of thymic development and
initiated a controversy that continues to this
day. Return to Figure 2b and take a look at
the female mouse data. Unlike wild-type
thymocytes, which typically include 3%- to
-5% CD8 T cells, 46% of developing thymocytes in the anti-H-Y TCR transgenic were
mature CD8 cells. What did this mean?
Recall that the T-cell line that the TCR genes
came from originally was a CD8 T-cell line,
restricted to Class I MHC (H-2Db). These data
showed that the MHC restriction specificity

of the TCR (in this case, a restriction for
Class I) influenced its CD4 versus CD8 lineage choice. In other words, the results suggested that thymocytes with new TCRs that
preferentially bound Class II would become
CD4 SP mature T cells, and thymocytes
with TCRs that preferentially bound Class I
would develop into CD8 SP mature T cells.
The fundamental conclusions of this
now classic set of experiments have stood
the test of time and have been supported
by many different, equally clever experiments: (1) Negative selection of autoreactive
cells results in their elimination at the DP
stage and beyond. (It is important to note
that it later became clear that the promoter
driving these first H-Y TCR transgenes permitted earlier-than-normal expression of
the TCR, which resulted in elimination of
autoreactive cells at an earlier-than-usual
point in development. Experiments now
indicate that negative selection by clonal
deletion typically occurs after positive
selection as cells transit between the DP
and SP stages of development.) (2) Positive
selection involves a low affinity interaction
between thymocyte TCR and self-MHC/
peptide interactions. (3) Commitment to the
CD4 versus CD8 lineage is determined by the
preference of the TCR for MHC Class I versus
Class II. How this last event happens remains
a topic of intense controversy (see text).

FIGURE 9-7 Relationship between TCR affinity and selection. This figure schematically illustrates the association between
thymocytes’ fate and the affinity of their TCR for self-MHC/peptide
complexes that they encounter in the thymus. Fewer than 5% of
thymocytes produce TCRs that bind to MHC/peptide complexes with
high affinity. Most of these will be deleted by negative selection
(some will become regulatory T cells and other specialized cell types).
More than 90% generate TCRs that either do not bind to MHC/
peptide complexes or bind them with very low affinity. These die by
neglect. Fewer than 5% generate TCRs that bind with just the right
intermediate affinity to self-MHC/peptide complexes. These will survive and mature.

positive selection are also involved in T-cell receptor mediated activation of mature T cells (see Chapter 3), an event,
however, that requires higher-affinity TCR interactions. We
still do not fully understand how low-affinity positive selecting signals initiate maturation to the single-positive stage, or
how they differ from pro-apoptotic negative selecting signals, which are also TCR mediated.
What is the adaptive value of positive selection? Why
didn’t we evolve a system that negatively selects but leaves the
T-cell receptor repertoire otherwise intact? Some have suggested that the paring down of the repertoire is important to
increasing the efficiency of negative selection, as well as to
increasing the efficiency of peripheral T-cell responses. Without positive selection, the system would be cluttered with a
great many cells that are unlikely to recognize anything, and
reduce the probability that a T cell will find “its” antigen in a
reasonable period of time. This is a reasonable speculation;
however, positive selection may also offer more subtle advantages that have often inspired discussion in the field.

Autoreactive CD4CD8 thymocytes with high-affinity
receptors for self-MHC/self-peptide combinations are
potentially dangerous to an organism, and many are killed
by negative selection in the thymus. In fact, errors in the
negative selection process are responsible for a host of autoimmune disorders, including Type 1 diabetes (see Clinical
Focus). Negative selection is defined broadly as any process
that rids a repertoire of autoreactive clones and is responsible for central tolerance. It is likely that most negative
selection occurs via a process known as clonal deletion,
where high-affinity TCR interactions directly induce apoptotic signals.
Clonal deletion of DP thymocytes appears to be optimally
mediated by the same cells (APCs) and same interactions
(high-affinity TCR engagement coupled with costimulatory
signals) that activate mature T cells. Why strong TCR signals
result in death of immature T cells, but proliferation and differentiation of mature T cells (see Figure 9-4c) remains an
active area of investigation.
Thymic dendritic cells and macrophages, which are
found in multiple areas of the thymus, clearly have the ideal
features to mediate negative selection, but interestingly, so
do medullary epithelial cells, which express high levels of
the costimulatory ligands CD80 and CD86 as well as a
unique transcription factor that allows them to present
tissue-specific antigens (see below). Therefore, both the
cortex and the medulla have the potential to induce negative selection.
Do We Delete Thymocytes Reactive
to Tissue-Specific Antigens?
We have seen that MHC molecules can present peptides
derived from both endogenous and exogenous proteins on
the surface of antigen-presenting cells (see Chapter 8).
However, only a fraction of cell types—thymocytes, stromal
cells, macrophages, and other antigen-presenting cells—
reside in the thymus, so we would expect these cells to
produce only a subset of the proteins encoded in the
genome. How, then, can the thymus possibly get rid of
developing T cells that are autoreactive to tissue-specific
antigens—for example, proteins specific to the brain, the
liver, the kidney, or the pancreas?
This question bothered immunologists for a long time. For
a bit, we assumed that other mechanisms of tolerance in the
periphery took care of autoreactivity to tissue-specific proteins,
but investigations in the late 1990s surprised us all and revealed
that the thymus had an extraordinary capacity to express and
present proteins from all over the body. Bruno Kyewski and
colleagues showed that this capacity was a unique feature of
thymic medullary epithelial cells. Diane Mathis, Cristoph Benoist, and their colleagues went on to show that some medullary
epithelial cells express a unique protein, AIRE, that allows cells

BOX 9-2

CLINICAL FOCUS

How Do T Cells That Cause Type 1 Diabetes Escape
Negative Selection?
We have an extensive appreciation
of the pain caused by autoimmune disease and its clinical progression, but
although we have also gained a deeper
understanding of the mechanisms
behind immune tolerance, we still know
little about the precise origins of autoimmune disorders. Indisputably, the primary
cause of autoimmune disease is the
escape of self-reactive lymphocytes—B
cells, T cells, or both—from negative
selection. Surprisingly little is known
about the reasons for this escape, or the
specificity and phenotype of the escapees that cause even the best-characterized
disorders, including Type I diabetes
(T1D), multiple sclerosis (MS), rheumatoid arthritis (RA), and systemic lupus
erythematosus (SLE).
Recent work on a mouse strain, the
non-obese diabetic or NOD mouse, which
is markedly susceptible to Type 1 diabetes, has shed light on the features of the
self-reactive T cells that cause the disease,
and revealed some interesting reasons for
their escape from central tolerance. T1D is
a T-cell mediated autoimmune disease
caused by T cells that kill insulin-producing
beta islet cells in the pancreas. Many of
the autoreactive T cells actually recognize a specific peptide from the insulin
protein itself.

When Emil Unanue and colleagues
examined the fine specificity of T cells
that had infiltrated the islet cells in diabetesprone mice, they found two types of cells:
T cells that could respond to the insulin
peptide that was generated via intracellular MHC Class II processing pathways
by dendritic cells (“Type A” T cells), and an
unexpected population of T cells that
responded to the insulin peptide only if it
were added exogenously to the MHC
Class II molecules on dendritic cells (“Type
B” T cells). The investigators speculate
that the endogenously processed MHC/
insulin peptide combination and the
exogenously formed MHC/insulin peptide complex differ in conformation and
therefore activate different T-cell receptor
specificities.
Perhaps more important, these observations suggest an elegant and precise
reason for the escape of autoreactive T
cells from the thymus. Dendritic cells in
the pancreas, but not other tissues,
appear uniquely capable of forming MHC
Class II/insulin peptide from exogenous
sources, presumably because they are in
an environment replete with extracellular
insulin secreted by the beta islet cells.
Thymic medullary epithelial cells or dendritic cells would not have this capacity,
and therefore “Type B” T cells would sneak

to express, process, and present proteins that are ordinarily
only found in specific organs. This group discovered AIRE
while studying the molecular basis for autoimmunity by examining human disease. They traced a mutation that caused
autoimmune polyendocrinopathy syndrome 1 (APS1, otherwise known as APECED, see Chapter 18) to this gene, and
called it AIRE for “autoimmune regulator.” The title of the
paper that announced their discovery, “Projection of an Immunological Self Shadow within the Thymus by the AIRE Protein,” aptly described AIRE’s powerful function.
AIRE’s mechanism of action is still under investigation. It
has classic features of a transcription factor and may be part

through the negative selection process in
the thymus.
Why “Type A” T cells also escape is less
clear. They are autoreactive to more conventionally processed insulin/MHC Class
II complexes, which are clearly present
on thymic medullary cells. Perhaps Type
A cells expressed too low an affinity for
insulin/MHC Class II peptides in the thymus, but were inspired by the high levels
of insulin and inflammatory signals in a
diabetic islet? Perhaps they escaped negative selection because the level of insulin peptide expression on medullary
epithelium was too low in the NOD
mouse strain? In fact, recent data from
both mice and humans suggest that the
level of insulin expression significantly
influences the progression of disease
and the efficiency of negative selection
in the thymus.
Understandably, most current therapies for autoimmune disease focus on
inhibiting the secondary but most proximal cause of autoimmune disease: the
peripheral activation of autoreactive T and
B cells that escaped negative selection.
However, by defining the molecular reasons for self-reactive lymphocyte escape,
we may ultimately find a way to develop
therapeutic approaches to correct negative selection defects, too.

of a transcriptional complex that facilitates expression of
tissue-specific genes by regulating not only translation, but
also chromatin packing. Thus, it allows medullary epithelial
cells to express proteins not ordinarily found in the thymus,
process them, and present them in MHC molecules. This is
particularly useful for the presentation of MHC Class I peptides and negative selection of CD8 thymocytes. However,
neighboring dendritic cells and macrophages are also
thought to phagocytose medullary epithelial cells and so can
then present their protein contents in MHC Class II molecules,
and mediate negative selection of CD4 thymocytes (see
Overview Figure 9-5).

Adaptive Immunity: Development

Other Mechanisms of Central Tolerance
Other mechanisms of thymic negative selection (central
tolerance) that do not necessarily involve cell death have
been proposed. They include clonal arrest, where thymocytes that express autoreactive T-cell receptors are prevented from maturation; clonal anergy, where autoreactive
cells are inactivated, rather than deleted; and clonal editing,
where autoreactive cells are given a second or third chance
to rearrange a TCR gene. Each of these mechanisms has
some experimental support, but clonal deletion is probably
the most common mechanism responsible for thymic negative selection. The generation of regulatory T cells from
autoreactive thymocytes can certainly be considered of
importance among central tolerance mechanisms and will
be discussed below.
Superantigens
Superantigens, viral or bacterial proteins that bind simultaneously to the V domain of a T-cell receptor and to the 
chain of a Class II MHC molecule (outside the peptide binding groove), can induce activation of all T cells that express
that particular family of V chains (see Figure 11-5). Superantigens are also expressed in the thymus of mice and
humans and influence thymocyte maturation. Because they
mimic high-affinity TCR interactions, superantigens will
induce the negative selection of all DP thymocytes whose
receptors possess V domains targeted by the superantigen.
However, because we continually generate T cells with a
wide range of T-cell receptor specificities, this loss does not
appear to have major clinical consequences.

The Selection Paradox: Why Don’t We Delete
All Cells We Positively Select?
Full understanding of the process of positive and negative
selection requires an appreciation of the following paradox:
If positive selection allows only thymocytes reactive with
self-MHC molecules to survive, and negative selection
eliminates self-MHC-reactive thymocytes, then why are any
T cells allowed to mature? Other factors must operate to
prevent these two MHC-dependent processes from eliminating the entire repertoire of MHC-restricted T cells.
The most straightforward model advanced to explain the
paradox of MHC-dependent positive and negative selection
is the affinity hypothesis,* which asserts that differences in
the strength of TCR-mediated signals received by thymo-

*
Note that a similar version of this hypothesis is also sometimes referred to
as the avidity hypothesis. Avidity and affinity do have distinct meanings,
which can differ for different investigators. For the sake of simplicity, we
consider affinity to mean the strength of interaction between the TCR and
its MHC/peptide ligand. For a more nuanced discussion of the differences
between affinity and avidity and their influence on thymic development, see
the review by Kyewski listed in the reference section of this chapter.

cytes undergoing positive and negative selection determine
the outcome of the interaction. Double-positive thymocytes
that receive low-affinity signals would be positively selected,
those that received high-affinity (autoreactive) signals
would be negatively selected, and those that received no
signal at all would die by neglect (see Figure 9-7 and Overview Figure 9-5).
The OT-I TCR transgenic mouse, developed by Kristin
Hogquist and colleagues, is a superb model for the study of
thymic selection using TCRs and MHC/peptides with
known affinities. Not only is its peptide/MHC specificity
known precisely (it binds a chicken ovalbumin peptide in
the context of the H-2Kb MHC Class I molecule), but its
affinity for a range of peptides that vary in sequence has also
been defined. To determine the influence of affinity on T-cell
development, investigators also took advantage of two other
immunological tools: (1) the fetal thymic organ culture
(FTOC) system, where thymic development can be followed
in vitro (Figure 9-8a), and (2) mice defective in MHC Class
I antigen processing. Several different mutations that lead to
defective MHC Class I presentation exist. An experimental
scheme using the TAP-1 knock out (TAP-1), a mutant
mouse where newly generated peptides cannot access newly
generated MHC Class I molecules (see Chapter 8), is
depicted in Figure 9-8b. These mice cannot load their MHC
Class I with endogenous peptides; they are expressed on the
cell surface but are “empty” and do not hold their shape.
However, they can be loaded with exogenous peptides,
which stabilize their conformation. Therefore, by incubating
fetal thymic organs from these mutant mice with peptides of
choice, investigators were able to control the type of peptide
presented by the MHC Class I.
What did investigators find? As expected, OT-I/TAP-1
fetal thymic organ cultures produced more CD8 cells than
wild-type FTOC. This is because virtually all of their thymocytes expressed a receptor that bound to the variety of
MHC Class I (H-2Kb)/self-peptide complexes expressed by
the normal stroma with intermediate affinity, generating a
signal that results in positive selection (see Classic Experiment Box 9-1). Also, as expected, CD8 mature T cells
failed to develop in OT-I/TAP-1 thymic organ cultures
because there was no normal MHC Class I and, therefore,
no TCR signal—a failure of positive selection, resulting in
death by neglect (see Figure 9-8b, top row). However, when
a low-affinity peptide was added to the OT-I/TAP-1 culture, MHC Class I was able to load itself with peptide and
assume a normal conformation (see Figure 9-8b, middle
row). Positive selection occurred, and CD8 T cells developed successfully. Addition of high-affinity peptides
induced a strong TCR signal and negative selection, resulting in deletion of DP cells in OT-I/TAP-1 thymic organ
cultures (see Figure 9-8b, bottom row). Interestingly, low
concentrations of high-affinity peptides also induced positive selection, although the cells that developed were not
fully functional. These results and many others provided
clear support for the affinity model, showing that the

depends on TCR peptide–MHC class I interactions. The mice used in
this study were transgenic for OT-I TCR  and  chains, which recognize an ovalbumin peptide when associated with MHC Class I; the
proportion of CD8 T cells that develop in these thymi is higher than
normal because all thymocytes in the mouse express the MHC Class
I restricted specificity. Different peptide/MHC complexes interact
with the TCR with different affinities. Varying the peptide added to
FTOC from OT-I/TAP-1 mice revealed that peptides that interact
with low affinities (middle row) resulted in positive selection, and
levels of CD4CD8 cells that approached that seen in the OT-I/
TAP-1 mice. Peptides that interact with high affinities (bottom row)
cause negative selection, and fewer CD4CD8 T cells appeared.

An Alternative Model Can Explain the
Thymic Selection Paradox
Philippa Marrack, John Kappler, and their colleagues
thoughtfully offered an alternative possibility to explain the
“thymic paradox”—that is, why we don’t negatively select all
cells that we positively select. These investigators advanced

Adaptive Immunity: Development

the altered peptide model, a suggestion that cortical epithelium, which induces positive selection, makes peptides that
are unique and distinct from peptides made by all other
cells, including the thymic cells that induce negative selection. Thus, those thymocytes selected on these unique peptide/
MHC complexes would not be negatively selected when they
browse the medulla and other negatively selecting cells.
Initial experiments did not support this model; however,
advances in our ability to analyze peptides presented on cell
surfaces in detail suggests the model has merit. Cortical epithelial cells may, indeed, process peptides differently, and are
likely to present a different array of peptides to developing
T cells. Recall that peptides are processed intracellularly by
several mechanisms, including the activity of the proteosome (see Figure 8-16). It appears that components of the
proteosome expressed by cortical epithelial cells (the “thymoproteasome”) are unique. The thymic epithelium may
also express unique versions of proteases (e.g., cathepsins).
The altered peptide and affinity models are by no means
mutually exclusive. Investigations firmly establish that affinity plays an important role in distinguishing positive from
negative selection. That the cortex may also generate novel
peptides simply underscores the possibility that the thymus
evolved multiple ways to ensure that we would be able to
generate a sufficiently large pool of T cells with diverse
specificities.

Do Positive and Negative Selection Occur
at the Same Stage of Development,
or in Sequence?
Strictly interpreted, the affinity model assumes that positive
and negative selection operate on exactly the same target
population (DP thymocytes) and in the same microenvironment of the thymus (the thymic cortex). Although it is clear
that thymocytes undergo positive selection in the cortex, as
we have seen above, the medulla is the site of negative selection to tissue-specific antigens. This compartmentalization
of function suggests some thymocytes are positively selected
and initiate a maturation program prior to negative selection. That this can happen is supported by observations
showing that “semi-mature” thymocytes—those that have
been positively selected and are in transition from the DP to
the SP stages—are excellent targets of negative selection.
Most likely, thymocytes can be negatively selected at
more than one point of development (illustrated in Overview Figure 9-5). Those thymocytes that bind with high
affinity as they browse MHC/peptide complexes in the cortex are negatively selected, and those that receive positively
selecting signals are given permission not only to mature,
but to migrate to the cortical medullary boundary and ultimately to the medulla. In the medulla, semi-mature thymocytes can again be subject to negative selection if they
interact with high affinity to tissue-specific antigens.
Migration of positively selected thymocytes to the
medulla is now known to be dependent on expression of the

CCR7 chemokine receptor: CCR7 deficient thymocytes fail
to enter the medulla. Interestingly, they still mature and are
exported to the periphery, but there they cause autoimmunity—
an observation that, again, underscores the central importance of the medulla in removing autoreactive cells from the
T-cell repertoire.

Lineage Commitment
As thymocytes are being screened on the basis of their TCR
affinity for self-antigens, they are also being guided in their
lineage decisions. Specifically, a positively selected doublepositive thymocyte must decide whether to join the CD8
cytotoxic T-cell lineage or the CD4 helper T-cell lineage.
Lineage commitment requires changes in genomic organization and gene expression that result in (1) silencing of one
coreceptor gene (CD4 or CD8) as well as (2) expression of
genes associated with a specific lineage function. Immunologists continue to debate about the cellular and molecular
mechanisms responsible for lineage commitment. We will
review the most current perspectives.

Several Models Have Been Proposed to
Explain Lineage Commitment
When early studies with TCR transgenic mice revealed that
affinity for MHC Class I versus Class II preference dictated
the CD8 versus CD4 fate of developing thymocytes (see
Classic Experiment Box 9-1, investigators advanced two
simple testable models to explain how developing T cells
“matched” their TCR preference with their coreceptor
expression.
In the instructive model, TCR/CD4 and TCR/CD8
coengagement generates unique signals that directly initiate
distinct developmental programs (Figure 9-9a). For example, if a thymocyte randomly generated a TCR with an affinity for MHC Class I, the TCR and CD8 would bind MHC
Class I together, and generate a signal that specifically initiated a program that silenced CD4 expression and induced
expression of genes specific for cytotoxic T-cell lineage function. Likewise, TCR/CD4 coengagement would generate a
unique signal that initiated CD8 silencing and the helper
T-cell developmental program.
In the stochastic model, a positively selected thymocyte
randomly down-regulates CD4 or CD8 (Figure 9-9b). Only
those cells that express the “correct” coreceptor—the ones
that can coengage MHC with the TCR—generate a TCR
signal strong enough to survive to mature. In this model,
TCR/CD4 and TCR/CD8 coengagement does not necessarily generate distinct signals. Unfortunately, studies that followed the consequences of such mismatches confounded
researchers by providing evidence in support of both models! Clearly they were too simplistic.
Further experiments challenged some of the assumptions
on which these early efforts were based and indicated that

model, interaction of a coreceptor with the MHC molecule for which
it is specific results in down-regulation of the other coreceptor.
(b) According to the stochastic model, down-regulation of CD4 or CD8
is a random process. (c) According to the kinetic signaling model,
the decision to commit to the CD4 or CD8 lineage is based on the

continuity of the TCR signal that a thymocyte receives. Positive selection results in down-regulation of CD8 on all thymocytes. This will not
alter the intensity of a TCR/CD4/MHC Class II signal, and cells receiving
this signal will continue development to the CD4 SP lineage. However,
down-regulation of CD8 diminishes (interrupts) a TCR/CD8/MHC Class
I signal, an experience that sends a cell toward the CD8 lineage. IL-7
signals are required to “seal” CD8 lineage commitment.

the strength and duration of the T-cell receptor/coreceptor
signal experienced by a thymocyte play a more important
role in dictating cell fate than its specificity for MHC Class I
or Class II. In fact, thymocytes whose TCR had a known
preference of MHC Class II could be coaxed into the CD8⫹
T-cell fate simply by weakening the CD4/Class II interaction
(e.g., by mutating kinases downstream of TCR signaling so
that they signaled more or less effectively). By inhibiting
TCR signaling, investigators could coax cells that normally
commit to the CD4 lineage to become CD8⫹ cells. By

enhancing TCR signaling, investigators could coax MHC
Class I restricted cells to become CD4⫹. These data suggested that stronger positive selecting TCR signals resulted
in CD4 lineage commitment, and weaker positive selecting
TCR signals resulted in CD8 lineage commitment. They
were consistent with the observation that the intracellular
tail of CD4 interacts more effectively with the tyrosine
kinase lck than the intracellular tail of CD8. Therefore, a
TCR/CD4 coengagement is likely to generate stronger signals than TCR/CD8 and result in CD4⫹ T-cell commitment.

Adaptive Immunity: Development

The strength of signal model represented an advance in our
understanding, but it, too, is likely to be too simplistic. Alfred
Singer and colleagues have proposed the kinetic signaling
model, which incorporates historical data, our improved
understanding of changes in CD8 expression during positive
selection, as well as recent advances in the understanding of
the complexity of coreceptor gene silencing (Figure 9-9c).
Briefly, they propose that thymocytes commit to the CD4
T-cell lineage if they receive a continuous signal in response to
TCR/coreceptor engagement, but commit to the CD8 lineage
if the TCR signal is interrupted. We now know that all
CD4CD8 thymocytes down-regulate surface levels of CD8
in response to positive selection. Given this response, only
MHC Class II restricted T cells will maintain continuous
TCR/CD4/MHC Class II interaction, and therefore develop to
the CD4 lineage. However, with the loss of CD8 expression,
MHC Class I restricted T cells will lose the ability to maintain
TCR/CD8/MHC Class I interactions. Singer et al. provide
evidence that these thymocytes, interrupted from their TCR/
coreceptor engagement, are subsequently rescued by IL-7,
which facilitates their commitment to the CD8 lineage.
Transcription factors that specifically regulate development to the CD4 and CD8 lineage have recently been identified. At present, ThPok and Runx3 are taking center stage as
transcriptional factors required for CD4 and CD8 commitment, respectively, although others also play a role. Both
ThPok and Runx3 act, at least in part, by suppressing genes
involved in differentiation to the other lineage. ThPok inhibits expression of genes that regulate CD8 differentiation,
including Runx3. Runx3 inhibits expression of CD4, itself, as
well as ThPok. This is just the beginning of our understanding of the transcriptional networks that regulate CD4 and
CD8 developmental programs. Likely to play a role, too, are
miRNAs; some have already been implicated in CD8 singlepositive T-cell differentiation. There is clearly more to come.

Double-Positive Thymocytes May Commit
to Other Types of Lymphocytes
Small populations of DP thymocytes can also commit to
other T-cell types, including the NK T cell, regulatory T cell,
and intraepithelial lymphocyte (IEL) lineages. NKT cells
(which include mature cells that express only CD4 and cells
that have lost both CD4 and CD8) play a role in innate
immunity (see Chapter 5) and express a TCR that includes
an invariant TCR chain (V14). For this reason, NKT cells
are sometimes referred to as iNKT cells for invariant. Their
invariant TCR interacts not with classical MHC, but with the
related molecule CD1, which presents glycolipids, not peptides (see Chapter 8). Intraepithelial lymphocytes (IEL),
most of which are CD8, also have features of innate
immune cells and patrol mucosal surfaces. Regulatory T cells
(TREG), another CD4 subset discussed in more detail below,
quench adaptive immune reactions. All three subpopulations are thought to develop from DP thymocytes in
response to autoreactive, high-affinity TCR interactions—

the same interactions, in fact, that mediate negative selection. What determines whether a thymocyte undergoes
negative selection or an alternative developmental pathway
remains a topic of much interest.

Exit from the Thymus
and Final Maturation
Once a thymocyte successfully passes through selection and
makes a lineage decision, it enters a quiescent state and
leaves the thymus. The cellular and molecular basis for thymocyte egress was unknown until we gained a better understanding of the receptors and ligands that regulate cell
migration. As mentioned above, one set of investigators discovered that thymocytes failed to enter the medulla if they
were deficient for the CCR7 chemokine receptor. However,
these cells still were able to leave the thymus, indicating that
other receptors control thymic exit. The identity of this
receptor was discovered when investigators found that few if
any T cells made it out of the thymus in a sphingosine-1phosphate receptor (SIPR) knockout mouse.
Current observations suggest that a cascade of events controls these final stages of maturation: positive selecting TCR
signals up-regulate Foxo1, a transcription factor that controls
expression of several genes related to T-cell function. Foxo1
regulates expression of Klf2, which, in turn, up-regulates
SIPR. Foxo1 also up-regulates both IL-7R, which helps to
maintain mature T-cell survival, and CCR7, the chemokine
receptor that directs mature T-cell traffic to the lymph nodes.
Mature T cells that exit the thymus are referred to as recent
thymic emigrants (RTEs). It is now clear that recent thymic
emigrants are not as functionally mature as most naïve T cells
in the periphery: they do not proliferate or secrete cytokines
as vigorously in response to T-cell receptor stimulation. RTEs
also can be distinguished from the majority of peripheral
naïve T cells because their levels of expression of several surface proteins (e.g., the maturation markers HSA and Qa-2, as
well as the IL-7 receptor) are more similar to their immature
thymocyte ancestors than their fully mature T-cell descendants. Investigators are particularly interested in RTEs because
they are an important source of mature T cells in individuals
who are lymphopenic (i.e., have a reduced pool of functional
lymphocytes), including people who have undergone chemotherapy, newborns, and the aged. Although research is ongoing, studies suggest that the final maturation of these cells is
influenced by their interactions with both MHC and nonMHC ligands in secondary lymphoid organs.

Other Mechanisms That Maintain
Self-Tolerance
As we have seen, negative selection of thymocytes can rid a
developing T-cell repertoire of cells that express a high
affinity for both ubiquitous self-antigens and, thanks to the

and thwart autoimmune reactions. What determines
whether a self-reactive thymocyte dies or differentiates
into a TREG cell is still an open question. Investigators are
currently trying to understand if the choice is made based
on subtle differences in affinity for self or on differences in
their maturation state when they receive a high-affinity
signal. Recent work suggests that TREGs develop in a
unique microenvironmental niche within the thymus, and
that the available space for developing cells in this niche is
limited. These findings suggest that thymocytes that commit to the regulatory T-cell lineage are likely to receive
unique stimulatory signals. These natural TREGs share the
periphery with induced TREGs that can develop from conventional mature T cells that are exposed to TGF- and
IL-10 cytokines (see Chapter 11).
Animal studies show that members of the FoxP3 TREG
population inhibit the development of autoimmune diseases
such as experimentally induced inflammatory bowel disease,
experimental allergic encephalitis, and autoimmune diabetes. Suppression by these regulatory cells is antigen specific
because it depends on activation through the T-cell receptor.
Exactly how TREGs quench responses is still debated, although
they probably do so via a variety of means: directly inhibiting an antigen-presenting cell’s ability to activate T cells,
directly killing T cells, indirectly inhibiting T-cell activity by
secreting inhibitory cytokines IL-10 and TGF-, and/or
depleting the local environment of stimulatory cytokines
such as IL-2 (Figure 9-10).

activity of AIRE, tissue-specific antigens. However, negative
selection in the thymus is not perfect. Autoreactive T cells do
escape, either because they have too low an affinity for self to
induce clonal deletion, or they happen not to have browsed
the “right” tissue-specific antigen/MHC combination. The
body has evolved several other mechanisms to avoid autoimmunity, including what has become a major focus of interest
for immunologists: the development in both the thymus and
the periphery of a fascinating group of cells now known as
regulatory T cells.

TREG Cells Negatively Regulate
Immune Responses
Regulatory T cells (TREG cells) can inhibit the proliferation
of other T-cell populations in vitro, effectively suppressing
autoreactive immune responses. They express on their surface CD4 as well as CD25, the  chain of the IL-2 receptor.
However, TREG cells are more definitively identified by their
expression of a master transcriptional regulator, FoxP3, the
expression of which is necessary and sufficient to induce differentiation to the TREG lineage.
TREG cells can develop in the thymus and appear to
represent an alternative fate for autoreactive T cells. As we
have seen, most thymocytes that express receptors with
high affinity for self-antigen die via negative selection.
However, a small fraction appear to commit to the regulatory T-cell lineage and leave the thymus to patrol the body

T cells and reduce signaling activity. (3) Inhibition of antigenpresenting cells. TREGs can interact directly with MHC Class II
expressing antigen-presenting cells and inhibit their maturation,
leaving them less able to activate T cells. (4) Cytotoxicity. TREGs can
also display cytotoxic function and kill cells by secreting perforin
and granzyme.

Adaptive Immunity: Development

The existence of regulatory T cells that specifically suppress immune responses has clinical implications. Depletion
or inhibition of TREG cells before immunization may enhance
immune responses to conventional vaccines. Elimination of
T cells that suppress responses to tumor antigens may also
facilitate the development of antitumor immunity. Conversely, increasing the suppressive activity of regulatory T-cell
populations could be useful in the treatment of allergic or
autoimmune diseases. The ability to increase the activity of
regulatory T-cell populations might also be useful in suppressing organ and tissue rejection. Investigators doing future
work on this regulatory cell population will seek deeper
insights into the mechanisms by which members of FoxP3
T-cell populations regulate immune responses. They will also
make determined efforts to discover ways the activities of
these populations can be increased to diminish unwanted
immune responses and decreased to promote desirable ones.

Peripheral Mechanisms of Tolerance also
Protect Against Autoreactive Thymocytes
The body has evolved several other mechanisms to manage the
autoreactive escapee in the periphery. Briefly, many antigens
are “hidden” from autoreactive T cells because only a subset of
cells (professional APCs) express the right costimulatory molecules needed to initiate the immune response. Autoreactive
naïve T cells that can see an MHC/self-peptide combination on
a nonprofessional antigen-presenting cell will not receive the
correct costimulatory signals and will not divide or differentiate. For example, if a thymocyte specific for a peptide made by
a kidney cell escaped from the thymus, it will not be activated
unless that peptide were presented on a professional antigenpresenting cell. Kidney cells do not express the costimulatory
ligands required for activating a CD4 or a CD8 T cell. In
fact, a high-affinity interaction with MHC/peptide combinations on the surface of kidney cell, in the absence of costimulatory ligands, could result in T-cell anergy—another peripheral
tolerance mechanism that is described in more detail in Chapter 11. The clinical consequences of failures of central and
peripheral tolerance will be discussed in Chapter 16.

Apoptosis
As we have seen here, and will also see in Chapter 10, apoptosis features prominently during T- and B-lymphocyte
development. T-cell development is a particularly expensive
process for the host. An estimated 95% to 98% of all thymocytes do not mature—most die by apoptosis within the thymus either because they fail to make a productive TCR gene
rearrangement or because they fail to interact with selfMHC. Some (2%–5%) die, also via apoptosis, because they
are negatively selected.
Not only does apoptosis shape the developing lymphocyte repertoire; it also regulates immune cell homeostasis by
returning myeloid, T-, and B-cell populations to their appro-

priate levels after bursts of infection-inspired proliferation,
and it is the means by which a cell dies after being targeted
by cytotoxic T cells or NK cells. Understanding its fundamental biological features is an important part of an overall
understanding of immune cell function. Because apoptosis
is such a critical part of lymphocyte development, we will
take the opportunity in this chapter to briefly describe the
apoptotic process and how it is regulated.

Apoptosis Allows Cells to Die without
Triggering an Inflammatory Response
Apoptosis, or programmed cell death, is an energy-dependent
process by which a cell brings about its own demise. It is most
often contrasted with necrosis, a form of cell death arising from
injury or toxicity (Figure 9-11a). In necrosis, injured cells swell
and burst, releasing their contents and possibly triggering a
damaging inflammatory response. Apoptotic cells, in contrast,
dismantle their contents without disrupting their membranes
and induce neighboring cells to engulf them before they can
release any inflammatory material. Morphologic changes associated with apoptosis include a pronounced decrease in cell
volume; modification of the cytoskeleton, which results in
membrane blebbing; a condensation of the chromatin; and
degradation of the DNA into fragments (Figure 9-11b).

Different Stimuli Initiate Apoptosis,
but All Activate Caspases
Although a lymphocyte can be signaled to die in several
ways, all apoptotic signals ultimately activate a class of proteases called caspases. Caspase activation is common to
almost all death pathways known in both vertebrates and
invertebrates, demonstrating that apoptosis is an ancient
process. Many of its molecular participants have been conserved through evolution (Table 9-2).
The role of caspases was first revealed by studies of developmentally programmed cell death in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans, where the death of cells was shown to be
totally dependent on the activity of a gene that encoded a
cysteine protease with specificity for aspartic acid residues.
We now know that mammals have at least 14 cysteine-aspartic
proteases, or caspases, and all apoptotic cell deaths require
the activity of at least a subset of these molecules.
How do caspases trigger cell death? Apoptotic pathways
typically involve two classes of caspases, both of which are
maintained in an inactive state until apoptosis is initiated.
Initiator caspases are activated by a death stimulus and, in
turn, activate effector caspases, which execute the death
program by (1) cleaving critical targets necessary for cell
survival (e.g., cytoskeletal proteins) as well as (2) activating
other enzymes that carry out the dismantling of the cell.
Ultimately, the catalytic cascade initiated by caspases induces
death via an orderly disassembly of intracellular molecules.
It also results in the packaging of cell contents into vesicles
that are ultimately engulfed.

Stimuli that lead to apoptosis can be divided into two
categories based on how they activate the effector caspases.
Signals such as radiation, stress, and growth factor withdrawal induce caspase activation and apoptosis via the
intrinsic pathway that is mediated by mitochondrial molecules, while membrane-bound or soluble ligands that bind
to membrane receptors stimulate caspase activation and
apoptosis via the extrinsic pathway.

Apoptosis of Peripheral T Cells Is Mediated
by the Extrinsic (Fas) Pathway
Outside of the thymus, most of the TCR-mediated apoptosis
of mature T cells is induced via the extrinsic pathway
through membrane-associated death receptors, including Fas
(CD95). Repeated or persistent stimulation of peripheral T
cells via their T-cell receptors results in the co-expression of
both Fas and Fas ligand (FasL) on T cells, ultimately leading
to Fas/FasL-mediated death. Apoptosis induced by antigen
receptor activation is called activation-induced cell death
(AICD) and is a major homeostatic mechanism, helping to
reduce the pool of activated T cells after antigen is cleared
and helping to remove stray autoreactive T cells that are
stimulated by self-antigens.

The signaling cascade initiated by Fas (and by all death
receptors) leads directly to the activation of the initiator caspase,
caspase-8. When FasL binds Fas, procaspase-8, an inactive form
of caspase-8, is recruited to the intracellular tail of Fas by an
adaptor molecule called FADD (Fas-associated protein with
death domain) (Figure 9-12a). The aggregation of procaspase-8
results in its cleavage and conversion to active caspase-8, which
will then activate effector caspase-3, which in turn initiates the
proteolytic cascade that leads to the death of the cell.
The importance of Fas and FasL in the removal of mature
activated T cells is underscored by abnormalities in lpr/lpr mice,
a naturally occurring loss of function mutation in Fas. When T
cells become activated in these mice, the Fas/FasL pathway is
not operative, and stimulated T cells continue to proliferate.
These mice spontaneously develop strikingly large lymph nodes
that are filled with excessive numbers of lymphocytes. Ultimately, they develop autoimmune disease, clearly demonstrating the consequences of a failure to delete activated T cells. An
additional spontaneous mutant, gld/gld, has the complementary
loss of function. These mice lack functional FasL and display
abnormalities very similar to those found in the lpr/lpr mice.
Recently, humans with defects in Fas have been reported. As
expected, these individuals display characteristics of autoimmune disease (see Clinical Focus Box 9-3).

FIGURE 9-12 Two pathways to apoptosis in T cells.
(a) Activated peripheral T cells are induced to express high levels of
Fas and FasL and stimulate the extrinsic apoptotic pathway. FasL
induces the trimerization of Fas on a neighboring cell. FasL can also
engage Fas on the same cell, resulting in a self-induced death signal. Trimerization of Fas leads to the recruitment of FADD, which
leads in turn to the cleavage of associated molecules of procaspase-8
to form active caspase-8. Caspase-8 cleaves procaspase-3, producing active caspase-3, which results in the death of the cell.
Caspase-8 can also cleave the Bcl-2 family member Bid to a truncated form that can activate the mitochondrial death pathway.
(b) Other signals, such as the engagement of the TCR by peptideMHC complexes on an APC during T-cell development, result in the
activation of the intrinsic, mitochondrial death pathway. A key feature of this pathway is the release of cytochrome c from the inner
mitochondrial membrane into the cytosol, an event that is regulated by Bcl-2 family members. Cytochrome c interacts with Apaf-1
and subsequently with procaspase-9 to form the active apoptosome. The apoptosome initiates the cleavage of procaspase-3,
producing active caspase-3, which initiates the execution phase of
apoptosis by proteolysis of substances whose cleavage commits
the cell to apoptosis. [Adapted in part from S. H. Kaufmann and M. O.
Hengartner, 2001, Trends in Cell Biology 11:526.]

CHAPTER 9

321

Fas and FasL are members of a family of related receptor/
ligands including tumor necrosis factor (TNF) and its
ligand, TNFR (tumor necrosis factor receptor), which can
also induce apoptosis via the activation of caspase-8 followed by the activation of effector caspases such as caspase-3
(see Figure 4-14).

Fas/FasL interactions do not appear to play a central role in
negative selection in the thymus. Instead, TCR-mediated
negative-selecting signals in the thymus induce a route to
apoptosis in which mitochondria play a central role (Figure 9-12b). In mitochondria-dependent (intrinsic) apoptotic
pathways, cytochrome c, which normally resides between
the inner and outer mitochondrial membranes, leaks into
the cytosol. The release of cytochrome c is regulated by
several different protein families. In thymocytes, Bim, a
Bcl-2 family member, and Nur77, an orphan nuclear receptor, both play a role.
In the cytosol, cytochrome c binds to a protein known as
Apaf-1 (apoptotic protease-activating factor 1), which then
oligomerizes. Binding of oligomeric Apaf-1 to procaspase-9
results in its transformation to active caspase-9, an initiator
caspase. The cytochrome c/Apaf-1/caspase-9 complex, called
the apoptosome, proteolytically cleaves procaspase-3, generating active caspase-3, which initiates the cascade of reactions that kills the cell.
Interestingly, although over 95% of thymocytes die during development, apoptotic thymocytes are very difficult to
find in a normal thymus. Investigators showed that if you
inhibit the activity of thymic macrophages, apoptotic thymocytes are abundantly evident. This experiment dramatically underscored both the importance and the efficiency of
phagocytes in clearing dying cells from the thymus.
Cell death induced by Fas/FasL is swift, with rapid activation of the caspase cascade leading to cell death in 2 to 4
hours. On the other hand, TCR-induced negative selection
appears to involve a more circuitous pathway, requiring the
activation of several processes, including mitochondrial
membrane failure, the release of cytochrome c, and the formation of the apoptosome before caspases become involved.
Consequently, TCR-mediated negative selection can take as
long as 8 to 10 hours.

Bcl-2 Family Members Can Inhibit
or Induce Apoptosis
The Bcl-2 (B-cell lymphoma 2) family of genes, which regulate
cytochrome c release, plays a prominent role in immune cell
physiology. They include both anti-apoptotic and proapoptotic proteins that can insert into the mitochondrial
membrane. Although their precise mechanism of action is still

is extremely important to an effective
immune system. One of the most important elements in this regulation is apoptosis mediated by the Fas/FasL system. The
following excerpts from medical histories
show what can happen when this key
regulatory mechanism fails.
Patient A: A woman, now 43, has had
a long history of immunologic imbalances and other medical problems. By
age 2, she was diagnosed with CanaleSmith syndrome (CSS), a severe enlargement of such lymphoid tissues as lymph
nodes (lymphadenopathy) and spleen
(splenomegaly). Biopsy of lymph nodes
showed that, in common with many
other CSS patients, she had greatly
increased numbers of lymphocytes. She
had reduced numbers of platelets
(thrombocytopenia) and, because her red
blood cells were being lysed, she was
anemic (hemolytic anemia). The reduction in numbers of platelets and the lysis
of red blood cells could be traced to the
action of circulating antibodies that
reacted with these host components. At
age 21, she was diagnosed with grossly
enlarged pelvic lymph nodes that had to
be removed. Ten years later, she was
again found to have an enlarged abdominal mass, which on surgical removal
turned out to be a half-pound lymph
node aggregate. She has continued to
have mild lymphadenopathy and, typical
of these patients, the lymphocyte populations of enlarged nodes had elevated
numbers of T cells (87% as opposed to a

and fluorescent antibody staining
revealed an excess of double-negative T
cells (Figure 1). Also, like many patients
with CSS, she has had cancer: breast cancer at age 22 and skin cancer at ages 22
and 41.
Patient B: A man who was eventually
diagnosed with CSS had severe lymphadenopathy and splenomegaly as an
infant and child. He was treated from age
4 to age 12 with corticosteroids and the
immunosuppressive drug mercaptopurine. These appeared to help, and the
swelling of lymphoid tissues became
milder during adolescence and adulthood. At age 42, he died of liver cancer.

controversial, the balance of pro-apoptotic and anti-apoptotic
family members influences a cell’s response to stress. The
Bcl-2 family also includes an important, third group of proteins, the BH3 family, all of which do not insert in the mitochondrial membrane, but instead inhibit the anti-apoptotic
Bcl-2 family members, and so are ultimately pro-apoptotic.
Intrinsic apoptotic stimuli act, in part, by activating BH3
family members, which are often sequestered from the mito-

Patient C: An 8-year-old boy, the son
of patient B, was also afflicted with CSS
and showed elevated T-cell counts and
severe lymphadenopathy at the age of 7
months. At age 2 his spleen became so
enlarged that it had to be removed. He
also developed hemolytic anemia and
thrombocytopenia. However, although he
continued to have elevated T-cell counts,
the severity of his hemolytic anemia and
thrombocytopenia have so far been controlled by treatment with methotrexate, a
DNA-synthesis-inhibiting drug used for
immunosuppression and cancer chemotherapy.
Recognition of the serious consequences of a failure to regulate the number of lymphocytes, as exemplified by

chondria in a healthy cell. For example, TCR-mediated
negative selection activates Bim, a BH3 family protein that
facilitates cytochrome c release (see Figure 9-12b). However,
even the extrinsic pathway can activate BH3 family members. For instance, caspase-8 generated by the Fas pathway
cleaves the BH3 family member Bid, releasing it from
sequestration and allowing it to activate the mitochondrial
death pathway.

these case histories, emerged from
detailed study of several children whose
enlarged lymphoid tissues attracted medical attention. In each of these cases of
CSS, examination revealed grossly
enlarged lymph nodes that were 1 cm to
2 cm in girth and sometimes large enough
to distort the local anatomy. In four of a
group of five children who were studied
intensively, the spleens were so massive
that they had to be removed.
Even though the clinical picture in
CSS can vary from person to person, with
some individuals suffering severe chronic
affliction and others only sporadic episodes of illness, there is a common feature: a failure of activated lymphocytes to
undergo Fas-mediated apoptosis. Isolation and sequencing of Fas genes from a
number of patients and more than a
hundred controls reveals that CSS patients
are heterozygous (fas/) at the fas locus
and thus carry one copy of a defective
fas gene. A comparison of Fas-mediated
cell death in T cells from normal controls
who do not carry mutant Fas genes with
death induced in T cells from CSS patients
shows a marked defect in Fas-induced
death (Figure 2). Characterization of the
Fas genes so far seen in CSS patients
reveals that they have mutations in or
around the region encoding the deathinducing domain (the “death domain”)
of this protein. Such mutations result in
the production of Fas protein that lacks
biological activity but still competes
with normal Fas molecules for interactions with essential components of the
Fas-mediated death pathway. Other
mutations have been found in the extracellular domain of Fas, often associated
with milder forms of CSS or no disease
at all.

anti-Fas antibody, which artificially cross-links Fas molecules. This experiment shows the percentage of
dead T cells after induction of apoptosis in T cells from patients and controls by cross-linking Fas with
increasing amounts of an anti-Fas monoclonal antibody. T cells from the Canale-Smith patients (A and
B) are resistant to Fas-mediated death. [Adapted from M. D. Drappa et al., 1996, New England Journal of Medicine

A number of research groups have
conducted detailed clinical studies of CSS
patients, and the following general observations have been made:
•

The cell populations of the blood and
lymphoid tissues of CSS patients show
dramatic elevations (5-fold to as much
as 20-fold) in the numbers of lymphocytes of all sorts, including T cells, B
cells, and NK cells.

•

Most of the patients have elevated levels of one or more classes of immunoglobulin (hyper-gammaglobulinemia).

•

Immune hyperactivity is responsible
for such autoimmune phenomena as
the production of autoantibodies
against red blood cells, resulting in
hemolytic anemia, and a depression in
platelet counts due to the activity of
antiplatelet autoantibodies.

The signature member of this gene family, bcl-2, was discovered near the breakpoint of a chromosomal translocation
in a cancer known as human B-cell lymphoma. The translocation moved the bcl-2 gene into the immunoglobulin
heavy-chain locus, resulting in transcription of bcl-2 along
with the immunoglobulin gene, with consequent overproduction of the encoded Bcl-2 protein by the lymphoma cells.
The resulting high levels of Bcl-2 resulted in the accumula-

These observations establish the
importance of the death-mediated regulation of lymphocyte populations in
lymphocyte homeostasis. Such cell
death is necessary because the immune
response to antigen results in a sudden
and dramatic increase in the populations of responding clones of lymphocytes and temporarily distorts the
representation of these clones in the
repertoire. In the absence of cell death,
the periodic stimulation of lymphocytes
that occurs in the normal course of life
would result in progressively increasing,
and ultimately unsustainable, lymphocyte levels. As CSS demonstrates, without the essential culling of lymphocytes
by apoptosis, severe and life-threatening
disease can result.

tion of long-lived B cells and contributed to their transformation into cancerous lymphoma cells.
Bcl-2 levels play an important role in regulating the
normal life span of various hematopoietic cell lineages,
including lymphocytes. A normal adult has about 5 liters of
blood, with about 2000 lymphocytes/mm3, for a total of
about 1011 circulating lymphocytes. During acute infection, the lymphocyte count increases fourfold or more. The

immune system cannot sustain such a massive increase in
cell numbers for an extended period, so the system must
eliminate unneeded activated lymphocytes once the antigenic threat has passed. Activated lymphocytes have been
found to express lower levels of Bcl-2, and therefore are
more susceptible to the induction of apoptotic death than

are naïve lymphocytes or memory cells. However, if the
lymphocytes continue to be activated by antigen, signals
received during activation block the apoptotic signal. As
antigen levels subside, the levels of the signals that block
apoptosis diminish, and the lymphocytes begin to die by
apoptosis.

Uncommitted white blood cell progenitors enter the thymus from the bone marrow. Notch/Notch ligand interactions are required for T-cell commitment.
Immature T cells are called thymocytes, and stages of
development can be defined broadly by the expression of
the coreceptors CD4 and CD8. The most immature thymocytes express neither coreceptor and are referred to as
CD4CD8 or double-negative (DN) cells. These progress
to the CD4CD8 (double positive or DP) stage, which in
turn mature to the CD4CD8 or CD4CD8 (single
positive or SP) stages.
DN thymocytes progress through four stages of development (DN1-DN4) defined by CD44, CD25, and c-Kit
expression. During these stages they proliferate and rearrange the TCR, , and  antigen receptor genes.
Thymocytes that rearrange  and  receptor genes successfully mature to the TCR lineage.
Those thymocytes that successfully rearrange the  receptor chain are detected by a process called -selection.
-selection is initiated by assembly of the TCR protein
with a surrogate, invariant TCR chain and CD3 complex
proteins. Assembly of this pre-TCR results in commitment to the TCR lineage, another burst of proliferation,
maturation to the DP stage of development, and initiation
of TCR rearrangement.
DP thymocytes are the most abundant subpopulation in
the thymus and are the first cells to express a mature
TCR receptor. They are the targets of positive and
negative selection, which are responsible for self-tolerance
and self-MHC restriction, respectively.
Positive and negative selection are regulated by the affinity
of a DP thymocyte’s TCR for MHC/self-peptide complexes expressed by the thymic epithelium.
High-affinity TCR/MHC/peptide interactions result in
negative selection, typically by initiating apoptosis (clonal
deletion).
Low/intermediate-affinity signals result in positive selection and initiate a maturation program to the helper CD4
or cytotoxic CD8 single-positive lineages.
The large majority of thymocytes (95%) do not interact
with any MHC/self-peptides expressed by the thymic epithelium and die by neglect.

The distinction among TCR signaling cascades that activate positive versus negative selection is not fully understood but may involve differences in MAPK and Ca2
signaling.
Positively selected DP thymocytes have to decide whether
to become helper CD4 or cytotoxic CD8 T cells. This
process, called lineage commitment, appears to depend on
continuity of the signals positively selected DP thymocytes receive through their TCR.
Thymocytes whose TCR preferentially interacts with
MHC Class II generate a continuous signal that initiates a
CD4 helper T-cell developmental program.
Thymocytes whose TCR preferentially interacts with
MHC Class I cannot generate a continuous signal because
CD8 surface levels are down-regulated in response to
positive selection. The interruption in signaling, followed
by further stimulation, initiates a CD8 developmental
program.
Transcription factors Th-Pok and Runx3 play important roles
in CD4 helper cell and CD8 cytotoxic cell commitment.
They work in part by reciprocally regulating each other.
Positively selected thymocytes migrate from the thymic
cortex to the thymic medulla via interactions with the
CCR7 chemokine receptor. These cells, in transition from
the DP to the SP stage of development, are negatively
selected for tissue-specific antigens in the medulla. This is
the second opportunity to remove autoreactive T cells
from the developing repertoire.
The thymic cortex and thymic medulla carry out distinct
functions in the thymus. Medullary epithelial cells, but not
cortical epithelial cells, express the transcription factor
AIRE, which is responsible for their unique capacity to
express tissue-specific antigens.
Fully mature thymocytes exit the thymus via interactions
via the sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor (S1PR) and
undergo final functional maturation in peripheral lymphoid tissues.
A small percentage of cells also develop within the thymus
to other cell lineages, including NK T cells, IELs, and
regulatory T cells.
Regulatory T cells that develop in the thymus are called natural TREGs. They share the periphery with regulatory T cells

that develop from conventional T cells (induced TREGs) and
play an important role in inhibiting autoimmune responses.
■

■

Apoptosis, a process of cell death that is internally initiated and highly regulated, has a major influence on the
shape of the T-cell repertoire. Thymocytes that do not pass
-selection (and do not successfully express a TCR
complex) die by apoptosis; 95% of developing DP thymocytes also die by apoptosis, the vast majority because they
do not receive sufficient TCR signaling (death by neglect)
and a smaller population because they receive too high a
level of TCR signaling (negative selection).
The process by which a cell undergoes apoptosis signaling
is evolutionarily conserved and inspired by many different receptor interactions in most if not all cell types in the
body.

■

Apoptotic stimuli either activate death receptors (extrinsic
pathway) or mitochondrial cytochrome c release (intrinsic
pathway). Both pathways ultimately activate effector caspases, which finalize cell death events.

■

Apoptotic cells are rapidly engulfed by neighboring
phagocytes and, for this reason, are difficult to detect in
living tissues.
Bcl-2 family members include both anti-apoptotic and
pro-apoptotic family members that reside in the mitochondrial membrane and regulate cytochrome c release.
A third set of family members, the pro-apoptotic BH3
proteins, can be activated by apoptotic stimuli, favoring a shift in balance of Bcl-2 family member activity
at the mitochondrial membrane toward cytochrome c
release.

Q U E S T I O N S

2. Susceptibility to many autoimmune diseases has been linked

to MHC gene variants. One of the best examples of such a
linkage is provided by multiple sclerosis (MS), a human autoimmune disease caused by autoreactive T cells whose activity
ultimately damages the myelin sheaths around neurons. Susceptibility to MS has been consistently associated with variants in the HLA-DR2 gene. Although this link was first
recognized in 1972, we still don’t fully understand the basis
for this susceptibility. One perspective on the reasons for the
link between MHC variations and autoimmune disease was
offered in a recent review article. The authors state, “The
mechanisms underlying MHC association in autoimmune
disease are not clearly understood. One long-held view suggests a breakdown in immunological tolerance to self-antigens through aberrant class II presentation of self or foreign
peptides to autoreactive T lymphocytes. Thus, it seems likely
that specific MHC class II alleles determine the targeting of
particular autoantigens resulting in disease-specific associations.” (Fernando, M. M. A., et al. 2008 Defining the role of
the MHC in autoimmunity: A review and pooled analysis.
PLoS Genet 4:4: e1000024. doi:10.1371/journal.pgen.1000024.)
a. Paraphrase this perspective using your own words.
What, specifically, might the authors mean by “aberrant
class II presentation . . . to autoreactive T lymphocytes”?
b. (Advanced question.) Although this speculation has some
merit, it does not resolve all questions. Why? Pose one
question that this explanation inspires or does not answer.
c. (Very advanced question.) Offer one addition to the
explanation (or an alternative) that helps resolve the
question you posed above.
3. Over a period of several years, a group of children and ado-

lescents are regularly dosed with compound X, a lifesaving
drug. However, in addition to its beneficial effects, it was
found that this drug interferes with Fas-mediated signaling.
a. What clinical manifestations of this side effect of compound X might be seen in these patients?
b. If white blood cells from an affected patient are stained
with a fluorescein-labeled anti-CD4 and a phycoerythrin-labeled anti-CD8 antibody, what might be seen in
the flow-cytometric analysis of these cells? What pattern would be expected if the same procedure were
performed on white blood cells from a healthy control?

1. Each of the following statements is false. Correct them

(and explain your correction[s]).
Knockout mice lacking class I MHC molecules fail to produce CD4 mature thymocytes.

2. Whereas the majority of T cells in our bodies express an

7. In his classic chimeric mouse experiments, Zinkernagel

took bone marrow from a mouse of one MHC haplotype
(mouse 1) and a thymus from a mouse of another MHC
haplotype (mouse 2) and transplanted them into a third
mouse, which was thymectomized and lethally irradiated.
He then immunized this reconstituted mouse with the
lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) and examined the activity of the mature T cells isolated from the
spleen and lymph nodes of the mouse.
He was specifically interested to see if the mature CD8 T
cells in these mice could kill target cells infected with LCMV
with the MHC haplotype of mouse 1, 2, or 3. The results of
two such experiments using H-2b strain C57BL/6 mice and

10. You wish to determine the percentage of various types of

thymocytes in a sample of cells from mouse thymus using
the indirect immunofluorescence method.
a. You first stain the sample with goat anti-CD3 (primary
antibody) and then with rabbit FITC-labeled antigoat Ig
(secondary antibody), which emits a green color. Analysis
of the stained sample by flow cytometry indicates that 70%
of the cells are stained. Based on this result, how many of
the thymus cells in your sample are expressing antigenbinding receptors on their surface? Would all be expressing the same type of receptor? Explain your answer. What
are the remaining unstained cells likely to be?

b. You then separate the CD3 cells with the fluorescenceactivated cell sorter (FACS) and restain them. In this
case, the primary antibody is hamster anti-CD4, and the
secondary antibody is rabbit PE-labeled antihamster Ig,

cells shows that 80% of them are stained. From this
result, can you determine how many TC cells are present
in this sample? If yes, then how many TC cells are there?
If no, what additional experiment would you perform to
determine the number of TC cells that are present?

B-Cell Development

M

illions of B lymphocytes are generated in the
bone marrow every day and exported to the
periphery. The rapid and unceasing
generation of new B cells occurs in a carefully
regulated sequence of events. Cell transfer experiments, in
which genetically marked donor hematopoietic stem cells
(HSCs) are injected into an unmarked recipient, have
indicated that B-cell development from HSC to mature B
cell takes from 1 to 2 weeks; donor-derived mature B cells
can be detected in the recipient by 2 weeks following
transfer of HSCs into recipient mice.
B-cell development begins in the bone marrow with the
asymmetric division of an HSC and continues through a
series of progressively more differentiated progenitor stages
to the production of common lymphoid progenitors
(CLPs), which can give rise to either B cells or T cells (see
Overview Figure 10-1). Progenitor cells destined to
become T cells migrate to the thymus where they complete
their maturation (see Chapter 9); the majority of those that
remain in the bone marrow become B cells. As
differentiation proceeds, the developing B cell expresses on
its cell surface a precisely calibrated sequence of cell-surface
receptor and adhesion molecules. Some of the signals
received from these receptors induce the differentiation of
the developing B cell; others trigger its proliferation at
particular stages of development and yet others direct its
movements within the bone marrow environment. These
signals collectively allow differentiation of the CLP through
the early B-cell stages to form the immature B cell that
leaves the marrow to complete its differentiation in the
spleen. For the investigator, the expression of different cellsurface molecules at each stage of B-cell maturation
provides an invaluable experimental tool with which to
recognize and isolate B cells poised at discrete points in
their development.
The primary function of mature B cells is to secrete
antibodies that protect the host against pathogens, and
so one major focus of those studying B-cell
differentiation is the analysis of the timing and order of
rearrangement and expression of immunoglobulin receptor
heavy- and light-chain genes. Recall from Chapter 7 that
immunoglobulin gene rearrangements begin with

heavy-chain D to JH gene-segment rearrangement,
followed by the stitching together of the ␮ heavy-chain
VH and DJH segments. These rearrangements culminate
in the cell-surface expression of the pre-B-cell receptor
during the pre-B-cell stage, in which the rearranged
heavy chain is expressed in combination with the
surrogate light chain. Rearrangement of the light chain
is initiated after several rounds of division of cells
bearing the pre-BCR.
Like T cells, developing B cells must solve the
problem of creating a repertoire of receptors capable of
recognizing an extensive array of antigens, while
ensuring that self-reactive B cells are either eliminated
by apoptosis or rendered functionally unreactive or
anergic. However, unlike T-cell receptors, B-cell
receptors are not constrained by the need to be MHC
restricted. Again, unlike T-cell maturation, B-cell
development is almost complete by the time the B cell
leaves the bone marrow; in mammalian systems there is
no thymic equivalent in which B-cell development is
accomplished. Instead, immature B cells are released to

B-cell development begins with a hematopoietic stem cell (HSC)
and passes through progressively more delimited progenitor-cell
stages until it reaches the pro-B cell stage. At this stage, the precursor cell is irreversibly committed to the B-cell lineage and the

the periphery, where they complete their developmental
program in the spleen.
In this chapter, we will follow B-cell development from
its earliest stages in the primary lymphoid organs to the
generation of fully mature B cells in the secondary
lymphoid tissues. As for T cells, multiple B-cell subsets
exist, and we will briefly address how the process of
differentiation of the minority B-1 and marginal-zone
(MZ) B-cell subsets differs from the developmental
program followed by the predominant B-2 B-cell subset.
We will conclude with a brief comparison of the
maturational processes of T and B lymphocytes.

The Site of Hematopoiesis
In adult animals, hematopoiesis, the generation of blood
cells, occurs in the bone marrow; the HSCs in the marrow
are the source of all blood cells of the erythroid, myeloid, and

recombination of the immunoglobulin genes begins. Once the
completed immunoglobulin is expressed on the cell surface, the
immature B cell, now a transitional B cell, leaves the bone marrow
to complete its maturation in the spleen.

lymphoid lineages (Chapter 2). Various non-hematopoietic
cells in the bone marrow express cell-surface molecules
and secrete hormones that guide hematopoietic cell development. Developing lymphocytes move within the bone marrow as they mature, thus interacting with different
populations of cells and signals at various developmental
stages. However, fetal animals face particular challenges to
their developing immune systems; how can they generate
blood cells when their bones are still not yet fully developed?

The Site of B-Cell Generation Changes
during Gestation
Hematopoiesis is a complex process in the adult animal, and
during fetal maturation additional challenges must be met.
Red blood cells must be quickly generated de novo in order to
provide the embryo with sufficient oxygen, and HSCs must
proliferate at a rate sufficient to populate the adult as well as
provide for the hematopoietic needs of the maturing fetus.
Furthermore, since the bone marrow appears relatively late in

stages in hematopoiesis. (a) Blood-cell precursors are initially
found in the yolk sac (yellow), then spread to the placenta fetal liver
(pink), and aorta-gonad-mesonephros (AGM) region (green), before
finding their adult home in the bone marrow. The mouse embryo is

5 weeks of gestation. (b) In the embryo, cells within the primitive
streak mesodermal tissue adopt either hematopoietic (blood-cell
forming) or vascular (blood-vessel forming) fates. Those destined to

development, the whole process of blood-cell generation must
shift location several times before moving into its final home.
The gestation period for mice is 19 to 21 days. Hematopoiesis begins, in the mouse, around 7 days post fertilization
(Figure 10-2) when precursor cells in the yolk sac begin differentiating to form primitive, nucleated, erythroid cells that
carry the oxygen the embryo needs for early development.
Fetal HSCs capable of generating all blood-cell types can be
detected in the early aorta-gonad-mesonephros (AGM) region
on day 8, when the fetal heart starts beating. On day 10, mature
HSCs capable of completely repopulating the hematopoietic
system of irradiated adult mice can be isolated from the AGM,
and by day 11 they can be found in the yolk sac, placenta, and

fetal liver. Between days 11.5 and 12.5, there is rapid expansion
of the placental HSC pool, at the end of which time the placenta holds more HSCs than either the AGM or the yolk sac.
By day 13.5, the number of HSCs in the placenta begins to
decrease while the HSC pool in the liver continues to expand.
As the mouse embryo completes its development, the
predominant site of HSC generation remains within the fetal
liver, but some hematopoiesis can be detected in the spleen
in the perinatal (around the time of birth) period. The number of fetal liver HSCs in mice reaches a maximum of
approximately 1000 by days 15.5 to 16.5 of embryonic
development, after which it starts to decline. Within the
fetal liver, HSCs differentiate to form progenitor cells. At the

Adaptive Immunity: Development

earliest time points, hematopoiesis in the fetal liver is
dominated by erythroid progenitors that give rise to the
true, enucleated mature erythrocytes, in order to ensure a
steady oxygen supply to the growing embryo, and myeloid
and lymphoid progenitors gradually emerge. Pre-B cells
(precursor-B cells), defined as cells that express immunoglobulin in their cytoplasm but not on their surfaces, are
first observed at day 13 of gestation, and surface IgM-positive
B cells are present in detectable numbers by day 17. HSCs
first seed the bone marrow at approximately day 15, and
over a period of a few weeks, the bone marrow takes over as
the main site of B-cell development, remaining so throughout post-natal life.

Hematopoiesis in the Fetal Liver Differs from
That in the Adult Bone Marrow
Developing B cells in the fetal liver differ in important
ways from their counterparts in adult bone marrow. The
liver is the primary site of B-cell generation in the fetus,
and provides the neonatal animal with the cells it needs to
populate its nascent immune system. In order to accomplish this, hematopoietic stem cells and their progeny
must undergo a phase of rapid proliferation, and fetal liver
HSCs, as well as their daughter cells, undergo several
rounds of cell division over a short time. In contrast, HSCs
derived from the bone marrow of a healthy adult animal
are relatively quiescent.
B cells generated from fetal liver precursors are predominantly B-1 B cells, which will be described more fully in
Chapter 12. Briefly, B-1 B cells are primarily located in the
body (specifically the peritoneal and pleural) cavities. They
are therefore well-positioned to protect the gut and the lungs,
which are the major ports of entry of microbes in the fetus
and neonate. Antibodies secreted by B-1 B cells are broadly
cross-reactive; many bind to carbohydrate antigens expressed
by a number of microbial species. Since terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT) is minimally expressed at this point
in ontogeny, and the RAG1/2 recombinase proteins appear
not to use the full range of V, D, and J region gene segments
at this stage in embryonic development, the immunoglobulin
receptors of B-1 B cells express minimal receptor diversity. In
expressing an oligoclonal (few, as opposed to many, clones)
repertoire of B-cell receptors that bind to a limited number of
carbohydrate antigens shared among many microbes, B-1 B
cells occupy a functional niche that bridges the innate and
adaptive immune systems. We will describe B-1 B-cell development further at the end of this chapter.
Over a period of 2 to 4 weeks after birth, the process of
hematopoiesis in mice shifts from the fetal liver and spleen to
the bone marrow, where it continues throughout adulthood.
The B-1 B-cell population represents an exception to this general rule, as it is self-renewing in the periphery. This means
that new daughter B-1 B cells are generated continually from
preexisting B-1 B cells in the peritoneal and pleural cavities,
and in those other parts of the body in which B-1 B cells

reside. These daughter cells use the same receptors as their
parents, and no new V(D)J recombinase activity is required.
In humans, the sequence of events is similar to that
described for the mouse, but the time frame is obviously
somewhat elongated. Blood-cell precursors first appear in the
yolk sac in the third week of embryonic development, but
these cells, like their analogues in the mouse provide primarily erythroid progenitors and are not capable of generating all
subsets of blood cells. The first cells capable of entirely repopulating an adult human hematopoietic system arise in the
AGM region of the embryo and/or the yolk sac. By the third
month of pregnancy, these HSCs migrate to the fetal liver,
which then becomes responsible for the majority of hematopoiesis in the fetus. By the fourth month of pregnancy, HSCs
migrate to the bone marrow, which gradually assumes the
hematopoietic role from the fetal liver until, by the time of
birth, it is the primary generative organ for blood cells. Prior
to puberty in humans, most of the bones of the skeleton are
hematopoietically active, but by the age of 18 years only the
vertebrae, ribs, sternum, skull, pelvis, and parts of the
humerus and femur retain hematopoietic potential.
Just as B-cell development in the fetus and neonate differs
from that in the adult, so does B-cell hematopoiesis in the
aging animal. Clinical Focus Box 10-1 describes some
aspects of B-cell development that alter as humans age.

B-Cell Development in the
Bone Marrow
In Chapter 2 (Figure 2-5), we presented the structure of bone
and bone marrow. The bone marrow microenvironment is a
complex, three-dimensional structure with distinctive cellular niches which are specialized to influence the development of the cell populations that mature there. A dense
network of fenestrated (leaky) thin-walled blood vessels—
the bone marrow sinusoids—permeates the marrow, allowing the passage of newly formed blood cells to the periphery
and facilitating blood circulation through the marrow.
In addition to serving as a source of hematopoietic stem
cells, bone marrow also contains stem cells that can differentiate into adipocytes (fat cells), chondrocytes (cartilage
cells), osteocytes (bone cells), myocytes (muscle cells), and
potentially other types of cells as well. Each of these different
classes of stem cells requires specific sets of factors, secreted
by particular bone marrow stromal cells to enable their
proper differentiation.
What are bone marrow stromal cells? The term stroma
derives from the Greek for mattress, and a stromal cell is a
general term that describes a large adherent cell that supports the growth of other cells. During B-cell development,
bone marrow stromal cells fulfill two functions. First, by
interacting with adhesion molecules on the surfaces of HSCs
and progenitor cells, stromal cells retain the developing cell
populations in the specific bone marrow niches where they
can receive the appropriate molecular signals required for

CLINICAL FOCUS

B-Cell Development in the Aging Individual
People of retirement age and older
represent a greater segment of the population than they used to, and these older
individuals expect to remain active and
productive members of society. However,
physicians and immunologists have long
known that the elderly are more susceptible to infection than are young men and
women, and that vaccinations are less
effective in older individuals. In this feature, we explore the differences in B-cell
development between younger and
older vertebrates, which may account for
some of these immunological disparities
between adult and older individuals.
Aging individuals display deficiencies
in many aspects of B-cell function, including a poor antibody response to vaccination, inefficient generation of memory B
cells, and an increase in the expression of
autoimmune disorders. Does this reflect
defective functioning only in the mature
antigen-responsive B-cell population, or
does it result from problems manifested
during earlier stages in B-cell development? Current research demonstrates
that aging individuals display a range of
shortcomings in developing B cells.
Experiments employing reciprocal
bone marrow chimeras—in which aging
HSCs were transplanted into young recipients or HSCs from young mice were
injected into aging recipients—have
shown that the suboptimal process of
B-cell development in aging individuals
results from deficiencies in both the aging
stem cells and in the supporting stromal
cells. For example, bone marrow stromal
cells from aging mice secrete lower levels
of IL-7 than do stromal cells from younger
animals, suggesting an environmental
defect in the aging bone marrow. However, study of isolated, aging B-cell progenitors reveals that they also respond
less efficiently to IL-7 than do B cells from
younger mice, and so the IL-7 response in
aging individuals is affected at both the
secretory and recipient-cell levels.
Indeed, the problems encountered
by developing B cells from aging indi-

viduals start at the very beginning of
their developmental program. The epigenetic regulation of HSC genes in aging
mice is compromised, resulting in diminished levels of HSC self-renewal. Furthermore, the balance between the
production of myeloid versus lymphoid
progenitors is shifted in older individuals,
with down-regulation of genes associated with lymphoid specification and a
correspondingly enhanced expression of
genes specifying myeloid development.
The net effect of these changes in the
HSC population is a reduction with age
in the numbers of early B-cell progenitors, which is reflected in a decrease in
the numbers of pro- and pre-B-cell precursors at all stages of development.
Detailed studies of the expression of
particular genes important in B-cell development demonstrate that the expression
of important transcription factors, such as
those encoded by the E2A gene, is
reduced in older animals. Furthermore,
the Rag genes, as well as the gene encoding the surrogate light-chain component,
␭5, are down-regulated in older animals
compared with young adults, resulting in
a reduction in the bone marrow output of
immature B cells.
Multiple mechanisms therefore help
to explain why the numbers of B cells
released from the bone marrow are
smaller in aging than in younger individuals. But is the antigen recognition capacity—
the quality—as well as the quantity of B
cells different between the two populations? In particular, do B cells from aging
mice express a repertoire of receptors
similar to those obtained from younger
animals? The answer to this question has
come from the development of techniques that enable a global assessment of
repertoire diversity. Study of the sizes and
sequences of CDR3 regions from large
numbers of human B cells suggests that
in aging individuals the size of the repertoire (the number of different B-cell
receptors an individual expresses) is drastically diminished, and that this decrease

in repertoire diversity correlates with a
reduction in the health of the aging
patient.
The mechanisms for this age-related
repertoire truncation appear to be complex. A decrease in output of immature B2
cells from the bone marrow could provide
the opportunity for B-1 B cells to increase
their share of the peripheral B-cell niche,
and as is well appreciated, B-1 B cells have
a less diverse receptor repertoire than do
B-2 B cells. A lifetime of generating memory cells may also result in an individual
having less room in B-cell follicles for
newly formed B cells to enter, and a
decreased concentration of the homeostatic regulatory cytokines may make it
more difficult for primary B cells to compete with their more robust memory
counterparts. Clearly, this is an area of
increasing clinical interest as the average
age of the population of the developed
world continues to increase.

that HSCs are capable of recirculation in the adult animal. Progenitor

stromal cells express different cytokines. At various points in
their development, progenitor and precursor B cells must
interact with stromal cells secreting particular cytokines,
and thus the developing B cells move in an orderly progression from location to location within the bone marrow. This
progression is guided by chemokines secreted by particular
stromal cell populations. For example, HSCs begin their life
in close contact with osteoblasts located close to the lining of
the endosteal (bone marrow) cavity. Once differentiated to
the pre-pro-B-cell stage, the developing B cells require signals from the chemokine CXCL12, which is secreted by a
specialized set of stromal cells, in order to progress to the
pro-B-cell stage. Pro-B cells then require signaling from the
cytokine IL-7, which is secreted by yet another stromal cell
subset (Figure 10-3). Many of these stromal cell factors serve
to induce the expression of specialized transcription factors
important in B-cell development.

characteristics of each cell type in that pathway, as well as
the molecular signals and transcription factors that drive
differentiation at each stage. Cells at particular stages of
differentiation can be characterized by their surface molecules, which include cell-surface antigens, adhesion molecules, and receptors for chemokines and cytokines. They
are also defined by the array of active transcription factors
that determine which genes are expressed at each step in
the developmental process. Finally, in the case of B cells,
the developmental stages are defined by the status of the
rearranging heavy- and light-chain immunoglobulin
genes. B-cell development is not yet completely understood; however, most of the important cellular intermediates have been defined, and developmental immunologists
are gradually filling in the gaps in our knowledge.
Investigators delineating the path of B-lymphocyte differentiation employed three general experimental strategies.
First, they generated antibodies against molecules (antigens or
markers) present on the surface of bone marrow cells. They
then determined which of these molecules were present at
the same time as other antigens, and which combinations of
antigens appeared to define unique cell types (Figure 10-4a).
In addition, culturing cells in vitro that bear known cellsurface antigens, followed by flow cytometric analysis of the
daughter cells generated in culture, enabled them to describe
the sequential expression of particular combinations of cellsurface molecules (Figure 10-4b).

characterization of B-cell progenitors. In this figure, the different icons do not represent specific antigens, but are used in order to
illustrate the principle of the experiment. Investigators delineated the
stage of B-cell development by using flow cytometry to characterize

the cell-surface expression of developmental markers and molecular
biology to correlate the expression of specific markers with the stage
of immunoglobulin gene rearrangement. The requirement for transcription factor activity at each step was determined using both
knockout and knockin genetic approaches. (See text for details.)

Second, by sorting cells bearing particular combinations
of cell-surface markers, and analyzing those cell populations
for the occurrence of immunoglobulin gene rearrangements,
scientists were able to confirm the staging of the appearance of particular developmental antigens. For example, an
antigen that appears on a cell in which no variable region
gene rearrangement has taken place is clearly expressed
very early in B-cell differentiation. Similarly, an antigen
present on the surface of a cell that has rearranged heavychain, but not light-chain, genes defines a stage in B-cell
differentiation later than that defined by the marker
described above, whereas an antigen present on a cell that
has undergone both heavy-chain and light-chain rear-

rangement characterizes a very late stage in B-cell development. In this way, cell-surface markers were defined that
could serve as indicators of particular steps in B-cell differentiation (Figure 10-4c).
Third, investigators use the power of knockout genetics
to determine the effects on B-cell development of eliminating the expression of particular genes, such as those encoding particular transcription factors (Figure 10-4d). For
example, knocking out a gene encoding a particular transcription factor eliminates an animal’s ability to complete VH
to DJH recombination while still allowing D to JH rearrangement. This tells us that the particular transcription factor in
question is not necessary for stages of B-cell differentiation

ADVANCES

The Role of miRNAs in the Control of B-Cell Development
Geneticists have long known that
only a small fraction of chromosomal DNA
specifies protein sequences, and early
papers relegated the nonprotein-coding
DNA segments to the somewhat ignominiously described status of “junk DNA.”
In 1993, however, scientists studying the
genome of the nematode C. elegans
described groundbreaking investigations
of some of the nonprotein-coding
sequences that they had identified as having been transcribed but not translated.
They showed that these primary transcripts were processed into small pieces
of RNA, 18 to 30 nucleotides in length,
that were capable of exerting control over
the level of expression of mRNA.
The biosynthesis of these micro-RNAs
follows a similar form in eukaryotes as
diverse as C. elegans and humans (Figure 1).
Fully capped and polyadenylated RNAs
(pri-microRNAs) are synthesized by RNA
polymerase II and are then cleaved into a
hairpin-shaped 70- to 100-nucleotide premicroRNA by the nuclear RNAase Drosha,
which works in tandem with a second
double-stranded RNA-binding protein,
DGCR8. The cleaved pre-micro-RNA is
then exported to the cytoplasm, where a
second RNAase, Dicer, acting in association with two other proteins, processes it
to an 18- to 30-nucleotide miRNA duplex,
consisting of the mature miRNA and its
anti-sense strand. In a final step, the
mature miRNA, now single stranded, associates with a protein complex called the
RNA-induced silencing complex, or RISC.

The generation of functioning microRNAs (miRNAs). Just like mRNA, miRNA species are
transcribed as long, capped and polyadenylated RNA species (pri-miRNA) by RNA polymerase ll. They
are then cleaved by a nuclear RNase, Drosha, into a hairpin shaped nucleotide precursor molecule,
termed a pre-miRNA. Drosha works in a protein complex with the protein DGCR8 (DiGeorge
syndrome chromosomal region 8). Pre-miRNAs are then exported to the cytoplasm where a second
ribonuclease, Dicer, in association with the proteins PACT and TRBP processes the pre-miRNA into a
19 to 24 nucleotide miRNA duplex, by removing the terminal loop. Next, a protein complex called RISC
(RNA-Induced Silencing Complex) binds to one of the two strands of the duplex. The strand of miRNA
that binds to RISC is the mature miRNA, and it drives the RISC enzyme to the target mRNA, resulting in
mRNA silencing and/or destruction. [Adapted from Vasilatou et al., 2009. The role of microRNAs in normal and
malignant hematopoiesis. European Journal of Hematology, 84, 1 to 16. Figure 1.]

The mature miRNA operates by complementary binding of a so-called “seed”
region of 6 to 8 nucleotides at its 5⬘ end to
a region on its target mRNA. Once the
miRNA has bound, three things can happen: the target mRNA can be directly tar-

prior to D to JH rearrangement, but it is required for one or
more stages, starting with VH to DJH recombination.
One drawback of the knockout approach, however, is that
it only defines the first stage in differentiation at which the
transcription factor is required. More recent variations have
exploited knockin genetics (Figure 10-4e) to generate animals that express fluorescent markers under the control of

geted for cleavage; the mRNA can be
destabilized; or translation from the mRNA
can be repressed. Furthermore, we now
know that a single miRNA can target the
synthesis of many proteins, and each
mRNA can be the target of more than one

the transcription factor promoters, so that every point at
which the transcription factor is expressed can be delineated. The staging of transcription factor expression is then
correlated with the expression of both cell-surface markers
and immunoglobulin gene rearrangement. The sequence of
B-cell development described in the next few sections has
been elucidated using a combination of these strategies.

miRNA, thus adding to both the flexibility
and the complexity of this mode of control over gene expression.
But does regulation by miRNAs operate during B-cell development? Several
lines of evidence suggest that the answer
to this question is an unequivocal “yes.”
From a theoretical standpoint, it is clear
that the developmental changes that
occur as B cells mature require rapid
changes in the concentrations of such
important proteins as transcription factors
and pro- and anti-apoptotic molecules,
among other regulatory proteins. The
need for such rapid alterations in protein
concentrations can be met efficiently by
the type of post-transcriptional control
mechanisms mediated by miRNAs.
Conditional loss of the gene encoding
the Dicer nuclease destroys all capacity to
synthesize mature miRNAs. Ablation of
Dicer in early B-cell progenitors resulted in
a developmental block at the pro- to pre-Bcell transition. In these experiments, the
pro-apoptotic molecule Bim, was expressed
at higher concentrations in Dicer-ablated
than in normal B-cell progenitors.
Sequences in the 3⬘ untranslated region of
the Bim gene were found to be complementary to miRNAs of the 17~92 family,
suggesting that members of this family
normally down-regulate Bim at this stage
of development, enabling B cells to pass
through this transition. The 17~92 family of
miRNAs was also shown to affect expression of TdT and hence N-sequence addition. Other alterations in immunoglobulin
gene expression were also observed in the
absence of 17~92 miRNAs, including an
increase in the expression of sterile transcripts. These data collectively demonstrate that miRNAs are important in the

control of the pro- to pre-B-cell transition and
affect both the expression of pro-apoptotic
molecules and the nature of the Ig repertoire. As one would predict from these
collective results, animals with increased
expression of miR-17~92 family members
express lower levels of Bim and suffer from
a lympho-proliferative disorder and autoimmune disease.
Members of the 17~92 miRNA family
were also found to control the levels of
the Pten protein, which acts as an inhibitor of the pro-survival PI3 kinase and Akt
signaling pathway. An increase in the levels of the miR-17~92 molecules allows for
greater destruction of the Pten mRNA,
resulting in increased cell survival and a
corresponding increase in the number of
lymphocytes available to proliferate.
Other investigators have addressed the
question of which miRNAs are expressed at
different stages of B-cell development. A
combination of genomic (in silico analyses)
and more classical molecular biological
approaches have identified several miRNA
species and/or families that are implicated
in the control of B-cell development.
Perhaps the most well studied miRNA
is miR-150, which is highly expressed in
mature and resting B cells but not in their
progenitors. The miR-150 molecule has
been shown to depress the level of
expression of the transcription factor
c-Myb, known to be essential for the control of B-cell development. As might have
been predicted, the pattern of c-Myb
expression in lymphocyte development is
complementary to that of miR-150, in that
c-Myb is highly expressed in lymphoid
progenitors and is down-regulated upon
their maturation; in addition, transcriptional analysis confirmed that miR-150 is

Recently, attention has begun to focus on small molecular
weight miRNA species, which have profound effects on the
stability of mRNA and hence on the expression of particular
proteins. In Advances Box 10-2, we describe the effects of
some of the miRNAs that have recently been shown to affect
B-cell differentiation. This is currently an extremely active
research area.

an important factor in the regulation of
the levels of the c-Myb transcription factor during B-cell development.
MiR-150 is also implicated in B-1/B-2 lineage specification. B-cell-specific deletion of
the c-myb gene stops B-cell development at
the pro- to pre-B transition and also leads to
the complete disappearance of the B-1 subset of B cells. If miR-150 is responsible for
down-modulating the levels of c-Myb in
vivo, then it might be predicted that a deficiency in miR-150 would result in an opposite phenotype to that expressed by a c-Myb
deficient animal, and such was indeed
found to be the case. Deficiency of miR-150
was found to result in an expansion of the
B-1-B-cell pool, with a resulting increase in
the levels of IgM antibody secretion.
The study of miRNA control of mammalian gene expression and lymphocyte
development is still in its infancy, but the
ability to manipulate and isolate cells at
discrete stages in the developmental
sequence provides a particularly tractable
system in which to analyze the range of
actions of different families of miRNAs. This
field will undoubtedly be one to watch.

FIGURE 10-5 Expression of cell-surface markers on HSC and lymphoid progenitor cells. The maturation of HSCs into lymphoid
progenitors, and the progressive loss of the ability to differentiate into other blood-cell lineages can be followed by the expression of the cellsurface markers as well as by the acquisition of RAG and TdT activity.
that followed by the predominant B-2-B-cell population. Specific aspects of development that differ among the various
B-cell subsets will be addressed toward the end of this chapter.
HSCs
HSCs are both self-renewing (they can divide to create identical copies of the parent cell) and multipotential (they can
divide to form daughter cells that are more differentiated
than the parent cell and that can develop along distinct
blood-cell lineages), and can give rise to all cells of the blood.
HSCs maintain a relatively large number of genes in a socalled “primed” state, and an individual HSC may possess
primed genes characteristic of multiple cell lineages. Primed
chromatin is associated with lower-than-usual numbers of
nucleosomes, is more accessible to enzyme activity than the
majority of chromatin in the cell, and shows histone methylation and acetylation patterns characteristic of active chromatin. Depending on the environmental stimuli to which
any given HSC is exposed, transcription factors may drive
the cell down a number of possible developmental pathways.
During the differentiation process that follows, primed chromatin regions containing genes that are not needed for the
selected developmental pathway are shut down.
In HSCs bound for a B-cell fate, the transcription factors
Ikaros, Purine box factor 1 (PU.1), and E2A participate in
the earliest stages of B-lineage development. Ikaros recruits

chromatin remodeling complexes to particular regions in
the DNA and ensures the accessibility of genes necessary for
B-cell development. PU.1 presides over a leukocytic “balancing act”; low levels of PU.1 favor lymphoid differentiation,
whereas cells expressing higher levels of PU.1 veer off to a
myeloid fate. The level of PU.1 protein expressed is in turn
regulated by the transcriptional repressor Gfi1, which downregulates the expression of PU.1 to the levels necessary for
progression down the B-cell pathway. E2A expression contributes to the maintenance of the HSC pool by participating
in the regulation of cell cycle control in this population.
As noted in Chapter 9, HSCs express the cell-surface molecule c-Kit (CD117), which is the receptor for stem cell factor
(SCF). SCF is a cytokine that exists in both membrane-bound
and soluble forms and the SCF-c-Kit interaction is critical for
the development, in adult animals, of multipotential progenitor cells (MPPs). Membrane-bound SCF plays a role in
retaining the HSCs and its daughter progenitor cells in the
appropriate environmental niches in the bone marrow. HSCs
also express the stem cell associated antigen-1 (Sca-1). Both
c-Kit and Sca-1 are expressed in parallel on early progenitor
cells, and the levels of their expression drop as the cells commit to a particular cell lineage (Figure 10-5). HSCs are often
described as being Lin⫺, a designation that refers to the fact
that they have no “lineage markers” characteristic of a particular blood-cell subpopulation.

B-Cell Development
MPPs
MPPs generated on receipt of SCF/c-Kit signaling lose the
capacity for extensive self-renewal, but retain the potential to
differentiate into several different hematopoietic lineages.
MPP cells retain the expression of c-Kit and Sca-1 and transiently express the molecule CD34. Indeed, antibodies to
CD34 are used clinically to isolate cells at this stage in hematopoiesis. MPPs also express the chemokine receptor CXCR4,
which enables them to bind the stromal cell-derived chemokine CXCL12. The interaction between CXCL12 and CXCR4
is important in ensuring that the progenitor cell occupies the
correct niche within the bone marrow (see Figure 10-3).
LMPPs
The progenitor cell on its way to becoming a B cell then
begins to express the fms-related tyrosine kinase 3 receptor
(flt-3). Flt-3 binds to the membrane-bound flt-3 ligand on
bone marrow stromal cells and signals the progenitor cell to
begin synthesizing the IL-7 receptor (IL-7R, CD127). Flt-3
is expressed on B-cell progenitors from this point until the
pro-B stage and acts synergistically with IL-7R to promote
the growth of cells bearing flt-3 and IL-7R. The expression of
flt-3 on the surface of the developing cell marks the loss of
the potential of the MPP cell to develop into erythrocytes or
megakaryocytes, and therefore characterizes a new level of
cell commitment; however, this progenitor still retains the
capacity to develop along either the myeloid or the lymphoid
pathways.
These cells, now c-Kit⫹, Sca-1⫹, and flt-3⫹, are termed
lymphoid-primed, multipotential progenitors (LMPPs)
(see Figure 10-5). As they become further committed to the
lymphoid lineage, levels of the stem-cell antigens c-Kit and
Sca-1 fall, and cells destined to become lymphocytes begin
to express RAG1/2 and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT) (Chapter 7). Expression of the genes encoding
RAG1/2, TdT, IL-7R, and the B-cell-specific transcription
factor EBF1 are all up-regulated at the end of this stage.
ELPs
Expression of RAG1/2 defines the cell as an early lymphoid
progenitor cell (ELP). A subset of ELPs migrates out of the
bone marrow to seed the thymus and serve as the T-cell
progenitors (discussed in Chapter 9). The rest of the ELPs
remain in the bone marrow as B-cell progenitors. On these
cells, the levels of the early c-Kit and Sca-1 antigens decrease
as the levels of the IL-7R increase, and the ELP now develops
into a CLP.
CLPs
At the CLP stage, the progenitor on its way to B-cell commitment still retains the potential to mature along the
NK, conventional DC, or T-cell lineages. At this point in
development, signals received through IL-7R promote
cell survival and enhance the production of EBF-1 and
other transcription factors that are required for later steps

in the B-cell differentiation pathway. Signaling through
the IL-7R occurs via pathways familiar from Chapter 4.
Specifically, an IL-7R-mediated JAK-STAT pathway
induces the up-regulation of the anti-apoptotic molecule
Mcl1. Signaling through IL-7R also results in the upregulation of the C-myc and N-myc genes, which signal
the cell proliferation characteristic of the later, pro-B-cell
stage.
CLPs are c-Kitlow, Sca-1low, and IL-7R⫹ and have lost
myeloid potential. However, as a CLP destined to differentiate
along the B cell pathway matures, the chromatin containing
the immunoglobulin locus becomes increasingly accessible
and the developing lymphocyte approaches the point at
which it is irrevocably committed to the B-cell lineage.

The Later Steps of B-Cell Development Result
in Commitment to the B-Cell Phenotype
Figure 10-6 illustrates the expression of cell-surface markers,
and the patterns of rearrangement of immunoglobulin
heavy-chain and light-chain genes starting at the pre-pro
B-cell stage of development. The stages of B-cell differentiation have been defined by more than one group of scientists
and, as a result, two systems of nomenclature are in common
use. The first, and most widely used, is the Basel nomenclature (pre-pro, pro, pre-B, immature B) developed by Melchers
and colleagues. The second (A, B, C, C⬘, D, E) is that defined
by Hardy et al., and the process by which this system of classification of B-cell development was established is described
in detail in Classic Experiment Box 10-3.
Pre-Pro B Cells
With the acquisition of the B-cell lineage-specific marker
B220 (CD45R), and the expression of increasing levels of the
transcription factor EBF1, the developing cell enters the prepro-B-cell stage. EBF1 is an important transcription factor in
lymphoid development, and therefore transcription of the
Ebf1 gene is itself under the control of multiple transcription
factors (Figure 10-7). These each bind at distinct promoter
regions, and hence the level of transcription of the Ebf1 gene
can vary considerably depending on the combination of
controlling factors present at any particular developmental
stage. At the pre-pro-B-cell stage, EBF-1, along with E2A,
binds to the immunoglobulin gene, promoting accessibility
of the D-JH locus and preparing the cells for the first step of
Ig gene recombination. EBF-1 is also essential to the full
expression of many B-cell proteins, including Ig␣,Ig␤
(CD79␣,␤), and the genes encoding the pre-B-cell receptor,
which will be expressed when heavy-chain VDJ recombination is complete.
Pre-pro B cells remain in contact with CXCL-12-secreting stromal cells in the bone marrow. However, the onset of
D to JH gene recombination classifies the cell as an early
pro-B cell, and at this stage the developing cell moves within
the bone marrow, seeking contact with IL-7 secreting stromal cells.

the expression of PAX5, and together the E2A

The Stages of B-Cell Development: Characterization
of the Hardy Fractions
Richard Hardy’s

laboratory was
one of the first to combine flow cytometry and molecular biology in experiments
designed to analyze lymphocyte maturation. In this feature, we describe what
those researchers did and how they generated a model of the sequencing of the
stages of B-cell development from their
data.
When Hardy and colleagues began
their characterization of B-cell lineage
development in the early 1990s, prior work
using molecular analysis of long term bone
marrow cell lines had already established
the sequential rearrangement of heavychain and light-chain immunoglobulin
genes. In addition, the expression of a
number of cell-surface markers on bone
marrow cells had been measured, and
several of these antigens had been shown
to be co-expressed with B220 (CD45R),
which had already been established as a
B-cell differentiation antigen. Hardy’s
approach was to characterize the sequence
of expression of those antigenic markers
that were found on the same cells as B220.
The hypothesis was that some of these
markers may be expressed on early B-cell
progenitors and might therefore help to
generate a scheme of B-cell development.
In order to place cells expressing different
combinations of markers into a developmental lineage, Hardy then sorted cells
bearing each combination of his selected
markers, and placed them into co-cultures
with a bone marrow stromal cell line. After
defined times in culture, he harvested the
hematopoietic cells and re-characterized
their surface marker expression.
The markers used in these experiments included B220 (CD45R) and CD43
(leukosialin), which had previously been
shown to be expressed on granulocytes
and all T cells, but was not present on
mature B cells, with the exception of
plasma cells. In addition, their experiments employed antibodies directed
against Heat Stable Antigen, or HSA
(CD24) and BP-1, an antigen on bone

been previously shown to be differentially expressed at varying stages of
lymphoid differentiation.
The first set of experiments analyzed
those cells bearing both B220 and CD43 for
the levels of their expression of HSA and
BP-1 (Figures 1 and 2). Flow cytometry
plots demonstrated that the B220⫹CD43⫹
cells neatly resolved into three discrete
subpopulations. The first, labeled A in Figure 1, expressed neither HSA, nor BP-1. The
second, labeled B, expressed HSA, but not
BP-1, and the third expressed both of these
antigens. Analysis of Ig gene rearrangements in these populations revealed that
no gene rearrangements occurred in
fraction A but that D to JH gene segment
rearrangements had begun in fraction B.

Pro-B Cells
In the early pro-B-cell stage, D to JH recombination is completed and the cell begins to prepare for V to DJH joining.
However, this final recombination event awaits the expression of the quintessential B-cell transcription factor, PAX5.
The Pax5 gene is among EBF-1’s transcriptional targets
(see Figure 10-7) and transcription of genes controlled by the
PAX5 transcription factor denotes passage to the pro-B-cell
stage of development, at which point the expression of non-Blineage genes is permanently blocked. PAX5 can act as a transcriptional repressor, as well as an activator, and blocks
Notch-1 gene expression, thereby terminating any residual
potential of the pro-B cell to develop along the T-cell lineage.
Many important B-cell genes are turned on at this stage, under
the control of PAX5 and other transcription factors. Among
these is the gene encoding CD19, which we first encountered in

rearrangements occur in fraction C
(although at the time, the method of analysis that Hardy and colleagues used failed to
reveal this second type of rearrangement).
So at this point, we know that three
distinct types of B-cell precursors express
both B220 and CD43, and can be discriminated on the basis of their levels of the
further two antigens, HSA and BP-1. Fraction A corresponds to what we now know
as pre-pro B cells, fraction B to early pro-B
cells, and fraction C to late pro-B cells.
Culture of fraction C cells yielded cells
that expressed membrane (m) IgM; similarly, culture of fraction B cells also yielded
daughter cells expressing mIgM, but at a
lower frequency than fraction C cells, suggesting that cells in fraction C were further along the differentiation pathway to
mIgM⫹ B cells. Furthermore, the three different fractions displayed differential
dependence on the need to adhere to the
stromal cell layer. Cells from fraction A
required stromal cell contact for survival.
Fraction B cells survived best in contact
with the stromal cells, but were able to
survive in a culture in which they were
separated from the stromal cells by a
semipermeable membrane. Under these
conditions, they could still receive soluble
factors generated by the stromal cells, but
were prevented from generating adhesive
interactions with stromal cell-surfacebound growth factors. Fraction C cells

CD19 is considered a quintessential B-cell marker and is often
used as such in flow cytometry experiments.
Once the PAX5 protein is expressed, a mutual reinforcement occurs between PAX5 and EBF-1 expression, as illustrated in Figure 10-7, with each transcription factor serving
to enhance the expression of the other. The PAX5 protein
continues to be expressed in mature B cells until the B cell
commits to a plasma-cell fate following antigenic stimulation (see Chapter 12). The higher levels of EBF1 expression
induced by PAX5 also allow for an increase in the level of
IL-7R expression.
PAX5 promotes VH to D recombination by contracting the
IgH locus, thus bringing the distant VH gene segments closer
to the D-JH region. B cells deficient in PAX5 permit D to JH
Ig gene rearrangement, but do not allow recombination of

survived and proliferated in the absence
of stromal cell contact. Analysis of the factors secreted by the stromal cells that
were necessary for survival and proliferation of the fraction B and C cells revealed
one of them to be interleukin 7.
Hence, using the criteria of Ig gene
rearrangements and phenotypic analysis
of cultured cell populations, Hardy and
colleagues were able to place the three
fractions in sequence; cells of fraction A
gave rise to cells of fraction B, which in
turn mature into cells of fraction C.
Careful analysis of the contour graph of
fraction C reveals that it, in turn, can be
subdivided on the basis of the levels of
expression of HSA. That population of cells
bearing higher levels of HSA, as well as
BP-1, is now defined as fraction C⬘, which
corresponds to early or large pre-B cells.
Hardy and colleagues next turned
their attention to those cells that
expressed B220, but had lost CD43, and
measured their cell-surface expression of
mIgM (Figure 3). Three populations of
cells were again evident, which they
labeled D, E, and F (Figure 4). Cells belonging to fraction D expressed zero to low
levels of mIgM, showed complete heavychain rearrangement, and some lightchain rearrangement and correspond to
small pre-B cells. Cells belonging to fraction E displayed high levels of mIgM as
well as of B220, complete heavy-chain

rearrangement, and most of the cells in
that fraction also displayed light-chain
gene rearrangement. Fraction E cells are
thus immature B cells ready to leave the
bone marrow. Subsequent further characterization of fraction F cells showed that,
in addition to surface IgM, these cells also
bear surface IgD and therefore represent
fully mature B cells, presumably recirculating through the bone marrow.
Thus, Hardy’s experiments revealed
that the pool of progenitor and precursor
B cells in the bone marrow represents a
complex mixture of cells at different
stages of development, with varying
requirements for stromal cell contact and
interleukin support.
These elegant experiments still had
one more story to tell that did not appear
in the original paper, but which emerged
in later publications. Single-cell PCR analysis of fraction C cells showed that many of
them had nonproductive rearrangements
on both heavy-chain chromosomes (see
Figure 2). In contrast, all the cells from the
C⬘ fraction demonstrated productive rearrangements on one of the heavy-chain
chromosomes. Fraction C cells therefore
represent B cells that have been unable to
productively rearrange one of their heavychain genes and that will therefore eventually die by apoptosis. The C⬘ fraction also
included the highest proportion of cells in
cycle of any of the B220⫹ B-cell stages in

the VH to the D Ig gene segment, indicating that PAX5 is
essential to the second step of Ig gene rearrangement.
Expression of the signaling components of the B-cell receptor, Ig␣ and Ig␤, also begins at the pro-B-cell stage and the
Ig␣,Ig␤ signaling complex is briefly placed on the cell surface
in complex with the chaperone protein calnexin. Although this
Ig␣,Ig␤ complex has been referred to as a “pro-BCR,” no ligand
has yet been established for it, nor do we yet understand the
importance of any signaling that may emanate from it.
Also during the pro-B-cell stage, c-Kit is once more
turned on briefly, enabling the cell to receive signals from
stem cell factor. By the beginning of the pre-B-cell stage of
development, expression of c-Kit is irreversibly turned back
off. By the late pro-B-cell stage, most cells have initiated VH
to DJH Ig gene segment recombination, which is completed
by the onset of the early pre-B-cell stage.

the marrow. This is consistent with the
notion that the new heavy chain is associating with the surrogate light chain at the
C⬘ stage and the pre-B-cell receptor complex is expressed on the cell surface, triggering the period of clonal expansion of B
cells described in this chapter.

Pre-B Cells
During the pre-B-cell stage, the cell expresses a pre-B-cell
receptor composed of the rearranged heavy chain, complexed with the VpreB and ␭5 components of the surrogate
light chain (see Figure 7-10). The appearance of this pre-Bcell receptor signals the entry of the developing B cell into
the large, or early pre-B-cell phase. As we learned in Chapter 7, the expression of the heavy chain at the cell surface is
necessary for the termination of further heavy-chain rearrangement and ensures allelic exclusion of the Ig heavychain genes. Animals deficient in the expression of either the
pre-B-cell receptor, or of the signaling components Ig␣,Ig␤,
fail to progress to the pre-B-cell stage.
Signaling through the pre-B-cell receptor induces a few
rounds of proliferation in the pre-B cell. This proliferative

phase correlates in time with the expression on the pre-Bcell surface of CD25, the ␣ chain of the high-affinity IL-2
receptor ␣ chain (see Figure 4-8), which first appears on B
cells at the pro-B-cell stage. Since the pre-B-cell proliferative
process appears mainly to be driven by IL-7, the functional
significance of CD25 at this point is unclear. However, its
appearance is frequently used as a marker of the late pro-Bcell to early pre-B-cell stage of development.
VH gene recombination is energetically expensive to the
organism, as not all developing B cells are successful in
undergoing productive VH gene rearrangements, and those
that fail to do so are lost by apoptosis. It therefore seems
logical that those B cells that have achieved productive heavychain expression should be allowed to proliferate. Each individual daughter cell derived from this proliferative process is
then free to participate in a different light-chain rearrangement event. Most individuals will therefore have multiple B
cells expressing precisely the same heavy-chain rearrangement but each with a different light chain, and many different
receptor specificities can thereby be generated from each successful heavy-chain rearrangement. Recall from Chapter 9
that an analogous process of ␤ chain rearrangement, followed
by proliferation prior to ␣ rearrangement, occurs in T cells.
If the pre-B-cell receptor cannot be displayed on the cell
surface because of non-productive VHDJH gene rearrangements, B-cell development is halted and the cell is lost to
apoptosis. This stage in B-cell development is therefore
referred to as the pre-B-cell (1st) checkpoint (see Figure 10-6).
Progress through this checkpoint depends on some type of
signaling event through the pre-B-cell receptor, and recent
evidence suggests that this is mediated via interactions
between arginine-rich regions in the non-immunoglobulin
portion of the ␭5 component of the surrogate light chain, or
in the CDR3 regions of some heavy chains, with negatively
charged molecules on the surface of the stromal cells.
Pre-B-cell receptor signaling induces the transient downregulation of RAG1/2 and the loss of TdT activity. Together,
these events ensure that, as soon as one heavy-chain gene has
successfully rearranged, no further heavy-chain recombination is possible. This results in the phenomenon of allelic
exclusion, whereby the genes of only one of the two heavychain alleles can be expressed in a single B cell. As a result of
this pre-B-cell receptor signaling, the chromatin at the unused
heavy-chain locus undergoes a number of physical changes
that render it incapable of participating in further rearrangement events. Recall that IL-7 provided one of the signals that
brought the VH, D, and JH loci into close apposition with one
another at the beginning of VHDJH recombination. A reduction in IL-7 signaling at the pre-B-cell stage now reverses that
initial locus contraction, resulting in the physical separation of
the VH, D, and JH gene segments in the unrearranged heavychain locus. This decontraction is then followed by deacetylation events that deactivate the unused heavy-chain locus and
return it to a heterochromatic (inactive, closed) configuration.
Surrogate light-chain expression is also terminated by a
negative feedback round of signaling through the pre-B-cell

receptor. At the end of pre-BCR-signaled cell proliferation, the
pre-B-cell receptor is lost from the surface, and this signals
entry into the small or late pre-B-cell stage. At this point,
light-chain rearrangement is initiated with the re-expression
of the Rag1/2 genes. Very little TdT activity remains at this
stage, and therefore N region addition occurs less frequently
in light chains than in heavy chains. In the mouse, light-chain
rearrangement begins on one of the ␬ chain chromosomes,
followed by the other. If neither ␬ chain rearrangement is successful, rearrangement is then successively attempted on each
of the ␭ chain chromosomes. In humans, rearrangement is
initiated randomly at either the ␬ or the ␭ loci.
Once a light-chain gene rearrangement has been successfully completed, the IgM receptor is expressed on the cell
surface, signaling entry into the immature B-cell stage. If the
attempts at light-chain immunoglobulin gene rearrangement
are not successful, the nascent cell is eventually lost at the
immature B-cell (2nd) checkpoint (see Figure 10-6). However,
given the availability of four separate chromosomes on which
to attempt rearrangement, and the opportunity for light-chain
editing in the case of unproductive rearrangement, most
pre-B cells that have successfully rearranged their heavy
chains will progress to the formation of an immature B cell.

Immature B Cells in the Bone Marrow Are
Exquisitely Sensitive to Tolerance Induction
Immature B cells bear a functional receptor in the form of
membrane IgM, but have not yet begun to express any other
class of immunoglobulin. They continue to express B220,
CD25, IL-7R, and CD19.
Once the functional BCR is assembled on the B-cell
membrane, the receptor must be tested for its ability to bind
to self antigens, in order to ensure that as few as possible
autoreactive B cells emerge from the bone marrow. Those
immature B cells that are found to bear autoreactive receptors undergo one of three fates; some are lost from the repertoire prior to leaving the bone marrow, by the BCR-mediated
apoptotic process of clonal deletion. The loss of B cells bearing self-reactive receptors within the bone marrow is referred
to as central tolerance. Other autoreactive B cells reactivate
their RAG genes to initiate the process of light-chain receptor editing (see Chapter 7). Some autoreactive B cells that
recognize soluble self antigens within the bone marrow may
survive to escape the bone marrow environment, but become
anergic, or unresponsive, to any further antigenic stimuli.
The concept of negative selection of lymphocytes bearing
autoreactive receptors should be familiar from the discussion
of T-cell tolerance in Chapter 9. However, functional differences between T cells and B cells mean that the selection
processes against autoreactive B cells are different from those
that protect against the emergence of autoreactive T cells, and
indeed can be somewhat less stringent. Since stimulation of
B-2 B cells requires T-cell help, an autoreactive B cell cannot
respond to antigen with antibody production unless there is
also an autoreactive T cell that can provide the necessary

B-Cell Development
cytokines and costimulation (Chapter 12). Thus, it is quite
possible that most individuals carry significant numbers of
autoreactive B cells within their mature B-cell repertoires that
are never activated.
There are also mechanistic differences between the modes
of negative selection among B and T cells. At this point, no
equivalent of the AIRE protein has been shown to exist for
B-cell selection, and so B-cell negative selection within the
bone marrow is more limited with respect to the available
tolerogenic antigenic specificities than is T-cell negative
selection in the thymus.

Many, but Not All, Self-Reactive B Cells Are
Deleted within the Bone Marrow
Our understanding of how the immune system eliminates or
neutralizes autoreactive threats has been facilitated by the
development of transgenic animals which express both
deliberately introduced auto-antigens and the receptors that
recognize them. It has long been established that crosslinking the IgM receptors of immature B cells in vitro (performed experimentally by treating the cells with antibodies
against the receptor ␮ chain) results in death by apoptosis. In
contrast, performing the same experiments with mature B
cells, bearing both IgM and IgD receptors, results in activation. David Nemazee and colleagues set out to test whether
the apoptotic response of immature B cells in vitro reflected
what happens in the bone marrow in vivo when an immature B cell meets a self antigen.
Nemazee et al.’s approach was conceptually simple,
although experimentally complex, particularly for the time
period in which the work was done (1989). They generated
mice transgenic for both a heavy and a light chain specific
for the MHC molecule H-2Kk. All the B cells in this mouse
therefore made only anti-H-2Kk antibodies. If immature B
cells undergo selection to prevent autoimmunity, these cells
would be selected against in a mouse that expresses the
H-2Kk gene for MHC. By appropriate breeding, they introduced the immunoglobulin H-2Kk-specific transgenes into
mice bearing two different MHC genotypes.
In the first group of mice (Figure 10-8a), which bore
H-2Kd but no H-2Kk antigens, they were able to detect the
transgenic antibody at high frequency on the surface of B
cells and at high concentration in the serum (Table 10-1).
This makes sense, as the transgenic antibody would be
unable to bind the H-2Kd molecules and so the B cells that
produce it would not be negatively selected. However, when
they bred these animals with mice of the H-2Kk type (Figure
10-8b), no membrane-bound or secreted anti-H-2Kk antibodies could be detected, suggesting that all immature B
cells bearing the potentially autoimmune receptor antibodies had been deleted in the bone marrow. This deletion
occurred via induction of apoptosis in the autoimmune cells.
Interestingly, in the H-2Kk/d mice, not all B cells bearing
the autoimmune transgenes were deleted, even though all B
cells in this mouse should bear the anti-H-2Kk receptor

(Figure 10-8c). Closer examination revealed that some of the
residual transgene-expressing B cells in the bone marrow
had undergone light-chain receptor editing (see Chapter 7),
changing their antigen specificity so they no longer bound
the H-2Kk antigen. Recent experiments suggest that in vivo,
a significant fraction of potentially autoimmune B cells
undergo receptor editing (or even VH gene replacement
(Chapter 7), and successfully generate acceptable BCRs prior
to release from the bone marrow.
In normal animals, not all potentially autoimmune B cells
are lost to clonal deletion or altered via receptor editing or
VH gene replacement within the bone marrow, however;
some are released to the periphery and subject to further
rounds of selection.

B Cells Exported from the Bone Marrow Are
Still Functionally Immature
Once the B cell expresses IgM on its membrane (mIgM), it is
referred to as an immature B cell. This B cell is ready for
export to the spleen, where it completes its developmental
program. Immature B cells have a short half-life, in part as a
result of expressing low levels of the anti-apoptotic molecules Bcl-2 and Bcl-xl. They also express high levels of the
cell-surface molecule, Fas, which is capable of transmitting a
death signal when bound by its ligand (see Chapters 4 and
9). Immature B cells are exquisitely susceptible to tolerance
induction, and if they encounter a self antigen at this stage of
development, the B cells will re-express the RAG1 and RAG2
genes and edit their light-chain genes. If receptor editing
fails to yield a suitable receptor, the cell undergoes apoptosis.
The study of B-cell development in the periphery, like that
in the bone marrow, has benefited significantly from the ingenious application of flow cytometry, which has enabled the
classification of immature B cells into two subpopulations of
transitional B cells (T1, T2). These transitional B cells act
sequentially as the precursors to the fully mature B cell.
T1 and T2 Transitional B Cells
T1 and T2 transitional B cells were characterized initially on
the basis of their cell-surface expression of immunoglobulin
receptors and membrane markers (Table 10-2). T1 cells are
mIgMhi, mIgD⫺/lo, CD21⫺, CD23⫺, CD24⫹, and CD93⫹. T2
cells differ from T1 cells in having higher levels of mIgD and
in expressing CD21 (the complement receptor and B-cell
co-receptor; see Figure 3-7) and CD23. T2 cells also express
BAFF-R, the receptor for the B-cell survival factor BAFF,
whose expression is dependent on signals received through
the BCR. As B cells differentiate from the transitional T2
state to full maturity, they raise their levels of mIgD still further, while reducing the expression of mIgM. They also cease
to express CD24 and CD93.
T1 cells that have been labeled and transferred into recipient mice develop into T2 cells. Similarly, both transitional
B-cell subpopulations have been demonstrated to have the

the spleen from the bloodstream through the marginal sinuses, percolating into the T-cell zones, and differentiating into T2 transitional B
cells, which gain the ability to enter the B-cell follicles and recirculate.

There, the T2 cells complete their differentiation into mature follicular

cells. [Adapted from J. B. Chung, M. Silverman, and J. G. Monroe, 2003, Transi-

capacity to differentiate into mature B cells. These experiments
have therefore proven that the order of the developmental
sequence progresses from T1 to T2 to mature B cell. The time
in transit of a T1 cell to a mature B cell has been measured to
be approximately 3 to 4 days. Most T1 B cells differentiate to
T2 cells within the spleen, but a minority of about 25% of transitional B cells emerge from the bone marrow already in the
T2 state. The increased level of maturity of T2 cells correlates
with changes in the expression of chemokine and cytokine
receptors, such that T2 cells, but not T1 cells, are capable of

recirculating among the blood, lymph nodes, and spleen; and
T2 cells, but not T1 cells, can enter B-cell follicles.
Figure 10-9 shows the path of the developing transitional
B cell as it leaves the bone marrow and enters the spleen
through the central arteriole, which deposits it in the marginal sinuses, just inside the outer marginal zone. (In
humans, the anatomy of the spleen is slightly different, and
the cells arrive in the spleen in a peri-follicular zone.) From
there, the T1 B cell percolates through to the T-cell zone,
where some fraction of T1 cells will mature into the T2 state.
T2 B cells are then able to enter the follicles or the marginal
zone where they complete their developmental program into
fully mature, recirculating B lymphocytes.
In Chapter 7, we learned that mature B cells bear on their
surfaces two classes of membrane-bound immunoglobulins—
IgM and IgD—and that the expression of mIgD along with
mIgM requires carefully regulated mRNA splicing events. It is
at the point of transit between the T1 and T2 stages of development that we observe the onset of these splicing capabilities.
Mature B cells bear almost 10 times more mIgD than mIgM,
and so mIgD expression results in significant up-regulation in
the number of B-cell immunoglobulin receptors.
The effect of strong BCR engagement with a multivalent, or
membrane-bound, antigen depends on the maturational status
of the transitional B cell (Figure 10-10 and Table 10-3). Selfreactive T1 B cells are eliminated by apoptosis in response to a
strong antigenic signal, in a process reminiscent of thymocyte
negative selection, leading to peripheral tolerance; recent experiments have suggested that in healthy adults, fully 55% to 75%
of immature B cells are lost by this process. In contrast, once the
B cell has matured into a T2 transitional B cell, it becomes resistant to antigen-induced apoptosis, reminiscent of thymocytes
that have reached the single-positive stage of development. This

signal. Transitional cells that have received this survival signal up-regulate their BAFF receptors (positive selection). Those T2 B cells that fail

the fact that T2 B cells have increased their expression of the

expression at different stages of B-cell development. Animals
that fail to express a BCR during the immature B-cell stage
lose the capacity to make any mature B cells at all. This indicates that some low level of tonic signaling through the BCR,
analogous to the positive selection signal needed by developing thymocytes, is required for continued generation and
survival of immature B cells. B cells unable to receive this
signal die at the T2 stage (see Figure 10-10). Those T2 B cells
able to receive the follicular signal up-regulate the expression of the receptor for the B-cell survival factor BAFF.
Given the different outcomes of signaling through the
BCR for T1 versus T2 B cells, it is clear that there must be
differences in the signaling pathways downstream of the BCR
in the two transitional B-cell types. Specifically, BCR-mediated
signaling of T1 B cells results in calcium release without
significant production of diacylglycerol, and provides an
apoptotic signal. In contrast, receipt of BCR signals by T2 B
cells induces both an increase in the concentration of intracytoplasmic calcium and in diacylglycerol production. This
combination of intracellular second messengers delivers
both maturational and survival signals to the cell and suggests the involvement of a diacylglycerol-activated protein
kinase in survival signaling (see Chapter 3).
But what causes this difference in the signal transduction
pathways between T1 and T2 cells? A partial answer to this
question appears to lie in differences in the composition of
the lipid membranes of the two types of cells. Immature T1
B cells contain approximately half as much cholesterol as
their more mature counterparts, and this reduction in cholesterol levels appears to prevent efficient clustering of the
B-cell receptor into lipid rafts upon BCR stimulation. This
may cause a reduction of the strength of BCR signaling in T1
versus T2 immature B cells.
The development of B cells through the transitional phase is
absolutely dependent on signaling through the BAFF receptor
(BAFF-R). BAFF-R expression is first detected in T1 B cells
and increases steadily thereafter. BAFF is then required constitutively throughout the life of mature B cells. Signaling through
the BAFF/BAFF-R axis promotes survival of transitional B cells
by inducing the synthesis of anti-apoptotic factors such as Bcl2, Bcl-xl, and Mcl-1, as well as by interfering with the function
of the pro-apoptotic molecule Bim (see Figure 9-12).
The discovery of a B-cell survival signal mediated by
BAFF/BAFF-R interactions, and distinct from survival signals
emanating from the BCR, extends our thinking about how B
cells are selected for survival in the periphery. In the presence
of high levels of BAFF, B cells that may not otherwise receive
sufficient quantities of survival signals via the BCR may survive a selection process that would otherwise eliminate them.
In this way, BAFF can provide plasticity and flexibility in the
process of B-cell deletion. However, this may be accomplished
at the cost of maintaining potentially autoreactive cells.
T3 B Cells Are Primarily Self-Reactive and Anergic
Transitional T3 B cells were first characterized in the blood
and lymphoid organs by flow cytometry and were described

B-Cell Development
as being CD93⫹mIgMlowCD23⫹. The function of CD93 is so
far unknown; CD23 is a low-affinity receptor for some
classes of immunoglobulin, and the two markers were used
in these experiments only to identify the cell populations,
and not because of any particular reasons relevant to their
functionality. Recent experiments have suggested that the T3
population may represent B cells that have been rendered
anergic by contact with soluble self antigen but have not yet
been eliminated from the B-cell repertoire.
A transgenic system developed by Goodnow and colleagues first placed the concept of B-cell anergy, or unresponsiveness, onto a firm experimental footing. Anergic
lymphocytes clearly recognize their antigens, as shown by the
identification of low levels of molecular signals generated
within the cells after binding to antigen. However, rather than
being activated by antigen contact, anergic B cells fail to
divide, differentiate, or secrete antibody after stimulation,
and many die a short time after receipt of the antigenic signal.
Goodnow et al. developed the two groups of transgenic
mice illustrated in Figure 10-11a. One group of mice carried
a hen egg-white lysozyme (HEL) transgene linked to a
metallothionine promoter, which placed transcription of the
HEL gene under the control of zinc levels in the animals’ diet.
This allowed the investigators to alter the levels of soluble
HEL expressed in the experimental animals by changing the
concentration of zinc in their food. Under these experimental
conditions, HEL was expressed in the periphery of the animal, but not in the bone marrow. The other group of transgenic mice carried rearranged immunoglobulin heavy-chain
and light-chain transgenes encoding anti-HEL antibody; in
these transgenic mice, the rearranged anti-HEL transgene is
expressed by 60% to 90% of the mature peripheral B cells.
Goodnow then mated the two groups of transgenics to produce “double-transgenic” offspring carrying both the HEL
and anti-HEL transgenes (Figure 10-11b) and asked what
effect peripheral HEL expression would have on antibody
expression by B cells bearing the anti-HEL antibodies. They
found that the double-transgenic mice continued to generate
mature, peripheral B cells bearing anti-HEL membrane
immunoglobulin of both the IgM and IgD classes, indicating
that the B cells had fully matured. However, these B cells were
functionally nonresponsive, or anergic.
Flow-cytometric analysis of B cells from the doubletransgenic mice showed that, although large numbers of
anergic anti-HEL cells were present, they expressed membrane
IgM at levels about 20-fold lower than anti-HEL single transgenics (Figure 10-11b). When these mice were given an immunizing dose of HEL, few anti-HEL plasma cells were induced
and the serum anti-HEL titer was very low (Table 10-4). Furthermore, when antigen was presented to these anergic B cells
in the presence of T-cell help, many of the anergic B cells
responded by undergoing apoptosis. Additional analysis of
the anergic B cells demonstrated that they had a shorter halflife than normal B cells and appeared to be excluded from
the B-cell follicles in the lymph nodes and spleen. These
properties were dependent on the continuing presence of

antigen, as the B cell half-lives were restored to normal
lengths upon adoptive transfer of the transgene-bearing B cells
to an animal that was not expressing HEL. The anergic response
appears to be generated in vivo when immature B cells meet
a soluble self antigen.
More recent experiments have focused on defining the differences between the signal transduction events leading to
anergy versus activation. Anergic B cells show much less antigen-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of signaling molecules,
when compared with their nonanergic counterparts and antigen-stimulated calcium release from storage vesicles into the
cytoplasm of the anergic B cells was also dramatically reduced.
Anergic B cells also require higher levels of the cytokine BAFF
for continued survival, and it is likely that their reduced halflives result from unsuccessful competition with normal B cells
for limiting amounts of this survival molecule. One of the outcomes of BAFF signaling is a reduction in the cytoplasmic
levels of the pro-apoptotic molecule BIM; as might be expected,
anergic B cells show higher-than-normal levels of BIM and a
correspondingly increased susceptibility to apoptosis.
The conclusion from these experiments is that mechanisms exist, even after the B cells have exited the bone marrow and entered the periphery, that minimize the risk that B
cells make antibodies to soluble self proteins expressed outside the bone marrow. B cells reactive to such proteins
respond to receptor stimulation in the absence of appropriate T-cell help by anergy and eventual apoptosis.
What might be the function of these anergic cells? One possibility is that they serve to absorb excess self antigens that
might otherwise be able to deliver activating signals to highaffinity B cells and thus lead to autoimmune reactions. Another
is that they represent cells destined for apoptosis that do not yet
display the characteristic microanatomy of apoptotic cells. Yet
another is that these cells will eventually develop into B regulatory cells (see Chapter 12). As is so often the case in the
immune system, it is more than possible that all of these functions are subsumed within this intriguing cell population,
which remains the subject of intensive current investigation.

Mature, Primary B-2 B Cells Migrate to the
Lymphoid Follicles
Fully mature B cells express high levels of IgD and intermediate levels of IgM on their cell surfaces (see Table 10-2).
Mature B cells recirculate between the blood and the lymphoid organs, entering the B-cell follicles in the lymph nodes
and spleen, and responding to antigen encounter in the presence of T-cell help with antibody production (Chapter 12).
Approximately 10 million to 20 million B cells are produced
in the bone marrow of the mouse each day, but only about
10% of this number ever take up residence in the periphery
and only 1% to 3% will ever enter the recirculating follicular
B-2 B-cell pool. Some of these cells are lost to the process of
clonal deletion, but others are perfectly harmless B cells that
nonetheless fail to thrive. Experimental depletion of the
mature B-cell population, either chemically or by irradiation,

fluorescence emitted from this label indicated the level of membrane IgM expressed by the B cells. The nontransgenics (left) had
many B cells that expressed high levels of surface IgM but almost no
B cells that bound HEL above the background level of 1. Both antiHEL transgenics (middle) and anti-HEL/HEL double transgenics
(right) had large numbers of B cells that bound HEL (blue), although
the level of membrane IgM was about 20-fold lower in the double
transgenics. The data in Table 10-4 indicate that the B cells expressing anti-HEL in the double transgenics cannot mount a humoral
response to HEL.

followed by in vivo reconstitution, results in rapid replenishment of the B-cell follicular pool. This suggests that the follicular B-cell niches have a designated capacity and that once
full they turn away additional B cells. Most probably, the
mechanism for this homeostatic control of B-cell numbers
relies on competition for survival factors, particularly BAFF
and its related proteins.

Experiments using conditional RAG2 knockout animals, in which all new B-cell development was prevented
in otherwise healthy adult animals, indicate that follicular
B-2 B cells have a half-life of approximately 4.5 months. In
contrast, since B-1 B cells can self-renew in the periphery,
their numbers are unaffected in this experimental knockout animal.

B-Cell Development

The Development of B-1 and
Marginal-Zone B Cells
This chapter has so far focused on the development of those
B cells that belong to the best characterized B-cell subpopulation, B-2 B cells (or follicular B cells). Mature B-2 B cells
recirculate between the blood and the lymphoid organs, and
can be found in large numbers in the B-cell follicles of the
lymph nodes and spleen. However, other subsets of B cells
have been recognized that perform distinct functions,
occupy distinct anatomical locations, and pursue different
developmental programs. This section of the chapter will
therefore address the development and function of B-1 B
cells and of marginal-zone B cells (see Figure 10-12 for a
comparison of the properties of these three cell types).
As described more fully in Chapter 12, B-1 B cells generate antibodies against antigens shared by many bacterial
species and may do so even in the absence of antigenic
stimulation. They are the source of the so-called natural
antibodies: serum IgM antibodies that provide a first line of
protection against invasion by many types of microorganisms. Marginal-zone B cells take their name from their location in the outer zones of the white pulp of the spleen. They
are the first B cells encountered by blood-borne antigens

CHAPTER 10

entering the spleen and, like B-1 B cells, mainly (although
not exclusively) produce broadly cross-reactive antibodies of
the IgM class. Both B-1 and marginal-zone B cells can generate antibodies in the absence of T-cell help, although the
addition of helper T cells enhances antibody secretion and
allows for some degree of heavy-chain class switching.

B-1 B Cells Are Derived from a Separate
Developmental Lineage
B-1 B cells are phenotypically and functionally distinct from
B-2 B cells in a number of important ways. They occupy different anatomical niches from B-2 B cells, constituting 30% to
50% of the B cells in the pleural and peritoneal cavities of
mice, and representing about 1 million cells in each space. A
similar number of B-1 B cells can also be found in the spleen,
but there they represent a much smaller fraction (around 2%)
of the splenic B-cell population. B-1 B cells have only a relatively limited receptor repertoire, and their receptors tend to be
directed toward the recognition of commonly expressed
microbial carbohydrate antigens. These broadly cross-reactive,
low-affinity antigen receptors expressing minimal repertoire
diversity are reminiscent of the pathogen-associated molecular pattern (PAMP) receptors of the innate immune system

Adaptive Immunity: Development

(Chapter 5), and B-1 B cells are thus considered to play a role
that bridges those of the innate and adaptive immune systems.
In contrast with the T-1 transitional B-2 B cells, which
undergo apoptosis upon antigen challenge, transitional B-1
cells undergo apoptosis unless they interact with self antigens.
Work in a number of different transgenic systems has suggested
that relatively strong BCR engagement by self antigens provides a positive selection rather than a negative selection survival
signal for B-1 B cells. In contrast with B-2 cells and marginalzone cells (see below), B-1 B cells do not require interaction
with BAFF during the transitional stage of development.
For many years, the preeminent issue debated by those
interested in the development of B-1 B cells was whether they
constituted a separate developmental lineage, or whether they
derived from the same progenitors as B-2 B cells. This controversy has since been resolved in favor of the assertion that B-1
and B-2 B cells derive from distinct lineages of progenitor
cells. Several lines of evidence support this conjecture:
• B-1 B cells appear before B-2 B cells during ontogenic
development. B cells generated from the AGM region and
the liver in the fetus have a cell-surface phenotype characteristic of B-1 B cells and secrete natural IgM antibodies
without the need for deliberate immunization. B-1 B cells
may be generated early in development in order to protect
the fetus from commonly encountered bacterial pathogens.
• B-1 B cells display much more limited V region diversity
than B-2 B cells. Generated at a point in ontogeny before
TdT can be efficiently activated, many B-1 cells lack any
evidence of N region addition.
• B-1 B cells populate different anatomical niches in the
mouse than the later-arising B-2 B cells, in much the
same manner that has been described for the fetally
derived ␥␦ T cells (Chapter 9).
• B-cell progenitors of the CD19⫹CD45Rlow/⫺ phenotype
transferred into an immunodeficient mouse were able to
repopulate the B-1, but not the B-2 B-cell compartments.
Conversely, CD19⫹CD45Rhi B-cell progenitors gave rise to
B-2, but not to B-1, daughter cells in an immunodeficient
recipient mouse, supporting the notion that the two subclasses derive from different lineages of progenitor cells.
• Whereas B-2 B cells must be constantly replenished by
the emergence of newly generated cells from the bone
marrow, B-1 B cells are constantly regenerated in the
periphery of the animal. Bone marrow ablation therefore
leaves the mouse with a depleted B-2 pool, but with a
fully functional B-1 population.
There are very few absolutes in biology, and so it should
be clearly stated that it is probable that not all B-1 B cells in
an adult animal are derived from fetal liver precursors and
that some replenishment of B-1 precursors occurs in the
adult bone marrow. Not all B-1 B cells are restricted to IgM
production, and the antibody production of some B-1 B cells
does benefit from the provision of T-cell help. But notwithstanding these variations on the general themes we have
elaborated, it remains the case that evidence clearly supports

the notion that B-1 B cells are derived from a different progenitor cell lineage from B-2 B cells.

Marginal-Zone Cells Share Phenotypic and
Functional Characteristics with B-1 B Cells and
Arise at the T2 Stage
The term marginal zone refers to the fact that marginal zone
(MZ) B cells are located in the outer regions of the white pulp
of the spleen (Figure 10-13). The spreading out of the fastmoving arterial flow into the marginal sinuses results in a
decrease in the rate of blood flow and allows blood-borne
antigens to interact with cells resident within the marginal
zone. Indeed, MZ B cells appear to be specialized for recognizing blood-borne antigens. They are capable of responding
to both protein and carbohydrate antigens, and evidence
suggests that some, but maybe not all, MZ B cells can do so
without the need for help from T cells.
MZ cells are characterized by relatively high levels of
membrane IgM, and the complement receptor/B-cell coreceptor CD21 (see Chapters 3 and 6), but low levels of
membrane IgD and the Fc receptor CD23. They also display
phospholipid receptors and adhesion molecules that enable
them to make adhesive interactions with other cells within
the marginal zone that hold them in place. MZ cells are long
lived and may self-renew in the periphery.
What drives an immature B cell down the MZ pathway?
Phenotypic characterization of bone marrow and peripheral
immature B-cell populations, combined with labeling studies
that define precursor/daughter-cell relationships have suggested that MZ and follicular B-2 B cells both derive from the
T2 transitional population (see Figure 10-9). MZ cells, like
B-2 B cells, are also reliant on the B-cell survival factor BAFF,
which binds to the MZ B cells through the receptor BR3. Like
developing B-1 B cells, developing MZ cells appear to require
relatively strong signaling through the BCR in order to survive. Surprisingly, unlike any other B-cell subset so far
described, the differentiation of MZ B cells also requires signaling through ligands of the Notch pathway (see Chapter 9).
Loss of the Notch 2 receptor or deletion of the Notch 2 ligand,
Delta-like 1 (Dl-1), results in the selective deletion of MZ B
cells. Both MZ and B-1 B cell populations are enriched in cells
that express self antigen-specific receptors, and so relatively
strong signaling of T2 cells by binding of self antigens through
the BCR is also necessary for MZ B-cell differentiation.

Comparison of B- and T-Cell
Development
In closing this chapter, it is instructive to consider the many
points of comparison between the development of the two
arms of the adaptive immune system, B cells and T cells
(Table 10-5). Both cell lineages have their beginnings in the
fetus and the neonate. In the neonate, ␥␦ T cells and B-1 B
cells are dispatched to their own particular peripheral niches,

there to function as self-renewing populations until the death
of the host. In the adult animal, B-cell and T-cell development continue in the bone marrow, starting with hematopoietic stem cells. B and T cells share the early phases of their
developmental programs, as they pass through progressively
more differentiated stages as MPPs, LMPPs, and ELPs. At the
ELP and CLP stages, T-cell progenitors leave the bone marrow, and migrate to the thymus to complete their development, leaving B-cell progenitors behind. In mammals, B cells
do not have an organ analogous to the thymus in which to
develop into mature, functioning cells, although birds do
possess such an organ—the bursa of Fabricius. (Many students are unaware that it is from this organ, and not from the
bone marrow, that the “B” in B cells originates.)
With the initiation of V(D)J recombination, the B cell
irreversibly commits to its lineage, and begins the process of
receptor rearrangement, followed by B-cell selection and differentiation that will culminate in the formation of a complete repertoire of functioning peripheral B cells.

B cells and T cells must both pass through stages of positive selection, in which those cells capable of receiving survival signals are retained at the expense of those which
cannot. They must also survive the process of negative selection, in which lymphocytes with high affinity for self antigens are deleted. The process of positive selection in B
cells—its mechanism, and the BCR ligands involved—
remains one of the least well characterized processes in
B-cell development. Unlike T cells, however, B cells do not
undergo selection with respect to their ability to bind to self
MHC antigens.
With the expression of high levels of IgD on the cell surface and the necessary adhesion molecules to direct their
recirculation, development of the mature, follicular B-2 cell
is complete and, for a few weeks to months, it will recirculate, ready for antigen contact in the context of T-cell help
and subsequent differentiation to antibody production. For
the final, antigen-stimulated stages of B-cell differentiation,
the reader is directed to Chapter 12.

Hematopoiesis in the embryo generates rapidly dividing
hematopoietic stem cells that populate the blood system of
the animal, providing red blood cells that supply the oxygen needs of the fetus, and generating the early precursors
of other blood-cell lineages. Early sites of blood-cell development include the yolk sac and the placenta, as well as
the aorta-gonad-metanephros (AGM) region and the fetal
liver.
The earliest B-cell progenitors in the fetal liver supply B-1
B cells that migrate into the pleural and peritoneal cavities and remain self-renewing throughout the life of the
animal.
In adult animals, hematopoiesis occurs in the bone marrow.
Progenitor stages of the conventional B-2 subset are
defined by the presence of particular cell-surface markers,
which include chemokine and lymphokine receptors and
proteins involved in adhesive interactions.
Progenitor stages are also defined by the status of immunoglobulin V region gene rearrangements. The heavychain V genes rearrange first, with D to JH recombination
occurring initially, followed by VH to DJH recombination.
The heavy chain is then expressed on the cell surface in
combination with the surrogate light chain, which is made
up of VpreB and ␭5. Together they form the pre-B-cell
receptor, which is expressed on the cell surface along with
the Ig␣,Ig␤ signaling complex.
Signaling through the B-cell receptor stops VH gene rearrangement and calls for a few rounds of cell division. This
allows multiple B cells to use the same, successfully rear-

ranged heavy chain in combination with many different
light chains.
■

After light-chain rearrangement, and the expression of the
completed immunoglobulin receptor on the cell surface,
immature B cells specific for self antigens present in the
bone marrow are deleted by apoptosis.

■

Immature B cells emerge from the bone marrow as transitional 1 (T1) B cells and circulate to the spleen. Interaction
with self antigens in the spleen can give rise to apoptosis.

■

T1 B-2 B cells then enter the follicles, where the level of
IgD expression increases, they become T2 cells, and then
mature into either a follicular B-2 cell (a conventional B
cell) or a marginal-zone (MZ) B cell.

■

The three major subsets of B cells differ according to their
site of generation, their sites of maturation, their anatomical niches in the adult, the antigens to the which they
respond, their need for T-cell help in antibody production,
the diversity of their immunoglobulin repertoires, and
their abilities to undergo somatic hypermutation and
memory generation following antigenic stimulation.

■

Like T cells, developing B cells must undergo both positive
and negative selection. Unlike T cells, B cells need not be
selected for their ability to recognize antigens in the context of MHC antigens, nor is there a primary immune
organ aside from the bone marrow specialized for their
maturation. There is no equivalent of the AIRE protein
that has yet been discovered to provide for ectopic expression of antigens in the bone marrow in order to facilitate
clonal deletion of self antigen-specific B cells.

Adaptive Immunity: Development

Q U E S T I O N S

1. You wish to study the development of B-1 B cells in the

absence of the other two major B-cell subsets. You have a
recipient Rag1⫺/⫺ mouse that you have already repopulated with T cells. What would you choose to be your
source of B-1 progenitors and why? Which anatomical sites
would you expect to harvest the B-1 B cells from?

(b)

2. Describe the phenotypic and functional differences

between T1 and T2 immature B cells.
3. Following expression of the pre-B-cell receptor on the pro-

genitor B-cell surface, the B cell undergoes a few rounds of
cell division. What purpose does this round of division
serve in the development of the B-cell repertoire?
4. Immature B cells bearing potentially autoimmune recep-

tors can be managed in three ways to minimize the probability of disease. Describe these three strategies, noting
whether they are shared by T-cell progenitors.
5. You suspect that a new transcription factor is expressed at

the pre-pro-B-cell stage of development. How would you
test your hypothesis? What is the status of heavy-and lightchain rearrangement at this stage of development and how
would you test it?
6. How would you determine whether a particular stage of

B-cell development occurs in association with a stromal
cell that expresses CXCL12?
7. Describe the order in which B-cell receptor genes undergo

rearrangement, indicating at what steps you might expect
to see the B cell express one or both chains on the cell surface. In what sense(s) does this gene rearrangement process mimic the analogous progression in ␣␤ T cells, and in
what ways do the two processes differ?
ANALYZE THE DATA The two columns of data in the following

figure below are flow cytometric plots that describe the levels of
the antigens denoted on the x and y axes. The left column represents the antigens present on spleen (part A) and bone marrow (parts B) from wild-type (genetically normal) animals. The
plots represent all lymphocytes in the spleen (part A) or B-cell
progenitor and precursor cells in the bone marrow (part B).
The right column shows the same plots from animals in which
the Dicer gene has been knocked out. As you recall, the Dicer
gene is required for the maturation of controlling miRNAs.
a. For each pair of plots, describe the differences in the cell

populations, indicating whether the differences reflect
losses or gains in particular developing B-cell populations.
b. At what point(s) in B-cell development do you think
miRNAs are functioning?

T-Cell Activation,
Differentiation,
and Memory

T

he interaction between a naïve T cell and an
antigen-presenting cell (APC) is the initiating
event of the adaptive immune response. Prior to
this, the innate immune system has been alerted
at the site of infection or tissue damage, and APCs,
typically dendritic cells, have been activated via their
pattern recognition receptors. These cells may have
engulfed extracellular (or opsonized intracellular)
pathogens, or they may have been infected by an
intracellular pathogen. In either case, they have
processed and presented peptides from these pathogens
in complex with surface MHC class I and class II
molecules, and have made their way to a local (draining)
lymph node and/or the spleen. The APCs have taken up
residence in the T-cell zones of the lymph node or
spleen to join networks of other cells that are continually
scanned by roving naïve CD8 and CD4 T cells, which
recognize MHC class I-peptide and MHC class IIpeptide complexes, respectively.
We have seen that each mature T cell expresses a
unique antigen receptor that has been assembled via
random gene rearrangement during T-cell development
in the thymus (Chapter 9). Because developing T cells
undergo selection events within the thymus, each mature,
naïve T cell is tolerant to self antigens, and restricted to
self-MHC (Chapter 9). Some naïve T cells have
committed to the CD8 cytotoxic T-cell lineage, some to
the CD4 helper T-cell lineage. When a naïve CD8 or
CD4 T cell binds tightly to an MHC-peptide complex
expressed by an activated dendritic cell, it becomes
activated by signals generated through the TCR (see
Chapter 3). These signals, in concert with signals from
other factors that we will describe below, stimulate the T
cell to proliferate and differentiate into an effector cell.
As you know, naïve CD8 T cells become cytotoxic
cells in response to engagement of MHC class I-peptide
combinations. Although we refer to the activation of
CD8 T cells in this chapter, we will discuss their effector
functions in detail in Chapter 13. Naïve CD4 T cells
become helper cells in response to engagement of MHC
class II-peptide combinations (Overview Figure 11-1).

T-Cell Memory

This chapter focuses on this event, which is critical for the
development of both humoral and cell-mediated
immunity, as well as the development of B-cell and CD8
T-cell memory. As discussed below, CD4 T cells can
differentiate into a surprising number of distinct helper
subsets, each of which has a different function in
combating infection.
In this chapter, we briefly review the cellular and
molecular events that activate T cells and then deepen
your understanding of the costimulatory interactions that
play an important role in determining the outcome of
T cell-APC interactions. We then discuss the outcomes of
naïve T-cell activation—the development of effector and
memory T cells—focusing primarily on the different fates
and functions of the CD4 helper T-cell subsets that drive
the adaptive response.
Which helper subset a naïve CD4 T cell becomes
depends on the types of signals (e.g., cytokines,
costimulatory signals) they receive from the dendritic
cells they engage via their TCRs. And as described in
Chapter 5, the signals dendritic cells are able to deliver
depend in large part on the pathogen to which they have
been exposed (see Figure 5-18). Investigators are still
working to understand all the variables involved in
determining the lineage choices of T helper cells, but we
introduce you to the current thinking.

Activation of a naïve T cell in a secondary lymphoid organ results in
the generation of effector and memory T cells. Activation requires
several receptor-ligand interactions between the T cell and a dendritic cell, as well as signals through cytokines produced by the

We also describe the known functions of the
specialized helper cells, focusing on TH1, TH2, TH17, TFH,
and TREG cells. Finally, we close the chapter with a
discussion of T-cell memory, which is dependent on
CD4 T cell help, and describe both what is known and
what is currently under investigation.
A Classic Experiment box and Clinical Focus box are
offered as a pair and describe the basic research behind
the discovery of the costimulatory molecule CD28, an
essential participant in naïve T-cell activation, and then
the development of a molecular therapy for autoimmune
diseases that takes advantage of what we know about the
biology of costimulation. These boxes, together, illustrate
the powerful connections between basic research and
clinical development, which underlie translational
research, an effort to bring bench scientific discovery to
the “bedside” that has captured the imagination of many
biomedical investigators.

activating APC, as well as other supportive cells in the lymphoid
organ. Effector CD4 T cells become helper T cells (TH) and secrete
cytokines that enhance the activity of many other immune cells.
Effector CD8 T cells are cytotoxic cells (TC) that kill infected cells.

The Advances box describes a more recent effort to
figure out precisely how many T-cell receptors must be
engaged to initiate T-cell activation. The answer was
initially surprising, yet in hindsight may not be surprising
at all. The final Clinical Focus box discusses how a
disease, an “experiment of nature,” has helped us to better
understand the basic biology and physiological function
of the effector cells introduced in this chapter.

T-Cell Activation and
the Two-Signal Hypothesis
CD4 and CD8 T cells leave the thymus and enter the circulation as resting cells in the G0 stage of the cell cycle. These
naïve T cells are mature, but they have not yet encountered
antigen. Their chromatin is condensed, they have very little
cytoplasm, and they exhibit little transcriptional activity.

T-Cell Activation, Differentiation, and Memory
However, they are mobile cells and recirculate continually
among the blood, lymph, and secondary lymphoid tissues,
including lymph nodes, browsing for antigen. It is estimated
that each naïve T cell recirculates from blood through lymph
nodes and back again every 12 to 24 hours. Because only
about 1 in 105 naïve T cells is likely to be specific for any
given antigen, this large-scale recirculation increases the
chances that a T cell will encounter appropriate antigen.
If a naïve T cell does not bind any of the MHC-peptide
complexes encountered as it browses the surfaces of stromal
cells of a lymph node, it exits through the efferent lymphatics,
ultimately draining into the thoracic duct and rejoining the
blood (see Chapter 2). However, if a naïve T cell does encounter an APC expressing an MHC-peptide to which it can bind,
it will initiate an activation program that produces a diverse
array of cells that orchestrate efforts to clear infection.
Recall from Chapter 3 that a successful T cell-APC interaction results in the stable organization of signaling molecules into an immune synapse (Figure 11-2). The TCR/
MHC-peptide complexes and coreceptors are aggregated in
the central part of this synapse (central supramolecular activating complex, or cSMAC). The intrinsic affinity between
the TCR and MHC-peptide surfaces is quite low (Kd ranges
from 104 M to 107 M) and is stabilized by the activity of
several molecules which together increase the avidity (the
combined affinity of all cell-cell interactions) of the cellular
interaction. The coreceptors CD4 and CD8, which are found
in the cSMAC, stabilize the interaction between TCR and
MHC by binding MHC class II and MHC class I molecules,
respectively. Interactions between adhesion molecules and
their ligands (e.g., LFA-1/ICAM-1 and CD2/LFA-3) help to
sustain the signals generated by allowing long-term cell
interactions. These molecules are organized around the central aggregate, forming the peripheral or “p” SMAC.
However, even the increased functional avidity offered by
coreceptors and adhesion molecules is still not sufficient to
fully activate a T cell. Interactions between costimulatory
receptors on T cells (e.g., CD28) and costimulatory ligands
on dendritic cells (e.g., CD80/86) provide a second, required
signal. In addition, as you will see below, a third set of signals, provided by local cytokines (Signal 3), directs T-cell
differentiation into distinct effector cell types.

Costimulatory Signals Are Required for
Optimal T-Cell Activation and Proliferation
What evidence pointed to a requirement for a second, costimulatory signal? In 1987, Helen Quill and Ron Schwartz recognized that, in the absence of functional APCs, isolated high
affinity TCR-MHC interactions actually led to T-cell nonresponsiveness rather than activation—a phenomenon they
called T-cell anergy. Their studies led to the simple but powerful notion that not one but two signals were required for full
T-cell activation: Signal 1 is provided by antigen-specific TCR
engagement (which can be enhanced by coreceptors and
adhesion molecules), and Signal 2 is provided by contact with

a costimulatory ligand, which can only be expressed by a functional APC. When a T cell receives both Signal 1 and Signal 2,
it will be activated to produce cytokines that enhance entry
into cell cycle and proliferation (Figure 11-3).
It is now known that Signal 2 results from an interaction
between specific costimulatory receptors on T cells and
costimulatory ligands on dendritic cells (Table 11-1). Recall
from Chapter 5 that dendritic cells and other APCs become
activated by antigen binding to PRRs, to express costimulatory ligands (e.g., CD80 and CD86) and produce cytokines
that enhance their ability to activate T cells. CD28 is the
most commonly cited example of a costimulatory receptor,
but other related molecules that provide costimulatory signals during T-cell activation have since been identified and
are also described below. Because these molecules enhance
TCR signaling, they are collectively referred to as “positive”
costimulatory receptors and ligands.
Negative costimulatory receptors, which inhibit TCR
signaling, have also been identified. Although our understanding of their specific functions is incomplete, as a group
these play important roles in (1) maintaining peripheral T-cell
tolerance and (2) reducing inflammation both after the natural course of an infection and during responses to chronic
infection. As you can imagine, the expression and activity of
negative and positive costimulatory molecules must be carefully regulated temporally and spatially. Naïve T cells, for
example, do not express negative costimulatory receptors,
allowing them to be activated in secondary lymphoid tissue
during the initiation of an immune response. On the other
hand, effector T cells up-regulate negative costimulatory
receptors at the end of an immune response, when proliferation is no longer advantageous. However, these generalizations belie the complexity of regulation of this highly important
costimulatory network, and investigators are still working to
understand the details. Below we introduce aspects of the
structure, function, expression, and, when known, regulation
of several positive and negative costimulators.
Positive Costimulatory Receptors: CD28
CD28, a 44 kDa glycoprotein expressed as a homodimer, was
the first costimulatory molecule to be discovered (see Classic
Experiment Box 11-1). Expressed by all naïve and activated
human and murine CD4 T cells, all murine CD8 T cells,
and, interestingly, only 50% of human CD8 T cells, it markedly enhances TCR-induced proliferation and survival by
cooperating with T-cell receptor signals to induce expression
of the pro-proliferative cytokine IL-2 and the prosurvival
bcl-2 family member, bcl-xL.
CD28 binds to two distinct ligands of the B7 family of
proteins: CD80 (B7-1) and CD86 (B7-2). These are members
of the immunoglobulin superfamily, which have similar
extracellular domains. Interestingly, their intracellular
regions differ, suggesting that they might not simply act as
passive ligands; rather, they may have the ability to generate
signals that influence the APC, a view that has some experimental support.

signal transduction cascade that results in activation of transcription
factors and cytokines (Signal 3) that direct T-cell proliferation (IL-2)
and differentiation (polarizing cytokines). Cytokines can act in an autocrine manner, by stimulating the same cells that produce them, or
in a paracrine manner, by stimulating neighboring cells.

Although most T cells express CD28, most cells in the
body do not express its ligands. In fact, only professional
APCs have the capacity to express CD80/86. Mature dendritic cells, the best activator of naïve T cells, appear to con-

stitutively express CD80/86, and macrophages and B cells
have the capacity to up-regulate CD80/86 after they are activated by an encounter with pathogen (see Chapter 5).
Positive Costimulatory Receptors: ICOS
Since the discovery of CD28, several other structurally
related receptors have been identified. Like CD28, the closely
related inducible costimulator (ICOS) provides positive
costimulation for T-cell activation. However, rather than
binding CD80 and CD86, ICOS binds to another member of
the growing B7 family, ICOS-ligand (ICOS-L), which is also
expressed on a subset of activated APCs.
Differences in patterns of expression of CD28 and ICOS
indicate that these positive costimulatory molecules play
distinct roles in T-cell activation. Unlike CD28, ICOS is not
expressed on naïve T cells; rather, it is expressed on memory
and effector T cells. Investigations suggest that CD28 plays a
key costimulatory role during the initiation of activation and
ICOS plays a key role in maintaining the activity of already
differentiated effector and memory T cells.
Negative Costimulatory Receptors: CTLA-4
The discovery of CTLA-4 (CD152), the second member of
the CD28 family to be identified, caused a stir. Although
closely related in structure to CD28 and also capable of binding both CD80 and CD86, CTLA-4 did not act as a positive
costimulator. Instead, it antagonized T-cell activating signals
and is now referred to as a negative costimulatory receptor.
CTLA-4 is not expressed constitutively on resting T cells.
Rather, it is induced within 24 hours after activation of a

Adaptive Immunity: Effector Responses

CLASSIC EXPERIMENT

Discovery of the First Costimulatory Receptor: CD28
In 1989, Navy immunologist Carl June
took the first step toward filling (and
revealing) the considerable gaps in our
understanding of T-cell proliferation and
activation by introducing a new actor:
CD28. CD28 had been recently identified
as a dimeric glycoprotein expressed on all
human CD4 T cells and half of human
CD8 T cells, and preliminary data suggested that it enhanced T-cell activation.
June and his colleagues specifically wondered if CD28 might be related to the
Signal 2 that was known to be provided
by APCs (sometimes referred to as “accessory cells” in older literature).
June and his colleagues isolated T cells
from human blood by density gradient
centrifugation and by depleting a T-cellenriched population of cells that did not
express CD28 (negative selection). They
then measured the response of these
CD28 T cells to TCR stimulation in the
presence or absence of CD28 engagement (Figure 1a).
To mimic the TCR-MHC interaction,
June and colleagues used either monoclonal antibodies to the CD3 complex or

the mitogen phorbol myristyl acetate
(PMA), a protein kinase C (PKC) activator.
To engage the CD28 molecule, they used
an anti-CD28 monoclonal antibody. They
included two negative controls: one population that was cultured in growth
medium with no additives and another
population that was exposed to phytohaemagglutinin (PHA), which was known
to activate T cells only in the presence of
APCs. This last control was clever and
would be used to demonstrate that the
researchers’ isolated populations were not
contaminated with APCs, which would
express their own sets of ligands and confound interpretation.
June and colleagues measured the
proliferation of each of these populations
by measuring incorporation of a radioactive (tritiated) nucleotide, [3H]Uridine,
which is incorporated by cells that are
synthesizing new RNA (and, hence, are
showing signs of activation). Their results
were striking, particularly when responses
to PMA were examined (Figure 1b). As
expected, T cells grown without stimulation or with incomplete stimulation (PHA)

naïve T cell and peaks in expression within 2 to 3 days poststimulation. Peak surface levels of CTLA-4 are lower than
peak CD28 levels, but because it binds CD80 and CD86 with
markedly higher affinity, CTLA-4 competes very favorably
with CD28. Interestingly, CTLA-4 expression levels increase
in proportion to the amount of CD28 costimulation, suggesting that CTLA-4 acts to “put the brakes on” the proproliferative influence of TCR-CD28 engagement. The
importance of this inhibitory function is underscored by the
phenotype of CTLA-4 knockout mice, whose T cells proliferate without control, leading to lymphadenopathy (greatly
enlarged lymph nodes), splenomegaly (enlarged spleen),
autoimmunity, and death within 3 to 4 weeks after birth.
Negative Costimulatory Receptors: PD-1 and BTLA
PD-1 (CD279) and B and T lymphocyte attenuator (BTLA
(CD272)) are relatively new additions to our list of negative
costimulatory receptors. Although more distantly related to
CD28 family members than CTLA-4, they also inhibit TCRmediated T-cell activation. program death-1 (PD-1) is
expressed by both B and T cells and binds to two ligands,

remained quiescent, exhibiting no nucleotide uptake. Cell groups treated with
stimuli that were known to cause T-cell
proliferation—anti-CD3 and PMA—
showed evidence of activation, with CD3
engagement producing relatively more of
a response than PMA at the time points
examined.
The cells treated with anti-CD28 only
were just as quiescent as the negative
control samples, indicating that engagement of CD28, alone, could not induce
activation. However, when CD28 was
engaged at the same time cells were
exposed to PMA, incorporation of [3H]Uridine increased markedly. T cells cotreated
with anti-CD28 and anti-CD3 also took up
more [3H]Uridine than those treated with
anti-CD3 alone.
What new RNA were these cells producing? Using Northern blot analysis and
functional assays (bioassays) to characterize the cytokines in culture supernatant of
the stimulated cells, June and colleagues
went on to show that CD28 stimulation
induced anti-CD3 stimulated T cells to
produce higher levels of cytokines

PD-L1 (B7-H1) and PD-L2 (B7-DC), which are also members of the CD80/86 family. PD-L2 is expressed predominantly on APCs; however, PD-L1 is expressed more broadly
and may help to mediate T-cell tolerance in nonlymphoid
tissues. Recent data suggest that PD-L1/PD-L1/2 interactions
regulate the differentiation of regulatory T cells.
BTLA is more broadly expressed: not only has it been
found on conventional TH cells, as well as  T cells and
regulatory T cells, but it is also expressed on NK cells, some
macrophages and dendritic cells, and most highly on B cells.
Interestingly, BTLA’s primary ligand appears not to be a B7
family member, but a TNF receptor family member known
as herpesvirus-entry mediator (HVEM), which is also
expressed on many cell types. Studies on the role of this
interesting costimulatory receptor-ligand pair are ongoing,
but there are indications that BTLA-HVEM interactions also
play a role in down-regulating inflammatory and autoimmune responses.
As the genome continues to be explored, additional
costimulatory molecules—both negative and positive in
influence—are likely to be identified. Understanding their

involved in antiviral, anti-tumor, and proliferative activity, generating an increase in
T-cell immune response.
When this paper was published, June
did not know the identity of the natural
ligand for CD28, or even if the homodimer could be activated in a natural
immune context. We now know that
CD28 binds to CD80/86 (B7), providing

the critical Signal 2 during naïve T-cell
activation, a signal required for optimal
up-regulation of IL-2 and the IL-2 receptor. Finding this second switch capable of
modulating T-cell activation was only the
beginning of a landslide of discoveries of
additional costimulatory signals—positive and negative—involved in T-cell activation, and the recognition that T cells are

regulation and function will continue to occupy the attention of the immunological community and has already provided the clinical community with new tools for manipulating
the immune response during transplantation and disease
(see Clinical Focus Box 11-2).

Clonal Anergy Results if a Costimulatory
Signal Is Absent
Experiments with cultured cells show that if a resting T cell’s
TCR is engaged (Signal 1) in the absence of a suitable
costimulatory signal (Signal 2), that T cell will become unresponsive to subsequent stimulation, a state referred to as
anergy. There is good evidence that both CD4 and CD8 T
cells can be anergized, but most studies of anergy have been
conducted with CD4 TH cells.
Anergy can be demonstrated in vitro with systems
designed to engage the TCR in the absence of costimulatory
molecule engagement. For instance, T cells specific for a
MHC-peptide complex can be induced to proliferate in vitro
by incubation with activated APCs that express both the

appropriate MHC-peptide combination and CD80/86. However, glutaraldehyde-fixed APCs, which express MHC class
II-peptide complexes, but cannot be induced to express
CD80/86, render T cells unresponsive (Figure 11-4a). These
anergic T cells are no longer able to secrete cytokines or
proliferate in response to subsequent stimulation (Figure
11-4b). T-cell anergy can also be induced in vitro by incubating T cells with normal, CD80/86-expressing APCs in the
presence of the Fab portion of anti-CD28, which blocks the
interaction of CD28 with CD80/86 (Figure 11-4c).
In vivo, the requirement for costimulatory ligands to
fully activate a T cell decreases the probability that circulating autoreactive T cells will be activated and become dangerous. For instance, a naïve T cell expressing a T-cell
receptor specific for an MHC class I insulin-peptide complex would be rendered nonresponsive if it encountered a
-islet cell expressing this MHC class I-peptide complex.
Why? -islet cells cannot be induced to express costimulatory ligands, and the encounter would result in T-cell
anergy, preventing an immune attack on these insulinproducing cells.

Adaptive Immunity: Effector Responses

BOX 11-2

CLINICAL FOCUS

Costimulatory Blockade
Taking an idea from the research
setting to a therapeutic reality—from
“bench to bedside”—is a dream for many,
but a reality for few. Immunologists recognized the therapeutic promise of costimulatory receptors as soon as they were
discovered. Reagents that would block
these interactions could block the activation of destructive T cells, which were
known to be responsible for many autoimmune disorders and for transplantation
rejection.
Several investigators specifically recognized that soluble versions of CD28 and
CTLA-4 could be very valuable. By blocking the interaction between costimulatory receptors and their CD80/86 ligands,
soluble CD28 and CTLA-4 could inhibit
destructive T-cell responses (e.g., those
involved in autoimmune disease or transplantation rejection). Couple this idea
with technological advances in protein
design and you had a novel reagent—and
a potential drug.
In the early 1990s, at least two groups
converted human CTLA-4 into a soluble
protein by fusing the extracellular domain
of human CTLA-4 with the Fc portion of an
IgG1 antibody (Figure 1). The Fc portion
enhances (1) the ability to manipulate a
protein during production by taking
advantage of Fc binding as well as (2) the
distribution of the reagent in an organism
(the Fc portion confers some of the antibodies’ tissue distribution behaviors). The
Fc portion is modified so that it does not

bind to Fc receptors and cause unintended
cytotoxicity. Using this new protein, Peter
Linsley et al. found that their soluble CTLA4-Ig bound CD80/86 with higher affinity
than CD28-Ig, and could therefore more
potently block costimulation.
The development of CTLA-4 Ig as a
drug did not proceed without difficulty.
Originally designed and tested as a treatment for T-cell-mediated transplantation
rejection, it did not originally perform as
well as expected. However, hope in its
utility was revived when it showed significant promise as a treatment for rheumatoid arthritis. The marketing of CTLA-4 Ig
was not without controversy, either. At
least two groups claimed patent rights,
and communication between companies

Interactions between negative costimulatory receptors
and ligands can also induce anergy. This phenomenon,
which would typically only apply to activated T cells that
have up-regulated negative costimulatory receptors, could
help curb T-cell proliferation when antigen is cleared.
Unfortunately, negative costimulation may also contribute to
the T cell “exhaustion” during chronic infection, such as that
caused by mycobacteria, HIV, hepatitis virus, and more. T
cells specific for these pathogens express high levels of PD-1
and BTLA, and are functionally anergic. Some recent therapies, in fact, are designed to block this interaction and allow
T cells to reactivate.

and basic researchers was not always
smooth.
In late 2005, the FDA approved the use
of CTLA-4 Ig (abatacept) for rheumatoid
arthritis (RA). As of 2012 it is marketed as
Orencia by Bristol Meyers Squibb, which
shares patent royalties with Repligen Corporation. Abatacept shows promise in
delaying the joint damage seen with RA,
and clinical trials are also underway to
evaluate its potential to ameliorate psoriasis, lupus, Type 1 diabetes, and more.
This true bench-to-bedside story is still
not finished and continues to be informed
by basic researchers’ growing knowledge
of the complexities of costimulation.
Investigators have already developed a
modified version of CTLA-4 Ig that differs
in two amino acids in the CD80/86 binding region and exhibits a higher affinity for
CD86, which may play a more important
role in transplantation rejection. This drug
is also showing promise in clinical trials
and may result in fewer side effects than
standard immunosuppressant therapies
(e.g., cyclosporine), which are not specific
for T cells. It is also important to recognize
that CTLA-4 Ig not only blocks positive
costimulatory reactions, but also has the
potential to inhibit negative ones and in
some circumstances could lead to
enhancement of T-cell activity. Researchers will continue to draw from basic and
clinical knowledge to determine how best
to use the drug and to improve its design
for enhanced safety and efficacy.

Although anergy is a well-established phenomenon, the
precise biochemical pathways that regulate this state of nonresponsiveness are still not fully understood. During the past few
years, microarray analyses (see Chapter 20) have identified
several key enzymes expressed by anergic T cells, including
ubiquitin ligases that appear to target key components of the
TCR signaling pathway for degradation by the proteasome.

Cytokines Provide Signal 3
We have now seen that naïve T cells will initiate activation
when they are costimulated by engagement with both

As we will see below, Signal 3 is also supplied by other
cytokines (produced by APCs, T cells, NK cells, and others),
known as polarizing cytokines, that play central roles not just
in enhancing proliferation, but also in determining what
types of effector cells naïve T cells will become.

MHC-peptide complexes and costimulatory ligands on
dendritic cells. However, the consequences and extent of
T-cell activation are also critically shaped by the activity of
soluble cytokines produced by both APCs and T cells. These
assisting cytokines are referred to, by some, as Signal 3 (see
Figure 11-3).
Cytokines bind surface cytokine receptors, stimulating a
cascade of intracellular signals that can enhance both proliferation and/or survival (see Chapter 4). IL-2 is one of the
best-known cytokines involved in T-cell activation and plays
a key role in inducing optimal T-cell proliferation, particularly when antigen and/or costimulatory ligands are limiting.
Costimulatory signals induce transcription of genes for both
IL-2 and the  chain (CD25) of the high-affinity IL-2 receptor. Signals also enhance the stability of the IL-2 mRNA. The
combined increase in IL-2 transcription and improved IL-2
mRNA stability results in a 100-fold increase in IL-2 production by the activated T cell. Secretion of IL-2 and its subsequent binding to the high-affinity IL-2 receptor induces
activated naïve T cells to proliferate vigorously.

Which cells are capable of providing both Signal 1 and Signal
2 to a naïve T cell? Although almost all cells in the body
express MHC class I, only professional APCs—dendritic
cells, activated macrophages, and activated B cells—express
the high levels of class II MHC molecules that are required
for T-cell activation. Importantly, these same professional
APCs are among the only two cell types capable of expressing costimulatory ligands. (The only other cell type known
to have this capacity is the thymic epithelial cell; see Chapter
9.) Professional APCs are more diverse in function and origin than originally imagined, and each subpopulation differs
both in the ability to display antigen and in the expression of
costimulatory ligands (Figure 11-5).
In the early stages of an immune response in secondary
lymphoid organs, T cells encounter two main types of
professional APCs: the dendritic cell and the activated B
cell. Mature dendritic cells that have been activated by
microbial components via their pattern recognition
receptors (PRRs) are present throughout the T-cell zones.
They express antigenic peptides in complex with high
levels of MHC class I and II molecules. They also express
costimulatory ligands and are the most potent activators
of naïve CD4 and CD8 T cells.
Resting B cells residing in the follicles gain the capacity to
activate T cells after they bind antigen through their B-cell
receptor (BCR). This engagement stimulates the up-regulation
of MHC class II and costimulatory CD80/86, allowing the
B cell to present antigen to CD4 T cells they encounter at
the border between the follicle and T-cell zone. Because of
their unique ability to internalize antigen (e.g., pathogens) via
specific BCRs and present them in MHC class II, B cells are
most efficient at activating CD4 T cells that are specific for
the same pathogen for which they are specific. This situation
serves the immune response very well, focusing the attention
of antigen-specific CD4 T cells activated in the T-cell zone on
B cells activated by the same antigen in the neighboring follicle.
The pairing of B cells with their helper T cells occurs at the
junction between the B- and T-cell zones (see Chapter 14) and
allows T cells to deliver the help required for B-cell proliferation, differentiation, and memory generation (see Chapter 12).
Macrophages are also found in secondary lymphoid organs,
but can activate T cells in a wide range of other peripheral
tissues. They also must be activated to reveal their full antigenpresenting capacity. They up-regulate MHC molecules and
costimulatory ligands in response to interactions with pathogens, as well as in response to cytokines produced by other
cells, including IFN-.

FIGURE 11-5 Differences in the properties of professional
antigen-presenting cells that induce T-cell activation. This figure describes general features of three major classes of professional
APCs. Dendritic cells are the best activators of naïve T cells. This may
be due, in part, to relatively high levels of expression of MHC and costimulatory molecules when they are mature and activated. Activated B cells interact most efficiently with differentiated TH cells that are
specific for the same antigen that activated them. Macrophages play
several different roles, processing and distributing antigen in second-

It turns out that there are several different dendritic cell
and macrophage subtypes; however, their functions are
still being clarified. Some are likely to activate or induce
differentiation of specific effector T cells that travel to the
site of infection, and some may be involved in reactivating
memory cells that reside in tissues. Others may help to
quell, rather than to activate, responses. Full understanding awaits more research.

ary lymphoid tissues (SLOs) as well as interacting with effector cells in
the periphery. It is important to recognize that the distinctions shown
are rules of thumb only. Functions among the APC classes overlap,
and the field now recognizes different subsets within each major
group of APC, each of which may act independently on different
T-cell subsets. This diversity may be a consequence of activation by
different innate immune receptors or may reflect the existence of
independent cell lineages. Note that activation of effector and memory
T cells is not as dependent on costimulatory interactions.

Superantigens Are a Special Class
of T-Cell Activators
Superantigens are viral or bacterial proteins that bind
simultaneously to specific V regions of T-cell receptors
and to the  chain of class II MHC molecules. V regions
are encoded by over 20 different V genes in mice and 65
different genes in humans. Each superantigen displays a

expressed by up to 5% of T cells, regardless of their antigen
specificity. This clamp-like connection mimics a strong
TCR-MHC interaction and induces activation, bypassing
the need for TCR antigen specificity (Figure 11-6). Superantigen binding, however, does not bypass the need for
costimulation; professional APCs are still required for full
T-cell activation by these microbial proteins.

TABLE 11-2

|

CHAPTER 11

367

Both endogenous superantigens and exogenous superantigens have been identified. Exogenous superantigens are soluble proteins secreted by bacteria. Among them are a variety of
exotoxins secreted by Gram-positive bacteria, such as staphylococcal enterotoxins, toxic shock syndrome toxin, and exfoliative dermatitis toxin. Each of these exogenous superantigens
binds particular V sequences in T-cell receptors (Table 11-2)
and cross-links the TCR to a class II MHC molecule.
Endogenous superantigens are cell-membrane proteins
generated by specific viral genes that have integrated into
mammalian genomes. One group, encoded by mouse mammary tumor virus (MTV), a retrovirus that is integrated into
the DNA of certain inbred mouse strains, produces proteins
called minor lymphocyte-stimulating (Mls) determinants,
which bind particular V sequences in T-cell receptors and
cross-link the TCR to class II MHC molecules. Four Mls
superantigens, originating from distinct MTV strains, have
been identified.
Because superantigens bind outside the TCR antigenbinding cleft, any T cell expressing that particular V
sequence will be activated by a corresponding superantigen.
Hence, the activation is polyclonal and can result in massive
T-cell activation, resulting in overproduction of TH-cell
cytokines and systemic toxicity. Food poisoning induced by
staphylococcal enterotoxins and toxic shock induced by
toxic shock syndrome toxin are two examples of disorders
caused by superantigen-induced cytokine overproduction.
Given that superantigens result in T-cell activation and
proliferation, what adaptive value could they possibly have
for the pathogens that make them? The answer is not clear,
but there is evidence that such antigen-nonspecific T-cell

Adaptive Immunity: Effector Responses

ADVANCES

How Many TCR Complexes Must Be Engaged
to Trigger T-Cell Activation?
Until single-cell imaging techniques
were developed, indirect methods were
used to calculate how many ligands a T
cell must recognize in order to be activated. Mark Davis and colleagues at Stanford School of Medicine approached this
question using an acutely sensitive, twopart microscopic visualization technique
(Figure 1). APCs were cultured (pulsed)
briefly with peptide bound to a biotin
molecule. When APCs are exposed to
soluble peptides a small number will
exchange it with a peptide bound to an
MHC molecule on the cell surface. The
number of peptides that actually bound
to MHC could be determined in this system by adding a fluorescent (phycoerythrin) streptavidin conjugate, which
binds the biotin of the biotinylated peptide and can be detected and quantified
by fluorescent microscopy.
The response of T cells specific for the
complex could also be quantified using
another fluorescent tool: fura-2, a dye

that can enter cells and fluoresces when
intracellular calcium is released. By adding fura-2 “loaded” T cells to the APCs
bound to varying numbers of red fluorescent peptide (see Figure 1a), researchers could determine (1) if a T cell was
activated and (2) how many molecules of
peptide were present at the point of
contact between the T cell and the
APC—in other words, how many TCR/
MHC-biotinylated peptide complexes
were required to stimulate the release of
intracellular calcium.
One set of data from these experiments is illustrated in Figure 1b. An activated, fura-2-loaded T cell (blue) is shown
interacting with an APC in the upper left.
The fluorescent micrograph of the peptide at the junction of the T cell and APC is
shown in the top right image. The intensity of the red fluorescence varies with the
number of peptides bound. (The image is
“stretched” artificially because of the computer program used to quantify fluores-

activation and inflammation hampers the development of a
coordinated antigen-specific response that would most
effectively thwart infection. Some speculate that the largescale proliferation and cytokine production that occur
harm the cells and microenvironments that are required to
start a normal response; others argue that these events
induce T-cell tolerance to the pathogen.

T-Cell Differentiation
How does an interaction between a naïve T cell and a dendritic cell result in the generation of cells with effector functions? An activating, costimulatory interaction between a
naïve T cell and an APC typically lasts 6 to 8 hours, a period
that permits the development of a cascade of signaling
events (see Chapter 3) that alter gene programs and induce
differentiation into a variety of distinct effector and memory
cell subtypes. Just a few TCR-MHC interactions (as described
in Advances Box 11-3) stimulates a signaling cascade that,

cence.) The fluorescence intensity
calculated from this particular image indicated that only a single MHC-peptide
combination was at the T cell-APC synapse. The plot below these images shows
the intensity of fura-2 fluorescence (i.e.,
the increase in intracellular Ca2) over
time after T cell-APC engagement. The
initial spike is an indicator that this single
MHC-peptide could inspire robust Ca2
signals.
The investigators quantified many
interactions in this way and definitively
concluded that a single MHC-peptide
combination could stimulate significant
Ca2 release. Maximal Ca2 release was
achieved in CD4 T cells when as few as
10 TCR complexes were engaged. Similar results were obtained with CD8 T

in combination with costimulation and signals received by
soluble cytokines, culminate in the activation of “effector”
molecules that regulate (1) cell survival, (2) cell cycle entry,
and, as we shall see below, (3) cell differentiation.
In 1 to 2 days after successful engagement with a dendritic cell in the T-cell zone of a secondary lymphoid organ,

induce up-regulation of expression and activity of prosurvival genes (e.g., bcl-2), as well as the transcription of
genes for both IL-2 and the  chain (CD25) of the highaffinity IL-2 receptor (Figure 11-7). The combined effect on
a naïve T cell is activation and robust proliferation. Activated
T cells divide 2 to 3 times per day for 4 to 5 days, generating
a clone of progeny cells that differentiate into memory and
effector T-cell populations.
Activated T cells and their progeny gain unique functional abilities, becoming effector helper or cytotoxic T cells
that indirectly and directly act to clear pathogen. CD8 cytotoxic T cells leave the secondary lymphoid tissues and circulate

to sites of infection where they bind and kill infected cells.
CD4 helper T cells secrete cytokines that orchestrate the
activity of several other cell types, including B cells, macrophages, and other T cells. Some CD4+ T cells, particularly
those that “help” B cells and those that generate lymphocyte
memory, stay within secondary lymphoid tissue to continue
to regulate the generation of the response. Others return to
the sites of infection and enhance the activity of macrophages and cytotoxic cells.
Effector cells tend to be short-lived and have life spans
that range from a few days to a few weeks. However, the
progeny of an activated T cell can also become long-lived
memory T cells that reside in secondary and tertiary tissues
for significant periods of time, providing protection against
a secondary infection.
Effector T cells come in more varieties than was originally
anticipated, and each subset plays a specific and important
role in the immune response. The first effector cell distinction to be recognized was between CD8 T cells and CD4
T cells. Activated CD8 T cells acquire the ability to induce

the death of target cells, becoming “killer” or “cytotoxic” T
lymphocytes (CTL, or TC). Because cytotoxic CD8 T cells
recognize peptide bound to MHC class I, which is expressed
by almost all cells in the body, they are perfectly poised to
clear the body of cells that have been internally infected by
the pathogen that resulted in their activation. On the other
hand, activated CD4 T cells (helper T cells or TH) acquire
the ability to secrete factors that enhance the activation
and proliferation of other cells. Specifically, they regulate
activation and antibody production of B cells, enhance the
phagocytic, anti-microbial, cytolytic, and antigen-presenting
capacity of macrophages, and are required for the development of B-cell and CD8 T-cell memory.
As immunologists developed and adopted more tools to
distinguish proteins expressed and secreted by helper T cells,
it became clear that CD4 helper T cells were particularly
diverse, differentiating into several different subtypes, each
of which secretes a signature set of cytokines. The cytokines
secreted by CD4 TH cells can either act directly on the same
cell that produced them (acting in an autocrine fashion) or

can bind to receptors and act on cells in the vicinity (acting
in a paracrine fashion). Below we describe the major features
and functions of the best-characterized CD4 helper T-cell
subsets. Although CD8 cytotoxic T cells also secrete cytokines, and there are indications that CD8 T cells may also
differentiate into more than one killer subtype, the diversity
of CD8 T-cell effector functions are clearly more restricted
than those of CD4 TH cells. The generation and activity of
CTL cells are described in more detail in Chapter 13.

Helper T Cells Can Be Divided
into Distinct Subsets
Tim Mosmann, Robert Coffman, and colleagues can be credited with one of the earliest experiments definitively demonstrating that helper CD4 T cells were more heterogeneous in
phenotype and function than originally supposed. Earlier
investigations, showing that helper T cells produced a diverse

array of cytokines, hinted at this possibility. However, Mosmann and Coffman definitively identified two distinct functional subgroups, TH1 and TH2, each of which produced a
different set of cytokines. Furthermore, they showed that
these differences were properties of distinct T-cell clones:
each activated T cell expanded into a population of effector T
cells that secreted a distinct array of cytokines.
Specifically, these investigators developed over 50 individual T-cell clones from a mixture of T cells with different
receptor specificities (i.e., a polyclonal T-cell population) that
had been isolated from the spleen of an immunized mouse.
At a time when the community did not have the tools to
identify most cytokines directly, these researchers developed
clever (and elaborate) strategies to define each clone’s cytokine secretion pattern. They showed that the cytokines
secreted by each of the 50 clones fell into one of two broad
categories, which they named TH1 and TH2.
Because TH1 and TH2 subsets were originally identified
from in vitro studies of cloned T-cell lines, some researchers
doubted that they represented true in vivo subpopulations.
They suggested instead that these subsets might represent
different maturational stages of a single lineage. In addition,
the initial failure to locate either subset in humans led some
to believe that TH1, TH2, and other subsets of T helper cells
were not present in this species. Further research corrected
these views. In many in vivo systems, the full commitment
of populations of T cells to either a TH1 or TH2 phenotype
occurs late in an immune response. Hence, it was difficult to
find clear TH1 or TH2 subsets in studies employing healthy
human subjects, where these cells would not have developed.
Indeed, TH1 and TH2 populations in T cells were ultimately
isolated from humans during chronic infectious disease or
chronic episodes of allergy, and studies in humans and mice
definitively confirmed their lineage independence.
With the benefit of new tools and technology, we now
have a more detailed understanding of the panels of cytokines that each group produces. The TH1 subset secretes
IL-2, IFN-, and Lymphotoxin- (TNF-), and is responsible for many classic cell-mediated functions, including activation of cytotoxic T lymphocytes and macrophages. The
TH2 subset secretes IL-4, IL-5, IL-6, IL-9, IL-10, and IL-13,
and regulates B-cell activity and differentiation.
These experiments set the stage for the discovery over the
last decade that CD4 T cells can adopt not just two but at
least five distinct effector fates after activation. The TH1 and
TH2 subpopulations have been joined definitively by the
TH17 and TREG subpopulations, each of which produces a
distinct cytokine profile and regulates distinct activities
within the body. Yet another subpopulation, T follicular
helper cells (TFH), has recently been characterized, and has
achieved membership among the major helper subsets.
More are bound to reveal themselves, although it will be
important to determine whether each represents distinct
subgroups or variants within the major subgroups.
In retrospect, we probably should have anticipated the
heterogeneity of helper responses, which allows an organism

T-Cell Activation, Differentiation, and Memory
to “tailor” a response to a particular type of pathogen. The
type of effector TH cell that a naïve T cell (also called a TH0
cell) becomes depends largely on the kind of infection that
occurs. For example, extracellular bacterial infections result
in the differentiation of activated CD4 T cells into TH2
cells, which help to activate B cells to secrete antibodies that
can opsonize bacteria and neutralize the toxins they produce. On the other hand, infection by an intracellular virus
or bacterium induces differentiation of CD4 T cells into
TH1 helpers that enhance the cytolytic activity of macrophages and CD8 T cells, which can then kill infected cells.
Responses to fungi stimulate the differentiation of different
helper responses than responses to worms, and so on. The
reality is, of course, more complex. Infections evoke the differentiation of more than one helper subtype, some of which
have overlapping roles. What regulates the differentiation of
each effector subset and what function each subset plays are
still being actively investigated. We describe the fundamentals of our current understanding below.

The Differentiation of T Helper Cell Subsets Is
Regulated by Polarizing Cytokines
As you know, T-cell activation requires TCR and costimulatory receptor engagement, both of which are supplied by an
activated APC. It is now clear that the functional fate of activated T cells is determined by signals they receive from
additional cytokines generated during the response. These
cytokines (Signal 3) are referred to as polarizing cytokines
because they are responsible for guiding a helper T cell
toward one of several different effector fates. For example, T
cells that are activated in the presence of IL-12 and IFN-
tend to differentiate, or polarize, to the TH1 lineage, whereas
T cells that are activated in the presence of IL-4 and IL-6
polarize to the TH2 lineage.
Polarizing cytokines can be generated by the stimulating
APC itself, or by neighboring immune cells that have also
been activated by antigen. Which cytokines are produced
during an immune response depends on (1) the cell of origin
(DC, macrophage, B cell, NK cell, etc.), (2) its maturation
and activation status, (3) which pathogens and other inflammatory mediators it encounters, and (4) in what tissue environment it encounters that pathogen. Innate interactions
therefore have a critical role in shaping adaptive responses
(see Figure 5-18). Specifically, by influencing APC secretions
and the surface and the microenvironmental landscape that
a T cell encounters, innate immune responses directly influence the functional fate of helper T cells.
Recall from Chapter 5 that APCs and other innate
immune cells are activated by interaction with pathogens
bearing pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs).
These PAMPs bind PRRs, including, but not limited to Tolllike receptors (TLRs). PRR interactions activate dendritic
cells by stimulating the up-regulation of MHC and costimulatory proteins. They also determine the type of cytokine(s)
that dendritic cells and other immune cells will secrete.

FIGURE 11-8 General events and factors that drive TH
subset polarization. Interaction of pathogen with pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) on dendritic cells and other neighboring
immune cells determines which polarizing cytokines are produced
and, hence, into which T helper subset a naïve cell will differentiate. In general, polarizing cytokines that arise from dendritic cells
or other neighboring cells interact with cytokine receptors and
generate signals that induce transcription of unique master gene
regulators. These master regulators, in turn, regulate expression of
various genes, including effector cytokines, which define the function of each subset.
Hence, PRR signals regulate the fate a T cell will adopt following activation (Figure 11-8).
For example, double-stranded RNA, a product of many
viruses, binds TLR3 receptors on dendritic cells, initiating a
signaling cascade that results in production of IL-12, which
directly promotes TH1 differentiation. On the other hand,
worms stimulate PRRs on innate immune cells, including
mast cells, which generate IL-4. IL-4 directly promotes
polarization of activated T cells to the TH2 subset, which
coordinates the IgE response to helminths (see Figure 11-8).
In this case, the main polarizing cytokine is not made by the
activating dendritic cell, but is generated by a neighboring
immune cell. The pathogen interactions that give rise to the
polarizing cytokines that drive T helper cell differentiation
are often complex and a very active area of research.
Adjuvants, which have been used for decades to enhance
the efficacy of vaccines, are now understood to exert their
influence on the innate immune system by regulating the
expression of costimulatory ligands and cytokines by APCs,
events that ultimately shape the consequences of T-cell activation. PAMPs and cytokines such as IL-12, produced by
APCs themselves, are considered natural adjuvants. Dead
mycobacteria, which clearly activate many PRRs, have long

in mice. Very few adjuvants are approved for human vaccination, but given our new and evolving understanding of the
molecules that stimulate PRRs and the consequences of that
stimulation, investigators expect that we will one day be able
to shape the effector response to vaccine antigens by varying
the adjuvants—natural and/or synthetic—included in vaccine preparations (see Chapter 17).

Effector T Helper Cell Subsets Are
Distinguished by Three Properties
Each helper T-cell subset is defined by an array of features,
the details of which can rapidly overwhelm a new (or old)
student of immunology. Understanding these specifics is an
important first step to clarifying the role each subset plays in
resolving infection and causing disease. Having a reference
to them is also helpful when deciphering primary literature
describing advances. However, some generalizations provide
a useful conceptual framework for organizing some of these
details. Consider the following:
• Each of the major T helper cell subsets is characterized
by (1) a distinct set of polarizing cytokines that induce
the expression of (2) a master gene regulator that
regulates expression of (3) a signature set of effector
cytokines the T-cell population produces once it is fully
differentiated (see Figure 11-8 and Table 11-3).
• Which effector subset an activated helper cell becomes
depends on the quality and quantity of signals its naïve
cell precursor receives from APCs in a secondary
lymphoid organ; that activity, in turn, depends on the

nature of the pathogen the APC encountered at the site
of infection.
• Broadly speaking, TH1 and TH17 cells regulate cellmediated immunity (CD8 T cells and macrophages)
and TH2 and TFH cells regulate humoral immunity (B
cells). However, it is important to recognize that all
CD4 effector T-cell subsets may have the potential to
provide help to B cells. TH1 and TH17 subsets generally
encourage B cells to produce antibodies that contribute
to cell-mediated immunity (e.g., isotypes like IgG2a that
can “arm” NK cells for cytotoxicity; see Chapter 13). TH2
cells encourage B cells to produce antibodies that
mediate the clearance of extracellular pathogens (e.g.,
isotypes like IgE that induce the release of molecules
that harm extracellular parasites).
• Helper T-cell subsets often “cross-regulate” each other.
The cytokines they secrete typically enhance their own
differentiation and expansion and inhibit commitment to
other helper T-cell lineages. This is particularly true of
the TH1 and TH2 pair, as well as the TH17 and TREG pair.
• Helper cell lineages may not be fixed; some subsets can
assume the cytokine secretion profile of other subsets if
exposed to a different set of cytokines, particularly early
in the differentiation process.
• The precise biological function and sites of differentiation
and activity of each subset continue to be actively
investigated. Much remains unknown.
We start our discussion of helper cell subset characteristics with the first two subsets to be identified: TH1 and TH2
cells. They provide an illustrative example of the features that

FIGURE 11-9 Regulation of TH1 and TH2 subset differentiation. This figure depicts some of the cellular events that drive TH1
and TH2 lineage commitment in more detail. Intracellular pathogens
activate a cascade of signals that polarize cells to the TH1 lineage. For
example, viruses interact with PRRs (e.g., TLR-3) that induce dendritic
cells to generate IL-12. This binds to receptors on naïve T cells, activating a signal transduction pathway mediated by STAT4 that induces
expression of the transcription factor T-Bet. T-Bet, in turn, activates
expression of effector cytokines, including IFN-␥, which define the TH1
subset’s functional capacities (and can also enhance TH1 polarization).

distinguish T helper cells as well as the relationship between
subsets. We follow this section with summaries of what is
currently understood about the more recently characterized
helper subsets: TH17, TFH, and TREG.
The Differentiation and Function of TH1 and TH2 Cells
The key polarizing cytokines that induce differentiation of
naïve T cells into TH1 cells are IL-12, IL-18, and IFN-␥
(Figure 11-9). IL-12 is produced by dendritic cells after an
encounter with pathogens via PRRs (e.g., TLR4, TLR3). It is
also up-regulated in response to IFN-␥, which is generated
by activated T cells and activated NK cells. IL-18, which is
also produced by dendritic cells, promotes proliferation of
developing TH1 cells and enhances their own production of
IFN-␥. These polarizing cytokines trigger signaling pathways that up-regulate the expression of the master gene
regulator T-Bet. This master transcription factor induces
commitment to the TH1 lineage, inducing expression of the
signature TH1 effector cytokines, including IFN-␥ and TNF.
IFN-␥ is a particularly potent effector cytokine. It activates macrophages, stimulating these cells to increase microbicidal activity, up-regulate the level of class II MHC, and, as
mentioned above, secrete cytokines such as IL-12, which
further enhance TH1 differentiation. IFN-␥ secretion also
induces antibody class switching in B cells to IgG classes
(such as IgG2a in the mouse) that support phagocytosis and
fixation of complement. Finally, IFN-␥ secretion promotes

On the other hand, extracellular pathogens activate signal cascades
that can polarize naïve T cells to the TH2 lineage. Parasitic worms interact with PRRs on neighboring immune cells (such as mast cells, basophils, or germinal center B cells), triggering the release of the signature
TH2 polarizing cytokine IL-4. This interacts with receptors on T cells that
activate STAT6, up-regulating expression of the transcriptional regulator GATA-3. GATA-3, in turn, induces expression of the TH2 effector cytokines, including IL-4, IL-5, and IL-13. [Adapted from M. L. Kapsenberg, 2003,
Dendritic-cell control of pathogen-driven T-cell polarization, Nature Reviews
Immunology 3:984.]

the differentiation of fully cytotoxic TC cells from CD8⫹ precursors by activating the dendritic cells that engage naïve TC
cells. These combined effects make the TH1 subset particularly suited to respond to viral infections and other intracellular pathogens. They also contribute to the pathological
effects of TH1 cells, which are also involved in the delayed
type hypersensitivity response to poison ivy (see Chapter 15).
Just as differentiation to the TH1 subset is promoted by
IL-12 and IFN-␥, differentiation to the TH2 subset is promoted by a defining polarizing cytokine, IL-4 (see Figure
11-9). Exposing naïve helper T cells to IL-4 at the beginning
of an immune response causes them to differentiate into TH2
cells. Interestingly, TH2 development is greatly favored over
TH1 development. Even in the presence of IFN-␥ and IL-12,
naïve T cells will differentiate into TH2 effectors if IL-4 is
present. IL-4 triggers a signaling pathway within the T cell
that up-regulates the master gene regulator GATA3, which,
in turn, regulates expression of TH2-specific cytokines,
including IL-4, IL-5, and IL-13.
Dendritic cells do not make IL-4, so from where does it
come? Mast cells, basophils, and NKT cells can be induced
to make IL-4 after exposure to pathogens and could influence helper T cell fate in the periphery. Germinal-center B
cells and TFH cells can also produce IL-4, which could influence helper T-cell polarization in the lymph nodes and
spleen. And TH2 cells themselves are an excellent source
of additional IL-4 that can enhance polarization events.

Adaptive Immunity: Effector Responses

Investigators, however, are still working to definitively identify the source of the IL-4 that initiates TH2 polarization in
secondary lymphoid tissues.
The effector cytokines produced by TH2 cells help to clear
extracellular parasitic infections, including those caused by
helminths. IL-4, the defining TH2 effector cytokine, acts on
both B cells and eosinophils. It induces eosinophil differentiation, activation, and migration and promotes B-cell activation and class switching to IgE. These effects act synergistically
because eosinophils express IgE receptors (FcR) which,
when cross-linked, release inflammatory mediators that are
particularly good at attacking roundworms. Thus, IgE antibody can form a bridge between the worm and the eosinophil, binding to worm antigens via its variable regions and
binding to FcR via its constant region. IgE antibodies also
mediate allergic reactions, and the role of TH2 activity in
these pathological responses is described in Chapter 15.
IL-5 can also induce B-cell class switching to IgG subclasses that do not activate the complement pathway (e.g.,
IgG1 in mice), and IL-13 functions largely overlap with IL-4.
Finally, IL-4 itself can suppress the expansion of TH1-cell
populations.
TH1 and TH2 Cross-regulation
The major effector cytokines produced by TH1 and TH2 subsets (IFN- and IL-4, respectively) not only influence the
overall immune response, but also influence the helper T cell
subsets. First, they promote the growth (and in some cases
even the polarization) of the subset that produces them; second, they inhibit the development and activity of the opposite
subset, an effect known as cross-regulation. For instance,
IFN- (secreted by the TH1 subset) inhibits proliferation of
the TH2 subset, and IL-4 (secreted by the TH2 subset) downregulates the secretion of IL-12 by APCs, thereby inhibiting
TH1 differentiation. Furthermore, IL-4 enhances TH2 cell
development by making TH cells less susceptible to the TH1
promoting cytokine signals (and vice versa).
Similarly, these cytokines have opposing effects on target
cells other than TH subsets. In mice, where the TH1 and TH2
subsets have been studied most extensively, the cytokines
have distinct effects on the type of antibody made by B cells.
Recall from Chapter 3 (and see Chapter 13) that the antibody
isotype IgG2a enhances cell-mediated immunity by arming
NKT cells, whereas the isotypes IgG1 and IgE enhance
humoral immunity by their activities on extracellular pathogens. IFN- secreted by the TH1 subset promotes IgG2a
production by B cells but inhibits IgG1 and IgE production.
On the other hand, IL-4 secreted by the TH2 subset promotes
production of IgG1 and IgE and suppresses production of
IgG2a. Thus, these effects on antibody production are consistent with TH1 and TH2 subsets’ overall tendencies to promote
cell-mediated versus humoral immunity, respectively.
IL-10 secreted by TH2 cells also inhibits (cross-regulates)
TH1 cell development, but not directly. Instead, IL-10 acts on
monocytes and macrophages, interfering with their ability to
activate the TH1 subset by abrogating their activation,

differentiation of TH1 and TH2 lineages. IL-12 promotes the expression
of the TH1-defining transcription factor, T-Bet, which induces expression of TH1 effector cytokines, including IFN-. At the same time, T-Bet
represses the expression of the TH2 defining master transcriptional
regulator, GATA-3, as well as expression of the effector cytokines IL-4
and IL-5. Reciprocally, IL-4 promotes expression of GATA-3, which
up-regulates the synthesis of IL-4 and IL-5, and at the same time
represses the expression of T-Bet and the TH1 effector cytokine IFN. [Adapted from J. Rengarajan, S. Szabo, and L. Glimcher, 2000, Transcriptional
regulation of Th1/Th2 polarization, Immunology Today 21:479.]

specifically by (1) inhibiting expression of class II MHC molecules, (2) suppressing production of bactericidal metabolites (e.g., nitric oxide) and various inflammatory mediators
(e.g., IL-1, IL-6, IL-8, GM-CSF, G-CSF, and TNF-), and
even by (3) inducing apoptosis.
The master regulators T-Bet and GATA-3 also play an
important role in cross-regulation. (Figure 11-10) Specifically, the expression of T-Bet drives cells to differentiate into
TH1 cells and suppresses their differentiation along the TH2
pathway. Expression of GATA-3 does the opposite, promoting the development of naïve T cells into TH2 cells while suppressing their differentiation into TH1 cells. Consequently,
cytokine signals that induce one of these transcription factors
sets in motion a chain of events that represses the other.
TH17 Cells
The discovery of the TH17 subset of T cells, which, like the
TH1 subset, is involved in cell-mediated immunity, arose in
part from a recognition that IL-12, one of the polarizing cytokines that induces TH1 development, was a member of a family of cytokines that shared a subunit (p40) with IL-23. The
p40 knockout mouse was a favorite model for studying the
importance of TH1 cells because, in the absence of IL-12, it
failed to generate TH1 cells. However, once it was understood

This figure synthesizes current information about the distinguishing features of T helper subset differentiation and activity. Polarizing
cytokines, master transcriptional regulators, effector cytokines, and
broad functions in health and disease are depicted for each of the
major helper subsets. Neither cross-regulation nor the potential

that p40 was also required for IL-23 production, investigators
quickly realized that the results from these mice were no
longer unambiguous. In fact, it became clear that these mice
also failed to produce a T-cell subset that required IL-23.
Some of the functions originally attributed to IL-12-induced
TH1 cells were actually carried out by an IL-23-induced T
helper cell subpopulation now referred to as TH17 cells.
TH17 cells are generated when naïve T cells are activated
in the presence of IL-6 and TGF-, the key polarizing cytokine for iTREG differentiation (Overview Figure 11-11). IL-23
also plays a role in finalizing the commitment to the TH17
fate and is induced in APCs by interactions with PAMPs
including fungal wall components, with TLR2 and the CLR
Dectin-1. Like TH1 and TH2 differentiation, TH17 cell differentiation is also controlled by a master transcriptional regulator
whose expression is induced by polarizing cytokines. In this
case the master regulator is the orphan steroid receptor RORt,

plasticity in differentiation among subsets is depicted, but both are
described in the text. [Adapted from S. L. Swain, K. K. McKinstry, and T. M.
Strutt, Expanding roles for CD41 T cells in immunity to viruses, Nature Reviews.

which also plays a role in T-cell development. RORt knockout mice have reduced severity of experimental autoimmune
encephalitis (EAE, a mouse model of multiple sclerosis)
apparently because of the reduction in TH17 cells.
TH17 cells are so named because they produce IL-17A, a
cytokine associated with chronic inflammatory and autoimmune responses, including those that result in inflammatory
bowel disease, arthritis, and multiple sclerosis. TH17 cells are
the dominant inflammatory cell type associated with chronic
autoimmune disorders. They also produce IL-17F and IL-22,
cytokines associated with tissue inflammation. We have only
begun to understand the true physiological function of TH17
cells, which in healthy humans have been found at epithelial
surfaces (e.g., lung and gut) and may play a role in warding
off fungal and extracellular bacterial infections (see Clinical
Focus Box 11-4). However, a full appreciation of their biological role awaits further investigations.

Adaptive Immunity: Effector Responses

CLINICAL FOCUS

What a Disease Reveals about the Physiological
Role of TH17 Cells
Experiments that reveal the inner
workings of normal healthy immune cells
have offered invaluable insights into what
can and does go wrong. However, at
times we need “experiments of nature”—
the diseases themselves—to clarify how
the immune system works in healthy individuals. Job syndrome, a rare disease in
which patients suffer from defects in
bone, teeth, and immune function, is
helping us solve the mystery of the physiological function of TH17 cells.
People with Job syndrome suffer from
recurrent infections, typically of the lung
and skin. The painful abscesses that are
often a feature of the disease and the trials
endured by its patients explain its name,
which comes from a biblical story of a man
(Job) who is subject to horrific hardship as
a test of his piety. Another cardinal feature
of the disease, elevated IgE levels in serum,
is the basis for its more formal name, Hyper
IgE Syndrome (HIES). HIES comes in two
major forms: Job syndrome, the most
common, is also referred to as Type 1 HIES.
Patients with Type 2 HIES, which we will
not discuss here, do not have trouble with
bone or dental development.
The abundance of IgE originally suggested to some investigators who were
savvy about the roles of helper T-cell subsets that Type 1 HIES symptoms may be

caused by an imbalance between TH1 and
TH2 responses. Initial work did not reveal a
difference in these activities, but as the
diversity of T helper subsets was revealed,
investigators pursued the possibility of a
helper imbalance more vigorously. A
number of groups from Japan and America independently discovered that lymphocytes from HIES patients were unable
to respond to select cytokines, including
IL-6, IL-10, and IL-23. An analysis of genes
that could explain this signaling failure
revealed a dominant negative mutation in
STAT3, a key cytokine signaling molecule
(see Chapter 4).
These investigators knew from the literature that the absence of signaling
through these cytokines suggested a specific problem with polarization to the TH17
helper subset. Indeed, circulating TH17 cells
were absent in HIES patients with STAT3
mutations. The investigators then directly
tested their hypothesis that this absence
was due to a failure of CD4 T cells to polarize normally. Specifically, they removed
T cells from blood, and exposed them to
conditions that would ordinarily polarize
them to the TH17 lineage: T-cell receptor
stimulation (Signal 1) in the presence of
costimulatory signals (CD28, Signal 2) and
cytokines known to drive human TH17 differentiation (IL-1, IL-6, TGF-, and IL-23,

(Induced) TREG Cells
Another major CD4 T-cell subset negatively regulates
T-cell responses and plays a critically important role in
peripheral tolerance by limiting autoimmune T-cell activity.
This subset of T cells, designated induced TREG (iTREG)
cells, is similar in function to the natural TREG cells
(nTREGs) that originate from the thymus (see Chapter 9).
Induced TREG cells, however, do not arise in the thymus, but
from naïve T cells that are activated in secondary lymphoid
tissue in the presence of TGF- (see Overview Figure
11-11). TGF- induces expression of FoxP3, the master
transcriptional regulator responsible for iTREG commitment.
The iTREG cells secrete the effector cytokines IL-10 and TGF, which down-regulate inflammation via their inhibitory
effects on APCs, and can also exert their suppressive func-

Signal 3) (Figure 1a). They stained the cells
for intracellular expression of TH17’s signature cytokine, IL-17, and performed flow
cytometry (Figure 1b; also see Chapter 20).
Although CD4 T cells from HIES patients
were able to develop into other helper lineages (and, as you can see from the flow
cytometry contour plots, were also able to
make IFN-, indicating they could become
TH1 cells), they could not be induced to
secrete IL-17. Specifically, whereas 18.3% of
T cells from healthy patients that were
subject to these conditions stained with
antibodies against IL-17, 0.05% (essentially
none) of the T cells from HIES patients
stained with the same antibodies.
These striking observations suggest
that the recurrent infections HIES patients
experience are caused at least in part by
the absence of TH17 cells. Reciprocally,
they indicate that TH17 cells play an
important role in controlling the type of
infection that afflicts these patients,
including Staphylococcus aureus skin
infections and pneumonia. The critical
role of TH17 in controlling bacterial and
fungal infections at epithelial surfaces has
been supported by studies in mice, too.

tion by interacting directly with T cells. The depletion of
iTREG cells in otherwise healthy animals leads to multiple
autoimmune outbreaks, revealing that even healthy organisms are continually warding off autoimmune responses.
Recent data also indicate that iTREG cells are critically important for maintaining a mother’s tolerance to her fetus.
TH17 and TREG Cross-Regulation
Just as TH1 and TH2 cells reciprocally regulate each other,
TREG and TH17 cells also cross-regulate each other. TGF-
induces TREG differentiation; however, when accompanied
by IL-6, TGF- induces TH17 differentiation. Specifically
TGF- appears to up-regulate both FoxP3 and ROR
(which control TREG and TH17 differentiation, respectively). In combination with signals generated by IL-6,

signals generated by TGF- inhibit FoxP3 expression, letting ROR dominate and induce TH17 development. The
TH17 versus iTREG relationship may be very adaptive. At
rest, a healthy organism may favor the development of an
anti-inflammatory iTREG population, which would be reinforced by the iTREG cell’s own production of TGF-.
Inflammation, however, would induce the generation of
acute response proteins, including IL-6. In the presence of
IL-6, TGF- activity would shift development of T cells
away from iTREGs toward the pro-inflammatory TH17, so a
proper defense could be mounted.
TFH Cells
Follicular helper T (TFH) cells are a very recent addition to
the helper T-cell subset family. Whether they represent an

independent lineage or a developmental option for other
helper lineages remains controversial. Like TH2 cells, TFH
cells play a central role in mediating B-cell help and are
found in B-cell follicles and germinal centers. However, the
effector cytokines secreted by follicular helper T cells differ
partially from those secreted by TH2 cells.
Cytokines that polarize activated T cells toward the TFH
lineage include IL-6 and IL-21. These polarizing cytokines
induce the expression of Bcl-6, a transcriptional repressor
that is thought to be TFH’s master transcriptional regulator
(see Overview Figure 11-11). Cross-regulation is also a
feature of TFH function: Bcl-6 expression inhibits T-bet,
GATA3, and RORt expression, thus inhibiting TH1, TH2,
and TH17 differentiation, respectively, while inducing TFH
polarization.

Adaptive Immunity: Effector Responses

Although both TFH and TH2 cells secrete IL-4, TFH cells
are best characterized by their secretion of IL-21, which
induces B-cell differentiation. Interestingly, they can also
produce IFN- (the defining TH1 cytokine). How TFH and
TH2 cells divide responsibilities for inducing B-cell antibody
production is still an open question.
Other Potential Helper T-Cell Subsets
Other T-cell subsets with distinct polarizing requirements and
unique cytokine secretion profiles have been identified (e.g.,
TH9 cells, which secrete IL-9 and IL-10). However, because
these subpopulations secrete cytokines that are also produced
by TH1, TH2, TH17, or iTREG cells, some speculate that these
cell types do not represent distinct subclasses but rather are
developmental or functional variants of one of the major subpopulations. This perspective has, indeed, been applied to the
follicular helper T-cell (TFH) subset, which also expresses cytokines shared by several other subtypes. However, this subset
has a distinct gene signature and a distinct master regulator
(bcl-6), so most now consider it a bona fide independent lineage. Clearly, our understanding of the developmental relationship among effector subtypes will continue to evolve.

Helper T Cells May Not Be Irrevocably
Committed to a Lineage
Investigations now suggest that the relationship among TH
cell subpopulations may be more plastic than previously
suspected. At early stages in differentiation, at least, helper
cells may be able to shift their commitment and produce
another subset’s signature cytokine(s). For example, when
exposed to IL-12, young TH2 cells can be induced to express
the signature TH1 cell cytokine, IFN-. Young TH1 cells can
also be induced to express the signature TH2 cytokine, IL-4,
under TH2 polarizing conditions.
Interestingly, TH1 and TH2 cells do not seem able to adopt
TH17 or iTREG characteristics. On the other hand, TH17 and
iTREG cells are more flexible and can adopt the cytokine
expression profiles of other subsets, including TH1 and TH2.
The TH17 subset may be the most unstable or “plastic” lineage
and can be induced to express IFN- and IL-4, depending on
environmental input. Some iTREG cells can also be induced to
express IFN-, and some can be redirected toward a TH17
phenotype if exposed to IL-6 and TGF-. This fluidity among
subsets makes it difficult to definitively establish the independence of helper cell lineages. In fact, some of the emerging
subgroups may be variants of TH1, TH2, TH17, and iTREG subsets that have been exposed to other polarizing environments.

Helper T-Cell Subsets Play Critical Roles
in Immune Health and Disease
Studies in both mice and humans show that the balance of
activity among T-cell subsets can significantly influence the
outcome of the immune response. A now classic illustration
of the influence of T-cell subset balance on disease outcome
is provided by leprosy, which is caused by Mycobacterium

leprae, an intracellular pathogen that can survive within the
phagosomes of macrophages. Leprosy is not a single clinical
entity; rather, the disease presents as a spectrum of clinical
responses, with two major forms of disease, tuberculoid and
lepromatous, at each end of the spectrum. In tuberculoid
leprosy, cell-mediated immune responses destroy most of
the mycobacteria. Although skin and peripheral nerves are
damaged in tuberculoid leprosy, it progresses slowly and
patients usually survive. In contrast, lepromatous leprosy
is characterized by a humoral response; cell-mediated
immunity is depressed. The humoral response sometimes
results in markedly high levels of immunoglobulin (hypergammaglobulinemia). This response is not as effective in
inhibiting disease, and mycobacteria are widely disseminated in macrophages, often reaching numbers as high as
1010 per gram of tissue. Lepromatous leprosy progresses
into disseminated infection of the bone and cartilage with
extensive nerve and tissue damage.
The development of lepromatous or tuberculoid leprosy
depends in part on the balance between TH1 and TH2
responses (Figure 11-12). In tuberculoid leprosy, the immune
response is characterized by a TH1-type response and high
circulating levels of IL-2, IFN-, and Lymphotoxin- (LT-).
In lepromatous leprosy, there is a TH2-type immune
response, with high circulating levels of IL-4 and IL-5 (and
IL-10, which can also be made by TH2 cells). This cytokine
profile explains the diminished cell-mediated immunity and
increased production of serum antibody in lepromatous
leprosy.
Presumably each of these patients was exposed to the
same pathogen. Why did some develop an effective TH1
response while others did not? Studies suggest that genetic
differences among human hosts play a role. For example, differences in susceptibility may correlate with individual differences in the expression of PRRs (TLR1 and TLR2) expressed

T-Cell Activation, Differentiation, and Memory
by innate cells. This makes sense given that interactions
between pathogen and innate immune cells determine the
cytokine environment that influences the outcome of T-cell
polarization. Differences in TLR expression or activity could
alter the quality or quantity of cytokines produced.
Progression of HIV infection to AIDS may also be influenced by T-cell subset balance. Early in the disease, TH1
activity is high, but as AIDS progresses, some have suggested
that a shift may occur from a TH1-like to a TH2-like response,
which is less effective at controlling viral infection. In addition, some pathogens may “purposely” influence the activity
of the TH subsets. The Epstein-Barr virus, for example, produces a homolog (mimic) of human IL-10 called viral IL-10
(vIL-10). Like cellular IL-10, vIL-10 tends to suppress TH1
activity by inhibiting the polarizing activation of macrophages. Some researchers have speculated that vIL-10 may
reduce the cell-mediated response to the Epstein-Barr virus,
thus conferring a survival advantage on the virus.
TH17 cells first received attention because of their association with chronic autoimmune disease. Mice that were
unable to make IL-23, a cytokine that contributes to TH17
polarization, were remarkably resistant to autoimmunity.
TH17 cells and their defining effector cytokine, IL-17, are
often found in inflamed tissue associated with rheumatoid
arthritis, inflammatory bowel disease, multiple sclerosis,
psoriasis, and asthma. However, the role TH17 cells played in
protecting organisms from infection was not immediately
obvious. Studies of individuals with an autosomal dominant
form of a disease known as Hyper-IgE syndrome or Job syndrome confirmed indications from mice that TH17 cells were
important in controlling infections by extracellular bacteria
and fungi (see Clinical Focus Box 11-4).
These disorders and those described in Chapters 15 and 16
are just some examples of the influence of helper T-cell subsets
on disease development. It is important to recognize that our
current perspectives of the roles of helper subsets in disease
and health are still simplistic. Our developing appreciation of
the complexity of the interplay among subsets will improve
and add more subtlety to our explanations in the future.

T-Cell Memory
T-cell activation results in a proliferative burst, effector cell
generation, and then a dramatic contraction of cell number.
At least 90% of effector cells die by apoptosis after pathogen
is cleared, leaving behind an all-important population of
antigen-specific memory T cells. Memory T cells are generally long-lived and quiescent, but respond with heightened
reactivity to a subsequent challenge with the same antigen.
This secondary immune response is both faster and more
robust, and hence more effective than a primary response.
Until recently, memory cells were difficult to distinguish
from effector T cells and naïve T cells by phenotype, and for
some time they were defined best by function. Like naïve T
cells, most memory T cells are resting in the G0 stage of the
cell cycle, but they appear to have less stringent requirements

CHAPTER 11

for activation than naïve T cells. For example, naïve T cells
are activated almost exclusively by dendritic cells, whereas
memory T cells can be activated by macrophages, dendritic
cells, or B cells. Memory cells express different patterns of
surface adhesion molecules and costimulatory receptors that
allow them to interact effectively with a broader spectrum of
APCs. They also appear to be more sensitive to stimulation
and respond more quickly. This may, in part, be due to their
ability to regulate gene expression more readily because of
differences in epigenetic organization that occurred during
their formation. Finally, memory cells display recirculation
patterns that differ from those of naïve or effector T cells.
Some stay for long periods of time in the lymph node and
other secondary lymphoid organs, some travel to and
remain in tertiary immune tissues where the original infection occurred, anticipating the possibility of another infection with the antigen to which they are specific.
As our ability to identify different cell surface proteins
improved, so has our ability to identify and distinguish memory cell subpopulations. We now broadly distinguish two
subsets of memory T cells, central memory T cells (TCM) and
effector memory T cells (TEM), on the basis of their location,
their patterns of expression of surface markers, and, to some
extent, their function. Recent work also reveals a great deal of
diversity within these subsets, whose relationship is still being
clarified. We describe some useful generalizations below, and
close with the many questions that remain.

Naïve, Effector, and Memory T Cells Display
Broad Differences in Surface Protein Expression
Three surfaces markers have been used to broadly distinguish naïve, effector, and memory T cells: CD44, which
increases in response to activation signals; CD62L, an adhesion protein; and CCR7, a chemokine receptor. Both CD62L
and CCR7 are involved in homing to secondary lymphoid
organs (Table 11-4). Naïve T cells express low levels of CD44,
reflecting their unactivated state, and high levels of the adhesion molecule CD62L, directing them to the lymph node or
spleen. In contrast, effector helper and cytotoxic T cells have
the reciprocal phenotype. They express high levels of CD44,
indicating that they have received TCR signals, and low levels of CD62L, which prevents them from recirculating to
secondary lymphoid tissue, allowing them to thoroughly
probe sites of infection in the periphery.
Both types of memory T cells also tend to express CD44,
indicating that they are antigen experienced (i.e., have
received signals through their TCR). Like naïve T cells, central memory cells (TCM) express CD62L and the chemokine
receptor, CCR7, consistent with their residence in secondary
lymphoid organs. Effector memory cells (TEM), which are
found in a variety of tissues, can express varying levels of
CD62L depending on their locale; however, they do not
express CCR7, reflecting their travels through and residence
in nonlymphoid tissues. Other markers have been used to
distinguish subtypes of memory cells, but these still provide
a useful starting point for gauging the status of a T cell.

TCM and TEM Are Distinguished by Their Locale
and Commitment to Effector Function
A small proportion (	10%) of the progeny of a naïve cell
that has proliferated robustly in response to antigen differentiates into TCM and TEM cells. In general, these two subsets
are distinguished by where they reside as well as their level
of commitment to a specific effector cell fate.
In general, TCM cells reside in and travel between secondary lymphoid tissues. They live longer and have the capacity
to undergo more divisions than their TEM counterparts.
When they reencounter their cognate pathogen in secondary lymphoid tissue, they are rapidly activated and have the
capacity to differentiate into a variety of effector T-cell subtypes, depending on the cytokine environment.
On the other hand, TEM cells travel to and between tertiary tissues (including skin, lung, liver, and intestine). They
are arguably better situated to contribute to the first line of
defense against reinfection because they have already committed to an effector lineage during the primary response
and exhibit their effector functions quite rapidly after reactivation by their cognate pathogen.
It is important to note that some of these generalizations
may not hold up to scientific scrutiny. For instance, some

investigators contest the definitive distinction between TCM
and TEM cells and emphasize the diversity and continuum of
variations among these subtypes. Hence, memory cell biology is one of the most active fields of investigation, one that
is critical to our ability to develop the best vaccines.

How and When Do Memory Cells Arise?
Current work suggests that memory cells arise very early in the
course of an immune response (e.g., within 3 days), but their
cell of origin remains controversial. Some investigations suggest that memory cells arise as soon as naïve T cells are activated. Others suggest that memory cells arise from more fully
differentiated naïve T cells. Still others raise the intriguing possibility that naïve T-cell activation generates a “memory stem
cell” that is self-renewing and gives rise to memory effector cell
populations. These models are not mutually exclusive, and it is
possible that memory cells can arise at several different stages
of T-cell activation throughout a primary response.
The relationship between TCM and TEM cells is also
debated. They may originate independently from naïve and
effector cells, respectively, or may give rise to each other.
Studies suggest, in fact, that TCM cells arise from TEM cells,
and one possible model of relationships is shown in Figure
11-13. Here, investigators speculate that TCM cells arise prior
to TEM cells, from cells at an earlier stage of differentiation
into effector (helper or cytotoxic) T cells. TEM cells arise late,
and also may develop from fully differentiated effector cells.
The model also suggests that effector cells can replenish central memory cells.
It should be stressed, however, that several other models
have also been advanced. For instance, recent work suggests
interactions experienced by effector cells determines their TCM
versus TEM fate. Effector cells that interact with B cells may
preferentially develop into central and not effector memory T
cells. New models may also need to incorporate intriguing
recent observations, including the possibilities that (1) memory

effector cell features. The model also includes the possibilities
that (1) some effector memory T cells arise from fully differentiated effector T cells and (2) effector memory T cells can develop
into central memory T cells. [Adapted from D. Gray, 2002, A role for
antigen in the maintenance of immunological memory, Nature Reviews

T-Cell Activation, Differentiation, and Memory
cells arise from the asymmetric cell division of activated T cells,
where one daughter cell becomes an effector cell, and another
contributes to the memory pool, and (2) that T-cell activation
generates a self-renewing memory stem cell population that
provides a long-term source of memory T cells.

What Signals Induce Memory Cell
Commitment?
Most investigators agree that T-cell help is critical to generating long-lasting memory. For instance, CD8 T cells can be
activated in the absence of CD4 T-cell help, but this “helpless” activation event does not yield long-lived memory
CD8 T cells. The relative importance of other variables in
driving memory development is still under investigation.
Although intensity of T-cell receptor engagement was
thought to be a factor in memory cell commitment, recent
data suggest that even low-affinity interactions can generate
memory T cells. All studies, however, appear consistent with
the recognition that the more proliferation a response
inspires, the better the memory pool.

Do Memory Cells Reflect the Heterogeneity of
Effector Cells Generated during a Primary
Response?
We have seen that naïve T cells differentiate into a wide variety of effector T-cell subpopulations, largely determined by
the cytokine signals they receive during activation. Studies
indicate that the memory cell response is also very diverse,
in terms of both the T-cell receptor specificities and the array

|

CHAPTER 11

381

of cytokines produced. However, the cellular origin of this
diversity is still under investigation. Specifically, does this
diverse memory response strictly reflect the functional effector diversity generated during the primary response? Or
does it develop anew from central memory T cells responding to different environmental cues during rechallenge? The
answer is likely to be “Both,” but investigations continue.

Are There Differences between CD4
and CD8 Memory T Cells?
The simple answer is “Maybe.” Memory CD8 T cells are
clearly more prevalent than memory CD4 T cells. This is
partly because CD8 T cells proliferate more robustly and
therefore generate proportionately more memory T cells. It
may also be due to differences in the life span of memory T
cells: CD4 memory T cells may not be as long-lived as
CD8 memory T cells.

How Are Memory Cells Maintained
over Many Years?
Whether memory cells can persist for years in the absence of
antigen remains controversial, although evidence seems to
favor the possibility that they do. Regardless, it does seem
that memory persistence depends on the input of cytokines
that induce occasional divisions, a process known as homeostatic proliferation, which maintains the pool size by balancing apoptotic events with cell division. Both IL-7 and IL-15
appear important in enhancing homeostatic proliferation,
but CD4 and CD8 memory T-cell requirements may differ.

Activation of naïve T cells leads to the differentiation of effector cells, which regulate the response to pathogen, and of
long-lived memory T cells, which coordinate the stronger and
quicker response to future infections by the same pathogen.
Three distinct signals are required to induce naïve T-cell activation, proliferation, and differentiation. Signal 1 is generated
by the interaction of the TCR-CD3 complex with an MHCpeptide complex on a dendritic cell. Signal 2 is a costimulatory signal provided by the interaction between molecules of
the B7 family expressed by APC with the positive costimulatory molecules CD28 or ICOS expressed by T cells. Signal 3
is provided by soluble cytokines and plays a key role in determining the type of effector cell that a T cell becomes.
In the absence of a costimulatory signal (Signal 2), T-cell
receptor engagement results in T-cell inactivity or clonal
anergy.

CD8 T cells, which recognize MHC class I-peptide complexes that are expressed by virtually all cells in the body,
become cytotoxic (TC) cells with the capacity to kill
infected cells.
CD4 T cells, which recognize MHC class II-peptide
complexes that are expressed by professional APCs,
become helper (TH) cells, secreting cytokines that regulate
(positively and negatively) cells that clear infection,
including B cells, macrophages, and other T cells.
CD4 T cells differentiate into at least five main subpopulations of effector cells: TH1, TH2, TH17, iTREG, and TFH. Each
subpopulation is characterized by (1) a unique set of polarizing cytokines that initiate differentiation, (2) a unique master transcriptional regulator that regulates the production of
helper-cell-specific genes, and (3) a distinct set of effector
cytokines that they secrete to regulate the immune response.
TH1 and TH17 cells generally enhance cell-mediated
immunity and inflammatory responses. TH2 and TFH cells
enhance humoral immunity and antibody production,
and induced TREG cells inhibit T-cell responses.

Adaptive Immunity: Effector Responses

■

Helper T-cell subsets have also been associated with disease and play a role in the development of autoimmunity
and allergy.

■

Memory T cells, which are more easily activated than
naïve cells, are responsible for secondary responses.
The generation of memory B cells as well as CD4 and
CD8 memory T cells requires T-cell help.

Two types of memory T cells have been described. Central
memory (TCM) cells are longer lived, reside in secondary
lymphoid tissues, and can differentiate into several different effector T cells. Effector memory (TEM) cells populate
the sites of infection (tertiary tissues) and immediately
reexpress their original effector function after reexposure
to antigen.

Q U E S T I O N S

CLINICAL AND EXPERIMENTAL FOCUS QUESTION Multiple

sclerosis is an autoimmune disease in which TH cells participate in the destruction of the protective myelin sheath around
neurons in the central nervous system. Each person with
this disease has different symptoms, depending on which
neurons are affected, but the disease can be very disabling.
Recent work in a mouse model of this disease suggests that
transplantation of cell precursors of neurons may be a good
therapy. Although these immature cells may work because
they can develop into neuronal cells that replace the lost myelin sheath, some investigators realized that they play another,
perhaps even more important role. These scientists showed

that the neuronal cell precursors secrete a cytokine called
Leukemia Inhibiting Factor (LIF). In fact, the administration
of this factor, alone, ameliorated symptoms.
These investigators were curious to know if this cytokine had
an effect on T-cell activity. They added LIF to cultures of (normal) T cells that were being stimulated under different polarizing conditions (i.e., TCR and CD28 engagement in the presence
of cytokines that drive differentiation to distinct T helper subsets). They stained T cells for cytokine production and analyzed
the results by flow cytometry. The data below show their results
from normal mouse T cells polarized to the lineage indicated in
the absence (top, control) or presence (bottom) of LIF.

B-Cell Activation,
Differentiation, and
Memory Generation

T

he function of a B cell is to secrete antibodies
capable of binding to any organism or molecule
that poses a threat to the host. The secreted
antibodies have antigen-binding sites identical
to those of the receptor molecules on the B-cell surface.
Antibodies belong to the class of proteins known as
immunoglobulins, and once secreted, they can protect
the host against the pathogenic effects of invading
viruses, bacteria, or parasites in a variety of ways, as
described in Chapters 1 and 13.
Our current understanding of B-cell clonal selection,
activation, proliferation, and deletion finds its beginnings
in a theoretical paper in the Australian Journal of Science,
written by Sir Frank MacFarlane Burnet (Figure 12-1) over
the course of a single weekend in 1957. In this paper, built
on prior work by Neils Jerne, David Talmage, Peter
Medawar and others, Burnet laid out the Clonal Selection
Hypothesis, which provided the conceptual underpinnings
for the entire field of immunology (see Figure 1-7). The
Clonal Selection Hypothesis suggested for the first time
that the receptor molecule on the lymphocyte surface and
the antibody products secreted by that cell had identical
antigen-binding specificities. Furthermore, it posited that
stimulation of a single B cell would result in the generation
of a clone of cells having the identical receptor specificity as
the original cell, and that these clones would migrate to,
and function within, the secondary lymphoid organs. The
daughter cells within each clone would not only be able to
secrete large amounts of antibody to neutralize the
pathogen, but some progeny cells would also remain viable
within the organism and available to neutralize a secondary
infection by the same pathogen.
In other words, in one brilliant paper Professor Burnet
gave generations of immunologists the basis for thinking
about B-cell receptor diversity, lymphocyte trafficking,
and immune memory—all this at a time when
practitioners in the field were still unsure of the
differences between T and B cells.
Burnet’s paper went on to predict the generation of the
vast array of antibody specificities known to exist today. It
is difficult for us now, in the second decade of the twentyfirst century, to even begin to appreciate the prescience of

Burnet’s suggestion that “The theory requires at some
stage in early embryonic development a genetic process for
which there is no available precedent [italics added]. In
some way, we have to picture a ‘randomization’ of the
coding responsible for part of the specification of gamma
globulin molecules, so that after several cell generations,
in early mesenchymal cells, there are specifications in the
genomes for virtually every variant that can exist as a
gamma globulin molecule.” Just four years after the
eludication of the double helical structure of DNA, Burnet
was postulating that there are movable genetic segments!
The paper ends with a final flourish, in which Burnet
predicted the need for clonal deletion in the developing
lymphocyte repertoire, in order to eliminate B cells
bearing receptors with specificity for self antigens. His
formulation of the Clonal Selection Hypothesis, along with
the brilliant experimental work he performed with others
on the generation of immunological tolerance, resulted in

Adaptive Immunity: Effector Responses

FIGURE 12-1 Sir MacFarlane Burnet, 1899–1985. Professor
McFarlane Burnet, the author of the Clonal Selection Hypothesis,
shared the 1960 Nobel Prize for Physiology or Medicine with Sir Peter
Medawar of Britain for “the discovery of acquired immunological
tolerance.” [Sir Macfarlane Burnet 1960–61 by Sir William Dargie. Oil on composition board. Collection: National Portrait Gallery, Canberra. Purchased 1999]

his being awarded the Nobel Prize for Physiology or
Medicine in 1960, along with Sir Peter Medawar. The
essential tenets of the Clonal Selection Hypothesis are
summarized below, and a visual representation of the
events he predicted are shown in Figure 12-2.
• Immature B lymphocytes bear immunoglobulin (Ig)
receptors on their cell surfaces. All receptors on a single
B cell have identical specificity for antigen.
• Upon antigen stimulation, the B cell will mature and
migrate to the lymphoid organs. There it will replicate.
Its clonal descendants will bear the same receptor as the
parental B cell and secrete antibodies with an identical
specificity for antigen.
• At the close of the immune response, more B cells bearing receptors for the stimulating antigen will remain in
the host than were present before the antigenic challenge. These memory B cells will then be capable of
mounting an enhanced secondary response.
• B cells with receptors for self antigens are deleted during
embryonic development.
In summary, each B cell bears a single type of Ig
receptor generated by the processes described in Chapter 7,

and on stimulation will create a clone of cells bearing the
same antigen receptor as the original B cell. Many B cells
bearing receptors with specificity for self antigens are
eliminated from the primary B-cell repertoire as
described in Chapter 10. In this chapter, we describe what
happens when mature B cells, located in the peripheral
lymphoid organs, encounter antigen.
The two major types of B-cell responses are elicited
by structurally distinct types of antigens. The first type
of response that we will describe is generated upon
recognition of protein antigens and requires the
participation of CD4 helper T cells. Because T cells are
involved, this class of B-cell response is therefore known
as a T-dependent (TD) response, and it is mediated by
B-2 B cells binding to TD antigens. Because B-2 B cells
represent the majority of B cells, we will routinely refer
to the B-2 B-cell subset simply as “B cells,” and
distinguish the other B-cell subclasses by their particular
names as B-1, marginal zone, or B-10 B cells.
The T-dependent response requires two distinct
signals. The first is generated when a multivalent antigen
binds and cross-links membrane immunoglobulin
receptors (mIg) (Figure 12-3a). The second signal is
provided by an activated T cell, which binds to the B cell
both through its antigen receptor and via a separate
interaction between CD40 on the B cell and CD40L
(CD154) on the activated TH cell. The bound T cell then
delivers cytokines and other signals to its partner B cell
to complete the activation process.
The second type of response, which we will describe
later in this chapter, is directed toward multivalent or
highly polymerized antigens, and does not require T-cell
help. This type of response is referred to as a
T-independent response, and the antigens that elicit such
responses are T-independent (TI) antigens. One class of
TI antigens (TI-1 antigens), exemplified by the
lipopolysaccharide moiety of Gram-negative bacteria,
interacts with the B cell via both mIg and innate immune
receptors. TI-1 antigens are mitogenic (induce
proliferation) for most B cells at high concentrations, as a
result of their ability to bind to pattern recognition
receptors (PRRs) on the surface of the B cell. However, at
lower concentrations they activate only those B cells that
bind antigen with their Ig receptors (Figure 12-3b). The
other class of TI antigens, TI-2 antigens, includes highly
repetitive antigens, such as bacterial capsular
polysaccharides. These antigens are not inherently
mitogenic, but their ability to cross-link a large fraction of
the Ig receptors on the surface of a B cell allows them to
deliver an activation signal in the absence of T-cell help.
Many TI-2 antigens are specifically and covalently bound
by the complement component C3d, and mice depleted of
C3d mount poor responses to TI-2 antigens (Figure 12-3c).

expansion of an antigen-activated B cell (number 2 in this example)
leads to a clone of effector B cells and memory B cells; all cells in the
expanded clone are specific for the original antigen. The effector,

Adaptive Immunity: Effector Responses

Most T-independent responses are mediated by B-1 and
marginal zone B-cell types.

T-Dependent B-Cell Responses
Following the completion of their maturation program (see
Chapter 10), B cells migrate to the lymphoid follicles (Figure 2-8). They are directed there by chemokine interactions
between CXCL13, which is secreted by follicular dendritic
cells (FDCs) and its receptor, CXCR5, which is expressed on
B cells. It is important to recognize, however, that once
mature B cells have reached the follicles, they do not just
remain there; rather, they recirculate through the blood and
lymphatic systems and back to the lymphoid follicles many
times over the course of their existence. B-cell survival in the
follicle is dependent on access to the TNF-family member
cytokine B-cell activation factor (BAFF), otherwise known
as B lymphocyte survival factor (BLyS), which is secreted by
the FDCs, as well as by many types of innate immune cells,
such as neutrophils, macrophages, monocytes, and dendritic
cells. Mature B cells unable to secure a sufficient supply of
BAFF die by apoptosis. Recirculating, mature B cells are
estimated to have a half-life of approximately 4.5 months.
At the initiation of a T-dependent B-cell response, the B cell
binds antigen via its Ig receptors. Some of that bound antigen
is internalized into specialized vesicles within the B cells, where
it is processed and re-expressed in the form of peptides presented in the antigen-binding groove of class II MHC molecules (see Figure 8-19). T cells that have been previously
activated by an encounter with antigen-bearing dendritic cells
now bind to the MHC-presented peptide on the surface of the
B cell. This induces a vectorial redistribution of the T cell’s
secretory apparatus, such that it releases its activating cytokines directly into the T-cell/B-cell interface (as described in
Chapter 4). Other interactions also occur between accessory
molecules on the T- and B-cell surfaces that enhance their
binding and provide further signals to the pair of cells. For
example, CD40L on the T cell binds to CD40 on the B cell (see
Figure 12-3a) and the CD28 coreceptor on the T cell engages
with CD80 and CD86 on the surface of the B cell.
The B cell then integrates the activating signals received
through its antigen receptor with those from its various cytokine receptors and coreceptors and moves into specialized
regions of the lymph node or spleen to begin the process of
differentiation into an antibody-secreting cell. Recall that lymphocytes first enter the lymph node in the region of the T-cell
zone, just inside the follicles (Figure 2-8). Some of the antigenactivated B cells then move into regions at the borders of the
T-cell and B-cell areas, where they differentiate into clusters of
activated B cells known as primary foci (see Overview Figure
12-4). There, they complete their differentiation into plasma
cells. At around 4 days post stimulation, when this differentiation is complete, they migrate into the medullary cord regions
of the lymph node, or to parts of the red pulp of the spleen
close to the T-cell zones (Figure 2-10), where they secrete large

quantities of antibodies. Some of these plasma cells die after
the initial primary response is completed, whereas others take
up long-term residence in the bone marrow, gut, or other
locations as long-lived plasma cells. These primary focus
plasma cells deliver relatively large quantities of IgM antibodies in the early phases of the B-cell response.
Some antigen-stimulated B cells do not enter the primary
foci but rather migrate into the follicles of the lymph nodes
and spleen where they undergo further differentiation. As the
follicles swell with antigen-specific lymphocytes (primarily
B cells), they change their appearance and become known as
germinal centers (GCs). In these germinal centers, B-cell
variable region genes undergo mutational processes that result
in the secretion of antibodies with altered sequences in their
antigen-combining sites. This process of somatic hypermutation (SHM) is then followed by antigen selection, culminating
in the production of B cells bearing receptors and secreting
antibodies whose affinity for antigen increases as the immune
response progresses. Antibodies with mutations in their variable regions begin to appear in the circulation 6 to 10 days
following the onset of the immune response.
In addition, ongoing signals from helper T cells direct
their cognate B cells to produce antibodies of isotypes
(classes) other than IgM, in a process known as class switch
recombination (CSR). Both SHM and CSR are dependent
on the activity of a germinal center enzyme: activationinduced cytidine deaminase (AID).
The end result of this extraordinary set of events is the
production of high-affinity antibody molecules that eliminate
the pathogenic threat by one or more of the means described
in Chapter 13. At the close of the primary immune response,
memory B cells remain that are the daughters (and more
distant progeny) of those cells that were stimulated during the
primary response. Many of these progeny B cells now carry
mutated and selected B-cell receptors (BCRs). On secondary
exposure to the same antigen, these memory B cells will be
stimulated more quickly and will deliver higher-affinity and
heavy-chain class-switched antibodies, resulting in faster
elimination of microbial pathogens. This improved memory
response underlies the scientific rationale for vaccination.
As the immune response to T-dependent antigens winds
down, the host organism is left with two sets of long-lived cells
that ensure the provision of long-term memory responses to the
antigen. Plasma cells in the bone marrow and elsewhere create
a reservoir of antibody-producing cells that can last for the lifetime of the host, and memory B cells circulating through the
lymphoid organs remain poised for subsequent stimulation by
the same antigen. Excess residual lymphocytes and plasma cells
from the primary response are eliminated by apoptosis.

T-Dependent Antigens Require T-Cell Help
to Generate an Antibody Response
The initial experiments proving that B cells required
“help” from T cells in order to complete their differentiation were performed by Miller, Mitchell, Mitchison, and

B cells engaged in T-dependent activation first encounter antigenspecific T cells outside of the B-cell follicles. Some activated B cells
differentiate into antibody-producing plasma cells in primary foci
that lie outside the follicles, and then migrate to the medullary
cords of the lymph node, or the bone marrow, where they continue
to secrete antigen-specific antibodies. Other antigen-activated
B cells enter the follicle where they divide and differentiate. As the
follicle fills with proliferating B cells, it develops into a germinal
center, characterized by a light zone, in which follicular dendritic

others in the 1960s, using the technique of adoptive transfer.
In an adoptive transfer experiment, a mouse is lethally irradiated in order to eliminate its immune system; the investigator then attempts to reconstitute the ability to generate an
immune response by adding back purified cells of different
types from genetically identical mouse donors.
Using this technique, investigators showed that, in order
for a mouse to produce antibodies against a protein antigen, it
must receive cells derived from both the bone marrow and
from the thymus of a healthy donor animal. Neither thymusderived nor bone marrow-derived cells were capable of reconstituting the responding animal’s immune system on their
own (Figure 12-5). We now know, of course, that the thymusderived cells active in this response were mature helper T cells,

cells reside, and a dark zone in which the cell density is particularly
high. Within the germinal center, the immunoglobulin genes
undergo class switching, in which  constant regions are replaced
by constant regions of other isotypes. The variable region is subject
to somatic hypermutation, and the mutated variable regions are
subject to antigen-mediated selection within the germinal centers.
Low-affinity and autoimmune receptor-bearing B cells die, and
those B cells with enhanced receptors leave the germinal centers
for the periphery. (See the text for details.)

whereas the bone marrow-derived, antibody-producing cells
were mature B cells, recirculating through the bone marrow.
In this way it was demonstrated that the antibody response to
protein antigens required both B cells and T cells.
Having introduced the major players and briefly described
the geography of the landscape in which the cells are operating, we will now sequentially step through a T-dependent
B-cell response.

antibodies to T-dependent antigens. Early adoptive transfer experiments reconstituted syngeneic irradiated mice, in which the immune
system had been ablated, with bone-marrow cells, thymus-derived cells, or a mixture of bone-marrow and thymus-derived cells. These mice

that has not yet encountered antigen). These receptors, along
with their coreceptors and signaling properties, were
described in Chapter 3. Naïve B cells circulate in the blood
and lymph and pass through the secondary lymphoid
organs, most notably to the spleen and lymph nodes (Chapter 2). If a B cell is activated by interaction with an antigen,
the cell will proliferate and differentiate as described below.
If a B cell does not bind antigen, it will die by apoptosis a few
months after its emergence from the bone marrow.

B Cells Encounter Antigen in the
Lymph Nodes and Spleen
When antigen is introduced into the body, it becomes concentrated in various peripheral lymphoid organs. Bloodborne antigen is filtered by the spleen, whereas antigen from
tissue spaces drained by the lymphatic system is filtered by
regional lymph nodes (or lymphoid nodules in the gut).
Here, we will focus on antigen presentation to B cells in the
lymph nodes.
Antigen enters the lymph nodes either alone or associated
with antigen-transporting cells. Recall that B cells are capable of recognizing antigenic determinants on native, unprocessed antigens, whereas T cells must recognize antigen as a
peptide presented in the context of MHC antigens. In addition, as described in Chapter 6, antigen is often covalently
modified with complement fragments, and complement
receptors on B cells play an important role in binding
complement-coupled antigen with sufficient affinity to trigger B-cell activation.
The mechanism of B-cell antigen acquisition varies
according to the size of the antigen. Small, soluble antigens
can be directly acquired from the lymphatic circulation by
follicular B cells, without the intervention of any other cells.
These antigens enter the lymph node via the afferent lymph
and pass into the subcapsular sinus region (Figure 12-6a,b).
Some small antigens may diffuse between the subcapsular
sinus (SCS) macrophages that line the sinus to reach the

B cells in the follicles. Others leave the sinus through a
reticular (netlike) network of conduits (cylindrical vessels).
These conduits are leaky, and follicular B cells can access
antigen through gaps in the layer of follicular reticular cells
that form the walls of the conduits (Figure 12-6b).
Larger, more complex antigens take a slightly different
route. The SCS macrophages, shown just beneath the subcapsular sinus in Figure 12-6a, are a distinct subpopulation
of lymph node macrophages with limited phagocytic ability,
and express high levels of cell-surface molecules able to bind
and retain unprocessed antigen. For example, bacteria,
viruses, particulates, and other complex antigens that have
been covalently linked to complement components are held
by complement receptors on the surfaces of these macrophages. Antigen-specific B cells within the follicles can
acquire the antigens directly from the macrophages and
become activated. In addition, since SCS macrophages, B cells,
and FDCs all bear high levels of complement receptors, it is
quite possible that antigen may be passed between the three
subtypes of cells until it is finally recognized by a B cell with
the matching Ig receptor. Other classes of cells within the
lymph node can also present unprocessed antigens to B cells.
For example, a population of dendritic cells that is located
close to the high endothelial venules in lymph nodes has also
been shown to be capable of presenting unprocessed antigen
to B cells.
Any discussion of antigen presentation to B cells would
be incomplete without consideration of the role of follicular
dendritic cells (FDCs). Early electron microscope investigations of lymph-node-derived cells revealed the dendrites of
FDCs to be studded with antigen-antibody complexes called
iccosomes (Figure 12-6c). Further analysis showed that
these complexes are retained on the surface of the FDC
through interaction either with complement or with Fc
receptors. Because of the high surface density of antigen on
FDCs, many scientists at first posited that iccosomes’ primary role may be in antigen presentation to naïve B cells.
However, current evidence suggests that their main function

the lymph node. Larger antigens and signaling molecules are bound
by surface receptors on the SCS macrophages and then presented
directly to B cells. Smaller antigens, and chemokines less than approximately 70 kDa in molecular weight, access B cells in the follicles
either by direct diffusion through pores in the SCS, or by passage
through conduits emanating from the sinus. (b) These conduits are

is to provide a reservoir of antigen for B cells to bind as they
undergo mutation, selection, and differentiation along the
path to a memory phenotype, rather than playing the primary role in the initial antigen presentation process. In addition, FDCs secrete survival factors that ensure the survival of
B cells within the lymph node.

B-Cell Recognition of Cell-Bound Antigen
Results in Membrane Spreading
Prior to contact with antigen, the majority of BCRs are
expressed in monomeric, bivalent form on the cell surface.
Interaction of these monomeric receptors on the surface of
the B cell with multivalent, cell-bound antigens then induces

a rather spectacular cellular response. First, a cluster of BCRs
and their cognate antigens forms at the initial site of contact.
Next, the B cell rapidly spreads over the target membrane,
before contracting back.
This spreading reaction can be clearly seen in Figure 12-7,
in which the cell-bound antigen was modeled using a protein
incorporated into a planar lipid bilayer. Membrane spreading
occurs 2 to 4 minutes after antigen contact, during which
time micro-clusters of antigen-receptor interactions can be
seen by time-lapse fluorescence microscopy at the membrane-lipid interface. After reaching a maximum surface area
of approximately 25 m2, the area of contact between the cell
and the artificial lipid membrane begins to contract, and the
antigen-receptor complex is gathered into a central, defined

Adaptive Immunity: Effector Responses
By the end of the contraction phase, the BCR, still in
contact with its cognate antigen on the presenting cell, is
clustered on the surface of the B cell.

What Causes the Clustering of the B-Cell

membrane spreading. Transgenic B cells expressing a BCR specific
for hen egg lysozyme (HEL) were settled onto planar lipid bilayers containing HEL and were incubated for the time period shown, followed
by fixation and visualization with scanning electron microscopy. At 2 to
4 minutes, the B-cell membrane can clearly be seen spreading over the
surface of the planar lipid bilayer (arrows). By 5 minutes, the membrane
begins to contract again, after which the BCR molecules are found
clustered on the cell surface. (See the text for details.) [Fleire, S.J., Goldman,

cluster with an area of approximately 16 m2. The contraction phase takes an additional 5 to 7 minutes. The effectiveness of the ultimate antibody response has been shown to
correlate with the extent of this spreading reaction.

Experiments using monovalent ligands incorporated into
target lipid membranes demonstrated that the antigen itself
need not be multivalent in order for clustering to begin.
Rather, it appears that antigen binding to the BCR at sufficiently high affinity causes a structural alteration in the BCR,
rendering it susceptible to clustering. Initially, antigen ligation of the Ig receptor is associated with a decrease in the rate
of diffusion of IgM receptors in the plane of the membrane.
In addition, antigen binding appears to induce a conformational change in the C4 constant region domains of occupied IgM membrane receptors. These two changes result in
an increase in the tendency of the bound IgM receptors to
bind to the corresponding domains of other antigen-bound
IgM receptor molecules (Figure 12-8). The deceleration in
the receptor’s movement in the membrane coupled with this
receptor oligomerization occurs whether or not the Ig,Ig
(CD79,) signaling components of the receptor are present,
indicating that the receptor clustering does not require signaling events. It is now thought that this BCR clustering may
be the initiating event in antigen signaling through the BCR.
Upon oligomerization, the BCR complex moves transiently into parts of the membrane characterized by highly
ordered, detergent-insoluble, sphingolipid- and cholesterolrich regions, colloquially designated as lipid rafts. Recall
that association of the BCR with the lipid rafts then brings
the ITAMs of the Ig and Ig components into close apposition with the raft-tethered src-family member tyrosine

antigen-bound IgM molecules in the plane of the membrane. When monovalent antigens floating in an artificial bilayer encounter IgM
receptors, they bind and induce a conformational change in the C4 domain of the IgM heavy chain. This conformational change facilitates
oligomerization of the IgM receptors in the plane of the membrane. (See the text for details). [Adapted from P. Tolar et al., 2009, The molecular assembly and organization of signaling active B-cell receptor oligomers, Immunological Reviews 232:34–41, Figure 2.]

kinase, Lyn. This sets off the B-cell signaling cascade shown
in Figure 3-28.

Antigen Receptor Clustering Induces
Internalization and Antigen Presentation
by the B Cell
Antigen binding by the B cell activates the signaling cascade
described in Figure 3-28, and this cascade induces several
changes within the cell. One of these changes is the formation
around the BCR of clathrin-coated pits that facilitate the
internalization of the receptor-antigen complexes. Indeed, we
now know that most of the antigen-occupied BCR molecules
are internalized, leaving just a few copies of the receptor on
the cell surface to serve as signaling scaffolds. Experiments
have shown that those antigen-bound BCR-Ig,Ig receptor
complexes that remain at the cell surface and provide the
B-cell signaling function are more highly phosphorylated
than are those receptors that are internalized.
Once internalized, the antigen is processed as described in
detail in Chapter 8. This results in an increased expression of
peptide-loaded class II MHC molecules on the B-cell surface,
as well as an up-regulation of the expression of the costimulatory molecules CD80 and CD86. Recall that CD80 and CD86
both bind to the T-cell costimulatory molecule CD28. These
changes in the expression of CD80 and CD86, which occur
within 1 to 2 hours after antigen recognition, therefore prepare the B cells for their subsequent interactions with T cells.
A B cell that has taken up its specific antigen via receptormediated endocytosis is up to 10,000-fold more efficient in
presenting antigen to cognate T cells than is a nonantigenspecific B cell that can only acquire the same antigen by
nonspecific pinocytotic mechanisms. Effectively, this means
that the only B cells that process and present antigen to T cells
in a physiologically relevant context are those B cells with the
capacity to make antibody to that antigen.
Now that the B cell is ready to present antigen to T cells,
we must ask how a B cell, with a receptor that is normally
expressed at extremely low frequency within the receptor
repertoire, can possibly find and bind to a T cell specific for
the same antigen, which is also present at low frequency
among all the available T cells?

Activated B Cells Migrate to Find
Antigen-Specific T Cells
We owe a great deal of our understanding of the movement of
cells and antigens through the lymph nodes to recent advances
in imaging cells within their biological context. Specifically, in
some recent experiments described in Chapter 14, lymph
nodes have been brought outside the body of living, anesthetized animals, and lymphocyte circulation through these
nodes has been studied using fluorescently tagged T, B, and
antigen-presenting cells. In these experiments, the blood and
lymphatic circulation to the lymph node is preserved, and the
lymph node is gently lifted onto a warmed, humidified

microscope stage for observation. Sometimes the fluorescent
tags are built into the genome of the animal by placing fluorescent proteins, such as green fluorescent protein (GFP),
under the control of specific promoters that are active only
in specific lymphocyte subsets. In other experiments, the
animal is injected with fluorescent antibodies just prior to
being anesthetized. This technique is known as intravital
fluorescence microscopy (see Chapters 14 and 20) and has
contributed hugely to our understanding of the process of
lymphocyte activation in the lymph nodes.
Investigators have used immunohistochemical, immunofluorescence, and the aforementioned intravital imaging
techniques to visualize particular cell populations during the
course of an ongoing immune response. This has, in some
cases, required the generation of transgenic mice in which
all, or most, B and T cells have defined antigen specificity. All
of these techniques are described in Chapter 20. What follows is a distillation of the information gained from a large
number of such experiments using various antigen and
transgenic model systems.
As we have learned, B cells pick up their antigen in the
follicular regions of the lymph node or spleen. By approximately 2 hours post antigen contact, the B cell has internalized and processed its antigen and expressed antigenic
peptides on its surface in the context of class II MHC antigens. In response to antigen recognition by the BCR, the B cell
begins to express the chemokine receptor CCR7. CCR7
binds to the chemokines CCL19 and CCL21, which are
secreted by stromal cells in the T-cell zones of secondary
lymphoid organs. The B cell still also expresses CXCR5,
which binds CXCL13, expressed by FDCs in the B-cell follicles. Because they express receptors for both T- and B-cellzone-derived chemokines, by approximately 6 hours post
stimulation, antigen-engaged B cells move to the boundary of
the B-cell and T-cell zones. Figure 12-9a shows these various
lymph node zones in diagrammatic form. Activated B cells
also up-regulate the expression of receptors for cytokines
released by activated T cells, allowing B cells to receive the
signals to proliferate, to differentiate, and also to initiate an
anti-apoptotic program. The receptor for IL-4, an important
B-cell-specific cytokine, can be detected as early as 6 hours
post antigen contact and reaches maximal levels at 72 hours.
Antigen-stimulated B cells move about within the T-cell
zone of the lymph node until they make contact with an
antigen-specific T cell, an event that most probably occurs
over the 24 to 48 hours post antigen contact. By this time,
many of the important cell-surface changes characteristic of
B lymphocyte activation can be observed, such as increased
levels of class II MHC antigens and of the two costimulatory
molecules, CD80 and CD86. Once contact with an activated
T cell is made, these antigen-stimulated B cells engage with
their conjugate T-cell partners over extended periods of time,
ranging from a few minutes to several hours. During this
period, the activated helper T cell also expresses CD40L
(CD154), a cell-membrane-bound member of the TNF receptor family, which interacts with CD40 (a TNF family member)

(see Chapter 4) on the activated B cell. The CD40-CD40L
interactions, coupled with BCR-mediated antigen recognition
and interleukin signaling, elicit all of the downstream activation pathways shown in Figure 3-28, and together drive the B
cell into the proliferative phase of the cell cycle.
After this period of intense communication between the
activated T and B cells, activated B cells then down-regulate
CCR7 while maintaining high levels of expression of CXCR5.
This allows them to leave the T-cell areas and to migrate into
the inter- and outer-follicular regions. The activated B cells
appear to spend 1 or 2 days in the regions to the outside and
in between the follicles before finally entering the follicle
around 4 days post immunization (Figure 12-9b).
In the experiment depicted in Figure 12-9b, a transgenic
mouse has been immunized with the T-dependent antigen
nitrophenacetyl-ovalbumin (NP-OVA). Antigen-specific B cells
express GFP, and are therefore labeled green; antigenspecific T cells are labeled red; and the B-cell follicles are
stained blue. In the naïve animal, T cells can be seen clearly
localized in the T-cell zones, and occasional green B cells can
be seen scattered throughout the follicles. With time post
immunization, B and T cells can be seen migrating first into
the interfollicular regions between the follicles (days 1 and 2
post immunization). By day 3, B and T cells can be found

clustered in the outer- as well as the interfollicular regions,
and by 4 days post immunization most, but not all, of the
B cells have entered the follicles and the beginning of germinal center development can be seen.
Interestingly, B cells derived from mice deficient in CXCR5
or CXCL13 behave in a fashion that is not as different from
those derived from normal mice as might have been expected,
and this observation led to the discovery of a second ligandreceptor pair that induced the same migrating behavior in
B cells. EBI2-ligand is recognized by a G-protein-coupled
receptor, EBV-induced ligand 2 receptor (EBI2), that is present
on all mature B cells. The level of expression of EBI2 increases
markedly and quickly following B-cell activation, and interaction of EBI2 with its ligand results in the movement of B cells
into the outer- and interfollicular regions in a manner analogous to that instructed by CXCR5 interaction with CXCL13.
Biochemical experiments suggest that the ligand for EBI2 is
lipid in nature, and investigators are still working to determine
the nature of the cell types that express the ligand, the dynamics of its expression, and the way in which the two sets of chemoattractant signals interact to ensure the correct movement
of the antigen-stimulated B cell through the lymph node.
The outer- and interfollicular regions of the lymph node
contain high numbers of SCS macrophages, dendritic cells,
and a cell population referred to as marginal reticular cells
(MRCs), and the roles of each of these cell populations in the
migratory behavior of antigen-activated B cells is another
area of active investigation.

Activated B Cells Move Either into the
Extrafollicular Space or into the Follicles
to Form Germinal Centers
Over the first few days after their interaction with T cells,
daughter cells of the proliferating B cell elect one of two
fates. Some of the stimulated daughter cells in the extrafollicular spaces migrate into the borders of the T-cells zone,
form a primary focus, and differentiate into plasmablasts.
Plasmablasts are B cells that can still divide and present antigen to T cells, but they have already begun to secrete antibody. Plasmablasts and plasma cells in the primary focus
secrete measurable levels of IgM by approximately 4 days
after antigen contact and are responsible for the earliest
manifestations of the antibody response.
Other daughter cells generated by stimulation of the original B cells enter the B-cell follicles, as shown in Figure 12-9b
in the bottom panel. There, they divide rapidly and undergo
further differentiation. This movement of B cells into the follicles is facilitated by the expression of the transcription factor
Bcl-6, which represses the expression of EBI-2 and enables the
B cells to leave the outer- and interfollicular regions. As the
B cells differentiate under the influence of follicular
helper T cells (TFH) (see Chapter 11), the follicle becomes
larger and more dense, developing into a germinal center.
(The germinal center reaction will be discussed below.)
The precise nature of the mechanisms responsible for
determining which cells enter the primary focus and which

elect to enter the follicle and establish a germinal center
reaction are unclear at this time and may be stochastic.
Below, we first describe the processes that lead to primary
focus formation and then go on to discuss the extraordinary
fate that awaits those B cells that enter the follicles, and eventually develop into germinal center B cells.

Plasma Cells Form within the Primary Focus
Plasma cells are essentially Ig-producing machines. Their surface Ig levels are close to zero, and they are no longer capable
of being further stimulated by antigen, or of presenting antigen
to responsive T cells. An activated B cell in the extrafollicular
regions of the lymph node that is initiating a program of differentiation toward the plasma cell endpoint begins to divide
rapidly and to secrete low levels of Ig. As the cell divides, it
decreases levels of membrane Ig, MHC proteins, and CD80/86,
and increases its rate of Ig secretion to become a plasmablast.
Eventually, the cell reaches a stage of terminal differentiation in
which it is no longer capable of cell division and has achieved
a maximal rate of Ig secretion: the plasma cell. Plasma cells are
found within the first 5 to 6 days of an immune response in the
medullary cord region of the lymph node.
Most primary focus plasma cells have short half-lives,
dying by apoptosis within 5 to 10 days of their generation,
and for many years it was thought that all plasma cells from
the primary foci endured this fate. However, recent experiments have suggested that some of these plasma cells may
migrate to the bone marrow or to other locations within the
body, where they provide long-lasting Ig memory.
There is currently a great deal of interest in the transcription
factors that control whether antigen-stimulated B cells differentiate along the plasma cell or, alternatively, the germinal center
route. Scientists now understand that these transcription factors
are linked in a mutually regulatory network (Figure 12-10).

Adaptive Immunity: Effector Responses

Transcription factors that favor the generation of proliferating germinal center B cells, Pax-5 and Bcl-6, actively
repress the expression of the plasma cell transcription factor
BLIMP-1. Indeed, bcl-6 gene knockout animals are incapable
of forming germinal centers, a factor that demonstrates the
centrality of Bcl-6 in determination of the germinal center
phenotype. Immune responses from these knockout mice
also fail to undergo affinity maturation and class switch
recombination, processes that depends on the normal functioning of germinal centers.
In wild-type animals, as illustrated in Figure 12-10,
induction of BLIMP-1 and IRF-4 results in the inhibition of
Bcl-6 and Pax-5 expression. This antigen-induced expression
of two alternative sets of transcription factors that control the
decision between two potential lymphocyte cell fates is reminiscent of the induction of T-Bet and GATA-3 and their
respective effects on TH1 and TH2 induction (Figure 11-10).
In both cases, induction of the transcription factor(s) that
initiate one differentiation pathway results in the direct inhibition of the synthesis and activity of the transcription factors supporting the alternative pathway.
The transcription factor B-lymphocyte-induced maturation protein 1 (BLIMP-1) had long been considered to be the
master regulator of plasma cell differentiation. BLIMP-1
knockout animals lack all capacity to generate plasma cells,
while enforced expression of BLIMP-1 is sufficient to promote
plasma cell differentiation. In wild-type animals, BLIMP-1
expression peaks at the plasma cell stage of B-cell differentiation, and the highest levels of BLIMP-1 expression are seen in
long-lived plasma cells in the bone marrow and primary focus
plasma cells in the secondary lymphoid organs. Expression of
BLIMP-1 also decreases the levels of MHC expression on the
surface of the cell, consistent with the inability of plasma cells
to engage in presentation of antigen to T cells. BLIMP-1 also
promotes the alternative splicing of Ig mRNA, which enables
the generation of mature transcripts encoding the secreted
form of antibodies (see Figure 7-15).
However, when scientists asked whether BLIMP-1 was
the first transcription factor operative in the cellular process
that induces B cells to differentiate into plasma cells, the
answer was not as straightforward as had been expected.
Specifically, recent experiments have demonstrated that
some genes associated with plasma-cell formation are still
turned on in blimp-1 knockout mice, suggesting that some
factor other than BLIMP-1 may initiate the process of
plasma cell differentiation, even if BLIMP-1 is required for
its completion. What other factor(s) might be responsible for
initiating the plasma-cell fate pathway?
Current evidence points to the Interferon Regulatory
Factor 4 (IRF-4) as the most probable candidate (see Figure 12-10). If IRF-4 is controlling the expression of blimp-1,
we would expect it to be expressed before BLIMP-1 in the
developing B cell, and to control the expression of the
blimp-1 gene. Such is indeed the case. The irf-4 gene is
expressed before blimp-1, and the IRF-4 protein binds to
elements upstream of the blimp-1 gene, up-regulating its

transcription. Furthermore IRF-4 down-regulates the expression of the genes encoding both Pax-5 and Bcl-6. Finally, the
concentration of IRF-4 varies in B cells at different stages of
differentiation in a manner consistent with it being a determining factor in plasma cell differentiation. Thus, it appears
that IRF-4 may initiate differentiation to the plasma cell stage.
But is it required, or merely a useful adjunct to the process of
plasma-cell differentiation? For the answer to this question,
we must turn to knockout experiments.
Experiments with IRF-4-deficient mice have shown that
they completely lack Ig-secreting plasma cells; conversely,
and as for BLIMP-1, overexpression of IRF-4 promotes
plasma cell differentiation. IRF-4 has been shown to bind to
Ig enhancer regions and is important in the generation of
high levels of Ig secretion. Thus, it would appear that IRF-4
may be a determining factor, or possibly the determining
factor, in driving a B cell toward the plasma cell, rather than
the germinal center phenotype.
The generation of the plasma cells in the primary focus is
a critically important step in the antibody response, and the
rate of secretion of Ig by these cells is extraordinarily high. At
the peak of an antibody response, a single antibody-secreting
cell can release as much as 0.3 ng of Ig per hour, with fully
30% of its cellular protein synthesis devoted to the generation
of secreted antibody molecules. Therefore, these cells provide
high levels of antibody that can bind antigen, neutralizing it
and/or opsonizing it for phagocytosis by macrophages.
However, the antigen-binding affinities of the antibodies
secreted by the primary focus have not yet been optimized
by the related processes of somatic hypermutation and antigen selection, and their affinity for the antigen is often relatively low. In the case of a particularly virulent infection, the
antibodies secreted by the cells of the primary focus may
therefore serve primarily to contain microbial numbers until
the high-affinity antibodies generated by the germinal center
reaction are released. It is within the germinal center that the
next extraordinary events in B-cell differentiation will occur.

Other Activated B Cells Move into the Follicles
and Initiate a Germinal Center Response
As described above, 4 or 5 days after T-dependent B-cell activation occurs at the border between the T-cell zone and the
follicles, some antigen-specific B cells enter the follicles. There,
they undergo rapid proliferation, resulting in the formation of
large clusters of antigen-specific B cells. The follicle, which
contains both TFH and follicular dendritic cells (FDCs),
becomes larger as the entering antigen-specific cells proliferate, and the teeming follicle in which an immune response is
actively ongoing is referred to as a germinal center (GC) (Figure 12-11). Interaction between CD40 on the B cell and its
ligand, CD40L, on the T cell is necessary for germinal center
formation, and no germinal centers are generated in mice in
which the genes for either CD40 or CD40L have been deleted.
In the germinal centers, B cells undergo a period of intense
proliferation, and then their Ig genes are subjected to some of

high rates of mutagenesis, on the order of one mutation per
thousand base pairs per generation. (Contrast this with the
background cosmic ray-induced mutation rate of one mutation per hundred million base pairs per generation.) The
mutated genes are then expressed, and the encoded Ig receptors are tested to see if their affinities for antigen have been
altered for the better. Those B cells bearing higher-affinity
receptors than those on the parental cells are selected for further rounds of mutation and selection, while those with no, or
decreased, affinity for antigen are allowed to die by apoptosis.
Second, also within the germinal center, interleukin signals from follicular T cells drive the process of Ig CSR: the
replacement of the  constant region gene segments with
segments encoding other classes of constant regions. We are
just beginning to understand the molecular biology of these
processes, which take place in a rapidly modulating anatomical environment. Given the active mutational and selection events that occur within the germinal center, it should
come as no surprise that it has been referred to by some as a
“Darwinian Microcosm.”1 Below, we will describe the biology of the germinal center and then look in turn at the two
genetic processes that are unique to the immune system:
somatic hypermutation and the Ig class switch.

Germinal Center Formation
When the activated B cells enter the B-cell follicles, they
proliferate in an environment provided by a network of
FDCs and TFH cells. TFH cells were described in detail in
Chapter 11, and both FDCs and TFHs provide survival signals to the rapidly dividing germinal center B cells.
B-cell proliferation results initially in a decrease in IgD
expression on the cell surface, although IgM expression is
maintained. As the GC expands, nonresponding IgD B cells
are displaced into the border region of the follicle, forming a
corona of naïve B cells referred to as the follicular mantle
zone. This is illustrated rather dramatically in Figure 12-11a
as a blue border to the germinal center and is also illustrated
in Figure 12-11b.
Germinal center formation requires a number of cytokines, including Lymphotoxin- (TNF-), that are produced
by the FDCs, as well as by the TFH and potentially by other
cells within the lymph node. These soluble signaling molecules help to repress genes such as blimp-1, and promote the
expression of genes such as AID, which have important roles
in the developing germinal centers.
Dark- and Light-Zone Development
As the germinal center matures, two zones become visible: the
light zone and the dark zone (see Figure 12-11). The “darkness” of the dark zone results from a dense packing of rapidly
proliferating B cells (centroblasts), whereas the “lighter”
nature of the light zone results from the less dense distribution

of B cells (centrocytes) within a network of FDCs; indeed,
FDCs are largely absent from the dark zone. (Note that in
Figure 12-11a, not all the B cells have been labeled, in order to
allow for clarity in the image. The green dark zone is, in fact,
densely packed with dividing centroblasts, a characteristic
that is better visualized in Figure 12-11b.)
The distribution of B cells between the two zones is
dependent on their relative levels of expression of the chemokine receptors CXCR4 and CXCR5, which interact with
chemokines preferentially expressed in each of the two
zones. CXCR4 is up-regulated on centroblasts, whereas
CXCR5 has higher expression on centrocytes.

Somatic Hypermutation and Affinity Selection
Occur within the Germinal Center
The term somatic hypermutation describes one of the most
extraordinary processes in biology. The word somatic tells us
that the mutational processes are occurring outside of the
germ line (egg and sperm) cells. Hypermutation alludes to
the fact that the mutational processes occur extremely rapidly. Somatic hypermutation (SHM) in mice and humans
occurs only following antigen contact, affects only the variable regions of the antibody heavy and light chains, and
requires the engagement of T cells, which must be able to
interact with B cells via CD40-CD40L binding.
The possibility that SHM of Ig genes might play a role in
antibody diversification was first implied by amino acid
sequencing studies conducted in the 1970s by Cesari, Weigert, Cohn, and others. Their studies focused on antibodies
produced by mouse myeloma tumors expressing  light
chains. The mouse  locus has been severely truncated, and
as a result, mice have very few different  chain variable
regions. These investigators were therefore able to compare
each of their myeloma light-chain sequences to a known
germ-line sequence. They showed that the myeloma tumors
expressed point mutations that were restricted to the variable
regions of the  chains and clustered in the complementarity
determining regions. With the advent of nucleic acid sequencing technology, these data were confirmed and extended by
others who showed that SHM affects the variable regions, but
not the constant regions, of both the heavy and the light
chains of Igs; that the frequency of somatic hypermutations
increases with time post immunization and further; and that
somatic hypermutation, followed by antigen selection, results
in the secretion of antibodies whose affinity for the immunizing antigen increases with time post immunization.
These experiments defined the process of SHM, but left
open the question of where it occurred. A series of papers
published in the early 1990s, and representing a technical
tour de force, proved that somatic hypermutation occurs
within the germinal centers of an active lymph node (see
Classic Experiment Box 12-1).
Once investigators knew where mutation was occurring,
their next question, inevitably, was how? This question presented huge experimental challenges, and for almost 30 years

investigators made only incremental progress in defining the
mutational mechanism. Certain nucleotide sequences were
defined that appeared to be particularly susceptible to mutation, and immunogeneticists were able to demonstrate that
the mutational process appeared to be remarkably focused on
the Ig variable regions. Other studies showed that SHM
required the involvement of T cells, that it occurred only after
antigen contact, and that mutation appeared to affect only
genes that were being rapidly transcribed. However, the
nature of the enzymes that mediate the response, and the
molecular mechanisms involved, remained obscure.
The breakthrough came, as so often happens, from an
unexpected direction. In experiments designed to detect the
genes and enzymes that mediate CSR, Takasu Honjo and
colleagues isolated a cell line in which the antibody genes did
not undergo CSR. This type of finding is often the crucial
first step in identifying those proteins that are implicated in
a particular process, as scientists could now compare those
cells that could and could not undertake CSR and look for
differences. However, importantly, they then noticed that the
antibody genes in these cell lines were also devoid of somatic
mutations in the variable regions. Could it be that the same
enzyme was implicated in both SHM and CSR?
Members of Honjo’s laboratory quickly isolated the gene that
had been mutated in this cell line and proved that it encoded the
enzyme Activation-Induced Cytidine Deaminase (AID),
which was subsequently shown to be necessary for both
somatic hypermutation and CSR. But now the scientists were
faced with the new questions: How does AID induce hypermutation, and how is it restricted only to antibody variable regions?
AID-Mediated Somatic Hypermutation
Although all the details of the SHM mechanism are not yet
completely understood, several parts of the process are now
well established. AID-induced loss of the amino group from
cytidine residues located in mutation hot spots results in the
formation of uridine, as shown in Figure 12-12. This creates
a U-G mismatch. Several alternative mechanisms then come
into play that participate in the resolution of the original
mismatch, leading to the creation of shorter or longer
stretches of mutated DNA (Figure 12-13).

BOX 12-1

CLASSIC EXPERIMENT

Experimental Proof That Somatic Hypermutation and AntigenInduced Selection Occurred within the Germinal Centers
In a series of papers written in the
early 1990s, the laboratory of Garnett Kelsoe conclusively demonstrated that the
phenomena of somatic hypermutation and
antigen-induced selection occurred within
the germinal center regions of the secondary lymphoid organs. The researchers
made use of the fact that the immune
response to the T-dependent haptenprotein antigen—4-hydroxy-3-nitrophenylacetyl (NP)-hemocyanin—generates an
immune response that uses a predictable
combination of heavy- and light-chain
variable regions. This enabled them to
study the changes in antibody genes as
the immune response progressed, whereas
a similar study of a response that used, for
example, a hundred or more different
B-cell clones would have been technically
impossible.
The researchers generated serial tissue
sections from lymph nodes at different
time points during an immune response
to the T-dependent antigen. The tissue
samples were derived from the primary
foci as well as from the germinal centers
of antigen-responding lymph nodes. By
scraping the primary foci or germinal
center cells off the slides using microdissection tools, isolating the mRNA, and
then subjecting the mRNA to RT polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and nucleic
acid sequencing, mRNA from 100–300
B cells per sample were obtained. The
results can be summarized as follows:
• Each focus and germinal center is initiated by seeding with one to six antigenspecific B cells. Statistical analysis of the
immunoglobulin variable region
sequences obtained from each sam-

ple showed that each focus or germinal center contained few B cells at the
onset of the response. With time, the
number of distinct clones of B cells per
focus or germinal center decreased.
• Somatic hypermutation is restricted to
the germinal center B cells. Nucleic acid
sequencing of immunoglobulin variable regions obtained from B cells in
both primary foci and germinal centers demonstrated that foci-derived
sequences did not show any evidence
of mutation. In contrast, mutations
could be detected in germinal centerderived, V-region genes and accumulated as the response progressed.
• With time post immunization, mutations
in the complementarity-determining
regions are selected for; mutations in
framework regions are selected against.
Somatic hypermutation is an antigendriven process, unlike the other mechanisms for the generation of antibody
diversity. As discussed in Chapter 7,
the variable region of an immunoglobulin gene can be divided into
framework and complementaritydetermining regions. Jacobs and colleagues analyzed what fraction of the
mutations they observed were present
in framework versus complementaritydetermining regions. Those mutations
affecting framework residues might be
expected to be either neutral with
respect to antigen binding or, if they
affected the folding of the antibody
variable region, to be deleterious. In
contrast, those in the complementaritydetermining regions of the gene,
which encode the antigen-binding

Briefly, the simplest mechanism is the interpretation of the
deoxyuridine as a deoxythymidine by the DNA replication
apparatus. In this case, one of the daughter cells would have an
A-T pair instead of the original G-C pair found in the parent
cell (Figure 12-13, left). Alternatively, the mismatched uridine
could be excised by a DNA uridine glycosylase enzyme. Errorprone polymerases would then fill the gap as part of the cell’s

region of the antibody molecule, have
the potential to be advantageous.
Jacob and Kelsoe asked whether
selective mechanisms were at play
that increased the frequency of B cells
with enhanced antigen-binding capacity. Their results showed that, whereas
at 8 days post immunization, mutations
were randomly distributed throughout
the Ig variable region gene, by the end
of the primary immune response, a
greater fraction of the mutations was
located in the complementaritydetermining regions, despite the fact
that these regions comprised only 21%
of the V region sequence.
• Affinity measurements of antibodies
generated in vitro from PCR-amplified
samples derived from foci and germinal
center cells showed that mutated and
selected antibodies displayed increased
affinity for antigen.
Thus, not only did Kelsoe’s lab demonstrate that the germinal center was the
site of somatic hypermutation; their
experiments also showed that mutations
in the complementarity-determining
regions that led to increased affinity for
antigen were positively selected.

short-patch base excision repair mechanism (Figure 12-13,
middle). Third, mismatch repair (MMR) mechanisms could
be invoked that result in the excision of a longer stretch of
DNA surrounding the mismatch. The excised strand could
then be repaired by error-prone DNA polymerases, such as
DNA polymerase , leading to a lengthier series of mutations
in the region of the original mismatch (Figure 12-13, right).

FIGURE 12-13 The generation of somatic cell mutations
in Ig genes by AID. AID deaminates a cytidine residue, creating a
uridine-guanosine (U-G) mismatch. Resolution of this mismatch may
be facilitated by any one of several pathways that may compete with
one another. On the left, the deoxyuridine is interpreted by the DNA
replication machinery as if it were a deoxythymidine, resulting in the
creation of an A-T pair in place of the original G-C pair in one of the
daughter cells. In the center example, the mismatched uridine has
been excised, most probably by one of the uridine DNA glycosylase
enzymes, leaving an abasic site. The uridine can then be replaced by
any of the four bases, in a reaction known as short-patch base excision repair, which can be catalyzed by one of a number of error-prone
polymerases. Finally, as shown on the right, mismatch repair enzymes
can detect the mismatch and excise a longer stretch of the DNA surrounding the U-G couple. Error-prone polymerases are then recruited
to the hypermutable site by proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA),
and these polymerases can introduce a number of mutations around
the original mismatch. Thus, depending on the repair mechanism, a
mutation may occur only in the originally altered base or in one or
more bases surrounding it. [Adapted from J. U. Peled et al., 2008, The Biochemistry of Somatic Hypermutation. Annual Reviews Immunology 26:481–511.]

Mutational Apparatus Targeting
Since the rate of hypermutation is orders of magnitude
higher in Ig variable region DNA than in other genes in germinal center B cells, some mechanism must exist to direct
the mutational machinery to the correct chromosomal location. In addition, a variation on this mechanism should also
direct AID to those parts of the constant region genes that
are recognized during CSR.
When DNA is being actively transcribed, localized
regions of DNA become transiently detached from their
partner strands. The presence of single-stranded DNA
appears to be necessary for SHM to occur, and the number
of mutations that accumulate in Ig DNA is roughly proportional to the rate of Ig transcription. However, genes other

than Igs are transcribed in germinal center B cells, as are the
constant regions of the immunoglobulin genes, and they do
not undergo mutation. Clearly this distinction alone does
not account for the fact that mutations concentrate almost
exclusively in the variable regions of Ig heavy and light
chains, and something other than active transcription must
be targeting AID to the variable regions.
Careful analysis of Ig variable region sequences revealed
that some sequence motifs were more likely than others to
be targeted by the mutational apparatus, and these are
referred to as mutational hot spots. In particular, it was
noted that the sequence motif DGYW/WRCH was frequently targeted for mutation at the underlined G-C pair. (In
this description of the sequence, the four nucleotides after
the backslash represent the inverted complement of the
DGYW sequence, such that the underlined G and C are
paired with one another.) The code used to describe the targeted hot spot sequence is as follows:
D  A/G/T
Y  C/T
R  A/G
W  A/T
H  T/C/A
The DGYW motif is also found frequently in the class
switch regions, and so it appears to be an important sequence
that directs AID binding to certain parts of the DNA.
Antigen-Induced Selection of B Cells
with Higher Affinity
In this section, we will describe how those B cells with
higher-affinity antigen receptors successfully compete with
their lower-affinity counterparts for survival and proliferation signals delivered to them by TFH cells in the germinal
center.
Seminal experiments using intravital fluorescence microscopy in transgenic mouse models have enabled investigators
to address the question of how higher-affinity B cells are
allowed to survive, while their lower-affinity precursors and
cousins succumb to apoptosis. In these mice, antigen-specific
T and B cells as well as FDCs were labeled with different fluorescent dyes, and the movement of B and T cells during an
ongoing germinal center reaction was observed with timelapse fluorescence microscopy. Investigators observed that
B cells spend a relatively short amount of time in the light zones
of the germinal centers, where they must take the opportunity
to come into contact with TFH cells, in order to receive T-cellderived growth and survival signals. They further noticed that
there are many more B cells than TFH cells in the light zones,
which indicated that B cells may have to compete with one
another for the privilege of interacting with T cells.
A well-accepted current model suggests that B cells bearing higher-affinity receptors capture and process antigen

c12B-CellActivation,Differentiation,andMemoryGeneration.indd Page 401 12/20/12 5:14 PM user-t044

B-Cell Activation, Differentiation, and Memory Generation
more effectively than do competing B cells with lower-affinity
receptors. The more antigen that a B cell processes, the more
antigen it will present on its class II MHC molecules for
recognition by cognate TFH cells. Therefore, a B cell that
has undergone an advantageous mutation in the antigenbinding region of its Ig genes will be better able to interact
with TFH cells than will its competitors, and therefore it will
receive more proliferative and survival signals from those
TFH cells.
Additional experiments have indicated that B-cell competition for antigen within the germinal center may be more
direct than previously thought, as some B cells were observed
actually stripping antigen from other B cells. This suggests
that higher-affinity B cells actually steal antigen from their
lower-affinity counterparts. In this way B cells with higheraffinity receptors present more antigen to T cells, and enjoy
better interactions with them that lead directly to enhanced
survival. In the absence of positive survival signals, loweraffinity B cells in the germinal center undergo apoptosis.
Genetic dissection of this process has shown that signals
delivered from the T cell through CD40 on the B-cell surface
provide an indispensable component of the signal that T cells
deliver to successfully competing B cells. In addition, BCRinduced PI3 kinase activation (see Chapter 3) in germinal
center B cells results in the activation of the serine/threonine
kinase Akt. Akt is a pleiotropic (has many effects) kinase,
which not only promotes cell survival and inhibits apoptotic
proteins, but also promotes the degradation of p53, thus
allowing the GC B cells to cycle.
Thus, those B cells that bind, process, and present more
antigen to T cells will win out over those B cells that cannot
express antigen as effectively. Low-affinity B cells will lose
out in the competition for antigen, and will die because of
the absence of T-cell-mediated survival signals.
Since mutation is a random process, some B cells may
acquire self-reactive receptors. One proposed mechanism
for the destruction of such mutation-generated, self-specific
B cells relies on the fact that self molecules, such as serum
proteins, will be expressed at extremely high concentrations in the lymph nodes, whereas foreign antigens will be
expressed at much lower levels. One might therefore expect
that all the BCRs on a self-reactive B cell will be occupied.
Full receptor occupancy leads to rapid internalization of
the vast majority of the BCRs on the cell surface. In follicular B cells, such loss of cell surface BCR expression would
result, in turn, in the loss of signaling through the BCR,
exit from the cell cycle, and the induction of apoptosis. In
contrast, on B cells specific for foreign antigens, only a
relatively small proportion of their receptors will be occupied by antigen and therefore, on these cells, enough BCRs
will remain on the cell surface to provide the scaffold for
the signaling cascade.
Inevitably, some self-specific B cells will escape into the
periphery. Recall, however, that these B cells will lack cognate T-cell help and, in the absence of stimulation, will simply be lost by neglect.

CHAPTER 12

401

As described above, both SHM and CSR depend on the
activity of the AID enzyme. However, analysis of mutated
forms of AID has demonstrated that different parts of the
same molecule catalyze the two different processes. Furthermore, mutations in different parts of the molecule lead to
different immunodeficiency states.
Specifically, investigators analyzed the structure of AID
genes isolated from a series of patients with Hyper IgM syndrome. In this immunodeficiency disease, patients generate
only IgM antibodies that fail to undergo either SHM or CSR.
Such patients suffer from recurrent, severe infections, thus
emphasizing the physiological importance of both the mutational and the class switching processes to the fully functioning immune system. However, some unusual patients were
found to have AID genes with premature stop codons near
the 3	 end. These patients generated antibodies that could
undergo SHM, but were severely compromised in their ability to perform CSR. Such individuals displayed only mild
symptoms, and their immunodeficiency was often not diagnosed until adulthood. This implies that different sections of
the AID protein are necessary for SHM and for CSR and
further suggests that the ability to generate high-affinity
antibodies may be more functionally relevant than the
capacity to synthesize antibodies of different heavy-chain
classes.

Class Switch Recombination Occurs Within the
Germinal Center after Antigen Contact
In Chapter 7, we noted that naïve B cells could simultaneously express both mIgM and mIgD: both proteins are
encoded on the same long transcript, and the decision to
translate  (IgM) versus 
 (IgD) heavy chains is made at the
level of RNA splicing. In contrast, the decision to switch
from the expression of IgM to expression of any of the other
classes of antibodies is made at the level of DNA recombination, and the process by which it occurs is referred to as class
switch recombination (CSR). The switch to the expression of
any heavy-chain class other than 
 results in the irreversible
loss of the intervening DNA.
The Ig heavy-chain locus is approximately 200 kb in
length. The formation of , , and  heavy-chain genes
requires cutting and rejoining of the heavy-chain DNA (Figure 12-14) in such a way that the desired constant region lies
directly downstream from the rearranged VDJ region. Class
switching occurs by the induction of recombination between
donor and acceptor switch (S) regions located 2 kb to 3 kb
upstream from each CH region (except for C
). The donor S
region is the S region upstream from the antibody heavychain constant region gene expressed prior to the class
switch (which is normally , except for those instances in
which a B cell undergoes more than one class switch). The
acceptor S region is the S region upstream of the antibody
heavy-chain constant region that the B cell will express next.
Switch regions consist of tandem repeats of short, G-rich
sequences, 20 bp to 80 bp in length, that differ slightly for

strands. This leads to the formation of double-strand breaks within both S regions that are then resolved by DNA repair mechanisms, with the
loss of the intervening DNA sequence, as described in the text. [Adapted from J. Stavnezer et al., 2008, Mechanism and Regulation of Class Switch Recombination. Annual Review of Immunology 26:261–292.].

each isotype and contain targeting sites for AID. In CSR,
genetic analysis has indicated that the critical sequence motif
required for AID binding is a pair of WGCW overlapping
motifs on the top and bottom strand, where W represents
either adenine or thymine. (Note that WGCW merely represents a subset of the group of sequences described above as
DGYW.) The overall length of the switch regions vary from
1 kb to 10 kb, and CSR can occur anywhere within or near
the S regions.
Signals for Class Switch Recombination
B cells must receive costimulatory signals from CD40 or,
occasionally, B-cell Toll-like receptors in order to engage in
CSR. The importance of CD40-CD40L interactions in the
mediation of CSR is illustrated in patients suffering from
X-linked Hyper-IgM syndrome, an immunodeficiency disorder in which TH cells fail to express CD40L. Patients suffering from this disorder express IgM, but no other isotypes.
Such patients also fail to form germinal centers, they fail to
generate memory cell populations, and their antibodies do
not show evidence of SHM.
The cytokine signal received by the B cell determines
which class of Ig it will make (see Table 12-1). These cytokines signal the B cells to induce transcription from germline promoters located upstream (5	) of the respective donor

and acceptor switch regions. The resulting germ-line transcripts do not encode proteins and are therefore referred to
as sterile RNAs. Importantly, no CSR can occur in the
absence of this transcriptional activity, which is probably
important in the creation of localized regions of singlestranded DNA recognized by AID. The germ-line promoters
express the appropriate cytokine-responsive elements. For
example, germ-line 1 and  promoters, which are induced
by IL-4, have binding sites for the IL-4-induced transcriptional activator Stat6. But how does a B cell that receives a
signal from IL-4 know whether to switch to IgG1 or IgE? The
answer to this, and similar questions, is not yet clear, and
there is still much to learn regarding the details of the signals
that differentially regulate switching to particular classes of
antibodies.
The Molecular Mechanism of Class Switch
Recombination
CSR occurs by an end-joining mechanism and, like SHM,
the process is initiated by AID. AID deaminates several cytosines within both the donor and acceptor S sites that have
been previously activated as a result of cytokine signaling.
DNA uridine glycosylase enzymes remove the U, created by
the deamination of cytidine, and then apurinic/apyrimidinic
endonucleases nick the DNA backbone at the abasic sites,

CHAPTER 12

403

• What roles do residual antigen, follicular dendritic cells,
and T-cell signaling play in the survival of B cells after
the primary response is over?
• Since some cells will survive this primary response as
either memory B cells or long-lived plasma cells, how
are B cells within a single clone selected for survival versus cell death? Is the decision made earlier or later during the course of the response, and is it random or
directed in some as yet unknown way?

Some Germinal Center Cells Complete Their
Maturation as Plasma Cells
creating single-strand breaks at multiple points in the donor
and acceptor S sites. Mismatch DNA repair enzymes then
convert the single-strand DNA breaks into double-strand
breaks. In the final step of the process, the cell’s doublestrand break repair machinery steps in and ligates the two
switch regions, resulting in the excision of the intervening
sequence. The process of CSR can occur more than once
during the lifetime of the cell. For example, an initial CSR
event can switch the cell from making IgM to synthesizing
IgG1, and a second CSR can switch it to making IgE or IgA.

Most Newly Generated B Cells Are Lost at the
End of the Primary Immune Response
Between 14 and 18 days after its initiation, the primary
immune response winds down, and the immune system is
faced with a problem of excess. Rapid proliferation of antigenspecific B cells over the course of the immune response leads
to the generation of expanded clones of cells, and if all the
cells from each clone were allowed to survive at the close of
every immune response, there would soon be no room for
new B cells emerging from the bone marrow and seeking to
circulate through the lymphoid follicles and receive their
survival signals.
Although we know that most B cells are lost by apoptosis
at the end of the immune response, the exact mechanism by
which this occurs has not yet been fully characterized. As
antigen levels wane, the balance between survival signals
and death signals experienced by the B cell in the lymph
node may be tipped in favor of apoptosis. Certainly, the B cell
no longer receives survival signals via antigen binding to
the BCR. In addition, animals deficient in the genes encoding Fas have excess numbers of B cells, implicating the
Fas-FasL interaction in the control of B-cell numbers. But
we do not yet know the whole story. This is an area of active
research, and a number of important questions remain to be
answered:
• Does the cessation of B-cell signaling simply lead to a
decrease in anti-apoptotic proteins, such that the cell is
no longer protected from these death-inducing signals?
Or is a more active switch engaged that leads to the cell’s
demise?

At some point in the ongoing immune response, approximately 5 to 15 days after antigen encounter, a fraction of
germinal center B cells will begin to up-regulate IRF-4
expression, heralding the beginning of their differentiation
into antibody-secreting plasma cells. As described earlier,
IRF-4 expression then induces the generation of the transcriptional repressor, BLIMP-1, which down-regulates those
genes important to B-cell proliferation, CSR, and SHM, and
up-regulates the rate of the synthesis and secretion of Ig
genes. As the germinal center B cell differentiates into a fully
mature plasma cell, it reduces the level of expression of the
chemokine receptor CXCR5, which has been responsible for
retaining it within the germinal center. Instead the nascent
plasma cell begins to express CXCR4, which enables it to
leave the lymph node and circulate within the peripheral tissues. These germinal center-derived plasma cells differ from
those generated from the primary focus in that their Ig genes
have undergone both SHM and CSR, and hence the antibodies they secrete will be of high affinity and may be class
switched.
For many years, it was thought that plasma cells localized
primarily in the medullary cords of the lymph nodes (the
inner parts of the kidney-shaped lymph nodes), or the red
pulp in the spleen, and that they were relatively short-lived.
However in the past decade or so, we have come to understand that plasma cells can home to several other locations
and that the 10% to 20% of plasma cells that home to the
bone marrow can be very long-lived. Indeed, smallpox-specific
serum antibodies have been identified 75 or more years after
immunization with smallpox vaccine, suggesting that the
plasma cells secreting these antibodies may persist for the
lifetime of the host. We now know that these long-lived
plasma cells derive from both the plasma cells of the primary
focus as well as from the B cells that have passed through the
germinal center and have undergone CSR and SHM.
Within the bone marrow, the niches occupied by fully
differentiated plasma cells differ from those inhabited by
developing B cells (Figure 12-15). Experiments using in vitro
culture techniques to determine the survival requirements
for long-lived bone marrow plasma cells have highlighted
the need for CXCL12 (recognized by CXCR4 on the plasma
cell) and the TNF family cytokine member APRIL (recognized

and APRIL by both eosinophils and megakaryocytes. Characterization of the bone marrow plasma cell niche continues
to be a rapidly advancing area of research.
Other plasma cells, generated in the lymphoid tissues of
the gut, remain associated with the mucosal tissues and
secrete large amounts of IgA. IgA-secreting plasma cells are
generated both in the Peyer’s patches, areas of lymphoid concentration within the gut tissues, or in isolated lymphoid
follicles in the lamina propria of the gut (see Figures 2-11 and
2-12). These gut-associated, IgA-secreting plasma cells have
significant functional differences from the IgG-secreting
plasma cells in other lymphoid tissues, and share some
important characteristics with cells of the granulocytemonocyte lineages. In particular, they produce the antimicrobial mediators TNF- and inducible nitric oxide synthase
(iNOS), molecules normally associated with monocyte and
granulocyte activation. In order to continue producing these

mediators, gut IgA-producing plasma cells must remain in
contact with gut stromal cells and be subject to microbial
costimulation. Deletion of TNF- and iNOS in B-lineage
cells resulted in poor clearance of gut pathogens and has been
associated with a concomitant reduction in IgA synthesis.

B-Cell Memory Provides a Rapid and Strong
Response to Secondary Infection
The first recorded concept of immunological memory
appears in the writings of Thucydides, around 430 bce.
Describing the plague in Athens he wrote, “Only those who
had recovered from the plague could nurse the sick, because
they would not contract the disease.” Implicit in this statement was the fact that those who had suffered and recovered
had immunity to the plague, and were therefore able to
mount a stronger and faster response to future infection.
Figure 12-16 illustrates the classic conception of a memory immune response. The index of immune responsiveness

in this figure is the production of serum antibody. The primary response is characterized by a lag period, which
reflects the time required for the division and differentiation
of B cells within the primary foci and their movement into
the germinal center. The B cells of the primary foci then
release IgM, and after a short delay B cells that have migrated
into the germinal center join the response with the concomitant release of both IgM and IgG. As the primary
response draws to a close, somatically hypermutated receptors make their first appearance, and then a selected subpopulation of B cells leaves the germinal centers and enters
the memory B-cell compartment.
The secondary response to the antigen is both faster and
stronger than the first. Antigen-specific B-cell division has
already occurred, and an expanded set of memory B cells bearing high-affinity receptors is available for immediate differentiation to high-affinity IgG secretion. Interestingly, somatically

CHAPTER 12

405

hypermutated B cells can undergo further hypermutation with
additional antigen exposure, such that the average affinity of
antigen-specific antibodies increases through the third, and
even a fourth, immunization with the same antigen.
The actual kinetics of both primary and secondary B-cell
responses varies with the nature, dose, and route of administration of the antigen. For example, immunization of mice
with an antigen such as sheep red blood cells typically results
in a lag phase of 4 to 5 days before antibody is reliably
detected in serum, and peak serum antibody levels are
attained by 7 to 10 days. In contrast, the lag phase for soluble
protein antigens is a little longer, often lasting about a week,
and peak serum titers do not occur until around 14 days.
What properties distinguish memory from naïve B cells
(Table 12-2)? Memory and naïve B cells share the characteristics of being nonsecreting cells that need further antigen
stimulation prior to expansion and differentiation to plasma
cells. However, memory B cells differ from their naïve counterparts in terms of their sensitivity to antigen activation;
memory B cells are able to respond to lower concentrations
of antigen than primary naïve B cells can, as a consequence
of having generated higher-affinity Ig receptors during the
process of SHM. They also respond more quickly to antigen
activation, and therefore there is a shorter lag between antigen contact and antibody synthesis. Memory B cells do not
express IgD and usually carry Ig receptors that are class
switched (although some IgM-bearing memory cells may
persist). Memory B cells have longer half-lives than primary
B cells and recirculate among the lymphoid tissues.
Despite the fact that scientists have known about the existence of these cells for decades, surprisingly little is known
about the factors that control their generation and maintenance. Questions regarding memory B cells that still await
resolution include the following:
• At what stage in B-cell differentiation is the B-cell fate
determined, and what are the signals that control that
fate? It seems clear that at some point in the maturation
process of a B cell, individual daughter cells of the same
stimulated clone of primary B cells will be selected for
memory generation (life) or death. What mechanism

allows for the differential survival of members of the
same clone of B cells? Exciting, ongoing experiments
that study asymmetric cell division in antigen-stimulated
B cells are beginning to unravel the threads of this
particular immunological knot.
• Where, in the body, do memory cells bearing differentially class-switched receptors reside? In mice, some
memory B cells localize to the marginal zones of the
spleen, and others have been located in the follicles; in
humans, memory cells appear to localize to the marginal
zones and to sub- and intraepithelial surfaces. Interestingly, during an ongoing infection or in an individual
suffering from an autoimmune disease, ectopic reservoirs
of organized lymphoid tissues can develop in multiple
organs not usually associated with immune responsiveness, including the kidneys, pancreas, lungs, thyroid, and
so on. The contributions of such ectopic tissues, as well
as of organized lymphoid organs within the bone marrow, gut, and other mucosal tissues, to memory responses
have yet to be investigated.
• How does the balance of pro- and anti-apoptotic molecules differ between primary and memory B cells, and
are particular cytokine signals required for persistent
memory B-cell survival?
• Are there differences in the efficiency of signal transduction in the two kinds of cells that may help to explain
the variations in their lag times to antibody synthesis?

T-Independent B-Cell Responses
Not all antibody-producing responses require the participation of T cells, and certain subsets of B cells have evolved
mechanisms so as to respond with antibody production to
particular classes of antigens, without T-cell help (see Figure 12-3). Antigens capable of eliciting T-independent
antibody responses tend to have polyvalent, repeating determinants that are shared among many microbial species.
Many of these antigens are recognized by B cells of the B-1
as well as the marginal zone subsets (discussed below). B-1
B cells secrete mainly IgM antibodies that are not subject to
SHM. Because of the shared nature of their antigens and
their oligoclonal antibody response, B-1 B cells may be considered to belong to an “innate-like” category of lymphocytes. Our understanding of the physiology of MZ is still
developing, but it is clear that B cells of this unusual subset
of cells may receive help from cell types other than T cells, as
is discussed below (see Advances Box 12-2).

T-Independent Antigens Stimulate Antibody
Production without the Need for T-Cell Help
The nude (nu/nu) mouse is one of the most bizarre accidents
of nature. Devoid of body hair, its ears seem oversized, and it
appears absurdly vulnerable (Figure 12-17). These mice have

FIGURE 12-17 The nude mouse. Nude mice have a mutation
in the Foxn1 gene that results in hair loss (alopecia) and interferes
with thymic development, such that they possess very few T cells and
only a thymic rudiment. Nude mice provided useful early models for
the exploration of a T-cell-depleted immune response. [David A.
Nortcott/Corbis]

a mutation in the gene for the transcription factor Foxn1 that,
in addition to affecting hair growth, also results in athymia:
mice and humans with this mutation have only thymic rudiments and possess few mature recirculating T cells.
Using nude mice as well as mice whose thymuses were
surgically removed early in life (referred to as neonatally
thymectomized), immunologists showed that most protein
antigens fail to elicit an antibody response in such animals
even while the response to many carbohydrate antigens was
unaffected. Those antigens capable of generating antibody
responses in athymic mice were referred to as T-independent
antigens because they did not require T-cell help to generate
an antibody response. Since T-cell interactions are required
for the induction of AID, TI antigens elicit predominantly
low-affinity antibody responses from B cells expressing only
the IgM isotype. We now know that T-independent antigens
fall into two subclasses (Table 12-3).
TI-1 Antigens
The first class of T-independent antigens (TI-1 antigens) is
exemplified by the bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS). TI-1
antigens bind to innate immune receptors on the surface of
all B cells (including the majority B-2 B-cell population), and
are capable, at high-antigen doses, of being mitogenic for all
B cells bearing the responding innate receptors. Since B-cell
stimulation in this instance is occurring through the innate
receptor (TLR4), only a small minority of the antibodies
produced will be able to bind directly to the TI-1 antigen.
The huge in vivo polyclonal TI-1 responses generated in
response to high levels of Gram-negative organisms can be
catastrophic for an individual and are associated with the
phenomenon we know as septic shock (see Chapter 15).
At lower doses, the innate immune receptors are unable to
bind sufficient antigen to be stimulatory for the B cell. However,

c12B-CellActivation,Differentiation,andMemoryGeneration.indd Page 407 12/20/12 5:14 PM user-t044

in those B cells that bind to the TI-1 antigen through their Ig
receptors, the TI-1 antigen may still be able to cross-link the
Ig and innate receptors, thereby eliciting an oligoclonal (few
clones) B-cell response that remains independent of T-cell
involvement. Under these circumstances, all the secreted
antibodies will be specific for the TI-1 antigen.
Given the number of commensal bacteria in the gut,
many of which bear these TI-1 antigens, why aren’t our gut
B cells in a constant state of activation? Part of the answer to
this question lies in the anatomy of the gut. The gut is lined
by a mucous layer, which prevents access of most commensal bacteria to gut-resident lymphocytes. Second, regulatory
T cells in the gut help to tone down the immune response,
thus preventing the inflammation that would ensue were
organisms to mount a constant immune response to commensal organisms.
TI-2 Antigens
Unlike TI-1 antigens, type 2 T-independent antigens (TI-2
antigens), such as capsular bacterial polysaccharides or polymeric flagellin, are not mitogenic at high concentrations.
Their capacity to activate B cells in the absence of T-cell help
results from their ability to present antigenic determinants
in a flexible and remarkably multivalent array, which causes
extensive cross-linking of the BCR. In addition, most naturally occurring TI-2 antigens are characterized by the ability
to bind to the complement fragments, C3d and C3dg (see
Chapter 6). As a result, TI-2 antigens are capable of activating B cells by cross-linking the BCR and CD21 receptors on
the B-cell surface.
TI-2 antigens can only partially stimulate B cells in the
complete absence of help from other cells. Monocytes, macrophages, and dendritic cells have been shown to facilitate B-cell
responses to TI-2 antigens by expressing a molecule known as
BAFF—a membrane-bound homolog of tumor necrosis factor—to which mature B cells bind though the TACI (transmembrane activator and CAML interactor) receptor. This
interaction activates important transcription factors that
promote B-cell survival, maturation, and antibody secretion.

T cells can also enhance B-cell activation by producing cytokines that push TI-2 antigen-activated B cells from activation
to antibody production. Recognition by B-cell-bound receptors of these T-cell cytokines may stimulate the B cell to
secrete antibody classes other than IgM in response to TI-2
antigen stimulation. Unlike TI-1 antigens, TI-2 antigens
cannot stimulate immature B cells and do not act as polyclonal activators.

Two Novel Subclasses of B Cells Mediate
the Response to T-Independent Antigens
All B cells bear Ig receptors and secrete antibodies, but
recent research has demonstrated that there are multiple
subpopulations of B cells varying in locations, phenotypes,
and functions (Table 12-4). Some of these subpopulations
(the transitional B-cell populations, T1 and T2) represent
temporal stages of B-cell development that occur after the
B cell leaves the bone marrow. An additional transitional
subset, T3, appears to represent an anergic subpopulation of
B cells (see Chapter 10). Others (B-1a, B-1b, B-2, and marginal zone B cells) represent different subpopulations of
mature B cells, each characterized by a preferential location
and range of functional capacities. The T-dependent B-cell
response described above is conducted by the B-2 cell population, also known as follicular B cells.
The presence of B cells with properties distinct from
those of the majority B-2 subset was first suggested when
scientists noticed that B cells responding to T-independent
antigens differed in several important ways from B cells recognizing T-dependent antigens. Those B cells with specificity for T-independent antigens can be divided into two
major subtypes that differ in aspects of their development,
their anatomical location, and their cell surface markers. We
will describe each of them in turn.

 intraepithelial T cells, B-1 B cells occupy a functional
niche midway between those of the innate and adaptive

numbers of neutrophils (neutropenic
individuals) or with other neutrophil disorders. Such patients show reduced levels
of IgM, IgG, and IgA antibodies to microbial TI antigens normally recognized by
MZ B cells, whereas the amounts of these
Igs with specificity for T-dependent (TD)
antigens were normal. Furthermore, in
cases where somatic hypermutation
could be assessed, patients with neutrophil disorders showed less evidence of
V-region mutations in MZ B cells than did
healthy control subjects. These findings
all suggest that neutrophils may play an
important role in the survival and activation of MZ B cells in vivo, a suggestion
borne out by the careful microscopic and
in vitro culture experiments described by
Puga et al.
Neutrophils were observed colonizing the regions of the spleen around the
MZ, even in the absence of infection or
inflammation. Although microscopic
observation and flow cytometry failed to
detect major morphological distinctions
between the MZ splenic neutrophils and

immune systems; many representatives of both cell types are
located outside the classical secondary lymphoid tissues, and
the repertoires of their antigen receptors are less diverse than
those of other, more conventional adaptive immune lymphocyte subsets. Both 
 intraepithelial T cells and B-1 B cells are
self-renewing in the periphery—their populations are maintained without the need to be continuously reseeded from
bone-marrow-derived precursors. Finally, both of these
subsets respond rapidly to antigen challenge with relatively
low-affinity responses.
The existence of the B-1 B-cell subpopulation was first
described in 1983, when the lab of Leonard and Leonore
Herzenberg discovered a set of B cells bearing the CD5 antigen, whose expression had previously been thought to be
restricted to T cells. These CD5 B cells were termed B-1 B cells
to distinguish them from the conventional B-2 B-cell population. (The numbering reflects the order of appearance of
the two B-cell subsets in ontogeny.)
In humans and mice, B-1 B cells make up only about 5%
of B cells, although in some species such as rabbits and cattle,

those in the circulation, subsequent
functional assays showed that the splenic
neutrophils were able to induce IgM
secretion by splenic MZ cells, even in the
absence of prior neutrophil activation by
antigen. Surprisingly, the splenic neutrophils were more effective in the induction of IgM secretion by MZ B cells than
CD4 T cells (Figure 1). Culture of the

Since the classical experiments of
Miller, Mitchell, Mitchison, and others in
the 1960s, immunologists investigating
the sources of help for B-cell activation
and antibody production have been conditioned to think in terms of T lymphocytes. However, we are gradually coming
to appreciate that cells other than T lymphocytes may promote B-cell activation
and survival. We now know that mesenchymal stromal cells and eosinophils
cooperate in ensuring plasma cell survival
in the bone marrow. Recently, in what can
be considered a major shift in our thinking about aiding B-cell function, Puga and
colleagues have demonstrated that marginal zone (MZ) B cells may receive help in
activation, somatic hypermutation (SHM),
class-switch recombination (CSR), and
antibody secretion from an unexpected
source: neutrophils.
Since many cells are capable of exerting effects in vitro that are not replicated
when tested in vivo, we first note that the
numbers and/or activity of MZ B cells are
diminished in patients with reduced

NBHs enhance IgM secretion by MZ B
cells even more effectively than do
helper T cells. Splenic MZ B cells were
cultured for 6 days with NBH cells, splenic
dendritic cells (DCs), macrophages (Ms), or
CD4 T cells (Ts). The concentration of IgM
released into the culture supernatant was
assessed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent
assay (ELISA, see Chapter 20).

B-1-like cells represent the major subset. However, even in
humans and mice, B-1 cells predominate in the pleural and
peritoneal cavities, and it is probable that their major function is to protect these body cavities from bacterial infection.
Because of their priority in the B-cell developmental
sequence, B-1 B cells are found in relatively high numbers in
fetal and neonatal life. Cells having the functional characteristics of B-1 cells but lacking expression of the CD5 molecule
were identified at a later stage and termed B-1b B cells.
Because the lack of T-cell involvement in their stimulation
means that AID is never activated, B-1 B cells secrete antibodies of relatively low affinity that are primarily of the IgM class.
Since B-1 B cells derive from a limited number of B-cell clones
generated early in ontogeny, the antibodies they secrete are
also significantly less diverse than the antibodies secreted by
B-2 B cells. Antibodies secreted by B-1 B cells have evolved
to recognize antigenic determinants expressed by gut and
respiratory system bacteria and are primarily directed toward
such common repeated antigens as phosphatidyl choline (a
component of pneumococcal cell walls), lipopolysaccharide,

of soluble factors, or does cell-cell contact also play a role? The answer to this
question appears to be both. Comparing
the mRNA and protein expression, as
well as the cell surface presence of a
variety of helper B-cell factors between
the circulating, inactive neutrophils (NC)
and the NBHs, Puga et al. showed that the
helper B-cell neutrophils produced
higher quantities of soluble BAFF and

splenic neutrophils, termed B helper
neutrophils, or NBH by the authors, with
CD4 T cells resulted in suppression of
T-cell proliferation following stimulation
with anti-CD3 and IL-2. This shows that
the neutrophils are not stimulating B cells
indirectly by first activating T cells, and
also allows for the possibility that the
neutrophils may be selectively biasing
splenic B cells toward T-independent
responses.
Using qPCR, Puga and colleagues
demonstrated the presence of aicda
mRNA (encoding the AID protein) in MZ
B cells. They further showed that culturing B cells in medium conditioned by the
growth of NBH cells in it (NBH-conditioned
medium) resulted in the up-regulation
of aicda mRNA expression in those B cells.
The amount of aicda mRNA in the MZ
B cells was greater than in naïve B cells,
but not as much as in B-2 B cells engaged
in an active germinal center reaction.
Culturing MZ B cells with NBH cells, or
with NBH-conditioned medium, resulted
in both SHM and CSR and confirmed
that NBH-derived help was sufficient to
drive both processes in the MZ B cells
(Figure 2).

cells. They also expressed more BAFF on
their membranes. Investigators reduced
the amount of each of these cytokines
that was available to B cells by adding
soluble forms of the cytokine receptors
to in vitro B cell cultures. The soluble
receptors act by blocking B cell recognition. Under these conditions, IgM secretion, and CSR to IgG and IgA were both
significantly reduced, thus demonstrating the relevance of the three cytokine
signals to MZ B cell activation. The
authors also note that NBH cells express
surface CD40L, although at lower levels
than those found on CD4+ T cells.
Thus, at least for MZ B cells, the role
played by helper neutrophils in B-cell activation may be even more relevant than
that played by helper T cells. Paradigm
shifts such as this one enliven a field in
delightful and stimulating ways.

and influenza viruses. B-1 B cells represent the majority component of the B-cell responses to TI antigens.
Very early in the history of immunology, investigators
noted that the serum of unimmunized mice and humans
contains so-called natural IgM antibodies that bind a broad
spectrum of antigens with relatively low affinity. These antibodies derive mainly from B-1 B cells, and their presence in
unimmunized animals suggests that B-1 B cells may exist in
a partially activated state and constitutively secrete low levels
of natural antibodies. In addition, a relatively high frequency
of these IgM antibodies display autoimmune reactivities,
although their affinities for self antigens are sufficiently low
that they rarely induce disease. Low-level interactions with
self antigens during development may therefore be important in the development of B-1 B-cell function and in the
maintenance of their partially activated phenotype.
Although antibody secretion by B-1 B cells is not dependent on T-cell help, it can be enhanced in the presence of
T-cell cytokines. Indeed, recent data suggests that, in the
presence of T-cell help, B-1b cells may express certain attri-

butes of B-2 cells, such as Ig class switching (with the resultant production of IgA antibodies), SHM, and the generation
of a long-lasting antibody response.
Marginal Zone B Cells
The second class of B cells capable of responding to TI
antigens is the marginal zone (MZ) subset, which resides
in the marginal zone of the spleen (Figure 12-18). As for
B-1 B cells, maintenance of physiological levels of MZ B
cells appears to depend on their capacity to receive lowlevel signals through the BCR. Again, like B-1 B cells, MZ
B cells have the capacity for self-renewal in the periphery
and do not need to be constantly replenished from bone
marrow precursors. MZ B cells derive originally from the
transitional T2 B-cell population, and it has recently been
shown that the Notch2 signaling system plays a role in
sending B cells down the MZ pathway. This is notable
because Notch signaling was previously thought to be
restricted in its activity among lymphocytes to T cells. MZ
B cells bear unusually high levels of CD21 (CR2), enabling

them to bind very efficiently to antigens covalently conjugated to C3d or C3dg. Since one characteristic of TI-2
antigens is an enhanced tendency to bind C3d, MZ B cells
are particularly important in the host protection against
pathogens bearing TI-2 antigens.
MZ B cells are specialized to respond to blood-borne antigens that enter the immune system via the splenic MZ. Antigen stimulation of MZ B cells results in their movement from
the MZ to the bridging channels and red pulp of the spleen,
where they undergo a burst of proliferation, forming foci of
plasmablasts not unlike the primary foci formed in the lymph

nodes upon antigen challenge. These cells produce high levels
of antigen-specific IgM within 3 to 4 days after antigenic
stimulation. Very recent work has suggested that MZ B cells
may be helped in antibody secretion, SHM, and CSR not by
T cells (as we have come to expect), but instead by neutrophils, which we normally think of as participants in the
innate arm, rather than the adaptive arm, of immunity. These
experiments are described in Advances Box 12-2.
Some of the characteristics of MZ B cells, as well as their
local environments, differ between rodents and primates. Of
particular interest is the possibility that the variable regions

of antibodies derived from human MZ B cells may undergo
SHM in the absence of an obvious germinal center reaction,
and conceivably even in the absence of antigenic stimulation. Furthermore, in rodents, B cells with the characteristics
of MZ cells are restricted to the MZs of the spleen, whereas
in primates they can be found in other peripheral lymphoid
tissues such as the tonsils.

Negative Regulation of B Cells
Up until this point, we have been discussing how B cells are
activated, and the functional correlates of that activation.
However, antigen stimulation of B cells results in a proliferative response that is as rapid as any observed in vertebrate
organisms; an activated lymphocyte may divide once every 6
hours. Control mechanisms have therefore evolved to ensure
that B-cell proliferation is slowed down once sufficient specific B cells have been generated and that most of the B cells
enter into an apoptotic program once the pathogen has been
eliminated. In this section, we will address negative regulation of B-cell activation that is mediated through two different molecules on the B-cell surface.

Negative Signaling through CD22 Shuts Down
Unnecessary BCR Signaling
In addition to CD19/CD21 and CD81, the BCR of resting
B cells is also associated with an additional transmembrane
molecule, CD22. CD22 bears an Immunoreceptor Tyrosinebased Inhibitory Motif (ITIM), similar in structure to the
ITAM motifs introduced in Chapter 3, but mediating inhibitory, rather than activating functions. Activation of B cells
results in phosphorylation of the ITIM, thus allowing association of the SHP-1 tyrosine phosphatase with the cytoplasmic tail of CD22. SHP-1 can then strip activating
phosphates from the tyrosine of neighboring signaling
complexes.
For as long as the BCR signaling pathway is being activated by antigen engagement, phosphate groups are reattached to the tyrosine residues of adapter molecules and
other signaling intermediates as fast as the phosphatases can
strip them off. However, once antigen levels begin to decrease,
receptor-associated tyrosine kinase activity slows down, and
signaling through CD22 can then induce the removal of any
residual activating phosphates. CD22 thus functions as a
negative regulator of B-cell activation, and its presence and
activity ensure that signaling from the BCR is shut down
when antigen is no longer bound to the BCR. Consistent with
this negative feedback role, levels of B-cell activation are elevated in CD22 knockout mice, and aging CD22 knockout
animals have increased levels of autoimmunity.
CD22 is a cell-surface receptor molecule that recognizes
N-glycolyl neuraminic acid residues on serum glycoproteins
and other cell surfaces and can thus double as an adhesion
molecule. It is expressed in mature B cells that bear both
mIgM and mIgD Ig receptors.

CHAPTER 12

411

Negative Signaling through the FcRIIb
Receptor Inhibits B-Cell Activation
It has long been known that the presence of circulating,
specific, antigen-IgG complexes is inhibitory for further
B-cell activation, and this phenomenon has now been
explained at the molecular level by the characterization of
the Fc␥RIIb receptor (also known as CD32). FcRIIb recognizes immune complexes containing IgG and, like CD22,
bears a cytoplasmic ITIM domain. Co-ligation of the B cell’s
FcRIIb receptor molecules with the BCR by a specific
antigen-antibody immune complex results in activation of
the FcRIIb signaling cascade, and phosphorylation of
FcRIIb’s ITIM. The phosphorylated ITIM serves as a docking site for the inositol phosphatase SHIP, which binds to
the ITIM via its SH2 domain. SHIP then hydrolyzes PIP3 to
PIP2, thus interfering with the membrane localization of the
important signaling molecules Btk and PLC2 (see Chapter 3)
and causing the effective abrogation of B-cell signaling. Signaling through FcRIIb also results in decreased phosphorylation of CD19 and reduced recruitment of PI3 kinase
to the membrane.
Negative signaling through the FcRIIb receptor makes
intuitive sense, as the presence of immune complexes containing the antigen for which a B cell is specific signals the
presence of high levels of antigen-specific antibody, and
hence a reduced need for further B-cell differentiation.

B-10 B Cells Act as Negative Regulators
by Secreting IL-10
Recently, an unusual population of B cells has been discovered that appears to be capable of negatively regulating
potentially inflammatory immune responses by secreting
the cytokine IL-10 upon stimulation.
Working with two mouse autoimmune models, investigators demonstrated that B cells capable of secreting the
immunoregulatory cytokine IL-10 could alleviate the symptoms of a mouse suffering from a form of the antibodymediated autoimmune disease multiple sclerosis. Recall
from Chapter 11 that IL-10 is a cytokine normally associated with regulatory T cells. It has pleiotropic effects on
other immune system cells, which include the suppression
of T-cell production of the cytokines IL-2, IL-5, and TNF-.
Furthermore, IL-10 interacts with antigen-presenting cells
in such a manner as to reduce the cell surface expression of
MHC antigens. The finding that B cells could be capable of
secreting this immunoregulatory cytokine represents the
first indication that they, as distinct from T cells, might
have the capacity to down-regulate the function of other
immune system cells. A small population of splenic B cells
appears to account for almost all of the B-cell-derived
IL-10. However, at this point, we do not know whether this
IL-10 secreting B-cell population truly represents a single
developmental B-cell lineage. For example, B cells producing IL-10 have been identified among both B-1 and B-2

Adaptive Immunity: Effector Responses

B-cell populations. In addition, some, but not all B cells
producing IL-10 bear markers typical of the transitional T2
B-cell subset.
Importantly, all B-10 B cells appear to demonstrate the
capacity to secrete a diverse repertoire of antibodies, with
specificities for both foreign and auto-antigens. It is thought

that the function of these cells may be to limit and control
inflammation during the course of an ongoing immune
response. A great deal of work is still required to tease out
the lineage relationships among these various IL-10-secreting
and other B-cell subpopulations.

The Clonal Selection Hypothesis states that each B cell
bears a single antigen receptor. When antigen interacts
with a B-cell receptor (BCR) specific for that antigen, it
induces proliferation of that B cell to form a clone of cells
bearing the identical specificity. Cells from this clone
secrete antibodies having the same specificity as the antigen receptor. At the close of the immune response, there
will be more cells bearing that specificity than existed
prior to the response, and these so-called “memory B cells”
will generate a faster and higher response upon secondary
antigen exposure. Those cells bearing receptors with
specificity for self antigens are eliminated from the B-cell
repertoire during development.
The B-cell response to some antigens requires help from
T cells. These T-dependent responses are mounted by B-2
or follicular B cells. The response to some other antigens
can occur in the absence of T-cell help. These T-independent
responses are primarily mounted by B-1 or marginal zone
(MZ) B cells.
Mature B-2 B cells migrate to the lymphoid follicles under
the influence of the chemokine CXCL13. Survival of
mature B-2 B cells depends upon access to the survival
factor BAFF.
B cells may acquire antigens directly. Some antigens enter
the lymph node by squeezing between the subcapsular
sinus (SCS) macrophages that line the lymph node,
whereas others enter via a leaky network of conduits that
are sampled by the follicular B cells. Yet others are taken
up first by the SCS macrophages or follicular dendritic
cells and passed on to the B cells.
When the BCR recognizes its cognate antigen, the receptors on the B-cell membrane briefly spread over the antigen surface, and then contract, resulting in B-cell receptor
clustering. This represents the earliest phase of B-cell
activation.
Receptor clustering results in internalization of the receptorantigen complex followed by antigen presentation by the
B cell to the T cell. The T-cell/B-cell interaction occurs
primarily at the border between the T- and B-cell zones of
the lymph node.
T cells interact with their cognate B cells by binding to the
processed antigen with their T-cell receptor (TCR), as

well as by interactions between T cell CD28 with B cell
CD80 and CD86, and between T cell CD40L and B cell
CD40. These interactions facilitate the directional secretion of T-cell cytokines that are necessary for full B-cell
activation.
■

Following stimulation of primary B cells at the T-cell/
B-cell border within the lymph node, some B cells differentiate quickly into plasma cells that form primary foci
and secrete an initial wave of IgM antibodies. This requires
the up-regulation of the plasma cell transcription factors
IRF4 and BLIMP-1.

■

Other B cells from the antigen-stimulate clones migrate to
the primary follicles and form germinal centers.

■

Within germinal centers, B-cell differentiation continues,
with the generation of somatically hypermutated receptors
that are then subject to antigen selection, with the eventual generation of high-affinity antibodies.

■

Somatic hypermutation (SHM) affects certain sequences
called mutational hot spots, in the variable region genes of
antibody molecules.

■

Also within the germinal center, the constant region of the
heavy chain of the antibody genes undergoes class switch
recombination (CSR). This results in the formation of
antibodies bearing mutated variable regions and constant
regions other than . CSR occurs between switch regions
upstream of each heavy chain constant region gene
(except for the 
 constant region).

■

Both somatic hypermutation and class switch recombination are mediated by the enzyme activation-induced cytidine deaminase (AID), followed by DNA repair.

■

At the close of the B-cell response, long-term memory
exists in two forms. Recirculating B memory cells must be
reactivated by antigen in order to yield a higher, faster, and
stronger response than the primary response. In addition,
long-lived plasma cells residing in the bone marrow and
other locations continually secrete antibodies and ensure
that antibodies to commonly encountered antigens constantly circulate within the blood.

■

T-independent responses generated by B-1 and marginal
zone (MZ) B cells give rise to relatively low-affinity, primarily IgM antibodies.

B-Cell Activation, Differentiation, and Memory Generation

■

TI-1 antigens interact with B cells via both the BCR and
innate immune receptors, whereas TI-2 receptors are
highly polymerized antigens that do not have an intrinsic,
mitogenic activity. Both types of T-independent responses
are enhanced by interactions with other cell types, including T cells, macrophages, and monocytes, and possibly,
neutrophils.

Effector Responses: Celland Antibody-Mediated
Immunity

I

n previous chapters, we have focused on how the
immune response is initiated. Here, we will finally
describe how the targets of the immune system—
pathogen, infected cells, and even tumor cells—are
actually cleared from the body.
We have already seen how the innate immune system
initiates the response to pathogen and alerts the adaptive
immune system to the presence and nature of that
pathogen (Chapter 5). In Chapters 9 through 12, we
described the development and activation of the antigenspecific cells of the adaptive immune system, B and T
lymphocytes. You were also introduced to the
differentiation and activity of helper T lymphocytes, a
type of effector cell that regulates the activity and
function of cytotoxic T cells, B cells, and other antigenpresenting cells. Here we focus on the effector cells and
molecules of both the cell-mediated and the humoral
(antibody-mediated) immune responses that directly rid
the organism of pathogens and abnormal cells. These
effector responses are arguably the most important
manifestations of the immune response: they protect the
host from infection and rid the host of pathogens that
have breached defenses.
The effector functions of cell-mediated and humoral
branches of the immune system assume different,
although overlapping, roles in clearing infection from a
host. The effector molecules of the humoral branch are
antibodies, the secreted version of the highly specific
receptor on the surface of B cells. Antibodies secreted into
extracellular spaces are exquisitely antigen specific and
have several methods at their disposal to rid a body of
pathogen. How an antibody contributes to clearing
infection depends on its isotype, which determines
whether it can recruit complement (recall Chapter 6). The
isotype also determines which receptors an antibody can
bind. Antibody-binding receptors, which bind to the
constant regions of antibodies and are therefore called Fc
receptors or FcRs, determine which cells an antibody can
recruit to aid in its destructive mission, as well as the
tissues to which it can gain entry.

Experimental Assessment of Cell-Mediated
Cytotoxicity

If antibodies were the only agents of immunity,
intracellular pathogens, which occupy spaces that
antibody cannot access, would likely escape the immune
system. Fortunately there is another effector branch of our
immune system, cell-mediated immunity, which detects
and kills cells that harbor intracellular pathogens. Cellmediated immunity consists of both helper T cells
(CD4 TH) and several types of cytotoxic cells. As you
have seen in Chapter 11, TH cells exert their effector
functions indirectly, by contributing to the activation of
antigen-presenting cells, B cells, and cytotoxic T cells via
receptor-ligand interactions and soluble cytokines and
chemokines. On the other hand, cytotoxic cells exert their
effector functions directly, by attacking infected cells and,
in some cases, the pathogens themselves.
Effector cytotoxic cells arise from both the adaptive
and innate immune systems and, therefore, include both
antigen-specific and -nonspecific cells. Antigennonspecific (innate immune) cells that contribute to the

Adaptive Immunity: Effector Responses

clearance of infected cells include NK cells and
nonlymphoid cell types such as macrophages,
neutrophils, and eosinophils. Antigen-specific cytotoxic
cells include CD8 T lymphocytes (CTLs or TC cells), as
well as the CD4 NKT cell subpopulation, which,
although derived from the T-cell lineage, displays some
useful features of innate immune cell types, too.
Populations of cytotoxic CD4 TH cells have also been
described and may contribute to delayed-type
hypersensitivity. The discussion of DTH reactions and
the role of CD4 T cells in their orchestration appears in
Chapter 15.
The humoral and cell-mediated immune systems also
cooperate effectively. Cells such as macrophages, NK cells,
neutrophils, and eosinophils all express Fc receptors,
which induce phagocytosis of antibody-antigen
complexes as well as direct killing of target cells via a
process known as antibody-dependent cell-mediated
cytotoxicity.
It is also important to note that the cell-mediated
immune system plays a role in recognizing and
eliminating not only infected cells, but tumor cells,
which often have undergone genetic modifications that
lead to surface expression of antigens not typical of
normal cells.
In this chapter we will first focus on antibodymediated activities, describing not only their ability to fix
complement but also the multiple functions they acquire
by interacting with cells expressing Fc receptors. We will
then describe cytotoxic effector mechanisms mediated by
cells of the innate and adaptive immune system. We will
close with a discussion of experimental assays of
cytotoxicity.
A Clinical Focus feature and a Classic Experiment
feature are also included in this chapter. The first
describes how knowledge of antibody structure and
function has led to new and successful disease
therapies. The second introduces recent data showing
that lymphocytes are not the only cell type that can
develop a memory; natural killer cells, members of the
innate immune system, also appear to have this
capacity.

Antibody-Mediated Effector
Functions
Antibodies generated by activated B cells (see Chapter 12)
protect the body against the pathogen in several ways: they
can neutralize pathogen by binding to and blocking receptors that the pathogen uses to gain entry into a cell; they can

opsonize pathogen by binding and recruiting phagocytic
cells; and they can fix complement by binding to pathogen
and initiating the complement cascade, which punctures
cell membranes (see Chapter 6). In addition, they can cooperate with the cellular branch of the immune system by
binding and recruiting the activities of cytotoxic cells, specifically natural killer (NK) cells, in a process called
antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC)
(Figure  13-1 and Table 13-1). The ability of antibodies to
mediate these responses is dependent not only on their
antigen specificity, but also on their isotype (see Chapter 3
and Table  13-2), which determines whether an antibody
will “fix” complement, to which Fc receptors they will bind,
and therefore, which cellular effects they will have.
Collectively, these mechanisms result in the destruction of
pathogen, either directly or indirectly, by stimulating phagocytosis and digestion of pathogen-antibody complexes, directly
destroying pathogenic cell membranes, or inducing suicide of
the infected cell.

Antibodies Mediate the Clearance and
Destruction of Pathogen in a Variety of Ways
Antibodies are versatile effector molecules that play a direct
role in resolving infection by (1) blocking pathogen entry
into cells (neutralization) and (2) recruiting cytotoxic molecules and cytotoxic cells to kill pathogen (via complement
fixation, opsonization, and ADCC).
Neutralization
Most viruses and some bacteria gain entry into a cell by
binding specifically to one or more cell-surface proteins,
stimulating endocytosis. For example, the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) expresses a coat protein, gp120, that
specifically binds the CD4 coreceptor. The influenza virus
expresses a protein, hemagglutinin, that binds to sugarmodified proteins on epithelial cells. Antibodies that bind
such proteins are particularly potent effector molecules
because they can prevent a pathogen from ever initiating an
infection. They are referred to as neutralizing antibodies.
Pathogens disarmed by neutralizing antibodies are typically
phagocytosed by macrophages.
Neutralizing antibodies can also block entry of toxins
into cells. For example, tetanus toxoid, a product of the Clostridium tetani bacteria, is a neurotoxin that can result in
uncontrolled muscle contraction and death. The tetanus vaccine contains an inactive version of this toxin that stimulates
B-cell production of anti-tetanus toxoid antibodies. These
antibodies bind and potently inhibit the entry of the toxin
into nerve cells. Neutralizing antibodies have also been
raised against snake venom toxins and are effective therapies
for some snakebites.
Physiologically, neutralization is the most effective
mode of protection against infection. However, because
microbes proliferate rapidly, they can generate genetic

functions. Antibody binding can enhance the clearance of pathogens by (1) binding to proteins that pathogens use to infect cells
(neutralization), (2) interacting with Fc receptors on the surface of
phagocytic cells and inducing internalization and degradation (opso-

nization), (3) recruiting complement proteins that can directly kill
pathogen or enhance its phagocytosis, and (4) binding to FcRs on
cytotoxic cells (e.g., NK cells) and directing their activity to infected
cells, tumor cells, and/or pathogens (antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity [ADCC]).

variants able to evade neutralizing antibodies. For example,
influenza viral variants expressing modified hemagglutinins that do not bind circulating antibodies have a distinct
reproductive advantage and can rapidly take over an infection. HIV is one of the most adept viruses at evading anti-

body responses. In theory, gp120 is an ideal target for
neutralizing antibodies; however, few individuals generate
such antibodies. This is in part because the region of gp120
that binds CD4 is concealed from the body until just before
viral entry.

TABLE 13-1

Ways antibodies can protect the host against invasion by pathogens

Mode of antibody-mediated protection

How it works

Neutralization

Antibody binds to sites on the pathogen or a toxin that interact with host proteins, masking
them, and inhibiting entry of that pathogen or toxin into the host. Antibody-pathogen complexes are then eliminated, often after phagocytosis.

Opsonization

Antibody binds to pathogen and is then bound by Fc receptors on phagocytic cells. The antibodyantigen binding to FcRs induces internalization and destruction by the phagocytic cell.

Complement fixation

The antibody-antigen complex becomes bound by complement components in serum and is
either phagocytosed via cells expressing C3 receptors or lysed as a result of pore formation
by the complement components C7, C8, and C9.

Antibody-dependent cell-mediated
cytotoxicity

Antibody-antigen complexes are bound by Fc receptors on NK cells and granulocytes, thus
directing the cytotoxicity of these cells toward the antigen targeted by the antibody (e.g.,
viral proteins on the surface of an infected cell), and inducing apoptosis of the target cell.

†

Opsonization
From the Greek word for “to make tasty,” opsonization
refers to the ability of antibodies to promote and/or enhance
the engulfment of antigens by phagocytes. Opsonizing antibodies coat antigen and interact with Fc receptors expressed
by phagocytic cells.
Thus, phagocytic cells of the innate immune system (e.g.,
macrophages and neutrophils) have two sets of receptors
capable of binding pathogens: they can bind them directly
using innate immune receptors (pattern recognition
receptors such as Toll-like receptors), or they can bind
antigens bound in immune complexes with antibodies, via
Fc receptors.
Innate immune receptors are important in activating
antigen-presenting cells and shaping the signals that they
will convey to lymphocytes (see Chapter 5 and Chapter 11).
Fc receptors also generate signals and regulate the effector
responses of innate immune cells (see below). In the case of
opsonization, binding of pathogen (antigen)-antibody complexes to an Fc receptor on phagocytes will induce internal-

ization of the complex and internal digestion of the pathogen
in lysosomes.
Complement Fixation
As we saw in Chapter 6, antigen-antibody complexes can
also induce a complement cascade. Specifically, when antibodies that associate with complement bind to the surface of
bacteria and some (enveloped) viruses, they can initiate a
cascade of reactions that results in the generation of the
membrane attack complex (MAC), perforating pathogen
membranes and killing the microbe. This capacity to stimulate complement-mediated membrane damage is referred to
as fixing complement and is a property of specific antibody
isotypes, including some IgGs and IgM.
Activation of the early part of the complement cascade can
also protect the host by opsonizing pathogens in an antibodyindependent manner. This complement function does not
require the later components (C4–C9) of the complement cascade. Instead, the complement protein fragment C3b, which is
produced early on in the complement reaction, binds to the

surface of the pathogen and is recognized by the many different blood cells that have C3b receptors. Binding of C3b on the
surface of a pathogen by a macrophage results in phagocytosis
and destruction of that pathogen by mechanisms similar to
those described above for antibody-mediated phagocytosis.
Interestingly, binding of C3b-bound pathogen by red blood
cells results in the delivery of the pathogens to the liver or
spleen, where the pathogen is removed from the red blood cell,
without affecting the viability of the red blood cell, followed by
phagocytosis of the pathogen by a macrophage.

are often pentavalent (bound together in groups of five) they
can be very effective in binding pathogen. Interestingly, most
circulating IgM antibodies come not from conventional B cells
but from B-1 cells, which constitutively produce IgM antibodies that appear to protect us from common pathogens, particularly those that can come from the gut and other mucosal areas.
IgM antibodies are very good at fixing complement and
efficiently induce lysis of pathogens to which they bind. They
are also good at forming dense antibody-pathogen complexes that are efficiently engulfed by macrophages.

Antibody-Dependent Cell-Mediated Cytotoxicity
Antibodies can recruit the activities of multiple cytotoxic cells,
including NK cells (lymphoid members of the innate immune
system) and granulocytes (myeloid members of the innate
immune system). Unlike cytotoxic T lymphocytes, these cells
do not express antigen-specific T-cell receptors. However,
they do express Fc receptors (specifically, FcRIII) and can
use these to “arm” themselves with antibodies that allow them
to “adopt” an antigen specificity. Antibodies bound to NK
cells then direct the cytotoxic activity to a specific cellular
target—for example, an infected cell that expresses viral
proteins on its surface or a tumor cell that expresses tumorspecific proteins on its surface (see Figure 13-1). This phenomenon, referred to as ADCC, is under intense investigation
because of its therapeutic potential. Monoclonal antibodies
(mAbs) developed as cancer treatments are thought to act in
part by taking advantage of ADCC mechanisms and directing
NK cytotoxicity toward tumor cell targets (see Clinical Focus
Box 13-1). As with complement fixation, the ability to mediate
ADCC is antibody-isotype dependent, and murine IgG2a and
human IgG1 are most potent in this capacity (see below).

Effector Functions of IgG Antibodies
IgG antibodies are the most common antibody isotype in the
serum. They are also the most diverse, and include several
subclasses (IgG1, IgG2, IgG3, and IgG4 in humans; IgG1,
IgG2a, IgG2b, and IgG3 in mice), each of which has distinct
effector capabilities. All of the IgG variants bind to Fc receptors and can enhance phagocytosis by macrophages (opsonization). Human IgG1 and IgG3 are particularly good at
fixing complement. Mouse IgG2a and human IgG1 are particularly good at mediating ADCC by NK cells.
Specific IgG isotypes are also associated with disease
pathologies. For example, in a mouse lupus model, IgG2a
and IgG2b isotypes dominate. In human lupus, IgG1 and
IgG3 are involved in anti-DNA reactions, and IgG2 and IgG3
are associated with kidney dysfunction. Investigators are
making excellent use of our growing knowledge of IgG effector functions and are tailoring the isotypes of mAbs used in
therapies to enhance their effect. For example, IgG1 antibodies are most commonly used in tumor therapy because they
can both fix complement and mediate ADCC by NK cells.
However, recent data suggest that IgG2 is a potent mediator
of ADCC by myeloid cells (including neutrophils) and may
offer some therapeutic advantages.

Antibody Isotypes Mediate Different
Effector Functions
As you learned in Chapters 3 and 12, activated B cells develop
into plasma cells, which are remarkably productive antibodyproducing cellular factories. Antibody specificity is defined
by their Fab regions, and their isotype or class is defined by
their Fc region (see Figure 3-21). Depending on the type of T
cell help they received during activation, as well as the cytokines to which they were exposed, B cells will secrete one of
four major classes of antibody: IgM, IgG, IgA, or IgE.
Although immature B cells express IgD, little if any is secreted
and its function remains a bit of a mystery. The structure of
each of these antibodies is reviewed in detail in Chapter 3.
Each plays a distinct role in thwarting and clearing infection,
as described below and depicted in Figure 13-2.
Effector Functions of IgM Antibodies
IgM antibodies are the first class of antibodies to be produced
during a primary immune response. They tend to be lowaffinity antibodies because the B cells that produce them have
not gone through affinity maturation. However, because they

Effector Functions of IgA Antibodies
Although IgA antibodies are also found in circulation, they
are the major isotype found in secretions, including mucus
in the gut, milk from mammary glands, tears, and saliva. In
these secretions, IgA can neutralize both toxins and pathogens, continually interacting with the resident (commensal)
bacteria that colonize our mucosal surfaces and preventing
them from entering the bloodstream. Because IgA cannot fix
complement, these interactions do not induce inflammation,
which is advantageous given that IgA acts continually on
antigens and pathogens that typically pose no threat.
IgA’s half-life in secretions is relatively long because the
amino acid sequence of the Fc region is resistant to many of
the proteases that are present. Interestingly, several microbes,
including those that cause gonorrhea and strep infections,
produce proteases that do degrade IgA, allowing them to
evade this form of immune protection.
IgA does exist in monomeric form (particularly in circulation) but also forms dimers and polymers in mucosal
tissues. The dimeric and polymeric forms bind to receptors

Adaptive Immunity: Effector Responses

CLINICAL FOCUS

Monoclonal Antibodies in the Treatment of Cancer
Cancer is a disease in which a single
cell multiplies rapidly and uncontrollably
to form a tumor. As the tumor cells replicate, the DNA repair functions that normally ensure faithful replication of DNA
sequence during cell division may begin
to fail, and new mutations begin to accumulate, leading to a worsening prognosis.
Cancer remains one of the worst killers in
the developed world, and despite decades
of intensive and creative work by research
scientists and clinicians, a diagnosis of
cancer is still followed all too frequently by
a shortened life span, preceded by a
course of weakening and toxic treatment.
Attempts to develop effective anticancer drug strategies have had to address
two main problems. First, because many
cancer cells are derived from self and do
not “look” too different from healthy cells,
any drug that binds to the cancer cell is
likely also to bind and enter the patient’s
other, healthy cells. The trick is to find a
molecule on the surface of a cancer cell
that is either not expressed in normal
cells, or is expressed at much lower concentrations in normal cells compared to
cancer cells, and then to design a drug
that will preferentially bind to the malignant cell. Second, because cancer cells
and normal dividing cells use the same
metabolic strategies to generate ATP, any
untargeted drug that affects the metabolism or growth of a cancer cell will also
affect normal dividing cells.
Most of the first generation of anticancer drugs, however, are focused on inhibiting cancer cell division. Drugs such as
daunorubicin, cis-platin, and others enter
all cells of the body and interfere with the
process of cell division. As mentioned
above, such drugs will also target cells
that divide normally as part of their dayto-day function, and the patient’s wellbeing will be compromised not only by
the tumor they carry, but also by the treatment they endure. Cells of the alimentary
tract, skin, hair follicles, and immune system all divide more frequently than others
such as the liver, kidney, and brain and

tend to be more sensitive to these drugs.
This is why conventional chemotherapy
leads to hair loss, digestive distress, and
impaired immune function.
The development of monoclonal antibodies, with their extraordinary capacity to
target a single 6- to 8-amino-acid length of
a protein was seized upon by scientists as a
potential opportunity to specifically target
tumor cells, while leaving the neighboring
healthy cells undamaged. Immunotherapeutics, the production and refinement of
mAbs that will specifically target cancer
cells for death and healthy neighbors, is a
burgeoning field. Now part of the therapeutic arsenal, mAbs have met with some
success. Some examples of current
reagents and their mechanisms of action
are described below.
How Do Antibodies Kill Cancer Cells?

that may be necessary to allow growth
of that cell. For example, many tumor
cells become dependent for their
growth on binding of specific growth
factors such as Epidermal growth factor
(EGF). Several of the mAbs currently in
clinical use, such as erbitux, bind to the
EGF receptor (EGFR) and interfere with
its function. Herceptin is an example of
an extremely successful drug that targets the Her-2 EGFR on advanced
breast cancer cells. All EGFRs must
dimerize on binding to EGF so that
they can send their growth signal to
the nucleus. Herceptin interferes with
this dimerization reaction and, so, interrupts the EGFR signal.
• Interference with the generation of new
blood vessels. Another group of drugs,
including bevacizumab (Avastin), targets activity of vascular endothelial
growth factor (VEGF). VEGF interacts
with VEGF receptors (VEGFR1 and
VEGFR2) located on blood vessels.
Binding stimulates the formation of

new blood vessels that can be used to
supply the nascent tumor cells with
nutrients. Avastin binds to VEGF and
prevents it from interacting with its
receptors, thereby inhibiting the
development of new blood vessels
and compromising tumor growth.
• Direct binding to receptors with induction of apoptosis. Some mAbs, such as
rituximab (Rituxan), may kill their target cells by binding to the surface of
the cell and mimicking the binding of
natural ligands. Binding of rituximab to
follicular B lymphoma cells results in
interference with cell cycle regulation
and the induction of apoptosis.
• Induction of ADCC. Binding of certain
isotypes of antibodies to the surface of
a cell results in the induction of antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC). If a tumor cell becomes
coated with antibodies of human IgG1
or IgG3 subclasses, FcRIII molecules
on the surface of natural killer (NK)
cells and other immune cells will bind
to the Fc regions of these antibodies.
Once bound to the NK cell, the tumor
cell becomes the target of secreted
perforin and granzymes, which induce
apoptosis in the affected cell. In addition, macrophages will recognize the
Fc portion of antibody clusters of the
IgG1 isotype that are bound to a cell
surface, and be induced to phagocytose the antibody-cell complex and/or
release toxic metabolites.
• Induction of complement fixation. IgG3
and IgG1 antibody binding to the surface of a cell can also result in the attachment (fixation) of a set of serum proteins
known as the complement cascade to
the cell surface. By a complex set of
reactions detailed in Chapter 6, this can
result in either the dissolution of the cell
following disruption of the integrity of
its membrane, or enhanced phagocytosis of that cell by macrophages.
• Delivery of toxins. Very early on in the
development of mAbs as clinical tools,

scientists began modifying them with
toxins such as radioactive isotopes and

anything bound by the conjugated
antibody and the immuno-conjugates
Zevalin and Bexxar were approved for
use in humans for the treatment of
relapsed or refractory non-Hodgkin’s
lymphoma in 2002 and 2003, respectively. Other toxins that have been studied in the lab and/or used in the clinic
include modified bacterial toxins such
as Pseudomonas exotoxin A, which has
been conjugated to an mAb directed
toward the CD22 molecule and has
proven promising in the treatment of
chemoresistant hairy cell leukemia.
Ricin, another bacterial toxin, has also

been successfully conjugated with antibodies directed toward CD22 and
CD19, and these molecules are currently being developed for the treatment of pediatric and acute
lymphoblastic leukemia.
Currently, scientists are working to
improve the biological efficacy of the antibodies employed in cancer treatment by
subjecting proven antibodies to mutation
in vitro followed by selection using phage
display technology to improve the affinity
and selectivity of binding to tumor cells.
Others are combining multiple antibodies
with different specificity to the same cell in
a single treatment, or combining mAbs
with more conventional chemotherapeutic approaches. The Human Genome Project has provided a wealth of information

regarding the number and structure of
cell-surface signaling molecules, and it is
also being exploited in the design of novel
drugs and toxins, including antibodies and
antibody fragments.

come in a variety of types and are expressed by many different cell
types. Some of their major functions are illustrated here. (a) When
bound by IgE-pathogen (e.g., worm) complexes, FcRs expressed
by granulocytes can induce the release of histamine and proteases
(degranulation). (b) When bound by antibody-pathogen complexes, FcR and FcR can induce macrophage activation and
phagocytosis. (c) The neonatal FcR (FcRn) binds antibody that has
been nonspecifically engulfed by endothelial cells and returns the

antibody, intact, to the blood. (d) When bound by IgG antibodies
coating infected or tumor cells, FcRs activate the cytolytic activity
of natural (NK) cells. (e) PolyIg receptors (PolyIgR) expressed by the
inner (basolateral) surface of epithelial cells (facing the blood) will
bind dimers and multimers of IgA and IgM antibodies and transfer
them through the cell to their apical (outer) surface and into the
lumen of an organ (e.g., the GI tract). This is a process referred to as
transcytosis and is responsible for the accumulation of antibodies
in bodily secretions.

on epithelial cells, an event that triggers endocytosis and
transport of the molecules from the basolateral (inner) to the
apical (outer) sides of the epithelial cell and into the tissue
lumen (see Figure 13-2).
Two subclasses of IgA—IgA1 and IgA2—are found in
humans. IgA1 is more prevalent in the serum (and typically
monomeric), and IgA2 is more prevalent in secretions. Both
isotypes can mediate ADCC by binding FcRs on NK T cells,
and both can trigger degranulation of granulocytes.

lysis, many of the effector functions of the antibodies described
above depend on their ability to interact with receptors on cells
in the innate and adaptive immune systems as well as cells in
various epithelial and endothelial tissues. These antibody receptors were originally discovered over 40 years ago by early antibody biochemists, who referred to them as Fc receptors because
they bound specifically to the Fc portion of the antibody.
FcRs allow nonspecific immune cells to take advantage of
the exquisite specificity of antibodies to focus their cellular
functions on specific antigens and pathogens. They also
provide a physical bridge between the humoral and cellmediated immune systems. When bound by antibody alone,
FcRs do not trigger signals; however, when cross-linked by
multiple antibody-antigen complexes, FcRs initiate effector
responses (see Figure 13-2).
The diversity of FcRs, most of which are members of the
immunoglobulin superfamily (Figure 13-3), is now fully
appreciated. Each differs by (1) the antibody class (isotype)
to which they bind (e.g., FcRs bind to several IgG isotypes,
FcRs bind to the IgE isotype, and FcRs bind to IgA isotypes), (2) the cells that express them (macrophages, granulocytes, NK cells, T and B cells), and (3) their signaling
properties. Together these properties define a distinct effector function that an antibody can inspire (Table 13-3).

Effector Functions of IgE Antibodies
IgE antibodies are best known for their role in allergy and
asthma. However, research suggests that they play an important role in protection against parasitic helminths (worms)
and protozoa. They are made in very small quantities but
have a very potent effect, inducing degranulation of eosinophils and basophils, and release of molecules such as histamine that do permanent damage to a large pathogen.

receptors. The antibody-binding polypeptides are shown in blue
and, where present, accessory signal-transducing polypeptides are
shown in green. Most FcRs are activating receptors and are associated with signaling proteins that contain the Immuno-receptor
Tyrosine Activation Motif (ITAM) or include ITAM(s) in their own intracellular regions. FcRIIB is an inhibiting FcR and includes an Immunoreceptor Tyrosine Inhibition Motif (ITIM) in its intracellular region. All

FcRs shown in this figure are members of the immunoglobulin supergene family; their extracellular regions include two or more immunoglobulin folds. These molecules are expressed on the surface of
various cell types as cell-surface antigens and, as indicated in the
figure, some have been assigned cluster of differentiation (CD) designations (for clusters of differentiation, see Appendix 1). [Adapted from

For example, antibody-antigen complexes binding to FcRs
on eosinophils and other granulocytes trigger the release of
histamine and proteases from granules (degranulation). FcRs
and FcRs on macrophages trigger a signaling cascade that
induces the internalization of the pathogen into a phagocyte,
which can destroy it via a variety of mechanisms, including
oxidative damage, enzyme digestion, and membrane-disrupting
effects of antibacterial peptides. “Neonatal” FcR (FcRn)

molecules on cells that line the bloodstream help maintain
antibody levels in serum by protecting them from degradation. Other FcRs expressed by cytotoxic cells, including NK
cells, trigger a cascade that results in the release of granule
contents that will cause the death of targeted cells (ADCC).
And FcRs expressed by epithelial cells trigger the passage of
antibodies from one side of a cell to another—from the
bloodstream to the gut, for instance.

Effector Responses: Cell- and Antibody-Mediated Immunity
Interestingly, some FcRs do not stimulate effector
responses but, rather, inhibit cell activity. Indeed, a cell can
express varying levels of both activating and inhibiting FcRs.
The cell’s response is determined by the balance between the
positive and negative signals it receives when antibodyantigen complexes bind these two types of receptors. We will
discuss these events in more detail below, where we describe
the function of individual classes of FcRs.

CHAPTER 13

425

FcR Signaling
A single antibody will not activate an Fc receptor; instead
multiple FcRs need to be cross-linked or oligomerized by
binding to the multiple antibodies coating a single pathogen.
This cross-linking results in the generation of either a positive or a negative signal that enhances or suppresses the
effector function of that cell.
Whether engagement of an FcR generates positive or
negative signals depends on whether that FcR is associated
with an ITAM or an ITIM, respectively (see Figure 13-3).
Although some activating FcRs include their own ITAM

motif in their cytoplasmic region, many do not and, instead,
associate at the membrane with a common gamma () chain,
which provides the services of an ITAM motif to the stimulating receptor complex.
The ITAM amino acid sequence is a common activating
motif found in many signaling complexes. Recall that ITAM
motifs are found in the cytoplasmic domains of TCR and
BCR antigen-receptor associated molecules (CD3 molecules, Ig, and Ig; see Chapter 3). They are also features of
NK cell receptors. What makes these motifs so useful? As
you know from Chapter 3, they act as substrates for tyrosine
kinases, which are recruited after receptor engagement. Figure 13-4 provides an example of signaling pathways downstream of one activating FcR (FcRIII) and illustrates their
similarity to BCR signaling. Antibody-antigen engagement
recruits tyrosine kinases lyn (or lck), phosphorylating
ITAMs, which, in this case, are expressed by an associated
pair of common  chains. The tyrosine kinase Syk is
recruited to the phosphorylated ITAMs and phosphorylates
the Btk kinase, which enhances the activity of PLC. PLC

receptors recruits a tyrosine kinase (e.g., lyn), which phosphorylates
the ITAMs associated with -chains (in the case of FcRs) or Ig and Ig
(in the case of B cells). Phosphorylation allows the tyrosine kinase Syk

to dock, bringing it into proximity with other activating molecules
including adapter proteins (not shown) and Btk, another kinase. Btk
can activate the phospholipase PLC ,which generates two important
second messengers, DAG and IP3. These and other signals initiated by
receptor binding result in cell activation and effector functions (some
of which are illustrated in Figure 13-2). Inhibitory FcR signaling (not
shown) recruits phosphatase activity that can antagonize these signals by removing the activating phosphate groups.

Adaptive Immunity: Effector Responses

generates the potent second messengers DAG and Ca2.
These events and others that are not illustrated in this simple
diagram result in activation of the FcR-expressing cell. In
this case, the cell is a macrophage, and the signaling pathways stimulate and enhance its phagocytic capacity, and can
induce expression and secretion of cytokines (e.g., the
inflammatory cytokines TNF, IL-1, and IL-6). Although
the general signaling pathways are similar, the precise consequences of FcR signaling differ depending on the receptor
that is activated, the versions of downstream signaling
enzymes that are present, and the genes that are accessible in
the specific cell type that is stimulated.
ITIMs are found in the intracellular regions of the FcRII
receptor, the main inhibitory receptor among the FcR family.
As you may remember from Chapter 9, ITIMs are also found
in the intracellular region of the inhibitory costimulatory
molecule CTLA-4 on T cells. These motifs associate not with
kinases, but with phosphatases, such as SHIP, which help to
assemble complexes that inhibit signaling cascades, in part
by dephosphorylating what was phosphorylated by activating signals (see Figure 13-4).
The role of activating Fc receptors is not difficult to appreciate. A classic example is provided by the FcR, which is
expressed on mast cells and eosinophils. Once bound to
pathogen (e.g., a parasitic worm), IgE will bind and crosslink FcR, activating a cascade that causes degranulation and
the release of histamine and other proinflammatory molecules. Similarly, binding of human IgG1 to FcRI receptors
on NK cells will stimulate the release of pro-apoptotic molecules from NK cells (see below).
But what is the role of inhibitory FcRs? It turns out that
they are critically important in tuning the threshold of activation of a cell. Specifically, they can make it harder for that
cell to be activated by low-level signals. FcRIIB, the main
inhibitory FcR, binds to several different IgG isotypes and is
expressed by many cell types, including dendritic cells.
When bound by antibody-antigen complexes, it sends negative signals that block activation and maturation of a dendritic cell. This appears to prevent the dendritic cell from
becoming activated “spontaneously” by low levels of antibodyantigen complexes that may always be circulating in the
serum. Therefore, in order to be activated, this dendritic cell
will need to receive signals from other receptors (e.g., TLRs
and other PRRs) that are strong enough to overcome the
inhibitory signals—an appealing way to determine how
authentic an infection may be. Experimental evidence supports this perspective. Dendritic cells in FcRIIB-deficient
mice, in fact, trigger T-cell responses at lower antigen
thresholds. FcRIIB deficient mice also develop autoimmunity, suggesting that negative signals play an important role
in maintaining immune tolerance.
Interestingly, cells can co-express both inhibitory and
activating FcRs and tune their response according to their
integration of positive and negative signals. Which FcRs a
cell expresses depends on the signals that the cell receives
during an immune response. For instance, TGF and IL-4

up-regulate the expression of inhibitory FcRs, whereas
inflammatory cytokines (TNF and IFN) up-regulate the
expression of some activating FcRs.
FcRs
FcRs are the most diverse group of FcRs and are the main
mediators of antibody functions in the body. Expressed by a
wide range of cells, they bind antibodies of the IgG class, often
several different IgG subclasses. Most are activating receptors
and can induce phagocytosis if expressed by a macrophage as
well as degranulation if expressed by cytotoxic cells.
The four families of FcR (FcRI [CD64], FcRII [CD32],
FcRIII [CD16], and FcRIV) are conserved across mammals. Three of these, FcRI, FcRIII, and FcRIV, are activating receptors and vary in their binding affinities and cellular
expression. FcRI binds to antibodies with high affinity, and
prefers to bind to IgG2a in mouse, and IgG1 and IgG3 in
humans. FcRIII binds with lower affinity to several IgG isotypes. Most immune cells, except mature T cells, express both
of these receptors. NK cells only express FcRIII.
FcRIV was discovered only recently. Investigators wishing
to study the role of FcRs in immune responses developed
mice where the two major FcRs, RI and RIII, were absent.
They were puzzled when IgG antibodies still exhibited effector
functions, but recognized that this probably meant mice
expressed other, as yet unidentified, FcRs. Indeed, they
found a new protein, FcRIV, expressed exclusively on innate
immune cells (including dendritic cells, macrophages, and
neutrophils), which bound IgG antibodies with high affinity.
This receptor also shows an isotype preference, binding best
to murine IgG2a and IgG2b. Its human equivalent may be
FcRIIIA, although recent data suggest that it also binds IgE
and functionally resembles one of the human FcRs (FcRI).
As we saw above, FcRIIB (CD32) is the major inhibiting
FcR and is expressed on all immune cells except mature T
and NK cells. When bound, it generates inhibiting signals that
increase the activation threshold of a cell, helping to prevent B
cells and macrophages from responding too much to too little
stimulation. In its absence, mice more susceptible to autoantibody production and can develop a lupus-like disease.
FcR
The Fc receptor (CD89) is expressed by myeloid cells,
including monocytes, macrophages, granulocytes, and dendritic cells. Like many activating FcRs, Fc contributes to
pathogen destruction by triggering ADCC, and phagocytosis. When engaged by IgA, it stimulates myeloid cells to
release inflammatory cytokines and generate superoxide free
radicals, which help kill internalized pathogens. It has also
been found in a soluble form, which binds circulating IgA.
IgA can also be bound by the polyIgR described below.
FcR
FcRs are expressed by granulocytes, including mast cells,
eosinophils, and basophils and, when bound by IgE, trigger

c13EffectorResponsesCellandAntibody-MediatedImmunity.indd Page 427 12/20/12 3:38 PM user-t044

Effector Responses: Cell- and Antibody-Mediated Immunity
a signaling cascade that releases histamine, proteases, and
other inflammatory mediators. They are most often associated with allergy symptoms, which arise when an antigen
induces an IgE response. Their physiologic function has been
contested, but most agree that they evolved as part of our
immune response to parasitic worms. Two types of FcR are
recognized: the high-affinity FcRI that is similar in structure to most activating FcRs and is expressed by mast cells,
eosinophils, and basophils; and the lower-affinity FcRII
(CD23) that is a member of the C-type lectin family, not the
immunoglobulin supergene family. This low-affinity form is
expressed by B cells and eosinophils, and its function is still
under investigation (see Chapter 15).
pIgR
The polymeric immunoglobulin receptor (PolyIgR) is
expressed by epithelial cells and has a unique function. It
initiates the transport of IgA and IgM from blood to the
lumen (the inside) of multiple tissues, including the GI,
respiratory, and reproductive tracts (see Figure 13-2e). This
is the FcR responsible for carrying antibodies into tears and
milk, and for populating our gut mucosa with IgA antibodies
that protect us from the invasion of microbes and toxins that
we ingest.
FcRn
Although the neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn) can be considered
another FcR, it is unique in structure and function. Related
to MHC class I, it, too, associates with 2-microglobulin.
Expressed on the surface of many different cell types,
including epithelial and endothelial cells, it binds not only
to IgG, but also to albumin, inhibiting the degradation of
both molecules. FcRn is responsible for carrying antibodies
ingested from mother’s milk across epithelial cells of an
infant’s intestine to the bloodstream—the opposite direction of the antibodies carried by polyIgR. Even though its
expression levels drop after an animal is weaned, FcRn still
plays an important role in managing intestinal infections
and can transport antibody-pathogen complexes from the
intestinal lumen into mucosal immune tissue where antigen
can be processed and presented to T cells. FcRn can also
augment the role of pIgR (which carries IgA into organ
secretions) and carry IgG antibodies into milk and GI and
respiratory secretions. When expressed on phagocytes, it
can also play a more conventional role: stimulating internalization and destruction of pathogens.
Perhaps, however, one of the most important roles of
FcRn in adult animals is to maintain levels of circulating
IgG and albumin. Endothelial cells can take proteins up
nonspecifically by pinocytosis. Under ordinary circumstances these proteins would be degraded in acidic lysosomes. However, endothelial cells also express FcRns, which
bind tightly to antibodies and albumin within the acid
environment of the lysosomes. They sort these important
proteins into vesicles that are carried back to the blood-

stream, where the higher pH of blood permits their release
(see Figure 13-2c).
Visualizing Antibody and FcR Effector Responses
We can now visualize effector antibody activity in the context
of an immune response. In summary, after infection B cells
encounter pathogen and their proteins in the secondary
lymphoid organs. Those that bind antigen are activated, and
if they receive T-cell help differentiate into antibody-producing plasma cells, either immediately or after undergoing
somatic mutation and isotype (class) switching in the germinal center. The isotypes produced by plasma cells depend on
the timing of the response (early versus late) and the nature
of the pathogen. A single infection can induce the production of antibodies with the same specificity but multiple
isotypes.
Plasma cells release antibody into the bloodstream from
a number of vantage points, including the medulla of a
lymph node, the sinuses of a spleen, and the bone marrow.
IgM antibodies, produced early in the response, may find
pathogen in the bloodstream and initiate the complement
cascade, lysing that pathogen directly. It can also be carried
by polyIgRs to the lumens of other tissues and bind pathogens there, generating antibody-antigen complexes that can
be engulfed by macrophages. IgG antibodies, produced later
in the response, will not only fix complement and opsonize
pathogen, but can be transported into tissues to interact with
innate cells that express FcRs (e.g., neutrophils), enhancing
their inflammatory activity. Whereas extracellular pathogens
bias B-cell class switching to isotypes that can fix complement and opsonize pathogen, intracellular pathogens bias
B-cell class switching to antibodies that can recruit cytotoxic
cells, including NK T cells, which empty their apoptosisinspiring contents and kill an infected cell (ADCC). This
arm of the immune system is the topic of the next section of
the chapter.

Cell-Mediated Effector Responses
Cytotoxic effector cells include the CD8 cytotoxic T cells of
the adaptive immune system, NKT lymphocytes, which
bridge the innate and adaptive immune systems, and NK
cells, which were once associated strictly with the innate
immune system but share intriguing functional features with
their adaptive immune lymphocyte relatives. CTL, NKT, and
NK effectors all induce cell death by triggering apoptosis in
their target cells. Not only do these cytotoxic cells eliminate
targets infected with intracellular pathogens (virus and bacteria), but they also play a critical role in eliminating tumor
cells and cells that have been stressed by extreme temperatures or trauma (Table 13-4). NK cells also play a less desirable role in rejecting cells from allogeneic organ transplants.
Essentially, the cell-mediated immune response is prepared
to recognize and attack any cell that exhibits “non-self ” or
“altered-self ” characteristics.

Cytotoxic T Lymphocytes Recognize

Receptor Activation
The importance of cytotoxic T lymphocytes in the cellmediated immune response to pathogens is underscored by
the pathologies that afflict those defective in T-cell generation. Children with DiGeorge syndrome are born without a
thymus and therefore lack the T-cell component of the cellmediated immune system. They are generally able to cope
with extracellular bacterial infections, but cannot effectively
eliminate intracellular pathogens such as viruses, intracellular bacteria, and fungi. The severity of the cell-mediated
immunodeficiency in these children is such that even the
attenuated virus present in a vaccine, which is capable of
only limited growth in normal individuals, can produce lifethreatening infections.
T-cell-mediated immune responses can be divided into
two major categories according to the different effector
populations that are mobilized: cytotoxic T cells and helper
T cells. The differentiation and activity of helper T cell subsets was discussed in detail in Chapter 11. Here, we focus
on the immune response mediated by cytotoxic T lymphocytes (Tc cells or CTLs), which can be divided into two
phases. In the first phase, naïve TC cells undergo activation
and differentiation into functional effector CTLs within secondary lymphoid tissue. In the second phase, effector CTLs
recognize class I MHC-antigen complexes on specific target
cells in the periphery, an event that ultimately induces the
destruction of the target cells. CTLs are predominantly
CD8 and are therefore class I MHC restricted. Since virtually all nucleated cells in the body express class I MHC molecules, a CTL can recognize and eliminate almost any cell in
the body that displays the specific antigen recognized by that
CTL in the context of a class I MHC molecule.
As you have learned from Chapter 11, differentiation of a
naïve CD8 T cell into an effector cytotoxic T cell involves
interaction with class I MHC-peptide complexes on activated
dendritic cell as well as help from TH1 or TH17 effector CD4
T cells. This help is provided both indirectly, via the ability of
CD4 T cells to enhance dendritic cell function, and directly,
via the release of cytokines by helper CD4 T cells.

Effector CTL Generation from CTL Precursors
Naïve TC cells are incapable of killing target cells and are
therefore also referred to as CTL precursors (CTL-Ps) to
denote their functionally immature state. Only after a
CTL-P has been activated does the cell differentiate into a
functional CTL with cytotoxic activity. The threshold to
activate CTLs from CTL-Ps is high compared to that of
other effector T cells and appears to require at least three
signals (Figure 13-5):

•

An antigen-specific signal transmitted by the TCR complex upon recognition of a class I MHC-peptide complex on a “licensed” APC (licensing is explained below)

•

A costimulatory signal transmitted by the CD28-CD80/86
(B7) interaction of the CTL-P and the licensed APC

•

A signal induced by the interaction of IL-2 with the
high-affinity IL-2 receptor, resulting in proliferation and
differentiation of the antigen-activated CTL-P into effector CTLs (IL-2 can be generated by helper T cells as well
as by the CD8 T cell itself.)

Differentiation of a CTL-P is initiated by its recognition
of antigen on an APC presented in the context of a class I
MHC molecule, but other factors are also required. For
CTL-Ps to mature into cytotoxic cells they need to interact
with a licensed APC. An APC can be licensed in several
ways—by a CD4 helper T cell (TH) of the TH1 or TH17
subtype—or by engagement with microbial products, which
activate Toll-like receptors. There is no absolute requirement
for CD4 T-cell help at this interval.
In contrast, CD4 T cell help is absolutely required for
the development of effective CD8 T-cell memory and for
an optimal proliferative burst of functional T cells. This was
demonstrated by examining the behavior of CTLs in class II
MHC deficient mice that could not generate CD4 T cells.
These mice generated functional CTLs in response to a primary infection, and even developed cells with memory phenotypes. However, the CTLs were not able to mount a
secondary response, demonstrating that in the absence of
CD4 T cell help, functional memory CTLs did not develop.
What does a CD4 T cell provide that is so important for
optimal activation of a CD8 T cell? Recall from Chapter 11

FIGURE 13-5 Generation of effector CTLs. The differentiation of a naïve CD8 T cell (a precursor CTL) into a functional CTL
requires several events. The precursor CTL must engage class I MHCpeptide complexes and costimulatory ligands on a “licensed” antigen-presenting cell (dendritic cell). Licensing of dendritic cells
occurs either through engagement with an activated, CD40L
helper T cell (e.g., a TH1 or TH17 helper cell) or through engagement
with pathogens (e.g., via Toll-like receptors). For optimal proliferation
and memory generation, CD4 T-cell help is required. CD4 T-cell

help can be given prior to CTL engagement of the dendritic cell as
depicted in (a). Alternatively, it can be given at the same time as the
precursor CTL engages the dendritic cell (b). Simultaneous engagement of a dendritic cell by both helper CD4 and precursor CD8 T
cells would allow optimal delivery of IL-2 generated by helper CD4
T cells. In response to TCR stimulation, precursor CTLs begin to upregulate expression of the IL-2 receptor (and begin to make more of
their own IL-2). IL-2 is critical for successful differentiation into a functional CTL.

that helper T cells generate cytokines (e.g., IFN-) that activate antigen-presenting cells. However, activated helper T
cells also express CD40 ligand (CD40L, also known as
CD154), a member of the TNF family of proteins, which
provides an all-important costimulatory signal to the APC.
CD40L interacts with CD40, a TNF receptor family member
expressed by activated professional APCs. When engaged,
CD40 initiates a signaling cascade within the APC that
increases the expression of costimulatory ligands (CD80 and
CD86), chemokines, and cytokines, significantly enhancing
the APC’s ability to activate the CD8 T cell (see Figure 13-5).
Investigators envision an interaction among three cells
that results in CD8 T-cell activation: the TH cell, which

interacts with and further activates an APC, which, in turn,
interacts with and activates the CTL-P cell (see Figure
13-5a). In fact, fluorescent-imaging studies have provided
direct evidence for the formation of dendritic cell/CD4
T-cell/CD8 T-cell complexes during the T-cell response to
viral antigen (see Figure 13-5b and Chapter 14).
It is important to realize, however, that the interactions
between the dendritic cell and the two different T cells may
not have to be concurrent; rather, a dendritic cell “licensed”
by a TH cell could retain its capacity to activate CTL-Ps for
some period after the TH cell disengages. In this case, specific
TH cells could move on to activate other dendritic cells,
amplifying the activation response.

Adaptive Immunity: Effector Responses

CTL development is accompanied by several changes.
Precursor CTLs do not express the high-affinity IL-2 receptor alpha chain (CD25), nor do they produce much IL-2.
They do not proliferate, and do not display cytotoxic activity.
A successfully activated CTL begins to express granzyme B
and perforin, the proteins that are packaged into lytic granules and induce death of the target cell. They also up-regulate
the IL-2 receptor and begin to produce IL-2, the principal
cytokine required for full proliferation and differentiation of
effector CTLs. The importance of IL-2 in CTL function is
underscored in IL-2 knockout (KO) mice, which are markedly deficient in CTL-mediated cytotoxicity.
CTLs are potentially very dangerous to an organism and
the stringent requirements for activation help prevent
unwanted destruction. Thus, the requirement that both TH
and TC cells recognize antigen before the TC cell is optimally
activated provides a safeguard against inappropriate selfreactivity by cytotoxic cells. The fact that the IL-2 receptor
is not expressed until after a naïve CD8 T cell has been
activated by T-cell receptor engagement also ensures that
only the antigen-specific CTL-Ps proliferate and become
cytotoxic.
The Importance of Cross-Presentation
in CTL Activation
Regardless of whether activation of a CD8 T cell occurs via
sequential or simultaneous cellular interactions, the APC
involved must be able to present antigens from the infecting
pathogen to both MHC class II restricted CD4 TH cells and
MHC class I restricted TC cells. This capacity initially puzzled
immunologists. Strictly speaking, shouldn’t antigens from
intracellular pathogens (the principal target of CTLs) only be
presented by MHC class I? Even more importantly, what if the
viral pathogen doesn’t even infect dendritic cells (surely, many
of them won’t)? How can it process and present antigens from
microbes that don’t naturally infect antigen-presenting cells?
The phenomenon of antigen cross-presentation (see Chapter  8) as well as the ability of dendritic cells to endocytose
antigen helped resolve these questions.
Recall that cross-presentation is the capacity of dendritic
cells to process and present exogenous antigens in both class I
and class II MHC molecules. Thus, even if dendritic cells
weren’t infected by a pathogen, they could engulf it, process it,
and present antigens in both MHC class II (by traditional
routes) and MHC class I (by cross-presentation). Those that
were infected would, of course, have the capacity to process
and present antigens in MHC class I via both traditional and
cross-presenting routes.
TC1 and TC2: Two Types of Effector CTLs
As you know from Chapter 11, CD4 effector T helper cells
can differentiate into several subtypes, each of which respond
to and secrete a distinct panel of cytokines. Effector CD8
cytotoxic cells are not as diverse, but can develop into two
distinct subtypes: TC1 and TC2. These subtypes loosely

resemble TH1 and TH2 cells in terms of the cytokines they
generate (see Figure 11-9) as well as the cytokines that promote their development. CTLs are biased toward production
of TC1 cells, which secrete IFN-, but no IL-4. In the presence of IL-4, CTLs develop into TC2 cells, which secrete
much more IL-4 and IL-5 than IFN-. Both subtypes are
potent killers, although TC1 cells can use both perforin and
Fas-mediated strategies (described below), whereas Tc2 cells
appear to only use perforin. Studies suggest that these two
subtypes play different roles in managing (and exacerbating)
disease, but results are not yet definitive to generate enough
confidence in one particular model.
Tracking of CD8 CTLs with MHC Tetramer
Technology
To fully understand the basis for a successful (and unsuccessful) immune response, immunologists realized that they
would need to be able to track the behavior of antigen-specific
lymphocytes in an organism. This was initially very difficult
because the frequency of antigen-specific lymphocytes is
quite low and ways to identify cells with known specificity
were crude at best. Even though antigen-specific cells proliferated in response to antigen, they still represented a minority of all lymphocytes in circulation, and their activities were
very difficult to tease apart from the activities of nonspecific
lymphocytes. Identifying rare antigen-specific memory cells
was essentially impossible. A novel and clever technology,
based on the use of MHC tetramers, was developed in the
1990s and made it possible to identify, isolate, and follow the
behavior of lymphocytes specific for an antigen of choice.
Now used routinely, MHC tetramer staining has been an
invaluable tool in our efforts to understand the complexities
of lymphocyte behavior in space and time.
MHC tetramers are laboratory-generated complexes of
four identical MHC molecules bound to four peptides and
linked to a fluorescent molecule (Figure 13-6). MHC class I
tetramers were generated first, but now MHC class II tetramers are also available. The MHC-peptide combination used
to generate these complexes depends on the antigen of interest. For example, one laboratory has developed tetramers
that include four HLA-A2 molecules (human MHC class I)
complexed with a peptide from HIV that is known to
stimulate a CTL response. A given MHC class I tetramerpeptide complex will bind only those CD8 T cells with
TCRs specific for that particular peptide-MHC complex.
Thus, when a particular MHC-peptide tetramer is added to
a diverse T-cell population, cells that bear TCRs specific for
the tetramer will bind and become fluorescently labeled.
These cells can then be traced using fluorescence microscopy
and flow cytometry. With these technologies, it is now possible to determine the number, locale, and phenotype of cells
in a population that have TCRs specific for that particular
antigen (that particular MHC-peptide combination) before,
during, and after an infection. Flow cytometry is sensitive
enough to detect antigen-specific T cells even when their
frequency in the CD8 population is as low as 0.1%.

FIGURE 13-6 MHC tetramers. A homogeneous population of
peptide-bound class I MHC molecules (e.g., HLA-A1 bound to an HIVderived peptide) is conjugated to biotin and mixed with fluorescently labeled streptavidin. In the ideal situation, four biotinylated
MHC-peptide complexes bind to the high-affinity binding sites of
fluorescent streptavidin to form a tetramer. Addition of the now fluorescent tetramer to a population of T cells results in binding of the
fluorescent tetramer only to those CD8 T cells with TCRs that are
specific for the peptide-MHC complexes of the tetramer. The subpopulation of T cells that are specific for the target antigen are now
fluorescently tagged, making them readily detectable by flow cytometry. [Adapted in part from P. Klenerman, V. Cerundolo, and P. R. Dunbar, 2002,
Tracking T cells with tetramers: New tales from new tools, Nature Reviews
Immunology 2:263.]

With this powerful tool one can directly measure the
increase in antigen-specific CD8 T cells in response to
exposure to pathogens such as viruses or cancer-associated
antigens, and trace their tissue distribution. For instance,
researchers infected mice with vesicular stomatitis virus
(VSV) and, using tetramer technology, examined all organs
for the presence of CD8 cells specific for a VSV-derived
peptide-MHC complex. This study demonstrated that during acute infection with VSV, VSV-specific CD8 cells
migrate away from the lymphoid system and are distributed
widely, with large numbers found in liver and kidney, but
antigen-specific cells virtually everywhere (Figure 13-7).
Follow-up studies show that, regardless of the original site of
infection, effector CD8 T cells distribute themselves
throughout the body.

ulations in vivo. Mice were infected with vesicular stomatitis virus
(VSV), and during the course of the acute stage of the infection cell
populations were isolated from the tissues indicated. These cells were
then incubated with fluorescent tetramers containing VSV-peptideMHC complexes. Flow-cytometric analysis allowed determination of
the percentages of CD8 T cells that were VSV specific in each of the
populations examined. [Adapted from P. Klenerman, V. Cerundolo, and P. R.
Dunbar, 2002, Tracking T cells with tetramers: New tales from new tools. Nature
Reviews Immunology 2:263.]

Tetramer-based studies have been exceptionally useful in
tracing the phenotype and fate of not just pathogen-specific
T cells, but also autoreactive T cells. For example, different
MHC/insulin-peptide tetramers were used to identify
insulin-reactive CD8 T cells in diabetic patients. Although
these studies are ongoing, some have shown that CD8 T cells
at the earliest stages of the disease respond to a different
insulin peptide than CD8 T cells at later stages of the disease. The investigators speculate that insulin therapy itself
may influence which autoreactive CD8 T cells become
dominant in the disease.
How CTLs Kill Cells
A CTL can kill a target in two major ways: either via the
directional release of granule contents or via a Fas-FasL
membrane signaling interaction. Rather than inducing cell
lysis, both of these processes induce the target cell to
undergo apoptosis, typically within a few hours of contact
with the cytotoxic cell.
Regardless of which method is employed, CTL killing
involves a carefully orchestrated sequence of events that
begins when the attacking cell binds to the target cell (Figure 13-8) and forms a cell-cell conjugate, an event so intimate

FIGURE 13-8 Stages in CTL-mediated killing of target
cells. T-cell receptors on a CTL interact with processed antigen-class
I MHC complexes on an appropriate target cell, leading to formation
of a CTL-target cell conjugate. The microtubule organizing center
(MTOC) polarizes to the site of interaction, repositioning the Golgi

that it is sometimes referred to as the “kiss of death.” Formation of a CTL-target cell conjugate is followed within several
minutes by a Ca2-dependent, energy-requiring step in
which, ultimately, the CTL induces death of the target cell.
The CTL then dissociates from the target cell and goes on to
bind another target cell.
The specific signaling events involved in establishing the
CTL-target interaction are very similar to those associated
with an activating T cell-APC interaction. The TCR-CD3
membrane complex on a CTL recognizes antigen in association with class I MHC molecules on a target cell, an event
that triggers the development of a highly organized immunological synapse (see Chapter 10) that is characterized by a
central ring of TCR molecules, surrounded by a peripheral
ring of adhesion molecules, formed primarily by interactions between the integrin receptor LFA-1 on the CTL membrane and the intracellular adhesion molecules (ICAMs) on
the target-cell membrane.
TCR signals directly enhance the adhesion between killer
and target by converting LFA-1 from a folded, low-affinity
state to an extended, high-affinity state (Figure 13-9a). This
change is a consequence of “inside-out signaling” where a
signal cascade (generated by the TCR but also by some cytokine and chemokine receptors) act on the intracellular portion of LFA-1, inducing a conformational change that

stacks and granules toward the point of contact with the target cell,
where the granules’ contents are released by exocytosis. After dissociation of the conjugate, the CTL is recycled and the target cell dies
by apoptosis. [Adapted from P. A. Henkart, 1985, Mechanism of lymphocytemediated cytotoxicity, Annual Review of Immunology 3:31.]

straightens out the extracellular region of LFA so that its
high-affinity face is accessible to ICAM. LFA-1 persists in its
high-affinity state for only 5 to 10 minutes after antigenmediated activation, and then it returns to the low-affinity
state. This downshift in LFA-1 affinity may facilitate dissociation of the CTL from the target cell.
The importance of TCR signals in promoting CTL adhesion was demonstrated by an experiment where purified
ICAM protein was coated onto plastic and the ability of resting CTLs versus TCR-stimulated CTLs to adhere was measured. As you can see from Figure 13-9b, more than 10 times
the number of TCR-stimulated CTLs (versus unstimulated
CTLs) bound to the ICAM-coated plastic. Antibodies that
could block the interaction between LFA-1 and ICAM abrogated the effect of TCR stimulation, showing that the adhesion was, in fact, LFA-1/ICAM specific.
Granzyme and Perforin Mediated Cytolysis Many CTLs
initiate killing of their targets via the delivery of pro-apoptotic
molecules. These molecules are packaged within granules
that can be visualized by microscopy (Figure 13-10). Investigators originally isolated CTL granules by subcellular
fractionation and showed that they could induce target-cell
damage directly. Analysis of their contents revealed 65-kDa
monomers of a pore-forming protein called perforin and

to bind to ICAM with high affinity. (b) The importance of TCR signaling in inducing LFA-1 mediated adhesion is illustrated by an experiment in which resting mouse CTLs were first incubated with
anti-CD3 antibodies. Cross-linkage of CD3 molecules on the CTL
membrane by anti-CD3 has the same activating effect as interaction
with antigen-class I MHC complexes on a target cell. Adhesion was
assayed by binding radiolabeled CTLs to microwells coated with
ICAM-1. Antigen activation increased CTL binding to ICAM-1 more
than 10-fold. The presence of excess monoclonal antibody to LFA-1
or ICAM-1 in the microwell abolished binding, demonstrating that
both molecules are necessary for adhesion. [Part (b) based on M. L. Dustin

several serine proteases called granzymes (fragmentins).
CTL-Ps lack cytoplasmic granules and perforin; however,
once activated, they begin to form cytoplasmic granules that
include perforin monomers and granzyme molecules.
Almost immediately after conjugate formation, CTL
granules containing granzyme and perforin are brought to
the site of interaction between a killer and target (see Figure 13-10) via the activity of the microtubule organizing
center (MTOC), which polarizes to this synapse in response
to TCR stimulation. The vesicles fuse with the outer membrane

and release perforin monomers and granzyme proteases into
the space at the junction between the two cells.
As the perforin monomers contact the target-cell membrane, they undergo a conformational change, exposing an
amphipathic domain that inserts into the target-cell membrane; the monomers then polymerize (in the presence of
Ca2⫹) to form cylindrical pores with an internal diameter of
5 to 20 nm (Figure 13-11a). A large number of perforin
pores are visible on the target-cell membrane in the region of
conjugate formation (Figure 13-11b). Perhaps not surprisingly, perforin exhibits some sequence homology with the
terminal C9 component of the complement system, and the
membrane pores formed by perforin are similar to those
observed in complement-mediated lysis. The importance of

Regardless of the mechanism of entry, once in the cytoplasm, granzyme initiates a cascade of reactions that result
in the fragmentation of the target-cell DNA into oligomers
of 200 base pairs (bp); this type of DNA fragmentation is
typical of apoptosis. Granzyme proteases do not directly
mediate DNA fragmentation. Rather, they activate an
apoptotic pathway within the target cell. This apoptotic
process does not require mRNA or protein synthesis in
either the CTL or the target cell. Within 5 minutes of CTL
contact, target cells begin to exhibit DNA fragmentation.
Interestingly, viral DNA within infected target cells has also
been shown to be fragmented during this process. This
observation shows that CTL-mediated killing not only kills
virus-infected cells but also can destroy the viral DNA in

Effector Responses: Cell- and Antibody-Mediated Immunity
those cells directly. The rapid onset of DNA fragmentation
after CTL contact may prevent continued viral replication
and assembly in the period before the target cell is
destroyed.
How do CTLs protect themselves from their own perforin and granzyme activity? Studies show that CTLs are more
resistant to the activities of granzyme and perforin than their
targets. The strategies they use are not fully understood, but
investigators have found that CTLs express high levels of
serine protease inhibitors (serpins), which protect them
from granzyme B activity. In support of the role of serpins in
protecting CTLs from their own pro-apoptotic functions,
CTLs do not survive in mice deficient for one of the most
common serpins expressed by CD8 T cells, Spi-1.
Fas-FasL Mediated Cytolysis Some potent CTL lines have
been shown to lack perforin and granzymes. In these cases,
cytotoxicity is mediated by Fas (CD95). As described in
Chapter 3, this transmembrane protein, which is a member
of the TNF-receptor family, can deliver a death signal when
cross-linked by its natural ligand, a member of the tumor necrosis factor family called Fas ligand (FasL). FasL is found
on the membrane of CTLs, and the interaction of FasL with
Fas on a target cell triggers apoptosis.
Fas mutations lead to multiple disorders in both mice and
humans. Mice that are homozygous for the lpr mutation
express little or no Fas on their cells, and have remarkably
large lymph nodes. In more rigorous terms, they are
afflicted with a lymphoproliferative disease characterized by
the accumulation of mature, activated T and B lymphocytes
in their lymph nodes. CTLs in lpr mutant mice can be
induced to express FasL; however, these CTLs cannot kill
targets, which express no Fas. These mice also develop autoimmune diseases, presumably because they kill autoreactive
lymphocytes that are activated during an immune response.
A very similar disorder, now known as autoimmune lymphoproliferative syndrome (ALPS or Canale-Smith syndrome), has been identified in human patients who have
genetic defects in Fas, Fas ligand, or Fas signaling pathways.
The critical importance of both the perforin and the FasFasL systems in CTL-mediated cytolysis was revealed by
experiments with two types of mutant mice: perforin KO
mice and the Fas deficient lpr strain (Figure 13-12). Investigators wanted to determine the relative importance of each
of these molecules and developed a system where they generated CTLs by co-culturing T cells from H-2b mice with
killed target cells from H-2k mice. CTLs generated in such
mixed lymphocyte reactions (see below) reacted strongly
against allogeneic MHC and could kill H-2k-expressing cells.
With this system, investigators first asked if CTLs could kill
target cells generated from lpr mice (which expressed no
Fas). In fact, they could, demonstrating that Fas-FasL
interactions were not absolutely required for CTL activity.
Next they asked if perforin was required and generated
CTLs from perforin KO mice. They found that these cells
could also kill targets, demonstrating that perforin wasn’t

CHAPTER 13

absolutely required. Finally, they asked if killing occurred in
the absence of both perforin and Fas-FasL interactions. They
generated CTL cells from perforin KO mice and determined
their ability to kill target cells from the Fas-deficient mice.
No killing was observed. These and other observations indicate that CTLs employ these and only these two methods—
perforin-mediated and Fas-mediated apoptosis—to kill their
targets.
Both the perforin and Fas-FasL killing strategies activate a signaling pathway in the target cell that induces apoptosis (Figure 13-13). A central feature of cell death by
apoptosis is the involvement of the caspase family of cysteine proteases, which cleave after an aspartic acid residue. The
term caspase incorporates each of these elements (cysteine,
aspartate, protease). Normally, caspases are present in the
cell as inactive proenzymes—procaspases—that require proteolytic cleavage for conversion to the active forms. Cleavage
of a procaspase produces an active caspase, which cleaves
other procaspases, thereby activating their proteolytic activity, which results in a cascade of events that systematically
disassembles the cell—the hallmark of apoptosis. More than
a dozen different caspases have been found, each with its
own specificity. They are typically divided into two categories: those that initiate the caspase cascade (initiator caspases) and those that directly initiate apoptosis (effector
caspases). See Chapter 9 for a more thorough discussion of
the apoptotic process.
What strategies do CTLs use to initiate caspase activation? The engagement of Fas on a target cell by Fas ligand on
a CTL first induces the activation of an initiator caspase in
the target cell. Fas is associated with a protein known as Fasassociated protein with death domain (FADD), which in
turn associates with procaspase-8 (see Figure 13-13a). Upon
Fas cross-linking, procaspase-8 is converted to caspase-8
and initiates an apoptotic caspase cascade.
The granzymes introduced into the target cell by a CTL
are proteolytic and have several targets (see Figure 13-13b).
They can directly cleave procaspase-3, an event that appears
to only partially activate this effector caspase. They can also
cleave bid, which induces mitochondrial release of cytochrome c and, ultimately, the activation of caspase-9. Both
activities appear to be required for optimal pro-apoptotic
activity.
The end result of both perforin-granzyme and Fasmediated pathways is, therefore, the activation of dormant
death pathways that are present in the target cell. As one
immunologist has so aptly put it, CTLs don’t so much kill
target cells as persuade them to commit suicide.

by accident when immunologists were measuring the cytolytic ability of lymphocytes isolated from mice with tumors.
They originally predicted that these lymphocytes would
exhibit a specific ability to kill the tumor cells to which they
had been exposed. To do their experiments they included
multiple controls, comparing the activity of these lymphocytes of interest with those taken from mice that had no
tumors, as well as mice that had unrelated tumors. Much to
their surprise, the investigators discovered that even the
control lymphocytes, which either had not been exposed to
any tumor or had been exposed to a very different type of
tumor, were able to kill the tumor cells of the first mouse. In
fact, the killing they were seeing did not seem to be following the rules of specificity that are the hallmark of a lymphocyte response to conventional antigens and pathogens.
Further study of this nonspecific tumor-cell killing
revealed that, in fact, neither T nor B lymphocytes were

involved at all. Instead, a population of larger, more granular
lymphocytes was responsible.
The cells, called “natural killer” cells for their nonspecific
cytotoxicity, make up 5% to 10% of the circulating lymphocyte population. Despite the absence of specific antigen
receptors (i.e., antibody, T-cell receptors), they play a major
role in immune defenses against infected cells, stressed
cells, and tumor cells. They can also contribute to autoimmunity when dysregulated. More versatile than originally
anticipated, NK cells also play a regulatory role in both
innate and adaptive immune responses to conventional
antigens by secreting cytokines that alter the immune
response. They have also recently been shown to be critically important for the development of a normal placenta,
not via their cytotoxic ability, but via their ability to recognize the presence of a different (paternal) MHC and initiate
the remodeling of blood vessels.

cleave and activate the pro-apoptotic bcl-2 family member bid,
which stimulates mitochondria to release cytochrome c, which

of caspase-3 are both required to initiate the caspase cascade
that leads to cell apoptosis. [Adapted from M. Barry and C. Bleackley,

Adaptive Immunity: Effector Responses

The importance of NK cells in our defense against infections is compellingly illustrated by the case of a young
woman with a disorder that resulted in a complete absence
of these cells. Even though this patient had normal T- and
B-cell counts, she suffered severe Varicella virus (chickenpox) infections and a life-threatening cytomegalovirus infection. We now know that NK cells are a critical first line of
defense against infection of intracellular pathogens (viruses
and some bacteria) by killing infected cells early and thereby
controlling pathogen replication during the 7 days it takes
precursors of CD8 cytolytic lymphocytes to develop into
functional CTLs. NK activity is stimulated by the innate
immune cytokines IFN-, IFN-, and IL-12, which all rise
rapidly during the early course of a viral infection. The wave
of NK cell activity peaks subsequent to this rise, about 3 days
after infection (Figure 13-14).
As indicated above, NK cells also produce an abundance
of immunologically important cytokines that can indirectly
but potently influence both innate and adaptive immune
responses. IFN- production by NK cells enhances the
phagocytic and microbicidal activities of macrophages. IFN-
derived from NK cells also influences the differentiation of
CD4 T helper subsets, inhibiting (for example) TH2 proliferation and stimulating TH1 development via induction of
IL-12 by macrophages and dendritic cells (see Chapter 11).
NK cells are potent enough that, in conjunction with
other protective mechanisms provided by the innate immune
system, they can protect animals totally lacking in adaptive
immunity. This is nicely illustrated by RAG-1 KO mice

peak, the virus titer (blue area) rapidly decreases.

healthy, active, and able to fend off many infections. These
animals do not fare nearly as well when NK cell development
is also impaired. Interestingly, humans appear to be more
dependent on their adaptive immune systems and suffer
more in their absence than their murine relatives.
Phenotype of NK Cells
Where do NK cells come from, and what do they look like?
NK cells are lymphoid cells derived from the common lymphoid progenitor (CLP) in the bone marrow. Although some
NK cells develop in the thymus, this organ is not required for
NK cell maturation. Nude mice, which lack a thymus and
have few or no T cells, have functional NK cell populations.
Unlike T cells and B cells, NK cells do not undergo rearrangement of receptor genes; NK cells still develop in mice
in which the recombinase genes RAG-1 or RAG-2 have been
knocked out. Consistent with this observation, NK cells are
also found in severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID)
mice, which have no T and B cells because of a defect in
enzymatic activity required for receptor rearrangement.
NK cells are quite heterogeneous. Different subpopulations can be distinguished based on differences in expression
and secretion of specific immunologically relevant molecules. Whether this heterogeneity reflects different stages in
their activation or maturation or truly distinct subpopulations remains unclear.
Most murine NK cells express CD122 (the 75-kDa  subunit of the IL-2 receptor), NK1.1 (a member of the NKR-P1
family), and CD49b (an integrin). NK cells also typically
express CD2 and FcRIII. In fact, cell depletion with monoclonal anti-FcRIII antibody removes almost all NK cells
from circulation. Human NK cells also express IL-2 receptors and FcRIII, but do not express NK1.1. Rather, they are
distinguished from other lymphocytes by CD56 expression,
which varies in intensity depending on the maturation and
activity state of an NK cell (CD56 high expressers tend to
produce cytokines and may differentiate into CD56 low
expressers, which exhibit more cytolytic activity).
Perhaps the most distinctive phenotypic characteristic of
NK cells is their expression of a set of unique activating and
inhibiting NK receptors (NKRs). These receptors are responsible for determining which targets NK cells will kill. Interestingly, NK cells from mice and humans use surprisingly
distinct receptors to accomplish the same thing; however,
the principles driving NK activation remain the same. In
addition, the number and type of activating and inhibitory
receptors expressed by NK cells vary widely, and the balance
of signals received through these receptors determines
whether NK cells induce death of their targets.
How NK Cells Recognize Targets: The Missing
Self Model
Because NK cells do not express antigen-specific receptors,
the mechanism by which these cells recognize tumor or
infected cells and distinguish them from normal body cells

c13EffectorResponsesCellandAntibody-MediatedImmunity.indd Page 439 12/20/12 3:38 PM user-t044

/Volumes/203/MHR00209/siL52070/disk1of1/0071052070

Effector Responses: Cell- and Antibody-Mediated Immunity
baffled immunologists for years. Klas Karre advanced an
interesting hypothesis that formed the foundations for our
understanding of how NK cells distinguish self from non (or
altered) self. He proposed that NK cells kill when they do not
perceive the presence of normal self-proteins on a cell, the
missing self model. The implied corollary to the proposal is
that recognition of self inhibits the ability to kill.
Clues to the origins of such inhibitory signals came from
early studies looking at which tumor targets NK cells killed
best. Investigators examined multiple variables associated
with NK preferences and discovered that killing correlated
best with levels of MHC class I molecules expressed on the
tumor cells. In one study, they examined the ability of CTLs
and NK cells to kill B cells that were transformed into tumor
cells by infection with Epstein-Barr virus (EBV). CTLs were
unable to recognize and lyse these B cells. However, NK cells
were very effective killers of these tumor cells. Ultimately,
investigators realized that EBV infection down-regulated
MHC class I, allowing the cells to evade CD8 T-cell recognition. However, this absence of class I made them perfect
targets for NK cells, which responded to the “missing self.”
The investigators “clinched” a role of MHC class I by transfecting the B-cell tumors with human MHC class I genes.
NK cells were no longer able to kill the cells. The subsequent
discovery of receptors on NK cells that produce inhibitory
signals when they recognize MHC molecules on potential
target cells provided direct support for this model. These
inhibitory receptors were shown to prevent NK-cell killing,
proliferation, and cytokine release.
Since many virus-infected and tumor cells decrease MHC
expression, the missing self model (i.e., basing the decision
to kill on whether a target expresses sufficient levels of MHC
class I, a ubiquitous self-protein) makes good physiological
sense. Although the fundamental paradigm has stood the
test of time, not surprisingly the real situation is more complicated (Figure 13-15). As indicated above, it turns out that
NK cells express two different categories of receptors: one
that delivers signals that inhibit the cytotoxic activity of NK
cells (those that recognize MHC class I products) and
another that delivers signals that enhance cytotoxic activity.
NK cells distinguish healthy cells from infected or cancerous
ones by monitoring and integrating both sets of signals;
whether a target is killed or not depends on the balance
between activators and inhibitors. Inhibiting signals, in
general, can trump activating signals; thus, cells expressing
normal levels of unaltered MHC class I molecules tend to
escape all forms of NK-cell-mediated killing.
NK Cell Receptors
NK receptors fall into two functional categories: inhibitory
molecules that bind MHC class I and block the NK cell from
killing, and activating molecules that trigger NK cell cytotoxicity if an inhibiting receptor is not occupied. Both of
these groups also fall into two structural categories: members with lectin-like extracellular regions and members with
immunoglobulin-like extracellular regions (Table 13-5).

FIGURE 13-15 Model of how cytotoxic activity of NK cells
is restricted to altered self cells. An activating receptor on NK
cells interacts with its ligand on normal and altered self cells, inducing
an activation signal that results in killing. However, engagement of
inhibitory NK-cell receptors such as inhibitory KIRs and CD94-NKG2
by class I MHC molecules delivers an inhibition signal that counteracts the activation signal. Expression of class I molecules on normal
cells (a) thus prevents their destruction by NK cells. Because class I
expression is often decreased on altered self cells (b), the killing signal
predominates, leading to their destruction.

Note that although lectins typically bind carbohydrates,
most of the lectin-like NK-cell receptors bind proteins rather
than carbohydrates.
The extracellular structure of the NK-cell receptor does
not immediately identify it as inhibitory or activating. NK
receptors with identical extracellular structures can have different intracellular domains and therefore different signaling
properties. As with FcRs (described above) the intracellular
sequences of the activating NK receptors generally contain
ITAMs (see Chapter 3), and the intracellular sequences of
inhibitory NK receptors contain ITIMs. (Interestingly, like
NK receptors, Fc receptors also fall into two structural families: lectin-like and immunoglobulin-like.)
Inhibitory NK Receptors and Ligands Inhibitory receptors, which bind to MHC class I molecules, are the most
important determinant of an NK cell’s decision to kill. In
humans, they are members of a diverse immunoglobulinlike family known as the killer-cell immunoglobulin-like
receptors (KIR). Surprisingly, the KIR family appears to
have evolved extremely rapidly. Functional KIR receptors found in primates do not exist in rodents. Mice use
a distinct family of receptors, the lectin-like Ly49 family,
to achieve the same function as KIRs, namely inhibition of
NK cell cytolytic activity through binding to MHC class I

molecules on healthy cells. Functional Ly49 receptors do
not exist in humans.
Both KIR and Ly49 family members are highly diverse and
polymorphic. These inhibitory receptors are generally specific for polymorphic regions of MHC class I molecules (H-2k
or H-2d in the mouse; HLA-A, HLA-B, or HLA-C in the
human). Only a fraction of MHC class I and class I-like
ligands for these diverse receptors have been identified.
Given the genetic polymorphism of both KIR receptors and
their MHC class I ligands, it is not surprising that individuals
can inherit KIR-MHC class I combinations that are not ideal
and could increase their susceptibilities to disease.
An exception to the rule of thumb that human NK inhibitory receptors are Ig-like molecules is the lectin-like inhibitory receptor CD94-NKG2A, a disulfide-bonded heterodimer
made up of two glycoproteins: CD94 and a member of the
NKG2 family. Whereas KIR receptors typically recognize
polymorphisms of HLA-B or HLA-C, the CD94-NKG2A
receptors recognize HLA-E on potential target cells. This
exception also makes biological sense. Because HLA-E is not
transported to the surface of a cell unless it has bound a
peptide derived from the HLA-A, HLA-B, or HLA-C proteins, the amount of HLA-E on the surface serves as an indicator of the overall level of class I MHC biosynthesis in the
cells. These inhibitory CD94-NKG2A receptors recognize
surface HLA-E and send inhibitory signals to the NK cell,
with the net result that killing of potential target cells is
inhibited if they are expressing adequate levels of class I.
Unlike the antigen receptors expressed by B cells and T
cells, NK receptor cells are not subject to allelic exclusion,
and NK cells can express several different KIR or Ly49 receptors, each specific for a different MHC molecule or for a set

Examples

of closely related MHC molecules. Individual clones of
human NK cells expressing a CD94-NKG2A receptor and as
many as six different KIR receptors have been found. The
ability of each NK cell to express multiple KIR or NKG2A
receptors improves its chances of recognizing the polymorphic MHC class I variants expressed by an individual’s cells,
and therefore prevents NK from killing healthy cells simply
because a KIR variant it expressed didn’t happen to bind to
the MHC class I variant expressed by that normal cell.
Activating NK Receptors and Ligands Most activating
receptors expressed by murine and human NK cells are structurally similar and many are C-lectin like—so named because
they have calcium-dependent carbohydrate recognition
domains. NKG2D has emerged as one of the most important activating receptors and acts through a signaling cascade
similar to that initiated by CD28 in T cells. The ligands for
NKG2D are nonpolymorphic MHC class I-like molecules
that do not associate with 2-microglobulin. They are often
induced on cells undergoing stress, such as DNA damage
or infection. Thus, they help to focus NK cell activity on
cell and situations where their lytic activity would be most
adaptive. One particularly interesting example of an activating lectin-like NK receptor is Ly49H, a mouse receptor that
interacts with an MHC class I-like protein encoded not by
the body but by a murine virus, MCMV. In the absence of this
receptor, mice are poorly protected from this common virus.
Many molecules that are not exclusively expressed by NK
cells also enhance NK activity. These include CD2 (the
receptor for the adhesion molecule LFA-3), CD244 (the
receptor for CD48), as well as receptors for inflammatory
cytokines. The involvement of each of these proteins, again,

c13EffectorResponsesCellandAntibody-MediatedImmunity.indd Page 441 12/20/12 3:38 PM user-t044

Effector Responses: Cell- and Antibody-Mediated Immunity
makes biological sense, focusing NK cell attention on environments that are suffering inflammatory insults.
Finally, it is important to remember that most human and
murine NK cells express the FcIII receptor (CD16), which
is responsible for most antibody-mediated recognition and
killing of target cells by NK cells (ADCC). As described
above, ADCC is a potent addition to our response to infection and malignancy. Cells infected with virus, for instance,
often express viral envelope proteins on their surface. Antibodies produced by B cells that responded to these proteins
will bind the cell surface and recruit NK cells, which will lyse
the infected cell.
How NK Cells Induce Apoptosis of Their Targets
Regardless of which receptors are involved in regulating NKcell lytic activity, NK cells kill targets by processes similar to
those employed by CTLs. NK cells express and secrete FasL
and readily induce death in Fas-bearing target cells. The
cytoplasm of NK cells also has numerous granules containing perforin and granzymes. Like CTLs, NK cells develop an
organized immunological synapse at the site of contact with
a target cell, after which degranulation occurs, with release
of perforin and granzymes at the junction between the interacting cells. Perforin and granzymes are thought to play the
same roles in NK-mediated killing of target cells by apoptosis as they do in the CTL-mediated killing process.
NK Activity “Licensing” and Regulation
Even newly formed NK cells have large granules in their cytoplasm, and it was traditionally thought that NK cells were
capable of killing from the moment they matured. It is now
thought that most NK cells need to be licensed before they can
use their cytotoxic machinery on any target (even with the
proper activating and inhibiting receptor signaling). Licensing
of an NK cell is thought to occur via a first engagement of
their inhibitory, MHC class I binding, receptors. This event
can be considered a way for the immune system to test an NK
cell’s ability to restrain its killing activity and an important
strategy for maintaining tolerance to self in this cell subset.
Specifically, licensing allows only those cells that have the
capacity to be disarmed via inhibitory interactions to be armed.
Once licensed, NK cells are thought to continually browse
tissues and target cells via their multiple inhibiting and activating receptors. Engagement of activating ligands on the
surface of a tumor cell, virus-infected cell, or otherwise
stressed cell signals NK cells to kill the target cell. If the
NK cells’ inhibitory receptors detect normal levels of
MHC class I on potential target cells, these inhibitor signals
override the activation signals. This would not only prevent
the death of the target cell but would also abrogate NK-cell

NK Cell Memory
The line between NK cells and B and T lymphocytes continues to blur. B and T lymphocytes were once considered the
only cells in the immune system that could generate memory
responses. However, recent data indicate that some NK cells
can also generate a memory response to antigen. The evidence for this remarkable property came from experiments
showing that NK cells expressing a receptor that binds a viral
protein could transfer memory of this antigen exposure to
naïve animals that had not been previously exposed or
infected (see Classic Experiment Box 13-2).
These observations show that at least some NK cells possess the developmental machinery to become memory cells,
in other words to increase their longevity (although perhaps
not as long as B and T lymphocytes) and improve their
response times. We are left with a number of questions: Do
all NK cells have the capacity to develop into memory cells?
And given that NK cells do not express conventional antigenspecific receptors, against which antigens can they develop
memory?

NKT Cells Bridge the Innate and Adaptive
Immune Systems
The above discussions of cell-mediated immunity covered
the CTL, an important component of adaptive immunity
that expresses an antigen-specific TCR, and the NK cell, a
cell with both innate and adaptive properties, bearing receptors that recognize self and “missing” self on cell surfaces. A
third type of cytolytic lymphocyte has been identified with
characteristics shared by both the CTL and the NK cell.
This cell type, designated the NKT cell to reflect its hybrid
quality, develops in the thymus, and, strictly speaking, is
a member of the adaptive immune system. It undergoes
antigen-receptor gene rearrangements and expresses a TCR
complex on its surface. However, it also exhibits characteristics of cells in the innate immune system:

•

The T-cell receptor on the human NKT cell is invariant,
with the TCR and TCR chains encoded by specific
gene segments (V24-J18 and V11, respectively)
within the germ-line DNA; the cells expressing this 
TCR combination are therefore sometimes referred to as
invariant NKT (iNKT) cells.

•

The TCR on NKT cells does not recognize MHC-bound
peptides but rather a glycolipid presented by the nonpolymorphic CD1d molecule (Figure 13-16).

•

NKT cells can act as both helper cells (secreting cytokines that shape responses) and cytotoxic cells (killing
target cells).

•

NKT cells include both CD4 and CD4 subpopulations, which may also differ by cytokine production.

Adaptive Immunity: Effector Responses

Rethinking Immunological Memory: NK Cells Join Lymphocytes
as Memory-Capable Cells
Memory has a mystique in immunological circles, partly because it is the
fundamental basis for the success of vaccination, which empowered societies by
radically changing our relationship to disease, and partly because its molecular
basis still remains elusive. As one of the
hallmarks of the adaptive immune system,
memory has always been considered an
exclusive feature of B cells and T cells.
NK cells, the underappreciated lymphocyte cousins, have no antigen-specific
receptors and until recently were
assumed to have no capacity for memory.
As recognition of their importance in
responding to infection, killing tumor
cells, and sculpting adaptive immune
systems has grown, assumptions about
their activities have been reexamined. To
our surprise, the results of several clever
experiments have revealed that NK cells
do, indeed, share a capacity for antigenspecific memory with B and T cells.

O’Leary et al. showed in 2006 that memory of an antigen that causes hypersensitivity can be transferred by liver NK cells
into a mouse that had never seen this
antigen. Sun et al. showed in 2009 that
memory of infection with murine cytomegalovirus (MCMV) could be transferred
by NK cells. Below we discuss aspects of
this latter study.
To see if NK cells had any memory
capacity, the investigators wisely chose
to examine the NK response to MCMV.
NK cells are known to be an important
component of protection against infection with MCMV and a large fraction of NK
cells (up to 50%) express an activating
receptor specific for MCMV (Ly49H). A
schematic of their experimental approach
and results is shown in Figure 1 and two
key pieces of Sun et al.’s original data are
shown in Figure 2.
The investigators devised a rigorously
controlled system where they could track

MCMV-specific NK cells. Specifically, they
adoptively transferred (introduced a
population of cells from one mouse to
another) purified NK cells from wild-type
mice into mice whose NK cells were not
capable of expressing or signaling
through Ly49H. (These mice are deficient
in a signaling molecule, DAP12, that sends
signals from Ly49 receptors.) The donor
NK cells also differed from the host NK
cells by expression of CD45.1, a CD45
allelic variant that can be easily identified
by flow cytometry (see Chapter 20). This
way, the investigators could control the
number of Ly49H NK cells in the mouse
and could specifically trace those they
introduced.
They first found that the population of
NK cells that were specific for MCMV
(Ly49CD45.1) proliferated during the 7
days following infection then declined
over the weeks after viral infection (see
Figure 2b). This expansion and contraction

FIGURE 1
The investigator’s experimental approach. To examine the possibility that NK cells exhibited hallmark characteristics of memory cells, investigators
first looked to see if NK cells with the Ly49H activating receptor, which binds to the MCMV virus, would expand and persist. They next looked to see if the NK
cells that persisted after infection could protect another animal from infection with MCMV. They adoptively transferred the NK cells that had been generated
in the infected mouse into an uninfected mouse pup. Then they infected that mouse with MCMV and looked for signs of disease. Finally, they examined the
behavior of these persistent NK cells in vitro, to see if they responded faster and better to signals through Ly49H. The results of these experiments are described
in the text and some are shown in Figure 2. [Adapted from J. C. Sun, et al., 2009, Adaptive immune features of natural killer cells. Nature 457:557–561.]

BOX 13-2
precisely paralleled the behavior of conventional antigen-specific T cells (specifically, CD4 T cells) in a primary response.
They next asked a critical question. Did
this antigen-specific NK-cell response
result in memory? Specifically, did MCMV
NK cells persist over time? And if they did,
would they exhibit a more robust response
if rechallenged with MCMV? The investigators show that even 70 days after infection,
a population of Ly49H (MCMV specific),
CD45.1 (donor-derived cells) could be
detected. When the activity of these cells
was compared to cells from mice that
hadn’t been infected, the investigators
found that they were, indeed, more active:
twice as many NK cells from infected mice
(“memory NK cells”) could make IFN-
than NK cells from uninfected mice.
However, to show definitively that this
memory was physiologically relevant, the

Wild-type NK cells
(CD45.1+)

previously infected (Naïve NK) also
improved survival, but it took at least
10-fold more of these naïve NK cells to
provide equal protection.
These and other studies show that
lymphocytes must share the immunological stage with at least some NK cells as
actors with excellent memories. Whether
such memory applies to other antigenspecific NK subsets—indeed to other
immunological cells—and whether it has
the same molecular features as lymphocyte memory remain open and worthy
questions.

NKT cells do not express a number of markers characteristic of T lymphocytes but do express multiple proteins characteristic of NK cells.

The exact role of NKT cells in immunity remains to be
defined. However, experiments show that mice lacking NKT
cells mount a deficient response to certain low-dose infections by bacteria that express glycolipids that can be recognized by NKT cell receptors (e.g., Sphingomonas and
Ehrlichia). Interestingly, high-dose Sphingomonas infection
leads to sepsis and death in wild-type mice, but those lacking
NKT cells survive this challenge, suggesting that the NKT
cells also contribute to pathology by oversecreting inflammatory cytokines. (See Chapter 15 for a description of the
role of proinflammatory cytokines in the onset of sepsis and
the exacerbation of disease.)
Other data implicate NKT cells in immunity to tumors
and suggest that NKT cells recognize lipid antigens specific
to tumor cells. Finally, NKT cells also appear to contribute to
viral immunity, despite the fact that viruses do not typically
express glycolipids. They may play an indirect role in shaping the viral immune responses via the production of cytokines, including IFN-, IL-2, TNF-, and IL-4.

Experimental Assessment of
Cell-Mediated Cytotoxicity
Three experimental systems have been particularly useful for
measuring the activation and effector phases of cell-mediated
cytotoxic responses:

Co-Culturing T Cells with Foreign Cells
Stimulates the Mixed-Lymphocyte Reaction
During the 1960s, early in the history of modern cellular
immunology, immunologists observed that when rat lymphocytes were cultured on a monolayer of mouse fibroblast cells, the rat lymphocytes proliferated and destroyed
the mouse fibroblasts. In 1970, several groups discovered
that functional CTLs could also be generated by co-culturing
allogeneic spleen cells in a system termed the mixedlymphocyte reaction (MLR). The T lymphocytes in an
MLR undergo extensive blast transformation and cell proliferation. The degree of proliferation can be assessed by
adding [3H]-thymidine to the culture medium and monitoring uptake of label into DNA in the course of repeated
cell divisions.
Both populations of allogeneic T lymphocytes proliferate
in an MLR unless one population is rendered unresponsive
by treatment with mitomycin C or lethal x-irradiation (Figure 13-17). When target cells are incapacitated the approach
is referred to as a one-way MLR and the unresponsive population provides stimulation in the form of antigen presenting
cells that express alloantigens foreign to the responder T cells.
The responder cells include a mixture of TH and TC cells that

experimental system, functional CTLs (and helper T cells)
can be generated entirely in vitro, after which their activity
can be assessed with various effector assays.
The significance of the role of TH cells in the one-way
MLR can be demonstrated by use of antibodies to the THcell membrane marker CD4. In a one-way MLR, responder
TH cells recognize allogeneic class II MHC molecules on
the stimulator cells and proliferate. Removal of the CD4
TH cells from the responder population with anti-CD4 plus
complement abolishes the MLR and prevents generation of
CTLs. In addition to TH cells, accessory cells such as dendritic cells are necessary for the MLR to proceed. When
adherent cells are removed from the stimulator population,
the proliferative response in the MLR is abolished and
functional CTLs are no longer generated. The function of

is also halted.

CTL Activity Can Be Demonstrated by
Cell-Mediated Lympholysis
Development of the cell-mediated lympholysis (CML) assay
was a major experimental advance that contributed to understanding the mechanism of target-cell killing by CTLs. In this
assay, suitable target cells are labeled intracellularly with chromium-51 (51Cr) by incubating the target cells with Na251CrO4.
After the 51Cr diffuses into a cell, it binds to cytoplasmic proteins, reducing passive diffusion of the label out of the cell.
When specifically activated CTLs are incubated for 1 to 4
hours with such labeled target cells, the targets lyse and 51Cr is
released. The amount of 51Cr released correlates directly

with the number of target cells lysed by the CTLs. By means
of this assay, the specificity of CTLs for allogeneic cells, tumor
cells, virus-infected cells, and chemically modified cells has
been demonstrated (Figure 13-18).
The T cells responsible for CML were identified by selectively depleting different T-cell subpopulations by adding
complement to antibodies specific for each population (antibody-plus-complement lysis). In general, the activity of CTLs
exhibits class I MHC restriction; that is, they can kill only
target cells that present antigen associated with syngeneic class
I MHC molecules. Occasionally, however, class II–restricted
CD4 T cells have been shown to function as CTLs.
Currently, more and more investigators are using
fluorescence-based variants of this assay to detect cytolysis.
Instead of loading target with radioactive chromium, they load
them with fluorescent molecules, including carboxyfluoresceinsuccinimidyl-ester (CFSE). Lysis can be measured by the loss
of fluorescent cells in a mixed-cell population via flow
cytometry. Variations in staining methods can allow investi-

The graft-versus-host (GVH) reaction develops when
immunocompetent lymphocytes are injected into an allogeneic recipient whose immune system is compromised.
Because the donor and recipient are not genetically identical,
grafted lymphocytes begin to attack the host, and the
host’s compromised state prevents an immune response
against the graft. In humans, GVH reactions often develop
after transplantation of bone marrow into patients who have
been exposed to radiation or who have leukemia, immunodeficiency diseases, or autoimmune anemias. The clinical
manifestations of the GVH reaction include diarrhea, skin
lesions, jaundice, spleen enlargement, and death. Epithelial
cells of the skin and gastrointestinal tract often become
necrotic, causing the skin and intestinal lining to be sloughed.
Experimentally, GVH reactions develop when immunocompetent lymphocytes are transferred into an allogeneic
neonatal or x-irradiated animal. The recipients, especially
neonatal ones, often exhibit weight loss. The grafted lymphocytes generally are carried to a number of organs, including
the spleen, where they begin to proliferate in response to the
allogeneic MHC antigens of the host. This proliferation
induces an influx of host cells and results in visible spleen
enlargement, or splenomegaly. The intensity of a GVH reaction can be assessed by calculating the spleen index as follows:
Spleen index 


weight of experimental spleen/total body weight
weight of control spleen/total body weight

A spleen index of 1.3 or greater is considered to be indicative of a positive GVH reaction. Spleen enlargement results
from proliferation of both CD4 and CD8 T-cell populations. NK cells also have been shown to play a role in the
GVH reaction, and these cells may contribute to some of the
skin lesions and intestinal wall damage observed. Corticosteroids, which inhibit immune cell activity, are used to treat
GVH, but can make a patient more vulnerable to infection.
Most therapies focus on preventing GVH. Procuring a graft
from a donor that is precisely HLA matched to the recipient
is clearly the most effective approach.

The effector functions of the immune system have both
humoral (antibody) and cellular arms. Both cooperate to
clear the body of infection and, in some cases, abnormal
cells (e.g., tumors).
The humoral arm of the immune system refers to the
activities of antibodies secreted by B lymphocytes. The

■

antigen specificity, isotype, and interactions with FcRs are
all important features of antibody effector function.
Antibodies inhibit and clear infection by blocking the
ability of pathogens to infect (neutralization), by coating
pathogens so that they are recognized and phagocytosed
by innate immune cells (opsonization), by recruiting

complement to the pathogen (complement fixation), and
by directing other cells of the innate immune system to
kill infected cells (antibody-dependent cell cytotoxicity).
Each antibody isotype has different effector functions:
IgM and some IgG antibodies fix complement; IgG antibodies mediate ADCC; IgE antibodies induce release of
inflammatory molecules from granulocytes to kill parasites; and IgA antibodies are a major isotype in bodily
secretions and block entry of bacteria and toxins to the
bloodstream.
Fc receptors are responsible for many of the effector functions of antibodies, including phagocytosis of antibodyantigen complexes by macrophages; transcytosis of
antibodies through epithelial cell layers; lysis of antibodybound infected cells by NK cells (ADCC); protecting
serum antibodies from degradation; and regulating the
activities of innate immune cells.
FcRs are expressed by many cell types in the body and
generate signals when bound to antibody-antigen complexes. FcR generated signals can either activate or inhibit
the activity of cells. Whether an FcR is activating or inhibiting depends on whether it includes or associates with an
ITAM (activating) or an ITIM (inhibiting) protein motif.
The effector cells of the cell-mediated immune system
include cells of the innate immune system (natural killer
[NK] cells) and cells of the adaptive immune system:
helper CD4 T cells (TH cells) and CD8 cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs or TC cells). NKT cells are also participants and have features of both the innate and adaptive
immune systems.
Compared with naïve TH and TC (CTL) cells, effector
cells are more easily activated, express higher levels of
cell-adhesion molecules, exhibit different trafficking patterns, and produce both soluble and membrane effector
molecules.
In order to become functional CTLs, naïve TC precursors
(CTL-Ps) must engage with APCs that have been previously activated (licensed). CD4 T-cell help is not necessary for this first activation step, but is required for
optimal generation of memory and proliferation of CTLs.
Antigen-specific effector T cell populations can be identified and tracked by labeling with MHC tetramers.
CTLs induce cell death via two mechanisms: the perforingranzyme pathway and the Fas-FasL pathway. Both trigger
apoptosis in the target cells.

CHAPTER 13

■

The perforin-mediated cytotoxic response of CTLs
involves several steps: TCR-MHC mediated recognition of
target cells; formation of CTL/target-cell conjugates and
immune synapse formation; repositioning of CTL cytoplasmic granules toward the target cell; granule release;
formation of pores in the target-cell membrane; dissociation of the CTL from the target; and death of the target cell.
Fas-mediated killing also involves conjugate and immune
synapse formation where Fas-FasL interactions occur.

■

Other nonantigen-specific cells of the innate immune system (NK cells and granulocytes) can also kill target cells
via antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity
(ADCC), resulting in the release of lytic enzymes, perforin, or TNF that damage the target-cell membrane.
NK cells induce apoptosis of tumor cells and virusinfected cells by mechanisms similar to CTLs (perforininduced pore formation, as well as Fas-FasL interactions),
but are regulated by distinct receptors.
NK cells kill those cells that have lost or reduced their
levels of MHC class I, a ubiquitously expressed self protein—
a phenomenon described by the missing self model.

■

■

■

■

■

■

■

NK cell killing is regulated by a balance between positive
signals generated by the engagement of activating NK receptors and negative signals from inhibitory NK receptors.
Many NK cell-activating and inhibitory receptors bind
MHC class I products and their homologs. The expression
of relatively high levels of class I MHC molecules on normal cells protects them against NK-cell-mediated killing
by engaging inhibitory receptors.
NK-cell receptors fall into two major structural groups
based on their extracellular regions: the lectin-like receptors and the Ig-like receptors. Whether receptors are activating or inhibiting depends on their intracellular regions:
ITAM expressing receptors are activating, ITIM expressing receptors are inhibiting.
NKT cells have characteristics common to both T lymphocytes and NK cells; most express an invariant TCR and
markers common to NK cells. They exhibit both helper
and cytotoxic activity and kill cells predominantly via
FasL-Fas interactions.
Immune cell cytotoxicity can be measured in vitro by
mixed lymphocyte reaction (MLR), or cell-mediated lympholysis (CML) via radioactivity or fluorescence. They can
be assessed in vivo by graft versus host (GVH) responses
and increases in spleen size (splenomegaly).

ANALYZE THE DATA E. Jäger and colleagues isolated an antigen

from a tumor in a cancer patient who expressed HLA-A2. To
characterize the cell-mediated immune response of the patient
to this tumor antigen, the investigators generated a series
of peptide fragments from the tumor antigen and pulsed
antigen-presenting cells with these peptides. They then measured
the patient CTL response against each of these targets. Answer
the following questions based on the data in the table and what
you have learned from multiple chapters in this book. (“Pulsing” refers to a technique in which antigen-presenting cells are
exposed to high concentrations of peptides in solution. They
exchange these peptides for those that were in the grooves
of their surface MHC molecules. This is a convenient way to
generate antigen-presenting cells that express specific MHCpeptide complexes of interest.)

*Specific lysis is a relative measure of lytic activity and can range from 0 to
100%.

The Immune Response in
Space and Time

I

magine trying to understand American or European
football from snapshots taken of players on the field
or from examinations of the behavior and phenotype
of a few players taken off the field. Significant
information about the dynamic games can certainly be
gleaned, particularly by clever observers who note
differences in the color of jerseys, the directions players
are facing, implied motion of feet relative to the position
of a ball, and variations in physiognomy. Imagine then
having the capacity to pull one or two players off the
field and examine them and their behavior, with and
without a ball. This would certainly help. However, one
is still likely to miss the relevance of each position on
the team, the significance of substitutions, and the
rationale behind a stop in play, and one is very likely to
misinterpret the antics of players who have just sacked a
quarterback or flopped in dramatic agony in front of the
goal. There is little doubt that watching and listening to
the entire game in real time would both simplify and
enhance attempts to understand the rules and motions,
and would reveal events that would not be predicted
even by the most rigorous analysis of individual or small
group interactions, anatomy, and behaviors.
Understanding the rules of the immune system is an
even more daunting endeavor. Immune cells are the most
dynamic cells in the body. They browse cells in every
tissue, and organize responses in nearly every niche. Their
movements are choreographed in multidimensional space
by rules that have been gleaned by some of the most
elegant cellular, molecular genetic, and biochemical
experiments in biology. However, there is no substitute
for the information that can be gained by directly
visualizing the multiple cellular players.
Immunologists, cell biologists, physicists, and
engineers have been perfecting techniques to watch cells
in situ and in vivo for decades, and the technologies now
available to watch cell movement in living organs have
ushered in a new experimental era (see Advances
Box 14-1). The data coming from these imaging studies
are both satisfying and exciting. They have confirmed
many of the indications and predictions from elegant

molecular, biochemical, and cellular experiments in more
static conditions, answered outstanding questions,
challenged other interpretations, and raised new
questions about the complex cellular and molecular
interactions that must be integrated in multiple
dimensions during an immune response.
In this chapter, featuring animations and dynamic
images of immune cell behavior in vivo that should allow
you to visualize much of the information that you have
digested in the previous chapters, we will follow the
immune response in space and time. Because the techniques
that have allowed us to see cells in real time and in real
tissues that are still developing, not all immune events
have been directly witnessed or recorded. However, by
exposing you to the beginning of what is bound to become
a rich archive of video images, we hope also to provide
lasting images that you can probe and query conceptually.

Adaptive Immunity: Effector Responses

ADVANCES

Dynamic Imaging Techniques
As described in Chapter 20, fluorescence microscopy allows one to
visualize fluorochrome tagged (or autofluorescent) molecules and structures within
a tissue and/or cell. Most conventional fluorescence microscopy uses mercury lamps
as light sources. These lamps generate light
of multiple, discrete wavelengths (each of
which can excite a variety of fluorochromes) and shed this light on a relatively
wide area of tissue. The light emitted by the
fluorochromes is distinguished by filters
that allow specific wavelengths to pass.
Confocal microscopy was an advance
that markedly improved the focus and resolution of images by both narrowing the
area of tissue that is excited by laser light
and limiting the focal plane from which
emitted light is collected (by limiting which
emitted light is collected via a pinhole). The
laser light can scan a plane, generating an
“optical section.” These sections can be layered atop one another digitally to generate
three-dimensional images.
Two-photon microscopy (also known
as 2P or two-photon scanning laser microscopy, TPSLM), also increases resolution but
via a different technique: by directing lowenergy (high-wavelength) laser light onto
the field of interest. When, and only when,
two low-energy photons simultaneously
reach their target—and add their energies—
they produce light of the energy (and
wavelength) required to activate a fluorochrome of interest. Although both confocal and 2P microscopy can yield time-lapse
animations of cells observed (by generating many optical sections over time), 2P
microscopy has a key advantage: the longer wavelengths of light that can be used
to excite the fluorochrome are significantly less damaging to cells and structures and can penetrate tissue much more
deeply (100–200 μm). Therefore, cellular
activities well within small intact, live,
organs can be imaged for relatively long
periods of time.

Investigators have also developed a
suite of analytical tools that allow one to
quantitate the cellular movements visualized by dynamic imaging. Fine measurements of motility rates and directions
have enabled investigators, for instance,
to determine if a cell population is moving by random walk or via a more directed,
chemokine-gradient mediated fashion.
Intravital microscopy adds another
feature to these fluorescent microscopy
approaches and introduces technologies
that allow one to expose and image living
tissue (e.g., the popliteal or inguinal lymph
of a living, anesthetized mouse).

HOW TO VIEW A DYNAMIC IMAGE
Videos of cell trafficking are now relatively
common additions to published papers
and typically appear in online supplemental material. Several are also included in this
chapter. Some guidelines may be helpful
when watching these videos so you can
keep a critical eye on what they do and do
not show. Awareness of the variables that
influence the images you are watching can
help explain discrepancies or inspire technological advances, novel interpretations,
and new experiments.
• Which cells are labeled? Investigators
can typically label only two or three cells
or features at a time, and it is very important to recognize that this means you
are seeing only a fraction of the cellular
interactions that are occurring. Black
areas are not empty but are dense with
other cells and extracellular material.
Curiosity about these unstained areas
will profoundly enhance your appreciation for the limitations of the data, and
will inspire new experimental questions.
For example, it was first thought that
T and B cells wended their way through
lymph nodes simply by following soluble gradients of chemokines, but both
static and dynamic imaging data

revealed networks of reticular cells and
fibers on which the cells travel in random
walks that are assisted, if not directed by,
chemokines (see Videos 14-2, 14-3, and
14-4; and Figures 14-4, 14-5, and 14-6).
In sum, always ask yourself what isn’t
there, not just what is.
• How are cells labeled? Cells can be
fluorescently labeled with green fluorescent protein (GFP) or its brighter yellow
and red derivatives (YFP and RFP). Some
reporter mice express GFP downstream
of a ubiquitously expressed promoter
(e.g., actin), so that all cells isolated from
this mouse will fluoresce intrinsically
(Figure 1a). Often, mice are genetically
manipulated so that expression of a fluorescent protein is driven by a tissuespecific gene. In this way, only a certain
cell type is illuminated (Figure 1b). Cells
can also be labeled in vitro with reagents
that pass through the cell membrane
and remain stable inside the cell (Figure 1c). The stability of the label is one
important consideration. The disappearance of a fluorescent set of cells could
mean the fading of a stain, or the reduction in expression of a fluorescent protein (e.g., after cell proliferation), not
necessarily the loss of a cell population.
• When and how are cells introduced?
Most current dynamic imaging systems involve the introduction of
fluorescently tagged isolated cell
populations into a recipient mouse.
This is done for a variety of good reasons, including the need to label only
specific subsets of cells as well as the
desire to synchronize the arrival of cell
populations into tissues or lymphoid
organs. Manipulations on cells performed in vitro, however, can alter cell
function. Antigen-presenting cells, for
instance, can be nonspecifically activated in culture, which can change their
trafficking patterns and cell interactions.

FIGURE 1
Fluorescent labeling of immune cells. (a) This transgenic mouse expresses GPF under an actin promoter. (b) In this transgenic mouse, YFP is
downstream of the CD11c promoter, which drives protein expression in most DCs. The Weninger lab used two-photon intravital microscopy to
visualize the movements of DCs (yellow) in the skin after infection with the protozoa Leishmania major. DCs associate with extracellular matrix, which
can be seen because they produce what are known as “second harmonic” signals and fluoresce. The migration of these cells can be visualized in this
YouTube video: www.youtube.com/watch?vXOeRJPIMpSs. (c) Cells (e.g., T cells) can be labeled with membrane permeable dyes that fluoresce green
(CFSE) or red (CMTMR). Cells pick up the dye quickly in vitro and can be injected intravenously (adoptively transferred). C. Miller et al. were among the
first to visualize CFSE-labeled T-cell behavior in a lymph node, a static example of which is shown here with HEV labeled red. [(a) Hiroshi Kubota, Mary R. Avarbock

Some isolation procedures can inhibit
cell motility. The sequence of cell introduction is also an important variable.
Some investigators introduce antigenpresenting cells prior to the introduction of T cells; others will introduce
antigen into a mouse with yellow
fluorescent DCs and then follow with
T cells, and so on. Each investigator will
have a rationale for his or her strategy,
and it is useful to be aware and compare. Awareness of the potential
artifacts introduced by in vitro manipulations will improve your ability to
understand and critique the videos.
• When and how is antigen introduced? The ability to track cells during
an immune response requires that
antigen be introduced, of course. Antigen can be noninfectious—for example, foreign protein or peptide (e.g.,
ovalbumin) to which transgenic T and
B cells are specific—or infectious (e.g.,
Toxoplasma gondii; lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus, LCMV). Antigens
can be introduced intravenously, intradermally, subcutaneously, intranasally,

and so on, and, particularly in the case
of noninfectious antigen, with some
combination of adjuvants (e.g., alum
and cytokines). The mode of introduction can dramatically influence the
quality, quantity, timing, location, and
outcome of the immune response. For
example, respiratory system immunity
is best inspired by introducing antigen
intranasally. Antigen introduction by
infection with living pathogens will
inspire a natural, full-fledged innate
immune response that is likely to have
different, more complex effects on
immune cells and microenvironments
than noninfectious antigen or killed
pathogens. These differences are all of
interest to immunologists, and some
are even now being addressed directly
by dynamic imaging. However, when
antigen delivery and quality are not
the direct topics of interest, it is arguably even more important to be aware
of the variables that can influence
what you see.
• How are investigators visualizing
antigen-specific immune cells? In

order to understand the behavior of
antigen-specific lymphocytes, one
has to be able to distinguish them
from the millions of other lymphocytes that are not specific for the particular antigen of interest. Investigators
will often introduce fluorescent lymphocytes whose antigen specificity is
known (e.g., cells isolated from mice
that express transgenic T-cell receptors or B-cell receptors). This approach
allows one to manipulate cell frequencies and specifically trace the
behavior of antigen-specific cells.
However, transgenic systems are not
available for every antigen of interest
and can introduce their own artifacts
(e.g., receptor levels tend to be high,
and high cell frequencies do not
mimic physiological responses). Investigators have found some clever ways

behavior after introducing T cells that
are generally fluorescent.
• What type of tissue is being examined, and under what conditions?
The lymph node is easier to image
than the spleen, which has more
structures that autofluoresce, with
two-photon intravital microscopy
techniques. The lymph node that
drains the site of infection will provide
different information from the lymph
nodes that do not. Temperature and
culture conditions will have a significant influence on cell trafficking. Isolated organs must be maintained in
perfusion chambers that stabilize
these conditions, and can be easier to
manipulate and maintain in focus.
However, cellular traffic patterns in
explanted organs may not reflect all
that is physiologic. Nodes that are surgically exposed in an anesthetized animal can be imaged for longer periods
and may reveal more physiologically
relevant patterns. However, surgery
can inspire inflammation and stress
that could also influence trafficking.

QUESTIONS DYNAMIC IMAGING
ALLOWS US TO ASK AND ANSWER
Dynamic imaging often “simply” offers
visually satisfying, indeed stunning, confirmation of implications and predictions
offered by other indirect, albeit elegant
approaches. However, the approach can
also offer information about the sequencing of immune cell interactions within a
microanatomical context that could not
be gained by other approaches. Dynamic
imaging has already revealed unexpectedly important sites of immune-cell interaction (e.g., the subcapsular sinus of a
lymph node), unexpected participants
(neutrophils) in lymph node activity,
unique shape changes and motility pat-

terns (e.g., among cells in skin grafts, or
within germinal centers) that challenge or
enhance conventional immunological
wisdom. It has allowed investigators to
directly address questions that are raised
by other data. Which cells do naïve T cells
encounter first during an immune
response? What types of interactions are
associated with activation? death? tolerance? Where do CD8 T cells first encounter antigen? When and where do they
encounter CD4 T-cell help? Where and
when do cells leave their microenvironments? And ever more specific questions
can be asked. For instance, do somatically
mutating dark-zone germinal-center B
cells travel often to the light zone to test
their antigen specificity? Are antigenspecific T cells that enter a tumor capable
of engaging in long-term interactions that
result in cell death? What kind of Ca2
signaling occurs with serial versus stable
interactions? Do the functional fates of T
cells that arrive in a lymph node before
and after antigen differ? When do regulatory T cells suppress a response? Dynamic
imaging still has much to offer, and is
developing perhaps most rapidly in directions that allow us to combine cell trafficking information with intracellular
signaling information. We are beginning
to appreciate not just the timing and context of cellular interactions, but their relationship to molecular events, and there is
much more to come.
Dynamic imaging cannot, of course,
explain everything in the immune
response. It is limited to observations of
cells and structures that one chooses to
(and is able to) label at one time. It is limited to one or two areas of a mouse at a
time, and for only a limited time (20–60
minutes). It is dependent on experimental
systems that are to an extent contrived—
manipulated so that antigen and antigen

We start the chapter with a general summary of the
behavior of innate and adaptive cells before an immune
response. We then follow the central themes of the
previous chapters by first examining the behavior of
innate immune cells after the introduction of an antigen

specificity can be traced fluorescently.
Antigen-specific cell frequencies are
higher than they are in physiological situations. And, as noted above, dynamic
imaging techniques have only just begun
to allow us to visualize intra- and extracellular interactions simultaneously. Investigators are remarkably innovative, and
advancements and integrations of techniques that will give us a more complete
picture are yet to come.
Dynamic imaging is not only an exciting technique to have at our disposal, but
it also is now arguably a necessary part of
the immunology community’s experimental arsenal. We are likely going to
become even more dependent on the
information that dynamic imaging can
offer about cellular movements deep in
living tissues, about the influence of therapies on these movements, about the
effect of distinct vaccine regimens on cell
behavior, and about the coordination of
cellular movements within intracellular
and extracellular molecular events.
However, perhaps dynamic imaging will
have its greatest influence on education.
The immune system is a marvelous tangle
of multidimensional complexity and organization that is difficult to describe in words.
A simple video can clarify in minutes what
our rich yet imperfect language of immunology cannot easily articulate. It is, of
course, our responsibility as scientists,
young and old, to bring a critical eye to
what pictures and films show us and do
not show us. Richard Avedon, a twentiethcentury American photographer, perhaps
said it best: “All photos are accurate. None of
them is the truth.” However, moving images
of cells in multidimensional time and space
may bring us closer to the truth. They certainly have the capacity to make immunology more accessible and to inspire the
desire to see—and know—more.

and then by examining the behavior of the main cell types
that regulate the adaptive immune system. We focus
primarily on the behavior of the immune response in
lymph nodes, the secondary lymphoid organ that has
been most accessible to dynamic imaging techniques.

The Immune Response in Space and Time
Finally, we close with recent examples of immune cell
behavior during the response to physiological antigen
(pathogen and alloantigen) in vivo. We emphasize where
and when cellular interactions occur, providing more
context for the understanding of molecular and cellular
participants that you have gained from previous chapters.
Two Advances features provide more detailed
information relevant to our understanding of immune cell
behavior. The first describes cutting-edge dynamic
imaging approaches that have allowed us to see cells in
real time. The description allows you to better understand
the experimental basis for the images you see, and also
provides the background you need to critique the images
that you encounter in primary literature. The second
describes the molecular players in cell trafficking and the
molecular events that regulate the passage of immune
cells from blood to tissue, and it can be used as a resource
to understand more advanced literature.

Immune Cell Behavior before
Antigen Is Introduced
Hematopoietic stem cells in the bone marrow give rise to all
cells involved in an immune response (Chapter 2). Myeloid
cells, part of the innate immune system, include antigenpresenting cells (dendritic cells and macrophages) and
granulocytes (neutrophils, basophils, and eosinophils). Once
mature, these cells exit the bone marrow and circulate
throughout the body, some taking up residence in tissues
and organs. Lymphoid cells, part of the adaptive immune
system, also begin their development in the bone marrow,
but complete it in distinct niches. B cells complete their
maturation among the osteoblasts of the bone marrow. T-cell
precursors leave the bone marrow to mature in a distinct
organ, the thymus. During B and T lymphocyte development, the genes that encode the B-cell receptor and T-cell
receptor undergo gene rearrangement so that each mature B
or T cell expresses a unique antigen receptor (Chapter 7).
Both types of lymphocytes undergo negative selection so
that those that survive development will not be autoreactive.
Immature T cells (thymocytes) also undergo positive selection for T-cell receptor specificities that can recognize selfMHC (major histocompatibility complex)/foreign peptide
combinations with some affinity. Those lymphocytes that
successfully survive selection events exit from the thymus
and bone marrow as naïve T and naïve B lymphocytes,
respectively (Chapters 9 and 10).

Naïve Lymphocytes Circulate Between
Secondary and Tertiary Lymphoid Tissues

(HEVs).
and bone marrow travel by blood directly to the spleen,
where they browse for approximately 5 hours (Figure 14-1).
An almost equal proportion (42%) of lymphocytes enter
various peripheral lymph nodes, where they remain, scanning stromal cell surfaces, for 12 to 18 hours. A smaller
number of lymphocytes (10%) migrate to secondary lymphoid tissues in the skin and gastrointestinal, pulmonary,
and genitourinary mucosa, which have the most direct
contact with the external environment. Several protein interactions regulate lymphocyte homing to specific tissues,
including chemokine receptor/chemokine, selectin/addressin
and integrin/adhesion molecule engagements. We will consider some of these below, but describe them more fully in
Advances Box 14-2.
Continual lymphocyte recirculation maximizes the numbers of naïve lymphocytes that encounter antigen. An individual lymphocyte may make a complete circuit from the
blood to the tissues and lymph and back again once or twice
per day. Since only about one in 105 lymphocytes can recognize a particular antigen, a large number of T or B cells must
contact antigen on a given antigen-presenting cell (APC)
within a short time to generate a specific immune response.
The odds that such a small percentage of lymphocytes
capable of interacting with an antigen actually makes contact
with that antigen are improved by the extensive recirculation
of lymphocytes and profoundly increased by factors that
regulate, organize, and direct the circulation of lymphocytes

Molecular Regulation of Cell Migration
Between and Within Tissues
The molecules

that control the
movement of the cellular players within
and between immune tissues are still
under active investigation, but clearly
include a number of important receptor/
ligand families: selectins and integrins
(collectively referred to as cell adhesion
molecules [CAMs]), and chemokines
and chemokine receptors. These molecules regulate both extravasation, the
transit of cells from blood to tissue, as well
as trafficking within tissues.

CELL-ADHESION MOLECULES:
SELECTINS, MUCINS, INTEGRINS, AND
IG-SUPERFAMILY PROTEINS
Cell-adhesion molecules (CAMs) are versatile molecules that play a role in all cell-cell
interactions, both among cells that are sessile within organs and also between the
highly mobile immune cells and the tissues they travel to and from. In the
immune system, CAMs play a role in helping leukocytes to adhere to the vascular
endothelium prior to extravasation. They
also increase the strength of the functional
interactions between cells of the immune
system, including TH cells and APCs, TH and
B cells, and CTLs and their target cells.
A number of endothelial and leukocyte CAMs have been cloned and characterized, providing new details about the
extravasation process. Most of these
CAMs belong to four families of proteins:
the selectin family, the mucin-like family,
the integrin family, and the immunoglobulin (Ig) superfamily (Figure 1).

Selectins and Mucin-Like Proteins
The selectin family of membrane glycoproteins has an extracellular lectin-like
domain that enables these molecules to
bind to specific carbohydrate groups that
decorate glycosylated mucin-like proteins.
The selectin family includes three molecules, L-, E-, and P-selectin, also called
CD62L, CD62E, and CD62P. Most circulat-

ing leukocytes express L-selectin (CD62L).
On the other hand, E- selectin and P-selectin
are expressed on vascular endothelial cells
during an inflammatory response. P-selectin
is stored within Weibel-Palade bodies, a
type of granule within the endothelial cell.
On activation of the endothelial cell, the
granule fuses with the plasma membrane,
resulting in the expression of P-selectin on
the cell surface. Expression of E-selectin
requires the synthesis of new proteins and
occurs after the endothelium has been
stimulated with pro-inflammatory cytokines. Selectin molecules are responsible
for the initial stickiness of leukocytes to
vascular endothelium.
Mucin-like proteins are a group of
heavily glycosylated serine- and threoninerich proteins that bind to selectins. Those
relevant to the immune system include
CD34 and GlyCAM-1, found on HEVs in
peripheral lymph nodes, and MadCAM-1,
found on endothelial cells in the intestine.
Selectins bind to sulfated carbohydrate moieties, including the sialyl-Lewisx
carbohydrate “cap” that decorate these
molecules. L-selectin (CD62L) expressed
on naïve lymphocytes specifically interacts with carbohydrate residues referred
to generally as peripheral node addressin
(PNAd), which is found associated with
multiple molecules (e.g., CD34, GlyCAM-1,
and MacCAM-1) on endothelial cells. On
the other hand, E- and P-selectin, which
are expressed on inflamed endothelium,
interact with carbohydrate moieties on
P-selectin glycoprotein ligand-1 (PSGL-1 or
CD162), which is found on all white blood
cells. Selectin interactions are critical for
the first step in extravasation: leukocyte
rolling.

Integrins
The integrins are heterodimeric proteins
consisting of an  and a  chain that are
noncovalently associated at the cell surface. Most integrins bind extracellular

matrix molecules and participate in cellextracellular matrix interactions throughout the body. Some subfamilies bind
cell-surface adhesion molecules and are
involved in cell-cell interactions. Leukocytes express several integrins that are also
expressed on other cell types, but also
express a specific subfamily of integrins
known as the 2-integrins (or CD18integrins), which bind to members of the
Ig superfamily as well as proteins associated with the inflammatory response: Ig
superfamily cellular-adhesion molecules
(ICAMs). 2 integrins interact with multiple alpha chains also known as CD11.
Lymphocyte function–associated antigen-1 (LFA-1 or CD11a/CD18) is one of the
best-characterized integrins and regulates
many immune-cell interactions, including
naïve T-cell/APC encounters. It initially
binds weakly to ICAM-1, but a signal from
the T-cell receptor will alter its conformation and result in stronger binding (see
Figure 1). Such inside-out signaling is an
important feature of multiple integrins
and allows cells to probe other cell surfaces before making a commitment to an
interaction. 7 integrins (e.g., CD103
[E7] and 47) are also expressed by
leukocytes, including intraepithelial lymphocytes and regulatory T cells. These can
interact with ICAMs and cadherins, which
are expressed by multiple epithelial cells.
CD103/E-cadherin (CD324) interactions
may be important for localization of lymphocyte subpopulations in the gut (and
other mucosal) tissues.
The combination of integrins expressed
on a given cell type allows these cells to
bind to different CAMs expressed on the
surface of the vascular endothelium
(and other epithelial cells). Clustering of
integrins on the cell surface also increases
the likelihood of effective binding and
plays a role in leukocyte migration. The
importance of integrin molecules in leukocyte extravasation is demonstrated by

an autosomal recessive disease caused by

seen in individuals with impaired expression of selectins and has been coined LAD
type 2.

Ig-superfamily CAMs
The Ig-superfamily CAMs (ICAMs),
which can act as ligands for 2 integrins,
contain a variable number of immunoglobulin-like domains and thus are classified as members of the immunoglobulin
superfamily. Included in this group are
ICAM-1 (CD54), ICAM-2 (CD102), ICAM-3
(CD50), and VCAM-1 (CD106), which are
expressed on vascular endothelial cells
and bind to various integrin molecules.
ICAMs can also exhibit homotypic
binding—the binding of an ICAM to ‘itself’.
For example, PECAM-1 molecules on one
cell can bind to PECAM-1 molecules on

another cell. Junctional cell adhesion molecule-1 (JAM-1, CD321), which is also
located within the endothelial junctional
complex, can interact with another JAM-1
molecule (as well as CD11a/CD18 (LFA-1))
to play a role in transendothelial migration. Homotypic adhesion among Igsuperfamily members can also be found
among other cell types, including neural
cells.
An interesting cell-adhesion molecule
called MAdCAM-1 has both Ig-like
domains and mucin-like domains. This
molecule is expressed on mucosal endothelium and directs lymphocyte entry
into mucosa. It binds to integrin 47
(LPAM) via its immunoglobulin-like
domain and to L-selectin (CD62L) via its
mucin-like domain. Platelet-endothelial
cell adhesion molecule-1 (PECAM-1,
CD31) is found on the surface of leukocytes (neutrophils, monocytes, and a subset of T lymphocytes) and within the
junctional complex of endothelial cells.

CHEMOKINES AND CHEMOKINE
RECEPTORS
Chemokines, the other superfamily of
proteins that play a major role in regulating immune cell trafficking, are small polypeptides, most of which contain 90 to 130
amino acid residues (see Appendix III for
the complete list). They help localize circulating cells to sites of inflammation, to
primary and secondary lymphoid tissue,
and to specific microenvironments within
that tissue. They do so not only by exerting a chemotactic influence, but also by
controlling adhesion and activation of
multiple types of leukocyte populations
and subpopulations. Consequently, they
are major regulators of leukocyte traffic.
Some chemokines are primarily involved
in inflammatory processes; others are
constitutively expressed and play important homeostatic or developmental roles.
“Housekeeping” chemokines are produced
in lymphoid organs and tissues or in nonlymphoid sites such as skin, where they

between primary and secondary lymphoid organs (e.g., from bone marrow to

B-cell and T-cell lymphopoiesis are also
dependent on appropriate chemokine
expression, which regulates the microenvironment locale of developing cells.
Chemokine-mediated effects are not
limited to the immune system (Table 1).
Mice that lack either the chemokine
CXCL12 (also called SDF-1) or its receptor
show major defects in the development
of the brain and the heart. Members of
the chemokine family have also been
shown to play regulatory roles in the
development of blood vessels (angiogenesis) and wound healing.
The inflammatory chemokines are typically induced in response to infection.
Contact with pathogens or the action of
proinflammatory cytokines, such as TNF, up-regulates the expression of inflammatory cytokines at sites of developing
inflammation. Chemokines cause leukocytes to move into various tissue sites by
inducing the adherence of these cells to
the vascular endothelium. After migrating
into tissues, leukocytes travel in the direction of increasing localized concentrations of chemokines, resulting in the

targeted recruitment of phagocytes and
effector lymphocyte populations to
inflammatory sites. The assembly of leukocytes at sites of infection, orchestrated by
chemokines, is an essential part of mounting an appropriately focused response to
infection.
The chemokine family consists of over
40 members, with additional variation
contributed by alternate RNA splicing
pathways during transcription, post-translational processing, and isoforms (see
Appendix III). The chemokines possess
four conserved cysteine residues, and
based on the position of two of the four
invariant cysteine residues, almost all fall
into one of two distinctive subgroups (see
Figure 4-17):
• CC subgroup chemokines, in which the
conserved cysteines are contiguous
• CXC subgroup chemokines, in which
the conserved cysteines are separated
by some other amino acid (X)
The exceptions are CX3CL1, which has
three amino acids between the conserved
cysteines, and XCL1 and XCL2, which lack
two of the four conserved cysteines.
Chemokine action is mediated by
receptors whose polypeptide chains traverse the membrane seven times. The

Comments

receptors are members of the G-proteinlinked family of receptors and are grouped
according to the type of chemokine(s)
they bind. The CC receptors (CCRs) recognize CC chemokines, and CXC receptors
(CXCRs) recognize CXC chemokines. As
with cytokines, the interaction between
chemokines and their receptors is both
strong (Kd  109) and highly specific.
However, as shown in Appendix III, most
receptors bind more than one chemokine. For example, CXCR2 recognizes at
least six different chemokines, and many
chemokines can bind to more than one
receptor.
When a receptor binds an appropriate
chemokine, it activates heterotrimeric
large G proteins, initiating a signal transduction process that generates such
potent second messengers as cyclic AMP
(cAMP), IP3, Ca2, and activated small G
proteins. Dramatic changes are effected
by the chemokine-initiated activation of
these signal transduction pathways.
Within seconds, an appropriate chemokine can cause abrupt and extensive
changes to the shape of a leukocyte. Chemokines can also promote greater adhesiveness to endothelial walls by activating
leukocyte integrins (an event that is also
dependent on the shear forces generated

The sequential but overlapping steps in leukocyte extravasation. Tethering and rolling are mediated by binding of selectin molecules to
sialylated carbohydrate moieties on mucin-like CAMs. Chemokines then bind to G-protein-linked receptors on the leukocyte, triggering an activating signal.
This signal (in combination with the shear forces applied by blood flow) induces a conformational change in the integrin molecules, enabling them to
adhere firmly to Ig-superfamily molecules on the endothelium. Finally, leukocytes traverse the tight endothelial junction and subsequently migrate into the
underlying tissue (transmigration).

by blood flow). Finally, chemokines induce
the generation of microbicidal oxygen
radicals in phagocytes, and the release of
granular contents, including proteases,
histamine, and cytotoxic proteins from
granulocytes.

Differences in chemokine-receptor
expression profiles mediate
differences in leukocyte activity
Differences in the patterns of expression
of chemokine receptors by leukocytes
coupled with the production of distinctive profiles of chemokines by destination
tissues and sites provide rich opportunities for the differential regulation of activities and movements of different leukocyte
populations. Among the major populations of human leukocytes, neutrophils
express CXCR1, CXCR2, and CXCR4; eosinophils express CCR1 and CCR3. Resting B
cells express CCR5, and activated B cells
will transiently up-regulate CCR7 (see
below). Although resting naïve T cells display CCR7, CCR7 is not present on activated T cells, which may express CCR1,
CCR4, CCR5, CCR8, CXCR3, and others.
Indeed, T-cell effector subsets (TH1, TH2,
TH17, TREG) can be distinguished not only
by patterns of cytokine production but

also by patterns of chemokine receptor
expression. TH2 and TREG cells express
CCR4 and CCR8, and a number of other
receptors not expressed by TH1 cells. On
the other hand, TH1 cells express CCR5,
and CXCR3, whereas most TH2 cells do
not. Many TH17 cells express CCR6. A more
comprehensive list of chemokines and
their receptors is included in Appendix III.

EXTRAVASATION
Extravasation is a central feature of cell
trafficking to both normal and inflamed
tissue and is coordinated by both adhesion-molecule interactions and chemokine
interactions. “The Inner Life of the Cell”
(available for free at http://multimedia.
mcb.harvard.edu/media.html) is a stunning artistic and scientifically relevant animation that depicts the surface and
signaling interactions that govern the
travels of a white blood cell from the
bloodstream into the surrounding tissues.
Its first few minutes, in particular, provide
an excellent visual reference to the molecular events we describe below.
As an inflammatory response develops, various cytokines and other inflammatory mediators produced by innate
immune cells act on the local blood ves-

sels, activating them to increase expression of cell-adhesion molecules, including
selectins. Leukocytes passing by this site
recognize the activated endothelium and
adhere strongly enough so that they are
not swept away by the flowing blood. The
bound leukocytes then extravasate,
migrating between endothelial cells to
gain access to the inflamed, underlying
tissue.
Leukocyte extravasation is often
divided into four steps: (1) rolling, mediated
by selectins; (2) activation by chemokines;
(3) arrest and adhesion, mediated by integrins binding to Ig-family members; and
(4) transendothelial migration (Figure 2).

Rolling
In the first step of extravasation, leukocytes attach loosely to the endothelium
by a low-affinity selectin-carbohydrate
interaction. In an inflammatory response,
cytokines and other inflammatory mediators act on the local endothelium, inducing expression of adhesion molecules of
the selectin family. These E- and P-selectin
molecules bind to a variety of mucinassociated carbohydrate molecules
(PLSG-1) on the leukocyte membrane
(e.g., a neutrophil). These interactions

tether the leukocyte briefly to the endothelial cell, but the shearing force of the
circulating blood soon detaches the cell.
Selectin molecules on another endothelial cell again tether the leukocyte; this
process is repeated so that the cell tumbles end over end along the endothelium,
a type of binding called rolling.

Chemokine activation
The process of rolling slows the cell long
enough to allow interactions between
chemokines presented on the surface
of the endothelium and receptors on
the leukocyte. The various chemokines
expressed on the endothelium and the
repertoire of chemokine receptors on the
leukocyte provide a degree of specificity
to the recruitment of white blood cells to
the infection site. Signal transduction
events caused by the binding of a chemokine to the chemokine receptor on
the surface of the leukocyte result in
change of conformation and clustering of
integrins (e.g., LFA-1) on the leukocyte.
Recent data suggest that this event is also
dependent on the shear forces generated
by blood flow.

Arrest and adhesion
The inside-out signaling induced by chemokine receptor engagement enhances
the affinity of leukocyte integrins for their
ICAM partners on the endothelium, lessening the likelihood that they will be carried away by the flowing blood.

Transmigration
The leukocyte then squeezes between
two neighboring endothelial cells without disrupting the integrity of the endothelial barrier. It accomplishes this by
homotypic (self-self ) binding of plateletendothelial-cell adhesion molecule-1
(PECAM-1; CD31) expressed on both the
leukocyte and the endothelial cell.
PECAM-1 is normally found within the
endothelial junction in a homotypic
interaction. Thus, when the leukocyte

PECAM-1 binds to endothelial PECAM-1,
the junctional integrity is maintained, but
the participants differ. LFA-1 on leukocytes also binds to JAM-1, another adhesion molecule located within the
endothelial tight junction, to mediate
egress from the bloodstream. Other integrins binding to matrix proteins within
the basement membrane and extracellular matrix allow the leukocytes to follow a
gradient of chemoattractants to the site
of infection.
This sequence of events applies to all
white blood cells that cross from blood
into tissues: rolling is mediated by selectins, and integrin adhesion is enhanced by
chemokines. A comparison of the specific
molecules associated with extravasation
of several leukocyte subsets is shown in
Table 1.

tion of lymphocytes in the maintenance
of HEVs has been demonstrated by surgically blocking the afferent lymphatic vasculature to a node, so that antigen entry
to the node is blocked. Within a short
period, the HEVs show impaired function
and eventually revert to a more flattened
morphology.
HEVs express a variety of CAMs. Like
other vascular endothelial cells, HEVs
express CAMs of the selectin family (E- and
P-selectin); the mucin-like family
(GlyCAM-1 and CD34, which express the
set of carbohydrate ligands for L-selectin
known as PNAd); and the Ig superfamily
(ICAM-1, ICAM-2, ICAM-3, VCAM-1, and
MAdCAM-1). Some adhesion molecules
that are distributed in a tissue-specific
manner have been called vascular
addressins (VAs) because they serve to
direct the extravasation of different populations of recirculating lymphocytes to
particular lymphoid organs.

Lymphocyte extravasation and
high-endothelial venules

Lymphocyte migration within a
lymph node

Naïve lymphocytes enter the lymph
node via specialized regions of vascular
endothelium called high-endothelial
venules (HEVs) (see Figure 14-2). These
postcapillary venules are composed of
specialized cells with a plump, cuboidal
(“high”) shape that contrasts sharply in
appearance with the flattened endothelial cells that line the rest of the capillary.
Each of the secondary lymphoid organs,
with the exception of the spleen, contains
HEVs.
Naïve lymphocytes do not exhibit a
preference for a particular type of secondary lymphoid tissue but instead circulate indiscriminately to secondary
lymphoid tissue throughout the body.
The development and maintenance of
HEVs in lymphoid organs is influenced by
cytokines produced in response to antigen capture. For example, HEVs fail to
develop in animals raised in a germ-free
environment. The role of antigenic activa-

After cells migrate into tissues, they are
directed to the site of infection by cues
generated by the innate immune system.
One good example of the molecular cues
that guide cells within tissues comes from
studies of lymphocyte trafficking in secondary lymphoid organs. Chemokines
coordinate the compartmentalization of
lymphocyte subpopulations into their
respective zones within the lymph nodes
and are organized by the reticular networks. Fibroblastic reticular cell networks
in the T-cell zone are decorated with
CCL21 and CCL19, which attract naïve,
CCR7 T cells to the T-cell zone. The networks are also decorated with IL-7, which
enhances the survival of T cells. Follicular
DC networks are decorated with CXCL13,
which attracts naïve, CXCR5 B cells to the
follicles. Both networks also express
ICAM-1 and VCAM-1, which enhance the
adhesion of naïve T and B cells, which
express ligands LFA-1 and VCAM-4.

and APCs within the secondary lymphoid organs. Early estimates using static imaging and in vitro data suggested that
up to 500 T cells probe the surface of a single dendritic cell
(DC) per hour. Dynamic imaging data now reveal that one
DC can be surveyed by more than 5,000 T cells per hour—
and suddenly it is much easier to imagine that 1 in 100,000
antigen-specific cells can find the MHC-peptide complex to
which it can bind.
Lymphocytes exit the blood and enter the lymph node by
extravasating at the high-endothelial venules (HEVs) present
in the lymph node cortex (Figure 14-2). It has been estimated
that as many as 1.4  104 to 3  104 lymphocytes extravasate
through a single lymph node’s HEVs every second.
Many, although not all, of the molecules that regulate
extravasation are known. Briefly, HEVs express ligands
(referred to as addressins) for L-selectin (CD62L), which is
expressed on the surface of multiple cell types, including
naïve T and B cells. Contact with these lectins slows the cells,
allowing them to interact with other adhesion molecules and
chemokines that stimulate cell movement between endothelial cells and into the lymph node tissue. Depending on the
specific chemokine receptors that they express, lymphocytes
will then home to specific microenvironments within a
lymph node (see Chapter 2 and below).

After crossing the high-endothelial venules, mature, naïve
lymphocytes enter the cortex of the lymph node (see Chapter 2). From here, B lymphocytes and T lymphocytes are guided
by different chemokine interactions to distinct microenvironments. B cells enter the B-cell follicles, and T cells enter
the paracortex (or T-cell zone)—a deeper part of the cortex
(Overview Figure 14-3). Here they will scan for antigens,
probing the surfaces of cells with their antigen receptors.
The movements of naïve lymphocytes that enter and scan
the lymph node are remarkable to watch and, when first
visualized, immediately (and perhaps even permanently)
reverse impressions from fixed microscopic images that lymphocytes are rather dull and inert. These movements also
revealed details about the microenvironment that had not
been anticipated by static images of the tissues.

Naïve Lymphocytes Browse for Antigen along
Reticular Networks in the Lymph Node
In 2002, the Michael Cahalan lab published one of the first
videos of naïve lymphocytes trafficking within lymph nodes
(Figure 14-4 and Accompanying Video 14-1). This group
and others noted that the patterns of movement of the fluorescently tagged T cells within the “empty” (not fluorescent)
black background of the image suggested that the cells were
not moving freely; rather, their journeys appeared to be
influenced by “invisible” structures in the lymph node tissue.
These observations and others inspired the discovery of the

T and B lymphocytes travel into a lymph node from the blood,
migrating across the wall of high-endothelial venules (HEVs) into
the cortex (extravasation). T lymphocytes browse the surfaces of
cells on the fibroblastic reticular cell (FRC) network, and if they do
not bind to antigen within 16 to 20 hours, they leave the node via
the efferent lymphatics in the medulla. B lymphocytes travel into
the follicles and browse the surfaces of follicular dendritic cells.
They, too, leave the node via the efferent lymphatics if they do not

fibroblastic reticular network (see Figure 2-9b), a network of
fibrous conduits and cells that provide pathways for traveling
leukocytes. Indeed, when the Cahalan lab illuminated the
network, investigators saw that naïve T cells interacted
directly with the conduits, using them as guides for their
otherwise random probing (see Figure 14-4).
The Germain lab visualized naïve lymphocyte cell probing in the lymph node in even more detail. One of that lab’s
three-dimensional images shows a T cell hugging a reticular
fiber (Figure 14-5 and Accompanying Video 14-2). Their live
video of naïve T lymphocytes diving in and out of the
lymph-node parenchyma, following the tracks laid down by
fibroblastic reticular cells, compellingly underscores the
structural basis for the movements of T cells visualized
before the network was definitively revealed (Figure 14-6
and Accompanying Video 14-3).
Naïve B cells that transit across HEVs into the lymph
node cortex also begin to travel along fibroblastic reticular
fibers. However, they soon change allegiance to the fibers

migrate into the lymph node via afferent lymphatics and join

with complement.

established by the follicular DCs (Figure 14-7 and Accompanying Video 14-4).
Differences in chemokine receptor expression and chemokine distribution are responsible for the differences in
migration patterns of T and B cells in the lymph node (see
Chapter 2). Fibroblastic reticular cells in the T-cell zone are
decorated with CCL21 and CCL19, which attract naïve,
CCR7 T cells to the T-cell zone. In contrast, follicular DC
networks are decorated with CXCL13, which attracts naïve,
CXCR5 B cells to the follicles. (See Advances Box 14-2 for
a more complete discussion of the contributions of chemokines to immune cell trafficking.)
The spaces probed by fluorescently labeled lymphocytes
in these videos is occupied not only by the fibrous network,
but by stromal cells that present antigen to T and B lymphocytes. The Nussenzweig lab revealed that DCs are present in
every microenvironment within the lymph node (Figure 14-8).
In the subcapsular sinus, actively migrating DCs travel
among a bed of sessile macrophages, which are long-term

residents of this microenvironment (see Figure 14-8 and
Accompanying Video 14-5). In the T-cell zone of the lymph
node, however, DCs do not crawl as vigorously. Instead, they
are part of the fibroreticular network, extending their long
processes along the conduits and allowing naïve T cells to
scan their surfaces during their travels (see Figure 14-8b).
Follicular DCs are also an intrinsic part of the network in the
B-cell zone (B-cell follicle), where their surfaces are also
scanned by B lymphocytes (see Figure 14-8c).
Over the 12 to 18 hours that naïve T cells are in each
lymph node, they probe DC surfaces in the paracortex, traveling in random directions on routes established by the

reticular network. Naïve B cells spend as much time scanning for pathogens as they, too, travel in random directions
on follicular DC networks. If they do not find and bind antigen, naïve B and T cells up-regulate the S1P1 receptor, which
allows them to leave the lymph node via efferent lymphatics
in the medullary sinus (see Figure 14-3). Egress is dependent
on interactions between S1P and its receptor, S1P1, which is
ultimately up-regulated by naïve T and B cells that do not
encounter antigen. These cells leave via portals in the medullary sinus (Figure 14-9 and Accompanying Video 14-6) and
return to circulation, so that they may resume scanning for
antigens in other lymph nodes.

Immune Cell Behavior during
the Innate Immune Response

diverse cell participants in the innate immune response. For
example, Herpes Simplex Virus, an intracellular pathogen,
binds to both external (TLR2) and internal (TLR9) Toll-like
receptors expressed by microglial cells, which are the
myeloid-lineage APCs of the nervous system. Staphylococcus
aureus, an extracellular bacterium that typically gains entry
via the skin, binds to TLR2 on DCs in dermal (skin) tissue.
The binding of pathogen to PRRs on innate immune cells
induces intracellular signals that enhance their ability to
(1) coordinate the killing of pathogens and (2) alert the
adaptive immune system to the infection. Granulocytes and
APCs begin to produce cytokines and chemokines that
attract more innate cells (e.g., neutrophils, NK cells) to the
site of infection. Tissue macrophages, for instance, are
induced to secrete chemokines such as IL-8 that effectively
and quickly attract neutrophils. In turn, neutrophils make
more IL-8 and attract even more neutrophils that swarm
and kill pathogens at sites of infection and response. Such
behavior is illustrated in Figure 14-10 and Accompanying
Video 14-7, which show neutrophils (green) swarming
around protozoal parasites (red) in a draining lymph node
3 hours after infection. These swarms are also likely to occur
in tissues, at the sites of infection.

Infectious agents range in size and complexity from intracellular bacteria and viruses to extracellular bacteria, eukaryotic protozoa, and fungi, to large multicellular pathogens,
such as worms. Although the immune response and its
molecular and cellular players are tailored to each type of
antigen, the broad similarities in immune cell behavior are
illustrative and the best place to begin.
As you know from Chapter 5, the innate immune system
is the first line of defense against infection, and has two roles:
(1) to initiate the clearance or killing of pathogens and (2) to
alert the adaptive immune system to the presence of pathogens. Myeloid cells (granulocytes, macrophages, and DCs)
are the main players in this arm of immunity and respond to
infection within hours, even minutes.
Both extracellular and intracellular pathogens gain entry
to the body via breaks in the skin or mucosal surfaces, such
as the lung, the gut, and the reproductive tract. Both types
are recognized by pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) of
the innate immune system that are on the surface of the

APCs, which reside in and can also be attracted to sites of
infection, become even more effective phagocytes after they
recognize pathogen. They also become more effective at processing pathogenic proteins and presenting them in class II
MHC molecules via the exogenous pathway, and class I
MHC via cross-presentation (see Chapter 8).

Once alerted to the presence of pathogen, APCs perform the
second major function of the innate immune system by
migrating to draining (closest) lymph nodes, and present
processed antigen to naïve lymphocytes. Because they are
the most efficient activators of naïve T lymphocytes, DCs
play an especially important role. They enter the lymph node
via afferent lymphatics (joining DCs that form part of the
reticular network) and present MHC-peptide complexes to
probing, naïve CD4 and CD8 T cells (Figure 14-11a).
The spleen is also a destination for some activated APCs.
However, given the spleen’s focus on blood-borne pathogens, it
is likely that APCs that have more direct access to such pathogens (such as APCs associated with the marginal zone and/or
splenic sinuses) play an even more important role in the
immune response generated in this secondary immune organ.

The Immune Response in Space and Time
cells, whose receptors recognize unprocessed antigen, also
need to be activated by antigen if they are going participate.
How do they encounter antigen? Is the innate immune system involved in this encounter?
Investigators used dynamic imaging approaches to follow
the route of subcutaneously injected, whole antigen. They
found that unprocessed antigen did, in fact, reach lymph
nodes—within minutes (even seconds) of injection. Processed peptide on the surface of DCs reached the lymph
node within 1 to 3 hours. This first wave of unprocessed
antigen was responsible for activating antigen-specific B cells
browsing the follicles of the lymph node; they responded
within 30 to 60 minutes.
Studies now show that, depending on its size and solubility, an unprocessed antigen can gain access to a lymph node
in several ways. If small and soluble enough, whole antigen
can travel directly to the lymph node via the blood. Larger
antigen particles and pathogens can be carried to the lymph
node via the afferent lymphatics—on the “backs” of APCs
that have bound opsonized pathogen. These unprocessed
small and large antigens typically end up in the subcapsular
sinus of a lymph node, which is outside the cortical follicles
where B cells browse for antigen. How does this whole antigen ultimately gain access to B cells in the follicles?
Antigen that is opsonized by complement and/or antibody complexes (see Chapter 6) is trapped by a specialized
group of macrophages (CD169 macrophages) that reside in
the subcapsular sinus (Figure 14-11b). These CD169 macrophages transfer the antigen to cells within the lymph node,
including nonantigen-specific B cells and other macrophages that express complement and Fc receptors. In turn,
these B cells and macrophages transfer antigen to follicular
DCs, which are scanned continually by naïve B lymphocytes.
The importance of complement receptors in the capture
and transport of soluble antigen to the lymph node was
directly demonstrated by a study that compared the abilities of
normal versus complement-receptor-deficient B cells to capture antigens from subcapsular sinus macrophages (Figure 14-12 and Accompanying Video 14-8). Normal B cells can
be seen sampling antigen present on the surface of macrophages
(right panel). They grab and run away with chunks of the red
protein. Complement-receptor-deficient B cells also probe the
macrophages, but come away completely empty (left panel).

Immune Cell Behavior during the
Adaptive Immune Response
In 2004, the Jenkins lab published two remarkable simulations of the activities of T-cell, B-cell, and dendritic-cell
interactions in a lymph node before and after the introduction of antigen. Although not live images, their animations
were based directly on published data about leukocyte
behavior and trafficking. They remain a most illustrative
model of what may happen within a lymph node after
infection. In fact, they offer visual speculation of events that

B cells capture antigen from macrophages in the subcapsular sinus of the lymph node. The interaction between antigenspecific B cells (green) and macrophages that had captured this
antigen (red) in the subcapsular sinus of a lymph node was imaged
by two-photon microscopy. The image and video compare the behavior of wild-type and complement-receptor-deficient (Cr-1- and
Cr-2-deficient) B cells in lymph nodes 1 hour after the antigen is introduced. In both situations, the macrophages in the subcapsular sinus
capture the red fluorescent antigen (labeled “PE-IC” for phycoerythrinimmune complex) quickly and become coated with it. Wild-type B cells
(right) interact with these red macrophages (yellow arrow) and grab
the antigen, carrying it away (typically to follicles). However, although
complement-receptor-deficient B cells (left) also probe macrophages

clearly take place, but have not yet been fully captured in one
tissue in real time: the functional response of the three main
cell types (T cell, B cell, and APC) from antigen exposure
through proliferation, complete with fluorescent indications
of cell activation status.
Video 14-9 shows naïve T and B cells browsing antigen
presenting cells in the lymph node in the absence of antigen.
You should recognize the activities of these cells from what
we have described above. Each lymphocyte type browses in
their own niche: B cells (red) in the follicles and T cells
(green) in the T-cell zone (the paracortex in lymph nodes).
Dendritic cells (purple) are also moving through the lymph
node—predominantly in the T-cell zone (paracortex).
After (soluble) antigen is introduced (Video 14-10), you
will see marked changes in the behavior of each cell type. An
activated DC (depicted in brighter purple) enters the lymph
node from the site of infection. Shortly afterwards, it engages
an antigen-specific T cell. This T cell becomes activated,
turning more yellow, a change in color meant to depict T-cell
receptor signaling. It then divides. During the same period

Adaptive Immunity: Effector Responses

antigen-specific B cells in the follicle also become activated
(turning more yellow), after engaging soluble antigen. These
activated B cells markedly change their patterns of movement and move toward the T-cell zone to ‘flirt’ with antigenspecific T cells. Finally, an activated T cell engages the
activated B cell, resulting in B cell division.
Videos 14-9 and 14-10, particularly Video 14-10, provide an
excellent reference for the more detailed description of immune
cell behavior in lymph nodes that we will describe below. We
will focus most closely on the interactions and travels of the
three major lymphocyte subpopulations—CD4 T cells, B cells,
and CD8 T cells—after they encounter antigen.

Naïve CD4 T Cells Arrest Their Movements
after Engaging Antigens
As you have learned from Chapter 11, CD4 T cells are
required for the initiation of optimal humoral and cellular
adaptive immune responses. They are activated when they
engage MHC-peptide on the surface of DCs that have been
exposed to pathogen. Depending on the specific combination of signals they receive from DCs, activated CD4 T cells
differentiate into distinct effector helper cells. Some will
enhance the cellular immune response by contributing to
the efforts of APCs to induce the differentiation of killer
CD8 T cells. Others will enhance the humoral immune
response by providing help to B cells that have been previously activated by antigen engagement.
The first studies of live CD4 T cells interacting with antigen presented by DCs in a lymph node came from work in the
Cahalan laboratory, which showed that naïve T cells travel
relatively quickly through the paracortex (10 	m/min or
more) prior to engaging antigen. After binding MHC-peptide
complexes, they slow down considerably (to 4–6 	m/min).
These “arrested” T cells form both transient and stable engagements with DCs.
A compelling example of the effect of antigen on T-cell
movements is shown in Figure 14-13 and Accompanying
Video 14-11. T cells specific for a male antigen are labeled
red, and DCs are green. Within minutes after antigen is
injected, crawling T cells “arrest” and form stable contacts
with DCs expressing the antigen.
From their observations, investigators initially proposed
that there were three stages to this first encounter between a
naïve T cell and a DC (Figure 14-14): (1) an initial period of
1 to 2 hours when cells made brief (5- to 15-minute) serial
contacts with DCs, followed by (2) a 2- to 14-hour period of
more stable ( 6-hour) engagements with DCs, which in
turn was followed by (3) a period during which cells disengaged and returned to serial sampling, exhibiting a “swarming” behavior around DCs. These three stages preceded the
first signs of proliferation, which began 24 to 36 hours after
initial antigen encounter and continued into the fourth and
fifth day after antigen introduction.
It is now known that T cells and DCs can form stable interactions quickly; transient interactions are not common to all

FIGURE 14-13 AND ACCOMPANYING VIDEO 14-11
T cells arrest after antigen encounter. In this experiment, cell activities were imaged via two-photon microscopy in the lymph node of
a live, anesthetized mouse. Within minutes after antigen (male-specific
peptide) is injected, a rapidly moving T cell (fluorescing red) “arrests” its
motion as it forms a stable contact with the more slowly crawling dendritic cell (green) that has processed and presented the antigen. The
static image indicates the stable interaction between T cell and dendritic cell 30 minutes after initiating contact. [Celli, S., et al. (2007), Real-time
manipulation of T cell-dendritic cell interactions in vivo reveals the importance

responses. Rather, it appears as if the kinetics of early encounters differs depending on the quality, quantity, and availability
of antigen as well as the activation state of a DC. Nonetheless,
in order to proliferate and differentiate optimally, CD4 T cells
must ultimately become involved in committed, long-term
relationships (8 hours or more) with a DC.

B Cells Seek Help from CD4 T Cells at the
Border between the Follicle and Paracortex
of the Lymph Node
B cells need two signals to be fully activated. They are partially activated after they find and bind antigen during their
travels through the B-cell follicle. They then need help from
an activated T cell, which releases cytokines that regulate differentiation and provides ligands that stimulate CD40 signaling. Several different effector helper cells—TH1, TH2, and TFH

FIGURE 14-14 Stages observed during the encounter
between a naïve T cell and a dendritic cell. Investigators observed that T cells made transient contact with dendritic cells both
early and late in a response, prior to proliferation. They described
several sequential stages, depicted here. These stages may not be
required—other experiments show that CD4 and CD8 T cells can
form stable interactions very quickly, bypassing the first step. However, most agree that the outcome of the interaction varies with its
subpopulations, for example—can provide help that activated
B cells need to proliferate and differentiate into producers of
high-affinity antibodies and memory cells. Each will encourage the production of different antibody isotypes, tailoring
the response to the type of pathogen that initiated the activity.
Activated B cells seek T-cell help at the border between
the follicle and the paracortex of the lymph node. The Cyster
lab pioneered dynamic imaging studies of antigen-specific
B cells and generated now-classic images that revealed a
B-cell/T cell choreography that was not fully anticipated by
other approaches. They show B cells in the follicle moving
purposefully toward the T-cell zone hours after binding antigen via the B-cell receptor (BCR) (Figure 14-15 and Accompanying Video 14-12). The investigators also showed that
this migration was dependent on the chemokine receptor
CCR7. When B cells bind antigen, they receive signals that
up-regulate CCR7, which is not ordinarily expressed by
naïve B cells. B cells can now follow chemotactic signals
generated by the paracortex and migrate toward helper T cells.
In other words, by inducing the up-regulation of CCR7,
antigen binding redirects the B cell to the T-cell zone, where
it can receive the appropriate help.
The investigators captured the encounter between an
activated B cell and activated helper CD4 T cell at the border between the follicle and T-cell zone (Figure 14-16 and
Accompanying Video 14-13). Antigen-specific B-cell/T-cell
pairs form stable connections within a day of antigen introduction and migrate together, with the B cell in full control
of the antigen-specific T cell, which trails behind “helplessly.”
Such behavior was not evident between T and B cells that did
not share antigen specificity.
The intimate and stable interactions established between
T and B cells reflects the type of help that helper T cells must
deliver to B cells. The cell pair forms an immunological synapse between them, with TCR, CD28, and adhesion mole-

quality—and stable interactions appear required for optimal differentiation and proliferation of effector cells. Proliferation occurs after
cells have detached from the dendritic cell, although they seem to
continue to make transient contacts. [Adapted from M. J. Miller, O. Safrina,

complexes, CD80/86 molecules, and other adhesion molecules
on B cells. Into this synaptic space, the T cell delivers cytokines (e.g., IL-4) that stimulate B-cell differentiation. The
synapse is also the site of stimulating interactions between
CD40L on the T cell and CD40 on the B cell. CD40 signals
are required for B-cell proliferation and differentiation.

in an isolated lymph node via two-photon microscopy. The static

shows how the more actively migrating B cells (red) drag the interacting T cells (green) behind them as they travel. [Okada T, Miller MJ, Parker

After receiving T-cell help, activated B cells travel to the
outer edges of the follicle, following cues that are dependent on
a G-protein-coupled receptor (EBI2). Here B cells continue to
proliferate and, in some cases, continue to receive T-cell help.
Some of these activated B cells will differentiate into plasma
cells and leave the lymph node; others will return to the interior
of the follicle, seeding a germinal center, where they undergo
more rounds of proliferation and somatic hypermutation.

Dynamic Imaging Approaches Have Been
Used to Address a Controversy about B-Cell
Behavior in Germinal Centers
The movements of cells within germinal centers have been
visualized by several groups. Cyster and other labs revealed that
germinal-center B cells were unusually motile and extended
long processes—something more characteristic of DCs than
lymphocytes (Figure 14-17 and Accompanying Video 14-14).
Immunologists studying B cells have also used dynamic
imaging studies to address a controversy about the behavior
of activated B cells in the germinal center. Recall that the
germinal center is divided into two major subzones based,
originally, on their appearance within classically stained sections under a light microscope (see Figure 12-11b). The dark
zone contains proliferating B cells and is thought to be the
main site of somatic hypermutation (see Chapter 12). The
light zone is replete with follicular DCs and their reticular
network, which present antigen-antibody complexes and
provide a scaffold for further B-cell/T-helper cell interactions

FIGURE 14-17 AND ACCOMPANYING VIDEO 14-14
Germinal-center B cells differ in their behavior from naïve
B cells. In this experiment, fluorescently labeled antigen-specific
B cells (green) were transferred into a mouse, which was immunized
with soluble antigen 1 day later. Naïve (B and T) lymphocytes, fluorescently labeled red, were introduced 6 days later. The behaviors
of antigen-activated B cells versus naïve lymphocytes were observed by two-photon imaging of isolated lymph nodes. Antigenexperienced B cells (green) occupy the germinal centers and differ
dramatically in shape and activity from naïve lymphocytes (red).
They extend processes that actively probe the microenvironment
in ways more reminiscent of DCs. Most naïve B (and T cells) remain
outside the germinal center, where they probe less actively and extend shorter processes. (Collagen fibers in the lymph node microenvironment fluoresce blue in this system.) [Allen, C.D., Okada, T., Tang,
H.L., and Cyster, J.G. (2007b). Imaging of germinal center selection events during
affinity maturation. Science 315:528–531. Movie S1.]

that regulate germinal center selection events. The light zone
is thought to be the primary site of differentiation to plasma
cells and memory B cells, as well as the site for positive selection of antigen-specific B cells that are somatically mutated in
the dark zone. Positive selection is thought to occur when
new B-cell specificities generated in the dark zone move to
the light zone to sample antigens and test their affinities
against antigens. Those that bind with high affinity received
T-cell help and survived to return to the dark zone to generate even higher-affinity specificities. The highest-affinity
clones arise after several cycles of somatic hypermutation in
the dark zone, and antigen sampling in the light zone.
Based on this model of positive selection, investigators
made a simple prediction: dynamic imaging experiments
should show B cells trafficking back and forth between the
zones (Figure 14-18). However, the experiments showed that
germinal center B cells much prefer to travel within rather than
between the light and dark zones! In fact, only a few percent
were found to travel between the zones every hour. In addition,

Germinal-center B cells are thought to proliferate predominantly in
the dark zone, where they also undergo somatic mutation. Highaffinity clones are thought to be positively selected in the light zone,
where both antigen and T-cell help are available. This proposal requires cells to move from dark to light zones, perhaps even more
than once. Two-photon intravital microscopy experiments surprised
many when they showed that (1) B cells preferred to traffic within
rather than between zones, (2) germinal-center B cells can divide in
the light zone, and (3) the B cells made surprisingly brief contact with
T helper cells when they did encounter them in the light zone. This
recirculation model is still favored, but is currently under modification
based on these and other experiments. [Adapted from A. E. Hauser, M. J.
Shlomchik, and A. M. Haberman, (2007), In vivo imaging studies shed light on
germinal-centre development, Nature Reviews Immunology 7:499.]

B-cell division was not simply confined to the dark zone but
was also observed in the light zone. Finally, B cells made only
brief contact with T-helper cells in the light zone, challenging
another assumption that high-affinity B-cell clones would
make stable connections with T cells that allow them to outcompete lower-affinity B-cell clones for T-cell help.

CHAPTER 14

Although these observations inspired new models in
which B cells behave and develop independently in light and
dark zones, other analyses suggested that the frequency of
travel between dark and light zones is still compatible with
traditional models of positive selection for high-affinity clones
(see Chapter 12). B cells may simply sample antigen less frequently than once assumed and may not establish long-term
contacts with T helper cells. The brevity of germinal-center
B-cell interactions with T helper cells suggest that only the
highest-affinity B clones, which can process and present more
antigen, engage T cells effectively, even if transiently.
In this case, dynamic images raised more questions than
they resolved. However, they inspired novel speculation
that may lead us to a more accurate understanding of the
B-cell response.

CD8 T Cells Are Activated in the Lymph Node
via a Multicellular Interaction
Naïve CD8 T cells are the precursors of cytotoxic T cells
(CTLs). Major participants in the cellular immune response,
CTLs rove the body for infected cells, which they can kill
very efficiently by inducing apoptosis. Like naïve CD4 T cells,
naïve CD8 T cells are also activated by interacting with
DCs in secondary lymphoid tissues; however, they recognize
class I MHC-peptide rather than class II MHC-peptide combinations. Like B cells, they also require CD4 T-cell help to
be optimally activated.
The behavior of naïve and activated CD8 T cells in the
lymph node has been traced using dynamic imaging techniques. The movements of those cells after antigen introduction resemble those of CD4 T cells: CD8 T cells arrest
when they contact antigen on DCs and engage in both transient and stable associations. Some investigations, however,
suggest that CD8 T cells form stable contacts with DCs
more quickly than CD4 T cells, even at low antigen concentrations (Figure 14-19 and Accompanying Video 14-15). Like
CD4 T cells, CD8 T cells will divide up to 10 times over a

interacting with antigen-exposed DCs are considerably shorter than
those interacting with DCs from mice that were not immunized,
indicating that the T cells arrest when they encounter antigen.

4- to 5-day period after antigen engagement. Mature CTLs
ultimately leave the lymph node to travel to sites of infection.
Dynamic imaging techniques also allowed investigators
to experimentally address two important questions about
T-cell activation in vivo. First, when during these stimulatory interactions does a naïve CD8 T cell start to differentiate into a functional CTL? To answer this question,
investigators engineered CD8 T cells that fluoresced whenever they expressed IFN
, a cytokine that is produced by
differentiated CTLs. Using dynamic imaging techniques,
they generated time-lapse videos of the behavior of these
cells in a lymph node. Their results were unexpected. Antigenspecific (TCR-transgenic) CD8 T cells could differentiate
into IFN
producing cells quickly—prior to cell division
(less than 24 hours after antigen encounter). The amount of
IFN
 expressed by each activated CD8 T cell also varied
widely. These findings suggest that functional differentiation
of CD8 T cells begins as soon as T cells engage antigen on
DCs. They also suggest that how well a cell generates IFN

depends not simply on the affinity of the TCR for antigen
(which was the same for each T cell). The quality of signals
delivered by the DC and/or with the quality of CD4 T-cell
help are likely to play major roles.
Second, how do CD4 T cells provide help, given that
they cannot directly engage CD8 T cells? CD8 T cells, of
course, interact with class I MHC-peptide complexes. CD4
T cells interact with class II MHC-peptide complexes, which
are not expressed by CD8 cells. The simplest model for the
delivery of CD4 T-cell help envisions an interaction among
three cells: a single DC that presents peptides from an antigen protein in both class I and class II MHC to a CD8 T cell
and a CD4 T cell, respectively (see Figure 14-11a for a schematic example of this tricellular complex).
The probability that three cells with the appropriate antigen specificities and complexes could find each other in a
physiological context seemed low to immunologists. However, to their surprise and delight, dynamic imaging experiments confirmed that just such an interaction occurs in a
lymph node. Cellular trios (consisting of an antigenexpressing DC, and antigen-specific CD4 T and CD8
T cells) were observed by investigators 20 hours after T cells
were exposed to antigen (Figure 14-20 and Accompanying
Video 14-16). Further data suggest these interactions may
not be as improbable as supposed. In fact, they are facilitated by chemokine interactions: DCs activated by CD4
T cells produce chemokines (CCL3, CCL4, CCL5) that specifically attract CD8 T cells that express the chemokine
receptors CCR4 and CCR5.

node to perform their functions. Antibody-producing B cells
(plasma cells) travel to several sites, depending on the isotype of the antibody that they are producing. Early IgM
producers release antibodies from the medulla of the
lymph node, many IgG producers go to the bone marrow,
and IgA producers localize to mucosal-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT), particularly at the gut. Effector and
memory CD4 and CD8 T cells travel to multiple organs
and sites of infection, following chemokine and cytokine
cues that have been generated by the innate immune
response at those sites.

immune response in a lymph node (Overview Figure 14-21).
Not every detail of Figure 14-21 is likely to be correct—and not
every cellular player is represented. However, this graphic
overview should provide a useful reference and reminder of
the fundamental events that govern the development of the
adaptive immune response in space and time.
Briefly, naïve lymphocytes—B cells, CD4 T cells, and
CD8 T cells—continually circulate through secondary lymphoid tissue, browsing for antigens that they can bind. After
entering a lymph node via HEVs, lymphocytes are guided by
fibrous networks as they randomly explore their microenvironments. B cells scan the surface of follicular DCs in the
follicle (B-cell zone) for unprocessed antigen that they might
bind. T cells scan the processed peptide-MHC complexes on
the surface of DCs in the paracortex or T-cell zone.
Antigen arrives in a lymph node in waves. Soluble, unprocessed, and opsonized antigen can arrive within minutes and is
passed from cell to cell to the follicular dendritic cells that are
scanned by naïve B cells. DCs that have processed antigen at the
sites of infection arrive in the paracortex hours after infection.

When a probing lymphocyte engages an antigen, its
movements slow down as it begins to commit to the interactions that induce their differentiation into effector cells
and proliferation, processes that start early but continue
over a 4- to 5-day period. A CD4 T cell that engages
class II MHC-peptide complexes on the surfaces of DCs
may differentiate into one of several types of effector
helper cells. Which effector cell type it will become
depends on both quantitative (affinity) and qualitative
(costimulatory molecule engagements and cytokine interactions) variables. Some CD4 T cells gain the ability to
help B cells to differentiate into antibody-producing cells.
Some gain the ability to enhance cytotoxic cell differentiation and activity.
Within hours after successfully engaging antigen in follicles with their BCRs, B cells process and present antigen
peptides in their own MHC molecules and migrate to the
edges of a follicle, where they seek contact with activated
CD4 T cells that have differentiated into effectors that help
B cells. Some differentiate directly into plasma cells; others

Adaptive Immunity: Effector Responses

reenter the follicle and establish a germinal center, where
their BCR isotype and affinities are shaped by selection
events and additional CD4 T-cell help. Within roughly the
same period of time, CD8 T cells engage in multicellular
complexes with DCs and helper CD4 T cells and start to
differentiate into bona fide cytotoxic lymphocytes.
The differentiation of antigen-specific lymphocytes into
effector and memory helper CD4 T cells, cytotoxic CD8
T cells, and antibody-producing B cells is accompanied by
proliferation, which is robust by 24 to 48 hours after antigen
encounter, and can continue for 4 days and more. Fully
mature effector and memory T lymphocytes leave the lymph
node and travel to sites of infection to assist in the clearance
of pathogen. Effector B cells also leave the lymph node and
travel to several sites, including the bone marrow and the
mucosal tissues, to release antibodies.

The Immune Response Contracts within
10 to 14 Days
The proliferative activity of all lymphocytes ultimately
declines, typically because the stimulus for activation and
proliferation (pathogen) is removed. When pathogen is successfully cleared (or successfully goes into hiding from
immune cells), inflammatory signals will cease. Most effector cells of the immune system have limited life spans and
will ultimately die in the absence of stimulation. The life
span of innate immune cells is particularly short. Neutrophils, for instance, live for little over 5 days.
The contraction of effector lymphocytes, most of which
also have a finite lifespan, can be accelerated by self-limiting
interactions. Engagements between T cells themselves can
result in cell death. All T cells express the death receptor Fas,
and activated T cells express FasL. Fas-FasL interactions
induce apoptosis and may help to reduce the numbers of
lymphocytes at the end of a response. Regulatory T cells may
also help to quell normal immune responses by releasing
inhibitory cytokines (Chapter 11). By approximately 10 days
after initiation of the adaptive immune response, the lymph
node has quieted and returned to its antigen naïve state and
structure.

Immune Cell Behavior in Peripheral
Tissues
Once the effector and memory cells that are generated after
antigen encounter leave the lymphoid tissue, they begin to
recirculate among peripheral tissues. Unlike naïve lymphocytes, effector lymphocyte populations do not reenter secondary lymphoid tissue but, instead, exhibit tissue-selective
homing behavior.
Antibody-producing B cells (plasma cells) travel to several sites, including the medullary region of the lymph node
and the bone marrow, where they release large quantities of

antibodies. Pathogen-specific cytotoxic CD8 T cells follow
chemokine cues to the sites of cellular infection, where they
induce apoptosis of cells that express the class I MHCpeptide complexes that reveal their infection by intracellular
pathogens.
The trafficking of helper CD4 T cells varies according to
effector subtypes and is still incompletely understood. Some
CD4 T cells that provide signals promoting B-cell and
CD8 T-cell differentiation stay in the lymph node and
continue to stimulate lymphocyte differentiation. Others
travel to sites of infection to enhance the ability of tissue
phagocytes to clear opsonized pathogen. Some effector
CD4 T cells may even complete their differentiation or
change their functions at the sites of infection, responding
with plasticity to the collection of signals and needs of the
local response.
Memory cells take up residence in both secondary lymphoid tissue (as central memory cells) and peripheral tissues
throughout the body (as effector memory cells). There they
share sentinel functions with residing APCs.
In this section, we feature several examples of the behavior of effector lymphocytes confronting physiological antigen in peripheral tissues.

Chemokine Receptors and Integrins
Regulate Homing of Effector Lymphocytes
to Peripheral Tissues
Not surprisingly, the trafficking of effector and memory lymphocytes to peripheral tissues is regulated by changes in the
repertoire of chemokine receptors expressed on the memory
or effector cell surface and the chemokines generated by
innate immune cells at sites of infection. In addition, tissues
display unique sets of adhesion molecules that help select for
the effector subset.
In general, effector cells and effector memory cells avoid
redirection back to secondary lymphoid tissues because they
decrease expression of L-selectin (CD62L), which prevents
them from entering via HEVs. Instead, effector cells express
adhesion molecules and chemokine receptors that coordinate their homing to relevant tissues.
For example, a subset of memory and effector T cells that
home to the intestinal mucosa expresses high levels of the
integrins 47 (LPAM-1) and CD11a/CD18 (LFA-1, L2),
which bind to MAdCAM and various ICAMs on intestinal
lamina propria venules (Figure 14-22). Cells homing to the
gut mucosa also express the chemokine receptor CCR9,
which binds to CCL25 in the small intestine. IgA-secreting
B cells are also recruited into gut tissue via the chemokines
CCL25 and CCL28.
Other memory/effector cells home preferentially to the
skin because they express high levels of cutaneous lymphocyte antigen (CLA) and LFA-1, which bind to E-selectin and
ICAMs on dermal venules of the skin (see Figure 14-22). The
chemokines CCL17, CCL27, and CCL1 also play a role in the
recruitment of skin-homing T cells.

Effector Lymphocytes Respond to Antigen
in Multiple Tissues
Dynamic imaging techniques have been used to visualize the
immune response to specific pathogen, rather than noninfectious experimental antigen. Below we describe recent
studies that specifically follow the behavior of T cells
responding to physiologic insults in the periphery. We
explore the first two in the most depth. One follows the
behavior of T cells in response to infection with the protozoa
that causes toxoplasmosis (Toxoplasma gondii), a pathogen
that is transmitted from cats to humans (and other animals)
via feces and produces an infection that is often asymptomatic. However, “Toxo” can cause harm to the fetus of a pregnant woman. The second study traces the behavior of T cells
responding to—and rejecting—an allogeneic skin graft. The
observations should enhance the development of therapeutic efforts to inhibit graft rejection.
We close with several short, tantalizing descriptions of
interactions between immune cells and physiological antigens
that have been revealed by recent dynamic imaging studies. As
you will see, these studies provide a powerful reminder of the
influence of inflammation, which is difficult to mimic in the
absence of real infection. The studies also begin to reveal
immune cell behavior outside secondary lymphoid tissue.
CD8 T-Cell Response to Infection
by Toxoplasma gondii
Investigators have recently used dynamic imaging methods
to trace the behavior of the T cell specific for Toxoplasma
gondii (Toxo), a protozoal parasite that infects many different tissues, including the brain. More than half of the world’s
population has been infected by Toxo, which is acquired by
ingesting contaminated raw meat, soil, or litter exposed to
feces from infected cats. Most of us never know that we have
been invaded, and some of us harbor the parasite in cysts for

long periods of time. In those with weakened immune systems, however, Toxo infection can damage the brain and
eyes. The pathogen also can cross the placenta and cause
disease in fetuses, whose immune systems are underdeveloped. Understanding our response to this pathogen is an
important step in controlling it.
In order to follow the immune response to this pathogen,
investigators cleverly modified the parasite so that it
expresses an antigen (an ovalbumin [OVA] peptide) that can
be recognized by TCR transgenic (OT-1) CD8 T cells,
which, as you now know (see Advances Box 14-1), can be
more easily traced and manipulated. The Hunter lab has
imaged CD8 T cells responding to this infection in both the
lymph nodes and the brain. Their work shows that CD8
T cells in the lymph node respond very rapidly (within 36 hours)
after intravenous injection of T. gondii, forming stable contacts with DCs that peak between 36 and 48 hours. As predicted by work described above, crawling naïve antigen-specific
T cells slow down considerably (from 6–8 	m/min to 4 	m/
min) after encounter with DCs that have been exposed to
antigen. Their movements pick up again after 48 hours, when
they are actively proliferating and seem to rely on transient
contacts, again as predicted by investigations with noninfectious systems.
Interestingly, responding CD8 T cells and DCs appear to
collect in the lymph node’s subcapsular sinus, a localization
that was also seen after viral infection (Figure 14-23). Investigators speculate that this may be an active site of inflammation in the lymph node that attracts effector cells. DCs also
change in appearance, becoming vacuolated—not as a result
of infection, but in response to general inflammation.
CD8 T cells reactive to T. gondii antigens appeared in the
brain by day 3, and peaked at day 22, an increase that was
coincident with peak proliferation of CD8 T cells in secondary lymphoid organs. The investigators provide evidence that
the increase in T cells in the brain was due to the continual

influx of CD8 T cells and not a consequence of proliferation
within the brain. T cells could be surprisingly motile when
they arrived, particularly during periods when investigators
determined that effector activity was highest and parasites
were under control. They could also form more stationary
clusters, near infected cells, consistent with the possibility
that they were interacting with brain-resident APCs, which
were not labeled in this experiment. Unfortunately, the ability
of infiltrating T. gondii-reactive T cells to control the infection wanes over time ( 40 days), a loss of function that was
associated with the up-regulation of expression of PD-1, a
negative costimulatory molecule. This observation is consistent with observations that chronic infection “exhausts” lymphocytes, reducing their ability to clear pathogens.
The infection altered the microenvironment of both the
lymph node and the brain in several unanticipated ways.
Inflammation (antigen specific and nonspecific) disrupted
the reticular network of the lymph node and decreased the
levels of CCL21. This disruption may have assisted the establishment of cell-cell contacts during infection, but also was
likely to abrogate responses to new infections, by taking
away the cues for naïve T-cell migration. In the brain, however, the infection appeared to result in the establishment of
a new reticular network decorated with CCL21. This was a
surprise and presumably helps organize T-cell entry and
response in this tertiary tissue. T-cell interactions with this
network after infection imply that this network plays a significant role in T-cell trafficking within the brain (Figure 14-24

(a) Toxoplasma gondii, a protozoal parasite, can gain direct access to
the subcapsular sinus and attracts swarms of neutrophils. (b) After a
virus gains access, it accumulates on CD169 macrophages that line
the sinus. Virus-specific B cells will then gather from the follicular side

CD8 T cells also have access to the subcapsular sinus and have
been shown to cluster around cells infected with T. gondii. This makes
them vulnerable to further infection. [Adapted from J. L. Coombes, and

and Accompanying Video 14-17). Other studies intriguingly
suggest that such reticular networks are routinely established
in other tertiary tissues after infection.
Host Immune Cell Response to a Skin Graft
The rejection of grafts that are MHC mismatched (allografts)
requires both CD4 and CD8 T-cell activity. However, the
sequence of interactions that lead to rejection is not fully
understood, and the role of host (recipient) versus graft
(donor) APCs in mediating the activation is still disputed.
Specifically, in order to be activated, naïve CD4 and CD8
T cells must interact with APCs that express the graft’s alloantigens. Are the activating APCs coming from the graft or
from the host?
The Bousso lab performed an elegant set of dynamic
imaging experiments to address this and other questions.
MHC-mismatched skin was grafted onto a mouse ear and
imaged by two-photon intravital microscopy. The mismatched skin was from a mouse whose DCs fluoresced yellow (a CD11c-YFP reporter mouse), so their motions could
be traced. These fluorescent DCs exited the graft and were
gone within 6 days. The investigators looked for these graftderived DCs in the draining lymph nodes of the recipient
mouse and found them as early as 3 days after engraftment,
but they had the look of dying cells and never reappeared.
The investigators then asked which cells came into the
skin graft from the host mouse. To do this, they put the graft
onto mice whose cells all express green fluorescent protein
(GFP). They found that CD11b (myeloid) green fluorescent
cells infiltrated the graft within 3 days. These cells were
dominated by neutrophils at first, but over time they
included more and more monocytes and DCs. Interestingly,
such myeloid cells were also found in grafts from control,
MHC-matched mice (isografts). The investigators took
advantage of their system to look more closely at the locations of these cells and found that GFP cells infiltrated the
dermis of both allografts and isografts. However, only the
allografts showed evidence of GFP cells infiltrating all of
the donated skin, including the outer layer (the epidermis),
indicating that deep infiltration was antigen dependent.
To see if the infiltrating cells carried alloantigen back to
draining lymph nodes, the investigators introduced a clever
twist to their system (Figure 14-25a). First they put their
grafts on MHC-mismatched hosts with GFP cells and let
the green, myeloid cells (neutrophils and monocytes) infiltrate the graft over a 6-day period. They then removed the
graft, with its new green host cell infiltrates, and put it on
another MHC-mismatched mouse, but one that did not
have any GFP cells. They could then trace the fate of the
green infiltrates. Three days later, they found some of these
GFP cells in the T-cell zones of the draining lymph node,
suggesting that infiltrating cells from the host could play a
role in initiating the T-cell response to the graft. This is
consistent with suggestions that host APCs cross-present the
graft’s alloantigens to CD8 T cells. (Recall from Chapter 8
that is the process by which APCs pick up extracellular

|

CHAPTER 14

477

antigens and present them as class I MHC-peptide complexes to CD8 T cells.)
They strengthened their case for the role of host APCs in
cross-presenting alloantigen via a clever, albeit complex
scheme. Essentially they grafted skin from a “strain A” class I
MHC-deficient mouse onto an antigen-mismatched (“strain
B”) mouse that expressed normal class I MHC (Figure
14-25b). In this system, the skin graft’s own APCs were completely unable to present antigen to class I MHC-restricted
CD8 T cells; only the infiltrating cells from the recipient
would be able to do so. They allowed strain B cells to infiltrate
the graft, then removed it, transplanting it onto another
strain B mouse, but one that was class I MHC deficient. If and
only if the infiltrating (strain B) cells from the first host successfully cross-presented foreign antigen from the strain A
graft would the CD8 T cells in this second recipient respond
(and initiate rejection). Indeed, in vivo imaging revealed that
antigen-specific CD8 T cells from this second recipient
responded to the graft—confirming that host DCs that infiltrated the graft pick up and present foreign antigen to CTLs,
which are responsible for graft rejection.
Finally, the investigators visualized the activity of the
graft-rejecting cytotoxic CD8 T cells. Dividing T cells could
be found in the draining lymph node as early as two days
after graft transplant. However, such cells were not found in
the graft itself until day 8, and seemed to enter from the graft
edges. CD8 T cells were found at the border between the
dermis (deep) and epidermis (more superficial) border of
the allograft and were often in proximity to dying cells,
which were likely their targets. CD8 T cells were slower
moving in the allografts (versus isografts), which again is
consistent with indications that antigen-specific cells arrest
when they meet their antigen. By day 10, when the tissue was
undergoing active rejection, CD8 T cells were found
throughout the graft.
Dendritic Cell Contribution to Listeria Infection
As you know, DCs are important for initiating an adaptive
immune response against infection; however, in some cases
they are responsible for maintaining infection! Listeria
monocytogenes is an intracellular bacterium that resides in
soil and can cause food-associated illness and fatalities
(Figure 14-26; also see www.dnatube.com/video/2506/
Intracellular-Listeria-Infection for an illustrative video). In
2011, one of the worst food-borne disease outbreaks in the
United States was traced to Listeria associated with cantaloupe melons.
Recall that the spleen is the site of response to bloodborne pathogens: all white blood cells circulate through
sinuses in the red pulp, which also is a site where DCs and
monocytes can sample antigen (see Figure 2-10). White
blood cells enter and scan the spleen’s version of the T-cell
zone, the periarteriolar lymphoid sheath (PALS). B cells
enter and scan follicles, which are very similar to those
found in lymph nodes. The area that separates the red pulp
from the white pulp, the marginal zone (MZ), is a relatively

FIGURE 14-25 In vivo imaging of the immune response
to an antigen-mismatched skin graft. This figure shows the approaches taken by investigators to see which antigen-presenting
cells—host or graft (donor) APC?—activate the CD8 T cells that
will reject a skin graft. (a) Skin from a mouse of one strain (C3H) was
grafted onto the ear of a mouse of an MHC-mismatched strain (B6) in
which all cells expressed GFP. The cells that infiltrated the skin from
this B6-GFP mouse (pseudo colored yellow) were predominantly
myeloid (neutrophils, monocytes, macrophages). After time was allowed for infiltration, the investigators removed the graft and placed
it on a wild-type B6 mouse whose CD8 T cells (shown in green).
This allowed the investigators to see where the infiltrating cells (yellow) would go. They found the cells in the draining lymph node (dLN)

where they were interacting with CD8 T cells. These CD8 T cells
ultimately distributed themselves through the graft, killing the MHCmismatched cells. (b) Skin from a strain A mouse that expressed no
class I MHC was transplanted on the ear of an antigen-mismatched
(strain B) mouse that expressed class I MHC. In this situation, none of
the donor graft cells and only the infiltrating recipient cells could present
antigen to CD8⫹ T cells. The investigators let this graft accumulate recipient cells, then retransplanted it onto an antigen-matched class I/
mouse. The T cells from this mouse responded to the strain B cells that
had infiltrated the primary graft and picked up the strain A antigen.

unique microenvironment that is the first line of defense
against blood-borne pathogens. It is also the site of residence
of DCs and monocytes as well as a unique group of B cells
(MZ B cells) that do not circulate.
Dynamic imaging of fluorescently tagged Listeria bacteria
showed that they arrive in the red pulp of the spleen within
seconds of intravenous injection (see Figure 14-26). (During
a physiologic infection, when bacteria are ingested, they
probably take longer to arrive in the red pulp—either within
white blood cells that they infected in the mucosa of the gut
or directly from blood that they penetrated during infection.)

Within minutes, Listeria associates with and is presumably phagocytosed by the DCs in the red pulp sinuses,
thereby infecting them. Listeria-specific CD8 T cells accumulate in these sinuses, forming stable contacts with the
DCs that activate them. Investigators found that DCs in
these sinuses recruit other innate immune cells, including
monocytes, and unwittingly pass their Listeria infection to
these cells (via their extensive processes, down which Listeria travel). These circulating cells, which are critical for controlling the pathogen, also become vehicles of infection that
spreads throughout the body.

cytoplasm (cometlike tails of red actin can be seen trailing the green

T-Cell Response to Tumors
Dynamic imaging studies have also visualized an immune
reaction to experimentally generated tumors. These show
that antigen-specific, activated T cells can gain access to the
tumor (Figure 14-27). When they do, they migrate vigorously and exhibit effective cytolytic behavior, associating for
long periods of time (6 hours or more) with tumor cells and
inducing apoptosis. However, the tumors failed to regress,
and T-cell response seemed limited by (1) poor access to the
tissue and (2) poor antigen presentation by tumor-associated
cells, not by the availability of activated CTLs or their ability
to mediate cytolysis. These studies suggest that strategies to
improve antigen presentation and tumor accessibility may
be more effective than strategies that simply increase antigen-specific T-cell number.
Regulatory T-Cell Responses
Dynamic imaging has also allowed us to see when and where
regulatory T cells exert their suppressive activity, and the
results satisfyingly confirm predictions made from “static”
experiments, suggesting that regulatory T cells can suppress
immune responses in more than one way (see Chapter 9). In

a model of Type I diabetes (the result of T-cell-mediated
destruction of  cells of the pancreatic islet), investigators
traced the activities of fluorescently labeled antigen-specific
regulatory T cells introduced prior to disease onset. They
exhibited two distinct behaviors. Some prevented diabetogenic effector cells from making productive clustering contacts with cells presenting auto-antigen in the pancreatic
islets, consistent with proposals that regulatory T cells can
inhibit effector T-cell function by quelling the activation
potential of resident APCs. Other regulatory T cells formed
stable connections with effector CD8 T cells and inhibited
their ability to kill pancreatic target cells, an effect associated
with TGF- secretion by regulatory T cells.
Memory T-Cell Responses
Dynamic imaging of the trafficking of memory T and B cells
is in its early stages. However, experiments have already
revealed intriguing features. For instance, memory CD8
T cells appear to localize to and reside in the B-cell follicle
after Listeria infection. A clever set of experiments revealed
that T cells that are latecomers to the scene of an immune
response in a lymph node tend to generate central memory
T cells, perhaps because they do not have as much access to
fully activating antigen interactions that would lead to effector cell generation.
The Analyze the Data study question at the end of this
chapter also describes another interesting investigation that
reveals differences in the trafficking of CD4 and CD8
memory T cells.

Dynamic imaging takes advantage of advances in microscopy to visualize the movements of cells deep in live tissue.
Innate immune cells, including granulocytes and antigenpresenting cells (APCs), are the first to respond to pathogen. Innate immune cells bind pathogen via pattern
recognition receptors (PRRs), which generate signals that
result in the release of inflammatory signals, including
chemokines and cytokines.
Chemokines attract other innate immune cells to the site
of infection. Neutrophils are generally the first cell type to
move from the bloodstream into inflammatory sites; they
can swarm around pathogens as they attack. They also
produce more chemokines that attract APCs, including
dendritic cells (DCs), which are the most efficient activators of naïve T cells.
DCs at the site of infection engulf antigen, presenting processed peptide in class II MHC and cross-presenting it in
class I MHC. They travel to draining lymph nodes via the
afferent lymphatics to alert the adaptive immune system of
the presence of pathogen.
Antigen can enter the lymph node via multiple routes.
Soluble, unprocessed antigen enters the tissue quickly and
directly, or can be trapped by macrophages lining the
sinuses and relayed to follicular DCs through the activity
of noncognate B cells (and others).
Processed antigen (in the form of MHC-peptide complexes) arrives within a few hours on the surface of DCs,
which travel to the T-cell zone (paracortex). Dendritic
cells extend long processes and can interact with up to
5000 T cells per hour.
Lymphocytes undergo constant recirculation between the
blood, lymph, lymphoid organs, and tertiary extralymphoid tissues, increasing the chances that the small number of lymphocytes specific for a given antigen (about 1 in
105 cells) will actually encounter that antigen.
Cell-adhesion molecules (CAMs) and chemokine/
chemokine receptor interactions regulate the migration
of leukocytes both into and within lymphoid organs and
inflamed tissues.
Extravasation of all white blood cells involves four steps:
rolling, activation, arrest/adhesion, and transendothelial
migration.
Naïve B and T lymphocytes express CD62L that helps
them to home secondary lymphoid organs, where they
extravasate across high-endothelial venules (HEVs).
Naïve lymphocytes are very motile cells in the lymph node
and crawl along reticular fibers in their respective lymph
node zones. B lymphocytes browse for antigen along follicular DC networks in the follicle. T lymphocytes interact
with fibroblastic reticular cell networks in the paracortex,
where DCs that express antigen can also be found. Their

movements are regulated in part by chemokine interactions. Naïve lymphocytes that do not encounter antigen
leave the lymph node after about 12 to 18 hours and reenter circulation to probe another lymph node.
■

T lymphocytes that encounter antigen to which they bind
slow down considerably and ultimately “arrest,” forming
stable contacts with APCs (in the CD4 and CD8 T cells).
These contacts last between 1 and 24 hours, and if productive result in proliferation. Cells can experience up to 10
divisions over the following 4 to 5 days.

■

B cells that encounter antigen up-regulate CCR7 and
travel by chemotaxis from the center of the follicle to the
T-cell zone, where they wait for T-cell help. Antigen-specific
T-cell/B-cell interactions are strong and stable. The T/B cell
pair moves actively at the follicular/T-cell border.

■

■

CD8 T cells quickly form stable interactions with antigenbearing DCs in the cortex.
Stable tricellular complexes that include a CD8 T cell, a
CD4 helper T cell, and a dendritic cell have been directly
observed in dynamic images, showing that activated
CD8 T cells may be specifically attracted by chemokines
produced by DCs activated by CD4 T cells.

■

Germinal-center B cells are unusually motile and distinct
in morphology (they look more like DCs). Although they
tend to circulate within, rather than between, the light
zone and dark zone, a small percentage traffic from dark
to light zones, presumably to sample antigen and receive
T-cell help. Their contact with helper T cells is surprisingly
brief, a behavior that may put high-affinity B cells, which
express higher densities of MHC-peptide at a competitive
advantage.

■

Effector and memory lymphocytes leave the lymph node
via portals in the medullary region of the lymph node, an
event that depends on interactions between S1P1 receptors on white blood cells and S1P in their environment.
They travel back into circulation via efferent lymphatics.
Effector lymphocytes down-regulate CD62L, expressing a
different profile of chemokine receptors that allow them to
interact with inflamed vascular endothelium of tertiary
tissues.

■

Dynamic imaging of cells responding to a protozoal parasite that infects the brain reveals that inflammation can
temporarily alter the microenvironment (reticular structure) of a lymph node and can remodel the tissue that is
the site of infection by establishing reticular systems for
lymphocyte trafficking.

■

Dynamic images of cells responding to an MHC-mismatched
skin graft show that the APCs of the recipient are capable
of sampling and presenting alloantigen to host CD8 T cells,
which ultimately distribute themselves throughout the

CHAPTER 14

Q U E S T I O N S

ANALYZE THE DATA A recent paper (T. Gebhardt et al., Dif-

ferent patterns of peripheral migration by memory CD4 and
CD8 T cells, 2011, Nature 477:216–219) presented the first
intravital microscopy data directly comparing the behavior
of memory CD4 and CD8 T cells in response to infection.
Their data were surprising.
Gebhardt et al.’s experimental strategy: The investigators infected the skin of mice with Herpes Simplex Virus
and adoptively transferred CD4 T cells (which fluoresce
green in the images and video associated with the study)
specific for the virus as well as CD8 T cells (which fluoresce red), both of which expressed T-cell receptors specific
for the virus. They observed the movements of these cells
in the infected skin during the effector phase of the
immune response (8 days after infection) as well as 5 or
more weeks later when the only cells in the tissue would be
memory cells. Remember that skin has two layers: an outer
layer (epidermis) and an inner layer (dermis).
Their results: During the effector phase, both CD4
and CD8 T cells initially moved similarly through the
dermis. However, gradually, these two cell populations
distributed themselves differently: CD4 T cells stayed in
the dermis, CD8 T cells moved to the epidermis (!).
The investigators then looked at the memory cell
populations in infected skin weeks later. What they saw is
depicted in the following video (memory CD8 T cells
[red], memory CD4 T cells [green]): www.nature.com/
nature/journal/v477/n7363/extref/nature10339-s4.mov
Your assignment: Take a look at this time-lapse video
and read its legend.
a. Describe what you see, identifying at least two specific

differences between CD4 and CD8 T-cell behavior.
b. Propose a molecular difference that could explain one of
these distinctions.
c. Advance one hypothesis about the adaptive value of the
difference(s) you observed. That is, what advantage (if
any) may such a difference in CD4 and CD8 T-cell
behavior provide an animal responding to a skin infection?
EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN QUESTION You want to directly test

claims that CCR5 is important for the localization of naïve B
cells to the follicles of a lymph node. You have all the reagents
that you need to perform a two-photon intravital microscopy,
including (1) an anti-CCR5 antibody that you know will block
the interactions between CCR5 and its ligand (and can be injected), and (2) a CCR5/ mouse. Design an experiment that
will definitively test these claims. Define what you will measure, and sketch one figure predicting your results.

advance a proposal. Be specific and concise. What approaches
might be taken to treat this disease?
1. Which of the following are features of two-photon micros-

copy? (See Advances Box 14-1.)
a. Excites fluorochromes with shorter wavelengths of light

than confocal microscopy
Achieves higher resolutions than confocal microscopy
Can be used to generate three-dimensional images
Can be used to generate time-lapse videos
Can penetrate tissue to deeper depths than confocal
microscopy
f. Damages tissue more seriously than confocal microscopy
b.
c.
d.
e.

2. You want to track the behavior of T cells specific for the

influenza virus in a mouse lymph node. You have a mouse
whose cells all express yellow fluorescent protein (YFP).
You decide to isolate T cells from this mouse and introduce them into a mouse that has been immunized with
influenza, as well as into a control mouse that was given
no antigen. You look at the lymph nodes of both mice,
expecting to see a difference in the behavior of the cells.
However, you do not see much of a difference. At first you
wonder if all you read is true—perhaps T cells do not
arrest when they encounter antigen! But then you realize
that your experimental design was flawed. What was the
problem?
3. Indicate whether each of the following statements is true or

false. If you think a statement is false, explain why.
a. Chemokines are chemoattractants for lymphocytes but

not other leukocytes.
b. T cells, but not B cells, express the chemokine receptor

CCR7.
c. Antigen can only come into the lymph node if it is asso-

ciated with an antigen-presenting cell.
d. Lymphocytes increase their motility after they engage

dendritic cells (DCs) expressing an antigen to which
they bind.
T cells crawl along the follicular DC network as they
scan DCs for antigen in the lymph node.
Lymphocytes make use of reticular networks only in
secondary lymphoid organs.
Leukocyte extravasation follows this sequence: adhesion, chemokine activation, rolling, transmigration.
Most secondary lymphoid organs contain high-endothelial venules (HEVs).

4. Provide an example of lymphocyte chemotaxis during an

immune response.

CLINICAL FOCUS QUESTION Leukocyte adhesion deficiency

I (LAD I) is a rare genetic disease that results from a defect
or deficiency in CD18. Patients with this condition usually do
not live past childhood because they cannot fight off bacterial
infections. Why? Given what you have learned in this chapter,

5. Describe where CD8 T cells and B cells receive T-cell help

6. How might the behavior of an antigen-specific CD8 T cell

differ in the lymph node of a CCL3-deficient animal versus
a wild-type animal?

generally similar mechanisms, although some differences
distinguish the two processes.

b. Which step requires chemokine activation and why?
c. Naïve lymphocytes generally do not enter tissues other

than the secondary lymphoid organs. What confines
them to this system?
8. Naïve T and naïve B-cell subpopulations migrate preferen-

tially into different parts of the lymph node. What is the
basis for this compartmentalization? Identify both structural and molecular influences.

Allergy, Hypersensitivities,

Inflammation

T

he same immune reactions that protect us from
infection can also inflict a great deal of damage,
not simply on a pathogen, but on our own cells
and tissues. As you have learned, the immune
response uses multiple strategies to reduce damage to
self by turning off responses when pathogen is cleared
and avoiding reactions to self antigens. However, these
checks and balances can break down, leading to
immune-mediated reactions that are more detrimental
than protective. Some immune-mediated disorders are
caused by a failure of immune tolerance. These
autoimmune disorders will be discussed in Chapter 16.
Others are caused by an inappropriately vigorous innate
and/or adaptive response to antigens that pose little or
no threat. These disorders, called hypersensitivities, will
be the main focus of this chapter. Finally, some disorders
are caused by a failure to turn off innate or adaptive
responses, resulting in a chronic inflammatory state. We
will close this chapter with a discussion of the causes
and consequences of chronic inflammation, a condition
that is of interest to many because of its intriguing
association with the current obesity epidemic.
Two French scientists, Paul Portier and Charles
Richet, were the first to recognize and describe
hypersensitivities. In the early twentieth century, as part
of their studies of the responses of bathers in the
Mediterranean to the stings of Portuguese man-o’-war
jellyfish (Physalia physalis), they demonstrated that the
toxic agent in the sting was a small protein. They
reasoned that eliciting an antibody response that could
neutralize the toxin may serve to protect the host.
Therefore, they injected low doses of the toxin into dogs
to elicit an immune response, and followed with a
booster injection a few weeks later. However, instead of
generating a protective antibody response, the
unfortunate dogs responded immediately to the second
injection with vomiting, diarrhea, asphyxia, and death.
Richet coined the term “anaphylaxis,” derived from the
Greek and translated loosely as “against protection” to
describe this overreaction of the immune system, the first
description of a hypersensitivity reaction. Richet was

subsequently awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology or
Medicine in 1913.
Since that time, immunologists have learned that there
are multiple types of hypersensitivity reactions. Immediate
hypersensitivity reactions result in symptoms that
manifest themselves within very short time periods after
the immune stimulus, like those described above. Other
types of hypersensitivity reactions take hours or days to
manifest themselves, and are referred to as delayed-type
hypersensitivity (DTH) reactions. In general, immediate
hypersensitivity reactions result from antibody-antigen
reactions, whereas DTH is caused by T-cell reactions.
As it became clear that different immune mechanisms
give rise to distinct hypersensitivity reactions, two
immunologists, P. G. H. Gell and R. R. A. Coombs,
proposed a classification scheme to discriminate among the
various types of hypersensitivity (see Figure 15-1). Type I
hypersensitivity reactions are mediated by IgE antibodies,

and include many of the most common allergies to
respiratory allergens, such as pollen and dust mites. Type II
hypersensitivity reactions result from the binding of IgG
or IgM to the surface of host cells, which are then destroyed
by complement- or cell-mediated mechanisms. In type III
hypersensitivity reactions, antigen-antibody complexes
deposited on host cells induce complement fixation and an
ensuing inflammatory response. Type lV hypersensitivity
reactions result from inappropriate T-cell activation. It
should be noted that, although this classification method
has proven to be a useful analytical and descriptive tool,
many clinical hypersensitivity disorders include molecular
and cellular contributions from components belonging to
more than one of these categories. The subdivisions are not
as frequently evoked in real-world clinical settings as they
once were.
The term allergy first appeared in the medical
literature in 1906, when the pediatrician Clemens von

Pirquet noted that the response to some antigens resulted
in damage to the host, rather than in a protective
response. Although most familiar respiratory allergies
result from the generation of IgE antibodies toward the
eliciting agent, and therefore are type I hypersensitivity
reactions, other common reactions that are associated
with allergy, such as the response to poison ivy, result
from T-cell-mediated, type IV responses.

Allergy: A Type I Hypersensitivity
Reaction
More than half of the U.S. population (54.3%) suffers from
type I hypersensitivity reactions, which encompass the most
common allergic reactions, including hay fever, asthma,
atopic dermatitis, and food allergies. The incidence of allergy
continues to rise in the human population, and understanding

Allergy, Hypersensitivities, and Chronic Inflammation
immune mechanisms behind the response has already led to
new therapies. Below we describe the molecular and cellular
participants in the various type I hypersensitivities, as well as
the rationale behind current treatments.

IgE Antibodies Are Responsible
for Type I Hypersensitivity
Type I hypersensitivity reactions (allergies) are initiated by the
interaction between an IgE antibody and a multivalent antigen. Classic Experiment Box 15-1 describes the brilliant series
of experiments by K. Ishizaka and T. Ishizaka in the 1960s and
1970s that led to the identification of IgE as the class of antibody responsible for allergies. In normal individuals, the level
of IgE in serum is the lowest of any of the immunoglobulin
classes, making further physiochemical studies of this molecule particularly difficult. It was not until the discovery of an
IgE-producing myeloma by Johansson and Bennich in 1967
that extensive analyses of IgE could be undertaken.

Many Allergens Can Elicit a Type I Response
Healthy individuals generate IgE antibodies only in response
to parasitic infections. However, some people, referred to as
atopic, are predisposed to generate IgE antibodies against
common environmental antigens, such as those listed in
Table 15-1. Chemical analysis revealed that most, if not all,
allergens are either protein or glycoprotein in nature, with
multiple antigenic sites, or epitopes, per molecule. For many
years, scientists tried unsuccessfully to find any structural
commonalities among molecules that induced distress in

CHAPTER 15

susceptible individuals, but recently several features shared
by many allergens have begun to provide clues to the biological basis of their activity.
First, many allergens have intrinsic enzymatic activity that
affects the immune response. For example, allergen extracts
from dust mites and cockroaches as well as from fungi and
bacteria are relatively high in protease activity. Some of these
proteases have been shown to be capable of disrupting the
integrity of epithelial cell junctions, and allowing allergens to
access the underlying cells and molecules of the innate and
adaptive immune systems. Others, including a protease (Der
p 1) produced by the dust mite, cleave and activate complement components at the mucosal surface. Still others cleave
and stimulate protease-activated receptors on the surfaces of
immune cells, enhancing inflammation. Thus, one factor that
distinguishes allergenic from nonallergenic molecules may
be the presence of enzymatic activity that affects the cells and
molecules of the immune system.
Second, many allergens contain potential pathogenassociated molecular patterns, or PAMPS (see Chapter 5),
capable of interacting with receptors of the innate immune
system, and initiating a cascade of responses leading to an
allergic response. However, it is unclear why this cascade is
stimulated in only a subset of individuals.
Third, many allergens enter the host via mucosal tissues at
very low concentrations, which tend to predispose the individual to generate TH2 responses, leading to B-cell secretion of IgE.

IgE Antibodies Act by Cross-Linking Fc␧
Receptors on the Surfaces of Innate
Immune Cells
IgE antibodies alone are not destructive. Instead, they cause
hypersensitivity by binding to Fc receptors specific for their
constant regions (Fc␧Rs). These are expressed by a variety of
innate immune cells, including mast cells, basophils, and
eosinophils (Chapter 2). The binding of IgE antibodies to
Fc␧Rs activates these granulocytes, inducing a signaling cascade that causes cells to release the contents of intracellular
granules into the blood, a process called degranulation (see
Figure 15-2). The contents of granules vary from cell to cell,
but typically include histamine, heparin, and proteases.
Together with other mediators that are synthesized by activated granulocytes (leukotrienes, prostaglandins, chemokines, and cytokines), these mediators act on surrounding
tissues and other immune cells, causing allergy symptoms.
Interestingly, the serum half-life of IgE is quite short (only
2 to 3 days). However, when bound to its receptor on an innate
immune cell, IgE is stable for weeks. IgE actually binds two
different receptors, the high-affinity Fc␧RI, which is responsible for most of the symptoms we associate with allergy, and
the lower-affinity Fc␧RII, which regulates the production of
IgE by B cells, as well as its transport across cells (Chapter 13).
The role of Fc␧RI in type I hypersensitivities is confirmed by
experiments conducted in mice that lack an Fc␧RI ␣ chain;
they are resistant to localized and systemic allergic responses,
despite having normal numbers of mast cells.

The Immune System in Health and Disease

CLASSIC EXPERIMENT

The Discovery and Identification of IgE as the Carrier
of Allergic Hypersensitivity
In a stunning series of papers published between 1966 and the mid-1970s,
Kimishige Ishizaka and Teruko Ishizaka,
working with a number of collaborators,
identified a new class of immunoglobulins,
which they called IgE antibodies, as being
the major effector molecules in type 1
antibody-mediated hypersensitivity
reactions.
The Ishizakas built on work performed
in 1921 by K. Prausnitz and H. Kustner, who
injected serum from an allergic person
into the skin of a nonallergic individual.
When the appropriate antigen was later
injected into the same site, a wheal and
flare reaction (swelling and reddening)
was detected. This reaction, called the P-K
reaction after its originators, was the basis
for the first biological assay for IgE activity.
In their now classic experiments, the
Ishizakas assayed for the presence of allergen-specific antibody using the wheal and
flare reaction. They also employed radioimmunodiffusion, using the ability of
radioactive allergen E derived from ragweed pollen to bind to and precipitate
pollen-specific antibodies as an additional
assay; the antibodies formed a radioactive
precipitate on binding to the ragweed
allergen. (Note that both the antigen and
the immunoglobulin class are designated
“E” in this series of experiments.)
The Ishizakas reasoned that the best
starting material for purifying the protein

responsible for the P-K reaction would be
the serum of an allergic individual who
displayed hypersensitivity to ragweed pollen E. (Serum is that component of the
blood remaining after the cells and clotting
components have been removed.) To
purify the serum protein responsible for
the allergic reaction, they took whole
human serum and subjected it to ammonium sulfate precipitation (different proteins
precipitate out at varying concentrations
of ammonium sulfate), and ion exchange
chromatography, which separates proteins
on the basis of their intrinsic charge.
Different fractions from the chromatography column were tested by radioimmunodiffusion for their ability to bind
to radioactive antigen E from ragweed
pollen. Portions of the different fractions
were also injected at varying dilutions into
volunteers, along with antigen, to test for
a P-K reaction. Finally, each fraction was
also tested semiquantitatively for the
presence of IgG and IgA antibodies. The
results of these experiments are shown for
the serum from one of the three individuals they tested (see Table 1 below).
From the results in this table, it is clear
that the ability of proteins in the various
fractions to induce a P-K reaction did not
correlate with the amounts of either IgG
or IgA antibodies, but it did correlate with
the amounts of antibodies that could be
detected in an immunodiffusion reaction

The High-Affinity IgE Receptor, Fc␧RI
Mast cells and basophils constitutively express high levels of
the high-affinity IgE receptor, Fc␧RI, which binds IgE with an
exceptionally high-affinity constant of 1010M⫺1. This affinity
helps overcome the difficulties associated with responding to
an exceptionally low concentration of IgE in the serum
(1.3 ⫻ 10⫺7 M). Eosinophils, Langerhans cells, monocytes,
and platelets also express Fc␧RI, although at lower levels.
Most cells express a tetrameric form of Fc␧RI, which
includes an ␣ and ␤ chain and two identical disulfide-linked
␥ chains (Figure 15-3a). Monocytes and platelets express an
alternative form lacking the ␤ chain. The ␣ chains of the
Fc␧RI, members of the immunoglobulin superfamily, directly

with radioactive antigen E. Perhaps
another antibody class was responsible
for the line of immunoprecipitation on
the immunodiffusion gel?
The fractions containing the highest
concentration of protein able to bind to
allergen E were further purified using gel
chromatography, which separates proteins
on the basis of size and molecular shape.
Again, the presence of the protein was
detected on the basis of its ability to bind
to radioactive antigen E and to induce a
P-K reaction in the skin of a test subject
who had been injected with antigen E.
The resulting protein still contained
small amounts of IgG and IgA antibodies,
which were eliminated by mixing the fractions with antibodies directed toward
those human antibody subclasses, and
then removing the resultant immunoprecipitate. The Ishizakas’ final protein product
was 500 to 1000 times more potent than
the original serum in its ability to generate
a P-K reaction, and the most active preparation generated a positive skin reaction at
a dilution of 1:8000. None of its reactivities
correlated with the presence of any of the
other known classes of antibody, and so a
new class of antibody was named, IgE,
based on its ability to bind to allergens and
bring about a P-K reaction.
As described in Chapter 3, the level of
IgE in the serum is the lowest of all the
antibody classes, falling within the range

bind the IgE heavy chains, whereas the ␤ and ␥ chains are
responsible for signal transduction. They contain immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motifs (ITAMs) (see Chapter 3) that are phosphorylated in response to IgE cross-linking.
IgE-mediated signaling begins when an allergen crosslinks IgE that is bound to the surface Fc␧RI receptor (Figure
15-2). Although the specific biochemical events that follow
cross-linking of the Fc␧RI receptor vary among cells and
modes of stimulation, the Fc␧RI signaling cascade generally
resembles that initiated by antigen receptors and growth factor receptors (Chapter 3). Briefly, IgE cross-linking induces
the aggregation and migration of receptors into membrane
lipid rafts, followed by phosphorylation of ITAM motifs by

concentration of IgE in their circulation.
However, in 1967, Johansson and Bennich
discovered an IgE-producing myeloma,
which enabled a full biochemical analysis
of the molecule. The structure of IgE is
described in Chapter 3.
In Table 1, which is modified from the
original data in this classic 1967 paper,
serum protein fractions from two separate
donors were evaluated for the relative
amounts of IgA or IgG (referred to as ␥A
and ␥G, respectively, in this publication),

using rabbit antisera against the two
immunoglobulin subclasses, and for the
presence of the putative “IgE” using radioimmunodiffusion (as described in this
chapter’s text). IgG is the most common
class of immunoglobulin in serum, and
IgA was included because early experiments had suggested that IgA may be the
antibody responsible for the wheal and
flare reaction. The “Minimum dose for P-K”
column refers to the quantity of the fraction required to yield a measureable
wheal and flare response. In this column,
the lower the number, the higher the

associated tyrosine kinases. Adapter molecules then latch
onto the phosphorylated tyrosine residues and initiate signaling cascades culminating in enzyme and/or transcription
factor activation. Figure 15-4 identifies just a few of the signaling events specifically associated with mast cell activation.
Fc␧RI signaling leads to mast cell and basophil (1)
degranulation of vesicles containing multiple inflammatory
mediators (Figure 15-5a), (2) expression of inflammatory
cytokines and (3) conversion of arachidonic acid into leukotrienes and prostaglandins, two important lipid mediators
of inflammation. These mediators have multiple short-term
and long-term effects on tissues that will be described in
more detail below (Figure 15-5b).

fraction (i.e., fraction B had the highest
amount of the allergenic antibody).
It can readily be seen that the fractions
showing the strongest P-K responses (highlighted arrows: n) are also those in which
the highest amounts of the so-called ␥E
were measured by radio-immunodiffusion.
P-K reactions did not correlate with either
IgG or with IgA levels in the serum from
this, or from two other donors.

The Low-Affinity IgE Receptor, Fc␧RII
The other IgE receptor, designated Fc␧RII, or CD23, has a much
lower affinity for IgE (Kd of 1 ⫻ 106 M⫺1) (Figure 15-3b). CD23
is structurally distinct from Fc␧RI (it is a lectin and a type II
membrane protein) and exists in two isoforms that differ only
slightly in the N-terminal cytoplasmic domain. CD23a is found
on activated B cells, whereas CD23b is induced on various cell
types by the cytokine IL-4. Both isoforms also exist as membrane-bound and soluble forms, the latter being generated by
proteolysis of the surface molecule. Interestingly, CD23 binds
not only to IgE, but also to the complement receptor CD21.
The outcome of CD23 ligation depends on which ligands
it binds to (IgE or CD21) and whether it does so as a soluble

leads to cross-linking of the bound IgE, triggering the release of pharmacologically active mediators (vasoactive amines) from mast cells and
basophils. The mediators cause smooth muscle contraction, increased vascular permeability, and vasodilation.

FIGURE 15-4 Signaling pathways initiated by IgE allergen
cross-linking. By cross-linking Fc␧ receptors, IgE initiates signals that
lead to mast cell degranulation, cytokine expression, and leukotriene
and prostaglandin generation. The signaling cascades initiated by the
Fc␧RI are similar to those initiated by antigen receptors (see Chapter 3). This figure illustrates only a few of the players in the complex
signaling network. Briefly, cross-linking of Fc␧RI activates tyrosine
kinases, including Lyn, which phosphorylate adaptor molecules,
which organize signaling responses that lead to activation of multiple
kinases, including protein kinase C (PKC) and various mitogen-activated
protein kinases (MAPKs). These, in turn, activate transcription factors (e.g., NF␬B) that regulate cytokine production. They also activate
lipases, including phospholipase D (PLD), which regulates degranulation, and phospholipase A (PLA), which regulates the metabolism of
the leukotriene and prostaglandin precursor arachidonic acid. [K. Roth,

high-affinity IgE receptor-mediated mast cell activation, Archivum immunologiae et therapiae experimentalis 56:385–399.]

or membrane-bound molecule. For example, when soluble CD23 (sCD23) binds to CD21 on the surface of IgEsynthesizing B cells, IgE synthesis is increased. However,
when membrane-bound CD23 binds to soluble IgE, further
IgE synthesis is suppressed. Atopic individuals express relatively high levels of surface and soluble CD23.

IgE Receptor Signaling Is Tightly Regulated
Given the powerful nature of the molecular mediators
released by mast cells, basophils, and eosinophils following
Fc␧RI signaling, it should come as no surprise that the
responses are subject to complex systems of regulation.
Below we offer just a few examples of ways in which signaling through the Fc␧RI receptor can be inhibited.
Co-Clustering with Inhibitory Receptors
Recall from earlier chapters that the intracellular regions of
some lymphocyte receptors, including Fc␥RIIB, bear immu-

/Volumes/203/MHR00209/siL52070/disk1of1/0071052070

CHAPTER 15

noreceptor tyrosine inhibitory motifs (ITIMs as distinct from
ITAMs) (see Figure 13-3). Cross-linking of these receptors
leads to inhibition, rather than to activation of cellular
responses. Interestingly, mast cells express both the activating
Fc␧RI and inhibiting Fc␥RIIB. Therefore, if an allergen binds
both IgG and IgE molecules, it will trigger signals through
both Fc receptors. The inhibitory signal dominates. This phenomenon is part of the reason that eliciting IgG antibodies
against common allergens through desensitization therapies
can help atopic patients. The more anti-allergen IgG they
have, the higher the probability that allergens will co-cluster
Fc␧RI receptors with inhibitory Fc␥RIIB receptors.
Inhibition of Downstream Signaling Molecules
Because many of the reactions in the activation pathway
downstream from the Fc␧RI pathways are phosphorylations,
multiple phosphatases, such as SHPs, SHIPs, and PTEN, play
an important role in dampening receptor signaling. In addition, the tyrosine kinase, Lyn, can play a negative as well as a
positive role in Fc␧RI signaling by phosphorylating and activating the inhibitory Fc␥RIIB. Finally, Fc␧RI signaling
through Lyn and Syk kinases also activates E3 ubiquitin
ligases, including c-Cbl. Cbl ubiquitinylates Lyn and Syk, as
well as Fc␧RI itself, triggering their degradation. Thus, Fc␧RI
activity contributes to its own demise.

Innate Immune Cells Produce Molecules
Responsible for Type I Hypersensitivity
Symptoms
The molecules released in response to Fc␧RI cross-linking by
mast cells, basophils, and eosinophils are responsible for the
clinical manifestations of type I hypersensitivity. These
inflammatory mediators act on local tissues as well as on
populations of secondary effector cells, including other
eosinophils, neutrophils, T lymphocytes, monocytes, and
platelets.
When generated in response to parasitic infection, these
mediators initiate beneficial defense processes, including
vasodilation and increased vascular permeability, which
brings an influx of plasma and inflammatory cells to attack
the pathogen. They also inflict direct damage on the parasite.
In contrast, mediator release induced by allergens results in
unnecessary increases in vascular permeability and inflammation that lead to tissue damage with little benefit.
The molecular mediators can be classified as either primary or secondary (Table 15-2). Primary mediators are
preformed and stored in granules prior to cell activation,
whereas secondary mediators are either synthesized after
target-cell activation or released by the breakdown of membrane phospholipids during the degranulation process. The
most significant primary mediators are histamine, proteases,
eosinophil chemotactic factor (ECF), neutrophil chemotactic factor (NCF), and heparin. Secondary mediators include
platelet-activating factor (PAF), leukotrienes, prostaglandins, bradykinins, and various cytokines and chemokines.

Various effects (see text)

The varying manifestations of type I hypersensitivity in different tissues and species reflect variations in the primary
and secondary mediators present. Below we briefly describe
the main biological effects of several key mediators.
Histamine
Histamine, which is formed by decarboxylation of the amino
acid histidine, is a major component of mast-cell granules,
accounting for about 10% of granule weight. Its biological
effects are observed within minutes of mast-cell activation.
Once released from mast cells, histamine binds one of four different histamine receptors, designated H1, H2, H3, and H4.
These receptors have different tissue distributions and mediate
different effects on histamine binding. Serotonin is also present
in the mast cells of rodents and has effects similar to histamine.
Most of the biologic effects of histamine in allergic reactions are mediated by the binding of histamine to H1 receptors. This binding induces contraction of intestinal and
bronchial smooth muscles, increased permeability of venules
(small veins), and increased mucous secretion. Interaction of
histamine with H2 receptors increases vasopermeability (due
to contraction of endothelial cells) and vasodilation (by relaxing the smooth muscle of blood vessels), stimulates exocrine
glands, and increases the release of acid in the stomach. Binding of histamine to H2 receptors on mast cells and basophils
suppresses degranulation; thus, histamine ultimately exerts
negative feedback on the further release of mediators.

Leukotrienes and Prostaglandins
As secondary mediators, the leukotrienes and prostaglandins
are not formed until the mast cell undergoes degranulation and
phospholipase signaling initiates the enzymatic breakdown of
phospholipids in the plasma membrane. An ensuing enzymatic
cascade generates the prostaglandins and the leukotrienes.
In a type I hypersensitivity-mediated asthmatic response,
the initial contraction of human bronchial and tracheal
smooth muscles is at first mediated by histamine; however,
within 30 to 60 seconds, further contraction is signaled by
leukotrienes and prostaglandins. Active at nanomole levels,
the leukotrienes are approximately 1000 times more effective
at mediating bronchoconstriction than is histamine, and
they are also more potent stimulators of vascular permeability and mucus secretion. In humans, the leukotrienes are
thought to contribute significantly to the prolonged bronchospasm and buildup of mucus seen in asthmatics.
Cytokines and Chemokines
Adding to the complexity of the type I reaction is the variety
of cytokines released from mast cells and basophils. Mast
cells, basophils, and eosinophils secrete several interleukins,
including IL-4, IL-5, IL-8, IL-13, GM-CSF, and TNF-␣.
These cytokines alter the local microenvironment and lead
to the recruitment of inflammatory cells such as neutrophils
and eosinophils. For instance, IL-4 and IL-13 stimulate a
TH2 response and thus increase IgE production by B cells.

The Immune System in Health and Disease

IL-5 is especially important in the recruitment and activation
of eosinophils. The high concentrations of TNF-␣ secreted
by mast cells may contribute to shock in systemic anaphylaxis. IL-8 acts as a chemotactic factor, and attracts further
neutrophils, basophils, and various subsets of T cells to the
site of the hypersensitivity response. GM-CSF stimulates the
production and activation of myeloid cells, including granulocytes and macrophages.

Type I Hypersensitivities Are Characterized
by Both Early and Late Responses
Type I hypersensitivity responses are divided into an immediate early response and one or more late phase responses
(Figure 15-6). The early response occurs within minutes of
allergen exposure and, as described above, results from the
release of histamine, leukotrienes, and prostaglandins from
local mast cells.
However, hours after the immediate phase of a type I
hypersensitivity reaction begins to subside, mediators released
during the course of the reaction induce localized inflammation, called the late-phase reaction. Cytokines released from
mast cells, particularly TNF-␣ and IL-1, increase the expression of cell adhesion molecules on venular endothelial cells,
thus facilitating the influx of neutrophils, eosinophils, and
TH2 cells that characterizes this phase of the response.
Eosinophils play a principal role in the late-phase reaction. Eosinophil chemotactic factor, released by mast cells
during the initial reaction, attracts large numbers of eosinophils to the affected site. Cytokines released at the site,
including IL-3, IL-5, and GM-CSF, contribute to the growth
and differentiation of these cells, which are then activated by
binding of antibody-coated antigen. This leads to degranulation and further release of inflammatory mediators that
contribute to the extensive tissue damage typical of the latephase reaction. Neutrophils, another major participant in
late-phase reactions, are attracted to the site of an ongoing
type I reaction by neutrophil chemotactic factor released
from degranulating mast cells. Once activated, the neutrophils release their granule contents, including lytic enzymes,
platelet-activating factor, and leukotrienes.
Recently, a third phase of type I hypersensitivity has
been described in models of type I hypersensitivity reactions in the skin. This third phase starts around 3 days post
antigen challenge and peaks at day 4. It is also characterized by massive eosinophil infiltration but, in contrast to
the second phase, requires the presence of basophils. As
shown in Figure 15-7, which illustrates an example of the
late-phase responses in the mouse ear, cytokines and proteases released from basophils act on tissue-resident cells
such as fibroblasts. These fibroblasts then secrete chemokines that are responsible for the recruitment of larger
numbers of eosinophils and neutrophils to the skin lesion.
Subsequent degranulation of the eosinophils and neutrophils adds to the considerable tissue damage at the site of
the initial allergen contact. These experiments illustrate

how multiple granulocyte subsets can cooperate in the
induction of chronic allergic inflammation.

There Are Several Categories of Type I
Hypersensitivity Reactions
The clinical manifestations of type I reactions can range
from life-threatening conditions, such as systemic anaphylaxis and severe asthma, to localized reactions, such as hay
fever and eczema. The nature of the clinical symptoms
depends on the route by which the allergen enters the body,
as well as on its concentration and on the prior allergen
exposure of the host. In this section, we describe the pathology of the various type I hypersensitivity reactions.
Systemic Anaphylaxis
Systemic anaphylaxis is a shocklike and often fatal state that
occurs within minutes of exposure to an allergen. It is usually
initiated by an allergen introduced directly into the bloodstream or absorbed from the gut or skin. Symptoms include
labored respiration, a precipitous drop in blood pressure leading to anaphylactic shock, followed by contraction of smooth
muscles leading to defecation, urination, and bronchiolar
constriction. This leads to asphyxiation, which can lead to
death within 2 to 4 minutes of exposure to the allergen. These
symptoms are all due to rapid antibody-mediated degranulation of mast cells and the systemic effects of their contents.
A wide range of antigens has been shown to trigger this
reaction in susceptible humans, including the venom from
bee, wasp, hornet, and ant stings; drugs such as penicillin,
insulin, and antitoxins; and foods such as seafood and nuts.
If not treated quickly, these reactions can be fatal. Epinephrine, the drug of choice for treating systemic anaphylactic
reactions, counteracts the effects of mediators such as histamine and the leukotrienes, relaxing the smooth muscles of
the airways and reducing vascular permeability. Epinephrine
also improves cardiac output, which is necessary to prevent
vascular collapse during an anaphylactic reaction.
Localized Hypersensitivity Reactions
In localized hypersensitivity reactions (atopy), the pathology
is limited to a specific target tissue or organ, and often occurs
at the epithelial surfaces first exposed to allergens. Atopic
allergies include a wide range of IgE-mediated disorders,
such as allergic rhinitis (hay fever), asthma, atopic dermatitis
(eczema), and food allergies.
The most common atopic disorder, affecting almost 50%
of the U.S. population, is allergic rhinitis or hay fever. Symptoms result from the inhalation of common airborne allergens (pollens, dust, viral antigens), which react with IgE
molecules bound to sensitized mast cells in the conjunctivae
and nasal mucosa. Cross-linking of IgE receptors induces the
release of histamine and heparin from mast cells, which then
cause vasodilation, increased capillary permeability, and production of exudates in the eyes and respiratory tract. Tearing,
runny nose, sneezing, and coughing are the main symptoms.

into the dermis of the ear (1) and are activated by IgE/antigen complexes (2). They release cytokines and other inflammatory mediators

Alternatively, an asthma attack can be induced by exercise or
cold, apparently independently of allergen stimulation
(intrinsic asthma).
Like hay fever, allergic asthma is triggered by activation and
degranulation of mast cells, with subsequent release of inflammatory mediators, but instead of occurring in the nasal
mucosa, the reaction develops deeper in the lower respiratory
tract. Contraction of the bronchial smooth muscles, mucus
secretion, and swelling of the tissues surrounding the airway all
contribute to bronchial constriction and airway obstruction.
Asthmatic patients may be genetically predisposed to
atopic responses. Some, for instance, have abnormal levels of
receptors for neuropeptides (substance P) that contract
smooth muscles and decreased expression of receptors for
vasoactive intestinal peptide, which relaxes smooth muscles.
Atopic dermatitis (allergic eczema) is an inflammatory
disease of skin and another example of an atopic condition.
It is observed most frequently in young children, often
developing during infancy. Serum IgE levels are usually elevated. The affected individual develops erythematous (red)
skin eruptions that fill with pus if there is an accompanying
bacterial infection. Unlike a DTH reaction, which involves
TH1 cells (see below), the skin lesions in atopic dermatitis
contain TH2 cells and an increased number of eosinophils.
Food Allergies: A Common Type of Atopy on the Rise
Food allergies, whose incidence is on the rise, are another
common type of atopy. In children, food allergies account

neutrophils to the tissue, contributing to a chronic inflammation and

roles of basophils in immunity, Annual Review of Immunology 29:45–69.]

for more anaphylactic responses than any other type of
allergy. They are highest in frequency among infants and
toddlers (6%–8%) and decrease slightly with maturity.
Approximately 4% of adults display reproducible allergic
reactions to food.
The most common food allergens for children are found
in cow’s milk, eggs, peanuts, tree nuts, soy, wheat, fish, and
shellfish. Among adults, nuts, fish, and shellfish are the predominant culprits. Most major food allergens are water-soluble
glycoproteins that are relatively stable to heat, acid, and proteases and, therefore, digest slowly. Some food allergens
(e.g., the major glycoprotein in peanuts, Ara h 1) are also
capable of acting directly as an adjuvant and promoting a
TH2 response and IgE production in susceptible individuals.
Allergen cross-linking of IgE on mast cells along the upper
or lower gastrointestinal tract can induce localized smooth
muscle contraction and vasodilation and thus such symptoms as vomiting or diarrhea. Mast-cell degranulation along
the gut can increase the permeability of mucous membranes,
so that the allergen enters the bloodstream. Basophils also
play a significant role in acute food allergy symptoms.
Several hypotheses have been advanced to explain why
some individuals become sensitive to antigens that are well
tolerated by the rest of the population. One possibility is that
a temporary viral or bacterial infection may lead to a shortlived increase in the permeability of the gut surface, allowing
increased absorption of allergenic antigens and sensitization.
Alternatively, sensitization may occur via the respiratory

route or via absorption of allergens through the skin. This is
thought to be the case for one type of allergic reaction to
apple proteins. Exposure to birch pollen can induce respiratory type I hypersensitivity, and the IgE that is generated
cross-reacts to a protein from apples, leading to a severe
digestive allergic response. Finally, various dietary conditions may bias an individual’s responses in the direction of
TH2 generation. These include reduced dietary antioxidants,
altered fat consumption, and over- or under-provision of
Vitamin D. Table 15-3 lists various immune mechanisms
that play a role in food allergy. Note that although most are
IgE mediated, some are mediated by T cells.
The efficiency of the gut barrier improves with maturity,
and the food allergies of many infants resolve without treatment as they grow, even though allergen-specific IgE can still
be detected in their blood. However, resolution is not always
achieved, and in some cases the continuation of the allergic
state reflects a reduced frequency of regulatory T cells in
allergic versus nonallergic individuals.
Depending on where the allergen is deposited, patients
with atopic dermatitis and food hypersensitivity can also
exhibit other symptoms. For example, some individuals

develop asthmatic attacks after ingesting certain foods. Others develop atopic urticaria, commonly known as hives,
when a food allergen is carried to sensitized mast cells in the
skin, causing swollen (edematous), erythematous eruptions.

There Is a Genetic Basis for
Type I Hypersensitivity
The susceptibility of individuals to atopic responses has a
strong genetic component that has been mapped to several
possible loci by candidate gene association studies, genomewide linkage analyses, and genome expression studies (see
Clinical Focus Box 15-2). As might be expected from the
pathogenesis of allergy and asthma, many of the associated
gene loci encode proteins involved in the generation and
regulation of immune responsiveness (e.g., innate immune
receptors, cytokines and chemokines and their receptors,
MHC proteins) as well as with airway remodeling (e.g.,
growth factors and proteolytic enzymes). Other proteins that
have been implicated in the hereditary predisposition to
allergy and asthma include transcription factors and proteins that regulate epigenetic modifications.

The Immune System in Health and Disease

CLINICAL FOCUS

The Genetics of Asthma and Allergy
It has long been appreciated that a
predisposition to asthma and allergic
responses runs strongly in families, suggesting the presence of an hereditary
component. In addition, twin studies in
humans and mice have implicated both
environmental and epigenetic, as well as
genetic, factors in determining the susceptibility of an individual to hypersensitivity responses. With this degree of
complexity, it is not surprising that the
identification of the genes involved in
controlling an individual’s vulnerability to
hypersensitivity responses has proven to
be a difficult task. However, since the late
1980s, the geneticist’s toolkit has markedly expanded with the availability of
genome wide sequence information in
addition to libraries of single nucleotide
polymorphisms (SNPs). These tools,
along with more classical genetic
approaches have been used to map
hypersensitivity susceptibility genes.
One approach to determining which
genes are associated with a particular
pathological state is to use knowledge of
the disease to develop and then genetically test an hypothesis regarding potential candidate genes (i.e. “educated
guesses”). For example, we know that
asthma is associated with high numbers
of differentiated TH2 cells, and high levels
of IL-4 expression introduce a bias in the
differentiation of activated CD4 T cells
toward the TH2 state. We can therefore
hypothesize that asthma sufferers may

exhibit polymorphisms in structural or
regulatory regions of the IL-4 gene,
leading to unusually high levels of IL-4
production.
Using this theoretical framework,
geneticists selected a region on human
chromosome 5, 5q31-33, for detailed
analysis. This region contains a cluster of
cytokine genes, among which are the
genes for IL-3, IL-4, IL-5, IL-9, and IL-13, as
well as the gene encoding granulocytemacrophage colony stimulating factor.
Careful study of this region revealed a
polymorphism associated with the predisposition to asthma that maps to the
promoter region of IL-4—a confirmation
of the hypothesis advanced above. In
addition, two alleles of IL-9 associated
with a predisposition to atopy were also
identified.
A second approach starts with a statistically based search for genes associated
with particular disease states and is
referred to as a genome wide association survey (GWAS). The genomes of
individuals who do and those who do not
have the disease in question are mapped
with respect to the presence of SNPs. Statistically significant association of disease
with a particular polymorphism then provides the motivation for detailed sequence
analysis in the region of the SNP, and a
search for likely candidate genes. Cloning
of genes begins in the region identified by
the candidate SNP and then proceeds by
a sequential search of contiguous

Diagnostic Tests and Treatments Are Available
for Type I Hypersensitivity Reactions
Type I hypersensitivity is commonly assessed by skin testing,
an inexpensive and relatively safe diagnostic approach that
allows screening of a wide range of antigens at once. Small
amounts of potential allergens are introduced at specific skin
sites (e.g., the forearm or back), either by intradermal injection or by dropping onto a site of a superficial scratch. Thirty
minutes later, the sites are reexamined. Redness and swelling

sequences until a gene of interest is identified. This technique is referred to as
positional cloning, and several genes
important in asthma and atopy have been
identified in this way.
Figure 1 illustrates some of the products of genes already identified as having
polymorphisms relevant to the development of asthma or atopy. However, this
investigation is far from complete. Sometimes the same SNP has been shown to
have different effects in various racial or
ethnic populations, illustrating the complexity of such disease-associated genetic
studies.

(the result of local mast cell degranulation) indicate an allergic response (Figure 15-8). Less commonly, physicians may
elect to measure the serum levels of either total or allergenspecific IgE using ELISA or Western blot technologies (see
Chapter 20).
Treatment of type I hypersensitivity reactions always
begins with measures to avoid the causative agents. However, no one can avoid contact with aeroallergens such as
pollen, and a number of immunological and pharmaceutical
interventions are now available.

Products of genes that exhibit polymorphisms associated with predisposition to allergy. The genes coding for the products shown
have been discovered by multiple genome wide survey techniques. They can be divided into three broad categories. One group of genes codes for proteins
that trigger an immune response. These include pattern recognition receptors (TLR2, TLR4, TLR6), pollen receptors (Prostaglandin E2 receptor), and inhibitory
cytokines (IL-10, TGF␤), as well as genes coding for proteins that regulate antigen presentation (MHC class II). Another group of genes codes for proteins that
regulate TH2 differentiation and innate immune cell responses. These include polarizing cytokines (IL-4, IL-12), signaling and transcriptional regulators (STAT6,
T-bet GATA3), Fc␧ receptors, effector cytokines (IL-4, IL-5, and IL-13), and cytokine receptors (IL-4R, IL-5R, IL-13R). Another group of genes is expressed by epithelial
cells and smooth muscle cells and codes for proteins that regulate the tissue response. These include chemokines (CCL6), defensins (Defensin ␤2), and other
signaling molecules. [Vercelli, D. Discovering susceptibility genes for asthma and allergy. Nature Reviews. Immunology 8:169–182.]

Hyposensitization
For many years, physicians have been treating allergic
patients with repeated exposure (via ingestion or injection)
to increasing doses of allergens, in a regimen termed hyposensitization or immunotherapy. This mode of treatment
attacks the disease mechanism of the allergic individual at
the source and, when it works, is by far the most effective
way to manage allergies. Hyposensitization can reduce or
even eliminate symptoms for months or years after the
desensitization course is complete.

How does hyposensitization work? Two main mechanisms have been proposed (Figure 15-9). Repeated exposure
to low doses of allergen may induce an increase in regulatory
T cells producing the immunosuppressive cytokines TGF-␤
and/or IL-10 (a form of tolerance). It may also induce an
increase in noninflammatory IgG (specifically IgG4) antibodies specific for the allergens (desensitization). These
antibodies either competitively inhibit IgE binding or induce
co-clustering of antigen with inhibitory Fc receptors as
described above. Regardless of mechanism, hyposensitization

FIGURE 15-9 Mechanisms underlying hyposensitization
results in a reduction of allergen-specific TH2 cells, and a
concomitant decrease in eosinophils, basophils, mast cells,
and neutrophils in the target organs.
Although often strikingly successful, hyposensitization
does not work in every individual for every allergen. Patients
whose disease is refractory to hyposensitization, or who
choose not to use it, can try other therapeutic strategies that
have taken advantage of our growing knowledge of mechanisms behind mast cell degranulation and the activity of
hypersensitivity mediators.
Antihistamines, Leukotriene Antagonists,
and Inhalation Corticosteroids
For many years now, antihistamines have been the most
useful drugs for the treatment of allergic rhinitis. These
drugs inhibit histamine activity by binding and blocking
histamine receptors on target cells. The H1 receptors are
blocked by the first-generation antihistamines such as
diphenhydramine and chlorpheniramine, which are quite
effective in controlling the symptoms of allergic rhinitis.
Unfortunately, since they are capable of crossing the
blood-brain barrier, they also act on H1 receptors in the
nervous system and have multiple side effects. Because
these first-generation drugs bind to muscarinic acetylcholine receptors, they can also induce dry mouth, urinary
retention, constipation, slow heartbeat, and sedation.
Second-generation antihistamines such as fexofenadine,
loratidine, and desloratidine were developed in the early
1980s, and exhibit significantly less cross-reactivity with
muscarinic receptors.
Leukotriene antagonists, specifically montelukast, have
also been used to treat type I hypersensitivities and are com-

treatment for type I allergy. This figure illustrates two major
mechanisms that are likely to contribute to successful hyposensitization treatment (immunotherapy). Repeated injection or ingestion of low doses of antigen may lead to immune tolerance via the
induction of regulatory T cells that quell the immune response to the
allergen. Alternatively or in addition, it may induce the generation of
IgG antibodies (specifically IgG4), which either compete with IgE for
binding to antigen or induce co-clustering of Fc␧RI with inhibitory
Fc␥RII receptors (see chapter text). This inhibits basophil and mast cell
activity, reducing symptoms (desensitization). [A. M. Scurlock, B. P. Vickery, J. O’B. Hourihane, and A. W. Burks, 2010, Pediatric food allergy and mucosal
tolerance, Mucosal Immunology 3(4):345–354, www.nature.com/mi/journal/
v3/n4/fig_tab/mi201021f1.html.]

parable in effectiveness to antihistamines. Finally, inhalation
therapy with low-dose corticosteroids reduces inflammation
by inhibiting innate immune cell activity and has been used
successfully to reduce frequency and severity of asthma
attacks.
Immunotherapeutics
Therapeutic anti-IgE antibodies have been developed; one
such antibody, omalizumab, has been approved by the FDA
and is available as a pharmacological agent. Omalizumab
binds the Fc region of IgE and interferes with IgE-Fc␧R
interactions. This reagent has been used to treat both allergic
rhinitis and allergic asthma. However, for the treatment of
allergic rhinitis, omalizumab is no more effective than secondgeneration antihistamines and is rarely prescribed because
of its higher cost. Other monoclonal reagents are also being
evaluated for their clinical value.

Allergy, Hypersensitivities, and Chronic Inflammation
Other Medications Used to Control Allergic Asthma
In addition to prescribing therapies that focus on inhibiting
the molecular and cellular causes of type I hypersensitivities,
physicians prescribe drugs that alleviate the symptoms. In
particular, drugs that enhance production of the second
messenger cAMP help to counter the bronchoconstriction of
asthma and the degranulation of mast cells. Epinephrine, or
epinephrine agonists (like albuterol), do this by binding to
their G protein-coupled receptors, which generate signals
that generate cAMP (see Chapter 3). Theophylline, another
commonly used drug in the treatment of asthma, does this
by antagonizing phosphodiesterase (PDE), which normally
breaks down cAMP.

The Hygiene Hypothesis Has Been Advanced
to Explain Increases in Allergy Incidence
Asthma incidence has increased dramatically in the developed world over the past two decades. This observation supported suggestions that reduction in air quality associated
with industrialization played a role in respiratory hypersensitivity. Indeed, the incidence and severity of asthma among
those growing up in inner cities is significantly higher. However, it became clear that air quality, although very important, was not the only factor contributing to the increase in
asthma incidence.
Another contributing cause was suggested by surprising
studies from Europe, the United States, Australia, and New
Zealand demonstrating that children exposed to a farm
environment either prenatally or neonatally were significantly less likely to suffer from hay fever, atopic dermatitis,
asthma, and wheezing compared with the control population. In addition, exposure of a pregnant mother or baby to
barns and stables, farm animals, hay and grain products,
and/or unprocessed cow’s milk all resulted in a decreased
tendency to develop type I hypersensitivity later in life.
Exposure of children to day care situations and older siblings
also correlated with a reduction in asthma incidence. What
all these conditions have in common is early exposure to
pathogens and potential allergens.
Intrigued by this commonality, investigators advanced
the hygiene hypothesis, which proposed that exposure to
some pathogens during infancy and youth benefits individuals by stimulating immune responses and establishing a
healthy balance of T-cell subset activities so that no one
response dominates. For instance, the immune system of
newborn babies may be biased in the TH2 direction by the
uterine environment. TH1-TH2 balance may be restored by
the occurrence of infections in the developing neonate.
However, in the sanitary conditions promoted by Western
medicine, the neonatal immune system may not have the
exposure to infections that would otherwise reorient it to
generate TH1-type responses.
Evidence that pathogen exposure induces NK-mediated
interferon ␥ secretion, which biases the responses of the

subject away from the TH2 direction and thus away from
antibody production that contributes to asthma and other
allergies, also supports this view. Other investigations, however, focus on the possibility that exposure to viral, bacterial,
and parasitic pathogens helps establish the broad array of
regulatory T cells that is critical for moderating normal
immune responses and quelling autoimmune reactions.
The hygiene hypothesis has been advanced to explain
increases in the incidence of all allergic responses (e.g., food
allergies) as well as increases in the frequency of people suffering from autoimmune diseases (Chapter 16). Studies testing various predictions of the hypothesis are ongoing, and it
continues to be modified in its particulars. Understanding
the cellular and molecular players that contribute to allergy
is clearly important in evaluating the data from these studies.

Antibody-Mediated (Type II)
Hypersensitivity Reactions
Type II hypersensitivity reactions involve antibody-mediated
destruction of cells by immunoglobulins of heavy chain
classes other than IgE. Antibody bound to a cell-surface antigen can induce death of the antibody-bound cell by three
distinct mechanisms (see Chapters 6 and 13). First, certain
immunoglobulin subclasses can activate the complement
system, creating pores in the membrane of a foreign cell.
Secondly, antibodies can mediate cell destruction by antibodydependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC), in which
cytotoxic cells bearing Fc receptors bind to the Fc region of
antibodies on target cells and promote killing of the cells.
Finally, antibody bound to a foreign cell also can serve as an
opsonin, enabling phagocytic cells with Fc or C3b receptors
to bind and phagocytose the antibody-coated cell.
In this section, we examine three examples of type II
hypersensitivity reactions. Certain autoimmune diseases
involve autoantibody-mediated cellular destruction by type
II mechanisms and will be described in Chapter 16.

Transfusion Reactions Are an Example
of Type II Hypersensitivity
Several proteins and glycoproteins on the membrane of red
blood cells are encoded by genes with several allelic forms.
An individual with a particular allele of a blood-group
antigen can recognize other allelic forms in transfused
blood as foreign, and mount an antibody response. Blood
types are referred to as A, B, or O, and the antigens that are
associated with the blood types are identified as A, B, and
H, respectively.
Interestingly, the blood type antigens (ABH) are carbohydrates, rather than proteins. This was demonstrated by simple experiments in which the addition of high concentrations
of particular simple sugars was shown to inhibit antibody
binding to red blood cells bearing particular types of red

(antigens), and isohemagglutinins (antibodies that react to nonhost antigens).

blood cell antigens. These inhibition reactions revealed that
antibodies directed to group A antigens predominantly
bound to N-acetyl glucosamine residues, those to group B
antigens bound to galactose residues, and those directed
toward the so-called H antigens bound to fucose residues
(Figure 15-10a). Note that the H antigen is present in all
blood types.
The A, B, and H antigens are synthesized by a series of
enzymatic reactions catalyzed by glycosyltransferases. The
final step of the biosynthesis of the A and B antigens is catalyzed by A and B transferases, encoded by alleles A and B at
the ABO genetic locus. Although initially detected on the
surface of red blood cells, antigens of the ABO blood type
system also occur on the surface of other cells as well as in
bodily secretions.
Antibodies directed toward ABH antigens are termed
isohemagglutinins. Figure 15-10b shows the pattern of blood
cell antigens and expressed isohemagglutinins normally
found within the human population. Most adults possess
IgM antibodies to those members of the ABH family they do
not express. This is because common microorganisms
express carbohydrate antigens very similar in structure to
the carbohydrates of the ABH system and induce a B-cell
response. B cells generating antibodies specific for the ABH
antigens expressed by the host, however, undergo negative
selection.
For example, an individual with blood type A recognizes
B-like epitopes on microorganisms and produces isohem-

agglutinins to the B-like epitopes. This same individual does
not respond to A-like epitopes on the same microorganisms
because they have been tolerized to self-A epitopes. If a type
A individual is transfused with blood containing type B
cells, a transfusion reaction occurs in which the preexisting
anti-B isohemagglutinins bind to the B blood cells and
mediate their destruction by means of complement-mediated
lysis. Individuals with blood type O express only the H
antigen. Although they can donate blood to anyone, they
have antibodies that will react to both A-type or B-type
blood. Their anti-A- and anti-B-producing B cells were
never exposed to A or B antigens and therefore were never
deleted.
The clinical manifestations of transfusion reactions result
from massive intravascular hemolysis of the transfused red
blood cells by antibody plus complement. These manifestations may be either immediate or delayed. Reactions that
begin immediately are most commonly associated with ABO
blood-group incompatibilities, which lead to complementmediated lysis triggered by the IgM isohemagglutinins.
Within hours, free hemoglobin can be detected in the
plasma; it is filtered through the kidneys, resulting in hemoglobinuria. As the hemoglobin is degraded, the porphyrin
component is metabolized to bilirubin, which at high levels
is toxic to the organism. Typical symptoms of bilirubinemia
include fever, chills, nausea, clotting within blood vessels,
pain in the lower back, and hemoglobin in the urine. Treatment involves prompt termination of the transfusion and

maintenance of urine flow with a diuretic, because the accumulation of hemoglobin in the kidney can cause acute tubular necrosis.
Antibodies to other blood-group antigens such as Rh factor (see below) may result from repeated blood transfusions
because minor allelic differences in these antigens can stimulate antibody production. These antibodies are usually of
the IgG class. These incompatibilities typically result in
delayed hemolytic transfusion reactions that develop
between 2 and 6 days after transfusion. Because IgG is less
effective than IgM in activating complement, complementmediated lysis of the transfused red blood cells is incomplete. Free hemoglobin is usually not detected in the plasma
or urine in these reactions. Rather, many of the transfused
cells are destroyed at extravascular sites by agglutination,
opsonization, and subsequent phagocytosis by macrophages.
Symptoms include fever, increased bilirubin, mild jaundice,
and anemia.

Hemolytic Disease of the Newborn Is Caused
by Type II Reactions
Hemolytic disease of the newborn develops when maternal
IgG antibodies specific for fetal blood-group antigens cross
the placenta and destroy fetal red blood cells. The consequences of such transfer can be minor, serious, or lethal.
Severe hemolytic disease of the newborn, called erythroblastosis fetalis, most commonly develops when the mother and
fetus express different alleles of the Rhesus (Rh) antigen.
Although there are actually five alleles of the Rh antigen,
expression of the D allele elicits the strongest immune
response. We therefore designate individuals bearing the D
allele of the Rh antigen as Rh⫹.
An Rh⫺ mother fertilized by an Rh⫹ father is in danger of
developing a response to the Rh antigen and rejecting an
Rh⫹ fetus. During pregnancy, fetal red blood cells are separated from the mother’s circulation by a layer of cells in the
placenta called the trophoblast. During her first pregnancy
with an Rh⫹ fetus, an Rh⫺ woman is usually not exposed to
enough fetal red blood cells to activate her Rh-specific B
cells. However, at the time of delivery, separation of the placenta from the uterine wall allows larger amounts of fetal
umbilical cord blood to enter the mother’s circulation. These
fetal red blood cells stimulate Rh-specific B cells to mount an
immune response, resulting in the production of Rh-specific
plasma cells and memory B cells in the mother. The secreted
IgM antibody clears the Rh⫹ fetal red cells from the mother’s
circulation, but memory cells remain, a threat to any subsequent pregnancy with an Rh⫹ fetus. Importantly, since IgM
antibodies do not pass through the placenta, IgM anti-Rh
antigens are no threat to the fetus.
Activation of IgG-secreting memory cells in a subsequent pregnancy results in the formation of IgG anti-Rh
antibodies, which, however, can cross the placenta and
damage the fetal red blood cells (Figure 15-11). Mild to
severe anemia can develop in the fetus, sometimes with fatal

consequences. In addition, conversion of hemoglobin to
bilirubin can present an additional threat to the newborn
because the lipid-soluble bilirubin may accumulate in the
brain and cause brain damage. Because the blood-brain barrier is not complete until after birth, very young babies can
suffer fatal brain damage from bilirubin. Fortunately, bilirubin is rapidly broken down on exposure of the skin to ultraviolet (UV) light, and babies who display the telltale
jaundiced appearance that signifies high levels of blood
bilirubin are treated by exposure to UV light in their cribs
(Figure 15-12).
Hemolytic disease of the newborn caused by Rh incompatibility in a second or later pregnancy can be almost
entirely prevented by administering antibodies against the
Rh antigen to the mother at around 28 weeks of pregnancy
and within 24 to 48 hours after the first delivery. Anti-Rh
antibodies are also administered to pregnant women after
amniocentesis. These antibodies, marketed as Rhogam, bind
to any fetal red blood cells that may have entered the mother’s circulation and facilitate their clearance before B-cell
activation and ensuing memory-cell production can take
place. In a subsequent pregnancy with an Rh⫹ fetus, a
mother who has been treated with Rhogam is unlikely to
produce IgG anti-Rh antibodies; thus, the fetus is protected
from the damage that would occur when these antibodies
cross the placenta.
The development of hemolytic disease of the newborn
caused by Rh incompatibility can be detected by testing
maternal serum at intervals during pregnancy for antibodies to the Rh antigen. A rise in the titer of these antibodies
as pregnancy progresses indicates that the mother has been
exposed to Rh antigens and is producing increasing
amounts of antibody. Treatment depends on the severity of
the reaction. For a severe reaction, the fetus can be given an
intrauterine blood-exchange transfusion to replace fetal
Rh⫹ red blood cells with Rh⫺ cells. These transfusions are
given every 10 to 21 days until delivery. In less severe cases,
a blood-exchange transfusion is not given until after birth,
primarily to remove bilirubin; the infant is also exposed to
low levels of UV light to break down the bilirubin and prevent cerebral damage. The mother can also be treated during the pregnancy by plasmapheresis. In this procedure, a
cell separation machine is used to separate the mother’s
blood into two fractions: cells and plasma. The plasma containing the anti-Rh antibody is discarded, and the cells are
reinfused into the mother in an albumin or fresh plasma
solution.
The majority of cases (65%) of hemolytic disease of the
newborn, however, are caused by ABO blood-group incompatibility between the mother and fetus and are not severe.
Type A or B fetuses carried by type O mothers most commonly develop these reactions. A type O mother can develop
IgG antibodies to the A or B blood-group antigens through
exposure to fetal blood-group A or B antigens in successive
pregnancies. Usually, the fetal anemia resulting from this
incompatibility is mild; the major clinical manifestation is a

cases, transfusion may be required.

Hemolytic Anemia Can Be Drug Induced

FIGURE 15-12 Ultraviolet light is used to treat bilirubinemia of the newborn. [Stephanie Clarke/123RF]

Certain antibiotics (e.g., penicillin, cephalosporins, and
streptomycin), as well as other well-known drugs (including ibuprofen and naproxen), can adsorb nonspecifically to
proteins on red blood cell membranes, forming a drugprotein complex. In some patients, such drug-protein complexes induce formation of antibodies. These antibodies
then bind to the adsorbed drug on red blood cells, inducing complement-mediated lysis and thus progressive anemia. When the drug is withdrawn, the hemolytic anemia
disappears. Penicillin is notable in that it can induce all
four types of hypersensitivity with various clinical manifestations (Table 15-4).

Immune Complex-Mediated
(Type III) Hypersensitivity
The reaction of antibody with antigen generates immune
complexes. Generally, these complexes facilitate the clearance of antigen by phagocytic cells and red blood cells. In
some cases, however, the presence of large numbers and
networks of immune complexes can lead to tissue-damaging
type III hypersensitivity reactions. The magnitude of the
reaction depends on the number and size of immune complexes, their distribution within the body, and the ability of
the phagocyte system to clear the complexes and thus minimize the tissue damage. The deposition of these complexes
initiates a reaction that results in the recruitment of complement components and neutrophils to the site, with resultant
tissue injury.

Immune Complexes Can Damage
Various Tissues
The formation of antigen-antibody complexes occurs as a
normal part of an adaptive immune response. It is usually
followed by Fc receptor-mediated recognition of the complexes by phagocytes, which engulf and destroy them and/or
by complement activation resulting in the lysis of the cells on
which the immune complexes are found. However, under
certain conditions, immune complexes are inefficiently
cleared and may be deposited in the blood vessels or tissues,
setting the stage for a type III hypersensitivity response.
These conditions include (1) the presence of antigens capable of generating particularly extensive antigen-antibody
lattices, (2) a high intrinsic affinity of antigens for particular
tissues, (3) the presence of highly charged antigens (which
can affect immune complex engulfment) and (4) a compromised phagocytic system. All have been associated with the
initiation of a type III response.
Immune complexes bind to mast cells, neutrophils, and
macrophages via Fc receptors, triggering the release of
vasoactive mediators and inflammatory cytokines, which

/Volumes/203/MHR00209/siL52070/disk1of1/0071052070

|

CHAPTER 15

505

interact with the capillary epithelium and increase the permeability of the blood vessel walls. Immune complexes
then move through the capillary walls and into the tissues
where they are deposited and set up a localized inflammatory response. Complement fixation results in the production of the anaphylatoxin chemokines C3a and C5a, which
attract more neutrophils and macrophages. These in turn
are further activated by immune complexes binding to
their Fc receptors to secrete proinflammatory chemokines
and cytokines, prostaglandins, and proteases. Proteases
digest the basement membrane proteins collagen, elastin,
and cartilage. Tissue damage is further mediated by oxygen
free radicals released by the activated neutrophils. In addition, immune complexes interact with platelets and induce
the formation of tiny clots. Complex deposition in the tissues can give rise to symptoms such as fever, urticaria
(rashes), joint pain, lymph node enlargement, and protein
in the urine. The resulting inflammatory lesion is referred to
as vasculitis if it occurs in a blood vessel, glomerulonephritis
if it occurs in the kidney, or arthritis if it occurs in the
joints.

Immune Complex-Mediated Hypersensitivity
Can Resolve Spontaneously
If immune complex-mediated disease is induced by a single
large bolus of antigen that is then gradually cleared, it can
resolve spontaneously. Spontaneous recovery is seen, for
example, when glomerulonephritis is initiated following a
streptococcal infection. Streptococcal antigen-antibody
complexes bind to the basement membrane of the kidney
and set up a type III response, which resolves as the bacterial load is eliminated. Similarly, patients being treated by
injections of passive antibody can develop immune
responses to the foreign antibody and generate large
immune complexes. This was seen initially during the use
of horse antibodies in the treatment of diphtheria in the
early 1900s. On repeated injections with the horse antibodies, patients developed a syndrome known as serum sickness, which resolved as soon as the antibodies were
withdrawn. Serum sickness is an example of a systemic
form of immune complex disease, which resulted in arthritis, skin rash, and fever.
A more modern manifestation of the same problem
occurs in patients who receive therapeutic mouse-derived
monoclonal antibodies designed to treat previously intractable cancers. After several such treatments, some patients
generate their own antibodies against the foreign monoclonals and develop serum sickness–like symptoms. We know
now that the injection of the mouse antibodies caused a
generalized type III reaction, and in many cases the therapeutic antibodies were actually cleared before they could
reach their pathogenic target. To avoid this response, current
therapeutic antibodies are genetically engineered to remove
most of the foreign epitopes (they are humanized).

Autoantigens Can be Involved in Immune
Complex-Mediated Reactions
If the antigen in the immune complex is an autoantigen, it
cannot be eliminated and type III hypersensitivity reactions
cannot be easily resolved. In such situations, chronic type III
responses develop. For example, in systemic lupus erythematosus, persistent antibody responses to autoantigens are
an identifying feature of the disease, and complexes are
deposited in the joints, kidneys, and skin of patients. Examples of diseases resulting from type III hypersensitivity reactions are found in Table 15-5.

Arthus Reactions Are Localized Type III
Hypersensitivity Reactions
One example of a localized type III hypersensitivity reaction
has been used extensively as an experimental tool. If an animal or human subject is injected intradermally with an
antigen to which large amounts of circulating antibodies
exist (or have been recently introduced by intravenous injections), antigen will diffuse into the walls of local blood vessels and large immune complexes will precipitate close to the
injection site. This initiates an inflammatory reaction that
peaks approximately 4 to 10 hours post injection and is
known as an Arthus reaction. Inflammation at the site of an
Arthus reaction is characterized by swelling and localized
bleeding, followed by fibrin deposition (Figure 15-13).
A sensitive individual may react to an insect bite with a
rapid, localized type I reaction, which can be followed, some
4 to 10 hours later, by the development of a typical Arthus
reaction, characterized by pronounced erythema and edema.
Intrapulmonary Arthus-type reactions induced by bacterial

FIGURE 15-13 An Arthus reaction. This photograph shows an
Arthus reaction on a thigh of a 72-year-old woman. This occurred at
the site of injection of a chemotherapeutic drug, 3 to 4 hours after
the patient received a second injection (15 days after the first). This
response was accompanied by fever and significant discomfort. [From
P. Boura et al., 2006, Eosinophilic cellulitis (Wells’ syndrome) as a cutaneous
reaction to the administration of adalimumab, Annals of the Rheumatic
Diseases 65:839–840. doi:10.1136/ard.2005.044685.]

spores, fungi, or dried fecal proteins can also cause pneumonitis or alveolitis. These reactions are known by a variety of
common names reflecting the source of the antigen. For
example, farmer’s lung develops after inhalation of actinomycetes from moldy hay, and pigeon fancier’s disease results
from inhalation of a serum protein in dust derived from
dried pigeon feces.

Delayed-Type (Type IV)
Hypersensitivity (DTH)
Type lV hypersensitivity, commonly referred to as DelayedType Hypersensitivity (DTH), is the only hypersensitivity
category that is purely cell mediated rather than antibody
mediated. In 1890, Robert Koch observed that individuals
infected with Mycobacterium tuberculosis developed a localized inflammatory response when injected intradermally (in
the skin) with a filtrate derived from a mycobacterial culture.
He therefore named this localized skin reaction a tuberculin
reaction. Later, as it became apparent that a variety of other
antigens could induce this cellular response (Table 15-6), its
name was changed to delayed-type, or type IV, hypersensitivity. The hallmarks of a type IV reaction are its initiation by
T cells (as distinct from antibodies), the delay required for

the reaction to develop, and the recruitment of macrophages
(as opposed to neutrophils or eosinophils) as the primary
cellular component of the infiltrate that surrounds the site of
inflammation.
The most common type IV hypersensitivity is the contact
dermatitis that occurs after exposure to Toxicodendron species, which include poison ivy, poison oak, and poison
sumac. This is a significant public health problem. Approximately 50% to 70% of the U.S. adult population is clinically
sensitive to exposure to Toxicodendron; only 10% to 15% of
the population is tolerant. Some responses can be severe and
require hospitalization.

The Initiation of a Type IV DTH Response
Involves Sensitization by Antigen
A DTH response begins with an initial sensitization by antigen, followed by a period of at least 1 to 2 weeks during
which antigen-specific T cells are activated and clonally
expanded (Figure 15-14a). A variety of antigen-presenting
cells (APCs) are involved in the induction of a DTH
response, including Langerhans cells (dendritic cells found
in the epidermis) and macrophages. These cells pick up antigen that enters through the skin and transport it to regional
lymph nodes, where T cells are activated. In some species,
including humans, the vascular endothelial cells express
class II MHC molecules and can also function as APCs in
the development of the DTH response. Generally, the T cells
activated during the sensitization phase of a traditional DTH
response are CD4⫹, primarily of the TH1 subtypes. However,
recent studies indicate that TH17, TH2, and CD8⫹ cells can
also play a role.

Cytokines secreted by these T cells are indicated by the black balls.
(b) In the effector phase after subsequent exposure of sensitized TH
cells to antigen, TH1 cells secrete a variety of cytokines and chemokines. These factors attract and activate macrophages and other nonspecific inflammatory cells. Activated macrophages are more effective in presenting antigen, thus perpetuating the DTH response, and
function as the primary effector cells in this reaction. Other helper
T-cell subsets are now thought to participate in DTH (TH2 and TH17)
and CD8⫹ T cells also contribute.

The Effector Phase of a Classical DTH
Response Is Induced by Second Exposure
to a Sensitizing Antigen
A second exposure to the sensitizing antigen induces the
effector phase of the DTH response (see Figure 15-14b). In

The Immune System in Health and Disease

the effector phase, T cells are stimulated to secrete a variety
of cytokines, including interferon-␥ (IFN-␥) and Lymphotoxin-␣ (TNF-␤), which recruit and activate macrophages
and other inflammatory cells. A DTH response normally
does not become apparent until an average of 24 hours after
the second contact with the antigen and generally peaks 48
to 72 hours after this stimulus. The delayed onset of this
response reflects the time required for the cytokines to
induce localized influxes of macrophages and their activation. Once a DTH response begins, a complex interplay of
nonspecific cells and mediators is set in motion that can
result in extensive amplification of the response. By the time
the DTH response is fully developed, only about 5% of the
participating cells are antigen-specific TH1 cells; the remainder are macrophages and other innate immune cells.
TH1 cells are important initiators of DTH, but the principal
effector cells of the DTH response are activated macrophages.
Cytokines elaborated by helper T cells, including IFN-␥ and
Lymphotoxin-␣, induce blood monocytes to adhere to vascular endothelial cells, migrate from the blood into the surrounding tissues, and differentiate into activated macrophages.
As described in Chapter 2, activated macrophages exhibit
enhanced phagocytosis and an increased ability to kill microorganisms. They produce cytokines, including TNF-␣ and
IL-1␤, that recruit more monocytes and neutrophils, and
enhance the activity of TH1 cells, amplifying the response.
The heightened phagocytic activity and the buildup of
lytic enzymes from macrophages in the area of infection lead
to nonspecific destruction of cells and thus of any intracellular pathogens, such as Mycobacteria. Usually, any presented
pathogens are cleared rapidly with little tissue damage. However, in some cases, and especially if the antigen is not easily
cleared, a prolonged DTH response can develop, which
becomes destructive to the host, causing a visible granulomatous reaction. Granulomas develop when continuous activation of macrophages induces them to adhere closely to one
another. Under these conditions, macrophages assume an
epithelioid shape and sometimes fuse to form multinucleated
giant cells (Figure 15-15a). These giant cells displace the normal tissue cells, forming palpable nodules, and releasing high
concentrations of lytic enzymes, which destroy surrounding
tissue. The granulomatous response can damage blood vessels and lead to extensive tissue necrosis.
The response to Mycobacterium tuberculosis illustrates the
double-edged nature of the DTH response. Immunity to this
intracellular bacterium involves a DTH response in which
activated macrophages wall off the organism in the lung and
contain it within a granuloma-type lesion called a tubercle
(see Figure 15-15b). Often, however, the release of concentrated lytic enzymes from the activated macrophages within
the tubercles damages the very lung tissue that the immune
response aims to preserve.

observing whether a characteristic skin lesion develops days
later at the injection site. A positive skin-test reaction indicates that the individual has a population of sensitized TH1
cells specific for the test antigen. For example, to determine
whether an individual has been exposed to M. tuberculosis,
PPD, a protein derived from the cell wall of this mycobacterium, is injected intradermally. Development of a red, slightly
swollen, firm lesion at the site between 48 and 72 hours later
indicates previous exposure. Note, however, that a positive
test does not allow one to conclude whether the exposure was
due to a pathogenic form of M. tuberculosis or to a vaccine
antigen, which is used in some parts of the world.

occurs when a reactive chemical compound binds to skin proteins and these modified proteins are presented to T cells in the
context of the appropriate MHC antigens. The reactive chemical may be a pharmaceutical, a component of a cosmetic or a
hair dye, an industrial chemical such as formaldehyde or turpentine, an artificial hapten such as fluoro-dinitrobenzene, a
metal ion such as nickel, or the active allergen from poison ivy.
Sometimes, however, the antigen is presented to T cells
via a less familiar route. Some chemicals are first metabolized by the body to form a reactive metabolite, which, in
turn, binds to proteins presented by the MHC. Some investigators propose that other molecules have the capacity to
bind directly to the T-cell receptor and directly stimulate an
effector or memory T cell. These ideas are new and still being
evaluated. What seems clear, however, is that many small
molecules and drugs can attach to cell-surface proteins of T
cells as well as of APCs and give rise to the hypersensitivity
reactions characteristic of contact dermatitis.
The classical DTH response to Mycobacterium antigens
described above is mediated by CD4⫹, TH1 T cells. However,
we now know that T-cell hypersensitivity reactions directed
toward other antigens are mediated by a variety of T-cell
subtypes and cytokines. The severe dermatitis associated
with some type IV hypersensitivities to drugs, for example,
is caused by CD8⫹ T cells and NK cells. These cytotoxic cells
induce death of keratinocytes and sloughing of the skin or
mucus membrane. Diseases in which this mechanism is
active include erythema multiforme, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, and toxic epidermal necrolysis; they can be fatal. The

allergen in these cases can be associated with drugs as common as the nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medication ibuprofen. The incidence of such complications is higher in
males than in females and usually occurs in young adults.
At present the best way to avoid a DTH response it to
avoid the causative antigen. Once hypersensitivity has developed, topical or oral corticosteroids can be used to suppress
the destructive immune response.

Chronic Inflammation
Regardless of whether an immune response is activated appropriately or inappropriately, a full-blown immune response
makes one feel ill, largely because of the activity of inflammatory mediators released by innate immune cells. In most cases,
the misery subsides when the insult (antigen, allergen, or
toxin) is removed. However, in some circumstances, an inflammatory stimulus persists, generating a chronic inflammatory
response that has systemic effects, which have been associated
most directly with Type 2 diabetes. Recent studies also raise a
possibility that chronic inflammation exacerbates heart disease, kidney disease, Alzheimer’s, and cancer (Figure 15-16).

Infections Can Cause Chronic Inflammation
Chronic inflammatory conditions have a variety of causes,
some of which are still being identified (Figure 15-16).
Some are the result of infections that persist because

causes, including obesity. Chronic inflammatory conditions, regardless of cause, have common systemic consequences, some of which

(Type 2 diabetes) and some of which are related to the effects of
inflammatory mediators on tissue organization and cell proliferation
(e.g., cancer). Other disorders have also been associated with chronic
inflammation although the mechanisms behind the association may
be indirect and are still being studied.

The Immune System in Health and Disease

pathogen has continual access to the body. For instance,
gum disease and unhealed wounds make a body vulnerable
to continual microbe invasion and immune stimulation.
Gut pathogens can also contribute. Although our commensal bacteria play an important role in dampening our reaction to microbes that we ingest, this protective mechanism
can fail, and gut microbes can contribute to a chronic
inflammatory state.
Some chronic inflammatory conditions are caused by
pathogens that evade the immune system and remain active
in the body, inspiring continual low-level inflammatory
reactions. Fungi and mycobacteria are two examples of
pathogens that are not always successfully cleared and have
the ability to continually stimulate immune cells that release
inflammatory molecules and cytokines.

They appear to have the capacity to bind toll-like receptors
on adipocytes, initiating a signaling cascade analogous to
that experienced by innate immune cells that recognize
pathogen.
Obesity is now recognized as a major, if not the major,
cause of chronic inflammation, which, as you will see
below, has severe consequences. Interestingly, approximately 6% of individuals who are considered obese by
weight do not generate inflammatory cytokines and show
few signs of metabolic dysfunction. The basis for the ability
of these individuals to tolerate excess fat is an area of active
investigation.

There Are Noninfectious Causes
of Chronic Inflammation

The specific consequences of chronic inflammation vary
with the tissue of origin as well as the sex, age, and health
status of the individual. However, given that those who suffer from chronic inflammation all exhibit increased circulation of inflammatory mediators, including the classical
proinflammatory cytokine trio (IL-1, IL-6, and TNF-␣), it is
not surprising that many suffer similar systemic disorders
(Figure 15-16).

Interestingly, pathogens are not the only causes of chronic
inflammation. Physical damage to tissue also releases molecules (damage-associated molecular patterns, or DAMPs)
that induce the secretion of inflammatory cytokines. If tissue
damage is not resolved because of continual mechanical
interference, for instance, the inflammatory stimulus persists. Tumors, autoimmune disorders, atherosclerosis, and
heart disease, each of which results in tissue damage that
stimulates immune responses, are other examples of disorders that can cause chronic inflammation. The biomedical
community was startled, however, to discover that one of the
most common noninfectious causes of chronic inflammation today is obesity, a condition that did not, at first, suggest
a relationship to inflammation.

Obesity Is Associated with Chronic
Inflammation
Obesity has long been associated with a constellation of
metabolic and systemic disorders, including Type 2 diabetes.
The biological mechanisms responsible for these associations are still being investigated. However, recent work suggests that many of the systemic effects of obesity are
mediated by inflammation.
What does fat have to do with inflammation? It turns out
that the immune system is not the only source of inflammatory cytokines. Visceral adipocytes, fat cells that surround
organs (as opposed to subcutaneous adipocytes, which are
located under the skin), are very active, responsive cells. Not
only do they generate hormones such as leptin that regulate
metabolism, but they also secrete a variety of proinflammatory mediators, including TNF-␣ and IL-6.
What triggers this release? Some studies suggest that
intracellular stress responses associated with excessive
lipid buildup induce signals that enhance production of
cytokines and inflammatory mediators. Free fatty acids, a
common consequence of obesity, may also play a role.

Chronic Inflammation Can
Cause Systemic Disease

Chronic Inflammation and Insulin Resistance
Type 2 diabetes is one of the most common consequences of
chronic inflammation. Diabetes results from a failure in insulin signaling, a failure that leads to general metabolic dysfunction. Type 1 diabetes (Chapter 16) is caused by the
autoimmune-mediated destruction of pancreatic islet cells
that make insulin. Type 2 diabetes, however, is caused by a
failure of cells to respond to insulin, a state known as insulin
resistance. What does inflammation have to do with insulin
resistance?
Inflammatory cytokines, particularly TNF-␣ and IL-6,
induce signaling cascades that inhibit the ability of the insulin receptor to function. This interference is in large part due
to the cytokines’ ability to activate JNK, a MAPK that is often
associated with stress and inflammatory responses. JNK can
phosphorylate and inactivate IRS-1, a key downstream
mediator of insulin receptor signaling.
This observation also helps explain the long-recognized
association between obesity and Type 2 diabetes (metabolic
syndrome). Inflammatory cytokines released by visceral adipocytes in response to excess lipid induce signals that inhibit
insulin signaling, leading to insulin resistance, a primary
cause of Type 2 diabetes. This perspective is directly supported by studies in mouse models where obesity was
uncoupled from inflammation. Wild-type mice fed a highfat diet became obese and developed Type 2 diabetes. Mice
that lack JNK also became obese on the same diet, but did
not develop diabetes. (See Clinical Focus Box 15-3 for a
more complete discussion of the association between obesity, inflammation, and diabetes.)

CLINICAL FOCUS

Type 2 Diabetes, Obesity, and Inflammation
As late as the 1960s, scientists
and physicians searching for information
on Type 2 diabetes, obesity, or inflammation would have looked in separate chapters of physiology or pathology books.
Obesity was viewed as a problem of poor
nutritional management or resources,
psychology, or (in the case of rare hormonal disorders) endocrinology. Type 2
diabetes was known to be a result of the
inability to effectively use insulin, resulting
in high blood glucose levels (hyperglycemia) and was, therefore, seen solely as the
province of endocrinologists. Inflammation had been understood for close to a
thousand years to be a result of immune
system activity. However, research conducted over the past few decades has
resulted in a dramatic shift in our thinking
regarding the centrality of inflammatory
responses in many human pathologies,
including Type 2 diabetes. Furthermore,
knowledge about how inflammatory
mediators work and the cells from which
they are released has helped us to understand the linkages between obesity and
Type 2 diabetes. Here we will explore the
intersecting biological pathways that connect obesity, inflammation and Type 2
diabetes.
Obesity and Type 2 diabetes currently
represent a public health problem of
stunning proportions in the United States.
As of summer 2011, 33.8% of adults in the
United States are obese (defined as having a body mass index [BMI] of 30 or
above), and childhood obesity rates are
rising rapidly, with 17% of children and
adolescents aged from 2 to 19 years falling into this category. Nor is the problem
restricted to the United States. The World
Health Organization reports that 300 million adults are obese and as many as 1
billion are reported to be overweight
worldwide. But why should this be a problem, and what does it have to do with
immunology?
In Type 1 diabetes, the insulin-producing
␤ cells of the islets of Langerhans are

subject to autoimmune attack and are
destroyed. However, in Type 2 diabetes,
patients experience a state of insulin resistance, in which the body still makes insulin, but the responses to it are dulled and
the amount of insulin in the circulation is
unable to do its job of driving dietary
sugar out of the bloodstream and into the
waiting cells.
The first indication that Type 2 diabetes may result from, or at least be exacerbated by, inflammatory signals came
almost a hundred years ago, when it was
discovered that patients receiving salicylate (aspirin) for inflammatory conditions
showed an increase in insulin sensitivity.
Studies published in the early years of the
twenty-first century further demonstrated
that patients suffering from a variety of
infectious diseases, including hepatitis C
and HIV, as well as those with autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis, displayed insulin resistance. These
diseases share the common feature of
inducing an active inflammatory response.
In each case, the insulin resistance was
improved upon treatment with antiinflammatory drugs.
What do we know about the mechanism by which inflammation results in
insulin resistance? Insulin signals a cell to
import glucose by binding to a cell surface receptor that is a member of the
receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) family.
When insulin binds to the receptor on the
external surface of the cell, a signal is
transmitted to the intracellular part of the
receptor, activating the intrinsic tyrosine
kinase activity of the receptor (see Chapter 3). The two halves of the insulin-bound
dimeric receptor phosphorylate one
another on tyrosine residues, and these
residues then act as docking sites for
other proteins in the signaling cascade. A
set of six proteins termed the Insulin
Receptor Substrate (IRS) proteins are
among the early, pivotally important substrates of the insulin receptor, and they
bind to it through their phosphotyrosine

binding domains. The IRS proteins are
then phosphorylated by the RTKs and
subsequently act as adapter molecules for
transmitting the insulin signal to downstream molecules such as the kinases PI3
kinase and Fyn, and the docking proteins
Grb2 and SHP2. However, if the IRS proteins are phosphorylated on serine residues by IRS serine/threonine kinases,
their signaling capacity is inhibited (see
Figure 1).
Inflammatory cytokines, such as IL-6,
IL-1␤ and TNF-␣, bind to cell-surface
receptors and signal the activation of
kinases, including JNK, which phosphorylate IRS-1 on serine residues, inhibiting its
activity. Thus, inflammatory cytokines act
to inhibit the insulin signal, leading to
insulin resistance. However, what is the
source of the excess inflammatory cytokines released in individuals with Type 2
diabetes?
Patients with Type 2 diabetes are frequently (although not always) obese, and
so investigators began to explore the
relationships between obesity and the
generation of inflammatory cytokines.
Mice fed high-fat diets, or those with a
genetic predisposition to obesity, were
found to develop chronically elevated
levels of inflammatory mediators, such as
TNF-␣, IL-1␤, and IL-6, and increased local
concentrations of chemokines, such as
CCL2, which draw immune cells, particularly macrophages, into adipose tissue.
Investigators therefore advanced the
hypothesis that the nutrients themselves
might be activating signaling pathways
leading to the release of these mediators.
But with what receptors are the nutrients
interacting?
One clue has come from genetically
modified mice. Animals in which the gene
encoding the TLR4 receptor has been
eliminated are protected from the insulin
resistance engendered by eating a highfat diet. This suggests that the Toll receptors may be recognizing the excess
nutrients and initiating the inflammatory

FIGURE 1
Signaling events that link obesity to insulin resistance. Several factors trigger signaling
cascades that interfere with insulin receptor (IR) signaling cascades. Inflammatory cytokines, including
TNF-␣ and IL-6, are produced by adipocytes themselves, as well as immune cells. These trigger signaling
events in multiple cells that activate kinases, including JNK, which inactivate IRS by phosphorylating it
at a serine residue. Thus, insulin signaling is impaired. JNK can also be activated (and insulin signaling
inactivated) by the interaction between toll like receptors and free fatty acids, which are increased in
obesity. [Based on Gray, S., and J. K. Kim. (2011, October). New insights into insulin resistance in the diabetic
heart. Trends in Endocrinology and Metabolism 22(10):394–403.]

response. Indeed, TLR4 and TLR2 have both
been shown to be responsive to high levels of free fatty acids. A second observation which implicates the TLR4 receptor in
the sensing of a nutrient-rich environment
is that serum lipopolysaccharide (LPS) in
mice is increased after feeding. Perhaps

intestinal permeability is increased immediately after feeding, which allows the
introduction of inflammatory molecules
such as LPS directly into the circulation. In
an animal fed a normal diet, this inflammation is short-lived. However, it is possible
that in animals living in the nutrient-rich

Chronic Inflammation and Susceptibility
to Other Diseases
As part of the normal healing process, inflammatory cytokines also enhance blood vessel flow and blood vessel formation (angiogenesis), induce proliferation and activation
of fibroblasts and immune cells, and regulate death of
infected or damaged cells. Together, these events induce
tissue remodeling that gives immune cells better access to
pathogens and scarring that heals wounds. However, continual stimulation of this healing process has deleterious
consequences. Overstimulation of fibroblasts leads to
excessive tissue scarring (fibrosis), which can physically
and severely impair organ function. Continual stimulation
of cell proliferation enhances the probability of mutations

environment characteristic of obesity,
intestinal permeability remains relatively
high long after a meal is completed and
thus the animal is chronically exposed to
low levels of inflammatory signals.
If Toll receptors are signaling the
release of inflammatory cytokines, what is
the nature of the cell that carries these
Toll receptors? A significant number of
studies have demonstrated the presence
of macrophages and mast cells in adipose (fat) tissue, suggesting that these
two cell types are at least in part responsible for the detection of excess nutrients
and the development of inflammatory
signals in adipose tissues. The roles of
macrophages and mast cells in the development of obesity-associated inflammation are supported by the finding that
depletion of cells bearing the CD11c
marker (macrophages, dendritic cells, and
neutrophils) increases insulin sensitivity.
In addition, it is possible that macrophages, newly recruited into expanding
adipose tissue, may differentiate into a
more potent proinflammatory phenotype than macrophages normally resident in lean adipose tissue. Improved
insulin sensitivity in adipose tissue was
also found upon depletion of mast cells,
NKT cells, and CD8⫹ T cells, whereas
increased levels of CD4⫹ and TREG cells are
associated with higher levels of insulin
sensitivity. TREG cells associated with adipose tissue secrete large amounts of

and may contribute to tumor formation or growth.
Enhancement of blood vessel formation can also enhance
survival of cells in solid tumors.
Although focusing on similarities between acute and
chronic inflammation is helpful in understanding some of
the consequences described, it is also important not to oversimplify the relationship. For instance, although neutrophil
infiltration is a cardinal feature of acute inflammation, monocytes, macrophages, and lymphocytes accumulate during
chronic inflammation. Fibroblasts associated with chronic
inflammation secrete distinct cytokines and may represent
distinct lineages. These differences and others underscore the
importance of thoughtfully considering and customizing
approaches to ameliorate inflammatory conditions.

IL-10, which acts, in part, to reduce the
inflammatory response. Finally, recent
work shows that some adipocytes (fat
cells) themselves are capable of generating inflammatory cytokines, including
TNF-␣ and IL-6. Adipocytes also express
Toll-like receptors that trigger cytokine
release. Excess internal lipid also appears
to stimulate internal stress responses by
adipocytes that enhance cytokine production. So it appears that macrophages,
mast cells, NKT cells, CD8 T cells, and adipocytes all play a part in the release of
proinflammatory mediators in adipose
tissues.
Another stimulus for the secretion of
proinflammatory cytokines from adipose
tissue-associated cells may be hypoxia,
which develops in rapidly expanding adipose tissue. If an animal fed a high-fat diet
puts on weight fairly rapidly, the newly
developing vasculature (blood supply) is
not always able to keep pace and the tissue may be temporarily starved of oxygen. This is known as a state of ischemia,
and ischemic tissues recruit macrophages.
Once present in ischemic tissues, macrophages are induced to express proinflammatory proteins, as well as angiogenic
proteins, which aid in signaling the development of an increased blood supply.
Adipocytes may also contribute to this
response directly.
Once an animal starts down the road
to obesity, its problems can become self-

perpetuating. Adipocytes that are full of
fat will tend to leak free fatty acids into the
circulation, and these in turn induce further inflammation. Indeed, free fatty acids
and cellular stress have also been shown
to be additional triggers for IRS protein
kinases. In addition, high levels of proinflammatory cytokines block the formation
of new adipocytes and reduce the secretion of adiponectin, an important regulator of adipocyte production. As the obese
adipocyte expands, it approaches its
mechanical limit. Cellular responses to
mechanical stress, or death, lead to the
release of cytokines and additional fatty
acids into the circulation. Furthermore,
the swollen adipocyte also undergoes
endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, in
which an unusually high number of
unfolded proteins accumulates in the ER.
This, in turn, provokes the release of
inflammatory cytokines and chemokines.
However, the problems of the Type 2
diabetic are not confined just to the adipocytes. In the liver, normally the site of
glucose homeostasis, increased levels of
inflammatory cytokines also help to
induce insulin resistance. Gluconeogenesis (the formation of new glucose) is normally inhibited by insulin, but under
inflammatory conditions gluconeogenesis is no longer suppressed and the high
blood glucose levels characteristic of the
Type 2 diabetic are further increased. In
the pancreas, the site of insulin produc-

tion, the high blood glucose levels initially induce hyperproliferation of the
pancreatic ␤ cells, but eventually apoptosis of the insulin-producing cells occurs,
further exacerbating the state of high
blood glucose. In the brain of animals fed
a high-fat diet, inflammatory pathways
are also activated in the hypothalamus,
leading to resistance to the effects of
both insulin and leptin, a hormone that
normally signals satiety, thus setting up a
positive feedback loop: the fatter the animal, the more it needs to eat to achieve
satiety.
In summary, current research suggests
that obese animals exhibit a state of chronic
inflammation resulting from the release of
nutrient-stimulated inflammatory mediators by adipocytes, themselves, as well as
macrophages and mast cells. These inflammatory mediators in turn act on adipocytes
and other cells to reduce their sensitivity to
insulin, leading to the syndrome we now
know as Type 2 diabetes. Inflammation
stimulated by nutrient excess is chronic and
is associated with a reduced metabolic rate.
Some have suggested that it be distinguished from the acute inflammatory state
set up by infectious stimuli by using the
term metaflammation. Clinical research
has already demonstrated some success
in using anti-inflammatory medications
such as salicylate homologs and IL-1 receptor antagonists in the treatment of insulin
resistance.

Hypersensitivities are immune disorders caused by an
inappropriate response to antigens that are not pathogens.

■

■

Hypersensitivities are classically divided into four categories (types I–IV) that differ by the immune molecules and cells that cause them and the way they induce
damage.

■

■

The hygiene hypothesis has been advanced to explain
increases in asthma and allergy incidence in the developed
world and proposes that early exposure to pathogens
inhibits allergy by balancing the representation and polarization of regulatory and helper T cell subsets.

■

■

Allergy is a type I hypersensitivity reaction that is mediated by IgE antibodies.
IgE antibodies bind to antigen via their variable regions
and to one of two types of Fc receptors via their constant
regions.
Mast cells, basophils, and to a lesser extent eosinophils
express Fc␧RI, and are the main mediators of allergy
symptoms.
Cross-linking of Fc␧RI receptors by allergen/IgE complexes initiates multiple signaling cascades that resemble
those initiated by antigen receptors.

The Immune System in Health and Disease

Mast cells, basophils, and eosinophils that are stimulated
by Fc␧ cross-linking release their granular contents
(including histamine, proteases) in a process called
degranulation. They also generate and secrete inflammatory cytokines and lipid inflammatory molecules (leukotrienes and prostaglandins).
Degranulation releases both nonprotein (histamine) and
protein (protease) molecules that induce rapid inflammatory responses (e.g., vasodilation and edema, smooth
muscle constriction).
Mast cell activity can also be down-regulated by inhibitory
signals, including phosphatase activity, inhibitory FcR
signaling, and ubiquitinylation and degradation of signaling molecules.
Allergy symptoms vary depending on where the IgE
response occurs and whether it is local or systemic.
Asthma, atopic dermatitis, and food allergies are examples
of local allergic responses. Anaphylaxis refers to a systemic
IgE response and can be caused by systemic (e.g., intravenous) introduction of the same allergen that induces local
responses.
Individuals predisposed to allergic responses are referred
to as atopic. Both genetic and environmental factors contribute to allergy susceptibility.
Why some antigens induce allergy and others do not is
still not fully understood. Some antigens that cause allergy
appear to have intrinsic protease activity.
Skin tests are an effective way to diagnose allergies.
Allergies can be treated by hyposensitization, which
increases IgG responses to allergens, in turn inhibiting IgE
activity. They are also treated with pharmacological inhibitors of inflammation, including antihistamines, leukotriene inhibitors, and corticosteroids.
Type II hypersensitivities are caused by IgG and IgM antibodies binding to an antigen on red blood cells and inducing cell destruction by recruiting complement or by ADCC.
Transfusion reactions are caused by antibodies that bind
to A, B, or H carbohydrate antigens, which are expressed
on the surface of red blood cells. Individuals with different
blood types (A, B, or O) express different carbohydrate
antigens. They are tolerant to their own antigens, but generate antibodies against the antigen (A or B) that they do
not express. All individuals express antigen H, so no antibodies are generated to this carbohydrate.
Hemolytic disease of the newborn is caused by maternal
antibody reaction to the Rh antigen, which can happen if
mother is Rh⫺ and father is Rh⫹.
Drug-induced hemolytic anemia is caused by antibody
responses to red blood cells that have bound drug molecules or metabolites.

■

Immune complexes of antibody and antigen can cause
type III hypersensitivities when they cannot be cleared by
phagocytes. This may be due to peculiarities of the antigen
itself, or disorders in phagocytic machinery.

■

Uncleared immune complexes can induce degranulation
of mast cells and inflammation, and can be deposited in
tissues and capillary beds where they induce more innate
immune activity, blood vessel inflammation (vasculitis),
and tissue damage.

■

Arthus reactions are examples of immune complex (type III)
hypersensitivity reactions and can be induced by insect
bites, as well as inhalation of fungal or animal protein.
They are characterized by local and sometimes severe
inflammation of blood vessels.

■

Delayed-type hypersensitivity (type IV hypersensitivity) is
cell mediated, not antibody mediated. Examples include
contact dermatitis caused by poison ivy, as well as the
tuberculin reaction. DTH responses are responsible for
granulomas associated with tuberculosis.

■

DTH requires T cells to be sensitized to antigen.
Subsequent reexposure to antigen results in cytokine
generation, inflammation, and the recruitment of macrophages, which produce DTH symptoms 2 to 4 days
after reexposure.

■

TH1 cells are classically associated with DTH, but other
helper cell subsets have also been implicated recently.

■

Chronic inflammation is a pathological condition characterized by persistent, increased expression of inflammatory cytokines.

■

Chronic inflammation has infectious and noninfectious
origins. It can be caused by an infection that is not fully
resolved as well as by chronic tissue damage brought about
by wounds, tumors, autoimmune disease, or organ disease. Obesity is now recognized as one of the most common causes of chronic inflammation.

■

Obesity can result in chronic inflammation in part because
visceral fat cells (adipocytes) can be stimulated to produce
inflammatory cytokines directly.

■

Chronic inflammation, regardless of cause, increases the
susceptibility of individuals to several systemic diseases,
including Type 2 diabetes.

■

Inflammatory cytokines associated with chronic inflammation contribute to insulin resistance (Type 2 diabetes)
by interfering with the activity of enzymes (e.g., JNK)
downstream of the insulin receptor.

■

Cytokines produced during chronic inflammation can
also induce tissue scarring (leading to organ dysfunction)
as well as cell proliferation and angiogenesis (which may
contribute to tumor development).

Tolerance, Autoimmunity,
and Transplantation

E

arly in the twentieth century, Paul Ehrlich
realized that the immune system could go awry.
Instead of reacting only against foreign antigens,
it could focus its attack on the host. This condition,
which he termed horror autotoxicus, can result in a
clinical syndrome generically referred to as autoimmunity.
This inappropriate response of the immune system,
directing humoral and/or T-cell-mediated immune
activity against self components, is the cause of
autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis (RA),
multiple sclerosis (MS), systemic lupus erythematosus
(SLE, or lupus) and certain types of diabetes. Autoimmune
reactions can cause serious damage to cells and organs,
sometimes with fatal consequences. In some cases the
damage to self cells or organs is caused by antibodies; in
other cases, T cells are the culprit.
Simply stated, autoimmunity results from some failure
of the host’s immune system to distinguish self from
nonself, causing destruction of self cells and organs.
Although on the rise, autoimmunity is still rare,
suggesting that mechanisms to protect an individual from
this sort of anti-self immune attack must exist, and they
do. This process and the mechanisms that control it are
collectively termed tolerance, or self-tolerance.
Establishing self-tolerance is complicated, involving both
the elimination of immune cells that can react against
self-antigens and active inhibition of immune responses
against self proteins. Our understanding of the
mechanisms that control self-tolerance have really
blossomed in the last decade, giving rise to new ways of
understanding and treating autoimmune disease.
When self-tolerance processes are working correctly,
host tissues should remain undisturbed by the immune
system and only foreign invaders should be attacked. As
we know from Chapter 9 and will address further below,
the mechanisms that maintain self-tolerance do so by
establishing what is “us,” making the “them” clearer. These
elaborate mechanisms that maintain self-tolerance also
cause rejection of any transplanted tissues or cells that
carry new proteins, as occurs whenever the donor is not
genetically identical to the recipient. Transplantation
refers to the act of transferring cells, tissues, or organs

from one site to another—typically from one individual to
another. Transfers between two sites on the same
individual (e.g., skin) or between identical twins, although
not free of complication, are more likely to survive. Many
diseases can be cured by implantation of a healthy organ,
tissue, or cells (a graft). The development of surgical
techniques that allow this has removed one barrier to
successful transplantation, but others remain. A
worldwide shortage of organs for transplantation leaves
tens of thousands of individuals waiting for a transplant,
sometimes for many years. And yet, the most formidable
barrier to making transplantation a routine medical
treatment is the immune system.
In this chapter, we first describe our current
understanding of the general mechanisms that establish
and maintain tolerance to self antigens. When these
mechanisms fail, autoimmunity, the second major topic of
this chapter, can result. Several common human
autoimmune diseases resulting from failures of these
mechanisms are described. These can be divided into two
broad categories: organ specific and multiorgan (systemic)
autoimmune diseases. Such diseases affect 5% to 8% of

the human population; they are often chronic and
debilitating, necessitating prolonged medical intervention.
Several experimental animal models used to study
autoimmunity, as well as therapies for treating
autoimmune disease, are also discussed. In the final part
of this chapter, we turn to the topic of transplantation, or
situations in which self-tolerance can work against us. We
begin by discussing the immunologic processes governing
graft rejection, followed by current therapeutic modalities
for suppressing these responses. We end with some of the
most commonly transplanted tissues and the potential
future role of xenotransplantation (cross-species grafts) in
clinical medicine.

Establishment and
Maintenance of Tolerance
The term tolerance applies to the many layers of protection
imposed by the immune system to prevent the reaction of its
cells and antibodies against host components. In other
words, individuals should not typically respond aggressively
against their own antigens, although they will respond to
pathogens or even cells from another individual of the same
species. Until fairly recently, this was thought to be mediated
by the elimination of cells that can react against self antigens,
yielding a state of unresponsiveness to self. Contemporary
studies of tolerance provide evidence for a much more active
role of immune cells in the selective inhibition of responses
to self antigens. Rather than ignore self proteins, the immune
system protects them. For instance, the discovery and characterization of regulatory T cells, which in fact recognize self
proteins, have revolutionized the field of tolerance and autoimmunity, not to mention transplanation.
In the first step of this process, a phenomenon termed
central tolerance deletes T- or B-cell clones before the cells
are allowed to mature if they possess receptors that recognize self antigens with high affinity (see Chapter 9). Central
tolerance occurs in the primary lymphoid organs: the bone
marrow for B cells and the thymus for T cells (Figure 16-1a).
Because central tolerance is not perfect and some self-reactive
lymphocytes find their way into the periphery and secondary
lymphoid tissues, additional safeguards limit their activity.
These backup precautions include peripheral tolerance,
which renders some self-reactive lymphocytes in secondary
lymphoid tissues inactive and generates others that actively
inhibit immune responses against self (Figure 16-1b). The
possibility of damage from self-reactive lymphocytes is further
limited by the life span of activated lymphocytes, which is
regulated by programs that induce cell death (apoptosis)
following receipt of specific signals.
The mechanisms mediating peripheral tolerance vary.
Under normal circumstances, encounter of mature lymphocytes with an antigen leads to stimulation of the immune
response. However, presenting the antigen in some alterna-

tive form, time, or location may instead lead to tolerance.
Antigens that induce tolerance are called tolerogens rather
than immunogens. Here, context is important; the same
chemical compound can be both an immunogen and a
tolerogen, depending on how and where it is presented to
the immune system. For instance, an antigen presented to
T cells without appropriate costimulation results in a form of
tolerance known as anergy (unresponsiveness to antigenic
stimulus), whereas the same antigen presented with costimulatory molecules can become a potent immunogen. When
some antigens are introduced orally, tolerance can be the
result, whereas the same antigen given as an intradermal or
subcutaneous injection can be immunogenic. In other
instances, mucosally administered antigens provide protective immunity, such as in the case of Sabin’s oral polio vaccine. However, there is one general truth: tolerogens are
antigen specific. The inactivation of an immune response
does not result in general immune suppression, but rather is
specific for the tolerogenic antigen.
In adults, most encounters with foreign antigen lead to an
immune response aimed at eradication. This is not true in
the fetus, where, due to the immature state of the immune
system, exposure to antigens frequently results in tolerance.
Other than fetal exposure, factors that promote tolerance
rather than stimulation of the immune system by a given
antigen include the following:
• High doses of antigen
• Long-term persistence of antigen in the host
• Intravenous or oral introduction
• Absence of adjuvants (compounds that enhance the
immune response to antigen)
• Low levels of costimulation
• Presentation of antigen by immature or unactivated
antigen-presenting cells (APCs)
In the 1960s, researchers believed that all self-reactive lymphocytes were eliminated during their development in the
bone marrow and thymus. The conventional wisdom suggested that failure to eliminate these lymphocytes led to autoimmune consequences. More recent experimental evidence
has countered that belief. Healthy individuals have been
shown to possess mature, recirculating, self-reactive lymphocytes. Since the presence of these self-reactive lymphocytes in
the periphery does not predict or inevitably result in autoimmune reactions, their activity must be regulated in healthy
individuals through other mechanisms. Mechanisms that
maintain tolerance include the induction of cell death or cell
anergy in lymphocytes and limitations on the activity of selfreactive cells by regulatory processes (see Figure 16-1b).
Cell death plays an important role in establishing and maintaining both central and peripheral tolerance. This is evidenced
by the development of systemic autoimmune diseases in mice
with naturally occurring mutations of either the death
receptor, Fas, or Fas ligand (FasL). As discussed in Chapter 9,

activated T cells express increased levels of Fas and FasL. In
both B and T cells, engagement of Fas by FasL induces a rapid
apoptotic death known as activation-induced cell death
(AICD). Mice that carry inactivating mutations in Fas (lpr/lpr)
or FasL (gld/gld) are not able to engage the AICD pathway and
develop autoimmune disease early in life (see below).

Antigen Sequestration Is One Means to
Protect Self Antigens from Attack
In addition to the various mechanisms of central and
peripheral tolerance, an effective means to avoid selfreactivity is sequestration or compartmentation of antigens.

The Immune System in Health and Disease

For example, the anterior chamber and lens of the eye are
considered sequestered sites, without lymphatic drainage
and possessing tissue-specific privileged antigens that are
normally isolated from interaction with immune cells. This
sequestration allows these antigens to avoid encounter with
reactive lymphocytes under normal circumstances; if the
antigen is not exposed to immune cells, there is little possibility of reactivity. However, one possible consequence of
sequestration is that the antigen is never encountered by
developing lymphocytes, and thus active tolerance to the
sequestered antigen is not established. If barriers between
immune cells and the sequestered antigens are breached (by
trauma, for example), the newly exposed antigen may be
seen as foreign because it was not previously encountered.
Trauma to one eye that allows entry of immune cells can
result in inflammation in that eye, leading to tissue destruction and impaired vision. In these cases, the other eye may
also become inflamed due to the sudden entry of clones of
these recently activated immune cells recognizing newly
discovered tissue-specific antigens.
This is not to suggest that a lack of exposure to the
immune system is the only factor that mediates immune
privilege. A locally immunosuppressive microenvironment
in tissues conventionally considered immune privileged,
such as the eye and central nervous system (CNS), in addition to other active mechanisms, is believed to bias the
immune response toward tolerance in these locations. We
discuss further some of these pathways in the following sections, as well as in Chapters 9 and 10.

Central Tolerance Limits Development of
Autoreactive T and B Cells
One mechanism strongly influencing central tolerance is the
deletion during early stages of maturation of lymphocyte
clones that have the potential to react with self components
later (see Figure 16-1a). Consider the mechanisms that generate diversity in T-cell or B-cell receptors. As discussed in
Chapter 7, the genetic rearrangements that give rise to a
functional T-cell receptor (TCR) or immunoglobulin (Ig)
occur through a process whereby any V-region gene segment can associate with any D or J gene segment. This means
that the generation of variable regions that react with self
antigens is almost inevitable. If this were allowed to occur
frequently, such TCR or Ig receptors could produce mature
functional T or B cells that recognize self antigens, and autoimmune disease would ensue.
Although our understanding of the precise molecular
mechanisms mediating central tolerance in T and B cells is
not complete, we do know that these cells undergo a developmentally regulated event called negative selection. This
results in the induction of death in some, but not all, cells
that carry potentially autoreactive TCR or Ig receptors. A
classic experiment by C. C. Goodnow and colleagues,
described in Chapter 10, mated transgenic mice expressing
hen egg white lysozyme (HEL) with mice expressing a trans-

genic immunoglobulin specific for HEL to demonstrate that
self-reactive lymphocytes are removed or inactivated after
encounter with self antigen. David Nemazee and colleagues
showed that some developing B cells can undergo receptor
editing. In this process, the antigen-specific V region is
“edited” or switched for a different V-region gene segment
via V(D)J recombination, sometimes producing a less autoreactive receptor with an affinity for self antigens below a
critical threshold that would lead to disease, allowing the cell
to survive. As mentioned in Chapters 9 and 10, the central
tolerance processes of negative selection and receptor editing work to eliminate many autoreactive T cells in the thymus and autoreactive B cells in the bone marrow.
Receptor editing, as well as clonal deletion or apoptosis,
are now recognized as mechanisms that lead to central tolerance in developing B cells (see Chapter 10). By similar
mechanisms, T cells developing in the thymus that have a
high affinity for self antigen are deleted, primarily through
the induction of apoptosis (see Chapter 9). More recently, it
has been discovered that some of these self-reactive T cells in
the thymus may be spared, and that these cells may function
in the periphery as antigen-specific regulatory cells working
to dampen immune responses to the antigens that they recognize (see below and Chapter 9).

Peripheral Tolerance Regulates Autoreactive
Cells in the Circulation
Numerous studies have shown that central tolerance is not a
foolproof process; all possible self-reactive lymphocytes are
not deleted. In fact, it is now clear that lymphocytes with
specificity for self antigens are not uncommon in the periphery. Two factors contribute to this: (1) not all self antigens are
expressed in the central lymphoid organs where negative
selection occurs, and (2) there is a threshold requirement for
affinity to self antigens before clonal deletion is triggered,
allowing some weakly self-reactive clones to survive the
weeding-out process.
Just like central tolerance, the mechanisms that control
peripheral tolerance have been demonstrated by a variety of
experimental strategies. As we saw in Chapter 11, in order
for T cells to become activated, the TCR must bind antigen
presented by self-MHC (major histocompatibility complex
molecules) (signal 1), while at the same time the T cell must
undergo costimulatory engagement (signal 2). Early experiments by Marc Jenkins and colleagues showed that when
CD4 T-cell clones are stimulated in vitro through the TCR
alone, without costimulation, they become anergic. Subsequent data showed that the interaction between CD28 on
the T cell and CD80/86 (B7) on the APC provided the
costimulatory signal required for T-cell activation. This led
to a careful examination of costimulation, revealing the existence of other molecules that could bind to CD80/86 and the
discovery of a related molecule, called CTLA-4. This molecule
inhibits rather than stimulates T-cell activation upon binding
CD80/86. We now appreciate that many such molecules

c16Tolerance,Autoimmunity,andTransplantation.indd Page 521 12/20/12 5:50 PM user-t044

/Volumes/203/MHR00209/siL52070/disk1of1/0071052070

Tolerance, Autoimmunity, and Transplantation
deliver supplementary signals during T-cell activation, and
the group of molecules that regulate T-cell behavior are now
often referred to as immunomodulatory, to cover both
costimulatory and inhibitory behavior. CTLA-4 expression
is induced only after T cells are activated, providing a mechanism to dampen T-cell activity and regulate the immune
response. Mice lacking CTLA-4 display massive proliferation of lymphocytes and widespread autoimmune disease,
suggesting an essential role for this molecule in maintaining
peripheral tolerance.
Peripheral tolerance in B cells appears to follow a similar
set of rules. For instance, experiments with transgenic mice
have demonstrated that when mature B cells encounter most
soluble antigens in the absence of T-cell help, they become
anergic and never migrate to germinal centers. In this way,
maintenance of T-cell tolerance to self antigens enforces
B-cell tolerance to the same antigens.
In T cells, a third mechanism for maintaining tolerance,
in addition to T-cell anergy and apoptosis, is through the
activity of regulatory T cells (TREG cells). Acting in secondary lymphoid tissues and at sites of inflammation, TREG cells
recognize specific self antigens, and sometimes foreign antigens, via TCR interactions. However, they down-regulate
immune processes when they engage with these antigens in
the periphery. These cells can be generated both naturally, in
the thymus (nTREG cells, Figure 16-2), and after induction by
antigen in the periphery (iTREG cells; see below). In fact,
many of the circulating T cells with specificity for self antigens may be such regulatory cells. Some scientists postulate
a division of labor, with nTREG cells specializing in regulating
responses against self antigen to inhibit autoimmune disease
and iTREG cells controlling reactions against benign foreign
antigens at mucosal surfaces, where the immune system
comes in constant contact with the outside world (e.g., gut
commensals or respiratory allergens). In a very recent study,
specifically blocking iTREG but not nTREG cell development at
the maternal-fetal interface correlated with a drop in the
number of regulatory cells specific for paternal antigens and
an increase in fetal death, suggesting that these cells may also
be involved in regulating the immune response to fetal alloantigens and may influence pregnancy outcomes.
The existence of immune inhibitory T cells was first proposed in the early 1970s by scientists who identified this
activity within the CD8 subset and called these cells CD8
suppressor T cells. However, a lack of available reagents and
expertise for isolating, propagating, and characterizing
these cells meant that many decades passed without sufficient supporting evidence of their existence. During this
time, the idea of naturally occurring immunosuppressive
cells fell out of favor, only to be resurrected 25 years later by
S. Sakaguchi and colleagues with the characterization of a
subset of CD4 T cells with immunosuppressive abilities.
Regulatory cells are currently the focus of much research,
where subsets of CD8 and CD4 T cells, as well as certain
types of APCs, have been found to possess these immunedampening capabilities.

thymocytes during negative selection in the thymus can
inhibit self-reactive T cells in the periphery. During T cell development in the thymus, thymocytes with high affinity for self antigens
undergo apoptosis, while those with low affinity are positively
selected and released. Thymocytes with intermediate affinity for
antigens encountered in the thymus up-regulate the transcription
factor FoxP3 and become natural nTREG cells, which are released into
the periphery and serve to keep self-reactive T-cell responses in
check. [M. Kronenberg and A. Rudensky. 2005. Regulation of immunity by selfreactive T cells. Nature. 435:598–604.]

Regulatory CD4 T Cells
As discussed in Chapter 9, TREG cells were most recently characterized as a unique subset of CD4 T cells that express high
levels of the IL-2R  chain (CD25), the low-affinity receptor
for this cytokine. Naturally occurring nTREG cells arise from a
subset of T cells expressing receptors with intermediate affinity for self antigens in the thymus (see Figure 16-2). Certain
of these cells up-regulate the transcription factor FoxP3 and
then develop into cells that migrate out of the thymus and are
capable of suppressing reactions to self antigens.
Evidence that CD4 TREG cells can control the immune
response to self antigens has now been demonstrated in
many experimental settings. In experiments in nonobese
diabetic (NOD) mice and BioBreeding (BB) rats, two strains
prone to the development of autoimmune-based diabetes,
the onset of diabetes was delayed when these animals were
injected with normal CD4 T cells from histocompatible
donors. Further characterization of the CD4 T cells of
nondisease-prone mice revealed that a subset expressing

The Immune System in Health and Disease

high levels of CD25 was responsible for the suppression of
diabetes. This population was further characterized using
transgenic reporter mice expressing a green fluorescent protein (GFP) fused with the transcription factor FoxP3 (FoxP3GFP mice). The GFP T cells but not the GFP T cells from
these mice could be used to transfer the immune-suppressive
activity, identifying this transcription factor as a major
regulator controlling the development of these cells.
CD4 TREG cells have also been found to suppress
responses to some nonself antigens. For example, these cells
may control allergic responses against innocuous environmental substances and/or responses to the commensal
microbes that make up the normal gut flora. In mice experimentally manipulated to lack CD4 TREG cells (approximately
5–10% of their peripheral CD4 T-cell population), inflammatory bowel disease is common. In strains of mice that are
genetically resistant to the induction of the autoimmune disease experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE; a
murine model of MS), depletion of this CD4 T cell subset
renders the mice susceptible to disease, suggesting that these
regulatory cells play a role in suppressing autoimmunity.
The pathway by which some CD4 T cells develop regulatory functions in the thymus is still unclear, despite intense
investigation. During development, engagement of the TCR
with self antigens can result in either death of the developing
thymocyte by negative selection or generation of this regulatory capacity (nTREGs). The difference between these fates
may be due to other intercellular interactions (i.e., the binding of CD28 with CD80/86 or CD40 with CD40L) or the
presence of certain cytokines. The importance of FoxP3,
which appears to be both essential and sufficient for the
induction of immunosuppressive function, can be seen in
humans inheriting a mutated form of this X-linked gene,
which causes a multiorgan autoimmune disease (see Autoimmunity below and Chapter 18).
Naïve T cells that have escaped to the periphery also can
be induced to express FoxP3 and acquire regulatory function
(iTREG cells). Factors that favor the development of iTREG
cells include the presence of certain cytokines during antigenic stimulation, chronic low-dose antigen exposure, and
lack of costimulation or the presentation of antigen by
immature dendritic cells (DCs). For example, there is significant evidence that iTREG cells and other regulators of
immunity are present in the gut-associated lymphoid tissue
(GALT). These cells are continuously exposed to gut
microbes and food-borne antigens, which themselves may
play a significant role in regulating immunity (see Clinical
Focus Box 16-1). The microenvironment of the GALT is rich
in lymphoid tissue-derived transforming growth factor beta
(TGF-), which is believed to encourage the development of
iTREG cells. There is also some evidence that T cells can
switch types, meaning that in certain circumstances TREG
cells (immunosuppressive) can acquire effector function
(immune activating), and vice versa. The cues that determine this switch are not known, although the amount of
IL-2 and other key cytokines in the microenvironment may
be a contributing factor.

inhibit APCs involves signaling through the CD80/CD86 (B7) receptor.
In the APC, this engagement results in decreased expression of
CD80/86, activation of indoleamine-2,3-dioxygenase (IDO; an enzyme
that converts tryptophan to kynurenin, creating an immunoinhibitory
microenvironment), and changes in transcription leading to decreased
expression of IL-6 and TNF-. [Adapted from Wing K, Sakaguchi S. 2010. Regulatory T cells exert checks and balances on self tolerance and autoimmunity.
Nature Immunology 11:7–13]

In studying the mechanisms by which TREG cells inhibit
immune responses, both contact-dependent and contactindependent processes have been observed. CD4 TREG cells
have been shown to kill APCs or effector T cells directly, by
means of granzyme and perforin. TREG cells may also modulate
the function of other cells responding to antigen by surface
receptor engagement. One prime example of this is the expression of CTLA-4. TREG cells express high levels of this immune
inhibitory receptor. As shown in Figure 16-3, interaction of
CTLA-4 on TREG cells with CD80/86 on an APC can lead to
inhibition of APC function, including reduced expression of
costimulatory molecules and proinflammatory cytokines, such
as IL-6 and tumor necrosis factor- (TNF-). At the same
time, these targeted APCs begin to express soluble factors that
inhibit local immune cells, including indoleamine-2,3-dioxygenase (IDO). TREG cells themselves also secrete immune
inhibitory cytokines, such as IL-10, TGF-, and IL-35, suppressing the activity of other nearby T cells and APCs. Finally,
because TREG cells express only the low-affinity IL-2R (CD25)
but not the  or  subunits, which are required for signal

CLINICAL FOCUS

It Takes Guts to Be Tolerant
In the past decade, a significant
appreciation has developed for the gastrointestinal tract and the host’s microflora in regulating the immune response.
Specifically, the commensal organisms
that comprise the gut microbiota appear
to work actively at inducing tolerance to
themselves. Maybe even more important,
the gut and the organisms that reside
there seem to play key roles in maintaining a level of systemic homeostasis that
allows for the development of tolerance
to self and that sets the stage for effective
identification and elimination of pathogens (see also Clinical Focus Box 1-3).
Formerly thought to be “ignored” by
immune cells, host microbiota are now
known to participate in a two-way communication with the immune system. This
cross-talk results in advantages for both the
host and the microbe. For the microbe, this
interaction drives immune tolerance to the
bugs, allowing them to continue to thrive in
their home. For the host, there appear to be
multiple advantages to immune health,
depending somewhat on the composition
of the microbe(s) in question. For instance,
germ-free mice have been found to harbor
defects in both humoral and adaptive
immunity, and in some strains there is an
increased susceptibility to the development
of autoimmunity. In one recent study looking at the early stages of human rheumatoid
arthritis, significantly less of specific bacterial
species were found in the intestinal flora of
afflicted individuals. Collectively, these
observations in humans and in animal models suggest that communication between
commensal microbes and the host immune
system may influence the induction or
severity of some autoimmune diseases.
The antibody responses of germ-free
mice to exogenous antigens are depressed,
as are responses to Conconavalin A (Con A),

a strong T-cell mitogen. Germ-free animals
were found to exhibit a TH2 cytokine bias
in response to antigenic challenge, which
could be restored to balance by colonization with just a single microbe, specifically
Bacteroides fragilis. Further, this restored
immune balance was most strongly associated with microbial expression of one
particular molecule: the surface-expressed
polysaccharide A. This strongly suggests
that single microorganisms, and in some
cases maybe even single molecules
expressed by these microbes, can have
systemic effects on the balance of immunity in the host.
This increased awareness of gutassociated immune regulation has spawned
several interesting hypotheses related to
tolerance. One, called the microflora or
altered microbiota hypothesis, posits that
changes in gut microflora due to dietary
modifications and/or increased antibiotic
use have disrupted normal microbially
mediated pathways important for regulating immune tolerance. There is already a
clear link between intestinal microbiota and
health of the gut, including a role for certain
microbes in regulating inflammatory syndromes of the bowel. Further evidence for
this comes from transplantation studies,
where individuals treated with immune
ablation therapy and high-dose antibiotics
show overcolonization with certain, sometimes pathogenic, microbes. These individuals frequently manifest correlating
immune defects, which can be reversed by
directly manipulating the gut microflora.
But how do our commensal microbes
influence the immune balance? Some
posit that intestinal epithelial cells (IECs)
and mucosal dendritic cells (DCs), which
express several key innate receptors,
including Toll-like receptors and NOD-like
receptors (TLRs and NLRs), may be involved.

transduction, they can act as a sponge, absorbing this growthand survival-promoting cytokine and further discouraging
expansion of local immunostimulatory effector T cells.
This pathway of inhibition is believed to be quite antigen
specific; TREG cells inhibit APCs presenting their cognate

Mucosal DCs in the gut are known to sample the contents of the intestinal lumen.
These cells could be another connection
between commensal microbes and the
maintenance of tolerance. In a study by
R. Medzhitov and colleagues, mice engineered to lack the MyD88 gene, important
for signaling through these innate receptors, were more susceptible to intestinal
injury and autoimmunity. This suggests
that signaling through these receptors can
in some instances induce tolerance rather
than an inflammatory response. This could
be explained by the delivery of tolerogenic
and homeostatic signals by as yet undefined antigens carried by the gut microbiota. Experiments to identify the specific
ligands and receptors important for this
cross-talk between microflora and the host
immune system are ongoing.
In case you were thinking of taking this
role of the gut in immune balance with a
grain of salt, you might want to think again.
Sodium chloride may be a new addition to
the list of dietary contributors to immune
pathway development. In vitro studies have
shown that the addition of sodium chloride
to cultures of CD4 T cells can drive development of TH17 cells. Expansion of this cell
type has been linked to the development
of certain autoimmune diseases. It now
appears that “We are what we eat” extends
to the immune system, which may have a
discriminating palate of its own.

again taking advantage of FoxP3-GFP mice bred with TCR
transgenic animals, it was shown that it is possible for
FoxP3 T cells to inhibit T cells recognizing other antigens,

Linked suppression

FIGURE 16-4 Linked suppression mediated by TREG cells.
In cases where a single antigen-presenting cell (APC) engages simultaneously with T cells of different specificity, inhibitory signals meant
for one can be transmitted to both and lead to a “spreading” of
immune suppression to include other antigens. [R. I. . Lechler, O. A. Garden, and L. A. Turka, 2003, The complementary roles of deletion and regulation
in transplantation tolerance, Nature Reviews Immunology 3:147–158]

as occurs when both the TREG cell and the “bystander” T cell
recognizing another antigen interact with the same APC.
The result is inhibition of the APC, via both contact-dependent
and -independent pathways, as well as inhibition of the
bystander T cell through soluble inhibitory factors and
decommissioning of the APC (Figure 16-4). This simultaneous processing and presentation of different antigens might
happen naturally in vivo when the antigens in question are
parts of the same pathogen, although based on the findings
in these experimental systems this was not required. This
phenomenon, termed linked suppression, has now been seen
in multiple experimental systems and may represent another
way that TREG cells support local self-tolerance in tissues
lacking any pathogen-induced danger signals.
Regulatory CD8 T Cells
Although an immunosuppressive role for CD8 T cells was
suggested as early as 1970, it took over 35 years to confirm
and partially characterize this cell population. Although
much work is yet to be done, the fact that CD8 TREG cells
can play a role in inhibiting responses to self antigens is now
fairly well established. For instance, adoptive transfer of a
subset of CD8 T cells can induce tolerance to heart transplants in recipient rats and can protect mice from the auto-

immune disease EAE. Although the specific phenotype/s of
these cells and the mechanisms they use are still under
debate, some central themes have begun to coalesce.
First, unlike in the case of CD4 TREG cells, the contribution to this population from thymic selection (nTREG cells) is
likely very small. In studies using TCR ovalbumin-specific
transgenic mice where all the T cells are specific for this nonself antigen, no FoxP3-expressing CD8 nTREG cells were
identified. In other experimental systems, only rare CD8
T cells emigrating from the thymus with this natural regulatory phenotype could be detected. However, in the presence
of antigen and TGF-, CD8 regulatory T cells expressing
FoxP3 can be induced (iTREG). In fact, the plasticity of this
phenotype may be quite significant. Some hypothesize that
almost any naïve T cell (CD4 or CD8) presented with
antigen and the right cocktail of cytokines along with lack of
costimulation will develop into an iTREG cell, with the potential to revert back to immune stimulatory later!
The phenotype of these cells is also complicated. Several
phenotypic markers have been associated with separate
CD8 T-cell populations that suppress immune responses.
These include CD8 (as opposed to the more common 
and  chains), both high- and low-affinity receptors for IL-2
(CD25 and CD122, respectively) and dendritic cell markers
(CD11c), as well as others. In many cases, but not all, the
master transcriptional regulator FoxP3 is also present.
As with their CD4 counterparts, CD8 TREG cells likely
use a range of mechanisms to inhibit other cells from
responding to antigen. Whether this is mediated by separate
populations of cells or by cells with the potential for many
methods of inhibition is still unclear. Like with CD4 TREG
cells, three main pathways seem to exist: APC lysis, inhibition of APC function, and regulation of effector T cells that
share cognate antigen with the CD8 TREG cell.
The hypothesis that regulatory CD8, as well as some
CD4, T cells work primarily by “decommissioning” specific
APCs has received much attention of late. For example,
CD8 T cells can efficiently use conventional cytolysis to kill
APCs presenting a self antigen, leading to a reduced frequency of presentation of this autoantigen and therefore
fewer effector T cells (both CD4 and CD8) activated
against this self molecule. Alternatively, regulatory cells may
signal APCs to reduce their costimulatory potential, with a
similar net effect. A reduction in CD80/86 expression on the
APC may be even more efficient in favoring immunosuppression; it bars an APC from stimulating T cells and, at the
same time, encourages further production of iTREG cells
upon interaction with the APC (see Figure 16-3). In fact, a
reduction in the expression of various costimulatory molecules, but not MHC class I or class II, has been seen in several experimental systems designed to study TREG cells.
Some mouse CD8 TREG cells, like their CD4 counterparts, recognize antigen using conventional MHC molecules.
However, the most well-characterized CD8 TREG cells are
restricted to the nonclassical MHC class I molecules: Qa-1 in
mice and HLA-E in humans. These nonclassical MHC

Tolerance, Autoimmunity, and Transplantation
molecules play key roles in presenting lipid antigens (see
Chapter 8). Studies using mice engineered to lack Qa-1restricted CD8 TREG cells showed that these animals develop
aggressive autoimmune reactions against self antigens, suggesting that this population is involved in regulating CD4
T-cell responses to self antigens to maintain peripheral
tolerance. In various in vitro experimental systems, CD8
iTREG cells have been found to express inhibitory cytokines,
including IL-10 and TGF-, although whether these cells are
actually using any of these cytokines in vivo to suppress
immune responses is still an open question.

Autoimmunity
Simply stated, autoimmune disease is caused by failure of the
tolerance processes described above to protect the host from
the action of self-reactive lymphocytes. These diseases result

TABLE 16-1

CHAPTER 16

from the destruction of self proteins, cells, and organs by
auto-antibodies or self-reactive T cells. For example, autoantibodies are the major offender in Hashimoto’s thyroiditis,
in which antibodies reactive with thyroid-specific antigens
cause severe tissue destruction. On the other hand, many
autoimmune diseases are characterized by tissue destruction
mediated directly by T cells. A well-known example is rheumatoid arthritis (RA), in which self-reactive T cells attack
the tissue in joints, causing an inflammatory response that
results in swelling and tissue destruction. Other examples of
T-cell-mediated autoimmune disease include insulindependent or Type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) and multiple
sclerosis (MS). Table 16-1 lists several of the more common
autoimmune disorders, as well as their primary immune
mediators.
Autoimmune disease is estimated to affect between 3%
and 8% of individuals in the industrialized world, making
this a rising problem in terms of morbidity and mortality

around the globe. These diseases are often categorized as
either organ-specific or systemic, depending on whether
they affect a single organ or multiple systems in the body.
Another method of grouping involves the immune component that does the bulk of the damage: T cells versus antibodies. In this section, we describe several examples of both
organ-specific and systemic autoimmune disease. In each
case, we discuss the antigenic target (when known), the causative process (either cellular or humoral), and the resulting
symptoms. When available, examples of animal models used
to study these disorders are also considered (Table 16-2).
Finally, we touch on the factors believed to be involved in
induction or control of autoimmunity, and the treatments
for these conditions.

Some Autoimmune Diseases
Target Specific Organs
Autoimmune diseases are caused by immune stimulatory
lymphocytes or antibodies that recognize self components,
resulting in cellular lysis and/or an inflammatory response
in the affected organ. Gradually, the damaged cellular structure is replaced by connective tissue (fibrosis), and the function of the organ declines. In an organ-specific autoimmune
disease, the immune response is usually directed to a target
antigen unique to a single organ or gland, so that the manifestations are largely limited to that organ. The cells of the
target organs may be damaged directly by humoral or cellmediated effector mechanisms. Alternatively, anti-self anti-

bodies may overstimulate or block the normal function of
the target organ.
Hashimoto’s Thyroiditis
In Hashimoto’s thyroiditis, an individual produces autoantibodies and sensitized TH1 cells specific for thyroid
antigens. This disease is much more common in women,
often striking in middle-age (see Clinical Focus Box 16-2).
Antibodies are formed to a number of thyroid proteins,
including thyroglobulin and thyroid peroxidase, both of
which are involved in the uptake of iodine. Binding of the
auto-antibodies to these proteins interferes with iodine
uptake, leading to decreased thyroid function and hypothyroidism (decreased production of thyroid hormones). The
resulting delayed-type hypersensitivity (DTH) response is
characterized by an intense infiltration of the thyroid gland
by lymphocytes, macrophages, and plasma cells, which form
lymphocytic follicles and germinal centers. (See Chapter 15
for a description of the DTH response.) The ensuing inflammatory response causes a goiter, or visible enlargement of the
thyroid gland, a physiological response to hypothyroidism.
Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus
Type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) or insulin-dependent diabetes, affects almost 2 in 1000 children in the U.S.; roughly
double the incidence observed just 20 years ago. It is seen
mostly in youth under the age of 14 and is less common than
Type 2, or non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus. T1DM is
caused by an autoimmune attack against insulin-producing

cells (beta cells) scattered throughout the pancreas, which
results in decreased production of insulin and consequently
increased levels of blood glucose. The attack begins with cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) infiltration and activation of macrophages, frequently referred to as insulitis (Figure 16-5b),
followed by cytokine release and the production of autoantibodies, which leads to a cell-mediated DTH response. The
subsequent beta-cell destruction is thought to be mediated by
cytokines released during the DTH response and by lytic
enzymes released from the activated macrophages. Autoantibodies specific for beta cells may contribute to cell destruction by facilitating either antibody-mediated complement lysis
or antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC).
The abnormalities in glucose metabolism associated with
T1DM result in serious metabolic problems that include
ketoacidosis (accumulation of ketone, a breakdown product
from fat) and increased urine production. The late stages of
the disease are often characterized by atherosclerotic vascular lesions (which cause gangrene of the extremities due to

|

CHAPTER 16

impeded vascular flow), renal failure, and blindness. If
untreated, death can result. The most common therapy for
T1DM is daily administration of insulin. Although this is
helpful, sporadic doses are not the same as metabolically
regulated, continuous, and controlled release of the hormone. Unfortunately, diabetes can remain undetected for
many years, allowing irreparable loss of pancreatic tissue to
occur before treatment begins.
One of the best-studied animal models of this disease is
the NOD mouse, which spontaneously develops a form of
diabetes that resembles human T1DM. This disorder also
involves lymphocytic infiltration of the pancreas and
destruction of beta cells, and carries a strong association
with certain MHC alleles. Disease is mediated by bonemarrow-derived cells; normal mice reconstituted with an
injection of bone marrow cells from NOD mice will develop
diabetes, and healthy NOD mice that have not yet developed
disease can be spared by reconstitution with bone marrow
cells from normal mice. NOD mice housed in germ-free
environments show a higher incidence of diabetes compared
to those in normal housing, suggesting that microbes may
influence the development of autoimmune disease. In
genome-wide scans, over 20 insulin-dependent diabetes
(Idd) loci associated with disease susceptibility have been
identified, including at least one member of the TNF receptor family.
Myasthenia Gravis
Myasthenia gravis is the classic example of an autoimmune
disease mediated by blocking antibodies. A patient with this
disease produces auto-antibodies that bind the acetylcholine
receptors (AchRs) on the motor end plates of muscles,
blocking the normal binding of acetylcholine and inducing
complement-mediated lysis of the cells. The result is a progressive weakening of the skeletal muscles (Figure 16-6).
Ultimately, the antibodies cause the destruction of the cells
bearing the receptors. The early signs of this disease include
drooping eyelids and inability to retract the corners of the
mouth. Without treatment, progressive weakening of the
muscles can lead to severe impairment of eating as well as
problems with movement. However, with appropriate treatment, this disease can be managed quite well and afflicted
individuals can lead a normal life. Treatments are aimed at
increasing acetylcholine levels (e.g., using cholinesterase
inhibitors), decreasing antibody production (using corticosteroids or other immunosuppressants), and/or removing
antibodies (using plasmapheresis).
One of the first experimentally induced autoimmune
disease animal models was discovered serendipitously in
1973, when rabbits immunized with AChRs purified from
electric eels suddenly became paralyzed. (The original aim
was to generate monoclonal antibodies for research use.)
These rabbits developed antibodies against the foreign
AChR that cross-reacted with their own AChRs. These autoantibodies then blocked muscle stimulation by Ach at the
synapse and led to progressive muscle weakness. Within a

The Immune System in Health and Disease

CLINICAL FOCUS

Why Are Women More Susceptible Than Men to Autoimmunity?
Gender Differences in Autoimmune Disease
Of the nearly 50 million individuals
in the United States believed to be living
with autoimmune disease, approximately
78% are women. As shown in the following table, female-biased predisposition to
autoimmunity is more apparent in some
diseases than others. For example, the
female-to-male ratio of individuals who
suffer from diseases such as multiple sclerosis (MS) or rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is
approximately two or three females to
one male. There are nine women for every
one man afflicted with systemic lupus
erythematosus (SLE). However, these statistics do not tell the entire story. In some
diseases, such as MS, the severity can be
worse in men than in women. That
women are more susceptible to autoimmune disease has been recognized for
many years. The reasons are not entirely
understood, although recent advances
are helping to clarify this difference.
Although it may seem unlikely, considerable evidence suggests significant gender differences in immune responses. In
general, females tend to mount more
vigorous humoral and cellular immune
responses. Immune cell activation, cytokine secretion after infection, numbers of
circulating CD4 T cells and mitogenic

responses are all higher in women than
men. Immunization studies conducted in
mice and humans show that females produce a higher titer of antibodies than
males; this is true during both primary
and secondary responses. In transplantation, women also suffer from a higher rate
of graft rejection. As one might guess, this
enhanced immunity in females means
that males, in general, are slightly more
prone to infections.
The prevailing view is that sex hormone differences between men and
women account for at least part of the
observed gender difference in the rates of
autoimmunity. Some of this evidence
comes from observations made in SLE,
where young women of child-bearing
age are at greatest risk for the disease.
Lupus flares during pregnancy (a high
estrogen state) and increased rates of
remission following menopause (a low
estrogen state) also point to sex hormones
as potential regulators of this autoimmune
disease. The general consensus is that
estrogens, the more female-specific hormones, are associated with enhanced
immunity whereas androgens, or malebased hormones, are associated with its
suppression.

In mice, whose gender differences are
easier to study, a large body of literature
documents gender differences in immune
responses. Female mice are much more
likely than male mice to develop TH1
responses and, in infections for which proinflammatory TH1 responses are beneficial,
are more likely to be resistant to the infection. An excellent example is infection by
viruses such as vesicular stomatitis virus
(VSV), herpes simplex virus (HSV), and
Theiler’s murine encephalomyelitis virus
(TMEV). Clearance of these viruses is
enhanced by TH1 responses. In other cases,
however, a pro-inflammatory response
can be deleterious. For example, a TH1
response to lymphocytic choriomeningitis
virus (LCMV) correlates with more severe
disease and significant pathology. Thus,
female mice are more likely to succumb to
infection with LCMV. The importance of
gender in LCMV infection is underscored
by experiments demonstrating that castrated male mice behave immunologically like females and are more likely to
experience autoimmune disease than
uncastrated males.
Why this dichotomy between the
sexes? One hypothesis posits that this
increased risk of autoimmunity in women

is a by-product of the evolutionary role of
women as bearers of children. Pregnancy
may give us a clue as to how sex plays a
role in regulating immune response. During pregnancy, it is critical that the mother
tolerate the fetus, which is a type of foreign
semi-allograft. This makes it very likely,
maybe even crucial for successful implantation and fetal development, that the
female immune system undergoes important modifications during pregnancy.
Recall that females normally tend to mount
more TH1-like responses than TH2
responses. During pregnancy, however,
women mount more TH2-like responses.
It is thought that pregnancy-associated
levels of sex steroids may promote an antiinflammatory environment. In this regard,
it is notable that diseases enhanced by TH2like responses, such as SLE, which has a
strong antibody-mediated component,
can be exacerbated during pregnancy,
whereas diseases that involve inflammatory responses, such as RA and MS, sometimes are ameliorated in pregnant women.
Another effect of pregnancy is the presence of fetal cells in the maternal circulation, creating a state called microchimerism.
Fetal cells can persist in the maternal circulation for decades. These long-lived fetal
cells may play a role in the development of
autoimmune disease. Furthermore, the
exchange of cells during pregnancy is bidirectional (cells of the mother may also

that the presence of the mother’s cells in

Although some studies have linked the
presence of microchimerism with certain
autoimmune syndromes, other studies
have contradicted these findings, casting

year, this animal model, called experimental autoimmune
myasthenia gravis (EAMG), led to the discovery that autoantibodies to the AChR were also the cause of myasthenia
gravis in humans.

Some Autoimmune Diseases Are Systemic
In systemic autoimmune diseases, the immune response is
directed toward a broad range of target antigens and involves
a number of organs and tissues. These diseases reflect a general defect in immune regulation that results in hyperactive
T cells and/or B cells. Tissue damage is typically widespread,
both from cell-mediated immune responses and from direct
cellular damage caused by auto-antibodies or by accumulation of immune complexes.

Systemic Lupus Erythematosus
One of the best examples of a systemic autoimmune disease
is systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Like several of the
other autoimmune syndromes, this disease is more common
in women, with approximately a 9:1 ratio (see Clinical Focus
Box 16-2). Onset of symptoms typically appears between 20
and 40 years of age and is more frequent in African American and Hispanic women than in Caucasians, for unknown
reasons. In identical twins where one suffers from SLE, the
other has up to a 60% chance of developing SLE, suggesting
a genetic component. However, although close relatives of an
SLE patient are 25 times more likely to contract the disease,
still only 2% of these individuals ever develop SLE.
Affected individuals may produce auto-antibodies to a
vast array of tissue antigens, such as DNA, histones, RBCs,

The Immune System in Health and Disease

platelets, leukocytes, and clotting factors. Signs and symptoms include fever, weakness, arthritis, skin rashes (Figure 16-7), and kidney dysfunction. Auto-antibodies specific
for RBCs and platelets can lead to complement-mediated
lysis, resulting in hemolytic anemia and thrombocytopenia, respectively. When immune complexes of auto-antibodies
with various nuclear antigens are deposited along the walls
of small blood vessels, a type III hypersensitivity reaction
develops. The complexes activate the complement system
and generate membrane-attack complexes and complement fragments (C3a and C5a) that damage the wall of the
blood vessel, resulting in vasculitis and glomerulonephritis. In severe cases, excessive complement activation produces elevated serum levels of certain complement
fragments, leading to neutrophil aggregation and attachment to the vascular endothelium. Over time, the number
of circulating neutrophils declines (neutropenia) and
occlusions of various small blood vessels develop (vasculitis), which can lead to widespread tissue damage. Laboratory diagnosis of SLE involves detection of antinuclear
antibodies directed against double-stranded or singlestranded DNA, nucleoprotein, histones, and nucleolar
RNA. Indirect immunofluorescent staining with serum
from SLE patients produces characteristic nuclear-staining
patterns (Figure 16-8).
New Zealand Black (NZB) mice and F1 hybrids of NZB x
New Zealand White (NZW) mice spontaneously develop
autoimmune diseases that closely resemble SLE. NZB mice
develop autoimmune hemolytic anemia between 2 and 4
months of age, at which time various auto-antibodies can be
detected, including antibodies to erythrocytes, nuclear proteins, DNA, and T lymphocytes. F1 hybrids develop glomerulonephritis from immune-complex deposits in the
kidney and die prematurely. As in human SLE, the incidence
of autoimmunity in F1 hybrids is greater in females.

Multiple Sclerosis
Multiple sclerosis (MS) is the most common cause of neurologic disability associated with disease in Western countries. MS occurs in women two to three times more
frequently than men (see Clinical Focus Box 16-2) and, like
SLE, frequently develops during childbearing years (approximately 20–40 years of age). Individuals with this disease
produce autoreactive T cells that participate in the formation of inflammatory lesions along the myelin sheath of
nerve fibers in the brain and spinal cord. Since myelin functions to insulate the nerve fibers, a breakdown in the myelin
sheath leads to numerous neurologic dysfunctions, ranging
from numbness in the limbs to paralysis or loss of vision.
Epidemiological studies indicate that MS is most common in the Northern Hemisphere and, interestingly, in the
United States. Populations north of the 37th parallel have a
markedly higher prevalence of MS than those south of this
latitude. Individuals born south of the 37th parallel who
move north before age 15 assume the higher relative risk.
These provocative data suggest that an environmental component early in life affects the risk of contracting MS.
Genetic influences are also important. The average person in
the United States has about one chance in 1000 of developing
MS; this increases to 1 in 50 to 100 for children or siblings of
people with MS, and to 1 in 3 for an identical twin. The cause
of MS is not well understood. Infection by certain viruses,
such as Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), may predispose a person
to MS. Some viruses can cause demyelinating diseases, but
the data linking viruses to MS are not definitive.
EAE, one of the best-studied animal models of autoimmune disease, is mediated solely by T cells. It can be
induced in a variety of species by immunization with

Tolerance, Autoimmunity, and Transplantation
myelin basic protein (MBP) or proteolipid protein (PLP)—
both components of the myelin sheaths surrounding neurons
in the CNS—in complete Freund’s adjuvant. Within 2 to 3
weeks, the animals develop cellular infiltration of the
CNS, resulting in demyelination and paralysis. Most of the
animals die, but others have milder symptoms, and some
develop a chronic form of the disease that resembles relapsing and remitting MS in humans. Those that recover are
resistant to the development of disease from a subsequent
challenge with MBP and adjuvant. In these experiments,
exposure of immature T cells to self antigens that normally
are not present in the thymus presumably led to tolerance to
these antigens. EAE was also prevented in susceptible rats
by prior injection of MBP directly into the thymus. MBP is
normally sequestered from the immune system by the
blood-brain barrier, but in EAE the immune system is
exposed to it under nonphysiologic conditions. EAE in
small mammals does provide a system for testing treatments for human MS.
Rheumatoid Arthritis
Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a fairly common autoimmune
disorder, most often diagnosed between the ages of 40 to 60
and more frequently seen in women. The major symptom is
chronic inflammation of the joints (Figure 16-9), although
the hematologic, cardiovascular, and respiratory systems are
also frequently affected. Many individuals with RA produce
a group of auto-antibodies called rheumatoid factors that
are reactive with determinants in the Fc region of IgG—in
other words, antibodies specific for antibodies! The classic
rheumatoid factor is an IgM antibody that binds to normal
circulating IgG, forming IgM-IgG complexes that are
deposited in the joints. These immune complexes can activate the complement cascade, resulting in a type III hypersensitivity reaction, which leads to chronic inflammation
of the joints. Treatments for RA include nonspecific drugs
aimed at reducing inflammation, such as nonsteroidal
anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and corticosteroids.

CHAPTER 16

More disease-specific immune modifiers have also been
introduced, including antibodies that block TNF- and IL-6
(see treatment below).

Both Intrinsic and Extrinsic Factors Can Favor
Susceptibility to Autoimmune Disease
Overzealous immune activation can lead to autoimmunity,
although suboptimal immune stimulation results in insufficiency that can allow microbes to take control. But what tips
the balance toward a break in tolerance and the development
of autoimmunity? Experiments with germ-free mouse models, discordance data in identical twins, and epidemiologic
studies of geographic associations all suggest roles for both
the environment and genes in susceptibility to the development of autoimmunity.
Environmental Factors Favoring the Development
of Autoimmune Disease
As mentioned earlier, some autoimmune syndromes are more
common in certain geographic locations or in particular climates. This suggests a link between environmental exposures
(some of which may be microbial) or lifestyle factors, such as
diet, in the development of autoimmune disease. For instance,
we now know that cross-talk between gut microflora and the
systemic immune system may help regulate peripheral tolerance, which could impact the development of autoimmune
disease. Animals maintained in germ-free environments often
show heightened susceptibility to autoimmune disease compared to their germ-laden counterparts. How commensal
microbes influence tolerance and autoimmunity is an active
area of research (see Clinical Focus Box 16-1).
Infections may also influence the induction of autoimmunity. For example, tissue pathology following infection
may result in the release of sequestered self antigens that are
presented in a way that fosters immune activation rather
than tolerance induction. Likewise, the molecular structures
of certain microbes may share chemical features with self
components, resulting in the activation of immune cells with
cross-reactive potential.
The Role of Genes in Susceptibility
to Autoimmunity
Certain alleles within the MHC have been linked to several
different autoimmune disorders. The strongest association
between an HLA allele and autoimmunity is seen in ankylosing spondylitis, an inflammatory disease of vertebral
joints. Individuals who express HLA-B27 are 90 times more
likely to develop ankylosing spondylitis than individuals
with a different HLA allele at this locus. This does not imply
causation; not all individuals who express HLA-B27 experience this syndrome, suggesting that the relationship between
MHC alleles and development of autoimmune disease is
multifaceted. Interestingly, unlike many other autoimmune
diseases, 90% of the cases of ankylosing spondylitis are seen
in males.

The Immune System in Health and Disease

Some non-MHC inherited genetic mutations can have
causative effects on the development of autoimmunity.
Not surprisingly, these tend to play prominent roles in
immune regulation. Inactivating mutations in two
immune-related genes, aire and FoxP3, result in forms of
immune deficiency that impact central and peripheral
tolerance, respectively (see above, as well as Chapters 9
and 18). A mutant form of aire has been shown to cause
autoimmune polyendocrinopathy-candidiasis-ectodermal
dystrophy (APECED), a systemic disease resulting from
defective deletion or inactivation of autoreactive T cells in
the thymus. The cause of another human autoimmune
disorder—immune dysregulation, polyendocrinopathy,
enteropathy, and X-linked syndrome (IPEX) has been
mapped to mutations in the FoxP3 gene. The product of
this gene is required for the formation of many, but not all,
regulatory T cells, suggesting that this disease is caused by
an inability to generate the TREG cells needed to maintain
peripheral tolerance.
Many other genes with more subtle or even cumulative
effects on susceptibility to autoimmunity have also been
discovered. Not surprisingly, most of these play some role in
the immune response. Genes for cytokines and their receptors, antigen processing and presentation, c-type lectin
receptors, signaling pathways, adhesion molecules, and
costimulatory or inhibitory receptors have all been linked to
specific autoimmune diseases (Table 16-3). In many
instances, multiple genes (sometimes with compounding
environmental factors) may be required in order to predispose an individual to a particular autoimmune disease. In
some cases, a single gene can heighten susceptibility to multiple different autoimmune disorders. For instance, a mutant
form of PTPN22, a tyrosine phosphatase, results in reduced

TCR signaling capacity and has been linked to T1DM, RA,
and SLE. It is believed that attenuation of TCR signaling during positive and negative selection may be what predisposes
carriers of this allele to autoimmunity.
The Role of Certain T Helper Cell Types
in Autoimmunity
In both organ-specific and systemic autoimmunity, CD4
rather than CD8 T cells have been linked to disease pathogenesis. However, the T helper (TH) cell type or set of cytokines most closely associated with autoimmunity depends
somewhat on the model system or human disease in question. As we know from Chapter 11, the antigen, the type of
APC to make first encounter, and the surface receptors used
during this engagement set the stage for the transition from
innate to adaptive immunity. In this transition, the cytokine
milieu will help determine which subsets of a TH cell will
predominate. The induction of autoimmunity is likewise a
complex process, where even experimental models of the
same human disease can be induced by different means,
making outcomes in each case difficult to correlate. Nevertheless, a few themes have emerged from both human and
animal studies of autoimmune disease.
Much of the initial data collected from various studies of
autoimmune disease supported a role for autoreactive TH1
cells and IFN-. For example, IFN- levels in the CNS of
mice with EAE correlate with the severity of disease, and
treatment with this cytokine exacerbates MS in humans.
Likewise, adoptive transfer of IFN--producing CD4 TH
cells from mice with EAE can induce disease in naïve hosts.
On the flip side, elimination of IFN- using either neutralizing antibodies or removal of the gene does not protect
animals from EAE; in fact, it worsens the symptoms.

These conflicting results led to the study of other cytokines or T cell types that may be involved in the induction of
autoimmunity, especially those connected to IFN-. Recall
from Chapter 11 that IL-12 and IL-23, which can be produced by APCs during activation, encourage the production
of other cytokines, such as either IFN- or IL-17, favoring
T-cell development along TH1 or TH17 pathways, respectively. Studies have shown that mice engineered to lack the
gene for the p40 subunit of IL-12, which happens to be
shared with IL-23, are protected from EAE. This protection
is due to inhibition of IL-23, a cytokine required to sustain
TH17 cells. Mice lacking IL-17A are less susceptible to both
EAE and collagen-induced arthritis, a model for human RA.
In follow-up studies of patients with RA and psoriasis, elevated IL-17 expression has been found at the site of inflammation, and increased serum levels of IL-17 and IL-23 have
been observed in patients with SLE. Collectively, these findings support the notion that TH17 cells may be an important
driver of some autoimmune diseases.

CHAPTER 16

533

Several Possible Mechanisms Have Been
Proposed for the Induction of Autoimmunity
In addition to genetic and environmental predisposing factors, autoimmunity likely develops from a number of different events. Disease may be induced by certain genetic
mutations, the release of sequestered antigens, overstimulation of antigen-specific receptors, and stochastic events. In
most cases, a combination of these is the cause. Another
issue is the sex difference in autoimmune susceptibility,
with diseases such as Hashimoto’s thyroiditis, SLE, MS, and
RA preferentially affecting women. Factors that may account
for this, such as hormonal differences between the sexes and
the potential effects of fetal cells in the maternal circulation
following pregnancy, are discussed in the Clinical Focus
Box 16-2.
As a result of random V(D)J recombination, over half of
all antigen-specific receptors recognize self proteins. Not all
of these are deleted during negative selection (see Chapter
9). Potentially self-reactive T and B cells found in the periphery are normally held in check by anergic or regulatory
mechanisms, such as TREG cells. However, exposure to carcinogens or infectious agents that favor DNA damage or
polyclonal activation can potentially interfere with this regulation and/or lead to the expansion and survival of rare T- or
B-cell clones with autoimmune potential (Table 16-4). Genes
that, when mutated, could favor expansion include those
encoding antigen receptors, signaling molecules, costimulatory or inhibitory molecules, apoptosis regulators, or growth
factors (see Table 16-3). Gram-negative bacteria, cytomegalovirus, and EBV are all known polyclonal activators, inducing the proliferation of numerous clones of B cells that
express IgM in the absence of T-cell help. If B cells reactive
to self antigens are activated by this mechanism, autoantibodies can appear.
A role for particular microbial agents in autoimmunity
was postulated for several reasons beyond their potential
for DNA damage or polyclonal activation. As discussed
earlier, some autoimmune syndromes are associated with
certain geographic regions, and immigrants to an area can
acquire enhanced susceptibility to the disorder associated
with that region. This, coupled with the fact that a number
of viruses and bacteria possess antigenic determinants that
are similar or even identical to normal host-cell components, led to a hypothesis known as molecular mimicry.
This proposes that some pathogens express protein epitopes
resembling self components in either conformation or primary sequence. For instance, rheumatic fever, a disease
caused by autoimmune destruction of heart muscle cells,
can develop after a Group A Streptococcus infection. In this
case, antibodies to streptococcal antigens have been shown
to cross-react with the heart muscle proteins, resulting in
immune complex deposition and complement activation, a
type II hypersensitivity reaction (see Chapter 15). In one
study, 600 different monoclonal antibodies specific for 11
different viruses were evaluated for their reactivity with

The Immune System in Health and Disease

normal tissue antigens. More than 3% of the virus-specific
antibodies tested also bound to normal tissue, suggesting
that molecular similarity between foreign and host antigens
may be fairly common. In these cases, susceptibility may
also be influenced by the MHC haplotype of the individual,
since certain class I and class II MHC molecules may be
more effective than others in presenting the homologous
peptide for T-cell activation.
Release of sequestered antigens is another proposed
mechanism of autoimmune initiation, one that may in
some cases also be connected with environmental exposures. The induction of self-tolerance in T cells results from
exposure of immature thymocytes to self antigens in the
thymus, followed by clonal deletion or inactivation of any
self-reactive cells (see Chapter 9). Tissue antigens that are
not expressed in the thymus will not engage with developing
T cells and will thus not induce self-tolerance. Trauma to
tissues following either an accident or an infection can
release these sequestered antigens into the circulation. For
instance, the release of heart muscle antigens following myocardial infarction (heart attack) can lead to the formation of
auto-antibodies that target healthy heart muscle cells. Studies involving injection of normally sequestered antigens
directly into the thymus of susceptible animals support this
proposed mechanism: injection of CNS myelin proteins or
pancreatic beta cells can inhibit the development of EAE or
diabetes, respectively. In these experiments, exposure of
immature T cells to self antigens normally not present in the
thymus presumably led to central and possibly also peripheral tolerance to these antigens.
It is worth reiterating that, although certain events may
be associated with the development of autoimmunity, a complex combination of genotype and environmental factors
likely influences the balance of self-tolerance versus development of autoimmune disease.

Autoimmune Diseases Can Be
Treated by General or Pathway-Specific
Immunosuppression
Ideally, treatment for autoimmune diseases should reduce
only the autoimmune response, leaving the rest of the
immune system intact. However, implementing this strategy
has proven difficult. The current therapies to treat autoimmune disease fall into two categories: broad spectrum
immunosuppressive treatments and more recent mechanism- or cell-type-specific strategies (Table 16-5).
Broad-Spectrum Therapies
Most first-generation therapies for autoimmune diseases are
not cures but merely palliatives, reducing symptoms to provide the patient with an acceptable quality of life. For example, most general immunosuppressive treatments (e.g.,
corticosteroids, azathioprine, and cyclophosphamide) are
strong anti-inflammatory drugs that suppress lymphocytes

by inhibiting their proliferation or by killing these rapidly
dividing cells. Side effects of these drugs include general
cytotoxicity, an increased risk of uncontrolled infection, and
the development of cancer.
In some autoimmune diseases, removal of a specific organ
or set of toxic compounds can alleviate symptoms. Patients
with myasthenia gravis often have thymic abnormalities (e.g.,
thymic hyperplasia or thymomas), in which case thymectomy can increase the likelihood of remission. Plasmapheresis may also provide significant if short-term benefit for
diseases involving antigen-antibody complexes (e.g., myasthenia gravis, SLE, and RA), where removal of a patient’s
plasma antibodies temporarily eliminates these complexes.
Strategies That Target Specific Cell Types
When antibodies and/or immune complexes are heavily
involved in autoimmune pathology, strategies aimed at B cells
can improve clinical symptoms. For example, a monoclonal
antibody against the B-cell-specific antigen CD20 (Rituximab) depletes a subset of B cells and provides short-term
benefit for RA. However, most cell-type specific agents used
to treat autoimmune disorders target T cells or their products because these cells are either directly pathogenic or
provide help to autoreactive B cells.
The first anti-T-cell antibodies used to treat autoimmune
disease targeted the CD3 molecule and were designed to
deplete T cells without signaling through this receptor.
Although somewhat effective in the treatment of T1DM, this
method still induced broad-spectrum immune suppression.
Anti-CD4 antibodies successfully reversed MS and arthritis
in animal models, although human trials of this treatment
have shown no efficacy. A possible reason for this failure is
that anti-CD4 may interfere with the activity of CD4CD25
regulatory T cells, a cell type we now know is key to the
regulation of tolerance.
With this in mind and with the discovery of the TH17
subset, scientists are beginning to target specific T helper cell
pathways. In several mouse models of autoimmunity, including MS, T1DM, SLE, and IPEX, the transfer of TREG cells can
clearly inhibit disease pathogenesis. The greatest difficulty
with translating this from mouse to human is in selecting a
population of TREG cells, as FoxP3 in humans does not correlate well with immunosuppressive activity. Therefore, most
of the emphasis in the clinical applications of this approach
is currently directed toward mimicking TREG-like mechanisms of suppression (e.g., using IL-10) or inhibiting TH17mediated effects (e.g., using IL-17 or IL-23 blocking
antibodies).
Therapies That Block Steps in
the Inflammatory Process
Since chronic inflammation is a hallmark of debilitating autoimmune disease, steps in the inflammatory process are
potential targets for intervention. Drugs that block TNF-,
one of the early mediators in the inflammatory process, are

have shown encouraging results. The addition of such drugs
with prior FDA approval and extensive safety testing is a tremendous advantage, considering that 95% of agents fail
human trials due to safety concerns.
Compounds that block the chemokine or adhesion molecule signals controlling lymphocyte movement into sites of
inflammation can also thwart autoimmune processes. The
most well-characterized inhibitor of cell trafficking is
FTY720. This compound is an analog of sphingosine
1-phosphate (S1P), which is involved in the migration of
lymphocytes into the blood and lymph. By acting as a receptor antagonist, it inhibits egress of all subsets of T cells,
resulting in a reduction of up to 85% in circulating blood
lymphocytes. Importantly, FTY720, which has been effective
in treating MS, is also reported to inhibit TH1 and TH17 cells,
and to enhance TREG cell activity.
Strategies That Interfere with Costimulation
T cells require both antigenic stimulation via the TCR
(signal 1) and costimulation (signal 2) in order to become
fully activated (see Chapter 11). Without costimulation,
T cells undergo apoptosis, become anergic, or are induced
as immune inhibitors. Therefore, one way to control T-cell
activation would be to regulate costimulation. To this end,
a fusion protein was generated consisting of the extracellular domain of CTLA-4 combined with the human IgG1
constant region. CTLA-4 binds to its CD80/86 partner
with an affinity that is approximately 20 times greater than
that of CD28. This therapeutic fusion protein, called
abatacept (Orencia) and approved for the treatment of RA,
has also been studied with limited success in patients with
MS, T1DM, SLE, and inflammatory bowel disease. This
drug blocks CD80/86 on APCs from engaging with CD28
on T cells.
Antigen-Specific Immunotherapy
The holy grail of immunotherapy to treat autoimmune disease is a strategy that specifically targets the autoreactive
cells, sparing all other leukocytes. In an ideal world, clinical
therapies that induce tolerance to the auto-antigen could
reverse the course of autoimmune disease. However, even in
cases when the auto-antigen is known, as with T1DM and
MS, there is a risk of exacerbating the disease by introduction of the tolerogen, as was seen in some of the early trials.
Nonetheless, glatiramer acetate (GA), a polymer of four
basic amino acids found commonly in MBP and approved
for treating MS, selectively increased the number of TREG
cells and modulated the function of APCs, suggesting that
this strategy may also be effective for the treatment of other
autoimmune disorders. This drug is the only FDA-approved
antigen-specific treatment currently available for an autoimmune disease, although others are in the pipeline. BHT3021, a DNA-based product aimed at tolerizing the immune
system to proinsulin, if approved, would be the first antigenbased treatment for type 1 diabetes.

Transplantation Immunology
Alexis Carrel reported the first systematic study of transplantation in 1908; he interchanged both kidneys in a series
of cats, some of which maintained urinary output for up to
25 days. Although all the cats eventually died, the experiment established that a transplanted organ could carry out
its normal function in the recipient. The first human kidney
transplant, attempted in 1935 by a Russian surgeon, failed
because a mismatch of blood types between donor and
recipient caused almost immediate rejection of the kidney.
We now know that this rapid immune response, termed
hyperacute rejection, is mediated by preformed antibodies
(described below). Finally, in 1954 a team in Boston headed
by Joseph Murray performed the first successful human kidney transplant between identical twins, followed 3 years later
by the first transplant between nonidentical individuals.
Today, the transfer of various organs and tissues between
individuals is performed with ever-increasing frequency and
rates of success, at least for their short-term survival.
Although a supply of organs is provided by accident victims and, in some cases, living donors, many more people
are in need of transplants than can be accommodated with
available organs. According to the U.S Department of Health
and Human Services, as of December 2012 over 116,000
individuals in the United States are on the waiting list for an
organ transplant (see http://optn.transplant.hrsa.gov for
real-time data). The majority of those on the list (over 75%)
require a kidney, for which the median waiting period
ranges from 3 to 5 years.
Immunosuppressive agents can delay or prevent rejection
of transplanted organs, but they have side effects. New treatments that promise longer transplant survival and more
specific tolerance to the graft without suppressing other
immune function are under development. This section
describes the mechanisms underlying graft rejection, procedures that are presently used to prolong graft survival, and
the current status of transplantation as a clinical tool.

Graft Rejection Occurs Based on
Immunologic Principles
The degree and type of immune response to a transplant varies with the type and source of the grafted tissue. The following terms denote different types of transplants:
• Autograft is self tissue transferred from one body site to
another in the same individual. Examples include transferring healthy skin to a burned area in burn patients
and using healthy blood vessels to replace blocked coronary arteries.
• Isograft is tissue transferred between genetically identical individuals. This occurs in inbred strains of mice or
identical human twins, when the donor and recipient are
syngeneic.

• Allograft is tissue transferred between genetically different members of the same species. In mice this means
transferring tissue from one strain to another, and in
humans this occurs in transplants in which the donor
and recipient are not genetically identical (the majority
of cases).
• Xenograft is tissue transferred between different species
(e.g., the graft of a baboon heart into a human). Because
of significant shortages of donated organs, raising animals for the specific purpose of serving as organ donors
for humans is under serious consideration.
Autografts and isografts are usually accepted, owing to the
genetic identity between donor and recipient (Figure 16-10a).
Because an allograft is genetically dissimilar to the host and

therefore expresses unique antigens, it is often recognized as
foreign by the immune system and is therefore rejected. Obviously, xenografts exhibit the greatest genetic and antigenic
disparity, engendering a vigorous graft rejection response.
Specificity and Memory in Allograft Rejection
The rate of allograft rejection varies according to the tissue
involved; skin grafts are generally rejected faster than other
tissues, such as kidney or heart. Despite these time differences, the immune response culminating in graft rejection
always displays the attributes of specificity and memory. If
an inbred mouse of strain A is grafted with skin from strain
B, primary graft rejection, known as first-set rejection,
occurs (Figure 16-10b). The skin first becomes revascularized between days 3 and 7. As the reaction develops, the

tions resulted in more pronounced graft rejection. These data
are supported by human studies showing CD4 and CD8
T cells infiltrating human kidney allografts.
The role of DCs in rejection or tolerance of an allograft is
the subject of increasing interest due to their immunostimulatory capacity and their role in the induction of tolerance. As
discussed in Chapter 8, DCs can present exogenous antigens in
the context of class I MHC molecules via cross-presentation,
giving CD8 T cells the opportunity to recognize alloantigens
as part of the rejection process. In mice, inhibition of DCs can
aid graft acceptance (presumably by interfering with the presentation of donor antigens), although pretreatment with
donor DCs can promote survival of both heart and pancreas
transplants (possibly by inducing tolerance to donor antigens).

Role of T Cells in Graft Rejection
Using adoptive transfer studies in the early 1950s, Avrion
Mitchison showed that donor lymphocytes but not serum
antibody could transfer allograft rejection responses. Later
studies further defined these as T cells. For instance, nude
mice, which lack a thymus and consequently lack functional
T cells, were found to be incapable of allograft rejection;
these mice even accept xenografts. In other studies, T cells
derived from an allograft-primed mouse were shown to
transfer second-set allograft rejection to an unprimed syngeneic recipient as long as that recipient was grafted with the
same allogeneic tissue (Figure 16-11).
Analysis of the T-cell subpopulations involved in allograft
rejection has implicated both CD4 and CD8 populations.
In one study, mice were injected with monoclonal antibodies
to deplete one or both types of T cells and then the rate of
graft rejection was measured. As shown in Figure 16-12,
removal of the CD8 population alone had no effect on graft
survival, and the graft was rejected at the same rate as in control mice (15 days). Removal of the CD4 T-cell population
alone prolonged graft survival from 15 days to 30 days. However, removal of both CD4 and CD8 T cells resulted in
long-term survival (up to 60 days) of the allografts. This study
indicated that both CD4 and CD8 T cells participated in
rejection and that the collaboration of the two subpopula-

vascularized transplant becomes infiltrated with inflammatory cells. There is decreased vascularization of the transplanted tissue by 7 to 10 days, visible necrosis by 10 days, and
complete rejection by 12 to 14 days.
Immunologic memory is demonstrated when a second
strain-B graft is transferred to a previously engrafted strain-A
mouse. In this case, the anti-graft reaction develops more
quickly, with complete rejection occurring within 5 to 6 days.
This secondary response is called second-set rejection (Figure 16-10c). Specificity can be demonstrated by grafting skin
from an unrelated mouse of strain C at the same time as the
second strain-B graft. Rejection of the strain-C graft proceeds
according to the slower, first-set rejection kinetics, whereas the
strain-B graft is rejected in an accelerated second-set fashion.

Tolerance, Autoimmunity, and Transplantation
between identical twins. Tissues that display significant antigenic differences are histoincompatible and typically induce
an immune response that leads to tissue rejection. Of course,
there are many shades of gray in the degree of histocompatibility between a donor and recipient. The antigens involved
are encoded by more than 40 different loci, but the loci
responsible for the most vigorous allograft rejection reactions are located within the MHC. The organization of the
MHC—called the H-2 complex in mice and the HLA complex in humans—was described in detail in Chapter 8 (see
Figures 8-7 and 8-8). Because the genes in the MHC locus
are closely linked, they are usually inherited as a complete set
from each parent, called a haplotype.
In inbred strains of mice, offspring inherit the same haplotype from each parent, meaning they are homozygous at
the MHC locus. When mice from two different inbred
strains are mated, the F1 progeny each inherit one maternal
and one paternal haplotype (see Figure 8-9). These heterozygous F1 offspring express the MHC type from both parents
(b/k, in Figure 8-10), which means they are tolerant to the
alleles from both haplotypes and can accept grafts from
either parent. However, neither of the parental strains can
accept grafts from the F1 offspring because each parent lacks
one of the F1 haplotypes and will therefore reject these MHC
antigens.
In outbred populations, there is a high degree of heterozygosity at most loci, including the MHC. In matings
between members of an outbred species, there is only a 25%
chance that any two offspring will inherit identical MHC
haplotypes unless the parents share one or more haplotypes.
Therefore, for purposes of organ or bone marrow grafts, it
can be assumed that there is a 25% chance of MHC identity
between any two siblings. With parent-to-child grafts, the
donor and recipient will always have one haplotype in common (50% match), which is why these grafts are so common.
However, in this case, the donor and recipient are still nearly
always mismatched for all or most alleles inherited from the
other parent, providing a target for the immune system.
Role of Blood Group and MHC Antigens
in Graft Tolerance
The most intense graft rejection reactions are due to differences between donor and recipient in ABO blood-group and
MHC antigens. The blood-group antigens are expressed on
RBCs, epithelial cells, and endothelial cells, requiring the
donor and recipient to first be screened for ABO compatibility. If the recipient carries antibodies to any of these antigens,
the transplanted tissue will induce rapid antibody-mediated
lysis of the incompatible donor cells. For this reason, most
transplants are conducted between individuals with a matching ABO blood group.
Next, the MHC compatibility between potential donors
and a recipient is determined. The first choice is usually parents or first-order siblings with at least a partial MHC match,
followed by other family members and even friends. Given
our current success with immunosuppression and immune

tolerance induction protocols, solid organ transplants
between individuals with even a total HLA mismatch can be
successful. The most rigorous testing is conducted in bone
marrow transplants, where at least partial HLA matching is
crucial.
Several tests can be used to determine the HLA compatibility, and the choice is somewhat dependent on the organ
or tissue in question. Molecular assays using sequence-specific
primers to establish which HLA alleles are expressed by the
recipient and potential donors (called tissue typing) has
become more common in recent years, especially in bone
marrow transplantation. Molecular assays provide greater
specificity and higher resolution than assays that characterize
MHC molecules serologically, using antigen-antibody interactions alone, which was standard practice in the past.
The presence of any preformed antibodies against potential donor HLA alloantigens must also be evaluated in the
recipient. We generate antibodies against nonself HLA proteins for a number of reasons, but transplant recipients who
have received prior allografts are especially likely to possess
them. Testing for this is called cross-matching, and is the most
important level of compatibility testing that occurs prior to
solid organ transfer; a positive cross-match means that the
recipient has antibodies against HLA proteins carried by the
donor. The most common method used today is the Luminex
assay, which employs fluorochrome-labeled microbeads
impregnated with specific HLA proteins (Figure 16-13). Each
HLA protein is associated with a fluorochrome of a different
intensity. These HLA-impregnated beads are mixed with
recipient serum, allowing clinicians to determine more precisely which donor specific anti-HLA antibodies are present

The Immune System in Health and Disease

in the recipient prior to transplantation. The importance of
careful cross-matching was shown in a seminal 1969 study,
where up to 80% of kidney transplant patients with a positive
cross-match experienced almost immediate transplant rejection, while only 5% of patients with a negative cross-match
had this outcome.
The MHC makeup of donor and host is not the sole factor
determining tissue acceptance. Even when MHC antigens
are identical, the transplanted tissue can be rejected because
of differences at various other loci, including the minor histocompatibility locus. As described in Chapter 8, the major
histocompatibility antigens are recognized directly by TH
and TC cells, a phenomenon termed alloreactivity. In contrast, minor histocompatibility antigens are recognized only
when peptide fragments are presented in the context of selfMHC molecules. Rejection based on only minor histocompatibility differences is usually less vigorous but can still lead
to graft rejection. Therefore, even in cases of HLA-identical
matches, some degree of immune suppression is usually still
required.
The Sensitization Stage of Graft Rejection
Graft rejection occurs in stages and can be caused by both
humoral and cell-mediated immune responses to alloantigens (primarily, MHC molecules) expressed on cells of the
graft. Antibody-mediated, DTH, and cell-mediated cytotoxicity reactions have all been implicated, but the latter are
primarily credited with orchestrating this response. As we
discuss later, immediate hyperacute rejection is caused primarily by preexisting anti-HLA antibodies. When graft
rejection occurs in the absence of this preexisting immunity,
it can be divided into two stages: (1) a sensitization phase,
which occurs shortly after transplantation when antigenreactive lymphocytes of the recipient proliferate in response
to alloantigens on the graft, and (2) a later effector stage, in
which immune destruction of the graft takes place.
During the sensitization phase, CD4 and CD8 T cells
recognize alloantigens expressed on cells of the foreign graft
and proliferate in response. Both major and minor histocompatibility alloantigens can be recognized. In general, the
response to minor histocompatibility antigens is weak,
although the combined response to several minor differences can be quite vigorous. The response to major histocompatibility antigens involves recognition of either the
donor MHC molecule directly (direct presentation) or recognition of peptides from donor HLA in the cleft of the recipient’s own MHC molecules (indirect presentation).
A host TH cell becomes activated when it interacts with
an APC that both expresses an appropriate antigenic-ligand/
MHC-molecule complex and provides the requisite costimulatory signal. Because DCs are found in most tissues and
constitutively express high levels of class II MHC molecules,
activated allogeneic donor DCs can mediate direct presentation in grafts or in the draining lymph node, to which they
can sometimes migrate. APCs of host origin can also migrate
into a graft and endocytose the foreign alloantigens (both

major and minor histocompatibility molecules), where they
become activated and present alloantigens indirectly as processed peptides bound to self-MHC molecules. The crosspresentation ability of DCs (see Chapter 8) also allows them
to present endocytic antigens in the context of class I MHC
molecules to CD8 T cells, which can then participate in
allograft rejection. In addition to DCs, other cell types have
been implicated in alloantigen presentation and immune
activation leading to graft rejection, including Langerhans
cells and endothelial cells lining the blood vessels. Both of
these cell types express class I and class II MHC antigens.
However, as we know from Chapter 11, T cells that
respond to antigen via the TCR in the absence of costimulation or danger signals can become tolerant. This may help to
explain a long-standing clinical observation: transfusion of
donor blood into a graft recipient prior to transplantation
can facilitate acceptance of a subsequent graft from that
donor. This suggests that exposure to donor cells in this nonactivating context induced tolerance to donor alloantigens.
Newer immunomodulation protocols based on this observation, as well as related experimental studies, are currently
underway to design techniques to effectively induce donorspecific tolerance prior to engraftment.
Effector Stage of Graft Rejection
A variety of mechanisms participate in the effector stage of
allograft rejection (Figure 16-14). The most common are cellmediated reactions; less common mechanisms (except during hyperacute rejection) are antibody-mediated complement
lysis and destruction by ADCC. The hallmark of graft rejection involving cell-mediated reactions is an influx of immune
cells into the graft. Among these are T cells, especially CD4,
and APCs, often macrophages. Histologically, the infiltration
in many cases resembles that seen during a DTH response, in
which cytokines produced by T cells promote inflammatory
cell infiltration (see Figure 15-14). Although probably less
important, recognition by host CD8 T cells of either foreign
class I alloantigens on the graft or alloantigenic peptides
cross-presented in the context of class I MHC by DCs can
lead to CTL-mediated killing.
In each of these effector mechanisms, cytokines secreted
by TH cells play a central role. For example, IL-2 and IFN-
produced by TH1 cells have been shown to be important
mediators of graft rejection. These two cytokines promote
T-cell proliferation (including CTLs), DTH responses, and
the synthesis of IgG by B cells, with resulting complement
activation. A number of cytokines that encourage the
expression of MHC class I and class II molecules (e.g., the
interferons and TNFs) increase during graft rejection episodes, inducing a variety of cell types within the graft to
increase surface expression of these proteins. Many of the
cytokines most closely associated with TH2 and TH17 cells
have also been implicated in graft rejection. Elevations in
IL-4, -5, and -13, responsible for B-cell activation and eosinophil accumulation in allografts, and in IL-17, have all been
linked to transplant rejection. Recent studies showing that

neutralization of IL-17 could extend the survival of cardiac
allografts in the mouse have generated much interest in this
cytokine and in the role of TH17 cells in graft rejection.
Finally, antibody-mediated rejection (AMR), although
less frequent, is still a major issue in clinical transplantation.
These antibodies are often directed against donor HLA molecules or endothelial antigens. The hallmarks of this response,
which is dependent on T-cell maintenance of these alloreactive B cells, are the activation of complement and deposition
of C4d, especially among endothelial cells lining graft capillaries. AMR, although most associated with the earliest
stages of rejection, can occur at any time during the clinical
course of allograft rejection.

Graft Rejection Follows a Predictable
Clinical Course
Graft rejection reactions, although somewhat variable in
their time courses depending on the type of tissue transferred and the immune response involved, follow a fairly
predictable course. Hyperacute rejection reactions typically
occur within the first 24 hours after transplantation, acute
rejection reactions usually begin in the first few weeks after
transplantation, and chronic rejection reactions can occur
from months to years after transplantation. Careful crossmatching can avoid most cases of hyperacute rejection. Current immunosuppressive agents have greatly advanced our

isting antibodies that cross-react with common antigens of
the donor species that are not present in the recipient species.

Hyperacute Rejection by Preexisting Antibodies
In rare instances, a transplant is rejected so quickly that the
grafted tissue never becomes vascularized. These hyperacute
reactions are caused by preexisting host serum antibodies
specific for antigens of the graft and have the greatest impact
in highly vascularized grafts (such as kidney and heart).
Preexisting recipient antibodies bind to HLA antigens on the
endothelial cells of the graft. These antigen-antibody complexes activate the complement system and result in an
intense accumulation of neutrophils. The ensuing inflammatory reaction causes endothelial damage and obstructing
blood clots within the capillaries, preventing vascularization
of the graft (Figure 16-15).
Several mechanisms can account for the presence of preexisting antibodies specific for allogeneic MHC antigens.
These include repeated blood transfusions that induced antibodies to MHC antigens expressed on allogeneic WBCs in
the blood; repeated pregnancies, in which women develop
antibodies against paternal alloantigens of the fetus; exposure
to infectious agents, which can elicit MHC cross-reactive
antibodies; or a previous transplant, which induced high
levels of antibodies to the allogeneic MHC antigens present
in that graft. In some cases, preexisting antibodies specific for
blood-group antigens may also be present and can mediate
hyperacute rejection. However, with careful cross-matching
and ABO blood-group typing, many instances of hyperacute
rejection can be avoided. Xenotransplants (see below) are
also often rejected in a hyperacute manner because of preex-

Acute Rejection Mediated by T-Cell Responses
Cell-mediated allograft rejection manifests as an acute rejection of the graft beginning about 7 to 10 days after transplantation (see Figure 16-10b). Histopathologic examination reveals
a massive infiltration of macrophages and lymphocytes at the
site of tissue destruction, suggestive of TH-cell activation and
proliferation. Acute graft rejection occurs by the mechanisms
described for the effector stage of graft rejection (see Figure 16-14). Acute AMR may also be involved during this stage;
it is the suggested cause of 20% to 30% of acute rejection cases.
Chronic Rejection Phase
Chronic rejection reactions develop months or years after acute
rejection reactions have subsided. The mechanisms include
both humoral and cell-mediated responses by the recipient.
Although immunosuppressive drugs and advanced tissue-typing
techniques have dramatically increased survival of allografts
during the first years, little progress has been made in long-term
survival. In data collected in the United States as of 2008, 1-year
kidney graft survival rates approached 97%. However, even in
cases of a living donor—the most ideal scenario—10-year survival rates were only 60% (based on procedures performed in
2000). Immunosuppressive drugs usually do little to manage
chronic rejection, which not infrequently necessitates another
transplant. In up to 60% of cases in which there is some form of
chronic allograft dysfunction, antidonor antibodies can be found
in the recipient, suggesting that in addition to cell-mediated
responses, AMR may also be involved in chronic rejection.

Tolerance, Autoimmunity, and Transplantation

Allogeneic transplantation always requires some degree of
immunosuppression if the transplant is to survive. Most
immunosuppressive treatments are nonspecific, resulting in
generalized suppression of responses to all antigens, not just
those of the allograft. This places the recipient at increased
risk of infection and cancer. In fact, infection is the most
common cause of transplant-related death. Many immunosuppressive measures slow the proliferation of activated lymphocytes, thus affecting any rapidly dividing nonimmune
cells (e.g., gut epithelial cells or bone marrow hematopoietic
stem cells), and leading to serious or even life-threatening
complications. Patients on long-term immunosuppressive
therapy are also at increased risk of hypertension and metabolic bone disease. Fine-tuning of their immunosuppressive
cocktail, and eventual weaning off these drugs, is an ongoing
process for most, if not all, transplant recipients.
Total Lymphoid Irradiation to Eliminate
Lymphocytes
Because lymphocytes are extremely sensitive to x-rays,
x-irradiation can be used to eliminate them in the transplant
recipient just before grafting. Although not a part of most
immunosuppressive regimens, this is often used in bone marrow transplantation or to treat graft-versus-host disease
(GVHD), in which the graft rejects the host. In total lymphoid
irradiation, the recipient receives multiple x-ray exposures to
the thymus, spleen, and lymph nodes before the transplant,
and the recipient is engrafted in this immunosuppressed state.
Because the bone marrow is not x-irradiated, lymphoid stem
cells proliferate and renew the population of recirculating
lymphocytes. These newly formed lymphocytes appear to be
more likely to become tolerant to the antigens of the graft.
Generalized Immunosuppressive Therapy
In 1959, Robert Schwartz and William Dameshek reported
that treatment with 6-mercaptopurine suppressed immune
responses in animal models. Joseph Murray and colleagues
then screened a number of its chemical analogues for use in
human transplantation. One, azathioprine, when used in
combination with corticosteroids, dramatically increased survival of allografts. Murray received a Nobel prize in 1991 for
this clinical advance, and the developers of the drug, Gertrude
Elion and George Hitchings, received the Nobel prize in 1987.
Azathioprine (Imuran) is a potent mitotic inhibitor often
given just before and after transplantation to diminish both
B- and T-cell proliferation. Other mitotic inhibitors that are
sometimes used in conjunction with immunosuppressive
agents are cyclophosphamide and methotrexate. Cyclophosphamide is an alkylating agent that inserts into the DNA helix
and becomes cross-linked, leading to disruption of the DNA
chain. It is especially effective against rapidly dividing cells and
is therefore sometimes given at the time of grafting to block
T-cell proliferation. Methotrexate acts as a folic-acid antagonist

CHAPTER 16

to block purine biosynthesis. Because mitotic inhibitors act on
all rapidly dividing cells, they cause significant side effects,
especially affecting the gut and liver, in addition to their target,
bone marrow-derived cells. Most often, these mitotic inhibitors are combined with immunosuppressive drugs such as
corticosteroids (e.g., prednisone and dexamethasone). These
potent anti-inflammatory agents exert their effects at many
levels of the immune response and therefore help prevent acute
episodes of graft rejection.
More specific immune suppression became possible with
the development of several fungal metabolites, including
cyclosporin A (CsA), FK506 (tacrolimus), and rapamycin (also
known as sirolimus). Although chemically unrelated, these
exert similar effects, blocking the activation and proliferation
of resting T cells. Some of these also prevent transcription of
several genes encoding important T-cell activation molecules,
such as IL-2 and the high-affinity IL-2 receptor (IL-2R). By
inhibiting TH-cell proliferation and cytokine expression, these
drugs reduce the subsequent activation of various effector
populations involved in graft rejection, making them a mainstay in heart, liver, kidney, and bone marrow transplantation.
In one study of 209 kidney transplants from deceased donors,
the 1-year survival rate was 80% among recipients receiving
CsA and 64% among those receiving other immunosuppressive treatments. Similar results have been obtained with liver
transplants (Figure 16-16). Despite these impressive results,
CsA does have some side effects, most notably toxicity to the
kidneys. FK506 and rapamycin are 10 to 100 times more
potent immunosuppressants than CsA and therefore can be
administered at lower doses and with fewer side effects.

The Immune System in Health and Disease

Specific Immunosuppressive Therapy
The ideal immunosuppressant would be antigen-specific,
inhibiting the immune response to the alloantigens present in
the graft while preserving the recipient’s ability to respond to
other foreign antigens. Although this goal has not yet been
achieved, several more targeted immunosuppressive agents
have been developed. Most involve the use of monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) or soluble ligands that bind specific cell-surface
molecules. One limitation of most first-generation mAbs came
from their origin in animals. Recipients of these frequently
developed an immune response to the nonhuman epitopes,
rapidly clearing the mAbs from the body. This limitation has
been overcome by the construction of humanized mAbs and
mouse-human chimeric antibodies (see Chapter 20).
Many different mAbs have been tested in transplantation
settings, and the majority work by either depleting the recipient of a particular cell population or by blocking a key step in
immune signaling. Antithymocyte globulin (ATG), prepared
from animals exposed to human lymphocytes, can be used to
deplete lymphocytes in recipients prior to transplantation, but
has significant side effects. A more subset-specific strategy uses
a mAb to the CD3 molecule of the TCR, called OKT3, and
rapidly depletes mature T cells from the circulation. This
depletion appears to be caused by binding of antibody-coated
T cells to Fc receptors on phagocytic cells, which then phagocytose and clear the T cells from the circulation. In a further
refinement of this strategy, a cytotoxic agent such as diphtheria
toxin is coupled with the mAb. Antibody-bound cells then
internalize the toxin and die. Another technique uses mAbs
specific for the high-affinity IL-2 receptor CD25 (Basiliximab).
Since this receptor is expressed only on activated T cells, this
treatment specifically blocks proliferation of T cells activated in
(a)

response to the alloantigens of the graft. However, since TREG
cells also express CD25 and may aid in alloantigen tolerance,
this strategy may have drawbacks. More recently, a mAb
against CD20 (Rituximab) has been used to deplete mature B
cells and is aimed at suppressing AMR responses. Finally, in
cases of bone marrow transplantation, mAbs against T-cellspecific markers have been used to pretreat the donor’s bone
marrow to destroy immunocompetent T cells that may react
with the recipient tissues, causing GVHD (described below).
Because cytokines appear to play an important role in
allograft rejection, these compounds can also be specifically
targeted. Animal studies have explored the use of mAbs specific for the cytokines implicated in transplant rejection, particularly TNF-, IFN-, and IL-2. In mice, anti-TNF- mAbs
prolong bone marrow transplants and reduce the incidence of
GVHD. Antibodies to IFN- and to IL-2 have each been
reported in some cases to prolong cardiac transplants in rats.
As described in Chapter 11, TH-cell activation requires a
costimulatory signal in addition to the signal mediated by the
TCR. The interaction between CD80/86 on the membrane of
APCs and the CD28 or CTLA-4 molecule on T cells provides
one such signal (see Figure 11-3). Without this costimulatory
signal, antigen-activated T cells become anergic (see Figure 11-4). CD28 is expressed on both resting and activated
T cells, while CTLA-4 is expressed only on activated T cells
and binds CD80/86 with a 20-fold-higher affinity. In mice, D.
J. Lenschow, J. A. Bluestone, and colleagues demonstrated
prolonged graft survival by blocking CD80/86 signaling with
a soluble fusion protein consisting of the extracellular domain
of CTLA-4 fused to human IgG1 heavy chain (called CTLA4Ig). This new drug, belatacept, was shown to induce anergy
in T cells directed against the grafted tissue and has been

both the interaction of the TCR with its ligand and the reaction of
costimulatory receptors with their ligands (a). In (b), contact
between one of the costimulatory receptors, CD28 on the T cell,

and its ligand, CD80/86 on the APC, is blocked by reaction of
CD80/86 with the soluble ligand CTLA-4Ig. The CTLA-4 is coupled
to an Ig H chain, which slows its clearance from the circulation. This
process specifically suppresses graft rejection without inhibiting
the immune response to other antigens. [© 2013 W. H. Freeman and

approved by the FDA for prevention of organ rejection in
adult kidney transplant patients (Figure 16-17).
Some of the treatments used to suppress transplant rejection in clinical settings are summarized in Figure 16-18,
along with their sites of action.

Immune Tolerance to Allografts Is Favored
in Certain Instances
Sometimes, an allograft may be accepted with little or no use
of immunosuppressive drugs. Obviously, with tissues that lack
alloantigens (e.g., cartilage or heart valves), no immunologic
barrier to transplantation exists. Acceptance of an allograft
can be favored in one of two situations: when cells or tissue are
grafted to a so-called privileged site that is sequestered from
immune system surveillance, or when a state of tolerance has
been induced biologically, usually by previous exposure to the

Cells and Cytokines Associated with Graft Tolerance
There is now significant evidence that FoxP3-expressing
TREG cells play a role in transplantation tolerance. In clinical
operational tolerance, where the graft survives despite the
removal of all immunosuppressive therapy, there is an
increase in the number of TREG cells in the circulation and in
the graft. These cells are believed to inhibit alloreactive cells
using a combination of direct contact and expression of
immunosuppressive cytokines, such as TGF-, IL-10, and
IL-35. To date, difficulties identifying and isolating this
population of T cells have limited their use as a treatment for
inducing transplant tolerance. However, strategies that use
existing or induced TREG cells to limit graft rejection, especially in GVHD, are an active area of research.
Immunologically Privileged Sites
An allograft placed in an immunologically privileged site, or
an area without significant immune cell access (e.g., the
anterior chamber of the eye, cornea, uterus, testes, and
brain), is less likely to experience rejection. Each of these
sites is characterized by an absence of lymphatic vessels, and
sometimes also blood vessels. Consequently, the alloantigens
of the graft are not able to sensitize the recipient’s lymphocytes, and the graft has an increased likelihood of acceptance
even when HLA antigens are not matched. The privileged
status of the cornea has allowed corneal transplants to be
highly successful. Ironically, the successful transplantation
of allogeneic pancreatic islet cells into the thymus in a rat
model of diabetes suggests that the thymus may also be a
unique type of immunologically privileged site.
Immunologically privileged sites fail to induce an
immune response because they are effectively sequestered
from the cells of the immune system. This suggests the possibility of physically sequestering grafted cells. In one
study, pancreatic islet cells were encapsulated in semipermeable membranes and then transplanted into diabetic
mice. The islet cells survived and produced insulin. The
transplanted cells were not rejected, because the recipient’s
immune cells could not penetrate the membrane. This
novel transplant method may have application for treatment of human diabetics.
Inducing Transplantation Tolerance
Methods for inducing tolerance to allow acceptance of
allografts have been studied extensively in animal models,
and some of the discoveries have now been applied to
humans. The current favorite involves the induction of a
state of mixed hematopoietic chimerism, where donor and
recipient hematopoietic cells coexist in the host prior to
transplantation. The seed for this strategy originated from

Box 16-3

CLASSIC EXPERIMENT

Early Life Exposure to Antigens Favors Tolerance Induction
In 1945, Ray Owen, an immunologist
working at the California Institute of Technology, reported a novel observation in
cattle. His discovery would advance our
understanding of immune tolerance and
provide grist for many transplant immunologists who followed in his footsteps. He
noticed that nonidentical or dizygotic cattle twins retained the ability to accept cells
or tissue from their genetically distinct sibling throughout their lives. This was not
true for the nonidentical twins of other
mammalian species that did not share a
placenta in utero. In cattle, the shared placenta allowed free blood circulation from
one twin to the other throughout the
embryonic and fetal period. Although the
twins may have inherited distinct paternal
and maternal antigens, they did not recognize those of their placental partner as foreign and could therefore later accept grafts
from them. He hypothesized that exposure
to the alloantigens of their placental sibling
during this early stage of life somehow

induced a lifelong state of immune tolerance to these antigens; in other words,
these alloantigens were treated as self.
In 1953, Owen’s observations were
extended in a seminal paper by Rupert
Billingham, Leslie Brent, and Peter Medawar.
They showed that inoculation of fetal mice
with cells from a genetically distinct donor
mouse strain led to subsequent acceptance of skin grafts from donor mice of the
same strain. This and other work led to the
hypothesis that fetal development is an
immunologically privileged period, during
which exposure to an antigen induces tolerance to that antigen later in life. Peter
Medawar shared the 1960 Nobel Prize in
Physiology or Medicine with Sir Frank MacFarlane Burnet, for their shared work in the
discoveries that led to our understanding
of acquired immunological tolerance.
Although no experimental data are
available to demonstrate such specific
tolerance in humans, there is anecdotal
evidence. For example, transplants in very

animal studies and observations in humans. For instance,
transplant recipients who underwent total myeloablative
therapy followed by donor bone marrow transfer prior to
receiving a solid organ from the same donor displayed
enhanced tolerance for the solid organ graft. A modified
protocol involving a less intense non-myeloablative procedure followed by bone marrow transfer resulted in mixed
chimerism that, even when quite transient, was still associated with improved graft outcomes. The mechanism for this
induction of tolerance is still unclear; both central deletion
of alloreactive T cells and an enhancement of immune suppression by TREG cells are hypothesized.

Some Organs Are More Amenable to Clinical
Transplantation Than Others
For a number of illnesses, a transplant is the only means of
therapy. Figure 16-19 summarizes the major organ and
cell transplants being performed today. Certain combinations of organs, such as heart and lung or kidney and
pancreas, are being transplanted simultaneously with
increasing frequency.
Since the first kidney transplant was performed in the
1950s, it is estimated that over 500,000 kidneys have been

young children show a slightly higher success rate than those in older individuals,
suggesting that early life exposure to antigens may bias toward tolerance induction
in humans as well. There are also clinical
examples in adults where allografts mismatched at a single HLA locus are
accepted with little or no immune suppression. When this mismatched antigen
happens to be expressed by the transplant recipient’s mother, it is possible that
perinatal exposure to this maternal antigen induced subsequent tolerance to the
alloantigen. Because human maternal
cells do not normally cross the placental
barrier, the mechanism for such specific
tolerance to noninherited maternal antigens is unknown.

transplanted worldwide. The next most frequently transplanted solid organ is the liver, followed by the heart, the
lung, and the pancreas. In 2011, over 28,000 solid organ
transplants were performed in the United States, in addition
to more than 46,000 corneal tissue grafts. Although the
clinical outcomes have improved considerably in the past
few years, major obstacles still exist. Immunosuppressive
drugs greatly increase the short-term survival of the transplant, but medical problems arise from their use and chronic
rejection remains a lingering problem. The need for additional transplants after rejection exacerbates the shortage of
organs that is a major obstacle to the widespread use of
transplantation. Research on artificial organs continues, but
there are no reports of universal long-term successes. This
makes the idea of looking outside our species more compelling to some (see Clinical Focus Box 16-4).
The frequency with which a given organ or tissue is transplanted depends on a number of factors, including alternative treatment options, organ availability, and the level of
difficulty of the procedure. Several factors contribute to the
kidney being the most commonly transplanted organ. Many
common diseases (e.g., diabetes) result in kidney failure that
can be alleviated by transplantation. Because kidneys come
in pairs and we can survive with only one, this organ is

available from living as well as deceased donors. In most
transplant situations, transfer from a living donor affords
enhanced chances of graft survival. Surgical procedures for
kidney transfer are also simpler than for the liver or heart.
Because many transplants of this type have been conducted
for many years, patient-care procedures and effective immunosuppressive regimens are well established. Matching of
blood and histocompatibility groups presents no special
problems, and transplants can even be conducted across
significant mismatches. This contrasts with bone marrow
transplants, which must be at least partially matched. The
major problems faced by patients waiting for a kidney are
the shortage of organs and the increasing number of sensitized recipients. The latter results from rejection of a first
transplant, which leaves the recipient sensitized to the alloantigens in that graft. As with all nonidentical transplants, it
is typically necessary to maintain kidney transplant patients
on some form of immunosuppression for their entire lives.
Unfortunately, this gives rise to complications, including
risks of cancer and infection, as well as other side effects
such as hypertension and metabolic bone disease.

After the kidney, bone marrow is the most frequent
transplant. This procedure is increasingly used to treat
hematologic diseases, including leukemia, lymphoma, and
immunodeficiencies, especially severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID; see Chapter 18). Although the supply of
bone marrow, which is a renewing resource, is less of a
problem than is the supply of kidneys, finding a matched
donor is a major obstacle. However, current tissue typing
techniques can quickly identify donors with at least partial
HLA matches. Bone marrow transplant recipients are typically immunologically suppressed before transfer, making
graft rejection rare. However, the presence of foreign
immunocompetent cells means that GVHD is a real risk,
although the use of immunosuppressive drugs and pretreatment to deplete T cells from the graft have improved
outcomes.
Perhaps the most dramatic forms of transplantation involve
the transfer of heart, lung, or both: situations where the
recipient must be kept alive via artificial means during surgery. The human heart can remain viable for a limited time in
ice-cold buffer solutions, which delay tissue damage. However,

CLINICAL FOCUS

Is There a Clinical Future for Xenotransplantation?
Unless organ

donations increase
drastically, most of the over 116,000 U.S.
patients still on the waiting list for a transplant at the end of 2012 will not receive
one. In fact, fewer than 30,000 donor organs
will become available in time to save these
waiting patients. The disparity in numbers
of individuals on a waiting list for a transplant and the number of available organs
grows every year, making it increasingly
unlikely that human organs can fill this
need. One solution to this shortfall is to utilize animal organs, a process called xenotransplantation. Clinical attempts at using
nonhuman primates as donors led to some
short-term success, including function of a
baboon liver for 70 days and a chimpanzee
kidney for 9 months in human recipients.
Although there are advantages in the phylogenetic similarity between primate species, the use of nonhuman primates as
organ donors has several important disadvantages. This similarity carries with it elevated risk in terms of the transfer of
pathogenic viruses, not to mention the
impracticalities and ethical concerns that
arise in the use of these close cousins.
The use of pigs to supply organs for
humans has been under serious consideration for many years. Pigs breed rapidly,
have large litters, can be housed in pathogen-free environments, and share considerable anatomic and physiologic similarity
with humans. In fact, pigs have served as
donors of cardiac valves for humans for
years. However, balancing the advantages
of pig donors are several serious difficulties.
For example, if a pig kidney were implanted
into a human by techniques standard for
human transplants, it would likely fail in a
rapid and dramatic fashion due to hyperacute rejection. This antibody-mediated
rejection is due to the presence on the pig

cells (and cells of most mammals except
humans and the highest nonhuman primates) of a disaccharide antigen called
galactosyl--1,3-galactose (Gal1,3Gal). The
presence of this antigen on many microorganisms means that nearly everyone has
been exposed and has formed antibodies
against it. The preexisting antibodies crossreact with pig cells, which are then lysed
rapidly by complement. The absence of
human regulators of complement activity
on the pig cells, including human decay
accelerating factor (DAF) and human membrane cofactor protein (MCP), intensifies the
complement lysis cycle (see Chapter 6 for
descriptions of DAF and MCP).
How can this major obstacle be circumvented? Strategies for absorbing the antibodies from the circulation on solid
supports and the use of soluble gal-gal
disaccharides to block antibody reactions
were both tested. A more elegant solution
involved genetically engineered pigs in
which the gene for the enzyme responsible for the addition of Gal1,3Gal to pig
proteins was knocked out. These galactosyl
transferase gene knockout (GalT-KO) pigs
have been used as heart or kidney donors
for baboons in experimental systems. K.
Kuwaki and colleagues transplanted GalT-KO
pig hearts into baboons immunosuppressed
with antithymocyte globulin and an antiCD154 monoclonal antibody (the CD40
ligand found mostly on T cells) and then
maintained with commonly used immunosuppressive drugs. The mean survival
time was 92 days, and one GalT-KO pig
heart transplant survived in a baboon for
179 days. K. Yamada and coworkers demonstrated kidney function in recipients of
GalT-KO pig kidneys for up to 83 days using
a regimen of simultaneous thymus transplant in an attempt to establish tolerance in

eventually lack of oxygen (ischemia) and the resulting deprivation of ATP lead to irreversible organ death. The surgical
methods for implanting a heart have been available since the
first heart transplant was carried out in 1964 in South Africa
by Dr. Christian Barnard. Today, the 1-year survival rate for

the baboon recipients. Although these studies were not conclusive, some promising
results have encouraged further exploration
of the use of pigs for xenotransplantation in
a clinical setting.
Even if all issues of antigenic difference
were resolved, additional concerns remain
for those considering pigs as a source of
transplanted tissue. Pig endogenous retroviruses introduced into humans as a result
of xenotransplantation could cause significant disease. Opponents of xenotransplantation raise the specter of another HIV-type
epidemic resulting from human infection
by a new animal retrovirus. Continuing
work on development of pigs free of
endogenous pig retroviruses could reduce
the possibility of this bleak outcome.
Will we see the use of pig kidneys in
humans in the near future? The increasing
demand for organs is driving the commercial development of colonies of pigs suitable for such purposes. Although kidneys
are the most sought-after organ at present,
other organs and cells from the specially
bred and engineered animals will find use if
they are proven to be safe and effective. A
statement issued in 2000 from the American
Society of Transplantation and the American
Society of Transplant Surgeons endorses the
use of xenotransplants if certain conditions
are met, including the demonstration of
feasibility in a nonhuman primate model,
proven benefit to the patient, and lack of
infectious disease risk. Although certain barriers remain to the clinical use of xenotransplants, serious efforts are in motion to
overcome these difficulties.

heart transplants has climbed to greater than 80%. Brain-dead
accident victims with an intact circulatory system and a functioning heart are the typical source of these organs. HLA
matching is often not possible because of the limited supply of
these organs and the urgency of the procedure.

Tolerance, Autoimmunity, and Transplantation
The liver is important because it clears and detoxifies
substances in the body. Malfunction of this organ can be
caused by viral diseases (e.g., hepatitis) or exposure to harmful chemicals (e.g., chronic alcoholism), although most liver
transplants are actually performed to correct congenital
abnormalities. This organ has a complicated circulatory network, posing some unique technical challenges. However, its
large size also presents opportunity; the liver from a single
donor can often be split and given to at least two different
recipients.
One of the more common diseases in the United States is
diabetes mellitus. This disease is caused by malfunction of
insulin-producing islet cells in the pancreas. Newer protocols that avoid whole-organ transfer involve harvesting
donor islet cells and perfusing them into the recipient’s liver,
where they become permanently established in the liver
sinusoids. Initial results indicate that 53% of recipients are
insulin independent after such a transplant, some for up to
2 years. Several factors favor survival of functioning pancreatic cells, the most important being the condition of the islet
cells used for implantation.

Most skin transplants are conducted with autologous tissue. However, after severe burns, foreign skin thawed from
frozen deposits may also be used. These grafts generally act as
biologic dressings because the cellular elements are no longer
viable and the graft does not grow in the new host. True allogeneic skin grafting using fresh viable donor skin has been
undertaken, but rejection is a significant issue that must be
managed with aggressive immunosuppressive therapy, which
unfortunately also increases the already high infection risk.
This list of commonly transplanted tissue is in no way
comprehensive, and will surely expand with time. Improved
procedures for inducing tolerance and controlling rejection,
along with any advances in future organ availability, would
add significantly to this list. For instance, the recent use of
intracerebral neural cell grafts has restored function in victims of Parkinson’s disease. In studies conducted thus far, the
source of neural donor cells was human embryos; the possibility of using those from other animal species is being tested.
Likewise, the transfer of composite tissues (e.g., whole digit,
limb, and even facial transplants) is still relatively rare and
extremely complicated, but advances are being made.

A major task of the immune system is to distinguish self
from nonself. Failure to do so results in immune attacks
against cells and organs of the host with the possible onset
of autoimmune disease.
Mechanisms to prevent self-reactivity (i.e., tolerance)
operate at several levels. Central tolerance serves to delete
self-reactive T or B lymphocytes; peripheral tolerance
inactivates or regulates self-reactive lymphocytes that survive the initial screening process.
Human autoimmune diseases can be divided into organspecific and systemic diseases. The organ-specific diseases
involve an autoimmune response directed primarily
against a single organ or gland. The systemic diseases are
directed against a broad spectrum of tissues.
There are both spontaneous and experimental animal
models for autoimmune diseases. Spontaneous autoimmune diseases result from genetic defects, whereas experimental animal models have been developed by immunizing
animals with self antigens in the presence of adjuvant.
There is evidence for genetic and environmental influences
on autoimmunity. In particular, certain alleles of MHC
have been strongly linked to autoimmunity. In addition,
defects in many different genes involved in immunity can
predispose individuals to autoimmune disease. However,
environmental factors, including microflora and infection,
can also have impacts on autoimmune susceptibility.
CD4 rather than CD8 T cells are most associated with
autoimmunity. There is evidence for both TH1 and TH17
cells in the development of autoimmunity, depending on
the disease in question.

■

■

■

A variety of mechanisms have been proposed for induction of autoimmunity, including release of sequestered
antigens, molecular mimicry, and polyclonal stimulation
of lymphocytes. Evidence exists for each of these mechanisms, reflecting the many different pathways leading to
autoimmune reactions.
Current therapies for autoimmune diseases include treatment with generally immunosuppressive drugs as well as
treatments that inhibit specific cell types or pathways,
such as B cells, T cells, adhesion molecules, costimulation,
and TH17 cells. Strategies aimed at enhancement of TREG
cells, induction of tolerance, and antigen-specific targeting are also under development.
Graft rejection is an immunologic response displaying the
attributes of specificity, memory, and self-nonself recognition. There are three major types of rejection reactions:
■

Hyperacute rejection, mediated by preexisting host
antibodies against graft antigens

■

Acute graft rejection, in which TH cells and/or CTLs
mediate tissue damage

■

Chronic rejection, which involves both cellular and
humoral immune components

■

The immune response to tissue antigens encoded within
the major histocompatibility complex is the strongest
force in rejection.

■

The match between a recipient and potential graft donors
is assessed by typing blood-group antigens and MHC
antigens, and evaluating existing anti-donor antibodies
(cross-matching).

■

The process of graft rejection can be divided into a
sensitization stage, in which T cells are stimulated, and an
effector stage, in which they attack the graft.

■

In most clinical situations, graft rejection is suppressed by
nonspecific immunosuppressive agents or by total
lymphoid x-irradiation.
Experimental approaches using monoclonal antibodies
offer the possibility of more specific immunosuppression.
These antibodies may act by:
■ Depleting certain populations of reactive cells
■ Blocking
TCR engagement or interfering with
costimulation
■ Inhibiting the trafficking of certain cell types
■ Interfering with specific cytokine signaling

and transplants in these sites may not be rejected despite
genetic mismatch between donor and recipient.
Specific tolerance to alloantigens can be induced by exposure to these antigens in utero or as a neonate. In some
cases, prior exposure of adults to alloantigens in the form
of hematopoietic cells, creating a state of mixed chimerism, can favor later success of grafts expressing these
same alloantigens.
Of all the organs or cell types amenable to transplantation,
kidney transplants are the most common, and this organ
is in the greatest demand.
A major complication in bone marrow transplantation is
GVHD, mediated by the lymphocytes contained within
the donor marrow that target the recipient’s cells.
The critical shortage of organs available for transplantation may be solved in the future by using organs from
nonhuman species (xenotransplants).

Infectious Diseases
and Vaccines

S

urviving infectious disease outbreaks was one of
the primary drivers for our earliest forays into the
study of immunology. This led to the development
and use of rudimentary vaccines even before we
understood how a vaccine could induce protective
immunity (see Chapter 1). Since those early vaccination
trials of Edward Jenner and Louis Pasteur, vaccines have
been developed for many diseases that were once major
afflictions of humankind. For example, the incidence of
diphtheria, measles, mumps, pertussis (whooping cough),
rubella (German measles), poliomyelitis, and tetanus,
which once collectively claimed the lives of millions, has
declined dramatically as vaccination has become more
common. Clearly, vaccination is a cost-effective weapon
for disease prevention, and yet the need for safe and
effective vaccines for many life-threatening infectious
diseases remains.
These and other public health concerns led to the
development of agencies to help organize the
accumulating data concerning infectious disease, such as
the World Health Organization (WHO) and the U.S.based Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).
These organizations monitor public health and disease,
guide health care policy discussions, respond to sudden
infectious disease outbreaks, and report regularly on their
findings. Although the local and international
expenditures on these practices are questioned at times,
there is no doubt that these and present-day biomedical
advances have led us to an age in which rapid and often
effective response to sudden infectious disease outbreaks
is commonplace. It has also allowed us to better
appreciate the conditions and policies that can limit
outbreaks of infectious disease.
Although vaccination or naturally acquired protective
immunity can provide critical defense against many
pathogens, infectious diseases still cause the death of
millions each year. Although the number varies greatly by
region, about 25% of deaths worldwide are associated
with communicable diseases, which kill an estimated
11 million to 12 million people each year (Figure 17-1).
Sanitation, antibiotics, and vaccination have reduced the
impact of infectious disease, but infections still account

spreading at an alarming rate in developing as well as in
industrialized countries. In certain instances, a common
infectious agent has become associated with a new
disease. Such is the case for the recently identified
disease necrotizing fasciitis, caused by the so-called
flesh-eating strain of Streptococcus pyogenes, a bacterium
most commonly associated with the now rare disease
scarlet fever.
In this chapter, the concepts of immunity described
throughout the text are applied to selected infectious
diseases caused by the four main types of pathogens
(viruses, bacteria, fungi, and parasites). We focus on
particular infectious diseases that affect large numbers of
people, that illustrate specific immune concepts, and that
use novel strategies to subvert the immune response, as
well as some diseases that have warranted recent
headlines. The chapter concludes with a section on
vaccines, divided by the type of vaccine design being
applied and including examples of specific pathogens that
have been successfully targeted using these strategies.

The Importance of Barriers to
Infection and the Innate Response
First and foremost, in order for a pathogen to establish an
infection in a susceptible host, it must breach physical and
chemical barriers. One of the first and most important of
these barriers consists of the epithelial surfaces of the skin
and the lining of the gut. The difficulty of penetrating these
surfaces ensures that most pathogens never gain productive
entry into the host. In addition, the epithelia produce chemicals that are useful in preventing infection. The secretion of
gastric enzymes by specialized epithelial cells lowers the pH
of the stomach and upper gastrointestinal tract, and other

specialized cells in the gut produce antibacterial peptides. In
addition, normal commensal flora present at mucosal surfaces (the gastrointestinal, genitourinary, and respiratory
tracts) can competitively inhibit the binding of pathogens to
host cells. When pathogen dose and virulence are minimal,
these barriers can often block productive infection altogether.
Interventions that introduce barriers to infection in intermediate hosts can be used as an indirect strategy to disrupt
the cycle of infectious disease in humans. For example, many
pathogens make use of arthropod vectors, such as the mosquito, for parts of their life cycle and as vehicles for transmission to humans. Very recent studies in Dengue virus,
transmitted by the bite of an infected mosquito and the cause
of an often fatal hemorrhagic fever in humans, suggest that
it may be possible to engineer mosquitoes that are resistant
to infection with the virus. When these engineered mosquitoes were released into the wild, they began to supplant the
wild-type, virus-susceptible mosquito population, suggesting that they may have the potential to break the cycle of
transmission. This and other exciting new avenues of
research that target animal disease vectors could advance
infectious disease eradication without the requirement to
intervene with the human immune response. Of course, this
strategy is not a possibility with most infectious diseases, for
which there is no animal vector.
When the basic human barriers to infection are breached,
more directed innate immune responses come into play at or
near the site of infection. These early responses are often tailored to the type of pathogen, using molecular pattern recognition receptors (see Chapter 5). Some bacteria produce
endotoxins such as lipopolysaccharide (LPS), which stimulate
macrophages or endothelial cells to produce cytokines, such
as IL-1, IL-6, and TNF-␣. These cytokines can activate nearby
innate cells, encouraging phagocytosis of the bacteria. The cell
walls of many gram-positive bacteria contain a peptidoglycan
that activates the alternative complement pathway, leading to
opsonization and phagocytosis or lysis (see Chapter 6).

Viruses commonly induce the production of interferons,
which can inhibit viral replication by inducing an antiviral
response in neighboring cells. Viruses are also controlled by
natural killer (NK) cells, which frequently form the first line
of defense in these infections (see Chapter 5). In many cases,
these innate responses can lead to the resolution of infection.
Cells responding via innate immunity at the infection
site receive signals that help coordinate the subsequently
more specific adaptive immune response. During this very
pathogen-specific stage of the immune response, final eradication of the foreign invader often occurs, typically leaving a
memory response capable of halting secondary infections.
However, just as adaptive immunity in vertebrates has evolved
over many millennia, pathogens have evolved a variety of
strategies to escape destruction by the adaptive immune
response. Some pathogens reduce their own antigenicity
either by growing within host cells, where they are sequestered from immune attack, or by shedding their membrane
antigens. Other pathogen strategies include camouflage
(expressing molecules with amino acid sequences similar to
those of host cell membrane molecules or acquiring a covering of host membrane molecules); suppressing the immune
response selectively or directing it toward a pathway that is
ineffective at fighting the infection; and continual variation
in surface antigens. Examples of each of these strategies are
included in the following sections.

Viral Infections
Viruses are small segments of nucleic acid with a protein or
lipoprotein coat that require host resources for their replication. Typically, a virus enters a cell via a cell-surface receptor
for which it has affinity and preempts cell biosynthetic machinery to replicate all components of itself, including its genome.
This genome replication step is often error prone, generating
numerous mutations. Because large numbers of new viral

particles (virions) are produced in a replication cycle, many
different mutants with individual survival advantages can be
selected for the ability to propagate most effectively in the host.
A virus is more likely to thrive if it does not kill its host,
as sustained coexistence in the host favors the survival and
spread of the virus. However, the mutability of the viral
genome sometimes gives rise to lethal variants that do not
conform to this state of equilibrium with their host. If such
mutants cause the early death of their host, survival of the
virus requires that it spread to new hosts rapidly. Among the
other survival strategies available to viruses is a long latency
period before severe illness, during which time the host may
pass the virus to others unknowingly, as in the case of HIV.
One additional strategy used by viruses is facile transmission, such as with influenza and the smallpox virus, where
infection is efficiently transferred during even a short acute
illness. The life cycle of some viruses pathogenic for humans,
such as WNV, may also include nonhuman hosts, providing
them with additional reservoirs.
A number of specific immune effector mechanisms,
together with nonspecific defense mechanisms, prevent or
eliminate most viral infections (Table 17-1). Passage across
the mucosa of the respiratory, genitourinary, or gastrointestinal tracts accounts for most instances of viral transmission. Entrance of the virus may also occur through broken
skin, usually as a result of an insect bite or puncture wound.
The outcome of this infection depends on how effectively
the host’s defensive mechanisms resist the offensive tactics
of the virus.
The innate immune response to viral infection primarily
begins with the recognition of pathogen associated molecular
patterns (PAMPs) and leads to the generation of antiviral
effectors. For example, double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) molecules and other virus-specific structures are detected by one
of several PAMP receptors, inducing the expression of type I
interferons (IFN-␣ and IFN-␤), the assembly of intracellular
inflammasome complexes, and the activation of NK cells.

The Immune System in Health and Disease

Type I interferons can induce an antiviral response or resistance
to viral replication by binding to the IFN-␣/-␤ receptor,
thereby activating the JAK-STAT pathway and the production of new transcripts, one of which encodes an enzyme that
leads to viral RNA degradation (see Figure 5-16). IFN-␣/-␤
binding also induces dsRNA-dependent protein kinase
(PKR), which leads to inactivation of protein synthesis, thus
blocking viral replication in infected cells. The binding of
type I interferon to NK cells induces lytic activity, making
them very effective in killing virally infected cells. This activity is enhanced by IL-12, a cytokine that is produced by dendritic cells very early in the response to viral infection.

vate NK cells, which play an important role in host defense
and lysis of infected cells during the first days of many viral
infections, until a specific CTL response develops.
In most viral infections, specific CTL activity arises
within 3 to 4 days after infection, peaks by 7 to 10 days, and
then declines. Within 7 to 10 days of primary infection, most
virions have been eliminated, paralleling the development of
CTLs. CTLs specific for the virus eliminate virus-infected
self cells and thus eliminate potential sources of new virus.
Virus-specific CTLs confer protection against that virus in
nonimmune recipients following adoptive transfer. Transfer
of a CTL clone specific for influenza virus strain X protects
mice against strain X but not against influenza virus strain Y.

Many Viruses Are Neutralized by Antibodies
Antibodies specific for viral surface antigens are often crucial in containing the spread of a virus during acute infection
and in protecting against reinfection. Antibodies are particularly effective if they are localized at the site of viral entry
into the body and if they bind to key viral surface structures,
interfering with their ability to attach to host cells. For
example, influenza virus binds to sialic acid residues in cell
membrane glycoproteins and glycolipids, rhinovirus binds
to intercellular adhesion molecules (ICAMs), and EpsteinBarr virus (EBV) binds to type 2 complement receptors on
B cells. The advantage of the attenuated oral polio vaccine,
discussed later in this chapter, is that it induces production
of secretory IgA, which effectively blocks attachment of
poliovirus to epithelial cells lining the gastrointestinal tract.
Viral neutralization by antibody sometimes involves mechanisms that operate after viral attachment to host cells. For
example, antibodies may block viral penetration by binding to
epitopes that are necessary to mediate fusion of the viral envelope with the plasma membrane. If the induced antibody is of
a complement-activating isotype, lysis of enveloped virions
can ensue. Antibody or complement can also agglutinate viral
particles and function as an opsonizing agent to facilitate Fcor C3b-receptor-mediated phagocytosis of the free virions.

Cell-Mediated Immunity Is Important
for Viral Control and Clearance
Although antibodies have an important role in containing
the spread of a virus in the acute phases of infection, they
cannot eliminate established infection once the viral genome
is integrated into host chromosomal DNA. Once such an
infection is established, cell-mediated immune mechanisms
are most important in host defense. In general, both CD8⫹
TC cells and CD4⫹ TH1 cells are required components of the
cell-mediated antiviral defense. Activated TH1 cells produce
a number of cytokines, including IL-2, IFN-␥, and tumor
necrosis factor-␣ (TNF-␣), which defend against viruses either
directly or indirectly. IFN-␥ acts directly by inducing an
antiviral state in nearby cells. IL-2 acts indirectly by assisting
the development of cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) precursors into an effector population. Both IL-2 and IFN-␥ acti-

Viruses Employ Several Different Strategies
to Evade Host Defense Mechanisms
Despite their restricted genome size, a number of viruses
encode proteins that interfere with innate and adaptive levels
of host defense. Presumably, the advantage of such proteins is
that they enable viruses to replicate more effectively amid host
antiviral defenses. As described above, the induction of type I
interferon is a major innate defense against viral infection, but
some viruses have developed strategies to evade the action of
IFN-␣/-␤. These include hepatitis C virus, which has been
shown to overcome the antiviral effect of the interferons by
blocking or inhibiting the action of PKR (see Figure 5-16).
Another mechanism for evading host responses is inhibition of antigen presentation by infected host cells. Herpes
simplex virus (HSV) produces an immediate-early protein
(synthesized shortly after viral replication) that very effectively
inhibits the human transporter molecule needed for antigen
processing (TAP; see Figure 8-17). Inhibition of TAP blocks
antigen delivery to class I MHC molecules in HSV-infected
cells, thus preventing presentation of viral antigen to CD8⫹
T cells. This results in the trapping of empty class I MHC molecules in the endoplasmic reticulum and effectively shuts down
a CD8⫹ T-cell response to HSV-infected cells. Likewise, adenoviruses and cytomegalovirus (CMV) use distinct molecular
mechanisms to reduce the surface expression of class I MHC
molecules, again inhibiting antigen presentation to CD8⫹
T cells. Other viruses, such as measles virus and HIV, reduce
levels of class II MHC molecules on the surface, thus blocking
the function of antigen-specific antiviral helper T cells.
Complement activation is another of the antibodymediated destruction pathways of viruses, resulting in opsonization and elimination of the virus by phagocytic cells. A
number of viruses, such as vaccinia virus, evade complementmediated destruction by secreting a protein that binds to
the C4b complement component, inhibiting the classical
complement pathway. HSV also makes a glycoprotein component that binds to the C3b complement component,
inhibiting both the classical and alternative pathways.
A number of viruses escape immune attack by constantly
changing their surface antigens. The influenza virus is a
prime example, as discussed below. Antigenic variation

Infectious Diseases and Vaccines
among rhinoviruses, the causative agent of the common
cold, is responsible for our inability to produce an effective
vaccine for colds. Nowhere is antigenic variation greater
than in HIV, the causative agent of AIDS, estimated to accumulate mutations 65 times faster than the influenza virus. A
section of Chapter 18 is dedicated to HIV and AIDS.
Viruses such as EBV, CMV, and HIV cause generalized or
specific immunosuppression. In some cases, immunosuppression is caused by direct viral infection of lymphocytes or
macrophages. The virus can then either directly destroy the
immune cells by cytolytic mechanisms or alter their function. In other cases, immunosuppression is the result of a
cytokine imbalance or diversion of the immune responses
toward pathways less effective at virus eradication. For
instance, EBV, the cause of mononucleosis, produces a protein that is homologous to IL-10; like IL-10, this protein

suppresses cytokine production by the TH1 subset, resulting
in an immunosuppressed state.

Influenza Has Been Responsible for Some
of the Worst Pandemics in History
The influenza virus infects the upper respiratory tract and
major central airways in humans, horses, birds, pigs, and even
seals. Between 1918 and 1919, the largest influenza pandemic
(worldwide epidemic) in recent history occurred, killing
between 20 million and 50 million people. The sequence of this
virus has recently been reconstructed, leading to much controversy about its publication (Clinical Focus Box 17-1). Two other
less major pandemics occurred in the twentieth century, caused
by influenza strains that were new or had not circulated in the
recent past, leaving most people with little immunity to them.

BOX 17-1

CLINICAL FOCUS

The 1918 Pandemic Influenza Virus: Should It Publish or Perish?
The most virulent and devastating of the pandemic strains of influenza
virus in recent history was seen in 1918
and 1919. Worldwide deaths from that socalled “Spanish flu” strain may have
reached 50 million in less than 1 year, compared with the roughly 10,000 to 15,000
who die yearly from nonpandemic strains.
Approximately 675,000 of the victims of
Spanish flu were located the United States,
with certain areas, such as Alaska and the
Pacific Islands, losing more than half of
their population during the outbreak.
Mortality rates for the 1918 pandemic flu
were surprisingly high, especially among
young and healthy individuals, reaching
2.5% in infected individuals compared to
less than 0.1% during other flu epidemics.
Most of these deaths were the result of a
virulent pneumonia, which felled some
patients in as little as 5 days.
Thanks to present-day molecular techniques and chance, the recent reconstruction and sequencing of the virus that
caused the 1918 pandemic became possible. After several failed attempts, a
research team led by Jeffrey Tautenberger
published the final genetic sequences of
the deadly 1918 flu virus. Their results
were made possible following isolation of
viral RNA from Spanish flu victims using
formalin-fixed lung autopsy samples and

tissue collected from an Inuit woman who
was buried in permafrost in Alaska. Analysis of the sequence revealed that this
highly virulent strain was derived from an
avian virus and differed significantly from
other human influenza A strains, making it
the most “bird-like” of the influenza strains
ever isolated from humans.
The reconstructed virus sequence
became the object of intense study, as
well as controversy. Thanks to a cDNA
reconstruction of live virus, scientists were
able to study the virulence factors at play
in this deadly strain. In mouse studies,
they found that the reconstructed virus
spread rapidly in the respiratory tract and
produced high numbers of progeny, causing pervasive damage in the lungs. Using
recombinant virus strains, they found that
three polymerase genes and the HA gene
appeared to account for the high lethality
of the virus; replacing the polymerase
genes significantly reduced the virulence
of the strain while a new HA gene completely blocked its ability to kill the host.
Word of the imminent publication of
the sequence of the 1918 influenza caused
a scientific and public controversy. On the
one hand, many virologists, molecular
biologists, and epidemiologists were eager
to glimpse this highly virulent sequence
for clues to what determinants might play

a role in lethality and what measures could
be taken to avoid this in the future. On the
other hand, some feared that this
sequence might be used for evil rather
than for good, leading to a potential do-ityourself recombinant reconstructionist
frenzy, culminating in a weaponized version of the influenza virus. In the end, the
sequences were published and follow-up
studies led to the conclusion that the 1918
virus is sensitive to the seasonal flu vaccine
and even treatable with available anti-flu
drugs; this may have calmed many fears.
Nevertheless, controversy persists.
Recently, the National Science Advisory
Board for Biosecurity (NSABB), a U.S.-based
body that advises the community about
research concerning agents deemed a
national security threat, recommended
against the release of data related to the
current avian H5N1 strain. These data
would reveal the mutations behind the
virus’s transmissibility to humans. After 8
months of deliberations, Science magazine
published a special open-access issue in
June 2012 describing this work and related
policy issues, placing another one in the
publish-rather-than-perish column.

Properties of the Influenza Virus
Influenza virions are surrounded by an outer envelope, a
lipid bilayer derived from the plasma membrane of the
infected cell, plus various virus-specific proteins. Imbedded
in this envelope are two key viral glycoproteins, hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) (Figure 17-2a). HA
trimers are responsible for the attachment of the virus to
host cells, binding to the sialic acid groups on host-cell glycoproteins and glycolipids. NA is an enzyme that cleaves
N-acetylneuraminic (sialic) acid from nascent viral glycoproteins and host-cell membrane glycoproteins, facilitating
viral budding from the infected host cell. Thus these two
structures are essential for viral attachment and for exit of
new virus from infected cells—so important in fact that we
track new strains of influenza based on their antigenic subtypes of HA and NA (e.g., H1N1 versus H5N1 virus). Within
the envelope, an inner layer of matrix protein surrounds the
nucleocapsid, which consists of eight different strands of
single-stranded RNA (ssRNA) associated with protein and
RNA polymerase (Figure 17-2b). Each RNA strand encodes
one or more different influenza proteins.
There are three basic types of influenza (A, B, and C),
each differing in the makeup of its nuclear and matrix proteins. Type A is the most common and is responsible for the

sid, which consists of eight ssRNA molecules associated with nucleoprotein. The eight RNA strands encode 10 proteins: PB1, PB2, PA, HA
(hemagglutinin), NP (nucleoprotein), NA (neuraminidase), M1, M2,
NS1, and NS2. [Source: (a) Courtesy of G. Murti, Department of Virology, St.
Jude Children’s Research Hospital, Memphis, Tenn.]

major human pandemics. Influenza virus strains are tracked
yearly by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
(CDC) and the World Health Organization (WHO). According to WHO nomenclature, each virus strain is defined by its
animal host of origin (specified if other than human), geographical origin, strain number, year of isolation, and the
antigenic structures of HA and NA. For example, A/Sw/
Iowa/15/30 (H1N1) designates strain-A isolate 15 that arose
in swine in Iowa in 1930 and has antigenic subtypes 1 for
both HA and NA (refer to Table 17-2, pandemic strains).
Variation in Epidemic Influenza Strains
To date, there are 13 different antigenic subtypes for HAs
and 9 for NAs. Antigenic variation in HA and NA is generated by two different mechanisms: antigenic drift and antigenic shift. Antigenic drift involves a series of spontaneous
point mutations that occur gradually, resulting in minor
changes in HA and NA over time. Antigenic shift results in
the sudden emergence of a new subtype of influenza, where
the structures of HA and/or NA are considerably different
from that of the virus present in a preceding year.
The immune response contributes to the emergence of
these antigenically distinct influenza strains. In a typical
year, the predominant virus strain undergoes antigenic

drift, generating minor antigenic variants. As individuals
infected with influenza mount an effective immune
response, they will eliminate that strain. However, the accumulation of point mutations sufficiently alters the antigenicity of some variants so that they are able to escape
immune elimination (Figure 17-3a) and become a new variant of influenza that is transmitted to others, causing
another local epidemic cycle. The role of antibody in such
immunologic selection can be demonstrated in the laboratory by mixing an influenza strain with a monoclonal antibody specific for that strain and then culturing the virus in
cells. The antibody neutralizes all unaltered viral particles,
and only those viral particles with mutations resulting in
altered antigenicity escape neutralization and are able to
continue the infection. Within a short time in culture, a new
influenza strain emerges, just as it does in nature. In this
way, influenza evolves during a typical flu season, such that
the dominant strains at the start and end of the season are
antigenically distinct. This is why we are offered a new flu
vaccine each year. The vaccine formulation is based on carefully constructed models tracking the dominant variant(s)
from the end of the previous season. And our guesses are
not always 100% accurate, making some years’ influenza
vaccinations more effective than others.
Episodes of antigenic shift are thought to occur through a
different mechanism. The primary mechanism is genetic

FIGURE 17-4 The presence of preformed antibody inhibits primary responses to a pathogen. (a) During a primary
response, naïve B cells are activated and produce antibodies specific
to epitopes on the pathogen. During a secondary response to a variant
of that pathogen, memory B cells specific to epitopes encountered in
the past will be reactivated and help to eradicate the pathogen. The Fc
regions of antibodies bound to the surface of the pathogen will bind
to the FcRs on naïve B cells and inhibit them from responding, even to
new epitopes on the pathogen. (b) This inhibition of primary responses

reassortment between influenza virions from humans and
those from various animals (Figure 17-3b). The fact that the
influenza genome contains eight separate strands of ssRNA
makes possible the reassortment of individual RNA strands
of human and animal virions within a secondary (nonhuman) host cell infected with both viruses—in other
words, shuffling of the DNA segments derived from the
animal and human strains. Both pigs and birds can harbor
human influenza A viruses, as well as their own and maybe
those of other species, making them perfect conduits for in
vivo genetic reassortment between human influenza A

against unique epitopes on pathogens that elicit memory cell
responses is called original antigenic sin. No immune response is
mounted to each new epitope during subsequent exposures to the
pathogen until the pathogen expresses a significant number of unique
epitopes and memory cells can no longer eradicate the organism. In
this case, a new primary response is mounted and disease symptoms
are severe until a new adaptive response has been established, resetting original antigenic sin. [Source: Adapted from P. Parham, 2009, The
Immune System, New York: Garland Science. a: Fig. 10.23; b: Fig. 10.25.]

viruses and the potential sources for strains that have been
coined “swine flu” or “bird or avian flu.” As one might
imagine, the contribution of viral proteins from the viruses
of these animals is frequently “new” to humans who will
have little or no immunity, sparking pandemics.
Original Antigenic Sin and Susceptibility to Influenza
Immunologic memory is an amazing and beautiful thing.
For pathogens that don’t change much from one encounter to
the next, it can provide us with lifelong protection. However,
preformed immunity can come with caveats for pathogens

c17InfectiousDiseasesandVaccines.indd Page 561 12/20/12 9:35 PM user-t044

/Volumes/203/MHR00209/siL52070/disk1of1/0071052070

Infectious Diseases and Vaccines
that have evolved to vary their antigenic structure. During
secondary encounters with a pathogen that bears a strong
molecular resemblance to a pathogen seen in the past (i.e., we
have developed adaptive immunity to some of the epitopes
before), memory cells specific for previously encountered
epitopes are engaged rapidly and efficiently. As long as these
cells and their products, like antibodies, can dispatch the
pathogen efficiently, there is no need to mount a primary
response to any new epitopes carried by that pathogen. In
fact, the presence of antibodies attached to a pathogen,
either as residuals from a recent infection or produced by
reactivation of memory B cells, will divert naïve B cells from
responding (Figure 17-4a). This occurs when the Fc region
of the pathogen-associated antibody binds with Fc receptors
on naïve B cells, inducing anergy.
In other words, if there is a way to take care of an infection with memory, this will be the default pathway. This
concept is referred to as original antigenic sin, or the tendency to focus an immune attack on those structures that
were present during the original, or primary, encounter with
a pathogen and for which we have established memory. This
means that our immune systems effectively ignore the subtle
changes occurring each year in pathogens that drift antigenically, like influenza virus (Figure 17-4b). Once the
organism has drifted sufficiently that there are only “new”
epitopes, or insufficient numbers of key epitopes to effectively dispatch with existing memory cells, a new primary
response is mounted. In such a year, we experience a bad
case of the flu. Since we all begin our journeys of original
antigenic sin at different times and in response to different
antigenic variants, we don’t typically all get a bad case of the
flu at the same time; the exceptions are pandemic influenza
years (see Clinical Focus Box 17-1).

Bacterial Infections
Immunity to bacterial infections is achieved by means of
antibody unless the bacterium is capable of intracellular
growth, in which case delayed-type hypersensitivity (DTH)
has an important role. Bacteria enter the body either through
a number of natural routes (e.g., the respiratory, gastrointestinal, and genitourinary tracts) or through normally inaccessible routes opened up by breaks in mucous membranes or
skin. Depending on the number of organisms entering and
their virulence, different levels of host defense are enlisted. If
the inoculum size and the virulence are both low, then localized tissue phagocytes may be able to eliminate the bacteria
via nonspecific innate defenses. Larger inocula or organisms with greater virulence tend to induce antigen-specific
adaptive immune responses.
In some bacterial infections, disease symptoms are caused
not by the pathogen itself but by the immune response. As
described in Chapter 4, pathogen-stimulated overproduction of cytokines leads to the symptoms associated with

|

CHAPTER 17

561

bacterial septic shock, food poisoning, and toxic shock syndrome. For instance, cell wall endotoxins of some gramnegative bacteria activate macrophages, resulting in release
of high levels of IL-1 and TNF-␣, which can cause septic
shock. In staphylococcal food poisoning and toxic shock
syndrome, exotoxins produced by the pathogens function as
superantigens, which can activate all T cells that express
T-cell receptors with a particular V␤ domain (see Table 11-2).
The resulting systemic production of cytokines by activated
TH cells is overwhelming, causing many of the symptoms of
these diseases.

Immune Responses to Extracellular and
Intracellular Bacteria Can Differ
Infection by extracellular bacteria induces production of
antibodies, which are ordinarily secreted by plasma cells in
regional lymph nodes and the submucosa of the respiratory
and gastrointestinal tracts. The humoral immune response is
the main protective response against extracellular bacteria.
The antibodies act in several ways to protect the host from
the invading organisms, including removal of the bacteria
and inactivation of bacterial toxins (Figure 17-5). Extracellular bacteria can be pathogenic because they induce a localized inflammatory response or because they produce toxins.
The toxins—endotoxin or exotoxin—can be cytotoxic but
also may cause pathogenesis in other ways. An excellent
example of this is the toxin produced by diphtheria, which
blocks protein synthesis. Endotoxins, such as LPS, are generally components of bacterial cell walls, whereas exotoxins,
such as diphtheria toxin, are secreted by the bacteria.
Antibody that binds to accessible antigens on the surface
of a bacterium can, together with the C3b component of
complement, act as an opsonin that increases phagocytosis
and thus clearance of the bacterium. In the case of some
bacteria—notably, the gram-negative organisms—complement
activation can lead directly to lysis of the organism. Antibodymediated activation of the complement system can also
induce localized production of immune effector molecules
that help to develop an amplified and more effective inflammatory response. For example, the complement fragments
C3a and C5a act as anaphylatoxins, inducing local mast-cell
degranulation and thus vasodilation and the extravasation of
lymphocytes and neutrophils from the blood into tissue
spaces (see Figure 17-5). Other complement split products
serve as chemotactic factors for neutrophils and macrophages,
thereby contributing to the buildup of phagocytic cells at the
site of infection. Antibody to a bacterial toxin may bind to the
toxin and neutralize it; the antibody-toxin complexes are then
cleared by phagocytic cells in the same manner as any other
antigen-antibody complex.
Although innate immunity is not very effective against
intracellular bacterial pathogens, intracellular bacteria can
activate NK cells, which in turn provide an early defense
against these organisms. Intracellular bacterial infections tend

Some bacteria evade the antibody responses of the host by
changing their surface antigens. In Neisseria gonorrhoeae, for
example, pilin (the protein component of the pili) has a highly
variable structure, generated by gene rearrangements of its
coding sequence. The pilin locus consists of 1 or 2 expressed
genes and 10 to 20 silent genes. Each gene is arranged into six
regions called minicassettes. Pilin variation is generated by a
process of gene conversion, in which one or more minicassettes from the silent genes replace a minicassette of the
expression gene. This process generates enormous antigenic

3. Invasion of host tissue
4. Toxin-induced damage to host cells
Host-defense mechanisms act at each of these steps, and
many bacteria have evolved ways to circumvent some of
them (Table 17-3).
Some bacteria express molecules that enhance their ability
to attach to host cells. A number of gram-negative bacteria,
for example, have pili (long hairlike projections), which
enable them to attach to the membrane of the intestinal or
genitourinary tract (Figure 17-6). Other bacteria, such as
Bordetella pertussis, the cause of whooping cough, secrete
adhesion molecules that attach to both the bacterium and
the ciliated epithelial cells of the upper respiratory tract.
Secretory IgA antibodies specific for such bacterial structures can block bacterial attachment to mucosal epithelial
cells and are the main host defense against bacterial attachment. However, some bacteria, such as the species of Neisseria that cause gonorrhea and meningitis, evade the IgA
response by secreting proteases that cleave secretory IgA at
the hinge region; the resulting Fab and Fc fragments have a

The Immune System in Health and Disease

variation, which may contribute to the pathogenicity of N.
gonorrhoeae by increasing the likelihood that expressed pili
will go undetected by antibody, allowing them to bind firmly
to epithelial cells and avoid neutralization by IgA.
Bacteria may also possess surface structures that inhibit
phagocytosis. A classic example is Streptococcus pneumoniae,
whose polysaccharide capsule prevents phagocytosis very
effectively. The 84 serotypes of S. pneumoniae differ from
one another by distinct capsular polysaccharides, and during
infection the host produces antibody against the infecting
serotype. This antibody protects against reinfection with the
same serotype but will not protect against infection by a different serotype. In this way, genetic variants of S. pneumoniae can cause disease many times in the same individual.
On other bacteria, such as Streptococcus pyogenes, a surface
protein projection called the M protein inhibits phagocytosis, a key step in bacterial removal. Some pathogenic staphylococci are able to assemble a protective coat from host
blood proteins. These bacteria secrete a coagulase enzyme
that precipitates a fibrin coat around them, shielding them
from phagocytic cells.
Mechanisms for interfering with the complement system
help other bacteria survive. In some gram-negative bacteria,
for example, long side chains on the lipid A moiety of the
cell wall core polysaccharide help to resist complementmediated lysis. Pseudomonas secretes an enzyme, elastase,
that inactivates both the C3a and C5a anaphylatoxins,
thereby diminishing the localized inflammatory reaction.
A number of bacteria escape host-defense mechanisms
through their ability to survive within phagocytic cells. Bacteria such as Listeria monocytogenes escape from the phagolysosome to the cytoplasm, a favorable environment for
their growth. Other bacteria, such as members of the Mycobacterium genus, block lysosomal fusion with the phagolysosome or resist the oxidative attack that typically takes
place within the phagolysosome.

Tuberculosis Is Primarily Controlled
by CD4⫹ T Cells
Until recently, tuberculosis, caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis, was the leading cause of death in the world from a
single infectious agent. Today, M. tuberculosis and HIV vie
for the lead in deaths due to an infectious agent, with an
increasing number of individuals infected by both. Roughly
one-third of the world’s population is infected with M.
tuberculosis. Although tuberculosis was believed to be eliminated as a public health problem in the United States, the
disease re-emerged in the early 1990s, particularly in areas
where HIV-infection levels are high. This disease is still the
leading killer of individuals with AIDS.
M. tuberculosis spreads easily, and pulmonary infection
usually results from inhalation of small droplets of respiratory secretions containing a few bacilli. The inhaled bacilli
are ingested by alveolar macrophages in the lung and are able
to survive and multiply intracellularly by inhibiting forma-

tion of phagolysosomes. When the infected macrophages
lyse, large numbers of bacilli are released.
The most common clinical pattern of infection with M.
tuberculosis, seen in 90% of infected individuals, is pulmonary tuberculosis. In this pattern, CD4⫹ T cells are activated
within 2 to 6 weeks after infection and secrete cytokines that
induce the infiltration of large numbers of activated macrophages. These cells wall off the organism inside a granuloma
called a tubercle (Figure 17-7), a cluster of small lymphocytes surrounding infected macrophages. The localized concentrations of lysosomal enzymes in these granulomas can
cause extensive tissue necrosis. The massive activation of
macrophages that occurs within tubercles often results in the
concentrated release of lytic enzymes. These enzymes destroy
nearby healthy cells, resulting in circular regions of necrotic
tissue, which eventually form a lesion with a caseous
(cheeselike) consistency. As these lesions heal, they become
calcified and are readily visible on x-rays of the lungs as a
defined shadow. Much of the tissue damage seen with M.
tuberculosis is thus actually due to pathology associated with
the cell-mediated immune response.
Because the activated macrophages suppress proliferation
of the phagocytosed bacilli, infection is contained. Cytokines
produced by CD4⫹ T cells (TH1 subset) play an important
role in the response by activating macrophages so that they
are able to kill the bacilli or inhibit their growth. The role of
IFN-␥ in the immune response to mycobacteria has been
demonstrated with knockout mice lacking IFN-␥. These
mice died when they were infected with an attenuated strain
of mycobacteria, whereas IFN-␥⫹ wild-type mice survived.

Infectious Diseases and Vaccines
The CD4⫹ T-cell-mediated immune response mounted
by the majority of people exposed to M. tuberculosis controls
the infection and later protects against reinfection. However,
in about 10% of infected individuals, the disease progresses
to chronic pulmonary tuberculosis or to extrapulmonary
tuberculosis. This progression may occur years after the primary infection. In this clinical pattern, accumulation of large
concentrations of mycobacterial antigens within tubercles
leads to chronic CD4⫹ T-cell activation and ensuing macrophage activation, with high concentrations of lytic enzymes
causing the necrotic caseous lesions to liquefy into a rich
medium that allows the tubercle bacilli to proliferate extracellularly. Eventually the lesions rupture, and the bacilli disseminate in the lung and/or are spread through the blood
and lymphatic vessels.
Tuberculosis has traditionally been treated for long periods of time with several different antibiotics, sometimes in
combination. The intracellular growth of M. tuberculosis
makes it difficult for drugs to reach the bacilli, necessitating
up to 9 months of daily treatment. Recent clinical trials
showed a slightly more effective combination of antibiotics
that can be taken less frequently and for a shorter period.
Infected individuals with latent tuberculosis were more
likely to complete this course of antibiotics, reducing the
chances of disease spread.
At present, the only vaccine for M. tuberculosis is an
attenuated strain of M. bovis called Bacille Calmette-Guérin
(BCG). This vaccine is fairly effective against extrapulmonary tuberculosis but less so against the more common pulmonary tuberculosis; in some cases, BCG vaccination has
even increased the risk of infection. Moreover, after BCG
vaccination the tuberculin skin test cannot be used as an
effective monitor of exposure to wild-type M. tuberculosis.
Because of these drawbacks, this vaccine is not used in the
United States but is used in several other countries. However, the alarming increase in multidrug-resistant strains has
stimulated renewed efforts to develop a more effective tuberculosis vaccine.

Diphtheria Can Be Controlled by Immunization
with Inactivated Toxoid
Diphtheria is the classic example of a bacterial disease
caused by a secreted exotoxin. Immunity to Corynebacterium diphtheriae, the causative agent, can be induced by
immunization with an inactivated form of the toxin, known
as a toxoid. Natural infection with C. diphtheriae occurs
only in humans, and is spread by respiratory droplets. The
organism colonizes the nasopharyngeal tract and causes little tissue damage, with only a mild inflammatory reaction.
Virulence is due to its potent exotoxin, which destroys the
underlying tissue and results in heart, liver, and kidney damage, as well as to suffocation following formation of a tough
fibrous membrane in the respiratory tract. Interestingly, the
exotoxin is encoded not by the bacteria but by the tox gene
carried by a bacterial virus (called phage ␤). The toxin inhib-

its protein synthesis and is extremely potent: a single molecule has been shown to kill a cell.
Immunization with the toxoid-based vaccine caused a
rapid decrease in the number of cases of diphtheria, although
sporadic outbreaks have occurred in areas where vaccination
coverage is allowed to lapse. Diphtheria toxoid is administered in a vaccine combination with Bordetella pertussis (the
cause of whooping cough) and tetanus toxoid (called DPT,
for diphtheria, pertussis, and tetanus). DPT or DTaP, is given
to children beginning at 6 to 8 weeks of age as part of the
normal course of childhood immunizations (see below).
Immunization with the toxoid induces the production of
antibodies (antitoxin), which can bind to the toxin and neutralize its activity. Because antitoxin levels decline slowly over
time, booster shots are recommended at 10-year intervals to
maintain antitoxin levels within the protective range.

Parasitic Infections
The term parasite encompasses a vast number of protozoan
and helminthic organisms (worms). The diversity of the
parasitic universe makes it difficult to generalize, but a major
difference between these types of parasites is that the protozoans are unicellular eukaryotes that usually live and multiply within host cells for at least part of their life cycle,
whereas helminths are multicellular organisms that can be
quite large and have the ability to live and reproduce outside
their human host. Most clinically relevant protozoan parasites also require an intermediate host for a portion of their
life cycle and for transmission to human hosts.
Parasites can evade the immune system, allowing them to
chronically infect their human hosts and exact a lifelong toll.
Malaria, African sleeping sickness, Chagas’s disease, leishmaniasis, and toxoplasmosis are among the most common
parasitic diseases. Experimental systems, especially mouse
models of infection, have defined how immunity to certain
parasites is achieved, but the diversity of parasites and the
complexity of the infections they cause preclude easy generalizations.

Protozoan Parasites Account for Huge
Worldwide Disease Burdens
Infections caused by parasites account for an enormous disease burden worldwide, especially in tropical or subtropical
regions and developing countries where sanitation and living conditions are poor. The presence of sewage-tainted
water promotes parasite spread and transmission to humans.
Likewise, many of the protozoan parasites spend part of
their time in arthropod hosts, such as mosquitoes, flies, or
ticks, which serve as an essential microenvironment for
completion of their life cycle and as a vector for transmission
to humans. Targeting these blood-feeding vectors can therefore be quite effective in interrupting protozoan propagation
and reducing transmission rates.

The Immune System in Health and Disease

The type and effectiveness of immune response to protozoan infection depends in part on the location of the parasite
within the host and the life cycle stage of the parasite. Many
protozoans spend part of their time free within the bloodstream; humoral antibody is most effective during these
stages. At other stages they may grow intracellularly, making
cell-mediated immune reactions the most effective host
defense. In the development of vaccines for protozoan diseases, the life cycle stages of these pathogens and the branch
of the immune response that is most likely to confer protection must be carefully considered.
Malaria
Malaria is the number-one parasitic cause of death worldwide. Half of the world’s population lives in a malaria
endemic zone, and nearly 10% of the world population is
infected by the causative agent of malaria: one of several species of the genus Plasmodium, of which P. falciparum is the
most virulent. The alarming development of multiple-drug
resistance in Plasmodium and the increased pesticide resistance of the Anopheles mosquito, the arthropod vector of
Plasmodium, underscore the importance of developing new
strategies to hinder the spread of malaria.
Plasmodium has an extremely complex life cycle. Female
Anopheles mosquitoes serve as the vector and host for part of
the parasite’s life cycle. (Because male Anopheles mosquitoes
feed on plant juices, they do not transmit Plasmodium.)
Human infection begins when sporozoites, one of the life
cycle stages of Plasmodium, enter the bloodstream as an
infected female mosquito takes a blood meal (Figure 17-8).
Sporozoites are long, slender cells that are covered by a
45-kDa protein called circumsporozoite (CS) antigen, which
mediates their adhesion to hepatocytes. The binding site on
the CS antigen is a conserved region that has a high degree
of sequence homology with known human cell adhesion
molecules. In hepatocytes, the parasites differentiate into
merozoites, which infect red blood cells, initiating the major
symptoms and pathology of malaria. Eventually some of the
merozoites differentiate into male and female gametocytes,
which may be ingested by a female Anopheles mosquito during a blood meal from an infected individual. Within the
mosquito’s gut, the male and female gametocytes differentiate into gametes that fuse to form a zygote, which multiplies
and differentiates into sporozoites within the mosquito’s
salivary gland, initiating the cycle again.
The symptoms of malaria are recurrent chills, fever, and
sweating that peak roughly every 48 hours, when successive
generations of merozoites are released from infected red
blood cells. An infected individual eventually becomes weak
and anemic. The merozoites can block capillaries, causing
intense headaches, renal failure, heart failure, or cerebral damage (called cerebral malaria), often with fatal consequences.
Some malaria symptoms may be caused by excessive production of cytokines, a hypothesis stemming from the observation that cancer patients treated with recombinant TNF-␣
developed symptoms that mimicked malaria. The connection

enter the bloodstream when an infected mosquito takes a blood
meal. The sporozoites migrate to the liver, where they multiply, transforming liver hepatocytes into giant multinucleate schizonts, which
release thousands of merozoites into the bloodstream. The merozoites infect red blood cells, which eventually rupture, releasing more
merozoites. Eventually some of the merozoites differentiate into male
and female gametocytes, which are ingested by a mosquito and
differentiate into gametes in the mosquito’s gut. The gametes fuse to
form a zygote that differentiates to the sporozoite stage within the
salivary gland of the mosquito.

between TNF-␣ and malaria symptoms was studied by infecting mice with a mouse-specific strain of Plasmodium, which
causes rapid death by cerebral malaria. Injection of these mice
with antibodies to TNF-␣ prevented this rapid death.
In regions where malaria is endemic, the immune
response to Plasmodium infection is poor. Children younger
than 14 years old mount the weakest immune response and
consequently are most likely to develop malaria. In some
regions, the childhood mortality rate for malaria reaches
50%. Even in adults, the degree of immunity is far from complete. Most people living in endemic regions have lifelong
low-level Plasmodium infections.

Infectious Diseases and Vaccines
A number of factors may contribute to these low levels
of immune response to Plasmodium. The maturational
changes allow the organism to keep changing its surface
molecules, resulting in continual changes in the antigens
seen by the immune system. The intracellular phases of the
life cycle reduce the degree of immune activation generated
by the pathogen and allow the organism to multiply
shielded from attack. The most accessible stage, the sporozoite, circulates in the blood for such a short time before
infecting hepatocytes (approx. 30 minutes) that effective
immune activation is unlikely to occur. Even when an
antibody response does develop to sporozoites, Plasmodium
overcomes that response by sloughing off the CS surface
antigens, thus rendering the antibodies ineffective. The development of drug resistance by Plasmodium has complicated
drug treatment choices for malaria, making the search for
a vaccine very important.
African Sleeping Sickness
Two species of African trypanosomes cause African sleeping
sickness, a chronic, debilitating disease transmitted to
humans and cattle by the bite of the tsetse fly. In the bloodstream, the trypanosome, a flagellated protozoan, differentiates into a long, slender form that continues to divide every
4 to 6 hours. The disease progresses from an early, systemic
stage in which trypanosomes multiply in the blood to a neurologic stage in which the parasite infects cells of the central
nervous system, leading to meningoencephalitis and eventual loss of consciousness—thus the name.
The surface of the Trypanosoma parasite is covered with a
variable surface glycoprotein (VSG). Several unusual genetic
processes generate extensive variation in these surface structures, enabling the organism to escape immunologic clearance. An individual trypanosome carries a large repertoire
of VSG genes, each encoding a different VSG primary
sequence, but expresses only a single VSG gene at a time.
Trypanosoma brucei, for example, carries more than 1000
VSG genes in its genome. Activation of a VSG gene results in
duplication of the gene and its transposition to a transcriptionally active expression site (ES) at the telomeric end of
specific chromosomes (Figure 17-9a). Activation of a new
VSG gene displaces the previous gene from the telomeric ES,
like placing a new DVD in the reader. Trypanosomes have
multiple transcriptionally active ES sites, so that a number of
VSG genes can potentially be expressed; unknown control
mechanisms limit expression to a single VSG expression site
at any time.
As parasite numbers increase after infection, an effective
humoral response develops to the VSG covering the surface
of the parasite. These antibodies eliminate most of the parasites from the bloodstream, both by complement-mediated
lysis and by opsonization and subsequent phagocytosis.
However, about 1% of the organisms bear an antigenically
different VSG because of transposition of that VSG gene into
the ES. These parasites escape the initial antibody response,
begin to proliferate in the bloodstream, and go on to populate

|

CHAPTER 17

the next wave of parasitemia in the host. The successive
waves of parasitemia reflect a unique mechanism of antigenic shift by which the trypanosomes evade the immune
response to their surface antigens. Each new variant that
arises in the course of a single infection escapes the humoral
antibodies generated in response to the preceding variant,
and so waves of parasitemia recur (Figure 17-9b). The new
variants arise not by clonal outgrowth from a single escape
variant cell, but from the expansion of multiple cells that
have activated the same VSG gene in the current wave of
parasitic growth. It is not known how this process is coordinated. This continual shifting of surface epitopes has made
vaccine development extremely difficult.
Leishmaniasis
The protozoan parasite Leishmania major illustrates how powerfully different host responses can impact disease outcome,
leading to either clearance of the parasite or death from the
infection. Leishmania is a flagellated protozoan that lives in
the phagosomes of macrophages and is transmitted by sandflies. It usually results in one of two syndromes: a localized
cutaneous lesion that is generally painless and self-resolving,
or a systemic form of the disease, called visceral leishmaniasis, which is nearly always fatal without treatment.
Resistance to leishmaniasis correlates well with the production of IFN-␥ and the development of a TH1 response.
Strains of mice that are naturally resistant to Leishmania
develop a TH1 response and produce IFN-␥ upon infection.
If IFN-␥ production or signaling is blocked in these strains,
the mice become highly susceptible to Leishmania-induced
fatality. However, a few strains of mice, such as BALB/c, are
naturally susceptible to Leishmania-induced death. BALB/c
animals mount a TH2-type response to Leishmania infection,
producing high levels of IL-4 and essentially no IFN-␥. Studies have shown that a small subset of CD4⫹ T cells in the
susceptible animals recognize a particular epitope on L. major,
and produces high levels of IL-4 early in the response to the
parasite, skewing the response towards a TH2-dominated
pathway. Understanding how different T-helper responses
affect the outcome of infections could contribute to the
rational design of effective treatments and vaccines against
this and other pathogens.

A Variety of Diseases Are Caused by Parasitic
Worms (Helminths)
Parasitic worms, or helminths, are responsible for a wide
variety of diseases in humans and animals. The adult forms
are large, multicellular organisms that can often be seen with
the naked eye. Parasitic worms are frequently categorized
based on their structure and site of infection: nematodes
(roundworms), cestodes (tapeworms), and trematodes (flukes).
Most enter their animal hosts through the intestinal tract; helminth eggs can contaminate food, water, feces, and soil.
Although helminths are exclusively extracellular and therefore
more accessible to the immune system than protozoans, most

Infectious Diseases and Vaccines
infected individuals carry few parasites. Unlike protozoan
parasites, helminths do not multiply within their hosts.
Thus, the immune response is not strongly engaged, and the
level of immunity generated can be very poor.
More than 300 million people are infected with Schistosoma, which causes the chronic, debilitating, and sometimes-fatal disease schistosomiasis. Infection occurs
through contact with free-swimming infectious larvae that
are released from an infected snail and bore into the skin,
frequently while individuals wade through contaminated
water. As they mature, they migrate in the body, with the
final site of infection varying by species. The females produce eggs, some of which are excreted and infect more
snails. Most symptoms of schistosomiasis are initiated by
the eggs, which invade tissues and cause hemorrhage. A
chronic state can develop in which the unexcreted eggs
induce cell-mediated DTH reactions, resulting in large
granulomas that can obstruct the venous blood flow to the
liver or bladder.
An immune response does develop to the schistosomes,
but it is usually not sufficient to eliminate the adult worms.
Instead, the worms survive for up to 20 years, causing prolonged morbidity. Adult schistosome worms have several
unique mechanisms that protect them from immune
defenses. These include decreasing the expression of antigens on their outer membrane and enclosing themselves in a
glycolipid-and-glycoprotein coat derived from the host,
masking the presence of their own antigens. Among the
antigens observed on the adult worm are the host’s own
ABO blood-group and histocompatibility antigens! The
immune response is, of course, diminished by this covering
made of the host’s self antigens, which must contribute to the
lifelong persistence of these organisms.
The major contributors to protective immunity against
schistosomiasis are controversial. The immune response to
infection with S. mansoni is dominated by TH-2-like mediators, with high titers of antischistosome IgE antibodies,
localized increases in degranulating mast cells, and an influx
of eosinophils (Figure 17-10, top). These cells can then bind
the antibody-coated parasite using their Fc receptors for IgE
or IgG, inducing degranulation and death to the parasite via
antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC; see
Figure 13-14). One eosinophil mediator, called basic protein,
has been found to be particularly toxic to helminths. However, immunization studies in mice suggest that a TH1
response, characterized by IFN-␥ and macrophage accumulation, may actually be more effective for inducing protective
immunity (Figure 17-10, bottom). In fact, inbred strains of
mice with deficiencies in mast cells or IgE can still develop
protective immunity to S. mansoni following vaccination.
Based on these observations, it has been suggested that the
ability to induce an ineffective TH2-like response may have
evolved in schistosomes as a clever defense mechanism to
ensure that IL-10 and other TH-1 inhibitors are induced in
order to block initiation of a more effective TH1-dominated
pathway.

Fungal Infections
Fungi are a diverse and ubiquitous group of organisms that
occupy many niches and also perform services for humans,
including the fermentation of bread, cheese, wine, and beer,
as well as the production of penicillin. As many as a million
species of fungi are known to exist; only about 400 are
potential agents of human disease. Infections may result
from introduction of exogenous organisms due to injury or
inhalation, or from endogenous organisms such as the commensals present in the gut and on the skin.
Fungal diseases, or mycoses, are classified based on the
following criteria:
• Site of infection—superficial, cutaneous, subcutaneous,
or deep and systemic
• Route of acquisition—exogenous or endogenous
• Virulence—primary or opportunistic
These categories (summarized in Table 17-4) are not mutually
exclusive. For example, an infection such as coccidiomycosis
may progress from a cutaneous lesion to a systemic infection
of the lungs. Cutaneous infections include attacks on skin, hair,
and nails; examples are ringworm, athlete’s foot, and jock itch.
Subcutaneous infections are normally introduced by trauma
and accompanied by inflammation; if inflammation is chronic,
extensive tissue damage may ensue. Deep mycoses involve the
lungs, the central nervous system, bones, and the abdominal
viscera. These infections can occur through ingestion, inhalation, or inoculation into the bloodstream. A very rare and
deadly outbreak of fungal meningitis in 2012 was linked to
Exserohilium rostratum, a fungal contaminant in a preparation
of corticosteroids used for epidural injections.
Virulence can be divided into primary, indicating the rare
agents with high pathogenicity, and opportunistic, denoting
weakly virulent agents that primarily infect individuals with
compromised immunity. Most fungal infections of healthy
individuals are resolved rapidly, with few clinical signs. The
most commonly encountered and best-studied human fungal pathogens are Cryptococcus neoformans, Aspergillus
fumigatus, Coccidioides immitis, Histoplasma capsulatum,
and Blastomyces dermatitidis. Diseases caused by these fungi
are named for the agent; for example, C. neoformans causes
cryptococcosis and B. dermatitidis causes blastomycosis. In
each case, infection with these environmental agents is aided
by predisposing conditions that include AIDS, immunosuppressive drug treatment, and malnutrition.

Innate Immunity controls Most Fungal
Infections
The barriers of innate immunity control most fungi. Commensal organisms also help control the growth of potential
pathogens, as demonstrated by long-term treatment with
broad-spectrum antibiotics, which destroy normal mucosal
bacterial flora and often lead to oral or vulvovaginal infection

with Candida albicans, an opportunistic agent. Phagocytosis
by neutrophils is a strong defense against most fungi, and so
people with neutropenia (low neutrophil count) are generally
more susceptible to fungal disease.
Resolution of infection in normal, healthy individuals is
often rapid and initiated by recognition of common fungal

cell wall PAMPs. The three most medically relevant cell wall
components include ␤-glucans (polymers of glucose), mannans (long chains of mannose), and chitin (a polymer of
N-acetylglucosamine). The importance of certain pattern
recognition receptors (PRRs) in resolving fungal infection
has been demonstrated by the increased susceptibility to

mycoses seen in individuals with defects in these components.
For instance, certain molecular variants of dectin 1, a C-type
lectin receptor (see Chapter 5), are associated with chronic
mucocutaneous candidiasis. Toll-like receptors 2, 4 and 9, as
well as complement receptor 3 (CR3), are also involved in
the innate response to fungi. In sum, recognition of these cell
wall components leads to the activation of complement (via
both alternative and lectin pathways) along with the induction of phagocytosis and destruction of fungal cells. The key
role of CR3, which recognizes complement deposited on the
␤-glucans of fungal cells, was confirmed by the fact that mortality from experimental infections of mice with Cryptococcus
increased after an antibody to CR3 was administered.
Like other microbes, fungi have evolved mechanisms to
evade the innate immune response. These include production of a capsule, as in the case of C. neoformans, which
blocks PRR binding. Another evasion strategy employed by
this organism involves fungi-induced expulsion from macrophages that does not kill host cells and therefore avoids
inflammation.

Immunity against Fungal Pathogens Can
Be Acquired
A convincing demonstration of acquired immunity against
fungal infection is the protection against subsequent attacks
following an infection. This protection is not always obvious
for fungal disease because primary infection often goes
unnoticed. However, positive skin reactivity to fungal antigens is a good indicator of prior infection and the presence
of memory responses. For instance, a granulomatous inflammation controls spread of C. neoformans and H. capsulatum,
indicating the presence of acquired cell-mediated immunity.
However, the organism may remain in a latent state within
the granuloma, reactivating only if the host becomes immunosuppressed.
The presence of antibodies is another sign of prior exposure and lasting immunity, and antibodies against C. neoformans are commonly found in healthy subjects. However,
probably the most convincing argument for preexisting
immunity against fungal pathogens comes from the fre-

quency of normally rare fungal diseases in patients with
compromised immunity. AIDS patients suffer increased
incidences of mucosal candidiasis, histoplasmosis, coccidiomycosis, and cryptococcosis. These observations in T-cellcompromised AIDS patients and data showing that
B-cell–deficient mice have no increased susceptibility to
fungal disease indicate that cell-mediated mechanisms of
immunity likely control most fungal pathogens.
The study of immunity to fungal pathogens has become
more pressing with the advent of AIDS and the increase in
individuals receiving immunosuppressive drugs for other
conditions. This has led to the observation that strong TH1
responses and the production of IFN-␥, important for optimal macrophage activation, are most commonly associated
with protection against fungi. Conversely, TH2 and TREG cell
responses, or their products, are associated with susceptibility to mycoses. This is apparent in patients displaying distinct T helper responses to coccidioidomycosis, where TH1
immune activity is associated with a mild, asymptomatic
infection and TH2 responses result in a severe and often
relapsing form of the disease. Although the role for other cell
types is less certain, recently a regulatory role for TH17 cells
in controlling adaptive immunity against fungi has been
postulated, where these cells are hypothesized to help support TH1- and discourage TH2-cell activation.

Emerging and Re-emerging
Infectious Diseases
At least yearly, it seems, we hear about a new virus or bacterium arising, accompanied by severe illness or death. Newly
described human pathogens are referred to as emerging
pathogens. Examples include HIV, SARS, WNV, the widely
publicized Ebola virus, and Legionella pneumophila, the bacterial causative agent for Legionnaires’ disease. These often
appear to come from nowhere and, as far as we know, are
caused by new human pathogens. On the other hand, reemerging pathogens are those that were formerly rare or
largely eradicated but suddenly begin to infect a widening
number of individuals. The re-emergence of these diseases is

not surprising if we consider that some microbes can adapt
to a range of environments, and that many microbes can
exist in dormant states or can survive in intermediate hosts.
Examples of many of the emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases are shown in Figure 17-11.

Some Noteworthy New Infectious Diseases
Have Appeared Recently
Ebola was first recognized after an outbreak in Africa in
1976. The disease received a great deal of attention because
of the severity and rapid progression to death after the onset
of symptoms. By 1977, the causative virus had been isolated
and classified as a filovirus, a type of RNA virus that includes
the similarly deadly Marburg virus, a close relative of Ebola.
The most pathogenic strain, Ebola-Zaire, causes a particularly severe hemorrhagic fever, killing roughly 50% to 90% of
those infected, often within days of the onset of symptoms.
Although the risk of death is very high after infection, it is
fairly easy to control the spread of the virus by isolating
infected individuals. This is an example of a pathogen that
likely resides in some wild animals, which helps it to remain

in the environment for long periods of time and only infect
humans when some form of contact is made. Although the
animal reservoir for Ebola has not been found, fruit bats are
the most likely candidate.
Legionnaires’ disease is a virulent pneumonia first
reported in attendees at an American Legion convention in
Philadelphia in 1976. Of the 221 afflicted, 34 died. The
organism causing the disease turned out to be a bacterium,
later named Legionella pneumophila. It proliferates in cool,
damp areas, including the condensing units of large commercial air-conditioning systems. Infection can spread when
the air-conditioning system emits an aerosol containing the
bacteria. Improved design of air-conditioning and plumbing
systems has greatly reduced the danger from this disease.
In November 2002, an unexplained atypical pneumonia
was seen in the Guandong province of China, proving resistant to any treatment. A physician who had cared for some
of these patients traveled to Hong Kong and infected guests
in his hotel, who then seeded a multinational outbreak that
lasted until May 2003. By the time the disease, called severe
acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), was contained, 8096
cases had been reported, with 774 deaths. A rapid response

SARS virus is angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). The spike
protein from the highly virulent form of the virus binds with high
affinity to this receptor; the variant of this virus found in the civet cat

by the biomedical community identified the etiologic agent
as a coronavirus, so named because the spike proteins emanating from these viruses give them a crownlike appearance
(Figure 17-12a). This virus was soon traced to the civet cat
after the earliest cases of SARS were found to occur in animal vendors. Human coronaviruses had been known for
many years, primarily as the cause of a mild form of the
common cold, but this newly emerged variant had not been
seen previously. X-ray crystallography showed that a mutated
civet SARS virus spike protein could bind to a human cell
surface protein, human angiotensin-converting enzyme type
2 (ACE2), 1000 times more tightly than did the original
virus spike protein, answering the question of how this virus
jumped from the civet cat to humans (Figure 17-12b). Animal models for SARS showed that antibodies to the outer
spike protein could thwart replication of the virus, leading to
the later development of an intranasal vaccine that could induce
a strong local humoral response as well as cell-mediated
immunity.
West Nile virus (WNV), first identified in Uganda in
1937, was not seen outside Africa or western Asia until 1999,
when it showed up in the New York City area. By 2006, it
had been reported in all but six states in the continental
United States. WNV is a flavivirus that replicates very well
in certain species of birds and is carried by mosquitoes from
infected birds to so-called dead-end hosts such as horses
and humans. Transmission between humans via mosquitos
is inefficient because the titer of virus in human blood is low
and the amount of blood transferred by the insect bite is
small and does not contain sufficient virus to cause infection. WNV may, however, be transferred from human to
human by blood transfusion and may be passed from

and in a version that causes mild human disease have two different
amino acid substitutions in the spike protein. The civet cat SARS virus
does not bind to the human receptor, and the version that causes
mild disease in humans binds 1000 times more weakly than the most
virulent form. [Source: Part a from Dr. Linda Stannard, UCT/Photo Researchers;

infected pregnant mothers to their newborns. It is only a
health hazard in individuals with compromised immune
function, in whom it can cross the blood-brain barrier and
cause life-threatening encephalitis or meningitis. The primary public health control measure is education of the
public about mosquito control.
Why are these new diseases emerging and others reemerging around the globe? One reason may be the crowding of the world’s poorest populations into ever smaller areas
within huge cities. Another factor is the great increase in
international travel: an individual can become infected on
one continent and then spread the disease on another continent all in the same day. The mass distribution and importation of food can also expose large populations to potentially
contaminated food. Indiscriminate use of antibiotics in
humans and in veterinary applications also fosters resistance
in pathogens to the drugs commonly used against them.
Finally, changes in climate and weather patterns, along with
the extension of human populations into the previously
unbroached domains of animals, can introduce new pathogens into human populations.

Diseases May Re-emerge for Various Reasons
Tuberculosis is a re-emerging disease now receiving considerable attention. Twenty years ago, public health officials
were convinced that tuberculosis would soon disappear as a
major health consideration in the United States. A series of
events conspired to interrupt the trend, including the AIDS
epidemic and other conditions that result in immunosuppressed individuals, allowing Mycobacterium strains to gain
a foothold and evolve resistance to the conventional battery

of antibiotics. These individuals can then pass on newly
emerged, antibiotic-resistant strains of M. tuberculosis to
others. Despite the disappointment of not eradicating this
disease in the United States, rates of tuberculosis have been
declining annually, with a record decline of more than 10%
in 2009. However, incidence rates worldwide are falling at
less than 1% annually, despite multiple efforts to tackle
tuberculosis globally.
Laxity in adherence to vaccination programs can also
lead to re-emergence of diseases that were nearly eradicated.
For example, diphtheria began to re-emerge in parts of the
former Soviet Union in 1994, where it had almost vanished
thanks to European vaccination programs. By 1995, over
50,000 cases were reported and thousands died. The social
upheaval and instability that came with the breakup of the
Soviet Union was almost certainly a major factor in the reemergence of this disease, due to lapses in vaccination and
other public health measures. Even in the United States, an
increasing trend in some regions to delay or opt out of childhood vaccination has led to sporadic local outbreaks in
previously rare childhood diseases such as measles and
whooping cough. The WHO and the CDC both actively
monitor new infections, and work closely to detect and identify new infectious agents and key re-emerging pathogens.
Their collective data help to provide up-to-date information
for travelers to parts of the world where such emerging and
re-emerging infectious agents may pose a risk.

Vaccines
Preventative vaccines have led to the control or elimination of
many infectious diseases that once claimed millions of lives.
Since October 1997, not a single naturally acquired smallpox
case has been reported anywhere. On the heels of the global
victory over smallpox, the program to eradicate polio went
into overdrive. Led by the WHO and several large philanthropic donors, numbers of polio cases were reduced worldwide by over 95% by the year 2000. Alas, cultural and
religious resistance to vaccination led to polio’s reappearance
in recent years, although many vaccination programs are now
back on track. Worldwide vaccination campaigns can also be
credited with the control of at least 10 other major infectious
diseases (measles, mumps, rubella, typhoid, tetanus, diphtheria, pertussis, influenza, yellow fever, and rabies), many of
which previously affected mostly babies and young children.
Still, a crying need remains for vaccines against many
other diseases, including malaria, tuberculosis, and AIDS.
More work is needed for existing vaccines as well: to improve
safety and efficacy of some, or to lower the cost and simplify
the delivery of existing vaccines so that they can reach those
who need them most, especially in developing countries.
Based on WHO data, millions of infants still die due to diseases that could be prevented by existing vaccines.
Development of effective new vaccines is a long, complicated, and costly process, rarely reaching the stage of years-

long clinical trials. Many vaccine candidates that were
successful in laboratory and animal studies fail to prevent
disease in humans, have unacceptable side effects, or may
even worsen the disease they were meant to prevent. Stringent testing is an absolute necessity, because approved vaccines will be given to large numbers of well people. Clear
information for consumers about adverse side effects, even
those that occur at very low frequency, must be made available and carefully balanced against the potential benefit of
protection by the vaccine.
Vaccine development begins with basic research. An
appreciation of the differences in epitopes recognized by T
and B cells has enabled immunologists to design vaccine
candidates to maximize activation of both cellular and
humoral immune responses. As differences in antigenprocessing pathways became evident, design strategies and
additives can be employed to activate specific, desired immune
pathways and to maximize antigen presentation. Targeting
strategies to elicit protection at mucosal surfaces, the most
common site of infection, are also underway. Finally, techniques like genetic engineering are being employed to
develop vaccines that maximize the immune response to
selected epitopes and that simplify delivery. Here we describe
current vaccine strategies, some vaccines presently in use,
and new strategies that may lead to future vaccines.

Protective Immunity Can Be Achieved
by Active or Passive Immunization
Immunization is the process of eliciting a long-lived state of
protective immunity against a disease-causing pathogen.
Exposure to the live pathogen followed by recovery is one
route to immunization. Vaccination, or intentional exposure
to forms of a pathogen that do not cause disease (a vaccine),
is another. In an ideal world, both engage antigen-specific
lymphocytes and result in the generation of memory cells,
providing long-lived protection. However, vaccination does
not ensure immunity, and a state of immune protection can
be achieved by means other than infection or vaccination.
For example, the transfer of antibodies from mother to fetus
or the injection of antiserum against a pathogen both provide
immune protection. Without the development of memory B
or T cells specific to the organism, however, this state of
immunity is only temporary. Thus, vaccination is an event,
whereas immunization (the development of a protective
memory response) is a potential outcome of that event. Here
we describe current use of passive and active immunization
techniques.
Passive Immunization by Delivery
of Preformed Antibody
Edward Jenner and Louis Pasteur are recognized as the pioneers of vaccination, or early attempts to induce active
immunity, but similar recognition is due to Emil von Behring
and Hidesaburo Kitasato for their contributions to passive

immunity. These investigators were the first to show that
immunity elicited in one animal can be transferred to
another by injecting serum from the first.
Passive immunization, in which preformed antibodies are
transferred to a recipient, occurs naturally when maternal
IgG crosses the placenta to the developing fetus. Maternal
antibodies to diphtheria, tetanus, streptococci, rubeola,
rubella, mumps, and poliovirus all afford passively acquired
protection to the developing fetus. Later, maternal antibodies present in breast milk can also provide passive immunity
to the infant in the form of maternally produced IgA.
Passive immunization can also be achieved by injecting a
recipient with preformed antibodies, called antiserum, from
immune individuals. Before vaccines and antibiotics became
available, passive immunization was the only effective therapy
for some otherwise fatal diseases, such as diphtheria, providing much needed humoral defense (see Chapter 1, Clinical
Focus Box 1-2). Currently, several conditions still warrant the
use of passive immunization, including the following:
• Immune deficiency, especially congenital or acquired
B-cell defects
• Toxin or venom exposure with immediate threat to life
• Exposure to pathogens that can cause death faster than
an effective immune response can develop

dren experiencing acute respiratory failure caused by respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). Passive immunity is used in
unvaccinated individuals exposed to the organisms that
cause botulism, tetanus, diphtheria, hepatitis, measles, and
rabies (Table 17-5), or to protect travelers and health-care
workers who expect exposure to potential pathogens for
which they lack protective immunity. Antiserum provides
protection against poisonous snake and insect bites. In all
these instances, it is important to remember that passive
immunization does not activate the host’s immune response.
Therefore, it generates no memory response and protection
is transient.
Although passive immunization may be effective, it
should be used with caution because certain risks are associated with the injection of preformed antibody. If the antibody was produced in another species, such as a horse (one
of the most common animal sources), the recipient can
mount a strong response to the isotypic determinants of the
foreign antibody, or the parts of the antibody that are unique
to the horse species. This anti-isotype response can cause
serious complications. Some individuals will produce IgE
antibody specific for horse-specific determinants. High levels of these IgE-horse antibody immune complexes can
induce pervasive mast-cell degranulation, leading to systemic anaphylaxis (see Chapter 15). Other individuals produce IgG or IgM antibodies specific for the foreign antibody,
which form complement-activating immune complexes. The
deposition of these complexes in the tissues can lead to type
III hypersensitivity reactions. Even when human antiserum,
or gamma globulin, is used, the recipient can generate an
anti-allotype response to the human immunoglobulin (recognition of within species antigenic differences), although
its intensity is usually much less than that of an anti-isotype
response.
Active Immunization to Induce Immunity
and Memory
Whereas the aim of passive immunization is transient protection or alleviation of an existing condition, the goal of
active immunization is to trigger the adaptive immune
response in a way that will elicit protective immunity and
immunologic memory. When active immunization is successful, a subsequent exposure to the pathogenic agent elicits
a secondary immune response that successfully eliminates
the pathogen or prevents disease mediated by its products.
Active immunization can be achieved by natural infection
with a microorganism, or it can be acquired artificially by
administration of a vaccine. In active immunization, as the
name implies, the immune system plays an active role—
proliferation of antigen-reactive T and B cells is induced and
results in the formation of protective memory cells. This is
the primary goal of vaccination.
Active immunization with various types of vaccines has
played an important role in the reduction of deaths from
infectious diseases, especially among children. In the United
States, vaccination of children begins at birth. The American

Academy of Pediatrics sets nationwide recommendations
(updated in 2012) for childhood immunizations in this country, as outlined in Table 17-6. The program includes the following vaccines for children from birth to age 6:
• Hepatitis B vaccine (HepB)
• Diphtheria-tetanus-(acellular) pertussis (DTaP)
combined vaccine
• Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib) vaccine to prevent
bacterial meningitis and pneumonia
• Inactivated (Salk) polio vaccine (IPV)
• Measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) combined vaccine
• Varicella zoster vaccine for chickenpox
• Meningococcal vaccine (MCV4) against Neisseria
meningitidis
• Pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV) or pneumococcal
polysaccharide vaccine (PPSV) against Streptococcus
pneumoniae
• Influenza virus vaccine (seasonal flu)
• Hepatitis A vaccine (HepA)
• Rotavirus (RV)

New recommendations as of February 2012 for young
adults add males ages 11 to 12, to the individuals recommended
to receive vaccination against sexually-transmitted human papillomavirus (HPV), the primary cause of cervical cancer in
women. Since 2006 this vaccine has been recommended for
females, starting at age 11 to 12 (see Clinical Focus Box 19-1).
As indicated in Table 17-6, children typically require
boosters (repeated inoculations) at appropriately timed
intervals to achieve protective immunity. In the first months
of life, the reason for this may be persistence of circulating
maternal antibodies in the young infant. For example, passively acquired maternal antibodies bind to epitopes on the
DTaP vaccine and block adequate activation of the immune
system; therefore, this vaccine must be given several times
after the maternal antibody has been cleared from an infant’s
circulation in order to achieve adequate immunity. Passively
acquired maternal antibody also interferes with the effectiveness of the measles vaccine; for this reason, the MMR vaccine is not given before 12 to 15 months of age. In developing
countries, however, the measles vaccine is administered at 9
months, even though maternal antibodies are still present,
because 30% to 50% of young children in these countries
contract the disease before 15 months of age. Multiple
immunizations with the polio vaccine are required to ensure
that an adequate immune response is generated to each of
the three strains of poliovirus that make up the vaccine.

Infectious Diseases and Vaccines
The widespread use of vaccines for common, life-threatening diseases in the United States has led to a dramatic
decrease in the incidence of these diseases. As long as these
immunization programs are maintained, especially in young
children, the incidence of these diseases typically remains
low. However, the occurrence or even the suggestion of possible side effects to a vaccine, as well as general trends toward
reduced vaccination in children, can cause a drop in vaccination rates that leads to re-emergence of that disease. For
example, rare but significant side effects from the original
pertussis attenuated bacterial vaccine included seizures,
encephalitis, brain damage, and even death. Decreased usage
of the vaccine led to an increase in the incidence of whooping cough, before the development of an acellular pertussis
vaccine (the aP in DTaP), as effective as the older vaccine but
with fewer side effects, became available in 1991. However,
recent trends toward altered vaccination schedules or refusal
to vaccinate children may be fueling outbreaks of this disease. There were 18,000 cases and several deaths in U.S.
children in just the first part of 2012, putting that year on
track to be the worst in the past five decades. Despite the
safety record of this vaccine and the frightening rise in this
potentially deadly childhood disease, some parents still elect
not to vaccinate their children (see Chapter 1, Clinical Focus
Box 1-1).
Recommendations for vaccination of adults depend on
the risk group. Vaccines for meningitis, pneumonia, and
influenza are often given to groups living in close quarters
(e.g., military recruits and incoming college students) or to
individuals with reduced immunity (e.g., the elderly).
Depending on their destination, international travelers are
also routinely immunized against endemic diseases such as
cholera, yellow fever, plague, typhoid, hepatitis, meningitis,

CHAPTER 17

typhus, and polio. Immunization against the deadly disease
anthrax had been reserved for workers coming into close
contact with infected animals or animal products. Concerns about the potential use of anthrax spores by terrorists
or in biological warfare has widened use of the vaccine to
military personnel and civilians in areas believed to be at
risk.
Vaccination is not 100% effective. With any vaccine, a
small percentage of recipients will respond poorly and
therefore will not be adequately protected. Th is is not a
serious problem if the majority of the population is
immune to an infectious agent, significantly reducing the
pathogen reservoir. In this case, the chance of a susceptible
individual contacting an infected individual is very low.
This phenomenon is known as herd immunity. The
appearance of measles epidemics among college students
and preschool-age children in the United States resulted
partly from an overall decrease in vaccinations, which had
lowered the herd immunity of the population (Figure
17-13). Among preschool-age children, 88% of those who
developed measles were unvaccinated. Most of the college
students who contracted measles had been vaccinated as
children but only once. The failure of the single vaccination to protect them may have resulted from the lingering
presence of passively acquired maternal antibodies (disappearing at 12 to 15 months of age), which reduced their
overall response to the vaccine. This prompted the revised
recommendation that children receive two MMR immunizations: one at 12 to 15 months of age and the second at 4
to 6 years.
The CDC has called attention to the decline in vaccination rates and herd immunity among U.S. children. For
example, based on data collected by California health

The Immune System in Health and Disease

officials, pockets of vaccine noncompliance, mostly due to
fear of adverse consequences, have likely decreased local
herd immunity, resulting in outbreaks. Such a decrease
portends serious consequences, as illustrated by recent
events in the newly independent states of the former Soviet
Union. By the mid-1990s, a diphtheria epidemic was raging
in many regions of these new countries, linked to a
decrease in herd immunity resulting from decreased vaccination rates after the breakup of the Soviet Union. Mass
immunization programs now control this infectious disease.

There Are Several Vaccine Strategies, Each with
Unique Advantages and Challenges
Three key factors must be kept in mind in the development
of a successful vaccine: the vaccine must be safe, it must be
effective in preventing infection, and the strategy should be
reasonably achievable given the population in question.
Population considerations can include geographical locale,
access to the target group (which may require several vaccinations), complicating co-infections or nutritional states,
and, of course, cost. Critical for success is the branch of the
immune system that is activated, and therefore vaccine
designers must recognize the important differences
between activation of the humoral and cell-mediated
branches, or divergent pathways within these branches.
Protection must also reach the relevant site of infection;
mucosal surfaces are the prime candidates. An additional
factor is the development of long-term immunologic
memory. For example, a vaccine that induces a protective
primary response may fail to induce the formation of
memory cells, leaving the host unprotected after the primary response subsides.
Before vaccines can progress from the laboratory bench to
the bedside, they must go through rigorous testing in animals
and humans. Most vaccines in development never progress
beyond animal testing. The type of testing depends on what
animal model systems are available, but frequently involves
rodents and/or nonhuman primates. When these animal
studies prove fruitful, follow-up clinical trials in humans can
be initiated. Phase I clinical trials assess human safety; a small
number of volunteers are monitored closely for adverse side
effects. Only once this hurdle has been successfully passed
can a trial move on to phase II, where effectiveness against
the pathogen in question is evaluated. In this case, development of a measurable immune response to the immunogen is
tested. However, even a positive result at this juncture does
not necessarily mean that a state of protective immunity has
been achieved or that long-term memory is established, and
many vaccines fail at this stage. Phase III clinical trials are run
in expanded volunteer populations, where protection against
“the real thing” is the desired outcome, and where safety, the
evaluation of several measurable immune markers, and the
incidence of wild-type infections with the relevant pathogen
are all monitored carefully over time.
The relative significance of memory cells in immunity
depends, in part, on the incubation period of the pathogen.

For influenza virus, which has a very short incubation
period (1 or 2 days), disease symptoms are already underway
by the time memory cells are reactivated. Effective protection against influenza therefore depends on maintaining
high levels of neutralizing antibody by repeated immunizations; those at highest risk are immunized each year, usually
at the start of the flu season. For pathogens with a longer
incubation period, the presence of detectable neutralizing
antibody at the time of infection is not necessary. The poliovirus, for example, requires more than 3 days to begin to
infect the central nervous system. An incubation period of
this length gives the memory B cells time to respond by producing high levels of serum antibody. Thus, the vaccine for
polio is designed to induce high levels of immunologic
memory. After immunization with the Salk vaccine (an inactivated form, see below), serum antibody levels peak within
2 weeks and then decline. However, the memory response
continues to climb, reaching maximal levels at 6 months post
vaccine and persisting for years. If an immunized individual
is later exposed to the poliovirus, these memory cells will
respond by differentiating into plasma cells that produce
high levels of serum antibody, which defend the individual
from the effects of the virus.
In the remainder of this section, various approaches to
the design of vaccines—both currently used vaccines and
experimental ones—are described, with an examination of
the ability of the vaccines to induce humoral and cellmediated immunity and the production of memory cells. As
Table 17-7 indicates, the common vaccines currently in use
consist of live but attenuated organisms, inactivated (killed)
bacterial cells or viral particles, as well as protein or carbohydrate fragments (subunits) of the target organism. Several
new types of vaccine candidate provide potential advantages
in protection, production, or delivery to those in need. The
primary characteristics and some advantages and disadvantages of the different types of vaccines are included in the
following discussions.
Live, Attenuated Vaccines
In some cases, microorganisms can be attenuated or disabled
so that they lose their ability to cause significant disease
(pathogenicity) but retain their capacity for transient growth
within an inoculated host. Some agents are naturally attenuated by virtue of their inability to cause disease in a given
host, although they can immunize these individuals. The first
vaccine used by Jenner is of this type: vaccinia virus (cowpox)
inoculation of humans confers immunity to smallpox but
does not cause smallpox. Attenuation can often be achieved
by growing a pathogenic bacterium or virus for prolonged
periods under abnormal culture conditions. This selects
mutants that are better suited for growth in the abnormal
culture conditions than in the natural host. For example, an
attenuated strain of Mycobacterium bovis called Bacillus
Calmette-Guérin (BCG) was developed by growing M. bovis
on a medium containing increasing concentrations of bile.
After 13 years, this strain had adapted to growth in strong bile
and had become sufficiently attenuated that it was suitable as

a vaccine for tuberculosis. Due to variable effectiveness and
difficulties in follow-up monitoring, BCG is not used in the
United States. The Sabin form of the polio vaccine and the
measles vaccine both consist of attenuated viral strains.
Attenuated vaccines have advantages and disadvantages.
Because of their capacity for transient growth, such vaccines
provide prolonged immune system exposure to the individual epitopes on the attenuated organisms and more closely
mimic the growth patterns of the “real” pathogen, resulting
in increased immunogenicity and efficient production of
memory cells. Thus, these vaccines often require only a
single immunization, a major advantage in developing coun-

tries, where studies show that a significant number of individuals fail to return for boosters. The ability of many
attenuated vaccines to replicate within host cells makes them
particularly suitable for inducing cell-mediated responses.
The oral polio vaccine (OPV) designed by Albert Sabin,
consisting of three attenuated strains of poliovirus, is administered orally to children. The attenuated viruses colonize
the intestine and induce production of secretory IgA, an
important defense against naturally acquired poliovirus. The
vaccine also induces IgM and IgG classes of antibody and
ultimately protective immunity to all three strains of virulent
poliovirus. Unlike most other attenuated vaccines, OPV

FIGURE 17-14 Progress toward the worldwide eradication of polio. Comparison of polio infection numbers for 1988 with those
for 2011 show considerable progress in most parts of the world, although some areas in Africa and Asia have shown recent increases. Some
experts question whether the use of live attenuated oral polio vaccine (OPV) will cause reversion to pathogenic forms at a rate sufficiently high
to prevent total eradication of this once-prevalent crippling disease. [Source: Data from World Health Organization.]

requires boosters, because the three strains of attenuated
poliovirus interfere with each other’s replication in the intestine. With the first immunization, one strain will predominate in its growth, inducing immunity to that strain. With
the second immunization, the immunity generated by the
previous immunization will limit the growth of the previously predominant strain in the vaccine, enabling one of the
two remaining strains to colonize the intestines and induce
immunity. Finally, with the third immunization, immunity
to all three strains is achieved.
A major disadvantage of attenuated vaccines is that
these live forms may mutate and revert to virulent forms in
vivo, resulting in paralytic disease in the vaccinated individual and serving as a source of pathogen transmission.
The rate of reversion of the OPV is about 1 case in 2.4 million doses of vaccine. This reversion can also allow patho-

genic forms of the virus to find their way into the water
supply, especially in areas where sanitation is not rigorous
or wastewater must be recycled. This possibility has led to
the exclusive use of the inactivated polio vaccine in this
country (see Table 17-6). The projected eradication of
paralytic polio (Figure 17-14) may be impossible as long as
OPV is used anywhere in the world. The alternative inactivated polio vaccine created by Jonas Salk will likely be
substituted as the number of cases decreases, although
there are problems with delivery in developing countries.
The ultimate goal is to achieve a polio-free world in which
no vaccine is needed.
Attenuated vaccines also may be associated with complications similar to those seen in the natural disease. A small
percentage of recipients of the measles vaccine, for example,
develop postvaccine encephalitis or other complications,

c17InfectiousDiseasesandVaccines.indd Page 581 12/20/12 9:35 PM user-t044

/Volumes/203/MHR00209/siL52070/disk1of1/0071052070

Infectious Diseases and Vaccines
although the risk of vaccine-related complications is still
much lower than risks from infection. An independent study
showed that 75 million doses of measles vaccine were given
between 1970 and 1993, with 48 cases of vaccine-related
encephalopathy (approx. 1 per 1.5 million). This low incidence compared with the rate of encephalopathy associated
with infection argues for the efficacy of the vaccine. An even
more convincing argument for vaccination is the high death
rate associated with measles infection, even in developed
countries.
In addition to culturing methods, genetic engineering
provides a way to attenuate a virus irreversibly, by selectively removing genes that are necessary for virulence or
for growth in the vaccinee. This has been done with a herpesvirus vaccine for pigs, in which the thymidine kinase
gene was removed. Because thymidine kinase is required
for the virus to grow in certain types of cells (e.g., neurons),
removal of this gene rendered the virus incapable of causing disease. A live, attenuated vaccine against influenza was
developed recently under the name FluMist. The virus was
grown at lower-than-normal temperatures until a coldadapted strain resulted that is unable to grow at human
body temperature of 37ºC. This live attenuated virus is
administered intranasally and causes a transient infection
in the upper respiratory tract, sufficient to induce a strong
immune response. The virus cannot spread beyond the
upper respiratory tract because of its inability to grow at
the elevated temperatures of the inner body. Because of the
ease of administration and induction of good mucosal
immunity, cold-adapted, nasally administered flu vaccines
are on the rise.
Inactivated or “Killed” Vaccines
Another common means to make a pathogen safe for use
in a vaccine is by treatment with heat or chemicals. This
kills the pathogen, making it incapable of replication, but
still allows it to induce an immune response to at least
some of the antigens contained within the organism. It is
critically important to maintain the structure of epitopes
on surface antigens during inactivation. Heat inactivation
is often unsatisfactory because it causes extensive denaturation of proteins; thus, any epitopes that depend on higher
orders of protein structure are likely to be altered significantly. Chemical inactivation with formaldehyde or various alkylating agents has been successful. The Salk polio
vaccine is produced by formaldehyde inactivation of the
poliovirus.
Although live attenuated vaccines generally require only
one dose to induce long-lasting immunity, killed vaccines
often require repeated boosters to achieve a protective
immune status. Because they do not replicate in the host,
killed vaccines typically induce a predominantly humoral
antibody response and are less effective than attenuated vaccines in inducing cell-mediated immunity or in eliciting a
secretory IgA response, key components of an ideal protective and mucosally based response.

CHAPTER 17

581

Even though the pathogens they contain are killed, inactivated whole-organism vaccines still carry certain risks. A
serious complication with the first Salk vaccines arose
when formaldehyde failed to kill all the virus in two vaccine lots, leading to paralytic polio in a high percentage of
recipients. Risk is also encountered in the manufacture of
the inactivated vaccines. Large quantities of the infectious
agent must be handled prior to inactivation, and those
exposed to the process are at risk of infection. However, in
general, the safety of inactivated vaccines is greater than
that of live attenuated vaccines. Inactivated vaccines are
commonly used against both viral and bacterial diseases,
including the classic yearly flu vaccine and vaccines for
hepatitis A and cholera. In addition to their relative safety,
their advantages include stability and ease of storage and
transport.
Subunit Vaccines
Many of the risks associated with attenuated or killed wholeorganism vaccines can be avoided with a strategy that uses
only specific, purified macromolecules derived from the
pathogen. The three most common applications of this strategy, referred to as a subunit vaccine, are inactivated exotoxins or toxoids, capsular polysaccharides or surface
glycoproteins, and key recombinant protein antigens (see
Table 17-7). One limitation of some subunit vaccines, especially polysaccharide vaccines, is their inability to activate
TH cells. Instead, they activate B cells in a thymus-independent type 2 (TI-2) manner, resulting in IgM production but
little class switching, no affinity maturation, and little, if any,
development of memory cells. However, vaccines that conjugate a polysaccharide antigen to a protein carrier can alleviate this problem by inducing TH cell responses (see below).
Some bacterial pathogens, including those that cause
diphtheria and tetanus, produce exotoxins that account for
all or most of the disease symptoms resulting from infection. Diphtheria and tetanus vaccines have been made by
purifying the bacterial exotoxin and then inactivating it
with formaldehyde to form a toxoid. Vaccination with the
toxoid induces antitoxoid antibodies, which are capable of
binding to the toxin and neutralizing its effects. Conditions
for the production of toxoid vaccines must be closely controlled and balanced to avoid excessive modification of the
epitope structure while also accomplishing complete
detoxification. As discussed previously, passive immunity
can also be used to provide temporary protection in unvaccinated individuals exposed to organisms that produce
these exotoxins, although no long-term protection is
achieved in this case.
The virulence of some pathogenic bacteria depends primarily on the antiphagocytic properties of their hydrophilic
polysaccharide capsule. Coating the capsule with antibodies
and/or complement greatly increases the ability of macrophages and neutrophils to phagocytose such pathogens.
These findings provide the rationale for vaccines consisting
of purified capsular polysaccharides. The current vaccine

The Immune System in Health and Disease

for Streptococcus pneumoniae (the organism which causes
pneumococcal pneumonia) consists of 13 antigenically distinct capsular polysaccharides (PCV13). The vaccine
induces formation of opsonizing antibodies and is now on
the list of vaccines recommended for all infants (see Table
17-6). The vaccine for Neisseria meningitidis, a common
cause of bacterial meningitis, also consists of purified capsular polysaccharides. Some viruses carry surface glycoproteins (e.g., an envelope protein from HIV-1) that have been
tested for use in antiviral vaccines, with little success. However, glycoprotein-D from HSV-2 has been shown to prevent genital herpes in clinical trials of some vaccines,
suggesting that this may be a viable approach for some antiviral vaccines as well.
Theoretically, the gene encoding any immunogenic protein can be cloned and expressed in cultured cells using
recombinant DNA technology, and this technique has been
applied widely in the design of many types of subunit vaccines. For example, the safest way to produce sufficient
quantities of the purified toxins that go into the generation
of toxoid vaccines involves cloning the exotoxin genes from
pathogenic organisms into easily cultured host cells. A
number of genes encoding surface antigens from viral,
bacterial, and protozoan pathogens have also been successfully cloned into cellular expression systems for use in vaccine development. The first such recombinant antigen
vaccine approved for human use is the hepatitis B vaccine,
developed by cloning the gene for the major hepatitis B
surface antigen (HBsAg) and expressing it in yeast cells.
The recombinant yeast cells are grown in large fermenters,
allowing HBsAg to accumulate in the cells. The yeast cells
are harvested and disrupted, releasing the recombinant
HBsAg, which is then purified by conventional biochemical techniques. Recombinant hepatitis B vaccine induces
the production of protective antibodies and holds much
worldwide promise for protecting against this human
pathogen.
Recombinant Vector Vaccines
Recall that live attenuated vaccines prolong antigen delivery
and encourage cell-mediated responses, but have the disadvantage that they can sometimes revert to pathogenic
forms. Recombinant vectors maintain the advantages of live
attenuated vaccines while avoiding this major disadvantage.
Individual genes that encode key antigens of especially
virulent pathogens can be introduced into attenuated
viruses or bacteria. The attenuated organism serves as a vector, replicating within the vaccinated host and expressing
the gene product of the pathogen. However, since most of
the genome of the pathogen is missing, reversion potential
is virtually eliminated. Recombinant vector vaccines have been
prepared utilizing existing licensed live, attenuated vaccines
and adding to them genes encoding antigens present on
newly emerging pathogens. Such chimeric virus vaccines
can be more quickly tested and approved than an entirely
new product. A very recent example of this is the yellow

fever vaccine that was engineered to express antigens of
WNV. A number of organisms have been used as the vector
in such preparations, including vaccinia virus, the canarypox virus, attenuated poliovirus, adenoviruses, attenuated
strains of Salmonella, the BCG strain of Mycobacterium
bovis, and certain strains of Streptococcus that normally
exist in the oral cavity.
Vaccinia virus, the attenuated vaccine used to eradicate
smallpox, has been widely employed as a vector for the
design of new vaccines. This large, complex virus, with a
genome of about 200 genes, can be engineered to carry
several dozen foreign genes without impairing its capacity
to infect host cells and replicate. The procedure for producing a vaccinia vector that carries a foreign gene from
another pathogen is outlined in Figure 17-15. The genetically engineered vaccinia expresses high levels of the
inserted gene product, which can then serve as a potent
immunogen in an inoculated host. Like the smallpox vaccine, genetically engineered vaccinia vector vaccines can be
administered simply by scratching the skin, causing a localized infection in host cells. If the foreign gene product
expressed by the vaccinia vector is a viral envelope protein,
it is inserted into the membrane of the infected host cell,
inducing development of cell-mediated as well as antibodymediated immunity.
Other attenuated vectors may prove to be safer than
vaccinia in vaccine preparations. A relative of vaccinia, the
canarypox virus, is also large and easily engineered to
carry multiple genes. Unlike vaccinia, it does not appear to
be virulent, even in individuals with severe immune suppression. Another possible vector is an attenuated strain of
Salmonella typhimurium, which has been engineered with
genes from the bacterium that causes cholera. The advantage of this vector for use in vaccines is that Salmonella
infects cells of the mucosal lining of the gut and therefore
will induce secretory IgA production. Similar strategies
are underway for organisms that enter via oral or respiratory routes, targeting bacteria that are normal fl ora at
these sites as vectors for the addition of pathogen-specific
genes. Eliciting immunity at the mucosal surface could
provide excellent protection at the portal of entry for
many common infectious agents, such as cholera and
gonorrhea.
DNA Vaccines
A more recent vaccination strategy, called a DNA vaccine,
utilizes plasmid DNA encoding antigenic proteins that are
injected directly into the muscle of the recipient. This
strategy relies on the host cells to take up the DNA and
produce the immunogenic protein in vivo, thus directing
the antigen through endogenous MHC class I presentation
pathways, helping to activate better CTL responses. The
DNA appears either to integrate into the chromosomal
DNA or to be maintained for long periods in an episomal
form, and is often taken up by dendritic cells or muscle cells
in the injection area. Since muscle cells express low levels

the development of antigenic responses to DNA vaccines.
Tests in animal models have shown that DNA vaccines are

pathogens, including influenza and rabies viruses. The addition of a follow-up booster shot with protein antigen (called
a DNA prime and protein boost strategy), or inclusion of
supplementary DNA sequences in the vector, may enhance
the immune response. One sequence that has been added to
some vaccines is the common CpG DNA motif found in
some pathogens; recall that this sequence is the ligand for
TLR9 (see Chapter 5).
DNA vaccines offer some potential advantages over
many of the existing vaccine approaches. Since the encoded
protein is expressed in the host in its natural form—there
is no denaturation or modification—the immune response
is directed to the antigen exactly as it is expressed by the
pathogen, inducing both humoral and cell-mediated
immunity. To stimulate both arms of the adaptive immune
response with non-DNA vaccines normally requires immunization with a live attenuated preparation, which incurs
additional risk. DNA vaccines also induce prolonged
expression of the antigen, enhancing the induction of
immunological memory. Finally, DNA vaccines present
important practical advantages (see Table 17-7). No refrigeration of the plasmid DNA is required, eliminating longterm storage challenges. In addition, the same plasmid
vector can be custom tailored to insert DNA encoding a
variety of proteins, which allows the simultaneous manufacture of a variety of DNA vaccines for different pathogens, saving time and money. An improved method for
administering DNA vaccines entails coating gold microscopic beads with the plasmid DNA and delivery of the
coated particles through the skin into the underlying
muscle with an air gun (called a gene gun). This allows
rapid delivery of vaccine to large populations without the
need for huge numbers of needles and syringes, improving
both safety and cost.
Human trials are underway with several different DNA
vaccines, including those for malaria, HIV, influenza, Ebola,
and herpesvirus, along with several vaccines aimed at cancer
therapy (Table 17-8). Although there are currently no
licensed human DNA vaccines, three such vaccines have
been licensed for veterinary use, including a WNV vaccine
that is protective in horses. This vaccine has been tested in
humans; after three doses, most volunteers demonstrated
titers of neutralizing antibody similar to those seen in
horses, as well as CD8⫹ and CD4⫹ T cell responses against
the virus. Since the widespread development of DNA vaccines for use in humans is still in its early stages, the risks
associated with the use of this strategy are still largely
unknown.

Conjugate or Multivalent Vaccines Can
Improve Immunogenicity and Outcome
One significant drawback to the techniques that do not utilize a live vaccine strategy is that they may induce weak or
limited adaptive responses. To address this, schemes have been
developed that employ the fusing of a highly immunogenic

protein to a weak vaccine immunogen (a conjugate) or mixing
in extraneous proteins (multivalent) to enhance or supplement
immunity to the pathogen.
The vaccine against Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib),
a major cause of bacterial meningitis and infection-induced
deafness in children, is a conjugate formulation included in
the recommended childhood regimen (see Table 17-6). It
consists of type b capsular polysaccharide covalently linked
to a protein carrier, tetanus toxoid (Figure 17-16). Introduction of the conjugate Hib vaccines has resulted in a rapid
decline in Hib cases in the United States and other countries
that have introduced this vaccine. The polysaccharide-protein
conjugate is considerably more immunogenic than the
polysaccharide alone; and because it activates TH cells, it
enables class switching from IgM to IgG. Although this type
of vaccine can induce memory B cells, it cannot induce
memory T cells specific for the pathogen. In the case of the
Hib vaccine, it appears that the memory B cells can be activated to some degree in the absence of a population of
memory TH cells, thus accounting for its efficacy. Like Hib,
the MCV4 vaccine uses a similar strategy and is another

example of a conjugate vaccine that protects young children
from meningitis (see Table 17-6). It is a multivalent vaccine
consisting of individual capsular Neisseria polysaccharide
antigens joined to the highly immunogenic diphtheria toxoid protein.
In a recent study, immunization with ␤-glucan isolated
from brown alga and conjugated to diphtheria toxoid raised
antibodies in mice and rats that protected against challenge
with both Aspergillus fumigatus and Candida albicans. The
protection was transferred by serum or vaginal fluid from
the immunized animals, indicating that the immunity is
antibody based. Infections with fungal pathogens are a serious problem for immunocompromised individuals. The
availability of immunization or antibody treatment could
circumvent problems with toxicity of antifungal drugs and
the emergence of resistant strains, an issue that is especially
important in hospital settings.
Since subunit polysaccharide or protein vaccines tend
to induce humoral but not cell-mediated responses, a
method is needed for constructing vaccines that contain
both immunodominant B-cell and T-cell epitopes. Furthermore, if a CTL response is desired, the vaccine must
be delivered intracellularly so that the peptides can be
processed and presented via class I MHC molecules. One
innovative means of producing a multivalent vaccine that
can deliver many copies of the antigen into cells is to
incorporate antigens into protein micelles, lipid vesicles
(called liposomes), or immunostimulating complexes
(Figure 17-17a). Mixing proteins in detergent and then
removing the detergent forms micelles. The individual
proteins orient themselves with their hydrophilic residues
toward the aqueous environment and the hydrophobic

residues at the center to exclude their interaction with the
aqueous environment. Protein-containing liposomes are
prepared by mixing the proteins with a suspension of
phospholipids under conditions that form lipid bilayer
vesicles; the proteins are incorporated into the bilayer with
the hydrophilic residues exposed. Immunostimulating
complexes (ISCOMs) are lipid carriers prepared by mixing
protein with detergent and a glycoside called Quil A, an
adjuvant. Membrane proteins from various pathogens,
including influenza virus, measles virus, hepatitis B virus,
and HIV, have been incorporated into micelles, liposomes,
and ISCOMs and are being assessed as potential vaccines.
In addition to their increased immunogenicity, liposomes
and ISCOMs appear to fuse with the plasma membrane to
deliver the antigen intracellularly, where it can be processed by the endogenous pathway, leading to CTL
responses (Figure 17-17b).

Adjuvants Are Included to Enhance the
Immune Response to a Vaccine
In an ideal case, vaccines mimic most of the key immunologic events that occur during a natural infection, eliciting
strong and comprehensive immune responses but without
the risks associated with live agents. A discussion of vaccines
would be incomplete without mentioning the importance of
adjuvants, substances that are added to vaccine preparations
to enhance the immune response to the antigen or pathogen
with which they are mixed. This is especially important
when the vaccine preparation is a pathogen subunit or other
nonliving form of the organism, where immunogenicity can
be quite low. These additives mixed with the vaccines, such
as those described above, can both enhance the immune
response and help with delivery of the vaccine to the
immune system.
For almost 80 years, the only adjuvant used in human
vaccines was aluminum salts (called alum), a fairly good
enhancer of TH2 responses but a weaker stimulator of TH1
pathways. Alum is mixed in an emulsion with the immunogen and is primarily thought to work by creating slow release
delivery of the immunogen at the injection site, which helps
in sustained stimulation of the immune response. It may also
help to recruit APCs and encourage the formation of large
antigen complexes that are more likely to be phagocytosed
by these cells.
In recent years, two new adjuvants have been licensed for
use in human vaccines. One, MF59, is an oil-in-water emulsion that, like alum, is believed to aid in slow antigen delivery. The other, AS04, contains alum plus a TLR4 agonist.
TLR4 is a PRR for bacterial lipopolysaccharides (LPS), and
signaling by this adjuvant ultimately encourages TH1
responses. AS04 is currently used in vaccines against HPV
and HSV-2. All of these adjuvants have been found to
enhance the production of antibodies as compared to unadjuvanted vaccine preparations.
Some creative uses of existing adjuvants and next generation adjuvants or immune modulators are also under
development. These include compounds designed to stimulate certain PRRs—specifically, several TLRs and at least
one NOD-like receptor. Although adjuvants have improved
humoral immunity, few if any actually enhance cellular
immunity, especially CD8⫹ T-cell responses. Recently, a
combination of two already licensed adjuvant components
was used in mice treated with an influenza virus peptide
and was found to generate protective CD8⫹ T-cell memory
responses. This strategy is attractive, as it utilizes adjuvants
with an already established track record of safety and efficacy in humans. One very recent and particularly novel
strategy utilizes a subunit vaccine followed by a chemokine,
aimed at eliciting protective immunity and then moving the
immune cells to the relevant mucosal surface (see Advances
Box 17-2).

The Immune System in Health and Disease

BOX 17-2

ADVANCES

A Prime and Pull Vaccine Strategy for Preventing
Sexually Transmitted Diseases
Most

pathogens breach the physical
barriers of the body at mucosal surfaces,
such as the gastrointestinal, respiratory, or
genital tracts. Therefore, some form of
protective immunity stationed at these
portals would be the most effective
means of interrupting infection by such
pathogens. However, until recently the
nuances of the specialized secondary
lymphoid structures that serve these surfaces (collectively referred to as mucosal
associated lymphoid tissues, or MALT)
and the unique mechanisms of establishing and maintaining adaptive immune
memory at these structures have not
been fully appreciated. Traditional vaccination strategies, such as subcutaneous
injection of antigen, often fail to elicit
protective IgA responses at mucosal sites
but instead drive the development of
serum IgG, which is less protective against
most mucosally encountered pathogens.
Positioning protective immunity at
mucosal sites of entry is being studied in
the design of vaccines to protect against
sexually transmitted infections (STIs).
According to the WHO, there are more
than 30 different sexually acquired pathogens, including viral, bacterial, and parasitic organisms. It is estimated that up to 1
million people become infected with an
STI every day! STIs are one of the top five
reasons for individuals to seek health care
in developing countries, and 30% to 40%

of female infertility is linked to postinfection damage of the fallopian tubes. The
most common STIs are chlamydia, gonorrhea, syphilis, hepatitis B, and HIV. Worldwide, these STIs take their greatest toll on
young women of childbearing age. Based
on anatomy, women are more likely to
become infected following unprotected
sex with a carrier, whereas men are more
likely to transmit these infections through
semen. Although many of these infections are treatable, an absence of or delay
in symptoms means that many unwitting
carriers transmit infection to their partners. Even low levels of genital infection
can increase the likelihood of transmission of new STIs, including HIV.
Establishing and maintaining memory
cells that home to the genital tract and can
protect against STIs is difficult. In experimental systems, intranasal or intravaginal
immunogen delivery has been shown to
elicit antigen-specific T- and B-cell responses
that traffic to the female genital tract, where
protective IgA can also be found. However,
as in the case of HIV, the ideal vaccine would
recruit antigen-specific CD8⫹ T cells and IgAsecreting B cells to the genital tract, but not
activated CD4⫹ T cells. The latter are potential targets for new infections and could
therefore inadvertently enhance transmission rates in vaccinees.
Akiko Iwasaki’s group at Yale University
has recently applied a new vaccine strat-

egy called “prime and pull” in a mouse
model of genital herpes. They used a conventional subcutaneous injection of attenuated HSV-2 to prime systemic T cell
responses in mice, followed by a topical
application of the chemokine CXCL9 to the
vaginal canal of the mice. This chemokine
resulted in the specific recruitment of
effector T cells with a memory phenotype
to the mucosal tissues of the vagina: the
“pull.” Mice treated with this prime and pull
strategy showed a significant increase in
survival after challenge with live herpesvirus compared with mice that received only
the priming vaccine injection.
If this scheme proves safe and effective
in human trials, the pull arm of this approach
could theoretically be appended to conventional vaccines already approved for use
in humans, shortening the lengthy pipeline
for most “new” vaccines. Likewise, the chemotactic agent could be modified to recruit
different target cells, or applied to other
mucosal tissues, reeling in the memory cells
elicited from existing vaccines directly to
the sites most in need of protection.

■

Physical barriers, such as the skin and mucosal secretions,
can block infection. Innate immune responses form the
initial defense against pathogens that breach these barriers. These include the nonspecific production of complement components, phagocytic cells, and certain cytokines
that are elicited in response to local infection by various
pathogens.

■

■

The immune response to viral infections involves both
humoral and cell-mediated components. Some viruses
mutate rapidly and and/or have acquired specific mechanisms to evade parts of the innate or adaptive immune
response to them.
The immune response to extracellular bacterial infections
is generally mediated by antibody. Antibody can activate

complement-mediated lysis of the bacterium, neutralize
toxins, and serve as an opsonin to increase phagocytosis.
Host defense against intracellular bacteria depends largely
on CD4⫹ T-cell-mediated responses.
Parasites are a very broad infectious disease category. Both
humoral and cell-mediated immune responses have been
implicated in immunity to protozoan infections. In general, humoral antibody is effective against blood-borne
stages of the protozoan life cycle, but once protozoans
have infected host cells, cell-mediated immunity is necessary. Protozoans escape the immune response through
several evasion strategies.
Helminths are large parasites that normally do not multiply
within human hosts. Only low levels of immunity are
induced to these organisms, partly because so few organisms are carried by an affected individual or exposed to the
immune system. Helminths can form chronic infections
and generally are attacked by antibody-mediated defenses.
Fungal diseases, or mycoses, are rarely severe in normal,
healthy individuals but pose a greater problem for those
with immunodeficiency. Both innate immunity and
adaptive immunity control infection by fungi.
Emerging and re-emerging pathogens include some newly
described organisms and others previously thought to
have been controlled by public health practices. Factors
leading to the emergence of such pathogens include
increased travel, poor sanitation, and intense crowding of
some populations.
A state of immunity can be induced by passive or active
immunization. Short-term passive immunization is
induced by the transfer of preformed antibodies. Natural
infection or vaccination can induce active immunization
and lead to long-term immunity.

■

Five types of vaccines are currently used or under experimental consideration in humans: live, attenuated (avirulent) microorganisms; inactivated (killed) microorganisms;
purified macromolecules (subunits); viral vectors carrying
recombinant genes (live, recombinant); and DNA vaccines.

■

Realizing the optimum benefit of vaccines will require
cheaper manufacture and improved delivery methods for
existing vaccines.
Live vaccines (either attenuated or viral vectors) have the
advantage of inducing both humoral and cell-mediated
immunity, and can produce more effective overall protective immunity. However, live, attenuated vaccines carry
the risk of reversion, which is not an issue with recombinant forms.
Isolated protein components of pathogens expressed in
cell culture can be used to create effective vaccines, especially when the toxic effects of the pathogen are due to
discrete protein products.

■

■

■

■

■

Polysaccharide and other less immunogenic vaccines may
be conjugated to more immunogenic proteins to enhance
or maximize the immune response.
Introduction of plasmid DNA encoding protein antigens
from a pathogen can be used to induce both humoral and
cell-mediated responses. Such DNA vaccines for several
diseases are presently in human clinical trials.
Adjuvants are substances added to vaccine preparations
that help aid in delivery of the vaccine to the immune
system and that enhance responses. A new generation of
adjuvants are being developed that target specific pattern
recognition receptors (PRRs) or that modify responses in
ways that may help to direct the immune response toward
more protective pathways.

from one year to the next. However, although we are being
exposed to these “modified” influenza strains every year, we
do not always come down with the flu, even when the virus
successfully breaches physical barriers. Sometimes, we do get
a really bad case of the flu, despite the fact that we presumably
have memory cells left from an earlier primary response to
influenza. Aside from higher doses of virus and the possibility of a particularly pathogenic strain, why is it that some
years we get very sick and other years we do not? For example, I might get a bad case of the flu while you experience no
disease, and yet we are both being exposed to the exact same
virus strain that year. What is happening here? Assume that
you are not receiving the yearly influenza vaccine.

or pertussis?

ANALYZE THE DATA T. W. Kim and coworkers (Enhancing

DNA vaccine potency by combining a strategy to prolong
dendritic cell life with intracellular targeting strategies. Journal of Immunology 171:2970, 2003) investigated methods to
enhance the immune response against human papillomavirus (HPV)16 E7 antigen. Groups of mice were vaccinated
with the following antigens incorporated in DNA vaccine
constructs:
• ⫹ HPV E7 antigen
• ⫹ E7 ⫹ heat-shock protein 70 (HSP70)
• ⫹ E7 ⫹ calreticulin
• ⫹ E7 ⫹ Sorting signal of lysosome-associated membrane protein 1 (Sig/LAMP-1)
A second array of mice received the same DNA vaccines and
was coadministered an additional DNA construct incorporating the anti-apoptosis gene Bcl-xL. To test the efficacy of these
DNA vaccine constructs in inducing a host response, spleen
cells from vaccinated mice were harvested 7 days after injection,
the cells were incubated overnight in vitro with MHC class I–
restricted E7 peptide (aa 49–57), and then the cells were stained
for both CD8 and IFN-␥ (part (a) of the figure on the following

Immunodeficiency
Disorders

L

ike any complex multicomponent system, the
immune system can be subject to failures of some
or all of its parts. These failures can have dire
consequences. When the system loses its sense of
self and begins to attack the host’s own cells, the result is
autoimmunity, described in Chapter 16. When the
system errs by failing to protect the host from diseasecausing agents, the result is immunodeficiency, the
subject of this chapter.
Immunodeficiency resulting from an inherited genetic
or developmental defect in the immune system is called a
primary immunodeficiency. In such a condition, the
defect is present at birth, although it may not manifest
until later in life. These diseases can be caused by defects
in virtually any gene involved in immune development or
function, innate or adaptive, humoral or cell mediated,
plus genes not previously associated with immunity. As
one can imagine, the nature of the component(s) that
fail(s) determines the degree and type of the immune
defect; some immunodeficiency disorders are relatively
minor, requiring little or no treatment, although others
can be life threatening and necessitate major intervention.
Secondary immunodeficiency, also known as
acquired immunodeficiency, is the loss of immune
function that results from exposure to an external agent,
often an infection. Although several external factors can
affect immune function, by far the most well-known
secondary immunodeficiency is acquired
immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), which results
from infection with the human immunodeficiency virus
(HIV). A global summary of the AIDS epidemic
conducted by the Joint United Nations Programme on
HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS) shows that by the end of 2011 (the
most recent data available) over 34 million people were
living with HIV and 2.5 million new infections occurred
in just that year (330,000 of them in children under age
15 years). In 2011, AIDS killed approximately 1.7 million
people. The good news is that, largely thanks to increased
access to antiretroviral drugs, this was roughly a 24%
decrease in the rate of AIDS-related deaths as compared
to just 6 years earlier. People with AIDS, like individuals

with severe inherited immunodeficiency, are at risk of
opportunistic infections, caused by microorganisms that
healthy individuals can easily eradicate but that cause
disease and even death in those with significantly
impaired immune function.
The first part of this chapter describes the most
common primary immunodeficiencies, examines progress
in identifying new defects that can lead to these types of
disorders, and considers approaches to their study and
treatment. The rest of the chapter describes acquired
immunodeficiency, with a focus on HIV infection and
AIDS, along with the current status of therapeutic and
prevention strategies for combating this often fatal
disorder.

Primary Immunodeficiencies
To date, over 150 different types of primary, or inherited,
immunodeficiency have been identified. Theoretically, any
component important to immune function that is defective
can lead to some form of immunodeficiency. Collectively,
primary immunodeficiency disorders (PIDs) have helped
immunologists to appreciate the importance of specific cellular events or proteins that are required for proper immune
system function. Most of these disorders are monogenic, or

FIGURE 18-1 Distribution of primary immunodeficiencies by type. Primary immunodeficiency can involve either innate
processes (phagocytosis, complement, or other defects) or the adaptive immune response (humoral, cellular, or both). Of these categories,
adaptive immune disruptions are the most common, with antibody
defects making up the largest portion of these. [Song et al., 2011, Clinical
and Molecular Allergy 9:10. doi:10.1186/1476-7961-9-10]

caused by defects in a single gene, and are extremely rare.
Primary immunodeficiency diseases vary in severity from
mild to nearly fatal. They can be loosely categorized as affecting either innate immunity or adaptive responses, and are
often grouped by the specific components of the immune
system most affected (Figure 18-1). The most common
forms of primary immunodeficiency, and frequently the
least severe, are those that impair one or more antibody isotype. However, due to the complex interconnections of the
immune response, defects in one pathway can also manifest
in other arms of the immune response, and different gene
defects can produce the same phenotype, making strict categorization complicated.
The cellular consequences of a particular gene disruption
depend on the specific immune system component involved
and the severity of the disruption (Figure 18-2). Defects that
interrupt early hematopoietic cell development affect everything downstream of this step, as is the case for reticular
dysgenesis, a disease in which all hematopoietic cell survival
is impaired. Defects in more highly differentiated downstream compartments of the immune system, such as in
selective immunoglobulin deficiencies, have consequences
that tend to be more specific and usually less severe. In some
cases, the loss of a gene not specifically associated with
immunity has been found to have undue influence on cells
of the hematopoietic lineage, such as the lymphoid cell
destruction seen in adenosine deaminase deficiency (ADA),
which disables both B and T cells, leading to a form of severe
combined immunodeficiency. Decreased production of
phagocytes, such as neutrophils, or the inhibition of phagocytic processes typically manifest as increased susceptibility
to bacterial or fungal infections, as seen in defects that affect
various cells within the myeloid lineage (Figure 18-2,

orange). In general, defects in the T-cell components of the
immune system tend to have a greater overall impact on the
immune response than genetic mutations that affect only
B cells or innate responses. This is due to the pivotal role of
T cells in directing downstream immune events, and occurs
because defects in this cell type often affect both humoral
and cell-mediated responses.
Immunodeficiency disorders can also stem from developmental defects that alter a specific organ. This is most commonly seen in sufferers of DiGeorge syndrome, where T-cell
development is hindered by a congenital defect that blocks
growth of the thymus. Since many B-cell responses require
T-cell help, most of the adaptive immune response is compromised in patients who suffer the complete form of the
disease in which little or no thymic tissue is present, even
though B cells are intact. Finally, a more recent category of
immunodeficiency syndrome has come to light, illustrating
the importance of immune regulation, or “the brakes” of the
immune system. APECED and IPEX are both immunodeficiency disorders that result in overactive immune responses,
or autoimmunity, due to the dysregulation of self-reactive T
cells. Some of the most well-characterized primary immunodeficiency disorders with known genetic causes are listed
in Table 18-1, along with the specific gene defect and resulting immune impairment.
The nature of the immune defect will determine which
groups of pathogens are most challenging to individuals who
inherit these immunodeficiency disorders (Table 18-2).
Inherited defects that impair B cells, resulting in depressed
expression of one or more of the antibody classes, are typically characterized by recurring bacterial infections. These
symptoms are similar to those exhibited by some of the individuals who inherit mutations in genes that encode complement components. Phagocytes are so important for the
removal of fungi and bacteria that individuals with disruptions of phagocytic function suffer from more of these types
of infections. Finally, the pivotal role of the T cell in orchestrating the direction of the immune response means that
disruptions to the performance of this cell type can have
wide-ranging effects, including depressed antibody production, dysregulation of cytokine expression, and impaired
cellular cytotoxicity. In some instances, such as when T- and
B-cell responses to self are not properly regulated, autoimmunity can become the primary symptom.
The first part of this section on primary immunodeficiency diseases looks at defects within adaptive immunity,
starting with the most extreme cases, characterized by
defects to T cells, B cells, or both. This is followed by a discussion of disruptions to innate responses, including cells of
the myeloid lineage, receptors important for innate immunity, and complement defects. The autoimmune consequences stemming from dysregulation of the immune
system are also described. Finally, we look at the current
treatment options available to affected individuals and the
use of animal models of primary immunodeficiency in basic
immunology research.

Combined Immunodeficiencies Disrupt
Adaptive Immunity
Among the most severe forms of inherited immunodeficiency are a group of disorders termed combined immunodeficiences (CIDs): diseases resulting from an absence of
T cells or significantly impaired T-cell function, combined
with some disruption of antibody responses. Defects within
the T-cell compartment generally also affect the humoral
system because TH cells are typically required for complete
B-cell activation, antibody production, and isotype switching.
Therefore, some depression in the level of one or more antibody isotypes and an associated increase in susceptibility to
bacterial infection are common with CIDs. T-cell impairment can lead to a reduction in both delayed-type hypersensitivity responses and cell-mediated cytotoxicity, resulting in
increased susceptibility to almost all types of infectious
agents, but especially viruses, protozoa, and fungi. For
instance, infections with species of Mycobacteria are common in CID patients, reflecting the importance of T cells in
eliminating intracellular pathogens. Likewise, viruses that are
otherwise rarely pathogenic (such as cytomegalovirus or
even live, attenuated measles vaccine) may be life threatening
for individuals with CIDs. The following section first discusses the most severe CIDs, such as when there is an absence
of both T and B cells, followed by less severe forms of the
disease, in which more minor disruptions to particular components of the T- and B-cell compartments are observed.
Severe Combined Immunodeficiency (SCID)
The most extreme forms of CID make up a family of disorders termed severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID).

These stem from genetic defects that lead to a virtual or
absolute lack of functional T cells in the periphery. As a general rule, these defects target steps that occur early in T-cell
development or that affect the stem cells that feed the lymphoid lineage. The four general categories of events that have
been found to result in SCID include the following:
1.

Defective cytokine signaling in T-cell precursors, caused
by mutations in certain cytokines, cytokine receptors, or
regulatory molecules that control their expression

2.

Premature death of the lymphoid lineage due to accumulation of toxic metabolites, caused by defects in the purine
metabolism pathways

3.

Defective V(D)J rearrangement in developing lymphocytes, caused by mutations in the genes for RAG1 and
RAG2, or other proteins involved in the rearrangement
process

4.

Disruptions in pre-TCR or TCR signaling during development, caused by mutations in tyrosine kinases, adapter
molecules, downstream messengers, or transcription
factors involved in TCR signaling

Depending on the underlying genetic defect, an individual with SCID may have a loss of only T cells (T⫺B⫹) or both
T and B cells (T⫺B⫺). In either case, both cellular and
humoral immunity are either severely depressed or absent.
Clinically, SCID is characterized by a very low number of
circulating lymphocytes and a failure to mount immune
responses mediated by T cells. In many cases, the thymus
will not fully develop without a sufficient number of T cells,
and the few circulating T cells present in some SCID patients

The Immune System in Health and Disease

often do not respond to stimulation by mitogens, indicating
that they cannot proliferate in response to antigens. In many
cases, myeloid and erythroid cells (red-blood-cell precursors) appear normal in number and function, indicating that
only lymphoid cells are affected.
Infants born with SCID experience severe recurrent
infections that, without early, aggressive treatment, can
quickly prove fatal. Although both the T and B lineages may
be affected, the initial manifestation in these infants is typically infection by fungi or viruses that are normally dealt
with by cellular immune responses. This is because antibody
deficits can be masked in the first few months of life by the
presence of passive antibodies derived from transplacental
circulation or breast milk. Infants with SCID often suffer
from chronic diarrhea, recurrent respiratory infections, and
a general failure to thrive. The life span of these children can
be prolonged by preventing contact with all potentially
harmful microorganisms—for example, by confinement in a
sterile atmosphere. However, extraordinary effort is required
to prevent contact with all opportunistic microorganisms;
any object, including food, that comes in contact with the
sequestered SCID patient must first be sterilized. Such isolation is feasible only as a temporary measure, pending
replacement therapy treatments and/or bone marrow transplantation (more on these below).
The immune system is so compromised in SCID patients
that common microbes and even live-attenuated vaccines
can cause persistent infection and life-threatening disease.
For this reason, it is important to diagnose SCID early, especially prior to the administration of live vaccines, such as the
rotavirus vaccine, which is recommended at 2 months of age
(see Chapter 17). A screening test for SCID has been developed that utilizes the standard blood samples collected from
neonates via heel or finger pricks. This rapid polymerase
chain reaction (PCR)-based assay looks for evidence of gene
recombination as in excised DNA from the TCR or BCR
locus, called T-cell receptor excision circles (TRECs) and
␬-deleting recombination excision circles (KRECs). In 2010,
recommendations to screen every newborn for SCID were
approved. To date, approximately half of the babies born in
the United States receive standard newborn screening for
SCID, before live vaccines are administered and when the
implementation of aggressive therapy is most beneficial.
Deficiency in cytokine signaling is at the root of the most
common forms of SCID, and defects in the gene encoding
the common gamma (␥) chain of the IL-2 receptor (IL2RG;
see Figure 4-8) are the most frequent culprits. This particular
form of immunodeficiency is often referred to as X-linked
SCID (or SCIDX1) because the affected gene is located on
the X chromosome, and the disorder is thus more common
in males. Defects in this chain impede signaling not only
through IL-2R but also through receptors for IL-4, -7, -9,
-15, and -21, all of which use this chain in their structures.
This leads to widespread defects in B-, T-, and NK-cell development. Although this chain was first identified as a part of
the IL-2 receptor, impaired IL-7 signaling is likely the source

FIGURE 18-3 Defects in lymphocyte development and
signaling can lead to severe combined immunodeficiency
(SCID). SCID may result from defects in the recombination-activating
genes (RAG1 and RAG2) or the DNA excision-repair pathway (e.g., Artemis) required for synthesis of the functional immunoglobulins and
T-cell receptors in developing lymphocytes. Likewise, defects in the
common ␥ chain of receptors for IL-2, -4, -7, -9, and -15, required for
the hematopoietic development of lymphocytes, or JAK-3, which
transduces these signals (not shown), can also lead to SCID.
of both T-and B-cell developmental defects, while lack of
IL-15 signaling is believed to account for the block to NK
cells (Figure 18-3). Deficiency in the kinase JAK-3, which
associates with the cytoplasmic region of the common
gamma (␥) chain, can produce a phenotype similar to
X-linked SCID, as this enzyme is required for the intracellular signaling cascade utilized by all of these cytokine receptors (see Chapter 4).
Defects in the pathways involved in the recombination
events that produce immunoglobulin and T-cell receptors
highlight the importance of early signaling through these
receptors for lymphocyte survival. Mutations in the recombinase activating genes (RAG1 and RAG2) and genes encoding proteins involved in the DNA excision-repair pathways
employed during gene rearrangement (e.g., Artemis) can
also lead to SCID (see Figure 18-3). In these cases, production of antigen-specific receptors is blocked at the pre-T- and
pre-B-cell receptor stages of development, leading to a virtual absence of functioning T and B cells, while leaving the
numbers and function of NK cells largely intact (see Clinical
Focus Box 7-3).
Another relatively common defect resulting in SCID is
adenosine deaminase (ADA) deficiency. Adenosine deaminase catalyzes conversion of adenosine or deoxyadenosine to
inosine or deoxyinosine, respectively. Its deficiency results in

c18Immunodeficiency Disorders.indd Page 599 12/20/12 7:02 PM user-t044

Immunodeficiency Disorders
the intracellular accumulation of toxic adenosine metabolites, which interferes with purine metabolism and DNA
synthesis. This housekeeping enzyme is found in all cells, so
these toxic compounds also produce neurologic and metabolic symptoms, including deafness, behavioral problems,
and liver damage. Defects in T, B, and NK cells are due to
toxic metabolite-induced apoptosis of lymphoid precursors
in primary lymphoid organs. Deficiency in another purine
salvage pathway enzyme, purine nucleoside phosphorylase
(PNP), produces a similar phenotype via much the same
mechanism.
In some instances, the genetic defects associated with
SCID lead to perturbations in hematopoiesis. In reticular
dysgenesis (RD), the initial stages of hematopoietic cell
development are blocked by defects in the adenylate kinase
2 gene (AK2), favoring apoptosis of myeloid and lymphoid
precursors and resulting in severe reductions in circulating
leukocytes (see Figure 18-2). The resulting general failure
leads to impairment of both innate and adaptive immunity,
resulting in susceptibility to infection by all types of microorganisms. Without aggressive treatment, babies with this
very rare form of SCID usually die in early infancy from
uncontrolled infection.
MHC Defects That Can Resemble SCID
A failure to express MHC molecules can lead to general failures of immunity that resemble SCID without directly
impacting lymphocytes themselves. For example, without
class II MHC molecules, positive selection of CD4⫹ T cells
in the thymus is impaired, and with it, peripheral T helper
cell responses are impaired. This type of immunodeficiency
is called bare-lymphocyte syndrome and is the topic of
Clinical Focus Box 8-4. The important and ubiquitous role of
class I MHC molecules is highlighted in patients with defective class I expression. This rare immunodeficiency disorder
can be caused by mutations in the TAP genes, which are vital
to antigen processing and presentation by class I MHC molecules (see Figure 8-17). This defect, which typically allows
for some residual expression of class I molecules, results in
impaired positive selection of CD8⫹ T cells, depressed cellmediated immunity, and heightened susceptibility to viral
infection.
Developmental Defects of the Thymus
Some immunodeficiency syndromes affecting T cells are
grounded in failure of the thymus to undergo normal development. These thymic malfunctions can have subtle to profound outcomes on T-cell function, depending on the nature
of the defect. DiGeorge syndrome (DGS), also called velocardiofacial syndrome, is one example. This disorder typically results from various deletions in a region on
chromosome 22 containing up to 50 genes, with the T-box
transcription factor (TBX1) thought to be most influential.
This transcription factor is highly expressed during particular stages of embryonic development, when facial structures,

heart, thyroid, parathyroid, and thymus tissues are forming
(Figure 18-4). For this reason, the syndrome is sometimes
also called the third and fourth pharyngeal pouch syndrome.
Not surprisingly, DGS patients present with symptoms of
immunodeficiency, hypoparathyroidism, and congenital
heart anomalies, where the latter are typically the most critical. Although most DGS sufferers show some degree of
immunodeficiency, the degree varies widely. In very rare
cases of complete DGS, where no thymic tissue develops,
severe depression of T-cell numbers and poor antibody
responses due to lack of T-cell help leave patients susceptible
to all types of opportunistic pathogens. Thymic transplantation and passive antibody treatment can be of value to these
individuals, although severe heart disease can limit longterm survival even when the immune defects are corrected.
In the majority of DGS patients, in which some residual
thymic tissue develops and functional T cells are found in
the periphery, treatments to avoid bacterial infection, such
as antibiotics, are often sufficient to compensate for the
immune defects.
Wiskott-Aldrich Syndrome (WAS)
Although SCID is caused by genetic defects that result in the
loss of T cells or major T-cell impairment, a number of other
CIDs can result from less severe disruptions to T-cell function. The defect in patients suffering from Wiskott-Aldrich
syndrome (WAS) occurs in an X-linked gene named for this
disease (WASP), which encodes a cytoskeletal protein highly

The Immune System in Health and Disease

expressed in hematopoietic cells (see Table 18-1). The WAS
protein (WASP) is required for assembly and reorganization
of actin filaments in cells of the hematopoietic lineage, events
critical to proper immune synapse formation and intracellular
signaling. Clinical manifestations, which usually appear early
in the first year of life, vary widely and severity depends on
the specific mutation, but eczema and thrombocytopenia
(low platelet counts and smaller than normal platelets, which
can result in near fatal bleeding) are both common. Humoral
defects, including lower than normal levels of IgM, as well as
impaired cell-mediated immunity, are also common features. WAS patients often experience recurrent bacterial
infections, especially by encapsulated strains such as S.
pneumoniae, H. influenzae type b (Hib), and S. aureus. As
the disease develops, autoimmunity and B-cell malignancy
are not uncommon, suggesting that regulatory T-cell functions are also impaired. Mild forms of the disease can be
treated by targeting the symptoms—transfusions for bleeding and passive antibodies or antibiotics for bacterial infections—but severe cases and long-term corrective measures
require hematopoietic stem cell transfer.
Hyper IgM Syndrome
An inherited deficiency in CD40 ligand (CD40L or CD154)
leads to impaired communication between T cells and
antigen-presenting cells (APCs), highlighting the role of this
surface molecule in this costimulatory process. In this
X-linked disorder, TH cells fail to express functional CD40L
on their plasma membrane, which typically interacts with
the CD40 molecule present on B cells and dendritic cells
(DCs). This costimulatory engagement is required for APC
activation, and its absence in B cells interferes with class
switching, B-cell responses to T-dependent antigens, and the
production of memory cells (Figure 18-5). The B-cell
response to T-independent antigens, however, is unaffected,
accounting for the presence of IgM antibodies in these
patients, which range from normal to high levels and give
the disorder its common name, hyper IgM syndrome
(HIM). Without class switching or hypermutation, patients
make very low levels of all other antibody isotypes and fail to
produce germinal centers during a humoral response, which
highlights the role of the CD40-CD40L interaction in the

generation of these structures. Because CD40-CD40L interactions are also required for DC maturation and IL-12
secretion, defects in this pathway result in increased susceptibility to intracellular pathogens. Affected children
therefore suffer from a range of recurrent infections, especially in the respiratory tract. Although this form of immunodeficiency results in alterations in antibody production
and presents with symptoms similar to HIM variants seen in
the next section on antibody deficiencies, it is classified as a
CID. This is because the underlying deficiency is present in
T cells, leading to a secondary defect in B-cell activation.
Several other recessively inherited variants of HIM syndrome have been linked to downstream events, such as
mutations in one of the enzymes involved in class switching,
with the net result of depressed production of all antibody
isotypes except IgM.
Hyper IgE Syndrome (Job Syndrome)
Another primary immunodeficiency is characterized by skin
abscesses, recurrent pneumonia, eczema, and elevated levels
of IgE, accompanied by facial abnormalities and bone fragility. This multisystem disorder, known as hyper IgE syndrome (HIE), is most frequently caused by an autosomal
dominant mutation in the STAT3 gene. This gene is involved
in the intracellular signaling cascade induced by IL-6 and
TGF-␤ receptor ligation, and is important for TH17 cell differentiation (see Figure 11-11). Its absence is thought to lead
to dysregulation of TH pathway development and may be the
reason for overproduction of IgE. Patients with Job syndrome have lower-than-normal levels of circulating TH17
cells, and naïve cells isolated from these individuals are not
capable of producing IL-17 or IL-22 in response to antigenic
stimulation. Depressed TH17 responses, which are important for clearance of fungal and extracellular bacterial infections, explain the susceptibility of these patients to C.
albicans and S. aureus. STAT3 defects also inhibit IL-10 signaling and the development of regulatory T cells, which is
evident in the reduction of induced TREG cells in these
patients. Although STAT3 is involved in the signal transduction of many cytokines and therefore could play a role in the
elevation of IgE in these patients, no clear mechanism for
this has been defined.

of APC-T cell interactions can give rise

CD40/CD40L costimulation between T cells
and APCs lead to a block in APC maturation.
In B cells, this manifests as a defect in class
switching, leading to elevated levels of IgM
and no other isotypes (called hyperIgM
syndrome, or HIM). In DCs, this blocks maturation and the secretion of costimulatory
cytokines, such as IL-12, which are important
for T-cell differentiation.

Immunodeficiency Disorders

B-Cell Immunodeficiencies Exhibit Depressed
Production of One or More Antibody Isotypes
Immunodeficiency disorders caused by B-cell defects make
up a diverse spectrum of diseases ranging from the complete
absence of mature recirculating B cells, plasma cells, and
immunoglobulin, to the selective absence of only certain
classes of immunoglobulins. Patients with inherited B-cell
defects are usually subject to recurrent bacterial infections
but display normal immunity to most viral and fungal infections because the T-cell branch of the immune system is
largely unaffected. In patients with these types of immunodeficiencies, the most common infections are caused by
encapsulated bacteria such as staphylococci, streptococci,
and pneumococci, because antibody is critical for the opsonization and clearance of these organisms. Although the
underlying defects have been identified for some of these
conditions, several of the more common deficiencies, such
as common variable immunodeficiency and selective IgA
deficiency, appear to involve multiple genes and a continuum of phenotypes.
X-Linked Agammaglobulinemia
X-linked agammaglobulinemia (X-LA), or Bruton’s hypogammaglobulinemia, is characterized by extremely low IgG
levels and by the absence of other immunoglobulin classes.
Babies born with this disorder have virtually no peripheral
B cells (⬍ 1%) and suffer from recurrent bacterial infections.
X-LA is caused by a defect in Bruton’s tyrosine kinase (Btk),
which is required for signal transduction through the BCR
(see Figure 3-28 and Clinical Focus Box 3-2). Without functional Btk, B-cell development in the bone marrow is
arrested at the pro-B- to pre-B-cell stage, and the B lymphocytes in these patients remain in the pre-B stage, with heavy
chains rearranged but light chains in their germ-line configuration. Present-day use of antibiotics and replacement
therapy in the form of passively administered antibodies can
make this disease quite manageable.
Common Variable Immunodeficiency Disorders
The defects underlying the complex group of diseases
belonging to this category are more different than they are
similar. However, sufferers of common variable immunodeficiency disorders (CVIDs) do share recurrent infection
resulting from immunodeficiency, marked by reduction in
the levels of one or more antibody isotype and impaired
B-cell responses to antigen, all with no other known cause.
This condition can manifest in childhood or later in life,
when it is sometimes called late-onset hypogammaglobulinemia or, incorrectly, acquired hypogammaglobulinemia.
Respiratory tract infection by common bacterial strains is
the most common symptom, and can be controlled by
administration of immunoglobulin. Most cases of CVID
have undefined genetic causes, and most patients have normal numbers of B cells, suggesting that B-cell development

is not the underlying defect in most cases. Reflecting the
diversity of this set of diseases, inheritance can follow autosomal recessive or autosomal dominant patterns, although
most cases are sporadic. Several different proteins involving
various steps of the B-cell activation cascade have been
implicated in recent years.
Selective IgA Deficiency
A number of immunodeficiency states are characterized by
significantly lowered amounts of specific immunoglobulin
isotypes. Of these, IgA deficiency is by far the most common, affecting approximately 1 in 700. Individuals with
selective IgA deficiency typically exhibit normal levels of
other antibody isotypes and may enjoy a full life span, troubled only by a greater-than-normal susceptibility to infections of the respiratory and genitourinary tracts, the primary
sites of IgA secretion. Family-association studies have shown
that IgA deficiency sometimes occurs in the same families as
CVID, suggesting some overlap in causation. The spectrum
of clinical symptoms of IgA deficiency is broad; most of
those affected are asymptomatic (up to 70%), whereas others
may suffer from an assortment of serious complications.
Problems such as intestinal malabsorption, allergic disease,
and autoimmune disorders can be associated with low IgA
levels. The reasons for this variability in the clinical profile
are not clear but may relate to the ability of some, but not all,
patients to substitute IgM for IgA as a mucosal antibody. The
defect in IgA deficiency is related to the inability of IgAexpressing B cells to undergo normal differentiation to the
plasma-cell stage. A gene or genes outside of the immunoglobulin gene complex is suspected of being responsible for
this fairly common syndrome.

Disruptions to Innate Components May Also
Impact Adaptive Responses
Most innate immune defects are caused by problems in the
myeloid-cell lineage or in complement (see Figure 18-2).
Most of these defects result in depressed numbers of phagocytic cells or defects in the phagocytic process that are
manifested by recurrent microbial infection of greater or
lesser severity. The phagocytic processes may be faulty at
several stages, including cell motility, adherence to and
phagocytosis of organisms, and intracellular killing by macrophages.
Leukocyte Adhesion Deficiency
As described in Chapter 3, cell-surface molecules belonging
to the integrin family of proteins function as adhesion molecules and are required to facilitate cellular interaction.
Three of these, LFA-1, Mac-1, and gp150/95 (CD11a, b, and
c, respectively), have a common ␤ chain (CD18) and are
variably present on different monocytic cells; CD11a is also
expressed on B cells. An immunodeficiency related to dysfunction of the adhesion molecules is rooted in a defect

The Immune System in Health and Disease

localized to the common ␤ chain and affects expression of all
three of the molecules that use this chain. This defect, called
leukocyte adhesion deficiency (LAD), causes susceptibility
to infection with both gram-positive and gram-negative
bacteria as well as various fungi. Impairment of adhesion of
leukocytes to vascular endothelium limits recruitment of
cells to sites of inflammation. Viral immunity is somewhat
impaired, as would be predicted from the defective T–B-cell
cooperation arising from the adhesion defect. LAD varies in
its severity; some affected individuals die within a few years,
whereas others survive into their forties. The reason for the
variable disease phenotype in this disorder is not known.
Chronic Granulomatous Disease
Chronic granulomatous disease (CGD) is the prototype of
immunodeficiency that impacts phagocytic function and
arises in at least two distinct forms: an X-linked form in
about 70% of patients and an autosomal recessive form
found in the rest. This group of disorders is rooted in a defect
in the nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate
(NADPH) oxidative pathway by which phagocytes generate
superoxide radicals and other reactive compounds that kill
phagocytosed pathogens. For this reason, CGD patients suffer from infection by bacterial and fungal pathogens, as well
as excessive inflammatory responses that lead to the formation of granulomas (a small mass of inflamed tissue).
Genetic causes have been mapped to several missing or
defective phagosome oxidase (phox) proteins that participate
in this pathway (see Table 18-1). Standard treatment includes
the use of antibiotics and antifungal compounds to control
infection. Of late, the addition of IFN-␥ to this regimen has
been shown to improve CGD symptoms in both humans
and animal models. Although the mechanism for this is still
debated, in vitro studies have shown that IFN-␥ treatment
induces TNF-␣ and the production of nitric oxide (NO,
another oxidative mediator) and enhances the uptake of
inflammation-inducing apoptotic cells, which could play a
role in inhibiting the formation of granulomas during
inflammation in these patients.
Chediak-Higashi Syndrome
This rare autosomal recessive disease is an example of a lysosomal storage and transport disorder. Chediak-Higashi syndrome (CHS) is characterized by recurrent bacterial
infections as well as defects in blood clotting, pigmentation,
and neurologic function. Immunodeficiency hallmarks
include neutropenia (depressed numbers of neutrophils) as
well as impairments in T cells, NK cells, and granulocytes.
CHS is associated with oculocutaneous albinism, or lightcolored skin, hair, and eyes, accompanied by photosensitivity. The underlying cause has been mapped to mutations in
the lysosomal trafficking regulator (LYST) gene that cause
defects in the LYST protein, which is important for transport
of proteins into lysosomes as well as for controlling lysosome
size, movement, and function. Disruption to this and related

organelles, such as the melanosomes of skin cells (melanocytes), results in enlarged organelles and defective transport
functions. Affected phagocytes produce giant granules, a
diagnostic hallmark, but are unable to kill engulfed pathogens, and melanocytes fail to transport melanin (responsible
for pigmentation). Similar enlarged lysosome-like structures
in platelets and nerve cells are also thought to interfere with
blood clotting and neurologic function, respectively. Exocytosis pathways are likewise affected, which could account for
the defects in killing seen in TC cells and NK cells, as well as
impaired chemotactic responses. Without early antimicrobial therapy followed by bone marrow transplant, patients
often die due to opportunistic infection before reaching
10 years of age. However, no therapies are currently available
to treat the defects in other cells, so even when immune
function is restored, neurologic and other complications
continue to progress.
Mendelian Susceptibility to Mycobacterial Diseases
Recently, a set of immunodeficiency disorders has been
grouped into a mixed-cell category based on the shared
characteristic of single gene (Mendelian) inheritance of susceptibility to mycobacterial diseases (MSMD). Discovery of
the underlying defects in MSMD highlights the connections
between innate and adaptive immunity, as well as the key
role played by IFN-␥ in fighting infection by mycobacteria,
intracellular organisms that can cause tuberculosis and leprosy. During natural mycobacterial infection, macrophages
in the lung or DCs in the draining lymph node recognize
these bacteria through pattern recognition receptors (PRRs),
such as TLR2 and TLR4, which trigger migration to lymph
nodes followed by APC activation and differentiation. In the
presence of strong costimulation, such as engagement of
CD40 on the APC with CD40L on the T cell, these activated
APCs produce significant amounts of IL-12 and IL-23,
which can bind to their receptors on TH cells and NK cells,
respectively. This leads to production of cytokines such as
IFN-␥, IL-17, and TNF-␣. In a positive feedback loop, TH
cells in this environment differentiate into TH1-type cells,
further producers of IFN-␥. Upon binding to the IFN-␥R on
APCs, this cytokine induces a signaling cascade, involving
Janus kinases and STAT1, which results in enhanced phagocytosis and optimal phago-lysosomal fusion, effectively killing engulfed bacteria.
This story of mycobacterial infection makes the defective
genes or proteins now implicated in MSMD no great surprise (Figure 18-6). To date, six genes within the IFN-␥/
IL-12/IL-23 pathways have been linked to MSMD, including
those encoding IL-12, IL-12R, IFN-␥R (both chains), STAT1,
and a kinase downstream of IL-12 signaling (TYK2). Another
gene linked to MSMD, called NEMO, controls the behavior
of the signal transduction molecule NF-␬B (see Figure 3-17),
which can affect CD40-dependent induction of IL-12. However, most mutations in NEMO lead to more widespread
immune defects and susceptibility patterns than are seen in
typical MSMD patients. The specific gene and type of mutation

FIGURE 18-6 Genetic defects resulting in
Mendelian susceptibility to mycobacterial
diseases (MSMD). Many primary immunodeficiencies associated with increased susceptibility to mycobacterial infection are associated with
defects in either the IFN-␥ pathway (e.g., IFN-␥R or
the related STAT1 signaling molecule) or IL-12/23
signaling pathway (e.g., IL-12, IL-12R, and the associated TYK2 signaling molecule). These pathways
are particularly important for clearing intravesicular infections. [Cottle, L. E., Mendelian susceptibility to

with modifications.]

determine which other pathogens, if any, also pose a risk to
these patients and influence prognosis as well as treatment
options.

Complement Deficiencies Are
Relatively Common
Immunodeficiency diseases resulting from defects in the
complement system, which has innate as well as adaptive
triggers, are described in Chapter 6. Depending on the
specific component that is defective, these immunodeficiencies can manifest as a generalized failure to activate
complement (e.g., C4 defects) or failures of discrete pathways or functions (e.g., alternative pathway activation).
Most complement deficiencies are associated with increased
susceptibility to bacterial infections and/or immunecomplex diseases. For example, deficiency in properdin,
which stabilizes the C3 convertase in the alternative complement pathway, is caused by a defect in a gene located on
the X chromosome and is specifically associated with
increased risk of infection with species of Neisseria. These
types of bacterial infection are also more common in
those with defects in the late components of complement,
including C5–C9. Defects in mannose-binding lectin
(MBL) result in increased susceptibility to a variety of
infections by bacterial or fungal agents. Recall from
Chapter 6 that MBL is a key initiator of the complement
attack on many pathogens and is an important component
of the innate immune response to many organisms.

Immunodeficiency That Disrupts Immune
Regulation Can Manifest as Autoimmunity
In addition to recognizing and eliminating foreign antigens,
the adaptive immune system must learn to recognize self

MHC proteins and to be proactive in suppressing reactions
to self antigens in the host. These processes are carried out
by the induction of tolerance in the thymus and by the
surveillance activities of regulatory T cells (TREG cells; see
Chapters 9 and 16). Disruptions to genes involved in these
immune regulatory or homeostatic processes, although
caused by inborn immunodeficiencies, actually manifest as
immune overactivity, or autoimmunity (see below and
Chapter 16).
Autoimmune Polyendocrinopathy and Ectodermal
Dystrophy
Individuals with a defect in the autoimmune regulatory
gene AIRE, discussed in detail in Chapter 9, suffer from a
disease called autoimmune polyendocrinopathy and
ectodermal dystrophy (APECED). The AIRE protein is
expressed in medullary epithelial cells of the thymus,
where it acts as a transcription factor to control expression
of a whole host of tissue-restricted antigens. Proper expression of these peripheral proteins in the thymus facilitates
the negative selection of potentially autoreactive T cells
before they can exit into the circulation. It appears that
depressed expression of AIRE in these individuals results
in reduced levels of tissue-specific antigens in thymic epithelial cells, allowing the escape of autoreactive T cells into
the periphery, where they precipitate organ-specific autoimmunity. APECED patients experience inhibition of
endocrine function, including hypoadrenalism, hypoparathyroidism, and hypothyroidism, along with chronic candidiasis. Autoimmune responses against antigens present
in these endocrine organs, as well as the adrenal cortex,
gonads, and pancreatic ␤-cells, are observed in these individuals. Although autoantibodies to these tissues are also
observed, these may result from the tissue destruction
mediated by pathogenic T cells.

The Immune System in Health and Disease

Immune Dysregulation, Polyendocrinopathy,
Enteropathy, X-linked (IPEX) Syndrome
Although many T cells with the ability to recognize self antigens are destroyed in the thymus during negative selection,
one class of CD4⫹ T cells with regulatory capabilities survive
and actively inhibit reactions to these self antigens. The
development and function of these TREG cells are controlled
by a master regulator and transcription factor, called FoxP3
(see Chapters 9 and 16). Patients with immune dysregulation, polyendocrinopathy, enteropathy, X-linked (IPEX)
syndrome have inherited a mutated FoxP3 gene and lack
expression of this protein, leading to a near absence of
TREG cells. Without these regulatory cells in the periphery,
autoreactive T cells that have escaped central tolerance in the
thymus go unchecked, leading to systemic autoimmune disease. Affected infants exhibit immune destruction of the
bowel, pancreas, thyroid, and skin, and they often die in the
first 2 years of life due to sepsis and failure to thrive.

Immunodeficiency Disorders Are Treated by
Replacement Therapy
Although there are no sure-fire cures for immunodeficiency
disorders, there are several treatment possibilities. In addition to the use of antimicrobial agents, and the drastic option
of total isolation from exposure to any opportunistic pathogen, treatment options for immunodeficiencies include the
following:

•
•
•

/Volumes/203/MHR00209/siL52070/disk1of1/0071052070

Replacement of a missing protein
Replacement of a missing cell type or lineage
Replacement of a missing or defective gene

For disorders that impair antibody production, the classic
course of treatment is administration of the missing protein
immunoglobulin. Pooled human gammaglobulin given
either intravenously or subcutaneously protects against
recurrent infection in many types of immunodeficiency.
Maintenance of reasonably high levels of serum immunoglobulin (5 mg/ml serum) will prevent most common infections in the agammaglobulinemic patient. Advances in the
preparation of human monoclonal antibodies and in the
ability to genetically engineer chimeric antibodies with
mouse V regions and human-derived C regions make it possible to prepare antibodies specific for important pathogens
(see Chapter 20).
Advances in molecular biology make it possible to clone
the genes that encode other immunologically important
proteins, such as cytokines, and to express these genes in
vitro, using bacterial or eukaryotic expression systems. The
availability of such proteins allows new modes of therapy in
which immunologically important proteins may be
replaced or their concentrations increased in the patient.
For example, the delivery of recombinant IFN-␥ has
proven effective for patients with CGD, and recombinant

adenosine deaminase has been successfully administered
to ADA-deficient SCID patients.
Cell replacement as therapy for some immunodeficiencies has been made possible by progress in bone marrow, or
hematopoietic stem cell (HSC), transplantation (see Chapter 16) and is the primary potential long-term cure for SCID
patients. Transfer of HSCs from an immunocompetent
donor allows development of a functional immune system
(see Clinical Focus Box 2-2). Success rates of greater than
90% have been reported for those who are fortunate enough
to have an human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-identical donor.
In cases where there is partial HLA matching, treatment in
the first few months of life has the best prognosis for relatively long-lasting results. These procedures can also be relatively successful with SCID infants when haploidentical
(complete match of one HLA gene set or haplotype) donor
marrow is used. In this case, T cells are depleted to avoid
graft versus host disease, and CD34⫹ stem cells are enriched
before introducing the donor bone marrow into the recipient. A variation of bone marrow transplantation is the injection of parental CD34⫹ cells in utero when the birth of an
infant with SCID is expected.
If a single gene defect has been identified, as in adenosine
deaminase or IL-2R␥ defects, replacement of the defective
gene, or gene therapy, may be a treatment option. During
the last 20 years, several clinical tests of gene therapy for
these two types of SCID have been undertaken, with mixed
results. In these trials, CD34⫹ HSCs are first isolated from
the bone marrow or umbilical cord blood of HLA-identical
or haploidentical donors. These cells are transduced with the
corrected gene and then introduced into the patient, in some
cases after myeloablation conditioning, a pre-treatment that
destroys existing leukocytes, “making space” for engraftment
of the new cells. As of 2012, we are now more than two
decades out from these initial trials. In general, gene therapy
for the IL-2R␥ defect has been slightly more successful than
have similar treatments for ADA deficiency, yielding immunodeficiency correction rates of approximately 85% versus
70%, respectively. This is likely due to the presence of ADA
defects in cell types other than leukocytes. Although these
therapies have allowed a majority of the treated individuals
to recover significant immune function, there have been
some setbacks. In 5 of the first 20 cases of gene therapy for
X-linked SCID, insertion of the vector used to transfer the
corrected gene led to mutagenesis and development of leukemia. Most of these cases were successfully resolved; however, one individual died from this cancer, effectively halting
additional trials. Studies are currently underway to redesign
the vectors used, to make them safer, and to specifically
direct integration into inactive regions of the genome.

Animal Models of Immunodeficiency Have
Been Used to Study Basic Immune Function
There is a good reason PIDs are sometimes called nature’s
experiments. Many of the molecular details of how the

c18Immunodeficiency Disorders.indd Page 605 12/20/12 7:02 PM user-t044

/Volumes/203/MHR00209/siL52070/disk1of1/0071052070

Immunodeficiency Disorders
immune system works have come from discovering and
studying the broken parts. More important, observations
made in humans with PIDs and in animal models of immunodeficiency have taught us what questions to ask. Does the
immune system play a role in surveillance for cancer? (The
answer is yes, and it’s not always a good one; see Chapter 19.)
How can a defect in the IL-2R lead to a total lack of B cells
as well as T cells? How can mutation of a single gene related
to immunity cause immunologic attack of a whole range of
different self proteins? (See above for answers to both.) And
the list goes on.
Experimental animals with spontaneous or engineered
primary immunodeficiencies have provided fertile ground
for manipulating and studying basic immune processes. By
comparing the phenotypes of animals with and without
these blocks in certain components of the immune system,
scientists have been able to tease out many details of normal
immune processes. The two most widely used animal models of primary immunodeficiency are the athymic, or nude,
mouse and the SCID mouse. However, development of other
genetically altered animals in which a single target immune
gene is knocked out or mutated has also yielded valuable
information about the role of these genes in combating
infection, and has highlighted some unexpected connections
between the immune system and other systems in the body.
Nude (Athymic) Mice
A genetic trait designated nu (now called Foxn1nu), which is
controlled by a recessive gene on chromosome 11, was discovered in 1962 by Norman Roy Grist. Mice homozygous for this
trait (nu/nu, or nude mice) are hairless and have a vestigial
thymus (Figure 18-7). Heterozygotic nu/wt littermates have
hair and a normal thymus. We now know that the mutated
gene FOXN1 encodes a transcription factor, mainly expressed
in the thymus and skin epithelial cells, that plays a role in cell
differentiation and survival, suggesting that the hair loss and
immunodeficiency may be caused by the same defect. Like
humans born with severe immunodeficiency, these mice do
not survive for long without intervention, and 50% or more
die within the first 2 weeks after birth from opportunistic
infection if housed under standard conditions. When these
animals are to be used for experimental purposes, precautions
include the use of sterilized food, water, cages, and bedding.
The cages are protected from dust by placing them in a laminar flow rack or by using cage-fitted air filters.

CHAPTER 18

Nude mice have now been studied for many years and
have been developed into a tool for biomedical research. For
example, because these mice can permanently tolerate both
allografts and xenografts (tissue from another species), they
have a number of practical experimental uses in the study
of transplantation and cancer. Hybridomas (immortalized
B cells) or solid tumors from any origin can be grown in the
nude mouse, allowing their propagation and the evaluation
of new tumor imaging techniques or pharmacological treatments for cancer in these animals.
The SCID Mouse
In 1983, Melvin and Gayle Bosma and their colleagues
described an autosomal recessive mutation in mice that gave
rise to a severe deficiency in mature lymphocytes. They designated the trait SCID because of its similarity to human
severe combined immunodeficiency. The SCID mouse was
shown to have early B- and T-lineage cells but a virtual
absence of lymphoid cells in the thymus, spleen, lymph
nodes, and gut tissue, the usual locations of functional T and
B cells. Precursor cells in the SCID mouse appeared to be
unable to differentiate into mature functional B and T lymphocytes. Inbred mouse lines carrying this defect, which
have now been propagated and studied in great detail, neither make antibody nor carry out delayed-type hypersensitivity or graft rejection reactions. Lacking much of their
adaptive response, they succumb to infection early in life if
not kept in extremely pathogen-free environments. Hematopoietic cells other than lymphocytes develop normally in the
SCID mouse; red blood cells, monocytes, and granulocytes
are present and functional. Like humans, SCID mice may be
rendered immunologically competent by transplantation of
stem cells from a matched donor.
The mutation was discovered in a gene called protein
kinase, DNA activated, catalytic polypeptide (PRKDC),
which was later shown to participate in the double-stranded
DNA break-repair pathway important for antigen-specific
receptor gene recombination in B and T cells. This defect is
a leaky mutation: a certain number of SCID mice do produce immunoglobulin, and about half of these mice can also
reject skin allografts, suggesting components of both
humoral and adaptive immunity are present. This leaky phenotype has somewhat limited the widespread use of these
mice in research laboratories. However, their ability, like the
nude mouse, to accept engrafted tissue from any species has
FIGURE 18-7 A nude mouse (Foxn1nu/
Foxn1nu). This defect leads to absence of a
thymus or a vestigial thymus and cell-mediated
immunodeficiency. [Courtesy of the Jackson Laboratory, Bar Harbor, Maine.]

The Immune System in Health and Disease

led to the development of chimeric mice reconstituted with
a humanized immune system (called hu-SCID). These
human cells can develop in a normal fashion and, as a result,
hu-SCID mice contain T cells, B cells, and immunoglobulin
of human origin. In one important application, these mice
can be infected with HIV-1, a pathogen that does not infect
mouse cells. This provides an animal model in which to test
therapeutic or prophylactic strategies against HIV infection.
RAG Knockout Mice
The potential utility of a mouse model that lacks adaptive
immunity, or certain components of adaptive responses, led
to the engineering of mice with more targeted mutations.
Arguably, the most widely used have been mice with deletions in one of the recombination-activating enzymes, RAG1
and RAG2, responsible for the rearrangement of immunoglobulin or T-cell receptor genes. Since both enzymes are
required for recombination, the phenotypes of the two are
almost identical, although absence of RAG2 blocks B-cell
and T-cell development at an earlier stage and more completely. Unlike nude or SCID mice, RAG2 knockout mice
exhibit “tight” defects in both B-cell and T-cell compartments;
precursor cells cannot rearrange the genes for antigen-specific
receptors or proceed along a normal developmental path,
and thus both B and T cells are absent. With a SCID phenotype, RAG knockout mice can be used as an alternative to
nude or conventional SCID mice. Their applications include
experimental cancer and infectious disease research, as well
as more targeted investigations of immune gene function.
RAG knockout mice can be the background strain for the
production of transgenic mice carrying specific rearranged
T-cell or B-cell receptor genes. For example, since these loci
have already rearranged, T-cell receptor transgenes will not
require the RAG enzymes, and can develop “normally” in
the thymus, allowing immunologists to study the events
that occur during positive and negative selection while
observing the behavior of a million or more T cells of the
same clonotype. Although the degree to which this represents truly typical in vivo development of a T cell is questionable, this model has been widely used to ask and to
answer many important questions related to MHC restriction and tolerance.

Secondary Immunodeficiencies
As described above, a variety of defects in the immune system
can give rise to immunodeficiency. In addition to the inherited primary immunodeficiencies, there are also acquired
(secondary) immunodeficiencies. Although AIDS resulting
from HIV infection is the most well known of these, other
factors, such as drug treatment, metabolic disease, or malnutrition, can also impact immune function and lead to secondary deficiencies. As in primary immunodeficiency, symptoms
include heightened susceptibility to common infectious agents

and sometimes opportunistic infections. The effect depends
on the degree of immune suppression and inherent host susceptibility factors, but can range from no clinical symptoms to
almost complete collapse of the immune system, as in HIVinduced AIDS. In most cases, withdrawal of the external
condition causing the deficiency can result in restoration of
immune function. The first part of this section will cover secondary immunodeficiency due to some non-HIV causes, and
the remainder will deal with AIDS.
One secondary immunodeficiency that has been recognized for some time but has an unknown cause is acquired
hypogammaglobulinemia. This condition is sometimes
confused with CVID, a condition that shows genetic predisposition (see above). Symptoms include recurrent infection,
and the condition typically manifests in young adults who
have very low but detectable levels of total immunoglobulin
with normal T-cell numbers and function. However, some
cases do involve T-cell defects, which may grow more severe
as the disease progresses. The disease is generally treated by
immunoglobulin therapy, allowing patients to live a relatively normal life. Unlike the similar primary deficiencies
described above, there is no evidence for genetic transmission of this disease. Mothers with acquired hypogammaglobulinemia deliver normal infants. However, at birth these
infants will be deficient in circulating immunoglobulin due
to the lack of IgG in maternal circulation that can be passively transferred to the infant.
Another form of secondary immunodeficiency, agentinduced immunodeficiency, results from exposure to any
of a number of environmental agents that induce an immunosuppressed state. These could be immunosuppressive
drugs used to combat autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis or the corticosteroids commonly used during
transplantation procedures to blunt the attack of the immune
system on donor organs. The mechanism of action of these
immunosuppressive agents varies, as do the defects in
immune function, although T cells are a common target. As
described in Chapter 16, recent efforts have been made to
use more specific means of inducing tolerance to allografts
to circumvent the unwanted side effects of general immunosuppression. In addition, cytotoxic drugs or radiation treatments given to treat various forms of cancer, as well as
accidental radiation exposure, frequently damage rapidly
dividing cells in the body, including those of the immune
system, inducing a state of temporary immunodeficiency as
an unwanted consequence. Patients undergoing such therapy must be monitored closely and treated with antibiotics
or immunoglobulin if infection appears.
Extremes of age are also natural factors in immune function. The very young and elderly suffer from impairments to
immune function not typically seen during the remainder of
the life span. Neonates, and especially premature babies, can
be very susceptible to infection, with degree of prematurity
linked to the degree of immune dysfunction. Although all
the basic immune components are in place in full-term,
healthy newborns, the complete range of innate and adaptive

Immunodeficiency Disorders
immune functions take some time to mature. Along with
presence of passive maternal antibody for about the first
6 months of life, this is part of the reason for a gradual vaccination program against the common childhood infectious
diseases that peak around 1 year of age (see Chapter 17).
In later life, individuals again experience an increasing risk
of infection, especially by bacteria and viruses, as well as
more malignancies. Cell-mediated immunity is generally
depressed, and although there are increased numbers of
memory B cells and circulating IgG, the diversity of the
B-cell repertoire is diminished.
The single most common cause of acquired immunodeficiency, even dwarfing the number of individuals worldwide
affected by AIDS, is severe malnutrition, affecting both
innate and adaptive immunity. Sustained periods with very
low protein-calorie diets (hypoproteinemia) are associated
with depression in T-cell numbers and function, although
deleterious B cell effects may take longer to appear. The reason for this is unclear, although some evidence suggests a bias
toward anti-inflammatory immune pathways (e.g., IL-10 and
TREG cells) when protein is scarce. In addition to protein, an
insufficiency in micronutrients, such as zinc and ascorbic
acid, likely contributes to the general immunodeficiency and
increased susceptibility to opportunistic infection that occurs
with malnutrition. This can be further complicated by stress
and infection, both of which may contribute to diarrhea,
further reducing nutrient absorption in the gut. Deficiency in
vitamin D, required for calcium uptake and bone health, has
also been linked to an inhibition in the ability of macrophages to act against intracellular pathogens, such as M.
tuberculosis, endemic in many regions of the world where
people are at greatest risk of malnutrition. Severe malnourishment thus ranks as one of the most preventable causes of
poor immune function in otherwise healthy individuals, and
when combined with chronic infection (as with HIV/AIDS,
tuberculosis, or cholera) can be all the more deadly.

cell-mediated immune responses and a significant decrease
in the subpopulation of T cells that carry the CD4 marker
(T helper cells). When epidemiologists examined the background of the first patients with this new syndrome, they
found that the majority were homosexual males. In those
early days before we knew the cause or transmission route,
and as the number of AIDS cases climbed throughout the
world, people thought to be at highest risk for AIDS were
homosexual males, promiscuous heterosexual individuals of
either sex and their partners, intravenous drug users, people
who received blood or blood products prior to 1985, and
infants born to HIV-infected mothers. We now know that all
these initial patients had intimate contact with an HIVinfected individual or exposure to HIV-tainted blood.
Since its discovery in the early 1980s, AIDS has increased
to epidemic proportions throughout the world. As of December 2011, approximately 34 million people were living with
HIV infection, 1.3 million in the United States. Although
reporting of AIDS cases is mandatory in the United States,
many states do not require reporting of cases of HIV infection that have not yet progressed to AIDS, making the count
of HIV-infected individuals an estimate. The demographic
profile of new HIV infections is evolving in the United
States, where racial and ethnic minorities, especially men,
are being disproportionately affected (Figure 18-8).
The toll of HIV/AIDS in the United States is dwarfed by
figures for other parts of the world. The global distribution
of those afflicted with HIV is shown in Figure 18-9. In subSaharan Africa, the region most affected, an estimated
23.5 million people were living with HIV at the end of 2010,
and another 4 million were in South and Southeast Asia.
Epidemiologic statistics estimate that more than 24 million
people worldwide have died from AIDS since the beginning

In recent years, all other forms of immunodeficiency have
been overshadowed by an epidemic of severe immunodeficiency caused by the infectious agent called human
immunodeficiency virus (HIV). HIV causes acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) and was first recognized as
opportunistic infections in a cluster of individuals on both
coasts of the United States in June 1981. This group of
patients displayed unusual infections, including the opportunistic fungal pathogen Pneumocystis carinii, which causes P.
carinii pneumonia (PCP) in people with immunodeficiency.
Previously, these infections were limited primarily to individuals taking immunosuppressive drugs. In addition to PCP,
some of those early patients had Kaposi’s sarcoma, an
extremely rare skin tumor, as well as other, rarely encountered opportunistic infections. More complete evaluation
showed that all patients had a common marked deficiency in

of the epidemic, leaving millions of children orphaned.
Despite a better understanding of how HIV is transmitted,
estimates indicate the occurrence of 2.5 million new HIV
infections in 2011, amounting to almost 7,000 new infections each day! Now the good news: rates of new HIV
infections decreased by 20% worldwide in 2011 compared
to 2001, and access to lifesaving drugs has significantly
expanded. These gains are attributable partly to the United
Nations Declaration of Commitment on HIV/AIDS, signed
in 2001, which has paved the way for stepped-up prevention and education programs around the world as well as
expanded drug access programs. Of course this has also led
to climbing numbers of individuals living with AIDS, as
the period of time from onset of AIDS to opportunistic
infection lengthens. Yet, there is still no indication of an
end to the epidemic.

The Retrovirus HIV-1 Is the Causative
Agent of AIDS
Within a few years after recognition of AIDS as an infectious disease, the causative agent, now known as HIV-1, was
discovered and characterized in the laboratories of Luc

Montagnier in Paris and Robert Gallo in Bethesda, Maryland (Figure 18-10). About 2 years later, the infectious agent
was found to be a retrovirus of the lentivirus genus, which
display long incubation periods (lente is Latin for “slow”).
Retroviruses carry their genetic information in the form of
RNA, and when the virus enters a cell this RNA is reversetranscribed (RNA to DNA, rather than the other way
around) by a virally encoded enzyme, reverse transcriptase
(RT). This copy of DNA, which is called a provirus, is integrated into the cell genome and is replicated along with the
cell DNA. When the provirus is expressed to form new
virions (viral particles), the cell lyses. Alternatively, the provirus may remain latent in the cell until some regulatory
signal starts the expression process. The discovery of a
retrovirus as the cause of HIV was novel, since at the time
only one other human retrovirus, human T-cell lymphotropic
virus I (HTLV-I), had been identified. Although comparisons
of their genomic sequences revealed that HIV-1 is not a
close relative of HTLV-I, similarities in overall characteristics led to use of the name HTLV-III for the AIDS virus in
early reports.
About 5 years after the discovery of HIV-1, a close retroviral cousin, HIV-2, was isolated from some AIDS sufferers in

II MHC molecules. Within the envelope is the viral matrix (p17) and

Africa. Unlike HIV-1, its prevalence is mostly limited to
areas of Western Africa, and disease progresses much more
slowly, if at all. In Guinea-Bissau, where HIV-2 is most common, up to 8% of the population may be persistently infected
and yet most of these individuals experience a nearly normal
lifespan. There is some hope that scientists can gain a better
understanding of HIV-1 from the study of the more benign
cohabitation of HIV-2 and its human host.
Viruses related to HIV-1 have been found in nonhuman
primates, and some of these are believed to be the original
source of HIV-1 and -2 in humans. These viruses, variants of
simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV), can cause immunodeficiency disease in certain infected monkeys. Typically,
SIV strains cause no disease in their natural hosts but produce immunodeficiency similar to AIDS when injected into
another species. For example, the virus from African green
monkeys (SIVagm) is present in a high percentage of normal,
healthy African green monkeys in the wild. However, when
SIVagm is injected into macaques, it causes a severe and often
lethal immunodeficiency. HIV-1 is believed to have evolved
from a strain of SIV that jumped the species barrier from
African chimpanzees to humans, although HIV-2 is thought
to have arisen from a separate but similar transfer from SIV-

copies of single-stranded RNA (ssRNA), which are associated with
two molecules of reverse transcriptase (p64) plus p10, a protease,
and p32, an integrase. (b) Electron micrograph of HIV virions magnified 200,000 times. The glycoprotein projections are faintly visible as

infected sooty mangabeys. Both of these events are believed
to have occurred some time during the twentieth century,
making this a relatively new pathogen for the human population.
A number of other animal retroviruses more or less similar to HIV-1 have been reported. These include the feline
immunodeficiency virus and bovine immunodeficiency
virus (FIV and BIV, respectively) and the mouse leukemia
virus. Study of these animal viruses has yielded information
concerning the general nature of retrovirus action and pathways to the induction of immunodeficiency. Because HIV
does not replicate in typical laboratory animals, model systems to study it are few. Only the chimpanzee supports
infection with HIV-1 at a level sufficient to be useful in vaccine trials, but infected chimpanzees rarely develop AIDS,
which limits the value of this model in the study of viral
pathogenesis. In addition, the number of chimpanzees available for such studies is low, and both the expense and the
ethical issues involved preclude widespread use of this infection model. The SCID mouse (see above) reconstituted with
human lymphoid tissue for infection with HIV-1 has been
useful for certain studies of HIV-1 infection, especially in the
development of drugs to combat viral replication.

The Immune System in Health and Disease

CLINICAL FOCUS

Prevention of Infant HIV Infection by Anti-Retroviral Treatment
It is estimated that almost 700,000
infants became infected with HIV through
mother-to-child transmission in 2005 (just
prior to the widespread implementation
of standard prophylactic treatment for
HIV-infected mothers). The majority of
these infections resulted from transmission of virus from HIV-infected mothers
during childbirth or by transfer of virus
from milk during breast-feeding. The incidence of maternally acquired infection
can be reduced by treatment of the
infected mother with a course of zidovudine or azidothymidine (AZT, a nucleoside
analog reverse-transcriptase inhibitor
[NRTI]) for several months prior to delivery
and treatment of her infant for 6 weeks
after birth. This treatment regimen is standard practice in the United States. However, the majority of worldwide HIV
infection in infants occurs in sub-Saharan
Africa and other less-developed areas,
where the cost and timing of the zidovudine regimen render it an impractical
solution to the problem of maternalinfant HIV transmission.
A 1999 clinical trial of the anti-retroviral
drug nevirapine (Viramune, an NRTI)
brought hope for a practical way to combat
HIV transmission at birth in less-than-ideal
conditions of clinical care. The trial took
place at Mulago Hospital in Kampala,

Uganda, and enrolled 645 mothers who
tested positive for HIV infection (Figure 1).
About half of the mothers were given a
single dose of nevirapine at the onset of
labor, and their infants were given a single
dose one day after birth. The dose and timing were dictated by the customary rapid

HIV-1 Is Spread by Intimate Contact with
Infected Body Fluids
Although some of the details involving the mechanism by
which HIV-1 infects an individual are still incomplete, the big
picture of transmission routes has been resolved. Epidemiological data indicate that the most common means of transmission include vaginal and anal intercourse, receipt of
infected blood or blood products, and passage from HIVinfected mothers to their infants. Before routine tests for
HIV-1 were in place, patients who received blood transfusions and hemophiliacs who received blood products were at
risk for HIV-1 infection. Exposure to infected blood accounts
for the high incidence of AIDS among intravenous drug
users, who often share hypodermic needles. Infants born to

discharge at the hospital. The control arm of
the study involved a more extensive course
of zidovudine, but local conditions did not
allow the full course typically administered
to infected mothers in the United States.
The subjects were followed for at least 18
months. The infected mothers breast-fed

mothers who are infected with HIV-1 are at high risk of
infection; without prophylaxis, over 25% of these newborns
may become infected with the virus. However, elective Cesarean section delivery and antiretroviral treatment programs
for HIV⫹ pregnant women and their newborns are making a
real dent in these numbers (see Clinical Focus Box 18-1).
In the worldwide epidemic, it is estimated that approximately 75% of the cases of HIV transmission are attributable
to sexual contact. The presence of other sexually transmitted
diseases (STDs) increases the likelihood of transmission,
and in situations where STDs flourish, such as unregulated
prostitution, these infections probably represent a powerful
cofactor for sexual transmission of HIV-1. The open lesions
and activated inflammatory cells (some of which may
express receptors for HIV) associated with STDs favor the

99% of the infants in this study, so the test
measures a considerable interval during
which the infants were exposed to risk of
infection at birth and while nursing.
The infants were tested for HIV-1
infection at several times after birth up to
18 months of age using an RNA PCR test
and at later times for HIV-1 antibody
(after maternal antibody would no longer interfere with the test). The overall
rate of infection for infants born to
untreated mothers is estimated to be
about 37%. In the United States, when
the full course of zidovudine is used, the
rate drops to 20%. The highly encouraging results of the Uganda study revealed
infection in only 13.5% of the babies in
the nevirapine group when tested at 16
weeks of age. Of those given a short
course of zidovudine, 22.1% were
infected at this age compared to 40.2%
in a small placebo group. In the 18-month
follow-up of the test group, 15.7% of
those given nevirapine were infected,
whereas 25.8% given zidovudine were
positive for HIV-1.
These promising results led to World
Health Organization (WHO) recommendations that this nevirapine regimen be
used in all instances where mother-tochild transmission of HIV was a danger.
But what about the risks associated with
breast-feeding? In 2007, it was estimated
that up to 200,000 infants become
infected with HIV annually through breast

milk. In resource-limited countries, poor
early nutrition and susceptibility to disease are key factors in infant death rates;
breast-feeding significantly reduces these
risks. Therefore, a follow-up investigation
called the Breastfeeding, Antiretrovirals,
and Nutrition (BAN) study was conducted
in Lilongwe, Malawi, in 2006 to 2008. This
investigation employed a dose of nevirapine for the mother and child at birth, followed by 7 days of treatment of the pair
with two NRTIs. The 2369 mother-infant
pairs were then randomized to one of
three post-delivery prophylaxis groups:
maternal treatment, infant treatment, or
placebo control. Mothers in the maternal
regimen received a triple-drug cocktail for
28 weeks post delivery, including two
NRTIs and either an NNRTI or a protease
inhibitor. The babies in the infant treatment group received nevirapine daily for
the same period of time, while initial participants in the control population
received no additional treatment (in the
latter part of the study, no new pairs were
enrolled in this group). All mothers were
encouraged to breast-feed for 6 months
and wean before 7 months. Comparing
the rate of HIV transmission that occurred
during breast-feeding (from weeks 2–28)
in the control population to the treatment
groups, results demonstrated a 53% protective effect for the maternal regimen
and a 74% protective effect in the infant
treatment group.

transfer and attachment of the virus during intercourse.
Estimates of transmission rates per exposure vary widely
and depend on many factors, such as the presence of STDs
and number of virions. However, male-to-female transfer
between discordant couples during vaginal intercourse is
approximately twice as risky to the female as to the male,
based solely on anatomical considerations, and receptive
partners in anal intercourse are even more at risk. Data from
studies in India and in Africa indicate that men who are
circumcised are at significantly lower risk of acquiring
HIV-1 via sexual contact, possibly because foreskin provides
a source of cells that can become infected or harbor the
virus. However, this did not work in reverse: circumcised
males were equally likely to transmit HIV-1 to their sexual
partners. No similarly protective effect of circumcision was

Collectively, the conclusions from
these efficacy and safety trials have led to
new worldwide recommendations for
protecting newborns from maternally
transmitted HIV. In 2009, the WHO revised
its recommendations to encourage
breast-feeding for at least 12 months,
based on studies in Africa showing
increased infant mortality rates in babies
weaned as early as 6 months. The hope is
that with an extended nursing period that
includes nevirapine prophylaxis, both the
danger of death from disease or malnutrition and the risk of HIV transmission can
be significantly reduced, even in severely
resource-limited settings.
As mentioned above, these studies
were designed to conform to the reality of
maternal health care in less developed
nations. Nevirapine has significant advantages in this regard, including stability of
the drug at room temperature, reasonable
cost, and relatively few side effects. The
dose of nevirapine administered to the
mother and infant at birth costs about
200 times less than the zidovudine regimen used in the United States to block
HIV transmission at birth. In fact, the treatment is sufficiently inexpensive as to suggest that it may be cost-effective to treat
all mothers and infants at the time of
delivery in areas where the rates of infection are high and the nevirapine treatment costs are less than the tests used to
determine HIV infection.

seen for other STDs, including herpes simplex type 2, syphilis, or gonorrhea.
Identifying the initial events that take place during HIV
transmission is logistically and ethically challenging, as we
know that immediate antiviral treatment significantly diminishes the odds of infection. Nonetheless, hypotheses concerning the most likely sequence of events have been pieced
together based on observations in humans and animals,
including in vitro studies using explanted human tissue and
in vivo studies in macaques, a nonhuman primate. Based on
these observations, we believe that free virus and virusinfected cells, which can both be found in vaginal secretions
and semen, contribute to infection. Direct infection of the
many activated but resting memory CD4⫹ T cells present
within the vaginal mucosa is likely the primary initial source

Although the female genital tract is a relatively robust barrier to most infectious agents (with the adaptive immune
response taking over from there), emerging evidence based
on viral sequence analysis suggests that a single HIV-1 virion
may be responsible for all or most of the systemic infection
in many male-to-female transfers.
Because transmission of HIV-1 infection requires direct
contact with infected blood, milk, semen, or vaginal fluid,
preventive measures can be taken to block these events. Scientific researchers and medical professionals who take reasonable precautions, which include avoiding exposure of
broken skin or mucosal membranes with fluids from their
patients, significantly decrease their chances of becoming
infected. When exposure does occur, rapid administration of
anti-HIV treatment can often prevent systemic infection.
The use of condoms when having sex with individuals of
unknown infection status also significantly reduces chances
of infection. One factor contributing to the spread of HIV is
the long period after infection during which no clinical signs
may appear but during which the infected individual may
infect others. Thus, universal use of precautionary measures
is important whenever infection status is uncertain.

In Vitro Studies Have Revealed the Structure
and Life Cycle of HIV-1

of infection in the female genital tract (the most studied
location). In macaques, a foothold or attachment can be
established in as little as 30 to 60 minutes, and high numbers
of infected CD4⫹ cells are seen within 1 day of exposure.
Replication of HIV-1 in the vaginal mucosa was also shown
to help activate local CD4⫹ T cells, providing yet more targets for the virus and creating a vicious cycle. Likewise, the
inflammation associated with STDs is thought to enhance
the number of TH cells and their susceptibility to infection.
Viral transcytosis through epithelial cells, or endocytic
transport from the luminal to the basal surface of the cell, is
another possible route. Langerhans cells (LCs), a type of
intraepithelial DC with long processes that reach close to the
vaginal lumen, have also been shown to take up virus,
although they may not become infected. These and other
DCs may transport intact infectious virus, possibly for days,
within endocytic compartments, and can transfer this virus
to CD4⫹ T cells (Figure 18-11). The role of macrophages in
these early events, as transporters or targets of infection, is
somewhat controversial but not suspected to be a major
contributor. Finally, free virus can squeeze between epithelial cells or gain access through microabrasions, eventually
encountering susceptible cells or afferent lymphatic vessels.
Whether free or cell-associated, the virus then migrates
through the submucosa to the draining lymph node, where
the adaptive immune response can be initiated. However,
once there, further viral spread is facilitated, some through
cell-to-cell hand-off via infectious synapses, as many more
cells with the proper surface receptors are encountered.

The HIV-1 genome and encoded proteins have been fairly
well characterized, and the functions of most of these proteins are known (Figure 18-12). HIV-1 carries three structural genes (gag, pol, and env) and six regulatory or accessory
genes (tat, rev, nef, vif, vpr, and vpu). The structural genes and
the proteins they encode were the first to be sequenced and
meticulously characterized. The gag gene encodes several
proteins, including the capsid and matrix, which enclose the
viral genome and associated proteins. The pol gene codes for
the three main enzymes (in addition to those supplied by the
host cell) that are required for the viral life cycle: protease,
integrase, and reverse transcriptase. In fact, the protease
enzyme is required to process precursor proteins of many of
the other viral peptides. As we will see shortly, these uniquely
viral enzymes are some of the main targets for therapeutic
intervention. The final structural gene, env, is the source of
the surface proteins gp120 and gp41, involved in attachment
of the virus to the CD4⫹ viral receptor and its coreceptor,
either CXCR4 or CCR5. The regulatory genes expressed by
HIV-1, which took longer to characterize, encode functions
such as modulating CD4 and class I MHC expression, inactivating host proteins that interfere with viral transcription,
and facilitating intracellular viral transport.
Much has been learned about the life cycle of HIV-1 from
in vitro studies, where cultured human T cells have been
used to map out virus attachment and post-attachment
intracellular events (Figure 18-13a). HIV-1 infects cells that
carry the CD4 antigen on their surface; in addition to TH
cells, these can include monocytes and macrophages, as well
as other cells expressing CD4. This preference for CD4⫹ cells

virion maturation, and one (vpr) encodes a weak transcriptional activator. The 5⬘ long terminal repeat (LTR) contains sequences to which
various regulatory proteins bind. The organization of the HIV-2 and
SIV genomes is very similar except that the vpu gene is replaced by
vpx in both of them.

1 Transcription factors stimulate transcription of proviral DNA
into genomic ssRNA and, after processing, several mRNAs.

2 HIV gp41 binds to a chemokine receptor (CXCR4 or CCR5) and
fuses with the target cell membrane.

2 Viral RNA is exported to cytoplasm.

3 Nucleocapsid containing viral genome and enzymes enters cells.

3a Host-cell ribosomes catalyze synthesis of viral precursor proteins.

4 Viral genome and enzymes are released following removal
of core proteins.

3b Viral protease cleaves precursors into viral proteins.

5 Viral reverse transcriptase catalyzes reverse transcription of
ssRNA, forming RNA-DNA hybrids.
6 Original RNA template is partially degraded by ribonuclease H,
followed by synthesis of second DNA strand to yield HIV dsDNA.
7 The viral dsDNA is then translocated to the nucleus and integrated
into the host chromosomal DNA by the viral integrase enzyme.

4 HIV ssRNA and proteins assemble beneath the host-cell
membrane, into which gp41 and gp120 are inserted.
5a The membrane buds out, forming the viral envelope.
5b Released viral particles complete maturation; incorporated
precursor proteins are cleaved by viral protease present in
viral particles.

is due to a high-affinity interaction between gp120 and the
CD4 molecule on the host cell. However, this interaction
alone is not sufficient for viral entry and productive infection. Expression of another cell-surface molecule, called a
coreceptor, is required for HIV-1 access to the cell. Each of
the two known coreceptors for HIV-1, CCR5 and CXCR4,
belongs to a separate class of molecule known as a chemokine receptor. The role of chemokine receptors in the body is
to bind their natural ligands, chemokines, which are chemotactic messengers driving the movement of leukocytes (see
Chapter 4). The infection of a T cell is assisted by the CXCR4
coreceptor, while the analogous CCR5 seems to be the pre-

ferred coreceptor for viral entry into monocytes and macrophages, and is now a target for antiviral intervention.
After HIV-1 has entered a cell, the RNA genome of the virus
is reverse-transcribed and a cDNA copy integrates into the host
genome. The integrated provirus is transcribed, and the various
viral RNA messages are spliced and translated into proteins
that, along with a complete new copy of the RNA genome, are
used to form new viral particles (Figure 18-13b). These initial
viral proteins are cleaved by the virally encoded protease into
the forms that make up the nuclear capsid in a mature infectious viral particle. Virus expression leads to newly formed
virions that bud from the surface of the infected cell, often

HIV infection. Although CD4 binds to the envelope glycoprotein
of HIV-1, a second coreceptor is necessary for entry and infection.
T-cell–tropic strains of HIV-1 use the coreceptor CXCR4, whereas the
macrophage-tropic strains use CCR5. Both are receptors for chemokines, and their normal ligands (SDF-1, RANTES, and MIP) can block
HIV infection of the cell.

FIGURE 18-14 Once the HIV provirus has been activated,
buds representing newly formed viral particles can be observed on the surface of an infected T cell. The extensive cell
damage resulting from budding and release of virions leads to the

causing cell lysis (Figure 18-14). However, HIV-1 can also
become latent, or remain unexpressed, for long periods of time
in an infected cell. This period of dormancy makes the task of
finding these latently infected cells especially difficult for the
immune response to HIV-1; latent infection is believed to aid in
the establishment of HIV reservoirs, or safe havens, where both
drug therapy and antiviral immunity can have little impact.
Studies of the viral envelope protein gp120 identified a
region called the V3 loop, which plays a role in the choice of
receptors used by the virus. It is clear from these studies that
a single amino acid difference in this region of gp120 may be
sufficient to determine which receptor is used. Moreover, a
mutation in the CCR5 gene that occurs with varying frequency, depending on ethnic background, imparts nearly
total resistance to infection with the strains of HIV-1 that are
most commonly encountered in sexual exposure. Individuals who are homozygous for this mutation express no CCR5
on the surface of their cells, making them impervious to
viral strains that require this coreceptor but, remarkably,
otherwise apparently unperturbed by loss of this chemokine
receptor. This has led to some recent stories, and new hopes,
of HIV elimination. For instance, one HIV-infected patient
who received a set of bone marrow transplants (to treat leukemia) from a donor who lacked the CCR5 coreceptor protein may, or may not, be virus free. Confirmation and
long-term follow-up of this finding, as well as development

of other techniques to exploit this coreceptor block as a
method of virus elimination, are currently underway.
The discovery that CXCR4 and CCR5 serve as coreceptors
for HIV-1 on T cells and macrophages, respectively, explained
why some strains of HIV-1 preferentially infect T cells
(T-tropic strains), whereas others prefer macrophages
(M-tropic strains). T-tropic strains use the CXCR4 coreceptor,
whereas M-tropic strains use CCR5 (Figure 18-15). This also
helped to explain some observed roles of chemokines in virus
replication. It was known from in vitro studies that certain
chemokines, such as RANTES, had a negative effect on virus
replication. CCR5 and CXCR4 cannot bind simultaneously to
HIV-1 and to their natural chemokine ligands. Competition
for the receptor between the virus and the natural chemokine
ligand can thus block viral entry into the host cell. Early
enthusiasm for the use of these chemokines as antiviral agents
was dampened when significant RANTES expression was
observed in some HIV-1 infected individuals who progress to
disease, with no obvious antiviral effect. Despite this, an
antagonist of CCR5 has recently been approved for use as a
therapeutic inhibitor of HIV spread (see below).

Infection with HIV-1 Leads to Gradual
Impairment of Immune Function
Isolation of HIV-1 and its growth in culture allowed purification of viral proteins and the development of tests for
infection with the virus. The most commonly used test is an
ELISA (see Chapter 20) to detect the presence of antibodies
directed against proteins of HIV-1, especially the gag p24
protein (see Figures 18-10a and 18-12b), one of the most
immunogenic of the HIV proteins. These antibodies generally appear in the serum of infected individuals within 6 to
12 weeks after exposure, but can take up to 6 months to
appear. When antibodies appear in the blood, the individual
is said to have seroconverted or to be seropositive for HIV-1.
Positive p24 ELISA results are then confirmed using the
more specific Western blot technique, which detects the
presence of antibodies against several HIV-1 proteins.

FIGURE 18-16 The typical course of an HIV infection.
Soon after infection, viral RNA is detectable in the serum. However,
HIV infection is most commonly detected by the presence of anti-HIV
antibodies after seroconversion, which normally occurs within a few
months after infection. Clinical symptoms indicative of AIDS generally do not appear for up to 8 years after infection, but this interval is
variable, especially when antiretroviral therapy is used. The onset of
clinical AIDS is usually signaled by a decrease in T-cell numbers and
a sharp increase in viral load. [Adapted from A. Fauci et al., 1996, Immunopathogenic mechanisms of HIV infection. Annals of Internal Medicine 124:654.]

Although the precise course of HIV-1 infection and disease onset varies considerably in different patients, a general
scheme for the progression to AIDS can be outlined (Figure 18-16). First, there is the acute, or primary, stage of
infection. This is the period immediately after infection,
where there are often no detectable anti-HIV-1 antibodies.
Estimates vary, but some reports find that more than half of
the individuals undergoing primary infection experience
flu-like symptoms, including fever, lymphadenopathy (swollen lymph nodes), and malaise approximately 2 to 4 weeks
after exposure. During this acute phase, HIV-1 infection is
spreading and the viral load (number of virions) in the
blood as well as in other body fluids can be quite high, elevating the risk of transfer to others. For unknown reasons,
seroconversion, or the appearance of antibody against HIV
antigens, can take months to develop.
This stage is followed by an asymptomatic period during
which there is a gradual decline in CD4⫹ T cells but usually
no outward symptoms of disease. This is driven by an
immune response involving both antibody and cytotoxic
CD8⫹ T lymphocytes that keeps viral replication in check
and drives down the viral load. The length of this asymptomatic window varies greatly and is likely due to a combination
of host and viral factors. Although the infected individual

normally has no clinical signs of disease at this stage, viral
replication continues, CD4⫹ cell levels gradually fall, and
viral load in the circulation can be measured by PCR assays
for viral RNA. These measurements of viral load have
assumed a major role in the determination of the patient’s
status and prognosis. Even when the level of virus in the
circulation is stable, large amounts of virus are produced in
infected CD4⫹ T cells; as many as 109 virions are released
every day and continually infect and destroy additional host
T cells. Despite this high rate of replication, the virus is kept
in check by the immune system throughout the asymptomatic phase of infection, and the level of virus in circulation
from about 6 months after infection (the set point) can be a
predictor of the course of disease. Low levels of virus in this
period correlate with a longer asymptomatic period and
opportunistic pathogen-free window.
Without treatment, most HIV-1 infected patients eventually progress to AIDS, where opportunistic infection is
the hallmark. Diagnosis of AIDS occurs only once four
criteria have been met: evidence of infection with HIV-1
(presence of antibodies or viral RNA in blood), greatly
diminished numbers of CD4⫹ T cells (⬍ 200 cells/␮l of
blood), impaired or absent delayed-type hypersensitivity
reactions, and the occurrence of opportunistic infections
(Table 18-3). The first overt indication of AIDS is often
opportunistic infection with the fungus Candida albicans,
which causes the appearance of sores in the mouth (thrush)
and, in women, a vulvovaginal yeast infection that does not
respond to treatment. A persistent hacking cough caused
by P. carinii infection of the lungs is another early indicator.
A rise in the level of circulating HIV-1 in the plasma (viremia) and a concomitant drop in the number of CD4⫹
T cells generally precedes this first appearance of symptoms.
Late-stage AIDS patients generally succumb to tuberculosis, pneumonia, severe wasting diarrhea, or various malignancies. Without treatment, the time between acquisition
of the virus and death from the immunodeficiency averages 9 to 11 years.

Active Research Investigates the Mechanism
of Progression to AIDS
Of intense interest to immunologists are the events that take
place between the initial encounter with HIV-1 and the takeover and collapse of the host immune system. Understanding how the immune system holds HIV-1 in check during
the asymptomatic phase could aid in the design of effective
therapeutic and preventive strategies. For this reason, the
handful of HIV-1 infected individuals who remain asymptomatic for very long periods without treatment (long-term
nonprogressors), estimated to be ⬍ 2% of HIV-1⫹ individuals in the United States, are the subject of intense study.
Another group of heavily studied individuals consists of
those in high-risk groups, such as many prostitutes. From
the study of virus-immune system interactions in the handful of individuals in these high-risk groups who remain

seronegative despite known and repeated exposure, we hope
to gain clues to mechanisms of control or possibly even protection. In addition to the discovery of CCR5 deletion (see
above), several interesting findings have emerged from
studying high-risk populations, including the presence of
strong CD8⫹ T-cell responses against HIV in many of these
individuals, as well as HLA-associated influences on disease
susceptibility.

Although the viral load in plasma remains fairly stable
throughout the period of chronic HIV infection, examination of the lymph nodes and gastrointestinal (GI) tract
tissue reveals a different picture. Fragments of nodes
obtained by biopsy from infected subjects show high levels
of infected cells at all stages of infection; in many cases, the
structure of the lymph node is completely destroyed by
virus long before plasma viral load increases above the

Panels (a) and (c) show the intestinal tract of a normal individual and

with obvious large lymphoid aggregates (arrows, a) and CD4⫹ T cells
stained with antibody (brown color, c). Similar analysis of samples
from an HIV⫹ patient in the acute stage of infection in panels (b) and

steady-state level. In fact, data from 2004 show that the gut
may be the main site of HIV-1 replication and CD4⫹ T-cell
depletion. Work from the laboratories of Ashley Haase and
Daniel Douek indicates a dramatic depletion of lymphoid
tissue and specifically CD4⫹ T cells from the GI tract
during HIV infection, starting as early as the acute stages
of infection (Figure 18-17). Subsequent investigations of
the association between the GI tract and HIV have suggested that TH17 cells, which express both the CCR5 and
CXCR4 coreceptors, are the primary targets of infection
and destruction. These TH17 cells are thought to play an
important role in homeostatic regulation of the innate and
adaptive responses to microbial flora in the gut. Destruction of these cells and disruption of the integrity of the
mucosal barrier in the GI tract may allow for the translocation of microbial products across the epithelial lining,
explaining some of the rampant immune stimulation that
is characteristic of HIV infection. In a deadly feedback
loop, this immune stimulation generates yet more activated CD4⫹ cells, the favored targets for HIV infection and
replication.
The severe decrease in CD4⫹ T cells is a clinical hallmark of AIDS, and several explanations have been advanced
for it. In early studies, direct viral infection and destruction
of CD4⫹ T cells was discounted as the primary cause,
because the large numbers of circulating HIV-infected
T cells predicted by the model were not found. More recent
studies indicate that it is difficult to find the infected cells

because they are so rapidly killed by HIV (the half-life of an
actively infected CD4⫹ T cell is less than 1.5 days) and
because most of the infected cells may localize to the GI
tract. Smaller numbers of CD4⫹ T cells become infected
but do not actively replicate virus. These latently infected
cells persist for long periods, and the integrated proviral
DNA replicates in cell division along with cell DNA. Studies in which viral load is decreased by antiretroviral therapy show a concurrent increase in CD4⫹ T-cell numbers in
the peripheral blood and eventually in the gut. Apoptosis
due to nonspecific immune activation and bystander effects
of free virus or infected cells acting on uninfected cells
have also been postulated to play a role in HIV-induced
lymphopenia.
Although depletion of CD4⫹ T cells is the primary focus
of follow-up testing in HIV-infected individuals, other
immunologic consequences involving both adaptive and
innate immune functions can be observed during the progression to AIDS. These include a decrease or absence of
delayed-type hypersensitivity to antigens for which the individual normally reacts, decreased serum immunoglobulins
(especially IgG and IgA), and impaired cellular responses to
antigens. Generally, the HIV-infected individual loses the
ability to mount T-cell responses in a predictable sequence:
responses to specific recall antigens (e.g., influenza virus) are
lost first, then response to alloantigens declines, and finally
mitogenic responses to stimuli disappear. Innate responses
are also impacted, including NK and dendritic cell functions.

Table 18-4 lists some immune abnormalities common to

Individuals infected with HIV-1 often display dysfunction of the central and peripheral nervous systems, especially
in the later stages of infection. Viral sequences have been
detected by HIV-1 probes in the brains of children and
adults with AIDS, suggesting that viral replication occurs
there. Quantitative comparison of specimens from brain,
lymph node, spleen, and lung of AIDS patients with progressive encephalopathy indicated that the brain was heavily infected. A frequent complication in later stages of HIV
infection is AIDS dementia, a neurological syndrome characterized by abnormalities in cognition, motor performance, and behavior. It remains unknown whether or not
AIDS dementia and other pathological effects observed in

the central nervous systems of infected individuals are a
direct effect of HIV-1 on the brain, a consequence of
immune responses to the virus, or a result of infection by
opportunistic agents.

Therapeutic Agents Inhibit Retrovirus
Replication
Development of a vaccine to prevent the spread of AIDS is
the highest priority for immunologists. Meanwhile, drugs
that can reverse the effects of HIV-1 have greatly improved
the outlook for infected individuals. There are several
strategies for the development of effective antiviral drugs
that take advantage of the life cycle of HIV (Figure 18-18).
The key to success for such therapies is that they must be

FIGURE 18-18 Stages in the viral replication cycle that provide
targets for therapeutic antiretroviral drugs. The first licensed drugs with
anti-HIV activity interfered with reverse
transcription of viral RNA to cDNA (3), followed by drugs which blocked the viral
protease that cleaves precursor proteins
into the peptides needed to assemble
new virions (5). In the past decade,
newer drugs have come on the market
that interfere with other steps in the viral
life cycle, such as HIV coreceptor attachment (1) or fusion to the cell membrane
(2), as well as the viral integrase necessary for insertion of proviral DNA into the
host cell chromosome (4).

Figure 18-18); several drugs that use two possible mechanisms of action operate at this step. The second generation
of drugs inhibits the viral protease ( 5 in Figure 18-18)
required to cleave precursor proteins into the units needed
for construction of new mature virions. This was followed
by development of an inhibitor of the viral gp41 that
blocks fusion of virus with the host cell membrane ( 2 in
Figure 18-18), inhibiting new infection of cells. The two
newest antiviral agents on the market target attachment of
the virus to the cell by competition for access to the
CCR5 chemokine coreceptor used by the virus ( 1 in Figure 18-18) or interfere with integrase ( 4 in Figure 18-18)
required for insertion of the viral genome into host cell
DNA. Table 18-5 lists the currently available categories of
anti-HIV therapies, along with the year in which they
were first approved for use. It should be stressed that the
development of any drug to the point at which it can be
used for patients is a long and arduous procedure. The
drugs that pass the rigorous tests for safety and efficacy
represent a small fraction of those that receive initial
consideration.
There are two possible strategies for developing pharmaceutical agents that can interfere with reverse transcription: nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs)
and non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors
(NNRTIs). The prototype and earliest (approved in 1987)
of the drugs that interferes with reverse transcription was
zidovudine, or azidothymidine (AZT), in the NRTI class.

Immunodeficiency Disorders
The introduction of AZT, a nucleoside analogue and competitive inhibitor of the enzyme, into the growing cDNA
chain of the retrovirus causes termination of the chain.
AZT is effective in some but not all patients, and its efficacy
is further limited because long-term use has adverse side
effects and because resistant viral mutants develop in treated
patients. The administered AZT is used not only by the
HIV-1 reverse transcriptase (RT) but also by human DNA
polymerase. The incorporation of AZT into the DNA of
host cells kills them. Precursors of red blood cells and other
rapidly dividing cells are especially sensitive to AZT, resulting in anemia and other side effects. NNRTI drugs inhibit
the action of RT by binding to a different site on the
enzyme. These noncompetitive inhibitors of RT have less of
an adverse effect on host proteins, and therefore fewer side
effects. However, they are still susceptible to the development of resistance as the virus mutates, and for this reason
are typically only used in combination with other anti-HIV
drugs that have different targets. Nevirapine, licensed in
1996, was the first such compound designed to treat HIV,
but since then many more such drugs have come on the
market.
A separate class of drugs, called protease inhibitors,
target the HIV-1 protease that cleaves viral protein precursors into the peptides required for packaging into virions
in the final stages of HIV replication. The first of the protease inhibitors, saquinavir, came to market in the mid1990s, but many more have emerged since then. They are
most commonly used today as a part of a multidrug cocktail designated as highly active antiretroviral therapy
(HAART). In most cases, this combines the use of three or
more anti-HIV drugs from different classes. The combination strategy appears to overcome the ability of the virus to
rapidly produce mutants that are drug resistant. In many
cases, HAART has lowered plasma viral load to levels that
are not detectable by current methods and has improved
the health of AIDS patients to the point that they can
again function at a normal level. The decrease in the number of AIDS deaths in the United States in recent years is
attributed to this advance in therapy. Despite the optimism engendered by success with HAART, present drawbacks include the need for consistent adherence to this
regimen, lest viral drug-resistant mutants be favored in the
patient. In addition, some patient may experience serious
side effects that become too severe to allow the use of
HAART. This said, access to multiple drugs within most of
the drug categories in the United States makes substitution
possible.
The success of HAART has led researchers to wonder
whether it might be possible to eradicate all virus from an
infected individual and thus actually cure AIDS. Most
AIDS experts are not convinced that this is feasible, mainly
because of the persistence of latently infected CD4⫹ T cells
and macrophages, which can serve as a reservoir of infectious virus if and when the provirus becomes reactivated.

Even with a viral load beneath the level of detection by
PCR assays, the immune system may not recover sufficiently to clear virus should it begin to replicate in response
to some activation signal. In addition, virus may persist in
sites, such as the brain, that are not readily penetrated by
the antiretroviral drugs, even though the virus in circulation is undetectable. The use of immune modulators, such
as recombinant IL-2 and IL-7 as adjuvants to HAART, is
being examined as a strategy to help reconstitute the
immune system and restore normal immune function, with
mixed results.
Some forms of antiviral therapy may also work to prevent
HIV infection in individuals at high risk. Based on studies
completed in 2011 and 2012, when both partners in an HIV
discordant couple (where one is infected and the other is
not) were given a cocktail of two NRTIs, rates of sexual
transmission of HIV dropped by 60% to 75%. Cost considerations aside, this pre-exposure prophylaxis (or PrEP) treatment was approved by the FDA in 2012 as a preventive
measure for healthy, HIV-negative individuals at high risk of
infection.

A Vaccine May Be the Only Way to Stop
the HIV/AIDS Epidemic
The AIDS epidemic continues to rage despite the advances
in therapeutic approaches outlined above. The expense of
HAART (roughly $1000/month in the United States), the
strict adherence required to avoid development of resistance,
and the possibility of side effects preclude universal application. At present, it appears that the best option to stop the
spread of AIDS is a safe, effective vaccine that prevents infection and/or progression to disease. The cause of AIDS was
discovered over 25 years ago. Why don’t we have an AIDS
vaccine by now?
The best way to approach an answer to this question is to
examine the specific challenges presented by HIV-1. HIV
mutates rapidly, creating a moving target for both the
immune response and any vaccine design. This means that
there are many possible variants of the virus to contend with
in any one geographical location, not even considering many
different countries. We know from HIV seropositive individuals that the development of humoral immunity during a
natural infection, even the presence of neutralizing antibodies, does not necessarily inhibit viral spread. This means that
a strong humoral response alone is unlikely to block infection. Despite years of study, data from long-term nonprogressor and exposed seronegative individuals have shed little
light on the immune correlates of protection from disease or
infection. Without clear goalposts, it is difficult to know
which types of cellular immune response will be most effective, or when we have reached enough of a response to protect against a natural infection. In addition, good animal
models for testing these fledgling vaccines are limited and
expensive.

Still, valuable lessons have been learned from over a
decade of HIV vaccine initiatives, both from studies in
nonhuman primates and from clinical trials in humans
(Table 18-6). The earliest of these trials in humans aimed
at eliciting humoral immunity to neutralize incoming
virus. This approach used purified envelope protein from
HIV (specifically, gp120) as an immunogen. These studies,
completed in the United States and Thailand in 2003,
showed weak neutralizing antibody responses and no protection from infection. This was followed by a new wave of
vaccine design aimed at eliciting cellular immunity to the
virus using recombinant viral vectors that would better
mimic natural infection. The initial vector chosen was
adenovirus serotype 5 (Ad5), carrying recombinant DNA
derived from the gag, pol, and nef genes of HIV-1. Ad5 is
derived from a naturally occurring human virus to which
between 30% and 80% of individuals (depending on geographic location) have previously been exposed, appearing
to make this a safe vector choice. These trials included two
stages of vaccination: an initial priming dose followed by a
vaccine boost using the same vector. Initially conducted in
the Americas, the Caribbean, and Australia, these human
trials began in 2003 but were halted prematurely in 2007,
midway through the trial period, because they did not
demonstrate the desired reduction in viral load for those
volunteers who became infected after receiving the vaccine. More important, the rate of infection appeared to be
higher in the vaccinated group of the trial than in the placebo control population, especially among individuals
who had pretrial immune responses to adenovirus. This
was a resounding blow to the AIDS research community
and sent many vaccine design teams back to the drawing
board.
These disappointing results have led to new thinking in
terms of targets for the next wave of HIV-1 vaccine design:

vaccines that elicit both humoral and cellular immunity. One
trial using this strategy has recently been completed. It used
a prime-boost combination with a recombinant DNA vector
containing HIV-1 genes (the prime) followed by peptides
derived from the virus (the boost). The vector chosen was
canarypox, a virus that does not replicate in humans and
that was engineered to carry DNA from the env, gag, and the
portion of pol that encodes the protease of HIV-1. The
protocol also included a boost with a companion vaccine
consisting of an engineered version of HIV-1 gp120 protein.
Results from this study were modest but promising, demonstrating an approximately 30% reduction in infection rates
among the vaccine treated group compared to the matched
placebo control population. Although statistically significant, these results are still far from the near 100% protection
rate that is the aim for all vaccines against infectious disease.
Nevertheless, this is one of the first really promising steps
forward in HIV vaccine research. In 2009, trials were
launched for a new DNA vaccine containing six plasmids
representing multiple clades of env genes plus single clade
gag, pol, and nef (prime), followed by an adenoviral vector
containing the same genes (boost). Results from this trial,
which expanded its scope in 2011, are still pending.
It is clear that development of an HIV vaccine is not a
simple exercise in classic vaccinology. More research is
needed to understand how this viral attack against the
immune system can be thwarted. Although much has been
written about the subject and large-scale initiatives are
proposed, the path to an effective vaccine is not obvious. It
is certain only that all data must be carefully analyzed and
that all possible means of creating immunity must be
tested. This is one of the greatest public health challenges of
our time. An intense and cooperative effort will be required
to devise, test, and deliver a safe and effective vaccine for
AIDS.

Immunodeficiency results from the failure of one or more
components of the immune system. Primary immunodeficiencies are based on genetic defects present at birth;
secondary or acquired immunodeficiencies arise from a
variety of external causes.
Immunodeficiencies may be classified by the cell types
involved and may affect either the lymphoid- or the
myeloid-cell lineage, or both.
Combined immunodeficiencies (CIDs) disrupt adaptive
immunity by interfering with both T-cell and B-cell
responses. Severe combined immunodeficiency, or SCID,
is the most extreme form of CID and arises from a lack of
functional T cells, which also manifests as no T-cell help
for B-cell responses.
Genetic failures of thymic development and major histocompatibility (MHC) expression can lead to CID because
of the disruption of T-cell development.
B-cell immunodeficiencies, which are associated with susceptibility to bacterial infection, can range from single
isotype defects to total disruptions of humoral immunity.
Selective immunoglobulin deficiencies are the less-severe
form of B-cell deficiency and result from defects in more
highly differentiated cell types.
Myeloid immunodeficiencies cause impaired phagocytic
function. Affected individuals suffer from increased susceptibility to bacterial infection.
Complement deficiencies are relatively common and vary
in their clinical impact, but are generally associated with
increased susceptibility to bacterial infection.
Immunodeficiencies that disrupt immune regulation can
lead to overactive immune responses that manifest as
autoimmune syndromes.
Immunodeficiency disorders can be treated by replacement of defective or missing proteins, cells, or genes.

Administration of human immunoglobulin is a common
treatment, especially for those disorders that primarily
disrupt antibody responses.
■

Animal models for immunodeficiency include nude and
SCID mice. Targeted gene knockout mice provide a means
to study the role of specific genes in immune function.

■

Secondary or acquired immunodeficiency can result from
immunosuppressive drugs, infection, and malnutrition;
the most well-known form of this is AIDS, caused by
human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1), which is a
retrovirus.

■

HIV-1 infection is spread by contact with infected body
fluids such as occurs during sex, intravenous drug use,
and from mother to infant during childbirth or breastfeeding.

■

The HIV-1 genome contains three structural and six regulatory genes that encode the proteins necessary for infection and propagation in host cells.

■

HIV-1 uses the host CD4 molecule as well as a chemokine
coreceptor (CCR5 or CXCR4) to attach to and fuse with
host cells.

■

Infection with HIV-1 results in gradual and severe impairment of immune function, marked by depletion of CD4⫹
T cells, especially in the gut, and can result in death from
opportunistic infection.

■

Treatment of HIV infection with antiretroviral drugs that
target specific steps in the viral life cycle, especially in
combination, can lower the viral load and provide relief
from some symptoms of infection. However, no cures for
HIV are available.

■

Efforts to develop a vaccine for HIV-1 have been only
modestly successful. The millions of new infections
occurring yearly emphasize the need for an effective
vaccine.

Cancer and the Immune
System

A

s the death toll from infectious disease has
declined in the Western world, cancer has
become the second leading cause of death,
topped only by heart disease. Current
estimates project that half of all men and one in three
women in the United States will develop cancer at some
point in their lifetimes, and that one in five will die from
it. From an immunologic perspective, cancer cells can be
viewed as altered self cells that have escaped normal
growth-regulating mechanisms. This chapter examines
the unique properties of cancer cells, giving particular
attention to those properties that can be recognized by
the immune system. We then describe the immune
responses that develop against cancer cells, as well as the
methods by which cancers manage to evade those
responses. The final section surveys current clinical and
experimental immunotherapies for cancer.
In most organs and tissues of a mature animal, a
balance is maintained between cell renewal and cell death.
The various types of mature cells in the body have a given
life span; as these cells die, new cells are generated by the
proliferation and differentiation of various types of stem
cells. This cell growth and proliferation are essential for
wound healing and homeostasis. Under normal
circumstances in the adult, the production of new cells is
regulated so that the number of any particular type of cell
remains fairly constant. Occasionally, however, cells arise
that no longer respond to normal growth control
mechanisms; these cells proliferate in an unregulated
manner, giving rise to cancer. In the following sections,
we first cover common terminology related to cancer, and
then discuss the pathways that can lead to this
uncontrolled cell growth.

Terminology and Common Types
of Cancer
Cells that give rise to clones of cells that can expand in an
uncontrolled manner will produce a tumor or neoplasm. A
tumor that is not capable of indefinite growth and does not
invade the healthy surrounding tissue extensively is said to

be benign. A tumor that continues to grow and becomes
progressively more invasive is called malignant; the term
cancer refers specifically to a malignant tumor. In addition to
uncontrolled growth, malignant tumors exhibit metastasis,
whereby small clusters of cancerous cells dislodge from the
original tumor, invade the blood or lymphatic vessels, and
are carried to other distant tissues, where they take up residence and continue to proliferate. In this way, a primary
tumor at one site can give rise to a secondary tumor at
another site (Figure 19-1).
Malignant tumors or cancers are classified according to
the embryonic origin of the tissue from which the tumor is
derived. Most (80–90%) are carcinomas, tumors that arise
from epithelial origins such as skin, gut, or the epithelial lining of internal organs and glands. Skin cancers and the
majority of cancers of the colon, breast, prostate, and lung
are carcinomas. The leukemias, lymphomas, and myelomas
are malignant tumors of hematopoietic cells derived from
the bone marrow and account for about 9% of cancer incidence

in the United States. Leukemias proliferate as single detached
cells, whereas lymphomas and myelomas tend to grow as
tumor masses. Sarcomas, which arise less frequently (around
1% of the incidence of cancer in the United States), are
derived from mesodermal connective tissues, such as bone,
fat, and cartilage.
Historically, the leukemias were classified as acute or
chronic according to the clinical progression of the disease.
The acute leukemias appeared suddenly and progressed rapidly, whereas the chronic leukemias were much less aggressive and developed slowly as mild, barely symptomatic
diseases. These clinical distinctions apply to untreated leukemias; with current treatments, the acute leukemias often
have a good prognosis, and permanent remission is possible.
Now the major distinction between acute and chronic leukemias is the maturity of the cell involved. Acute leukemias
tend to arise in less mature cells, whereas chronic leukemias
arise in mature cells, although each can arise from lymphoid

or myeloid lineages. The acute leukemias include acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL) and acute myelogenous leukemia (AML). These diseases can develop at any age and have
a rapid onset. The chronic leukemias include chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML), which develop more slowly and are seen
primarily in adults.

Malignant Transformation of Cells
Much has been learned about cancer from in vitro studies of
primary cells. Treatment of normal cultured cells with specific
chemical agents, irradiation, and certain viruses can alter their
morphology and growth properties. In some cases, this process leads to unregulated growth and produces cells capable of
growing as tumors when they are injected into animals.
Such cells are said to have undergone transformation, or

Cancer and the Immune System
malignant transformation, and they often exhibit properties
in vitro similar to those of cancer cells that form in vivo. For
example, they have decreased requirements for the survival
factors required by most cells (such as growth factors and
serum), are no longer anchorage dependent, and grow in a
density-independent fashion. Moreover, both cancer cells
and transformed cells can be subcultured in vitro indefinitely; that is, for all practical purposes, they are immortal.
Because of the similar properties of cancer cells and transformed cells, the process of malignant transformation has
been studied extensively as a model of cancer induction.

DNA Alterations Can Induce Malignant
Transformation
Transformation can be induced by various chemical substances (such as formaldehyde, DDT, and some pesticides),
physical agents (e.g., asbestos), and ionizing radiation; all are
linked to DNA mutations. For this reason, these agents are
commonly referred to as carcinogens. The International
Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) tracks the most common causes of cancer in humans and maintains lists of potential cancer-causing agents (see Useful Web Sites). Infection
with certain viruses, most of which share the property of
integrating into the host cell genome and disrupting chromosomal DNA, can also lead to transformation. Table 19-1 lists
the most common viruses associated with cancer. Although
the activity of each of these agents is associated with cancer
initiation, thanks to the variety of DNA repair mechanisms
present in our cells, exposure to carcinogens does not always
lead to cancer. Instead, a confluence of factors must occur
before enough changes to normal cellular genes occurs to

induce malignant transformation, as we discuss further in
the following sections.

The Discovery of Oncogenes Paved the Way
for Our Understanding of Cancer Induction
The discovery that disruption of normal cellular genes can
lead to cancer came from studies done with cancer-causing
viruses. In 1916, Peyton Rous, working at the Rockefeller
Institute, showed that cells cultured with a particular retrovirus underwent malignant transformation. This virus was
later named Rous sarcoma virus. Fifty years after his initial
results, Rous was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology or
Medicine for his discoveries, which led to the term oncogene, from the Greek word ónkos (which means “mass” or
“tumor”). This term was originally used to describe the
unique genetic material present in certain viruses that promotes malignant transformation of infected cells.
In 1971, Howard Temin suggested that oncogenes might
not be unique to transforming viruses but might also be
found in normal cells. Temin proposed that a virus might
acquire a normal growth-promoting gene from the genome
of a cell it infects. He called these normal cellular genes
proto-oncogenes to distinguish them from the cancerpromoting sequences carried by some viruses (viral oncogenes, or v-onc). The following year, R. J. Huebner and G. J.
Todaro proposed that mutations or genetic rearrangements
of in situ proto-oncogenes by carcinogens or viruses might
alter the normally regulated function of these genes, converting them into cancer inducers, called cellular oncogenes
(c-onc; Figure 19-2). Considerable evidence supporting this
hypothesis accumulated in subsequent years. For example,
some malignantly transformed cells contain multiple copies
of cellular oncogenes, leading to increases in oncogene products. Such amplification of cellular oncogenes has been
observed in cells from various types of human cancers.
In the mid-1970s, J. Michael Bishop and Harold E. Varmus at the University of California, San Francisco, again
used the Rous retrovirus to establish the origins of these
viral oncogenes. Retroviruses have RNA genomes that must
be reverse-transcribed into DNA during their life cycle, followed by integration of this DNA into the host-cell chromosome. Retroviruses therefore make intimate contact with the
genomes of their host cell, especially those genes that happen to become their neighbors following chromosomal
integration. In elegant studies that led to another Nobel
Prize in 1989, Bishop and Varmus demonstrated that the
oncogene carried by Rous sarcoma virus (later called v-src)
was in fact just a version of a normal growth-promoting cellular gene (c-src) found throughout many species and probably acquired previously from a host cell during viral
replication. By randomly incorporating this normal cellular
gene into its own genome, the Rous sarcoma virus acquired
the ability to induce malignant transformation in the cells it
infected, giving it a selective advantage. The evidence that
oncogenes alone could induce malignant transformation

FIGURE 19-2 The relationship of proto-oncogenes to
oncogenes. The process of malignant transformation can result
from infection with transforming viruses, which carry oncogene sequences, or via carcinogen-induced conversion of a wild-type protooncogene into a cellular oncogene, sometimes compounded by
genetic predisposition in the host cell. Cellular oncogenes arise due
to DNA changes that alter expression of proto-oncogenes, including
DNA mutations that result in the production of qualitatively different gene products (1), as well as DNA amplification or chromosomal
translocation, leading to increased or decreased expression of these
gene products (2).

came again from studies of the v-src oncogene; when this
oncogene was cloned and transfected into normal cells in
culture, the cells underwent malignant transformation.

Genes Associated with Cancer Control Cell
Proliferation and Survival
Normal tissues maintain homeostasis through a tightly regulated process of cell proliferation balanced by cell death. An
imbalance at either end of the scale encourages development
of a cancerous state. The genes involved in these homeostatic
processes work by producing proteins that either encourage
or discourage cellular proliferation and survival. Not surprisingly, it is the disruption of these same growth-regulating
genes that accounts for most, if not all, forms of cancer. The
activities of these proteins can occur anywhere in the pathway, from signaling events at the surface of the cell, to intracellular signal transduction processes and nuclear events.

Normal cellular genes that are associated with the formation of cancer fall into three major categories based on
their activities: oncogenes, tumor-suppressor genes, and
genes involved in programmed cell death, or apoptosis
(Table 19-2). As discussed earlier, oncogenes are involved
in cell growth-promoting processes. On the flip side, tumorsuppressor genes play the opposite role in homeostasis,
dampening cellular growth and proliferation. Unlike oncogenes, which become the villain when their activity is
enhanced, tumor-suppressor genes, also known as antioncogenes, become involved in cancer induction when they
fail. Finally, many of the genes involved in apoptosis have
also been associated with cancer, as these genes either
enforce or inhibit cell death signals.
Recently, several unifying hallmarks have been proposed
that help to characterize the transition of non-neoplastic
cells to a cancerous state. These include sustained proliferation, subversion of negative growth regulators, and resistance to cell death—controlled, respectively, by the activity
of oncogenes, tumor-suppressor genes, and genes that regulate apoptosis. Other proposed hallmarks of cancer include
replicative immortality, the growth of new blood vessels
(also called angiogenesis), and the potential to invade other
tissues (metastasis). Two underlying factors that help to
enable the development of these hallmarks—genetic instability and inflammation—are also now recognized contributors
to tumorigenesis. In the last several years, the significance of
specific cells and chemical signals associated with the
immune response in both suppressing and encouraging
tumor development has been documented. Many of these
will be discussed further in the section later in this chapter
entitled “The Immune Response to Cancer.”
Cancer-Promoting Activity of Oncogenes
The proteins encoded by a particular oncogene and its corresponding proto-oncogene have a very similar function.
Sequence comparisons of viral and cellular oncogenes
reveal that they are highly conserved in evolution. Although
most cellular oncogenes consist of the typical series of
exons and introns, their viral counterparts consist of uninterrupted coding sequences, suggesting that the virus
acquired the oncogene through an intermediate RNA transcript from which the intron sequences were removed during RNA processing. The actual coding sequences of viral
oncogenes and the corresponding proto-oncogenes exhibit
a high degree of homology. In some cases, a single point
mutation is all that distinguishes a viral oncogene from the
corresponding proto-oncogene. In many cases, the conversion of a proto-oncogene into an oncogene accompanies a
mere change in the level of expression of a normal growthcontrolling protein.
One category of proto-oncogenes and their viral counterparts encodes growth factors or growth factor receptors.
Included among these are sis, which encodes a form of
platelet-derived growth factor, and fms, erbB, and neu, which
encode growth factor receptors (see Table 19-2). In normal

cells, the expression of growth factors and their receptors is
carefully regulated. Usually, one population of cells secretes
a growth factor that acts on another population of cells carrying the receptor for the factor, thus stimulating proliferation of the second population. Inappropriate expression of
either a growth factor or its receptor can result in uncon-

trolled proliferation. In breast cancer, increased synthesis of
the growth factor receptor encoded by c-neu has been linked
with a poor prognosis.
Other oncogenes in this category encode products that
function in signal transduction pathways or as transcription factors. The src and abl oncogenes encode tyrosine

kinases, and the ras oncogene encodes a GTP-binding
protein (see Table 19-2). The products of these genes act as
signal transducers. The myc, jun, and fos oncogenes all
encode transcription factors. Overactivity of any of these
oncogenes may result in unregulated proliferation.
Some transformations arise due to chromosomal translocations that bring proto-oncogenes under the control of
other genomic regions. For instance, a number of B- and
T-cell leukemias and lymphomas arise from translocations
involving immunoglobulin or T-cell receptor loci, very transcriptionally active regions in these cells. One of the best
characterized is the translocation of c-myc from its position
on chromosome 8 to the immunoglobulin heavy-chain
enhancer region on chromosome 14, accounting for 75% of
Burkitt’s lymphoma cases (Figure 19-3). In the remaining
patients with Burkitt’s lymphoma, c-myc remains on chromosome 8 but the ␬ or ␥ light-chain genes are translocated
to c-myc on the tip of chromosome 8. As a result of these
translocations, synthesis of the c-Myc protein, which functions as a transcription factor controlling the behavior of
many genes involved in cell growth and proliferation,

increases and allows unregulated cellular growth. The consequences of enhanced and constitutive myc expression in
lymphoid cells have been investigated in transgenic mice. In
one study, mice were engineered to express a transgene consisting of all three c-myc exons and the immunoglobulin
heavy-chain enhancer. Of 15 transgenic pups born, 13 developed lymphomas of the B-cell lineage within a few months
of birth.
Cellular transformation has also been associated with
mutations in proto-oncogenes. This may be a major mechanism by which chemical carcinogens or x-irradiation convert a proto-oncogene into a cancer-inducing oncogene. For
instance, single-point mutations in c-ras, which encodes a
GTPase, have been detected in carcinomas of the bladder,
colon, and lung (see Table 19-2). Alterations that result in
overactivity of the ras oncogene, part of the epidermal
growth factor (EGF) receptor signaling pathway, are seen in
up to 30% of all human cancers and nearly 90% of all pancreatic cancers.
Viral integration into the host-cell genome may in itself serve
to convert a proto-oncogene into a transforming oncogene. For

Cancer and the Immune System
example, avian leukosis virus (ALV) is a retrovirus that does
not carry any viral oncogenes, yet it is able to transform B cells
into lymphomas. This particular retrovirus has been shown to
integrate within the c-myc proto-oncogene, resulting in
increased synthesis of c-Myc. Some DNA viruses have also
been associated with malignant transformation, such as certain serotypes of the human papillomavirus (HPV), which are
linked with cervical cancer (see Table 19-1).
Tumor-Suppressor Genes
A second category of cancer-associated genes—called
tumor-suppressor genes, or anti-oncogenes—encodes proteins that inhibit excessive cell proliferation. In their normal
state, tumor-suppressor genes prevent cells from progressing through the cell cycle inappropriately, functioning like
brakes. A release of this inhibition is what can lead to cancer
induction. The prototype of this category of oncogenes is
Rb, the retinoblastoma gene (see Table 19-2). Hereditary
retinoblastoma is a rare childhood cancer in which tumors
develop from neural precursor cells in the immature retina.
The affected child inherits a mutated Rb allele; later,
somatic inactivation of the remaining Rb allele is what leads
to tumor growth. Unlike oncogenes where a single allele
alteration can lead to unregulated growth, tumor-suppressor
genes require a “two-hit” disabling sequence, as the one
functional allele is enough to suppress the development of
cancer.
Probably the single most frequent genetic abnormality in
human cancer, found in 60% of all tumors, is a mutation in
the TP53 gene. This tumor-suppressor gene encodes p53, a
nuclear phosphoprotein with multiple cellular roles, including involvement in growth arrest, DNA repair, and apoptosis. Over 90% of small-cell lung cancers and over 50% of
breast and colon cancers have been shown to be associated
with mutations in TP53.
The Role of Apoptotic Genes
A third category of cancer-associated genes is sequences
involved in programmed cell death, or apoptosis. These
genes can encode proteins that either induce or block apoptosis. Pro-apoptotic genes act like tumor suppressors, normally inhibiting cell survival, whereas anti-apoptotic genes
behave more like oncogenes, promoting cell survival. Thus,
a failure of the former or overactivity of the latter can
encourage neoplastic transformation of cells.
Included in this category are genes such as bcl-2, an antiapoptosis gene (see Table 19-2). This oncogene was originally discovered because of its association with B-cell
follicular lymphoma. Since its discovery, bcl-2 has been
shown to play an important role in regulating cell survival
during hematopoiesis and in the survival of selected B cells
and T cells during maturation. Interestingly, the EpsteinBarr virus (which can cause infectious mononucleosis) contains a gene that has sequence homology to bcl-2 and may
act in a similar manner to suppress apoptosis.

CHAPTER 19

633

Malignant Transformation Involves
Multiple Steps
The development from a normal cell to a cancerous cell is
typically a multistep process of clonal evolution driven by a
series of somatic mutations. These mutations progressively
convert the cell from normal growth to a precancerous state
and finally a cancerous state, where all barriers designed to
contain cell growth have been surmounted. Induction of
malignant transformation appears to involve at least two
distinct phases: initiation and promotion. Initiation involves
changes in the genome but does not, in itself, lead to malignant transformation. Malignant transformation can occur
during the rampant cell division that follows the initiation
phase, and results from the accumulation of new DNA
alterations, typically affecting proto-oncogenes, tumorsuppressor genes or apoptotic genes, that lead to truly
unregulated cellular growth.
The presence of myriad chromosomal abnormalities in
precancerous and cancerous cells lends support to the role of
multiple mutations in the development of cancer. This has
been demonstrated in human colon cancer, which typically
progresses in a series of well-defined morphologic stages
(Figure 19-4). Colon cancer begins as small, benign tumors
called adenomas in the colorectal epithelium. These precancerous tumors grow, gradually displaying increasing levels of
intracellular disorganization until they acquire the malignant phenotype (Figure 19-4b). The morphologic stages of
colon cancer have been correlated with a sequence of gene
changes (Figure 19-4a) involving inactivation or loss of three
tumor-suppressor genes (APC, DCC, and TP53) and activation of one cellular proliferation oncogene (K-ras).
Studies with transgenic mice also support the role of multiple steps in the induction of cancer. Transgenic mice
expressing high levels of Bcl-2, a protein encoded by the
anti-apoptotic gene bcl-2, develop a population of small resting B cells (derived from secondary lymphoid follicles) that
have greatly extended life spans. Gradually, these transgenic
mice develop lymphomas. Analysis of lymphomas from
these mice has shown that approximately half have a c-myc
translocation (a proto-oncogene) to the immunoglobulin
H-chain locus. The synergism of Myc and Bcl-2 is highlighted in double-transgenic mice produced by mating the
bcl-2⫹ transgenic mice with myc⫹ transgenic mice. These
mice develop leukemia very rapidly.
The role of DNA mutations and the progressive genomic
changes that can lead to the induction of cancer are clearly
illustrated by diseases such as xeroderma pigmentosum
(XP). This rare disorder is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner and is caused by defects in any one of a number
of genes involved in normal DNA repair, collectively known
as the nucleotide excision repair (NER) pathway. Individuals
with this disease are unable to repair ultraviolet (UV)induced mutations, which occur naturally with even moderate exposure to sunlight and are typically repaired via
the NER pathway. A buildup of unrepaired DNA in the

benign colorectal polyps progress to carcinoma following mutations
resulting in the inactivation or loss of three tumor-suppressor

cutaneous cells of young children with XP leads to random
genomic alterations, including to genes involved in regulating normal cell growth and division. This leads to unregulated growth of some cells, allowing further DNA mutations
to occur and promoting the development of neoplasms, such
as malignant melanoma or squamous cell carcinoma, the
most common forms of skin cancer in XP patients. The
mean age of skin cancer in children with XP is age 8, as compared to 60⫹ years of age in the general population. Figure 19-5 shows a child with the early skin manifestations
common to XP.
Accumulating data from several recent studies suggest
that within a growing tumor, not all cells have equal potential for unlimited growth. Clinical studies of at least three
different types of tumors, including those originating in the
gut, brain, and skin, all suggest that a subset of cells within a
tumor may be the true engines of tumor growth. This subset

tive potential, and is the major producer of the other cancer
cells, populating the mass of the tumor by sharing this unrestrained ability to divide. If these new discoveries prove valid
and can be applied more broadly, future therapies will
undoubtedly require that we hone in on these rare cancer
stem cells, cutting off the source of tumor cell expansion
and, potentially, providing hope for cancer eradication.

Tumor Antigens
Neoplastic cells are self cells and thus most of the antigens
associated with them are subject to the tolerance-inducing
processes that maintain homeostasis and inhibit the development of autoimmunity. However, unique or inappropriately expressed antigens can be found in many tumors and
are frequently detected by the immune system. Some of
these antigens may be the products of oncogenes, where

there is no qualitative difference between the oncogene and
proto-oncogene products; instead, it is merely increased
levels of the oncogene product that can be recognized by the
immune system.
Most tumor antigens give rise to peptides that are recognized by the immune system following presentation by self
major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules. In fact,
many of these antigens have been identified by their ability
to induce the proliferation of antigen-specific cytotoxic T
lymphocytes (CTLs) or helper T cells. To date, tumor antigens recognized by human T cells fall into one of four groups
based on their source:

• Antigens encoded by genes exclusively expressed by
tumors (e.g., viral genes)
• Antigens encoded by variant forms of normal genes that
are altered by mutation
• Antigens normally expressed only at certain stages of
development
• Antigens that are overexpressed in particular tumors
Table 19-3 lists several categories of common antigens
associated with tumors. As one can imagine, many clinical

research studies aim to utilize these antigens as diagnostic or
prognostic indicators, as well as therapeutic targets for
tumor elimination. There are two main types of tumor antigens, categorized by their uniqueness: tumor-specific antigens (TSAs) and tumor-associated antigens (TAAs).
Originally these were designated as transplantation antigens
(TSTAs and TATAs), stemming from studies in which these
antigens were discovered by transplanting them into recipient animals, inducing a rejection immune response.

mutations that lead to expression of altered self proteins or from
expression of viral antigens (not shown) in transformed cells. TAAs

Tumor-Specific Antigens Are Unique
to Tumor Cells
TSAs are unique proteins that may result from mutations in
tumor cells that generate altered proteins and, therefore, new
antigens. Cytosolic processing of these proteins then gives
rise to novel peptides that are presented with class I MHC
molecules (Figure 19-6), inducing a cell-mediated response
by tumor-specific CTLs. TSAs have been identified on
tumors induced with chemical or physical carcinogens, as
well as on some virally induced tumors.
Demonstrating the presence of TSAs on spontaneously
occurring or chemically induced tumors is particularly difficult. These antigens can be quite diverse and are only identified by their ability to induce T-cell-mediated rejection.
The immune response to such tumors typically eliminates all
of the tumor cells bearing sufficient numbers of these unique
antigens, and thus selects for cells bearing few or none.
Nonetheless, experimental methods have been developed to
facilitate the characterization of TSAs, which have been
shown to differ from normal cellular proteins by as little as a
single amino acid. Further characterization of TSAs has
demonstrated that many of these antigens are not cell membrane proteins; rather, they are short peptides derived from
cytosolic proteins that have been processed and presented
together with class I MHC molecules.
In contrast to chemically induced tumors, virally induced
tumors express tumor antigens shared by all tumors induced

unique expression patterns, such as an embryonic protein expressed
in the adult or overexpression of self proteins. Both types of tumor
antigens can be detected by the immune system following presentation in class I MHC.

by the same virus, making their characterization simpler. For
example, when syngeneic mice are injected with killed cells
from a particular polyoma virus-induced tumor, the recipients are protected against subsequent challenge with live
cells from any polyoma-induced tumors. Likewise, when
lymphocytes are transferred from mice with a virus-induced
tumor into normal syngeneic recipients, the recipients reject
subsequent transplants of all syngeneic tumors induced by
the same virus, suggesting that lymphocytes recognize and
kill cells expressing a virally derived TSA.
In some cases, the presence of virus-specific tumor antigens is an indicator of neoplastic transformation. In humans,
Burkitt’s lymphoma cells have been shown to express a nuclear
antigen of the Epstein-Barr virus that may indeed be a tumorspecific antigen for this type of tumor. HPV E6 and E7 proteins are found in more than 80% of invasive cervical cancers,
and they provide the clearest example of a virally encoded
tumor antigen. In fact, the first clinically approved cancer vaccine is one used to prevent infection with HPV and block the
emergence of cervical cancer (see Clinical Focus Box 19-1).

BOX 19-1

CLINICAL FOCUS

A Vaccine to Prevent Cervical Cancer, and More
Globally, cervical cancer is the third
leading cause of death among women, and
second only to breast cancer in terms of
cancer deaths in women. Over 500,000
women each year develop cervical cancer
(80% in developing countries), and approximately 275,000 women die from the disease
annually. Periodic cervical examination
(using the Papanicolaou test, or Pap smear)
to detect abnormal cervical cells significantly reduces the risk for women. However,
a health-care program that includes regular
Pap smears is commonly beyond the means
of the less advantaged and is largely unavailable in many developing countries.
Human papillomavirus (HPV), the most
common sexually transmitted infection, is
implicated in over 99% of cervical cancers.
HPV is also associated with most cases of
vaginal, vulval, anal, penile, and oropharyngeal (head and neck) cancers, as well as
genital warts. Among the hundred-plus genotypes of HPV, approximately 40 are associated with genital or oral infections. Two of
these, types 16 and 18, account for more
than 70% of all instances of cervical cancer,
whereas types 6 and 11 are most often
involved in HPV-associated genital warts.
It is estimated that the majority of sexually active men and women become
infected with HPV at some point in their
lives. A study of female college students at
the University of Washington published in
2003 showed that after 5 years, more than
60% of study participants (all of whom were
HPV negative when enrolled in the study)
became infected. Most infections are
resolved without disease; it is persistent
infection leading to cervical or anal intraepithelial neoplasia that is associated with high
cancer risk.
Preventing cervical cancer, therefore,
appears to be a matter of preventing HPV
infection. Gardasil (manufactured by Merck),
the first vaccine ever approved for the prevention of cancer, was licensed in 2006 for
the prevention of infection with HPV and
potential development of cervical cancer or
genital warts. This quadrivalent formulation
targets HPV types 6, 11, 16, and 18. Three
years later, GlaxoSmithKline received a

license for Cervarix, a vaccine to prevent
cervical cancer that targets only HPV types
16 and 18. These vaccines are between 95%
and 99% effective in preventing infection
by HPV. Conclusive evidence that this will
translate into significantly reduced rates of
cervical cancer in women, which can take
many years to develop, will not be available
until long-term follow-up studies have
been completed.
In June 2006, the federal Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP)
recommended routine HPV vaccination for
girls ages 11 to 12, and catch-up immunizations for females ages 13 to 26 who have
not already received the vaccine. Although
the committee did not recommend routine
immunization for boys at that time, it did
suggest that Gardasil be made available to
males ages 9 to 26. As of 2007, 25% of 13- to
17-year-old girls in the United States
reported receiving at least one dose of this
vaccine. In 2011, this number rose to 53% in
girls, still far short of targeted numbers
(~80%) and significantly lower than the
rates of compliance for most other routine
childhood vaccines (somewhere around
90%, depending on the age of the child).
In 2011, boys ages 11 to 13 were added
to the ACIP list of recommendations for
routine HPV vaccination. The hope is that
this will curb the rising tide of anal and
oropharyngeal cancers among men, but
also cut back the infection cycle and impact
rates of cervical cancer in women. However,
HPV vaccination rates among young men
remained at only 8% at the end of 2011. The
idea was that, with Gardasil in particular, the
ability to reduce the incidence of unsightly
genital warts might provide added incentive for male vaccination.
With a safe and effective vaccine against
a common and deadly cancer available for
several years, why are the rates of immunization in young people still so low? The
answer depends somewhat on the country
in question, as well as social and economic
factors. Especially in developing countries,
cost and ease of use are major barriers.
Development is currently underway for a
second generation of HPV vaccines, which

are more cost effective, easier to administer
and produce longer-lived immunity to a
broader range of HPV genotypes.
Controversy based on social and ethical
issues, as well as misinformation, are also
high on the list of reasons why HPV vaccination rates are believed to remain so low. In
U.S.-based studies of factors that influence
decisions to vaccinate adolescents against
HPV, mother’s attitudes, physician recommendations, and misunderstandings in all
groups were highlighted. For instance, since
HPV is a sexually transmitted infection, most
parents prefer to consider this an issue for
“the future,” assuming that their children are
not sexually active and that there is plenty of
time before a vaccine for a sexually transmitted disease should be considered. In fact,
based on the Centers for Disease Control
and Prevention (CDC) surveillance data from
2011, 47% of high school students in the U.S.
have had sexual intercourse; greater than
6% beginning before the age of 13. The HPV
vaccine regimen, which involves three
intramuscular injections administered over
a 6-month period, is most effective when
completed prior to exposure, and produces
the most robust immune response in 11- to
12-year-olds, the target population.
Physician recommendations are also key
to making a dent in the rates of HPV vaccination. In a 2011 study, women 19 to 26 years
old were asked about whether they had
received an HPV vaccine. In the group that
had received a provider recommendation,
85% were immunized, compared with only
5% among women who did not receive a
physician recommendation. More public
and professional information concerning
the advantages of this vaccine before the
onset of sexual activity, as well as the lifetime
risk of disease caused by HPV, may help drive
down the cycle of infection and worldwide
deaths due to this sexually transmitted killer.

The Immune System in Health and Disease

expressed only during specific developmental stages, such as
in the fetus, or at extremely low levels in normal conditions,
but which are upregulated in tumor cells (see Figure 19-6).
Those derived from mutation-induced reactivation of certain
fetal or embryonic genes, called oncofetal tumor antigens,
normally only appear early in embryonic development, before
the immune system acquires immunocompetence. When
transformation of cells causes them to appear at later stages of
development on neoplastic cells of the adult, they are recognized as nonself and induce an immunologic response.
Two well-studied oncofetal antigens are alpha-fetoprotein
(AFP) and carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA). AFP, the most
abundant fetal protein, drops from milligram levels in fetal
serum to between 5 ng/ml and 50 ng/ml after birth. Elevated
levels of this glycoprotein can also be found in women,
especially during the early stages of pregnancy. Significantly elevated AFP levels in nonpregnant adults are not
uncommon in ovarian, testicular, and liver cancers, where
serum levels above 300 ng/ml can be indicative of small
lesions even in asymptomatic individuals. Monitoring of
these levels can help clinicians to make prognoses and to
evaluate treatment efficacy, especially in liver cancer.
CEA is another oncofetal membrane glycoprotein found
on gastrointestinal and liver cells of 2- to 6-month-old
fetuses. Approximately 90% of patients with advanced
colorectal cancer and 50% of patients with early colorectal
cancer have increased levels of CEA in their serum; some
patients with other types of cancer also exhibit increased
CEA levels. However, because AFP and CEA can be found
in trace amounts in some normal adults and in some noncancerous disease states, the presence of these oncofetal
antigens is not necessarily diagnostic of tumors but can still
be used to monitor tumor growth. If, for example, a patient
has had surgery to remove a colorectal carcinoma, CEA
levels are monitored after surgery; an increase in the CEA
level is an indication that tumor growth has resumed.
In addition to embryonic antigens, the category of TAAs
also includes the products of some oncogenes, such as several growth factors and growth factor receptors. These proteins, although transcribed in the adult, are normally tightly
regulated and expressed only at low levels. For instance, a
variety of tumor cells express the epidermal growth factor
(EGF) receptor at levels 100 times greater than in normal
cells. Another, melanotransferrin, designated p97, has fibroblast growth factor-like activities. Whereas normal cells
express fewer than 8,000 molecules of p97 per cell, melanoma cells express 50,000 to 500,000 molecules per cell. The
gene that encodes p97 has been cloned, and a recombinant
vaccinia virus vaccine has been prepared that carries the
cloned gene. When this vaccine was injected into mice, it
induced both humoral and cell-mediated immune responses,
which protected the mice against live melanoma cells
expressing the p97 antigen. Targeting such oncogene products has yielded some significant clinical success, such as in
the case of breast cancers overexpressing HER2 (discussed
further in the final section of this chapter).

The Immune Response to Cancer
As mentioned earlier, cells have multiple built-in (or intrinsic) mechanisms to prevent cancer. One example is the NER
pathway of DNA repair, which encourages cell senescence
(permanent cell cycle arrest) or even apoptosis at the first
signs of unregulated growth. However, in the event that this
system fails, control mechanisms external to the cell can kick
in. At their most basic, these cell-extrinsic mechanisms
involve environmental signals that instruct a cell to activate
internal pathways leading to growth arrest or apoptosis, to
prevent cancer cell spread. For example, when epithelialcell/extracellular-matrix associations are disrupted due to
malignant transformation, death signals are triggered that
block proliferation and spread of these contact dependent
cells. Thus these extracellular attachments serve as inhibitors
of cell death, which when broken set off a safety mechanism
promoting apoptosis. If unregulated growth continues, identification and rejection of tumor cells by components of the
immune system may help salvage homeostasis. Although
several key immune cell types and effector molecules that
participate in this response have been identified in recent
years, much still remains to be learned about natural mechanisms of anti-tumor immunity and how best to induce these
in clinical settings.
For over a century, the controversy over whether and how
the immune system participates in cancer recognition and
destruction has raged. However, data collected in the past
couple of decades from both animal models and clinical
studies has clearly defined a role for the immune response in
tumor cell identification and eradication. To date, there are
three proposed mechanisms by which the immune system is
thought to control cancer:
• By destroying viruses that are known to transform cells
• By eliminating pathogens and reducing pro-tumor
inflammation
• By actively identifying and eliminating cancerous cells
This final mechanism, involving tumor cell identification
and eradication, is termed immunosurveillance. It posits
that the immune system continually monitors for and
destroys neoplastic cells. Evidence from animal models as
well as immune deficiency disorders and induced immune
suppression in humans supports this hypothesis. For
instance, AIDS patients and transplant recipients on immunosuppressive drugs have a much higher incidence of several
types of cancer than do individuals with fully competent
immune systems.
However, recent data also point to potential pro-tumor
influences of the immune response on cancer. For instance,
chronic inflammation and immune-mediated selection for
malignant cells may actually contribute to cancer cell spread
and survival. Contemporary studies of immunity to cancer
have now generated a more nuanced hypothesis of immune
involvement in neoplastic regulation. This model is called

immunoediting; it incorporates observations of both
tumor-inhibiting and tumor-enhancing processes mediated
by the immune system. In the following section we describe
this revised view of the role of the immune response in cancer.

immune system in cancer eradication or survival during
cancer immunoediting.

Immunoediting Both Protects Against and
Promotes Tumor Growth

As early as the 1860s, Rudolph Virchow observed that leukocytes infiltrate the site of a solid tumor, and he proposed a
link between inflammation and cancer induction. However,
as infiltrating leukocytes can be found in both cancers that
progress and those that resolve, the role of inflammation in
immunity to cancer was obscure. More recent scientific
advances have allowed a more detailed analysis of the location and type of cells involved, leading to the identification
of key indicators of cancer regression in certain types of
tumors. With this newfound knowledge, advances are being
made in cancer diagnostic tools, prognostic indicators, and
targets for clinical intervention.
Much of the research aimed at probing the relationship
between the immune system and cancer has employed mouse
model systems. Many or even most mice rendered immune
deficient via targeted gene knockouts or neutralizing antibodies display some increased incidence of cancer, be it
spontaneous or carcinogen induced. Likewise, spontaneous
or induced tumors in immune-competent mice have allowed
scientists to model human cancer induction and test hypotheses concerning specific cell types and immune pathways in
cancer eradication. Although many of the elements of both
innate and adaptive immunity can be linked in some way to
tumor-cell recognition and destruction, certain components
appear to play key roles in immune-mediated cancer control.
Studies in mice and humans have led to the awareness that
there are both “good” and “bad” forms of inflammation in the
response to cancer (e.g. Figure 19-7, bottom right). On the
good or anti-tumor side are innate responses dominated by
immune-activating macrophages (called M1), cross-presenting
dendritic cells (DCs; see Chapter 8), and NK cells. These cells
and the cytokines they produce help elicit strong TH1 and
CTL responses, which are associated with a good prognosis
and tumor regression. Conversely, the immune cell infiltrates
found in tumors that are more likely to progress and metastasize include anti-inflammatory macrophages (M2) and
myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs). Concomitantly,
adaptive responses to cancer dominated by the TH2 pathway
(and in some cases, also TH17 or Treg cells) are associated with
poorer clinical outcomes and reduced survival times. In the
following sections, we discuss in greater detail our developing
awareness of both the positive and negative relationships of
some of these specific pathways to cancer immunity.

In the mid-1990s, research in animal models of cancer suggested that natural immunity could eliminate tumors. Armed
with this understanding, researchers identified some of the
key cell types and effector molecules involved. Experimental
studies showed that mice lacking intact T-cell compartments
or interferon (IFN)-␥ signaling pathways were more susceptible to chemically induced or transplanted tumors, respectively. Likewise, RAG2 knockout mice, which fail to generate
T, B, or natural killer T (NKT) cells, were more likely to
spontaneously develop cancer as they aged and were more
susceptible to chemical carcinogens.
However, the real surprise came when scientists used the
same chemical carcinogen to induce tumors in both wildtype and RAG2 knockout mice, then adoptively transferred
these tumors into syngeneic wild-type recipients. (See Chapters 12 and 20 for further discussion of adoptive transfer.)
All of the tumors coming from wild-type animals grew
aggressively in their new hosts, whereas up to 40% of the
tumors taken from immunodeficient mice were rejected by
recipients. This suggested that tumors growing in immunedeficient environments are more immunogenic than those
arising in an immunocompetent environment. These observations led to the idea that the immune system exerts a
dynamic influence on cancer, inhibiting tumor cells but also
sculpting them in a Darwinian process of selection: those
that survive are better able to outwit the immune response
and have a survival advantage.
The three currently proposed phases to the immunoediting hypothesis are elimination, equilibrium, and escape
(Figure 19-7). The first phase, elimination, is the traditional
view of the immune system as a major player in the identification and destruction of newly formed cancer cells. Equilibrium is the proposed second phase, characterized by a
state of balance between destruction and survival of a small
number of neoplastic cells. Ample clinical evidence now
suggests that phase 2 can continue for up to decades after the
emergence of a tumor. However, identifying residual transformed cells and targeting them during this window is challenging. Escape is the final phase of cancer progression,
when the most aggressive and least immunogenic of the
residual tumor cells begin to thrive and spread. Most basic
research studies have focused on the role of the immune
system in the elimination phase, where both innate and
adaptive processes identify and target transformed cells for
destruction, sometimes setting the stage for what will occur
during the equilibrium and escape phases. The following
sections discuss our current understanding of the role of the

Cancer immunoediting

Recognition and targeting of tumor cells by the immune system is
believed to occur in three phases. Phase I, Elimination: cancer cells
are recognized by the immune system via their tumor antigens and
targeted for destruction. In the process, some cells acquire mutations that allow them to resist immune destruction. Phase II, Equilibrium: low levels of abnormal cells persist, but their proliferation
and spread are held in check by the adaptive immune response.
Phase III, Escape: further mutation in the surviving tumor cells leads

incidence of lymphomas and sarcomas. The importance of
NK cells in tumor immunity is highlighted by the mutant
mouse strain called beige and by Chediak-Higashi syndrome in humans. In both, a genetic defect causes marked
impairment of NK cells, and in each case an associated
increase is present in certain types of cancer.

to the capacity for immortal growth and metastasis. Over time,
inhibitory immune responses begin to dominate and immune
activity shifts from anti- to pro-tumor. Tan cells are normal; pink to

NK cell recognition mechanisms use a series of surface
receptors that respond to a balance of activating and inhibiting signals delivered by self cells (see Chapter 13). Since
many transforming viruses can induce the downregulation
of MHC expression, detecting “missing self ” is likely at least
one of the ways in which NK cells participate in tumor-cell

c19CancerandtheImmuneSystem.indd Page 641 12/20/12 9:49 PM user-t044

/Volumes/203/MHR00209/siL52070/disk1of1/0071052070

Cancer and the Immune System
identification and eradication. However, inducing signals in
the form of molecular expressions of danger can also engage
NK cell-activating receptors (e.g., NKG2D) delivering what
is now referred to as an “altered” or “induced-self ” signal
(see Figure 19-7). Various forms of cellular stress, including
viral infection, heat shock, UV radiation, and other agents
that induce DNA damage can trigger expression of the
ligands for these activating NK cell receptors. Using activating signals induced by DNA damage pathways, NK cells may
thus be able to distinguish cancerous or precancerous cells
from healthy neighboring cells. Once engaged, these cells
use cytolytic granules that include such compounds as perforin to target their killing machinery at cells expressing
these activating ligands. In fact, deficiency in perforin, a
cytolytic compound used by both NK cells and CTLs to kill
target cells, is linked to increased cancer susceptibility. Indirectly, NK cells may also participate in cancer eradication by
secreting IFN-␥, a potent anticancer cytokine that encourages DCs to stimulate strong CTL responses in vitro (see
adaptive responses below).
Numerous observations indicate that activated macrophages also play a significant role in the immune response to
tumors. For example, macrophages are often observed to
cluster around tumors, and the presence of proinflammatory
macrophages, such as type M1, is correlated with tumor
regression. Like NK cells, macrophages are not MHC
restricted and express Fc receptors, enabling them to bind to
antibody on tumor cells and to mediate antibody-dependent
cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC; discussed further below).
The anti-tumor activity of activated macrophages is likely
mediated by lytic enzymes, as well as reactive oxygen and
nitrogen intermediates. In addition, activated macrophages
secrete a cytokine called tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF␣) that has potent anti-tumor activity.
More recently, a previously unsuspected role for the
eosinophil in cancer immunity has also come to light. Mice
engineered to lack eotaxin or CCL11, two chemoattractants
for eosinophils, or IL-5, a stimulatory cytokine for this cell
type, were all found to be more susceptible to carcinogeninduced cancers than wild-type mice. In addition, IL-5
transgenic animals, which display higher levels of circulating eosinophils, are more resistant to chemically induced
sarcomas.
Adaptive Cell Types Involved in Cancer Eradication
In experimental animals, tumor antigens induce humoral
and cell-mediated immune responses that lead to the
destruction of transformed cells expressing these proteins.
Animals that lack either ␣␤ or ␥␦ T cells are more susceptible to a number of induced and spontaneous tumors. Several
tumors have been shown to induce CTLs that recognize
tumor antigens presented by class I MHC on these neoplastic cells. In fact, strong anti-tumor CTL activity correlates
significantly with tumor remission and is primarily credited
with maintaining the equilibrium stage of cancer detection,
or a state of immune-mediated neoplastic cell dormancy (see

|

CHAPTER 19

641

Figure 19-7). Evidence for this comes from studies of mice
treated with low-dose carcinogens. In the fraction of animals
that do not develop cancer, rendering the animals immunodeficient can result in the sudden onset of cancer. Importantly, blocking NK-cell responses at this stage does not
result in eruption of occult cancer, but blocking CD8⫹ T-cell
responses or IFN-␥ does, highlighting the importance of
adaptive immunity during this stage of cancer. The pressures
of adaptive immunity on cancerous cells during this relatively long stage are believed to sculpt tumors (thus the
immunoediting name), driving the selective survival of neoplastic cells that are less immunogenic and have accumulated mutations most favorable for immune evasion. One
example of this is increased expression of PD-L1 on tumor
cells, which binds to PD-1 on CTLs and inhibits engagement
(see Figure 19-7).
In clinical studies of cancer, the frequency of tumorinfiltrating lymphocytes (TILs)—a combination of T cells,
NKT cells, and NK cells—correlates with a prognosis of
cancer regression. For instance, in one seminal study of
ovarian cancer, 38% of women with high numbers of TILs
compared with 4.5% of women with low numbers of TILs
survived more than 5 years past diagnosis. However,
beyond numbers, the type of infiltrating cells may be even
more crucial and in some cases can have more prognostic
power than clinical cancer staging. In general, a high frequency of CD8⫹ T cells, and sometimes a high ratio of CTL
to TREG cells is associated with enhanced survival. However, the story with TREG cells is complicated; several studies have observed a positive impact of this cell type on
anticancer immune responses (discussed further in the following sections).
B cells respond to tumor-specific antigens by generating
anti-tumor antibodies that can foster tumor-cell recognition
and lysis. Using their Fc receptors, NK cells and macrophages again participate in this response, mediating ADCC
(see Chapter 13). However, some anti-tumor antibodies
serve a more detrimental role, blocking CTL access to
tumor-specific antigens and enhancing survival of the cancerous cells. For this reason, a clear positive or negative role
for B cells in cancer immunity is less obvious.
The Role of Cytokines in Cancer Immunity
Animal models in which cytokines or cytokine response
pathways are eliminated have helped us to identify the role
of specific cytokines in tumor-cell eradication. IFN-␥ and
the regulatory components of this pathway are clearly
important in cancer elimination, as mice lacking these are
more susceptible to a number of different tumors. This cytokine can exert direct anti-tumor effects on transformed
cells, including enhanced class I MHC expression, making
neoplastic cells better targets for CD8⫹ T cell recognition
and destruction (see Figure 19-7). Both type I (␣/␤) and
type II (␥) interferons have immune cell-enhancing activities that can render these cells more efficient at tumor-cell
removal.

The Immune System in Health and Disease

The cytokine IL-12 has recently received much attention
for its ability to enhance anti-tumor immunity. Administration of exogenous IL-12 protects mice from one type of
chemically induced tumor. Mice genetically deficient for
IL-12 also develop more papillomas (a type of epithelial cell
cancer) than do wild-type animals. This may be due in part
to IL-12 driving the development to T-cell pathways: this
cytokine encourages DCs to activate strong TH1 and CTL
responses.
The cytokine TNF-␣ was named for its anticancer activity.
When it was injected into tumor-bearing animals, it induced
hemorrhage and necrosis of the tumor. However, this cytokine was later shown to have both tumor-inhibiting and
tumor-promoting effects. Various carcinogen-treated TNF⫺/⫺mice have been found to display either more sarcomas or
fewer skin carcinomas than wild-type mice, depending upon
the mouse strain and the means of cancer induction, suggesting that TNF-␣ has a complex role in tumor immunity.

Some Inflammatory Responses Can
Promote Cancer
As we know, the immune response involves a balance of
activating and inhibiting pathways—both some gas and
some brakes. Without the brakes, uncontrolled immune
activity can lead to pathologic inflammation and even autoimmunity. In the immune response to cancer, inflammatory
responses can serve a positive role, as we have seen above,
but they also have the potential to promote cancer and create pro-tumor microenvironments, such as occurs during
the escape phase of cancer immunoediting (see Figure 19-7,
bottom right). In this section we discuss some specific
immune response components that either support tumor
growth or that direct immunity toward pathways of natural
immunosuppression.
Chronic Inflammation
Chronic inflammation is believed to create a pro-tumor
microenvironment via several mechanisms. First, inflammatory responses increase cellular stress signals and can lead to
genotoxic stress, increasing mutation rates in cells and thus
fostering tumorigenesis. Second, the growth factors and
cytokines secreted by leukocytes often induce cellular proliferation, and during mutation events, nonimmune tumor
cells can acquire the ability to respond to these growth
stimulators. In this way, some immune cells and the factors
they produce can help sustain and advance cancer growth.
Finally, inflammation is pro-angiogenic, increasing blood
vessel growth and allowing for greater tumor-cell invasion
into surrounding tissues or transport via lymphatic vessels,
one of the hallmarks of cancer.
Enhancing Anti-Tumor Antibodies
Antibodies can be produced against tumor-specific antigens, and these may be important flags for tumor-cell

eradication. Based on this discovery, attempts were made to
protect animals against tumor growth by active immunization with tumor antigens or by passive immunization with
anti-tumor antibodies. Much to the surprise of the researchers involved, these immunizations did not usually protect
against the tumor; in some cases, they actually enhanced
tumor growth.
The tumor-enhancing ability of immune sera subsequently was studied via cell-mediated lympholysis (CML)
reactions, which measure in vitro lysis of target cells by
CTLs. Serum taken from animals with progressive tumor
growth blocked the CML reaction, whereas serum taken
from animals with regressing tumors had little or no
blocking activity. In 1969, the Hellstroms (Ingegerd and
Karl) extended these findings by showing that children
with progressive neuroblastoma had high levels of some
kind of blocking factor in their serum, whereas children
with regressive neuroblastoma did not have these serum
factors. Since these first reports, serum blocking factors
have been found to be associated with a number of human
tumors.
In some cases, anti-tumor antibody itself acts as a serum
blocking factor. Presumably the antibody binds to tumorspecific antigens and masks the antigens from cytotoxic T
cells. However, in many cases the blocking factors are not
antibodies alone, but rather antibodies complexed with
free tumor antigens. Although these immune complexes
have been shown to block CTL responses, the mechanism
of this inhibition is not clear. These complexes also may
inhibit ADCC by binding to Fc receptors on NK cells or
macrophages and blocking their activity. Therefore,
although some clinical studies today utilize antibodies to
treat cancer (see Clinical Focus Box 13-1), most of these
are not directed against tumor-specific antigens.
Active Immunosuppression in Tumor
Microenvironments
Soluble factors secreted by tumor cells or the immune
cells that infiltrate a tumor can encourage the development of a local immunosuppressive microenvironment.
For instance, increased expression of TGF-␤ and indoleamine-2,3-dioxygenase (IDO), which inhibit TH1 responses,
has been found in various human cancers (see Figure 19-7,
bottom right). Another immunosuppressive cytokine,
IL-10, may play a duplicitous role in cancer immunity.
IL-10 has tumor-promoting, tolerance-inducing properties
in some situations but can also encourage anticancer
innate immune responses in others. Likewise, TGF-␤
expressed during the latter stages of cancer encourages
progression, possibly by blocking local DC activation and
inhibiting T-cell function, although the presence of this
cytokine during early tumor growth can be tumor inhibiting. These microenvironment effects appear to be quite
localized to the primary tumor site. Studies in mice with a
primary tumor have shown that additional cancer cells of
the same type introduced to a new site can be rejected by

c19CancerandtheImmuneSystem.indd Page 643 12/20/12 9:49 PM user-t044

/Volumes/203/MHR00209/siL52070/disk1of1/0071052070

Cancer and the Immune System
the immune system, even while the primary tumor
remains intact.
In both animal models and human cancer studies, much
recent attention has focused on the role of various naturally
immunosuppressive cell types in tumor responses. The
general consensus from most animal studies is that an
abundance of TREG cells, myeloid-derived suppressor cells
(MDSCs), M2 macrophages, and TH2 cells confers a local
state of immunosuppression or TH2-directed immunity,
and allows for tumor-cell evasion (see Figure 19-7, bottom
right). The jury is still out, however, on how well this translates to humans, where the role of TREG cells in clinical
cancer immunity is increasingly controversial. In initial
clinical studies, the presence of CD4⫹CD25⫹FoxP3⫹ TREG
cells in pancreatic and ovarian cancer, or an elevated ratio
of these cells to CTLs, was predictive of poor prognosis.
However, similar investigations in colorectal cancer as well
as head and neck cancers showed the opposite result: the
presence of TREG cells correlated with survival. These conflicting findings, combined with a lack of specific markers
to target these cells, has stalled attempts to direct new cancer therapies toward the control of regulatory T-cell subsets
that might favor tumor cell destruction.

Some Tumor Cells Evade Immune
Recognition and Activation
Although the immune system clearly can respond to tumor
cells, many of which express tumor antigens, the fact that so
many individuals die each year from cancer suggests that the
immune response to tumors is often ineffective. Immunoediting, or selective pressure applied by the anti-tumor immune
response, often selects for escape mutants that can evade the
immune response. Some of these escape strategies involve
loss or gain of proteins by the tumor cells that helps them
evade immune cell recognition and activation.
Reduced MHC Expression in Tumor Cells
Defects in antigen processing and presentation are common
among the escape mutants arising in many tumors. These
could include mutations that lead to reduced MHC expression, secretion of TSAs (rather than surface expression),
defective transporter associated with antigen processing
(TAP) or ␤2-microglobulin, and IFN-␥ insensitivity. Each of
these types of mutations results in decreased class I MHC
presentation of tumor antigens and profound inhibition of
CD8⫹ T-cell recognition (Figure 19-8). NK cells should

MHC expression on tumor cells may allow

response itself may play a role in selection for
tumor cells that express lower levels of class I
MHC molecules, by preferentially eliminating
those cells expressing high levels of class I
molecules first. Malignant tumor cells that express fewer MHC molecules may thus escape
CTL-mediated destruction.

The Immune System in Health and Disease

recognize these cells lacking class I MHC. However,
decreased expression of ligands that bind activating receptors on NK cells, also common among tumors, allows these
cells to avoid NK cell-mediated killing.
Tumor Cell Subversion of Apoptosis Signals
The up-regulation of anti-apoptotic mediators and the
expression of mutated or absent death receptors can lead to
tumors that are resistant to programmed cell death signals.
As mentioned earlier, faulty DNA repair mechanisms in
transformed cells combined with immune-mediated pressures (e.g., selective destruction of cells expressing class I
MHC) encourage the accumulation of tumor cells with these
types of survival-enhancing mutations. In fact, the absence
of MHC molecules on tumor cells is generally an indication
of cancer progression and carries a poor prognosis.
Poor Costimulatory Signals Provided by Tumor Cells
As we know from Chapter 11, complete T-cell activation
requires two signals: an activating signal, triggered by recognition of a peptide-MHC molecule complex by the T-cell
receptor, and a costimulatory signal, triggered by the interaction of CD80/86 (B7) on antigen-presenting cells (APCs)
with costimulatory molecules such as CD28 on T cells. Both
signals are needed to induce IL-2 production and proliferation of T cells. By virtue of their status as self cells, tumors
have fairly poor immunogenicity and tend to lack costimulatory molecules. Without sufficient numbers of APCs in the
immediate vicinity of a tumor and with few stimulators to
drive the activation of these cells, responding T cells may
receive only a partial activating signal. This can lead to clonal
anergy and immune tolerance. In fact, recently approved
therapies for treating cancer specifically aim to enhance the
costimulation provided to anti-tumor T cells.

Cancer Immunotherapy
Harnessing the immune system to fight cancer is not a new
idea. In 1891, a bone carcinoma surgeon named William B.
Coley first experimented with this approach, injecting bacteria directly into the inoperable tumor of one of his patients.
This was an era prior to the development of chemotherapy or
radiation treatment for cancer, and clinicians then had few
choices. Based on success in this initial experimental treatment, Coley and other physicians continued this form of
immunotherapy for many years, using bacteria or bacterial
products that became known as “Coley’s Toxins” to treat
aggressive cancers. Published reports of remission and even
elimination of tumors using this technique, however, met
with much skepticism. This treatment was later replaced
with chemo- and radiotherapy. Nonetheless, today we
believe that Coley’s observations were largely sound. His
results were likely due to a boost to the patient’s anticancer
immune response as a result of a concurrent infection or
presence of immunostimulatory bacterial products.

Present-day cancer treatment can take many forms. Beyond
surgery and radiation treatment, which are most often employed
in cases of larger, more discrete tumors, drug therapies can be
used to target residual tumor cells and to attack dispersed cancers. Drug therapy for cancer falls loosely into four categories:
• Chemotherapies, aimed at blocking DNA synthesis and
cell division
• Hormonal therapies, which interfere with tumor-cell
growth
• Targeted therapies, such as small molecule inhibitors of
cancer
• Immunotherapies, which induce or enhance the antitumor immune response
We will focus our attention here on immune-based therapies. These are designed to help eliminate a tumor by reviving, initiating, or supplementing the in vivo anti-tumor
immune response or by neutralizing inhibitory pathways.
Challenges in determining the efficacy of specific immunotherapies in clinical settings include the range of cancer cell
types, tumor sizes, locations, and stages of disease, as well as
questions of optimal dosing and schedule of treatment. The
following sections describe several immunotherapeutic
agents that have been licensed for use in humans, as well as
some novel approaches that may yield clinically useful products to fight cancer in the future.

Monoclonal Antibodies Can Be Targeted
to Tumor Cells
Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) (see Clincal Focus Box 13-1
and Chapter 20) have long been used as experimental immunotherapeutic agents for treating cancer. At present, approximately 12 different mAbs are licensed for the treatment of
cancer. Table 19-4 lists many of these, as well as the cancers
for which they are approved. These mAbs may be used
unmodified or can be conjugated with an agent to increase
their efficacy. For instance, toxins, chemical agents, and
radioactive particles can be attached to a mAb, which then
delivers the conjugated substance to the target cell.
In one early success of mAb treatment, R. Levy and his
colleagues successfully treated a 64-year-old man with terminal B-cell lymphoma that had metastasized to the liver,
spleen, bone marrow, and peripheral blood. Because this was
a B-cell cancer, the membrane-bound antibody on all the
cancerous cells had the same idiotype (antigenic specificity).
By the procedure outlined in Figure 19-9, these researchers
produced mouse mAb specific for the B-lymphoma idiotype.
When this mouse monoclonal anti-idiotype antibody was
injected into the patient, it bound specifically to only the
B-lymphoma cells that expressed that particular idiotype
immunoglobulin. Since B-lymphoma cells are susceptible to
complement-mediated lysis, the mAb activated the complement system and lysed the lymphoma cells without harming

other cells. After four injections with this anti-idiotype mAb,
the tumors began to shrink and the patient entered an
unusually long period of remission.
A custom approach targeting idiotypes like this is very
costly and requires a specific reagent for each lymphoma
patient. A more general mAb therapy for B-cell lymphoma is
based on the fact that most B cells, whether normal or cancerous, bear lineage-distinctive antigens. For example, mAbs
that target the B-cell marker CD20, such as Rituximab, are
widely used to treat non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma.
Some of the mAbs in clinical use can be coupled with
radioactive isotopes, chemotherapy drugs, or potent toxins
of biological origin. In such “guided missile” therapies, the
toxic agents are delivered specifically to tumor cells. This
ideally focuses the toxic effects on the tumor and spares normal tissues. Reagents known as immunotoxins have been

constructed by coupling the inhibitor chain of a toxin (e.g.,
diphtheria toxin) to an antibody against a tumor-specific or
tumor-associated antigen. In vitro studies have demonstrated that these “magic bullets” can kill tumor cells without
harming normal cells, although none have yet been licensed
for clinical use. Ibritumomab tiuxetan and 131I-tositumomab
are both examples of licensed radioisotope-conjugated mAbs
for treating cancer. Each delivers a dose of radiation to cells
bearing the CD20 cell-surface receptor, for which the mAb is
specific, and can be used for the treatment of non-Hodgkin’s
lymphoma.
A variety of tumors express significantly increased levels
of growth factors or their receptors, which are promising
targets for anti-tumor mAbs. For example, in 25% to 30% of
women with metastatic breast cancer, a genetic alteration of
the tumor cells results in the increased expression of human

Because all the B-lymphoma cells in a patient are derived from
a single transformed B cell, they all express the same membranebound antibody (Ab-1) with the same idiotype (i.e., the same antigenic
specificity). In the procedure illustrated, a monoclonal anti-idiotypic

antibody (Ab-2) against the B-lymphoma membrane-bound
antibody is produced ex vivo (steps 1–4). This anti-idiotype

the neu gene and expressed in only trace amounts in normal
adults. Because of this difference in protein levels, a humanized mAb against HER2 has been successfully used to treat

been approved for clinical use and are included in Table 19-4.

or by treatment of cells ex vivo, have produced occasional
encouraging results.
After some initially promising and long-lasting results in
early trials, IL-2 was licensed for use in cancer therapy.
Despite significant in vivo toxicity and the small fraction of
patients impacted, many follow-up clinical trials incorporated IL-2 alone or in combination with other immunotherapies. Alas, many years of refinements with IL-2 regimens
and combination drug testing have not shown this T-cell
growth factor to be as effective as once hoped, and the
mechanisms of action in those cases of durable response are
still largely unknown. Today, IL-2 alone or in combination
with IFN-␣ is still used for advanced kidney cancer and
metastatic melanoma. One factor that may further complicate our understanding of the role of IL-2 in cancer is the
impact of this cytokine on TREG cells, a population that has
been associated with both tumor-enhancing and tumorinhibiting behaviors.
The major obstacles to in vivo cytokine therapy are the
complexity of the cytokine network itself and systemic toxicity. This complexity makes it difficult to determine how a

Cytokines Can Be Used to Augment the
Immune Response to Tumors
The isolation and cloning of the various cytokine genes has
facilitated the large-scale production of cytokines for use in
clinical settings. Several of these have been used either singly
or in combination to augment the immune response against
cancer in clinical trials. Among these are all three interferons
(IFN-␣, -␤, and -␥), the tumor necrosis factors (TNF-␣ and
Lymphotoxin-␣ [TNF-␤]), granulocyte-macrophage colony
stimulating factor (GM-CSF) and several interleukins (IL-2,
-4, -6, and -12). Trials with some of these, either used in vivo

Cancer and the Immune System
given recombinant cytokine will affect the production of
other cytokines in the patient. Cytokines are also difficult
to administer locally, and systemic administration of high
levels of a given cytokine can lead to serious or even lifethreatening consequences. Much of the systemic toxicity
can be avoided when cytokines, such as GM-CSF or IL-2,
are used only ex vivo to expand cultured leukocyte populations as a part of cell-based immunotherapy regimens (see
below).

Tumor-Specific T Cells Can Be Expanded and
Reintroduced into Patients
Early observations of lymphocyte infiltration into solid
tumors suggested that these cells might be a source of
tumor-specific immunity. Subsequent research has shown
that in many cases, tumor-reactive T cells can be isolated
from the peripheral blood, lymph nodes, and solid tumors of
cancer patients. Despite the presence of these cells, tumors
persist in these individuals, suggesting that these cells are
not performing anti-tumor effector functions in vivo. A
range of adoptive T-cell therapies aim to collect these cells
from cancer patients, expand and activate them ex vivo, and
re-infuse them into patients. These cells can come from solid
tumors themselves (tumor infiltrating lymphocytes, or
TILs), tumor-draining nodes, or peripheral blood. In one
recent multi-center study, the TILs from patients with metastatic melanoma were collected and expanded with IL-2 in
vitro to overcome their anergic state. Following lymphodepleting treatments designed to create a niche for these
cells, patients were re-infused with large numbers of these
activated, autologous TILs. Tumor regression responses
reached up to 50%, with approximately 10% of the patients
experiencing long-lived or complete remission.

New Therapeutic Vaccines May Enhance the
Anti-Tumor Immune Response
Most vaccines, also called prophylactic vaccines, are
designed to initiate an immune response before the onset of
infection or disease. Therapeutic vaccines, on the other
hand, aim to enhance or redirect an existing immune
response. Immunogens that make successful prophylactic
vaccines do not always work once infection has been established. For example, the HPV vaccine, which is up to 99%
effective at preventing infection by the strains that most
commonly cause cervical cancer, is not effective once a
women is already infected with one of these strains. Therefore, vaccines for use in patients with existing infections or
malignant cells must be designed to redirect an already
engaged immune response.
Several cancer vaccine studies in mice have aimed at
expanding or enhancing tumor-specific antigen presentation. Mouse DCs cultured in GM-CSF and incubated with
tumor fragments, then re-infused into the mice, have been
shown to activate both TH cells and CTLs specific for the

|

CHAPTER 19

647

tumor antigens. When the mice were subsequently challenged with live tumor cells, they displayed tumor immunity.
These experiments have led to a number of approaches to
expand the population of APCs, so that these cells can activate TH cells or CTLs specific for tumor antigens.
Employing a similar strategy, sipuleucel-T (Provenge)
became the first approved therapeutic cancer vaccine. This
vaccine is designed to fight metastatic prostate cancer by
inducing an immune response to a common self prostate
tumor antigen, prostatic acid phosphatase (PAP). This is an
individual cell-based therapy, where DCs are first isolated
from prostate cancer patients and then stimulated in vitro
using a fusion protein consisting of PAP and GM-CSF (Figure 19-10). These antigen-stimulated and expanded autologous APCs are then re-infused into the patient, yielding
survival increases of just over 4 months in men first treated
with the drug. Exact mechanisms of action are still under
study, although sipuleucel-T is believed to work by stimulating PAP-specific CTLs to kill prostate tumor cells. With as
yet modest survival benefits and a cost of $93,000 for the
recommended three infusions, the long-term potential for
this new individual prostate cancer immunotherapy is still
unclear.
Another approach that also utilizes the APC-activating
cytokine GM-CSF is to transfect tumor cells with the gene
for this chemical signal, creating a local source near the
tumor cells. These engineered tumor cells, when reinfused
into the patient, will secrete GM-CSF, enhancing the differentiation and activation of host APCs, especially DCs. As
these DCs accumulate around the tumor cells, the GM-CSF
secreted by the tumor cells will enhance the presentation of
tumor antigens to TH cells and CTLs by local DCs (see Figure 19-11).

Manipulation of Costimulatory Signals Can
Improve Cancer Immunity
As discussed earlier, tumors cells frequently lack the costimulatory signals required for full T-cell activation. Several
research groups have demonstrated that tumor immunity
can be enhanced when these costimulatory signals are
modified. For instance, when mouse CTL precursors (CTLPs) are incubated with melanoma cells in vitro, antigen recognition occurs. In the absence of a costimulatory signal,
these CTL-Ps do not proliferate or differentiate into effector
CTLs. However, when these melanoma cells are transfected
with the gene that encodes CD80 (B7.1), the CTL-Ps differentiate into effector CTLs.
These findings offer the possibility that CD80/86-transfected tumor cells might be used to induce CTL responses in
vivo. For instance, when P. Linsley, L. Chen, and colleagues
injected melanoma-bearing mice with CD80/86⫹ melanoma
cells, the melanomas completely regressed in more than 40%
of the mice. S. Townsend and J. Allison used a similar
approach to vaccinate mice against malignant melanoma.
Normal mice were first immunized with irradiated, CD80

which they are reinfused into the patient in order to stimulate a T-cell

transfected melanoma cells and then challenged with unaltered malignant melanoma cells (Figure 19-12). The “vaccine” was found to protect a high percentage of the mice. It is
hoped that a similar vaccine might prevent metastasis after
surgical removal of a primary melanoma in human patients.
As we saw in Chapter 11, costimulatory molecules can also
be involved in dampening the immune response. For example,
engagement of CTLA-4 on T cells with the CD80/86 molecule

tumor rejection. Recently, two different mAbs capable of
CTLA-4 blockade in humans have been developed. In clinical

remission. Unfortunately, a significant number of patients
experienced autoimmune side effects, highlighting the powerful role of CTLA-4 in the maintenance of self tolerance. Nonetheless, this angle is currently being pursued for other
immune checkpoint regulatory molecules, such as PD-L1,
where expression of this immuno-inhibiting molecule on
cancer cells has been correlated with a poor clinical prognosis.

ies are underway to evaluate potential synergistic effects of
combining chemo- or radiotherapy with immunotherapies for
cancer. As with all new combination therapies, testing and
outcome evaluation of the optimal timing, dose, and types of
drugs is a complicated matrix. However, if the promise in initial studies showing synergistic effects holds true, the effective
mixing of tumor-directed cytotoxicity with anti-tumor
immune enhancement could help deliver the elusive one-two
punch that cancer immunologists have been seeking.

Tumor cells differ from normal cells by changes in the
regulation of growth, allowing them to proliferate indefinitely and eventually metastasize to other tissues.
Normal cells can be transformed in vitro by chemical and
physical carcinogens and by transforming viruses, all of
which lead to DNA alterations.
Transformed cells exhibit altered growth properties and
are sometimes capable of inducing cancer when they are
injected into animals.
Proto-oncogenes encode proteins involved in normal cellular growth. The conversion of proto-oncogenes to oncogenes is a key step in the induction of most human cancer.
This conversion may result from mutation in an oncogene,
its translocation, or its amplification.
Tumor-suppressor genes are normal cellular genes that
dampen cell growth and proliferation. Disregulation of

genes involved in pro- and anti-apoptotic pathways can
also participate in cancer induction.
■

A number of B- and T-cell leukemias and lymphomas are
associated with translocated proto-oncogenes. In its new
site, the translocated gene may come under the influence
of enhancers or promoters that cause its transcription at
higher levels than usual.

■

Tumor cells can display tumor-specific antigens, which are
novel proteins, and the more common tumor-associated
antigens, which are modified normal proteins or proteins
with changed patterns of expression.

■

The tumor antigens recognized by T cells fall into one of four
major categories: antigens encoded by genes with tumorspecific expression, antigens encoded by variant forms of
normal genes that have been altered by mutation, antigens
normally expressed only at certain stages of differentiation

or differentiation lineages, and antigens that are overexpressed in particular tumors.
Immunoediting describes the postulated process by which
the developing anti-tumor immune response both identifies and kills tumor cells, as well as participates in selection
of cells that have developed immunoevasive mutations.
The immune response to tumors includes CTL-mediated
lysis, NK-cell activity, macrophage-mediated tumor destruction, and destruction mediated by ADCC. Several cytokines,
including IFN and TNF, help to mediate tumor-cell killing.
Limited and directed inflammatory responses near tumors
can be beneficial. However, prolonged or overly active
inflammatory responses can also foster a microenvironment that promotes tumors.

■

Tumors use several strategies to evade these immune
responses, including accumulation of new mutations,
poor costimulatory signaling, and active inhibition of
local anti-tumor responses.

■

Current cancer immunotherapy employs a variety of
approaches. These include the use of mAbs, enhancement
of costimulatory signaling to T cells, adoptive T cell transfer, cytokine augmentation, and therapeutic vaccines
aimed at increasing the ability of APCs to activate adaptive
cell-mediated tumor eradication.
Combinations of cytotoxic chemotherapies with selected
immunotherapies are yielding promising results against
cancer.

Q U E S T I O N S

CLINICAL FOCUS QUESTION Why is cervical cancer a likely

target for a vaccine that can prevent cancer? Can the approach
being investigated for cervical cancer be applied to all types
of cancer?
1. Indicate whether each of the following statements is true or

false. If you think a statement is false, explain why.
a. Hereditary retinoblastoma results from overexpression

of a cellular oncogene.
b. Translocation of the c-myc gene is found in many

patients with Burkitt’s lymphoma.
c. Multiple copies of cellular oncogenes are sometimes

observed in cancer cells.
d. Viral integration into the cellular genome may convert
a proto-oncogene into a transforming oncogene.
e. All oncogenic retroviruses carry viral oncogenes.
f. The immune response against a virus-induced tumor
protects against another tumor induced by the same
virus.
2. You are a clinical immunologist studying acute lympho-

blastic leukemia (ALL). Leukemic cells from most patients
with ALL have the morphology of lymphocytes but do not
express cell-surface markers characteristic of mature B or T
cells. You have isolated cells from ALL patients that do not
express membrane Ig but do react with mAb against a normal pre-B-cell marker (B-200). You therefore suspect that
these leukemic cells are pre-B cells. How would you use
genetic analysis to confirm that the leukemic cells are committed to the B-cell lineage?
3. In a recent experiment, melanoma cells were isolated from

patients with early or advanced stages of malignant melanoma. At the same time, T cells specific for tetanus toxoid
antigen were isolated and cloned from each patient.
a. When early-stage melanoma cells were cultured

together with tetanus-toxoid antigen and the tetanustoxoid-specific T-cell clones, the T-cell clones were
observed to proliferate. This proliferation was blocked
by addition of chloroquine, a drug that accumulates in
lysosomes, or by addition of mAb to HLA-DR. Proliferation was not blocked by addition of mAb to HLA-A,
-B, -DQ, or -DP. What might these findings indicate
about the early-stage melanoma cells in this experimental system?
b. When the same experiment was repeated with
advanced-stage melanoma cells, the tetanus-toxoid
T-cell clones failed to proliferate in response to the

tetanus-toxoid antigen. What might this indicate about
advanced-stage melanoma cells?
c. When early and advanced malignant melanoma cells
were fixed with paraformaldehyde and incubated with
processed tetanus toxoid, only the early-stage melanoma cells could induce proliferation of the tetanustoxoid T-cell clones. What might this indicate about
early-stage melanoma cells?
d. How might you confirm the hypotheses in a, b, and c
experimentally?
4. Describe three likely sources of tumor antigens.
5. Various cytokines have been evaluated for use in tumor

immunotherapy. Describe four mechanisms by which
cytokines mediate anti-tumor effects and the cytokines
that induce each type of effect.
6. Infusion of transfected melanoma cells into cancer patients

is a promising immunotherapy.
a. Name two genes that have been transfected into mela-

noma cells for this purpose. What is the rationale
behind the use of each of these genes?
b. Why might use of such transfected melanoma cells also
be effective in treating other types of cancers?
7. For each of the following descriptions, choose the most

appropriate term:
Descriptions
a. A benign or malignant tumor
b. A tumor that has arisen from
endodermal tissue
c. A tumor that has arisen from
mesodermal connective tissue

Experimental Systems
and Methods

T

he days when an experimental methods
chapter in an immunology textbook could
neatly describe all the techniques used by
practitioners of the subject are long gone.
Immunologists use tools derived from the arsenals of
structural biologists, biochemists, cell biologists,
anatomists, microbiologists, and physiologists. In
return, the science of immunology has donated an
extensive toolbox of antibody-based and fluorescencebased techniques to the biological sciences.
In this chapter, we have attempted to provide students
with the ability to understand the methodological choices
made by professional immunologists. We hope that
students will learn from it some of the advantages and
limitations of many of the techniques they will encounter
as they read in the immunological literature. Second, we
have tried to provide students with the tools to understand
the context in which particular methods or techniques are
applicable, as they design their own original experiments.
Fearlessness in following the interesting questions
wherever they lead is one of the attributes of great
scientists, and in this chapter we offer students a little
insight into the broad array of technical possibilities
available to them as they pursue their own questions. We
have included some classical techniques, in order to
support those reading in the earlier literature of the field,
but we have also attempted to add some of the methods
developed more recently. This chapter is designed to
provide insight into the technical aspects of specific
experiments described in previous chapters that advanced
the field.
Space does not permit a detailed description of every
technique, and this chapter is designed to provide an
overall sense of the applicability of different
immunological methods, rather than specific protocols
for pursuing them. Students who wish to delve further
into the details of any particular method can then locate
specific protocols in a variety of sources, some of which
are noted in the “Useful Web Sites” section at the end of
the chapter. For purposes of concision, we have elected
not to describe methods derived from molecular biology
or biochemistry, as we believe that most students of

immunology will already have been exposed to them, and
that they are better handled in the relevant texts.
We begin by enumerating those methodologies that
are used to generate antibodies, and then describe some
of the many ways in which the interactions between
antibodies and antigens can be analyzed. We then briefly
describe some of the methods used to visualize cellular
and subcellular structures in the immune system, before
moving on to a discussion of various magnetic and
fluorescence-based techniques used for cell sorting and
cellular analysis at the population level. Assays that
analyze the cell cycle and measure cell death are then
addressed, and we complete the chapter with a brief
description of a number of commonly used whole animal
experimental systems.

Antibody Generation
From the early days of immunology, investigators and clinicians have made use of the ability of animals to respond to
immunization with the production of antibodies directed
toward injected antigens, such as viruses, bacteria, fungi, or
simple chemicals from the laboratory shelf. Antibodies harvested from the serum of immunized animals are the
secreted products of many clones of B cells and are thus
referred to as polyclonal antibodies. With subsequent immunizations using the same antigen, the average affinity of this
polyclonal antibody mixture for the antigen increases, as a
result of the process of affinity maturation, described in
Chapter 12.

Polyclonal Antibodies Are Secreted by Multiple
Clones of Antigen-Specific B Cells
Polyclonal antibodies are generated by immunizing an experimental animal or a human subject with antigen one or more
times, bleeding the subject, and purifying the antibodies
from the subject’s serum. Serum is what remains when both
the cellular components and the clotting factors have been
removed from the subject’s blood. The addition of adjuvants
to the immunizing preparation elicits a stronger immune
response by deliberately engaging the innate immune system
to help in the activation of antigen-specific B and T cells.
Some current approaches to antibody generation employ Toll
receptor agonists such as poly I:C, an artificial nucleic acid
preparation, as an adjuvant and indeed, this approach is
being actively pursued in research into cancer immunotherapy. Traditionally, Freund’s Complete Adjuvant, or alum was
used to maximize mouse antibody responses to antigens that
were mixed with the adjuvants prior to injection.
Because polyclonal antibodies are a mixture of antibodies
directed toward a variety of different epitopes of the immunizing antigen, they are particularly useful for techniques
such as agglutination or immunoprecipitation, which rely on

the ability of the antibody to form a large antigen-antibody
complex. The disadvantage of using a polyclonal preparation
is that some of the antibodies in the mixture may have illdefined cross-reactivities with related antigens. Furthermore, since the antibody response matures with time post
immunization (Chapter 12), the range of cross-reactivities of
different preparations of polyclonal antibodies may vary
among different bleeds, even when they are derived from the
same donor animal.

A Monoclonal Antibody Is the Product of a
Single Stimulated B Cell
The disadvantages of unforeseen cross-reactivities or variations in the fine specificity of polyclonal antibodies are
eliminated when using monoclonal antibodies (mAbs),
which are the product of a single, stimulated B cell. In 1975,
Georges Köhler and Cesar Milstein figured out how to generate large quantities of antibodies derived from a single
B-cell clone (Figure 20-1). By fusing a normal, activated,
antibody-producing B cell with a myeloma cell (a cancerous
plasma cell), they were able to generate a hybridoma that
possessed the immortal growth properties of the myelomacell parent and secreted the unique antibody produced by
the B-cell parent. Over time, myeloma-cell partners were
generated that had lost the ability to synthesize their own
immunoglobulin, thus ensuring that the only antibodies
secreted into the culture medium were those from the B-cell
fusion partner.
The original fusions used Sendai virus to disrupt the
plasma membrane of the cells; nowadays, chemical fusogens
such as polyethylene glycol are used instead. In general,
fusions between three or more cells are unstable, and the vast
majority of fused cells growing out of these cultures are the
products of the hybridization of two parent cells.
Hybrids formed by the fusion of two antibody-producing
B cells will not grow out of these cultures because B cells
have a relatively short half-life in vitro. However, hybrids
formed by the fusion of two or more cancer cells would
have the potential to grow out from the initial fusions, and
compete successfully for nutrients with the B cell-myeloma
hybrids. A method therefore had to be devised to eliminate
these tumor-tumor hybrids from the cultures of fused cells.
Köhler and Milstein solved this problem by using myeloma
cells lacking the enzyme hypoxanthine guanine phosphoribosyl transferase (HGPRT). HGPRT is necessary for one
of the two potential pathways of DNA synthesis, the salvage
pathway. The alternative pathway of DNA synthesis, the de
novo pathway, can be inhibited by the antibiotic aminopterin. Köhler and Milstein reasoned that, if they grew the
hybrid cultures in the presence of aminopterin, the mutant
tumor cells and tumor-tumor hybrids would be unable to
synthesize new DNA by either the salvage or the de novo
pathways and would eventually die. However, in the
hybridomas formed by fusion between B cells and tumor
cells, the B-cell parent would provide the HGPRT, and so

these hybrids would survive in the selection medium.
Because the medium containing aminopterin is normally
supplemented with hypoxanthine and thymidine to support nucleotide synthesis, the selective medium is known
as “HAT medium.”
The resulting clones of hybridoma cells randomly lose
chromosomes over the first few days following fusion, but
eventually they stabilize and can be cultured indefinitely,
secreting large quantities of mAbs of predefined specificity
and known cross-reactivity. The importance of hybridomas
to the biological sciences was recognized when Köhler and
Milstein were awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology or
Medicine in 1984.
The precise specificity, affinity, and cross-reactivity of
mAbs are entirely stable with time, and they are particularly
useful for diagnostic purposes. However, mAbs are less useful than polyclonal preparations in applications that require
agglutination, since every antibody in the experiment has
the identical binding site and, thus, fewer antibodies will be
bound per antigen molecule.

Monoclonal Antibodies Can Be Modified for
Use in the Laboratory or the Clinic
Monoclonal antibodies provide a reproducible binding site
that will attach the antibody to its target cell or molecule,
and so it is not surprising that the range of applications for
mAbs has been limited only by the imagination of the investigators.
An mAb can be genetically modified so that only the
binding site is retained, and the rest of the molecule is
replaced by some other molecule. For example, because
injection of large amounts of xenogeneic antibodies can
induce inflammation, hybridomas secreting mAbs to be
used in immunotherapy in the clinic are often subject to
genetic manipulations, such that the binding sites of the
original mouse mAb are cut and pasted onto the Fc regions
of human antibodies. In addition, some antibodies are
modified by conjugation to toxins designed to kill cells to
which the antibody will bind. Many such chimeric and
toxin-conjugated antibodies are now in regular clinical use.

Experimental Methods

A plethora of antibodies is available in conjugated (covalently attached) forms, in which other molecules are joined
to regions of the antibody in ways that do not interfere with
its antigen-binding capacity, but enable the use of the antigenbinding capacity of the antibody in different types of applications. For example, some antibodies are modified by the
attachment of either biotin or enzymes, and used in ELISA
assays (see below). Others are modified by conjugation with
fluorescent dyes (or again, biotin) for use in immunofluorescent applications such as microscopy or flow cytometry. Yet
others are attached by their constant regions to various types
of synthetic beads or particles that enable their use in immunoprecipitation, magnetic cell separation, or electron microscopic experiments. Each of these different applications is
discussed below.
One novel use of mAbs has been the generation of antibodies that specifically bind and stabilize the transition state
of a chemical reaction, thus directly mimicking the activity
of enzymes. Such antibodies with enzyme-like activities are
referred to as abzymes.
Once the hybridoma technique had been established for B
lymphocytes, immunologists recognized its potential usefulness to T-cell biology, and many long-term T-cell hybridomas
with defined specificity have since been generated. In Chapter
3, we learned how one such hybridoma was used to characterize the biochemistry of the ␣␤TCR. Other T-cell hybridoma
lines have been invaluable in characterizing the conditions
under which different cytokines are secreted and the nature of
T-cell subpopulations. However, T-cell hybrids have not been
as useful as their B-cell counterparts in terms of providing
therapeutic, diagnostic, and general laboratory reagents,
because they do not secrete a soluble receptor molecule and
their binding specificity requires an MHC-based peptide.

Immunoprecipitation- Based
Techniques
The multivalency of antibodies has allowed the development
of techniques in which antibody-bound molecules can be
precipitated from solution, or otherwise separated from
nonbound molecules for further analysis. Some of these
techniques are quite venerable; other applications are brand
new. Still, all rely on the ability of antibodies to bind to more
than one antigenic determinant on a single antigen, thus
forming a large complex that will fall out of solution.

Immunoprecipitation Can Be
Performed in Solution
When antibodies and soluble antigen are mixed in solution,
the bi- or multivalent nature of immunoglobulins allows for
a single antibody molecule to bind to more than one antigen
(Figure 20-2). If the antigen is polyvalent (has more than one
antibody binding site per antigen molecule), it may in its
turn bind multiple different antibodies. Eventually, the

FIGURE 20-2 Immunoprecipitation in solution. When bior multivalent antibodies are mixed in solution with antigen, the
antibodies can form cross-linkages with two or more antigen molecules, leading to the formation of a cross-linked precipitate (middle
panel of graph). Precipitate formation requires that neither antigen
(left panel in graph) nor antibody (right panel in graph) molecules are
in excess. In either of these two cases, primarily monovalent binding
takes place, as shown in the diagram. [http://nfs.unipv.it/nfs/minf/

resulting cross-linked complex becomes so large that it falls
out of solution as a precipitate. This precipitate can be spun
out of the solution and the antigen separated from the precipitating antibodies by biochemical means.
Solution immunoprecipitation can be used to purify antigenic molecules from a heterogeneous mixture of soluble
molecules, or to remove particular antigens from a solution.
Immunoprecipitation occurs only when the antibody and
antigen concentrations are essentially equivalent (see center
panel in Figure 20-2). At either antigen (Figure 20-2, left
panel) or antibody (Figure 20-2, right panel) excess, monovalent binding is favored that does not result in the formation of a precipitate. Recall from Chapter 3 that Kabat used
immunoprecipitation with the ovalbumin antigen to remove
anti-ovalbumin antibodies from solution, followed by electrophoresis; this experiment characterized antibodies as
belonging to the ␥ globulin class of serum proteins.

Immunoprecipitation of Soluble Antigens Can
Be Performed in Gel Matrices
Immune precipitates can form not only in solution but also
in an agar matrix. When antigen and antibody diffuse
toward one another in a gel matrix, a visible line of precipitation will form. As in a precipitation reaction in solution,
visible precipitation occurs when the concentrations of antibody and antigen are equivalent to one another.
Immunodiffusion in gels is rapid, easy to perform and
surprisingly accurate. In the Ouchterlony method, the most

Experimental Systems and Methods
frequently employed variation of gel immunoprecipitation,
both antigen and antibody diffuse radially from wells toward
each other, thereby establishing a concentration gradient. At
the relative antibody-antigen concentrations at which lattice
formation is maximized, termed “equivalence,” a visible line
of precipitation, or “precipitin line,” forms in the gel. More
sophisticated analyses of Ouchterlony gels can offer information regarding the extent of cross-reactivity of antibody
preparations with related antigens (see Figure 20-3).
Although various modifications of precipitation reactions
were at one time the major types of assay used in immunology, other more sensitive methods are now available for
antigen and antibody measurement and are described below.
However, Ouchterlony assays are still occasionally used in
the clinic. Table 20-1 presents a comparison of the sensitivity,
or minimum amount of antibody detectable, of a number of
immunoassays.

Immunoprecipitation Allows Characterization
of Cell-Bound Molecules
A variant of immunoprecipitation is often used to isolate
protein antigens from cell and tissue samples. A detergent
extract of cells or tissues is mixed with antibodies to the
protein of interest to form an antigen-antibody complex. To
facilitate efficient retrieval of this complex, a secondary antibody, or other protein such as the bacterial Proteins A or G,
can now be added. These secondary reagents all bind specifically to the Fc region of the first antibody and are normally preattached to a solid-phase support, such as a
synthetic bead. Since the beads can be easily spun down in a

technique, the beads attached to the secondary reagents may
be magnetic, in which case the protein of interest is purified
by passage over a magnetic column (see below).
Western blotting (see below) can then be used to ascertain the efficacy of the immunoprecipitation, to estimate the
relative abundance of the bound protein in the tissue sample
and to determine which other proteins co-immunoprecipitated
and therefore are most likely associated with the target protein in its cellular location. Such co-immunoprecipitation
studies were the first clue to the multimolecular natures of
the TCR and BCR co-receptor complexes.

Agglutination Reactions
The cross-linking that occurs between di- or multivalent
antibodies and multivalent, bacterial, or other cellular antigens can result in visible clumping of the complexes formed
between cells bearing the antigens and the antibody molecules. This clumping reaction is called agglutination, and
antibodies that produce such reactions are called agglutinins. Agglutination reactions are identical in principle to
precipitation reactions; the only difference is that the crosslinked product is visible to the naked eye because of the
larger size of the antigens.

Hemagglutination Reactions Can Be Used to
Detect Any Antigen Conjugated to the Surface
of Red Blood Cells
When antibodies bind antigens on the surface of red blood
cells (RBCs), the resultant clumping reaction is referred to
as hemagglutination. In the example shown in Figure 20-4,
control buffer was added to well 10 of the microtiter tray.
Antibodies to sheep red blood cells (SRBCs) were added to
well one of this tray, and then this antiserum was serially
diluted into wells 2 through 9, such that the concentration
of antibodies to the SRBCs in well 2 was half that in well 1,
and so on. The same number of SRBCs was then added to
each well.

FIGURE 20-4 Demonstration of hemagglutination using
antibodies against sheep red blood cells (SRBCs). The control
tube (10) contains only SRBCs, which settle into a solid “button.” The
experimental tubes 1 to 9 contain a constant number of SRBCs plus
serial twofold dilutions of anti-SRBC serum. The spread pattern in the
experimental series indicates positive hemagglutination through
tube 3. [Louisiana State University Medical Center/MIP. Courtesy of Harriet C. W.
Thompson.]

/Volumes/203/MHR00209/siL52070/disk1of1/0071052070

In well 10, in the absence of any agglutinating antibody,
the SRBCs settle into a tight button in the bottom of the well.
This tight button represents a negative result in a hemagglutination assay. In well 1, the high concentration of anti-SRBC
antibodies induced cross-linking of the SRBCs, so that they
form a large clump and do not fall down to the bottom of the
well. The diffuse shading of RBCs seen in well 1 represents a
positive interaction between the antibodies and the SRBC
surface antigen. The concentration of anti-SRBC antibodies
in wells 2 and 3 remains high enough to allow hemagglutination, but once the antibodies have been diluted eightfold
(well 4), there are too few antibodies to generate cross-links
and the SRBCs can again settle into the bottom of the well.
The responses in wells 1, 2, and 3 therefore represent a positive hemagglutination reaction.
Hemagglutination reactions are routinely performed to
type RBCs. With tens of millions of blood-typing determinations run each year, this is one of the world’s most frequently
used immunoassays. In typing for the human ABO antigens,
human RBCs are mixed with antisera to the A or B bloodgroup antigens. If the antigen is present on the cells, they
agglutinate, forming a visible clump on the slide.
The ease and sensitivity of hemagglutination reactions
and the fact that they do not require sensitive instrumentation for data analysis mean that hemagglutination assays can
be adapted to measure antibodies directed against any antigen that can be attached to the RBC surface.

Hemagglutination Inhibition Reactions Are
Used to Detect the Presence of Viruses
and of Antiviral Antibodies
Hemagglutination inhibition reactions are also useful tools
in the clinic and in the laboratory for the detection of viruses
and of antiviral antibodies. Some viruses (most notably
influenza) bear multivalent proteins or glycoproteins on
their surfaces that interact with macromolecules on the RBC
surface, and induce agglutination of the RBCs. For example,
the influenza virus envelope bears a trimeric glycoprotein,
hemagglutinin (HA). This HA molecule is subjected to
mutation and selection, such that different strains of influenza bear different HA types, which in turn are bound by
different antibodies. However, all HA molecules bind in a
multivalent manner to the sialic acid residues on RBCs and
agglutinate them.
To determine whether a patient has antibodies to a particular strain of influenza virus, a technician would perform
a serial dilution of the patient’s antiserum in a microtiter
plate. The technician would then add the relevant virus and
RBCs to each well, at concentrations known to induce hemagglutination. If the patient’s antiserum has anti-HA antibodies that bind the particular influenza strain being tested,
the antibodies will attach to the HA molecules on the surface
of the virus and prevent those molecules from inducing
hemagglutination. Therefore, the hemagglutination reaction
will be inhibited at several antibody concentrations.

Bacterial Agglutination Can Be Used
to Detect Antibodies to Bacteria
A bacterial infection often elicits the production of antibacterial antibodies specific for surface antigens on the bacterial
cells; such antibodies can be detected by bacterial agglutination reactions. The principle of bacterial agglutination is
identical to that for hemagglutination, but in this case the
visible pellet is made up of bacteria, cross-linked by antibacterial antibodies.
Agglutination reactions can also provide quantitative
information about the concentration of antibacterial antibodies in a patient’s serum. The patients’ sera are serially
diluted, as described above. The last well in which agglutination is visible tells us the agglutinin titer of the patient,
defined as the reciprocal of the greatest serum dilution that
elicits a positive agglutination reaction. The agglutinin titer of
an antiserum can be used to diagnose a bacterial infection.
Patients with typhoid fever, for example, show a significant
rise in the agglutination titer to Salmonella typhi. Agglutination reactions also provide a way to type bacteria. For
instance, different species of the bacterium Salmonella can
be distinguished by agglutination reactions with a panel of
typing antisera.

Antibody Assays Based on Molecule
Binding to Solid-Phase Supports
With increasing numbers of antibody-based assays in use in
the clinic, and the consequent need for automation to ensure
high throughput of patient diagnostic tests, many antibodybased assays now rely on antibodies or antigens that are
bound to solid-phase supports, such as microtiter plates,
microscope slides, or beads of different kinds.

Radioimmunoassays Are Used to Measure the
Concentrations of Biologically Relevant
Proteins and Hormones in Body Fluids
Although many radioimmunoassays (RIAs) have now been
replaced by enzyme-based immunoassays, some hormonal
measurements are still made using this technology. Furthermore, the historical significance of RIAs necessitates a brief
introduction here.
In 1960, two endocrinologists, S. A. Berson and Rosalyn
Yalow, designed an exquisitely sensitive technique to
determine levels of insulin/anti-insulin complexes in diabetic patients. Their technique soon proved its value for
measuring hormones, serum proteins, drugs, and vitamins
at levels that were orders of magnitude lower than had
previously been detectable. Their accomplishment was
recognized in 1977 (several years after Berson’s death), by
the award of a Nobel Prize to Yalow (Figure 20-5). The key
to understanding the significance of this technological
breakthrough is to realize that, prior to the development of

FIGURE 20-5 Rosalind Sussman Yalow. Creator of the radioimmunoassay technique and Nobel Laureate, 1977. [Courtesy Department of Chemistry, Michigan State University.]

the RIA, the concentrations of many biologically relevant
proteins and hormones in body fluids were too low to
detect by any known methods. Rather than representing
merely an alteration in the sensitivity of established assays,
the RIA therefore made it possible to measure substances
that had hitherto been undetectable by any quantitative
methodology.
Since the initial description of Yalow’s assay, many technical variations have been developed to make the method
more rapid and reliable. However, all variations depend on
the availability of radioactively labeled antibody or antigen,
and a method by which to separate antigen-antibody complexes from unbound reagents. We will describe one such
assay here, but there are many ways to use this methodology
to accomplish the desired experimental goal. Most RIAs still
in use are based on the binding of antibody or antigen to a
solid-phase support, such as the polystyrene or polyvinylchloride wells of a microtiter plate. The radioactive label that
is most commonly used is 125I, which binds to exposed tyrosine residues on proteins, with little effect on their overall
structure.
The goal of the application we will describe is to determine the concentration of a particular cytokine in the blood

c20ExperimentalSystemsandMethods.indd Page 660 12/20/12 9:56 PM user-t044

Experimental Methods
One can measure either antigen or antibody concentrations using variations on this basic technique, which is
extremely powerful, and capable of sensitivities in the picogram range. However, with the proliferation of RIAs came
increasing levels of concern about the amount of radioactivity generated by research and clinical laboratories and the
associated risks to the technical staff and to the environment.
The next development in antibody-antigen solid-phase support assays was the Enzyme Linked Immuno-Sorbent Assay,
or ELISA.

FIGURE 20-6 A competitive, solid-phase radioimmunoassay (RIA) to measure cytokine concentrations in serum. Anticytokine antibody is used to coat an RIA plate. A standard curve is
obtained by adding increasing concentrations of unlabeled cytokine to a constant amount of 125I-labeled cytokine. The experimental
sample is then added to duplicate or triplicate wells containing the
same amount of labeled cytokine as that used for the standard
curve. As the unlabeled cytokine outcompetes the labeled form for
binding to the plate, the amount of radioactivity per well drops in a
predictable fashion, shown here. The amount of cytokine in the
experimental samples can then be measured by interpolation from
the standard curve.

of a patient. First, the wells of a microtiter plate are coated
with a constant amount of antibody specific for the cytokine.
The surface of the plastic binds tightly to proteins that stick,
essentially irreversibly, to the plastic surface.
A known amount of radiolabeled cytokine is added to a
set of control wells. A standard curve of unlabeled cytokines
is then set up by adding increasing, known concentrations of
cytokine to successive wells, along with the radiolabeled
cytokine. As more unlabeled antigen competes with the
labeled antigen, less and less radiolabeled cytokine will bind.
After an incubation period, the amount of bound radiolabeled material is measured by washing off the unbound
material and measuring the radioactivity in individual wells.
An example of a standard curve generated in this way is
shown in Figure 20-6.
The measurement of the amount of cytokine in the
experimental samples is accomplished by treating the
unknown samples in exactly the same way as the standard
curve. The investigator then compares the amount of radioactivity bound to the plate in the experimental wells with the
radioactive signal obtained in the standard curve wells containing known amounts of unlabeled cytokine.

ELISA assays are similar in principle to RIAs but, instead of
using antibodies or antigens conjugated to radioisotopes,
they use antibodies or antigens covalently bound to enzymes.
The conjugated enzymes are selected on the basis of their
ability to catalyze the conversion of a substrate into a colored, fluorescent, or chemiluminescent product. These
assays match the sensitivity of RIAs and have the advantage
of being safer and, often, less costly.
A number of variations of the basic ELISA assay have
been developed (Figure 20-7). Each type of ELISA can be
used qualitatively to detect the presence of antibody or antigen. Alternatively, a standard curve based on known concentrations of antibody or antigen can be prepared and used to
determine the concentration of a sample.
Indirect ELISA
Antibody can be detected, or its concentration determined
with an indirect ELISA assay (see Figure 20-7a). Serum or
some other sample containing primary antibody (Ab1) is
added to an antigen-coated microtiter well and allowed to
react with the antigen attached to the well. After any free Ab1
is washed away, the antibody bound to the antigen is
detected by adding an enzyme-conjugated secondary antibody (Ab2) that binds to Ab1. Any free Ab2 is again washed
away, and a substrate for the enzyme is added. The amount
of colored, fluorescent, or luminescent reaction product that
forms is measured using a specialized plate reader and compared with the amount of product generated when the same
set of reactions is performed using a standard curve of
known Ab1 concentrations. (A direct ELISA assay would
detect the amount of antigen on the plate using enzyme
coupled antibodies, and is rarely used.)
This version of ELISA is the method of choice to detect
the presence of serum antibodies against human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), the causative agent of AIDS. In this
assay, recombinant envelope and core proteins of HIV are
adsorbed as solid-phase antigens to microtiter wells. Individuals infected with HIV will produce serum antibodies to
epitopes on these viral proteins. Generally, serum antibodies to HIV can be detected by ELISA within 6 weeks of
infection.

FIGURE 20-7 Variations in enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) technique allow determination of antibody or
antigen. Each assay can be used qualitatively or quantitatively by comparison with standard curves prepared with known concentrations of
antibody or antigen. Antibody can be determined with an indirect ELISA (a), whereas antigen can be determined with a sandwich ELISA (b) or
competitive ELISA (c). In the competitive ELISA, which is an inhibition-type assay that is identical in principle to the competition RIA described
above, the concentration of antigen is inversely proportional to the color produced.

Sandwich ELISA
Antigen can be detected or measured by a sandwich ELISA (see
Figure 20-7b). In this technique, the antibody (rather than the
antigen) is immobilized on a microtiter well. A sample containing unknown amounts of antigen is allowed to react with the
immobilized antibody. After the well is washed, a second
enzyme-linked antibody specific for a different epitope on the
antigen is added and allowed to react with the bound antigen.
After any free second antibody is removed by washing, substrate is added, and the colored reaction product is measured.
A common variant on this assay uses a biotin-linked second antibody and then adds enzyme-linked avidin in an
additional step (see below). Sandwich ELISAs have proven
particularly useful for the measurement of soluble cytokine
concentrations in tissue culture supernatants, as well as in

serum and body fluids. Note that, for this assay to work, the
two antibodies used for the antigen immobilization (capture) and detection phases respectively must bind to different determinants (epitopes) on the antigen. Sandwich
ELISAs therefore routinely use a pair of monoclonal antibodies specific for different regions on the antigen.
Competitive ELISA
The competitive ELISA provides another extremely sensitive
variation for measuring amounts of antigen (see Figure
20-7c). In this technique, antibody is first incubated in solution with a sample containing antigen. The antigen-antibody
mixture is then added to an antigen-coated microtiter well.
The more antigen present in the initial solution-phase sample, the less free antibody will be available to bind to the

antigen-coated well. After washing off the unbound antibody, an enzyme-conjugated Ab2 specific for the isotype of
the Ab1 can be added to determine the amount of Ab1 bound
to the well. In the competitive assay, the higher the concentration of antigen in the original sample, the lower the final
signal, just as in the cytokine-specific RIA described above.

The Design of an ELISA Assay Must Consider
Various Methodological Options
When designing an ELISA assay, attention must be paid to
the expected concentration of the antigen or antibody in the
test solution and hence to the required sensitivity. The investigator will also have to make an informed decision regarding
the number of replicates required, as this will determine the
confidence limits of the results and affect the cost of the assay.
Finally, the present and future needs of the laboratory to perform multiple ELISAs for different antigens or antibodies
must be considered, as this will determine whether the investigator purchases reagents that are applicable to more than
one type of ELISA, or just a single type of secondary antibody. Below, we briefly discuss some of these variables and
other technical factors that have to be considered by anyone
setting up a particular ELISA assay for the first time.
Available Enzyme Systems for ELISA Assays
The three enzymes commonly used in ELISA assays are alkaline phosphatase, ␤-galactosidase, and horseradish peroxidase (HRP), each of which can be used with chromogenic
substrates (substrates which are colorless but give rise to a
product that absorbs light in the visible range). Of these
three, ␤-galactosidase is the least frequently employed and
will not be discussed further.
The most common substrate for alkaline phosphatase is
p-nitrophenyl phosphate (pNPP), which is highly soluble
and colorless. Alkaline phosphatase cleaves the phosphate
group from this substrate to yield p-nitrophenol, which is
yellow and absorbs light at 460 nm. Both substrate and product are nontoxic and inexpensive, and the substrate can be
purchased in tablet form. However, the substrate will convert to product if left in solution at room temperature, which
somewhat limits the range of the chromogenic ELISA assay.
Chromogenic alkaline phosphatase assays are therefore
extremely useful when a rapid, inexpensive, “yes or no”
answer is called for, when the laboratory facilities are limited, and/or for multipurpose teaching laboratories. Recently,
both fluorescent and luminescent assay kits for alkaline
phosphatase have been made available by a variety of companies. The lower background level of light emission from
such products dramatically enhances the sensitivity of the
assays, allowing femtogram levels of antigens to be detected.
A similar array of substrate-product systems has been
developed for the HRP-based ELISAs. Because fluorescent and
luminescent substrates were available first for the HRP system,
there are more HRP than alkaline phosphatase kits and variations currently available. The carcinogenic properties of some

HRP substrates and products mean that alkaline phosphatase
is often still used in lower-level teaching laboratories, where
inexperienced hands make safety concerns paramount.
Chromogenic, Fluorogenic,
or Chemiluminogenic Substrates
As indicated above, chromogenic substrates that give rise to a
colored product are particularly useful for “yes or no” assays,
as they can be read by the naked eye. They are quick to use
and do not require costly instrumentation. In addition, they
can be adapted to quantitative applications by use of a standard curve and a spectrophotometric plate reader. In contrast, fluorogenic and chemiluminogenic substrates offer
significant advantages in terms of sensitivity, but they require
specialized equipment. Indeed, some fluorescence and chemiluminescence-based assay systems are capable of detecting
attomolar concentrations of antibodies or antigens. As might
be expected, the substrates themselves are also somewhat
more expensive than those used in chromogenic systems.
Modifications of ELISAs Using Biotin-Streptavidin
Bonding Interactions
The original design of secondary ELISA assays involved the
addition of a primary antibody to the antigen, followed by a
secondary, enzyme-conjugated antibody specific for the Fc
region of the primary antibody. This requires that each laboratory purchase a separate set of enzyme-conjugated antibodies specific for each class of primary antibody. Given that
some ELISA kits use primary antibodies from different species, investigators quickly realized the advantages that would
accrue if the enzyme could be bound to the primary antibody using a more standardized method.
Biotin is a water-soluble B complex vitamin (Figure 20-8a),
which may have remained in chemical obscurity but for one
significant property: It binds to the bacterial protein streptavidin with an affinity that is almost unparalleled in biology.
Indeed, the Kd of the biotin-streptavidin interaction is of the
order of 10⫺14M, making it one of the strongest naturally occurring, noncovalent interactions in nature. Furthermore, this
interaction is stable under a wide variety of conditions, including in the presence of both organic and nonorganic solvents,
denaturants, and detergents, and in extremes of temperature.
Streptavidin is a tetrameric protein capable of binding four
molecules of biotin per molecule of streptavidin (Figure 20-8b).
Many chemical derivatives of biotin have been synthesized that enable covalent conjugation to antibodies, with
minimal effect on the structure of the antibody or of biotin.
Thus, one can use a variety of primary, biotin-conjugated
antibodies with just one enzyme-conjugated stock of streptavidin. Biotin-streptavidin–based steps are now the norm in
many immunological assays.
Students should note that one of the reasons for the sensitivity of ELISA assays lies in the opportunity for amplification at
each step. Each molecule of primary antibody is capable of being
conjugated by more than one molecule of biotin, and hence can

bind more than one streptavidin molecule. Similarly, each
enzyme molecule will process multiple substrates into product.

ELISPOT Assays Measure Molecules Secreted
by Individual Cells
A modification of the ELISA, called the ELISPOT assay,
allows the quantitative determination of the number of cells
in a population that are producing a particular type of molecule. ELISPOT assays are frequently used to detect and
quantify the number of cells in a population that are producing particular cytokines. They represent a variation on the
sandwich ELISA described above.
In an ELISPOT assay for interferon ␥ ( IFN␥), for example,
assay plates are coated with anti-IFN␥ antibody. This antibody
is referred to as the “capture antibody” because its role is to
capture interferon as it is secreted by individual cells and
before it has had time to diffuse into the rest of the culture. A
suspension of the cell population under investigation is then
added to the coated plates and incubated with any appropriate
stimulating agents. The cells settle onto the surface of the
plate, and any interferon that is secreted by the stimulated cells
is bound by the capture antibodies on the plate, creating a ring
of IFN␥-antibody complexes around each interferon-producing
cell. The plate is then washed to remove the cells, and an
enzyme-linked antibody, the “detection antibody,” specific for
an antigenic determinant on IFN␥ different from that bound
by the capture antibody, is added and allowed to bind. After
another washing step, an ELISPOT substrate is added. Substrates for ELISPOT assays are normally colorless but, when
acted on by their cognate enzyme, they precipitate out of solution, leaving a clearly demarcated, colored “spot” wherever the
enzyme-conjugated antibody bound. An example of data generated in an ELISPOT assay is shown in Figure 20-9.

FIGURE 20-9 ELISPOT measurements of interferon ␥
secretion by NKT cells. A capture antibody to interferon ␥ was
bound to a polyvinylidene difluoride–coated well of a microplate,
and NKT cells were added at the appropriate concentration. After a
17-hour stimulation with phorbol myristoyl acetate and ionomycin,
the cells were washed off and a biotin-conjugated, interferon-␥
specific detection antibody was added and allowed to bind. Following removal of excess detecting antibody, streptavidin-conjugated
alkaline phosphatase was added, followed (after washing out excess
enzyme) by the substrate BCIP/NBT. BCIP/NBT is converted from a
colorless solution to the brown-black substrate seen in the figure.
The photograph shows the results of PMA/ionomycin stimulation of
the NKT cells. Each brown-black spot represents the site of a cell that
secreted interferon ␥. These spots can be counted under a dissecting microscope at low power. [Nicole Cunningham and Jenni Punt,

Western Blotting Can Identify a Specific
Protein in a Complex Protein Mixture
Western blotting identifies and provides preliminary quantitation of a specific protein in a complex mixture of proteins.
In Western blotting, a protein mixture is electrophoretically
separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (Figure
20-10). In order to prevent diffusion of the bands that have
been tightly focused by the electric field, the protein bands
are then electrophoretically transferred on to a nitrocellulose
or polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) membrane. The individual protein bands are then identified by flooding the membrane with enzyme-linked antibodies specific for the protein
of interest. In an alternative version of the protocol that
should now be familiar to the reader, the membrane may first
be incubated with a biotin-conjugated antibody, followed by
washing and addition of a streptavidin-conjugated enzyme.
The protein-antibody complexes that form on the membrane
are visualized by the addition of a chromogenic substrate that
produces a highly colored and insoluble product at the site of
the target protein. Even greater sensitivity can be achieved if
a chemiluminescent compound with suitable enhancing
agents is used to produce light at the antigen site, which is
detected by the appropriate instrumentation.

Methods to Determine the Affinity
of Antigen-Antibody Interactions
Two methods are commonly encountered in the immunological literature to determine the affinity of antigen-antibody
binding. The older method, equilibrium dialysis, is easy, inexpensive, and illustrates several important concepts about
antigen-antibody interactions. It will be described briefly,
first. The more modern technique of surface plasmon resonance (SPR) has displaced equilibrium dialysis as the method
of choice in the modern research laboratory (see below), but
it requires the purchase of specific instrumentation.

Experimental Systems and Methods
Antibody affinity is a quantitative measure of binding
strength between an antigen and an antibody. The combined
strength of the noncovalent interactions between a single
antigen-binding site on an antibody and a single epitope is
the affinity of the antibody for that epitope and can be
described by the association constant of the interaction (see
Chapter 3).

Equilibrium Dialysis Can Be Used to Measure
Antibody Affinity for Antigen
Equilibrium dialysis uses a chamber containing two compartments separated by a semipermeable membrane. Antibody is placed in one compartment, and a radioactively (or
otherwise) labeled ligand, small enough to pass through
the semipermeable membrane, is placed in the other compartment (Figure 20-11). In the absence of antibody, ligand

added to compartment B will equilibrate on both sides of
the membrane (see Figure 20-11a). In the presence of antibody however, some of the labeled ligand molecules will be
bound to the antibody at equilibrium, trapping the ligand
on the antibody side of the vessel, whereas unbound ligand
will be equally distributed in both compartments. Thus, the
total concentration of ligand will be greater in the compartment containing antibody (see Figure 20-11b). The difference in the ligand concentration in the two compartments
represents the concentration of ligand bound to the antibody (i.e., the concentration of Ag-Ab complex). The
higher the affinity of the antibody, the more ligand is
bound.
Since the concentration of antibody placed into compartment A can be known, and the concentration of bound
antigen (and therefore bound antibody) and free antigen can
be deduced from the amounts of radioactivity in the antibody and nonantibody compartments respectively, the association constant can be calculated.
Equation 1 can be rewritten as

Equation (3) tells us that a plot of [SL]/[L] versus [SL]
should yield a straight line with a slope of ⫺Ka and an intercept on the abscissa corresponding to the antibody-binding
site concentration. (This is because when [SL]/[L] ⫽ 0, then
Ka[St] ⫽ Ka[SL] and therefore St ⫽ [SL]). This plot is referred
to as a Scatchard plot. Note that this equation holds when
the ligand is monovalent, which is the case for most small
molecules whose affinity is measured in equilibrium dialysis
experiments.
Sometimes, measurements of ligand binding are made at
several different total antibody concentrations and, in this
case, it is useful to be able to normalize our measurements to
antibody concentration. If we divide equation (3) by the total
concentration of antibody molecules, we obtain an equation
that is familiar to many immunologists and biochemists:
r

c ⫽ Ka (n ⫺ r)
where r is defined as the number of occupied sites per antibody molecule, n is defined as the total number of sites per

From equation (4), we see that a plot of r/c versus r will
yield a slope of ⫺Ka and an intercept on the abscissa of n
(Figure 20-12). From this plot, one can therefore also gain
information about the valency, n, of the antibody population under study.
If the plot of r/c versus r is a straight line, this is indicative
of a single binding affinity (see Figure 20-12a), such as we
would find in working with a mAb population. A heterogeneous mixture of antibodies would instead yield a curved
line. With a curved-line plot (Figure 20-12b), it is still possible to determine the average affinity constant, by measuring the value of Ka when half the antigen-binding sites are
filled. This can be done by using the appropriate software to
determine the slope of the curve at the point where r ⫽ 1.
Although more sophisticated technologies now exist for
the determination of antibody affinity (see below), they
require expensive instrumentation, whereas equilibrium
dialysis merely requires some dialysis tubing, antigen, antibody, and a way in which to distinguish bound from free

mon resonance (SPR), which is more rapid and sensitive and
can also provide information about antigen-antibody reaction
rates (Figure 20-13). SPR relies on the occurrence of electromagnetic waves, called surface plasmons, that propagate at the
interface of a metal and a solvent. The nature of the wave is
sensitive to any alteration in this boundary, such as the
adsorption of molecules to the metal surface. SPR works by
detecting changes in the reflectance properties at the surface
of an antigen-coated metal sensor when it binds antibody.

fer solution containing antibody is passed through a flow chamber,
one wall of which contains a layer of immobilized antigen. As
explained in the text, formation of antigen-antibody complexes on
this layer causes a change in the resonant angle of a beam of polarized light against the back face of the layer. A sensitive detector
records changes in the resonant angle as antigen-antibody complexes form. (b) Interpretation of a sensorgram. There are four stages

which represent a change of 0.0001 degree in the resonance angle)

Ag-Ab complexes are present, establishing a baseline. Stage II: Antibody is introduced into the flow and Ag-Ab complexes form. The
ascending slope of this curve is proportional to the forward rate of
the reaction. Stage III: The curve plateaus when all sites that can be
bound at the prevailing antibody concentration are filled. The height
of the plateau is directly proportional to the antibody concentration.
Stage IV: The flow cell is flushed with buffer containing no antibody
and the Ag-Ab complexes dissociate. The rate of dissociation is proportional to the slope of the dissociation curve. The ratio of the
slopes, ascending over descending, equals k1/k2 ⫽ ka.

Experimental Methods

Although the physics underlying SPR is rather sophisticated, the actual methodology is quite straightforward (see
Figure 20-13a). A beam of polarized light is directed through
a prism onto a chip coated with a thin gold film (coated with
antigen on the opposite side), and reflected off the gold film
toward a light-collecting sensor. At a unique angle, some incident light is absorbed by the gold layer, and its energy is transformed into surface plasmon waves. A sharp dip in the
reflected light intensity can be measured at that angle, which
is called the resonant angle. This angle depends on the color
of the light, the thickness and conductivity of the metal film,
and the optical properties of the material close to the gold
layer’s surfaces.
The SPR method takes advantage of the last of these factors, as the binding of antibodies to the antigen attached to
the film produces a detectable change in the resonant angle,
and the amount of the change is proportional to the number
of bound antibodies. By measuring the rate at which the
resonant angle changes during an antigen-antibody reaction,
the rate of the antigen-antibody binding reaction can be
determined (see Figure 20-13b).
Operationally, this is done by passing a solution of
known concentration of antibody over the antigen-coated
chip. A plot of the changes in the resonant angle versus
time measured during an SPR experiment is called a sensorgram. In the course of an antigen-antibody reaction,
the sensorgram plot rises until all of the sites capable of
binding antibody (at a given concentration) have done so.
Beyond that point, the sensorgram plateaus. The data from
these measurements can be used to calculate k1, the association rate constant for the antibody-antigen binding
reaction.
Once the plateau has been reached on the sensorgram
plot, solution containing no antibody can be passed
through the chamber. Under these conditions, the antigenantibody complexes dissociate, allowing calculation of
the dissociation rate constant, k2. Measurement of k1 and
k2 allows determination of the affinity constant, Ka, since
Ka ⫽ k1/k2.

Microscopic Visualization of Cells
and Subcellular Structures
Imaging of cells and tissues can be accomplished using antibodies specific for antigens present in tissues that are conjugated to other molecules. If the molecule bound to the
antibody is an enzyme, the presence of the antigens in the
tissue sample can be visualized by washing away excess
antibodies and adding substrates that are modified by the
antibody-conjugated enzymes to create insoluble colored
precipitates at the precise sites of antibody binding. Techniques that rely on this basic approach include immunocytochemistry and immunohistochemistry, and these methods
use simple compound microscopes, coupled with computer-

controlled systems to create images of fixed tissues. If the
molecule conjugated to the antibody is a fluorescent dye, the
antigen is visualized directly by fluorescence microscopy as
described in the next section.

Immunocytochemistry and
Immunohistochemistry Use
Enzyme-Conjugated Antibodies
to Create Images of Fixed Tissues
Immunocytochemistry and immunohistochemistry are
both techniques that rely on the use of enzyme-conjugated
antibodies to bind to proteins or other antigens in intact
cells. A variety of enzyme-conjugated antibodies is available
at this point, but classically the cell is treated in such a way
that an antibody conjugated to an enzyme such as peroxidase is localized at the antigen binding site. This can be
accomplished either directly, by using a peroxidase-conjugated
antibody to bind to the cellular antigen, or indirectly, by using
a biotin-conjugated primary antibody and streptavidinconjugated peroxidase, as described above. Alternatively, as
for ELISA, a secondary, peroxidase-conjugated antibody that
binds to the Fc region of the primary, tissue-specific antibody can be used.
In these experiments, the peroxidase substrate is selected
such that the enzyme’s product forms a colored precipitate
that is visible under the light microscope, and is deposited at
the site of antibody binding. Using a range of enzymes with
different substrates can allow the deposition of products of
different colors that reflect the binding of different antibodies. Various chemical additives are available that can enhance
the density and/or the color of the staining. The quality of
the staining reaction depends on the ratio of specific to nonspecific staining, and so the investigator usually performs
the staining reaction in the presence of relatively high concentrations of nonspecific proteins, such as nonfat dry milk
(really!) in order to minimize nonspecific antibody binding.
In expert hands, the images obtained from these techniques
can be extraordinarily detailed and also aesthetically pleasing (Figure 20-14).
Immunocytochemistry and immunohistochemistry
differ from one another in the nature of the sample being
analyzed. In immunohistochemistry, the samples are prepared by sectioning intact tissue and the stained cells are
therefore localized in their biological context. Because the
sample is prepared by sectioning (cutting), immunohistochemical samples need not be permeabilized by detergent
treatment prior to staining, as the cut surfaces of cells
allow antibody to reach intracellular targets. In contrast,
immunocytochemistry is performed on isolated cells,
often those grown in tissue-culture suspension. If staining is designed to detect intracellular targets, the cells
must first be permeabilized by organic fixatives, or by
detergent.

Immunoelectron Microscopy Uses Gold Beads
to Visualize Antibody-Bound Antigens
In order to resolve fine structure details at high levels of
magnification, scientists may need to use electron microscopy, rather than light microscopy. In such experiments,
antibodies are coupled to electron dense particles such as
colloidal gold particles. Wherever antibodies bind, gold
deposits will be detected by the electron microscope. By
using differently sized gold particles conjugated to particular antibodies, the subcellular relationship between two
or more different antigenic epitopes can be analyzed (Figure 20-15).

Immunofluorescence-Based
Imaging Techniques
The last decade has seen a veritable explosion in the manner
in which fluorescence microscopy has been applied to studies of the immune system. Since students will be exposed to
many of these techniques in the current primary literature,
we present here a summary of the common variations of
immunofluorescence. See also Box 14-1, which describes
some important dynamic imaging techniques.

Fluorescence Can Be Used to Visualize
Cells and Molecules
The phenomenon of fluorescence results from the property
of some molecules to absorb light at one wavelength and

emit it at a longer wavelength. If the emitted light has a wavelength in the visible region of the spectrum, the fluorescent
dye can be used to image any molecules bound by that dye.
Antibody and streptavidin conjugates of a host of dyes have
been used to provide spectacular images of cellular and subcellular structures, as well as to identify cells binding to those
antibodies in flow cytometric experiments (see below). In
addition, cells and animals can be engineered to express
particular fluorescent proteins such as green fluorescent protein (GFP) or red fluorescent protein (RFP) under the control of cell- or tissue-specific promoters. The dyes can then
be used to visualize the loci where proteins under the control
of those same promoters are expressed. Other dyes specifically bind to particular macromolecules. For example, the
blue dye 4⬘,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) specifically
stains DNA. The protein phalloidin, which specifically binds
filamentous actin, can also be conjugated to fluorescent
probes (Figure 20-16a).

Immunofluorescence Microscopy Uses
Antibodies Conjugated with Fluorescent Dyes
In standard immunofluorescence microscopy, the cell or
tissue sample is stained with an antibody bound either
directly or indirectly with a fluorescent dye, and then the
slide holding the sample is placed on the microscope stage.
Incident light excites the fluorescence in the sample, and
filters ensure that only light of the required wavelength
reaches the objective (Figure 20-16b). More modern instruments detect light at multiple different fluorescent wavelengths that is emitted after excitation of dyes conjugated to

passes through a barrier filter that only allows passage of blue light of

various antibodies. The multiple color images can then be
overlaid by the instrument’s software to provide a single
representation in which the locations of the antibodybound molecules can be compared.

Confocal Fluorescence Microscopy
Provides Three-Dimensional Images
of Extraordinary Clarity
One of the limiting factors in obtaining clear images from
fluorescence microscopy is the tendency of fluorescent
molecules lying above and below the focal plane to contribute to the light that reaches the objective. In confocal
microscopy, that artifact is eliminated by using an objective
lens that focuses the light from the desired focal plane
directly onto a pinhole aperture in front of the detector
(Figure 20-17a). Light emitted from molecules located at
other levels within the sample is stopped at the perimeter of
the pinhole, and remarkably clear images of a single plane
within the sample can thus be generated. In laser scanning
confocal microscopy, the investigator uses lasers to provide
the exciting light and computing power to move the focal
plane in all three dimensions, thus enabling him/her to scan
an x,y plane at different depths of focus, and reconstitute

particular wavelengths. The light is then directed onto the sample by
a dichroic mirror that reflects light of short wavelengths (below
approximately 510 nm) but allows passage of higher wavelengths.
When the blue light interacts with the sample, any fluorescent
molecules excited by it emit fluorescence that then passes through
the dichroic mirror, through a second barrier filter, and then is transmitted to the eyepiece. [(a) Image courtesy of Dr. Keith Bahjat, Earle A.

powerful three-dimensional images. Figure 20-17b shows a
spectacular image of blood vessels in mouse omentum, generated by this technique.

Multiphoton Fluorescence Microscopy Is a
Variation of Confocal Microscopy
Two-photon and multi-photon microscopy are variations
on confocal microscopy that offer even greater resolution
in the development of three-dimensional images, following
laser scanning of tissues (Box 14-1). In standard confocal
microscopy, excitation of the fluorescent probes (dyes)
occurs along the whole path of the laser beam through the
tissue. This means that, although the emission beams are
derived only from a single level within the sample, fluorescent probes are being excited throughout many levels of the
tissue. Since fluorescent probes will eventually “bleach”
(i.e., cease to emit light) after extensive excitation, this limits the useful life of the sample. It also means that additional light is emitted from the sample and must be filtered
out of the final image.
In multiphoton fluorescence microscopy, long wavelength lasers are used that emit in the infrared region of the
spectrum. These are relatively low energy, and so more than

FIGURE 20-17 The principles of confocal microscopy. (a) The sample is illuminated by
a laser beam that excites fluorescence from dyes
in several different focal planes, represented here
by the green, red, and purple lines. However, passage of light through the pinhole (shown on the
right side of the image) filters out light emitted
from all but a single focal plane, resulting in an
extraordinarily clear image. Computer control of
the exact plane from which light can be received
through the pinhole allows the development of
images from a number of focal planes and the
creation of a composite three-dimensional representation such as that shown in Figure 20-1.

omentum was stained with green dye-conjugated
antibodies specific for CD31, which stains all endothelial vessels in the omentum. A second, red
dye-conjugated antibody was then added specific

endothelial cells of the post-capillary end venules
(the vessels from which extravasation of immune
cells can occur). The red and green images were
acquired separately and merged. Vessels staining
both red and green appear yellow in this image.

one photon must impinge on a fluorescent molecule in
order to provide sufficient energy to excite the electrons.
The low energy of these infrared lasers minimizes the extent
of photobleaching and enhances the useful lifetime of the
sample. Furthermore, the fact that at least two beams of
light are required to bring about fluorescence excitation
ensures that excitation occurs only within the plane of intersection of the laser beams (Figure 20-18). By moving the
focal point of excitation within the x- and y- planes, information about a full optical section can be generated, and
that whole process can then be repeated on additional zlevels, thus giving rise to a three-dimensional image. In
Chapter 14, you have seen some of the powerful images
developed with this technique.

Intravital Imaging Allows Observation
of Immune Responses In Vivo
The topic of intravital imaging was addressed in Chapter 14, so
it will be dealt with only briefly here. Intravital imaging takes
advantage of the ability to maintain the circulation of lymph
nodes and other immunological organs, after they have been
gently lifted outside of an anaesthetized donor organism and
onto a warmed microscope stage. There, using a multiphoton
microscope, three-dimensional images of fluorescently labeled
cells and structures can be generated and information gleaned
about the behavior of immune cells essentially in vivo. Chapter
14 contains several links to movies taken in real time of stained
immune system cells in situ using this powerful technology.

Flow Cytometry
Flow cytometry is the sine qua non (without which, nothing)
of the modern immunologist’s toolbox. It was developed by
the Herzenbergs (Leonore and Leonard) and colleagues and
found some of its earliest applications in analyzing cells from
the blood, notably lymphocyte subpopulations. Flow cytometry per se is an analytical technique that quantifies the frequencies of cells binding to fluorescent antibodies and
scattering light in characteristic ways (see below). When a
flow cytometer is adapted to sort cell subpopulations on the
basis of fluorescence and light scattering, it is referred to as a
Fluorescence Activated Cell Sorter (FACS). Monoclonal
antibody and FACS technologies were developed at around
the same time, and the two technological breakthroughs
proved synergistic: the more antibodies that were available
for cell typing and sorting, the more informative flow cytometric experiments became.
The fluorescent microscopy applications described so far
are extremely valuable qualitative tools, but they do not provide quantitative data regarding the frequencies of cells
within a population that stain with specific antibodies and
that therefore belong to experimentally definable subpopulations. This shortcoming was addressed by the invention of
the flow cytometer, which was designed to automate the
analysis and separation of cells stained with different fluorescent antibodies.
The flow cytometer uses a laser beam and a series of
detectors to identify both scattered light and fluorescent
signals of particular wavelengths from single intact cells
flowing in a focused stream past the laser (Figure 20-19a).

is excited by a lower-energy 960 nm laser. The only molecules of fluorescein able to fluoresce are those that simultaneously absorb more
than one photon of energy. This can occur only in the focal plane
indicated by the yellow horizontal line. [W. R. Zipfel, R. M. Williams, and W.
W. Webb, 2002, Nonlinear magic: Multiphoton microscopy in the biosciences,
Nature Biotechnology 21:1369–1377, Figure 2.]

Cells in suspension are hydrodynamically focused into a
narrow stream by being introduced inside a rapidly moving
column of sheath fluid. Every time a cell passes in front of
the laser beam, light is scattered, and this interruption of the
laser signal is recorded.
One detector, called a photodiode, picks up light scattered in the forward direction (i.e., within a few degrees of
the original path of the laser beam). High forward light scattering (within 5 to 10 degrees of the light path of the laser
beam) provides an indication that the cells responsible for
this light scattering are large. The more forward light scatter,
the larger the cell, and so the amount of light scattered in the
forward direction can be used as a rough measure of the
range of sizes of the cells in the stream. A second light scattering detector is placed at approximately 90⬚ to the path of
the laser beam. The amount of side scattered light offers an
indication of the extent of intracellular complexity of the
scattering cells. The more side-angle light scatter, the more
intracellular membranous structures, such as endoplasmic
reticulum (ER) and mitochondria, are present in the scattering cell. Since much less light is detected by the side-angle
scatter detectors than by the forward scatter photo-diode
detector, side-scattered light is measured by sensitive photomultiplier tubes.
Fluorescently tagged antibodies bound to the surface antigens of particular cells can be excited by the laser. After excitation, they emit light that is recorded by a series of
photomultiplier tubes located at a right angle to the laser
beam. Each photomultiplier tube fluorescence detector is
placed behind a series of dichroic filters and mirrors, so that
it only receives and detects light within a particular range of

wavelengths. Flow cytometers count every cell as it passes
the laser beam and record the level of emitted fluorescence
at a number of different wavelengths, as well as the amounts
of forward- and side-scattered light for each cell; an attached
computer stores all the data for each cell, which can then be
called up by the analysis software as needed. This technology
is advancing very quickly, and flow cytometers capable of
detecting 8 to 12 fluorescence and light-scattering parameters are routinely used in clinical and research laboratories.
On the left of Figure 20-19b, we show an example of a
typical forward and side scatter plot from human white
blood cells. On the right of Figure 20-19b is a plot of the

gated in red in the scatter plot, which represents small, lowlight-scattering cells, or lymphocytes. These cells have been
stained with a fluorescein-conjugated antibody to CD8;
therefore, CD8-bearing T cells will fluoresce in the green
part of the spectrum. Green fluorescence is detected in the
FL1, or green channel of the detector. Similarly, CD4⫹ T cells
have been stained with an antibody conjugated with a fluorochrome (e.g., phycoerythrin, or PE) that is detected in the
FL2, or red channel. This plot therefore shows us that, of the
cells falling into the lymphocyte gate, 44% were red-staining
CD4-bearing cells and 23% were green-staining CD8-bearing
cells. See Advances Box 20-1 for a more nuanced discussion
of how a flow cytometer works.

Flow Cytometry Under the Hood
How does the flow cytometer actually

measure fluorescence, and what data are
you seeing when you view histograms,
dot plots, and contour plots?
The flow cytometer is a conceptually
simple instrument. It includes a fluidics
system that sends cells in single file in
front of one or more laser light sources
that can excite fluorochromes. Light
bounced or emitted from the cell is then
guided by a network of mirrors and filters
to light (photon) detectors, which record
the signal.
The filters used to sort and guide the
light coming from a cell fall into several
broad categories. Band pass (BP) filters
only allow light within a certain range of
wavelengths to pass. For example, a BP
filter might only allow passage of wavelengths from 520 nm to 550 nm. BP filters
are routinely described by a pair of numbers, the first of which denotes the central
wavelength of the BP filter and the second of which shows the range of wavelengths on either side of that central
wavelength that will be allowed to pass
through the filter (e.g., 530/30). Long pass
(LP) filters allow passage of any light of
wavelengths longer than the filter specification but reflect (or stop) light of shorter
wavelengths. A 640 LP filter, for example,
would allow any wavelengths longer than
640 nm to pass through, but would reflect
light of wavelengths shorter than 640 nm.
Short pass (SP) filters operate in a converse
manner, letting wavelengths lower than
the filter specification pass, but reflecting
higher wavelengths. Dichroic mirrors are
very useful; they reflect light of specific
wavelengths, allowing all other light to
pass, and can also be referred to as SP or
LP, depending on their characteristics. In
the example shown in Figure 1, the
dichroic mirror is allowing any light of
wavelengths greater than 500 nm to pass
through in the direction of the incident
light, but it is reflecting light of wave-

FIGURE 1
Flow cytometers contain dichroic mirrors. Dichroic mirrors allow passage of light of some
wavelengths and reflect light of others. In this example, the dichroic mirror is enabling passage of light
of wavelengths longer than 500 nm, but is reflecting light of shorter wavelengths in a direction perpendicular to the incident light. [J. Punt]

lengths lower than 500 nm in a direction
perpendicular to the incident light.
Dichroic mirrors are often placed at a 45o
angle and split the light coming to them
in this way, so that it can be directed to
different photon detectors.
Because most of the light detected by
a flow cytometer is scattered forward in
the direction of the incident laser beam,
this light is captured and detected by a
photodiode. Photodiodes are not particularly sensitive, and therefore they are
used to detect this forward scattered
(FSC) light. In contrast, most light detectors in flow cytometers are the more
sensitive detectors called photomultiplier
tubes (PMTs). In the most simplistic terms,
these detectors convert photon energy
into electrical energy. More specifically,
they take advantage of the photoelectric
effect and record (and amplify) electrons
that are released when photons are
absorbed. Each cell passing in front of a
laser generates a pulse of electrons within
PMTs that receive light signals. The pulse
of electrons recorded over the time it
takes for the cell to pass through the laser
is called a voltage pulse. Each pulse has a
height (H), width (W), and area (A), which
is measured, digitized, and graphed on
the plots that we have come to associate
with flow cytometry data. In Figure 2, we
illustrate the nature of the pulse gener-

ated as a cell passes vertically upward
through the laser beam.
To better understand the information
gained from a voltage pulse, consider the
simple flow cytometer system represented in Figure 3. In this setup, one laser
generates blue light (488 nm), and four
PMT’s positioned behind different sets of
filters and mirrors only allow light of specific wavelengths to pass.
Now consider a group of lymphocytes
from a mouse that have been stained with
green fluorescent antibodies specific for
CD4 (e.g., fluorescein isothiocyanate, or
FITC anti-CD4) and red fluorescent antibodies specific for CD8 (e.g., phycoerythrin, or PE anti-CD8). These are passed, in
single file, in front of the blue laser that is
focused on the flow chamber, shown in
purple in Figure 3.
A CD4⫹ T cell passes by first. Some
nonfluorescent 488 nm light from the
laser is likely to be bounced to the side,
perhaps by the nuclear material, mitochondria, or granules. This side-scattered
(SSC) light will pass through the first
dichroic mirror, which allows passage of
light of wavelengths shorter than 560 nm.
A beam splitter then sends some of this
relatively low wavelength light to the SSC
PMT, via a BP filter that is set to allow
through light of the same wavelength as
the original illuminating laser. This BP filter

The voltage pulse generated by a cell passing in front of the laser beam. As cells pass in front of the laser beam, they emit or scatter light

is labeled 488/10 in Box 20-1, Figure 3. A
voltage pulse will be generated in the SSC
PMT, as the cell passes by. The magnitude
of the voltage pulse will be recorded and
stored by the cytometer’s software.
Similarly, light scattered in a forward
direction will be detected by the photodiode placed to detect light scattered
within 5–10 degrees of the direction of
the laser, and the magnitude of the forward scatter signal will also be recorded
and stored. Not shown in Box 20-1, Figure
3 is a filter block that is placed in the path
of the laser beam that prevents any direct
light from the laser from impinging on the
FSC photodiode. Most flow cytometry
applications will require a graph or “dot
plot” of forward scatter versus side scatter
of the cell population under study. (See
Figure 20-19 for an example of a FSC versus SSC plot of a human blood cell population.) Each dot on these plots represents
a single “event,” which usually represents a
single cell passing in front of the laser
beam.

Recall that the cell that has scattered
this light is a CD4-bearing cell. Because this
CD4⫹ cell is bound by FITC-labeled antibodies that will be activated by the 488
nm laser, it will also emit green light with a
peak wavelength of approximately 525–
530 nm. This green light, which is emitted
in all directions, will be allowed to pass
through the first dichroic mirror, and then
through the BP filter in front of the green
PMT, generating another voltage pulse in
the green PMT. The shape of this pulse will
be determined by the shape of the structure that is emitting the fluorescence. For
instance, a fluorochrome that only labels
the nuclei will generate a narrower voltage
pulse than a fluorochrome that stains the
entire cell (Figure 4; compare cells b versus
a). Signals recorded from this green PMT
are referred to as emanating from the FL1
channel (Figure 3). The instrument software will integrate the information provided for each cell as it passes through the
laser beam, so that all of the information
pertaining to the detected fluorescence

and light-scattering properties are attributed to the correct cell.
When a CD8⫹ T cell labeled with PE
anti-CD8 passes in front of the laser, light
scattered by that cell will also generate a
voltage pulse in the SSC PMT and be
detected by the FSC photodiode. In addition, the PE fluorochrome will be excited
and emit orange light that will be reflected
by the 560 nm SP dichroic mirror (because
its wavelength is too long to pass through
the filter) and also by the 640 nm LP
dichroic mirror (because its wavelength,
this time, is too short). These mirrors
reflect the orange light directly through
the 585 nm BP filter where it is detected
by the orange PMT detector (FL2), generating a voltage pulse (see Figure 3). In
theory, the CD8⫹ T cell should not generate light that would find its way to the FL1
PMT; however, in reality, all cells emit
some photons of a variety of wavelengths
and will generate small voltage pulses in
most PMTs. This inappropriate signal must
be compensated for when conducting

A simple flow cytometry setup. Cells passing through the flow cell are interrogated by the laser and scattered and fluorescent light is directed
through the series of mirrors and filters to the appropriate PMTs. There, the induced voltages are digitized and represented by the software in graphical form.
Since each parameter of light scatter or fluorescence is recorded for each cell detected, results can be displayed that include any combination of parameters
for the cell population being studied. A variety of display styles are available depending on the graphing software used by the investigator. (See text for
further details.) [http://ars.els-cdn.com/content/image/1-s2.0-S0167779911001958-gr1.jpg]

Flow cytometers can also detect fluorescence emissions
from cells that have been permeabilized with detergent,
which allows antibodies to enter the cells and stain intracellular components. This “intracellular staining” approach is
used, for example, when analyzing cells for their ability to
synthesize and release particular cytokines, as well as in cell
cycle analysis and in detecting activities of enzymes for
which fluorescent products are available (see below). In
many medical centers, the flow cytometer is used to detect
leukemias and classify them by cell type, which in turn

influences decisions regarding future treatment. Likewise,
the rapid measurement of T-cell subpopulations, an important prognostic indicator in AIDS, is routinely done by flow
cytometric analysis. HIV infects and destroys CD4-bearing
T cells. In order to monitor the clinical stage of the disease,
labeled mAbs against CD4- and CD8-bearing T cells are
used to determine their ratios in the patient’s blood, as
shown in Figure 20-19b. When the number of CD4 T cells
falls below a certain level, the patient is at high risk for
opportunistic infections.

flow cytometric experiments; different
instrument models perform this compensation in different ways.
Finally, consider a CD4⫹ T cell and a
CD8⫹ T cell that are stuck together—that
is, a doublet. When these pass through the
laser, they will be considered one unit, and
will scatter light, emit fluorescence, and
generate voltage pulses in all three SSC,
FL1, and FL2 PMTs as well as the FSC photodiode detector. This could lead an inves-

tigator to inaccurately assume that this is a
single cell that expresses both CD4 and
CD8. However, because the cell doublet is
bigger, its voltage pulse will last longer
and its width will be disproportionately
large (Figure 4; consider cells A versus C).
Fortunately, software programs allow
investigators to remove from analysis cells
that generate too wide a voltage pulse.
Each cell (or event) passing by a laser
generates multiple voltage pulses at

Magnetic Activated Cell Sorting
Fluorescence is not the only type of marker that immunologists can use to separate cells. A fine wool mesh made
of ferromagnetic metal can be localized in a short column.
Application of a magnetic field across the column will
ensure that any magnetized material will stick to the mesh.
By conjugating antibodies to magnetic beads or molecules,
allowing the antibodies to bind to their antigens on the
surface of particular cells, and then passing the cells

each PMT. In newer flow cytometers, the
height, width, and area of each voltage
pulse will be recorded and digitized. In
older machines, only the height was
routinely recorded. Investigators can
choose to plot any of these measurements (e.g., FL1-H, SSC-W, FL2-A),
although area (which provides information about the total light detected over
the time the cell passes) is probably the
most informative.

through the column, those cells that bound to the magnetic
beads can be held onto the mesh in the column, whereas
those that did not bind the antibodies flow through. After
washing off any nonspecifically bound cells with a stream
of buffer, the magnetic bead-conjugated cells can then be
released by removing the magnet from the outside of the
column and passing buffer through. Magnetic cell separation is particularly useful for batch separation of large
numbers of cells, whereas fluorescence-activated cell sorting, by sorting one cell at a time, makes fewer mistakes but

is much slower. In the laboratory or the clinic, immunologists will often perform a batch sort using magnetic activated cell sorting, and then follow it up with a
fluorescence-activated cell sort, in order to maximize the
accuracy of cell separation.

Cell Cycle Analysis
Following activation, one of the first responses of lymphocytes is to divide. Immunologists have therefore been at
the forefront of developing methodologies for cell cycle
analysis. We will describe several methods (classical as
well as more modern) that are commonly used by immunologists in analyzing the cell cycle status of populations
of immune cells.

FIGURE 20-20 Bromodeoxyuridine incorporates into
DNA in place of deoxythymidine during DNA synthesis. Bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) is a thymidine analog, as the large bromine
group serves to mimic the size and shape of the methyl group of
thymidine. It is incorporated into DNA instead of thymidine and can
be detected by anti-BrdU antibodies. [http://openwetware.org/images/

Tritiated ( H) Thymidine Uptake Was One of
the First Methods Used to Assess Cell Division
3

H thymidine uptake assays were the first to be used routinely to measure cell division in lymphocyte cultures. They
rely on the fact that dividing cells synthesize DNA at a rapid
pace, and radioactive thymidine in the culture fluid will
therefore be quickly incorporated into high molecular
weight DNA. In a 3H thymidine uptake assay, cells subjected
to proliferative signals are lysed at defined periods poststimulation and their DNA is precipitated onto filters that
bind to the high-molecular-weight nucleic acids, but allow
unincorporated thymidine to wash straight through. The
amount of radioactivity retained on the filters can then
provide a measure of the amount of newly synthesized
DNA and hence the number of cells undergoing division in
the culture.

Colorimetric Assays for Cell Division Are Rapid
and Eliminate the Use of Radioactive Isotopes
Motivated by reasons of safety and environmental responsibility to move away from the use of radioactivity-based
measurements, scientists developed a number of different
assays in which metabolically active cells cleave colorless
substrates into colored, often insoluble products that can
then be measured spectrophotometrically. In one such
assay, the tetrazolium compound MTT (3-(4,5-Dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide, a yellow
tetrazole) is reduced by metabolically active cells to form
insoluble, purple formazan dye crystals. The absorbance of
each cell sample can then be read directly in the culture
wells at 570 nm, the absorbance peak of formazan. The
more metabolically active cells that are present in the culture, the more formazan will be generated, and so this assay
provides a readout of the number of live cells as a function
of time. In this way, the MTT assay can measure cell proliferation or cell death.

Bromodeoxyuridine-Based Assays for Cell
Division Use Antibodies to Detect Newly
Synthesized DNA
When introduced into cells, bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) is
rapidly phosphorylated to bromodeoxyuridyl triphosphate (an
analogue for deoxythymidine triphosphate) and is incorporated
in its place into newly synthesized DNA (Figure 20-20). Cells
that divide following BrdU incorporation can then be identified using antibodies to BrdU. In addition to serving as a label
for newly divided cells, BrdU can also mark cells for lightinduced cell death. If cells that have incorporated a high level
of BrdU are exposed to light, they will photolyse; this has been
used to selectively kill newly dividing cells. In recent years,
other chemical analogues that mimic BrdU’s functions as a
marker of dividing cells have been generated, including EdU,
which can be detected using specific reagents.

Propidium Iodide Enables Analysis of the Cell
Cycle Status of Cell Populations
Propidium iodide is a fluorescent dye with a flat, planar structure that slides between the rungs of (or intercalates into) the
DNA ladder in a quantitative manner (Figure 20-21a). By
using the flow cytometer to measure the fluorescence from a
population of propidium iodide-labeled cells, we can identify
which cells within the populations are at each stage of the cell
cycle. G1 cells will have half the DNA of G2 cells, or cells
about to undergo mitosis, and cells that are currently replicating DNA and are therefore in S phase will have an intermediate value. Apoptotic cells and fragments that have begun to
break down their DNA will appear as events with less than
G1 amounts of DNA (Figure 20-21b). Doublet cells must first
be excluded from analysis because they have the same
amount of DNA per doublet as a cell in the G2 or M phase of
the cell cycle; failure to exclude doublets will therefore result
in an overestimate of the fraction of dividing cells.

In order to make the most accurate measurements of the
amount of dye taken up by cells, investigators routinely use
the flow cytometer’s ability to compute the area under the
voltage pulse on the Fl2 channel (Advances Box 20-1). Other
dyes that bind to DNA and allow for similar types of cell
cycle analysis include DAPI, Hoechst 33342, and 7-aminoactinomycin D (AAD).

Carboxyfluorescein Succinimidyl Ester Can Be
Used to Follow Cell Division
Carboxyfluorescein succinimidyl ester (CFSE) is more correctly named carboxyfluorescein diacetate succinimidyl ester
(CFDASE). The diacetyl groups, seen at the top right and left
of the molecule shown in Figure 20-22a, enable the CFDASE
to enter the cell, and are then cleaved by intracellular esterases, so that the CFSE remains trapped within the cytoplasm. In the cytoplasm, molecules of CFSE are efficiently
and covalently attached to intracytoplasmic proteins, with
the succinimidyl ester acting as a leaving group. Somewhat
surprisingly, attachment of CFSE to intracytoplasmic proteins occurs with essentially no deleterious effects on cellular
metabolism or cell division.
The power of CFSE labeling lies in the fact that the
amount of fluorescence emitted is cut in half each time the
cell divides. This is illustrated in Figure 20-22b. The righthand peak represents those cells that did not divide after
CFSE incorporation. The peak to its immediate left represents cells that have divided once, the next one to the left
represents cells that have divided twice, and so on. One can
use the sorting capacity of the flow cytometer to physically

separate those cells that have not divided, or have divided
once, twice, or more times, and then analyze the separate cell
populations for the expression of particular genes. In the
example shown in Figure 20-22c, we see that the gene encoding the protein survivin is expressed hardly at all in nondividing T cells, but that it is expressed immediately on T-cell
activation. By the time the cell has divided three times, the
cells express two isoforms of the gene.

Assays of Cell Death
At the close of an immune response, most of the activated
immune cells die. Furthermore, the outcome of many
immune responses is the death of infected or affected cells,
and so immunologists have developed a battery of methodologies to test for cell death.

The 51Cr Release Assay Was the First Assay
Used to Measure Cell Death
The 51Cr release assay was the method of choice for measuring
cytotoxic T cell- and natural killer cell-mediated killing for
decades and was used in the experiments performed by
Doherty and Zinkernagel that first described MHC restriction
in T cell recognition. Target cells are first incubated in a solution of sodium 51chromate, which is taken up into the cells.
Excess chromium is washed out of the cell suspension and the
radioactively labeled targets are mixed with the killer cell population at defined effector to target cell ratios. Death of the target
cells is indicated by the release of 51Cr into the supernatant of

how many times they have divided post addition of CFSE and tested for gene expression. In this example, the gene for the protein survivin is
not expressed in nondividing T cells, but is expressed following stimulation with anti-CD3 and anti-CD28. After three cell divisions, the expression is up-regulated and two mRNA species (representing the RNA encoding two isoforms of the protein) are evident. [(a) http://probes.invitrogen.

the mixed cell culture, and is quantified by comparing the 51Cr
release from the test cells with that from detergent treated and
control cells. 51Cr is a ␥-emitting radioactive isotope, and the
radioactivity in the assay supernatants can therefore be readily
measured in a ␥ counter. A modern alternative to this technique uses CFSE to label the cells and quantifies the release of
fluorescent material into the supernatant with a fluorescent
plate reader. These two assays measure all forms of cell death.

Fluorescently Labeled Annexin V Measures
Phosphatidyl Serine in the Outer Lipid
Envelope of Apoptotic Cells
In cells undergoing apoptosis (programmed cell death), but
not other modes of cell death, the membrane phospholipid

phosphatidyl serine flips from the interior to the exterior side
of the plasma membrane phospholipid bilayer. Annexin V is
a protein that binds to phosphatidyl serine in a calciumdependent manner; fluorescently labeled Annexin V can
therefore be used to tag apoptotic cells for detection using
flow cytometry or a fluorescent plate reader.

The TUNEL Assay Measures Apoptotically
Generated DNA Fragmentation
Another common method for the detection of apoptotic cell
death uses the fact that apoptotic cells undergo a process of
progressive DNA degradation, which results in the generation
of short DNA fragments within the nucleus. The TUNEL assay
relies on the use of the enzyme terminal deoxyribonucleotidyl

this enzyme’s activity) to add bases onto the broken ends of
DNA sequences in a nontemplated manner. The classic variation of the TUNEL method uses TdT to add BrdU to fixed
and permeabilized cells. BrdU is incorporated into the newly
synthesized DNA, and is then detected with fluorescently

iterations of this method use the incorporation of short DNA

fluorescent tag under very gentle conditions.

panoply of biochemical and genetic tools. Such an investigation usually begins when a scientist determines that interaction of a particular ligand and receptor has a certain
outcome—for example, the activation of transcription of a
particular gene. The question then becomes what are the
intervening molecules that pass the signal from a receptor to
the nucleus and result in the activation of transcription?

Caspase Assays Measure the Activity of
Enzymes Involved in Apoptosis

Certain families of enzymes (e.g., tyrosine kinases, serine/
threonine kinases, caspases, and ubiquitinases) transduce
molecular signals in a number of different pathways. Other
pathways require the integrity of intracellular organelles,
such as lysosomes. Commercially available chemical inhibitors have been developed for many enzyme families implicated in signal transduction, as well as for individual
members of many of these families. Simultaneous application of an inhibitor with the signaling molecule can provide
rapid information about whether the inhibited protein is
implicated in the pathway under study, and inhibitor studies
often prove a valuable way to start examining a new problem
and gain some quick results. Chemical inhibitors that affect
the functioning of intracellular compartments also exist, and
their use allows an investigator to determine whether the
pathway under investigation involves that compartment.
However, in using inhibitors to characterize a pathway,
one must always be circumspect, as their specificity is not
always fully characterized, and the signal transduction inhibition that is measured may not result from the inhibition of
the protein that the manufacturer specified or the investigator believes is being studied. For example, inhibitors initially

The caspases are a family of cysteine proteases that cleave
proteins after aspartic acid residues. Different members of
the caspase family are activated during apoptotic cascades,
depending on their mode of initiation. For example, caspase
8 is activated upon engagement of the Fas receptor by Fas
ligand. Several different types of caspase assays are now
commercially available, including caspase detection kits that
yield fluorescent products upon caspase-mediated cleavage,
as well as kits that detect the cleaved and active forms of
caspases using Western blot methodology.

developed for the Erk1 transcription factor are now known
to also inhibit Erk5, a family member that was unknown
when the first inhibitor was developed. Furthermore, the
observed inhibition may result from interference with a
related pathway. For example, the inhibited enzyme may
prevent the production of one of the components of the
pathway under study. Because of these caveats, inhibitor
studies must always be supported with other means of analysis. Table 20-2 lists a few representative inhibitors of enzymes
and transcription factors involved in signal transduction
that students may encounter in their reading, along with
their mode of action.

Many Methods Are Used to Identify Proteins
That Interact with Molecules of Interest
As described earlier in the “Immunoprecipitation-Based
Techniques” section, co-immunoprecipitation can be used
to identify proteins that interact with a target molecule. For
example, an antibody to an adapter protein can be used to
immunoprecipitate that protein. After solubilizing the
components of the precipitate and running them out on an
SDS-PAGE gel, other bands may become visible which represent proteins that were interacting with the adapter protein
in the intact cell. Sometimes, inspection of the molecular
weight of the co-precipitating proteins, along with information about other proteins known to interact with that
adapter, allows the investigator to develop a hypothesis
about the identity of the co-precipitating molecule, which
can then be confirmed with a Western blot. On other occasions, the investigator must subject a sample of the mystery
band to microsequencing and identify it using the tools of
bioinformatics. If Western blots fail to identify interacting

proteins, techniques such as yeast two-hybrid screens can be
used, but description of those methods are beyond the scope
of this chapter.

Whole Animal Experimental Systems
Many whole animal systems have been used in the study of
immunology. The species of animal selected for study is the
one that best meets the needs of the particular investigation.
To test the effectiveness of particular vaccines against viruses
or bacteria that affect only primates, primate animal models
must be used. Studies of horses, goats, sheep, dogs, and rabbits have also yielded much information about immune
responses and have provided us with numerous reagents for
the study of human and mouse immunology. However, the
species that has been used most frequently and with the
greatest effectiveness in modeling the human immune system is the mouse. Mice are easy to handle, are genetically
well characterized, and have a rapid breeding cycle. In this
section, we will outline various types of murine animal models and clarify some of the more confusing nomenclature
that students are likely to encounter as they read in the
immunological literature. We will first briefly address the
ethical questions that must and should arise in the minds of
those who work with whole animals and the regulations that
have been developed to protect nonhuman research subjects.

Animal Research Is Subject to Federal
Guidelines That Protect Nonhuman
Research Subjects
Our understanding of the immune response owes a great deal
to animals, and huge advances have been made using a variety
of animal models. Concerns about animal welfare, however,
have accompanied these advances and have led many countries to adopt laws that regulate animal use on ethical grounds.
In the United States, institutions and investigators that perform research on animals must comply with the Animal Welfare Act of 1966. Those researchers that receive federal funds
must establish an Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) that oversees the practices of researchers and
programs. All investigators must detail and justify their
approaches before this committee and compliance is enforced
by the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA).
Standards for the ethical treatment of animals are continually evaluated and updated as our awareness of animal biology, alternative technologies, and ethical concerns develop.
Since it was signed into law, the Animal Welfare Act has been
amended seven times in order to reflect these advances. In
2010, the European Union passed a law that updated and
strengthened standards outlined in its 1986 animal welfare
laws. In response to concerns that animal research was poorly
described in the literature, the influential journal Nature
established new policies in 2012 that require authors to include
more detailed descriptions of approaches and standards

Experimental Systems and Methods
associated with animal experimentation. Finally, a growing
number of investigators have formally embraced the Three
R’s principles originally articulated in 1954 by Hume and
described fully by Russell and Burch. These describe a commitment to refine, reduce and replace approaches that use
animals in research. These principles were communicated to
scientists first by a committee that included the Nobelist and
immunologist Peter Medawar, and have been the focus of
several prominent conferences in recent years.
Many individuals and groups feel that regulations still do
not fully address or respect the needs of animals. Tension
between ethical concerns and the desire to advance knowledge continues; although it inspires conflict at times, it also
inspires continuing efforts to refine and improve policies.

Inbred Strains Can Reduce
Experimental Variation

the genetic backgrounds of experimental animals, immu-

nologists often work with inbred strains of mice produced by
20 or more generations of brother-sister mating. The rapid
breeding cycle of mice makes them particularly well suited
for the production of inbred strains in which the heterozygosity of alleles that is normally found in randomly outbred
mice is replaced by homozygosity at all loci. Repeated
inbreeding for 20 generations yields an inbred strain whose
progeny are homozygous and identical (syngeneic) at more
than 99% of all loci. Approximately 500 different inbred
strains of mice are available, each designated by a series of
letters and/or numbers (Table 20-3), and most of these
strains are commercially available. Inbred strains have also
been produced in rats, guinea pigs, hamsters, rabbits, and
domestic fowl.
Recombinant inbred strains of mice are those in which
two inbred strains (e.g., strains A and B) have been mated,
resulting in a recombination within an interesting locus
(e.g., within the MHC locus). Subsequent inbreeding of the
animals with this recombination results in an inbred strain
of mice bearing part of its MHC from strain A and the other

Experimental Methods

from MHC B. Animals from this strain can then be used to
determine which subregions of a locus contribute to which
properties in the immune system of the animal. Such strains
were used to delineate the functions of class 1 versus class 2
proteins encoded by the MHC locus.

Congenic Resistant Strains Are Used
to Study the Effects of Particular Gene
Loci on Immune Responses
Two strains of mice are congenic if they are genetically identical except at a single genetic locus or region. Any phenotypic differences that can be detected between congenic
strains must therefore be encoded in the genetic region that
differs between the two strains. Congenic strains that are
identical with each other except at the MHC can be produced by taking F1 (first filial generation) mice derived from
the mating of two strains (e.g., A and B), interbreeding them,
and then selecting those F2s (second-generation mice) that
reject a tumor from one of the strains (e.g., strain A). These
mice must be homozygous for the strain B MHC, since if
they were heterozygous for A and B at the MHC locus, they
would accept the tumor and die. At this point, 50% of their
overall genetic material derives from strain B. However,
within that 50% is included both MHC alleles.
Next, these mice are backcrossed to strain A, and the
process of intercrossing the progeny and testing for those
animals which reject the strain A tumor is repeated. At each
backcross generation, the fraction of the background (nonMHC) genes that are derived from strain B is cut in half, but
only those mice homozygous for strain B MHC are retained.
Between 15 and 20 rounds of these crosses lead to a new
mouse strain that is strain A in all but its MHC, which is
wholly derived from strain B. Such mice are termed A.B
mice.

Adoptive Transfer Experiments Allow In Vivo
Examination of Isolated Cell Populations
Lymphocyte subpopulations isolated from one animal can
be injected into another animal of the same strain without
eliciting a rejection reaction. This type of experimental system permitted immunologists to demonstrate for the first
time that lymphocytes from an antigen-primed animal
could transfer immunity to an unprimed syngeneic recipient. Adoptive transfer experiments using sorted lymphocyte
subpopulations also proved the need for both T and B cells
in the generation of an antibody response.
Adoptive transfer systems permit the in vivo examination
of the functions of in vitro isolated cell populations. More
sophisticated adoptive transfer models involve the transfer
of cells between animals that differ in an allotypic marker
that does not elicit a rejection reaction, but does enable the
investigator to follow the fate of the injected cells using an
antibody against that marker. Another commonly used

adoptive transfer protocol involves the transfer of cells that
have been fluorescently labeled into a recipient animal so
that their fate can be followed using in vivo imaging technologies.
In some adoptive transfer protocols, it is important to
eliminate the immune responsiveness of the host by exposing it to x-rays that kill host lymphocytes, prior to donor
cell injection. If the host’s hematopoietic cells might influence an adoptive transfer experiment, then high x-ray levels (900–1000 rads) are used to eliminate the entire
hematopoietic system. Mice irradiated with such doses will
die unless reconstituted with bone marrow from a syngeneic donor.

Transgenic Animals Carry Genes That Have
Been Artificially Introduced
Development of techniques to introduce cloned foreign
genes (transgenes) into mouse embryos has permitted
immunologists to study the effects of many isolated genes on
the immune response in vivo. If the introduced gene integrates stably into the germ-line cells, it will be transmitted to
the offspring.
The first step in producing transgenic mice is the injection of foreign cloned DNA into a fertilized egg. In this
technically demanding process, fertilized mouse eggs are
held under suction at the end of a pipette and the transgene
is microinjected into one of the pronuclei with a fine needle.
In some fraction of the injected cells, the transgene integrates into the chromosomal DNA of the pronucleus and is
passed on to the daughter cells of eggs that survive the process. The eggs, or early embryos, are then implanted in the
oviduct of “pseudopregnant” females, and transgenic pups
are born after 19 or 20 days of gestation (Figure 20-24).
With transgenic mice, immunologists have been able to
study the expression patterns and functions of a large
number of transgenes within the context of living animals.
By constructing a transgene with a particular promoter,
researchers can also artificially control the expression of
the transgene. For example, the expression of genes controlled by the metallothionein promoter is activated by
zinc, and transgenic mice carrying a transgene linked to a
metallothionein promoter will express the transgene only
when zinc is added to their water supply. Other promoters
are functional only in certain tissues; the insulin promoter,
for instance, promotes transcription only in pancreatic
cells.
If a transgene is integrated into the chromosomal DNA
within the one-cell mouse embryo, it will be integrated into
both somatic cells and germ-line cells. The resulting transgenic mice thus can transmit the transgene to their offspring
as a Mendelian trait. In this way, it has been possible to produce lines of transgenic mice in which every member of a
line contains the same transgene. A variety of such transgenic lines are currently available commercially, or via collaborations with the producing labs.

Knock-in and Knockout Technologies Replace
an Endogenous with a Nonfunctional or
Engineered Gene Copy
One limitation of transgenic mice that are generated as
described above is that the transgene is integrated randomly
within the genome. This means that some transgenes insert
in regions of DNA that are not transcriptionally active, and
hence the genes are not expressed, whereas others may disrupt vital genes. To circumvent this limitation, researchers
have developed the technology to target the desired gene to
specific sites within the germ line of an animal, using homologous DNA recombination. This technique can be used to
replace the endogenous gene with a truncated, mutated, or
otherwise altered form of that gene, or alternatively to completely replace the endogenous gene with a DNA sequence of
choice. For example, a nonfunctional form of a gene may be
used to replace the normal allele, in order to determine the
effects of losing the expression of the gene in the intact animal. Alternatively, knock-in technology may be used to

(obtained by mating normal females with a sterile male). The transgene will be incorporated into the chromosomal DNA of about 10%
to 30% of the offspring and will be expressed in all of their somatic
cells. If a tissue-specific promoter is linked to a transgene, then tissuespecific expression of the transgene will result.

determine when and where the promoter for a particular
gene is activated. In this latter case, a gene for a fluorescent
protein, such as green fluorescent protein, can be specifically
engineered into a site downstream from the promoter of the
gene of interest. Every time that promoter is activated, the
cells in which the promoter is turned on will glow green.
How might this be accomplished?
We will describe one method for the generation of
knockout mice using homologous DNA recombination.
The same principles apply to the generation of knock-in
mice, which would simply use different gene segments
bounded by the homologous stretches of DNA. Production of gene-targeted knockout mice involves the following steps:
• Isolation and culture of embryonic stem (ES) cells from
the inner cell mass of a mouse blastocyst
• Generation of the desired, altered form of the gene,
bounded by sufficient DNA sequence from the native
gene to facilitate homologous recombination

Experimental Methods

• Introduction of the desired gene into the cultured ES
cells and selection of homologous recombinant cells in
which the gene of interest has been incorporated. Sensitive polymerase chain reaction (PCR) techniques can be
used to determine which ES cell colonies have incorporated the desired gene into the correct location.
• Injection of homologous recombinant ES cells into a
recipient mouse blastocyst and surgical implantation of
the blastocyst into a pseudopregnant mouse
• Mating of chimeric offspring heterozygous for the disrupted gene to produce homozygous knockout mice
The ES cells used in this procedure are obtained by culturing the inner cell mass of a mouse blastocyst in the presence of specific growth factors and on a feeder layer of
fibroblasts. Under these conditions, the stem cells grow but
remain pluripotent. One of the advantages of ES cells is the
ease with which they can be genetically manipulated. Cloned
DNA containing a desired gene can be introduced into ES
cells in culture by various transfection techniques; the introduced DNA will be inserted by recombination into the chromosomal DNA of a small fraction of these.
In one model of generating knockout mice, the insertion
constructs introduced into ES cells contain three genes: the
target gene of interest and two selection genes, such as neoR,

(a) Formation of recombinant ES cells
neo R

which confers neomycin resistance, and the thymidine kinase
gene from herpes simplex virus (tkHSV), which confers sensitivity to gancyclovir, a cytotoxic nucleotide analogue (Figure
20-25a). The construct in this example is engineered with the
target gene sequence disrupted by the neoR gene and with the
tkHSV gene at one end, beyond the sequence of the target gene.
Most constructs will insert at random by nonhomologous
recombination rather than by gene-targeted insertion through
homologous recombination. As shown in Figure 20-25a, those
cells in which the construct inserts at random retain expression
of the tkHSV gene, whereas those cells in which the construct
inserts by homologous recombination lose the tkHSV gene and
hence the sensitivity to gancyclovir. As illustrated in Figure
20-25b, a two-step selection scheme is used to obtain those ES
cells that have undergone homologous recombination, whereby
the disrupted gene replaces the target gene. The desired cells
are resistant to both gancyclovir and neomycin. Other selection schemes exist, and individual scientists choose the one
that best suits their needs, but this example protocol illustrates
some of the general principles involved in generating and
selecting those cells with the desired genetic alteration.
ES cells obtained by this procedure will be heterozygous for
the knockout mutation in the target gene. These cells are clonally expanded in cell culture and injected into a mouse blastocyst, which is then implanted into a pseudopregnant female.

than homologous recombination. (b) Selection with the neomycinlike drug G418 will kill any nonrecombinant ES cells because they

will survive this selection scheme. [Adapted from H. Lodish et al., 1995,

Experimental Systems and Methods
The transgenic offspring that develop are chimeric, composed
of cells derived from the genetically altered ES cells and cells
derived from normal cells of the host blastocyst. When the
germ-line cells are derived from the genetically altered ES
cells, the genetic alteration can be passed on to the offspring.
If the recombinant ES cells are homozygous for black coat
color (or another visible marker) and they are injected into a
blastocyst homozygous for white coat color, then the chimeric
progeny that carry the heterozygous knockout mutation in
their germ line can be easily identified (Figure 20-26). When
these are mated with each other, some of the offspring will be
homozygous for the knockout mutation.

The Cre/lox System Enables Inducible Gene
Deletion in Selected Tissues

enables investigators to determine the effects of losing gene
activity only in, for example, the tissues of the immune system, even if expression of those genes in other tissues is necessary for viability of the organism. These technologies rely on
the use of site-specific recombinases from bacteria or yeast.
The most commonly used recombinase is Cre, isolated
from bacteriophage P1. Cre recognizes a specific 34-bp site in
DNA known as loxP and catalyzes a recombination event
between two loxP sites such that the DNA between the two
sites is deleted. Animals that ubiquitously express Cre recombinase will therefore delete all loxP-flanked sequences,
whereas animals that express Cre only in certain tissues will
only delete loxP-flanked sequences in those tissues. If the
expression of the Cre recombinase gene is placed under the
control of a tissue-specific promoter, then tissue-specific
deletion of any DNA that is flanked by loxP sites will occur.
For example, one could express Cre in B cells using the
immunoglobulin promoter, and this would result in the targeted deletion of loxP-flanked DNA sequences only in B cells.

Experimental Methods

This technology is particularly useful when the targeted
deletion of a particular gene in the whole animal would have
lethal consequences. For example, the DNA polymerase ␤
gene is required for embryonic development, and deletion of
this gene in the whole animal would therefore result in embryonic lethality. In experiments designed to delete the DNA
polymerase ␤ gene only in thymic tissues, scientists flanked
the mouse DNA polymerase ␤ gene with loxP and mated
these mice with mice carrying a Cre transgene under the control of a T-cell promoter (Figure 20-27). The results of this
mating are offspring that express the Cre recombinase specifically in T cells, allowing scientists to examine the effects of
specifically deleting the enzyme DNA polymerase ␤ in T cells.
The Cre/lox system can also be used to turn on gene
expression in a particular tissue. Just as the lack of a particular gene may be lethal during embryonic development, the
expression of a gene can be toxic. To examine tissue-specific
expression of such a gene, it is possible to insert a translational stop sequence flanked by loxP into an intron at the
beginning of the gene (Figure 20-27b). Using a tissue-specific

(a)

promoter driving Cre expression, the stop sequence may be
deleted in the tissue of choice and the expression of the
potentially toxic gene examined in this tissue.
Some investigators have combined this technology with
the use of an artificial inducer of Cre activity in order to control precisely when the gene is lost. Transgenic mice have
been developed that express fusion proteins in which the Cre
recombinase is linked to a second protein—for example, an
altered estrogen receptor designed to respond to the drug
tamoxifen (Novaldex). This Cre fusion protein is designed
such that Cre is not active unless tamoxifen is present. Thus,
one can place the Cre fusion protein expression under the
control of a tissue-specific promoter, and precisely time the
knockout of the gene in that tissue by the administration of
tamoxifen. Other similar fusion proteins have been developed that allow Cre expression to come under the control of
various antibiotics. These modifications of gene-targeting
technology have been pivotal in the determination of the
effects of particular genes in cells and tissues of the immune
system.

FIGURE 20-27 Gene targeting with Cre/loxP. (a) Conditional deletion by Cre recombinase. The targeted DNA polymerase
␤ gene is modified by flanking the gene with loxP sites (for simplicity, only one allele is shown). Mice are generated from ES cells by
standard procedures. Mating of the loxP modified mice with a Cre
transgenic will generate double transgenic mice in which the loxPflanked DNA polymerase ␤ gene will be deleted in the tissue
where Cre is expressed. In this example, Cre is expressed in thymus
tissue, so that deletion of the loxP-flanked gene occurs only in the
thymus of the double transgenic. Other tissues and organs still
express the loxP-flanked gene. (b) Activation of gene expression

using Cre/lox. A loxP-flanked translational STOP cassette is inserted
between the promoter and the potentially toxic gene, and mice
are generated from ES cells using standard procedures. These mice
are mated to a transgenic line carrying the Cre gene driven by a
tissue-specific promoter. In this example, Cre is expressed in the
thymus, so that mating results in expression of the toxic gene
(blue) solely in the thymus. Using this strategy, one can determine
the effects of expression of the potentially toxic gene in a tissuespecific fashion. [Adapted from B. Sauer, 1998, Methods 14:381, with

Polyclonal antibodies are generated by immunizing an animal with an antigen (usually complexed with an adjuvant)
one or more times, and then retrieving the antiserum.
Monoclonal antibodies are generated by fusion of an
antibody-producing B cell with a long-lived B-cell tumor.
When bi- or multivalent antibodies are mixed with antigen, they can form a cross-linked matrix in solution,
resulting in the formation of an immunoprecipitate.
Immunoprecipitation can be used to purify proteins from
a detergent extract of cells or tissues.
Hemagglutination reactions measure the presence of antibodies to antigens located on red blood cells. Hemagglutination inhibition reactions measure the presence of
antibodies to those viruses that induce hemagglutination,
notably influenza.
Bacterial agglutination reactions measure the presence of
antibodies that bind specific bacterial strains.
Radioimmunoassays provide sensitive means to measure
antibody or antigen concentrations using radioactivity.
Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA) use
enzyme-conjugated antibodies to measure antigen and
antibody concentrations without the need for radioisotopes. Different enzyme and substrate systems allow adaptation of ELISA technology to increase sensitivity.
Substrates can be chromogenic, fluorogenic, or chemiluminogenic.
Biotin-conjugated antibodies can be used with streptavidinconjugated enzymes to increase the flexibility of ELISA
and other assays.
Western blotting uses antibodies to detect the presence of
particular protein bands following SDS PAGE and transfer
of bands onto a solid-phase support.
Equilibrium dialysis is an inexpensive and relatively easy
way to measure the affinity of antibody for antigens. Surface plasmon resonance measures forward and reverse
rate constants of antibody binding, in addition to association constants.
Immunocytochemistry and immunohistochemistry use
antibodies covalently conjugated to enzymes to visualize
cells and tissues. Once the antibodies are bound, substrates are added that are converted to products which
form colored precipitates that are deposited at the site of
antibody binding.
Immunoelectron microscopy uses antibodies conjugated
to gold beads in order to visualize antibody-bound structures at high resolution. Antibodies covalently conjugated
to fluorescent probes provide vivid images of structures
under the fluorescence microscope.
By using a pinhole to only allow images from a particular
depth of field, confocal microscopy enables the visualization of tissues at different focal planes. Software can then

be used to re-create a three-dimensional picture of the tissue. Two- or multi-photon microscopy provides further
resolution by requiring that two or more photons simultaneously impinge upon a fluorescent probe before emission
is possible.
Whole organs such as lymph nodes can be placed on a
warmed microscope stage while maintaining lymphatic
and blood circulation. By labeling particular cells in vivo
with particular fluorescent probes, intravital images of
ongoing immune responses can be captured.
Flow cytometry allows quantitative measurements of the
frequencies of cells binding to particular fluorescent antibodies or substrates and allows sorting of cells on the basis
of their fluorescence and light-scattering properties.
Magnetic-based cell sorting can be used to sort cells
coated with antibodies coupled to magnetic beads or molecules.
Dividing cells take up tritiated thymidine and incorporate
it into high molecular weight DNA; the radioactivity of
the DNA can be measured to provide an indicator of cell
division. The number of actively metabolizing cells in a
culture can be measured by the MTT assay.
Bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) is a thymidine analogue that
is incorporated into actively replicating DNA. Antibodies
to BrdU can be used to ascertain whether a cell divided
after the addition of BrdU to the culture.
Propidium iodide intercalates into the DNA helix in a
quantitative manner. Flow cytometric profiles of propidium iodide allow analysis of the cell cycle status of a cell
population.
Carboxyfluorescein diacetate succinimidyl ester (CFSE)
binds to the cytoplasmic proteins of cells in a quantitative
manner; its intracellular concentration is cut in half with
each cell division. CFSE fluorescence can therefore be
used to measure the number of times a cell has divided
since addition of the CFSE.
51
Cr is released from pre-labeled cells upon cell death. 51Cr
release can therefore be used to measure the extent of cell
death within the labeled population.
Fluorescently labeled Annexin V binds to phosphatidylserine exposed on the surface of cells undergoing apoptosis and can therefore be used as a measure of apoptosis in
immunofluorescence or flow cytometric experiments.
Apoptotic cells undergo DNA fragmentation. The TUNEL
assay uses terminal deoxyribonucleotidyl transferase to
add labeled nucleotides onto the DNA ends exposed on
apoptotic fragmentation. The amount of added label is a
measure of the extent of apoptosis.
Caspases are activated in apoptotic cells, and fluorescenceor Western blot-based caspase assays therefore provide a
measure of apoptosis.

Adoptive transfer techniques introduce cells taken from
one animal and transferred in various ways into a second
animal.
Transgenic animals carry genes that have been artificially
introduced. Knock-in and knockout gene technologies
enable the introduction of altered or inactive forms of genes
into specific locations in the genome. The Cre/lox recombinase system allows investigators to target altered genes into
specific locations in the genome in an inducible manner.

Q U E S T I O N S

1. When might you elect to use a polyclonal rather than a

monoclonal antibody preparation, and why?
2. You successfully used one batch of polyclonal sera to immu-

noprecipitate a protein of interest. Analysis of the precipitated protein by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis showed
a single band, indicating a pure protein. However, when you
repeated the experiment using a second batch of the serum
derived from the same animal, but at a later date, your protein precipitate was contaminated with other proteins that
did not co-precipitate the first time around. Why?
3. For the following applications, would you elect to use a

polyclonal antibody preparation, a monoclonal antibody,
or more than one monoclonal antibody to detect your
antigen? Explain your answer.
a. Bacterial agglutination
b. Immunoprecipitation
c. Western blotting
d. Detection of a cytokine using a solid-phase ELISA
e. Diagnostic tissue typing
4. The following figure illustrates a hemagglutination inhibi-

tion assay. It shows the change with time in antibody titer
of a newborn baby who survived the H1N1 influenza epidemic in 2009 in Thailand. The numbers along the bottom
of the plate represent the dilution of the sera used in the
experiment. The most concentrated serum is a 10-fold

dilution from the patient’s serum. In this experiment, sera
obtained from different times and different sources have
been serially diluted as indicated. Influenza virus and red
blood cells have then been added to each well of the plate,
and the ability of the various antisera to inhibit hemagglutination assessed.
The top row of this plate shows the hemagglutination
inhibition that occurs when a positive-control anti-influenza antibody sample is added to the combination of virus
and RBCs. It shows that the serum can be diluted out to 1
in 320 and still bind to the virus sufficiently to inhibit hemagglutination. The second row shows the hemagglutination
that occurs when the virus is added in the absence of any
neutralizing antibodies; it represents the negative control
in this experiment.
The bottom six rows represent the hemagglutination
inhibition capacity of the serum of the baby who is the
subject of the experiment. The serum diluted in rows 3 and
4 (duplicate) was drawn from the baby when she was 10
days of age. The serum diluted in rows 5 and 6 was taken
when the baby was 24 days old, and that in rows 7 and 8
when the baby was 42 days old.
a. Did the baby’s serum contain any influenza-specific

antibodies when she was 10 days old?
b. How old was the baby before her serum displayed the

same hemagglutination capacity as the positive-control
sample?
c. Can we conclude from this experiment that the baby is
making these antibodies herself?
5. Why might you elect to use an RIA rather than an ELISA

with conventional chromogenic substrates? Would an
ELISA with a chemiluminogenic substrate solve the
problem?
6. The substrates used in an ELISPOT assay differ from those

employed in a conventional ELISA assay, but may be similar to, or identical to, those used in Western blots. Why?
7. a. You have just started up your laboratory and are work-

ing on a shoestring budget until you hear about your
first grant. You need to measure the affinity of a monoclonal antibody you’re working on, and you have it
available in radioactively labeled form. What method
would you use, and why?
b. Your experiment indicates that you now need to know
the association rate of the antibody-antigen interaction.
You receive good news about your grant. How do you
proceed?

with reference to Table 20-3 and material from Chapters 3
and 4.

c. What protein domains do you expect to find on inter-

mediaries of the pathway downstream from PI3 kinase?
11. Experimental Design Question. You posit that under

conditions of infection with a particularly virulent virus,
B-1 B cells are entering inflamed regions of the lung. How
might you test this hypothesis?
12. Experimental Design Question. You wish to knock out

the expression of a particular gene, only in B cells, and you
want to do the knockout only after you have exposed your
B cells to antigen. What genetic constructs do you need to
generate for this experiment?

Appendix I: CD Antigens
The following table presents information about the nature,
cellular distribution, and function of the CD antigens, which
are the membrane molecules that have a variety of functions
and serve as markers for particular cell types. Because many
CD antigens are known by a variety of names, synonyms are
indicated in addition to the official CD designations. The
mass is listed (when known) for the CD antigens that are
proteins but not for those that are carbohydrates or lipids. In
summarizing the expression patterns for CD antigens, we
have concentrated on cells of the immune system (leukocytes). However, many of these antigens are also expressed in
other cell types, and we also give some examples of these.
The description of the functions of each CD antigen also
focuses on cells of the immune system, with an occasional
example of functions in other cell types. The function is
recorded as “not known” if there is no immunologically relevant function known for the CD marker. CD antigens are
similarly named and share many properties in humans and
mice, although there are some differences. The table presents
information for human CD antigens.
Responsibility for naming and describing CD antigens
rests with Human Cell Differentiation Molecules (HCDM)
(www.hcdm.org/Home/tabid/36/Default.aspx), an organization that runs the Human Leukocyte Differentiation Antigens (HLDA) Workshops. The mission of HCDM is to
characterize the structure, function, and distribution of leukocyte surface molecules and other molecules of the immune
system. The Web site and international workshops are the
product of a collaborative effort by numerous researchers
and biomedical supply companies around the world and are
updated regularly. The list of CD antigens was most recently
updated at HLDA9 in March 2010; the new CD antigens are

described on the HLDA Web site at www.hcdm.org/HLDA9Workshop/tabid/60/Default.aspx.
An updated list of all CD protein molecules is available
through the UniProt knowledge base at http://uniprot.org/
docs/cdlist.
This searchable database, frequently updated, is sponsored and maintained by the Swiss Institute of Bioinformatics and provides information about the structure, sequence,
cellular distribution, and functions of the proteins, as well as
genetics, with links to relevant references.
The Web sites of several biosciences supply companies
also include lists of CD antigens in both humans and mice,
with links to antibody reagents the companies sell for detecting these markers. You can find the CD antigen lists of two
of these companies at the following Web sites:
BD Biosciences: www.bdbiosciences.com/reagents/
cdmarkers/index.jsp
BioLegend, Inc.: www.biolegend.com/support
An additional source of up-to-date information is PubMed,
a Web site of the National Library of Medicine found at
www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed.
A search engine at the PubMed site allows searches of published articles by key words as well as other variables, such as
author name or year of publication. A key word search using
the name of a particular CD antigen will provide a list of the
most recent journal articles that address it. For a more comprehensive search on a particular antigen, the synonyms listed
in this table can be included as alternative key words.
This table was updated based on information in the Web
sites mentioned above, along with more recent literature
references.

Alleles Two or more alternative forms of a gene at a particular locus that
confer alternative characters. The presence of multiple alleles results in

medullary region of the thymus. Advanced to help explain differences in
the subsets of cells that undergo positive versus negative selection.

Adoptive transfer The transfer of the ability to make or participate in an
immune response by the transplantation of cells of the immune system.

Alternative pathway of complement activation A pathway of
complement activation that is initiated by spontaneous hydrolysis of the
C3 component of complement, resulting in the formation of a fluid-phase
C3 convertase enzyme. This spontaneous initiation distinguishes the
alternative pathway from the classical and lectin-mediated pathways that
are both initiated by specific antigen binding by either antibodies or lectins
respectively. However, one recently-discovered branch of the alternative
pathway may begin with Properdin binding to the surface of bacteria from
the Neisseria genus (see Figure 6-2).

Affinity constant The ratio of the forward (k1) to the reverse (k−1) rate
constant in an antibody-antigen reaction. Equivalent to the association
constant in biochemical terms (Ka  k1/k−1).

Classical pathway of complement activation That pathway of complement
activation that is initiated by antibody binding to antigen (see Figure 6-2).
CLIP A protein that binds to the groove of MHC class II as it is
assembled and carried to the cell surface. It prevents other peptides from
associating with MHC class II until it encounters endocytosed proteins,
when CLIP is digested and removed from the groove.
Clonal anergy A physiological state in which cells are unable to be
activated by antigen.
Clonal deletion The induced death of members of a clone of
lymphocytes with inappropriate receptors (e.g., those that strongly react
with self during development).
Clonal selection hypothesis This hypothesis states that antigen
interacting with a receptor on a lymphocyte induces division and
differentiation of that lymphocyte to form a clone of identical daughter
cells. All daughter cells will bear the same receptor as the stimulated cell,
and antibodies produced by B cells stimulated in this way will share the
antigen-binding site with the membrane receptor of the stimulated cell.
Following antigen elimination, representatives of the stimulated clone
remain in the host as a source of immunological memory. Those clones
of B cells that meet antigen at an immature stage of development will be
eliminated from the repertoire.

ANSWERS TO STUDY QUESTIONS
response (again, because we begin with many more cells
that have already honed their strategy).

Chapter 1
1. Jenner’s method of using cowpox infection to confer
immunity to smallpox was superior to earlier methods
because it carried a significantly reduced risk of serious
disease. The earlier method of using material from the
lesions of smallpox victims conferred immunity but at the
risk of acquiring the potentially lethal disease.

7. Consequences of mild forms of immune dysfunction
include sneezing, hives, and skin rashes caused by
allergies. Asthma and anaphylactic reactions are more
severe consequences of allergy and can result in death.
Consequences of severe immune dysfunction include
susceptibility to infection by a variety of microbial
pathogens if the dysfunction involves immunodeficiency,
or chronic debilitating diseases, such as rheumatoid
arthritis, if the dysfunction involves autoimmunity. The
most common cause of immunodeficiency is infection
with the retrovirus HIV-1, which leads to AIDS.

2. The Pasteur method for treating rabies consists of a series
of inoculations with attenuated rabies virus. This process
actively immunizes the recipient, who then mounts an
immune response against the virus to stop the progress of
infection. A simple test for active immunity would be to
look for antibodies specific to the rabies virus in the
recipient’s blood at a time after completion of treatment,
when all antibodies from a passive treatment would have
cleared from circulation. Alternatively, one could
challenge the recipient with attenuated rabies to see
whether a secondary response occurred (this treatment
may be precluded by ethical ramifications).

8. (a) True. (b) True. (c) False. Most pathogens enter the
body through mucous membranes, such as the gut or
respiratory tract. (d) True. (e) False. Both are involved in
each case. Innate immunity is deployed first during the
primary response, and adaptive immunity begins later
during that first encounter. During the secondary
response, innate and adaptive immunity are again both
involved. While innate responses are equally efficient, the
second time around adaptive immunity uses memory
cells to pick up where it left off at the end of the primary
response and is therefore quicker and more effective in
pathogen eradication during a secondary response.
(f) False. These are two different types of disorder:
autoimmunity occurs when the immune system attacks
self, and immunodeficiency is when the immune system
fails to attack nonself. The one caveat occurs in cases of
immune deficiency involving immune regulatory
components. Just like broken brakes, these can result in
an overzealous immune attack on self structures that thus
presents as autoimmunity. (g) False. The intravenous
immunoglobulin provides protection for as long as it
remains in the body (up to a few weeks), but this
individual has not mounted his or her own immune
response to the antigen and will therefore not possess any
memory cells. (h) True. (i) False. The genes for encoding
a T-cell receptor are rearranged and edited during T-cell
development in the thymus so that each mature T cell
carries a different T-cell receptor gene sequence. (j) False.
The innate immune response does not generate memory
cells (as the adaptive immune response does), so it is
equally efficient during each infection.

3. The immunized mothers would confer passive immunity
upon their offspring because the anti-streptococcal
antibodies, but not the B cells, cross the placental barrier
and are present in the babies at birth. In addition,
colostrum and milk from the mother would contain
antibodies to protect the nursing infant from infection.
4. (a) H. (b) CM. (c) B. (d) H. (e) CM.
5. The four immunologic attributes are specificity, diversity,
memory, and self/nonself recognition. Specificity refers
to the ability of certain membrane-bound molecules on a
mature lymphocyte to recognize only a single antigen (or
small number of closely related antigens). Rearrangement
of the immunoglobulin genes during lymphocyte
maturation gives rise to antigenic specificity; it also
generates a vast array of different specificities, or
diversity, among mature lymphocytes. The ability of the
immune system to respond to nonself-molecules, but
(generally) not to self-molecules, results from the
elimination during lymphocyte maturation of immature
cells that recognize self-antigens. After exposure to a
particular antigen, mature lymphocytes reactive with that
antigen proliferate, differentiate, and adapt, generating a
larger and more effective population of memory cells
with the same specificity; this expanded population can
respond more rapidly and intensely after a subsequent
exposure to the same antigen, thus displaying
immunologic memory.
6. The secondary immune response is faster (because it
starts with an expanded population of antigen-specific
cells), more effective (because the memory cells have
learned and adapted during the primary response), and
reaches higher levels of magnitude than the primary

9. Pasteur had inadvertently immunized his chickens during
the first inoculation, using an old, attenuated bacterial
strain. The old strain was no longer virulent enough to be
fatal, but it was still able to elicit an adaptive immune
response that protected the chickens from subsequent
infections with fresh, virulent bacteria of the same type.
10. Viruses live inside host cells and require the host cell’s
machinery to replicate. Fungi are extracellular and are
often kept in check by the immune system, but they can

Answers to Study Questions

be a problem for people with immune deficiencies. Fungi
are the most homogenous in form. Parasites are the most
varied in form and can range in size from single-celled,
intracellular microorganisms to large macroscopic
intestinal worms. Some parasites also go through several
life-cycle stages in their human host, altering their
antigenic structures and location so significantly between
stages that they require completely different immune
eradication strategies. Bacteria can cause intracellular or
extracellular infections, which require different immune
targeting and elimination methods. Many bacteria express
cell surface molecular markers (PAMPs) that are
recognized by receptors that are part of our innate
immune system (PRRs).
11. Herd immunity is what occurs when enough members of
a population have protective immunity to a pathogen,
either through vaccination or prior infection, that they act
as a buffer to spread and help protect those without
immunity. The efficacy of herd immunity depends on
pathogen characteristics such as how the pathogen is
transmitted (airborne, fecal/oral, etc.) and whether it can
survive for long outside the host. Herd characteristics
include how we interact with one another as a “herd” (e.g.,
crowding indoors versus sparse populations and outdoor
encounters) and the primary target population (e.g., young
children versus adults). (Other answers are also acceptable.)
12. The instructional theory stated that the antibody structure
is not determined until it is molded by antigen binding.
In contrast, the selection theory states that the antigen
receptor is first made (randomly) and then selected by
antigen binding from a diverse group of receptors with
predetermined structures.

(j) A. (k) A.
14. Tolerance means that our immune system can discern
between ourselves and foreign antigens, and does not
attack self-antigens. Lymphocytes learn tolerance by
being exposed to self-antigens during development,
when most potentially self-reactive cells are either
destroyed or inhibited from responding.
15. An antigen is anything that elicits an adaptive immune
response—most commonly a part of some foreign
protein or pathogen. An antibody is a soluble antigenspecific receptor molecule released by B cells that binds
to an antigen and labels it for destruction. One
interesting twist: antibodies can be antigens if they come
from another species and are recognized as foreign by
the host. This occurs in some instances of passive
immunization, when antibodies from an animal such as
a horse are given to humans, who then mount an
adaptive immune response against horse-specific
chemical patterns in the antibodies.
16. Pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) are germlineencoded receptors expressed in a variety of immune
cells. They are designed by evolution to recognize
molecules found on common pathogens, and they
initiate the innate immune response when they bind
these molecules. In contrast, B- and T-cell receptors are

expressed in lymphocytes, and the genes that encode
these are produced by DNA rearrangement and editing,
so that the receptor locus in each B or T cell’s genome
has a different sequence and encodes a different receptor.
B- and T-cell receptors are diverse and have the ability
to recognize a much greater assortment of antigens than
PRRs, including those never before encountered by the
immune system. B- and T-cell receptors are part of the
adaptive immune response.
17. Cytokines are soluble molecular messengers that allow
immune cells to communicate with one another.
Chemokines are a subset of cytokines that are chemotactic,
or have the ability to recruit cells to the site of infection.

Chapter 2
Research Focus Answer This is an open-ended question that
describes real observations; several answers could be
considered correct. The model you advance “simply” has
to be logical and consistent with all the data presented.
Perhaps the most straightforward possibility is the one
that turns out to be true: Notch regulates the decision of a
progenitor (the common lymphoid progenitor [CLP], in
fact) to become either a B cell or a T cell. If Notch is
active, CLPs become T cells (even in the bone marrow). If
Notch is turned off, CLPs become B cells (even in the
thymus). Other possibilities? Notch could induce
apoptosis of B cells. However, if this were the case, why
would there be more T cells in the bone marrow?
Alternatively, Notch could influence the
microenvironments that the cells develop in and, when
active, make the bone marrow niches behave like thymic
niches. When off, it could allow the thymic niche to
“revert” to a bone marrow–like environment. This would
work (even if it is a more complex scenario) and deserves
full credit as an answer.
Clinical Focus Answer
(a) This outcome is unlikely; since the donor hematopoietic
cells differentiate into T and B cells in an environment that
contains antigens characteristic of both the host and donor,
there is tolerance to cells and tissues of both. (b) This
outcome is unlikely. T cells arising from the donor HSCs
develop in the presence of the host’s cells and tissues and
are therefore immunologically tolerant of them. (c) This
outcome is unlikely for the reasons cited in (a). (d) This
outcome is a likely one because of the reasons cited in (a).
1. (a) Although T cells complete their maturation in the
thymus, not the bone marrow, mature CD4+ and
CD8 T cells will recirculate back to the bone marrow.
(b) Pluripotent hematopoietic stem cells are rare,
representing less about 0.05% of cells in the bone marrow.
(c) Hematopoietic stem cells can be mobilized from the
bone marrow and circulate in the blood, which is now
used as a source of stem cells for transplantation.
(d) Macrophages will increase both class I and class II
MHC expression after activation; however, TH cells are
CD4 and recognize antigenic peptide bound to class II
MHC. (e) Immature, not mature B cells, are associated
with osteoblasts, which help them to develop.

Answers to Study Questions
(f) Lymphoid follicles are found in all secondary
lymphoid tissues, including that associated with mucosal
tissues (MALT). (g) The follicular dendritic cell (FDC)
network guides B cells within follicles. The follicular
reticular cell (FRC) system guides T cells within the T cell
zone (although in some cases it may also help B cells to
get to follicles, so aspects of this statement are true).
(h) Infection and associated inflammation stimulates the
release of cytokines and chemokines that enhance blood
cell development (particularly to the myeloid lineage).
(i) FDC present soluble antigen on their surfaces to B cells,
not T cells. (j) Dendritic cells can arise from both myeloid
and lymphoid precursors. (k) B and T lymphocytes have
antigen specific receptors on their surface, but NK cells,
which are also lymphocytes do not. (l) B cells are
generated outside the marrow in birds and ruminants.
(m) This was true for all jawed vertebrates, but now may
even be true for jawless vertebrates; in other words, this is
now true, not false! (n) Recent data suggest that at least
one jawless vertebrate, the lamprey, has T- and B-like cells.
2. (a) Myeloid progenitor. (b) Granulocyte-monocyte
progenitor. (c) Hematopoietic stem cell. (d) Lymphoid
progenitor.
3. The primary lymphoid organs are the bone marrow
(bursa of Fabricius in birds) and the thymus. These organs
function as sites for B-cell and T-cell maturation,
respectively. The secondary lymphoid organs are the
spleen, lymph nodes, and mucosal-associated lymphoid
tissue (MALT) in various locations. MALT includes the
tonsils, appendix, and Peyer’s patches, as well as loose
collections of lymphoid cells associated with the mucous
membranes lining the respiratory, digestive, and
urogenital tracts. All these organs trap antigen and
provide sites where lymphocytes can interact with antigen
and subsequently undergo clonal expansion.
4. Stem cells are capable of self-renewal and can give rise to
more than one cell type, whereas progenitor cells have
lost the capacity for self-renewal and are committed to a
single cell lineage. Commitment of progenitor cells
depends on their acquisition of responsiveness to
particular growth factors.
5. The two primary roles of the thymus are the generation
and the selection of a repertoire of T cells that will protect
the body from infection.
6. In humans, the thymus reaches maximal size during puberty.
During the adult years, the thymus gradually atrophies.
7. The SCID mouse has no T or B lymphocytes because they
cannot rearrange their antigen specific receptors.
Injection of normal stem cells will result in restoration of
these cell types—an easily measured outcome. As HSCs
are successively enriched in a preparation, the total
number of cells that must be injected to restore these cell
populations decreases.
8. Monocytes are the blood-borne precursors of
macrophages. Monocytes have a characteristic kidneybean-shaped nucleus and limited phagocytic and
microbial killing capacity compared to macrophages.

AN-3

Macrophages are much larger than monocytes and
undergo changes in phenotype to increase phagocytosis,
antimicrobial mechanisms (oxygen dependent and
oxygen independent), and secretion of cytokines and
other immune system modulators. Tissue-specific
functions are also found in tissue macrophages.
9. The bursa of Fabricius in birds is the primary site where B
lymphocytes develop. Bursectomy would result in a lack
of circulating B cells and humoral immunity, and it would
probably be fatal.
10. (a) The spleen has been classically considered an organ
that ‘filters’ antigens from blood. The lymph node receives
antigens principally from the afferent lymphatics. (b) Both
the paracortex of the lymph node and the periarteriolar
lymphoid sheath of the spleen are rich in T cells. B cells
are found primarily in the follicles. (c) Germinal centers
are found wherever there are follicles,which are present in
all secondary lymphoid tissue, including lymph node,
spleen, and the wide variety of mucosal associated
lymphoid tissues. (d) True. (e) Afferent lymphatics are
associated with lymph nodes, not spleen. (Efferent
lymphatics can be found in both.) (f) Ikaros is required
for lymphoid development which occurs primarily in the
bone marrow (and thymus). However, lymphocytes
populate the spleen and mount an immune response
there, so the spleen would clearly be compromised in
function in the absence of Ikaros and lymphocytes.

1. (a) Cytoplasm (b) Nucleus (c) By de-phosphorylation with
the enzyme calcineurin phosphatase, activated by binding
to the calcium-calmodulin complex. Activation of the cell
results in an increase in intracytoplasmic calcium ion
concentration. (d) There are many possible answers to this
question. For example, there may be multiple forms of
NFAT, and so these drugs may just interact with particular
forms of the enzyme. Other cells may have alternative
pathways that can bypass the need for calcineurin, whereas
T cells may not. In fact, cyclosporin binds to the protein
immunophilin, which is specifically expressed in activated
T cells, and it is the complex of cyclosporin and
immunophilin that inhibits the activity of calcineurin.
2. Immunoglobulin proteins and the T-cell receptor share a
common motif: the immunoglobulin fold, which may be
the binding target for these antibodies.
3. (a) False. Receptors and ligands bind through noncovalent
interactions such as hydrogen bonds, ionic bonds,
hydrophobic interactions, and van der Waals interactions.
(b) True. Receptor-ligand binding can activate the receptor
and result in phosphorylation and receptor cross-linking.
4. (a) Reduction enabled the breakage of disulfide bonds
between the heavy and light chains and the pairs of heavy
chains in the IgG molecule. Alkylation ensured that the

bonds between the separated chains would not reform.
Scientists could then separate the chains and figure out
their molecular weight and how many chains belonged to
each molecule. (b) Papain digested the molecule in the
hinge region, releasing two antigen-binding fragments
(Fabs) and one non–antigen-binding fragment, which
spontaneously crystallized (Fc). This told investigators
that there were two antigen-binding sites per molecule
and suggested that part of the molecule was not variable
in sequence (since it was regular enough in structure to
crystallize). Pepsin isolated the divalent antigen-binding
part of the molecule from the rest. (c) Antibodies were
generated that specifically recognized the Fab and Fc
fragments. Antibodies to Fab were found to bind to both
heavy and light chains, thus indicating that the antigenbinding sites had components of both chains. Antibodies
to Fc fragments bound only to the heavy chain.
5. An ITAM is an Immunoreceptor Tyrosine-based
Activation Motif. It is a motif with a particular sequence
containing phosphorylatable tyrosines in the cytoplasmic
regions of several immunologically important proteins.
Ig and Ig are part of the signaling complex in B cells
and are phosphorylated by the Src-family kinase Lyn,
when the BCR moves into the lipid raft regions of the
membrane upon activation.
6. An adapter protein bears more than one binding site for
other proteins and serves to bring other proteins into
contact with one another without, itself, having any
enzymatic activity. Activation of the TCR results in
activation of the Src-family kinase, Lck. Lck
phosphorylates the tyrosine residues on the ITAMs of the
CD3 complex associated with the TCR. ZAP-70 then
binds to the pY residues via its SH2 regions, and is then
itself phosphorylated and activated.
7. I would expect IgM to be able to bind more molecules of
antigen than IgG, but perhaps not five times more. Steric
hindrance/conformational constraints may prevent all
10 antigen-binding sites of IgM from being able to
simultaneously bind to 10 antigenic sites.
8. Because you know that, in at least one case, activation of a
cell can result in an alteration in the phenotype of the
cytokine receptor, resulting in a dramatic increase in its
affinity for the cytokine. For example, the IL2R exists in
two forms: a moderate affinity form consisting of a 
dimer and a high-affinity form, synthesized only
following cell activation that consists of an  trimer.
9. Src-family kinases have two tyrosine sites on which they
can be phosphorylated: an inhibitory and an activatory
site. In the resting state, the inhibitory site is
phosphorylated by the kinase Csk, and the kinase folds up
on itself, forming a bond between an internal SH2 group
and the inhibitory phosphate, shielding the active site of
the enzyme. Cleavage of the phosphate group from the
inhibitory tyrosine allows the enzyme to open its
structure and reveal the active site. Further activation of
the enzyme then occurs when a second tyrosine is
phosphorylated and stabilizes the activated state.
10. Since Lck lies at the beginning of the signaling pathway
from the T-cell receptor, a T cell with an inactive form of
lck will not be able to undergo activation to secrete IL2.

11. The signaling kinase Bruton’s tyrosine kinase (Btk) is
defective in 85% of cases of X-linked agammaglobulinemia.
It is encoded on the X chromosome, and hence most
cases of this disease occur in boys. Phosphorylation by
Btk activates PLC2, which cleaves PIP2 into inositol
trisphosphate (IP3) and diacylglycerol (DAG) following
activation of pre-B cells through the pre-B-cell receptor,
or of B cells through the immunoglobulin receptor. This
leads eventually to activation of the NFAT and MAP
kinase transcription factor pathways, culminating in
B-cell differentiation and proliferation, which cannot
occur in the absence of a functioning Btk protein.
12. Both the BCR and the TCR are noncovalently associated
on their respective cell membranes with signal transduction
complexes that function to transduce the signal initiated by
antigen binding to the receptor into the interior of the cell.
In the case of the B-cell receptor, the signal transduction
complex is composed of IgIg. ITAMs on Ig/Ig are
phosphorylated by tyrosine kinases that are brought into
close proximity with the B-cell receptor complex upon the
oligomerization of the receptor and its movement into the
lipid raft regions of the membrane, which occur upon
antigen binding. The phosphorylated tyrosines of Ig/Ig
then serve as docking points for downstream components
of the signal transduction pathway. In the case of the TCR,
the signal transduction complex is the CD3 set of proteins,
which contains six chains and serves a similar function to
Ig/Ig. ΙΤΜs on CD3 are phosphorylated by Src family
kinases, particularly Lck, and then serve as docking points
for downstream components of the TCR signaling pathway.
Lck in turn is associated with the TCR co-receptors CD8
and CD4.
13. (There are multiple possibilities for this answer, and we
offer a few here).
(a) The antibody is a Y-shaped molecule with the antigenbinding regions located at the two tips of the Y. At the
junction of the three sections is a flexible hinge region that
allows the two tips to move with respect to one another
and hence to bind to antigenic determinants arranged at
varying distances from one another on a multivalent
antigen. (b) Within the variable region domains of the
heavy and light chains, a common -pleated sheet scaffold
includes multiple anti-parallel  strands in a conserved
conformation. However, at the turns between the  strands,
there are varying numbers and sequences of amino acids,
corresponding to hypervariable regions in the
immunoglobulin variable regions sequences. These enable
the creation of many different antigen-binding sites. (c) The
constant regions of antibody molecules form the bridge
between the antigen-binding region and receptors on
phagocytic cells that will engulf antigen-antibody complex,
or components of the complement system that will bind to
the Fc regions of the antibody and aid in the disposal of the
antigen. Different constant region structures bind to
different Fc receptors and complement components.
14. Src-family kinases such as Lck are located at the
beginning of many signal transduction pathways, and
their activities are subjected to rigorous control
mechanisms. Lck is maintained in an inactive state by
being phosphorylated on an inhibitory tyrosine residue.

Chapter 4
1. All four are chemical signaling molecules, which are
often, but not always, proteins. They deliver a message to
a second cell, causing physiological changes in the second,
target cell, which must bear receptors that are specific to
the signaling molecule. Growth factors are often secreted
constitutively, whereas cytokines and hormones are
secreted in response to particular stimuli and their
secretion is short lived. Most hormones are produced by
specialized glands, and their action affects a small number
of target cells. In contrast, cytokines are often produced
by, and bind to, a variety of cells. Chemokines are
specialized cytokines that provide chemotactic signals
which induce target cells to move in a particular direction
toward the cell secreting the chemokine.
2. Cells undergoing an immune response often move very
close to one another and are held together by adhesive
interactions. In this case, if, for example, the cytokinereleasing cell is a dendritic cell and the target cell is a T cell,
the two cells will be held in close apposition to one another
for several hours. In addition, the secretory apparatus of
the dendritic cell will be oriented such that the cytokines
will be secreted into the tiny space between the dendritic
cell and the T cell. The actual concentration of cytokines
experienced by the T-cell receptors at the point of contact
with the dendritic cell will therefore be orders of magnitude
higher than that in the surrounding circulation.
3. Activation of Type I and Type II cytokine receptors results in
their dimerization and subsequent phosphorylation by Janus
Activated Kinases (JAKs). These JAKs then phosphorylate
inactive, cytoplasmic transcription factors, called Signal
Transducers and Activators of Transcription, or STATs.
Once phosphorylated, the STATs dimerize, with SH2
domains in each STAT binding to a phosphorylated tyrosine
residue in its partner. This phosphorylation and dimerization
allow the STATs to assume a conformation that allows them
to dissociate from the cytokine receptor complex, enter the
nucleus, and stimulate transcription from selected genes.
4. Pleiotropy is the capacity to bring about different end
results in different cells.
Synergy is the ability of two or more cytokines affecting a
cell to bring about a response that is greater than the sum
of each of the cytokines.
Redundancy is the property that describes the fact that
more than one cytokine can bring about the same effect.
Antagonism is the tendency for two cytokines binding to
the same cell to bring about opposite effects, or to reduce/
eliminate the response to the other.
Cascade induction is the ability of a cytokine to bind to one
cell and to induce that cell to secrete additional cytokines.

5. A cytokine may induce the expression on the cell surface
of new chemokine receptors and/or new adhesion
molecules that would cause the cell to move to a new
location and, once present, to be retained there.
6. Some cytokines in this class have distinct cytokinebinding subunits, but share a signaling subunit. For
example, the dimeric receptors for IL-3 and GM-CSF have
different binding, but the same signaling, subunits. If the
cell is responding to IL-3, and all the signaling subunits
are occupied in this response, binding of GM-CSF to the
binding subunit alone would fail to transduce a signal.
Thus, although the two receptors are not competing for
binding to their respective ligands, they do compete for
signaling efficacy.
7. When a Type I interferon binds to its receptor on a virally
infected cell, the interferon signal results in the activation
of a ribonuclease that breaks down cytoplasmic RNA. It is
particularly effective against double-stranded RNA.
8. See Figure 4-14.
9. In the case of IL-1, cells secrete a protein called IL-1Ra, a
soluble form of the IL-1 receptor, which is capable of
binding to IL-1, but not of transducing an IL-1 signal. The
balance of IL-1Ra, vs the signaling receptor will determine
the amount of IL-1 able to productively interact with a
cell-surface receptor. IL-18BP serves a similar purpose in
the IL-18 system. Sometimes cells will cleave the
interleukin-binding portion of the receptor from the
surface of the cell. This has an effect similar to that
described above, in that the cleaved receptor can bind to
the cytokine, blocking its access to the productive receptor.
This occurs in the case of the IL-2R, where the IL-2binding portion of the IL-2R chain is secreted, and is
able to bind the soluble IL-2 protein.
10. (a) The IL-2R is made up of three components: , , and
. Quiescent (unactivated) T cells bear only the  dimer,
which binds IL-2, but at intermediate affinity insufficient
to result in a signal under physiological conditions. Upon
antigen stimulation, the T cell synthesizes the  subunit,
which binds to the  dimer and converts it into a highaffinity receptor capable of mediating the IL-2 signal at
physiological cytokine concentrations.
(b) See the following figure.
Populations staining with anti-IL-2Rα
antibodies labeled with phycoerythrin

This phosphorylated tyrosine is then bound by an internal
SH2 domain that holds the Lck in a closed, inert
conformation. If the DNA encoding this tyrosine residue
has been mutated or eliminated, such that this
phosphorylation cannot occur, then there will be
constitutive level of Lck activity. Since the enzyme that
phosphorylates this inhibitory tyrosine is Csk, a reduction
in Csk activity would have the same effect.

Clinical Focus Answer Children with genetic defects in
MyD88 and IRAK4 are particularly susceptible to infections
with Streptococcus pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, and
Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and children with genetic variants of
TLR4 are susceptible to Gram-negative urinary tract
infections. Children with defects in the pathways activating the
production or antiviral effects of IFNs–,  are susceptible to
herpes simplex virus encephalitis. These individuals are
thought not to be susceptible to a broader array of infectious
diseases because other innate and adaptive immune responses
provide adequate protection. The supporting evidence for the
adaptive immune response protecting against infections is that
this limited array of susceptibilities is seen primarily in
children, who become less susceptible as they get older,
presumably as they develop adaptive immunological memory
to these pathogens.

2. B. Beutler showed that lpr mice were resistant to
endotoxin (LPS) and that the genetic difference in these
mice was lack of a functional TLR4 because of a single
mutation in the TLR4 gene. R. Medzhitov and C.
Janeway demonstrated that a protein with homology to
Drosophila Toll (which turned out to be TLR4) activated
the expression of innate immunity genes when
expressed in a human cell line.
3. Inflammation is characterized by redness, heat, swelling,
pain, and sometimes loss of local function. Cytokines
made by PRR-activated resident innate cells act on the
vascular endothelium, causing vascular dilation
(producing redness and heat) and increasing
permeability, resulting in influx of fluid and swelling
(producing edema). Prostaglandins generated following
the induced expression of COX2, together with
mediators such as histamine, lead to the activation of
local pain receptors. The swelling and local tissue damage
can result in loss of function. The increased vascular
permeability allows an influx of fluid containing
protective substances, including opsonins and
complement (as well as antibodies, if present). Local
production of chemokines, together with induced
expression of adhesion molecules on vascular endothelial
cells, recruits to the site additional innate cells, such as
neutrophils and macrophages, which contribute further
to innate responses and pathogen clearance through
phagocytosis and release of antimicrobial mediators.
Proinflammatory cytokines made during this innate
response may also act systemically, triggering the acutephase response.

4. The innate immune system plays key roles in activating
and regulating adaptive immune responses. Dendritic
cells are key mediators of these roles. They bind
pathogens at epithelial layers and deliver them to
secondary lymphoid organs such as lymph nodes. After
activation/maturation induced by TLR signaling, they
present peptides from processed antigen to activate naïve
CD4 and CD8 T cells. Depending on the pathogen
and the PRRs to which it binds, dendritic cells are
activated to produce certain cytokines that differentially
induce naïve CD4 cells to differentiate into TH subsets
with different functions, usually appropriate for the
particular pathogen. Also, PAMP binding to TLRs
expressed on B and T lymphocytes can contribute to
their activation by specific antigens to generate adaptive
responses. Example of an adaptive response enhancing
innate immune responses: The cytokine IFN-, produced
by activated TH1 cells, is a potent macrophage activator,
including activating them to kill intracellular bacteria
such as M. tuberculosis.
5. A major potential disadvantage of the adaptive immune
system, with the de novo generation of diverse antigen
receptors in each individual’s B and T cells, is the possibility
of autoimmunity, which may result in disease. Adaptive
responses are also slow. Conserved PRRs that have evolved
to recognize PAMPs are less likely to generate destructive
responses to self components, and innate responses are
activated rapidly. The disadvantages of potential
autoreactivity and slow response are overwhelmed by the
advantages of having adaptive as well as innate immunity.
While the innate response is rapid and helps initiate and
regulate the adaptive response, innate immunity cannot
respond to new pathogens that may have evolved to lack
PAMPs recognized by PRRs. Also, in general (except for
NK cells) there is no immunological memory, so the innate
response cannot be primed by initial exposure to
pathogens. Given their complementary advantages and
disadvantages, both systems are essential to maintaining
the health of vertebrate animals.
Analyze the Data
a. Sepsis is a potentially dangerous systemic response to
infection (usually from septicemia—blood bacterial
infections) that includes fever, elevated heartbeat and
breathing rate, low blood pressure, and compromised
organ function due to circulatory defects. In its extreme
form sepsis can lead to circulatory and respiratory
failure, resulting in septic shock and death in many
cases. Disseminated infections activate blood cells
including monocytes and neutrophils, as well as
resident macrophages and other cells in the spleen,
liver, and other tissues, to release proinflammatory
mediators including IL-1, TNF-, and IL-6; these, in
turn, systemically activate vascular endothelial cells,
inducing their expression of cytokines, chemokines,
adhesion molecules, and clotting factors that amplify
the inflammatory response. Enzymes, ROS, and RNS
released by activated neutrophils and other cells damage
the vasculature; this damage, together with TNF-induced vasodilation and increased vascular

Answers to Study Questions
permeability, results in fluid loss into the tissues that
lowers blood pressure. TNF- also stimulates release of
clotting factors by vascular endothelial cells, resulting in
intravascular blood clotting in capillaries. These effects
on the blood vessels are particularly damaging to the
kidneys and lungs, which are highly vascularized. High
circulating TNF- and IL-1 levels also adversely affect
the heart.
b. ES-62 inhibits production of all of the tested
proinflammatory mediators following activation with
either the TLR2 or TLR4 ligands. As ES-62 binds to
TLR4 but not TLR2, the results imply that ES-62
binding inhibits pathways downstream of both TLR4
and TLR2 that activate of synthesis and secretion of
these mediators, rather than just inhibiting TLR4 itself
(such as by blocking LPS binding).
This is an example of positive feedback regulation:
activation of macrophages and neutrophils by bacterial
infection stimulates increased levels of TLR4 and TLR2
expression, presumably making the cells better able to
respond to the bacteria with protective innate and
inflammatory responses. However, increased TLR
expression might exacerbate the response in sepsis
patients and increase the chances of getting septic shock.
ES-62 treatment completely inhibits expression of
TLR4, so that the staining is the same as that of the
isotype control antibody (i.e., there is no specific
staining). In contrast, ES-62 has no effect on TLR2
expression on cells from sepsis patients.
The Western blot shows that incubation with ES-62
leads to a loss of MyD88 from cells, suggesting that
ES-62 induces MyD88 degradation.
As ES-62 induces the loss of MyD88 and of TLR4
(but not TLR2) from the cell surface, ES-62 probably
induces the degradation of both proteins. Clearly the
loss of cell surface TLR4 would eliminate activation by
the potent TLR ligand LPS. In addition, the absence of
MyD88 would prevent the activation of signaling
pathways downstream of all of the other TLRs except
TLR3 (which signals through the TRIF adaptor) and
therefore would explain ES-62’s inhibition of activation
of proinflammatory mediators by both TLR4 and TLR2
ligands shown in panel (a). Other experiments reported
in the article by Puneet et al. (2011) confirm that ES-62
does induce the intracellular degradation of TLR4 and
MyD88; ES-62 targets them to endosomes, which fuse
with lysosomes.
Given the many complex effects of excessive levels
of proinflammatory mediators on numerous organs that
are associated with septic shock, it is unlikely that ES-62
injection would cure septic shock once it is underway.
However, injections of ES-62 in sepsis patients might
reduce the total levels of proinflammatory mediators to
prevent septic shock from happening. This was
confirmed in mouse sepsis studies described in the
article by Puneet et al. (2011). Mice that had their
intestines punctured surgically developed lethal septic
shock from systemic infection with mixed intestinal
bacteria. However, treatment with ES-62 beginning 1
hour after puncture provided complete protection
against septic shock, and combined treatment with both

AN-7

ES-62 and antibiotics (commonly used in sepsis patients)
when started as late as 6 hours after puncture also gave
complete protection. As Puneet et al. (2011) conclude in
their article, treatment with ES-62 (or related compounds)
combined with antibiotics is worth exploring as an
potentially effective treatment of sepsis patients.

1. (a) True (b) True (c) True (d) True (e) False. The outer
membrane of a virus is derived from the outer membrane
of the host cell and is therefore susceptible to
complement-mediated lysis. However, some viruses have
developed mechanisms that enable them to evade
complement-mediated lysis. (f) True
2. IgM undergoes a conformational change upon binding to
antigen, which enables it to be bound by the first
component of complement C1q. In the absence of antigen
binding, the C1q binding site in the Fc region of IgM is
inaccessible.
3. (a) The initiation of the classical pathway is mediated by
the first component of complement, and C3 does not
participate until after the formation of the active C3
convertase C4aC2b. The initiation of the alternate
pathway begins with spontaneous cleavage of the C3
component, and therefore no part of the alternate
pathway can operate in the absence of C3. (b) Clearance
of immune complexes occurs only following
opsonization of complexes by C3b binding, followed by
phagocytosis or binding to the surface of erythrocytes
via CR1 binding. Therefore, immune complex clearance
is inhibited in the absence of C3. (c) Phagocytosis would
be diminished in the absence of C3b-mediated
opsonization. However, if antibodies specific for the
bacteria are present, some phagocytosis would still
occur.
4. Opsonizes pathogens, thus facilitating binding of
immune system cells via complement receptors.
Membrane attack complex (MAC) can induce lysis of
pathogens. C3a, C4a, C5a act as chemoattractants to
bring leukocytes to the site of infection. Increasing
inflammatory response at the site of infection. Binding
of C3 fragments by CD21 enhances B-cell activation by
complement-coated antigen.
5. (a) The classical pathway is initiated by immune
complexes involving IgM or IgG; the alternate pathway
is generally initiated by binding of C3b to bacterial cellwall components, and the lectin pathway is initiated by
binding of lectins (e.g., MBL to microbial cell-wall
carbohydrates). (b) The terminal reaction sequence after
the C5 convertase generation is the same for all three
pathways. The differences in the first steps are described
in part (a) above. For the classical and the lectin
pathways, the second step involves the binding of the
serine protease complexes C4b2a (classical) and MASP1,
MASP2 (lectin). These each act as a C3 convertase in
each respective pathway, and the two pathways are
identical from that point on. The alternative pathway
uses a different C3 convertase, C3bBb. The formation of

Bb requires factor D, and the C3 convertase is stabilized

C5 convertase is C3bBbC3b. (c) Healthy cells contain a

but are specifically bound by receptors on host cells.

Clinical Focus Answer (a) The two complement regulatory
proteins DAF and Protectin are both attached to plasma
membrane surfaces by glycosylphosphatidyl inositol linkages.
In paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH), a defect in
the enzyme PIG-A, which synthesizes these linkages, causes a
decreased surface expression of both of these proteins.
(b) Defects in PIG-A tend to be expressed somatically in cells
early in the hematopoietic development. A given individual
may express red blood cells that are wholly deficient, partially
deficient, or wholly competent in pig-A expression. (c) PNH
patients are essentially unable to express CD16 or CD66abce,
indicating that those antigens are also most probably attached
to the membranes using GPI linkages. Similarly, PNH patients
are unable to express CD14, so it is also probably a GPI-linked
protein. In contrast, PNH patients as well as normal control
individuals are both able to express CD64, which is therefore
most likely to be a transmembrane protein.

(c) NP: In mice, the ␬ genes rearrange before the λ genes.
Since the cell line expresses λ light chains, both ␬ alleles
must have undergone nonproductive rearrangement, thus
permitting λ-gene rearrangement to occur. (d) NP: Same
reason as given in (c) above. (e) P: Productive

encoded by this allele. (f) G: Allelic exclusion forbids
λ-chain allele 2 from undergoing either productive or

6. Random addition of N nucleotides at the D-J and V-DJ

7. Whereas N-region addition occurs at the joints of Ig heavy

the RNA associated with the polysomes to generate cDNA
probes specific for membrane receptor genes. They used
the fact that the TCR is expressed in T cells but not B cells

T cells. They hypothesized that the gene for the TCR

pattern of DNA fragments encoding the receptor genes
would be differentially arranged in different T cell clones.

heptamer-spacer-nonamer sequence directly abuts the end
of the V region (c)(1). P-region nucleotides are formed by
asymmetric cleavage of the hairpin at the coding joint prior
to DNA ligation. The italicized GA residues on the coding
strand, and the CT residues on the noncoding strand,
could have been generated by that mechanism. (c)(2). We
cannot know for certain that they were formed by
P-nucleotide addition, as they could just as easily have been
randomly inserted by TdT. (c)(3). The residues shown in
bold have no place of origin in the original sequence, and
so must have been added by N-nucleotide addition. (c)(4).
Yes, we can, if no corresponding nucleotides can be found
in the germ-line sequence, and they could not be
accounted for by asymmetric hairpin joining.
10. (a) The restriction endonuclease must cut at a site within
the constant region, as well as at sites upstream and
downstream from it. (b) Recombination has occurred at
only one of the two alleles. The germ-line bands
complementary to both the constant and the variable
region probes most probably derive from the other allele.
(c) Given that the additional bands have remained in the
same positions in the gel in both the germ-line and the
myeloma DNA, it seems likely that there was a successful
rearrangement at the first allele. (d) I would clone and
sequence the DNA upstream from the C␬ region from
both alleles and prove that one displayed a successful
arrangement, although the other was still in the germ-line
configuration.

prevent the NK cells from lysing target cells. In their absence,
self-cells are targets of autoimmune attack on skin cells,
resulting in the lesions seen in TAP-deficient patients. The use
of gene therapy to cure those affected with TAP deficiency is
complicated by the fact that class I genes are expressed in
nearly all nucleated cells. Because the class I product is cell
bound, each deficient cell must be repaired to offset the effects
of this problem. Therefore, although the replacement of the
defective gene may be theoretically possible, ascertaining
which cells can be repaired by transfection of the functional

4. (a) SJL macrophages express the following MHC
molecules: Ks, Ds, Ls, and IAs. Because of the deletion of
the IE locus, IEs is not expressed by these cells. (b) The
transfected cells would express one heterologous IE
molecule, IEks, and one homologous IE molecule,
IEkk, in addition to the molecules listed in (a).
5. See Figure 8-1, Figure 3-20, and Figure 3-19.
6. (a) The polymorphic residues are clustered in short
stretches primarily within the membrane-distal domains
of the class I and class II MHC molecules (see Figure
8-12). These regions form the peptide-binding groove of
MHC molecules. (b) MHC polymorphism is thought to
arise by gene conversion of short, nearly homologous
DNA sequences within unexpressed pseudogenes in the
MHC to functional class I or class II genes.

7. (a) The proliferation of TH cells and IL-2 production by
them is detected in assay 1, and the killing of LCMVinfected target cells by cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) is
detected in assay 2. (b) Assay 1 is a functional assay for
class II MHC molecules, and assay 2 is a functional assay
for class I molecules. (c) Class II IAk molecules are
required in assay 1, and class I Dd molecules are required
in assay 2. (d) You could transfect K cells with the IAk
gene and determine the response of the transfected cells
in assay 1. Similarly, you could transfect a separate sample
of L cells with the Dd gene and determine the response of
the transfected cells in assay 2. In each case, a positive
response would confirm the identity of the MHC
molecules required for LCMV-specific activity of the
spleen cells. As a control in each case, L cells should be
transfected with a different class I or class II MHC gene
and assayed in the appropriate assay. (e) The immunized
spleen cells express both IAk and Dd molecules. Of the
listed strains, only A.TL and (BALB/c  B10.A) F1 express
both of these MHC molecules, and thus these are the only
strains from which the spleen cells could have been
isolated.
8. It is not possible to predict. Since the peptide-binding
cleft is identical, both MHC molecules should bind the
same peptide. However, the amino acid differences
outside the cleft might prevent recognition of the second
MHC molecules by the T-cell receptor on the TC cells.
9. If RBCs expressed MHC molecules, then extensive tissue
typing would be required before a blood transfusion, and
only a few individuals would be acceptable donors for a
given individual.
10. (a) No. Although those with the A99/B276 haplotype are
at significantly increased relative risk, there is no absolute
correlation between these alleles and the disease.
(b) Nearly all of those with the disease will have the A99/
B276 haplotype, but depending on the exact gene or genes
responsible, this may not be a requirement for
development of the disease. If the gene responsible for the
disease lies between the A and B loci, then weaker
associations to A99 and B276 may be observed. If the
gene is located outside of the A and B regions and is
linked to the haplotype only by association in a founder,
then associations with other MHC genes may occur. (c) It
is not possible to know how frequently the combination
will occur relative to the frequency of the two individual
alleles; linkage disequilibrium is difficult to predict.
However, based on the data given, it may be speculated
that the linkage to a disease that is fatal in individuals
who have not reached reproductive years will have a
negative effect on the frequency of the founder haplotype.
An educated guess would be that the A99/B276
combination would be rarer than predicted on the basis of
the frequency of the A99 and B276 alleles.
11. By convention, antigen-presenting cells are defined as
those cells that can display antigenic peptides associated
with class II MHC molecules and can deliver a
costimulatory signal to CD4 TH cells. A target cell is any
cell that displays peptides associated with class I MHC
molecules to CD8 TC cells.

Answers to Study Questions
12. (a) Self-MHC restriction is the attribute of T cells that
limits their response to antigen associated with self-MHC
molecules on the membrane of antigen-presenting cells or
target cells. In general, CD4 TH cells are class II MHC
restricted, and CD8 TC cells are class I MHC restricted,
although a few exceptions to this pattern occur. (b) Antigen
processing involves the intracellular degradation of
protein antigens into peptides that associate with class I
or class II MHC molecules. (c) Endogenous antigens are
synthesized within altered self-cells (e.g., virus-infected
cells or tumor cells), are processed in the endogenous
pathway, and are presented by class I MHC molecules to
CD8 TC cells. (d) Exogenous antigens are internalized by
antigen-presenting cells, processed in the exogenous
pathway, and presented by class II MHC molecules to
CD4 TH cells. (e) Anchor residues are the key locations
(typically, positions 2/3 and 9) within an 8- to 10-aminoacid-long antigenic peptide that make direct contact with
the antigen-binding cleft of MHC class I. The specific
residues found at these locations distinguish the peptide
fragments that can bind each allelic variant of class I.
(f) An immunoproteasome is a variant of the classical
proteasome, found in all cells, and is expressed in antigenpresenting cells and in infected target cells. The presence of
this variant increases the production of antigenic fragments
optimized for binding to MHC class I molecules.
13. (a) EN: Class I molecules associate with antigenic
peptides and display them on the surface of target cells to
CD8 TC cells. (b) EX: Class II molecules associate with
exogenous antigenic peptides and display them on the
surface of APCs to CD4 TH cells. (c) EX: The invariant
chain interacts with the peptide-binding cleft of class II
MHC molecules in the rough endoplasmic reticulum
(RER), thereby preventing binding of peptides from
endogenous sources. It also assists in folding of the class
II  and  chains and in movement of class II molecules
from the RER to endocytic compartments. (d) EX:
Lysosomal hydrolases degrade exogenous antigens into
peptides; these enzymes also degrade the invariant chain
associated with class II molecules, so that the peptides
and MHC molecules can associate. (e) EN: TAP, a
transmembrane protein located in the RER membrane,
mediates transport of antigenic peptides produced in the
cytosolic pathway into the RER lumen where they can
associate with class I MHC molecules. (f) B: In the
endogenous pathway, vesicles containing peptide-class I
MHC complexes move from the RER to the Golgi
complex and then on to the cell surface. In the exogenous
pathway, vesicles containing the invariant chain associated
with class II MHC molecules move from the RER to the
Golgi and on to endocytic compartments. (g) EN:
Proteasomes are large protein complexes with peptidase
activity that degrade intracellular proteins within the
cytosol. When associated with LMP2 and LMP7, which
are encoded in the MHC region, and LMP10, which is
not MHC encoded, proteasomes preferentially generate
peptides that associate with class I MHC molecules. (h) B:
Antigen-presenting cells internalize exogenous (external)
antigens by phagocytosis or endocytosis. (i) EN: Calnexin
is a protein within the RER membrane that acts as a

AN-11

molecular chaperone, assisting in the folding and
association of newly formed class I  chains and
2-microglobulin into heterodimers. (j) EX: After
degradation of the invariant chain associated with class II
MHC molecules, a small fragment called CLIP remains
bound to the peptide-binding cleft, presumably
preventing premature peptide loading of the MHC
molecule. Eventually, CLIP is displaced by an antigenic
peptide. (k) EN: Tapasin (TAP-associated protein) brings
the transporter TAP into proximity with the class I MHC
molecule and allows the MHC molecule to acquire an
antigenic peptide (see Figure 8-18).
14. (a) Chloroquine inhibits the exogenous processing
pathway, so that the APCs cannot display peptides
derived from native lysozyme. The synthetic lysozyme
peptide will exchange with other peptides associated
with class II molecules on the APC membrane, so that
it will be displayed to the TH cells and induce their
activation. (b) Delay of chloroquine addition provides
time for native lysozyme to be degraded in the endocytic
pathway.
15. (a) Dendritic cells: constitutively express both class II
MHC molecules and costimulatory signals. B cells:
constitutively express class II molecules but must be
activated before expressing the CD80/86 costimulatory
signal. Macrophages: must be activated before expressing
either class II molecules or the CD80/86 costimulatory
signal. (b) See Table 8-4. Many nonprofessional APCs
function only during sustained inflammatory responses.
16. (a) R. (b) R. (c) NR. (d) R. (e) NR. (f) R.
17. (a) Intracellular bacteria, such as members of the
Mycobacterium family, are a major source of nonpeptide
antigens; the antigens observed in combination with CD1
are lipid and glycolipid components of the bacterial cell
wall. (b) Members of the CD1 family associate with
2-microglobulin and have structural similarity to class I
MHC molecules. They are not true MHC molecules
because they are not encoded within the MHC and are on
a different chromosome. (c) The pathway for antigen
processing taken by the CD1 molecules differs from that
taken by class I MHC molecules. A major difference is
that CD1 antigen processing is not inhibited in cells that
are deficient in TAP, whereas class I MHC molecules
cannot present antigen in TAP-deficient cells.
18. (b) The TAP1-TAP2 complex is located in the
endoplasmic reticulum.
19. The offspring must have inherited HLA-A 3, HLA-B 59,
and HLA-C 8 from the mother. Potential father 1 cannot
be the biological father because although he shares HLA
determinants with the offspring, the determinants are the
same genotype inherited from the mother. Potential father
2 could be the biological father because he expressed the
HLA genes expressed by the offspring that are not
inherited from the mother (HLA-A 43, HLA-B 54,
HLA-C 5). Potential father 3 cannot be the biological
father because although he shares HLA determinants with
the offspring the determinants are the same genes
inherited from the mother.

Answers to Study Questions

20. Considering HLA-A, HLA-B and HLA-C only, a
maximum of 6 different class I molecules are expressed in
individuals who inherit unique maternal and paternal
alleles at each loci. In the case of class II, considering only
HLA-DP, DQ, and DR molecules where any  and 
chain of each gene can pair to produce new maternal/
paternal combinations, a maximum of 12 different class II
molecules can be expressed (4 DP, 4 DQ, and 4 DR). Since
humans can inherit as many as 3 functional DR genes,
each of which is polymorphic, in practice fully
heterozygous individuals have the ability to express more
than 4 HLA-DR proteins.
21. Polygeny is defined as the presence of multiple genes in
the genome with the same or similar function. In
humans, MHC class I A, B, and C or class II DP, DQ, and
DR are both examples of this (see Figure 8-7).
Polymorphism is defined as the presence of multiple
alleles for a given gene locus within the population.
HLA-A1 versus HLA-A2 (for example, see Table 8-3) are
examples of polymorphic alleles at the class I locus.
Codominant expression is defined as the ability of an
individual to simultaneously express both the maternal
and the paternal alleles of a gene in the same cell. This
process is what allows a heterozygous individual to
express, for instance, both HLA-Cw2 and Cw4 alleles
(see Figure 8-11). Polygeny ensures that even MHC
homozygous individuals express a minimum of three
different class I and class II proteins, each with a slightly
different antigen-binding profile, expanding their
repertoire of antigens that can be presented. MHC
polymorphism and codominant expression in outbred
populations help facilitate the inheritance and expression
of different alleles at each locus, further increasing the
number of different antigens that one individual can
present. Codominant expression at the class II loci
carries an added bonus: since these proteins are generated
from two separate genes/chains, new combinations of 
and  chains can arise, further enhancing the diversity of
class II protein isoforms, or the number of unique MHC
class II antigen-binding clefts.
22. The invariant chain is involved in MHC class II folding
and peptide binding. Cells without this protein primarily
retain misfolded class II proteins in the RER and are
therefore unable to express MHC class II molecules on
the cell surface. Since APCs are the primary cell types that
express class II, cells with this mutant phenotype would
be incapable of presenting exogenously processed
antigens to naïve CD4 T cells.
23. Cross-presentation is the process by which some APCs
can divert antigens collected from extracellular sources
(exogenous pathway) to processing and presentation via
MHC class I proteins (typically the realm of the
endogenous pathway). This process is important for
activation of naïve CD8 T cells to generate CTLs capable
of detecting and lysing virally infected target cells.
Dendritic cells, or a subset of this cell type, are thought to
be the major players in this process, although “licensing”
by antigen-specific CD4 TH cells may first be required in
order for DCs to engage in cross-presentation.

Analyze the Data (a) Yes. Comparing the relative amounts
of Ld and Lq molecules without peptides, there are about
half as many open Lq molecules as Ld molecules. The
data suggest that Lq molecules form less stable peptide
complexes than Ld molecules. (b) Part (a) in the figure
shows that 4% of the Ld molecules don’t bind MCMV
peptide compared to 11% of the Ld after a W to R
mutation. Thus, there appears to be a small decrease in
peptide binding to Ld. It is interesting to note that
nonspecific peptide binding increases severalfold after
mutagenesis, based on the low amount of open-form Ld
W97R (mutated Ld) versus native Ld. (c) Part (b) in the
figure shows that 71% of the Ld molecules don’t bind
tum P91A14-22 peptide after a W to R mutation,
compared to 2% for native Ld molecules. Thus, there is
very poor binding of tum P91A14-22 peptide after a
W to R mutation. (d) You would inject a mouse that
expressed Ld because only 2% of the Ld molecules were
open forms after the addition of tum P91A14-22
peptide compared to 77% free forms when Lq were
pulsed with peptide. Therefore, Ld would present peptide
better and probably activate T cells better than Lq.
(e) Conserved anchor residues at the ends of the peptide
bind to the MHC, allowing variability at other residues
to influence which T-cell receptor engages the class I
MHC-antigen complex.

1. FoxP3 (involved in development of TREG cells), any TCR
signaling molecules (which regulate TCR signal strength
and therefore the outcome of thymic selection), MHC

T cells from getting to the medulla (e.g., CCR7), and,
finally, Nur77 and Bim, which are signaling molecules
that regulate negative selection.
2. (a) The authors appear to be saying that the MHC variant,
which would be expressed by medullary epithelial cells
and dendritic cells in the thymus, may not be able to
present (bind to) certain brain-specific self-peptides (or
does so inefficiently). Therefore, some autoreactive CD4
T cells in the thymus may not be deleted. (Note that
HLA-DR is an MHC Class II molecule.) (b) There is no
one right question. Here are two possibilities. (1) If this
were the case, wouldn’t this also mean that peripheral
dendritic cells would not be able to present the peptide,
and therefore wouldn’t activate the autoreactive T-cell
escapees? (2) If you let an autoreactive helper T cell
escape, don’t you still need an autoreactive cytotoxic T cell
to escape also? (This question depends on your knowing
that autoimmune diseases like multiple sclerosis are
caused in part by CD8 T-cell mediated damage.)
(c) Given that immunologists are still pondering the issue,
this is a challenging question. However, here are a couple
of possibilities. (1) One accepts the possibility that this is a
problem with negative selection. However, to understand
how this leads to autoimmune disease, one can propose,
for instance, that there is a difference between antigen

Negative selection to tissue-specific antigens occurs in the

3. (a) Fas-mediated signaling is important for the deathmediated regulation of lymphocyte populations in
lymphocyte homeostasis. This regulation is essential
because the immune response generates a sudden and often

Inhibition of Fas-mediated cell death could result in
progressively increasing and eventually unsustainable
lymphocyte levels. The Canale-Smith syndrome
demonstrates that without the culling of lymphocytes by
apoptosis, severe and life-threatening disease can result.
(b) Analysis of the patient T cells reveals a large number of

periphery. Presentation of brain self-peptides by this MHC
variant may be inefficient and allow autoreactive CD4
T cells to escape. But in the periphery this inefficiency can
be overcome by enhancements in costimulatory molecule
expression, levels of MHC expression, and so on among
antigen-presenting cells that have been stimulated by
pathogen or cell damage. (2) In addition (or alternatively),
one can propose that this MHC variant compromises the
development of regulatory T cells, not just the deletion of
autoreactive CD4 T cells. Specifically, if the MHC Class II
variant is unable to present the self-peptides, then it will
neither mediate deletion of autoreactive CD4 T cells nor
select for suppressive, autoreactive regulatory T cells. Note
that we need to assume, in all cases, the existence of
autoreactive CD8 T-cell escapees. This is not a radical
assumption. As you now know, negative selection in the
thymus is never perfect, and our ability to maintain
tolerance depends to a significant extent on peripheral

(c) Because the gene encoding the H-Y antigen is on the

Thymocytes bearing the transgenic T-cell receptor, which
is H-2k restricted, would undergo positive selection in
both male and female H-2k transgenics. However, subsequent negative selection would eliminate thymocytes
bearing the transgenic receptor, which is specific for H-Y
antigen, in the male H-2k transgenics. (d) Because the
H-2d transgenics would not express the appropriate
MHC molecules, T cells bearing the transgenic T-cell
receptor would not undergo positive selection.
9. (a) Class I K, D, and L molecules and class II IA

because both class I and class II MHC molecules would
be present on thymic stromal cells during positive

express no class II molecules; thus, these mice would have
only CD8 cells.
10. (a) Because the pre-T-cell receptor, which does not bind
antigen, is associated with CD3, cells expressing the preTCR as well as the antigen-binding T-cell receptor would
stain with anti-CD3. It is impossible to determine from
this result how many of the CD3-staining cells are
expressing complete T-cell receptors. The remaining cells
are even more immature thymocytes that do not express
CD3. (b) No. Because some of the CD3-staining cells
express the pre-TCR or the  TCR instead of the

TC cells, you need fluorescent anti-CD8 antibody, which

in the fetal liver and are the first B cells to populate the

the spleen.

2. T2 cells have intermediate levels of IgD, whereas T1 cells
have no to low amounts of IgD. T2 cells bear both CD21
and CD23, whereas neither antigen is expressed on T1
cells. T2 cells have higher levels of the receptor for the
B-cell survival factor BAFF than do T1 cells. Interaction
of antigen with T1 cells results in apoptosis; interaction of
antigen with T2 cells sends survival and maturation
signals.
3. Cell division at this stage allows the repertoire to
maximize its use of B cells in which a heavy chain has
been productively rearranged. Each daughter cell can then
rearrange a different set of light-chain gene segments,
giving rise to multiple B-cell clones bearing the same
heavy chain, but different light-chain genes.
4. They can undergo apoptosis, in a process called negative
selection. This occurs for B cells in the bone marrow and
for T cells in the thymus.
They can become anergic—refractory to further
stimulation—and eventually die. This occurs for both
T and B cells.
Their receptors can undergo receptor editing. This occurs
quite frequently in B cells. In T cells, the extent to which
receptor editing occurs varies according to the nature of
the animal (the nature of the transgene used to study editing), and therefore whether it is a meaningful mechanism
in T-cell receptor development and selection is so far
unclear.
5. First, knock out the ability of the animal to express that
transcription factor, and then analyze the bone marrow
for the occurrence of B-cell progenitors at each stage of
development using flow cytometry. One would not expect
to see any progenitors after the pre-pro-B-cell stage if the
transcription factor is expressed then and is necessary for
further B-cell development.
Second, make a fusion protein in which the promoter of
the transcription factor is fused to a fluorescent protein,
such as green or yellow fluorescent protein. Correlate the
expression of the fluorescent proteins with the cell-surface
markers. One would expect to see the fluorescent protein
show up first in cells bearing markers characteristic of the
pre-pro-B-cell stage.
Rearrangement has begun, with D to JH rearrangement
occurring on the heavy chain. Test it using PCR, with
primers complementary to sequences upstream of the D

to a marker fluorescent protein, such as GFP. Make slides
of bone marrow, taking care that the conditions did not

cell pairings between the CXCL12-labeled cells and
progenitor cells labeled with the markers characteristic of
the target stage of development.
7. Rearrangement starts first at the heavy-chain locus,
beginning with D to JH and proceeding with VH to D. If
the rearrangements at the first allele are not productive,

Answers to Study Questions
then rearrangement starts again on the second heavychain locus and proceeds in the same order. Successful
rearrangement at a heavy-chain locus results in the
expression of a heavy chain at the surface of the B-cell
progenitor in combination with the surrogate light chain,
to form the pre-B-cell receptor. This occurs at the
beginning of the large pre-B-cell stage. Expression of the
heavy chain at the cell-surface signals the cessation of
further heavy-chain rearrangement.
At the light-chain locus in mice, rearrangement begins at
one of the  loci, and again, if it is not productive, it starts
again on the other  locus. If this is also not productive,
the process repeats at the  loci. In humans, the process is
similar, but rearrangement may start at either the  or the
 loci. Light-chain rearrangement is completed by the end
of the small pre-B-cell stage, and the expression of the
complete Ig receptor on the surface of the cell signals the
beginning of the immature B-cell stage.
In T cells, rearrangement begins on successive  chain
loci. In possession of V, D, and J segments, the  chain
locus is analogous to the heavy-chain Ig locus. Successful
rearrangement of the  chain results in expression of a
pre-TCR on the cell surface, just as for the pre-BCR on
B cells, coupled with the cessation of further -chain gene
segment recombination. Rearrangement at the  chain
locus follows. One major difference between the processes
of rearrangement in T and B cells is that allelic exclusion
at the T-cell  chain locus is incomplete.
Analyze the Data (a) In the spleen, the Dicer knockout
animal shows no mature B cells, indicated by the loss of
the B220hiCD19 population.
In the top bone marrow population, in the absence of
Dicer, there are no sIgM-bearing B220hi cells.
The second bone marrow panel shows retention of the
progenitor cell marker, c-kit, in the Dicer knockout.
The third panel shows that in the absence of Dicer there is
a loss of CD25, a marker characteristic of the point in
development at which the pre-BCR is expressed on the
cell surface. This suggests that the cells cannot get past
this checkpoint.
(b) Since no IgM is expressed on the cell surface of the
Dicer knockout animals, miRNAs must be necessary for
progression to the pre-B-cell stage, at which IgM is first
expressed on the cell surface. The presence of c-Kit and of
low amounts of CD25 suggests that miRNAs may be
acting at the preBCR checkpoint.
Analyze the Data (a) No. The fraction of cells labeled with
Annexin V and therefore in the pre-apoptotic state is
identical in the control and Dicer knockout populations.
(b) Yes. The fraction of cells labeled with Annexin V
increases from 9.2% in the control to 65% in the Dicer
knockout (c) Pulling together the data from the last two
questions, I would hypothesize that miRNAs aid in
controlling the expression of the preBCR on the cell
surface, thereby allowing the cells to pass through the first
checkpoint in development. Cells that cannot express
preBCR die by apoptosis, and that is the process described
in the second set of slides.

Clinical and Experimental Focus Answer The data show that
LIF inhibits TH17 polarization (in its presence, the frequency
of IL-17 cells is reduced by 50% after cells are exposed to
TH17 polarization conditions). TH1 differentiation appears
unaffected (the same frequency of IFN cells are present after
treatment with TH1 polarization conditions). This suggests that
LIF has a specific effect on the pathways that induce TH17
differentiation or on those responsible for production of IL-17.
It could interfere with any of the steps involved including
(from outside to inside,) (1) signaling induced by TGF- or by
IL-6 polarizing cytokines, (2) ROR expression itself, or
(3) IL-17 expression itself. A reduction in TH17 cells could
result in less inflammation and the amelioration in disease
that is seen in this model.
(It turns out that LIF acts in opposition to IL-6 and blocks its
downstream signaler, STAT3. This abrogates the inhibitory
effect that IL-6 has on FoxP3 expression, shifting the balance
to TREG rather than TH17 lineage commitment. So, disease
amelioration is not just a consequence of fewer activated
T cells, but a result of the increase in cells that quell T-cell
responses.)
1. (a) Anergy. Signal 1 (if TCR is engaged) without
costimulatory Signal 2 because CTLA-4 Ig will block the
ability of CD28 to bind CD80/86). (b) No anergy. Signal 1
and Signal 2 are both generated. (c) Anergy. Signal 1
without Signal 2. (d) No anergy, but no activation either.
Neither Signal 1 nor Signal 2 is generated.
2. (a) Very likely. Any activated professional APC, like a
dendritic cell, up-regulates MHC molecules and
costimulatory ligands, making them ideal activators of
T cells. (b) Very unlikely. Activated dendritic cells travel to
the draining lymph nodes (or spleen) and encounter naïve
T cells there, not in peripheral tissues. Naïve T cells travel
among secondary lymphoid organs, not peripheral tissues.
However, effector T cells and some memory T cells, do
travel to peripheral tissues and can be activated by
dendritic cells there. (c) Very likely. TCR stimulation
rapidly induces Ca2 mobilization. (d) Very unlikely. The
virus induced dendritic cells to make IL-12, one of the
central polarizing cytokines for the TH1 lineage. (e) Very
unlikely. Central memory cells were certainly generated,
too.
3. A mouse without GATA-3, the master regulator for TH2
lineage commitment, will be unable to generate TH2 cells,
which are instrumental in mounting the immune response
to worm infections. TH2 cells help B cells to produce IgE,
which has potent anti-parasite activity.
4. You will need to supply Signal 1 (anti-TCR), Signal 2
(anti-CD28), and Signal 3 (IL-12). CTLA-4 Ig and
anti-CD80 both bind to the ligands for the costimulatory
receptors and would not engage your T cells.
5. (a) Dendritic cells are best at activating naïve T cells—
they express a high density of costimulatory ligands and
MHC molecules. (b) ICOS is a positive costimulatory
receptor (it is expressed on some effector T cells,
including TFH cells). (c) Most cells do not express
costimulatory ligands. Professional APCs (and thymic

6. (a) True. It stimulates production of both FoxP3 and
ROR. (b) False. IL-6 in combination with TGF-
polarizes cells to the TH17 lineage, an event that requires
ROR. IL-6 acts in part by inhibiting expression of
FoxP3.
7. Your discussion should include a recognition of the
three properties that distinguish T helper lineages: a
unique set of polarizing cytokines, a unique master
gene regulator, and a unique set of effector cytokines.
Knowing which cytokines polarize a naïve T cell to
this lineage as well as the identity of a unique master
regulator that induces TH9 lineage differentiation
would strengthen the case for placing this in a
unique T lineage category. Knowing how stable the
phenotype is would also be useful. Does it differentiate
into other subsets, or is it stable in effector function
and phenotype? This property would not preclude
TH9 from being considered a distinct lineage
(e.g., recall that TH17 and TREG cells can give rise to
other lineages) but would add complexity to your
assessment.

cells, stromal cells in tissues, innate immune cells, and

Answers to Study Questions
During SHM, the deamination of cytidine on one strand
of the DNA encoding antibody variable regions leads to
the formation of a mismatched G-U pair. The mismatch
can then be recognized by a number of DNA repair
mechanisms in the cell and resolved in one of several
different ways. The simplest mechanism is the
interpretation of the deoxyuridine as a deoxythymidine
by the DNA replication apparatus. In this case, one of the
daughter cells would have an A-T pair instead of the
original G-C pair found in the parent cell. Alternatively,
the mismatched uridine could be excised by a DNA
uridine glycosylase enzyme. Error-prone polymerases
would then fill the gap as part of the cell’s short-patch
base excision repair mechanism. Third, mismatch repair
mechanisms could be induced that result in the excision
of a longer stretch of DNA surrounding the mismatch.
The excised strand could then be repaired by error-prone
DNA polymerases, leading to a series of mutations in the
region of the original mismatch.
In the case of class switch recombination (CSR), AID
deaminates several cytidine residues in the switch (S)
regions upstream of the two heavy-chain constant regions
between which the class switch will occur (the donor and
acceptor S regions). The resulting uridine residues are
excised by uridine glycosylases, and the abasic sites are
then nicked by endonucleases that create single-strand
breaks at the abasic sites. These single-strand breaks are
converted to double-strand breaks suitable for end joining
by mismatch repair mechanisms. A constellation of
enzymes then faithfully reconnects the two S regions,
with the excision of the intervening DNA.
7. In order to survive, B cells need to receive signals from
T cells. Since there are many more antigen-specific B cells
than T cells within the germinal centers, B cells must
compete with one another for T-cell binding. Since T cells
are specific for peptide antigen displayed in the groove of
class II MHC molecules, B cells that have internalized and
displayed more antigen will have a selective advantage in
attracting T-cell attention. B cells with higher-affinity
receptors will bind, internalize, and display more antigen
than B cells with lower-affinity receptors, and therefore
compete successfully for T-cell help and survival signals.
B cells with higher-affinity receptors have even been
demonstrated to strip antigen from lower-affinity B cells.
8. The presence of circulating immune complexes serves as
an indicator that the host organism has made a high
concentration of antigen-specific antibodies and has
succeeded in neutralizing the antigen. Therefore, no more
antibody production is needed, and the host should not
expend further energy in generating antibodies of this
specificity. IgG-containing immune complexes are
recognized by the Fc receptor FcRIIb (CD32), and
co-ligation of the immune complex by FcRIIb and by the
BCR results in phosphorylation of the ITIM on the
cytoplasmic tail of FcRIIb. Docking of the SHIP
phosphatase at this receptor molecule allows it to
dephosphorylate PIP3 to PIP2. This interferes with
transmission of antigen signals at the B-cell receptor,
resulting in the down-regulation of B-cell activation.

9. B-10 B cells have recently been shown to secrete the
immunosuppressive cytokine IL-10 upon antigen
stimulation.
10. (a) Small, soluble antigens can be directly acquired from
the lymphatic circulation by follicular B cells, without the
intervention of any other cells. These antigens enter the
lymph node via the afferent lymph and pass into the
subcapsular sinus (SCS) region. Some small antigens may
diffuse between the SCS macrophages that line the sinus
to reach the B cells in the follicles. (b) Other small
antigens leave the sinus through a conduit network.
Follicle B cells can access antigen through gaps in the
layer of cells that form the walls of the conduits.
(c) Larger antigens are bound by complement receptors
on the surfaces of SCS macrophages. Antigen-specific
B cells within the follicles can acquire the antigens
directly from the macrophages and become activated.

Clinical Focus Answers
1. Arthritis is characterized by inflammation of a joint
leading to damaged tissue, swelling, and pain. Psoriatic
arthritis is accompanied by skin lesions caused by
immune attack (psoriasis). Association of KIR-MHC
combinations with susceptibility to arthritic disease
would likely stem from a deficiency of inhibitory signals
(e.g., absence of MHC alleles that produce inhibitory
ligands for specific KIR molecules), leading to damage of
host cells and tissues. Diabetes is another autoimmune
disease; exhibiting destruction of the host pancreatic islet
cells that produce insulin, the same mechanisms predicted
for arthritis could operate in diabetes. In both cases,
absence of inhibitory NK signals could lead to damage
inflicted by NK cells, directly or through their
recruitment of other effector cells.
2. Rab27A is a GTPase that regulates the transport of
intracellular vesicles (granules) to the cell membrane.
Transport is required for the release of vesicular contents
into the extracellular space. Many cells depend on this
ability to function, including cytotoxic T cells, which
release perforin and granzyme from internal vesicles, and
melanocytes, which release pigment from vesicles
(melanosomes). Without this capacity, an individual will
be unable to kill infected cells and will exhibit a form of
albinism. Many other cells could be affected, including
granulocytes (eosinophils, basophils, and mast cells),
although it is important to recognize that some express
other Rab variants that compensate for the loss of Rab27
function.
1. FcRIII and CD23 are both Fc receptors (see Table 13-3).
Neutralization and complement fixation are antibody
functions that do not rely on Fc receptors (although FcR
can help mediate the clearance of neutralized antibodypathogen complexes). Opsonization and ADCC are
mediated by cells that express activating FcRs, including
FcRIII. CD23, however, is an inhibitory FcR that
regulates (inhibits) the activity of other activating FcRs.

Answers to Study Questions

So, in short, antibodies to FcRIII would block
opsonization and ADCC, but not neutralization and
complement fixation. Antibodies to CD23 would not
inhibit any process. (Because they block inhibitory signals
they could theoretically enhance opsonization and
ADCC; it is not clear, however, that this would occur in
all contexts.)
2. (a) False. Some FcRs, such as FcRII (CD23), are
inhibitory receptors. Others are expressed on cells that are
not phagocytes. These can mediate transcytosis, regulate
cell activation (e.g., antibody production of B cells), etc.
(b) False. IgE mediates degranulation and activation of
mast cells, basophils, and eosinophils. (c) True. (d) True.
(e) True. (f) False. There are two pathways by which
cytotoxic T cells kill target cells. One pathway is perforin
dependent, and the other uses FAS ligand displayed by
the CTL to induce death in FAS-expressing target cells.
(g) False. Naïve CD8 T cells can be activated in the
absence of CD4 T-cell help. T-cell help, however, is
required for optimal proliferation and memory
generation. (h) True. (i) False. Ly49 receptors are found
on murine cells. Human NK cells express KIR receptors
3. The monoclonal antibody to LFA-1 should block
formation of the CTL-target-cell conjugate. This should
inhibit killing of the target cell and, therefore, should
result in diminished 51Cr release in the CML assay.

5. (a) T cells (CD4 and CD8) as long as both MHC class I
and class II differ. (b) To demonstrate the identity of the
proliferating cells, you could incubate them with distinct
fluorochrome conjugated antibodies (e.g., fluoresceinlabeled anti-CD4 monoclonal antibody and
phycoerythrin-labeled anti-CD8 monoclonal antibody).
The proliferating cells will be stained only with the
anti-CD4 reagent. (c) As T cells recognize allogeneic
MHC molecules on the stimulator cells, they are activated
and begin to secrete IL-2, which then autostimulates
T-cell proliferation. Thus, the extent of proliferation is
directly related to the level of IL-2 produced.

(Brief explanation): T cells from one inbred strain of mice
will proliferate in response to alloantigens (MHC-peptide
combinations on the surface of cells from another strain
that differs by MHC haplotype) on the other strain. In the
first row, cells are isolated from two strains that do differ
by MHC haplotype (H-2b and H-2k). Cells from both
strains will respond to each other. (T cells will recognize
MHC-peptides on cells from the other strain (B cells and/
or some macrophages/monocytes that came along for the
ride.) In the second row, however, cells from the CBA
have been treated with a reagent that blocks proliferation.
Although cells from both strains will “want” to respond,
only those from the C57BL/6 isolates will be able to
proliferate. In the third row, the C57BL/6 T cells will
respond to cells from the F1 strain, but not vice versa.
Why? T cells from the F1 strain are tolerant to both MHC
haplotypes. In the fourth row, the strains do not differ by
MHC haplotype. All cells are tolerant to H-2b, and neither
cell group will respond.

Cr release from LCM-infected target cells

T cells will lyse targets expressing peptides from the
antigen to which they were primed (LCMV) and
expressing the MHC to which they are restricted
(syngeneic MHC). These requirements are met in all cases
where there is a positive symbol. The very observant
student might also recognize that T cells of one strain will
also react to alloantigens (cells from another strain
expressing a distinct MHC haplotype)—the focus of
question 4. In fact, this is true, and there will be some
background death in all cases of MHC “mismatch” (in
other words, you would also notice some “background”
killing in conditions that are labeled with a “−”).
However, because the T cells have been primed by
immunization to LCMV, the LCMV-specific MHC
restricted response would be a secondary response and
would dominate the primary alloresponse.
8. To determine TC activity specific for influenza, perform a
CML reaction by incubating spleen cells from the infected

peptides; measure IL-2 production.

CD94, NKG2) induce a signal transduction cascade that
abrogates NK lytic activity. These negative signals override
pro-killing signals generated via ligands binding to
activating receptors on the NK cell (NKR-P1 and others).
Some tumor cells and virally infected cells, however,
reduce their expression of class I MHC and no longer
stimulate NK inhibitory receptors. In this case, the
activating (pro-killing) receptor signal dominates.
10. There are two pathways by which cytotoxic T cells kill
target cells: one that is perforin dependent and one that
uses FasL to induce death in Fas-expressing target cells.
(And, as always, T cells will only lyse cells expressing the
MHC-peptide combinations to which they are specific
and restricted.) T cells from immunized perforin
knockout H-2d mice will be able to lyse (d). (These T cells
will depend on FasL-Fas interactions to kill. Target cells
don’t need to express perforin to be susceptible, but they
do need to express Fas.) T cells from immunized Fas
ligand knockout H-2d mice will be able to lyse (d), but
they will also be able to lyse (e). These cells will depend
on perforin-mediated pathways. Targets do not need to
express perforin or Fas to be susceptible.) T cells from
H-2d mice in which both perforin and Fas ligand have
been knocked out will not be able to lyse any of the cell
types.
11. If the HLA (human MHC) type is known, MHC
tetramers bound to the peptide generated from gp120 and
labeled with a fluorescent tag can be used to specifically
label all of the CD8 T cells in a sample that has T-cell
receptors capable of recognizing this complex of HLA and
peptide.
12. (a) True. (b) False. They need to express Fas, which
transmits the pro-apoptotic signal. (c) False. Both
mechanisms induce caspase activation. (d) False. Only the
perforin-mediated pathway depends on granzyme activity.
(e) True. (f) False. Perforin is responsible for the
development of surface membrane and endocytic
membrane pores.
Analyze the Data (a) Epitopes 2, 12, and 18 generated high
CTL activity, and epitopes 5 and 21 generated medium
activity. (b) It is possible that different peptides use
distinct anchor residues, which would make this
prediction more difficult. However, if we make the
assumption that the same amino acids would be bound by
HLA-A2, it appears that a leucine (L) on the amino
terminus side separated by four amino acids from a
threonine (T) is the only common motif for the five most
immunogenic peptides (2, 12, 18, 5, and 21). All of the
peptides that generate high CTL activity have two
consecutive leucines on the amino terminal side as well.
The problem with the threonines serving as anchors is
that peptide 2 has four amino acids at the carboxyl side of
the T, which seems to result in the end of the peptide
extending out of the binding pocket. This would be a very
unusual configuration. Peptide 12 may have a less
dramatic but similar problem. Therefore, a leucine in
pocket 2 of HLA-A2 would be consistent with the data
generated by M. Matsumura et al. in 1992 (Emerging
principles for the recognition of peptide antigens by MCH

AN-19

class molecules, Science 257:927). Thus, the main anchor
may be a leucine residue at the amino end of the binding
pocket, with possible contribution by T at the carboxyl
end under some circumstances. (c) It is possible that there
are no T cells specific for those peptides, even if they are
presented in complex with MHC. Therefore, you would
not see a CTL response. (d) CTLs only recognize antigen
in the context of self-MHC molecules. Therefore, in order
to assess CTL activity, the T2 cells also had to express
HLA-A2. (e) Class I MHC molecules typically bind
peptides containing 8 to 10 residues (see Figure 8-6).
Peptide 2 is 11 residues long, suggesting that it bulges in
the middle when bound. Since it appears to be a major
epitope for CTL killing, bulging does not seem to
interfere with CTL interaction and may contribute.

Analyze the Data (a) This should be clear from the video.
(b) Differences in expression of homing receptors and/or
chemokine receptors would be reasonable hypotheses. Make
sure to state specific possibilities (based on the information in
Appendix III and examples in the text). (c) This requires
creative (and rigorous) speculation on your part—we do not
really know. Both these subpopulations are effector memory
cells—consider what each will do if reactivated. Will they react
with different kinetics? Will they stay in the same area of the
tissue? Will they serve the same cell populations? Read the
authors’ discussion for their view of the possibilities.
Experimental Design Answer The best experimental designs
will include your question, your prediction, and your
experimental design. The design must include controls (both
positive and negative, if possible—and more than one at
times). You must also identify what you will measure and how
you will interpret that measurement.
Question: Do naïve B cells require CCR5 to localize to
B-cell follicles? Prediction: Yes, they are absolutely
dependent on this chemokine receptor; or no, they can
use other chemokine receptors, although perhaps less
efficiently.
Experimental Design: Fundamentally, you must compare
the in vivo activities of B cells that can use CCR5 with
those that cannot. One possibility: compare the behavior
of labeled, wild-type versus labeled, CCR5−/− B cells in
two groups of mice. Alternatively or in addition, track the
behavior of labeled, wild-type B cells in the presence or
absence of the CCR5 blocking antibody.
Once you decide on your design, you must develop a
protocol using intravital two-photon microscopy
(dynamic imaging). You must be able to trace naïve B-cell
movements (and, ideally, identify the B-cell follicle, too).
Therefore, you need to fluorescently label those B cells: in
vitro CFSE staining is probably the best approach in this
case because you will be examining the behavior of B cells
from different mice. It is not the only approach, however.
(Note: To define the follicular area, you could also
co-inject T cells that are labeled in a different color (few if
any should be in the follicles) or come up with another
more clever, original idea. Some investigators (as you may

Isolate, label, and inject the cells. Wait a specified time
(based on previous studies in the literature or on your
own experiments), anesthetize the mice, and record cell
behavior in an exposed lymph node over time.
What will you measure? Go back to your question.
Identifying the number of B cells that end up on a follicle
over a period of time would answer your question
directly. The figure you sketch could be a bar graph
comparing these numbers in each experimental
condition. Direction and speed of the cells may be two
other useful parameters that could be generated from an
analysis of trajectories—and you can describe how they
will contribute to your understanding of the question.
Clinical Focus Answers There are many different possibilities,
in theory. CD18 is part of the LFA-1 complex, which regulates
extravasation of multiple subsets of leukocytes (see text and
Advances Box 14-2). A CD18 deficiency could, therefore,
inhibit the ability of innate immune cells to travel to the site of
infection, naïve lymphocytes to enter secondary lymphoid
organs, effector cells to recirculate effectively, and so on. All of
these problems would severely decrease the ability of a child to
fight off infection. Treatment could include genetic
modification of bone marrow stem cells (reintroducing the
CD18 gene into hematopoietic stem cells), but should also
include judicious antibiotic use. Check online resources for the
what is possible. (Wikipedia.com and any government or
university-based clinical site will likely provide good
information.)
1. (a) True. (b) Not necessarily. Both provide higher resolution
than conventional fluorescent microscopy. (c) True.
(d) True. (e) True. (f) False.
2. You have not designed an experiment that allows you to
focus on antigen-specific T cells—which will represent only
a fraction of the whole population. You will need to find a
better way to track these. (What are the possibilities? Use
TCR transgenics specific for influenza [most, if not all, cells
will be antigen specific], or modify the virus so that it
expresses another antigen [e.g., OVA] that can be seen by
TCR-transgenic cells. Or, try to isolate influenza-specific
T cells [by tetramer staining? Difficult, but possible in
theory]).
3. (a) False. All leukocytes respond to chemokines—they are
one of the central regulators of immune cell migration.
(b) False. Naïve B cells do not express CCR7 (which helps
to send cells to the paracortex), but when activated by
antigen binding, they up-regulate it so that they travel to
the paracortex to find T-cell help. (c) False. Small antigens
(typically opsonized [by complement, for instance]) arrive
on their own via the afferent lymphatics. (d) False. They
“arrest” their migrating behavior. (e) False. They crawl
along the fibroblastic reticular cell network. (f) False. It
appears from recent data that these networks can be
established at sites of infection. (g) False. Strong adhesion
requires chemokine activation. Rolling is the first event
(mediated by selectins). (h) True.

4. The movement of an antigen-activated B cell from the
follicle to the border between the follicle and paracortex is
a classic example. However, there are many others,
including the response of innate cells to signals generated
by inflammation at the site of infection (e.g., neutrophils
are attracted to IL-8 produced by other innate cells,
including other neutrophils).
5. Both receive help in the lymph node cortex. B cells travel
to the interface between follicle and paracortex to receive
T-cell help and remain loosely associated with the follicle
during their interaction with the T cell. The CD8 T cells
receive help in the paracortex, where they interact with
APCs and CD4 T cells.
6. Recall that CCL3 is produced by antigen-presenting cells
that have been activated by CD4 helper T cells in the
lymph node. CCL3 attracts CD8 T cells to form a
tricellular complex so that they can receive optimal help.
Without this cytokine, CD8 T cells may not find their
way to antigen-presenting cell/CD4 T cell pairs and may
not be optimally activated. On the other hand, other
chemokines (e.g., CCL4) may be able to compensate.
7. (a) Rolling, chemokine interactions, adhesion,
transmigration. (b) Adhesion. Adhesion molecules such
as LFA-1 and VLA-4 are converted to their high-affinity
forms by chemokine receptor signals (via an inside-out
process). (c) The homing and chemokine receptors
expressed by naïve lymphocytes attract them to secondary
lymphoid tissues. For example, they express L-selectin
(CD62L), which interacts with ligands on specialized
endothelial structures (high-endothelial venules) located
in the cortex of the lymph node.
8. Both the pattern of expression of chemokine receptors
and chemokines regulate the compartmentalization of
T and B cells in the lymph node. For example, naïve
T cells express CCR7, which interacts with chemokines
that decorate the fibroblastic reticular cell network in the
paracortex. Naïve B cells express CCR5, which is
expressed by cells in the follicle and by the follicular DC
network. T-cell and B-cell movement is guided by the
routes laid down by these networks.
9. True. Germinal-center B cells are more motile and extend
unexpectedly long processes within the germinal center.

not home properly to the paracortex. Activated B cells

deposited when they pass through inflamed, vasodilated
capillaries. Multiple insults can cause these
hypersensitivities, including insect bites and inhalation of

9. (a) In the absence of inflammation, insulin signaling will
not be impaired by cytokine stimulation. Cytokine signals
activate kinases, including JNK, that phosphorylate and
inactivate IRS, a key downstream mediator of insulin
receptor signaling. (Interestingly, this observation suggests
that free fatty acids, alone, may not be enough to induce
insulin resistance.) (b) This question requires speculation—
there is no right answer. Some possibilities include
(1) differences in IRS that make it less able to be
phosphorylated at the serine residue, (2) differences in JNK
that make it less likely to bind IRS, (3) differences in gene
regions that regulate cytokine production by adipocytes,
and so on. See the chapter text and use your imagination!

1. (a) No type I (which is mediated by IgE/FcεRI
interactions), normal type II (which is mediated by IgG or
IgM). (b) Same as above. (c) May have some type I
reaction, but given that this receptor is important in
regulating (both enhancing and suppressing) B-cell
production of IgE, the response may be abnormal.
(d) Type II responses would be most impaired because
IgG and IgM exert their effects, in part, by recruiting
complement, as well as by inducing ADCC. (e) Type I
responses are likely to be suppressed. When bound by
soluble versions of FcεRII on B cells, CD21 enhances IgE
production. In its absence, the animal may not be able to
generate as much IgE antibody as a wild-type mouse.
(Note: All these answers assume that there are no other
similar or redundant genes and proteins that could
compensate for the absence of the gene in question.)

2. Primary mediators are found in mast cell and basophil
granules and are released as soon as a mast cell is activated.
These include histamine, proteases, serotonin, and so on
(see chapter text). Secondary mediators are generated by
mast cells and basophils in response to activation and are
released later in the response. These include cytokines,
leukotrienes, prostaglandins, and so on (see chapter text).

Clinical Focus Answer The observations that women mount
more robust immune responses and more TH1-pathwaydirected responses than men, as well as the effects of female
sex hormones on the immune response, may in part explain
gender differences in susceptibility to autoimmunity. Since the
TH1 type of response is proinflammatory, the development of
autoimmunity may be enhanced.

3. Histamine binds to at least four different histamine
receptors. Binding to H2 receptors inhibits mast cell
degranulation and therefore inhibits its own release.
4. IgG can bind to inhibitory Fc receptors (FcRII), which
are coexpressed by multiple cells that express FcεRIs. If an
antigen engages both IgG and IgE, it can co-engage FcεRI
and FcRII, which results in inhibition of FcεRI signaling
(see chapter text).
5. Rh mismatched moms and dads can generate both Rh
and Rh− fetuses. An Rh mother will be tolerant to the Rh
antigen and will not produce antibodies that could harm
either an Rh− or Rh fetus. However, an Rh− mother has the
potential to generate an antibody response against an Rh
fetus, and could generate a harmful secondary response to a
second, Rh fetus. Rhogam (anti-Rh antibodies) will clear
B cells (and antibodies) generated during the first pregnancy,
preventing such a secondary response.
6. See above. Rh babies are not at risk, but Rh fetuses are.
7. Type III hypersensitivities are disorders brought about by
immune complexes that cannot be cleared. They can
activate innate immune cells that express Fc receptors and
can activate complement, both of which induce
inflammation. Such immune complex-mediated
inflammation occurs in blood vessels, resulting in

1. The process called central tolerance eliminates lymphocytes
with receptors displaying affinity for self antigens in the
thymus or in the bone marrow. A self-reactive lymphocyte
may escape elimination in these primary lymphoid organs
if the self antigen is not encountered there or if the affinity
for the self antigen is below what is needed to trigger the
induction of apoptotic death. Self-reactive lymphocytes
escaping central tolerance elimination are kept from
harming the host by peripheral tolerance, which involves
three major strategies: induction of cell death or apoptosis,
induction of anergy (a state of nonresponsiveness), or
induction of an antigen-specific population of regulatory
T cells that keeps the self-reactive cells in check.
2. Tolerance is necessary to remove or regulate all selfreactive B and T lymphocytes. Without tolerance, which
can be defined as unresponsiveness to an antigen, massive
autoimmunity or self-reactivity would result.
3. Receptor editing is a process by which B cells (but not
T cells) exchange the potentially autoreactive V region of
the immunoglobulin with another V gene, thus changing
antigen specificity and avoiding self-reactivity.

animals that recover from EAE are now resistant to EAE.
If they are given a second injection of MBP in complete
Freund’s adjuvant, they no longer develop EAE. (c) If
T cells from mice with EAE are transferred to normal
syngeneic mice, the mice will develop EAE.
6. A number of viruses have been shown to possess proteins
that share sequences with myelin basic protein (MBP).
Since the encephalitogenic peptides of MBP are known, it
is possible to test these peptides to see whether they bear
sequence homology to known viral protein sequences.
Computer analysis has revealed a number of viral
peptides that bear sequence homology to
encephalitogenic peptides of MBP. By immunizing rabbits
with these viral sequences, it was possible to induce EAE.
The studies on the encephalitogenic peptides of MBP also
showed that different peptides induced EAE in different
strains. Thus, the MHC haplotype will determine which
cross-reacting viral peptides will be presented and,
therefore, will influence the development of EAE.
7. (1) A virus might express an antigenic determinant that
cross-reacts with a self-component. (2) A viral infection
might induce localized expression of IFN-. IFN- might
then induce inappropriate expression of class II MHC
molecules on non-antigen-presenting cells, enabling self
peptides presented together with the class II MHC
molecules on these cells to activate TH cells. (3) A virus
might damage an organ, resulting in release of antigens
that are normally sequestered from the immune system.
8. Anti-CD3 monoclonal antibodies have been used to block
T-cell activity in T1DM. Rituximab, a monoclonal
antibody against the B-cell-specific antigen CD20,
depletes a subset of B cells and has been used to treat
patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Monoclonal
antibodies against CD4, which depletes TH cells, and one
against IL-6 that blocks this pro-inflammatory cytokine,
have also been used to treat RA. For psoriasis, a
monoclonal antibody that recognizes the p40 subunit
shared by IL-12 and IL-23 blocks this signaling pathway.
Likewise, the fusion protein CTLA-4Ig blocks interactions

between CD28 on T cells and CD80/86 on APCs, as
treatment for RA, lupus, and inflammatory bowel disease.
(See Table 16-5.)
9. (a) True. (b) False: IL-12, which promotes the
development of TH1 cells, increases the autoimmune
response to MBP plus adjuvant. (c) False: The presence of
HLA B27 is strongly associated with susceptibility to
ankylosing spondylitis but is not the only factor required
for development of the disease. (d) True.
10. a. (5), b. (1) (3) (4), c. (1) (3), d. (1) (2) (3)
11. (a) Polyclonal B-cell activation can occur as a result of
infection with gram-negative bacteria, cytomegalovirus, or
Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), which induce nonspecific
proliferation of B cells; some self-reactive B cells can be
stimulated in this process. (b) If normally sequestered
antigens are exposed, self-reactive T cells may be
stimulated. (c) The immune response against a virus may
cross-react with normal cellular antigens, as in the case of
molecular mimicry. (d) Increased expression of TCR
molecules should not lead to autoimmunity; however, if
the expression is not regulated in the thymus, self-reactive
cells could be produced. (e) Increased expression of class
II MHC molecules has been seen in type 1 diabetes mellitus
(T1DM) and Graves’ disease, suggesting that inappropriate
antigen presentation may stimulate self-reactive T cells.
12. (a) False: Acute rejection is cell mediated and probably
involves the first-set rejection mechanism (see Figures
16-10b and 16-15). (b) True. (c) False: Passenger
leukocytes are donor dendritic cells that express class I
MHC molecules and high levels of class II MHC
molecules. They migrate from the grafted tissue to regional
lymph nodes of the recipient, where host immune cells
respond to alloantigens on them. (d) False: A graft that is
matched for the major histocompatibility antigens,
encoded in the HLA, may be rejected because of
differences in the minor histocompatibility antigens
encoded at other loci. (e) True.

Answers to Study Questions
14. (a) GVHD develops as donor T cells recognize alloantigens
on cells of an immune-suppressed host. The response
develops as donor TH cells are activated in response to
recipient MHC-peptide complexes displayed on APCs.
Cytokines elaborated by these TH cells activate a variety of
effector cells, including NK cells, CTLs, and macrophages,
which damage the host tissue. In addition, cytokines such
as TNF may mediate direct cytolytic damage to the host
cells. (b) GVHD develops when the donated organ or tissue
contains immunocompetent lymphocytes and when the
host is immune suppressed. (c) The donated organ or tissue
could be treated with monoclonal antibodies to CD3, CD4,
or the high-affinity IL-2 receptor (IL-2R) to deplete donor
TH cells. The rationale behind this approach is to diminish
TH-cell activation in response to the alloantigens of the
host. The use of anti-CD3 will deplete all T cells; the use of
anti-CD4 will deplete all TH cells; the use of anti-IL-2R will
deplete only the activated TH cells.
15. The use of soluble CTLA4 or anti-CD40 ligand to
promote acceptance of allografts is based on the
requirement of a T cell for a costimulatory signal when its
receptor is bound. Even if the recipient T cell recognizes
the graft as foreign, the presence of CTLA4 or antiCD40L will prevent the T cell from becoming activated
because it does not receive a second signal through the
CD40 or CD28 receptor (see Figure 16-17). Instead of
becoming activated, T cells stimulated in the presence of
these blocking molecules become anergic. The advantage
of using soluble CTLA4 or anti-CD40L is that these
molecules affect only those T cells involved in the
reaction against the allograft. These allograft-specific
T cells will become anergic, but the general population
of T cells will remain normal. More general
immunosuppressive measures, such as the use of CsA or
FK506, cause immunodeficiency and subsequent
susceptibility to infection.
16. Azathioprine is a mitotic inhibitor used to block proliferation
of graft-specific T cells. Cyclosporin A, FK506 (tacrolimus),
and rapamycin (sirolimus) are fungal metabolites that block
activation and proliferation of resting T cells. Ideally, if early
rejection is inhibited by preventing a response by specific
T cells, these cells may be rendered tolerant of the graft over
time. Lowering the dosage of the drugs is desirable because
of decreased side effects in the long term.
Clinical Focus Answer The ideal animal for producing organs
for xenotransplantation would have body size roughly
equivalent to that of humans and could be genetically altered
to eliminate any antigens that cause acute rejection. It should
be free of any disease that can be passed to humans. The test of
the organs must include transplantation to nonhuman
primates and observation periods that are sufficiently long to
ascertain that the organ remains fully functional in the new
host and that no disease is transmitted.

Chapter 17
Infectious Diseases
Clinical Focus Answer
1. (a) Because the infected target cells expressed H-2k MHC
molecules but the primed T cells were H-2k restricted.

AN-23

(b) Because the influenza nucleoprotein is processed by
the endogenous processing pathway and the resulting
peptides are presented by class I MHC molecules.
(c) Probably because the transfected class I Db molecule is
only able to present peptide 365–380 and not peptide
50–63. Alternatively, peptide 50–63 may not be a T-cell
epitope. (d) These results suggest that a cocktail of several
immunogenic peptides would be more likely to be
presented by different MHC haplotypes in humans and
would provide the best vaccines for humans.
2. Nonspecific host defenses include ciliated epithelial cells,
bactericidal substances in mucous secretions, complement
split products activated by the alternative pathway that
serve both as opsonins and as chemotactic factors, and
phagocytic cells.
3. Specific host defenses include humoral immunity which
targets the destruction of extracellular infections
(bacterial, fungal, or parasitic) or neutralization of all
types of pathogens during extracellular stages, CTLs that
identify and eliminate virally infected host cells, and
T helper cells that secrete cytokines to assist other
leukocytes in the elimination of both intracellular and
extracellular pathogens.
4. Humoral antibody peaks within a few days of infection
and binds to the influenza HA glycoprotein, blocking viral
infection of host epithelial cells. Because the antibody is
strain specific, its major role is in protecting against
re-infection with the same strain of influenza.
5. (a) African trypanosomes are capable of antigenic shifts
in the variant surface glycoprotein (VSG). The antigenic
shifts are accomplished as gene segments encoding parts
of the VSG are duplicated and translocated to
transcriptionally active expression sites. (b) Plasmodium
evades the immune system by continually undergoing
maturational changes from sporozoite to merozoite to
gametocyte, allowing the organism to continually change
its surface molecules. In addition, the intracellular phases
of its life cycle reduce the level of immune activation.
Finally, the organism is able to slough off its
circumsporozoite coat after antibody binds to it.
(c) Influenza is able to evade the immune response
through frequent antigenic changes in its hemagglutinin
and neuraminidase glycoproteins. The antigenic changes
are accomplished by the accumulation of small point
mutations (antigenic drift) or through genetic
reassortment of RNA between influenza virions from
humans and animals (antigenic shift).
6. (a) IAb. (b) Because antigen-specific, MHC-restricted TH
cells participate in B-cell activation.

8. Most fungal infections prevalent in the general population
do not lead to severe disease and are dealt with by innate
immune mechanisms and lead to protective adaptive
responses. Problematic fungal infections are more
commonly seen in those with some form of

immunodeficiency, such as patients with HIV/AIDS or
those with immunosuppression caused by therapeutic
measures.
9. One possible reason for the emergence of new pathogens
is the crowding of the world’s poorest populations into
very small places within huge cities, because population
density increases the spread of disease. Another factor is
the increase in international travel. Other features of
modern life that may contribute include mass distribution
of food, which exposes large populations to potentially
contaminated food, and unhygienic food preparation.
10. (a) Influenza virus changes surface expression of
neuraminidase and hemagglutinin. (b) Herpesviruses
remains dormant in nerve cells. Later emergence can
cause outbreaks of cold sores or shingles (chickenpox
virus). (c) Neisseria secretes proteases that cleave IgA.
(d) False. (e) Several gram-positive bacteria resist
complement-mediated lysis. (f) Influenza virus
accumulates mutations from year to year. (g) False.
11. (a) No, IgE is raised against allergens and some parasites.
(b) No, autoreactive T cells are activated only by
intracellular infections. The statements in (c) through
(f) are correct.
12. (a) Large, granular cells such as mast cells and eosinophils.
Neutrophils and macrophages will also be involved.
(b) Therapeutic cytokines such as IL-4 would help
encourage IgE and the TH2 response which is already
present. However, cytokines that drive a TH1 response, such
as IL-12 or IFN-γ, may be more beneficial to longer-term
immunity.
13. The answer comes from the concept of original antigenic
sin, which posits that we only mount a primary response
once we have exhausted the potential to use memory cells to
eradicate the infection. Since most of our first encounters
with influenza will vary, the years in which “all” of the key
influenza epitopes are significantly “new” to each of us will
also vary (see Figure 17-4b). It is only in these years that we
experience a new primary response to influenza virus, and
therefore symptoms of the flu are most severe.

Vaccines
Clinical Focus Answers Any connection between vaccination
and a subsequent adverse reaction must be evaluated by valid
clinical trials involving sufficient numbers of subjects in the
control group (those given a placebo) and experimental group
(those receiving the vaccine). This is needed to give a
statistically correct assessment of the effects of the vaccine
versus other possible causes for the adverse event. Such clinical
studies must be carried out in a double-blind manner; that is,
neither the subject nor the caregiver should know who received
the vaccine and who received the placebo until the end of the
observation period. In the example cited, it is possible that the
adverse event (increased incidence of arthritis) was caused by
an infection occurring near the time when the new vaccine was
administered. Determining the precise cause of this side effect
may not be possible, but ascertaining whether it is likely to be
caused by this vaccine is feasible by appropriate studies of the
vaccinated and control populations.

1. (a) True. (b) True. (c) False: Because DNA vaccines allow
prolonged exposure to antigen, they are likely to generate
immunologic memory. (d) True. (e) False: A DNA
vaccine contains the gene encoding an entire protein
antigen, which most likely contains multiple epitopes.
2. Because attenuated organisms are capable of limited
growth within host cells, they are processed by the
cytosolic pathway and presented on the membrane of
infected host cells together with class I MHC molecules.
These vaccines, therefore, usually can induce a cellmediated immune response. The limited growth of
attenuated organisms within the host often eliminates the
need for booster doses of the vaccine. Also, if the
attenuated organism is able to grow along mucous
membranes, then the vaccine will be able to induce the
production of secretory IgA. The major disadvantage of
attenuated whole-organism vaccines is that they may
revert to a virulent form. They also are more unstable
than other types of vaccines, requiring refrigeration to
maintain their activity.
3. (a) The antitoxin was given to inactivate any toxin that
might be produced if Clostridium tetani infected the
wound. The antitoxin was necessary because the girl had
not been previously immunized and, therefore, did not
have circulating antibody to tetanus toxin or memory
B cells specific for tetanus toxin. (b) Because of the
treatment with antitoxin, the girl would not develop
immunity to tetanus as a result of the first injury.
Therefore, after the second injury 3 years later, she will
require another dose of antitoxin. To develop long-term
immunity, she should be vaccinated with tetanus toxoid.
4. The Sabin polio vaccine is live and attenuated, whereas
the Salk vaccine is heat killed and inactivated. The Sabin
vaccine thus has the usual advantages of an attenuated
vaccine compared with an inactivated one (see answer 2).
Moreover, since the Sabin vaccine is capable of limited
growth along the gastrointestinal tract, it induces
production of secretory IgA. The attenuated Sabin vaccine
can cause life-threatening infection in individuals, such as
children with AIDS, whose immune systems are severely
suppressed. Now that polio is rarely if ever seen in the
United States, continuing use of a vaccine with the
potential to revert to a more virulent form introduces an
unwarranted element of risk to both the vaccinee and
others who might contract the disease from them.
5. The virus strains used for the nasally administered
vaccines are temperature-sensitive mutants that cannot
grow at human body temperature (37 ºC). The live
attenuated virus can grow only in the upper respiratory
tract, which is cooler, inducing protective immunity. These
mutant viruses cannot grow in the warmer environment of
the lower respiratory tract, where they could replicate and
mutate into a disseminated influenza infection.
6. T-cell epitopes generally are internal peptides, which
commonly contain a high proportion of hydrophobic
residues. In contrast, B-cell epitopes are located on an
antigen’s surface, where they are accessible to antibody,
and contain a high proportion of hydrophilic residues.
Thus, synthetic hydrophobic peptides are most likely to

Answers to Study Questions
represent T-cell epitopes and induce a cell-mediated
response, whereas synthetic hydrophilic peptides are most
likely to represent accessible B-cell epitopes and induce an
antibody response.
7. When the majority of a population is immune to a
particular pathogen—that is, there is herd immunity—
then the probability of the few susceptible members of the
population contacting an infected individual is very low.
Thus, susceptible individuals are not likely to become
infected with the pathogen. If the number of immunized
individuals decreases sufficiently, most commonly because
of reduction in vaccination rates, then herd immunity no
longer operates to protect susceptible individuals and
infection may spread rapidly in a population, leading to
an epidemic.
8. In this hypothetical situation, the gene can be cloned into an
expression system and the protein expressed and purified in
order to test it as a recombinant protein vaccine.
Alternatively, the gene can be cloned into a plasmid vector
that can be injected directly and tested as a DNA vaccine.
Use of the cloned gene as a DNA vaccine is more efficient,
because it eliminates the steps required for preparation of
the protein and its purification. However, the plasmid
containing the gene for the protective antigen must be
suitably purified for use in human trials. DNA vaccines have
a greater ability to stimulate both the humoral and cellular
arms of the immune system than protein vaccines do and
thus may confer more complete immunity. The choice must
also take into consideration the fact that recombinant
protein vaccines are in widespread use whereas DNA
vaccines for human use are still in early test phases.
9. Pathogens with a short incubation period (e.g., influenza
virus) cause disease symptoms before a memory-cell
response can be induced. Protection against such pathogens
is achieved by repeated reimmunizations to maintain high
levels of neutralizing antibody. For pathogens with a longer
incubation period (e.g., polio virus), the memory-cell
response is rapid enough to prevent development of
symptoms, and high levels of neutralizing antibody at the
time of infection are unnecessary.
10. Bacterial capsular polysaccharides, inactivated bacterial
exotoxins (toxoids), and surface protein antigens. The
latter two commonly are produced by recombinant DNA
technology. In addition, the use of DNA molecules to
direct synthesis of antigens on immunization is being
evaluated.
11. A possible loss of herd immunity in the population. Even
in a vaccinated population of children, a small percentage
may have diminished immunity to the diseased target due
to differences among MHC molecule expression in a
population, providing a reservoir for the disease. In
addition, most vaccinated individuals, if exposed to the
disease, will develop mild illness. Exposure of
unvaccinated individuals to either source of disease would
put them at risk for serious illness. Epidemics within
adult populations would have more serious consequences,
and infant mortality due to these diseases would increase.

13. (a) No. The antisera you received 1 year ago protected you
temporarily but those antibodies are now gone and you
have no memory B cells to produce new antibodies
during this second exposure. (b) Antibodies in the
antiserum bound to the snake venom and neutralized its
ability to cause damage. Phagocytes then engulfed and
destroyed this antibody-coated venom. Because the snake
venom was coated with antibodies, naïve B cells were not
activated during this first exposure and therefore no
adaptive immune response was mounted (see Figure
17-4a). (c) Equally sensitive. There are no residual cells or
antibodies that were involved in the original encounter
with this snake venom and, therefore, no recall response.
Analyze the Data (a) The pSG5DNA-Bcl-xL targeting
calreticulin (CRT) and LAMP-1 are the most effective vaccines
at inducing CD8 T cells to make IFN-. The pSG5DNA-Bcl-xL
targeting HSP70 also activated CD8 T cells. However, the
pSG5 construct without the anti-apoptosis gene targeting CRT
also induced a good CD8 T-cell response. (b) Calreticulin is a
chaperone protein associated with partially folded class I MHC
molecules in the endoplasmic reticulum. Associating E7
antigen with the chaperone may enhance loading of class I
MHC molecules with E7, making the antigen more available to
T cells once it is expressed on cells. (c) The DNA vaccines
co-injected with pSG5DNA-Bcl-xL were effective in inducing
CD8 T cells, possibly because the expression of antiapoptotic genes in dendritic cells allowed those cells to survive
longer and present antigen to T cells for a longer time. The
longer they presented antigen, the longer the host would
respond to produce antigen-specific T cells. (d) The data in
part (b) of the figure indicate that in the absence of CD4
helper T cells (in CD4 knockout mice), there is ineffective
activation of CD8 T cells. Therefore, T-cell help is necessary
to activate the CD8 response; by targeting antigen to MHC II,
you more efficiently activate helper T cells. The Sig/E7/
LAMP-1 construct was necessary because most antigens
presented by MHC II molecules are processed by the
endocytic pathway, and the Sig/E7/LAMP-1 construct targets
antigen to the Golgi, where the E7 peptides can be exchanged
with CLIP and inserted into MHC II. (e) Helper T cells (poor
response in the CD4 knockout mice), long-lived dendritic cells
(immunization with the pSG5DNA-Bcl-xL improves the
response), antigen (the absence of peptide failed to induce a
response), and the targeting of antigen to MHC II
(immunizing with the Sig/E7/LAMP-1 construct is the only
one that induces a CD8 T-cell response).

Clinical Focus Answers Before nevirapine can be universally
administered to all mothers at delivery, it is necessary to know
that the benefit of this treatment outweighs the risk. The
benefit of the drug, as learned from studies already conducted,
is that it reduces significantly the transmission of HIV to
infants born of infected mothers. A study of the risk of
nevirapine administration to normal mothers and their infants
must be carried out, and only if there are minimal or no side
effects can universal treatment be recommended.
1. (a) True. (b) False: X-linked agammaglobulinemia is

recurrent bacterial and fungal infections. (d) True.
(e) True. (f) True. (g) True. (h) True. (i) False: These
children are usually able to eliminate common
encapsulated bacteria with antibody plus complement but
are susceptible to viral, protozoan, fungal, and
intracellular bacterial pathogens, which are eliminated by
the cell-mediated branch of the immune system. (j) False:
Humoral immunity also is affected because class
II-restricted TH cells must be activated for an antibody
response to occur.
2. (a) 3. (b) 4. (c) 2. (d) 5. (e) 1. (f) 2.
3. The defect in X-linked hyper-IgM syndrome is in CD40L
expressed on B cells. CD40L mediates binding of B cells to
T cells and sends costimulatory signals to the B cell for class
switching. Without CD40L, class switching does not occur,
and the B cells do not express other antibody isotypes.
4. As discussed in Chapter 9, the thymus is the location of
differentiation and maturation of helper and cytotoxic
T cells. Positive and negative selection occur in this organ
as well. Thus, the thymocytes produced in the bone
marrow of patients with DiGeorge syndrome do not have
the ability to mature into effector cell types. In Chapter 2,
we noted that the thymus decreases in size and function
with age. In the adult, effector-cell populations have
already been produced (peak thymus size occurs during
puberty); therefore, a defect after this stage would cause
less severe T-cell deficiency.
5. As long as the mother is not immunocompromised,
maternal antibodies in the mother’s serum will be
passively transferred to the baby in utero. After birth,
these IgG molecules will supply the newborn with passive
immune protection from many common bacterial
infections, which can then be quickly dispatched by
antibody-mediated mechanisms. In immune competent
babies, these maternal antibodies will eventually be
replaced by the child’s own immune response to the
infectious agents they encounter. In children with SCID,
this does not occur, and they gradually become more
susceptible to bacterial infections as their maternally
derived antibodies disappear.
6. Encapsulated bacteria, such as staphylococci, streptococci,
and pneumococci, all require antibody-mediated
opsonization for their clearance. These types of bacteria
are therefore a particular problem for individuals who
lack humoral immunity.
7. (a) Leukocyte adhesion deficiency results from
biosynthesis of a defective  chain in LFA-1, CR3, and
CR4, which all contain the same  chain. (b) LFA-1 plays
a role in cell adhesion by binding to ICAM-1 expressed
on various types of cells. Binding of LFA-1 to ICAM-1 is
involved in the interactions between TH cells and B cells,
between CTLs and target cells, and between circulating
leukocytes and vascular endothelial cells.
8. The high affinity IL-2 receptor is composed of two chains:
the  chain and the common  chain. Later, the  chain
was discovered to be a component of the receptors for five
other cytokines: IL-4, -7, -9, -15, and -21. During

hematopoiesis, developing lymphocytes require IL-7
signaling, and therefore the complete IL-7R, in order to
develop properly. Without the common  chain, this does
not occur and the development of lymphocytes is blocked.
9. Some components of the immune system are responsible
for regulating or suppressing the activity of leukocytes
(e.g., TREG cells). When these pathways are defective,
overactive immune responses can occur, leading to breaks
in self tolerance that lead to attacks on self molecules, or
autoimmune syndromes. One example is a disorder called
immune dysregulation, polyendocrinopathy, enteropathy,
X-linked (IPEX) syndrome, in which the gene encoding
the transcription factor that controls development of TREG
cells, Foxp3, is defective. Another example is autoimmune
polyendocrinopathy and ectodermal dystrophy
(APECED), a disorder that arises from defects in the
AIRE gene, encoding a transcription factor found in the
thymus. The AIRE protein is responsible for the
expression of tissue-restricted antigens. Without this
protein, the negative selection of T cells in the thymus
that recognize self antigen is disrupted and autoreactive
T cells emerge and instigate organ-specific autoimmune
attacks.
10. (a) The rearranged heavy-chain genes in SCID mice lack
the D and/or J gene segments. (b) According to the model
of allelic exclusion discussed in Chapter 5, a productive
heavy-chain gene rearrangement must occur before
-chain genes are rearranged. Since SCID mice lack
productive heavy-chain rearrangement, they do not
attempt  light-chain rearrangement. (c) Yes: The
rearranged heavy-chain gene would be transcribed to
yield a functional 
 heavy chain. The presence of the
heavy chain then would induce rearrangement of the
-chain gene (see Figure 7-11).
11. (a) False: HIV-1 is believed to have evolved from a strain
of SIV that jumped the species barrier from African
chimpanzees to humans, although HIV-2 is thought to
have arisen from a separate but similar transfer from SIVinfected sooty mangabeys. (b) False: HIV-1 infects
chimpanzees but does not cause immune suppression.
(c) True. (d) False: Zidovudine (or azidothymidine, AZT)
acts at the level of reverse transcription of the viral
genome, whereas saquinavir is an inhibitor of the viral
protease. (e) True. (f) False: A diagnosis of AIDS is based
on both a low CD4 T-cell count (below 200 cells/
l, or
14%) and the presence of certain AIDS-defining
conditions (see Table 18-3). (g) False: The PCR detects
HIV proviral DNA in latently infected cells. (h) True.
12. The most likely reason for T-cell depletion in AIDS is the
cytopathic effects of HIV infection. If the amount of virus
in circulation is decreased by the use of antiviral agents,
the number of T cells will increase.
13. No. For most of the asymptomatic phase of HIV
infection, viral replication and the CD4 T-cell number
are in a dynamic equilibrium; the level of virus and the
percentage of CD4 T cells remains relatively constant.
14. An increase in the viral load and a decrease in CD4
T-cell levels indicates that HIV infection is progressing

AnswersToStudyQuestions.indd Page AN-27 12/20/12 10:52 PM user-t044

/Volumes/203/MHR00209/siL52070/disk1of1/0071052070

Answers to Study Questions
from the asymptomatic phase into AIDS. Often, infection
by an opportunistic agent occurs when the viral load
increases and the CD4 T-cell level drops. The disease
AIDS in an HIV-1 infected individual is defined by a CD4
T-cell count of less than 200 cells/
l and/or the presence of
certain opportunistic infections (see Table 18-3).
15. Skin-test reactivity is monitored to indicate the functional
activity of TH cells. As AIDS progresses and CD4 T cells
decline, there is a decline in skin-test reactivity to common
antigens.
16. Receptors for certain chemokines, such as CXCR4 and
CCR5, also function as coreceptors for HIV-1. The
chemokine that is the normal ligand for the receptor
competes with the virus for binding to the receptor and can
thus inhibit cell infection by blocking attachment of the
virus (see Figure 18-15). Cytokines that activate T cells
stimulate infection because they increase expression of
receptors used by the virus.
17. No. There are latently infected cells that reside in lymph
nodes or in other sites. These cells can be activated and
begin producing virus, thus causing a relapse of the disease.
In a true cure for AIDS, the patient must be free of all cells
containing HIV DNA.
18. Patient L. S. fits the definition of AIDS, whereas patient B.
W. does not. The clinical diagnosis of AIDS among HIVinfected individuals depends on both the T-cell count, or
percentage, and the presence of various indicator diseases.
See Table 18-3.
19. (a) CVID lowers the number and percentage of T helper
cells. (b) Table 1 indicates that there are fewer naïve
CD8 T cells in CVID patients. This could mean chronic
activation in CVID has made these T cells less dependent
on IL-2. Alternatively, the figure accompanying this
question shows that bone marrow cells from CVID patients
make less IL-2. If this is also true of TH cells, or there are
fewer TH cells (as seen in the table accompanying this
question), then the generation of CTLs may be impaired.
This example of the complexity of the immune system
demonstrates that specific responses are not always easily
predictable. (c) False. The data in the figure accompanying
this question shows that the kinetics and overall production
of TNF- is greater in CVID than in normal patients, but
IL-2 is lower. Thus, there is no consistent impact. Based on
what we know about TNF- activity, it might be
responsible for increased pathology or cell death, perhaps
explaining the loss of both CD4 and CD8 cells in CVID
patients. (d) According to information in Chapter 18,
CVID lowers IgG, IgA, and IgM. However, based on the
data presented in the table accompanying this question,
one might predict that in the absence of T-cell help, there
will be a significant impact on class switching.

Chapter 19
Clinical Focus Answers Because cervical cancer is linked to
HPV infection, a preventive cancer vaccine may be possible; if
HPV infection is prevented, then cervical cancer should also
be prevented. Other cancers that may be targets for such

prevention include adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma and the
liver cancer that is linked to hepatitis B infection. Most cancers
have not been clearly linked to an agent of infection, and
therefore a preventive vaccine is not an option.
1. (a) False: Hereditary retinoblastoma results from
inactivation of both alleles of Rb, a tumor-suppressor gene.
(b) True. (c) True. (d) True. (e) False: Some oncogenic
retroviruses do not have viral oncogenes. (f) True.
2. Cells of the pre-B-cell lineage have rearranged the heavychain genes and express the 
 heavy chain in their
cytoplasm (see Figure 10-6). You could perform
Southern-blot analysis with a C
 probe to see whether
the heavy-chain genes have rearranged. You could also
perform fluorescent staining with antibody specific for the
cytoplasmic 
 heavy chain.
3. (a) Early-stage melanoma cells appear to be functioning
as APCs, processing the antigen by the exogenous
pathway and presenting the tetanus toxoid antigen
together with the class II MHC DR molecule.
(b) Advanced-stage melanoma cells might have a
reduction in the expression of class II MHC molecules, or
they might not be able to internalize and process the
antigen by the exogenous route. (c) Since the
paraformaldehyde-fixed early melanoma cells could
present processed tetanus toxoid, they must express class
II MHC molecules on their surface. (d) Stain the early
and advanced melanoma cells with fluorescent mAb
specific for class II MHC molecules.
4. Tumor antigens may be encoded by genes expressed only
by tumors, may be products of genes overexpressed by the
tumor or genes normally expressed only at certain stages
of differentiation, or may be products of normal genes
that are altered by mutation. In some cases, viral products
may be tumor antigens.
5. IFN-, IFN-, and IFN- enhance the expression of class
I MHC molecules on tumor cells, thereby increasing the
CTL response to tumors. IFN- also increases the activity
of CTLs, macrophages, and NK cells, each of which plays
a role in the immune response to tumors. TNF- and
Lymphotoxin- have direct anti-tumor activity, inducing
hemorrhagic necrosis and tumor regression. IL-2 activates
TIL cells, which have anti-tumor activity.
6. (a) Melanoma cells transfected with the CD80/86 gene
are able to deliver the costimulatory signal necessary for
activation of CTL precursors to effector CTLs, which
then can destroy tumor cells (Figure 19-12). Melanoma
cells transfected with the GM-CSF gene secrete this
cytokine, which stimulates the activation and
differentiation of APCs, especially DCs, in the vicinity.
The DCs then can present tumor antigens to TH cells
and CTL precursors, enhancing the generation of
effector CTLs (see Figure 19-10). (b) Because some of
the tumor antigens on human melanomas are expressed
by other types of cancers, transfected melanoma cells
might be effective against other tumors carrying
identical antigens.

Answers to Study Questions

Chapter 20
1. If I wished to precipitate my antigen, I might elect to use a
polyclonal preparation, as it would contain antibodies toward
multiple different determinants on the antigen and therefore
many antibody molecules could bind per antigen molecule,
maximizing the chances that at least some of the antibodies
could bind more than one antigen and facilitate precipitation.
2. With time, the population of B-cell clones that respond to
an antigen in an individual will change. Some B-cell
clones will die, and different clones will predominate.
Overall, the affinity of the antibodies in the serum will
increase according to the methods described in Chapter
12. However, this means that the proteins with which
individual antibodies will cross-react will change as the
range of binding sites modulates, and this is what has
happened in your experiment.
3. (a) Ideally, polyclonal. I will have the most effective
agglutination if antibodies can cross-link multiple sites on
the bacterial surface. However, a monoclonal antibody
would also work, as most antigens are repeated many times
on the bacterial surface. (b) Ideally, polyclonal. To form a
precipitate, I will need to cross-link multiple proteins. If
each only has a single site at which an antibody can bind, a
bivalent antibody can cross-link only two proteins, and that
would be insufficient to create a precipitate. If I am
precipitating a protein with multiple copies of the same site,
then monoclonal antibodies could still work. (c) Here,
either would work. The antibody binds to the band,
localizing an enzymic reaction at the band and causing
substrate conversion to product. A polyclonal antibody
mixture would have the advantage that different antibodies
could bind at different antigenic determinants on the target
protein and therefore could give rise to a stronger signal.
However, different bleeds of polyclonal sera would have
different levels of cross-reactivity with other, structurally
similar determinants on other proteins. Monoclonal
antibodies will bind to predictable determinants, and,
although they might still cross-react with structurally
similar determinants on other proteins, those crossreactivities are predictable and will not change from batch
to batch. (d) Here, one would use two monoclonal
antibodies directed toward different determinants on the
cytokine. If the capture antibody were to be polyclonal,
such that all the binding sites on the cytokine were bound,
this would compete with a polyclonal detection antibody.
(e) Monoclonal. Here, reproducibility of reactivity and
cross-reactivity is demanded for clinical safety.
4. (a) Yes. There is some evidence of hemagglutination in
the first well, which represents an antiserum dilution of 1
in 10. (b) By 42 days of age, the baby’s serum has the same
capacity for hemagglutination inhibition as the positivecontrol sample. (c) No. These could be maternal
antibodies absorbed through breast milk or colostrum.
5. RIAs are orders of magnitude more sensitive than are
ELISAs with chromogenic substrates. And yes,
chemiluminogenic substrates allow more amplification
and greater sensitivity, resulting in an assay that matches
the RIA in its ability to measure low concentrations of
antibodies or antigens.

6. ELISPOT assays measure the number of cells capable of
secreting particular molecules, such as antibodies or
cytokines. These assays therefore require that when
substrate is converted to product, the product remains at
the location where the substrate-to-product reaction
occurred. Products in ELISPOT reactions are therefore
insoluble. Similarly, Western blot assays use antibodies to
determine the location of particular bands on a gel.
Again, one requires that the product of the enzymic assay
remains localized precisely where the enzyme is bound.
7. (a) Since cost is an issue, and I already have the antibody
labeled, I would probably use equilibrium dialysis. (b) Surface
plasmon resonance experiments will enable me to measure
the association, as well as the dissociation rate constant, of
the binding reaction between my antigen and antibody.
8. By using longer-wavelength, lower-energy light, twophoton microscopy induces less photobleaching of the
tissue preparation. Further, since no fluorescence is
emitted unless two exciting photons simultaneously
impinge on the sample, the focal plane of the observed
images can be more tightly defined.
9. Magnetic-activated cell sorting is most useful for batch
separations of cell populations. It is faster than fluorescencebased methods, but not quite as precise. I would choose
fluorescence-based sorting in situations when I need to be
sure that there are no contaminating cells, because in FACS,
cells are quite literally separated one at a time.
10. (a) PI3 kinase and IKK (b) NFB. NFB activity is
normally inhibited by the binding of the inhibitor of
NFB, IB. When cells are activated by particular signals,
the kinase IKK phosphorylates IB, targeting it for
destruction and enabling the passage of NFB into the
nucleus, thus activating transcription. (c) I expect one or
more of the intermediate proteins to bear pleckstrin
homology (PH) domains, as these domains bind to PIP3,
which is the product of the PI3 kinase catalyzed reaction.
11. There are many ways to test this idea, but we will offer
just one here, which makes use of adoptive transfer and
fluorescent labeling.
Generate B-1 B cells in culture specific for the virus in
question, and load them with CFSE. Inject the cells into
the tail of a mouse infected with the virus, allow the cells
to home for 12 to 24 hours, and then sacrifice the mouse
and search for CFSE-labeled cells in the lung using tissue
sections and immunofluorescence.
12. I will use a tamoxifen/Cre fusion protein whose expression
is under the control of a B-cell-specific promoter, such as
that controlling the expression of CD19. Therefore, Cre will
be active only in B cells and only if I add the tamoxifen and
I can therefore control exactly when the gene targeting will
occur in reference to antigen immunization.
I also need to generate an inactive, truncated form of the
gene in question that is flanked by loxP sites. Ideally, the
gene will have a selectable marker, such as neomycin
resistance, and also will bear a sequence external to the
loxP sites that will control for insertion of the gene into
the correct location (see Figure 20-25a, left).
