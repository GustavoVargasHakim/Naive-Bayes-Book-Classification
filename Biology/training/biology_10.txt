PLOTINUS
The main conclusion arrived at in this work, namely, that man is
descended from some lowly-organized form, will, I regret to
think, be highly distasteful to many persons. But there can
hardly be a doubt that we are descended from barbarians. The
astonishment which I felt on first seeing a party of Fuegians on
a wild and broken shore will never be forgotten by me, for the
reflection at once rushed into my mind - such were our
ancestors. These men were absolutely naked and bedaubed
with paint, their long hair was tangled, their mouths frothed in
excitement, and their expression was wild, startled, and
distrustful. They possessed hardly any arts, and, like wild
animals, lived on what they could catch; they had no
government, and were merciless to everyone not of their own
small tribe. He who has seen a savage in his native land will not
feel much shame, if forced to acknowledge that the blood of
some more humble creature flows in his veins. For my own
part, I would as soon be descended from that heroic little
monkey, who braved his dreaded enemy in order to save the

1

life of his keeper; or from that old baboon who, descending
from the mountains, carried away in triumph his young comrade
from a crowd of astonished dogs-as from a savage who
delights to torture his enemies, offers up bloody sacrifices,
practices infanticide without remorse, treats his wives like
slaves, knows no decency, and is haunted by the grossest
superstitions.
Man may be excused for feeling some pride at having risen,
though not through his own exertions, to the very summit of the
organic scale; and the fact of his having thus risen, instead of
having been aboriginally placed there, may give him hopes for a
still higher destiny in the distant future. But we are not here
concerned with hopes or fears, only with the truth as far as our
reason allows us to discover it. I have given the evidence to the
best of my ability; and we must acknowledge, as it seems to
me, that man with all his noble qualities, with sympathy which
feels for the most debased, with benevolence which extends
not only to other men but to the humblest 1 living creature,
with his godlike intellect which has penetrated into the
movements and constitution of the solar system-with all these
exalted powers-Man still bears in his bodily frame the indelible
stamp of his lowly origin.

The Descent of Man
I am a brother to dragons, and a companion to owls.
Job 30:29
JACOB BRONOWSKI was one of a small group of men and
women in any age who find all of human knowledge-the arts
and sciences, philosophy and psychology-interesting and
accessible. He was not confined to a single discipline, but
ranged over the entire panorama of human learning. His book
and television series, The Ascent of Man, are a superb teaching
tool and a remarkable memorial; they are, in a way, an account
of how human beings and human brains grew up together.

2

His last chapter/episode, called "The Long Childhood,"
describes the extended period of time-longer relative to our
lifespan than for any other species-in which young humans are
dependent on adults and exhibit immense plasticity-that is, the
ability to learn from their environment and their culture. Most
organisms on Earth depend on their genetic information, which
is "prewired" into their nervous systems, to a much greater
extent than they do on their extragenetic information, which is
acquired during their lifetimes. For human beings, and indeed
for all mammals, it is the other way around. While our behavior
is still significantly controlled by our genetic inheritance, we
have, through our brains, a much richer opportunity to blaze
new behavioral and cultural pathways on short time scales. We
have made a kind of bargain with nature: our children will be
difficult to raise, but their capacity for new learning will greatly
enhance the chances of survival of the human species. In
addition, human beings have, in the most recent few tenths of a
percent of our existence, invented not only extra-genetic but
also extrasomatic knowledge: information stored outside our
bodies, of which writing is the most notable example.
The time scale for evolutionary or genetic change is very long.
A characteristic period for the emergence of one advanced
species from another is perhaps a hundred thousand years; and
very often the difference in behavior between closely related
species-say, lions and tigers-do not seem very great. An
example of recent evolution of organ systems in humans is our
toes. The big toe plays an important function in balance while
walking; the other toes have much less obvious utility. They
are clearly evolved from fingerlike appendages for grasping and
swinging, like those of arboreal apes and monkeys. This
evolution constitutes a respecialization-the adaptation of an
organ system originally evolved for one function to another and
quite different function-which required about ten million years
to emerge. (The feet of the mountain gorilla have undergone a
similar although quite independent evolution.)
But today we do not have ten million years to wait for the next
advance. We live in a time when our world is changing at an
unprecedented rate. While the changes are largely of our own

3

making, they cannot be ignored. We must adjust and adapt and
control, or we perish.
Only an extragenetic learning system can possibly cope with
the swiftly changing circumstances that our species faces. Thus
the recent rapid evolution of human intelligence is not only the
cause of but also the only conceivable solution to the many
serious problems that beset us. A better understanding of the
nature and evolution of human intelligence just possibly might
help us to deal intelligently with our unknown and perilous
future.
I am interested in the evolution of intelligence for another
reason as well. We now have at our command, for the first time
in human history, a powerful tool- the large radio
telescope-which is capable of communication over immense
interstellar distances. We are just beginning to employ it in a
halting and tentative manner, but with a perceptibly increasing
pace, to determine whether other civilizations on unimaginably
distant and exotic worlds may be sending radio messages to us.
Both the existence of those other civilizations and the nature of
the messages they may be sending depend on the universality
of the process of evolution of intelligence that has occurred on
Earth. Conceivably, some hints or insights helpful in the quest
for extraterrestrial intelligence might be derived from an
investigation of the evolution of terrestrial intelligence.
I was pleased and honored to deliver the first Jacob Bronowski
Memorial Lecture in Natural Philosophy in November 1975, at
the University of Toronto. In writing this book, I have expanded
substantially the scope of that lecture, and have been in return
provided with an exhilarating opportunity to learn something
about subjects in which I am not expert. I found irresistible the
temptation to synthesize some of what I learned into a coherent
picture, and to tender some hypotheses on the nature and
evolution of human intelligence that may be novel, or that at
least have not been widely discussed.
The subject is a difficult one. While I have formal training in
biology, and have worked for many years on the origin and
early evolution of life, I have little formal education in, for

4

example, the anatomy and physiology of the brain. Accordingly,
I proffer the following ideas with a substantial degree of
trepidation; I know very well that many of them are speculative
and can be proved or disproved only on the anvil of experiment.
At the very least, this inquiry has provided me with an
opportunity to look into an entrancing subject; perhaps my
remarks will stimulate others to look more deeply.
The great principle of biology-the one that, as far as we know,
distinguishes the biological from the physical sciences-is
evolution by natural selection, the brilliant discovery of Charles
Darwin and Alfred Russel Wallace in the middle of the
nineteenth century.* It is through natural selection, the
preferential survival and replication of organisms that are by
accident better adapted to their environments, that the
elegance and beauty of contemporary life forms have emerged.
The development of an organ system as complex as the brain
must be inextricably tied to the earlier history of life, its fits
and starts and dead ends, the tortuous adaptation of organisms
to conditions that change once again, leaving the life form that
once was supremely adapted again in danger of extinction.
Evolution is adventitious and not foresighted. Only through the
deaths of an immense number of slightly maladapted organisms
are we, brains and all, here today.
Biology is more like history than it is like physics; the accidents
and errors and lucky happenstances of the past powerfully
prefigure the present. In approaching as difficult a biological
problem as the nature and evolution of human intelligence, it
seems to me at least prudent to give substantial weight to
arguments derived from the evolution of the brain.
* * Since the time of the famous Victorian debate between
Bishop Wilberforce and T. H. Huxley, there has been a steady
and notably unproductive barrage fired against the Darwin/
Wallace ideas, often by those with doctrinal axes to grind.
Evolution is a fact amply demonstrated by the fossil record and
by contemporary molecular biology. Natural selection is a
successful theory devised to explain the fact of evolution. For a

5

very polite response to recent criticisms of natural selection,
including the quaint view that it is a tautology ("Those who
survive survive"), see the article by Gould (1976) listed in the
references at the back of this book. Darwin was, of course, a
man of his times and occasionally given-as in his remarks on
the inhabitants of Tierra del Fuego quoted above-to
self-congratulatory comparisons of Europeans with other
peoples. In fact, human society in pretechnological times was
much more like that of the compassionate, communal and
cultured Bushman hunter-gatherers of the Kalahari Desert than
the Fuegians Darwin, with some justification, derided. But the
Darwinian insights-on the existence of evolution, on natural
selection as its prime cause, and on the relevance of these
concepts to the nature of human beings-are landmarks in the
history of human inquiry, the more so because of the dogged
resistance which such ideas evoked in Victorian England, as, to
a lesser extent, they still do today.
My fundamental premise about the brain is that its
workings-what we sometimes call "mind"-are a consequence of
its anatomy and physiology, and nothing more. "Mind" may be a
consequence of the action of the components of the brain
severally or collectively. Some processes may be a function of
the brain as a whole. A few students of the subject seem to
have concluded that, because they have been unable to isolate
and localize all higher brain functions, no future generation of
neuroanatomists will be able to achieve this objective. But
absence of evidence is not evidence of absence. The entire
recent history of biology shows that we are, to a remarkable
degree, the results of the interactions of an extremely complex
array of molecules; and the aspect of biology that was once
considered its holy of holies, the nature of the genetic material,
has now been fundamentally understood in terms of the
chemistry of its constituent nucleic acids, DNA and RNA, and
their operational agents, the proteins. There are many
instances in science, and particularly in biology, where those
closest to the intricacies of the subject have a more highly
developed (and ultimately erroneous) sense of its intractability
than those at some remove. On the other hand, those at too
great a distance may, I am well aware, mistake ignorance for

6

perspective. At any rate, both because of the clear trend in the
recent history of biology and because there is not a shred of
evidence to support it, I will not in these pages entertain any
hypotheses on what used to be called the mind-body dualism,
the idea that inhabiting the matter of the body is something
made of quite different stuff, called mind.
Part of the enjoyment and indeed delight of this subject is its
contact with all areas of human endeavor, particularly with the
possible interaction between insights obtained from brain
physiology and insights obtained from human introspection.
There is, fortunately, a long history of the latter, and in former
times the richest, most intricate and most profound of these
were called myths. "Myths," declared Salustius in the fourth
century, "are things which never happened but always are." In
the Platonic dialogues and The Republic, every time Socrates
cranks up a myth-the parable of the cave, to take the most
celebrated example-we know that we have arrived at
something central.
I am not here employing the word "myth" in its present popular
meaning of something widely believed and contrary to fact, but
rather in its earlier sense, as a metaphor of some subtlety on a
subject difficult to describe in any other way. Accordingly, I
have interspersed in the discussion on the following pages
occasional excursions into myths, ancient and modern. The title
of the book itself comes from the unexpected aptness of
several different myths, traditional and contemporary.
While I hope that some of my conclusions may be of interest to
those whose profession is the study of human intelligence, I
have written this book for the interested layman. Chapter 2
presents arguments of somewhat greater difficulty than the rest
of this inquiry, but still, I hope, accessible with only a little
effort. Thereafter, the book should be smooth sailing.
Occasional technical terms are usually defined when first
introduced, and are collected in the glossary. The figures and
the glossary are additional tools to aid those with no formal
background in science, although understanding my arguments
and agreeing with them are not, I suspect, the same thing. In

7

1754, Jean Jacques Rousseau, in the opening paragraph of his
Dissertation on the Origin and Foundation of the Inequity of
Mankind, wrote:
Important as it may be, in order to judge rightly of the natural
state of man, to consider him from his origin ... I shall not
follow his organization through its successive developments. . .
. On this subject I could form none but vague and almost
imaginary conjectures. Comparative anatomy has as yet made
too little progress, and the observations of naturalists are too
uncertain to afford an adequate basis for any solid reasoning.
Rousseau's cautions of more than two centuries ago are valid
still. But there has been remarkable progress in investigating
both comparative brain anatomy and animal and human
behavior, which he correctly recognized as critical to the
problem. It may not be premature today to attempt a
preliminary synthesis.

1 THE COSMIC CALENDAR
What seest thou else
In the dark backward and abysm of time?
WM. SHAKESPEARE The Tempest
THE WORLD is very old, and human beings are very young.
Significant events in our personal lives are measured in years
or less; our lifetimes in decades; our family genealogies in
centuries; and all of recorded history in millennia. But we have
been preceded by an awesome vista of time, extending for
prodigious periods into the past, about which we know littleboth because there are no written records and because we
have real difficulty in grasping the immensity of the intervals
involved.
Yet we are able to date events in the remote past. Geological
stratification and radioactive dating provide information on

8

archaeological, paleontological and geological events; and
astrophysical theory provides data on the ages of planetary
surfaces, stars, and the Milky Way Galaxy, as well as an
estimate of the time that has elapsed since that extraordinary
event called the Big Bang-an explosion that involved all of the
matter and energy in the present universe. The Big Bang may
be the beginning of the universe, or it may be a discontinuity in
which information about the earlier history of the universe was
destroyed. But it is certainly the earliest event about which we
have any record.
The most instructive way I know to express this cosmic
chronology is to imagine the fifteen-billion-year lifetime of the
universe (or at least its present incarnation since the Big Bang)
compressed into the span of a single year. Then every billion
years of Earth history would correspond to about twenty-four
days of our cosmic year, and one second of that year to 475
real revolutions of the Earth about the sun. On pages 14
through 16 I present the cosmic chronology in three forms: a
list of some representative pre-December dates; a calendar for
the month of December; and a closer look at the late evening of
New Year's Eve. On this scale, the events of our history
books-even books that make significant efforts to
deprovincialize the present-are so compressed that it is
necessary to give a second-by-second recounting of the last
seconds of the cosmic year. Even then, we find events listed as
contemporary that we have been taught to consider as widely
separated in time. In the history of life, an equally rich tapestry
must have been woven in other periods-for example, between
10:02 and 10:03 on the morning of April 6th or September 16th.
But we have detailed records only for the very end of the
cosmic year.
The chronology corresponds to the best evidence now
available. But some of it is rather shaky. No one would be
astounded if, for example, it turns out that plants colonized the
land in the Ordovician rather than the Silurian Period; or that
segmented worms appeared earlier in the Precambrian Period
than indicated. Also, in the chronology of the last ten seconds
of the cosmic year, it was obviously impossible for me to

9

include all significant events; I hope I may be excused for not
having explicitly mentioned advances in art, music and
literature or the historically significant American, French,
Russian and Chinese revolutions.

The construction of such tables and calendars is inevitably
humbling. It is disconcerting to find that in such a cosmic year
the Earth does not condense out of interstellar matter until
early September; dinosaurs emerge on Christmas Eve; flowers
arise on December 28th; and men and women originate at 10:30
P.M. on New Year's Eve. All of recorded history occupies the
last ten seconds of December 31; and the time from the waning
of the Middle Ages to the present occupies little more than one
second. But because I have arranged it that way, the first
cosmic year has just ended. And despite the insignificance of
the instant we have so far occupied in cosmic time, it is clear
that what happens on and near Earth at the beginning of the
second cosmic year will depend very much on the scientific
wisdom and the distinctly human sensitivity of mankind.
2 GENES AND BRAINS
What the hammer? What the chain?
In what furnace was thy brain?
What the anvil? What dread grasp

11

Dare its deadly terrors clasp?
WM. BLAKE "The Tyger"
Of all animals, man has the largest brain in proportion to his
size.
ARISTOTLE
The Parts of Animals
BIOLOGICAL evolution has been accompanied by increasing
complexity. The most complex organisms on Earth today
contain substantially more stored information, both genetic and
extragenetic, than the most complex organisms of, say, two
hundred million years ago-which is only 5 percent of the
history of life on the planet, five days ago on the Cosmic
Calendar. The simplest organisms on Earth today have just as
much evolutionary history behind them as the most complex,
and it may well be that the internal biochemistry of
contemporary bacteria is more efficient than the internal
biochemistry of the bacteria of three billion years ago. But the
amount of genetic information in bacteria today is probably not
vastly greater than that in their ancient bacterial ancestors. It is
important to distinguish between the amount of information and
the quality of that information.
The various biological forms are called taxa (singular, taxon).
The largest taxonomic divisions distinguish between plants and
animals, or between those organisms with poorly developed
nuclei in their cells (such as bacteria and blue-green algae) and
those with very clearly demarcated and elaborately
architectured nuclei (such as protozoa or people). All organisms
on the planet Earth, however, whether they have well-defined
nuclei or not, have chromosomes, which contain the genetic
material passed on from generation to generation. In all
organisms the hereditary molecules are nucleic acids. With a
few unimportant exceptions, the hereditary nucleic acid is
always the molecule called DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid). Much
finer divisions among various sorts of plants and animals, down
to species, subspecies and races, can also be described as
separate taxa.

12

A species is a group that can produce fertile offspring by
crosses within but not outside itself. The mating of different
breeds of dogs yields puppies which, when grown, will be
reproductively competent dogs. But crosses between
species-even species as similar as donkeys and
horses-produce infertile offspring (in this case, mules).
Donkeys and horses are therefore categorized as separate
species. Viable but infertile matings of more widely separated
species-for example, lions and tigers-sometimes occur, and if,
rarely, the offspring are fertile, this indicates only that the
definition of species is a little fuzzy. All human beings are
members of the same species, Homo sapiens, which means, in
optimistic Latin, "Man, the wise." Our probable ancestors, Homo
erectus and Homo habilis -now extinct-are classified as of the
same genus (Homo) but of different species, although no one
(at least lately) has attempted the appropriate experiments to
see if crosses of them with us would produce fertile offspring.
In earlier times it was widely held that offspring could be
produced by crosses between extremely different organisms.
The Minotaur whom Theseus slew was said to be the result of
a mating between a bull and a woman. And the Roman historian
Pliny suggested that the ostrich, then newly discovered, was
the result of a cross between a giraffe and a gnat. (It would, I
suppose, have to be a female giraffe and a male gnat.) In
practice there must be many such crosses which have not been
attempted because of a certain understandable lack of
motivation.
The chart that appears on page 26 will be referred to
repeatedly in this chapter. The solid curve on it shows the
times of earliest emergence of various major taxa. Many more
taxa exist, of course, than are shown by the few points in the
figure. But the curve is representative of the much denser
array of points that would be necessary to characterize the tens
of millions of separate taxa which have emerged during the
history of life on our planet. The major taxa, which have
evolved most recently, are by and large the most complicated.

13

Some notion of the complexity of an organism can be obtained
merely by considering its behavior-that is, the number of
different functions it is called upon to perform in its lifetime.
But complexity can also be judged by the minimum information
content in the organism's genetic material. A typical human
chromosome has one very long DNA molecule wound into coils,
so that the space it occupies is very much smaller than it would
be if it were unraveled. This DNA molecule is composed of
smaller building blocks, a little like the rungs and sides of a
rope ladder. These blocks are called nucleotides and come in
four varieties. The language of life, our hereditary information,
is determined by the sequence of the four different sorts of
nucleotides. We might say that the language of heredity is
written in an alphabet of only four letters.
But the book of life is very rich; a typical chromosomal DNA
molecule in a human being is composed of about five billion
pairs of nucleotides. The genetic instructions of all the other
taxa on Earth are written in the same language, with the same
code book. Indeed, this shared genetic language is one line of
evidence that all the organisms on Earth are descended from a
single ancestor, a single instance of the origin of life some four
billion years ago.
The information content of any message is usually described in
units called bits, which is short for "binary digits." The simplest
arithmetical scheme uses not ten digits (as we do because of
the evolutionary accident that we have ten fingers) but only
two, 0 and 1. Thus any sufficiently crisp question can be
answered by a single binary digit-0 or 1, yes or no. If the
genetic code were written in a language of two letters rather
than four letters, the number of bits in a DNA molecule would
equal twice the number of nucleotide pairs. But since there are
four different kinds of nucleotides, the number of bits of
information in DNA is four times the number of nucleotide
pairs. Thus if a single chromosome has five billion (5 X 109)
nucleotides, it contains twenty billion (2 X 1010) bits of
information. [A symbol such as 109 merely indicates a one
followed by a certain number of zeroes-in this case, nine of
them.]

14

How much information is twenty billion bits? What would be its
equivalent, if it were written down in an ordinary printed book
in a modern human language? Alphabetical human languages
characteristically have twenty to forty letters plus one or two
dozen numerals and punctuation marks; thus sixty-four
alternative characters should suffice for most such languages.
Since 2s equals 64 (2 X 2 X 2 X 2 X 2 X 2), it should take no
more than six bits to specify a given character. We can think of
this being done by a sort of game of "Twenty Questions," in
which each answer corresponds to the investment of a single
bit to a yes/no question. Suppose the character in question is
the letter J. We might specify it by the following procedure:
FIRST QUESTION: Is it a letter (0) or some other character
(1)?
ANSWER: A letter (0).
SECOND QUESTION: Is it in the first half (0) or the second half
of the alphabet
(1)? ANSWER: In the first half (0).
THIRD QUESTION: Of the thirteen letters in the first half of the
alphabet, is it in the first seven (0) or the second six (1)?
ANSWER: In the second six (1).
FOURTH QUESTION: In the second six (H, I, J, K,L, M), is it in
the first half (0) or the second half (1)?
ANSWER: In the first half (0).
FIFTH QUESTION: Of these letters H, I, J, is it H
(0) or .is it one of I and J (1)?
ANSWER: It is one of I and J (1).
SIXTH QUESTION: Is it I (0) or J (1)?
ANSWER: It is J (1).
Specifying the letter J is therefore equivalent to the binary
message, 001011. But it required not twenty questions but six,
and it is in this sense that only six bits are required to specify a
given letter. Therefore twenty billion bits are the equivalent of
about three billion letters (2 X 1010/6 = 3 X 109). If there are
approximately six letters in an average word, the information
content of a human chromosome corresponds to about five
hundred million words (3 X 109/6 = 5 X 108). If there are about

15

three hundred words on an ordinary page of printed type, this
corresponds to about two million pages (5 X 108/3 X 102 X
108). If a typical book contains five hundred such pages, the
information content of a single human chromosome corresponds
to some four thousand volumes (2 x 108/5 x 102 = 4 x 103). It
is clear, then, that the sequence of rungs on our DNA ladders
represents an enormous library of information. It is equally
clear that so rich a library is required to specify as exquisitely
constructed and intricately functioning an object as a human
being. Simple organisms have less complexity and less to do,
and therefore require a smaller amount of genetic information.
The Viking landers that put down on Mars in 1976 each had
preprogrammed instructions in their computers amounting to a
few million bits. Thus Viking had slightly more "genetic
information" than a bacterium, but significantly less than an
alga.
The chart on page 26 also shows the minimum amount of
genetic information in the DNA of various taxa. The amount
shown for mammals is less than for human beings, because
most mammals have less genetic information than human beings
do. Within certain taxa-for example, the amphibians-the
amount of genetic information varies wildly from species to
species, and it is thought that much of this DNA may be
redundant or functionless. This is the reason that the chart
displays the minimum amount of DNA for a given taxon.
We see from the chart that there was a striking improvement in
the information content of organisms on Earth some three
billion years ago, and a slow increase in the amount of genetic
information thereafter. We also see that if more than some tens
of billions (several times 1010) of bits of information are
necessary for human survival, extragenetic systems will have
to provide them: the rate of development of genetic systems is
so slow that no source of such additional biological information
can be sought in the DNA.
The raw materials of evolution are mutations, inheritable
changes in the particular nucleotide sequences that make up
the hereditary instructions in the DNA molecule. Mutations are
caused by radioactivity in the environment, by cosmic rays

16

from space, or, as often happens, randomly-by spontaneous
rearrangements of the nucleotides which statistically must
occur every now and then. Chemical bonds spontaneously
break. Mutations are also to some extent controlled by the
organism itself. Organisms have the ability to repair certain
classes of structural damage done to their DNA. There are, for
example, molecules which patrol the DNA for damage; when a
particularly egregious alteration in the DNA is discovered, it is
snipped out by a kind of molecular scissors, and the DNA put
right. But such repair is not and must not be perfectly efficient:
mutations are required for evolution. A mutation in a DNA
molecule within a chromosome of a skin cell in my index finger
has no influence on heredity. Fingers are not involved, at least
directly, in the propagation of the species. What counts are
mutations in the gametes, the eggs and sperm cells, which are
the agents of sexual reproduction.
Accidentally useful mutations provide the working material for
biological evolution-as, for example, a mutation for melanin in
certain moths, which changes their color from white to black.
Such moths commonly rest on English birch trees, where their
white coloration provides protective camouflage. Under these
conditions, the melanin mutation is not an advantage-the dark
moths are starkly visible and are eaten by birds; the mutation is
selected against. But when the Industrial Revolution began to
cover the birch bark with soot, the situation was reversed, and
only moths with the melanin mutation survived. Then the
mutation is selected for, and, in time, almost all the moths are
dark, passing this inheritable change on to future generations.
There are still occasional reverse mutations eliminating the
melanin adaptation, which would be useful for the moths were
English industrial pollution to be controlled. Note that in all this
interaction between mutation and natural selection, no moth is
making a conscious effort to adapt to a changed environment.
The process is random and statistical.
Large organisms such as human beings average about one
mutation per ten gametes-that is, there is a 10 percent chance
that any given sperm or egg cell produced will have a new and
inheritable change in the genetic instructions that determine the

17

makeup of the next generation. These mutations occur at
random and are almost uniformly harmful-it is rare that a
precision machine is improved by a random change in the
instructions for making it.
Most of these mutations are also recessive-they do not
manifest themselves immediately. Nevertheless, there is
already such a high mutation rate that, as several biologists
have suggested, a larger complement of genetic DNA would
bring about unacceptably high mutation rates: too much would
go wrong too often if we had more genes.* If this is true, there
must be a practical upper limit to the amount of genetic
information that the DNA of larger organisms can
accommodate. Thus large and complex organisms, by the mere
fact of their existence, have to have substantial resources of
extragenetic information. That information is contained, in all
higher animals except Man, almost exclusively in the brain.
What is the information content of the brain? Let us consider
two opposite and extreme poles of opinion on brain function. In
one view, the brain, or at least its outer layers, the cerebral
cortex, is equipotent: any part of it may substitute for any other
part, and there is no localization of function. In the other view,
the brain is completely hard-wired: specific cognitive functions
are localized in particular places in the brain. Computer design
suggests that the truth lies somewhere between these two
extremes. On the one hand, any nonmystical view of brain
function must connect physiology with anatomy; particular brain
functions must be tied to particular neural patterns or other
brain architecture. On the other hand, to assure accuracy and
protect against accident we would expect natural selection to
have evolved substantial redundancy in brain function. This is
also to be expected from the evolutionary path that it is most
likely the brain followed.
The redundancy of memory storage was clearly demonstrated
by Karl Lashley, a Harvard psycho-neurologist, who surgically
removed (extirpated) significant fractions of the cerebral cortex
of rats without noticeably affecting their recollection of
previously learned behavior on how to run mazes. From such

18

experiments it is clear that the same memory must be localized
in many different places in the brain, and we now know that
some memories are funneled between the left and right
cerebral hemispheres by a conduit called the corpus callosum.
(* To some extent the mutation rate is itself controlled by
natural selection, as in our example of a "molecular scissors."
But there is likely to be an irreducible minimum mutation rate
(1) in order to produce enough genetic experiments for natural
selection to operate on, and (2) as an equilibrium between
mutations produced, say, by cosmic rays and the most efficient
possible cellular repair mechanisms.)
Lashley also reported no apparent change in the general
behavior of a rat when significant fractions-say, 10 percent-of
its brain were removed. But no one asked the rat its opinion.
To investigate this question properly would require a detailed
study of rat social, foraging, and predator-evasion behavior.
There are many conceivable behavioral changes resulting from
such extirpations that might not be immediately obvious to the
casual scientist but that might be of considerable significance to
the rat-such as the amount of post-extirpation interest an
attractive rat of the opposite sex now elicits, or the degree of
disinterest now evinced by the presence of a stalking cat.*
It is sometimes argued that cuts or lesions in significant parts
of the cerebral cortex in humans-as by bilateral prefrontal
lobotomy or by an accident-have little effect on behavior. But
some sorts of human behavior are not very apparent from the
outside, or even from the inside. There are human perceptions
and activities that may occur only rarely, such as creativity.
The association of ideas involved in acts-even small ones-of
creative genius seems to imply substantial investments of brain
resources. These creative acts indeed characterize our entire
civilization and mankind as a species. Yet in many people they
occur only rarely, and their absence may be missed by neither
the brain damaged subject nor the inquiring physician.
(* Incidentally, as a test of the influence of animated cartoons
on American life, try rereading this paragraph with the word

19

"rat" replaced everywhere by "mouse," and see if your
sympathy for the surgically invaded and misunderstood beast
suddenly increases.)
While substantial redundancy in brain function is inevitable, the
strong equipotent hypothesis is almost certainly wrong, and
most contemporary neurophysiologists have rejected it. On the
other hand, a weaker equipotent hypothesis-holding, for
example, that memory is a function of the cerebral cortex as a
whole -is not so readily dismissible, although it is testable, as
we shall see.
There is a popular contention that half or more of the brain is
unused. From an evolutionary point of view this would be quite
extraordinary: why should it have evolved if it had no function?
But actually the statement is made on very little evidence.
Again, it is deduced from the finding that many lesions of the
brain, generally of the cerebral cortex, have no apparent effect
on behavior. This view does not take into account (1) the
possibility of redundant function; and (2) the fact that some
human behavior is subtle. For example, lesions in the right
hemisphere of the cerebral cortex may lead to impairments in
thought and action, but in the nonverbal realm, which is, by
definition, difficult for the patient or the physician to describe.
There is also considerable evidence for localization of brain
function. Specific brain sites below the cerebral cortex have
been found to be concerned with appetite, balance, thermal
regulation, the circulation of the blood, precision movements
and breathing. A classic study on higher brain function is the
work of the Canadian neurosurgeon, Wilder Penfield, on the
electrical stimulation of various parts of the cerebral cortex,
generally in attempts to relieve symptoms of a disease such as
psychomotor epilepsy. Patients reported a snatch of memory, a
smell from the past, a sound or color trace-all elicited by a
small electrical current at a particular site in the brain.
In a typical case, a patient might hear an orchestral composition
in full detail when current flowed through Penfield's electrode
to the patient's cortex, exposed after a craniotomy. If Penfield

20

indicated to the patient -who typically is fully conscious during
such procedures-that he was stimulating the cortex when he
was not, invariably the patient would report no memory trace at
that moment. But when, without notice, a current would flow
through the electrode into the cortex, a memory trace would
begin or continue. A patient might report a feeling tone, or a
sense of familiarity, or a full retrieval of an experience of many
years previous playing back in his mind, simultaneously but in
no conflict with his awareness of being in an operating room
conversing with a physician. While some patients described
these flashbacks as "little dreams," they contained none of the
characteristic symbolism of dream material. These experiences
have been reported almost exclusively by epileptics, and it is
possible, although it has by no means been demonstrated, that
non-epileptics are, under similar circumstances, subject to
comparable perceptual reminiscences.
In one case of electrical stimulation of the occipital lobe, which
is concerned with vision, the patient reported Seeing a
fluttering butterfly of such compelling reality that he stretched
out his hand from the operating table to catch it. In an identical
experiment performed on an ape, the animal peered intently, as
if at an object before him, made a swift catching motion with his
right hand, and then examined, in apparent bewilderment, his
empty fist.
Painless electrical stimulation of at least some human cerebral
cortices elicits cascades of memories of particular events. But
removal of the brain tissue in contact with the electrode does
not erase the memory. It is difficult to resist the conclusion that
at least in humans memories are stored somewhere in the
cerebral cortex, waiting for the brain to retrieve them by
electrical impulses-which, of course, are ordinarily generated
within the brain itself.
If memory is a function of the cerebral cortex as a whole-a
kind of dynamic reverberation or electrical standing wave
pattern of the constituent parts, rather than stored statically in
separate brain components- this would explain the survival of
memory after significant brain damage. The evidence, however,

21

points in the other direction: In experiments performed by the
American neurophysiologist Ralph Gerard at the University of
Michigan, hamsters were taught to run a simple maze and then
chilled almost to the freezing point in a refrigerator, a kind of
induced hibernation. The temperatures were so low that all
detectable electrical activity in the animals' brains ceased. If
the dynamic view of memory were true, the experiment should
have wiped out all memory of successful maze-running.
Instead, after thawing, the hamsters remembered. Memory
seems to be localized in specific sites in the brain, and the
survival of memories after massive brain lesions must be the
result of redundant storage of static memory traces in various
locales.
Penfield, extending the findings of previous researchers, also
uncovered a remarkable localization of function in the motor
cortex. Certain parts of the outer layers of our brain are
responsible for sending signals to or receiving signals from
specific parts of the body. A version of Penfield's maps of the
sensory and motor cortices appear on pages 36 and 37. It
reflects in an engaging way the relative importance of various
parts of our body. The enormous amount of brain area
committed to the fingers-particularly the thumb -and to the
mouth and the organs of speech corresponds precisely to what
in human physiology, through human behavior, has set us apart
from most of the other animals. Our learning and our culture
would never have developed without speech; our technology
and our monuments would never have evolved without hands. In
a way, the map of the motor cortex is an accurate portrait of
our humanity.
But the evidence for localization of function is now much
stronger even than this. In an elegant set of experiments, David
Hubel of Harvard Medical School discovered the existence of
networks of particular brain cells that respond selectively to
lines perceived by the eye in different orientations. There are
cells for horizontal, and cells for vertical, and cells for diagonal,
each of which is stimulated only if lines of the appropriate
orientation are perceived. At least some beginnings of abstract
thought have thereby been traced to the cells of the brain.

22

The existence of specific brain areas dealing with particular
cognitive, sensory or motor functions implies that there need
not be any perfect correlation between brain mass and
intelligence; some parts of the brain are clearly more important
than others. Among the most massive human brains on record
are those of Oliver Cromwell, Ivan Turgenev and Lord Byron,
all of whom were smart but no Albert Einsteins. Einstein's
brain, on the other hand, was not remarkably large. Anatole
France, who was brighter than many, had a brain half the size
of Byron's. The human baby is born with an exceptionally high
ratio of brain mass to body mass (about 12 percent); and the
brain, particularly the cerebral cortex, continues to grow
rapidly in the first three years of life-the period of most rapid
learning. By age six, the mass of the brain is 90 percent of its
adult value. The average mass of the brain of contemporary
men is about 1,375 grams, almost three pounds. Since the
density of the brain, like that of all body tissues, is about that of
water (one gram per cubic centimeter), the volume of such a
brain is 1,375 cubic centimeters, a little under a liter and a half.
(One cubic centimeter is about the volume of an adult human
navel.)
But the brain of a contemporary woman is about 150 cubic
centimeters smaller. When cultural and child-rearing biases are
taken into account, there is no clear evidence of overall
differences in intelligence between the sexes. Therefore, brain
mass differences of 150 grams in humans must be unimportant.
Comparable differences in brain mass exist among adults of
different human races (Orientals, on the average, have slightly
larger brains than whites); since no differences in intelligence
under similarly controlled conditions have been demonstrated
there, the same conclusion follows. And the gap between the
sizes of the brains of Lord Byron (2,200 grams) and Anatole
France (1,100 grams) suggests that, in this range, differences
of many hundreds of grams may be functionally unimportant.
On the other hand, adult human microcephalics, who are born
with tiny brains, have vast losses in cognitive abilities; their
typical brain masses are between 450 and 900 grams. A normal

23

newborn child has a typical brain mass of 350 grams; a
one-year-old, about 500 grams. It is clear that, as we consider
smaller and smaller brain masses, there comes a point where
the brain mass is so tiny that its function is severely impaired,
compared to normal adult human brain function.
Moreover, there is a statistical correlation between brain mass
or size and intelligence in human beings. The relationship is not
one-to-one, as the Byron-France comparison clearly shows.
We cannot tell a person's intelligence in any given case by
measuring his or her brain size. However, as the American
evolutionary biologist Leigh van Valen of the University of
Chicago has shown, the available data suggest a fairly good
correlation, on the average, between brain size and intelligence.
Does this mean that brain size in some sense causes
intelligence? Might it not be, for example, that malnutrition,
particularly in utero and in infancy, leads to both small brain
size and low intelligence, without the one causing the other?
Van Valen points out that the correlation between brain size
and intelligence is much better than the correlation between
intelligence and stature or adult body weight, which are known
to be influenced by malnutrition, and there is no doubt that
malnutrition can lower intelligence. Thus beyond such effects,
there appears to be an extent to which larger absolute brain
size tends to produce higher intelligence.
In exploring new intellectual territory, physicists have found it
useful to make order-of-magnitude estimates. These are rough
calculations that block out the problem and serve as guides for
future studies. They do not pretend to be highly accurate. In
the question of the connection between brain size and
intelligence, it is clearly far beyond present scientific abilities
to perform a census of the function of every cubic centimeter
of the brain. But might there not be some rough and
approximate way in which to connect brain mass with
intelligence?
The difference in brain mass between the sexes is of interest in
precisely this context, because women are systematically
smaller in size and have a lower body mass than men. With less

24

body to control, might not a smaller brain mass be adequate?
This suggests that a better measure of intelligence than the
absolute value of the mass of a brain is the ratio of the mass of
the brain to the total mass of the organism.
The chart on page 39 shows the brain masses and body masses
of various animals. There is a remarkable separation of fish and
reptiles from birds and mammals. For a given body mass or
weight, mammals have consistently higher brain mass. The
brains of mammals are ten to one hundred times more massive
than the brains of contemporary reptiles of comparable size.
The discrepancy between mammals and dinosaurs is even more
striking. These are stunningly large and completely systematic
differences. Since we are mammals, we probably have some
prejudices about the relative intelligence of mammals and
reptiles; but I think the evidence is quite compelling that
mammals are indeed systematically much more intelligent than
reptiles. (Also shown is an intriguing exception: a small
ostrich-like theropod class of dinosaurs from the late
Cretaceous Period, whose ratio of brain to body mass places
them just within the regional diagram otherwise restricted to
large birds and the less intelligent mammals. It would be
interesting to know much more about these creatures, which
have been studied by Dale Russell, chief of the Paleontology
Division of the National Museums of Canada.) We also see from
the chart on page 39 that the primates, a taxon that includes
man, are separated, but less systematically, from the rest of the
mammals; primate brains are on the average more massive by a
factor of about two to twenty than those of nonprimate
mammals of the same body mass.
When we look more closely at this chart, isolating a number of
particular animals, we see the results on page 40. Of all the
organisms shown, the beast with the largest brain mass for its
body weight is a creature called Homo sapiens. Next in such a
ranking are the dolphins.* Again I do not think it is chauvinistic
to conclude from evidence on their behavior that humans and
dolphins are at least among the most intelligent organisms on
Earth.

25

* By the criterion of brain mass to body mass, sharks are the
smartest of the fishes, which is consistent with their ecological
niche-predators have to be brighter than plankton browsers.
Both in their increasing ratio of brain to body mass and in the
development of coordinating centers in the three principal
components of their brains, sharks have evolved in a manner
curiously parallel to the evolution of higher vertebrates on the
land.
The importance of this ratio of brain to body mass had been
realized even by Aristotle. Its principal modern exponent has
been Harry Jerison, a neuro-psychiatrist at the University of
California at Los Angeles. Jerison points out that some
exceptions exist to our correlation-e. g., the European pygmy
shrew has a brain mass of 100 milligrams in a 4.7 gram body,
which gives it a mass ratio in the human range. But we cannot
expect the correlation of mass ratio with intelligence to apply
to the smallest animals, because the simplest "housekeeping"
functions of the brain must require some minimum brain mass.
The brain mass of a mature sperm whale, a close relative of the
dolphin, is almost 9,000 grams, six and a half times that of the
average man. It is unusual in total brain mass, not (compare
with the figure below) in ratio of brain to body weight. Yet the
largest dinosaurs had brain weight about 1 percent that of the
sperm whale. What does the whale do with so massive a brain?
Are there thoughts, insights, arts, sciences and legends of the
sperm whale?
The criterion of brain mass to body mass, which involves no
considerations of behavior, appears to provide a very useful
index of the relative intelligence of quite different animals. It is
what a physicist might describe as an acceptable first
approximation. (Note for future reference that the
Australopithecines, who were either ancestral to man or at
least close collateral relatives, also had a large brain mass for
their body-weight; this has been determined by making casts of
fossil braincases.) I wonder if the unaccountable general appeal
of babies and other small mammals- with relatively large heads
compared to adults of the same species- derives from our

26

unconscious awareness of the importance of brain to body mass
ratios.
The data so far in this discussion suggest that the evolution of
mammals from reptiles over two hundred million years ago was
accompanied by a major increase in relative brain size and
intelligence; and that the evolution of human beings from
nonhuman primates a few million years ago was accompanied
by an even more striking development of the brain.
The human brain (apart from the cerebellum, which does not
seem to be involved in cognitive functions) contains about ten
billion switching elements called neurons. (The cerebellum,
which lies beneath the cerebral cortex, toward the back of the
head, contains roughly another ten billion neurons.) The
electrical currents generated by and through the neurons or
nerve cells were the means by which the Italian anatomist Luigi
Galvani discovered electricity. Galvani had found that electrical
impulses could be conducted to the legs of frogs, which
dutifully twitched; and the idea became popular that animal
motion ("animation") was in its deepest sense caused by
electricity. This is at best a partial truth; electrical impulses
transmitted along nerve fibers do, through neurochemical
intermediaries, initiate such movements as the articulation of
limbs, but the impulses are generated in the brain.
Nevertheless, the modern science of electricity and the
electrical and electronic industries all trace their origins to
eighteenth-century experiments on the electrical stimulation of
twitches in frogs.
Only a few decades after Galvani, a group of literary
English-persons, immobilized in the Alps by inclement weather,
set themselves a competition to write a fictional work of
consummate horror. One of them, Mary Wollstonecraft Shelley,
penned the now-famous tale of Dr. Frankenstein's monster,
who is brought to life by the application of massive electrical
currents. Electrical devices have been a mainstay of gothic
novels and horror films ever since. The essential idea is
Galvani's and is fallacious, but the concept has insinuated itself

27

into many Western languages-as, for example, when I am
galvanized into writing this book.
Most neurobiologists believe that the neurons are the active
elements in brain function, although there is evidence that some
specific memories and other cognitive functions may be
contained in particular molecules in the brain, such as RNA or
small proteins. For every neuron in the brain there are roughly
ten glial cells (from the Greek word for glue), which provide the
scaffolding for the neuronal architecture. An average neuron in
a human brain has between ],000 and 10,000 synapses or links
with adjacent neurons. (Many spinal-cord neurons seem to
have about 10,000 synapses, and the so-called Purkinje cells of
the cerebellum may have still more. The number of links for
neurons in the cortex is probably less than 10,000.) If each
synapse responds by a single yes-or-no answer to an
elementary question, as is true of the switching elements in
electronic computers, the maximum number of yes/no answers
or bits of information that the brain could contain is about 1010
X 103 = 1013, or 10 trillion bits (or 100 trillion = 10" bits if we
had used 10* synapses per neuron). Some of these synapses
must contain the same information as is contained in other
synapses; some must be concerned with motor and other
noncognitive functions; and some may be merely blank, a buffer
waiting for the new day's information to flutter through.
If each human brain had only one synapse-corresponding to a
monumental stupidity-we would be capable of only two mental
states. If we had two synapses, then 22 - 4 states; three
synapses, then 23 = 8 states, and, in general, for N synapses,
2N states. But the human brain is characterized by some 1013
synapses. Thus the number of different states of a human brain
is 2 raised to this power-i. e., multiplied by itself ten trillion
times. This is an unimaginably large number, far greater, for
example, than the total number of elementary particles
(electrons and protons) in the entire universe, which is much
less than 1 raised to the power 103. It is because of this
immense number of functionally different configurations of the
human brain that no two humans, even identical twins raised
together, can ever be really very much alike. These enormous

28

numbers may also explain something of the unpredictability of
human behavior and those moments when we surprise even
ourselves by what we do. Indeed, in the face of these numbers,
the wonder is that there are any regularities at all in human
behavior. The answer must be that all possible brain states are
by no means occupied; there must be an enormous number of
mental configurations that have never been entered or even
glimpsed by any human being in the history of mankind. From
this perspective, each human being is truly rare and different
and the sanctity of individual human lives is a plausible ethical
consequence.
In recent years it has become clear that there are electrical
microcircuits in the brain. In these micro-circuits the
constituent neurons are capable of a much wider range of
responses than the simple "yes" or "no" of the switching
elements in electronic computers. The microcircuits are very
small in size (typical dimensions are about 1/10,000 of a
centimeter) and thus able to process data very rapidly. They
respond to about 11100th of the voltage necessary to stimulate
ordinary neurons, and are therefore capable of much finer and
subtler responses. Such microcircuits seem to increase in
abundance in a manner consistent with our usual notions about
the complexity of an animal, reaching their greatest
proliferation in both absolute and relative terms in human
beings. They also develop late in human embryology. The
existence of such microcircuits suggests that intelligence may
be the result not only of high brain-to-body-mass ratios but
also of an abundance of specialized switching elements in the
brain. Microcircuits make the number of possible brain states
even greater than we calculated in the previous paragraph, and
so enhance still farther the astonishing uniqueness of the
individual human brain.
We can approach the question of the information content of the
human brain in a quite different way- introspectively. Try to
imagine some visual memory, say from your childhood. Look at
it very closely in your mind's eye. Imagine it is composed of a
set of fine dots like a newspaper wirephoto. Each dot has a
certain color and brightness. You must now ask how many bits

29

of information are necessary to characterize the color and
brightness of each dot; how many dots make up the recalled
picture; and how long it takes to recall all the details of the
picture in the eye of the mind. In this retrospective, you focus
on a very small part of the picture at any one time; your field of
view is quite limited. When you put in all these numbers, you
come out with a rate of information processing by the brain, in
bits per second. When I do such a calculation, I come out with a
peak processing rate of about 5,000 bits per second.*
Most commonly such visual recollections concentrate on the
edges of forms and sharp changes from bright to dark, and not
on the configuration of areas of largely neutral brightness. The
frog, for example, sees with a very strong bias towards
brightness gradients. However, there is considerable evidence
that detailed memory of interiors and not just edges of forms is
reasonably common. Perhaps the most striking case is an
experiment with humans on stereo reconstruction of a
three-dimensional image, using a pattern recalled for one eye
and a pattern being viewed for the other. The fusion of images
in this anaglyph requires a memory of 10,000 picture elements.
* Horizon to horizon comprises an angle of 180 degrees in a flat
place. The moon is 0.5 degrees in diameter. I know I can see
detail on it, perhaps twelve picture elements across. Thus my
eye can resolve about 0.5/12 = 0.04 degrees. Anything smaller
than this is too small for me to see. The instantaneous field of
view in my mind's eye, as well as in my real eye, seems to be
something like 2 degrees on a side. Thus the little square
picture I can see at any given moment contains about (2/0.04)2
= 2,500 picture elements, corresponding to the wirephoto dots.
To characterize aft possible shades of gray and colors of such
dots requires about 20 bits per picture element. Thus a
description of my little picture requires 2,500 X 20 or about
50,000 bits. But the act of scanning the picture takes about 10
seconds, and thus my sensory data processing rate is probably
not much larger than 50,000/10 = 5,000 bits per second. For
comparison, the Viking lander cameras, which also have a 0.04
degree resolution, have only six bits per picture element to
characterize brightness, and can transmit these directly to

30

Earth by radio at 500 bits per second. The neurons of the brain
generate about 25 watts of power, barely enough to turn on a
small incandescent light. The Viking lander transmits radio
messages and performs all its other functions with a total
power of about 50 watts.
But I am not recollecting visual images all my waking hours, nor
am I continuously subjecting people and objects to intense and
careful scrutiny. I am doing that perhaps a small percent of the
time. My other information channels-auditory, tactile, olfactory
and gustatory-are involved with much lower transfer rates. I
conclude that the average rate of data processing by my brain
is about (5,000/50) = 100 bits per second. Over sixty years,
that corresponds to 2 x 1011 or 200 billion total bits committed
to visual and other memory if I have perfect recall. This is less
than, but not unreasonably less than, the number of synapses or
neural connections (since the brain has more to do than just
remember) and suggests that neurons are indeed the main
switching elements in brain function.
A remarkable series of experiments on brain changes during
learning has been performed by the American psychologist
Mark Rosenzweig and his colleagues at the University of
California at Berkeley. They maintained two different
populations of laboratory rats-one in a dull, repetitive,
impoverished environment; the other in a variegated, lively,
enriched environment. The latter group displayed a striking
increase in the mass and thickness of the cerebral cortex, as
well as accompanying changes in brain chemistry. These
increases occurred in mature as well as in young animals. Such
experiments demonstrate that physiological changes
accompany intellectual experience and show how plasticity can
be controlled anatomically. Since a more massive cerebral
cortex may make future learning easier, the importance of
enriched environments in childhood is clearly drawn.
This would mean that new learning corresponds to the
generation of new synapses or the activation of moribund old
ones, and some preliminary evidence consistent with this view
has been obtained by the American neuroanatomist William

31

Greenough of the University of Illinois and his coworkers. They
have found that after several weeks of learning new tasks in
laboratory contexts, rats develop the kind of new neural
branches in their cortices that form synapses. Other rats,
handled similarly but given no comparable education, exhibit no
such neuro-anatomical novelties. The construction of new
synapses requires the synthesis of protein and RNA molecules.
There is a great deal of evidence showing that these molecules
are produced in the brain during learning, and some scientists
have suggested that the learning is contained within brain
proteins or RNA. But it seems more likely that the new
information is contained in the neurons, which are in turn
constructed of proteins and RNA.
How densely packed is the information stored in the brain? A
typical information density during the operation of a modern
computer is about a million bits per cubic centimeter. This is
the total information content of the computer, divided by its
volume. The human brain contains, as we have said, about 1013
bits in a little more than 103 cubic centimeters, for an
information content of KP/IO3 = 1010, about ten billion bits per
cubic centimeter; the brain is therefore ten thousand times
more densely packed with information than is a computer,
although the computer is much larger. Put another way, a
modern computer able to process the information in the human
brain would have to be about ten thousand times larger in
volume than the human brain. On the other hand, modern
electronic computers are capable of processing information at a
rate of 1016 to 1017 bits per second, compared to a peak rate
ten billion times slower in the brain. The brain must be
extraordinarily cleverly packaged and "wired," with such a
small total information content and so low a processing rate, to
be able to do so many significant tasks so much better than the
best computer.
The number of neurons in an animal brain does not double as
the brain volume itself doubles. It increases more slowly. A
human brain with a volume of about 1,375 cubic centimeters
contains, as we have said, apart from the cerebellum about ten
billion neurons and some ten trillion bits. In a laboratory at the

32

National Institute of Mental Health near Bethesda, Maryland, I
recently held in my hand a rabbit brain. It had a volume of
perhaps thirty cubic centimeters, the size of an average radish,
corresponding to a few hundred million neurons and some
hundred billion bits-which controlled, among other things, the
munching of lettuce, the twitchings of noses, and the sexual
dalliances of grownup rabbits.
Since animal taxa such as mammals, reptiles or amphibians
contain members with very different brain sizes, we cannot give
a reliable estimate of the number of neurons in the brain of a
typical representative of each taxon. But we can estimate
average values which I have done in the chart on page 26. The
rough estimates there show that a human being has about a
hundred times more bits of information in his brain than a rabbit
does. I do not know that it means very much to say that a
human being is a hundred times smarter than a rabbit, but I am
not certain that it is a ridiculous contention. (It does not, of
course, follow that a hundred rabbits are as smart as one
human being.)
We are now in a position to compare the gradual increase
through evolutionary time of both the amount of information
contained in the genetic material and the amount of information
contained in the brains of organisms. The two curves cross (p.
26) at a time corresponding to a few hundred million years ago
and at an information content corresponding to a few billion
bits. Somewhere in the steaming jungles of the Carboniferous
Period there emerged an organism that for the first time in the
history of the world had more information in its brains than in
its genes. It was an early reptile which, were we to come upon
it in these sophisticated times, we would probably not describe
as exceptionally intelligent. But its brain was a symbolic turning
point in the history of life. The two subsequent bursts of brain
evolution, accompanying the emergence of mammals and the
advent of manlike primates, were still more important advances
in the evolution of intelligence. Much of the history of life since
the Carboniferous Period can be described as the gradual (and
certainly incomplete) dominance of brains over genes.

3 THE BRAIN AND THE CHARIOT
When shall we three meet again . . . ?
WM. SHAKESPEARE Macbeth
THE BRAIN of a fish isn't much. A fish has a notochord or
spinal cord, which it shares with even humbler invertebrates. A
primitive fish also has a little swelling at the front end of the
spinal cord, which is its brain. In higher fish the swelling is
further developed but still weighs no more than a gram or two.
That swelling corresponds in higher animals to the hindbrain or
brainstem and the midbrain. The brain of modern fish are
chiefly midbrain, with a tiny forebrain; in modern amphibians
and reptiles, it is the other way around (see figure on page 55).
And yet fossil endocasts of the earliest known vertebrates
show that the principal divisions of the modern brain
(hind-brain, midbrain and forebrain, for example) were already
established. Five hundred million years ago, swimming in the
primeval seas, there were fishy creatures called ostracoderms
and placoderms, whose brains had recognizably the same major
divisions as ours. But the relative size and importance of these
components, and even their early functions, were certainly very
different from today. One of the most engaging views of the
subsequent evolution of the brain is a story of the successive
accretion and specialization of three further layers surmounting
the spinal cord, hindbrain and midbrain. After each evolutionary
step, the older portions of the brain still exist and must still be
accommodated. But a new layer with new functions has been
added.
The principal contemporary exponent of this view is Paul
MacLean, chief of the Laboratory of Brain Evolution and
Behavior of the National Institute of Mental Health. One
hallmark of MacLean's work is that it encompasses many
different animals, ranging from lizards to squirrel monkeys.
Another is that he and his colleagues have studied carefully the
social and other behavior of these animals to improve their

34

prospects of discovering what part of the brain controls what
sort of behavior.
Squirrel monkeys with "gothic" facial markings have a kind of
ritual or display which they perform when greeting one another.
The males bare their teeth, rattle the bars of their cage, utter a
high-pitched squeak, which is possibly terrifying to squirrel
monkeys, and lift their legs to exhibit an erect penis. While
such behavior would border on impoliteness at many
contemporary human social gatherings, it is a fairly elaborate
act and serves to maintain dominance hierarchies in
squirrel-monkey communities.
MacLean has found that a lesion in one small part of a squirrel
monkey's brain will prevent this display while leaving a wide
range of other behavior intact, including sexual and combative
behavior. The part that is involved is in the oldest part of the
forebrain, a part that humans as well as other primates share
with out mammalian and reptilian ancestors. In non-primate
mammals and in reptiles, comparable ritualized behavior seems
to be controlled in the same part of the brain, and lesions in this
reptilian component can impair other automatic types of
behavior besides ritual-for example, walking or running.
The connection between sexual display and position in a
dominance hierarchy can be found frequently among the
primates. Among Japanese macaques, social class is maintained
and reinforced by daily mounting: males of lower caste adopt
the characteristic submissive sexual posture of the female in
oestrus and are briefly and ceremonially mounted by
higher-caste males. These mountings are both common and
perfunctory. They seem to have little sexual content but rather
serve as easily understood symbols of who is who in a complex
society.
In one study of the behavior of the squirrel monkey, Caspar, the
dominant animal in the colony and by far the most active
displayer, was never seen to copulate, although he accounted
for two-thirds of the genital display in the colony-most of it
directed toward other adult males. The fact that Caspar was

35

highly motivated to establish dominance but insignificantly
motivated toward sex suggests that while these two functions
may involve identical organ systems, they are quite separate.
The scientists studying this colony concluded: "Genital display
is therefore considered the most effective social signal with
respect to group hierarchy. It is ritualized and seems to acquire
the meaning, 'I am the master.' It is most probably derived from
sexual activity, but it is used for social communication and
separated from reproductive activity. In other words, genital
display is a ritual derived from sexual behavior but serving
social and not reproductive purposes."
In a television interview in 1976, a professional football player
was asked by the talk-show host if it was embarrassing for
football players to be together in the locker room with no
clothes on. His immediate response: "We strut! No
embarrassment at all. It's as if we're saying to each other,
'Let's see what you got, man!'-except for a few, like the
specialty team members and the water boy."
The behavioral as well as neuroanatomical connections
between sex, aggression and dominance are borne out in a
variety of studies. The mating rituals of great cats and many
other animals are barely distinguishable, in their early stages,
from fighting. It is a commonplace that domestic cats
sometimes purr loudly and perversely while their claws are
slowly raking over upholstery or lightly clad human skin. The
use of sex to establish and maintain dominance is sometimes
evident in human heterosexual and homosexual practices
(although it is not, of course, the only element in such
practices), as well as in many "obscene" utterances. Consider
the peculiar circumstance that the most common two-word
verbal aggression in English, and in many other languages,
refers to an act of surpassing physical pleasure; the English
form probably comes from a Germanic and Middle Dutch verb
fok-ken, meaning "to strike." This otherwise puzzling usage can
be understood as a verbal equivalent of macaque symbolic
language, with the initial word "I" unstated but understood by
both parties. It and many similar expressions seem to be human
ceremonial mountings. As we will see, such behavior probably

36

extends much farther back than the monkeys, back through
hundreds of millions of years of geological time.
From experiments such as those with squirrel monkeys,
MacLean has developed a captivating model of brain structure
and evolution that he calls the triune brain. "We are obliged," he
says, "to look at ourselves and the world through the eyes of
three quite different mentalities," two of which lack the power
of speech. The human brain, MacLean holds, "amounts to three
interconnected biological computers," each with "its own
special intelligence, its own subjectivity, its own sense of time
and space, its own memory, motor, and other functions." Each
brain corresponds to a separate major evolutionary step. The
three brains are said to be distinguished neuroanatomically and
functionally, and contain strikingly different distributions of the
neurochemicals dopamine and cholinesterase.
At the most ancient part of the human brain lies the spinal cord;
the medulla and pons, which comprise the hindbrain; and the
midbrain. This combination of spinal cord, hindbrain and
midbrain MacLean calls the neural chassis. It contains the basic
neural machinery for reproduction and self-preservation,
including regulation of the heart, blood circulation and
respiration. In a fish or an amphibian it is almost all the brain
there is. But a reptile or higher animal deprived of its forebrain
is, according to MacLean, "as motionless and aimless as an
idling vehicle without a driver."
Indeed, grand mal epilepsy can, I think, be described as a
disease in which the cognitive drivers are. all turned off
because of a kind of electrical storm in the brain, and the victim
is left momentarily with nothing operative but his neural
chassis. This is a profound impairment, temporarily regressing
the victim back several hundreds of millions of years. The
ancient Greeks, whose name for the disease we still use,
recognized its profound character and called it the disease
inflicted by the gods.
MacLean has distinguished three sorts of drivers of the neural
chassis. The most ancient of them surrounds the midbrain (and

37

is made up mostly of what neuroanatomists call the
olfactostriatum, the corpus striatum, and the globus pallidus).
We share it with the other mammals and the reptiles. It
probably evolved several hundred million years ago. MacLean
calls it the reptilian or R-complex. Surrounding the R-complex
is the limbic system, so called because it borders on the
underlying brain. (Our arms and legs are called limbs because
they are peripheral to the rest of the body.) We share the
limbic system with the other mammals but not, in its full
elaboration, with the reptiles. It probably evolved more than
one hundred and fifty million years ago. Finally, surmounting
the rest of the brain, and clearly the most recent evolutionary
accretion, is the neocortex. Like the higher mammals and the
other primates, humans have a relatively massive neocortex. It
becomes progressively more developed in the more advanced
mammals. The most elaborately developed neocortex is ours
(and the dolphins' and whales'). It probably evolved several
tens of millions of years ago, but its development accelerated
greatly a few million years ago when humans emerged. A
schematic representation of this picture of the human brain is
shown opposite, and a comparison of the limbic system with the
neocortex in three contemporary mammals is shown above.
The concept of the triune brain is in remarkable accord with the
conclusions, drawn independently from studies of biain ₩o
body mass ratios in the previous chapter, that the emergence of
mammals and of primates (especially humans) was accompanied
by major bursts in brain evolution.
It is very difficult to evolve by altering the deep fabric of life;
any change there is likely to be lethal. But fundamental change
can be accomplished by the addition of new systems on top of
old ones. This is reminiscent of a doctrine which was called
recapitulation by Ernst Haeckel, a nineteenth-century German
anatomist, and which has gone through various cycles of
scholarly acceptance and rejection. Haeckel held that in its
embryological development, an animal tends to repeat or
recapitulate the sequence that its ancestors followed during
their evolution. And indeed in human intrauterine development
we run through stages very much like fish, reptiles and
nonprimate mammals before we become recognizably human.

38

The fish stage even has gill slits, which are absolutely useless
for the embryo who is nourished via the umbilical cord, but a
necessity for human embryology: since gills were vital to our
ancestors, we run through a gill stage in becoming human. The
brain of a human fetus also develops from the inside out, and,
roughly speaking, runs through the sequence: neural chassis,
R-complex, limbic system and neocortex.
The reason for recapitulation may be understood as follows:
Natural selection operates only on individuals, not on species
and not very much on eggs or fetuses. Thus the latest
evolutionary change appears postpartum. The fetus may have
characteristics, like the gill slits in mammals, that are entirely
maladaptive after birth, but as long as they cause no serious
problems for the fetus and are lost before birth, they can be
retained. Our gill slits are vestiges not of ancient fish but of
ancient fish embryos. Many new organ systems develop not by
the addition and preservation but by the modification of older
systems, as, for example, the modification of fins to legs, and
legs to flippers or wings; or feet to hands to feet; or sebaceous
glands to mammary glands; or gill arches to ear bones; or shark
scales to shark teeth. Thus evolution by addition and the
functional preservation of the preexisting structure must occur
for one of two reasons-either the old function is required as
well as the new one, or there is no way of bypassing the old
system that is consistent with survival.
There are many other examples in nature of this sort of
evolutionary development. To take an almost random case,
consider why plants are green. Green-plant photosynthesis
utilizes light in the red and the violet parts of the solar
spectrum to break down water, build up carbohydrates and do
other planty things. But the sun gives off more light in the
yellow and the green part of the spectrum than in the red or
violet. Plants with chlorophyll as their only photosynthetic
pigment are rejecting light where it is most plentiful. Many
plants seem belatedly to have "noticed" this and have made
appropriate adaptations. Other pigments, which reflect red light
and absorb yellow and green light, such as carotenoids and
phycobilins, have evolved. Well and good. But have those plants

39

with new photo-synthetic pigments abandoned chlorophyll?
They have not. The figure on page 61 shows the photosynthetic
factory of a red alga. The striations contain the chlorophyll, and
the little spheres nestling against these striations contain the
phycobilins, which make a red alga red. Conservatively, these
plants pass along the energy they acquire from green and
yellow sunlight to the chlorophyll pigment that, even though it
has not absorbed the light, is still instrumental in bridging the
gap between light and chemistry in all plant photosynthesis.
Nature could not rip out the chlorophyll and replace it with
better pigments; the chlorophyll is woven too deeply into the
fabric of life. Plants with accessory pigments are surely
different. They are more efficient. But there, still working,
although with diminished responsibilities, at the core of the
photosynthetic process is chlorophyll. The evolution of the
brain has, I think, proceeded analogously. The deep and ancient
parts are functioning still.
1 THE R-COMPLEX
If the preceding view is correct, we should expect the
R-complex in the human brain to be in some sense performing
dinosaur functions still; and the limbic cortex to be thinking the
thoughts of pumas and ground sloths. Without a doubt, each
new step in brain evolution is accompanied by changes in the
physiology of the preexisting components of the brain. The
evolution of the R-complex must have seen changes in the
midbrain, and so on. What is more, we know that the control of
many functions is shared in different components of the brain.
But at the same time it would be astonishing if the brain
components beneath the neocortex were not to a significant
extent still performing as they did in our remote ancestors.
MacLean has shown that the R-complex plays an important role
in aggressive behavior, territoriality, ritual and the
establishment of social hierarchies. Despite occasional welcome
exceptions, this seems to me to characterize a great deal of
modern human bureaucratic and political behavior. I do not
mean that the neocortex is not functioning at all in an American
political convention or a meeting of the Supreme Soviet; after
all, a great deal of the communication at such rituals is verbal

40

and therefore neocortical. But it is striking how much of our
actual behavior-as distinguished from what we say and think
about it- can be described in reptilian terms. We speak
commonly of a "cold-blooded" killer. Machiavelli's advice to his
Prince was "knowingly to adopt the beast."
In an interesting partial anticipation of these ideas, the
American philosopher Susanne Langer wrote: "Human life is
shot through and through with ritual, as it is also with animalian
practices. It is an intricate fabric of reason and rite, of
knowledge and religion, prose and poetry, fact and dream. . . .
Ritual, like art, is essentially the active termination of a
symbolic transformation of experience. It is born in the cortex,
not in the 'old brain'; but it is born of an elementary need of
that organ, once the organ has grown to human estate." Except
for the fact that the R-complex is in the "old brain," this seems
to be right on target.
I want to be very clear about the social implications of the
contention that reptilian brains influence human actions. If
bureaucratic behavior is controlled at its core by the
R-complex, does this mean there is no hope for the human
future? In human beings, the neo-cortex represents about 85
percent of the brain, which is surely some index of its
importance compared to the brainstem, R-complex and limbic
system. Neuro-anatomy, political history, and introspection all
offer evidence that human beings are quite capable of resisting
the urge to surrender to every impulse of the reptilian brain.
There is no way, for example, in which the Bill of Rights of the
U.S. Constitution could have been recorded, much less
conceived, by the R-complex. It is precisely our plasticity, our
long childhood, that prevents a slavish adherence to genetically
preprogrammed behavior in human beings more than in any
other species. But if the triune brain is an accurate model of
how human beings function, it does no good whatever to ignore
the reptilian component of human nature, particularly our
ritualistic and hierarchical behavior, On the contrary, the model
may help us to understand what human beings are about. (I
wonder, for example, whether the ritual aspects of many
psychotic illnesses-e. g., hebephrenic schizophrenia-could be

41

the result of hyperactivity of some center in the R-complex, or
of a failure of some neocortical site whose function is to
repress or override the R-complex. I also wonder whether the
frequent ritualistic behavior in young children is a consequence
of the still-incomplete development of their neocortices.)
In a curiously apt passage, G. K. Chesterton wrote: "You can
free things from alien or accidental laws, but not from the laws
of their own nature. . . . Do not go about . . . encouraging
triangles to break out of the prison of their three sides. If a
triangle breaks out of its three sides, its life comes to a
lamentable end." But not all triangles are equilateral. Some
substantial adjustment of the relative role of each component of
the triune brain is well within our powers.
2 THE LIMBIC SYSTEM
The limbic system appears to generate strong or particularly
vivid emotions. This immediately suggests an additional
perspective on the reptilian mind: it is not characterized by
powerful passions and wrenching contradictions but rather by a
dutiful and stolid acquiescence to whatever behavior its genes
and brains dictate.
Electrical discharges in the limbic system sometimes result in
symptoms similar to those of psychoses or those produced by
psychedelic or hallucinogenic drugs. In fact, the sites of action
of many psychotropic drugs are in the limbic system. Perhaps it
controls exhilaration and awe and a variety of subtle emotions
that we sometimes think of as uniquely human.
The "master gland," the pituitary, which influences other glands
and dominates the human endocrine system, is an intimate part
of the limbic region. The mood-altering qualities of endocrine
imbalances give us an important hint about the connection of
the limbic system with states of mind. There is a small
almond-shaped inclusion in the limbic system called the
amygdala which is deeply involved in both aggression and fear.
Electrical stimulation of the amygdala in placid domestic

42

animals can rouse them to almost unbelievable states of fear or
frenzy. In one case, a house cat cowered in terror when
presented with a small white mouse. On the other hand,
naturally ferocious animals, such as the lynx, become docile
and tolerate being petted and handled when their amygdalas are
extirpated. Malfunctions in the limbic system can produce rage,
fear or sentimentality that have no apparent cause. Natural
hyperstimulation may produce the same results: those suffering
from such a malady find their feelings inexplicable and
inappropriate; they may be considered mad.
At least some of the emotion-determining role of such limbic
endocrine systems as the pituitary amygdala, and hypothalamus
is provided by small hormonal proteins which they exude, and
which affect other areas of the brain. Perhaps the best-known
is the pituitary protein,. ACTH (adrenocorticotropic hormone),
which can affect such diverse mental functions as visual
retention, anxiety and attention span. Some small hypothalamic
proteins have been identified tentatively in the third ventricle of
the brain, which connects the hypothalamus with the thalamus,
a region also within the limbic system. The stunning pictures on
page 65, taken with an electron microscope, show two
close-ups of action in the third ventricle. The diagram on page
73 may help clarify some of the brain anatomy just described.
There are reasons to think that the beginnings of altruistic
behavior are in the limbic system. Indeed, with rare exceptions
(chiefly the social insects), mammals and birds are the only
organisms to devote substantial attention to the care of their
young-an evolutionary development that, through the long
period of plasticity which it permits, takes advantage of the
large information-processing capability of the mammalian and
primate brains. Love seems to be an invention of the
mammals.*
* This rule on the relative parental concern of mammals and
reptiles is, however, by no means without exceptions. Nile
crocodile mothers carefully put their fresh hatchlings in their
mouths and carry them to the comparative safety of the river
waters; while Serengeti male lions will, upon newly dominating

43

a pride, destroy all the resident cubs. But on the whole,
mammals show a strikingly greater degree of parental care than
do reptiles. The distinction may have been even more striking
one hundred million years ago.
Much in animal behavior substantiates the notion that strong
emotions evolved chiefly in mammals and to a lesser extent in
birds. The attachment of domestic animals to humans is, I think,
beyond question. The apparently sorrowful behavior of many
mammalian mothers when their young are removed is
well-known. One wonders just how far such emotions go. Do
horses on occasion have glimmerings of patriotic fervor? Do
dogs feel for humans something akin to religious ecstasy? What
other strong or subtle emotions are felt by animals that do not
communicate with us?
The oldest part of the limbic system is the olfactory cortex,
which is related to smell, the haunting emotional quality of
which is familiar to most humans. A major component of our
ability to remember and recall is localized in the hippocampus,
a structure within the limbic system. The connection is clearly
shown by the profound memory impairment that results from
lesions of the hippocampus. In one famous case, H. M., a patient
with a long history of seizures and convulsions, was subjected
to a bilateral extirpation of the entire region about the
hippocampus in a successful attempt to reduce their frequency
and severity. He immediately became amnesic. He retained
good perceptual skills, was able to learn new motor skills and
experienced some perceptual learning but essentially forgot
everything more than a few hours old. His own comment was
"Every day is alone in itself-whatever enjoyment I've had and
whatever sorrow I've had." He described his life as a
continuous extension of the feeling of disorientation many of us
have upon awakening from a dream, when we have great
difficulty remembering what has just happened. Remarkably
enough, despite this severe impairment, his IQ improved after
his hippocampectomy. He apparently could detect smells but
had difficulty identifying by name the source of the smell. He
also exhibited an apparent total disinterest in sexual activity.

44

In another case, a young American airman was injured in a
mock duel with another serviceman, when a miniature fencing
foil was plunged into his right nostril, puncturing a small part of
the limbic system immediately above. This resulted in a severe
impairment of memory, similar to but not so severe as H. M.'s;
a wide range of his perceptual and intellectual abilities was
unaffected. His memory impairment was particularly noticeable
with verbal material. In addition, the accident seems to have
rendered him both impotent and unresponsive to pain. He once
walked barefoot on the sun-heated metal deck of a cruise ship,
without realizing that his feet were being badly burned until his
fellow passengers complained of the uncomfortable odor of
charring flesh. On his own, he was aware of neither the pain
nor the smell.
From such cases, it seems apparent that so complex a
mammalian activity as sex is controlled simultaneously by all
three components of the triune brain-the R-complex, the limbic
system and the neocortex. (We have already mentioned the
involvement of the R-complex and the limbic system in sexual
activity. Evidence for involvement of the neocortex can be
easily obtained by introspection.)
One segment of the old limbic system is devoted to oral and
gustatory functions; another, to sexual functions. The
connection of sex with smell is very ancient, and is highly
developed in insects-a circumstance that offers insight into
both the importance and the disadvantages of reliance on smell
in our remote ancestors.
I once witnessed an experiment in which the head of a green
bottle fly was connected by a very thin wire to an oscilloscope
that displayed, in a kind of graph, any electrical impulses
produced by the fly's olfactory system. (The fly's head had only
recently been severed from its body-in order to gain access to
the olfactory apparatus-and was still in many respects
functional.*) The experimenters wafted a wide variety of odors
in front of it, including obnoxious and irritating gases such as
ammonia, with no discernible effects. The line traced out on the
oscilloscope screen was absolutely flat and horizontal. Then a

45

tiny quantity of the sex attractant released by the female of the
species was waved before the severed head, and an enormous
vertical spike obligingly appeared on the oscilloscope screen.
The bottle fly could smell almost nothing except the female sex
attractant. But that molecule he could smell exceedingly well.
* The heads and bodies of anthropods can briefly function
without each other very nicely. A female praying mantis will
often respond to earnest courting by decapitating her suitor.
While this would be viewed as unsociable among humans, it is
not so among insects: extirpation of the brain removes sexual
inhibitions and encourages what is left of the male to mate.
Afterwards, the female completes her celebratory repast,
dining, of course, alone. Perhaps this represents a cautionary
lesson against excessive sexual repression.
Such olfactory specialization is quite common in insects. The
male silkworm moth is able to detect the female's sex attractant
molecule if only about forty molecules per second reach its
feathery antennae. A single female silkworm moth need release
only a hundredth of a microgram of sex attractant per second to
attract every male silkworm in a volume of about a cubic mile.
That is why there are silkworms.
Perhaps the most curious exploitation of the reliance on smell
to find a mate and continue the species is found in a South
African beetle, which burrows into the ground during the
winter. In the spring, as the ground thaws, the beetles emerge,
but the male beetles groggily disinter themselves a few weeks
before the females do. In this same region of South Africa, a
species of orchid has evolved which gives off an aroma
identical to the sex attractant of the female beetle. In fact,
orchid and beetle evolution have produced essentially the same
molecule. The male beetles turn out to be exceedingly
nearsighted; and the orchids have evolved a configuration of
their petals that, to a myopic beetle, resembles the female in a
receptive sexual posture. The male beetles enjoy several
weeks of orgiastic ecstasy among the orchids, and when
eventually the females emerge from the ground, we can
imagine a great deal of wounded pride and righteous

46

indignation. Meanwhile the orchids have been successfully
cross-pollinated by the amorous male beetles, who, now
properly abashed, do their best to continue the beetle species;
and both organisms survive. (Incidentally, it is in the interest of
the orchids not to be too consummately attractive; if the
beetles fail to reproduce themselves, the orchids are in
trouble.) We thus discover one limitation to purely olfactory
sexual stimuli. Another is that since every female beetle
produces the same sex attractant, it is not easy for a male
beetle to fall in love with the lady insect of his heart's desire.
While male insects may display themselves to attract a female,
or-as with stag beetles-engage in mandible-to-mandible
combat with the female as the prize, the central role of the
female sex attractant in mating seems to reduce the extent of
sexual selection among the insects.
Other methods of finding a mate have been developed in
reptiles, birds and mammals. But the connection of sex with
smell is still apparent neuro-anatomically in higher animals as
well as anecdotally in human experience. I sometimes wonder if
deodorants, particularly "feminine" deodorants, are an attempt
to disguise sexual stimuli and keep our minds on something
else.
3 THE NEOCORTEX
Even in fish, lesions of the forebrain destroy the traits of
initiative and caution. In higher animals these traits, much
elaborated, seem localized in the neo-cortex, the site of many
of the characteristic human cognitive functions. It is frequently
discussed in terms of four major regions or lobes: the frontal,
parietal, temporal and occipital lobes. Early neurophysiologists
held that the neocortex was primarily connected only to other
places in the neocortex, but it is now Known that there are
many neural connections with the sub-cortical brain. It is,
however, by no means clear that the neocortical subdivisions
are actually functional units. Each certainly has many quite
different functions, and some functions may be shared among
or between lobes. Among other functions, the frontal lobes
seem to be connected with deliberation and the regulation of

47

action; the parietal lobes, with spatial perception and the
exchange of information between the brain and the rest of the
body; the temporal lobes, with a variety of complex perceptual
tasks; and the occipital lobes, with vision, the dominant sense
in humans and other primates.
For many decades the prevailing view of neurophysiologists
was that the frontal lobes, behind the forehead, are the sites of
anticipation and planning for the future, both characteristically
human functions. But more recent work has shown that the
situation is not so simple. A large number of cases of frontal
lesions-largely suffered in warfare and as gunshot
wounds-have been investigated by the American
neurophysiologist Hans-Lukas Teuber of the Massachusetts
Institute of Technology. He found that many frontal-lobe
lesions have almost no obvious effects on behavior; however, in
severe pathology of the frontal lobes "the patient is not
altogether devoid of capacity to anticipate a course of events,
but cannot picture himself in relation to those events as a
potential agent." Teuber emphasized the fact that the frontal
lobe may be involved in motor as well as cognitive anticipation,
particularly in estimating what the effect of voluntary
movements will be. The frontal lobes also seem to be
implicated in the connection between vision and erect bipedal
posture.
Thus the frontal lobes may be involved with peculiarly human
functions in two different ways. If they control anticipation of
the future, they must also be the sites of concern, the locales of
worry. This is why transection of the frontal lobes reduces
anxiety. But prefrontal lobotomy must also greatly reduce the
patient's capacity to be human. The price we pay for
anticipation of the future is anxiety about it. Foretelling disaster
is probably not much fun; Pollyanna was much happier than
Cassandra. But the Cassandric components of our nature are
necessary for survival. The doctrines for regulating the future
that they produced are the origins of ethics, magic, science and
legal codes. The benefit of foreseeing catastrophe is the ability
to take steps to avoid it, sacrificing short-term for long-term
benefits. A society that is, as a result of such foresight,

48

materially secure generates the leisure time necessary for
social and technological innovation.
The other suspected function of the frontal lobes is to make
possible mankind's bipedal posture. Our upright stance may not
have been possible before the development of the frontal lobes.
As we shall see later in more detail, standing on our own two
feet freed our hands for manipulation, which then led to a major
accretion of human cultural and physiological traits. In a very
real sense, civilization may be a product of the frontal lobes.
Visual information from the eyes arrives in the human brain
chiefly in the occipital lobe, in the back of the head; auditory
impressions, in the upper part of the temporal lobe, beneath the
temple. There is fragmentary evidence that these components
of the neo-cortex are substantially less well developed in blind
deaf-mutes. Lesions in the occipital lobe-as produced by
gunshot wounds, for example-frequently induce an impairment
in the field of vision. The victim may be in all other respects
normal but able to see only with peripheral vision, perceiving a
solid, dark blot looming in front of him at the center of the
normal field of view. In other cases, more bizarre perceptions
follow, including geometrically regular, cursive floating
impairments in the visual field, and "visual fits" in which (for
example) objects on the floor to the patient's lower right are
momentarily perceived as floating in the air to his upper left
and rotated 180 degrees through space. It may even be
possible to map which parts of the occipital lobes are
responsible for which visual functions by systematically
calculating the impairments of vision from various occipital
lesions. Permanent impairments of vision are much less likely
to occur in the very young, whose brains seem able to repair
themselves or transfer functions to neighboring regions very
well.
The ability to connect auditory with visual stimuli is also
localized in the temporal lobe. Lesions in the temporal lobe can
result in a form of aphasia, the inability to recognize spoken
words. It is remarkable and significant that brain-damaged
patients can be completely competent in spoken language and

49

entirely incompetent in written language, or vice versa. They
may be able to write but unable to read; able to read numbers
but not letters; able to name objects but not colors. There is in
the neocortex a striking separation of function, which is
contrary to such common-sense notions as that reading and
writing, or recognizing words and numbers, are very similar
activities. There are also as yet unconfirmed reports of brain
damage that results only in the inability to understand the
passive voice or prepositional phrases or possessive
constructions. (Perhaps the locale of the subjunctive mood will
one day be found. Will Latins turn out to be extravagantly
endowed and English-speaking peoples significantly
short-changed in this minor piece of brain anatomy?) Various
abstractions, including the "parts of speech" in grammar, seem,
astonishingly, to be wired into specific regions of the brain.
In one case, a temporal-lobe lesion resulted in a surprising
impairment in the patient's perception of faces, even the faces
of his immediate family. Presented with the face on this page,
he described it as "possibly" being an apple. Asked to justify
this interpretation, he identified the mouth as a cut in the apple,
the nose as the stem of the apple folded back on its surface,
and the eyes as two worm holes. The same patient was
perfectly able to recognize sketches of houses and other
inanimate objects. A wide range of experiments shows that
lesions in the right temporal lobe produce amnesia for certain
types of nonverbal material, while lesions in the left temporal
lobe produce a characteristic loss of memory for language.
Our ability to read and make maps, to orient ourselves spatially
in three dimensions and to use the appropriate symbols-all of
which are probably involved in the development if not the use
of language -are severely impaired by lesions in the parietal
lobes, near the top of the head. One soldier who suffered a
massive wartime penetration of the parietal lobe was for a full
year unable to orient his feet into his slippers, much less find
his bed in the hospital ward. He nevertheless eventually
experienced an almost complete recovery.
A lesion of the angular gyrus of the neocortex, in the parietal
lobe, results in alexia, the inability to recognize the printed

50

word. The parietal lobe appears to be involved in all human
symbolic language and, of all the brain lesions, a lesion in the
parietal lobe causes the greatest decline in intelligence as
measured by activities in everyday life.
Chief among the neocortical abstractions are the human
symbolic languages, particularly reading and writing and
mathematics. These seem to require cooperative activities of
the temporal, parietal and frontal lobes, and perhaps the
occipital as well. Not all symbolic languages are neocortical
however; bees- without a hint of a neocortex-have an
elaborate dance language, first elucidated by the Austrian
entomologist Karl von Frisch, by which they communicate
information on the distance and direction of available food. It is
an exaggerated gestural language, imitative of the motions bees
in fact perform when finding food-as if we were to make a few
steps towards the refrigerator, point and rub our bellies, with
our tongues lolling out all the while. But the vocabularies of
such languages are extremely limited, perhaps only a few
dozen words. The kind of learning that human youngsters
experience during their long childhood seems almost
exclusively a neocortical function.
While most olfactory processing is in the limbic system, some
occurs in the neocortex. The same division of function seems
to apply to memory. A principal part of the limbic system, other
than the olfactory cortex, is, as we have mentioned, the
hippocampal cortex. When the olfactory cortex is excised,
animals can still smell, although with a much lower efficiency.
This is another demonstration of the redundancy of brain
function. There is some evidence that, in contemporary
humans, the short-term memory of smell resides in the
hippocampus. The original function of the hippocampus may
have been exclusively the short-term memory of smell, useful
in, for example, tracking prey or finding the opposite sex. But a
bilateral hippocampal lesion in humans results, > as in the case
of H. M., in a profound impairment of all varieties of short-term
memory. Patients with such lesions literally cannot remember
from one moment to the next. Clearly, both hippocampus and
frontal lobes are involved in human short-term memory.

51

One of the many interesting implications of this is that
short-term and long-term memory reside mostly in different
parts of the brain. Classical conditioning- the ability of Pavlov's
dogs to salivate when the bells rang-seems to be located in the
limbic system. This is long-term memory, but of a very
restricted kind. The sophisticated sort of human long-term
memory is situated in the neocortex, which is consistent with
the human ability to think ahead. As we grow old, we
sometimes forget what has just been said to us while retaining
vivid and accurate recollections of events in our childhood. In
such cases, little seems to be wrong with either our short-term
or our long-term memories; the problem is the connection
between the two-we have great difficulty in accessing new
material into the long-term memory. Penfield believed that this
lost accessing ability arises from an inadequate blood supply to
the hippocampus in old age-because of arteriosclerosis or
other physical disabilities. Thus elderly people-and ones not so
elderly-may have serious impairments in accessing short-term
memory while being otherwise perfectly alert and intellectually
keen.* This phenomenon also shows a clear-cut distinction
between short-term and long-term memory, consistent with
their localization in different parts of the brain. Waitresses in
short-order restaurants can remember an impressive amount of
information, which they accurately transmit to the kitchen. But
an hour later, the information has vanished utterly. It was put
into the short-term memory only, and no effort was made to
access it into the long-term memory.
The mechanics of recall can be complex. A common experience
is that we know something is in our long-term memory-a word,
a name, a face, an experience-but find ourselves unable to call
it up. No matter how hard we try, the memory resists retrieval.
But if we think sideways at it, recalling some slightly related or
peripheral item, it often follows unbidden. (Human vision is also
a little like this. When we look directly at a faint object-a star,
say-we are using the fovea, the part of the retina with the
greatest acuity and the greatest density of cells called cones.
But when we avert our vision slightly-when, in a manner of
speaking, we look sideways at the object-we bring into play the
cells called rods, which are sensitive to feeble illumination and

52

so able to perceive the faint star.) It would be interesting to
know why thinking sideways improves memory retrieval; it may
be merely associating to the memory trace by a different neural
pathway. But it does not suggest particularly efficient brain
engineering.
* Indeed, there is a range of medical evidence on the
connection between blood supply and intellectual abilities. It
has long been known that patients deprived of oxygen for some
minutes can experience permanent and serious mental
impairment. Operations to remove material from clogged
carotid arteries in an effort to prevent stroke yield unexpected
benefits. According to one study, six weeks after such
operations, the patients showed an average increase in IQ of
eighteen points, a substantial improvement. And there has been
some speculation that immersion in hyperbaric oxygen-that is,
oxygen under high pressure-can raise the intelligence of
infants.
We have all had the experience of awakening with a particularly
vivid, chilling, insightful or otherwise memorable dream clearly
in mind; saying to ourselves, "I'll certainly remember this dream
in the morning"; and the next day having not the foggiest notion
about the content of the dream or, at best, a vague trace of an
emotion tone. On the other hand, if I am sufficiently exercised
about the dream to awaken my wife in the middle of the night
and tell her about it, I have no difficulty remembering its
contents unaided in the morning. Likewise, if I take the trouble
of writing the dream down, when I awaken the next morning I
can remember the dream perfectly well without referring to my
notes. The same thing is true of, for example, remembering a
telephone number. If I am told a number and merely think about
it, I am likely to forget it or transpose some of the digits. If I
repeat the numbers out loud or write them down, I can
remember them quite well. This surely means that there is a
part of our brain which remembers sounds and images, but not
thoughts. I wonder if that sort of memory arose before we had
very many thoughts-when it was important to remember the
hiss of an attacking reptile or the shadow of a plummeting
hawk, but not our own occasional philosophical reflections.

53

ON HUMAN NATURE
Despite the intriguing localization of function in the triune brain
model, it is, I stress again, an oversimplification to insist upon
perfect separation of function. Human ritual and emotional
behavior are certainly influenced strongly by neocortical
abstract reasoning; analytical demonstrations of the validity of
purely religious beliefs have been proffered, and there are
philosophical justifications for hierarchical behavior, such as
Thomas Hobbes' "demonstration" of the divine right of kings.
Likewise, animals that are not human-and in fact even some
animals that are not primates-seem to show glimmerings of
analytical abilities. I certainly have such an impression about
dolphins, as I described in my book The Cosmic Connection.
Nevertheless, while bearing these caveats in mind, it seems a
useful first approximation to consider the ritualistic and
hierarchical aspects of our lives to be influenced strongly by
the R-complex and shared with our reptilian forebears; the
altruistic, emotional and religious aspects of our lives to be
localized to a significant extent in the limbic system and shared
with our nonprimate mammalian forebears (and perhaps the
birds); and reason to be a function of the neo-cortex, shared to
some extent with the higher primates and such cetaceans as
dolphins and whales. While ritual, emotion and reasoning are all
significant aspects of human nature, the most nearly unique
human characteristic is the ability to associate abstractly and to
reason. Curiosity and the urge to solve problems are the
emotional hallmarks of our species; and the most
characteristically human activities are mathematics, science,
technology, music and the arts-a somewhat broader range of
subjects than is usually included under the "humanities." Indeed,
in its common usage this very word seems to reflect a peculiar
narrowness of vision about what is human. Mathematics is as
much a "humanity" as poetry. Whales and elephants may be as
"humane" as humans.
The triune-brain model derives from studies of comparative
neuroanatomy and behavior. But honest introspection is not
unknown in the human species, and if the triune-brain model is

54

correct, we would expect some hint of it in the history of
human self-knowledge. The most widely known hypothesis that
is at least reminiscent of the triune brain is Sigmund Freud's
division of the human psyche into id, ego and superego. The
aggressive and sexual aspects of the R-complex correspond
satisfyingly to the Freudian description of the id (Latin for
"it"-i. e., the beast-like aspect of our natures); but, so far as I
know, Freud did not in his description of the id lay great stress
on the ritual or social-hierarchy aspects of the R-complex. He
did describe emotions as an ego function-in particular the
"oceanic experience," which is the Freudian equivalent of the
religious epiphany. However, the superego is not depicted
primarily as the site of abstract reasoning but rather as the
internalizer of societal and parental strictures, which in the
triune brain we might suspect to be more a function of the
R-complex. Thus I would have to describe the psychoanalytic
tripartite mind as only weakly in accord with the triune-brain
model.
Perhaps a better metaphor is Freud's division of the mind into
the conscious; the preconscious, which is latent but capable of
being tapped; and the unconscious, which is repressed or
otherwise unavailable. It was the tension that exists among the
components of the psyche that Freud had in mind when he said
of man that "his capacity for neurosis would merely be the
obverse of his capacity for cultural development." He called the
unconscious functions "primary processes."
A superior agreement is found in the metaphor for the human
psyche in the Platonic dialogue Phaedrus. Socrates likens the
human soul to a chariot drawn by two horses-one black, one
white-pulling in different directions and weakly controlled by a
charioteer. The metaphor of the chariot itself is remarkably
similar to MacLean's neural chassis; the two horses, to the
R-complex and the limbic cortex; and the charioteer barely in
control of the careening chariot and horses, to the neocortex.
In yet another metaphor, Freud described the ego as the rider
of an unruly horse. Both the Freudian and the Platonic
metaphors emphasize the considerable independence of and
tension among the constituent parts of the psyche, a point that

55

characterizes the human condition and to which we will return.
Because of the neuroanatomical connections between the three
components, the triune brain must itself, like the Phaedrus
chariot, be a metaphor; but it may prove to be a metaphor of
great utility and depth.

4 EDEN AS A METAPHOR: THE EVOLUTION OF MAN
Then wilt thou not be loth
To leave this Paradise, but shalt possess
A Paradise within thee, happier far ...
They hand in hand with wandering steps and slow
Through Eden took their solitary way.

Paradise Lost

of men Too soon, and with weak hands though
mighty heart

FOR THEIR surface area, insects weigh very little. A beetle,
falling from a high altitude, quickly achieves terminal velocity:
air resistance prevents it from falling very fast, and, after
alighting on the ground, it will walk away, apparently none the
worse for the experience. The same is true of small
mammals-squirrels, say. A mouse can be dropped down a
thousand-foot mine shaft and, if the ground is soft, will arrive
dazed but essentially unhurt. In contrast, human beings are
characteristically maimed or killed by any fall of more than a

56

few dozen feet: because of our size, we weigh too much for our
surface area. Therefore our arboreal ancestors had to pay
attention. Any error in brachiating from branch to branch could
be fatal. Every leap was an opportunity for evolution. Powerful
selective forces were at work to evolve organisms with grace
and agility, accurate binocular vision, versatile manipulative
abilities, superb eye-hand coordination, and an intuitive grasp
of Newtonian gravitation. But each of these skills required
significant advances in the evolution of the brains and
particularly the neocortices of our ancestors. Human
intelligence is fundamentally indebted to the millions of years
our ancestors spent aloft in the trees.
And after we returned to the savannahs and abandoned the
trees, did we long for those great graceful leaps and ecstatic
moments of weightlessness in the shafts of sunlight of the
forest roof? Is the startle reflex of human infants today to
prevent falling from the treetops? Are our nighttime dreams of
flying and our daytime passion for flight, as exemplified in the
lives of Leonardo da Vinci or Konstantin Tsiolkovskii, nostalgic
reminiscences of those days gone by in the branches of the
high forest? *
Other mammals, even other nonprimate and non-cetacean
mammals, have neocortices. But in the evolutionary line leading
to man, when was the first large-scale development of the
neocortex? While none of our simian ancestors are still around,
this question can nevertheless be answered or at least
approached: we can examine fossil skulls. In humans, in apes
and monkeys, and in other mammals, the brain volume almost
fills the skull. This is not true, for example, in fish. Thus by
taking a cast of a skull, we can determine what is called the
endocranial volume of our immediate ancestors and collateral
relatives and can make some rough estimates of their brain
volumes.
The question of who was and who was not an ancestor of man
is still being hotly debated by the paleontologists, and hardly a
year goes by without the discovery of some fossil of
remarkably human aspect -much-older- than anyone had
previously thought possible. What seems certain is that about

57

five million years ago, there was an abundance of apelike
animals, the gracile Australopithecines, who walked on two feet
and had brain volumes of about 500 cubic centimeters, some
100 cc more than the brain of a modern chimpanzee. With this
evidence, paleontologists have deduced that "bipedalism
preceded encephalization," by which they mean that our
ancestors walked on two legs before they evolved big brains.
* Modern rocket technology and space exploration owes an
incalculable debt to Dr. Robert H. Goddard, who through many
decades of devoted and lonely research was single-handedly
responsible for the development of essentially all important
aspects of the modern rocket. Goddard's interest in this subject
originated in a magic moment. In the New England autumn of
1899, Goddard was a seventeen-year-old high school
sophomore who had climbed a cherry tree and, while idly
looking down at the ground around him, experienced a kind of
epiphanal vision of a vehicle that would transport human beings
to the planet Mars. He resolved to devote himself to the task.
Exactly one year later, he climbed the tree again, and on every
October 19th for the rest of his life, made a special point of
recollecting that moment. Can it be an accident that this vision
of voyages to the planets, which has led directly to its own
historical fulfillment, was glimpsed in the limbs of a tree?
By three million years ago, there was a variety of bipedal
fellows with a wide range of cranial volumes, some
considerably larger than the East African gracile
Australopithecines of a few million years earlier. One of them,
which L. S. B. Leakey, the Anglo-Kenyan student of early man,
called Homo habilis, had a brain volume of about 700 cubic
centimeters. We also have archaeological evidence that Homo
habilis made tools. The idea that tools are both the cause and
the effect of walking on two legs, which frees the hands, was
first advanced by Charles Darwin. The fact that these
significant changes in behavior are accompanied by equally
significant changes in brain volume does not prove that the one
is caused by the other; but our previous discussion makes such
a casual link appear very likely.

58

The table on page 92 summarizes the fossil evidence, through
1976, on our most recent ancestors and collateral relatives.
The two rather different kinds of Australopithecines were not
of the genus Homo, not human; they were still incompletely
bipedal and had brain masses only about a third the size of the
average adult human brain today. Were we to meet an
Australopithecine, say, on the subway, we would perhaps be
struck most by the almost total absence of forehead. He was
the lowest of lowbrows. There are significant differences
between the two kinds of Australopithecines. The robust
species was taller and heavier, with most impressive
"nut-cracker" teeth and a remarkable evolutionary stability.
The endocranial volume of A. robustus varies very little from
specimen to specimen over millions of years of time. The
gracile Australopithecines, judging again from their teeth,
probably ate meat as well as vegetables. They were smaller
and lither, as their name indicates. However, they are
considerably older and have much more variance in endocranial
volume than their robust cousins. But, most important, the
gracile Australopithecine sites are associated with a clear
industry: the manufacture of tools made of stone and animal
bones, horns and teeth-painstakingly carved, broken, rubbed
and polished to make chipping, flaking, pounding and cutting
tools. No tools have been associated with A. robustus. The
ratio of brain weight to body weight is almost twice as large for
the gracile as for the robust Australopithecus, and it is a natural
speculation to wonder whether that factor of two is the
difference between tools and no tools.
At apparently the same epoch as the emergence of
Australopithecus robustus, there arose a new animal, Homo
habilis, the first true man. He was larger, both in body and in
brain weight, than either of the Australopithecines, and had a
ratio of brain to body weight about the same as that of the
gracile Australopithecines. He emerged at a time when, for
climatic reasons, the forests were receding. Homo habilis
inhabited the vast African savannahs, an extremely challenging
environment filled with an enormous variety of predators and
prey. On these plains of low grass appeared both the first

59

modern man and the first modern horse. They were almost
exact contemporaries.
In the last sixty million years, there has been a continuous
evolution of ungulates, well recorded in the fossil record, and
eventually culminating in the modern horse. Eohippus, the
"dawn horse" of some fifty million years ago, was about the
size of an English collie, with a brain volume of about
twenty-five cubic centimeters, and a ratio of brain to body
weight about half that of comparable contemporary mammals.
Since then, horses have experienced a dramatic evolution in
both absolute and relative brain size, with major developments
in the neocortex and particularly in the frontal lobes-an
evolution certainly accompanied by major improvements in
equine intelligence. I wonder if the parallel developments in the
intelligence of horse and man might have a common cause. Did
horses, for example, have to be swift of foot, acute of sense,
and intelligent to elude predators which hunted primate as well
as equine prey?
H. habilis had a high forehead, suggesting a significant
development of the neocortical areas in the frontal and
temporal lobes as well as the regions in the brain, to be
discussed later, that seem to be connected with the power of
speech. Were we to encounter Homo habilis-dressed, let us
say, in the latest fashion on the boulevards of some modern
metropolis-we would probably give him only a passing glance,
and that because of his relatively small stature. Associated with
Homo habilis are a variety of tools of considerable
sophistication. In addition, there is evidence from various
circular arrangements of stones that Homo habilis may have
constructed dwellings; that long before the Pleistocene Ice
Ages, long before men regularly inhabited caves, H. habilis was
constructing homes out-of-doors-probably of wood, wattle,
grass and stone.
Since H. habilis and A. robustus emerged at the same time, it is
very unlikely that one was the ancestor of the other. The
gracile Australopithecines were also contemporaries of Homo
habilis but much more ancient. It is therefore possible-although
by no means certain-that both H. habilis, with a promising
evolutionary future, and A. robustus, an evolutionary dead end,

60

arose from the gracile A. africanus, who survived long enough
to be their contemporary.
The first man whose endocranial volume overlaps that of
modern humans is Homo erectus. For many years the principal
specimens of H. erectus were known from China and thought to
be about half a million years old. But in 1976 Richard Leakey of
the National Museums of Kenya reported a nearly complete
skull of Homo erectus found in geological strata one and a half
million years old. Since the Chinese specimens of Homo erectus
are clearly associated with the remains of campfires, it is
possible that our ancestors domesticated fire much more than
one half million years ago -which makes Prometheus far older
than many had thought.
Perhaps the most striking aspect of the archaeological record
concerning tools is that as soon as they appear at all they
appear in enormous abundance. It looks very much as though
an inspired gracile Australopithecine discovered for the first
time the use of tools and immediately taught the toolmaking
skill to his relatives and friends. There is no way to explain the
discontinuous appearance of stone tools unless the
Australopithecines had educational institutions. There must
have been some sort of stonecraft guild passing on from
generation to generation the precious knowledge about the
fabrication and use of tools-knowledge that would eventually
propel such feeble and almost defenseless primates into
domination of the planet Earth. Whether the genus Homo
independently invented tools or borrowed the discovery from
the genus Australopithecus is not known.
We see from the table that the ratio of body to brain weight is,
within the variance of measurement, roughly the same for the
gracile Australopithecines, Homo habilis, Homo erectus and
modern humans. The advances we have made in the last few
million years cannot therefore be explained by the ratio of brain
to body mass, but rather by increasing total brain mass,
improved specialization of new function and complexity within
the brain, and-especially-extrasomatic learning.

61

L. S. B. Leakey emphasized that the fossil record of a few
million years ago is replete with a great variety of manlike
forms, an interesting number of which are found with holes or
fractures in their skulls. Some of these injuries may have been
inflicted by leopards or hyenas; but Leakey and the South
African anatomist Raymond Dart believed that many of them
were inflicted by our ancestors. In Pliocene/Pleistocene times
there was almost certainly a vigorous competition among many
manlike forms, of which only one line survived-the tool
experts, the line that led to us. What role killing played in that
competition remains an open question. The gracile
Australopithecines were erect, agile, fleet and three and a half
feet tall: "little people." I sometimes wonder whether our myths
about gnomes, trolls, giants and dwarfs could possibly be a
genetic or cultural memory of those times.
At the same time that the hominid cranial volume was
undergoing its spectacular increase, there was another striking
change in human anatomy; as the British anatomist Sir Wilfred
Le Gros Clark of Oxford University has observed, there was a
wholesale reshaping of the human pelvis. This was very likely
an adaptation to permit the live birth of the latest model
large-brained babies. Today, it is unlikely that any further
substantial enlargement of the pelvic girdle in the region of the
birth canal is possible without severely impairing the ability of
women to walk efficiently. (At birth, girls already have a
significantly larger pelvis and skeletal pelvic opening than do
boys; another large increment in the size of the female pelvis
occurs at puberty.) The parallel emergence of these two
evolutionary events illustrates nicely how natural selection
works. Those mothers with hereditary large pelvises were able
to bear large-brained babies who because of their superior
intelligence were able to compete successfully in adulthood
with the smaller-brained offspring of mothers with smaller
pelvises. He who had a stone axe was more likely to win a
vigorous difference of opinion in Pleistocene times. More
important, he was a more successful hunter. But the invention
and continued manufacture of stone axes required larger brain
volumes.

62

So far as I know, childbirth is generally painful in only one of
the millions of species on Earth: human beings. This must be a
consequence of the recent and continuing increase in cranial
volume. Modem men and women have braincases twice the
volume of Homo habilis'. Childbirth is painful because the
evolution of the human skull has been spectacularly fast and
recent. The American anatomist C. Judson Herrick described
the development of the neocortex in the following terms: "Its
explosive growth late in phylogeny is one of the most dramatic
cases of evolutionary transformation known to comparative
anatomy." The incomplete closure of the skull at birth, the
fontanelle, is very likely an imperfect accommodation to this
recent brain evolution.
The connection between the evolution of intelligence and the
pain of childbirth seems unexpectedly to be made in the Book
of Genesis. In punishment for eating the fruit of the tree of the
knowledge of good and evil, God says to Eve,* "In pain shalt
thou bring forth children" (Genesis 3:16). It is interesting that it
is not the getting of any sort of knowledge that God has
forbidden, but, specifically, the knowledge of the difference
between good and evil-that is, abstract and moral judgments,
which, if they reside anywhere, reside in the neocortex. Even
at the time that the Eden story was written, the development of
cognitive skills was seen as endowing man with godlike powers
and awesome responsibilities. God says: "Behold, the man is
become as one of us, to know good and evil; and now, lest he
put forth his hand, and take also of the Tree of Life, and eat,
and live forever" (Genesis 3:22), he must be driven out of the
Garden. God places cherubim with a flaming sword east of Eden
to guard the Tree of Life from the ambitions of man.+
* God's judgment on the serpent is that henceforth "upon thy
belly shalt thou go"-implying that previously reptiles traveled
by an alternative mode of locomotion. This is, of course,
precisely true: snakes have evolved from four-legged reptilian
ancestors resembling dragons. Many snakes still retain
anatomical vestiges of the limbs of their ancestors.
+ Cherubim is plural; Genesis 3:24 specifies one flaming
sword. Presumably flaming swords were in short supply.

63

Perhaps the Garden of Eden is not so different from Earth as it
appeared to our ancestors of some three or four million years
ago, during a legendary golden age when the genus Homo was
perfectly interwoven with the other beasts and vegetables.
After the exile from Eden we find, in the biblical account,
mankind condemned to death; hard work; clothing and modesty
as preventatives of sexual stimulation; the dominance of men
over women; the domestication of plants (Cain); the
domestication of animals (Abel); and murder (Cain plus Abel).
These all correspond reasonably well to the historical and
archaeological evidence. In the Eden metaphor, there is no
evidence of murder before the Fall. But those fractured skulls
of bipeds not on the evolutionary line to man may be evidence
that our ancestors killed, even in Eden, many manlike animals.
Civilization develops not from Abel, but from Cain the
murderer. The very word "civilization" derives from the Latin
word for city. It is the leisure time, community organization and
specialization of labor in the first cities that permitted the
emergence of the arts and technologies we think of as the
hallmarks of civilizations. The first city, according to Genesis,
was constructed by Cain, the inventor of agriculture-a
technology that requires a fixed abode. And it is his
descendants, the sons of Lamech, who invent both "artifices in
brass and iron" and musical instruments. Metallurgy and
music-technology and art-are in the line from Cain. And the
passions that lead to murder do not abate: Lamech says, "For I
have slain a man for wounding me, and a young man for
bruising me; if Cain shall be avenged sevenfold, truly Lamech
seventy and sevenfold." The connection between murder and
invention has been with us ever since. Both derive from
agriculture and civilization.
One of the earliest consequences of the anticipatory skills that
accompanied the evolution of the prefrontal lobes must have
been the awareness of death. Man is probably the only
organism on Earth with a relatively clear view of the
inevitability of his own end. Burial ceremonies that include the

64

interment of food and artifacts along with the deceased go back
at least to the times of our Neanderthal cousins, suggesting not
only a widespread awareness of death but also an already
developed ritual ceremony to sustain the deceased in the
afterlife. It is not that death was absent before the spectacular
growth of the neocortex, before the exile from Eden; it is only
that, until then, no one had ever noticed that death would be his
destiny.
The fall from Eden seems to be an appropriate metaphor for
some of the major biological events in recent human evolution.
This may account for its popularity.* It is not so remarkable as
to require us to believe in a kind of biological memory of
ancient historical events, but it does seem to me close enough
to risk at least raising the question. The only repository of such
a biological memory is, of course, the genetic code.
* In the West. There are, of course, many insightful and
profound myths on the origin of mankind in other human
cultures.
By fifty-five million years ago, in the Eocene Period, there was
a great proliferation of primates, both arboreal and
ground-dwelling, and the evolution of a line of descent that
eventually led to Man. Some primates of those times-e. g., a
prosimian called Tetonius-exhibit in their endocranial casts tiny
nubs where the frontal lobes will later evolve. The first fossil
evidence of a brain of even vaguely human aspects dates back
to eighteen million years to the Miocene Period, when an
anthropoid ape which we call Proconsul or Dryo-pithecus
appeared. Proconsul was quadrupedal and arboreal, probably
ancestral to the present great apes and possibly to Homo
sapiens as well. He is roughly what we might expect for a
common ancestor of apes and men. (His approximate
contemporary, Ramapithecus, is thought by some
anthropologists to be ancestral to man.) Proconsul's endocranial
casts show recognizable frontal lobes but much less well
developed neocortical convolutions than are displayed by apes
and men today. His cranial volume was still very small.

65

The biggest burst of evolution in cranial volume occurred in the
last few million years.
Patients who have had prefrontal lobotomies have been
described as losing a "continuing sense of self"-the feeling that
I am a particular individual with some control over my life and
circumstances, the "me-ness" of me, the uniqueness of the
individual. It is possible that lower mammals and reptiles,
lacking extensive frontal lobes, also lack this sense, real or
illusory, of individuality and free will, which is so
characteristically human and which may first have been
experienced dimly by Proconsul.
The development of human culture and the evolution of those
physiological traits we consider characteristically human most
likely proceeded-almost literally-hand in hand: the better our
genetic predispositions for running, communicating and
manipulating, the more likely we were to develop effective
tools and hunting strategies; the more adaptive our tools and
hunting strategies, the more likely it was that our characteristic
genetic endowments would survive. The American
anthropologist Sherwood Wash-burn of the University of
California, a principal exponent of this view, has said: "Much of
what we think of as human evolved long after the use of tools.
It is probably more correct to think of much of our structure as
the result of culture than it is to think of men anatomically like
ourselves slowly developing culture."
Some students of human evolution believe that part of the
selection pressure behind this enormous burst in brain
evolution was in the motor cortex and not at first in the
neocortical regions responsible for cognitive processes. They
stress the remarkable abilities of human beings to throw
projectiles accurately, to move gracefully, and-as Louis Leakey
enjoyed illustrating by direct demonstration-naked, to outrun
and immobilize game animals. Such sports as baseball, football,
wrestling, track and field events, chess and warfare may owe
their appeal-as well as their largely male following-to these
prewired hunting skills, which served us so well for millions of

66

years of human history but which find diminished practical
applications today.
Effective defense against predators and the hunting of game
were both necessarily cooperative ventures. The environment
in which man evolved-in Africa in Pliocene and Pleistocene
times-was inhabited by a variety of terrifying mammalian
carnivores, perhaps the most awesome of which were packs of
large hyenas. It was very difficult to defend oneself alone
against such a pack. Stalking large animals, either solitary
beasts or herds, is dangerous; some gestural communication
among the hunters is necessary. We know, for example, that
shortly after man entered North America, via the Bering Straits
in the Pleistocene Period, there were massive and spectacular
kills of large game animals, often by driving them over cliffs. In
order to stalk a single wildebeest or stampede a herd of
antelope to their deaths, hunters must share at least a minimal
symbolic language. Adam's first act was linguistic-long before
the Fall and even before the creation of Eve: he named the
animals of Eden.
Some forms of gestural symbolic language, of course,
originated much earlier than the primates; canines and many
other mammals who form dominance hierarchies may indicate
submission by averting the eyes or baring the neck. We have
mentioned other submissive rituals in primates such as
macaques. The human greetings of bow, nod and curtsy may
have a similar origin. Many animals seem to signal friendship by
biting, but not hard enough to hurt, as if to say, "I am able to
bite you but choose not to do so." The raising of the right hand
as a symbol of greeting among humans has precisely the same
significance: "I could attack you with a weapon but choose not
to wield one." *
* The upraised and open right hand is sometimes described as
a "universal" symbol of good will. It at least runs the gamut
from Praetorian Guards to Sioux scouts. Since those wielding
weapons are, in human history, characteristically male, it
should be and is a characteristically male greeting. For these
reasons, among others, the plaque aboard the Pioneer 10

67

spacecraft-the first artifact of mankind to leave the solar
system-included a drawing of a naked man and woman, the
man's hand raised, palm out, in greeting (see illustration on p.
246). In The Cosmic Connection I describe the humans on the
plaque as the most obscure part of the message. Nevertheless,
I wonder. Could the significance of the man's gesture be
deduced by beings with very different biologies?
Extensive gestural languages were employed by many human
hunting communities-for example, among the Plains Indians,
who also used smoke signals. According to Homer, the victory
of the Hellenes at Troy was conveyed from Ilium to Greece, a
distance of some hundred miles, by a series of signal fires. The
date was about 1100 B.C. However, both the repertoire of ideas
and the speed with which ideas can be communicated in
gestural or sign languages is limited. Darwin pointed out that
gestural languages cannot usefully be employed while our
hands are otherwise occupied, or at night, or when our view of
the hands is obstructed. One can imagine gestural languages
being gradually supplemented and then supplanted by verbal
languages -which originally may have been onomatopoeic (that
is, imitative in sound of the object or action being described).
Children call dogs "bow-wows." In almost all human languages
the child's word for "mother" seems imitative of the sound
made inadvertently while feeding at the breast. But all of this
could not have occurred without a restructuring of the brain.
We know from skeletal remains associated with early man that
our ancestors were hunters. We know enough about the hunting
of large animals to realize that some language is required for
cooperative stalking. But ideas on the antiquity of language
have received a measure of unexpected support from detailed
studies of fossil endocasts made by the American
anthropologist Ralph L. Holloway of Columbia University.
Holloway's casts of fossil skulls are made of rubber latex, and
he has attempted to deduce something of the detailed
morphology of the brain from the shape of the skull. The
activity is a kind of phrenology, but on the inside rather than on
the outside and much more soundly based. Holloway believes
that a region of the brain known as Broca's area, one of several

68

centers required for speech, can be detected in fossil
endocasts; and that he has found evidence for Broca's area in a
Homo habilis fossil more than two million years old. The
development of language, tools and culture may have occurred
roughly simultaneously.
There were, incidentally, manlike creatures who lived only a
few tens of thousands of years ago-the Neanderthals and the
Cro-Magnons--who had average brain volumes of about 1,500
cubic centimeters; that is, more than a hundred cubic
centimeters larger than ours. Most anthropologists guess that
we are not descended from Neanderthals and may not be from
Cro-Magnons either. But their existence raises the question:
Who were those fellows? What were their accomplishments?
Cro-Magnon was also very large: some specimens were well
over six feet tall. We have seen that a difference in brain
volume of 100 cubic centimeters does not seem to be
significant, and perhaps they were no smarter than we or our
immediate ancestors; or perhaps they had other, still unknown,
physical impediments. Neanderthal was a lowbrow, but his head
was long, front to back; in contrast, our heads are not so deep,
but they are taller: we can certainly be described as highbrows.
Might the brain growth exhibited by Neanderthal man have
been in the parietal and occipital lobes, and the major brain
growth of our ancestors in the frontal and temporal lobes? Is it
possible that the Neanderthals developed quite a different
mentality than ours, and that our superior linguistic and
anticipatory skills enabled us to destroy utterly our husky and
intelligent cousins?
So far as we know, nothing like human intelligence appeared on
Earth before a few million, or at least a few tens of millions of
years ago. But that is a few tenths of a percent of the age of
Earth, very late in December in the Cosmic Calendar. Why did it
appear so late? The answer clearly seems to be that some
particular property of higher primate and cetacean brains did
not evolve until recently. But what is that property? I can
suggest at least four possibilities, all of which have already
been mentioned, either explicitly or implicitly: (1) Never before
was there a brain so massive; (2) Never before was there a

69

brain with so large a ratio of brain to body mass; (3) Never
before was there a brain with certain functional units (large
frontal and temporal lobes, for example); (4) Never before was
there a brain with so many neural connections or synapses.
(There seems to be some evidence that along with the
evolution of the human brain there may have been an increase
in the number of connections of each neuron with its neighbor,
and in the number of microcircuits.) Explanations 1, 2 and 4
argue that a quantitative change produced a qualitative change.
It does not seem to me that a crisp choice among these four
alternatives can be made at the present time, and I suspect that
the truth will actually embrace most or all of these possibilities.
The British student of human evolution Sir Arthur Keith
proposed what he called a "Rubicon" in the evolution of the
human brain. He thought that at the brain volume of Homo
erectus-about 750 cubic centimeters, roughly the engine
displacement of a fast motorcycle -the uniquely human qualities
begin to emerge. The "Rubicon" might, of course, have been
more qualitative than quantitative. Perhaps the difference was
not so much an additional 200 cubic centimeters as some
specific developments in the frontal, temporal and parietal
lobes which provided us with analytical ability, foresight and
anxiety.
While we can debate what the "Rubicon" corresponds to, the
idea of some sort of Rubicon is not without value. But if there is
a Rubicon anywhere near 750 cubic centimeters, while
differences of the order of 100 or 200 cubic centimeters do
not-at any rate to us-seem to be compelling determinants of
intelligence, might not the apes be intelligent in some
recognizably human sense? A typical chimpanzee brain volume
is 400 cubic centimeters; a lowland gorilla's, 500 cc. This is the
range of brain volumes among the tool-using gracile
Australopithecines.
The Jewish historian Josephus added to the list of penalties and
tribulations that accompanied Mankind's exile from Eden the
loss of our ability to communicate with the animals.
Chimpanzees have large brains; they have well-developed

70

neocortices; they, too, have long childhoods and extended
periods of plasticity. Are they capable of abstract thought? If
they're smart, why don't they talk?

5 THE ABSTRACTION OF BEASTS
I demand of you, and of the whole world, that you show me a
generic character ... by which to distinguish between Man and
Ape. I myself most assuredly know of none. I wish somebody
would indicate one to me. But, if I had called man an ape, or
vice versa, I would have fallen under the ban of all the
ecclesiastics. It may be that as a naturalist I ought to have done
so.
CARL LINNAEUS,
the founder of taxonomy, 1788
BEASTS ABSTRACT NOT," announced John Locke, expressing
mankind's prevailing opinion throughout recorded history.
Bishop Berkeley had, however, a sardonic rejoinder: "If the fact
that brutes abstract not be made the distinguishing property of
that sort of animal, I fear a great many of those that pass for
men must be reckoned into their number." Abstract thought, at
least in its more subtle varieties, is not an invariable
accompaniment of everyday life for the average man. Could
abstract thought be a matter not of kind but of degree? Could
other animals be capable of abstract thought but more rarely or
less deeply than humans?
We have the impression that other animals are not very
intelligent. But have we examined the possibility of animal
intelligence carefully enough, or> as in Francois Truffaut's
poignant film The Wild Child, do we simply equate the absence
of our style of expression of intelligence with the absence of
intelligence? In discussing communication with the animals, the
French philosopher Montaigne remarked, "The defect that
hinders communication betwixt them and us, why may it not be
on our part as well as theirs?" *

71

* Our difficulties in understanding or effectuating
communication with other animals may arise from our
reluctance to grasp unfamiliar ways of dealing with the world.
For example, dolphins and whales, who sense their surrounding
with a quite elaborate sonar echo location technique, also
communicate with each other by a rich and elaborate set of
clicks, whose interpretation has so far eluded human attempts
to understand it. One very clever recent suggestion, which is
now being investigated, is that dolphin/dolphin communication
involves a re-creation of the sonar reflection characteristics of
the objects being described. In this view a dolphin does not
"say" a single word for shark, but rather transmits a set of
clicks corresponding to the audio reflection spectrum it would
obtain on irradiating a shark with sound waves in the dolphin's
sonar mode. The basic form of dolphin/dolphin communication
in this view would be a sort of aural onomatopoeia, a drawing of
audio frequency pictures- in this case, caricatures of a shark.
We could well imagine the extension of such a language from
concrete to abstract ideas, and by the use of a kind of audio
rebus-both analogous to the development in Mesopotamia and
Egypt of human written languages. It would also be possible,
then, for dolphins to create extraordinary audio images out of
their imaginations rather than their experience.
There is, of course, a considerable body of anecdotal
information suggesting chimpanzee intelligence. The first
serious study of the behavior of simians-including their
behavior in the wild-was made in Indonesia by Alfred Russel
Wallace, the co-discoverer of evolution by natural selection.
Wallace concluded that a baby orangutan he studied behaved
"exactly like a human child in similar circumstances." In fact,
"orangutan" is a Malay phrase meaning not ape but "man of the
woods." Teuber recounted many stories told by his parents,
pioneer German ethnologists who founded and operated the
first research station devoted to chimpanzee behavior on
Tenerife in the Canary Islands early in the second decade of
this century. It was here that Wolfgang Kohler performed his
famous studies of Sultan, a chimpanzee "genius" who was able
to connect two rods in order to reach an otherwise inaccessible

72

banana. On Tenerife, also, two chimpanzees were observed
maltreating a chicken: One would extend some food to the fowl,
encouraging it to approach; whereupon the other would thrust
at it with a piece of wire it had concealed behind its back. The
chicken would retreat but soon allow itself to approach once
again-and be beaten once again. Here is a fine combination of
behavior sometimes thought to be uniquely human: cooperation,
planning a future course of action, deception and cruelty. It also
reveals that chickens have a very low capacity for avoidance
learning.
Until a few years ago, the most extensive attempt to
communicate with chimpanzees went something like this: A
newborn chimp was taken into a household with a newborn
baby, and both would be raised together-twin cribs, twin
bassinets, twin high chairs, twin potties, twin diaper pails, twin
baby powder cans. At the end of three years, the young chimp
had, of course, far outstripped the young human in manual
dexterity, running, leaping, climbing and other motor skills. But
while the child was happily babbling away, the chimp could say
only, and with enormous difficulty, "Mama," "Papa," and "cup."
From this it was widely concluded that in language, reasoning
and other higher mental functions, chimpanzees were only
minimally competent: "Beasts abstract not."
But in thinking over these experiments, two psychologists,
Beatrice and Robert Gardner, at the University of Nevada
realized that the pharynx and larynx of the chimp are not suited
for human speech. Human beings exhibit a curious multiple use
of the mouth for eating, breathing and communicating. In
insects such as crickets, which call to one another by rubbing
their legs, these three functions are performed by completely
separate organ systems. Human spoken language seems to be
adventitious. The exploitation of organ systems with other
functions for communication in humans is also indicative of the
comparatively recent evolution of our linguistic abilities. It
might be, the Gardner's reasoned, that chimpanzees have
substantial language abilities which could not be expressed
because of the limitations of their anatomy. Was there any

73

symbolic language, they asked, that could employ the strengths
rather than the weaknesses of chimpanzee anatomy?
The Gardner's hit upon a brilliant idea: Teach a chimpanzee
American sign language, known by its acronym Ameslan, and
sometimes as "American deaf and dumb language" (the "dumb"
refers, of course, to the inability to speak and not to any failure
of intelligence). It is ideally suited to the immense manual
dexterity of the chimpanzee. It also may have all the crucial
design features of verbal languages.
There is by now a vast library of described and filmed
conversations, employing Ameslan and other gestural
languages, with Washoe, Lucy, Lana and other chimpanzees
studied by the Gardners and others. Not only are there
chimpanzees with working vocabularies of 100 to 200 words;
they are also able to distinguish among nontrivially different
grammatical patterns and syntaxes. What is more, they have
been remarkably inventive in the construction of new words
and phrases.
On seeing for the first time a duck land quacking in a pond,
Washoe gestured "waterbird," which is the same phrase used in
English and other languages, but which Washoe invented for the
occasion. Having never seen a spherical fruit other than an
apple, but knowing the signs for the principal colors, Lana, upon
spying a technician eating an orange, signed "orange apple."
After tasting a watermelon, Lucy described it as "candy drink"
or "drink fruit," which is essentially the same word form as the
English "water melon." But after she had burned her mouth on
her first radish, Lucy forever after described them as "cry hurt
food." A small doll placed unexpectedly in ₩Vas-hoe's cup
elicited the response "Baby in my drink." When Washoe soiled,
particularly clothing or furniture, she was taught the sign
"dirty," which she then extrapolated as a general term of abuse.
A rhesus monkey that evoked her displeasure was repeatedly
signed at: "Dirty monkey, dirty monkey, dirty monkey."
Occasionally Washoe would say things like "Dirty Jack, gimme
drink." Lana, in a moment of creative annoyance, called her
trainer "You green shit." Chimpanzees have invented swear

74

words. Was-hoe also seems to have a sort of sense of humor;
once, when riding on her trainer's shoulders and, perhaps
inadvertently, wetting him, she signed: "Funny, funny."
Lucy was eventually able to distinguish clearly the meanings of
the phrases "Roger tickle Lucy" and "Lucy tickle Roger," both
of which activities she enjoyed with gusto. Likewise, Lana
extrapolated from "Tim groom Lana" to "Lana groom Tim."
Washoe was observed "reading" a magazine-i.e., slowly turning
the pages, peering intently at the pictures and making, to no
one in particular, an appropriate sign, such as "cat" when
viewing a photograph of a tiger, and "drink" when examining a
Vermouth advertisement. Having learned the sign "open" with a
door, Washoe extended the concept to a briefcase. She also
attempted to converse in Ameslan with the laboratory cat, who
turned out to be the only illiterate in the facility. Having
acquired this marvelous method of communication, Washoe may
have been surprised that the cat was not also competent in
Ameslan. And when one day Jane, Lucy's foster mother, left the
laboratory, Lucy gazed after her and signed: "Cry me. Me cry."
Boyce Rensberger is a sensitive and gifted reporter for the
New York Times whose parents could neither speak nor hear,
although he is in both respects normal. His first language,
however, was Ameslan. He had been abroad on a European
assignment for the Times for some years. On his return to the
United States, one of his first domestic duties was to look into
the Gardners' experiments with Washoe. After some little time
with the chimpanzee, Rensberger reported, "Suddenly I realized
I was conversing with a member of another species in my
native tongue." The use of the word tongue is, of course,
figurative: it is built deeply into the structure of the language (a
word that also means "tongue"). In fact, Rensberger was
conversing with a member of another species in his native
"hand." And it is just this transition from tongue to hand that
has permitted humans to regain the ability-lost, according to
Josephus, since Eden-to communicate with the animals.
In addition to Ameslan, chimpanzees and other nonhuman
primates are being taught a variety of other gestural languages.

75

At the Yerkes Regional Primate Research Center in Atlanta,
Georgia, they are learning a specific computer language called
(by the humans, not the chimps) "Yerkish." The computer
records all of its subjects' conversations, even during the night
when no humans are in attendance; and from its ministrations
we have learned that chimpanzees prefer jazz to rock and
movies about chimpanzees to movies about human beings. Lana
had, by January 1976, viewed The Developmental Anatomy of
the Chimpanzee 245 times. She would undoubtedly appreciate a
larger film library.
In the illustration on page 120, Lana is shown requesting, in
proper Yerkish, a piece of banana from the computer. The
syntax required to request from the computer water, juice,
chocolate candy, music, movies, an open window and
companionship are also displayed. (The machine provides for
many of Lana's needs, but not all. Sometimes, in the middle of
the night, she forlornly types out: "Please, machine, tickle
Lana.") More elaborate requests and commentaries, each
requiring a creative use of a set grammatical form, have been
developed subsequently.
Lana monitors her sentences on a computer display, and erases
those with grammatical errors. Once, in the midst of Lana's
construction of an elaborate sentence, her trainer
mischievously and repeatedly interposed, from his separate
computer console, a word that made nonsense of Lana's
sentence. She gazed at her computer display, spied her trainer
at his console, and composed a new sentence: "Please, Tim,
leave room." Just as Washoe and Lucy can be said to speak,
Lana can be said to write.
At an early stage in the development of Washoe's verbal
abilities, Jacob Bronowski and a colleague wrote a scientific
paper denying the significance of Washoe's use of gestural
language because, in the limited data available to Bronowski,
Washoe neither inquired nor negated. But later observations
showed that Washoe and other chimpanzees were perfectly
able both to ask questions and to deny assertions put to them.
And it is difficult to see any significant difference in quality

76

between chimpanzee use of gestural language and the use of
ordinary speech by children in a manner that we unhesitatingly
attribute to intelligence. In reading Bronowski's paper I cannot
help but feel that a little pinch of human chauvinism has crept
in, an echo of Locke's "Beasts abstract not." In 1949, the
American anthropologist Leslie White stated unequivocally:
"Human behavior is symbolic behavior; symbolic behavior is
human behavior." What would White have made of Washoe,
Lucy and Lana?
These findings on chimpanzee language and intelligence have
an intriguing bearing on "Rubicon" arguments-the contention
that the total brain mass, or at least the ratio of brain to body
mass, is a useful index of intelligence. Against this point of
view it was once argued that the lower range of the brain
masses of microcephalic humans overlaps the upper range of
brain masses of adult chimpanzees and gorillas; and yet, it was
said, microcephalies have some, although severely impaired,
use of language-while the apes have none. But in only
relatively few cases are microcephalies capable of human
speech. One of the best behavioral descriptions of
microcephalies was written by a Russian physician, S.
Korsakov, who in 1893 observed a female microcephalic named
"Masha." She could understand a very few questions and
commands and could occasionally reminisce on her childhood.
She sometimes chattered away, but there was little coherence
to what she uttered. Korsakov characterized her speech as
having "an extreme poverty of logical associations." As an
example of her poorly adapted and automaton-like intelligence,
Korsakov described her eating habits. When food was present
on the table, Masha would eat. But if the food was abruptly
removed in the midst of a meal, she would behave as if the
meal had ended, thanking those in charge and piously blessing
herself. If the food were returned, she would eat again. The
pattern apparently was subject to indefinite repetition. My own
impression is that Lucy or Washoe would be a far more
interesting dinner companion than Masha, and that the
comparison of microcephalic humans with normal apes is not
inconsistent with some sort of "Rubicon" of intelligence. Of
course, both the quality and the quantity of neural connections

77

are probably vital for the sorts of intelligence that we can
easily recognize.
Recent experiments performed by James Dewson of the
Stanford University School of Medicine and his colleagues give
some physiological support to the idea of language centers in
the simian neocortex-in particular, like humans, in the left
hemisphere. Monkeys were trained to press a green light when
they heard a hiss and a red light when they heard a tone. Some
seconds after a sound was heard, the red or the green light
would appear at some unpredictable position- different each
time-on the control panel. The monkey pressed the appropriate
light and, in the case of a correct guess, was rewarded with a
pellet of food. Then the time interval between hearing the
sound and seeing the light was increased up to twenty seconds.
In order to be rewarded, the monkeys now had to remember for
twenty seconds which noise they had heard. Dew-son's team
then surgically excised part of the so-called auditory
association cortex from the left hemisphere of the neocortex in
the temporal lobe. When retested, the monkeys had very poor
recall of which sound they were then hearing. After less than a
second they could not recall whether it was a hiss or a tone.
The removal of a comparable part of the temporal lobe from the
right hemisphere produced no effect whatever on this task. "It
looks," Dewson was reported to say, "as if we removed the
structure in the monkeys' brains that may be analogous to
human language centers." Similar studies on rhesus monkeys,
but using visual rather than auditory stimuli, seem to show no
evidence of a difference between the hemispheres of the
neocortex.
Because adult chimpanzees are generally thought (at least by
zookeepers) to be too dangerous to retain in a home or home
environment, Washoe and other verbally accomplished
chimpanzees have been involuntarily "retired" soon after
reaching puberty. Thus we do not yet have experience with the
adult language abilities of monkeys and apes. One of the most
intriguing questions is whether a verbally accomplished
chimpanzee mother will be able to communicate language to her
offspring. It seems very likely that this should be possible and

78

that a community of chimps initially competent in gestural
language could pass down the language to subsequent
generations.
Where such communication is essential for survival, there is
already some evidence that apes transmit extragenetic or
cultural information. Jane Goodall observed baby chimps in the
wild emulating the behavior of their mothers and learning the
reasonably complex task of finding an appropriate twig and
using it to prod into a termite's nest so as to acquire some of
these tasty delicacies.
Differences in group behavior-something that it is very
tempting to call cultural differences-have been reported among
chimpanzees, baboons, macaques and many other primates. For
example, one group of monkeys may know how to eat bird's
eggs, while an adjacent band of precisely the same species may
not. Such primates have a few dozen sounds or cries, which are
used for intra-group communication, with such meanings as
"Flee; here is a predator." But the sound of the cries differs
somewhat from group to group: there are regional accents.
An even more striking experiment was performed accidentally
by Japanese primatologists attempting to relieve an
overpopulation and hunger problem in a community of
macaques on an island in south Japan. The anthropologists
threw grains of wheat on a sandy beach. Now it is very difficult
to separate wheat grains one by one from sand grains; such an
effort might even expend more energy than eating the collected
wheat would provide. But one brilliant macaque, Imo, perhaps
by accident or out of pique, threw handfuls of the mixture into
the water. Wheat floats; sand sinks, a fact that Imo clearly
noted. Through the sifting process she was able to eat well (on
a diet of soggy wheat, to be sure). While older macaques, set in
their ways, ignored her, the younger monkeys appeared to
grasp the importance of her discovery, and imitated it. In the
next generation, the practice was more widespread; today all
macaques on the island are competent at water sifting, an
example of a cultural tradition among the monkeys.
Earlier studies on Takasakiyama, a mountain in northeast
Kyushu inhabited by macaques, show a similar pattern in

79

cultural evolution. Visitors to Takasakiyama threw caramels
wrapped in paper to the monkeys-a common practice in
Japanese zoos, but one the Takasakiyama macaques had never
before encountered. In the course of play, some young
monkeys discovered how to unwrap the caramels and eat them.
The habit was passed on successively to their playmates, their
mothers, the dominant males (who among the macaques act as
babysitters for the very young) and finally to the subadult
males, who were at the furthest social remove from the monkey
children. The process of acculturation took more than three
years. In natural primate communities, the existing nonverbal
communications are so rich that there is little pressure for the
development of a more elaborate gestural language. But if
gestural language were necessary for chimpanzee survival,
there can be little doubt that it would be transmitted culturally
down through the generations.
I would expect a significant development and elaboration of
language in only a few generations if all the chimps unable to
communicate were to die or fail to reproduce. Basic English
corresponds to about 1,000 words. Chimpanzees are already
accomplished in vocabularies exceeding 10 percent of that
number. Although a few years ago it would have seemed the
most implausible science fiction, it does not appear to me out of
the question that, after a few generations in such a verbal
chimpanzee community, there might emerge the memoirs of the
natural history and mental life of a chimpanzee, published in
English or Japanese (with perhaps an "as told to" after the
by-line).
If chimpanzees have consciousness, if they are capable of
abstractions, do they not have what until now has been
described as "human rights"? How smart does a chimpanzee
have to be before killing him constitutes murder? What further
properties must he show before religious missionaries must
consider him worthy of attempts at conversion?
I recently was escorted through a large primate research
laboratory by its director. We approached a long corridor lined,
to the vanishing point as in a perspective drawing, with caged
chimpanzees. They were one, two or three to a cage, and I am

80

sure the accommodations were exemplary as far as such
institutions (or for that matter traditional zoos) go. As we
approached the nearest cage, its two inmates bared their teeth
and with incredible accuracy let fly great sweeping arcs of
spittle, fairly drenching the lightweight suit of the facility's
director. They then uttered a staccato of short shrieks, which
echoed down the corridor to be repeated and amplified by other
caged chimps, who had certainly not seen us, until the corridor
fairly shook with the screeching and banging and rattling of
bars. The director informed me that not only spit is apt to fly in
such a situation; and at his urging we retreated.
I was powerfully reminded of those American motion pictures
of the 1930s and 40s, set in some vast and dehumanized state
or federal penitentiary, in which the prisoners banged their
eating utensils against the bars at the appearance of the
tyrannical warden. These chimps are healthy and well-fed. If
they are "only" animals, if they are beasts which abstract not,
then my comparison is a piece of sentimental foolishness. But
chimpanzees can abstract. Like other mammals, they are
capable of strong emotions. They have certainly committed no
crimes. I do not claim to have the answer, but I think it is
certainly worthwhile to raise the question: Why, exactly, all
over the civilized world, in virtually every major city, are apes
in prison?
For all we know, occasional viable crosses between humans
and chimpanzees are possible.* The natural experiment must
have been tried very infrequently, at least recently. If such
off-spring are ever produced, what will their legal status be?
The cognitive abilities of chimpanzees force us, I think, to raise
searching questions about the boundaries of the community of
beings to which special ethical considerations are due, and can,
I hope, help to extend our ethical perspectives downward
through the taxa on Earth and upwards to extraterrestrial
organisms, if they exist.
* Until fairly recently it was thought that humans had
fortv-eight chromosomes in an ordinary somatic cell. We now
know that the correct number is forty-six. Chimps apparently
really do have forty-eight chromosomes, and in this case a

81

viable cross of a chimpanzee and a human would in any event
be rare.
It is hard to imagine the emotional significance for chimpanzees
of learning language. Perhaps the closest analogy is the
discovery of language by intelligent human beings with severe
sensory organ impairment. While the depth of understanding,
intelligence and sensitivity of Helen Keller, who could neither
see, hear nor speak, greatly exceeds that of any chimpanzee,
her account of her discovery of language carries some of the
feeling tone that this remarkable development in primate
languages may convey to the chimpanzee, particularly in a
context where language enhances survival or is strongly
reinforced.
One day Miss Keller's teacher prepared to take her for a walk:
"She brought me my hat, and I knew I was going out into the
warm sunshine. This thought, if a wordless sensation may be
called a thought, made me hop and skip with pleasure.
We walked down the path to the well-house, attracted by the
fragrance of the honeysuckle with which it was covered.
Someone was drawing water and my teacher placed my hand
under the spout. As the cool stream gushed over my hand she
spelled into the other the word water, first slowly, then rapidly.
I stood still, my whole attention fixed upon the motion of her
fingers. Suddenly I felt a misty consciousness as of something
forgotten-a thrill of returning thought; and somehow the
mystery of language was revealed to me. I knew then that
W-A-T-E-R meant that wonderful cool something that was
flowing over my hand. That living word awakened my soul,
gave it light, hope, joy, set it free! There were barriers still, it
is true, but barriers that in time could be swept away. I left the
well-house eager to learn. Everything had a name, and each
name gave birth to a new thought. As we returned into the
house, every object which I touched seemed to quiver with life.
That was because I saw everything with the strange, new sight
that had come to me."

82

Perhaps the most striking aspect of these three exquisite
paragraphs is Helen Keller's own sense that her brain had a
latent capability for language, needing only to be introduced to
it. This essentially Platonic idea is also, as we have seen,
consistent with what is known, from brain lesions, of the
physiology of the neocortex; and also with the theoretical
conclusions drawn by Noam Chomsky of the Massachusetts
Institute of Technology from comparative linguistics and
laboratory experiments on learning. In recent years it has
become clear that the brains of nonhuman primates are
similarly prepared, although probably not quite to the same
degree, for the introduction of language.
The long-term significance of teaching language to the other
primates is difficult to overestimate. There is an arresting
passage in Charles Darwin's Descent of Man: "The difference in
mind between man and the higher animals, great as it is,
certainly is one of degree and not of kind. ... If it could be
proved that certain high mental powers, such as the formation
of general concepts, self-consciousness, et cetera, were
absolutely peculiar to man, which seems extremely doubtful, it
is not improbable that these qualities are merely the incidental
results of other highly-advanced intellectual faculties; and
these again mainly the results of the continued use of a perfect
language."
This same opinion on the remarkable powers of language and
human intercommunication can be found in quite a different
place, the Genesis account of the Tower of Babel. God, in a
strangely defensive attitude for an omnipotent being, is worried
that men intend to build a tower that will reach to heaven. (His
attitude is similar to the concern he expresses after Adam eats
the apple.) To prevent Mankind from reaching heaven, at least
metaphorically, God does not destroy the tower, as, for
example, Sodom is destroyed. Instead, he says, "Behold, they
are one people, and they have all one language; and this is only
the beginning of what they will do; and nothing that they
propose to do will now be impossible for them. Come, let us go
down, and there confuse their language, that they may not
understand one another's speech" (Genesis 11:6-

83

7).
The continued use of a "perfect" language . . . What sort of
culture, what kind of oral tradition would chimpanzees establish
after a few hundred or a few thousand years of communal use
of a complex gestural language? And if there were such an
isolated continuous chimpanzee community, how would they
begin to view the origin of language? Would the Gardners and
the workers at the Yerkes Primate Center be remembered
dimly as legendary folk heroes or gods of another species?
Would there be myths, like those of Prometheus, Thoth, or
Cannes, about divine beings who had given the gift of language
to the apes? In fact, the instruction of chimpanzees in gestural
language distinctly has some of the same emotion tone and
religious sense of the (truly fictional) episode in the movie and
novel 2001: A Space Odyssey in which a representative of an
advanced extraterrestrial civilization somehow instructs our
hominid ancestors.
Perhaps the most striking aspect of this entire subject is that
there are nonhuman primates so close to the edge of language,
so willing to learn, so entirely competent in its use and
inventive in its application once the language is taught. But this
raises a curious question: Why are they all on the edge? Why
are there no nonhuman primates with an existing complex
gestural language? One possible answer, it seems to me, is that
humans have systematically exterminated those other primates
who displayed signs of intelligence. (This may have been
particularly true of the nonhuman primates who lived in the
savannahs; the forests must have offered some protection to
chimpanzees and gorillas from the depredations of man.) We
may have been the agent of natural selection in suppressing the
intellectual competition. I think we may have pushed back the
frontiers of intelligence and language ability among the
nonhuman primates until their intelligence became just
indiscernible. In teaching gestural language to the chimpanzees,
we are beginning a belated attempt to make amends.

AESCHYLUS Prometheus Bound
PROMETHEUS is in a fit of righteous indignation. He has
introduced civilization to a befuddled and superstitious mankind,
and for his pains Zeus has chained him to a rock and set a
vulture to pluck at his liver. In the passage following the above
quotation, Prometheus describes the principal gifts, other than
fire, that he has bestowed on mankind. They are, in order:
astronomy; mathematics; writing; the domestication of animals;
the invention of chariots, sailing ships and medicine; and the
discovery of divination by dreams and other methods. The final
gift strikes the modern ear as odd. Along with the account in

85

Genesis of the exile from Eden, Prometheus Bound seems to be
one of the major works in Western literature that presents a
viable allegory of the evolution of man- although in this case
concentrating much more on the "evolver" than on the evolved.
"Prometheus" is Greek for "foresight," that quality claimed to
reside in the frontal lobes of the neocortex; and foresight and
anxiety are both present in Aeschylus' character portrait.
What is the connection between dreams and the evolution of
man? Aeschylus is perhaps saying that our prehuman ancestors
lived their waking lives in a state akin to our dreaming lives;
and that one of the principal benefits of the development of
human intelligence is our ability to understand the true nature
and import of dreams.
There are, it seems, three principal states of mind in human
beings: waking, sleeping and dreaming. An
electroencephalograph, which detects brain waves, records
quite distinct patterns of electrical activity in the brain during
these three states.* Brain waves represent very small currents
and voltages produced by the electrical circuitry of the brain.
Typical strengths of such brain-wave signals are measured in
microvolts. Typical frequencies are between 1 and about 20
Hertz (or cycles per second)-less than the familiar 60 cycles
per second frequency of alternating currents in electrical
outlets in North America.
But what is sleep good for? There is no doubt that if we stay up
too long the body generates neurochemicals that literally force
us to go to sleep. Sleep-deprived animals generate such
molecules in their cerebrospinal fluid, and the cerebrospinal
fluid of sleep-deprived animals induces sleep when injected
into other animals who are perfectly wide awake. There must,
then, be a very powerful reason for sleep.
The conventional answer of physiology and folk medicine alike
is that sleep has a restorative effect; it is an opportunity for the
body to perform mental and physical housekeeping away from
the needs of daily living. But the actual evidence for this view,
apart from its common-sense plausibility, seems to be sparse.

86

Furthermore, there are some worrisome aspects about the
contention. For example, an animal is exceptionally vulnerable
when sleeping. Granted that most animals sleep in nests, caves,
holes in trees or logs or otherwise recessed or camouflaged
locations. Even so, their helplessness while asleep remains
high. Our nocturnal vulnerability is very evident; the Greeks
recognized Morpheus and Thanatos, the gods of sleep and
death, as brothers.
Unless there is some exceptionally strong biological necessity
for sleep, natural selection would have evolved beasts that
sleep not. While there are some animals- the two-toed sloth,
the armadillo, the opossum, and the bat-that, at least in states
of seasonal torpor, sleep nineteen and twenty hours a day,
there are others - the common shrew and Ball's porpoise-that
are said to sleep very little. There are also human beings who
require only one to three hours of sleep a night. They take
second and third jobs, putter around at night while their
spouses sink into exhaustion, and otherwise seem to lead full,
alert and constructive lives. Family histories suggest that these
predispositions are hereditary. In one case, both a man and his
little daughter are afflicted with this blessing or curse, much to
the groggy consternation of his wife, who has since divorced
him for a novel incompatibility. He retained custody of the
daughter. Such examples suggest that the hypothesis of the
recuperative function of sleep is at best not the whole story.
* The electroencephalograph (EEG) was invented by a German
psychologist, Hans Berger, whose fundamental interest in the
matter seems to have been telepathy. And, indeed, it can be
used for a kind of radio telepathy; human beings have the
capability to turn particular brain waves-for example, the alpha
rhythm-on and off at will, although this feat requires a little
training. With such training, an individual attached to an
electroencephalograph and a radio transmitter could, in
principle, send quite complex messages in a kind of alpha wave
Morse code, merely by thinking them in the right way; and it is
just possible that this method might have some practical use,
such as permitting patients immobilized by severe stroke to
communicate. For historical reasons, non-dreaming sleep is

87

electroencephalographically characterized as "slow wave
sleep," and the dream state as '-'paradoxical sleep."
Yet sleep is very ancient. In the electroencephalographic sense
we share it with all the primates and almost all the other
mammals and birds: it may extend back as far as the reptiles.
Temporal-lobe epilepsy and its accompanying state of
unconscious automatic behavior can be induced in some people
by spontaneous electrical stimulation of the amygdala, deep
below the temporal lobe, at frequencies of a few cycles per
second (a few Hertz). Seizures not very different from sleep
have been reported when an epileptic patient is driving in an
automobile near sunset or sunrise with a picket fence between
him and the sun: at a certain speed the pickets intercept the
sun at just the critical rate to produce a flicker at the resonant
frequency for initiating such seizures. The circadian rhythm,
the daily cycling of physiological function, is known to go back
at least to animals as humble as mollusks. Since a state in some
respects resembling dreaming can be induced by electrical
stimulation of other limbic regions below the temporal lobe, as
described below, centers that initiate both sleep and dreams
may not be far apart in the recesses of the brain.
There is some recent evidence that the two types of sleep,
dreaming and dreamless, depend on the lifestyle of the animal.
Truett Allison and Domenic Ciccheti of Yale University have
found that predators are statistically much more likely to dream
than prey, which are in turn much more likely to experience
dreamless sleep. These studies are all of mammals and apply
only to differences between, not within, species. In dream
sleep, the animal is powerfully immobilized and remarkably
unresponsive to external stimuli. Dreamless sleep is much
shallower, and we have all witnessed cats or dogs cocking their
ears to a sound when apparently fast asleep. It is also
commonly held that when sleeping dogs move their legs in a
kind of running pattern, they are dreaming of the hunt. The fact
that deep dream sleep is rare among prey today seems clearly
to be a product of natural selection. But organisms that are
largely prey today may have had ancestors that were
predators, and vice versa. Moreover, predators are generally

88

organisms with larger absolute brain mass and ratio of brain to
body mass than their prey. It makes sense that today, when
sleep is highly evolved, the stupid animals are less frequently
immobilized by deep sleep than the smart ones. But why should
they sleep deeply at all? Why should a state of such deep
immobilization ever have evolved?
Perhaps one useful hint about the original function of sleep is to
be found in the fact that dolphins and whales and aquatic
mammals in general seem to sleep very little. There is, by and
large, no place to hide in the ocean. Could it be that, rather than
increasing an animal's vulnerability, the function of sleep is to
decrease it? Wilse Webb of the University of Florida and Ray
Meddis of London University have suggested this to be the
case. The sleeping style of each organism is exquisitely
adapted to the ecology of the animal. It is conceivable that
animals who are too stupid to be quiet on their own initiative
are, during periods of high risk, immobilized by the implacable
arm of sleep. The point seems particularly clear for the young
of predatory animals; not only are baby tigers covered with a
superbly effective protective coloration, they also sleep a great
deal. This is an interesting notion and probably at least partly
true. It does not explain everything. Why do lions, who have
few natural enemies, sleep? This question is not a very
damaging objection because lions may have evolved from
animals that were not the king of beasts. Likewise, adolescent
gorillas, who have little to fear, nevertheless construct nests
each night-perhaps because they evolved from more vulnerable
predecessors. Or perhaps, once, the ancestors of lions and
gorillas feared still more formidable predators.
The immobilization hypothesis seems particularly apt in light of
the evolution of mammals, who arose in an epoch dominated by
hissing, thundering and altogether nightmarish reptiles. But
nearly all reptiles are cold-blooded* and, except in the tropics,
are forced into nocturnal immobility. Mammals are
warm-blooded and able to function at night. The nontropical
nocturnal ecological niches may have been almost un-tenanted
in the Triassic Period, some two hundred million years ago.
Indeed, Harry Jerison has suggested that the evolution of

89

mammals was accompanied by the development of then
extremely sophisticated (and now commonplace) versions of
hearing and smell, senses for perceiving distances and objects
at night; and that the limbic system evolved from the necessity
of processing the rich array of data from these newly
elaborated senses. (A great deal of the visual-information
processing in reptiles is done not in the brain but in the retina;
the optical processing apparatus in the neocortex was largely a
later evolutionary development.)
* Robert Bakker, a paleontologist at Harvard University,
suggests that at least some dinosaurs were significantly
warm-blooded; even so, it seems likely that they were not as
insensitive to diurnal temperature change as mammals are, and
that they slowed down substantially at night.
Perhaps it was essential for the early mammals to be
immobilized and hidden during the daylight hours that were
ruled by predatory reptiles. I am picturing a late Mesozoic
landscape in which the mammals sleep fitfully by day and the
reptiles by night. But at night even humble carnivorous
protomammals must have posed a real threat to the
cold-immobilized reptiles, and particularly to their eggs.
Judged by their endocranial volumes (see figure on page 39),
the dinosaurs were, compared to mammals, remarkably stupid.
To take some "well-known" examples, Tyrannosaurus rex had
a brain volume of about 200 cubic centimeters (cc);
Brachiosaurus, 150 cc; Triceratops, 70 cc; Diplodocus, 50 cc;
Stegosaurus, 30 cc. Not one approached a chimpanzee in
absolute brain mass; Stegosaurus, which weighed two metric
tons, was probably far more stupid than a rabbit. When the
large body weights of the dinosaurs are taken into account, the
smallness of their brains becomes even more striking:
Tyrannosaurus weighed 8 metric tons; Diplodocus, 12; and
Brachiosaurus, 87. The ratio of brain to body weight in
Brachiosaurus was ten thousand times smaller than that of man.
Just as sharks are the largest-brained fish for their body
weight, the carnivorous dinosaurs such as Tyrannosaurus were
relatively larger-brained than such herbivores as Diplodocus

90

and Brachiosaurus. I am sure that Tyrannosaurus was an
efficient and terrifying killing machine. But despite their
awesome aspect, the dinosaurs look vulnerable to dedicated
and intelligent adversaries-such as the early mammals.
Our Mesozoic scene has a curiously vampiric quality with the
carnivorous reptiles hunting the smart sleeping mammals by
day, and the carnivorous mammals hunting the stupid immobile
reptiles by night. While the reptiles buried, their eggs, it is
unlikely that they actively protected either eggs or young.
There are very few accounts of such behavior even in
contemporary reptiles, and it is difficult to picture
Tyrannosaurus rex brooding on a clutch of eggs. For these
reasons, the mammals may have won the primordial war of the
vampires; at least some paleontologists believe that the demise
of the dinosaurs was accelerated by nocturnal predation on
reptilian eggs by the early mammals. Two chicken eggs* for
breakfast may be all-at least on the surface-that is left of this
ancient mammalian cuisine.
* In fact, the birds are almost certainly the principal living
descendants of the dinosaurs.
The most intelligent of the dinosaurs by the criterion of brain to
body mass are the Saurornithoides, whose brain mass was
typically about 50 grams to a body mass of about 50 kilograms,
placing them near the ostrich in the figure on page 40. Indeed,
they resembled ostriches. It might be very illuminating to
examine fossil endocasts of their braincases. They probably
hunted small animals for food and used the four fingers of their
handlike appendages for many different tasks.
They are interesting beasts to speculate about. If the dinosaurs
had not all been mysteriously extinguished some sixty-five
million years ago, would the Saurornithoides have continued to
evolve into increasingly intelligent forms? Would they have
learned to hunt large mammals collectively and thus perhaps
have prevented the great proliferation of mammals that
followed the end of the Mesozoic Age? If it had not been for the
extinction of the dinosaurs, would the dominant life forms on

91

Earth today be descendants of Sauronithoides, writing and
reading books, speculating on what would have happened had
the mammals prevailed? Would the dominant forms think that
base 8 arithmetic was quite natural, but base 10 a frill taught
only in the "New Math"?
A great deal of what we consider important about the last few
tens of millions of years of Earth's history seems to hinge on
the extinction of the dinosaurs. There are literally dozens of
scientific hypotheses that attempt to explain this event, which
appears to have been remarkably rapid and thorough for both
land and water forms. All the explanations proposed seem to be
only partly satisfactory. They range from massive climatic
change to mammalian predation to the extinction of a plant with
apparent laxative properties, in which case the dinosaurs died
of constipation.
One of the most interesting and promising hypotheses, first
suggested by I. S. Shklovskii of the Institute for Cosmic
Research, Soviet Academy of Sciences, Moscow, is that the
dinosaurs died because of a nearby supernova event- the
explosion of a dying star some tens of light-years away, which
resulted in an immense flux of high energy charged particles
that entered our atmosphere, changed its properties, and,
perhaps by destroying the atmospheric ozone, let in lethal
quantities of solar ultraviolet radiation. Nocturnal animals, such
as the mammals of the time, and deep-sea animals, such as
fish, could have survived this higher ultraviolet intensity; but
daytime animals that lived on land or near the surface of the
waters would have been preferentially destroyed. Such a
disaster would be aptly named- the word itself means "bad
star."
If this sequence of events is correct, the major course of
biological evolution on the Earth in the last sixty-five million
years, and indeed the very existence of human beings, can be
traced to the death of a distant sun. Perhaps other planets
circled that star; perhaps one of those planets enjoyed a
thriving biology tortuously evolved over billions of years. The
supernova explosion would surely have extinguished all life on
that planet and probably even driven its atmosphere into space.

92

Do we owe our existence to a mighty stellar catastrophe that
elsewhere destroyed biospheres and worlds?
After the extinction of the dinosaurs, mammals moved into
daytime ecological niches. The primate fear of the dark must be
a comparatively recent development. Washburn has reported
that infant baboons and other young primates appear to be born
with only three inborn fears-of falling, snakes, and the
dark-corresponding respectively to the dangers posed by
Newtonian gravitation to tree-dwellers, by our ancient enemies
the reptiles, and by mammalian nocturnal predators, which must
have been particularly terrifying for the visually oriented
primates.
If the vampiric hypothesis is true-and it is at hest a likely
hypothesis-the function of sleep is built deeply into the
mammalian brain; from earliest mammalian times, sleep played
a fundamental role in survival. Since for primitive mammals
sleepless nights would have been more dangerous for the
survival of the taxon than sexless nights, sleep should be a
more powerful drive than sex-which, at least in most of us, it
seems to be. But eventually mammals evolved to a point where
sleep could be modified by changed circumstances. With the
extinction of the dinosaurs, daylight suddenly became a
benevolent environment for the mammals. Daytime
immobilization was no longer compulsory, and a wide variety of
sleep patterns slowly developed, including the contemporary
correlation of mammalian predators with extensive dreaming
and mammalian prey with a more watchful dreamless sleep.
Perhaps those people who can do with only a few hours' sleep a
night are the harbingers of a new human adaptation that will
take full advantage of the twenty-four hours of the day. I, for
one, freely confess envy for such an adaptation.
These conjectures on the origins of the mammals constitute a
kind of scientific myth: they may have some germ of truth in
them, but they are unlikely to be the whole story. That
scientific myths make contact with more ancient myths may or
may not be a coincidence. It is entirely possible that we are
able to invent scientific myths only because we have previously
been exposed to the other sort. Nevertheless, I cannot resist

93

connecting this account of the origin of mammals with another
curious aspect of the Genesis myth of the exile from Eden.
Because it is a reptile, of course, that offers the fruit of the
knowledge of good and-evil-abstract and moral neocortical
functions-to Adam and Eve.
There are today a few remaining large reptiles on Earth, the
most striking of which is the Komodo dragon of Indonesia:
cold-blooded, not very bright, but a predator exhibiting a
chilling fixity of purpose. With immense patience, it will stalk a
sleeping deer or boar, then suddenly slash a hind leg and hang
on until the prey bleeds to death. Prey is tracked by scent, and
a hunting dragon lumbers and sashays, head down, its forked
tongue flicking over the ground for chemical traces. The largest
adults weigh about 135 kilograms (300 pounds), are three
meters (about 10 feet) long and live perhaps to be centenarians.
To protect its eggs, the dragon digs trenches from two to as
much as nine meters (almost 30 feet) deep-probably a defense
against egg-eating mammals (and themselves: Adults are
known occasionally to stalk a nest-hole, waiting for the newly
hatched young to emerge and provide a little delicacy for
lunch). As another clear adaptation to predators, the dragon
hatchlings live in trees.
The remarkable elaboration of these adaptations shows clearly
that dragons are in trouble on the planet Earth. The Komodo
dragon lives in the wild only in the Lesser Sunda Islands.*
There are only about 2,000 of them left. The obscurity of their
locale immediately suggests that dragons are near extinction
because of mammalian, chiefly human, predation, a conclusion
borne out by their history over the last two centuries. All
dragons with less extreme adaptations or less remote habitats
are dead. I even wonder whether the systematic separation of
brain mass for a given body mass between mammals and
reptiles (see chart on page 39) might not be the result of a
systematic extinction of bright dragons by mammalian
predators. In any case, it is very likely that the population of
large reptiles has been declining steadily since the end of the
Mesozoic Age, and that there were many more of them even
one or two thousand years ago than there are today.

94

The pervasiveness of dragon myths in the folk legends of many
cultures is probably no accident.+
* It is in the Greater Sunda Islands-more specifically Java- that
the first specimen of Homo erectus, with an endocranial volume
of almost 1,000 cc, was found by E. Dubok in 1891.
+ Curiously, the first representative skull of Pelting man- the
Homo erectus whose remains are clearly associated with the
use of fire.
The implacable mutual hostility between man and dragon, as
exemplified in the myth of St. George, is strongest in the West.
(In chapter 3 of the Book of Genesis, God ordains an eternal
enmity between reptiles and humans.) But it is not a Western
anomaly. It is a worldwide phenomenon. Is it only an accident
that the common human sounds commanding silence or
attracting attention seem strangely imitative of the hissing of
reptiles? Is it possible that dragons posed a problem for our
protohuman ancestors of a few million years ago, and that the
terror they evoked and the deaths they caused helped bring
about the evolution of human intelligence? Or does the
metaphor of the serpent refer to the use of the aggressive and
ritualistic reptilian component of our brain in the further
evolution of the neocortex? With one exception, the Genesis
account of the temptation by a reptile in Eden is the only
instance in the Bible of humans understanding the language of
animals. When we feared the dragons, were we fearing a part
of ourselves? One way or another, there were dragons in Eden.
in Sinkiang Province, China, in a place called the Mountain of
Dragons.
The most recent dinosaur fossil is dated at about sixty million
years ago. The family of man (but not the genus Homo) is some
tens of millions of years old. Could there have been manlike
creatures who actually encountered Tyrannosaurus rex? Could
there have been dinosaurs that escaped the extinctions in the
late Cretaceous Period? Could the pervasive dreams and
common fears of "monsters," which children develop shortly

95

after they are able to talk, be evolutionary vestiges of quite
adaptive-baboonlike-responses to dragons and owls? *
* Since writing this passage I have discovered that Darwin
expressed a similar thought: "May we not suspect that the
vague but very real fears of children, which are quite
independent of experience, are inherited effects of real dangers
and abject superstitions during ancient savage times? It is quite
conformable with what we know of the transmission of formerly
well-developed characters, that they should appear at an early
period of life, and afterwards disappear-like gill slits in human
embryology."
What functions do dreams serve today? One view, published in
a reputable scientific paper, holds that the function of dreams is
to wake us up a little, every now and then, to see if anyone is
about to eat us. But dreams occupy such a relatively small part
of normal sleep that this explanation does not seem very
compelling. Moreover, as we have seen, the evidence points
just the other way: today it is the mammalian predators, not the
mammalian prey, who characteristically have dream-filled
sleep. Much more plausible is the computer-based explanation
that dreams are a spillover from the unconscious processing of
the day's experience, from the brain's decision on how much of
the daily events temporarily stored in a kind of buffer to
emplace in long-term memory. The events of yesterday
frequently run through my dreams; the events of two days ago,
much more rarely. However, the buffer-dumping model seems
unlikely to be the whole story, because it does not explain the
disguises that are so characteristic of the symbolic language of
dreams, a point first stressed by Freud. It also does not explain
the powerful affect or emotions of dreams; I believe there are
many people who have been far more thoroughly frightened by
their dreams than by anything they have ever experienced
while awake.
The buffer-dumping and memory-storage functions of dreams
have some interesting social implications. The American
psychiatrist Ernest Hartmann of Tufts University has provided
anecdotal but reasonably persuasive evidence that people who

96

are engaged in intellectual activities during the day, especially
unfamiliar intellectual activities, require more sleep at night,
while, by and large, those engaged in mainly repetitive and
intellectually unchallenging tasks are able to do with much less
sleep. However, in part for reasons of organizational
convenience, modern societies are structured as if all humans
had the same sleep requirements; and in many parts of the
world there is a satisfying sense of moral rectitude in rising
early. The amount of sleep required for buffer dumping would
then depend on how much we have both thought and
experienced since the last sleep period. (There is no evidence
that the causality runs backwards: people drugged with
phenobarbital are not reported, during interstitial waking
periods, to perform unusual intellectual accomplishments.) In
this respect it would be interesting to examine individuals with
very low sleep needs to determine whether the fraction of
sleep time they spend dreaming is larger than it is for those
with normal sleep requirements, and to determine whether their
amount of sleep and dream time increases with the quality and
quantity of their learning experiences while awake.
Michel Jouvet, a French neurologist at the University of Lyons,
has found that dream sleep is triggered in the pons, which,
while it resides in the hindbrain, is a late and essentially
mammalian evolutionary development. On the other hand,
Penfield has found that electrical stimulation deep into and
below the temporal lobe in the neocortex and limbic complex
can produce a waking state in epileptics very similar to that of
dreams denuded of their symbolic and fantastic aspects. It can
also induce the deja vu experience. Much of dream affect,
including fear, can also be induced by-such electrical
stimulation.
I once had a dream that will tantalize me forever. I dreamt I was
idly thumbing through a thick history text. I could tell from the
illustrations that the work was moving slowly, in the usual
manner of such textbooks, through the centuries: classical
times, Middle Ages, Renaissance and so on, gradually
approaching the modern era. But then there was World War II
with about two hundred pages left. With mounting excitement I

97

worked my way more deeply into the work until I was sure that
I had passed my own time. It was a history book that included
the future-like turning the December 31 page of the Cosmic
Calendar and finding a fully detailed January 1. Breathlessly I
attempted literally to read the future. But it was impossible. I
could make out individual words. I could even discern the serifs
on the individual characters. But I could not put the letters
together into words or words' together into sentences. I was
alexic.
Perhaps this is simply a metaphor of the unpredictability of the
future. But my invariable dream experience is that I am unable
to read, I can recognize, for example, a stop sign by its color
and its octagonal shape, but I cannot read the word STOP,
although I know it is there. I have the impression of
understanding the meaning of a page of type, but not by reading
it word by word or sentence by sentence. I cannot reliably
perform even simple arithmetic operations in the dream state. I
make a variety of verbal confusions of no apparent symbolic
significance, like mixing up Schumann and Schubert. I am a
little aphasic and entirely alexic. Not everyone I know has the
same cognitive impairment in the dream state, but people often
have some impairment. (Incidentally, individuals who are blind
from birth have auditory, not visual dreams.) The neocortex is
by no means altogether turned off in the dream state, but it
certainly seems to suffer important malfunctions.
The seeming fact that mammals and birds both dream while
their common ancestor, the reptiles, do not is surely
noteworthy. Major evolution beyond the reptiles has been
accompanied by and perhaps requires dreams. The electrically
distinctive sleep of birds is episodic and brief. If they dream,
they dream for only about a second at a time. But birds are, in
an evolutionary sense, much closer to reptiles than mammals
are. If we knew only about mammals, the argument would be
more shaky; but when both major taxonomic groups that have
evolved from the reptiles find themselves compelled to dream,
we must take the coincidence seriously. Why should an animal
that has evolved from a reptile have to dream while other

98

animals do not? Could it be because the reptilian brain is still
present and functioning?
It is extremely rare in the dream state that we bring ourselves
up short and say, "This is only a dream." By and large we
invest the dream content with reality. There are no rules of
internal consistency that dreams are required to follow. The
dream is a world of magic and ritual, passion and anger, but
very rarely of skepticism and reason. In the metaphor of the
triune brain, dreams are partially a function of the R-complex
and the limbic cortex, but not of the rational part of the
neocortex.
Experiments suggest that as the night wears on our dreams
engage increasingly earlier material from our past, reaching
back to childhood and infancy. At the same time the primary
process and emotional content of the dream also increase. We
are much more likely to dream of the passions of the cradle just
before awakening than just after falling asleep. This looks very
much as if the integration of the day's experience into our
memory, the forging of new neural links, is either an easier or a
more urgent task. As the night wears on and this function is
completed, the more affecting dreams, the more bizarre
material, the fears and lusts and other powerful emotions of the
dream material emerge. Late at night, when it is very still and
the obligatory daily dreams have been dreamt, the gazelles and
the dragons begin to stir.
One of the most significant tools in studying the dream state
was developed by William Dement, a Stanford University
psychiatrist, who is as sane as it is possible for a human being
to be, but who bears an exceedingly interesting name for a man
of his profession. The dream state is accompanied by rapid eye
movements (REM), which can be detected by electrodes taped
lightly over the eyelids in sleep, and by a particular brain wave
pattern on the EEG. Dement has found that everyone dreams
many times each night. On awakening, an individual in the midst
of REM sleep will usually remember his dream. Even people
who claim never to dream have been discovered by REM and
EEG criteria to dream as much as anyone else; and, when

99

awakened at appropriate times, they admit with some surprise
to having dreamt. The human brain is in a distinct physiological
state while dreaming, and we dream rather often. While perhaps
20 percent of the subjects awakened during REM sleep do not
recall their dreams, and some perhaps 10 percent of subjects
awakened during non-REM sleep report dreams, we will, for
convenience, identify REM and accompanying EEG patterns
with the dream state.
There is some evidence that dreaming is necessary. When
people or other mammals are deprived of REM sleep (by
awakening them as soon as the characteristic REM and EEG
dream patterns emerge), the number of initiations of the dream
state per night goes up, and, in severe cases, daytime
hallucinations-that is, waking dreams-occur. I have mentioned
that the REM and EEC patterns of dreams are brief in birds and
absent in reptiles. Dreams seem to be primarily a mammalian
function. What is more, dream sleep is most vigorously engaged
in by human beings in the early postnatal period. Aristotle
stated quite positively that infants do not dream at all. On the
contrary, we find they may be dreaming most of the time.
Full-term newborn babies spend more than half their sleep time
in the REM dream state. In infants born a few weeks premature,
the dream time is three-quarters or more of the total sleep
time. Earlier in its intrauterine existence, the fetus may be
dreaming all the time. (Indeed, newborn kittens are observed to
spend all of their sleep time in the REM stage.) Recapitulation
would then suggest that dreaming is an evolutionarily early and
basic mammalian function.
There is another connection between infancy and dreams: both
are followed by amnesia. When we emerge from either state,
we have great difficulty remembering what we have
experienced. In both cases, I would suggest, the left
hemisphere of the neocortex, which is responsible for analytic
recollection, has been functioning ineffectively. An alternative
explanation is that in both dreams and early childhood we
experience a kind of traumatic amnesia: The experiences are
too painful to remember. But many dreams we forget are very
pleasant, and it is difficult to believe that infancy is that
unpleasant. Also some children seem capable of remembering

100

extremely early experiences. Memories of events late in the
first year of life are not extremely rare, and there are possible
examples of even earlier recollections. At age three, my son
Nicholas was asked for the earliest event he could recall and
replied in a hushed tone while staring into middle distance, "It
was red, and I was very cold." He was born by Caesarean
section. It is probably very unlikely, but I wonder whether this
could just possibly be a true birth memory.
At any rate, I think it is much more likely that childhood and
dream amnesia arise from the fact that in those states our
mental lives are determined almost entirely by the R-complex,
the limbic system and the right cerebral hemisphere. In earliest
childhood, the neocortex is underdeveloped; in amnesia, it is
impaired.
There is a striking correlation of penile or clitoral erection with
REM sleep, even when the manifest dream content has no overt
sexual aspects whatever. In primates, such erections are
connected with sex (of course!), aggression and the
maintenance of social hierarchies. I think that when we dream
there is a part of us engaged in activities rather like those of
the squirrel monkeys I saw in Paul MacLean's laboratory. The
R-complex is functioning in the dreams of humans; the dragons
can be heard, hissing and rasping, and the dinosaurs thunder
still.
One excellent test of the merit of scientific ideas is their
subsequent validation. A theory is put forward on fragmentary
evidence, then an experiment is performed, the outcome of
which the proposer of the theory could not know. If the
experiment confirms the original idea, this is usually taken as
strong support for the theory. Freud held that the great
majority, perhaps all, of the "psychic energy" of our
primary-process emotions and dream material is sexual in
origin. The absolutely essential role of sexual interest in
providing for the propagation of the species makes this idea
neither as silly nor as depraved as it appeared to many of
Freud's Victorian contemporaries. Carl Gustav Jung, for
example, held that Freud had severely overstated the primacy

101

of sex in the affairs of the unconscious. But now,
three-quarters of a century later, experiments in the
laboratories of Dement and other psychologists appear to
support Freud. It would, I think, require a very dedicated
puritanism to deny some connection between penile or clitoral
erection and sex. It seems to follow that sex and dreams are
not casually or incidentally connected but rather have deep and
fundamental ties-although dreams certainly partake of ritual,
aggressive and hierarchical material as well. Particularly
considering the state of sexual repression in
late-nineteenth-century Viennese society, many of Freud's
insights seem hard-won and courageous as well as valid.
Statistical studies have been made of the most common
categories of dreams-studies which, at least to some extent,
ought to illuminate the nature of dreams. In a survey of the
dreams of college students, the following were, in order, the
five most frequent types: (1) falling; (2) being pursued or
attacked; (3) attempting repeatedly and unsuccessfully to
perform a task; (4) various academic learning experiences; and
(5) diverse sexual experiences. Number (4) on this list seems
of special and particular concern to the group being sampled.
The others, while sometimes actually encountered in the lives
of undergraduates, are likely to be applicable generally, even to
non-students.
The fear of falling seems clearly connected with our arboreal
origins and is a fear we apparently share with other primates. If
you live in a tree, the easiest way to die is simply to forget the
danger of falling. The other three categories of most common
dreams are particularly interesting because they correspond to
aggressive, hierarchical, ritualistic and sexual functions -the
realm of the R-complex. Another provocative statistic is that
almost half of the people queried reported dreams about
snakes, the only nonhuman animal rating a category all to itself
in the twenty most common dreams. It is, of course, possible
that many snake dreams have a straightforward Freudian
interpretation. However, two-thirds of the respondents
reported explicitly sexual dreams. Since, according to
Wash-burn, young primates exhibit an untaught fear of snakes,

102

it is easy to wonder whether the dream world does not point
directly as well as indirectly to the ancient hostility between
reptiles and mammals.
There is one hypothesis that seems to me consistent with all
the foregoing facts: The evolution of the limbic system involved
a radically new way of viewing the world. The survival of the
early mammals depended on intelligence, daytime
unobtrusiveness, and devotion to the young. The world as
perceived through the R-complex was quite a different world.
Because of the accretionary nature of the evolution of the
brain, R-complex functions could be utilized or partially
bypassed but not ignored. Thus, an inhibition center developed
below what in humans is the temporal lobe, to turn off much of
the functioning of the reptilian brain; and an activation center
evolved in the pons to turn on the R-complex, but harmlessly,
during sleep. This view, of course, has some notable points of
similarity to Freud's picture of the repression of the id by the
superego (or of the unconscious by the conscious), with
expressions of the id made most clearly manifest in slips of the
tongue, free associations, dreams and the like-that is, during
the interstices of superego repression.
With the large-scale development of the neocortex in higher
mammals and primates, some neocortical involvement in the
dream state developed-a symbolic language is, after all, still a
language. (This is related to the different functions of the two
hemispheres of the neocortex, described in the following
chapter.) But the dream imagery contained significant sexual,
aggressive, hierarchical and ritualistic elements. The fantastic
material in the dream world may be connected with the
near-absence of direct sensory stimulation during dreams.

There is very little reality testing in the dream state. The
prevalence of dreams in infants would, in this view, be because,
in infancy, the analytic part of the neocortex is barely working.
The absence of dreams in reptiles would be because there is no
repression of the dream state in reptiles; they are, as
Aeschylus described our ancestors, "dreaming" in their waking
state. I believe this idea can explain the strangeness-that is,
the differences from our waking verbal consciousness-of the
dream state; its mammalian and human neonatal localization; its
physiology; and its pervasiveness in man.
We are descended from reptiles and mammals both. In the
daytime repression of the R-complex and in the nighttime
stirring of the dream dragons, we may each of us be replaying
the hundred-million-year-old warfare between the reptiles and
the mammals. Only the times of day of the vampiric hunt have
been reversed.
Human beings exhibit enough reptilian behavior as it is. If we
gave full rein to the reptilian aspects of our nature, we would

104

clearly have a low survival potential. Because the R-complex is
woven so intimately into the fabric of the brain, its functions
cannot be entirely avoided for long. Perhaps the dream state
permits, in our fantasy and its reality, the R-complex to
function regularly, as if it were still in control.
If this is true, I wonder, after Aeschylus, if the waking state of
other mammals is very much like the dream state of
humans-where we can recognize signs, such as the feeling of
running water and the smell of honeysuckle, but have an
extremely limited repertoire of symbols such as words; where
we encounter vivid sensory and emotional images and active
intuitive understanding, but very little rational analysis; where
we are unable to perform tasks requiring extensive
concentration; where we experience short attention spans and
frequent distractions and, most of all, a very feeble sense of
individuality or self, which gives way to a pervading fatalism, a
sense of unpredictable buffeting by uncontrollable events. If
this is where we have come from, we have come very far.

"Notes and Observations on The Empress of Morocco," 1674
BLOODHOUNDS have a widely celebrated ability to track by
smell. They are presented with a "trace"-a scrap of clothing
belonging to the target, the lost child or the escaped
convict-and then, barking, bound joyously and accurately down
the trail. Canines and many other hunting animals have such
ability in extremely well developed form. The original trace
contains an olfactory cue, a smell. A smell is merely the
perception of a particular variety of molecule-in this case, an
organic molecule. For the bloodhound to track, it must be able
to sense the difference in smell -in characteristic body
molecules-between the target and a bewildering and noisy
background of other molecules, some from other humans who
have gone the same way (including those organizing the
tracking expedition) and some from other animals (including the
dog itself). The number of molecules shed by a human being
while walking is relatively small. Yet even on a fairly "cold"
trail-say, several hours after the disappearance-bloodhounds
can track successfully. This remarkable ability involves
extremely sensitive olfactory detection, a function, as we saw
earlier, performed well even by insects. But what is most
striking about the bloodhound and different from insects is the
richness of its discriminative ability, its aptitude in
distinguishing among many different smells, each in an immense
background of other odors. The bloodhound performs a
sophisticated cataloging of molecular structure; it distinguishes
the new molecule from a very large library of other molecules
previously smelled. What is more, the bloodhound needs only a
minute or less to familiarize itself to the smell, which it can
then remember for extensive periods of time.
The olfactory recognition of individual molecules is apparently
accomplished by individual nasal receptors sensitive to
particular functional groups, or parts, of organic molecules. One
receptor, for example, may be sensitive to COOH, another to
NH2, and so on. (C stands for carbon. H for hydrogen, O for
oxygen and N for nitrogen.) The various appurtenances and
projections of the complex molecules apparently adhere to

106

different molecular receptors in the nasal mucosa, and the
detectors for all the functional groups combine to put together
a kind of collective olfactory image of the molecule. This is an
extremely sophisticated sensory system. The most elaborate
man-made device of this sort, the gas chromatograph/mass
spectrometer, has in general neither the sensitivity nor the
discriminative ability of the bloodhound, although substantial
progress is being made in this technology. The olfactory
system of animals has evolved into its present sophistication
because of strong selection pressures. Early detection of
mates, predators and prey is a matter of life and death for the
species. The sense of smell is very ancient, and indeed, much
of the early evolution above the level of the neural chassis may
have been spurred by selection pressure for such molecular
detection: the distinctive olfactory bulbs in the brain (see figure
on page 55) are among the first components of the neocortex to
have developed in the history of life. Indeed, the limbic system
was called the "rhinencephalon," the smell-brain, by Herrick.
The sense of smell is not nearly so well developed in humans
as in bloodhounds. Despite the massive-ness of our brains, our
olfactory bulbs are smaller than those of many other animals,
and it is clear that smell plays a very minor role in our
everyday lives. The average person is able to distinguish
relatively few smells. Our verbal descriptions and analytic
comprehension of smell, even with only a few odors in our
repertoire, is extremely poor. Our response to an odor hardly
resembles, in our own perception, the actual three-dimensional
structure of the molecule responsible for the smell. Olfaction is
a complex cognitive task which we can, within limits,
perform-and with considerable accuracy-but which we can
describe inadequately at best. And if the bloodhound could
speak, I think it would be at a similar loss to describe the
details of what it does so supremely well.
Just as smell is the principal means by which dogs and many
other animals perceive their surroundings, sight is the primary
information channel in humans. We are capable of visual
sensitivity and discrimination at least as impressive as the
olfactory abilities of the bloodhound. For example, we are able

107

to discriminate among faces. Careful observers can distinguish
among tens or even hundreds of thousands of different faces;
and the "Identikit," widely used by Interpol and by police forces
in the West generally, is capable of reconstructing more than
ten billion different faces. The survival value of such an ability,
particularly for our ancestors, is quite clear. Yet consider how
incapable we are of describing verbally faces that we are
perfectly capable of recognizing. Witnesses commonly exhibit a
total failure in verbal description of an individual previously
encountered, but high accuracy in recognizing the same
individual when seen again. And while cases of mistaken
identity have certainly occurred, courts of law seem willing to
admit the testimony of any adult witness on questions of facial
recognition. Consider how easily we can pick, from a vast
crowd of faces, a "celebrity"; or how in a dense non-ordered
list our own name leaps out at us.
Human beings and other animals have very sophisticated
high-data-rate perceptual and cognitive abilities that simply
bypass the verbal and analytic consciousness that so many of
us regard as all of us there is. This other kind of knowing, our
nonverbal perceptions and cognitions, is often described as
"intuitive." The word does not mean "innate." No one is born
with a repertoire of faces implanted in his brain. The word
conveys, I think, a diffuse annoyance at our inability to
understand how we come by such knowledge. But intuitive
knowledge has an extremely long evolutionary history; if we
consider the information contained in the genetic material, it
goes back to the origin of life. The other of our two modes of
knowing-the one that in the West expresses irritation about the
existence of intuitive knowledge-is a quite recent evolutionary
accretion. Rational thinking that is fully verbal (involving
complete sentences, say) is probably only tens or hundreds of
thousands of years old. There are many people who are, in
their conscious lives, almost entirely rational, and many who
are almost entirely intuitive. Each group, with very little
appreciation of the reciprocal value of these two kinds of
cognitive ability, derides the other: "muddled" and "amoral" are
typical adjectives used in the more polite of such exchanges.
Why should we have two different, accurate and complementary

108

modes of thinking which are so poorly integrated with each
other?
The first evidence that these two modes of thinking are
localized in the cerebral cortex has come from the study of
brain lesions. Accidents or strokes in the temporal or parietal
lobes of the left hemisphere of the neocortex characteristically
result in impairment of the ability to read, write, speak and do
arithmetic. Comparable lesions in the right hemisphere lead to
impairment of three-dimensional vision, pattern recognition,
musical ability and holistic reasoning. Facial recognition resides
preferentially in the right hemisphere, and those who "never
forget a face" are performing pattern recognition on the right
side. Injuries to the right parietal lobe, in fact, sometimes
results in the inability of a patient to recognize his own face in
a mirror or photograph. Such observations strongly suggest
that those functions we describe as "rational" live mainly in the
left hemisphere, and those we consider "intuitive," mainly in the
right.
The most significant recent experiments along these lines have
been performed by Roger Sperry and his collaborators at the
California Institute of Technology. In an attempt to treat severe
cases of grand mal epilepsy, where patients suffer from
virtually continuous seizures (as frequent as twice an hour,
forever), they cut the corpus callosum, the main bundle of
neural fibers connecting the left and right hemispheres of the
neocortex (see the figure on page 167). The operation was an
effort to prevent a kind of neuroelectrical storm in one
hemisphere from propagating, far from its focus, into the other.
The hope was that at least one of the two postoperative
hemispheres would be unaffected by subsequent seizures. The
unexpected and welcome result was that the frequency and
intensity of the seizures declined dramatically in both
hemispheres-as if there had previously been a positive
feedback, with the epileptic electrical activity in each
hemisphere stimulating the other through the corpus callosum.
Such "split-brain" patients appear, superficially, entirely normal
after the surgery. Some report a complete cessation of the

109

vivid dreams they experienced before the operation. The first
such patient was unable to speak for a month after the
operation, but his aphasia later disappeared. The normal
behavior and appearance of split-brain patients in itself
suggests that the function of the corpus callosum is subtle.
Here is a bundle of two hundred million neural fibers
processing something like several billion bits per second
between the two cerebral hemispheres. It contains about 2
percent of the total number of neurons in the neocortex. And
yet when it is cut, nothing seems to change. I think it is obvious
that there must in fact be significant changes, but ones that
require a deeper scrutiny.
When we examine an object to our right, both eyes are viewing
what is called the right visual field; and to our left, the left
visual field. But because of the way the optic nerves are
connected, the right visual field is processed in the left
hemisphere and the left visual field in the right hemisphere.
Likewise, sounds from the right ear are processed primarily in
the left hemisphere of the brain and vice versa, although there
is some audio processing on the same side-for example,
sounds from the left ear in the left hemisphere. No such
crossing of function occurs in the more primitive sense of
smell, and an odor detected by the left nostril only is processed
exclusively in the left hemisphere. But information sent
between the brain and the limbs is crossed. Objects felt by the
left hand are perceived primarily in the right hemisphere, and
instructions to the right hand to write a sentence are processed
in the left hemisphere. In 90 percent of human subjects, the
centers for speech are in the left hemisphere.
Sperry and his collaborators have performed an elegant series
of experiments in which separate stimuli are presented to the
left and right hemispheres of split-brain patients. In a typical
experiment, the word hatband is flashed on a screen-but hat is
in the left visual field and band in the right visual field. The
patient reports that he saw the word band, and it is clear that,
at least in terms of his ability to communicate verbally, he has
no idea that the right hemisphere received a visual impression
of the word hat. When asked what kind of band it was, the

110

patient might guess: outlaw band, rubber band, jazz band. But
when, in comparable experiments, the patient is asked to write
what he saw, but with his left hand inside a box, he scrawls the
word hat. He knows from the motion of his hand that he has
written something, but because he cannot see it, there is no
way for the information to arrive in the left hemisphere which
controls verbal ability. Bewilderingly, he can write, but cannot
utter, the answer.
Many other experiments exhibit similar results. In one, the
patient is able to feel three-dimensional plastic letters which
are out of view with his left hand. The available letters can
spell only one correct English word, such as love or cup, which
the patient is able to work out: the right hemisphere has a weak
verbal ability, roughly comparable to that in dreams. But after
correctly spelling the word, the patient is unable to give any
verbal indication of what word he has spelled. It seems clear
that in split-brain patients, each hemisphere has scarcely the
faintest idea what the other hemisphere has learned.
The geometrical incompetence of the left hemisphere is
impressive; it is depicted by the illustration on the opposite
page: A right-handed split-brain patient was able to copy
simple representations of three-dimensional figures accurately
only with his (inexperienced) left hand. The right hemisphere's
superiority at geometry seems restricted to manipulative tasks;
this dominance does not hold for other sorts of geometrical
functions that do not require hand-eye-brain coordination.
These manipulative geometrical activities seem to be localized
in the right hemisphere's parietal lobe, in a place that, in the
left hemisphere, is devoted to language. M. S. Gazzaniga of the
State University of New York at Stony Brook suggests that this
hemispheric specialization occurs because language is
developed in the left hemisphere before the child acquires
substantial competence in manipulative skills and geometrical
visualization. According to this view, the specialization of the
right hemisphere for geometrical competence is a specialization
by default-the left hemisphere's competence has been
redirected toward language.

111

Shortly after one of Sperry's most convincing experiments had
been completed, he gave a party, so the story goes, to which a
famous theoretical physicist with an intact corpus callosum was
invited. The physicist, known for his lively sense of humor, sat
quietly through the party, listening with interest to Sperry's
description of the split-brain findings. The evening passed, the
guests trickled away, and Sperry found, himself at the door
bidding goodbye to the last of them. The physicist extended his
right hand, shook Sperry's and told him what a fascinating
evening he had had. Then, with a little two-step, he changed
the positions of his right and left feet, extended his left hand,
and said in a strangled, high-pitched voice, "And I want you to
know I had a terrific time too."
When communication between the two cerebral hemispheres is
impaired, the patient often finds his own behavior inexplicable,
and it is clear that even in "good speaking" the speaker may not
know "the truth of the matter." (Compare with the remark on
page 2, from the Phaedrus.) The relative independence of the
two hemispheres is apparent in everyday life. We have already
mentioned the difficulty of describing verbally the complex
perceptions of the right hemisphere. Many elaborate physical
tasks, including athletics, seem to have relatively little
left-hemisphere involvement. A well-known "ploy" in tennis,
for example, is to ask your opponent exactly where on the
racket he places his thumb. It often happens that
left-hemisphere attention to this question will, at least for a
brief period, destroy his game. A great deal of musical ability is
a right-hemisphere function. It is a commonplace that we may
memorize a song or a piece of music without having the least
ability to write it down in musical notation. In piano, we might
describe this by saying that our fingers (but not we) have
memorized the piece.
Such memorization can be quite complex. I recently had the
pleasure of witnessing the rehearsal of a new piano concerto by
a major symphony orchestra. In such rehearsals the conductor
does not often start from the beginning and run through to the
end. Rather, because of the expense of rehearsal time as well
as the competence of the performers, he concentrates on the

112

difficult passages. I was impressed that not only had the soloist
memorized the entire piece, she was also able to begin at any
requested place in the composition after only a brief glance at
the designated measure in the score. This enviable skill is a
mixed left and right hemisphere function. It is remarkably
difficult to memorize a piece of music you have never heard so
that you are able to intervene in any measure. In computer
terminology, the pianist had random access as opposed to serial
access to the composition.
This is a good example of the cooperation between left and
right hemispheres in many of the most difficult and highly
valued human activities. It is vital not to overestimate the
separation of functions on either side of the corpus callosum in
a normal human being. The existence of so complex a cabling
system as the corpus callosum must mean, it is important to
stress again, that interaction of the hemispheres is a vital
human function.
In addition to the corpus callosum there is another neural
cabling between the left and right hemispheres, which is called
the anterior commissure. It is much smaller than the corpus
callosum (see figure on page 167), and exists, as the corpus
callosum does not, in the brain of the fish. In human split-brain
experiments in which the corpus callosum is cut, but not the
anterior commissure, olfactory information is invariably
transferred between the hemispheres. Occasional transfer of
some visual and auditory information through the anterior
commissure also seems to occur, but un-predictably from
patient to patient. These findings are consistent with anatomy
and evolution; the anterior commissure (and the hippocampal
commissure; see the figure on p. 167) lies deeper than the
corpus callosum and transfers information in the limbic cortex
and perhaps in other more ancient components of the brain.
Humans exhibit an interesting separation of musical and verbal
skills. Patients with lesions of the right temporal lobe or right
hemispherectomies are significantly impaired in musical but not
in verbal ability- in particular in the recognition and recall of
melodies. But their ability to read music is unimpaired. This
seems perfectly consistent with the separation of functions
described: the memorization and appreciation of music involves

113

the recognition of auditory patterns and a holistic rather than
analytic temperament. There is some evidence that poetry is
partly a right-hemisphere function; in some cases the patient
begins to write poetry for the first time in his life after a lesion
in the left hemisphere has left him aphasic. But this would
perhaps be, in Dryden's words, "mere poetry." Also, the right
hemisphere is apparently unable to rhyme.
The separation or lateralization of cortical function was
discovered by experiments on brain-damaged individuals. It is,
however, important to demonstrate that the conclusions apply
to normal humans. Experiments carried out by Gazzaniga
present brain-undamaged individuals with a word half in the left
and half in the right visual fields, as in split-brain patients, and
the reconstruction of the word is monitored. The results
indicate that, in the normal brain, the right hemisphere does
very little processing of language but instead transmits what it
has observed across the corpus callosum to the left
hemisphere, where the entire word is put together. Gazzaniga
also found a split-brain patient whose right hemisphere was
astonishingly competent in language skills: but this patient had
experienced a brain pathology in the temporal-parietal region
of the left hemisphere at an early age. We have already
mentioned the ability of the brain to relocalize functions after
injury in the first two years of life, but not thereafter.
Robert Ornstein and David Galin of the Langley Porter
Neuropsychiatric Institute in San Francisco claim that as normal
people change from analytic to synthetic intellectual activities
the EEG activity of the corresponding cerebral hemispheres
varies in the predicted way: when a subject is performing
mental arithmetic, for example, the right hemisphere exhibits
the alpha rhythm characteristic of an "idling" cerebral
hemisphere. If this result is confirmed, it would be quite an
important finding.
Ornstein offers an interesting analogy to explain why, in the
West at least, we have made so much contact with
left-hemisphere functions and so little with right. He suggests
that our awareness of right hemisphere function is a little like

114

our ability to see stars in the daytime. The sun is so bright that
the stars are invisible, despite the fact that they are just as
present in our sky in the daytime as at night. When the sun
sets, we are able to perceive the stars. In the same way, the
brilliance of our most recent evolutionary accretion, the verbal
abilities of the left hemisphere, obscures our awareness of the
functions of the intuitive right hemisphere, which in our
ancestors must have been the principal means of perceiving the
world.*
The left hemisphere processes information sequentially; the
right hemisphere simultaneously, accessing several inputs at
once. The left hemisphere works in series; the right in parallel.
The left hemisphere is something like a digital computer; the
right like an analog computer. Sperry suggested that the
separation of function in the two hemispheres is the
consequence of a "basic incompatibility." Perhaps we are today
able to sense directly the operations of the right hemisphere
mainly when the left hemisphere has "set"-that is, in dreams.
* Marijuana is often described as improving our appreciation of
and abilities in music, dance, art, pattern and sign recognition
and our sensitivity to nonverbal communication. To the best of
my knowledge, it is never reported as improving our ability to
read and comprehend Ludwig Wittgenstein or Immanuel Kant;
to calculate the stresses on bridges; or to compute Laplace
transformations. Often the subject has difficulty even in writing
down his thoughts coherently. I wonder if, rather than
enhancing anything, the cannabinols (the active ingredients in
marijuana) simply suppress the left hemisphere and permit the
stars to come out. This may also be the objective of the
meditative states of many Oriental religions.
In the previous chapter, I proposed that a major aspect of the
dream state might be the unleashing, at night, of R-complex
processes that had been largely repressed by the neocortex
during the day. But I mentioned that the important symbolic
content of dreams showed significant neocortical involvement,
although the frequently reported impairments in reading,

115

writing, arithmetic and verbal recall suffered in dreams were
striking.
In addition to the symbolic content of dreams, other aspects of
dream imagery point to a neocortical presence in the dream
process. For example, I have many times experienced dreams
in which the denouement or critical "plot surprise" was possible
only because of clues-apparently unimportant-inserted much
earlier into the dream content. The entire plot development of
the dream must have been in my mind at the time the dream
began. (Incidentally, the time taken for dream events has been
shown by Dement to be approximately equal to the time the
same events would have taken in real life.) While the content of
many dreams seems haphazard, others are remarkably well
structured; these dreams have a remarkable resemblance to
drama.
We now recognize the very attractive possibility that the left
hemisphere of the neocortex is suppressed in the dream state,
while the right hemisphere-which has an extensive familiarity
with signs but only a halt-ting verbal literacy-is functioning
well. It may be that the left hemisphere is not entirely turned
off at night but instead is performing tasks that make it
inaccessible to consciousness: it is busily engaged in data
dumping from the short-term memory buffer, determining what
should survive into long-term storage.
There are occasional but reliably reported instances of difficult
intellectual problems solved during sleep. Perhaps the most
famous is the dream of the German chemist Friedrich Kekule
von Stradonitz. In 1865 the most pressing and puzzling problem
in organic structural chemistry was the nature of the benzene
molecule. The structure of several simple organic molecules
had been deduced from their properties, and all were linear, the
constituent atoms being attached to each other in a straight
line. According to his own account, Kekule was dozing on a
horse-drawn tram when he had a kind of dream of dancing
atoms in linear arrangements. Abruptly the tail of a chain of
atoms attached itself to the head and formed a slowly rotating
ring. On awakening and recalling this dream fragment, Kekule

116

realized instantly that the solution to the benzene problem was
a hexagonal ring of carbon atoms rather than a straight chain.
Observe, however, that this is quintessentially a
pattern-recognition exercise and not an analytic activity. It is
typical of almost all of the famous creative acts accomplished in
the dream state: they are right-hemisphere and not
left-hemisphere activities.
The American psychoanalyst Erich Fromm has written: "Must
we not expect that, when deprived of the outside world, we
regress temporarily to a primitive animal-like unreasonable
state of mind? Much can be said in favor of such an assumption,
and the view that such a regression is the essential feature of
the state of sleep, and thus of dream activity, has been held by
many students of dreaming from Plato to Freud." Fromm goes
on to point out that we sometimes achieve in the dream state
insights that have evaded us when awake. But I believe these
insights always have an intuitive or pattern-recognition
character. The "animal-like" aspect of the dream state can be
understood as the activities of the R-complex and the limbic
system, and the occasionally blazing intuitive insight as the
activity of the right hemisphere of the neocortex. Both cases
occur because in each the repressive functions of the left
hemisphere are turned off. These right-hemisphere insights
Fromm calls "the forgotten language"-and he plausibly argues
that they are the common origin of dreams, fairy tales and
myths.
In dreams we are sometimes aware that a small portion of us is
placidly watching; often, off in a corner of the dream, there is a
kind of observer. It is this "watcher" part of our minds that
occasionally-sometimes in the midst of a nightmare-will say to
us, "This is only a dream." It is the "watcher" who appreciates
the dramatic unity of a finely structured dream plot. Most of the
time, however, the "watcher" is entirely silent. In psychedelic
drug experiences-for example, with marijuana or LSD-the
presence of such a "watcher" is commonly reported. LSD
experiences may be terrifying in the extreme, and several
people have told me that the difference between sanity and
insanity in the LSD experience rests entirely on the continued

117

presence of the "watcher," a small, silent portion of the waking
consciousness.
In one marijuana experience, my informant became aware of
the presence and, in a strange way, the in-appropriateness of
this silent "watcher," who responds with interest and occasional
critical comment to the kaleidoscopic dream imagery of the
marijuana experience but is not part of it. "Who are you?" my
informant silently asked it. "Who wants to know?" it replied,
making the experience very like a Sufi or Zen parable. But my
informant's question is a deep one. I would suggest the
observer is a small part of the critical faculties of the left
hemisphere, functioning much more in psychedelic than in
dream experiences, but present to a degree in both. However,
the ancient query, "Who is it who asks the question?" is still
unanswered; perhaps it is another component of the left
cerebral hemisphere.
An asymmetry in the temporal lobes in left and right
hemispheres of humans and of chimpanzees has been found,
with one portion of the left lobe significantly more developed.
Human infants are born with this asymmetry (which develops as
early as the twenty-ninth week of gestation), thus suggesting a
strong genetic predisposition to control speech in the left
temporal lobe. (Nevertheless, children with lesions in the left
temporal lobe are able, in their first year or two of life, to
develop all speech functions in the comparable portion of the
right hemisphere with no impairment. At a later age, this
replacement is impossible.) Also, lateralization is found in the
behavior of young children. They are better able to understand
verbal material with the right ear and nonverbal material with
the left, a regularity also found in adults. Similarly, infants
spend more time on the average looking at objects on their
right than at identical objects on their left, and require a louder
noise in the left ear than in the right to elicit a response. While
no clear asymmetry of these sorts has yet been found in the
brains or behavior of apes, Dewson's results (see page 123)
suggest that some lateralization may exist in the higher
primates; there is no evidence for anatomical asymmetries in
the temporal lobes of, say, rhesus monkeys. One would

118

certainly guess that the linguistic abilities of chimpanzees are
governed, as in humans, in the left temporal lobe.
The limited inventory of symbolic cries among non-human
primates seems to be controlled by the limbic system; at least
the full vocal repertoire of squirrel and rhesus monkeys can be
evoked by electrical stimulation in the limbic system. Human
language is controlled in the neocortex. Thus an essential step
in human evolution must have been the transfer of control of
vocal language from the limbic system to the temporal lobes of
the neocortex, a transition from instinctual to learned
communication. However, the surprising ability of apes to
acquire gestural language and the hint of lateralization in the
chimpanzee brain suggest that the acquisition of voluntary
symbolic language by-primates is not a recent invention.
Rather, it goes back many millions of years, consistent with the
evidence from endocranial casts for Broca's area in Homo
habilis.
Lesions in the monkey brain of the neocortical areas
responsible for speech in humans fail to impair their instinctual
vocalizations. The development of human language must
therefore involve an essentially new brain system and not
merely a reworking of the machinery for limbic cries and calls.
Some experts in human evolution have suggested that the
acquisition of language occurred very late-perhaps only in the
last few tens of thousands of years-and was connected with the
challenges of the last ice age. But the data do not seem to be
consistent with this view; moreover, the speech centers of the
human brain are so complex that it is very difficult to imagine
their evolution in the thousand or so generations since the peak
of the most recent glaciation.
The evidence suggests that in our ancestors of some tens of
millions of years ago there was a neocortex, but one in which
the left and right hemispheres served comparable and
redundant functions. Since then, upright posture, the use of
tools, and the development of language have mutually advanced
one another, a small increment in language ability, for example,
permitting the incremental improvement of hand axes, and vice

119

versa. The corresponding brain evolution seems to have
proceeded by specializing one of the two hemispheres for
analytic thinking.
The original redundancy, by the way, represents prudent
computer design. For example, with no knowledge of the
neuroanatomy of the cerebral cortex, the engineers who
designed the on-board memory of the Viking lander inserted
two identical computers, which are identically programmed. But
because of their complexity, differences between the
computers soon emerged. Before landing on Mars the
computers were given an intelligence test (by a smarter
computer back on Earth). The dumber brain was then turned
off. Perhaps "human evolution has proceeded m a similar
manner and our highly prized rational and analytical abilities are
localized in the "other" brain-the one that was not fully
competent to do intuitive thinking. Evolution often uses this
strategy. Indeed, the standard evolutionary practice of
increasing the amount of genetic information as organisms
increase in complexity is accomplished by doubling part of the
genetic material and then allowing the slow specialization of
function of the redundant set.
Almost without exception all human languages have built into
them a polarity, a veer to the right. "Right" is associated with
legality, correct behavior, high moral principles, firmness, and
masculinity; "left," with weakness, cowardice, diffuseness of
purpose, evil, and femininity. In English, for example, we have
"rectitude," "rectify," "righteous," "right-hand man," "dexterity,"
"adroit" (from the French "< a droite"), "rights," as in "the rights
of man," and the phrase "in his right mind." Even
"ambidextrous" means, ultimately, two right hands.
On the other side (literally), we have "sinister" (almost exactly
the Latin word for "left"), "gauche" (precisely the French word
for "left"), "gawky," "gawk," and "left-handed compliment." The
Russian "nalevo" for "left" also means "surreptitious." The
Italian "mancino" for "left" signifies "deceitful." There is no "Bill
of Lefts."

120

In one etymology, "left" comes from "lyft," the Anglo-Saxon for
weak or worthless. "Right" in the legal sense (as an action in
accord with the rules of society) and "right" in the logical sense
(as the opposite of erroneous) are also commonplaces in many
languages. The political use of right and left seems to date from
the moment when a significant lay political force arose as
counterpoise to the nobility. The nobles were placed on the
king's right and the radical upstarts -the capitalists-on his left.
The nobles were to the royal right, of course, because the king
himself was a noble; and his right side was the favored
position. And in theology as in politics: "At the right hand of
God."
Many examples of a connection between "right" and "straight"
can be found.* In Mexican Spanish you indicate straight (ahead)
by saying "right right"; in Black American English, "right on" is
an expression of approval, often for a sentiment eloquently or
deftly-phrased. "Straight" meaning conventional, correct or
proper is a commonplace in colloquial English today. In Russian,
right is "/bravo," a cognate of "pravda," which means "true."
And in many languages "true" has the additional meaning of
"straight" or "accurate," as in "his aim was true."
The Stanford-Binet IQ test makes some effort to examine both
left- and right-hemisphere function. For right-hemisphere
function there are tests in which the subject is asked to predict
the opened configuration of a piece of paper after it is folded
several times and a small piece cut out with a pair of scissors;
or to estimate the total number of blocks in a stack when some
blocks are hidden from view. Although the devisers of the
Stanford-Binet test consider such questions of geometric
conception to be very useful in determining the "intelligence" of
children, they are said to be increasingly less useful in IQ tests
of teenagers and adults. There is certainly little room on such
examinations for testing intuitive leaps. Unsurprisingly, IQ tests
also seem to be powerfully biased toward the left hemisphere.
* I wonder if there is any significance to the fact that Latin,
Germanic and Slavic languages, for example, are written left to
right, and Semitic languages, right to left. The ancient Greeks

121

wrote in boustrophedon ("as the ox plows"); left to right on one
line, right to left on the next.
The vehemence of the prejudices in favor of the left
hemisphere and the right hand reminds me of a war in which
the side that barely won renames the contending parties and
issues, so that future generations will have no difficulty in
deciding where prudent loyalty should lie. When Lenin's party
was a fairly small splinter group in Russian socialism he named
it the Bolshevik party, which in Russian means the majority
party. The opposition obligingly, and with awesome stupidity,
accepted the designation of Mensheviks, the minority party. In
a decade and a half they were. Similarly, in the worldwide
associations of the words "right" and "left" there is evidence of
a rancorous conflict early in the history of mankind.* What
could arouse such powerful emotions?
In combat with weapons which cut or stab-and in such sports
as boxing, baseball and tennis-a participant trained in the use
of the right hand will find himself at a disadvantage when
confronted unexpectedly with a left-hander. Also, a malevolent
left-handed swordsman might be able to come quite close to
his adversary with his unencumbered right hand appearing as a
gesture of disarmament and peace. But these circumstances do
not seem to be able to explain the breadth and depth of
antipathy to the left hand, nor the extension of right chauvinism
to women-traditional noncombatants.
* A quite different set of circumstances is revealed by another
pair of verbal polar opposites: black and white. Despite English
phrases of the sort "as different as black and white," the two
words appear to have the same origin. Black comes from the
Anglo-Saxon "blaece," and white from the Anglo-Saxon "blac,"
which is still active in its cognates "blanch," "blank," "bleak,"
and the French "blanc." Both black and white have as their
distinguishing properties the absence of color, and employing
the same word for both strikes me as very perceptive of King
Arthur's lexicographer.

122

One, perhaps remote, possibility is connected with the
unavailability of toilet paper in preindustrial societies. For most
of human history, and in many parts of the world today, the
empty hand is used for personal hygiene after defecation, a fact
of life in pretechnological cultures. It does not follow that those
who follow this custom enjoy it. Not only is it aesthetically
unappealing, it involves a serious risk of transferring disease to
others as well as to oneself. The simplest precaution is to greet
and to eat with the other hand. Without apparent exception in
pretechnological human societies, it is the left hand that is used
for such toilet functions and the right for greeting and eating.
Occasional lapses from this convention are quite properly
viewed with horror. Severe penalties have been visited on small
children for breaches of the prevailing handed-ness
conventions; and many older people in the West can still
remember a time when there were firm strictures against even
reaching for objects with the left hand. I believe this account
can explain the virulence against associations with "left" and
the defensive self-congratulatory bombast attached to
associations with "right" which are commonplace in our
right-handed society. The explanation does not, however,
explain why the right and left hands were originally chosen for
these particular functions. It might be argued that statistically
there is one chance in two that toilet functions would be
relegated to the left hand. But we would then expect one
society in two to be righteous about leftness. In fact, there
seem to be no such societies. In a society where most people
are right-handed, precision tasks such as eating and fighting
would be relegated to the favored hand, leaving by default toilet
functions to the side sinister. However, this also does not
account for why the society is right-handed. In its most
fundamental sense, the explanation must lie elsewhere.
There is no direct connection between the hand you prefer to
use for most tasks and the cerebral hemisphere that controls
speech, and the majority of left-handers may still have speech
centers in the left hemisphere, although this point is in dispute.
Nevertheless, the existence of handedness itself is thought to
be connected with brain lateralization. Some evidence suggests
the left-handers are more likely to have problems with such

123

left-hemisphere functions as reading, writing, speaking and
arithmetic; and to be more adept at such right-hemisphere
functions as imagination, pattern recognition and general
creativity.* Some data suggest that human beings are
genetically biased towards right-handedness. For example, the
number of ridges on fingerprints of fetuses during the third and
fourth months of gestation is larger in the right hand than the
left hand, and this preponderance persists throughout fetal life
and after birth.
Information on the handedness of the Australopithecines has
been obtained from an analysis of fossil baboon skulls fractured
with bone or wooden clubs by these early relatives of man. The
discoverer of the Australopithecine fossils, Raymond Dart,
concluded that about 20 percent of them were left-handed,
which is roughly the fraction in modern man. In contrast, while
other animals often show strong paw preferences, the favored
paw is almost as likely to be left as right.
The left/right distinctions run deep into the past of our species.
I wonder if some slight whiff of the battle between the rational
and the intuitive, between the two hemispheres of the brain,
has not surfaced in the polarity between words for right and
left: it is the verbal hemisphere that controls the right side.
There may not in fact be more dexterity in the right side; but it
certainly has-a better press. The left hemisphere seems to feel
quite defensive-in a strange way insecure-about the right
hemisphere; and, if this is so, verbal criticism of intuitive
thinking becomes suspect on the ground of motive.
Unfortunately, there is every reason to think that the right
hemisphere has comparable misgivings -expressed
nonverbally, of course-about the left.
* The only left-handed American presidents have apparently
been Harry Truman and Gerald Ford. I am not sure whether this
is consistent or inconsistent with the proposed (weak)
correlation between handedness and hemisphere function.
Leonardo da Vinci may be the most illuminating example of the
creative genius of left-handers.

124

Admitting the validity of both methods of thinking, left
hemisphere and right hemisphere, we must ask if they are
equally effective and useful in new circumstances. There is no
doubt that right-hemisphere intuitive thinking may perceive
patterns and connections too difficult for the left hemisphere;
but it may also detect patterns where none exist. Skeptical and
critical thinking is not a hallmark of the right hemisphere. And
unalloyed right-hemisphere doctrines, particularly when they
are invented during new and trying circumstances, may be
erroneous or paranoid.
Recent experiments by Stuart Dimond, a psychologist at
University College,
Cardiff in Wales, have employed special contact lenses to show
films to the right or left hemisphere only. Of course, the
information arriving in one hemisphere in a normal subject can
be transmitted via the corpus callosum to the other hemisphere.
Subjects were asked to rate a variety of films in terms of
emotional content. These experiments showed a remarkable
tendency for the right hemisphere to view the world as more
unpleasant, hostile, and even disgusting than the left
hemisphere. The Cardiff psychologists also found that when
both hemispheres are working, our emotional responses are
very similar to those of the left hemisphere only. The
negativism of the right hemisphere is apparently strongly
tempered in everyday life by the more easygoing left
hemisphere. But a dark and suspicious emotion tone seems to
lurk in the right hemisphere, which may explain some of the
antipathy felt by our left hemisphere selves to the "sinister"
quality of the left hand and the right hemisphere.
In paranoid thinking a person believes he has detected a
conspiracy-that is, a hidden (and malevolent) pattern in the
behavior of friends, associates or governments-where in fact
no such pattern exists. If there is such a conspiracy, the subject
may be profoundly anxious, but his thinking is not necessarily
paranoid. A famous case involves James Forrestal, the first U.S.
Secretary of Defense. At the end of World War II, Forrestal was
convinced that Israeli secret agents were following him
everywhere. His physicians, equally convinced of the absurdity
of this idee fixe, diagnosed him as paranoid and confined him to

125

an upper story of Walter Reed Army Hospital, from which he
plunged to his death, partly because of inadequate supervision
by hospital personnel, overly deferential to one of his exalted
rank. Later it was discovered that Forrestal was indeed being
followed by Israeli agents who were worried that he might
reach a secret understanding with representatives of Arab
nations. Forrestal had other problems, but having his valid
perception labeled paranoid did not help his condition.
In times of rapid social change there are bound to be
conspiracies, both by those in favor of change and by those
defending the status quo, the latter more than the former in
recent American political history. Detecting conspiracies when
there are no conspiracies is a symptom of paranoia; detecting
them when they exist is a sign of mental health. An
acquaintance of mine says, "In America today, if you're not a
little paranoid you're out of your mind." The remark, however,
has global applicability.
There is no way to tell whether the patterns extracted by the
right hemisphere are real or imagined without subjecting them
to left-hemisphere scrutiny. On the other hand, mere critical
thinking, without creative and intuitive insights, without the
search for new patterns, is sterile and doomed. To solve
complex problems in changing circumstances requires the
activity of both cerebral hemispheres: the path to the future
lies through the corpus callosum.
An example of different behavior arising from different
cognitive functions-one example of many-is the familiar human
reaction to the sight of blood. Many of us feel queasy or
disgusted or even faint at the sight of copious bleeding in
someone else. The reason, I think, is clear. We have over the
years associated our own bleeding with pain, injury, and a
violation of bodily integrity; and we experience a sympathetic
or vicarious agony in seeing someone else bleed. We recognize
their pain. This is almost certainly the reason that the color red
is used to signify danger or stop * in many diverse human
societies. (If the oxygen-carrying pigment in our blood were
green-which biochemically it could have been-we would, all of

126

us, think green a quite natural index of danger and be amused
at the idea of using red.) A trained physician, on the other hand,
has a different set of perceptions when faced with blood. What
organ is injured? How copious in the bleeding? Is it venous or
arterial flow? Should a tourniquet be applied? These are all
analytic functions of the left hemisphere. They require more
complex and analytic cognitive processes than the simple
association: blood equals pain. And they are far more practical.
If I were injured, I would much rather be with a competent
physician who through long experience has become almost
entirely inured to gore than with an utterly sympathetic friend
who faints dead away at the sight, of blood. The latter may be
highly motivated not to wound another person, but the former
will be able to help if such a wound occurs. In an ideally
structured species, these two quite different attitudes would be
present simultaneously in the same individual. And in most of
us that is just what has happened. The two modes of thinking
are of very different complexity, but they have complementary
survival value.
* Or down, as in elevator direction lights. Our arboreal
ancestors had to be very careful about down.
A typical example of the occasional resistance mustered by
intuitive thinking against the clear conclusions of analytical
thinking is D. H. Lawrence's opinion of the nature of the moon:
"It's no use telling me it's a dead rock in the sky! I know it's
not." Indeed, the moon is more than a dead rock in the sky. It is
beautiful, it has romantic associations, it raises tides, it may
even be the ultimate reason for the timing of the human
menstrual cycle. But certainly one of its attributes is that it is a
dead rock in the sky. Intuitive thinking does quite well in areas
where we have had previous personal or evolutionary
experience. But in new areas-such as the nature of celestial
objects close up-intuitive reasoning must be diffident in its
claims and willing to accommodate to the insights that rational
thinking wrests from Nature. By the same token, the processes
of rational thought are not ends in themselves but must be
perceived in the larger context of human good; the nature and
direction of rational and analytical endeavors should be

127

determined in significant part by their ultimate human
implications, as revealed through intuitive thinking.
In a way, science might be described as paranoid thinking
applied to Nature: we are looking for natural conspiracies, for
connections among apparently disparate data. Our objective is
to abstract patterns from Nature (right-hemisphere thinking),
but many proposed patterns do not in fact correspond to the
data. Thus all proposed patterns must be subjected to the sieve
of critical analysis (left-hemisphere thinking). The search for
patterns without critical analysis, and rigid skepticism without a
search for patterns, are the antipodes of incomplete science.
The effective pursuit of knowledge requires both functions.
Calculus, Newtonian physics and geometrical optics were all
derived by fundamentally geometrical arguments and are today
taught and demonstrated largely by analytical arguments:
creating the mathematics and physics is more of a
right-hemisphere function than teaching it. This is common
today as well. Major scientific insights are characteristically
intuitive, and equally characteristically described in scientific
papers by linear analytical arguments. There is no anomaly in
this: it is, rather, just as it should be. The creative act has
major right-hemisphere components. But arguments on the
validity of the result are largely left-hemisphere functions.
It was an astonishing insight by Albert Einstein, central to the
theory of general relativity, that gravitation could be
understood by setting the contracted Riemann-Christoffel
tensor equal to zero. But this contention was accepted only
because one could work out the detailed mathematical
consequences of the equation, see where it made predictions
different from those of Newtonian gravitation, and then turn to
experiment to see which way Nature votes. In three remarkable
experiments-the deflection of starlight when passing near the
sun; the motion of the orbit of Mercury, the planet nearest to
the sun; and the red shift of spectral lines in a strong stellar
gravitational field- Nature voted for Einstein. But without these
experimental tests, very few physicists would have accepted
general relativity. There are many hypotheses in physics of

128

almost comparable brilliance and elegance that have been
rejected because they did not survive such a confrontation with
experiment. In my view, the human condition would be greatly
improved if such confrontations and willingness to reject
hypotheses were a regular part of our social, political,
economic, religious and cultural lives.
I know of no significant advance in science that did not require
major inputs from both cerebral hemispheres. This is not true
for art, where apparently there are no experiments by which
capable, dedicated and unbiased observers can determine to
their mutual satisfaction which works are great. As one of
hundreds of examples, I might note that the principal French art
critics, journals and museums of the late nineteenth and early
twentieth centuries rejected French Impressionism in toto;
today the same artists are widely held by the same institutions
to have produced masterpieces. Perhaps a century hence the
pendulum will reverse direction again.
This book itself is an exercise in pattern recognition, an
attempt to understand something of the nature and evolution of
human intelligence, using clues from a wide variety of sciences
and myths. It is in significant part a right-hemisphere activity;
and in the course of writing it I was repeatedly awakened in the
middle of the night or in the early hours of the morning by the
mild exhilaration of a new insight. But whether the insights are
genuine-and I expect many of them will require substantial
revision-depends on how well my left hemisphere has
functioned (and also on whether I have retained certain views
because I am unaware of the evidence that contradicts them). In
writing this book I have been repeatedly struck by its existence
as a meta-example: in conception and execution it illustrates
its own content.
In the seventeenth century there were two quite distinct ways
of describing the connection between mathematical quantities:
you could write an algebraic equation or you could draw a
curve. Rene Descartes showed the formal identity of these two
views of the mathematical world when he invented analytical
geometry, through which algebraic equations can be graphed.

129

(Descartes, incidentally, was also an anatomist concerned about
the localization of function in the brain.) Analytical geometry is
now a tenth-grade commonplace, but it was a brilliant
discovery for the seventeenth century. However, an algebraic
equation is an archetypical left-hemisphere construction, while
a regular geometrical curve, the pattern in an array of related
points, is a characteristic right-hemisphere production. In a
certain sense, analytical geometry is the corpus callosum of
mathematics. Today a range of doctrines find themselves either
in conflict or without mutual interaction. In some important
instances, they are left-hemisphere versus right-hemisphere
views. The Cartesian connection of apparently unrelated or
antithetical doctrines is sorely needed once again.
I think the most significant creative activities of our or any
other human culture-legal and ethical systems, art and music,
science and technology-were made possible only through the
collaborative work of the left and right cerebral hemispheres.
These creative acts, even if engaged in rarely or only by a few,
have changed us and the world. We might say that human
culture is the function of the corpus callosum.

8 THE EVOLUTION OF THE BRAIN
It is the business of the future to be dangerous. . . . The major
advances in civilization are processes that all but wreck the
societies in which they occur.
ALFRED NORTH WHITEHEAD
Adventures in Ideas
The voice of the intellect is a soft one, but it does not rest until
it has gained a hearing. Ultimately, after endless rebuffs, it
succeeds. This is one of the few points in which one may be
optimistic about the future of mankind.

The mind of man is capable of anything -because everything is
in it, all the past as well as all the future.
JOSEPH CONRAD
Heart of Darkness
THE HUMAN BRAIN seems to be in a state of uneasy truce,
with occasional skirmishes and rare battles. The existence of
brain components with predispositions to certain behavior is not
an invitation to fatalism or despair: we have substantial control
over the relative importance of each component. Anatomy is
not destiny, but it is not irrelevant either. At least some mental
illness can be understood in terms of a conflict among the
contending neural parties. The mutual repression among the
components goes in many directions. We have discussed limbic
and neocortical repression of the R-complex, but through
society, there may also be R-complex repression of the
neocortex, and repression of one cerebral hemisphere by the
other. In general, human societies are not innovative. They are
hierarchical and ritualistic. Suggestions for change are greeted
with suspicion: they imply an unpleasant future variation in
ritual and hierarchy: an exchange of one set of rituals for
another, or perhaps for a less structured society with fewer
rituals. And yet there are times when societies must change.
"The dogmas of the quiet past are inadequate for the stormy
present" was Abraham Lincoln's description of this truth. Much
of the difficulty in attempting to restructure American and other
societies arises from this resistance by groups with vested
interests in the status quo. Significant change might require
those who are now high in the hierarchy to move downward
many steps. This seems to them undesirable and is resisted.
But some change, in fact some significant change, is apparent in
Western society-certainly not enough, but more than in almost
any other society. Older and more static cultures are much
more resistant to change. In Colin Turnbull's book The Forest
People, there is a poignant description of a crippled Pygmy girl
who was provided by visiting anthropologists with a stunning
technological innovation, the crutch. Despite the fact that it

131

greatly eased the suffering of the little girl, the adults, including
her parents, showed no particular interest in this invention.*
There are many other cases of intolerance to novelty in
traditional societies; and diverse pertinent examples could be
drawn from the lives of such men as Leonardo, Galileo,
Desiderius Erasmus, Charles Darwin, or Sigmund Freud.
* In defense of the Pygmies, perhaps I should note that a friend
of mine who has spent time with them says that for such
activities as the patient stalking and hunting of mammals and
fish they prepare themselves through marijuana intoxication,
which helps to make the long waits, boring to anyone further
evolved than a Komodo dragon, at least moderately tolerable.
Ganja is, he says, their only cultivated crop. It would be wryly
interesting if in human history the cultivation of marijuana led
generally to the invention of agriculture, and thereby to
civilization. (The marijuana-intoxicated Pygmy, poised patiently
for an hour with his fishing spear aloft, is earnestly burlesqued
by the beer-sodden riflemen, protectively camouflaged in red
plaid, who, stumbling through the nearby woods, terrorize
American suburbs each Thanksgiving.)
The traditionalism of societies in a static state is generally
adaptive: the cultural forms have been evolved painfully over
many generations and are known to serve well. Like mutations,
any random change is apt to serve less well. But also like
mutations, changes are necessary if adaptation to new
environmental circumstances is to be achieved. The tension
between these two tendencies marks much of the political
conflict of our age. At a time characterized by a rapidly varying
external physical and social environment-such as our
time-accommodation to and acceptance of change is adaptive;
in societies that inhabit static environments, it is not. The
hunter/gatherer lifestyles have served mankind well for most of
our history, and I think there is unmistakable evidence that we
are in a way designed by evolution for such a culture; when we
abandon the hunter/gatherer life we abandon the childhood of
our species. Hunter/gatherer and high technology cultures are

132

both products of the neocortex. We are now irreversibly set
upon the latter path. But it will take some getting used to.
Britain has produced a range of remarkably gifted
multidisciplinary scientists and scholars who are sometimes
described as polymaths. The group included, in recent times,
Bertrand Russell, A. N. Whitehead, J. B. S. Haldane, J. D.
Bernal, and Jacob Bronowski. Russell commented that the
development of such gifted individuals required a childhood
period in which there was little or no pressure for conformity, a
time in which the child could develop and pursue his or her own
interests no matter how unusual or bizarre. Because of the
strong pressures for social conformity both by the government
and by peer groups in the United States-and even more so in
the Soviet Union, Japan and the People's Republic of China-I
think that such countries are producing proportionately fewer
polymaths. I also think there is evidence that Britain is in a
steep current decline in this respect.
Particularly today, when so many difficult and complex
problems face the human species, the development of broad
and powerful thinking is desperately needed. There should be a
way, consistent with the democratic ideals espoused by all of
these countries, to encourage, in a humane and caring context,
the intellectual development of especially promising
youngsters. Instead we find, in the instructional and
examination systems of most of these countries, an almost
reptilian ritualization of the educational process. I sometimes
wonder whether the appeal of sex and aggression in
contemporary American television and film offerings reflects
the fact that the R-complex is well developed in all of us, while
many neocortical functions are, partly because of the
repressive nature of schools and societies, more rarely
expressed, less familiar and insufficiently treasured.
As a consequence of the enormous social and technological
changes of the last few centuries, the world is not working
well. We do not live in traditional and static societies. But our
governments, in resisting change, act as if we did. Unless we
destroy ourselves utterly, the future belongs to those societies
that,

133

while not ignoring the reptilian and mammalian parts of our
being, enable the characteristically human components of our
nature to flourish; to those societies that encourage diversity
rather than conformity; to those societies willing to invest
resources in a variety of social, political, economic and cultural
experiments, and prepared to sacrifice short-term advantage
for long-term benefit; to those societies that treat new ideas as
delicate, fragile and immensely valuable pathways to the future.
A better understanding of the brain may also one day bear on
such vexing social issues as the definition of death and the
acceptability of abortions. The current ethos in the West seems
to be that it is permissible in a good cause to kill nonhuman
primates and certainly other mammals; but it is impermissible
(for individuals) to kill human beings under similar
circumstances. The logical implication is that it is the
characteristically human qualities of the human brain that make
the difference. In the same way, if substantial parts of the
neocortex are functioning, the comatose patient can certainly
be said to be alive in a human sense, even if there is major
impairment of other physical and neurological functions. On the
other hand, a patient otherwise alive but exhibiting no sign of
neocortical activity (including the neocortical activities in sleep)
might, in a human sense, be described as dead. In many such
cases the neocortex has failed irreversibly but the limbic
system, R-complex, and lower brainstem are still operative,
and such fundamental functions as .respiration and blood
circulation are unimpaired. I think more work is required on
human brain physiology before a well-supported legal definition
of death can be generally accepted, but the road to such a
definition will very likely take us through considerations of the
neocortex as opposed to the other components of the brain.
Similar ideas could help to resolve the great abortion debate
flourishing in America in the late 1970s-a controversy marked
on both sides by extreme vehemence and a denial of any merit
to opposing points of view. At one extreme is the position that
a woman has an innate right of "control of her own body,"
which encompasses, it is said, arranging for the death of a fetus
on a variety of grounds including psychological disinclination

134

and economic inability to raise a child. At the other extreme is
the existence of a "right to life," the assertion that the killing of
even a zygote, a fertilized egg before the first embryonic
division, is murder because the zygote has the "potential" to
become a human being. I realize that in an issue so emotionally
charged any proposed solution is unlikely to receive plaudits
from the partisans of either extreme, and sometimes our hearts
and our heads lead us to different conclusions. However, based
on some of the ideas in previous chapters of this book, I would
like to offer at least an attempt at a reasonable compromise.
There is no question that legalized abortions avoid the tragedy
and butchery of illegal and incompetent "back-alley" abortions,
and that in a civilization whose very continuance is threatened
by the specter of uncontrolled population growth, widely
available medical abortions can serve an important social need.
But infanticide would solve both problems and has been
employed widely by many human communities, including
segments of the classical Greek civilization, which is so
generally considered the cultural antecedent of our own. And it
is widely practiced today: there are many parts of the world
where one out of every four newborn babies does not survive
the first year of life. Yet by our laws and mores, infanticide is
murder beyond any question. Since a baby born prematurely in
the seventh month of pregnancy is in no significant respect
different from a fetus in utero in the seventh month, it must, it
seems to me, follow that abortion, at least in the last trimester,
is very close to murder. Objections that the fetus in the third
trimester is still not breathing seem specious: Is it permissible
to commit infanticide after birth if the umbilicus has not yet
been severed, or if the baby has not yet taken its first breath?
Likewise, if I am psychologically unprepared to live with a
stranger-in army boot camp or college dormitory, for
example-I do not thereby have a right to kill him, and my
annoyance at some of the uses of my tax money does not
extend to exterminating the recipients of those taxes. The civil
liberties point of view is often muddled in such debates. Why, it
is sometimes asked, should the beliefs of others on this issue
have to extend to me? But those who do not personally support
the conventional prohibition against murder arc nevertheless
required by our society to abide by the criminal code.

135

On the opposite side of the discussion, the phrase "right to life"
is an excellent example of a "buzz word," designed to inflame
rather than illuminate. There is no right to life in any society on
Earth today, nor has there been at any former time (with a
few-rare exceptions, such as among the Jains of India). We
raise farm animals for slaughter; destroy forests; pollute rivers
and lakes until no fish can live there; hunt deer and elk for
sport, leopards for their pelts, and whales for dog food; entwine
dolphins, gasping and writhing, in great tuna nets; and club seal
pups to death for "population management." All these beasts
and vegetables are as alive as we. What is protected in many
human societies is not life, but human life. And even with this
protection, we wage "modern" wars on civilian populations with
a toll so terrible we are, most of us, afraid to consider it very
deeply. Often such mass murders are justified by racial or
nationalistic redefinitions of our opponents as less than human.
In the same way, the argument about the "potential" to be
human seems to me particularly weak. Any human egg or sperm
under appropriate circumstances has the potential to become a
human being. Yet male masturbation and nocturnal emissions
are generally considered natural acts and not cause for murder
indictments. In a single ejaculation there are enough
spermatozoa for the generation of hundreds of millions of
human beings. In addition, it is possible that in the
not-too-distant future we may be able to clone a whole human
being from a single cell taken from essentially anywhere in the
donor's body. If so, any cell in my body has the potential to
become a human being if properly preserved until the time of a
practical cloning technology. Am I committing mass murder if I
prick my finger and lose a drop of blood? The issues are clearly
complex. The solution, equally clearly, must involve a
compromise among a number of cherished but conflicting
values. The key practical question is to determine when a fetus
becomes human. This in turn rests on what we mean by human.
Surely not having a human shape, because an artifact of organic
materials that resembled a human being but was constructed
for the purpose would certainly not be considered human.
Likewise, an extraterrestrial intelligent being who did not

136

resemble human beings but who had ethical, intellectual and
artistic accomplishments exceeding our own should certainly
fall within our prohibitions against murder. It is not what we
look like that specifies our humanity, but what we are. The
reason we prohibit the killing of human beings must be because
of some quality human beings possess, a quality we especially
prize, that few or no other organisms on Earth enjoy. It cannot
be the ability to feel pain or deep emotions, because that surely
extends to many of the animals we gratuitously slaughter.
This essential human quality, I believe, can only be our
intelligence. If so, the particular sanctity of human life can be
identified with the development and functioning of the
neocortex. We cannot require its full development, because that
does not occur until many years after birth. But perhaps we
might set the transition to humanity at the time when
neocortical activity begins, as determined by
electroencephalography of the fetus. Some insights on when
the brain develops a distinctly human character emerge from
the simplest embryological observations (see the figure on page
208). Very little work has been done in this field to date, and it
seems to me that such investigations could play a major role in
achieving an acceptable compromise in the abortion debate.
Undoubtedly there would be a variation from fetus to fetus as
to the time of initiation on the first neocortical EEC signals, and
a legal definition of the. beginning of characteristically human
life should be biased conservatively- that is, toward the
youngest fetus that exhibits such activity. Perhaps the
transition would fall toward the .end of the first trimester or
near the beginning of the second trimester of pregnancy. (Here
we are talking about what, in rational society, should be
prohibited by law: anyone who feels that abortion of a younger
fetus might be murder should be under no legal obligation to
perform or accept such an abortion.)
But a consistent application of these ideas must avoid human
chauvinism. If there are other organisms that share the
intelligence of a somewhat backward but fully developed human
being, they at least should be offered the same protection
against murder that we are willing to extend to human beings

137

late in their uterine existence. Since the evidence for
intelligence in dolphins, whales and apes is now at least
moderately compelling, any consistent moral posture on
abortion should, I would think, include firm strictures against at
least the gratuitous slaughter of these animals. But the ultimate
key to the solution of the abortion debate would seem to be the
investigation of prepartum neocortical activity.
And what of the future evolution of the human brain? There is a
wide and growing body of evidence that many forms of mental
illness are the result of chemical or wiring malfunctions in the
brain. Since many mental diseases have the same symptoms,
they may arise from the same malfunctions and should be
accessible to the same cures.
The pioneering nineteenth-century British neurologist
Hughlings Jackson remarked, "Find out about dreams and you
will find out about insanity." Severely dream deprived subjects
often begin hallucinating in daytime. Schizophrenia is often
accompanied by nighttime sleep impairment, but whether as a
cause or an effect is uncertain. One of the most striking aspects
of schizophrenia is how unhappy and despairing its sufferers
generally are. Might schizophrenia be what happens when the
dragons are no longer safely chained at night; when they break
the left-hemisphere shackles and burst forth in daylight? Other
diseases perhaps result from an impairment of
right-hemisphere function: Obsessive-compulsives, for
example, are very rarely found to make intuitive leaps.
In the middle 1960s Lester Grinspoon and his colleagues at
Harvard Medical School performed a set of controlled
experiments on the relative value of various therapeutic
techniques for treating schizophrenia. They are psychiatrists,
and if they had any bias it was toward the use of verbal rather
than pharmacological techniques. But they found to their
surprise that the recently developed tranquilizer, thioridazine
(one of a group of approximately equally effective antipsychotic
drugs known as phenothiazines), was far more effective in
controlling if not curing the disease; in fact, they found that

138

thioridazine alone was at least as effective-in the judgment of
the patients, their relatives, and the psychiatrists-as
thioridazine plus psychotherapy. The integrity of the
experimenters in the face of this unexpected finding is
breathtaking. (It is difficult to imagine any experiment that
would convince leading practitioners of many political or
religious philosophies of the superiority of a competing
doctrine.)
Recent research shows that endorphins, small protein
molecules which occur naturally in the brains of rats and other
mammals, can induce in these animals marked muscular rigidity
and stupor reminiscent of schizophrenic catatonia. The
molecular or neurological cause of schizophrenia-which was
once responsible for one out of ten hospital-bed occupancies in
the United States-is still unknown; but it is not implausible that
someday we will discover precisely what locale or set of
neurochemicals in the brain determines this malfunction.
A curious question in medical ethics emerges from the
experiments of Grinspoon et al. The tranquilizers are now so
effective in treating schizophrenia that it is widely considered
unethical to withhold them from a patient. The implication is
that the experiments showing tranquilizers to be effective
cannot be repeated. It is thought to be an unnecessary cruelty
to deny the patient the most successful treatment for his
condition. Consequently, there can no longer be a control group
of schizophrenics that is not given tranquilizers. If critical
experiments in the chemotherapy of brain malfunction can be
performed only once, they must be performed the first time
very well indeed.
An even more striking example of such chemotherapy is the
use of lithium carbonate in the treatment of manic depressives.
The ingestion of carefully controlled doses of lithium, the
lightest and simplest metal, produces startling
improvements-again as reported from the patients' perspective
and from the perspective of others-in this agonizing disease.
Why so simple a therapy is so strikingly effective is unknown,
but it most likely relates to the enzyme chemistry of the brain.

139

A very strange mental illness is Gilles de la Tourette's disease
(named, as always, after the physician who first drew attention
to it, not after the most celebrated sufferer of the malady). One
of the many motor and speech disorders that are among the
symptoms of this disease is a remarkable compulsion to
utter-in whatever language the patient is most fluent-an
uninterrupted stream of obscenities and profanities. Physicians
describe the identification of this disease as "corridor
diagnosis": The patient can, with great difficulty, control his
compulsion for the length of a short medical visit; as soon as
the physician leaves the room for the corridor, the scatologies
overflow like the flood from a burst dam. There is a place in
the brain that makes "dirty" words (and apes may have it).
There are very few words that the right hemisphere can deal
with competently-not much more than hello, goodbye, and ... a
few choice obscenities. Perhaps Tourette's disease affects the
left hemisphere only. The British anthropologist Bernard
Campbell of Cambridge University suggests that the limbic
system is rather well integrated with the right cerebral
hemisphere, which, as we have seen, deals much better with
emotions than the left hemisphere does. Whatever else they
involve, obscenities carry with them strong emotions. Yet Gilles
de la Tourette's disease, complex as it is, seems to be a
specific deficiency in a neuronal transmitter chemical, and
appears to be alleviated by carefully controlled doses of
haloperidol.
Recent evidence indicates that such limbic hormones as ACTH
and vasopressin can greatly improve the ability of animals to
retain and recall memories. These and similar examples
suggest, if not the ultimate pcrfectability of the brain, at least
prospects for its substantial improvement-perhaps through
altering the abundance or controlling the production of small
brain proteins. Such examples also greatly relieve the burden
of guilt commonly experienced by sufferers from a mental
disease, a burden rarely felt in victims of, say measles.

140

The remarkable fissurization, convolutions and cortical folding
of the brain, as well as the fact that the brain fits so snugly into
the skull, are clear indications that packing more brain into the
present braincase is going to be difficult. Larger brains with
larger skulls could not develop until very recently because of
limits on the size of the pelvis and the birth canal. But the
advent of Caesarean section-performed rarely two thousand
years ago but much more commonly today-does permit larger
brain volumes. Another possibility is a medical technology
sufficiently advanced to permit full-term development of the
fetus outside of the uterus. However, the rate of evolutionary
change is so slow that none of the problems facing us today is
likely to be overcome by significantly larger neo-cortices and
consequent superior intelligences. Before such a time, but not
in the immediate future, it may be possible, by brain surgery, to
improve those components of the brain we consider worth
improving and to inhibit further those components that may be
responsible for some of the perils and contradictions facing
mankind. But the complexity, and redundancy of brain function
make such a course of action impractical for the near future,
even if it were socially desirable. We may be able to engineer
genes before we are able to engineer brains.
It is sometimes suggested that such experiments may provide
unscrupulous governments-and there are many of them-with
tools to control their citizenry still further. For example, we can
imagine a government that implants hundreds of tiny electrodes
in the "pleasure" and "pain" centers of the brains of newborn
children, electrodes capable of remote radio
stimulation-perhaps at frequencies or with access codes known
only to the government. When the child grows up, the
government might stimulate his pleasure centers if he has
performed, in work quota and ideology, an acceptable day's
work; otherwise it might stimulate his pain centers. This is a
nightmarish vision, but I do not think it is an argument against
experiments on electrical stimulation of the brain. It is, rather,
an argument against letting the government control the
hospitals. Any people that will permit its government to implant
such electrodes has already lost the battle and may well
deserve what it gets. As in all such technological nightmares,

141

the principal task is to foresee what is possible; to educate use
and misuse; and to prevent its organizational, bureaucratic and
governmental abuse.
There is already a range of psychotropic and mood-altering
drugs which are, to varying degrees, dangerous or benign
(ethyl alcohol is the most widely used and one of the most
dangerous), and which appear to act on specific areas of the
R-complex, limbic system and neocortex. If present trends
continue, even without the encouragement of governments
people will pursue the home-laboratory synthesis of and
self-experimentation with such drugs-an activity that
represents a small further step in our knowledge of the brain,
its disorders and untapped potentials.
There is reason to think that many alkaloids and other drugs
which affect behavior work by being chemically similar to
natural small brain proteins, of which the endorphins are one
example. Many of these small proteins act on the limbic system
and are concerned with our emotional states. It is now possible
to manufacture small proteins made of any specified sequence
of amino acids. Thus, the time may soon come when a great
variety of molecules will be synthesized capable of inducing
human emotional states, including extremely rare ones. For
example, there is some evidence that atropine-one of the chief
active ingredients in hemlock, foxglove, deadly nightshade, and
jimson weed-induces the illusion of flying; and indeed such
plants seem to have been the principal constituents of unguents
self-administered to the genital mucosa by witches in the
Middle Ages-who, rather than actually flying as they boasted,
were in fact atropine-tripping. But a vivid hallucination of flying
is an extremely specific sensation to be conveyed by a
relatively simple molecule. Perhaps there are a range of small
proteins which will be synthesized and which will produce
emotional states of a sort never before experienced by human
beings. This is one of many potential near-term developments
in brain chemistry which hold great promise both for good and
for evil, depending on the wisdom of those who conduct,
control and apply this research.

142

When I leave my office and get into my car, I find that, unless I
make a specific effort of will, I will drive myself home. When I
leave home and get into my car, unless I make a similar
conscious effort, there is a part of my brain that arranges
events so that I end up at my office. If I change my home or my
office, after a short period of learning, the new locales supplant
the old ones, and whatever brain mechanism controls such
behavior has readily adapted to the new coordinates. This is
very much like self-programming a part of the brain that works
like a digital computer. The comparison is even more striking
when we realize that epileptics, suffering from a psychomotor
seizure, often go through an exactly comparable set of
activities, the only difference being perhaps that they run a few
more red lights than I usually do, but have no conscious
memory of having performed these actions once the seizure has
subsided. Such automatism is a typical symptom of
temporal-lobe epilepsy; it also characterizes my first half-hour
after awakening. Certainly not all of the brain works like a
simple digital computer; the part that does the reprogramming,
for example, is rather different. But there are enough
similarities to suggest that a compatible working arrangement
between electronic computers and at least some components of
the brain-in an intimate neurophysiological association-can be
constructively organized.
The Spanish neurophysiologist Jose Delgado has devised
working feedback loops between electrodes implanted in the
brains of chimpanzees and remote electronic computers.
Communication between brain and computer is accomplished
through a radio link.
Miniaturization of electronic computers has now reached the
stage where such feedback loops can be "hardwired" and do not
require a radio link with a remote computer terminal. For
example, it is entirely possible to devise a self-contained
feedback loop in which the signs of an on-coming epileptic
seizure are recognized and appropriate brain centers are
automatically stimulated to forestall or ameliorate the attack.
We are not yet at the stage where this is a reliable procedure,
but the time when it will be does not seem very far off.

143

Perhaps some day it will be possible to add a variety of
cognitive and intellectual prosthetic devices to the brain-a kind
of eyeglasses for the mind. This would be in the spirit of the
past accretionary evolution of the brain and is probably far
more feasible than attempting to restructure the existing brain.
Perhaps one day we will have surgically implanted in our brains
small replaceable computer modules or radio terminals which
will provide us with a rapid and fluent knowledge of Basque,
Urdu, Amharic, Ainu, Albanian, Nu, Hopi, !Kung, or delphinese;
or numerical values of the incomplete gamma function and the
Tschebysheff polynomials; or the natural history of animal
spoor; or all legal precedents for the ownership of floating
islands; or radio telepathy connecting several human beings, at
least temporarily, in a form of symbiotic association previously
unknown to our species.
But the real extensions of our brains, particularly for the
uniquely human aspects of the neocortex, are already in the
course of being accomplished. Some of them are so old we
have forgotten that they have occurred. Rich and unrepressive
learning environments for children represent a remarkably
promising and successful educational tool. Written language is a
notable invention that is essentially a simple machine for the
storage and retrieval of quite complex information. The amount
of information stored in a large library far exceeds the amount
of information in either the human genome or the human brain.
The information is certainly not stored as efficiently as it is in
biological systems, but it is still serviceably compact, and the
development of microfilm, microfiche and the like has greatly
improved the extrasomatic information storage capabilities of
mankind. The number of bits of information contained in human
libraries, works of art, and other cultural institutions would
provide a point in the chart on page 26 many factors of 10
beyond the right-hand edge of that figure.
Writing is, however, very simple machinery. Much more
sophisticated and far more promising extrasomatic information
storage and processing lies in the electronic computer. To give
some idea of the level of development of such computers and

144

their programs, they can today play perfect tic-tac-toe,
world-class checkers, expert chess and practice passable
psychotherapy. A computer system now exists which will
transcribe a live performance of a classical or other melody
into conventional musical notation. The amount of information
storage and the speed of information processing by computers
are, of course, prodigious.
A non-directive psychotherapy program developed by Joseph
Weizenbaum of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology is a
good example of the present serviceability of psychiatric
computer programs (which are, incidentally, far from the most
difficult or most elaborate programs in existence). After the
psychotherapy program was developed, a human psychiatrist
was brought in to relate in lower-case type (via a typewriter
keyboard on an interactive console) with the program, which
prints out in upper case. The exchange was probably intended
as heuristic but may just possibly have gotten out of hand-on
the human side. The conversation begins with the human
psychiatrist saying,
doctor, i have terrible news
YOU SAY YOU HAVE TERRIBLE NEWS
yes, there is a computer program at m.i.t. that'll ruin us
WHY DO YOU SAY THAT
i have seen it working
YOU SAY YOU HAVE SEEN IT WORKING

no computer could converse as you can, for example

The computer psychiatrist lacks sophistication, training,
sensitivity, human intuition; it is mechanical (of course!),
inflexible and relatively unresponsive to emotional nuances and
nonverbal cues. And yet it has produced a conversation more
intelligent than many. Its response on "a new topic" is stunning.
But that response is very likely only a fluke. The program is
undoubtedly designed to pay attention to words such as
"mother," "father," "parent," and so on; after the computer's
clock has ticked away so many minutes, if these words have
not been introduced, the program is designed to come up with
"You seem to have avoided . . ." Emerging at just the moment it
did, the remark gives an eerie impression of insight.
But what is the game of psychotherapy if not a very complex,
learned set of responses to human situations? Is not the
psychiatrist also preprogrammed to give certain responses?
Non-directive psychotherapy clearly requires very simple
computer programs, and the appearance of insight requires only
slightly more sophisticated programs. I do not intend these
remarks to disparage the psychiatric profession in any way, but
rather to augur the coming of machine intelligence. Computers
are by no means yet at a high enough level of development to
recommend the widespread use of computer psychotherapy.
But it does not seem to me a forlorn hope that we may one day
have extremely patient, widely available and, as least for
certain problems, adequately competent computer therapists.
Some programs already in existence are given high marks by
patients because the therapist is perceived as unbiased and
extremely generous with his or her or its time.
Computers are now being developed in the United States that
will be able to detect and diagnose their own malfunctions.
When systematic performance errors are found, the faulty
components will be automatically bypassed or replaced. Internal
consistency will be tested by repeated operation and through
standard programs whose consequences are known
independently; repair will be accomplished chiefly by redundant
components. There are already in existence programs-e.g., in
chess-playing computers-capable of learning from experience
and from other computers. As time goes on, the computer

147

appears to become increasingly intelligent. Once the programs
are so complex that their inventors cannot quickly predict all
possible responses, the machines will have the appearance of,
if not intelligence, at least free will. Even the computer on the
Viking Mars lander, which has a memory of only 18,000 words,
is at this point of complexity: we do not in all cases know what
the computer will do with a given command. If we knew, we
would say it is "only" or "merely" a computer. When we do not
know, we begin to wonder if it is truly intelligent.
The situation is very much like the commentary that has
echoed over the centuries after a famous animal story told both
by Plutarch and by Pliny: A dog, following the scent of its
master, was observed to come to a triple fork in the road. It ran
down the leftmost prong, sniffing; then stopped and returned to
follow the middle prong for a short distance, again sniffing and
then turning back. Finally, with no sniffing at all, it raced
joyously down the right-hand prong of the forked road.
Montaigne, commenting on this story, argued that it showed
clear canine syllogistic reasoning: My master has gone down
one of these roads. It is not the left-hand road; it is not the
middle road; therefore it must be the right-hand road. There is
no need for me to corroborate this conclusion by smell-the
conclusion follows by straightforward logic.
The possibility that reasoning at all like this might exist in the
animals, although perhaps less clearly articulated, was troubling
to many, and long before Montaigne, St. Thomas Aquinas
attempted unsuccessfully to deal with the story. He cited it as a
cautionary example of how the appearance of intelligence can
exist where no intelligence is in fact present. Aquinas did not,
however, offer a satisfactory alternative explanation of the
dog's behavior. In human split-brain patients, it is quite clear
that fairly elaborate logical analysis can proceed surrounded by
verbal incompetence.
We are at a similar point in the consideration of machine
intelligence. Machines are just passing over an important
threshold: the threshold at which, to some extent at least, they
give an unbiased human being the impression of intelligence.

148

Because of a kind of human chauvinism or anthropocentrism,
many humans are reluctant to admit this possibility. But I think
it is inevitable. To me it is not in the least demeaning that
consciousness and intelligence are the result of "mere" matter
sufficiently complexly arranged; on the contrary, it is an
exalting tribute to the subtlety of matter and the laws of
Nature.
It by no means follows that computers will in the immediate
future exhibit human creativity, subtlety, sensitivity or wisdom.
A classic and probably apocryphal illustration is in the field of
machine translation of human languages: a language-say,
English-is input and the text is output in another language-say,
Chinese. After the completion of an advanced translation
program, so the story goes, a delegation which included a U.S.
senator was proudly taken through a demonstration of the
computer system. The senator was asked to produce an English
phrase for translation and promptly suggested, "Out of sight,
out of mind." The machine dutifully whirred and winked and
generated a piece of paper on which were printed a few
Chinese characters. But the senator could not read Chinese. So,
to complete the test, the program was run in reverse, the
Chinese characters input and an English phrase output. The
visitors crowded around the new piece of paper, which to their
initial puzzlement read: "Invisible idiot."
Existing programs are only marginally competent even on
matters of this not very high degree of subtlety. It would be
folly to entrust major decisions to computers at our present
level of development-not because the computers are not
intelligent to a degree, but because, in the case of most
complex problems, they will not have been given all relevant
information. The reliance on computers in determining
American policy and military actions during the Vietnam war is
an excellent example of the flagrant misuse of these machines.
But in reasonably restricted contexts the human use of artificial
intelligence seems to be one of the two practicable major
advances in human intelligence available in the near future.
(The other is enrichment of the preschool and school learning
environments of children.)

149

Those who have not grown up with computers generally find
them more frightening than those who have. The legendary
manic computer biller who will not take no-or even yes-for an
answer, and who can be satisfied only by receiving a check for
zero dollars and zero cents is not to be considered
representative of the entire tribe; it is a feeble-minded
computer to begin with, and its mistakes are those of its human
programmers. The growing use in North America of integrated
circuits and small computers for aircraft safety, teaching
machines, cardiac pacemakers, electronic games,
smoke-actuated fire alarms and automated factories, to name
only a few uses, has helped greatly to reduce the sense of
strangeness with which so novel an invention is usually
invested. There are some 200,000 digital computers in the
world today; in another decade, there are likely to be tens of
millions. In another generation, I think that computers will be
treated as a perfectly natural-or at least commonplace-aspect
of our lives.
Consider, for example, the development of small, pocket
computers. I have in my laboratory a desk-sized computer
purchased with a research grant in the late 1960s for $4,900. I
also have another product of the same manufacturer, a
computer that fits into the palm of my hand, which was
purchased in 1975. The new computer does everything that the
old computer did, including programming capability and several
addressable memories. But it cost $145, and is getting cheaper
at a breathtaking rate. That represents quite a spectacular
advance, both in miniaturization and in cost reduction, in a
period of six or seven years. In fact, the present limit on the
size of hand-held computers is the requirement that the buttons
be large enough for our somewhat gross and clumsy human
fingers to press. Otherwise, such computers could easily be
built no larger than my fingernail. Indeed, ENIAC, the first large
electronic digital computer, constructed in 1946, contained
18,000 vacuum tubes and occupied a large room. The same
computational ability resides today in a silicon chip
microcomputer the size of the smallest joint of my little finger.

150

The speed of transmission of information in the circuitry of
such computers is the velocity of light. Human neural
transmission is one million times slower. That in nonarithmetic
operations the small and slow human brain can still do so much
better than the large and fast electronic computer is an
impressive tribute to how cleverly the brain is packaged and
programmed -features brought about, of course, by natural
selection. Those who possessed poorly programmed brains
eventually did not live long enough to reproduce.
Computer graphics have now reached a state of sophistication
that permits important and novel kinds of learning experiences
in arts and sciences, and in both cerebral hemispheres. There
are individuals, many of them analytically extremely gifted, who
are impoverished in their abilities to perceive and imagine
spatial relations, particularly three-dimensional geometry. We
now have computer programs that can gradually build up
complex geometrical forms before our eyes and rotate them on
a television screen connected to the computer.
At Cornell University, such a system has been designed by
Donald Greenberg of the School of Architecture. With this
system it is possible to draw a set of regularly spaced lines
which the computer interprets as contour intervals. Then, by
touching our light pen to any of a number of possible
instructions on the screen, we command the construction of
elaborate three-dimensional images which can be made larger
or smaller, stretched in a given direction, rotated, joined to
other objects or have designated parts excised. (See figures on
pp. 226-227.) This is an extraordinary tool for improving our
ability to visualize three-dimensional forms-a skill extremely
useful in graphic arts, in science and in technology. It also
represents an excellent example of cooperation between the
two cerebral hemispheres: the computer, which is a supreme
construction of the left hemisphere, teaches us pattern
recognition, which is a characteristic function of the right
hemisphere.
There are other computer programs that exhibit two-and
three-dimensional projections of four-dimensional objects. As

151

the four-dimensional objects turn, or our perspective changes,
not only do we see new parts of the four-dimensional objects;
we also seem to see the synthesis and destruction of entire
geometrical subunits. The effect is eerie and instructive and
helps to make four-dimensional geometry much less
mysterious; we are not nearly so baffled as I imagine a mythical
two-dimensional creature would be on encountering the typical
projection (two squares with the corners connected) of a
three-dimensional cube on a flat surface. The classical artistic
problem of perspective-the projection of three-dimensional
objects onto two-dimensional canvases-is enormously clarified
by computer graphics; the computer is obviously also a major
tool in the quite practical problem of picturing an architect's
design of a building, made in two dimensions, from all vantage
points in three dimensions.
Computer graphics are now being extended into the area of
play. There is a popular game, sometimes called Pong, which
simulates on a television screen a perfectly elastic ball
bouncing between two surfaces. Each player is given a dial that
permits him to intercept the ball with a movable "racket." Points
are scored if the motion of the ball is not intercepted by the
racket. The game is very interesting. There is a clear learning
experience involved which depends exclusively on Newton's
second law for linear motion. As a result of Pong, the player
can gain a deep intuitive understanding of the simplest
Newtonian physics-a better understanding even than that
provided by billiards, where the collisions are far from
perfectly elastic and where the spinning of the pool balls
interposes more complicated physics.
This sort of information gathering is precisely what we call
play. And the important function of play is thus revealed: it
permits us to gain, without any particular future application in
mind, a holistic understanding of the world, which is both a
complement of and a preparation for later analytical activities.
But computers permit play in environments otherwise totally
inaccessible to the average student.

152

A still more interesting example is provided by the game Space
War, whose development and delights have been chronicled by
Stuart Brand. In Space War, each side controls one or more
"space vehicles" which can fire missiles at the other. The
motions of both the spacecraft and the missiles are governed
by certain rules-for example, an inverse square gravitational
field set up by a nearby "planet." To destroy the spaceship of
your opponent you must develop an understanding of
Newtonian gravitation that is simultaneously intuitive and
concrete. Those of us who do not frequently engage in
interplanetary space flight do not readily evolve a
right-hemisphere comprehension of Newtonian gravitation.
Space War can fill that gap.
The two games, Pong and Space War, suggest a gradual
elaboration of computer graphics so that we gain an
experiential and intuitive understanding of the laws of physics.
The laws of physics are almost always stated in analytical and
algebraic-that is to say, left-hemisphere-terms; for example,
Newton's second law is written F = m a, and the inverse square
law of gravitation as F = G M m/r2. These analytical
representations are extremely useful, and it is certainly
interesting that the universe is made in such a way that the
motion of objects can be described by such relatively simple
laws. But these laws are nothing more than abstractions from
experience. Fundamentally they are mnemonic devices. They
permit us to remember in a simple way a great range of cases
that would individually be much more difficult to remember-at
least in the sense of memory as understood by the left
hemisphere. Computer graphics gives the prospective physical
or biological scientist a wide range of experience with the
cases his laws of nature summarize; but its most important
function may be to permit those who are not scientists to grasp
in an intuitive but nevertheless deep manner what the laws of
nature are about.
There are many non-graphical interactive computer programs
which are extremely powerful teaching tools. The programs can
be devised by first-rate teachers, and the student has, in a
curious sense, a much more personal, one-to-one relationship

153

with the teacher than in the usual classroom setting; he may
also be as slow as he wishes without fear of embarrassment.
Dartmouth College employs computer learning techniques in a
very broad array of courses. For example, a student can gain a
deep insight into the statistics of Mendelian genetics in an hour
with the computer rather than spend a year crossing fruit flies
in the laboratory. Another student can examine the statistical
likelihood of becoming pregnant were she to use various birth
control methods. (This program has built into it a
one-in-ten-billion chance of a woman's becoming pregnant
when strictly celibate, to allow for contingencies beyond
present medical knowledge.)
The computer terminal is a commonplace on the Dartmouth
campus. A very high proportion of Dartmouth undergraduates
learn not only to use such programs but also to write their own.
Interaction with computers is widely viewed as more like fun
than like work, and many colleges and universities are in the
process of imitating and extending Dartmouth's practice.
Dartmouth's preeminence in this innovation is related to the
fact that its president, John G. Kemeny, is a distinguished
computer scientist and the inventor of a very simple computer
language called BASIC.
The Lawrence Hall of Science is a kind of museum connected
with the University of California at Berkeley. In its basement is
a rather modest room filled with about a dozen inexpensive
computer terminals, each hooked up to a time-sharing
mini-computer system located elsewhere in the building.
Reservations for access to these terminals are sold for a
modest fee, and they may be made up to one hour in advance.
The clientele is predominantly youngsters, and the youngest
are surely less than ten years old. A very simple interactive
program available there is the game Hangman. To play
Hangman you type on a fairly ordinary typewriter keyboard the
computer code "XEQ-$HANG." The computer then types out:
HANGMAN
CARE FOR THE RULES?

154

If you type "YES", the machine replies:
GUESS A LETTER IN THE WORD I'M THINKING OF.
IF YOU ARE RIGHT, THEN I WILL TELL YOU. BUT IF YOU
ARE WRONG (HA, HA) YOU WILL BE CLOSER (SNICKER,
SNICKER) TO DEATH BY HANGING! THE WORD HAS EIGHT
LETTERS. YOUR GUESS IS . . . ?
Let us say you type the response: "E". The computer then
types:
-------E
If you guess wrong, the computer then types out an engaging
simulacrum (within the limitations of the characters available to
it) of a human head. And in the usual manner of the game there
is a race between the gradually emerging word and the
gradually emerging form of a human being about to be hanged.
In two games of Hangman I recently witnessed, the correct
answers were "VARIABLE" and "THOUGHT". If you win the
game the program-true to its mustache-twirling villainy-types
out a string of non-letter characters from the top row of the
typewriter keyboard (used in comic books to indicate curses)
and then prints:
RATS, YOU WIN
CARE FOR ANOTHER CHANCE TO DIE?
Other programs are more polite. For example, "XEQ-$KING"
yields:
THIS IS THE ANCIENT KINGDOM OF SUMERIA, AND YOU
ARE ITS VENERATED RULER. THE FATE OF SUMERIA's
ECONOMY AND OF YOUR LOYAL SUBJECTS IS ENTIRELY IN
YOUR HANDS. YOUR MINISTER, HAMMURABI, WILL REPORT
TO YOU EACH YEAR ON POPULATION AND ECONOMY.
USING HIS INFORMATION YOU MUST LEARN TO ALLOCATE
RESOURCES FOR YOUR KINGDOM WISELY. SOMEONE IS
ENTERING YOUR COUNCIL CHAMBER . . .

155

Hammurabi then presents you with relevant statistics on the
number of acres owned by the city, how many bushels per acre
were harvested last year, how many were destroyed by rats,
how many are now in storage, what the present population is,
how many people died of starvation last year, and how many
migrated to the
city. He begs to inform you of the current exchange rate of land
for food and queries how many acres you wish to buy. If you
ask for too much, the program prints:
HAMMURABI: PLEASE THINK AGAIN. YOU HAVE ONLY
TWENTY-EIGHT HUNDRED BUSHELS IN STORE.
Hammurabi turns out to be an extremely patient and polite
Grand Vizier. As the years flicker by, you gain a powerful
impression that it may be very difficult, at least in certain
market economies, to increase both the population and
landholdings of a state while avoiding poverty and starvation.
Among the many other programs available is one called Grand
Prix Racing which permits you to choose from among a range
of opponents, running from a Model T Ford to a 1973 Ferrari. If
your speed or acceleration are too low at appropriate places on
the track, you lose; if too high, you crash. Since distances,
velocities and accelerations must be given explicitly, there is
no way to play this game without learning some physics. The
array of possible courses of computer interactive learning is
limited only by the ingenuity of the programmers, and that is a
well that runs very deep.
Since our society is so profoundly influenced by science and
technology, which the bulk of our citizens understand poorly or
not at all, the widespread availability in both schools and homes
of inexpensive interactive computer facilities could just
possibly play an important role in the continuance of our
civilization.
The only objection I have ever heard to the widespread use of
pocket calculators and small computers is that, if introduced to

156

children too early, they preempt the learning of arithmetic,
trigonometry and other mathematical tasks that the machine is
able to perform faster and more accurately than the student.
This debate has occurred before.
In Plato's Phaedrus-the same Socratic dialogue I referred to
earlier for its metaphor of chariot, charioteer and two
horses-there is a lovely myth about the god Thoth, the
Egyptian equivalent of Prometheus. In the tongue of ancient
Egypt, the phrase that designates written language means
literally "The Speech of the Gods." Thoth is discussing his
invention * of writing with Thamus (also called Ammon), a
god-king who rebukes him in these words:
This discovery of yours will create forgetfulness in the
learners' souls, because they will not use their memories; they
will trust to the external written characters and not remember
of themselves. The specific which you have discovered is an
aid not to memory, but to reminiscence, and you give your
disciples not truth, but only the semblance of truth; they will be
hearers of many things and will have learned nothing; they will
appear to be omniscient and will generally know nothing; they
will be tiresome company, having the show of wisdom without
its reality.
* According to the Roman historian Tacitus, the Egyptians
claimed to have taught the alphabet to the Phoenicians, "who,
controlling the seas, introduced it to Greece and were credited
with inventing what they had really borrowed." According to
legend, the alphabet arrived in Greece with Cadmus, Prince of
Tyre, seeking his sister, Europa, who had been stolen away to
the island of Crete by Zeus, king of the gods, temporarily
disguised as a bull. To protect Europa from those who would
steal her back to Phoenicia, Zeus ordered a bronze robot made
which, with clanking steps, patrolled Crete and turned back or
sank all approaching foreign vessels. Cadmus, however, was
elsewhere-^unsuccessfully seeking his sister in Greece when
a dragon devoured all his men; whereupon he slew the dragon

157

and, in response to instructions from the goddess Athena,
sowed the dragon's teeth in the furrows of a plowed field. Each
tooth became a warrior; and Cadmus and his men together
founded Thebes, the first civilized Greek city, bearing the same
name as one of the two capital cities of ancient Egypt. It is
curious to find in the same legendary account the invention of
writing, the founding of Greek civilization, the first known
reference to artificial intelligence, and the continuing warfare
between humans and dragons.
I am sure there is some truth to Thamus' complaint. In our
modern world, illiterates have a different sense of direction, a
different sense of self-reliance, and a different sense of reality.
But before the invention of writing, human knowledge was
restricted to what one person or a small group could remember.
Occasionally, as with the Vedas and the two great epic poems
of Homer, a substantial body of information could be preserved.
But there were, so far as we know, few Homers. After the
invention of writing, it was possible to collect, integrate and
utilize the accumulated wisdom of all times and peoples;
humans were no longer restricted to what they and their
immediate acquaintances could remember. Literacy gives us
access to the greatest and most influential minds in history:
Socrates, say, or Newton have had audiences vastly larger than
the total number of people either met in his whole lifetime. The
repeated rendering of an oral tradition over many generations
inevitably leads to errors
in transmission and the gradual loss of the original content, a
degradation of information that occurs far more slowly with the
successive reprinting of written accounts.
Books are readily stored. We can read them at our own pace
without disturbing others. We can go back to the hard parts, or
delight once again in the particularly enjoyable parts. They are
mass-produced at relatively low cost. And reading itself is an
amazing activity: You glance at a thin, flat object made from a
tree, as you are doing at this moment, and the voice of the
author begins to speak inside your head. (Hello!) The
improvement in human knowledge and survival potential

158

following the invention of writing was immense. (There was
also an improvement in self-reliance: It is possible to learn at
least the rudiments of an art or a science from a book and not
be dependent on the lucky accident that there is a nearby
master craftsman to whom we may apprentice ourselves.)
When all is said and done, the invention of writing must be
reckoned not only as a brilliant innovation but as a surpassing
good for humanity. And assuming that we survive long enough
to use their inventions wisely, I believe the same will be said of
the modern Thoths and Prometheuses who are today devising
computers and programs at the edge of machine intelligence.
The next major structural development in human intelligence is
likely to be a partnership between intelligent humans and
intelligent machines.

KNOWLEDGE IS OUR DESTINY:
TERRESTRIAL AND EXTRATERRESTRIAL INTELLIGENCE
The silent hours steal on ...
WM. SHAKESPEARE King Richard III
The question of all questions for humanity, the problem which
lies behind all others and is more interesting than any of them
is that of the determination of man's place in Nature and his
relation to the Cosmos. Whence our race came, what sorts of
limits are set to our power over Nature and to Nature's power
over us, to what goal we are striving, are the problems which
present themselves afresh, with undiminished interest, to every
human being born on earth.
T. H. HUXLEY, 1863
AND so at last I return to one of the questions with which I
started: the search for extraterrestrial intelligence. While the
suggestion is sometimes made that the preferred channel of

159

interstellar discourse will be telepathic, this seems to me at
best a playful notion. At any rate, there is not the faintest
evidence in support of it; and I have yet to see even moderately
convincing evidence for telepathic transmission on this planet.
We are not yet capable of significant interstellar space flight,
although some other more advanced civilization might be.
Despite all the talk of unidentified flying objects and ancient
astronauts, there is no serious evidence that we have been or
are being visited.
That, then, leaves machines. Communication with
extraterrestrial intelligence may employ the electromagnetic
spectrum, and most likely the radio part of the spectrum; or it
might employ gravity waves, neutrinos, just conceivably
tachyons (if they exist), or some new aspect of physics that will
not be discovered for another three centuries. But whatever the
channel, it will require machines to use, and if our experience
in radioastronomy is any guide, computer-actuated machines
with abilities approaching what we might call intelligence. To
run through many days' worth of data on 1,008 different
frequencies, where the information may vary every few
seconds or faster, cannot be done well by visually scanning the
records. It requires autocorrelation techniques and large
electronic computers. And this situation, which applies to
observations that Frank Drake of Cornell and I have recently
performed at the Arecibo Observatory, can only become more
complex-that is, more dependent on computers-with the
listening devices likely to be employed in the near future. We
can design receiving and transmitting programs of immense
complexity. If we are lucky we will employ stratagems of great
cleverness and elegance. But we cannot avoid utilizing the
remarkable capabilities of machine intelligence if we wish to
search for extraterrestrial intelligence.
The number of advanced civilizations in the Milky Way Galaxy
today depends on many factors, ranging from the number of
planets per star to the likelihood of the origin of life. But once
life has started in a relatively benign environment and billions
of years of evolutionary time are available, the expectation of
many of us is that intelligent beings would develop. The

160

evolutionary path would, of course, be different from that taken
on Earth. The precise sequence of events that have taken place
here-including the extinction of the dinosaurs and the
recession of the Pliocene and Pleistocene forests-have
probably not occurred in precisely the same way anywhere else
in the entire universe. But there should be many functionally
equivalent pathways to a similar end result. The entire
evolutionary record on our planet, particularly the record
contained in fossil endocasts, illustrates a progressive tendency
toward intelligence. There is nothing mysterious about this:
smart organisms by and large survive better and leave more
offspring than stupid ones. The details will certainly depend on
circumstances, as, for example, if nonhuman primates with
language have been exterminated by humans, while slightly less
communicative apes were ignored by our ancestors. But the
general trend seems quite clear and should apply to the
evolution of intelligent life elsewhere. Once intelligent beings
achieve technology and the capacity for self-destruction of
their species, the selective advantage of intelligence becomes
more uncertain .
And what if we receive a message? Is there any reason to think
that the transmitting beings-evolved over billions of years of
geological time in an environment vastly different from our
own-would be sufficiently similar to us for their messages to
be understood? I think the answer must be yes. A civilization
transmitting radio messages must at least know about radio.
The frequency, time constant, and bandpass of the message are
common to transmitting and receiving civilizations. The
situation may be a little like that of amateur or ham radio
operators. Except for occasional
emergencies, their conversations seem almost exclusively
concerned with the mechanics of their instruments: it is the one
aspect of their lives they are certain to have in common.
But I think the situation is far more hopeful than this. We know
that the laws of nature-or at least many of them-are the same
everywhere. We can detect by spectroscopy the same chemical
elements, the same common molecules on other planets, stars
and galaxies; and the fact that the spectra are the same shows

161

that the same mechanisms by which atoms and molecules are
induced to absorb and emit radiation exist everywhere. Distant
galaxies can be observed moving ponderously about each other
in precise accord with the same laws of gravitation that
determine the motion of a tiny artificial satellite about our pale
blue planet Earth. Gravity, quantum mechanics, and the great
bulk of physics and chemistry are observed to be the same
elsewhere as here.
Intelligent organisms evolving on another world may not be like
us biochemically. They will almost certainly have evolved
significantly different adaptations-from enzymes to organ
systems-to deal with the different circumstances of their
several worlds. But they must still come to grips with the same
laws of nature.
The laws of falling bodies seem simple to us. At constant
acceleration, as provided by Earth's gravity, the velocity of a
falling object increases proportional to the time; the distance
fallen proportional to the square of the time. These are very
elementary relations. Since Galileo at least, they have been
fairly generally grasped. Yet we can imagine a universe in
which the laws of nature are immensely more complex. But we
do not live in such a universe. Why not? I think it may be
because all those organisms who perceived their universe as
very complex are dead. Those of our arboreal ancestors who
had difficulty computing their trajectories as they brachiated
from tree to tree did not leave many offspring. Natural
selection has served as a kind of intellectual sieve, producing
brains and intelligences increasingly competent to deal with the
laws of nature. This resonance, extracted by natural selection,
between our brains and the universe may help explain a
quandary set by Einstein: The most incomprehensible property
of the universe, he said, is that it is so comprehensible.
If this is so, the same evolutionary winnowing must have
occurred on other worlds that have evolved intelligent beings.
Extraterrestrial intelligences that lack avian or arboreal
ancestors may not share our passion for space flight. But all
planetary atmospheres are relatively transparent in the visible

162

and radio parts of the spectrum-because of the quantum
mechanics of the cosmically most abundant atoms and
molecules. Organisms throughout the universe should therefore
be sensitive to optical and/or radio radiation, and, after the
development of physics, the idea of electromagnetic radiation
for interstellar communication should be a cosmic
commonplace-a convergent idea evolving independently on
countless worlds throughout the galaxy after the local
discovery of elementary astronomy, what we might call the
facts of life. If we are fortunate enough to make contact with
some of those other beings, I think we will find that much of
their biology, psychology, sociology and politics will seem to us
stunningly exotic and deeply mysterious. But I suspect we will
have little difficulty in understanding each other on the simpler
aspects of astronomy, physics, chemistry and perhaps
mathematics.
I would certainly not expect their brains to be anatomically or
physiologically or perhaps even chemically close to ours. Their
brains will have had different evolutionary histories in different
environments. We have only to look at terrestrial beasts with
substantially different organ systems to see how much variation
in brain physiology is possible. There is, for example, an
African fresh-water fish, the Mormyrid, which often lives in
murky water where visual detection of predators, prey or mates
is difficult. The Mormyrid has developed a special organ which
establishes an electric field and monitors that field for any
creatures traversing it. This fish possesses a cerebellum that
covers the entire back of its brain in a thick layer reminiscent
of the neocortex of mammals. The Mormyrids have a
spectacularly different sort of brain, and yet in the most
fundamental biological sense they are far more closely related
to us than any intelligent extraterrestrial beings.
The brains of extraterrestrials will probably have several or
many components slowly accreted by evolution, as ours have.
There may still be a tension among their components as among
ours, although the hallmark of a successful, long-lived
civilization may be the ability to achieve a lasting peace among
the several brain components. They almost certainly will have

163

significantly extended their intelligence extrasomatically, by
employing intelligent machines. But I think it highly probable
that our brains and machines and their brains and machines will
ultimately understand one another very well.
The practical benefits as well as the philosophical insights
likely to accrue from the receipt of a long message from an
advanced civilization are immense. But how great the benefits
and how fast we can assimilate them depend on the details of
the message contents, about which it is difficult to make
reliable predictions. One consequence, however, seems clear;
the receipt of a message from an. advanced civilization will
show that there are advanced civilizations, that there are
methods of avoiding the self-destruction that seems so real a
danger of our present technological adolescence. Thus the
receipt of an interstellar message would provide a very
practical benefit that in mathematics is called the existence
theorem-in this case the demonstration that it is possible for
societies to live and prosper with advanced technology. Finding
a solution to a problem is helped enormously by the certain
knowledge that a solution exists. This is one of many curious
connections between the existence, of intelligent life elsewhere
and the existence of intelligent life on Earth.
While more rather than less knowledge and intelligence seems
so clearly the only way out of our present difficulties and the
only aperture to a significant future for mankind (or indeed to
any future at all), this is not a view always adopted in practice.
Governments often lose sight of the difference between
short-term and long-term benefits. The most important
practical benefits have come about from the most unlikely and
apparently impractical scientific advances. Radio is today not
only the prime channel in the search for extraterrestrial
intelligence, it is the means by which emergencies are
responded to, news is transmitted, telephone calls relayed and
global entertainment aired. Yet radio came about because a
Scottish physicist, James Clerk Maxwell, invented a term, which
he called the displacement current, in a set of partial
differential equations now known as Maxwell's equations. He
proposed the displacement current essentially because the

164

equations were aesthetically-more appealing with it than
without it.
The universe is intricate and elegant. We wrest secrets from
nature by the most unlikely routes. Societies will, of course,
wish to exercise prudence in deciding which technologies-that
is, which applications of science-are to be pursued and which
not. But without funding basic research, without supporting the
acquisition of knowledge for its own sake, our options become
dangerously limited. Only one physicist in a thousand need
stumble upon something like the displacement current to make
the support of all thousand a superb investment for society.
Without vigorous, farsighted and continuing encouragement of
fundamental scientific research, we are in the position of eating
our seed corn: we may fend off starvation for one more winter,
but we have removed the last hope of surviving the following
winter.
In a time in some respects similar to our own, St. Augustine of
Hippo, after a lusty and intellectually inventive young manhood,
withdrew from the world of sense and intellect and advised
others to do likewise: "There is another form of temptation,
even more fraught with danger. This is the disease of curiosity.
... It is this which drives us on to try to discover the secrets of
nature, those secrets which are beyond our understanding,
which can avail us nothing and which men should not wish to
learn. ... In this immense forest, full of pitfalls and perils, I have
drawn myself back, and pulled myself away from these thorns.
In the midst of all these things which float unceasingly around
me in everyday life, I am never surprised at any of them, and
never captivated by my genuine desire to study them. ... I no
longer dream of the stars." The time of Augustine's death, 430
A.D., marks the beginning of the Dark Ages in Europe.
In the last chapter of The Ascent of Man Bronow-ski confessed
himself saddened "to find myself suddenly surrounded in the
West by a sense of terrible loss of nerve, a retreat from
knowledge." He was talking, I think, partly about the very
limited understanding and appreciation of science and
technology-which have shaped our lives and civilizations-in

165

public and political communities; but also about the increasing
popularity of various forms of marginal, folk- or
pseudo-science, mysticism and magic.
There is today in the West (but not in the East) a resurgent
interest in vague, anecdotal and often demonstrably erroneous
doctrines that, if true, would betoken at least a more interesting
universe, but that, if false, imply an intellectual carelessness, an
absence of tough-mindedness, and a diversion of energies not
very promising for our survival. Such doctrines include
astrology (the view that which stars, one hundred trillion miles
away, are rising at the moment of my birth in a closed building
affect my destiny profoundly); the Bermuda Triangle "mystery"
(which holds in many versions that an unidentified flying object
lives in the ocean off Bermuda and eats ships and airplanes);
flying saucer accounts in general; the belief in ancient
astronauts; the photography of ghosts; pyramidology (including
the view that my razor blade stays sharper within a cardboard
pyramid than within
a cardboard cube); Scientology; auras and Kirlian photography;
the emotional lives and musical preferences of geraniums;
psychic surgery; flat and hollow earths; modern prophecy;
remote cutlery warping; astral projections; Velikovskian
catastrophism; Atlantis and Mu; spiritualism; and the doctrine of
the special creation, by God or gods, of mankind despite our
deep relatedness, both in biochemistry and in brain physiology,
with the other animals. It may be that there are kernels of truth
in a few of these doctrines, but their widespread acceptance
betokens a lack of intellectual rigor, an absence of skepticism,
a need to replace experiments by desires. These are by and
large, if I may use the phrase, limbic and right-hemisphere
doctrines, dream protocols, natural-the word is certainly
perfectly appropriate-and human responses to the complexity
of the environment we inhabit. But they are also mystical and
occult doctrines, devised in such a way that they are not
subject to disproof and characteristically impervious to rational
discussion. In contrast, the aperture to a bright future lies
almost certainly through the full functioning of the neocortex
-reason alloyed with intuition and with limbic and R-complex

166

components, to be sure, but reason nonetheless: a courageous
working through of the world as it really is.
It is only in the last day of the Cosmic Calendar that substantial
intellectual abilities have evolved on the planet Earth. The
coordinated functioning of both cerebral hemispheres is the tool
Nature has provided for our survival. We are unlikely to survive
if we do not make full and creative use of our human
intelligence.
"We are a scientific civilization," declared Jacob Bronowski.
"That means a civilization in which knowledge and its integrity
are crucial. Science is only a Latin word for knowledge. . . .
Knowledge is our destiny."
