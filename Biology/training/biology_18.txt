2 Biology - The Life Science
The word biology means, "the science of life", from the Greek bios, life, and logos, word
or knowledge. Therefore, Biology is the science of Living Things. That is why Biology is
sometimes known as Life Science.
The science has been divided into many subdisciplines, such as botany1 , bacteriology,
anatomy2 , zoology, histology, mycology, embryology, parasitology, genetics3 , molecular biology4 , systematics, immunology, microbiology5 , physiology, cell biology6 , cytology, ecology7 ,
and virology. Other branches of science include or are comprised in part of biology studies,
including paleontology8 , taxonomy, evolution, phycology, helimentology, protozoology, entomology, biochemistry, biophysics, biomathematics, bio engineering, bio climatology and
anthropology.

2.1 Characteristics of life
Not all scientists agree on the definition of just what makes up life. Various characteristics
describe most living things. However, with most of the characteristics listed below we can
think of one or more examples that would seem to break the rule, with something nonliving
being classified as living or something living classified as nonliving. Therefore we are careful
not to be too dogmatic in our attempt to explain which things are living or nonliving.
• Living things are composed of matter structured in an orderly way where simple
molecules are ordered together into much larger macromolecules.
An easy way to remember this is GRIMNERD C All organisms; - Grow, Respire, Interact,
Move, Need Nutrients, Excrete (Waste), Reproduce,Death, Cells (Made of)
• Living things are sensitive, meaning they are able to respond to stimuli.
• Living things are able to grow, develop, and reproduce.
• Living things are able to adapt over time by the process of natural selection.
• All known living things use the hereditary molecule, DNA9 .

Biology - The Life Science
• Internal functions are coordinated and regulated so that the internal environment of a
living thing is relatively constant, referred to as homeostasis10 .
Living things are organized in the microscopic level from atoms up to cells11 . Atoms are
arranged into molecules, then into macromolecules12 , which make up organelles13 , which
work together to form cells. Beyond this, cells are organized in higher levels to form entire
multicellular organisms. Cells together form tissues14 , which make up organs, which are
part of organ systems, which work together to form an entire organism. Of course, beyond
this, organisms form populations which make up parts of an ecosystem. All of the Earth's
ecosystems together form the diverse environment that is the earth.
Example:sub atoms, atoms, molecules, cells, tissues, organs, organ systems, organisms, population,
community, eco systems

2.2 Nature of science
Science is a methodology for learning about the world. It involves the application
of knowledge.
The scientific method deals with systematic investigation, reproducible results, the
formation and testing of hypotheses, and reasoning.
Reasoning can be broken down into two categories, induction (specific data is used to
develop a generalized observation or conclusion) and deduction (general information leads
to specific conclusion). Most reasoning in science is done through induction.
Science as we now know it arose as a discipline in the 17th century.

2.3 Scientific method
The scientific method is not a step by step, linear process. It is an intuitive process, a
methodology for learning about the world through the application of knowledge. Scientists
must be able to have an "imaginative preconception" of what the truth is. Scientists will
often observe and then hypothesize the reason why a phenomenon occurred. They use all
of their knowledge and a bit of imagination, all in an attempt to uncover something that
might be true. A typical scientific investigation might go like so:
You observe that a room appears dark, and you ponder why the room is dark. In an attempt
to find explanations to this curiosity, your mind unravels several different hypotheses. One
hypothesis might state that the lights are turned off. Another hunch might be that the
room's lightbulb has burnt out. Worst yet, you could be going blind. To discover the truth,

Scientific method
you experiment. You feel your way around the room and find a light switch and turn it on.
No light. You repeat the experiment, flicking the switch back and forth. Still nothing. That
means your initial hypothesis, the room is dark because the lights are off, has been rejected.
You devise more experiments to test your hypotheses, utilizing a flashlight to prove that
you are indeed not blind. In order to accept your last remaining hypothesis as the truth,
you could predict that changing the light bulb will fix the problem. If all your predictions
succeed, the original hypothesis is valid and is accepted. In some cases, however, your
predictions will not occur, in which you'll have to start over. Perhaps the power is off.

Figure 1

How Science is Done

A diagram that illustrates scientific investigation

Scientists first make observations that raise a particular question. In order to explain the
observed phenomenon, they develop a number of possible explanations, or hypotheses. This
is the inductive part of science, observing and constructing plausible arguments for why

7

Biology - The Life Science
an event occurred. Experiments are then used to eliminate one of more of the possible
hypotheses until one hypothesis remains. Using deduction, scientists use the principles of
their hypothesis to make predictions, and then test to make sure that their predictions are
confirmed. After many trials (repeatability) and all predictions have been confirmed, the
hypothesis then may become a theory.
Quick Definitions
Observation - Quantitative and qualitative measurements of the world.
Inference - Deriving new knowledge based upon old knowledge.
Hypotheses - A suggested explanation.
Rejected Hypothesis - An explanation that has been ruled out through experimentation.
Accepted Hypothesis - An explanation that has not been ruled out through excessive
experimentation and makes verifiable predictions that are true.
Experiment - A test that is used to rule out a hypothesis or validate something already
known.
Scientific Method - The process of scientific investigation.
Theory - A widely accepted hypothesis that stands the test of time. Often tested, and
usually never rejected.
The scientific method is based primarily on the testing of hypotheses by experimentation.
This involves a control, or subject that does not undergo the process in question. A scientist
will also seek to limit variables to one or another very small number, single or minimum
number of variables. The procedure is to form a hypothesis or prediction about what you
believe or expect to see and then do everything you can to violate that, or falsify the
hypotheses. Although this may seem unintuitive, the process serves to establish more firmly
what is and what is not true.
A founding principle in science is a lack of absolute truth: the accepted explanation is the
most likely and is the basis for further hypotheses as well as for falsification. All knowledge
has its relative uncertainty.
Theories are hypotheses which have withstood repeated attempts at falsification. Common
theories include evolution by natural selection and the idea that all organisms consist of
cells. The scientific community asserts that much more evidence supports these two ideas
than contradicts them.

Charles Darwin

2.4 Charles Darwin

Figure 2
Charles Darwin is most remembered today for his contribution of the theory of evolution
through natural selection.
The seeds of this theory were planted in Darwin's mind through observations made on a
five-year voyage through the New World on a ship called the Beagle. There, he studied
fossils and the geological record, geographic distribution of organisms, the uniqueness and
relatedness of island life forms, and the affinity of island forms to mainland forms.
Upon his return to England, Darwin pondered over his observations and concluded that
evolution must occur through natural selection. He declined, however, to publish his work
because of its controversial nature. However, when another scientist, Wallace, reached similar
conclusions, Darwin was convinced to publish his observations in 1859. His hypothesis
revolutionized biology and has yet to be falsified by empirical data collected by mainstream
scientists.

2.5 After Darwin
Since Darwin's day, scientists have amassed a more complete fossil record, including
microorganisms and chemical fossils. These fossils have supported and added subtleties
to Darwin's theories. However, the age of the Earth is now held to be much older than
Darwin thought. Researchers have also uncovered some of the preliminary mysteries of
the mechanism of heredity as carried out through genetics and DNA, areas unknown to
Darwin. Another growing area is comparative anatomy including homology and analogy.
Today we can see a bit of evolutionary history in the development of embryos, as certain
(although not all) aspects of development recapitulate evolutionary history.

9

Biology - The Life Science
The molecular biology15 study of slowly mutating genes reveal considerable evolutionary
history consistent with fossil and anatomical record.

2.6 Challenges to Darwin

Figure 3

Darwin and his theories have been challenged many times in the last 150 years. The
challenges have been primarily religious based on a perceived conflict with the preconceived
notion of creationism. Many of those who challenge Darwin have been adherents to the
young earth hypothesis that says that the Earth is only some 6000 years old and that all
species were individually created by a god. Some of the proponents of these theories have
suggested that chemical and physical laws that exist today were different or nonexistent in
earlier ages. However, for the most part, these theories are either not scientifically testable
and fall outside the area of attention of the field of biology, or have been disproved by one
or more fields of science.

State University.

Chemical bonds

3.5 Chemical bonds
•
•
•
•

Form molecules
Enzymes: make, break, rearrange chemical bonds in living systems
Ionic
Covalent
• Sharing of one or more pairs of electrons
• Called single, double, or triple
• No net charge (as in ionic bonds)
• No free electrons
• Give rise to discrete molecules
• Hydrogen

3.6 Chemical reactions
•
•
•
•

Formation and breaking of chemical bonds
Shifting arrangement of atoms
Reactants -> products
Reactions are influenced by:
• Temperature
• Concentration of reactants, products
• Presence of catalysts (enzymes)
• Oxidation:reduction

3.7 Water
•
•
•
•
•
•

Essential for life
˜75% earth's surface is water
Life evolved in water
Solvent for many types of solutes
High specific heat
High polarity
• Creates a slightly negative Oxygen and a Slightly positive hydrogen
• allows formation of Hydrogen Bonds

3.7.1 Hydrogen bonding
• A type of polar interaction
• Critical for:
• Protein structure
• Enzymatic reactions
• Movement of water in plant stems
• Weak and transient
• Powerful cumulative effect

13

The Nature of Molecules
• Solubility of many compounds
• Cohesion (capillary action)
• Lower density of ice
• Formed between molecules other than water
• Protein structure
• DNA11 , RNA12 structure
Water organizes nonpolar molecules
• Nonpolar molecules: no polarity (+/-) charges
• Hydrophobic: exclude water because they don't form hydrogen bonds with it
• Consequences:
• Membranes
• Protein structure
• Hydrophilic: polar substances associate with water
Ionization of water: H2 O -> H+ + OH• Forms a Hydrogen ion (H+ ), hydroxide ion (OH- )
• Due to spontaneous breakage of covalent bond
• At 25°C, 1 liter of water contains 10-7 moles of H+ ions: 10-7 moles/liter
pH
•
•
•
•
•

A convenient way of indicating H+ concentration
pH13 = -log[H+ ]
For water, pH = -log[10-7] = 7
Since for each H+ in pure water, there is one OH- , pH of 7 indicates neutrality
Logarithmic scale

Buffer
• Reservoir for H+
• Maintains relatively constant pH over buffering range

5 Life: History and Origin
5.1 Properties of life
1. Organization: Being structurally composed of one or more cells, which are the basic
units of life.
• prokaryote: no nucleus
• eukaryote: membrane bound nucleus.
2. Sensitivity: respond to stimuli.
3. Energy Processing
4. Growth and Development
5. Reproduction
• hereditary mechanisms to make more of self; DNA based.
6. Regulation, including homeostasis.
7. Evolution.

5.2 Origin of life: 3 hypotheses
• Extraterrestrial origin (panspermia): meteor, comet borne from elsewhere in universe
• evidence of amino acids and other organic material in space (but often both D & L
forms)
• questionable bacterial fossils in Martian rock
-However, this would imply that some other origin of life was likely because it would have
had to happen elsewhere before it could be transported here, and the only difference would
be that life did not originate on Earth.
• Spontaneous origin on earth: primitive self-replicating macromolecules acted upon by
natural selection ((macro)Evolution is one example of this)
-This is often attacked for the seeming impossibility for life to have been produced by a
chemical reaction triggered by lightning and the ability of any produced DNA to actually be
in a sequence that could produce a working model of life if replicated. It is also attacked
for religious reasons, as it bypasses things like the idea of a supreme being directly creating
humans. It also seems unlikely to some that such huge changes are possible in evolution

19

Life: History and Origin
without evidence of an "in-between stage" that is credible. Many of the stages of man are
disputed due to their somewhat shakey grounds. For example, bones from other animals
have been taken accidentally in some cases to be part of a humanoid, and complete skeletons
have been sketched out from a limited number of bones.
• Special creation: religious explanations (Intelligent Design is one popular example of
this.) These explanations contend that life was created by God (or perhaps some other
Intelligent Designer).
• Proponents of Intelligent design suggest that the vast complexity of life could only
have been intentionally designed while other creationists cite biblical support.
-This is often attacked for many of the same reasons that religion is attacked, and is often
regarded as superstitious and/or unscientific.
• It is debated as to whether schools should teach one hypothesis or the other when talking
about the origin of life. However, since they are all currently known major hypotheses
(and sometimes hypotheses proven wrong are shown for educational purposes), this
wikibook includes what it can without discriminating unfairly against one hypothesis or
the other.

5.3 The early earth
It is believed that the Earth was formed about 4.5 billion years ago.
• Heavy bombardment by rubble ceased about 3.8 billion years ago.
• Reducing atmosphere: much free H
• also H2 O, NH3 , CH4
• little, if any, free O2
• with numerous H electrons, require little energy to form organic compounds with C
• Warm oceans, estimated at 49-88°C
• Lack of O2 and consequent ozone (O3 ) meant considerable UV energy
Chemical reactions on early earth
• UV and other energy sources would promote chemical reactions and formation of organic
molecules
• Testable hypothesis: Miller-Urey experiment
• simulated early atmospheric conditions
• found amino acids, sugars, etc., building blocks of life
• won Nobel prize for work
• experiment showed prebiotic synthesis of biological molecules was possible
Issues
• Miller later conceded that the conditions in his experiments were not representative of
what is currently thought to be those of early earth
• He also conceded that science has no answer for how amino acids could self-organize into
replicating molecules and cells
• In the 50 years since Miller-Urey, significant issues and problems for biogenesis have been
identified. This is a weak hypothesis at this time.

20

Origin of cells
• Conclusion: Life exists, we don't know why.

5.4 Origin of cells
Cells are very small and decompose quickly after death. As such, fossils of the earliest cells
do not exist. Scientists have had to form a variety of theories on how cells (and hence life)
was created on Earth.
• Bubble hypothesis
• A. Oparin, J.B.S. Haldane, 1930’s
• Primary abiogenesis: life as consequence of geochemical processes
• Protobionts: isolated collections of organic material enclosed in hydrophobic bubbles
• Numerous variants: microspheres, protocells, protobionts, micelles, liposomes, coacervates
• Other surfaces for evolution of life
• deep sea thermal vents
• ice crystals
• clay surfaces
• tidal pools

5.5 The RNA world?
• DNA → RNA → polypeptide (protein)
• Catalytic RNA: ribozyme
• discovered independently by Tom Cech and Sid Altman (Nobel prize)
• catalytic properties: hydrolysis, polymerization, peptide bond formation, etc.
• Self-replicating RNA molecule may have given rise to life
• consistent with numerous roles for RNA in cells as well as roles for ribonucleotides
(ATP)
• relationship to bubble-like structures is uncertain

5.6 The earliest cells
• Microfossils
• ˜3.5 by
• resemble bacteria: prokaryotes
• biochemical residues
• stromatolites
• Archaebacteria (more properly Archaea)
• extremophiles: salt, acid, alkali, heat, methanogens
• may not represent most ancient life
• Eubacteria
• cyanobacteria: photosynthesis
• atmospheric O2 ; limestone deposits

21

Life: History and Origin
• chloroplasts of eukaryotes
Cyanobacteria

5.7 Major steps in evolution of life
• Prebiotic synthesis of macromolecules
• Self replication
• RNA? (primitive metabolism)
• DNA as hereditary material
• 1st cells
• Photosynthesis
• Aerobic respiration
• Multicellularity (more than once)

7 Cell structure
7.1 What is a cell?
The word cell comes from the Latin word "cella", meaning "small room", and it was first
coined by a microscopist observing the structure of cork. The cell is the basic unit of all
living things, and all organisms are composed of one or more cells. Cells are so basic and
critical to the study of life, in fact, that they are often referred to as "the building blocks of
life". Organisms - bacteria, amoebae and yeasts, for example - may consist of as few as one
cell, while a typical human body contains about a trillion cells.
According to Cell Theory, first proposed by Schleiden and Schwann in 1839, all life consists
of cells. The theory also states that all cells come from previously living cells, all vital
functions (chemical reactions) of organisms are carried out inside of cells, and that cells
contain necessary hereditary information to carry out necessary functions and replicate
themselves.
All cells contain:
•
•
•
•

Lipid bilayer boundary (plasma membrane1 )
Cytoplasm2
DNA3 (hereditary information)
Ribosomes4 for protein synthesis

Eukaryotic cells also contain:
• At least one nucleus5
• Mitochondria6 for cell respiration and energy
Cells may also contain:

Cell structure

7.1.1 Concepts
Plasma Membrane
Phospholipid bilayer, which contains great amount of proteins, the most important functions
are the following:
1. It selectively isolates the content of the cell of the external atmosphere.
2. It regulates the interchange of substances between the cytoplasm and the environment.
3. Communicates with other cells.
Model of the fluid mosaic
Describes the structure of the plasma membrane, this model was developed in 1972 by
cellular biologists J. Singer and L. Nicholson.
Phospholipid bilayer
Is in the plasma membrane and produces the fluid part of membranes.
Proteins
Long chains of amino acids.
Glucose proteins
Proteins together with carbohydrates in the plasma membrane, mostly in the outer parts
of the cell.
Functions of proteins
Transport oxygen, they are components of hair and nails, and allow the cell interact with
its environment.
Transport Proteins
Regulate the movement of soluble water molecules, through the plasma membrane. Some
transport proteins called channel proteins form pores or channels in the membrane so
that water soluble molecules pass.
Carrying proteins
Have union sites that can hold specific molecules.
Reception proteins
They activate cellular responses when specific molecules join.
Proteins of recognition
They work as identifiers and as place of union to the cellular surface.
Fluid
It is any substance that can move or change of form.
Concentration
Number of molecules in a determined unit of volume.

26

What is a cell?
Gradient
Physical difference between two regions of space, in such a way that the molecules tend to
move in response to the gradients.
Diffusion
Movement of the molecules in a fluid, from the regions of high concentration to those of
low concentration.
Passive transport
Movement of substances in a membrane that doesn’t need to use energy.
Simple diffusion
Diffusion of water, gases or molecules across the membrane.
Facilitated diffusion
Diffusion of molecules across the membranes with the participation of proteins.
Osmosis
Diffusion of the water across a membrane with differential permeability.
Transport that needs energy
Movement of substances across a membrane generally in opposition to a gradient of
concentration with the requirement of energy.
Active transport
Movement of small molecules using energy (ATP).
Endocytosis
Movement of big particles towards the interior of the cell using energy. The cells enclose
particles or liquids.
Pinocytosis
(Literally cell drinking) Form in which the cell introduces liquids.
Phagocytosis
Way of eating of the cells. It feeds in this case of big particles or entire microorganisms.
Pseudopods
False feet (the amoeba).
Exocitosis
Movement of materials out of the cell with the use of energy. It throws waste material.
Isotonic
The cytoplasm fluid of the interior of the cells is the same that the outer.
Hypertonic solution

27

Cell structure
The solutions that have a higher concentration of dissolved particles than the cellular
cytoplasm and that therefore water of the cells goes out with osmosis.
Hypotonic
The solutions with a concentration of dissolved particles lower than the cytoplasm of a cell
and that therefore do that water enters the cell with osmosis.
Swelling
Pressure of the water inside the vacuole.
Endoplasmic Reticulum
It is the place of the synthesis of the cellular membrane.

7.1.2 Structure and function of the cell
Rudolf Virchow
Zoologist, who proposed the postulates of the cellular theory, observes that the living cells
could grow and be in two places at the same time, he proposed that all the cells come from
other equal cells and proposed 3 postulates:
1. Every living organism is formed from one or more cells
2. The smallest organisms are unicellular and these in turn are the functional units of
the multicellular organisms.
3. All the cells come from preexisting cells.

7.1.3 Common characteristics of all the cells
Molecular components
Proteins, amino acids, lipids, sweeten, DNA, RNA.
Structural components
Plasmatic membrane, citoplasm, ribosomes.
Robert Hooke
He postuled for the first time the term cell
Prokaryotes
Their genetic material is not enclosed in a membrane ex. Bacterias
Eukaryotes
Their genetic material is contained inside a nucleus closed by a membrane

History of cell knowledge

7.2 History of cell knowledge
The optical microscope was first invented in 17th century. Shortly thereafter scientists began
to examine living and dead biological tissues in order to better understand the science of
life. Some of the most relevant discovery milestones of the time period include:
• The invention of the microscope11 , which allowed scientists for the first time to see
biological cells
• Robert Hooke12 in 1665 looked at cork under a microscope and described what he called
cork "cells"
• Anton van Leeuwenhoek13 called the single-celled organisms that he saw under the
microscope "animalcules"
• Matthias Jakob Schleiden14 , a botanist, in 1838 determined that all plants consist of
cells
• Theodor Schwann15 , a zoologist, in 1839 determined that all animals consist of cells
• Rudolf Virchow16 proposed the theory that all cells arise from previously existing cells
In 1838, the botanist Matthias Jakob Schleiden and the physiologist Theodor Schwann
discovered that both plant cells and animal cells had nuclei. Based on their observations,
the two scientists conceived of the hypothesis that all living things were composed of cells.
In 1839, Schwann published 'Microscopic Investigations on the Accordance in the Structure
and Growth of Plants and Animals', which contained the first statement of their joint cell
theory.

7.2.1 Cell Theory
Schleiden and Schwann proposed spontaneous generation as the method for cell origination,
but spontaneous generation (also called abiogenesis17 ) was later disproven. Rudolf Virchow
famously stated "Omnis cellula e cellula"... "All cells only arise from pre-existing cells." The
parts of the theory that did not have to do with the origin of cells, however, held up to
scientific scrutiny and are widely agreed upon by the scientific community today.
The generally accepted portions of the modern Cell Theory are as follows: (1) The cell is the
fundamental unit of structure and function in living things. (2) All organisms are made up
of one or more cells. (3) Cells arise from other cells through cellular division. (4) Cells carry
genetic material passed to daughter cells during cellular division. (5) All cells are essentially
the same in chemical composition. (6) Energy flow (metabolism and biochemistry) occurs
within cells.

7.3 Microscopes
•
•
•

•
•

Allow greater resolution, can see finer detail
Eye: resolution of ˜ 100 μm
Light microscope18 : resolution of ˜ 200 nm
Limited to cells are larger organelles within cells
Confocal microscopy19 : 2 dimension view
Electron microscope20 : resolution of ˜0.2 nm
Laser tweezers: move cell contents

7.4 Cell size
One may wonder why all cells are so small. If being able to store nutrients is beneficial
to the cell, how come there are no animals existing in nature with huge cells? Physical
limitations prevent this from occurring. A cell must be able to diffuse gases and nutrients in
and out of the cell. A cell's surface area does not increase as quickly as its volume, and as a
result a large cell may require more input of a substance or output of a substance than it
is reasonably able to perform. Worse, the distance between two points within the cell can
be large enough that regions of the cell would have trouble communicating, and it takes a
relatively long time for substances to travel across the cell.
That is not to say large cells don't exist. They are, once again, less efficient at exchanging
materials within themselves and with their environment, but they are still functional. These
cells typically have more than one copy of their genetic information, so they can manufacture
proteins locally within different parts of the cell.
Key concepts: Cell size:
• Is limited by need for regions of cell to communicate
• Diffuse oxygen and other gases
• Transport of mRNA21 and protein22 s
• Surface area to volume ratio limited
• Larger cells typically:
• Have extra copies of genetic information
• Have slower communication between parts of cell

8 Structure of Eukaryotic cells
Eukaryotic1 cells feature membrane delimited nucleii containing two or more linear chromosome2 s; numerous membrane-bound cytoplasmic organelles: mitochondria, RER3 , SER4 ,
lysosomes, vacuole5 s, chloroplast6 s; ribosomes and a cytoskeleton7 . Also, plants, fungi, and
some protists have a cell wall.

8.1 Structure of the nucleus
The nucleus is the round object in the cell that holds the genetic information (DNA) of the
cell. It is surrounded by a nuclear envelope and has a nucleolus inside.

8.1.1 Nuclear envelope
The nuclear envelope is a double-layered plasma membrane8 like the cell membrane, although
without membrane proteins. To allow some chemicals to enter the nucleus, the nuclear
envelope has structures called Nuclear pore9 s. The nuclear envelope is continuous with the
endoplasmic reticulum.

8.1.2 Nucleolus
The nucleolus appears in a microscope as a small dark area within the nucleus. The nucleolus
is the area where there is a high amount of DNA transcription10 taking place.

8.2 Chromatin
Chromosomes consist of chromatin11 . This is made up of strings of DNA, which typically
measure centimeters in length if stretched out. This DNA is wound around a histone12 core
and organized into nucleosome13 s.
The chromatin14 must be uncoiled for gene expression15 and replication16 . Chromosome
micrograph

8.3 Endoplasmic reticulum
The endoplasmic reticulum17 is a cellular organelle18 made up of a series of extended folded
intracellular membranes. It is continuous with the nuclear membane.
There are two main types of endoplasmic reticulum:
• RER: rough endoplasmic reticulum (site of protein synthesis19 ) associated with ribosomes
• SER: smooth endoplasmic reticulum (site of lipid synthesis20 )

8.3.1 Rough Endoplasmic Reticulum
Proteins are directed to the RER by a signal sequence of a growing polypeptide21 s on
the ribosome. This is recognised by a signal recognition particle which brings the ribosome/polypeptide complex to a channel on the RER called a translocon. At the translocon,
the signal sequence and ribosome/polypeptide complex interact with the translocon to open
it. The signal sequence becomes attached to the translocon. The ribosome can continue to
translate the polypeptide into the lumen of the RER. As synthesis continues, 2 processes
can happen.
1. If the protein is destined to become a membrane bound protein then the protein
synthesis will continue until termination. The ribosome can then dissociate, allowing
protein folding within the RER lumen to occur and continuation to the golgi apparatus
for processing of the polypeptide.
2. If the protein is destined for storage for later secretion after stimulation or for continuous
secretion then a protease-enzyme which cuts proteins at the peptide bond-can cut the
signal sequence from the growing polypeptide. Continuation to the golgi etc. can then
occur.

Endoplasmic reticulum
When produced, proteins are then exported to one of several locations. The proteins are
either modified for extracellular membrane insertion or secretion. Note, this is in contrast
with ribosomes which do not associate with the RER and produce proteins which will become
cytosolic enzymes for example.

8.3.2 Smooth Endoplasmic Reticulum
Smooth endoplasmic reticulum produces enzyme22 s for lipid and carbohydrate biosynthesis
and detoxification RER

8.3.3 Sarcoplasmic Reticulum
This is a specialised form of endoplasmic reticulum found in some muscle cell typesparticularly striated, skeletal muscle. Its main function is different from the other 2 types in
that is mainly acts as a storage of calcium. This reticulum has voltage gated channels which
respond to signals from 'motor neurones' to open and release calcium into the cytoplasm.
This can then bring about the next part in muscle contraction.

Structure of Eukaryotic cells

8.4 The Golgi apparatus
The golgi apparatus24 is made up of multiple stacks of bilipid membranes.
• Proteins made on the RER are modified and then sorted
• Formation of secretory vesicles
• Formation of lysosomes (intracellular digestion)
Other membrane-bound cytoplasmic organelles include:
• Microbodies25 (generic term)
• Glyoxysome (transforms fat into carbohydrate in plants)
• Peroxisome26 (uses oxidative metabolism to form hydrogen peroxide and is destroyed by
catalase27 )

8.5 Ribosomes
Ribosomes are the site of protein synthesis. Ribosomes themselves are synthesized in the
cell nucleoli28 and are structured as two subunits, the large and the small. These parts are
composed of RNA and protein.
Prokaryotic and eukaryotic ribosomes are different, the eukaryotic ones being larger and
more complicated.

Cytoskeleton
• Microtubule organizing centers
• Animal cells and many protists
• Pair constitutes the centrosome
• Give rise to flagellum during spermatogenesis
• Consist of 9 triplet microtubules
• Mitosis31 , meiosis32

8.7 Cytoskeleton
Cytoskeleton is a collective term for different filaments of proteins that can give physical
shape within the cell and are responsible for the 'roads' which organelles can be carried
along.
• Gives the cell shape
• Anchors other organelles
• Vital to intracellular transport of large molecules
The cytoskeleton is composed of 3 main types of filaments:
• Actin33 filaments (7 nm)
• Microtubule34 s: (25 nm) polymer of tubulin; 13/ring.
• Intermediate Filament35 s
Both actin and microtubules can have associated motor proteins.

8.7.1 Intermediate Filaments
These are rope like filaments, 8-10nm in diameter and tend to give the structural stability to
cells. Examples inculude Vimentin, neurofilaments and keratin. It is keratin which priniciply
makes up hair, nails and horns.

8.7.2 Actin Filaments
Growth
These filaments are 2-stranded and composed of dimeric subunits called G-Actin. They
contain a GTP molecule in order to bind (polymerise). As GTP is hydrolysed then the
structure becomes unstable and depolymerisation occurs. The growth of actin filaments is
concentration dependant-that is, the higher the concentration of free G-actin, the greater
the polymerisation. The are also polar, having a + and a - end (not related to charge) and
polymerisation tends to happen faster at the + end.

9.1 Biological membranes

Figure 5

Plasma membrane bilayer

37

Membranes
Biological membranes surround cells and serve to keep the insides separated from the outsides.
They are formed of phospholipid bilayer1 s, which by definition are a double layer of fatty
acid2 molecules (mostly phospholipid3 s, lipids containing lots of phosphorus).
Proteins4 serve very important functions in cellular membranes. They are active transports
in and out of the cell, acting as gatekeepers. They relay signals in and out of the cell.
Proteins are the site of many enzymatic reactions in the cell, and play a role in
regulation of cellular processes.

9.2 Phospholipid
Phospholipid bilayer

• Strength of covalent bond is measured by amount of energy required to break it
• 98.8 kcal/mole of C-H bonds
• In chemical reaction, energy stored in covalent bonds may transfer to new bonds. When
this involves transfer of electrons, it is oxidation–reduction reaction
• Always take place together
• Electron lost by atom or molecule through oxidation is gained by another atom or
molecule through reduction
• Potential energy is transferred from one molecule to another (but never 100%)

11.4 Free energy
• Energy required to break and subsequently form other chemical bonds
• Chemical bonds: sharing of electrons, tend to hold atoms of molecule together
• Heat, by increasing atomic motion, makes it easier to break bonds (entropy)
• Energy available to do work in a system
• In cells, G = H - TS
• G = Gibbs’ free energy
• H = H (enthalpy) energy in molecule’s chemical bonds
• TS (T, temperature in °K; S, entropy)
• Chemical reactions break and make bonds, producing changes in energy
• Under constant conditions of temperature, pressure and volume, ∆G = ∆H - T∆S
• ∆G, change in free energy
• If positive (+), H is higher, S is lower, so there is more free energy; endergonic reaction,
does not proceed spontaneously; require input of energy (e.g., heat)
• If negative (–), H is lower, S is higher. Product has less free energy; exergonic;
spontaneous
===Activation energy = ==

12 Respiration: harvesting of energy
Glucose + O2 → CO2 + H2 O + ATP

12.1 Energy
• Energy is primarily in C-H bonds (C-O too)

some bacteria)
• Heterotrophs: live on energy produced by autotrophs (most bacteria and protists,
fungi, animals)

2NADH
• Substrate level phosphorylation
• G3P to pyruvate forms 2 ATP molecules
4 ATP (from 2 G3P)

–2 ATP (priming)

Summary: The net input of glycolysis is 2 ATP molecules which are used to split one glucose
molecule. The net yield of this step is 2 ATP and 2 pyruvate.

12.6 Regeneration of NAD+

49

13 Photosynthesis
6 CO2 + 6 H2 O → C6 H12 O6 + 6 O2
• One of most important reactions in history of life:
• source of atmospheric O2
• ultimately led to aerobic respiration and eukaryotes
• Responsible for bulk of glucose production
• Early experiments showed that mass of plant must be derived from substances in the air,
not the soil
• Experiments with isotopes showed that liberated oxygen comes from water
• Experiments also showed that light is essential but that some reactions (e.g., reduction of
CO2 ) continue in the dark
• Plants do two big, important things during photosynthesis: gain energy (absorb light)
and build sugar (glucose).
• Photosynthesis can be divided into two series of chemical reactions: the light (lightdependent) reactions and the dark (light-independent) reactions. In light reactions, light
is absorbed; in dark reactions, sugar is built.
• Occurs when plants, algae, and autotrophic bacteria absorb light energy and build glucose.

13.1 Light Reactions
•
•
•
•
•

Part of the electromagnetic spectrum
Consists of units of energy called photons
Photons at UV end of spectrum have more energy than those at the red end
Occur on the surface of thylakoid disks
Chlorophyll and other plant pigments differentially absorb photons
• Chlorophyll a: light to chemical energy
• Chlorophyll b: accessory chlorophyll
• Chlorophylls absorb primarily blue and red (green reflected back, hence the green
color of plants)

13.1.1 Accessory pigments
• Chlorophyll is a major light gathering pigment
• Absorbs light with considerable efficiency (i.e., retaining energy)
• Accessory pigments
• Chlorophyll b
• Carotenoinds
• capture light of wavelengths not captured by chlorophylls

51

Photosynthesis
• Confer other colors to plant leaves (autumn colors too)
Photosynthetic steps
• Primary photoevent: light photon captured by photosystem and energy transferred to
electron donated by water
• Electron transport: excited electron is shuttled along imbedded series of electron carriers
to proton pump and electron is transferred to acceptor
• Chemiosmosis: transport of protons back into chloroplast drives synthesis of ATP

13.1.2 The Even More Detailed Light Reactions
What the Light Reactions Do:
The light reactions of photosynthesis occur in chloroplasts in and on the thylakoid disks.
During the light reactions, light energy charges up ATP molecules. More specifically, light
turns the chloroplast into an acid battery, and this battery charges up ATP.
How the "Chloroplast-Battery" Charges ATP:
The stroma is the fluid inside of the chloroplasts, and it carries a negative charge. This
means that it contains about a "gazillion" extra electrons. The solvent of stroma is water.
The fluid inside the thylakoid disks is positively charged because it contains a lot of hydrogen
(H+) ions. The pH here is low, making the fluid very acidic. The solvent of thylakoid disk
fluid is water.
A chloroplast acts like a battery, because it has separated a strong positive charge and a
strong negative charge in two different compartments. Energy is released when H+ ions
(free protons) flow from the inside of a thylakoid disk to the stroma. This is electrical energy,
since it is a flow of charged particles.
The protons pass through special channels (made of protein) in the thylakoid membrane;
this reaction is 'exothermic.' The energy that is given off is used to fuel this reaction (Pi is
the phosphate ion):
ADP + Pi --> ATP

The proton can go to the negative stroma, but only if it uses its energy to charge up ATP.
Since one reaction wants to go, and the other one doesn't, and since the first reaction releases
energy and the second one absorbs energy, the two reactions are known to be 'coupled'
together so that the first fuels the second. Of course, a special enzyme must be involved for
this to happen.
Chlorophyll Molecules on a Thylakoid Disk:
Hundreds of chlorophyll molecules cover the surface of a thylakoid disk, making the disk
green. The nonpolar "tails" of the chlorophyll molecule are embedded in the membrane of
the thylakoid.

52

“Dark” reactions

13.2 “Dark” reactions
•
•
•
•

ATP drives endergonic reactions
NADPH provides hydrogens for reduction of CO2 to carbohydrate (C-H bonds)
Occur in the stroma
First step in carbon fixation

13.2.1 The Detailed Dark Reactions
What the Dark Reactions Do:
The dark reactions build sugar from carbon dioxide gas (CO2), water (H2O), and energy
from ATP molecules that were charged up during the light reactions. The dark reactions
occur in the stroma of a chloroplast. Dark reactions usually occur in the light, but they
don't have to. They'll occur in the dark until the chloroplast's supply of ATP runs out
(usually about 30 seconds).
The Calvin Cycle:
The Calvin Cycle is the fancy name for the metabolic pathway that builds sugar. This
means that it involves a whole lot of chemical reactions, and it uses a lot of different enzymes
to catalyze the reactions.
Carbon dioxide gas is stable, therefore the bonds that hold the carbon and oxygen atoms
are strong. Therefore it takes a lot of energy to break the bonds and separate the carbon
atoms from the oxygen atoms. The energy needed to do this comes from ATP molecules.
When inorganic carbon (like from CO2) is being added to an organic molecule (such as
sugar), this is called carbon fixation.
It takes 2 complete turns of the Calvin Cycle to make a glucose molecule.

• Reciprocal, physical exchange between nonsister chromatids
• Type of recombination; mixes maternal and paternal genes
• Visual evidence: chiasmata

14.6 Microtubules and anaphase I
• During prophase microtubules attach to kinetochores on one side of centromere
• The metaphase checkpoint insures proper attachment
• A phosphorylation event initiates motor activity and anaphase

14.7 Meiosis II
• Cytologically similar to mitosis
• No preceding DNA replication
• Chromatids segregate and move to opposite poles as chromosomes
• 4 haploid cells produced
• In animals, these cells differentiate into gametes
• In plants and many other organisms, these cells divide by mitosis, followed some time
later by gamete formation

14.8 Evolution of sex
• Asexual reproduction: all offspring genetically identical to parent

60

Consequences of sex
• Sex: recombination destroys advantageous combinations
• So why sex?
• Many hypotheses
• Effect repair of genetic damage?
• Much pachytene repair as well as gene conversion
• Some protists form diploid cells in response to stress
• Recombination breaks up combinations of genes favoring parasites, thus reducing
parasitism?

14.9 Consequences of sex
• Recombination: generates genetic diversity
• Crossing over

16 Gregor Mendel and biological
inheritance
Charles Darwin1 , for all he contributed to the science of biology, never knew about the
mechanism by which living things inherit traits from previous generations, or how new traits
arise.
As any schoolchild can tell you, this mechanism of interitance has since been found to be
DNA2 , or deoxyribonucleic acid. DNA allows for stable inheritance of traits: the code in
each strand of DNA is replicated precisely through the pairing of basic units along each
strand. The error rate in this replication is amazingly low; not even one base pair in a
million matches out of sequence.
However, when even one base pair is added to a new strain of DNA in an order differently
than in the parent chain, it can be the basis of a mutation. These changes in DNA sequences
are the microscopic origin of changes in traits of all studied living things. Even the smallest
difference in a strand of DNA can result in a change in traits that can cost the life of the
organism. Mutations can produce proteins with a new or altered function. In humans, the
example of Sickle cell anemia3 is commonly given as its origin is a difference of only one
base pair in a section of DNA that encodes red blood cells.
Individual sequences of DNA that encode for specific proteins are called genes and are the
units of heredity. Each one has a set nucleotide4 , and together all of the genes (and some
sequence of DNA that apparently do not code for any biologically important functions)
together make up the entire chromosome5

16.1 Mendel
Discovered principle of genetic segregation via numerous experiments utilizing pea plants
Inferred the existence of genes through segregation of phenotypes
Used quantitative methods: counted; ratios
Work is model of scientific method
In particular, observed the F2 progeny, which lead to the discovery of dominant and
recessive traits
• Published work in 1866, went unnoticed
• In 1900 his scientific paper was “rediscovered”

Gregor Mendel and biological inheritance
• Mendel is acknowledged as founder of Genetics
• still used alphabet letters to designate genes
• still refer to dominant and recessive genes
• still refer to segregation of alleles in meiosis
• principle of segregation applies to all sexually reproducing organisms; Mendel’s results
were immediately applied to humans in 1900

16.2 Mendel’s experiments
•

•
•
•

•

•
•
•
•
•

1856, began experiments with the garden pea, Pisum sativum
1865, presented results to the Bruno natural history society, which he helped found
1866, published his results in proceedings of the society
Naegeli encouraged Mendel to reproduce results in another species, which failed because
the species did not undergo true fertilization
discrete traits in Pisum sativum
• pure-breeding lines
• dominant/recessive alleles
alleles are two alternate versions of a gene
• gametes contain hybridized chromosomes that are formed during meiosis
• homozygous has two of the same allele
• heterozygous has two different alleles
reciprocal F1 crosses (all exhibiting dominant phenotypes); F2; F3
counted offspring, noted ratios
inferred genotypes from phenotypes
tested hypotheses with testcrosses
attempted to repeat with another species

16.4 Locus
• The location of a specific gene within a chromosome

66

Modern Y chromosome

16.5 Modern Y chromosome
Y-chromosome is the most evolved chromosome. Generally it is thought that if Y- chromosome is present in an individual then he will be male. But if mutation occurs at sex
determining region or zinc factor then it will not code for testis determining factor, and
results in normal female. This type of female's frequency is 1/250000.

16.6 Chromosome phenomena
• X-chromosome inactivation
• Barr bodies
• Nondisjunction: failure of chromosome segregation at meiosis or mitosis
• Results in 2N ± 1 chromosome number
• Trisomy 2N + 1
• Usually lethal. Trisomy 21 (Down) exception
• Monosomy 2N ** 1
• Lethal except XO
• Usually maternal origin in humans

16.7 X-chromosome inactivation
In females, one X-chromosone is randomly switched off forming a Barr body.

16.8 Barr body
Dense region in the nucleus formed by the inactive X-chromosome.

16.9 Human genetic disorders
Down's Syndrome(Mongolism)
Down's Syndrome is usually produced by the nondisjunction of chromosome 21 during
oogenesis and sometimes during spermatogenesis. The individual suffering from this type of
syndrome has 47 chromosomes instead of the normal 46. The extra chromosome is not a sex
chromosome but an autosome.
Most cases of mongolism were found to occur in children born by women in their forties.
The affected children, called mongoloids, show mental retardation and have a shorter life
expectancy. Their most prominent feature is the Mongolian folds in their eyes; hence, the
term mongolism.
Klinefelter's Syndrome

67

Gregor Mendel and biological inheritance
When an XY-bearing sperm unites with an X-bearing egg, the resulting condition is called
Klinefelter's Syndrome, or sexually undeveloped male. Individuals having the syndrome
show the following characteristics:
•
•
•
•
•

testes are small
sperms are never produced
breasts are enlarged
body hair is sparse
individuals are mentally defective

The same abnormal meiotic division may occur in females. They produce eggs with XX or
no sex chromosomes. Such egg, when fertilized by a Y-bearing sperm, will not develop (YO).
This is because YO is lethal--it wil cause death to the offspring.

17 DNA: The Genetic Material
17.1 DNA
DNA stands for Deoxyribose Nucleic Acid. That is, a nucleic acid with two sugars. DNA is
the hereditary material of cells and is considered the blueprint of life. DNA is found in all
kingdoms of life. Even most viruses have DNA. A molecule of DNA is chemically stable (it
does not have a 2-prime alcohol group.)
When someone says DNA, they may be referring to one's genetic material on multiple levels:
They may be speaking about a single deoxyribose nucleic acid molecule, a section of a double
helix, a section of a chromosome, or one's entire hereditary composition.
• antiparallel
• Double helix
• Semiconservative replication
• Sequence of nucleotides encodes functional RNA or polypeptide

17.2 Historical perspective
• Mitosis and meiosis
• Regular distribution of chromosomes suggested that they contain hereditary information
• Bridges/Morgan, using Drosophila melanogaster showed that genes are on chromosomes
(1910s)
• Hammerling: nucleus contains hereditary information (1930s)
• Griffith: transformation of bacteria (1928)
• Avery, MacLeod, McCarty: transforming substance is DNA (1944)
• Hershey, Chase: DNA is hereditary material of viruses (1952)
• Rosalind Franklin
• Watson and Crick: structure of DNA (1953)

17.3 Hershey-Chase Experiment
The Hershey and Chase experiment was one of the leading suggestions that DNA was a
genetic material. Hershey and Chase used phages, or viruses, to implant their own DNA
into a bacterium. They did two experiments marking either the DNA in the phage with
a radioactive phophorus or the protein of the phage with radioactive sulfur. With the
bacteria that was infected by the phages with radioactive DNA the DNA in the bacteria

69

DNA: The Genetic Material
was radioactive. In the bacteria that was infected with the radioactive protein the bacteria
was radioactive, not the DNA. This proves that DNA is a genetic material and it is passed
on in viruses.

17.4 DNA/RNA components
• Miescher: discovered DNA, 1869

17.4.1 Structure of DNA
DNA is in a double helix structure made up of nucleotides. The "backbone" of the double
helix is composed of phosphates connected to a five carbon sugar called deoxyribose, . The
"rungs" are composed of nitrogenous bases, Purines and Pyrimidines. Purines contain
Adenine(A) and Guanine(G) and have two rings in their structures. Pyrimidines contain
Cytosine(C) and Thymine (T) and have one ring in their structures.

20 Mutation
A mutation is a permanent change to an organism's genetic material (DNA1 or RNA).
Mutations are a rare but significant biological process, since they provide the variation on
which evolution2 acts and are also the source of cancer.
An organism's genetic material is made up of polymers (chains) of four different nucleotides3 ,
like a recipe book written in a language of only four letters. A mutation event is when the
order of the nucleotides in DNA change, usually when the DNA is being copied.
Mutations come in a number of forms:

20.1 Point Mutations
Point mutations are all mutations which involve a single nucleotide. These come in the form
of substitutions, insertions and deletions:

20.2 Substitution
Substitution Mutations: In substitution mutations, a nitrogenous base of a triplet codon of
DNA is replaced by another nitrogen base or some derivative of the nitrogen base, changing
the codon. The altered codon codes for a different amino acid substitution.The substitution
mutations are of two types:
1.Transitions: It is the replacement of one purine in a polynucleotide chain by another
purine(A by G or C by A) or one pyrimidine by another pyrimidine(T by C or C by T)
2.Transversions:A base pair substitution involving the substitution of a purine by pyrimidine
or pyrimidine by a purine is called transversion.

20.3 Larger mutations
Larger mutations which involve more than one nucleotide also include insertions and deletions,
but can also include inversions, rearrangement of nucleotides and duplication of entire genes:

20.3.2 Rearrangement
20.3.3 Gene/Exon Duplications
Transposition
Retrotransposition

20.4 Chromosomal mutations
Chromosomal mutations involve changes to entire chromosomes. These mutations are
particularly rare:

20.4.1 Translocation
20.4.2 Fusion
20.4.3 Fission
20.4.4 Segmental Duplication
20.4.5 Chromosomal Duplication
20.4.6 Genome Duplication

20.5 Causes of mutations
20.6 Effects of mutations
Mutations can have a variety of different effects depending on the type of mutation, the
significance of the piece of genetic material affected and whether the cells affected are germ-

82

Further reading
line cells. Only mutations in germ-line cells can be passed on to children, while mutations
elsewhere can cause cell-death or cancer.
Mutations can be classified by their effects:

20.6.1 Silent Mutation
Silent Mutations are DNA mutations that do not result in a change to the amino acid
sequence or a protein. They may occur in a non-coding region (outside of a gene or within
an intron), or they may occur within an exon in a manner that does not alter the final
amino acid chain.

20.6.2 Frameshift
20.6.3 Missense Mutation
Missense mutations are types of point mutations where a single nucleotide is changed to
cause substitution of a different amino acid. This in turn can render the resulting protein
nonfunctional. Such mutations are responsible for diseases such as Epidermolysis bullosa.

22 Classification of Living Things
22.0.1 Classification of Living Things & Naming
With so many flora and fauna on planet Earth, there must be a method to classify each
organism to distinguish it from others so it can be correctly identified. Classification does
not only apply to biology. For example, supermarkets and grocery stores organise their
products by classifying them. Beverages may occupy one aisle, while cleaning supplies may
occupy another. In science, the practice of classifying organisms is called taxonomy (Taxis
means arrangement and nomos means law). The modern taxonomic system was developed
by the Swedish botanist Carolus (Carl) Linneaeus (1707-1788). He used simple physical
characteristics of organisms to identify and differentiate between different species.
Linneaeus developed a hierarchy of groups for taxonomy. To distinguish different levels of
similarity, each classifying group, called taxon (pl. taxa) is subdivided into other groups.
To remember the order, it is helpful to use a mnemonic device. The taxa in hierarchical
order:
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•

Domain - Archea, Eubacteria, Eukaryote
Kingdom - Plants, Animals, Fungi, Protists, Eubacteria (Monera), Archaebacteria
Phylum
Class
Order
Family
Genus
Species

The domain is the broadest category, while species is the most specific category available.
The taxon Domain was only introduced in 1990 by Carl Woese, as scientists reorganise
things based on new discoveries and information. For example, the European Hare would
be classified as follows:
Eukaryote --> Animal --> Chordata --> Mammalia --> Lagomorpha --> Leporidae -->
Lepus --> Lepus europaeus.
Binomial nomenclature is used to name an organism, where the first word beginning
with a capital is the genus of the organism and the second word beginning with lower-case
letter is the species of the organism. The name must be in italics and in Latin, which was
the major language of arts and sciences in the 18th century. The scientific name can be also
abbreviated, where the genus is shortened to only its first letter followed by a period. In our
example, Lepus europaeus would become L. europaeus'.
Taxonomy and binomial nomenclature are both specific methods of classifying an organism.
They help to eliminate problems, such as mistaken identity and false assumptions, caused
by common names. An example of the former is the fact that a North American robin is

93

Classification of Living Things
quite different from the English robin. An example of the latter is the comparison between
crayfish and catfish, where one might believe that they both are fish when in fact, they are
quite different.
Nomenclature is concerned with the assignment of names to taxonomic groups in agreement
with published rules.

22.0.2 Eukaryotes & Prokaryotes
Recall that there are two basic types of cells: eukaryotes and prokaryotes.
Eukaryotes are more complex in structure, with nuclei and membrane-bound organelles.
Some characteristics of eukaryotes are:
•
•
•
•
•
•
•

Large (100 - 1000 μm)
DNA in nucleus, bounded by membrane
Genome consists of several chromosomes.
Sexual reproduction common, by mitosis and meiosis
Mitochondria and other organelles present
Most forms are multicellular
Aerobic

Prokaryotes refer to the smallest and simplest type of cells, without a true nucleus and no
membrane-bound organelles. Bacteria fall under this category. Some characteristics:
•
•
•
•
•
•
•

Small (1-10 μm)
DNA circular, unbounded
Genome consists of single chromosome.
Asexual reproduction common, not by mitosis or meiosis.
No general organelles
Most forms are singular
Anaerobic

22.0.3 The Three Domains
The three domains are organised based on the difference between eukaryotes and prokaryotes.
Today's living prokaryotes are extremely diverse and different from eukaryotes. This fact has
been proven by molecular biological studies (e.g. of RNA structure) with modern technology.
The three domains are as follows:
Archea (Archeabacteria) consists of archeabacteria, bacteria which live in extreme
environments. The kingdom Archaea belongs to this domain.
Eubacteria consists of more typical bacteria found in everyday life. The kingdom Eubacteria
belongs to this domain.
Eukaryote encompasses most of the world's visible living things. The kingdoms Protista,
Fungi, Plantae, and Animalia fall under this category.

94

Stem cells

22.0.4 The Six Kingdoms
Under the three domains are six kingdoms in taxonomy. The first two, Plants and Animals,
are commonly understood and will not be expounded here.
Protista, the third kingdom, was introduced by the German biologist Ernst Haeckel in
1866 to classify micro-organisms which are neither animals nor plants. Since protists are
quite irregular, this kingdom is the least understood and the genetic similarities between
organisms in this kingdom are largely unknown. For example, some protists can exhibit
properties of both animals and plants.
Fungi are organisms which obtain food by absorbing materials in their bodies. Mushrooms
and moulds belong in this kingdom. Originally, they were part of the plant kingdom but
were recategorised when they were discovered not to photosynthesise.
Eubacteria are bacteria, made up of small cells, which differ in appearance from the
organisms in the above kingdoms. They lack a nucleus and cell organelles. They have cell
walls made of peptidoglycan.
Archae (or Archaebacteria) are bacteria which live in extreme environments, such as
salt lakes or hot, acidic springs. These bacteria are in their own category as detailed studies
have shown that they have unique properties and features (ex. unusual lipids that are not
found in any other organism)which differ them from other bacteria and which allow them to
live where they live. Their cell walls lack peptidoglycan.

22.0.5 Origins of Diversity
The diversity in our planet is attributed to diversity within a species. As the world changed
in climate and in geography as time passed, the characteristics of species diverged so much
that new species were formed. This process, by which new species evolve, was first described
by British naturalist Charles Darwin as natural selection.
For an organism to change, genetic mutations must occur. At times, genetic mutations are
accidental, as in the case of prokaryotes when they undergo asexual reproduction. For most
eukaryotes, genetic mutations occur through sexual reproduction, where meiosis produces
haploid gametes from the original parent cells. The fusion of these haploid gametes into
a diploid zygote results in genetic variation in each generation. Over time, with enough
arrangement of genes and traits, new species are produced. Sexual reproduction creates an
immense potential of genetic variety.
One goal of taxonomy is to determine the evolutionary history of organisms. This can be
achieved by comparing species living today with species in the past. The comparison in
anatomy and structure is based on data from development, physical anatomy, biochemistry,
DNA, behaviour, and ecological preferences. The following are examples of how such data is
used:
• Anatomy:
Although a horse and a human may look different, there is evidence that their arm structures
are quite similar. Their arms' sizes and proportions may be different, but the anatomical
structures are quite similar. Such evidence reveals that animals in different taxa may not

95

Classification of Living Things
be that different. Biological features from a common evolutionary origin are known as
homologous.
• Development
• Biochemistry:
Biochemical analysis of animals similar in appearance have yielded surprising results. For
example, although guinea pigs were once considered to be rodents, like mice, biochemistry
led them to be in their taxon of their own.

22.0.6 Phylogeny, Cladistics & Cladogram
Modern taxonomy is based on many hypotheses' of the evolutionary history of organisms,
known as phylogeny. As with the Scientific Method, scientists develop a hypothesis on the
history of an animal and utilise modern science and technology to prove the phylogeny.
Cladistics is a classification system which is based on phylogeny. Expanding on phylogeny,
cladistics is based on the assumption that each group of related species has one common
ancestor and would therefore retain some ancestral characteristics. Moreover, as these
related species evolve and diverge from their common ancestor, they would develop unique
characteristics. Such characteristics are known as derived characteristics
The principles of phylogeny and cladistics can be expressed visually as a cladogram,
a branching diagram which acts as a family (phylogenetic) tree for similar species. A
cladogram can also be used to test alternative hypotheses for an animal's phylogeny. In
order to determine the most likely cladogram, the derived characteristics of similar species
are matched and analysed.

22.1 Introduction
Viruses are the smallest biological particle (the tiniest are only 20 nm in diameter). However,
they are not biological organisms so they are not classified in any kingdom of living things.
They do not have any organelles and cannot respire or perform metabolic functions. Viruses
are merely strands of DNA or RNA surrounded by a protective protein coat called a capsid.
Viruses only come to life when they have invaded a cell. Outside of a host cell, viruses are
completely inert.
Since first being identified in 1935, viruses have been classified into more than 160 major
groups. Viruses are classified based on their shape, replication properties, and the diseases
that they cause. Furthermore, the shape of a virus is determined by the type and arrangement
of proteins in its capsid. Viruses pathogenic to humans are currently classified into 21 groups.
Viruses can also attack bacteria and infect bacterial cells. Such viruses are called bacteriophages.

97

Classification of Living Things

22.2 Viral Replication
As previously stated, viruses are not a biological life form so they cannot reproduce by
themselves. They need to take over a functioning eukaryotic or prokaryotic cell to replicate
its DNA or RNA and to make protein coat for new virus particles.
In order to enter a cell, a virus must attach to a specific receptor site on the plasma membrane
of the host cell. The proteins on the surface of the virus act as keys which fit exactly into a
matching glycoprotein on the host cell membrane. In some viruses, the attachment protein
is not on the surface of the virus but is in the capsid or in the envelope.
There are two forms of viral replication: the lytic cycle and the lysogenic cycle.

22.2.1 Lytic Cycle
1. Attachment: The virus binds to specific receptors on the host cell.
2. Entry: There are two ways in which a virus can enter cells. Firstly, the virus can inject
its nucleic acid into the host cell. Secondly, if a virus is contained in an envelope, the
host cell can phagocytosise the entire virus particle into a vacuole. When the virus
breaks out of the vacuole, it then releases its nucleic acid into the cell.
3. Replication: The virus's nucleic acid instructs the host cell to replicate the virus's
DNA or RNA.
4. Assembly: New virus particles are assembled.
5. Lysis and Release: The virus directs the production of an enzyme which damages
the host cell wall, causing the host cell to swell and burst. The newly formed virus
particles are now released.

22.2.2 Lysogenic Cycle
1. Attachment: Similar to Lytic Cycle
2. Entry: Similar to Lytic Cycle
3. Incorporation: The viral nucleic acids is not replicated, but instead integrated by
genetic combination (crossing over) into the host cell's chromosome. When integrated
in a host cell this way, the viral nucleic acid as part of the host cell's chromosome is
known as a prophage.
4. Host Cell Reproduction: The host cell reproduces normally. Subsequent cell divisions,
daughter cells, contain original father cell's chromosome embedded with a prophage.
5. Cycle Induction: Certain factors now determine whether the daughter cell undergoes
the lytic or lysogenic cycle. At any time, a cell undergoing the lysogenic cycle can
switch to the lytic cycle.
The reproduction cycle of viruses with RNA and no DNA is slightly different. A notable
example of a RNA-based virus is HIV, a retrovirus.

98

Viral Genome
Retrovirus reproductive cycle
1. The retrovirus force RNA into cell, by either one of the two methods of entry (See
above).
2. In the retrovirus are reverse transcriptase enzymes, which catalyses the synthesis of a
DNA strand complementary to the viral RNA.
3. Reverse transcriptase catalyses a second DNA strand complementary to the first. With
these two strands, the double-stranded DNA can be created.
4. DNA is then incorporated into the host cell's chromosomes. Similar to the concept of
a prophage, this incorporated DNA is called a provirus. However, the provirus never
leaves the host cell, unlike a prophage.
5. The infected host cell undergoes the lytic or lysogenic cycle.

22.3 Viral Genome
The genome of a virus consists of DNA or RNA, whose size and configuration vary. The
entire genome can exist as a single nucleic acid molecule or several nucleic acid segments.
Also, the DNA or RNA may be single-stranded or double-stranded, and either linear or
circular.
Not all viruses can reproduce in a host cell by themselves. Since viruses are so small, the
size of their genome is limiting. For example, some viruses have coded instructions for only
making a few different proteins for the viruses' capsid. On the other hand, the human
genome codes for over 30,000 different proteins. Therefore, the lack of coded instructions
cause some viruses to need the presence of other viruses to help them reproduce themselves.
Such viruses are called replication defective.
Lastly, it is worthy to note that 70% of all viruses are RNA viruses. As the process of RNA
replication (with enzymes and other organelles of the host cell) is more prone to errors, RNA
viruses have much higher mutation rates than do DNA viruses.

22.4 Viruses Practice Questions
1. As the name implies, the Tomato Spotted Wilt Virus targets tomatoes. Would it be
possible for this virus to target other fruits as well? Explain.
2. If a DNA and a RNA virus both infected somatic cells, which virus would be more
difficult to detect?
3. Many people have had cold sores, which are caused by infection with the herpes
simplex virus. One characteristic of cold sores is that after a period of inactivity, they
will reappear many times during the course of a person's life. Which cycle would the
herpes simplex virus undergo?
4. Chicken pox is a common, non-fatal disease usually acquired in adolescence and caused
by the varicella zoster virus. In adulthood, many people suffer from shingles, an altered
form of the varicella zoster virus. Which cycle would the varicella zoster virus have
undergone?
5. Would an antibiotic work for a person suffering from a cold of flu? Explain.

Domains of life: characteristics

22.7 Domains of life: characteristics
This text is based on notes very generously donated by Paul Doerder, Ph.D., of the Cleveland
State University.

22.8 Introduction
Out of the six kingdoms, Protista is the most diverse. This is the kingdom of organisms
with strange, atypical characteristics. In essence, this kingdom is designated for organisms
which do not belong in any other kingdom. The majority of protists are microscopic.

22.9 Classification of Protists
There are three phyla of protists, based on their type of nutrition.
1. Protozoa (animal-like protists) are heterotrophs that ingest or absorb their food.
2. Algae (plant-like protists) are autotrophs they get nutrition from photosythesis.
3. Slime moulds and water moulds (fungus-like protists) are also heterotrophs, like
protozoa.

22.10 Protozoa
As heterotrophs, protozoa scavenge materials from their surroundings. Others are predators
which actively hunt or ambush small organisms such as bacteria and other protozoa for a
source of nutrition. Protozoa can be parasitic as well; they may live inside larger organisms,
like humans. Most protozoa live as single cells, although a few form colonies.
Protozoa are generally difficult to identify due to their varied shape. They may appear as
jelly-like blobs, spherical sunbursts, or a flattened leaf. Tiny blood parasites may be only 2
μm long. On the other hand, shell-covered marine may be 5 cm or more in diameter.
Furthermore, different protozoans have their own complex life cycles. The complexity has
led certain organisms to be mistakenly classified for other species.
Nevertheless, protozoa can move, and so, they are classified based on their methods of
locomotion.
Characteristics of Protozoa :
• About 30,000 species known
• About 10,000 species are pathogenic, including some of the worst human diseases
• heterotrophic
• highly variable in form and life cycle

101

Classification of Living Things
• mostly unicellular
• range in size from 0.005 mm to 50 mm
• lack cell walls
they love environment and each other..............

22.11 Algae
Algae are much simpler than protozoa. They are aquatic and contain chlorophyll. Algae can
exist as a single cell or as giant seaweeds 60 m in length. Formerly, algae were classified as
plants but this was incorrect as algae lack parts of true plants: leaves, stems, roots, xylem,
and phloem. Since algae belong in the kingdom Protista, algae is a broad term used to
denote all aquatic eukaryotes which photosynthesise; algae can differ in size and shape as
well.
There are six phyla of algae:chlorophytes (green algae), phaeophytes (brown algae),
rhodophytes (red algae), chrysophytes (diatoms), pyrrophytes (dinoflagellates),
and euglenophytes (euglenoids).

22.11.1 Chlorophytes
Chlorophytes resemble plants the most. Like plants, their cell walls contain cellulose and
they store food in reserve as starch. Chlorophytes can be unicellular or multicellular. Most
chlorophytes use flagellae for some locomotion.

22.11.2 Phaeophytes
Phaeophytes are nearly all multicellular marine organisms, which are known to us as seaweeds.
They have cell walls composed of cellulose and alginic acid (a substance similar to pectin).
The cellulose and alignic acid help to retain water and prevent seawood from drying out
when exposed to air at low tide.
Since phaeophytes live in a tidal environment, they have large, flat fronds (a large leaf)
which can withstand pounding by waves. Their bases strongly anchor the algae to the rocky
seabed and prevent them from being washed out to sea. Phaeophytes are usually found in
areas of cold water.

22.11.3 Rhodophytes
Rhodophytes are typically found in warmer seawater, and are more delicate and smaller
than brown algae (phaeophytes). Rhodophytes are also able to grow at deeper depths in
the ocean, since red algae absorb green, violet, and blue light, the wavelengths of which
penetrate the deepest below the water surface. They also have mucilaginous material to
resist drying.

102

Slime molds & Water molds

22.11.4 Chryosophytes
Chryosophytes are the most abundant unicellular algae in the oceans. They are also one
of the biggest components of plankton, a free-floating collection of microorganisms, eggs,
and larvae. As photosynthetic organisms, they produce a significant amount of atmospheric
oxygen.
The reproduction cycle of chryosophytes is particularly interesting. Note that diatoms
reproduce both asexually and sexually. Since diatoms have a rigid cell wall with an outer
layer of silica (found in sand and glass), the daughter cells produced by mitosis must fit
inside the original cell wall. Therefore, each generation of diatoms is smaller than the one
before. The reduction in size continues until the diatoms produce sexually, producing a
zygote which eventually grows to the original size as it matures.

22.11.5 Pyrrophytes
Pyrrophytes are unicellular, photosynthetic, and mostly aquatic. They have protective coats
composed of stiff cellulose. They are more easily identifiable, due to the presence of two
flagellae. The longer flagellae propels the dinoflagellate, while the second shorter, flatter
flagellae functions as a rudder.
Some species of pyrrophytes are zooxanthellae. Since they lack cellulose plates, they make
their home in coral reefs and animals, such as sea anemones, and molluscs. In returning
the favour of sheltering them, dinoflagellates provide carbohydrates to their host through
photosynthesis. This is why there are nutrient-rich coral reefs in malnutritions water.
A negative aspect of pyrrophytes is that under certain conditions, species of dinoflagellates
reproduce rapidly to form a harmful algal bloom (HAB), known as a red tide if dinoflagellates are the cause. Such pyrrophytes can produce toxins which may injure or kill wildlife,
and additionally any consumers of contaminated wildlife.

22.11.6 Euglenophytes
Like pyrrophytes, euglenophytes are small unicellular freshwater organisms with two flagella.
They are mainly autotrophic or heterotrophic, depending if they have a red, light-sensitive
structure called an eyespot.

22.12 Slime molds & Water molds
There are two phyla of slime moulds and one phylum of water moulds.

22.12.1 Oomycotes (Water moulds)
Oomycotes are filamentous organisms which resemble fungi, in that they live as saprotrophs.
Oomycotes differ from other moulds with the presence of spores and their sexual life cycle.

103

Classification of Living Things

22.12.2 Myxomycotes (Plasmodial slime moulds)
Myxomycoties are visible to the naked eye as tiny slug-like organisms which creep over decayed
and dead matter. This streaming blob containing many nuclei is called a plasmodium.

22.12.3 Acrasiomycotes (Cellular slime moulds) and its reproductive
cycle
Acrasiomycotes exist as individual amoeboid cells with one nucleus each. When in unfavourable conditions, each acrasiomycete cell gathers together to form a pseudoplasmodium.
Reproductive Cycle:
1. One acrasiomycete cell joins with others to form a pseudoplasmodium.
2. The pseudoplasmodium shrinks and forms a smaller plasmodium.
3. The plasmodium migrates to a suitable environment.
4. The plasmodium develops a sporangia, where original parental nuclei has divided by
meiosis into haploid spores to be germinated.
5. When favourable conditions arise, the spores germinate and are carried away by animals
or the wind.
6. Cycle repeats.

23.23 Introduction
Although you may not recognise fungi, they are just as prevalent as plants and animals.
Their spores are in the air which we breathe, fungi allow us to make bread, and mushrooms
(a type of fungi) are eaten by us. A few types of fungi are unicellular. For example, yeasts live
as individual oval or cylindrical cells. However, the majority of fungi live are multicellular.
Their bodies are composed of hyphae, a network of fine filaments. In a mushroom, the

111

Multicellular Photosynthetic Autotrophs
hyphae are densely packed so it is difficult to see the individual structures when a mushroom
is eaten. However, a mushroom is only a specialised reproductive part of the whole fungus.
The main part of the fungi is underground in a whole web of hyphae, called a mycelium.
In the mycelium, each fungal cell is separated from each other by a septum. Each fungal
cell may have one or more nuclei and remains connected to the mycelium because the septa
are porous, allowing cytoplasm to flow through the hyphae and fungal cell walls, made of a
hard material called chitin. Some fungi do not have septa, and they appear to be large,
branching, multinucleate cells.

23.24 Nutrition
Fungi are saprophytes. When they find a source of food (e.g. dead wood, orange peel) ,
they decompose it and digest it. The enzymes break down larger organic molecules in the
substrate into smaller molecules. These smaller molecules diffuse into the fungus, where
they are used to allow growth and repair.
Fungi which feed on living cells are parasitic. For example, athlete's foot grows on the
human foot. These kinds of fungi produce hyphae called haustoria, which can penetrate
host cells without immediately killing them.
However, they are friendlier species of fungi. Many fungi live symbiotically with plants or
animals. For example, most trees have fungi living in close contact with their roots. In this
relationship, known as a mycorrhiza, there are many benefits:
• Growing around the plant roots and often entering plant cells, the hyphae absorb minerals
from the soil and release them in the roots. The fungi gets its source of food (organic
nutrients) while delivering food to the plant.
• The mycelium here would increase the surface area, thus the absorptive surface, of the
plant roots.
• The fungal cells help to maintain air and water flow in the soil around the roots.
• The fungi may prevent other potentially pathogenic fungi to attack the tree.

23.25 Fungal Reproduction
Fungi can reproduce in two ways. Firstly, they make asexually produce through fragmentation. This occurs when pieces of hyphae are broken off, which then grow into new
mycelia.
The second method is by spores. Spores are lightweight structures and windblown designed
to be transported over long distances and by many mediums, such as on the bodies of insects
and birds. They are additionally light enough to be blown away for hundreds of kilometers.
Spores may be asexual and sexual. Their sexual properties can be analysed to classify the
four phylla of fungi.

112

Types of Fungi

23.26 Types of Fungi
23.26.1 Zygospore Fungi (Zygomycetes)
This phyllum includes bread moulds and other saprotrophs. Comparable to bacteria, this
phyllum prefers asexual reproduction over sexual reproduction.
1. Two haploid hyphae of opposite types, also known as mating strain + and mating
strain -, combine and fuse together.
2. Plasmogamy, the union of the two parent hyphae, occurs and results in the creation
of a heterokaryotic (n + n) zygosporangium or zygospore. Note that the zygospore is
NOT diploid yet; the haploid nuclei are simply clumped together.
3. Immediately, a thick wall develops around the zygospore to protect it from drying and
other hazards. The zygospore becomes dormant.
4. When conditions are favourable, the zygospore absorbs water and undergoes karyogamy
(n + n = 2n), where the haploid nuclei contributed by the two parents fuse to produce
diploid zygosporangia.
5. The now diploid zygosporangium then undergoes meiosis to form haploid sporangia.
6. Through asexual reproduction of fungi (See above for more information), the spores from
the sporangia germinate and grow into new mycelia.
7. Back to step #1.

23.26.2 Club Fungi (Basidiomycetes)
This phyllum increases mushrooms and shelf fungi. In many ways, the reproduction stages
of this phyllum is similar to that of zygomycetes.
1. Two haploid hyphae of opposite types, also known as mating strain + and mating
strain -, combine and fuse together.
2. Plasmogamy takes place, and a dikaryotic mycelium forms. The dikaryotic mycelium
grows faster then the haploid parental mycelia.
3. Environmental factors cause the dikaryotic mycelium to form compact masses which develop into basidiocarps, short-lived reproductive structures. An example is the mushroom.
4. The basidiocarp gills are lined with terminal dikaryotic cells called basidia, which then
undergo karyogamy.
5. The basidia are now diploid. They undergo meiosis to develop haploid basidiospores, a
term referring to a basidiomycete's spores.
6. Still remaining on the basidiocarp, the haploid basidiospores eject, fall from the basidiocarp,
and are dispersed by the wind when mature.
7. In a favourable environment, the basidiospores germinate and grow into short-lived
haploid mycelia.

23.27 Key Terms
synapomorphy

23.28 Introduction
What makes an animal an animal?
If animals are a monophyletic taxon, then animals should be able to be defined by synapomorphies, (shared, derived characteristics). Ideally, we would NOT define this or any taxon using
symplesiomorphies (shared ancestral or primitive characteristics) or homoplastic characters
(the independent evolution of similarity, or "convergent evolution"). See pages 654 - 656 and
Fig. 32.6 in your text to review these concepts. As you consider the characteristics listed
below, ask yourself whether or not each is a synapomorphy.

23.29 Characteristics of an Animal
• There is no one universally accepted definition of an animal. The following treatment
follows your text, beginning on page 876.
• Animals:
• Are multicellular, heterotrophic eukaryotes . . .
• Lack the distinctive cell walls of plants & fungi
• Share unique characteristics . . .
• Share certain reproductive characteristics . . .
• Other commonly used definitions . . .
Animals are multicellular heterotrophic eukaryotes
• Unfortunately, none of these traits is exclusive to animals:
• Plants, fungi, and some algae are multicellular.
• Many bacteria, protists, and all fungi are heterotrophic.
• Everything other than bacteria and archaea are eukaryotic.
• Moreover, all three of these characteristics also apply to fungi.
• However, there is a difference here between animals and fungi. Animals generally
take in their food through ingestion, or eating and swallowing something. Fungi are
absorptive heterotrophs; they secrete their digestive enzymes onto their food, and then
absorb the resulting nutrients.
Animals share unique characteristics
• Only animals have muscle tissue and nervous tissue.
• Only animals have collagen, a structural protein
• Only animals have the following types of intercellular junctions: (See pages 135 - 139,
Figure 7.15 in your text for more information on these junctions.)

114

Characteristics of an Animal
• Tight junctions (sealing function)
• Desmosomes (anchoring function)
• Gap junctions (communication function)
Animals share certain reproductive characteristics
• Most animals reproduce sexually, with the diploid stage dominating.
• In most animals, a small, haploid, flagellated, motile sperm fertilizes a larger, haploid,
nonmotile egg to form a diploid zygote.
• Mitotic division of the zygote yields a blastula stage, followed by a gastrula stage. A
synapomorphy? This feature could be another "unique characteristic" shared by animals.
• Development may be direct to adult form, or there may be a sexually immature stage
(or stages) that are morphologically & ecologically distinct from the adult called a larva
(plural: larvae).
Other commonly used definitions or characterizations
• It is surprisingly difficult to find two texts that agree on a precise definition of an animal.
Here are a few perspectives from some other texts.
• Animals are multicellular eukaryotes; they are chemosynthetic heterotrophs that ingest
their food.
• Animals are motile, though many are secondarily sessile. Gametes usually are produced
in multicellular sex organs, and the zygote passes through embryonic stages that include
a blastula.
• Animals are organisms that are multicellular, with more than one type of cell. They
are heterotrophic. They reproduce sexually (at least sometimes), with a zygote formed
from two different haploid gametes. They go through a developmental stage called a
blastula.
• Animals are not photosynthetic, have no cell wall, and no hyphae or mycelia. (What
would a cladist think of this definition of the taxon Animalia?)
What kinds of animals are there?
• Kingdom Animalia generally is recognized to have approximately 30 phyla ...
• There is relatively little dispute over the number of phyla recognized; however, the
phylogenetic relationships among the phyla are hotly debated.
• Molecular techniques for assess similarity based on nucleotide sequences in nucleic
acids are providing valuable new perspectives on this question.
• Remember that two animals in different phyla generally are considered to be more different
from each other than are animals within one phylum (e.g., nematodes are more different
from annelids than humans are from sharks).

Figure 6

Sponges

Name means "pore-bearing".
This phylum consists of the sponges. The number of species is estimated to be between
5,000 and 10,000. All are aquatic and almost all are marine.
Animals in this phyla have no true tissues, which means, for example, that they have no
nervous system or sense organs. Although sponges are multicellular, they are described as
being essentially at a cellular level of organization. They are sessile as adults, but have a
free swimming larva.
Their bodies are porous. They are filter feeders; water flows in through many small openings,
and out through fewer, large openings. They have inner and outer cell layers, and a variable
middle layer. The middle layer often is gelatinous with spiny skeletal elements (called
spicules) of silica or calcium carbonate, and fibres made of spongin (a form of collagen).

117

Multicellular Photosynthetic Autotrophs
Choanocytes are flagellated cells lining the inside of the body that generate a current, and
trap and phagocytize food particles.
Their cells remain totipotent, or developmentally flexible: they can become any type of
cell at any point in the sponge's development. This allows for the great regenerative power
sponges have.
Sponges are an ancient group, with fossils from the early Cambrian (ca. 540 mya) and
possibly from the Precambrian. Sponges often are abundant in reef ecosystems. They
somehow are protected from predators (spicules? bad taste?).
Many organisms are commensals of sponges, living inside them. Some sponges harbor
endosymbiotic cyanobacteria or algae (dinoflagellates, a.k.a. "zooxanthellae").

23.32 Phylum Cnidaria
See text pages 886 - 889.
Name comes from the Greek knide- meaning "nettle".
This phylum They have one opening, which serves as both mouth and anus. The body wall
has an outer ectoderm, an inner endoderm, and a variable undifferentiated middle layer
called mesoglea or mesenchyme that may be jelly-like. The mesoglea is NOT considered
to be true mesoderm and so the Cnidaria are described as diploblastic. Tentacles usually
extend from the body wall around the mouth/anus.

118

Phylum Cnidaria

Figure 7

Jellyfish Development

There are two basic body plans: the polyp14 and the medusa15 . The polyp is sessile and
attaches to substrate by the aboral end (i.e., the end away from the mouth). The medusa
("jellyfish") is a floating form, and looks like an upside-down version of the polyp. Some
cnidarians only have the polyp stage, some have only the medusa stage, and others have
both.

15

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/polyp
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medusa%20%28biology%29

119

Multicellular Photosynthetic Autotrophs
The typical life cycle of a cnidarian involves what is called "alternation of generations": an
alternation between an asexual polyp stage and a sexual medusa stage.
The tentacles are armed with cnidae (or nematocysts), small intracellular "harpoons" that
function in defense and prey capture. When fired, the cnidae deliver a powerful toxin that
in some cases is dangerous to humans. The phylum is named after the cnidae.
Cnidarians have no head, no centralized nervous system, and no specialized organs for gas
exchange, excretion, or circulation. They do have a "nerve net."
Many cnidarians have intracellular algae living within them in a mutualistic symbiotic
relationship (Dinoflagellates = zooxanthellae). This combination is responsible for much of
the primary productivity of coral reefs.
There are three main classes in the phylum
• Class Hydrozoa16 (hydras and Portugese man-of-war are well-known but atypical examples
of this Class)
• Class Scyphozoa17 (jellyfish)
• The medusa stage is dominant and the polyp stage often is reduced.
• Class Anthozoa18 (sea anemones, most corals)
• No medusa (jellyfish) stage, so sexual reproduction occurs in the polyp stage in this
group. The polyps also can reproduce asexually, which is how individual "corals" grow.

23.33 Phylum Platyhelminthes
See text pages 890 - 893.
Name means "flat worm"
Most members of this phylum are parasitic (flukes and tapeworms), but some are free living
(e.g., planaria). There are about 20,000 species.
They are dorsoventrally compressed (i.e., "flat").
Animals in this phylum are acoelomate, triploblastic, bilaterally symmetrical, and unsegmented. Platyhelminths have a simple anterior "brain" and a simple ladder-like nervous
system. Their gut has only one opening. Flatworms have NO circulatory or gas exchange
systems. They do have simple excretory/osmoregulatory structures (protonephridia or "flame
cells").
Platyhelminths are hermaphroditic, and the parasitic species often have VERY complex
reproductive (life) cycles.
There are four main classes of platyhelminths:
• Class Turbellaria19 (mostly free living flatworms, e.g., planaria)

Phylum Rotifera
• Class Monogenea20 (parasitic flukes)
• Class Trematoda21 (parasitic flukes, e.g., liver fluke and the human blood fluke, Schistosoma)
• Class Cestoda22 (tapeworms)
• Cestodes are endoparasitic in the gut of vertebrates. They do not have a mouth or
digestive system.

23.34 Phylum Rotifera
See text page 900
The Rotifers. The name means "wheel bearing," a reference to the corona, a feeding structure
(see below).
They are triploblastic, bilaterally symmetrical, and unsegmented. They are considered
pseudocoelomates.
Most less than 2 mm, some as large as 2 - 3 mm.
Rotifers have a three part body: head, trunk foot. The head has a ciliary organ called the
corona that, when beating, looks like wheels turning, hence the name of the phylum. The
corona is a feeding structure that surrounds the animal's jaws. The gut is complete (i.e.,
mouth & anus), and regionally specialized. They have protonephridia but no specialized
circulatory or gas-exchange structures.
Most live in fresh water, a very few are marine or live in damp terrestrial habitats. They
typically are very abundant. There are about 2,000 species.
Parthenogenesis, where females produce more females from unfertilized but diploid eggs, is
common. Males may be absent (as in bdelloid rotifers) or reduced. When males are present,
sexual and asexual life cycles alternate. Males develop from unfertilized haploid eggs and
are haploid. Males produce sperm by mitosis which can fertilize haploid eggs, yielding a
diploid zygote that develops into a diploid female. Sexual reproduction occurs primarily
when living conditions are unfavorable.
Most structures in rotifers are syncytial ("a mulitnucleate mass of protoplasm not divided into
separate cells," or "a multinucleated cell") and show eutely (here, "constant or near-constant
number of nuclei").

23.35 Phylum Nematoda
See text pages 894 - 895.
Name from the Greek for "thread".

Multicellular Photosynthetic Autotrophs
This phylum consists of the round worms. There are about 12,000 named species but the
true number probably is 10 - 100 times this!
These animals are triploblastic, bilaterally symmetrical, unsegmented pseudocoelomates.
They are vermiform, or wormlike.
In cross-section, they are round, and covered by a layered cuticle (remember this cuticle !!).
Probably due to this cuticle, juveniles in this phylum grow by molting. The gut is complete.
They have a unique excretory system but they lack special circulatory or gas-exchange
structures. The body has only longitudinal muscle fibers. The sexes are separate.
Nematodes can be incredibly common, widespread, and of great medical and economic
importance. They are parasites of humans and our crops. They can live pretty much
anywhere.
In one rotting apple, there can be up to 90,000 nematodes, and in one tablespoon of coastal
mud, there can be 236 species of nematodes!
Nematodes can be free living or important parasites of our crops, or of humans and other
animals. They have become very important in development studies, especially the species
Caenorhabditis elegans, presumably due to its small size and constancy of cell number
(eutely - 959 cells in C. elegans).

23.36 Phylum Annelida
See text pages 906 - 909.
Name means "ringed", from the Greek annulatus.
This phylum consists of earthworms, leeches, and various marine worms given many different
names (e.g., sand worms, tube worms). There are about 12,000 - 15,000 species.
Animals in this phylum are triploblastic, bilaterally symmetrical, segmented coelomates.
Development is typically protostomous. They have a complete circulatory system, and
a well-developed nervous system. Typically, each segment has paired epidermal "bristles"
(setae or chaetae).
Most are marine but they are successful occupants of almost anywhere sufficient water is
available. They can be free living, parasitic, mutualistic, or commensalistic.
Major advances of this phylum include the true coelom, segmentation, both longitundinal
and circular muscles, a closed circulatory system and, for most, a more advanced excretory
system (metanephridia).
There are three main classes of Annelids
• Class Oligochaeta (earthworms)
• Class Polychaeta (marine worms)
• Class Hirudinea (leeches)

122

Phylum Arthropoda

23.37 Phylum Arthropoda

Figure 8

Arthropods

Name means "jointed feet".
This phylum consists of spiders, ticks, mites, insects, lobsters, crabs, and shrimp, and is the
largest of all the phyla. So far, over 1 million species have been named, and it is likely that
the true number out there is 10 - 100 times greater.
This phylum also includes the extinct trilobites, which were prevalent in the Paleozoic era.
Because of their exoskeletons, these animals fossilized well and over 4000 species have been
named.
These animals are triploblastic, bilaterally symmetrical, segmented, protostome coelomates.
The coelom is generally reduced to portions of the reproductive and excretory systems. They
have an open circulatory system.
The most notable advancement of this phylum is a rigid exoskeleton. It has major implications
in these organisms' locomotion, flexibility, circulatory systems, gas exchange systems, and
growth. It also was partially responsible for the ability of the arthropods to move on to land.
There are several major groupings of arthropods:
Major subgroups include:
• The chelicerates (eurytperids, horseshoe crabs, scorpions, spiders, ticks) have clawlike
feeding appendages. They lack antennae and usually have simple eyes.
• The Trilobites...they get their own grouping

123

Multicellular Photosynthetic Autotrophs
• The uniramians (centipedes, millipedes, insects) have one pair of antennae and unbranched (uniramous) appendages.
• The crustaceans (crabs, shrimp, lobsters, barnacles and many others) have two pairs of
antennae and branched (biramous) appendages.

23.38 Phylum Mollusca
See text pages 900 - 905.
Name means "soft".
This phylum consists of snails, slugs, bivalves, chitons, squids, octopus, and many others.
About 110,000 species
All molluscs have a similar body plan:
• A muscular foot, usually used for movement.
• A visceral mass, containing most of the internal organs.
• A mantle, a fold of tissue that drapes over the visceral mass and secretes the shell, if
present.
• Most have a radula, or a rasping organ to scrape food.
Molluscs are bilaterally symmetrical, or secondarily asymmetrical. They are coelomates, but
the coelom generally has been greatly reduced; the main body cavity is a hemocoel. Development is typically protostomous. The gut is complete with marked regional specialization.
Large, complex, metanephridia (excretion).
Many molluscan life cycles include a trochophore larva. This stage also is characteristic of
annelids.

23.39 Phylum Echinodermata
Name means "spiny skin"
This phylum consists of sea stars, brittle stars, sea urchins, and sea cucumbers.

124

Phylum Chordata
Echinoderms are mostly sessile or very slow moving animals.
As adults, they are radially symmetrical, but in the larval stage, they are bilaterally
symmetrical. They are considered deuterostomes.
Echinoderms are unique in that they have a water vascular system composed of a system
of fluid-filled canals. These canals branch into the tube feet, which function in feeding,
locomotion, and gas exchange.
There are six major classes of echinoderms:

23.40 Phylum Chordata
Name means "the chordates", i.e., these animals have a notochord at some stage in their
lifecycle.
This phylum consists of tunicates, lancelets, and the vertebrates.
There are four major features that characterize the phylum Chordata.
• A notochord, or a longitudinal, flexible rod between the digestive tube and the nerve
cord. In most vertebrates, it is replaced developmentally by the vertebral column. This
is the structure for which the phylum is named.
• A dorsal hollow nerve cord which develops from a plate of ectoderm that rolls into a tube
located dorsal to the notochord. Other animal phyla have solid nerve cords ventrally
located. A chordate nerve cord splits into the central nervous system: the brain and
spinal cord.
• Pharyngeal slits, which allow water that enters through the mouth to exit without
continuing through the entire digestive tract. In many of the invertebrate chordates,
these function as suspension feeding devices; in vertebrates, they have been modified for
gas exchange, jaw support, hearing, and other functions.
• A muscular, postanal tail which extends posterior to the anus. The digestive tract of
most nonchordates extends the length of the body. In chordates, the tail has skeletal
elements and musculature, and can provide most of the propulsion in aquatic species.
Chordates have a segmented body plan, at least in development. This segmentation evolved
independently from the segmentation of annelids.
Three subphyla make up the phylum Chordata:
• Subphylum Urochordata (tunicates): the adults are enclosed in a tunic made of a carbohydrate much like cellulose. They squirt water out of an excurrent siphon. Urochordates
are characterized by errant (mobile and active) larvae and sessile adults. All are filter
feeders. The only "chordate" characteristics retained in adult life are the pharyngeal slits.

125

Multicellular Photosynthetic Autotrophs
Larval urochordates look more like adult cephlochordates & adult vertebrates than adult
urochordates.
• Subphylum Cephalochordata: Cephalochordates are known as lancelets because of their
blade-like shape; they are also known as amphioxus. They are marine animals and usually
live on the bottom, but can swim.
• Subphylum Vertebrata (vertebrates) ...
Formally, the phyla Urochordata and Cephalochordata are considered invertebrates.

23.40.1 Subphylum Vertebrata
Vertebrata refers to the presence of vertebrae and a vertebral column.
This subphylum includes most of the animals with which most people are familiar.
Vertebrates show extreme cephalization.
The notochord generally is replaced by the cranium & vertebral column in adults.
Neural Crest Cells
Later in development, these give rise to many cells of the body, including some cartilage
cells, pigment cells, neurons & glial cells of the peripheral nervous systems, much of the
cranium, and some of the cells of the endocrine system.
Some scientists would like to classify the neural crest as the fourth germ layer.
Neural crest cells come from the dorsal edge of the neural plate, thus ectoderm.

126

24 Chordates
The phylum Chordata includes three subphyla. These include vertebrates and invertebrate
chordates.

24.1 Characteristics
Notochord: the rod-shaped supporting axis found in the dorsal part of the embryos of all
chordates, including vertebrates
Flexible, non-collapsible rod dorsal to the gut/coelom and below the nervous system,
hydrostatic, fluid wrapped in tough connective tissue. As bone does not compact, muscles
tensed on one side result in movement instead of shortening the animal. This allows much
better locomotion than do cilia for larger animals in water, a crucial victory for later success.
Pharyngeal slits: Slits in the pharynx originally used to gather food, water enters the mouth,
passes through pharynx and out gill-like slits, passing through a cavity called an antrium
and then outside. In humans, present only in embryo.
Dorsal nerve cord: A neural tube dorsal to the notochord
Postanal tail: Elongation of the body and notochord, nerve cord and muscles past anus into
tail, early locomotive function led to success.
Non-synapomorphic characteristics (not limited to chordates):
• bisymmetrical (bilateral symmetry)
• segmented muscles and bones

24.2 Subphylum Urochordata
The tunicates are located in this subphylum. Along with the subphylum Cephalochordata,
these two subphyla make up the invertebrate chordates. Only the tunicate larvae have
notochords, nerve cords, and postanal tails. Most adult tunicates are sessile, filter-feeders
which retain their pharyngeal slits. Adult tunicates also develop a sac, called a tunic,
which gives tunicates their name. Cilia beating within the turnicate cause water to enter
the incurrent siphon. The water enters the body, passes through the pharyngeal slits,
and leaves the body through the excurrent siphon. Undigested food is removed through
the anus. Tunicates are hemaphrodites and can reproduce asexually through budding.In
urochordates notochord is confined to larval tail.These lack cranium. These have an open
type of circulatory system.Excretion is by neural gland,nephrocytes.

127

Chordates

24.3 Subphylum Cephalochordata
The lancelets are located in this subphylum. Along with the subphylum Urochordata, these
two subphyla make up the invertebrate chordates. Lancelets receive their name from their
bladelike shape. They resemble fish but they are actually scaleless chordates only a few
centimeters long. They spend most of their time buried in the sand with their mouths
protruding. Fossils of lancelets have been found to be over 550 million years old.
Dropped out sessile stage, what was the larval stage is now sexually reproductive. Includes
Branchiostoma (“amphioxus”).

24.4 Subphylum Vertebrata
(Vertebra from Latin vertere, to turn). Characterized by separate bones or cartilage blocks
firmly joined as a backbone. The backbone supports and protects a dorsal nerve cord.
Vertebrates have tissues which are organized into organs which in turn are organized into
organ systems.
All vertebrates share the following characteristics: - segmentation - a true coelom - bilateral
symmetry - cephalization - a backbone - a bony skull - a closed circulatory system - chambered
heart - two pairs of jointed appendages - tissues organized into organs
Vertebrate Organ Systems: - Nervous System - Circulatory System - Digestive System Respiratory System - Reproductive System - Excretory System
• Vertebral column: Not present in higher vertebrate adults. (In humans, the gel-like,
spongy core of the vertebral column is the only remainder. Ruptured or herniated disc is
an injury to this.)
• Cranium: Composite structure of bone/cartilage. Two functions: 1. Supports sensory
organs of head and 2. Encloses or partially encloses the brain.
What evolutionary relationship could we imagine between sessile echinoderms and the higher
chordate animals?
Paedomorphic (child-form) hypothesis: basically, evolution of sexual reproduction in what
had previously been a larval life stage, or the retention of at least one juvenile characteristic
into the adult (adult = sexually reproducing) stage. Some scientists believe that this occurred
in a proto-chordate animal lineage. Maybe chordates (and vertebrates) arose from sessile
(attached) ancestors. Selection in these proto-chordates maybe began to favor more time in
the larval stage, as feeding was more successful or mortality lower in this stage. As larvae
got bigger physics shows that the cilia become less efficient for locomotion, favoring the
undulating motion allowed by a notochord.
Is this hypothesis crazy? A similar example of this today is Epemeroptera, the mayfly, which
has almost abandoned its adult stage. Its one-year lifespan is mostly larval with just a brief
day of reproduce-and-die as an adult, which doesn’t even have usable mouthparts.
Tunicate (sea squirt) larva has all four chordate characteristics, although adult sessile
(“attached”).

Subphylum Vertebrata

24.4.1 Class Agnatha
"jawless fish"
• Ostracoderms: extinct Agnathans which had primitive fins and massive plates of bony
tissue on their body.
• Cyclostomes: "circle mouth" - a group of Agnathans which is still alive in the form of
lampreys and hagfish.
Appeared approximately 500 million years ago and dominated the oceans for about 100
million years. The first group of fish to appear. They had neither jaws, paired fins, nor
scales, but they were the first organisms with a backbone.
Class Acanthodia
"spiny fish" Appeared about 430 million years ago. An extinct class of fish that developed
jaws with bony edges. They had internal skeletons made of cartilage and some bone.
Class Placodermi
Appeared about 410 million years ago, dominated the sea for about 50 million years. An
extinct class of fish with massive heads.

24.4.2 Class Chondrichthyes
"cartilaginous fish" Appeared about 400 million years ago with bony fish. Includes sharks,
skates and rays, and chimaeras. Their skeletons are made of cartilage strengthened by the
mineral calcium carbonate.
The main characteristics and distinguishing features of this class: - gills - single-loop blood
circulation - vertebral column - presence of placoid scales on their bodies - internal skeleton
of cartilage - paired, fleshy pectoral and pelvic fins - asymmetrical tail fin prevents sinking fatty liver provides neutral buoyancy - visceral clefts present as separate and distinct gills no external ear - oviparous - internal fertilization - ectoderms - cold blooded

24.4.3 Class Osteichthyes
"bony fish" Appeared about 400 million years ago with cartilaginous fish. Includes about
95% of today's fish species.
Subclass Sarcopterygii
fleshy-finned fishes. Fins have bones and muscles, homologous to our limbs.
Order Dipnoi
lung fishes, two groups isolated when continents separated

129

Chordates
Order Crossopterygii
includes coelacanths and rhipodistians, gave rise to amphibians, had lungs which evolved
into a swim bladder in bony fishes, and labyrinthodont teeth, characterized by complex
folding of enamel.
• Skeleton made of bone, jaws, fins, most with scales, two-chambered heart.

24.4.4 Class Amphibia
means “both lives”, aquatic larvae, terrestrial adult Amphibians: - Legs - Lungs - DoubleLoop Circulation - Partially Divided Heart - Cutaneous Respiration (Breathes through
Skin)
Order Salientia
frogs (jumping) (aka Anura)
Order Urodela
salamanders (tailed)
Labyrinthodont amphibians: oldest known amphibians, inherited characteristic teeth from
crossopterygii ancestor, had stocky, aquatic larvae.
Amphibians have limbs instead of fins. Girdles and vertebral column now more substantial
and connected, support body on legs.
Lisamphybia: no scales, “smooth”, eggs with no shell, laid in water (water-reliant).
Amphibians gave rise to cotylosaurs, from which arose dinosaurs, turtles, lizards, and
therapsids.
Class Reptilia
amniotic egg allowed freedom from water, shelled egg. (Amnion: protection). Reptiles have
four extra-embryonic membranes:
•
•
•
•

Amnion: supports aquatic environment inside egg in fluid sac.
Allantois: allows gas exchange and elimination of wastes.
Chorion: gas exchange
Yolk sac: only one of the four left over from amphibian ancestor

Reptiles cold-blooded, or ectothermic, meaning that their heat come from their environment.
Sometimes defined as all amniotes that are not birds or mammals.
Reptiles can be classified by skull structure into four groups:
•
•
•
•

Anapsid
Synapsid
Diapsid
Euryasid

130

Subphylum Vertebrata
Refers to number of holes in the skull. Cotylosaurs had Anapsid skull
Dermatocranium: from bony outer skull structure, precursor to human cranium.
Subclass Anapsidia

Subclass Testudinata
turtles1 , terrapins
Subclass Diapsida
dinosaurs2 , snakes3 , most stuff
Subclass Synapsida

Order Therapsids

Subclass Diapsida
includes Ichthyosaurs, marine reptiles convergent on dolphins; Plesiosaurs, ancient sea
monsters; Squamates, including lizards and snakes; and Thecodonts, which gave rise to
• birds
• dinosaurs
• crocodilians
Dinosaurs: broken into two groups, based on hip structure
• Saurischia: lizard hips (gave rise to birds [!]), ancestrally bipedal
• Ornithischian: bird hips, ancestrally quadripedal
Crocodilians: come from archosaurs, the only extant (still living today) archosaur descendant.
Ancestrally bipedal, secondarily quadripedal.
Synapsids: refers to joined (Greek syn-, together with) parts of skull. Led eventually to
mammals. Synapsid pelycosaur >> therapsid >> mammals
Pelycosaur: Sail-backed dinosaur, legs not spread out like lizard but more pillar-like and
under body, allowing greater activity and competence in motion, pendulum like rather than
constant push-up. Teeth differentiated into different types, for pre-processing of food needed
by higher metabolism. Skull changes, bone histology, suggestions of warm-bloodedness.

Chordates
Class Aves
arose late Jurassic, early Cretaceous. Feathers, skeleton modified for flight. Feathers:
epidermal derivative, made of keratin (like fingernails). Carpometacarpis: bears primary
flight feathers, parallel to hand parts. Keeled sternum: breastbone, powerful one needed
to support flight muscles. Strong, light, occasionally hollow bones. All birds lay eggs (as
contrasted to reptiles, which have developed live birthing over 100 independent times.) Why
are there no live-bearing birds? Early birds had teeth, lost them. With mammals, only
exothermic animals.
Archaeopteryx: “ancient wing”, Jurassic bird-reptile, very dinosaur-like. Good fossils found
in Zolenhoffen, German sandstone mine with fine sand, shows feathers clearly, found shortly
after Darwin’s publication and used to support his hypothesis. Thick, heavy bones and no
sternum, bony tail, not a good flyer but did have primary flight feathers.
Archaeornithes: includes archaeopteryx.
Paleognathae: gave rise to Australian flightless birds.
Neognathae: remaining live birds.
Class Mammalia
Two unique characteristics, or synapomorphies:
• Hair
• Mammary glands
(don’t fossilize well)
Three skeletal characteristics (fossilize)
• Lower jaw only one bone, the dentary (several in reptiles)
• Three bones in middle ear: malleus, incus, stapes (reptiles have one or two, never three)
• Joint between upper and lower jaws between dentary and squamosal of skull (in reptiles
this joint is between other bones)
Mammals basically have a synapsid skull design inherited from ancestor
Non diagnostic characteristics (not unique to mammals):
•
•
•
•
•

Warm-blooded
Skin glands: sweat glands and oil-producing sebaceous glands
Large nasal cavities (because of high metabolism) Clean, warm and humidify air
Heterodonty (differentiated teeth)
Diphiodonty: two sets of teeth: baby and adult (“deciduous” teeth, drop out) (reptile
teeth are continually replaced)

Subclass Protheria
monotremes (Greek mon-, one; and trema, hole), or egg-laying mammals, have one opening
for excretion and urination.

132

Subphylum Vertebrata
Subclass Theria
Metatheria: Marsupials (opossum, kangaroo. . . ) Eutheria: Placental mammals (all common
mammals)
Marsupium: (from Greek marsypion, purse or pouch). Gestation period much shorter than
in Eutherian mammals, but after leaving the uterus the tiny offspring crawls into a pouch
where it completes development latched onto a teat.
Recent molecular (read: genetic) evidence suggests that two different mammal groups
may have developed live-bearing ability separately. Instead of being a “rough draft” for
placental-style live bearing, perhaps the marsupial pouch approach is another solution to
the same problem. Advantage: in tough times the parent can pitch out the offspring and
increase its own chance of survival.

133

25 Tissues and Systems

135

26 Epithelial tissue
Comes from various sources, ectodermal or endodermal material. Cell sheet lines a
surface or body cavity. One side, called freesurface or Apical, is exposed to
• animal interior (forming the lumen) or
• exterior of its body cavity.
The other side rests on the basal layer.
Epithelial tissue is not penetrated by blood vessels.
Two categories:
• sheets
• glands
Classified on two features:
• simple, (a single layer of cells),
• stratified, (more than one cell layer.)
Cell shape at free surface:
• squamous (broad and flat)
• cuboidal (spherish)
• columnar (tall and thin)
Simple squamous epithelium
usually lines body cavities and vessels,alveoli, glomeruli of kidney; in blood and lymph
vessels called endothelium; in body cavities called mesothelium (serosae): parietal serous
membranes line body wall, visceral serous membranes cover organ
Simple cuboidal epithelium
in ducts like kidney and salivary glands.
Simple columnar epithelium
nonciliated type lines digestive tract, ciliated type lines some regions of uterine tubes and
lungs
Stratified squamous epithelium
(important) lines mouth, esophagus,and vagina. Cells sometimes dead, flat and keratinized,
making them resistant to abrasion. Stratified squamous epithelium changes to columnar
squamous epithelium progressively down esophagus to the stomach.
Epidermis

137

Epithelial tissue
from epithelium. Below this is dermis, thicker and with blood vessels.
Two specialized epithelia:
• pseudostratified
• transitional
Pseudostratified epithelia
lines the trachea (where it is ciliated)and the male urethra (where it is non ciliated), looks
stratified but not.
Transitional epithelia
found only in bladder and urinary system. As it stretches it appears to go from 6 to 3 cell
layers deep.
Glandular epithelia
(gland: group of cells that excretes something.. mostly derived from epithelium. Glands
are classified into endocrine and exocrine by where they excrete.
Endocrine glands
secrete hormones into the blood without use of ducts.
Exocrine glands
secrete onto the body surface or into a cavity, thru a duct. Exocrine substances include
sweat, mucous, oil, and saliva. An exocrine gland is the liver, which secretes bile.

138

27 Connective tissue
This is a “grab bag” category of diverse tissue types. Functions include binding and
supporting. Types include bone, cartilage, fibrous connective tissue, blood and
adipose (fat) tissue.
If you took away everything in the body except the connective tissue, you’d still be able to
see the basic form of the body.
Form: distinctive cells surrounded by a cell matrix made of extra-cellular fiber grounded
in a ground substance (excluding blood)
Types:
1. connectile connective tissues (can be 1. loose or 2. dense)
2. special connective tissue (includes blood, bones and cartilage).
Fibroblasts form connective tissue proper;
chondoroblasts form cartilage;
osteoblasts form bone;
and blood is formed from various sources.
Ground substance: “unstructured” material that fills space between cells and contains
fibers. Made of
1. interstitial fluid (bathes cells)
2. proteoglycans (protein core with attached polysaccharides, glycoaminoglycans or GAGs
such as chondroitin sulfate, keratin sulfate, and hyalronic acid, whose consistency is syrupy
to gelatin-like)
3. cell-adhesion proteins (connect connective tissue cells to the fibers).
Fibers of connective tissue:

139

Connective tissue
1. Collagen (flexible protein resistant to stretching, tensile strength, most abundant
protein in animals, white)
2. elastin (rubbery, resilient protein, in dermis, lungs, blood vessels, yellow when fresh)
3. andreticulin (like collagen).
Loose connective tissue: found beneath skin, anchors muscles,nerves etc. Include fibroblasts, macrophages, mast cells,and adipose cells. Fibers include collagen and
elastic fibers. Ground substance is “syrupy”. Adipose included.
Dense connective tissue: largely densely packed fibers of collagen or elastin regularly
or irregularly arranged. Forms tendons and ligaments, coverings of muscles, capsules
around organs and joints, and dermis of skin.

perichondrium

Cartilage: There are three cartilage types:
1. hyaline cartilage
2. fibrocartilage (fibrous cartilage)
3. elastic cartilage
Hyaline cartilage: most widespread cartilage type, in adults forms articular surfaces of
long bones, rib tips, rings of trachea, and parts of skull. Mostly collagen, name refers to
glassy appearance. In embryo, bones form first as hyaline cartilage, later ossifies. Found
in tracheal rings. Few collagen fibers.
Fibrous cartilage: have lots of collagen fibers. Found in intervertebral discs, pubic
symphesis. Grades into dense tendon and ligament tissue.
Elastic cartilage: springy and elastic. Found in internal support of external ear and in
epiglottis, yellow when fresh.
Chondrocites (cartilage cells) rely on diffusion for nutrients, as cartilage has no direct
blood supply, and no enervation (nerves). Can be loaded with calcium salts.

140

Subphylum Vertebrata
Bone: Specialized connective tissue, calcium phosphate arranged in highly ordered unit
called osteon, or Hyvercian system. Concentric rings around central canal with blood
vessels and enervation (nerves). Bone varied, not all vertebrate bone is even cellular. Our
concern: simple pattern for mammals.
Lacuna (spaces in which osteocytes found); canaliculi (little canals) bigger diagonal cells,
layers of bone called lamellae.
Three types of bone cells, ending in
-blast, (mend bone)
-cyte (fortify bone)
-clast (tear down bone)
Classified by
1. appearance (spongy vs. hard)
2. where found (outside or inside)
3. how it is formed (endochondral cartilage model forms first and then is ossified, and
entramembranous, bone forms directly without cartilage precursor)
Example of endochondral bone formation: long bone begins to ossify from center shaft,
calcified region expands and cuts off diffusion of nutrients as bone replaces cartilage. In
young mammals, secondary ossification centers then form at bone ends, growth has stopped
by sexual maturity as all primary bone is ossified. In other animals, bones continue growing
throughout their lifetime.
Three types of intramembrous bone:
1. dermal bone
2. sessamoid bone
3. perichondral bone.
Dermal bone forms skull, shoulder/pectoral girdle, and integument, descended from dermal
armor of ancestor. Comes from mesoderm, in dermis of skin.
Sessamoid bones: form directly in tendons. Example: kneecap, also in wrist. Deals with
stress.
Perichondral bone means “around cartilage,” forms around cartilage or bone. Functions in bone repair and in ossification of endochondral bone.

141

Connective tissue
Bone remodeling and repair: bone has mineral structure, and develops tiny fractures,
which, under stress, can lead to larger fractures. To combat this, bone is constantly replaced.
Osteoclasts channel through existing bone, tear down and leave behind osteoblasts
and lacuna, leaving osteocytes. Continually resets mineral structure of bone, and is
preventative maintenance.
When bone broken, callus forms in open ends, periosteum gives rise to new bone with
calcium and new bone matrix, leaves irregular mend. Later, osteoblasts continue fixing over
time and slowly removing imperfection.

142

28 Muscle tissue
Mesodermal in origin, muscle has several functions: supply force for movement, restrain
movement, proper posture, act on viscera (internal organs) for peristalsis (moving food
down digestive tract), give body shape, form sphincters, (such as in esophagus, between
stomach and intestine, large and small intestine, in anus), in sheets of muscles, affect air
flow in and out of lungs, line blood vessels and play vital role in circulation.
Secondary roles: heat production (shivering a specialized heat production to supplement
metabolism).
Muscles co-opted to other non-original functions: sharks detect electrical field created by fish
muscles. Some fish formed electric organs, create current strong enough to repel predators
or stun prey. Other fish can use field as “radar” to see things and communicate with other
animals. (Evolved independently in different groups).
Different classifications: by color, (red or white) location, nature of nervous system
control (voluntary or involuntary), embryonic origin, or by general microscopic appearance (striated, smooth, and cardiac.)
Striated muscle (or skeletal muscle): under voluntary control. Individual cells called
fibers, grouped into fascicle. Myofibrils founding one cell made of even smaller myofilaments. Each striated cell very long and multi-nucleated. Fibers joined end to end to
form longer composite fibers. Sarcomeres: repeating units make up myofibrils. Two
kinds of myofilaments, thick kind made up of myosin and thin of actin. Striations visible
in light microscope, smaller part only with electron microscope.
Cardiac muscle: occurs only in heart. Light banding visible under light microscope.
Each band short, principally mononucleate (occasionally dinucleate) often branched, joined
together with intercollated discs. Involuntary. Waves of contraction spread through intercollated discs. Initiated by nerve stimulation or can originate in the heart itself (useful in heart
transplants.)
Smooth muscle: no striations visible with light microscope. Almost entirely visceral
function: digestion, sphincters, urogenital tracts, piloerectory muscles (make hairs stand up),
lungs. Non-voluntary control. Slow and sustained action. Each cell mononucleate, short,
fusiform (spindly) in shape, cells usually uniform in size.
Striated muscle contraction: Muscle broken into units called fascicles, in units of myofibrils.
Repeating units called sarcomeres, consisting of two kinds of myofilaments:
1. thick, myosin filament
2. thin, actin filament.

143

Muscle tissue
Sarcomere: Thick and thin filaments interspersed in ordered grid.
Sliding filament theory: thick and thin filaments move past each other in opposite
direction, shortening length. Longer muscles contract more rapidly than short ones (see cell
bio for details).
Myosin molecule: two polypeptides twisted together with two globular heads at end.
Myosin filament: many slender myosin molecules together.
Actin filament: chain of actin single, tropomyosin strands with repeated globular
troponin, and with actin. All play role in muscle contraction. Myocin heads have sites
that bind to actin. Actin filaments have many regular sites that can bind to myosin.
Troponin has four sites:
1. one to bind myosin
2. one for actin
3. one for tropomyocin
4. one for calcium ions
Nerve signal reaches muscle, triggers release of chemical signal called neurotransmitter,
that diffuses across cell membrane (sarcolimic reticulum) and binds to receptors in it.
Receptor is acetylcholine, ACH. When there is enough nerve signal, the message travels
through t-line to sarcoplasmic reticulum to release calcium ions.
Lacking calcium, tropomyosin site blocked. In calcium, myosin binding sites exposed and
heads bind to actin molecules, delivering force to move fibers in relation to each other.
Myocin head then interacts with ATP to get “recocked”, if myosin still exposed then it
fires again and results in further muscle contration. If there is no further nerve signal,
sarcoplasmic reticulum sequesters Ca+ ions again and no recocking occurs.
Quirari (or curare): known from movies, used in South America, blocks acetylcholine
receptors in cell and causes skeletal paralysis. Victim dies of asphyxiation because he can’t
breathe.
Duchenne's muscular dystrophy: degeneration of sarcolema, plasma membrane of
muscle cell unable to release signal and quickly atrophies.
Fast and slow twitch fibers: vertebrate muscle fiber. Terms relative within one group
of animals. Differences related to differences in enervation, type of myocin, and actin
activation.
Two parts of force generated by muscle: 1. active component 2. elastic component (energy
stored in muscle when stretched by gravity or another force. Stored in muscle elastic tissue
around tendons. Especially important in limb oscillation, like running, or trunk twisting,
like fish swimming. Up to 90% of stored elastic energy can be recovered.)

144

Subphylum Vertebrata
How does a muscle match its power to its job? Two ways:
1. rate modulation, derived from frequency of nervous stimulation of muscle, force
increases as frequency of stimulation increases up to point of tetanus.
2. selective involvement of motor units, a given neuron enervates a fixed number of
muscle cells, (a motor unit), and force is increased by recruiting more motor units. Motor
units may be small, such as in eye, or larger, like in leg muscle.
How do muscles grow stronger?
1. add more myofilaments, increases cross sectional area by up to 50%, more little ratchets
working
2. proliferation in blood vessels and connective tissue around muscle
Muscle strength is relative to cross sectional area, not length. Not always feasible to add
more cross sectional area.
Pinnate fibers: oriented obliquely (Y-shaped) to minimize muscle mass, in certain circumstances, like calf muscle. Spreads muscle out.
Velocity of shortening greater in long muscle than short. Why? Contraction tied to relation
between fibers, and to total length of muscle. Both long and short muscles reach same
percentage of contraction in same unit time, but distance covered by the longer muscle is
greater.
Synergist muscles: muscles work together to produce motion in same general direction.
Bicep shares work with brachialis.
Antagonist muscles: muscles that oppose each other. Bicep pulls forearm in, triceps pulls
it back out.
Origin vs. insertion: origin is the end of the muscle that more fixed in its attachment to
the body. The more movable end called insertion.
Fixators: muscles that act to stabilize a joint or lever system. Like upper arm when you
clench your fist hard.
Flexors and extensors: applied mainly to limbs. Flexor bends one part relative to another
about limb, extensor straightens it.
Adductor and abductor: adductor draws a limb toward the ventral surface. Abductor
moves limb away from ventral surface. (Adduct: drawn toward; abduct: carry away).

145

29 Vertebrate digestive system
Functions to break down food into molecules small enough to absorb, or pass across digestive
membrane.
Digestive tract: tube extending from lips of mouth to anus or cloacae in bird, reptile or
monotreme.
Lumanal glands: empty into inner body cavity (lumen: inner surface).
Tract divided into three main regions: 1. buccal cavity 2. pharynx 3. alimentary canal
Alimentary canal divided into four regions: 1. esophagus 2. stomach 3. small intestine 4.
large intestine
Accessory digestive glands, outside digestive tract proper, secrete into lumen of tract
through ducts. Includes the salivary glands, liver and pancreas.
Buccal cavity, which includes palate and tongue, develops from infolding of stomadeum,
or second opening of blastula, whereas the rest of the digestive tract develops from the
primitive gut.
Teeth: capture and hold prey. In mammals in particular further process and break down
food into small particles, increasing surface area available for enzymatic action.
Tooth anatomy: 1. crown projects above gum, 2. root below gum, 3. enamel is outer
coating of crown, hardest surface in body, of epideral origin 4. dentin, below enamel,
bone-like and forms bulk of tooth, is harder than bone and contains nerves and blood vessels.
(Remember that mammals are heterodontic, with different types of teeth).
Pharynx: air passage for adult, gill slits in embryo. Important in lower vertebrates, site of
gills. Features derived from pharyngeal region: first pharyngeal pouch gives rise to parts
of the ear, other pouches give rise to various other structures.
Alimentary canal: epithelium lines lumen, glands secrete into lumen, longitudinal and
circular muscles help digestive movements (peristalsis).
Esophagus: tube carries food from mouth to stomach. Expands to fit large bolus (lump
of chewed food). Secretes mucus for lubrication. Birds have crop for storage, enlargement
of esophagus.
Epiglottis: keeps food out of air tube, an evolutionary “kludge,” or fix.
Stomach. Absorbs water, alcohol, nutrients, uses gastric juice with enzymes, mucous, HCl,
released by chief and parietal cells (release protein enzymes) in gastric pits. Rugae: folds
of stomach, disappear when full. Sphincter at both ends of stomach, control food passage.
Chyme: semi-digested food released to small intestine.

147

Vertebrate digestive system
Small intestine: three regions, duodenum, jejunum, and ileum.
Duodenum site of most intestinal digestion. Jejunum and ileum do most of intestinal
absorption. Ileum ends with another sphincter, ileocolic valve or ileosecal valve. Structure:
Circular folds covered with villi (singular is villus).
Villi: finger-like cellular projections, covered with microvilli, tiny projections which increase
surface area. Increases surface area by 900x, speeds digestion (break down) and absorption
(taking in nutrients).
Large intestine: larger diameter, shorter length than small intestine. No villi. In mammals,
forms large gentle loop, colon, empties into straight region, rectum, empties into outside
world through anal sphincter. Colon: absorbs water left over, also absorbs vitamins released
by bacteria which live there (vitamin K).
Food: made up of 1. proteins, 2. fats, 3. carbohydrates 4. fibrous material.
Digestive system breaks foods down. Proteins must be broken to amino acids to be
absorbed. Polysaccharides to monosaccharides, lipids to fatty acids and monoglycerides to absorb.
Salivary glands in mouth, saliva contains mucous, salt and a few enzymes (amalase, begins
starch breakdown). Snake venom from oral gland, mixture of toxins and digestive enzymes.
Breaks down blood vessels and disables nervous system.
Stomach enzymes: released in inactive form, zymogene, converts to active form in lumen
of gut. Transformation is triggered by another enzyme, or the stomach’s low pH. Pepsin
secreted as pepsinogen (-ogen means primitive form). Stomach glands secrete up to two or
three liters a day of gastric juice, which is reabsorbed.
Chyme released to duodenum.
Small intestine has two major accessory glands: 1. pancreas 2. liver
Pancreas has endocrine and exocrine functions, releases large amounts of carbonate to
neutralize acidic chyme, as intestinal enzymes work in neutral pH, and stuff to break down
lipids and starch (zymogens, like tripsin)
Liver releases bile. Bile made from cholesterol, stored in gall bladder, released in
duodenum, emulsifies fats.
Emulsify: keeps fats in tiny drops, which are suspended, increasing surface area and action
of lipases. Protein and carbohydrates absorbed in intestine, taken to liver for processing.
Fatty acids go to lymphatic system
Appendix: vestigial remnant. Much variation in digestive systems within mammals:
herbivore, carnivore, insectivore, non-ruminant herbivore.
Rumen: four-chambered stomach of animals like cows (ruminant herbivores). Cellulose
resistant to digestion, rely on microorganisms to break down cellulose. Some bacteria,
protists and fungi can break down cellulose, almost no animals can. Bacteria break down
cellulose in rumen, to be taken back to the mouth to chew their cud (ruminate). Later cow
swallows to proceed with digestion. (Horses not like this).

148

Subphylum Vertebrata
Coprophagy: rabbits and other animals eat their own feces for the nutritious products of

30 Circulatory system
Circulatory system functions
1. Transportation

a. Respiration: gas exchange (O2 and CO2), overcomes limited rate
of

diffusion

b. Nutrition:<br>
c. Excretory: (remove metabolic wastes)<br>

2. Regulation

a. Transport hormones<br>
b. Regulate body temperature<br>
c. Protection<br>
i. Blood clotting<br>
ii. Immune system (carries white blood cells)

Vasodilation: allows heat loss across epidermis, as seen in elephant ears, takes more blood
to surface of body, sweating may accompany
Countercurrent heat exchange: used by dolphins in fins to conserve heat in cold water.
Veins surround an artery, and blood returning to body absorbs heat from blood traveling
out from body to fin, minimizing heat loss. Used by dogs in feet, etc.
Blood made of 1. plasma and 2. formed cellular elements (red and white blood cells,
and platelets).
Plasma makes up 55% of blood volume. Cellular elements make up the other 45%.
Plasma makeup: 90% water, 7-8% soluble proteins (albumin maintains blood osmotic
integrity, others clot, etc.) 1% electrolytes 1% elements in transit
Red blood cell (erythrocyte): contains hemoglobin, functions in oxygen transport. In
mammals, red blood cells lose nuclei on maturation, and take on biconcave, dimpled, shape.
No self repair, live 120 days. About 1000x more red blood cells than white blood cells.
About 7-8 micrometers in diameter.

151

Circulatory system
Hematocrit: proportion of blood volume that is occupied by cells, about 43% in humans
on average. 48% for men and 38% for women.
White blood cells (leukocytes): Nucleated, about 10-14 micrometers in diameter, commonly amoeboid, escape circulatory system in capillary beds. Include basophils, eosinophils,
neutrophils, monocytes, B- and T-cell lymphocytes.
Platelets (thrombocytes) Membrane bound cell fragments in mammals, no nucleus. In
non-mammals, platelet role replaced by nucleated cells. Accumulate at site of broken blood
vessels, form clots. Bud off special cells in bone marrow. 1-2 micrometers in diameter. 7-8
day life span, 1/10 or 1/20 as abundant as white blood cells.
Arteries: carry blood away from heart. Smallest tubes called arterioles, feed blood to
capillaries.
Veins: return blood to heart. Smallest veins called venules.
Structure of arteries and veins, listed from inside (lumen) out: 1. epithelium (endothelium),
2. elastic connective tissue fibers, 3. smooth muscle, 4. connective tissue. Arteries
have thicker elastic layer than do veins.
Capillaries, where exchange of materials occurs, are very thin and narrow, and red blood
cells pass through single file. Capillaries are tiny but numerous, and their total volume is
greater than that of supplying arteries.
Blood velocity drops in capillaries, picks back up in veins. Pressure highest in arteries, lower
in capillaries and arteries.
Osmotic pressure draws interstitial fluid from blood in arterioles, but replaces it in venules.
One-way valves mean that blood can flow only one way, works with residual blood pressure
and compression by skeletal muscles. Low pressure in thoracic cavity caused by breathing
also helps move blood.
Lymphatic system: part of the immune system, a one-way, or open, system. Takes up
interstitial fluid not taken up by venules.
Lymphatic structures:
1. lymphatic capillaries
2. lymphatic vesicles
3. lymph nodes
4. lymphatic organs (spleen and thymus)
Lymph: movement in mammals through one-way valves, similar to blood movement in
veins. (Some non-mammals have lymphatic hearts of unknown embryonic origin. Frogs and
salamanders have several.) Lymph rejoins cardiovascular system into a large vein near the
heart via single large thoracic duct.

152

Subphylum Vertebrata
As lymph passes through system, passes lymphocytes, second part of immune system.
Heart: pumps blood, design varies between animals. In adult mammal,four chambers form
two separate circulations
1. pulmonary circulation to and from lungs and
2. systemic circulation to and from tissues of body.
Everything in the heart comes in pairs: 2 atria, 2 ventricles (left and right).
Diagrams usually drawn as though animal were on its back.
Pattern of blood flow through heart: blood returning from major veins (vena cava)
enters right atrium, contraction there delivers blood to right ventricle through a tricuspid
valve, one of atrial ventricular valves (AV valve). Contraction of right ventricle drives blood
through semi lunar valve into pulmonary circuit and to lungs.Blood return to heart in
pulmonary veins, is oxygenated. Goes to left atrium, which contracts and delivers blood
to left ventricleby way of aortic semi-lunar valve, then goes to systemic circulation.
Both atria and ventricles contract in unison, left is more powerful than right (to all system
vs. just lungs).
Systole: heart contraction, diastole: heart relaxed
Timing of heart contraction: ventricles rebound to relaxed shape (diastole), and semilunar valves close. Both atria(singular: atrium) fill with blood coming from pulmonary
and systemic circulations.Pressure rises in the atria and blood begins to move into the
ventricles.The atria then contract, forcing more blood into the ventricles. There is a pause,
then ventricles contract. This raises ventricle pressure, atrio-ventricular(AV) valves
shut and semi-lunar valves open, forcing blood from the left ventricle into the major arteries
and from the right ventricle into the aorta.
Control for this action doesn’t rely on nervous stimulation, has intrinsic rhythmicity, called
myogenic. This is the case in mammal as well as in mollusk hearts. Other animals have
neurogenic hearts that rely on nervous stimulation for heart action, originating in the
cardiac ganglion.
The rhythmicity of mammalian heart relies on the sino-atrial (SA)node, or pacemaker.
This is a phylogenic (based on evolutionary history) remnant of an early vertebrate heart
that had one more chamber than modern hearts.
How the heart contracts: waves of depolarization start in SA node and spread
through atria. Connectile tissue pauses the spread of depolarization at the atrial ventricular
node. Signal continued by bundle branches to lower ventricle, begins to stimulate
heart to contract. Contraction starts at bottom of heart at heart apex,then signals spread
through heart.
Medulla (in the brain) controls autonomic nervous system. (The medulla is part of
the brain, is continuous with the spinal cord, and controls involuntary actions of the
body). Sympathetic cardiac acceleratorconnects to spinal cord, uses norepinephrine
to signal. Parasympathetic cardio-inhibitory center reaches heart through Vagus

153

Circulatory system
nerve, usesacetylcholine to signal. Hyperpolarizes membrane to inhibit heart contraction.
(Autonomic nervous system: two parts working in contra to control from both sides.)
Dominant effect here is inhibitory. If we cut Vagus nerve, heart rate promptly rises about
25 bpm.

154

31 Respiratory system
In humans and other animals, for example, the anatomical features of the respiratory system
include airways, lungs, and the respiratory muscles.
Other animals, such as insects, have respiratory systems with very simple anatomical features,
and in amphibians even the skin plays a vital role in gas exchange.
Plants also have respiratory systems but the directionality of gas exchange can be opposite
to that in animals. The respiratory system in plants also includes anatomical features such
as holes on the undersides of leaves known as stomata.
In mammals, the diaphragm divides the body cavity into the
abdominal cavity: contains the viscera (e.g., stomach and intestines)

thoracic cavity: contains the heart and lungs.

Respiratory tree: terminates in alveolus, alveoli. Respiratory bronchioles branch into
alveolar ducts and into alveoli. Alveolus: microscopic air sacs, 300 million of these in human
lungs. Total surface area large. Gas diffuses micrometer, very tiny distance.
Nervous System
Composed of tissues designed to integrate sensory information and direct a coordinated
response to the environment.
Basic unit of the nervous system is the neuron1 , a highly specialized cell that uses both
electrical and chemical processes to communicate. Neurons "listen" to sensory organs or
other neurons, and can simultaneously "hear" from 1 to hundreds of inputs simultaneously.
Likewise, a neuron can "talk" to other neurons or cells that can create an action, like muscle
cells or glands.
Neurons are outnumbered in the nervous system by glia. Glia were once thought to only play
a supportive role in helping neurons survive; today we know that they also are important
participants in the communication process. Glial cells include astrocytes, ependymal cells,
and a cell that has a macrophage like function. There are also oligodendocytes and Schwann
cells that provide a myelin sheath.

31.1 Neuron structure

Figure 9

Neuron

• Dendrite will receive information from other axons
• Stoma is the neuron body and contains typical cell parts including the mitochondria and
nucleus. This is where neurotransmitters are synthesized.
• Axon hillock is where the cell body and the axon meet.
• Axon is surrounded by myelin.
• Contains nodes of Ranvier
Types of axons include unipolar, bipolar, pseudopolar.
Action potentials results from excitatory stimuli received from the dendrites that results
in a signal that travels down the axon. On the cellular level, there is a Na+ influx via
channels causing a depolarization of the cell. Once those channels close, the slower opening
K+ channels will open resulting in hyperpolarization by the cell.
Synapses
Neurotransmitters allow a chemical signal to be sent from one neuron to the other. Neurotransmitters must bypass a physical gap called the synapse. Examples of neurotransmitters
include acetylcholine, epinephrine, and glutamate.
Example : Neuromuscular synapses

156

Central nervous system
Circuits / Nuclei / Ganglia

31.2 Central nervous system
Central nervous system includes the brain and the spinal cord.
Brain There are four lobes of the brain.
•
•
•
•

Frontal lobe - decision making
Parietal lobe
Temporal lobe
Occipital lobe - vision

The areas of the brain are also dedicated to different functions.
• Precentral gyrus
• Postcentral gyrus
Protection The CNS is protected by three layers - the pia mater, the arachnoid mater, and
the dura mater. Protection also comes from the circulation of cerebral spinal fluid (CSF).
CSF helps to float the brain and also provide nutrients to both the brain and the spinal
cord. CSF is synthesized from the choroid plexus of the lateral ventricles. In total, there are
four ventricles - 2 lateral ventricles, a 3rd, and 4th ventricle.

31.3 Peripheral nervous system
The peripheral nervous system is broken down into two sub-systems, the somatic nervous
system and the autonomic nervous system.
ANS - Autonomic Nervous System The ANS has two components - parasympathetic and
sympathetic.
The sympathetic nervous system is the "fight or flight" or fright response and results in an
increased heart rate, increased rate of breathing, and an elevated blood glucose level. There
is also decreased digestion. The second neurotransmitter is epinephrine. In this case, the
first neuron is short and the second neuron is long.
The parasympathetic nervous system is the rest and digest system.
Drugs must be able to pass the blood brain barrier to have an effect on the CNS. Drugs act
by affecting the neuron and how likely it is to fire an action potential.
Stroke occurs when there is a blood clot that goes to the brain and prevent blood flow.

157

32 Sensory systems
Categorized by
1. nature of stimulus, such as mechanical, chemicalor light stimulus, and
2. where stimulus received, such as outside (exteroceptors,such as the eye and
skin temp receptors) or insidebody (interoceptors, such as blood body temperature receptors).
Transduction of sensory input into signal. Means to “carry across”,signal transduced, or
carried, from environment into nervous signal.
Three sensory processes we cover
1. taste and smell (chemoreception)
2. gravity and movement
3. light

32.1 Taste and smell (chemoreception)
Found in mammal nose and mouth, fly feet, fish bodies, moth antennae.
Papilla: bumps on tongue, contain taste buds down between. Sweet, sour, salty and bitter.
Some act directly by ion channels, others act indirectly. Other “taste” sensations really
smell.
Smell: received in nasopharynx. Airborne molecules go into solution on moist epithelial
surface of nasal passage. Approximately 1000 genescode for sensory neuron receptors. “Fried
onions” odor not one receptor but a mixture of many odors registered in our mind as one.
Very sensitive, habituates rapidly (don’t notice a smell after a bit). Odor sensation has
relatively unfiltered root to higher brain centers.
Snakes more chemosensory focused than us.

32.2 Response to gravity and movement
Registered in inner ear. Three semicircular canals loop in three planes at right angles
to each other, responsible for transduction of movement messages. Method: hair cells

159

Sensory systems
deformed by gelatinous membrane. Vestibular apparatus, gives us perception of gravity
and movement. Due to physical response, not chemical binding.
Cochlea: bony, coil shaped part of inner ear, where hearing occurs.
Sound enters through auditory canal, vibrates tympanic membrane,moving three bones
of middle ear (malleus, incus, and stapes)against oval window opening in front of cochlea.
Cochlea has three fluid filled ducts, one of these the organ of Corti. Sound waves in air
go to vibration in organ of Corti; fluid tickles hair cells, which register the movement
along basilar membrane in cochlea. Different sound frequencies move different portions
of basilar membrane. Hearing loss due to loss of hair cells.Humans normally smell more
than 300 odors in a day(Facts and Truth).
Transduction of sound accomplished throgh physical deformation,not chemical binding.

32.3 Vision
Light enters pupil, focused by lensonto retina.
Sclera: hardened part behind retina.
Optic nerves and neurons attached to retina. Blind spot where optic nerve attaches, has
no receptors.
Two types of photoreceptors
1. rods - black and white low-light vision, 100 million in each retina in humans.
2. cones - color vision, work best under better illumination. 3 million in each retina.
Fovia: region of most acute vision, has most of the cones, few rods.
Transduction process of light to signal a molecular change, to light absorbing molecule
called photopigment. Located in outer parts of rods and cones in pigment discs. The rod
photopigment is called rhodopsin,cone has three photopigments, called photopsins. This
molecular change initiates pathways to result in action potential in downstream neuron
leading to vision center in brain.Parul Godika
Each of the three photopsins has a different peak of sensitivity: blue,green or red, and
changes isometric form (from cisto trans) based on light from a particular wavelength
range. Color blindness:inherited lack of one or more types of these cones. Gene carried on X
chromosome, therefore more common in men than women.

32.4 Homeostasis
Is a very important part of everyone's and everything's lives. Defined as dynamic constancy of internal environment, maintenance of a relatively stable environment inside
an organism usually involving feedback regulation.

160

Osmotic environments and regulations
Homeostasis is maintained in face of
1. a varying external environment, or
2. a non-ideal, constant external environment (as with the penguin).
Deals with temperature, pH, chemical concentrations,pressure, oxygen levels.
Occurs through negative feedback loops.
Various forms: simple thermostat in house turns off heater when above a certain temperature
and on when below a certain temperature Involves stimulus, sensor,integrating center,
effector and response.
More efficient control has two sensors and two effectors. Can be antagonistic to each
other, such as, one cools, the other heats.
Precise control through proportional control, not all-or-none, furnace comes on a little
bit if the house a bit cold. Examples in humans: vasoconstriction, change in metabolic rate,
shivering. Physiological responses for high body temp: blood goes to body surface, sweating,
behavioral changes (get out of sun).
Positive feedback loop: effector increases deviation from set point. Amplifies reaction.
Like blood clotting process, uterine contraction during childbirth. Negative feedback must
exist at some point for control.

32.5 Osmotic environments and regulations
1. Marine invertebrates
a) fully marine invertebrates (not intertidal or estuarine) osmoconformers (set
internal environment same as environment, no net flow of ions) in a stenohaline
(narrow non-changing salt level) environment
b) Coastal, intertidal, estuarine (ion levels fluctuate) invertebrates.Partly osmoconfomers, partly osmoregulators in a euryhaline (wide salt level variation)
environment (ex: shore crab, regulates sometimes when salt levels in environment
get real low).
2. Freshwater animals. Here, environment has lower solute concentrations than do
living organisms so water tends to flow in and solutes out.
a) Freshwater fish (bony) dilute urine, and gills actively take up ions (NaCl)
b) Freshwater invertebrates: same situation as freshwater fish but with different
structures
c) Freshwater amphibians: active uptake of salts across their skin
3. Marine fishes: Here the environment has a higher solute concentration than does
the organism so water tends to flow out and ions in.
a) Bony fishes: actively secrete salts (NaCl) across gills, absorb water across gut
wall, their kidney (unlike mammalian kidney) is unable to generate concentrated
urine so glomerulus is reduced, active tubular secretion of MgSO4
b) cartilaginous fishes (and coelacanth): blood retains urea and trimethylamineoxide
to increase its osmolality to that of seawater

161

Sensory systems
4. Terrestrial animals: here problem is loss of water to a drier environment, and
regulation of salt levels.
a) water loss adaptations
b) concentrated exception of salts and nitrogenous wastes
Hypoosmotic: having less osmotic potential than nearby fluid
Hyperosmotic: having more osmotic potential than nearby fluid
Isoosmotic: having equal osmotic potential than nearby fluid
Glomerulus: reduces volume of kidney
Fish started in salt water, spread to fresh water, later reinvaded salt-water environment.
Terrestrial animal water sources:
1. drinking
2. moist foods
3. from breakdown of metabolic molecules like fats. (Desert kangaroo rats get 90% of their
water from metabolism.)
Secretion of nitrogenous wastes: from metabolism of amino acids, amino group has to be
removed in one of three basically interchangeable chemical forms:
1. ammonia (aquatic life)
2. urea (mammals)
3. uric acid (birds)
Ammonia very toxic, soluble, and cheap to produce. Easy to expel for bony fishes.
Urea: low toxicity, good solubility, more costly to lose as it contains other groups on it.
Must be released in solution, water cost.
Uric acid (white part of bird poo) low toxicity, insoluble, secreted with little water loss,
more costly side groups lost than the others.
Mammalian kidney: Structure: fist-sized organ in lower back. About 1/5 of blood from
aorta at any time is passing through kidneys. Blood passes through kidney many times a
day.
Nephron: structural and functional unit of kidney.
Bowmans capsule: funnel-like opening, contains primary filter, the glomerulus.
Proximal convoluted tubule: receives stuff from Bowmans capsule.
Loop of Henle: descends and ascends.

162

Osmotic environments and regulations
Vasa recta: capillaries that surround the Loop of Henle.
Glomerulus: main filter of the nephron, located within the Bowman's capsule
Kidney properties and processes important to its function
1. Active transport of solutes from one fluid to another against a concentration gradient,
Na+ actively transported out of filtrate by cells of the thick ascending loop of Henley into
the interstitial fluid
2. Passive movement of solutes and water from one fluid to another(down a concentration gradient), movement of water and NaCl out of descending loop of Henley into
interstitial fluid.
3. Differential permeability of cells in different regions of the nephron to movement
of water and solutes, ascending thick look is impermeable to water, descending portion is
permeable to water
4. Hormonal control of that permeability, antidiuretic hormone(ADH) increases
permeability of collecting due to water, resulting in reduced volume of filtrate and thus
more concentrated urine.
5. Increasing solute concentration in the interstitial fluid of the kidney, from the
cortex to the deepest medulla, maintained by a countercurrent multiplier mechanism

36 Licenses
36.1 GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
Version 3, 29 June 2007
Copyright © 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
<http://fsf.org/>
Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license document, but changing
it is not allowed. Preamble
The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft
license for software and other kinds of works.
The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed to take away your freedom
to share and change the works. By contrast, the
GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change all versions
of a program–to make sure it remains free software
for all its users. We, the Free Software Foundation,
use the GNU General Public License for most of our
software; it applies also to any other work released
this way by its authors. You can apply it to your
programs, too.
When we speak of free software, we are referring
to freedom, not price.
Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have
the freedom to distribute copies of free software
(and charge for them if you wish), that you receive
source code or can get it if you want it, that you
can change the software or use pieces of it in new
free programs, and that you know you can do these
things.
To protect your rights, we need to prevent others
from denying you these rights or asking you to surrender the rights. Therefore, you have certain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it: responsibilities to respect
the freedom of others.
For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis or for a fee, you must pass
on to the recipients the same freedoms that you received. You must make sure that they, too, receive
or can get the source code. And you must show
them these terms so they know their rights.
Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your
rights with two steps: (1) assert copyright on the
software, and (2) offer you this License giving you
legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify
it.
For the developers’ and authors’ protection, the
GPL clearly explains that there is no warranty for
this free software. For both users’ and authors’
sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be
marked as changed, so that their problems will not
be attributed erroneously to authors of previous
versions.
Some devices are designed to deny users access to
install or run modified versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer can do so.
This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim
of protecting users’ freedom to change the software.
The systematic pattern of such abuse occurs in the
area of products for individuals to use, which is
precisely where it is most unacceptable. Therefore,
we have designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those products. If such problems arise substantially in other domains, we stand
ready to extend this provision to those domains in
future versions of the GPL, as needed to protect
the freedom of users.
Finally, every program is threatened constantly by
software patents. States should not allow patents
to restrict development and use of software on
general-purpose computers, but in those that do,
we wish to avoid the special danger that patents
applied to a free program could make it effectively
proprietary. To prevent this, the GPL assures that
patents cannot be used to render the program nonfree.
The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification follow. TERMS AND
CONDITIONS 0. Definitions.
“This License” refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.
“Copyright” also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of works, such as semiconductor
masks.
“The Program” refers to any copyrightable work
licensed under this License. Each licensee is addressed as “you”. “Licensees” and “recipients” may
be individuals or organizations.
To “modify” a work means to copy from or adapt
all or part of the work in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an exact
copy. The resulting work is called a “modified version” of the earlier work or a work “based on” the
earlier work.
A “covered work” means either the unmodified Program or a work based on the Program.
To “propagate” a work means to do anything with it
that, without permission, would make you directly
or secondarily liable for infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a computer or modifying a private copy. Propagation includes copying, distribution (with or without modification), making available to the public, and in
some countries other activities as well.
To “convey” a work means any kind of propagation
that enables other parties to make or receive copies.
Mere interaction with a user through a computer

network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.
An interactive user interface displays “Appropriate
Legal Notices” to the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible feature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2) tells
the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the extent that warranties are provided),
that licensees may convey the work under this License, and how to view a copy of this License. If
the interface presents a list of user commands or
options, such as a menu, a prominent item in the
list meets this criterion. 1. Source Code.
The “source code” for a work means the preferred
form of the work for making modifications to it.
“Object code” means any non-source form of a
work.
A “Standard Interface” means an interface that either is an official standard defined by a recognized
standards body, or, in the case of interfaces specified for a particular programming language, one
that is widely used among developers working in
that language.
The “System Libraries” of an executable work include anything, other than the work as a whole,
that (a) is included in the normal form of packaging a Major Component, but which is not part of
that Major Component, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that Major Component,
or to implement a Standard Interface for which an
implementation is available to the public in source
code form. A “Major Component”, in this context,
means a major essential component (kernel, window
system, and so on) of the specific operating system
(if any) on which the executable work runs, or a
compiler used to produce the work, or an object
code interpreter used to run it.
The “Corresponding Source” for a work in object
code form means all the source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable work) run
the object code and to modify the work, including
scripts to control those activities. However, it does
not include the work’s System Libraries, or generalpurpose tools or generally available free programs
which are used unmodified in performing those activities but which are not part of the work. For
example, Corresponding Source includes interface
definition files associated with source files for the
work, and the source code for shared libraries and
dynamically linked subprograms that the work is
specifically designed to require, such as by intimate
data communication or control flow between those
subprograms and other parts of the work.
The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users can regenerate automatically from
other parts of the Corresponding Source.
The Corresponding Source for a work in source code
form is that same work. 2. Basic Permissions.
All rights granted under this License are granted
for the term of copyright on the Program, and are
irrevocable provided the stated conditions are met.
This License explicitly affirms your unlimited permission to run the unmodified Program. The output from running a covered work is covered by this
License only if the output, given its content, constitutes a covered work. This License acknowledges
your rights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.
You may make, run and propagate covered works
that you do not convey, without conditions so long
as your license otherwise remains in force. You may
convey covered works to others for the sole purpose
of having them make modifications exclusively for
you, or provide you with facilities for running those
works, provided that you comply with the terms
of this License in conveying all material for which
you do not control copyright. Those thus making or
running the covered works for you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction and control, on terms that prohibit them from making any
copies of your copyrighted material outside their
relationship with you.
Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under the conditions stated below. Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10 makes it unnecessary. 3. Protecting Users’ Legal Rights From AntiCircumvention Law.
No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological measure under any applicable law
fulfilling obligations under article 11 of the WIPO
copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or
similar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such measures.

You may charge any price or no price for each copy
that you convey, and you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee. 5. Conveying Modified
Source Versions.
You may convey a work based on the Program, or
the modifications to produce it from the Program,
in the form of source code under the terms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:
* a) The work must carry prominent notices stating
that you modified it, and giving a relevant date. *
b) The work must carry prominent notices stating
that it is released under this License and any conditions added under section 7. This requirement
modifies the requirement in section 4 to “keep intact all notices”. * c) You must license the entire
work, as a whole, under this License to anyone who
comes into possession of a copy. This License will
therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7
additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all
its parts, regardless of how they are packaged. This
License gives no permission to license the work in
any other way, but it does not invalidate such permission if you have separately received it. * d) If
the work has interactive user interfaces, each must
display Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the
Program has interactive interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your work need not
make them do so.
A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent works, which are not by their
nature extensions of the covered work, and which
are not combined with it such as to form a larger
program, in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an “aggregate” if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not used to
limit the access or legal rights of the compilation’s
users beyond what the individual works permit. Inclusion of a covered work in an aggregate does not
cause this License to apply to the other parts of the
aggregate. 6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.
You may convey a covered work in object code form
under the terms of sections 4 and 5, provided that
you also convey the machine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License, in one
of these ways:
* a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in,
a physical product (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the Corresponding
Source fixed on a durable physical medium customarily used for software interchange. * b) Convey the
object code in, or embodied in, a physical product
(including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a written offer, valid for at least three
years and valid for as long as you offer spare parts
or customer support for that product model, to
give anyone who possesses the object code either
(1) a copy of the Corresponding Source for all the
software in the product that is covered by this License, on a durable physical medium customarily
used for software interchange, for a price no more
than your reasonable cost of physically performing
this conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the
Corresponding Source from a network server at no
charge. * c) Convey individual copies of the object
code with a copy of the written offer to provide
the Corresponding Source. This alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and
only if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord with subsection 6b. * d) Convey the
object code by offering access from a designated
place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent
access to the Corresponding Source in the same way
through the same place at no further charge. You
need not require recipients to copy the Corresponding Source along with the object code. If the place
to copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source may be on a different server (operated by you or a third party) that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain clear
directions next to the object code saying where to
find the Corresponding Source. Regardless of what
server hosts the Corresponding Source, you remain
obligated to ensure that it is available for as long
as needed to satisfy these requirements. * e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission,
provided you inform other peers where the object
code and Corresponding Source of the work are being offered to the general public at no charge under
subsection 6d.
A separable portion of the object code, whose
source code is excluded from the Corresponding
Source as a System Library, need not be included
in conveying the object code work.

When you convey a covered work, you waive any
legal power to forbid circumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention is effected by exercising rights under this License with
respect to the covered work, and you disclaim any
intention to limit operation or modification of the
work as a means of enforcing, against the work’s
users, your or third parties’ legal rights to forbid
circumvention of technological measures. 4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.

A “User Product” is either (1) a “consumer product”, which means any tangible personal property
which is normally used for personal, family, or
household purposes, or (2) anything designed or
sold for incorporation into a dwelling. In determining whether a product is a consumer product,
doubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage. For a particular product received by a particular user, “normally used” refers to a typical or
common use of that class of product, regardless of
the status of the particular user or of the way in
which the particular user actually uses, or expects
or is expected to use, the product. A product is a
consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial commercial, industrial or nonconsumer uses, unless such uses represent the only
significant mode of use of the product.

You may convey verbatim copies of the Program’s
source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately
publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice; keep intact all notices stating that this License
and any non-permissive terms added in accord with
section 7 apply to the code; keep intact all notices
of the absence of any warranty; and give all recipients a copy of this License along with the Program.

“Installation Information” for a User Product
means any methods, procedures, authorization
keys, or other information required to install and
execute modified versions of a covered work in that
User Product from a modified version of its Corresponding Source. The information must suffice to
ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object code is in no case prevented or interfered
with solely because modification has been made.

If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or specifically for use in, a User
Product, and the conveying occurs as part of a
transaction in which the right of possession and
use of the User Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a fixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the
Corresponding Source conveyed under this section
must be accompanied by the Installation Information. But this requirement does not apply if neither
you nor any third party retains the ability to install
modified object code on the User Product (for example, the work has been installed in ROM).
The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a requirement to continue to
provide support service, warranty, or updates for a
work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for the User Product in which it has been
modified or installed. Access to a network may be
denied when the modification itself materially and
adversely affects the operation of the network or
violates the rules and protocols for communication
across the network.
Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation
Information provided, in accord with this section
must be in a format that is publicly documented
(and with an implementation available to the public
in source code form), and must require no special
password or key for unpacking, reading or copying.
7. Additional Terms.
“Additional permissions” are terms that supplement
the terms of this License by making exceptions from
one or more of its conditions. Additional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program
shall be treated as though they were included in
this License, to the extent that they are valid under applicable law. If additional permissions apply
only to part of the Program, that part may be used
separately under those permissions, but the entire
Program remains governed by this License without
regard to the additional permissions.
When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may
at your option remove any additional permissions
from that copy, or from any part of it. (Additional
permissions may be written to require their own removal in certain cases when you modify the work.)
You may place additional permissions on material,
added by you to a covered work, for which you have
or can give appropriate copyright permission.
Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you add to a covered work, you
may (if authorized by the copyright holders of that
material) supplement the terms of this License with
terms:
* a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the terms of sections 15 and 16 of this
License; or * b) Requiring preservation of specified
reasonable legal notices or author attributions in
that material or in the Appropriate Legal Notices
displayed by works containing it; or * c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material,
or requiring that modified versions of such material
be marked in reasonable ways as different from the
original version; or * d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or authors of
the material; or * e) Declining to grant rights under
trademark law for use of some trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or * f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that material
by anyone who conveys the material (or modified
versions of it) with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for any liability that these
contractual assumptions directly impose on those
licensors and authors.
All other non-permissive additional terms are considered “further restrictions” within the meaning of
section 10. If the Program as you received it, or any
part of it, contains a notice stating that it is governed by this License along with a term that is a
further restriction, you may remove that term. If a
license document contains a further restriction but
permits relicensing or conveying under this License,
you may add to a covered work material governed
by the terms of that license document, provided
that the further restriction does not survive such
relicensing or conveying.
If you add terms to a covered work in accord with
this section, you must place, in the relevant source
files, a statement of the additional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating where to
find the applicable terms.
Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive,
may be stated in the form of a separately written
license, or stated as exceptions; the above requirements apply either way. 8. Termination.
You may not propagate or modify a covered work
except as expressly provided under this License.
Any attempt otherwise to propagate or modify it is
void, and will automatically terminate your rights
under this License (including any patent licenses
granted under the third paragraph of section 11).
However, if you cease all violation of this License,
then your license from a particular copyright holder
is reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until the
copyright holder explicitly and finally terminates
your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright
holder fails to notify you of the violation by some
reasonable means prior to 60 days after the cessation.
Moreover, your license from a particular copyright
holder is reinstated permanently if the copyright
holder notifies you of the violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have received
notice of violation of this License (for any work)

from that copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after your receipt of the
notice.
Termination of your rights under this section does
not terminate the licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under this License.
If your rights have been terminated and not permanently reinstated, you do not qualify to receive new
licenses for the same material under section 10. 9.
Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.
You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or run a copy of the Program. Ancillary propagation of a covered work occurring solely
as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission
to receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance. However, nothing other than this License
grants you permission to propagate or modify any
covered work. These actions infringe copyright if
you do not accept this License. Therefore, by modifying or propagating a covered work, you indicate
your acceptance of this License to do so. 10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.
Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient
automatically receives a license from the original
licensors, to run, modify and propagate that work,
subject to this License. You are not responsible
for enforcing compliance by third parties with this
License.
An “entity transaction” is a transaction transferring control of an organization, or substantially all
assets of one, or subdividing an organization, or
merging organizations. If propagation of a covered work results from an entity transaction, each
party to that transaction who receives a copy of the
work also receives whatever licenses to the work the
party’s predecessor in interest had or could give under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the Corresponding Source of the work from
the predecessor in interest, if the predecessor has it
or can get it with reasonable efforts.
You may not impose any further restrictions on the
exercise of the rights granted or affirmed under this
License. For example, you may not impose a license
fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of rights
granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that any patent claim
is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for
sale, or importing the Program or any portion of it.
11. Patents.
A “contributor” is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this License of the Program or a
work on which the Program is based. The work
thus licensed is called the contributor’s “contributor version”.
A contributor’s “essential patent claims” are all
patent claims owned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or hereafter acquired,
that would be infringed by some manner, permitted by this License, of making, using, or selling its
contributor version, but do not include claims that
would be infringed only as a consequence of further
modification of the contributor version. For purposes of this definition, “control” includes the right
to grant patent sublicenses in a manner consistent
with the requirements of this License.
Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent license under the contributor’s essential patent claims, to make, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and
propagate the contents of its contributor version.

In the following three paragraphs, a “patent license” is any express agreement or commitment,
however denominated, not to enforce a patent (such
as an express permission to practice a patent or
covenant not to sue for patent infringement). To
“grant” such a patent license to a party means to
make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a patent against the party.
If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying
on a patent license, and the Corresponding Source
of the work is not available for anyone to copy,
free of charge and under the terms of this License,
through a publicly available network server or other
readily accessible means, then you must either (1)
cause the Corresponding Source to be so available,
or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit
of the patent license for this particular work, or
(3) arrange, in a manner consistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent
license to downstream recipients. “Knowingly relying” means you have actual knowledge that, but
for the patent license, your conveying the covered
work in a country, or your recipient’s use of the covered work in a country, would infringe one or more
identifiable patents in that country that you have
reason to believe are valid.
If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or arrangement, you convey, or propagate
by procuring conveyance of, a covered work, and
grant a patent license to some of the parties receiving the covered work authorizing them to use,
propagate, modify or convey a specific copy of the
covered work, then the patent license you grant is
automatically extended to all recipients of the covered work and works based on it.
A patent license is “discriminatory” if it does not include within the scope of its coverage, prohibits the
exercise of, or is conditioned on the non-exercise
of one or more of the rights that are specifically
granted under this License. You may not convey a
covered work if you are a party to an arrangement
with a third party that is in the business of distributing software, under which you make payment
to the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying the work, and under which the
third party grants, to any of the parties who would
receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory patent license (a) in connection with copies
of the covered work conveyed by you (or copies
made from those copies), or (b) primarily for and in
connection with specific products or compilations
that contain the covered work, unless you entered
into that arrangement, or that patent license was
granted, prior to 28 March 2007.
Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting any implied license or other defenses to infringement that may otherwise be available to you under applicable patent law. 12. No
Surrender of Others’ Freedom.
If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court
order, agreement or otherwise) that contradict the
conditions of this License, they do not excuse you
from the conditions of this License. If you cannot
convey a covered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and any
other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence
you may not convey it at all. For example, if you
agree to terms that obligate you to collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you
convey the Program, the only way you could satisfy
both those terms and this License would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program. 13. Use
with the GNU Affero General Public License.

Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have permission to link or combine any
covered work with a work licensed under version
3 of the GNU Affero General Public License into
a single combined work, and to convey the resulting work. The terms of this License will continue
to apply to the part which is the covered work, but
the special requirements of the GNU Affero General
Public License, section 13, concerning interaction
through a network will apply to the combination
as such. 14. Revised Versions of this License.
The Free Software Foundation may publish revised
and/or new versions of the GNU General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will be
similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.
Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU General Public License
“or any later version” applies to it, you have the
option of following the terms and conditions either
of that numbered version or of any later version
published by the Free Software Foundation. If the
Program does not specify a version number of the
GNU General Public License, you may choose any
version ever published by the Free Software Foundation.
If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide
which future versions of the GNU General Public
License can be used, that proxy’s public statement
of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes
you to choose that version for the Program.
Later license versions may give you additional or
different permissions. However, no additional obligations are imposed on any author or copyright
holder as a result of your choosing to follow a later
version. 15. Disclaimer of Warranty.
THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE
STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE
PROGRAM “AS IS” WITHOUT WARRANTY OF
ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED,
INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY
AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.
THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND
PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH
YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.
16. Limitation of Liability.
IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING
WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY
OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE,
BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING
OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE
THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED
BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE
OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY
OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER
OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF
THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. 17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.
If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided above cannot be given local legal ef-

fect according to their terms, reviewing courts shall
apply local law that most closely approximates an
absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection
with the Program, unless a warranty or assumption
of liability accompanies a copy of the Program in
return for a fee.
END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs
If you develop a new program, and you want it to
be of the greatest possible use to the public, the
best way to achieve this is to make it free software
which everyone can redistribute and change under
these terms.
To do so, attach the following notices to the program. It is safest to attach them to the start of
each source file to most effectively state the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least
the “copyright” line and a pointer to where the full
notice is found.
<one line to give the program’s name and a brief
idea of what it does.> Copyright (C) <year>
<name of author>
This program is free software: you can redistribute
it and/or modify it under the terms of the GNU
General Public License as published by the Free
Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.
This program is distributed in the hope that
it will be useful, but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. See the GNU General Public
License for more details.
You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License along with this program. If not,
see <http://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.
Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.
If the program does terminal interaction, make it
output a short notice like this when it starts in an
interactive mode:
<program> Copyright (C) <year> <name of author> This program comes with ABSOLUTELY
NO WARRANTY; for details type ‘show w’. This is
free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it
under certain conditions; type ‘show c’ for details.
The hypothetical commands ‘show w’ and ‘show c’
should show the appropriate parts of the General
Public License. Of course, your program’s commands might be different; for a GUI interface, you
would use an “about box”.
You should also get your employer (if you work
as a programmer) or school, if any, to sign a
“copyright disclaimer” for the program, if necessary.
For more information on this, and
how to apply and follow the GNU GPL, see
<http://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.
The GNU General Public License does not permit
incorporating your program into proprietary programs. If your program is a subroutine library, you
may consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with the library. If this is
what you want to do, use the GNU Lesser General
Public License instead of this License. But first,
please read <http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/whynot-lgpl.html>.

36.2 GNU Free Documentation License
Version 1.3, 3 November 2008
Copyright © 2000, 2001, 2002, 2007, 2008 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <http://fsf.org/>
Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license document, but changing
it is not allowed. 0. PREAMBLE
The purpose of this License is to make a manual,
textbook, or other functional and useful document
"free" in the sense of freedom: to assure everyone
the effective freedom to copy and redistribute it,
with or without modifying it, either commercially
or noncommercially. Secondarily, this License preserves for the author and publisher a way to get
credit for their work, while not being considered
responsible for modifications made by others.
This License is a kind of "copyleft", which means
that derivative works of the document must themselves be free in the same sense. It complements
the GNU General Public License, which is a copyleft license designed for free software.
We have designed this License in order to use it
for manuals for free software, because free software
needs free documentation: a free program should
come with manuals providing the same freedoms
that the software does. But this License is not limited to software manuals; it can be used for any textual work, regardless of subject matter or whether
it is published as a printed book. We recommend
this License principally for works whose purpose is
instruction or reference. 1. APPLICABILITY AND
DEFINITIONS
This License applies to any manual or other work,
in any medium, that contains a notice placed by the
copyright holder saying it can be distributed under
the terms of this License. Such a notice grants a
world-wide, royalty-free license, unlimited in duration, to use that work under the conditions stated
herein. The "Document", below, refers to any such
manual or work. Any member of the public is a licensee, and is addressed as "you". You accept the
license if you copy, modify or distribute the work
in a way requiring permission under copyright law.
A "Modified Version" of the Document means any
work containing the Document or a portion of it, either copied verbatim, or with modifications and/or
translated into another language.
A "Secondary Section" is a named appendix or a
front-matter section of the Document that deals exclusively with the relationship of the publishers or

authors of the Document to the Document’s overall
subject (or to related matters) and contains nothing that could fall directly within that overall subject. (Thus, if the Document is in part a textbook
of mathematics, a Secondary Section may not explain any mathematics.) The relationship could be
a matter of historical connection with the subject
or with related matters, or of legal, commercial,
philosophical, ethical or political position regarding them.
The "Invariant Sections" are certain Secondary Sections whose titles are designated, as being those of
Invariant Sections, in the notice that says that the
Document is released under this License. If a section does not fit the above definition of Secondary
then it is not allowed to be designated as Invariant.
The Document may contain zero Invariant Sections.
If the Document does not identify any Invariant
Sections then there are none.
The "Cover Texts" are certain short passages of text
that are listed, as Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover
Texts, in the notice that says that the Document is
released under this License. A Front-Cover Text
may be at most 5 words, and a Back-Cover Text
may be at most 25 words.
A "Transparent" copy of the Document means a
machine-readable copy, represented in a format
whose specification is available to the general public, that is suitable for revising the document
straightforwardly with generic text editors or (for
images composed of pixels) generic paint programs
or (for drawings) some widely available drawing editor, and that is suitable for input to text formatters or for automatic translation to a variety of formats suitable for input to text formatters. A copy
made in an otherwise Transparent file format whose
markup, or absence of markup, has been arranged
to thwart or discourage subsequent modification by
readers is not Transparent. An image format is not
Transparent if used for any substantial amount of
text. A copy that is not "Transparent" is called
"Opaque".
Examples of suitable formats for Transparent
copies include plain ASCII without markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input format, SGML or
XML using a publicly available DTD, and standardconforming simple HTML, PostScript or PDF designed for human modification. Examples of transparent image formats include PNG, XCF and JPG.
Opaque formats include proprietary formats that
can be read and edited only by proprietary word
processors, SGML or XML for which the DTD
and/or processing tools are not generally available,
and the machine-generated HTML, PostScript or

PDF produced by some word processors for output
purposes only.
The "Title Page" means, for a printed book, the
title page itself, plus such following pages as are
needed to hold, legibly, the material this License
requires to appear in the title page. For works in
formats which do not have any title page as such,
"Title Page" means the text near the most prominent appearance of the work’s title, preceding the
beginning of the body of the text.
The "publisher" means any person or entity that
distributes copies of the Document to the public.
A section "Entitled XYZ" means a named subunit
of the Document whose title either is precisely XYZ
or contains XYZ in parentheses following text that
translates XYZ in another language. (Here XYZ
stands for a specific section name mentioned below,
such as "Acknowledgements", "Dedications", "Endorsements", or "History".) To "Preserve the Title"
of such a section when you modify the Document
means that it remains a section "Entitled XYZ" according to this definition.
The Document may include Warranty Disclaimers
next to the notice which states that this License
applies to the Document.
These Warranty Disclaimers are considered to be included by reference
in this License, but only as regards disclaiming warranties: any other implication that these Warranty
Disclaimers may have is void and has no effect on
the meaning of this License. 2. VERBATIM COPYING
You may copy and distribute the Document in any
medium, either commercially or noncommercially,
provided that this License, the copyright notices,
and the license notice saying this License applies to
the Document are reproduced in all copies, and that
you add no other conditions whatsoever to those
of this License. You may not use technical measures to obstruct or control the reading or further
copying of the copies you make or distribute. However, you may accept compensation in exchange for
copies. If you distribute a large enough number of
copies you must also follow the conditions in section 3.
You may also lend copies, under the same conditions stated above, and you may publicly display
copies. 3. COPYING IN QUANTITY
If you publish printed copies (or copies in media
that commonly have printed covers) of the Document, numbering more than 100, and the Document’s license notice requires Cover Texts, you

must enclose the copies in covers that carry, clearly
and legibly, all these Cover Texts: Front-Cover
Texts on the front cover, and Back-Cover Texts
on the back cover. Both covers must also clearly
and legibly identify you as the publisher of these
copies. The front cover must present the full title
with all words of the title equally prominent and
visible. You may add other material on the covers
in addition. Copying with changes limited to the
covers, as long as they preserve the title of the Document and satisfy these conditions, can be treated
as verbatim copying in other respects.
If the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to fit legibly, you should put the first ones
listed (as many as fit reasonably) on the actual
cover, and continue the rest onto adjacent pages.
If you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the
Document numbering more than 100, you must either include a machine-readable Transparent copy
along with each Opaque copy, or state in or with
each Opaque copy a computer-network location
from which the general network-using public has
access to download using public-standard network
protocols a complete Transparent copy of the Document, free of added material. If you use the latter option, you must take reasonably prudent steps,
when you begin distribution of Opaque copies in
quantity, to ensure that this Transparent copy will
remain thus accessible at the stated location until
at least one year after the last time you distribute
an Opaque copy (directly or through your agents or
retailers) of that edition to the public.
It is requested, but not required, that you contact the authors of the Document well before redistributing any large number of copies, to give them
a chance to provide you with an updated version of
the Document. 4. MODIFICATIONS
You may copy and distribute a Modified Version of
the Document under the conditions of sections 2
and 3 above, provided that you release the Modified Version under precisely this License, with the
Modified Version filling the role of the Document,
thus licensing distribution and modification of the
Modified Version to whoever possesses a copy of it.
In addition, you must do these things in the Modified Version:
* A. Use in the Title Page (and on the covers, if
any) a title distinct from that of the Document,
and from those of previous versions (which should,
if there were any, be listed in the History section
of the Document). You may use the same title as
a previous version if the original publisher of that
version gives permission. * B. List on the Title

Page, as authors, one or more persons or entities
responsible for authorship of the modifications in
the Modified Version, together with at least five of
the principal authors of the Document (all of its
principal authors, if it has fewer than five), unless
they release you from this requirement. * C. State
on the Title page the name of the publisher of the
Modified Version, as the publisher. * D. Preserve
all the copyright notices of the Document. * E. Add
an appropriate copyright notice for your modifications adjacent to the other copyright notices. * F.
Include, immediately after the copyright notices, a
license notice giving the public permission to use
the Modified Version under the terms of this License, in the form shown in the Addendum below. *
G. Preserve in that license notice the full lists of Invariant Sections and required Cover Texts given in
the Document’s license notice. * H. Include an unaltered copy of this License. * I. Preserve the section
Entitled "History", Preserve its Title, and add to it
an item stating at least the title, year, new authors,
and publisher of the Modified Version as given on
the Title Page. If there is no section Entitled "History" in the Document, create one stating the title,
year, authors, and publisher of the Document as
given on its Title Page, then add an item describing the Modified Version as stated in the previous
sentence. * J. Preserve the network location, if any,
given in the Document for public access to a Transparent copy of the Document, and likewise the network locations given in the Document for previous
versions it was based on. These may be placed in
the "History" section. You may omit a network location for a work that was published at least four
years before the Document itself, or if the original
publisher of the version it refers to gives permission.
* K. For any section Entitled "Acknowledgements"
or "Dedications", Preserve the Title of the section,
and preserve in the section all the substance and
tone of each of the contributor acknowledgements
and/or dedications given therein. * L. Preserve all
the Invariant Sections of the Document, unaltered
in their text and in their titles. Section numbers or
the equivalent are not considered part of the section
titles. * M. Delete any section Entitled "Endorsements". Such a section may not be included in the
Modified Version. * N. Do not retitle any existing
section to be Entitled "Endorsements" or to conflict
in title with any Invariant Section. * O. Preserve
any Warranty Disclaimers.
If the Modified Version includes new front-matter
sections or appendices that qualify as Secondary
Sections and contain no material copied from the
Document, you may at your option designate some
or all of these sections as invariant. To do this, add
their titles to the list of Invariant Sections in the
Modified Version’s license notice. These titles must
be distinct from any other section titles.
You may add a section Entitled "Endorsements",
provided it contains nothing but endorsements of
your Modified Version by various parties—for example, statements of peer review or that the text
has been approved by an organization as the authoritative definition of a standard.
You may add a passage of up to five words as a
Front-Cover Text, and a passage of up to 25 words
as a Back-Cover Text, to the end of the list of Cover
Texts in the Modified Version. Only one passage of
Front-Cover Text and one of Back-Cover Text may
be added by (or through arrangements made by)
any one entity. If the Document already includes
a cover text for the same cover, previously added
by you or by arrangement made by the same entity
you are acting on behalf of, you may not add an-

other; but you may replace the old one, on explicit
permission from the previous publisher that added
the old one.
The author(s) and publisher(s) of the Document do
not by this License give permission to use their
names for publicity for or to assert or imply endorsement of any Modified Version. 5. COMBINING DOCUMENTS
You may combine the Document with other documents released under this License, under the terms
defined in section 4 above for modified versions,
provided that you include in the combination all
of the Invariant Sections of all of the original documents, unmodified, and list them all as Invariant
Sections of your combined work in its license notice, and that you preserve all their Warranty Disclaimers.
The combined work need only contain one copy of
this License, and multiple identical Invariant Sections may be replaced with a single copy. If there
are multiple Invariant Sections with the same name
but different contents, make the title of each such
section unique by adding at the end of it, in parentheses, the name of the original author or publisher
of that section if known, or else a unique number.
Make the same adjustment to the section titles in
the list of Invariant Sections in the license notice
of the combined work.
In the combination, you must combine any sections
Entitled "History" in the various original documents, forming one section Entitled "History"; likewise combine any sections Entitled "Acknowledgements", and any sections Entitled "Dedications".
You must delete all sections Entitled "Endorsements". 6. COLLECTIONS OF DOCUMENTS
You may make a collection consisting of the Document and other documents released under this License, and replace the individual copies of this License in the various documents with a single copy
that is included in the collection, provided that you
follow the rules of this License for verbatim copying
of each of the documents in all other respects.
You may extract a single document from such a collection, and distribute it individually under this License, provided you insert a copy of this License
into the extracted document, and follow this License in all other respects regarding verbatim copying of that document. 7. AGGREGATION WITH
INDEPENDENT WORKS
A compilation of the Document or its derivatives
with other separate and independent documents or
works, in or on a volume of a storage or distribution
medium, is called an "aggregate" if the copyright resulting from the compilation is not used to limit the
legal rights of the compilation’s users beyond what
the individual works permit. When the Document
is included in an aggregate, this License does not
apply to the other works in the aggregate which are
not themselves derivative works of the Document.
If the Cover Text requirement of section 3 is applicable to these copies of the Document, then if the
Document is less than one half of the entire aggregate, the Document’s Cover Texts may be placed
on covers that bracket the Document within the
aggregate, or the electronic equivalent of covers
if the Document is in electronic form. Otherwise
they must appear on printed covers that bracket
the whole aggregate. 8. TRANSLATION

Translation is considered a kind of modification, so
you may distribute translations of the Document
under the terms of section 4. Replacing Invariant
Sections with translations requires special permission from their copyright holders, but you may include translations of some or all Invariant Sections
in addition to the original versions of these Invariant Sections. You may include a translation of this
License, and all the license notices in the Document,
and any Warranty Disclaimers, provided that you
also include the original English version of this License and the original versions of those notices and
disclaimers. In case of a disagreement between the
translation and the original version of this License
or a notice or disclaimer, the original version will
prevail.
If a section in the Document is Entitled "Acknowledgements", "Dedications", or "History", the requirement (section 4) to Preserve its Title (section
1) will typically require changing the actual title.
9. TERMINATION
You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute
the Document except as expressly provided under
this License. Any attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute it is void, and will
automatically terminate your rights under this License.
However, if you cease all violation of this License,
then your license from a particular copyright holder
is reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until the
copyright holder explicitly and finally terminates
your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright
holder fails to notify you of the violation by some
reasonable means prior to 60 days after the cessation.
Moreover, your license from a particular copyright
holder is reinstated permanently if the copyright
holder notifies you of the violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have received
notice of violation of this License (for any work)
from that copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after your receipt of the
notice.
Termination of your rights under this section does
not terminate the licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under this License.
If your rights have been terminated and not permanently reinstated, receipt of a copy of some or all
of the same material does not give you any rights
to use it. 10. FUTURE REVISIONS OF THIS LICENSE
The Free Software Foundation may publish new, revised versions of the GNU Free Documentation License from time to time. Such new versions will be
similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.
See http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/.
Each version of the License is given a distinguishing version number. If the Document specifies that
a particular numbered version of this License "or
any later version" applies to it, you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of
that specified version or of any later version that
has been published (not as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation. If the Document does not specify
a version number of this License, you may choose
any version ever published (not as a draft) by the

11. RELICENSING
"Massive Multiauthor Collaboration Site" (or
"MMC Site") means any World Wide Web server
that publishes copyrightable works and also provides prominent facilities for anybody to edit those
works. A public wiki that anybody can edit is
an example of such a server. A "Massive Multiauthor Collaboration" (or "MMC") contained in the
site means any set of copyrightable works thus published on the MMC site.
"CC-BY-SA"
means
the
Creative
Commons
Attribution-Share Alike 3.0 license published by
Creative Commons Corporation, a not-for-profit
corporation with a principal place of business in
San Francisco, California, as well as future copyleft
versions of that license published by that same
organization.
"Incorporate" means to publish or republish a Document, in whole or in part, as part of another Document.
An MMC is "eligible for relicensing" if it is licensed
under this License, and if all works that were first
published under this License somewhere other than
this MMC, and subsequently incorporated in whole
or in part into the MMC, (1) had no cover texts or
invariant sections, and (2) were thus incorporated
prior to November 1, 2008.
The operator of an MMC Site may republish an
MMC contained in the site under CC-BY-SA on the
same site at any time before August 1, 2009, provided the MMC is eligible for relicensing. ADDENDUM: How to use this License for your documents
To use this License in a document you have written,
include a copy of the License in the document and
put the following copyright and license notices just
after the title page:
Copyright (C) YEAR YOUR NAME. Permission is
granted to copy, distribute and/or modify this document under the terms of the GNU Free Documentation License, Version 1.3 or any later version published by the Free Software Foundation; with no
Invariant Sections, no Front-Cover Texts, and no
Back-Cover Texts. A copy of the license is included
in the section entitled "GNU Free Documentation
License".
If you have Invariant Sections, Front-Cover Texts
and Back-Cover Texts, replace the "with . . .
Texts." line with this:
with the Invariant Sections being LIST THEIR TITLES, with the Front-Cover Texts being LIST, and
with the Back-Cover Texts being LIST.
If you have Invariant Sections without Cover Texts,
or some other combination of the three, merge
those two alternatives to suit the situation.
If your document contains nontrivial examples of
program code, we recommend releasing these examples in parallel under your choice of free software
license, such as the GNU General Public License,
to permit their use in free software.

36.3 GNU Lesser General Public License
GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
Version 3, 29 June 2007
Copyright © 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
<http://fsf.org/>
Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license document, but changing
it is not allowed.
This version of the GNU Lesser General Public License incorporates the terms and conditions of version 3 of the GNU General Public License, supplemented by the additional permissions listed below.
0. Additional Definitions.
As used herein, “this License” refers to version 3
of the GNU Lesser General Public License, and the
“GNU GPL” refers to version 3 of the GNU General
Public License.
“The Library” refers to a covered work governed by
this License, other than an Application or a Combined Work as defined below.
An “Application” is any work that makes use of an
interface provided by the Library, but which is not
otherwise based on the Library. Defining a subclass
of a class defined by the Library is deemed a mode
of using an interface provided by the Library.
A “Combined Work” is a work produced by combining or linking an Application with the Library.
The particular version of the Library with which
the Combined Work was made is also called the
“Linked Version”.
The “Minimal Corresponding Source” for a Combined Work means the Corresponding Source for
the Combined Work, excluding any source code for
portions of the Combined Work that, considered in
isolation, are based on the Application, and not on
the Linked Version.

The “Corresponding Application Code” for a Combined Work means the object code and/or source
code for the Application, including any data and
utility programs needed for reproducing the Combined Work from the Application, but excluding the
System Libraries of the Combined Work. 1. Exception to Section 3 of the GNU GPL.
You may convey a covered work under sections 3
and 4 of this License without being bound by section 3 of the GNU GPL. 2. Conveying Modified
Versions.
If you modify a copy of the Library, and, in your
modifications, a facility refers to a function or data
to be supplied by an Application that uses the facility (other than as an argument passed when the
facility is invoked), then you may convey a copy of
the modified version:
* a) under this License, provided that you make a
good faith effort to ensure that, in the event an Application does not supply the function or data, the
facility still operates, and performs whatever part
of its purpose remains meaningful, or * b) under
the GNU GPL, with none of the additional permissions of this License applicable to that copy.
3. Object Code Incorporating Material from Library Header Files.
The object code form of an Application may incorporate material from a header file that is part of
the Library. You may convey such object code under terms of your choice, provided that, if the incorporated material is not limited to numerical parameters, data structure layouts and accessors, or
small macros, inline functions and templates (ten
or fewer lines in length), you do both of the following:
* a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the
object code that the Library is used in it and that
the Library and its use are covered by this License.
* b) Accompany the object code with a copy of the
GNU GPL and this license document.

4. Combined Works.
You may convey a Combined Work under terms of
your choice that, taken together, effectively do not
restrict modification of the portions of the Library
contained in the Combined Work and reverse engineering for debugging such modifications, if you
also do each of the following:
* a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the
Combined Work that the Library is used in it and
that the Library and its use are covered by this License. * b) Accompany the Combined Work with a
copy of the GNU GPL and this license document. *
c) For a Combined Work that displays copyright notices during execution, include the copyright notice
for the Library among these notices, as well as a reference directing the user to the copies of the GNU
GPL and this license document. * d) Do one of the
following: o 0) Convey the Minimal Corresponding
Source under the terms of this License, and the Corresponding Application Code in a form suitable for,
and under terms that permit, the user to recombine
or relink the Application with a modified version
of the Linked Version to produce a modified Combined Work, in the manner specified by section 6 of
the GNU GPL for conveying Corresponding Source.
o 1) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for
linking with the Library. A suitable mechanism
is one that (a) uses at run time a copy of the Library already present on the user’s computer system, and (b) will operate properly with a modified
version of the Library that is interface-compatible
with the Linked Version. * e) Provide Installation
Information, but only if you would otherwise be required to provide such information under section 6
of the GNU GPL, and only to the extent that such
information is necessary to install and execute a
modified version of the Combined Work produced
by recombining or relinking the Application with
a modified version of the Linked Version. (If you
use option 4d0, the Installation Information must
accompany the Minimal Corresponding Source and
Corresponding Application Code. If you use option
4d1, you must provide the Installation Information
in the manner specified by section 6 of the GNU
GPL for conveying Corresponding Source.)

5. Combined Libraries.
You may place library facilities that are a work
based on the Library side by side in a single library
together with other library facilities that are not
Applications and are not covered by this License,
and convey such a combined library under terms of
your choice, if you do both of the following:
* a) Accompany the combined library with a copy
of the same work based on the Library, uncombined
with any other library facilities, conveyed under
the terms of this License. * b) Give prominent notice with the combined library that part of it is a
work based on the Library, and explaining where
to find the accompanying uncombined form of the
same work.
6. Revised Versions of the GNU Lesser General
Public License.
The Free Software Foundation may publish revised
and/or new versions of the GNU Lesser General
Public License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,
but may differ in detail to address new problems or
concerns.
Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Library as you received it specifies that
a certain numbered version of the GNU Lesser General Public License “or any later version” applies to
it, you have the option of following the terms and
conditions either of that published version or of any
later version published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Library as you received it does not
specify a version number of the GNU Lesser General Public License, you may choose any version of
the GNU Lesser General Public License ever published by the Free Software Foundation.
If the Library as you received it specifies that a
proxy can decide whether future versions of the
GNU Lesser General Public License shall apply,
that proxy’s public statement of acceptance of
any version is permanent authorization for you to
choose that version for the Library.
