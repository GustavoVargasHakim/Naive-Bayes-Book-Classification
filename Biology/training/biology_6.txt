Overview
The DNA Toolbox
• Sequencing of the genomes of more than 7,000
species was under way in 2010
• DNA sequencing has depended on advances in
technology, starting with making recombinant DNA
• In recombinant DNA, nucleotide sequences from
two different sources, often two species, are
combined in vitro into the same DNA molecule

• Recently the genome sequences of two extinct
species—Neanderthals and wooly mammoths—
have been completed
• Advances in sequencing techniques make
genome sequencing increasingly faster and
less expensive

• Methods for making recombinant DNA are central
to genetic engineering, the direct manipulation of
genes for practical purposes
• DNA technology has revolutionized
biotechnology, the manipulation of organisms or
their genetic components to make useful products
• An example of DNA technology is the microarray,
a measurement of gene expression of thousands
of different genes
• The applications of DNA technology affect
everything from agriculture, to criminal law,
to medical research

Concept 19.1
DNA sequencing and DNA cloning are valuable tools
for genetic engineering and biological inquiry
• The complementarity of the two DNA strands is
the basis for nucleic acid hybridization, the base
pairing of one strand of nucleic acid to the
complementary sequence on another strand
• Genetic engineering is the direct manipulation of
genes for practical purposes

DNA Sequencing
• Researchers can exploit the principle of
complementary base pairing to determine a
gene’s complete nucleotide sequence, called
DNA sequencing
• The first automated procedure was based on a
technique called dideoxy or chain termination
sequencing, developed by Sanger

DNA Sequencing
• Relatively short DNA fragments can be sequenced
by the dideoxy chain termination method, the first
automated method to be employed
• Modified nucleotides called
dideoxyribonucleotides (ddNTP) attach to
synthesized DNA strands of different lengths
• Each type of ddNTP is tagged with a distinct
fluorescent label that identifies the nucleotide at
the end of each DNA fragment
• The DNA sequence can be read from the resulting
spectrogram

• “Next-generation sequencing” techniques use a
single template strand that is immobilized and
amplified to produce an enormous number of
identical fragments
• Thousands or hundreds of thousands of
fragments (400–1,000 nucleotides long) are
sequenced in parallel
• This is a type of “high-throughput” technology

• In “third-generation sequencing,” the techniques
used are even faster and less expensive than the
previous

Making Multiple Copies of a Gene or Other
DNA Segment
• To work directly with specific genes, scientists
prepare well-defined segments of DNA in identical
copies, a process called DNA cloning
• Plasmids are small circular DNA molecules that
replicate separately from the bacterial
chromosome
• Researchers can insert DNA into plasmids to
produce recombinant DNA, a molecule with
DNA from two different sources

DNA Cloning and Its Applications:
A Preview
• Most methods for cloning pieces of DNA in the
laboratory share general features, such as the use
of bacteria and their plasmids
• Cloned genes are useful for making copies of a
particular gene and producing a protein product

• Gene cloning involves using bacteria to make
multiple copies of a gene
• Foreign DNA is inserted into a plasmid, and the
recombinant plasmid is inserted into a bacterial
cell
• Reproduction in the bacterial cell results in cloning
of the plasmid including the foreign DNA
• This results in the production of multiple copies of
a single gene

• A plasmid used to clone a foreign gene is called a
cloning vector
• Bacterial plasmids are widely used as cloning
vectors because they are readily obtained, easily
manipulated, easily introduced into bacterial cells,
and once in the bacteria they multiply rapidly
• Gene cloning is useful for amplifying genes to
produce a protein product for research, medical,
or other purposes

Using Restriction Enzymes to Make
Recombinant DNA
• Bacterial restriction enzymes cut DNA
molecules at specific DNA sequences called
restriction sites
• A restriction enzyme usually makes many cuts,
yielding restriction fragments
• The most useful restriction enzymes cut DNA in a
staggered way, producing fragments with “sticky
ends.”

• Sticky ends can bond with complementary sticky
ends of other fragments
• DNA ligase is an enzyme that seals the bonds
between restriction fragments

Cloning a Eukaryotic Gene in a
Bacterial Plasmid
• In gene cloning, the original plasmid is called a
cloning vector
• A cloning vector is a DNA molecule that can carry
foreign DNA into a host cell and replicate there

Producing Clones of Cells Carrying
Recombinant Plasmids
• Several steps are required to clone the
hummingbird β-globin gene in a bacterial plasmid
– The hummingbird genomic DNA and a bacterial
plasmid are isolated
– Both are cut with the same restriction enzyme
– The fragments are mixed, and DNA ligase is
added to bond the fragment sticky ends

– Some recombinant plasmids now contain
hummingbird DNA
– The DNA mixture is added to bacteria that have
been genetically engineered to accept it
– The bacteria are plated on a type of agar that
selects for the bacteria with recombinant
plasmids
– This results in the cloning of many hummingbird
DNA fragments, including the β-globin gene

• A genomic library that is made using bacteria is
the collection of recombinant vector clones
produced by cloning DNA fragments from an
entire genome
• A genomic library that is made using
bacteriophages is stored as a collection of phage
clones

• A bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) is a
large plasmid that has been trimmed down and
can carry a large DNA insert
• BACs are another type of vector used in DNA
library construction

• A complementary DNA (cDNA) library is made
by cloning DNA made in vitro by reverse
transcription of all the mRNA produced by a
particular cell
• A cDNA library represents only part of the
genome—only the subset of genes transcribed
into mRNA in the original cells

Screening a Library for Clones Carrying
a Gene of Interest
• A clone carrying the gene of interest can be
identified with a nucleic acid probe having a
sequence complementary to the gene
• This process is called nucleic acid hybridization

• A probe can be synthesized that is
complementary to the gene of interest
• For example, if the desired gene is

Gel Electrophoresis and Southern Blotting
• One indirect method of rapidly analyzing and
comparing genomes is gel electrophoresis
• This technique uses a gel as a molecular sieve to
separate nucleic acids or proteins by size,
electrical charge, and other properties
• A current is applied that causes charged
molecules to move through the gel
• Molecules are sorted into “bands” by their size

• To check the recombinant plasmid, researchers
might cut the products again using the same
restriction enzyme
• To separate and visualize the fragments
produced, gel electrophoresis would be carried
out
• This technique uses a gel made of a polymer to
separate a mixture of nucleic acids or proteins
based on size, charge, or other physical
properties

Amplifying DNA in Vitro: The
Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR)
• The polymerase chain reaction, PCR, can
produce many copies of a specific target segment
of DNA
• A three-step cycle—heating, cooling, and
replication—brings about a chain reaction that
produces an exponentially growing population of
identical DNA molecules
• The key to PCR is an unusual, heat-stable DNA
polymerase called Taq polymerase.

• PCR uses a pair of primers specific for the
sequence to be amplified
• PCR amplification occasionally incorporates
errors into the amplified strands and so cannot
substitute for gene cloning in cells

Expressing Cloned Eukaryotic Genes
• After a gene has been cloned, its protein product
can be produced in larger amounts for research
• Cloned genes can be expressed as protein in
either bacterial or eukaryotic cells

Bacterial Expression Systems
• Several technical difficulties hinder expression of
cloned eukaryotic genes in bacterial host cells
• To overcome differences in promoters and other
DNA control sequences, scientists usually employ
an expression vector, a cloning vector that
contains a highly active bacterial promoter

• Another difficulty with eukaryotic gene expression
in bacteria is the presence of introns in most
eukaryotic genes
• Researchers can avoid this problem by using
cDNA, complementary to the mRNA, which
contains only exons

Eukaryotic Cloning and Expression
Systems
• Molecular biologists can avoid eukaryote-bacterial
incompatibility issues by using eukaryotic cells,
such as yeasts, as hosts for cloning and
expressing genes
• Even yeasts may not possess the proteins
required to modify expressed mammalian proteins
properly
• In such cases, cultured mammalian or insect cells
may be used to express and study proteins

• One method of introducing recombinant DNA into
eukaryotic cells is electroporation, applying a
brief electrical pulse to create temporary holes in
plasma membranes
• Alternatively, scientists can inject DNA into cells
using microscopically thin needles
• Once inside the cell, the DNA is incorporated into
the cell’s DNA by natural genetic recombination

• In restriction fragment analysis, DNA fragments
produced by restriction enzyme digestion of a
DNA molecule are sorted by gel electrophoresis
• Restriction fragment analysis can be used to
compare two different DNA molecules, such as
two alleles for a gene if the nucleotide difference
alters a restriction site

• Variations in DNA sequence are called
polymorphisms
• Sequence changes that alter restriction sites are
called RFLPs (restriction fragment length
polymorphisms)

Cross-Species Gene Expression and
Evolutionary Ancestry
• The remarkable ability of bacteria to express some
eukaryotic proteins underscores the shared
evolutionary ancestry of living species
• For example, Pax-6 is a gene that directs
formation of a vertebrate eye; the same gene in
flies directs the formation of an insect eye (which
is quite different from the vertebrate eye)
• The Pax-6 genes in flies and vertebrates can
substitute for each other

Concept 19.2
Biologists use DNA technology to study gene
expression and function
• DNA cloning allows researchers to
– Compare genes and alleles between individuals
– Locate gene expression in a body
– Determine the role of a gene in an organism

• Several techniques are used to analyze the DNA
of genes
• Analysis of when and where a gene or group of
genes is expressed can provide important clues
about gene function

Analyzing Gene Expression
• The most straightforward way to discover which
genes are expressed in certain cells is to identify
the mRNAs being made
• Nucleic acid probes can hybridize with mRNAs
transcribed from a gene
• Probes can be used to identify where or when a
gene is transcribed in an organism

Studying the Expression of Single Genes
• Changes in the expression of a gene during
embryonic development can be tested using
– Northern blotting
– Reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction

• Both methods are used to compare mRNA from
different developmental stages
• The most straightforward way to discover which
genes are expressed in certain cells is to identify
the mRNAs being made

• Northern blotting combines gel electrophoresis
of mRNA followed by hybridization with a probe on
a membrane
• Identification of mRNA at a particular
developmental stage suggests protein function at
that stage
• mRNA can be detected by nucleic acid
hybridization with complementary molecules
• These complementary molecules, of either DNA or
RNA, are nucleic acid probes

• In situ hybridization uses fluorescent dyes
attached to probes to identify the location of
specific mRNAs in place in the intact organism

• Reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain
reaction (RT-PCR) is quicker and more sensitive
because it requires less mRNA than Northern
blotting
• Reverse transcriptase is added to mRNA to make
complementary DNA (cDNA), which serves as a
template for PCR amplification of the gene of
interest
• The products are run on a gel and the mRNA of
interest identified

embryonic stages to determine the gene
expression differences between them
• By uncovering gene interactions and clues to
gene function DNA microarray assays may
contribute to understanding of disease and
suggest new diagnostic targets

Determining Gene Function
• One way to determine function is to disable the
gene and observe the consequences
• Using in vitro mutagenesis, mutations are
introduced into a cloned gene, altering or
destroying its function
• When the mutated gene is returned to the cell, the
normal gene’s function might be determined by
examining the mutant’s phenotype

• Gene expression can also be silenced using RNA
interference (RNAi)
• Synthetic double-stranded RNA molecules
matching the sequence of a particular gene are
used to break down or block the gene’s mRNA

• In humans, researchers analyze the genomes of
many people with a certain genetic condition to try
to find nucleotide changes specific to the condition
• These genome-wide association studies test for
genetic markers, sequences that vary among
individuals
• Genetic markers called SNPs (single nucleotide
polymorphisms) occur on average every 100–
300 base pairs
• SNPs can be detected by PCR, and any SNP
shared by people affected with a disorder but not
among unaffected people may pinpoint the
location of the disease-causing gene

• SNP variants that are found frequently associated
with a particular inherited disorder alert
researchers to the most likely location for the
disease-causing gene
• SNPs are rarely directly involved in the disease;
they are most often in noncoding regions of the
genome

Concept 19.3
Cloned organisms and stem cells are useful for
basic research and other applications
• Organismal cloning produces one or more
organisms genetically identical to the “parent” that
donated the single cell
• A stem cell is a relatively unspecialized cell that
can reproduce itself indefinitely, or under certain
conditions can differentiate into one or more types
of specialized cells

Cloning Plants: Single-Cell Cultures
• One experimental approach for testing genomic
equivalence is to see whether a differentiated cell
can generate a whole organism
• In plants, cells can de differentiate and then
give rise to all the specialized cell types of
the organism
• A totipotent cell is one that can generate a
complete new organism
• Plant cloning is used extensively in agriculture

Cloning Animals: Nuclear Transplantation
• In nuclear transplantation, the nucleus of an
unfertilized egg cell or zygote is replaced with the
nucleus of a differentiated cell
• Experiments with frog embryos have shown that a
transplanted nucleus can often support normal
development of the egg
• However, the older the donor nucleus, the lower
the percentage of normally developing tadpoles

Reproductive Cloning of Mammals
• In 1997, Scottish researchers announced the birth
of Dolly, a lamb cloned from an adult sheep by
nuclear transplantation from a differentiated
mammary cell
• Dolly’s premature death in 2003, as well as her
arthritis, led to speculation that her cells were not
as healthy as those of a normal sheep, possibly
reflecting incomplete reprogramming of the
original transplanted nucleus

• Since 1997, cloning has been demonstrated in
many mammals, including mice, cats, cows,
horses, mules, pigs, and dogs
• CC (for Carbon Copy) was the first cat cloned;
however, CC differed somewhat from her female
“parent”
• Cloned animals do not always look or behave
exactly the same

Figure 19.18

Faulty Gene Regulation in Cloned Animals
• In most nuclear transplantation studies, only a
small percentage of cloned embryos have
developed normally to birth, and many cloned
animals exhibit defects
• Many epigenetic changes, such as acetylation of
histones or methylation of DNA, must be reversed
in the nucleus from a donor animal in order for
genes to be expressed or repressed appropriately
for early stages of development

Stem Cells of Animals
• A stem cell is a relatively unspecialized cell that
can reproduce itself indefinitely and differentiate
into specialized cells of one or more types
• Stem cells isolated from early embryos at the
blastocyst stage are called embryonic stem (ES)
cells; these are able to differentiate into all cell
types
• The adult body also has stem cells, which replace
nonreproducing specialized cells

Embryonic and Adult Stem Cells
• Many early embryos contain stem cells capable
of giving rise to differentiated embryonic cells of
any type
• In culture, these embryonic stem cells reproduce
indefinitely
• Depending on culture conditions, they can be
made to differentiate into a variety of specialized
cells
• Adult stem cells can generate multiple (but not all)
cell types and are used in the body to replace
nonreproducing cells as needed

• Embryonic stem (ES) cells are pluripotent,
capable of differentiating into many different
cell types
• The ultimate aim of research with stem cells
is to supply cells for the repair of damaged or
diseased organs
• ES cells present ethical and political issues

Induced Pluripotent Stem (iPS) Cells
• Researchers can treat differentiated cells, and
reprogram them to act like ES cells
• Researchers used retroviruses to induce extra
copies of four stem cell master regulatory genes
to produce induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells
• iPS cells can perform most of the functions of
ES cells
• iPS cells can be used as models for study of
certain diseases and potentially as replacement
cells for patients

Concept 19.4
The practical applications of DNA-based
biotechnology affect our lives in many ways

• Many fields benefit from DNA technology and
genetic engineering

Medical Applications
• One benefit of DNA technology is identification of
human genes in which mutation plays a role in
genetic diseases
• Researchers use microarray assays or other tools
to identify genes turned on or off in particular
diseases
• The genes and their products are then potential
targets for prevention or therapy

Diagnosis and Treatment of Diseases
• Scientists can diagnose many human genetic
disorders using PCR and sequence-specific
primers, then sequencing the amplified product to
look for the disease-causing mutation
• SNPs may be associated with a disease-causing
mutation
• SNPs may also be correlated with increased risks
for conditions such as heart disease or certain
types of cancer

Human Gene Therapy
• Gene therapy is the alteration of an afflicted
individual’s genes
• Gene therapy holds great potential for treating
disorders traceable to a single defective gene
• Vectors are used for delivery of genes into
specific types of cells, for example bone marrow
• Gene therapy provokes both technical and ethical
questions

Pharmaceutical Products
• Advances in DNA technology and genetic
research are important to the development of new
drugs to treat diseases

1. Synthesis of Small Molecules for Use as Drugs
• The drug imatinib is a small molecule that inhibits
overexpression of a specific leukemia-causing
receptor
• Pharmaceutical products that are proteins can be
synthesized on a large scale

2. Protein Production in Cell Cultures
• Host cells in culture can be engineered to secrete
a protein as it is made, simplifying the task of
purifying it
• This is useful for the production of insulin, human
growth hormones, and vaccines

3. Protein Production by “Pharm” Animals
• Transgenic animals are made by introducing
genes from one species into the genome of
another animal
• Transgenic animals are pharmaceutical “factories,”
producers of large amounts of otherwise rare
substances for medical use

Figure 19.23

Forensic Evidence and Genetic Profiles
• An individual’s unique DNA sequence, or genetic
profile, can be obtained by analysis of tissue or
body fluids
• DNA testing can identify individuals with a high
degree of certainty
• Genetic profiles can be analyzed using RFLP
analysis by Southern blotting

• Even more sensitive is the use of genetic markers
called short tandem repeats (STRs), which are
variations in the number of repeats of specific
DNA sequences
• PCR and gel electrophoresis are used to amplify
and then identify STRs of different lengths
• The probability that two people who are not
identical twins have the same STR markers is
exceptionally small
• As of 2013 more than 300 innocent people have
been released from prison as a result of STR
analysis of old DNA evidence

Environmental Cleanup
• Genetic engineering can be used to modify the
metabolism of microorganisms
• Some modified microorganisms can be used to
extract minerals from the environment or degrade
potentially toxic waste materials

Agricultural Applications
• DNA technology is being used to improve
agricultural productivity and food quality
• Genetic engineering of transgenic animals speeds
up the selective breeding process
• Beneficial genes can be transferred between
varieties of species

• Agricultural scientists have endowed a number of
crop plants with genes for desirable traits
• The Ti plasmid is the most commonly used vector
for introducing new genes into plant cells
• Genetic engineering in plants has been used to
transfer many useful genes including those for
herbicide resistance, increased resistance to pests,
increased resistance to salinity, and improved
nutritional value of crops

Safety and Ethical Questions Raised
by DNA Technology
• Potential benefits of genetic engineering must
be weighed against potential hazards of
creating harmful products or procedures
• Guidelines are in place in the United States
and other countries to ensure safe practices for
recombinant DNA technology

• Most public concern about possible hazards
centers on genetically modified (GM) organisms
used as food
• Some are concerned about the creation of “super
weeds” from the transfer of genes from GM crops
to their wild relatives
• Other worries include the possibility that
transgenic protein products might cause allergic
reactions

• As biotechnology continues to change, so does
its use in agriculture, industry, and medicine
• National agencies and international organizations
strive to set guidelines for safe and ethical
practices in the use of biotechnology
