Preface to CMB 3e
A grasp of the logic and practice of science is essential to understand the rest of the world
around us. To that end, the CMB3e iText (like earlier editions) remains focused on
experimental support for what we know about cell and molecular biology, and on showing
students the relationship of cell structure and function. Rather than trying to be a
comprehensive reference book, CMB3e selectively details investigative questions,
methods and experiments that lead to our understanding of cell biology. This focus is
nowhere more obvious than in the chapter learning objectives and in external links to
supplementary material. The Basic CMB3e version of the iText includes links to external
web-sources as well as the author’s short, just-in-time YouTube VOPs (with edited,
optional closed captions), all embedded in or near relevant text. Each video is identified
with a descriptive title and video play and QR bar codes:

*Note: Web links to external resources were live at the time of publication of the iText, but may disappear
without notice!

The Learning objectives align with content and ask students to use new knowledge to
make connections and deepen their understanding of concept and experiment. All
external links are intended to expand or explain textual content and concepts and to
engage student curiosity. Links to full VOP lectures are now at the back of the book.
include optional edited closed captions.
All images in the iText are by the author or are from public domain or Creative Commons
(CC) licensed sources. For all externally sourced images, CC licenses are indicated with
the image. Beyond the Basic CMB3e, the freely available Annotated CMB3e contains
interactive links and formative assessments in the form of Challenge boxes. A CMB3e
Sample Chapter and CMB3e iText for Instructors model additional interactive features,
including short 25 Words or Less writing assignments that can be incorporated into
almost any course management system, and all of which the author assigned as
homework in his flipped, blended course. These assessments aim to reinforce writing as
well as critical thinking skills. The CMB3e Sample Chapter is freely available for
download; the CMB3e for Instructors version of the iText is available on request.
My goal in writing this iText is to make the content engaging, free and comparable in
accuracy and currency to commercial textbooks. I encourage instructors to use the
interactive features of the iText (critical thought questions, YouTube videos, etc.) to
challenge their students.

With all of these enhancements, I encourage students to think about
 how good and great experiments were inspired and designed,
 how alternative experimental results were predicted,
 how data was interpreted, and finally,
 investigators (and we!) arrive at the most interesting “next questions”.
The online iText is the most efficient way to access links and complete online
assignments. Nevertheless, you can download, read, study, and access many links with
a smart phone or tablet. And you can add your own annotations digitally, or write in the
margins of a printout the old-fashioned way! Your instructor may provide additional
instructions for using your iText.

Special Note to Instructors from the Author
The Basic CMB3e and the Annotated versions of the CMB3e iText is freely available as
pdf files to you and your students. To get the CMB3e iText for Instructors you will need
to fill out a short form identifying you as an instructor. When you submit the form, you will
get pdf as well as MS-Word files for both the Annotated iText as well as Instructor’s iText.
Once you download the CMB3e iText, you should find it an easy matter to add, subtract,
modify or embellish any part of either version to suit your purposes in accordance with the
Creative Commons CC-BY license under which it is published. Note also that, if students
access the iText through a CMS (Course Management System, e.g., BlackBoard, D2L,
Canvas, etc.), you can create links to Discussion Fora, DropBox, Quiz assignments, etc.
directly in the iText. Thus, you are free to provide your customized version of the text to
your students (e.g., as a pdf file). Feel free also to ask your students participate in the
improvement of the iText (for fun or for credit!) and to share the results with others! One
final bit of advice: whereas I provide content updates, please remember that some of the
new content has significant potential subject to confirmation but is not necessarily
definitive. I hope that you (and perhaps your students!) will enjoy creating and
customizing interactive elements in the iText. Above all, I hope that your students will
achieve a better understanding of how scientists use skills of inductive and inferential
logic to ask questions and formulate hypotheses…, and how they apply concept and
method to testing those hypotheses

Introduction

You will read in this book about experiments that revealed secrets of cell and molecular
biology, many of which earned their researchers Nobel and other prizes. But let’s begin
here with a Tale of Roberts, two among many giants of science in the renaissance and
age of enlightenment whose seminal studies came too early to win a Nobel Prize.
One of these, Robert Boyle, was born in 1627 to wealthy, aristocrat parents. In his
teens, after the customary Grand Tour of renaissance Europe (Greece, Italy…) and the
death of his father, he returned to England in 1644, heir to great wealth. In the mid-1650s
he moved from his estates to Oxford where he set about studying physics and chemistry.
He built a laboratory with his own money in order to do experiments on the behavior of
gasses under pressure, and with a little help, discovered Boyle’s Law, confirming that the
gasses obey mathematical rules. He is also credited with showing that light and sound
could travel through a vacuum, that something in air enables combustion, that sound
travels through air in waves, that heat and particulate motion were related, and that the
practice of alchemy was bogus! In fact, Boyle pretty much converted alchemy
to chemistry by doing chemical analysis, a term he coined. As a chemist, he also
rejected the old Greek concept of earth, air, fire and water elements. Instead, he
defined elements as we still do today: the element is the smallest component of a
substance that cannot be further chemically subdivided. He did this a century before
Antoine Lavoisier listed and define the first elements! Based on his physical studies and
chemical analyses, Boyle even believed that the indivisible unit of elements were atoms,
and that the behavior of elements could be explained by the motion of atoms. Boyle later
codified in print the scientific method that made him a successful experimental scientist.
The second of our renaissance Roberts was Robert Hooke, born in 1635. In contrast to
Boyle parents, Hooke’s were of modest means. They managed nonetheless to nurture
their son’s interest in things mechanical. While he never took the Grand Tour, he learned
well and began studies of chemistry and astronomy at Christ Church College, Oxford in
1653. To earn a living, he took a position as Robert Boyle’s assistant. It was with

CMB3e

1

Hooke’s assistance that Boyle did the experiments leading to the formulation of Boyle’s
Law. While at Oxford, he made friends and useful connections. One friend was the
architect Christopher Wren. In 1662, Boyle, a founding member of the Royal Society of
London, supported Hooke to become the society’s curator of experiments. However, to
support himself, Hooke hired on as professor of geometry at Gresham College (London).
After “the great fire” of London in 1666, Hooke, as city surveyor and builder, participated
with Christopher Wren in the design and reconstruction of the city. Always interested in
things mechanical, he also studied the elastic property of springs. This led him to
Hooke’s Law, which said that the force required to compress a spring was proportional to
the length the spring was compressed. In later years these studies led Hooke to imagine
how a coil spring might be used (instead of a pendulum) to regulate a clock. While he
never invented such a clock, he was appointed to a Royal Commission to find the first
reliable method to determine longitude at sea. He must have been gratified to know that
the solution to accurate determination of longitude at sea turned out to involve a coilspring clock! Along the way in his ‘practical’ studies, he also looked at little things,
publishing his observations in Micrographia in 1665. Therein, he described microscopic
structures of animal parts and even snowflakes. He also described fossils as having once
been alive, and compared structures in thin slices of cork that he saw in his microscope to
monk’s cells (rooms, chambers) in a monastery. Hooke is best remembered for his law of
elasticity, and of course, for coining the word cell, which we now understand as the
smallest unit of living things.
Now fast-forward almost 200 years to observations of plant and animal cells early in the
19th century. Many of these studies revealed common structural features including a
nucleus, a boundary wall and a common organization of cells into groups to form
multicellular structures of plants and animals and even lower life forms. These
studies led to the first two precepts of Cell Theory: (1) Cells are the basic unit of living
things; (2) Cells can have an independent existence. Later in the century when Louis
Pasteur disproved notions of spontaneous generation, and German histologists
observed mitosis and meiosis (the underlying events of cell division in eukaryotes) a third
precept rounded out Cell Theory: (3) Cells come from pre-existing cells. That is, they
reproduce.
We begin this chapter with a reminder of the scientific method, that way of thinking
about our world that emerged formally in the 17th century. Then we take a tour of the cell,
reminding ourselves of basic structures and organelles. After the ‘tour’, we consider the
origin of life from a common ancestral cell and the subsequent evolution of cellular
complexity and the incredible diversity of life forms. Finally, we consider some of the

CMB3e

methods we use to study cells. Since cells are small, several techniques of microscopy,
cell dissection and functional/biochemical analysis are described to illustrate how we
come to understand cell function.
Learning Objectives
When you have mastered the information in this chapter, you should be able to:
1. compare and contrast hypotheses and theories and place them and other elements of
the scientific enterprise into their place in the cycle of the scientific method.
2. compare and contrast structures common to and that distinguish prokaryotes,
eukaryotes and archaea, and groups within these domains.
3. articulate the function of different cellular substructures.
4. explain how prokaryotes and eukaryotes accomplish the same functions, i.e. have the
same properties of life, even though prokaryotes lack most of the structures.
5. outline a procedure to study a specific cell organelle or other substructure.
6. describe how the different structures (particularly in eukaryotic cells) relate/interact
with each other to accomplish specific functions.
7. describe some structural and functional features that distinguish prokaryotes
(eubacteria), eukaryotes and archaea.
8. place cellular organelles and other substructures in their evolutionary context, i.e.,
describe their origins and the selective pressures that led to their evolution.
9. distinguish between the random nature of mutation and natural selection in evolution
10. relate archaea to other life forms and speculate on their origins in evolution.
11. suggest why evolution leads to more complex ways of sustaining life,
12. explain how fungi are more like animals than plants.

Scientific Method – The Practice of Science

For an amusing look at how scientists think, check out The Pleasure of Finding Things Out:
The Best Short Works of Richard Feynman (1999, New York, Harper Collins). Here we focus
on the essentials of the scientific method originally inspired by Robert Boyle, and then
look at how science is practiced today. Scientific method refers to a standardized
protocol for observing, asking questions about, and investigating natural phenomena.
Simply put, it says look/listen, infer a cause and test your inference. As captured by the
Oxford English Dictionary, the essential inviolable commonality of all scientific practice is
that it relies on “systematic observation, measurement, and experiment, and the
formulation, testing and modification of hypotheses."

CMB3e

3

A. The Method
Adherence to the method is not strict, and may sometimes breach adherence to
protocol! In the end, scientific method in actual practice recognizes human biases and
prejudices and allows deviations from the protocol. Nevertheless, an understanding of
scientific method will guides the prudent investigator to balance personal bias against
the leaps of intuition that successful science requires. The practice of scientific
method by most scientists would indeed be considered a success by almost any
measure. Science “as a way of knowing” the world around us constantly tests,
confirms, rejects and ultimately reveals new knowledge, integrating that knowledge
into our worldview. Here in the usual order are the key elements of the scientific
method:






Observe natural phenomena (includes reading the science of others).
Infer and propose an hypothesis (explanation) based on objectivity and reason.
Hypotheses are declarative sentences that sound like a fact, but aren’t! Good
hypotheses are testable, easily turned into if/then (predictive) yes-or-no questions.
Design an experiment to test the hypothesis: results must be measurable evidence
for or against the hypothesis.
Perform the experiment and then observe, measure, collect data and test for
statistical validity (where applicable). Then, repeat the experiment.
Consider how your data supports or does not support your hypothesis and then
integrate your experimental results with earlier hypotheses and prior knowledge.

But, how do theories and laws fit into the scientific method?
A scientific theory, contrary to what many people think, is not a guess. Rather, a
theory is a statement well supported by experimental evidence and widely accepted
by the scientific community. One of the most enduring, tested theories is of course the
theory of evolution. Among scientists, theories might be thought of as ‘fact’ in
common parlance, but we recognize that they are still subject to testing and,
modification, and may even be overturned. While some of Darwin’s notions have
been modified over time, in this case, those modifications have only strengthened our
understanding that species diversity is the result of natural selection. You can check
out some of Darwin’s own work (1859, 1860; The Origin of Species] at Origin of
Species. For more recent commentary on the evolutionary underpinnings of science,
check out Dobzhansky T (1973, Nothing in biology makes sense except in the light of
evolution. Am. Biol. Teach. 35:125-129) and Gould, S.J. (2002, The Structure of
Evolutionary Theory. Boston, Harvard University Press).

CMB3e

A scientific Law is thought of as universal and even closer to ‘fact’ than a theory!
Scientific laws are most common in math and physics. In life sciences, we recognize
Mendel’s Law of Segregation and Law of Independent Assortment as much in his
honor as for their universal and enduring explanation of genetic inheritance in living
things. But Laws are not facts! Laws too, are always subject to experimental test.
Astrophysicists are actively testing universally accepted laws of physics. Strictly
speaking, even Mendel’s Law of Independent Assortment should not be called a law.
Indeed, it is not true as he stated it! Check the Mendelian Genetics section of an
introductory textbook to see how chromosomal crossing over violates this law.
In describing how we do science, the Wikipedia entry states: “the goal of a scientific
inquiry is to obtain knowledge in the form of testable explanations (hypotheses) that
can predict the results of future experiments. This allows scientists to gain an
understanding of reality, and later use that understanding to intervene in its causal
mechanisms (such as to cure disease).” The better an hypothesis is at making
predictions, the more useful it is, and the more likely it is to be correct. In the last
analysis, think of Hypotheses as educated guesses and think of Theories and/or Laws
as one or more experimentally supported hypothesis that everyone agrees should
serve as guideposts to help us evaluate new observations and hypotheses.
A good hypothesis is a rational guess that explains scientific observations or
experimental measurements. Therefore by definition, hypotheses are testable based
on predictions based on logic. Additional observation can refine or change the original
hypothesis, and/or lead to new hypothesis whose predictive value can also be tested.
If you get the impression that scientific discovery is a cyclic process, that’s the point!
Exploring scientific questions reveals more questions than answers!
We now recognize that a key component of the scientific method is the requirement
that the work of the scientist be disseminated by publication! In this way, shared data
and experimental methods can be repeated and evaluated by other scientists.
B. Origins of the Scientific Method
Long before the word scientist began to define someone who investigated natural
phenomena beyond simple observation (i.e., by doing experiments), philosophers
developed formal rules of deductive and inferential logic to try to understand nature,
humanity’s relationship to nature, and the relationship of humans to each other. In
fact, Boyle was not alone in doing experimental science. We therefore owe the logical
underpinnings of science to philosophers who came up with systems of deductive and
inductive logic so integral to the scientific method. The scientific method grew from

CMB3e

5

those beginnings, along with increasing empirical observation and experimentation.
We recognize these origins when we award the Ph.D. (Doctor of Philosophy), our
highest academic degree! We are about to learn about the life of cells, their structure
and function, and their classification, or grouping based on those structures and
functions. Everything we know about life comes from applying the principles of
scientific method.

III. Domains of Life
We believe with good reason that all life on earth evolved from a common ancestral cell
that existed soon after the origins of life on our planet. Too long ago, not all life was
divided into two groups: the true bacteria and everything else! Now we group life into one
of three domains:




Prokaryotes are among the first descendants of that common ancestral cell. They
lack nuclei (pro meaning before and karyon meaning kernel, or nucleus). They
include bacteria and cyanobacteria (blue-green algae).
Eukaryotes include all higher life forms, characterized by cells with true nuclei (Eu,
true; karyon, nucleus).
Archaebacteria, (meaning “old” bacteria) include many extremophile bacteria
(‘lovers’ of life at extreme high temperatures, salinity, etc.). Originally classified as
ancient prokaryotes, Archaebacteria were shown by 1990 to be separate from
prokaryotes and eukaryotes, a third domain of life.

The archaea are found in such inhospitable environments as boiling hot springs or arctic
ice, although some also live in conditions that are more temperate. Carl Woese
compared the DNA sequences of genes for ribosomal RNAs in normal bacteria and
extremophiles. Based on sequence similarities and differences, he concluded that the
latter are in fact a domain separate from the rest of the bacteria as well as from
eukaryotes. For a review, see (Woese, C. 2004; A new biology for a new century.
Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 68:173-186)
The three domains of life (Archaea, Eubacteria and Eukarya) quickly supplanted the
older division of living things into Five Kingdoms, the Monera (prokaryotes), Protista,
Fungi, Plants, and Animals (all eukaryotes!). In a final surprise, the sequences of
archaebacterial genes clearly indicate a common ancestry of archaea and eukarya.
Thus, Archaea are not true bacteria! They share genes and proteins as well as
metabolic pathways found in eukaryotes but not in bacteria, supporting their close
evolutionary relationship to eukaryotes. That they also contain genes and proteins as
well as metabolic pathways unique to the group is further testimony to their domain

CMB3e

status. Understanding that all living organisms belong to one of three domains has
dramatically changing our understanding of evolution. The evolution of the three domains
is illustrated below.

A. The Prokaryotes (Eubacteria = Bacteria and Cyanobacteria)
Prokaryotic cells lack a nucleus and other organelles such as mitochondria,
chloroplasts, endoplasmic reticulum, and assorted eukaryotic vesicles and internal
membranes. Bacteria do contain bacterial microcompartments (BMCs), but these are
made up entirely of protein and are not surrounded by a phospholipid membrane.
These function for example in CO2 fixation to sequester metabolites toxic to the cells.
Click Bacterial Organelles for more information. Bacteria are typically unicellular,
although a few (like some cyanobacteria) live colonial lives at least some of the time.
Transmission and scanning electron micrographs of rod-shaped bacteria are shown in
the example below at the left. A diagram of bacterial structure is also shown (right).

1. Bacterial Reproduction
Without the compartments afforded by the internal membrane systems common to
eukaryotic cells, intracellular chemistries, from DNA replication, transcription,
translation, and all the metabolic biochemistry of life, happen in the cytoplasm of
the cell. DNA is a circular double helix that duplicates as the cell grows. While not
enclosed in a nucleus, bacterial DNA is concentrated in a region of the cell called
the nucleoid. When not crowded at high density, bacteria replicate their DNA
throughout the life of the cell, dividing by binary fission. The result is the equal
partition of duplicated bacterial “chromosomes” into new cells. The bacterial
chromosome is essentially naked DNA, unassociated with proteins.
2. Cell Motility and the Possibility of a Cytoskeleton
Movement of bacteria is typically by chemotaxis, a response to environmental
chemicals. Some may respond to other stimuli such as light (phototaxy). They
can move to or away from nutrients, noxious/toxic substances, light, etc., and
achieve motility in several ways. For example, many move using flagella
made up largely of the protein flagellin. Flagellin is absent from eukaryotic cells.
On the other hand, the cytoplasm of eukaryotic cells is organized by a complex
cytoskeleton of rods and tubes made of actin and tubulin proteins. Prokaryotes
were long thought to lack these or similar cytoskeletal components. However, two
bacterial genes that encode proteins homologous to eukaryotic actin and tubulin
were recently discovered. The MreB protein forms a cortical ring in bacteria
undergoing binary fission, similar to the actin cortical ring that pinches dividing
eukaryotic cells during cytokinesis (the actual division of a single cell into two
smaller daughter cells). This is modeled below in the cross-section (right) near the
middle of a dividing bacterium (left).

The FtsZ gene encodes a homolog of tubulin proteins. It seems that together with
flagellin, the MreB and FtsZ proteins may be part of a primitive prokaryotic
cytoskeleton involved in cell structure and motility.
3. Some Bacteria Have Internal Membranes
While bacteria lack organelles (the membrane-bound structures of eukaryotic
cells), internal membranes in some bacteria form as inward extensions
(invaginations) of plasma membrane. Some of these capture energy from sunlight
(photosynthesis) or from inorganic molecules (chemolithotrophy). Carboxysomes
are membrane bound photosynthetic vesicles in which CO2 is fixed (reduced) in
cyanobacteria (shown below).

Photosynthetic bacteria have less elaborate internal membrane systems.
4. Bacterial Ribosomes Do the Same Thing as Eukaryotic Ribosomes… and
Look Like Them!
Ribosomes are the protein synthesizing machines of life. Ribosomes of
prokaryotes are smaller than those of eukaryotes, but are able to translate
eukaryotic messenger RNA (mRNA) in vitro. Underlying this common basic
function is the fact that the ribosomal RNAs of all species share base sequence
and structural similarities indicating a long evolutionary relationship. Recall
similarities revealed the closer relationship of archaea to eukarya than prokarya.
Clearly, the prokarya (Eubacteria) are a diverse group of organisms, occupying
almost every wet, dry, hot or cold nook and cranny of our planet. Despite this
diversity, all prokaryotic cells share many structural and functional metabolic
properties with each other… and with the archaea and eukaryotes! As we have
seen with ribosomes, shared structural and functional properties support the
common ancestry of all life. Finally, we not only share common ancestry with
prokaryotes, we even share living arrangements with them. Our gut bacteria
represent up to 10X more cells than our own! Read more at The NIH Human
Microbiome Project. Also check out the following link for A Relationship Between
Microbiomes, Diet and Disease.

B. The Archaebacteria (Archaea)
Allessandro Volta, a physicist who gave his name to the Volt, discovered methane
producing bacteria (methanogens) way back in 1776! He found them living in the
extreme environment at the bottom of Lago Maggiore, a lake shared by Italy and
Switzerland. These unusual bacteria are cheomoautotrophs that get energy from H2
and CO2 and also generate methane gas in the process. It was not until the 1960s
that Thomas Brock (from the University of Wisconsin-Madison) discovered
thermophilic bacteria living at temperatures approaching 100oC in Yellowstone
National Park in Wyoming. Organisms living in any extreme environment were soon
nicknamed extremophiles. One of the thermophilic bacteria, now called Thermus
aquaticus, became the source of Taq polymerase, the heat-stable DNA polymerase
that made the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) a household name in labs around the
world!
Extremophile and “normal” bacteria are similar in size and shape(s) and lack nuclei.
This initially suggested that most extremophiles were prokaryotes. But as Carl Woese
demonstrated, it is the archaea and eukarya that share a more recent common
ancestry! While some bacteria and eukaryotes can live in extreme environments, the
archaea include the most diverse extremophiles. Here are some examples of
extremophiles:

•
•
•

Acidophiles: grow at acidic (low) pH.
Alkaliphiles: grow at high pH.
Halophiles: require high salt concentrations; see Halobacterium salinarium below.

•

Methanogens: produce methane; a cross section of Methanosarcina acetivorans is
shown above (right). Note the absence of significant internal structure.

•
•
•

Barophiles: grow best at high hydrostatic pressure.

CMB3e

Psychrophiles: grow best at temperature 15 °C or lower.
Xerophiles: growth at very low water activity (drought or near drought conditions).

10

•

Thermophiles and hyperthermophiles: organisms that grow best at 40°C or higher,
or 80°C or higher, respectively. Pyrolobus fumarii, a hyperthermophile, can live at
a temperature 113°C. Another thermophile Thermus aquaticus, noted for its role in
developing the polymerase chain reaction, is shown below.

Thermus Aquaticus

•

Toxicolerants: grow in the presence of high levels of damaging elements (e.g.,
pools of benzene, nuclear waste).

Archaea were originally seen as oddities of life, thriving in unfriendly environments.
They also include organisms living in less extreme environments, including soils,
marshes and even in the human colon. They are also abundant in the oceans where
they are a major part of plankton, participating in the carbon and nitrogen cycles. In
the guts of cows, humans and other mammals, methanogens facilitate digestion,
generating methane gas in the process. In fact, cows have even been cited as a
major cause of global warming because of their prodigious methane emissions! On
the plus side, methanogenic Archaea are being exploited to create biogas and to treat
sewage. Other extremophiles are the source of enzymes that function at high
temperatures or in organic solvents. As already noted, some of these have become
part of the biotechnology toolbox.
C. The Eukaryotes
1. Large Compartmentalized Cells
The volume of a typical eukaryotic cell is some 1000 times that of a typical
bacterial cell. Eukaryotic life would not even have been possible if not for a
division of labor of eukaryotic cells among different organelles (membrane-bound
structures). Imagine a bacterium as a 100 square foot room (the size of a small
bedroom, or a large walk-in closet!) with one door. Now imagine a room 1000
times as big. That is, imagine a 100,000 square foot ‘room’. You would expect

CMB3e

11

many smaller rooms inside such a large space, each with its own door(s). The
eukaryotic cell is a lot like that large space, with lots of interior “rooms” (i.e.,
organelles) with their own entryways and exits. The smaller prokaryotic “room” has
a much larger plasma membrane surface area/volume ratio than a typical
eukaryotic cell, enabling required environmental chemicals to enter and quickly
diffuse throughout the cytoplasm of the bacterial cell. Chemical communication
between parts of a small cell is therefore rapid. In contrast, the communication
over a larger expanse of cytoplasm inside a eukaryotic cell requires the
coordinated activities of subcellular compartments. Such communication might be
relatively slow. In fact, eukaryotic cells have lower rates of metabolism, growth
and reproduction than do prokaryotic cells. The existence of large cells required
the evolution of a division of labor supported by compartmentalization. .
2. Animal and Plant Cell Structure Overview
Typical animal and plant cells with their organelles and other structures are
illustrated below.

CMB3e

Public Domain; From Mariana Ruiz, Image:Plant cell structure.svg, https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Plant_cell_structure-en.svg

A plasma (cell) membrane surrounds all cells. A cell wall further surrounds
prokaryotic, algal, fungal and plant cells, creating rigid structure around the cell
membrane and supporting cell shape. Bacterial cell walls are composed of
peptidoglycan, long polysaccharide chains attached to polypeptide (amino acid)
chains. Cellulose, hemicellulose, and pectin are major polysaccharides of the
plant cell wall. Fungal cells contain a wall, whose principal component is chitin.
Chitin is the same material that makes up the exoskeleton or arthropods (including
insects and lobsters!). Fungi, more closely related to animal than plant cells, are a
curious beast for a number of reasons! For one thing, the organization of fungi and
fungal cells is somewhat less defined than animal cells. Structures between cells
called septa separate fungal hyphae, allow passage of cytoplasm and even
organelles between cells. Some primitive fungi have few or no septa, in effect
creating coenocytes, which are single giant cells, with multiple nuclei.
We end this look at the domains of life by noting that, while eukaryotes are a tiny
minority of all living species, “their collective worldwide biomass is estimated at
about equal to that of prokaryotes” (Wikipedia). On the other hand, our bodies
contain 10 times as many microbial cells as human cells! In fact, it is becoming
increasingly clear that a human owes as much of its existence to its microbiota
(see above) as it does to its human cells. Keeping in mind that plants and animal
cells share many internal structures and organelles that perform the same or
similar functions, let’s look at them and briefly describe their functions.
CMB3e

IV. Tour of the Eukaryotic Cell
A. The Nucleus
The nucleus separates the genetic blueprint, i.e., DNA from the cell cytoplasm.
Although the eukaryotic nucleus breaks down during mitosis and meiosis as
chromosomes form and cells divide, it spends most of its time in interphase, the time
between cell divisions. This is where the status of genes (and therefore of the
proteins produced in the cell) is regulated. rRNA, tRNA and mRNA are transcribed
from genes, processed in the nucleus, and exported to the cytoplasm through nuclear
pores. Some other RNAs remain in the nucleus, typically participating in the
regulation of gene activity. In all organisms, dividing cells must produce and partition
copies of their duplicated genetic material equally between new daughter cells. Let’s
look first at the structural orgabno9zation of the nucleus, and then at its role in the
genetics of the cell and of the whole organism.
1. Structure of the Interphase Nucleus
The nucleus is the largest organelle in the cell. A typical electron microscope
image of a nucleus, the largest eukaryotic organelle in a cell, is shown below.

From Bergtrom eet al., (1977) J. Ultrastr. Res. 60:395-406:

This cross-section of an interphase nucleus reveals its double membrane, or
nuclear envelope. The outer membrane of the nuclear envelope is continuous
with the RER (rough endoplasmic reticulum). Thus, the lumen of the RER
iscontinuous with the space separating the nuclear envelope membranes. The
CMB3e

14

electron micrograph also shows a prominent nucleolus (labeled n) and a darkly
granular RER surrounding the nucleus. Zoom in on the micrograph; you may see
the double membrane of the nuclear envelope. You can also make out ribosomes
(small granules) bound to both the RER and the outer nuclear membrane. Nuclear
envelope pores (illustrated in the cartoon at the right) allow large molecules and
even particles to move in and out of the nucleus across both membranes.
104 The Nucleus
The nucleus is not an unorganized space surrounded by the nuclear envelope, as
seems to appear in the transmission electron micrographs. The nucleolus is just the
largest of several nuclear inclusions that seem to segregate nuclear functions.
Santiago Ramón y Cajal reported more structures in the nuclei of neurons more than
100 years ago, drawing his observations before modern photomicrographic
technology became widely available. See what he saw at Cajal's Nuclear Bodies,
including the nucleolus and what came to be known as Cajal bodies (CBs). As we
saw earlier, Ramón y Cajal shared the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine 1906
with Camillo Golgi for their studies of nerve cell structure. Check out a gallery of
Cajal’s hand-drawn micrographs of brain nerve cells in Cajal's Beautiful Brain Cells.
Later seen in an electron microscope, CBs look like coils of tangled thread, and were
thus called coiled bodies (conveniently, also CBs). Other nuclear bodies since
identified include Gems, PML bodies, nuclear speckles (or splicing speckles),
histone locus bodies (HLBs) …, and more! Different nuclear bodies turn out to be
associated with specific proteins. The localization of specific proteins to different
nuclear bodies can be seen in the immunofluorescence micrograph below.

CMB3e

15

Nucleoli contain fibrillarin proteins and stain red because they have been treated
with red-fluorescence-tagged antifibrillarin antibodies. CBs contain the protein
coilin. They fluoresce pink because the nuclei were treated with fluorescencetagged anticoilin antibodies. Green-fluorescent antibodies to the ASF/SF2 protein
localize to nuclear speckles. As part of, or included in a nuclear matrix, nuclear
bodies organize and regulate different aspects of nuclear activity and molecular
function. The different nuclear bodies perform specific functions and interact with
each other and with proteins DNA and RNA to do so. We will revisit some nuclear
bodies in their working context in later chapters.
2. Every Cell (i.e., Every Nucleus) of an Organism Contains the Same Genes
We read earlier that bacteria are busy doubling and partitioning their naked DNA
chromosomes at the same time as they grow and divide by binary fission. In
eukaryotic cells, a cell cycle divides life into discrete consecutive events. During
most of the cell cycle, cells are in interphase and DNA is wrapped up in proteins in
a structure called chromatin. It is not merely the DNA, but chromatin that must be
duplicated when cells reproduce. Duplication of DNA involves rearranging
chromatin proteins. This occurs before cell division (mitosis and cytokinesis).
As the time of cell division nears, chromatin associates with even more proteins,
condensing to form chromosomes, while the nuclear envelope dissolves.
You may recall that every somatic cell of an organism contains paired homologous
chromosomes, and therefore two copies of every gene an organism owns. On the
other hand, sperm and eggs contain one of each pair of chromosomes, and thus
one copy of each gene. Whether by mitosis or meiosis, cytokinesis separates
duplicated chromosomes to daughter cells. In the fluorescence micrograph of a
cell in the metaphase stage of mitosis (below), the chromosomes (blue) are just
about to be pulled apart by microtubules of the spindle apparatus (green).

CMB3e

16

As the chromosomes separate and daughter cells form, nuclei reappear and
chromosomes de-condense. These events mark the major visible difference
between cell division in bacteria and eukaryotes. Cytokinesis begins near the end
of mitosis. Sexual reproduction, a key characteristic of eukaryotes, involves
meiosis rather than mitosis. The mechanism of meiosis, the division of germ cells
leading to production of sperm and eggs, is similar to mitosis except that the
ultimate daughter cells have just one each of the parental chromosomes,
eventually to become the gametes (eggs or sperm).
A key take-home message here is that every cell in a multicellular organism,
whether egg, sperm or somatic, contains the same genome (genes) in its nucleus.
This was understood since mitosis and meiosis were first described in the late 19th
century. However, it was finally demonstrated in 1962, when John Gurdon and
Shinya Yamanaka transplanted nuclei from the intestinal cells the frog Xenopus
laevis into enucleated eggs (eggs from which its own nucleus had been removed).
These ‘eggs’ grew and developed into normal tadpoles, proving that no genes are
lost during development, but just expressed differentially.
We will revisit animal cloning later in this book. But for now, it’s sufficient to know
that Molly the cloned frog was followed in 1996 by Dolly, the first cloned sheep,
and then other animals, all cloned from enucleated eggs transplanted with
differentiated cell nuclei. Click Cloning Cuarteterra for the 60 Minutes story of the
cloning of Cuarteterra, a champion polo mare whose clones are also champions!
For their first animal cloning experiments, Gurdon and Yamanaka shared the 2012
Nobel Prize form Physiology or medicine.
B. Ribosomes
On the other end of the size spectrum, ribosomes are evolutionarily conserved protein
synthesizing machines in all cells. They consist of a large and a small subunit, each
made up of multiple proteins and one or more molecules of ribosomal RNA (rRNA).
Ribosomes bind to messenger RNA (mRNA) molecules, moving along the mRNA as
they translate 3-base code words (codons) to link amino acids into polypeptides.
Multiple ribosomes can move along the same mRNA, becoming a polyribosome, or
polysome simultaneously translating the same polypeptide encoded by the mRNA.
The granular appearance of cytoplasm in electron micrographs is largely due to the
ubiquitous distribution of ribosomal subunits and polysomes in cells.

CMB3e

17

The illustration below shows a polyribosome as a ‘string’ of ribosomes,

Illustration by G. Bergtrom

In the illustration, ribosomes assemble at the left of the messenger RNA (mRNA) to
form the polysome. When they reach the end of the message, the ribosomes
disassemble from the RNA and release the finished polypeptide.
In an electron micrograph of leaf cells from a quiescent desiccated dessert plant,
Selaginella lepidophylla, you can make out randomly distributed ribosomes and
ribosomal subunits (arrows, below left). In cells from a fully hydrated plant, you can
see polysomes as more organized strings of ribosomes (arrows, below right).

From Bergtrom et al. (1982) J. Ultrastr. Res. 78:269-282. Research by G. Bergtrom

Eukaryotic and prokaryotic ribosomes differ in the number of RNA and proteins in their
large and small subunits, and thus in their overall size. Isolated ribosomes centrifuged
in a sucrose density gradient move at a rate based on their size (or more specifically,
their mass).
CMB3e

18

The illustration below shows the difference in ribosomal ‘size’, their protein
composition and the number and sizes of their ribosomal RNAs.

Illustration by G. Bergtrom

The position of ribosomal subunits in the gradient is represented by an S value, after
Svedborg, who first used sucrose density gradients to separate macromolecules and
particles by mass. Note that the ribosomal RNAs themselves also separate on
sucrose density gradients by size, hence their different S values.
101 Ribosomes & Polysomes
C. Internal membranes and the Endomembrane System
Microscopists of the 19th century saw many of these structures using the art of
histology, staining cells to increase the visual contrast between cell parts. One of
these, Camillo Golgi, an early neurobiologist, developed a silver (black) stain that
first detected a network of vesicles we now call Golgi bodies (Golgi vesicles) in nerve
cells. For their discoveries in cellular neuroscience, Golgi and Santiago Ramón y
Cajal shared the 1906 Nobel prize for Medicine or Physiology.

CMB3e

19

Many vesicles and vacuoles in cells, including Golgi vesicles, are part of the
endomembrane system. Proteins synthesized on the ribosomes of the RER (rough
endoplasmic reticulum) can enter the interior space (lumen) or can become part of
the RER membrane itself. Production of RER, SER (smooth endoplasmic
reticulum), Golgi bodies, lysosomes, microbodies and other vesicular membranes,
as well as their protein content all begin in the RER. The RER and protein contents
bud into transport vesicles that fuse with Golgi Vesicles (G in the electron micrograph
below).

Adapted from Bergtrom and Robinson (1977) J. Ultrastr. Res. 60:395-405. Research by G. Bergtrom

In their journey through the endomembrane system, packaged proteins undergo
stepwise modifications (maturation) before becoming biologically active (below).

Illustration by G. Bergtrom

102 Golgi Vesicles & the Endomembrane System
Some proteins made in the endomembrane system are secreted by exocytosis.
Others end up in organelles like lysosomes that contain hydrolytic enzymes. These
enzymes are activated when the lysosomes fuse with other organelles destined for
degradation. Food vacuoles form when a plasma membrane invaginates, engulfing
food particles. They then fuse with lysosomes to digest the engulfed nutrients.
CMB3e

20

Autophagosomes are small vesicles that surround and eventually encapsulate tired
organelles (for example, worn out mitochondria), eventually merging with lysosomes
whose enzymes degrade their contents. In 2016, Yoshinori Ohsumi earned the Nobel
Prize in Physiology and Medicine for nearly 30 years of research unraveling the cell
and molecular biology of autophagy. Microbodies are a class of vesicles smaller
than lysosomes, but formed by a similar process. Among them are peroxisomes that
break down toxic peroxides formed as a by-product of cellular biochemistry. Some
vesicles emerging from the RER will become part of the SER, which has several
different functions (e.g., alcohol detoxification in liver cells).
103 Smooth Endoplasmic Reticulum
Other organelles include the contractile vacuoles of freshwater protozoa that expel
excess water that enters cells by osmosis. Some protozoa have extrusomes,
vacuoles that release chemicals or structures that deter predators or enable prey
capture. A large aqueous central vacuole dominates the volume of many higher plant
cells. When filled with water, they will push all other structures against the plasma
membrane. In a properly watered plant, this water-filled vacuole exerts osmotic
pressure that among other things, keeps plant leaves from wilting and stems upright.
D. Mitochondria and Plastids
Nearly all eukaryotic cells contain mitochondria, shown below.

A double membrane surrounds the mitochondrion. Each contains and replicates its
own DNA containing genes encoding some mitochondrial proteins. Note that the
surface area of the inner mitochondrial membrane is increased by being folded into
cristae, which are sites of cellular respiration (aerobic nutrient oxidation).
Earlier, we speculated eukaryotic organelles that could have originated within bacteria.
Mitochondria most likely evolved from a complete aerobic bacterium (or protobacterium) that was engulfed by a primitive eukaryotic cell. The bacterium escaped
destruction, becoming an endosymbiont in the host cell cytoplasm. Lynn Margulis first
proposed the Endosymbiotic Theory (Margulis, L. [Sagan, L], 1967. On the origin of
mitosing cells. Journal of Theoretical Biology 14 (3): 225–274; available at: Margulis L.
Endosymbiotic theory). Margulis proposed that chloroplasts also started as
endosymbionts. Like mitochondria, the plastids of plants and some algae have their
own DNA, most likely originating as cyanobacteria engulfed by primitive eukaryotic
cells. Living in symbiosis with the rest of the cell, they would eventually evolve into
plastids, including chloroplasts. Detailed evidence for the Endosymbiotic Theory is
discussed elsewhere.
A handful of protozoa were found lacking mitochondria and other organelles. This had
suggested they might share ancestry with those primitive eukaryotes that acquired
mitochondria by endosymbiosis. However, since such cells contain other organelles
such as hydrogenosomes and mitosomes, it is thought more likely that these species
once had, but then lost mitochondria. Therefore, descendants of ancient eukaryotic
cells missing mitochondria probably no longer exist.
Chloroplasts and cyanobacteria contain chlorophyll and use a similar photosynthetic
mechanism to make glucose. A typical chloroplast is shown in the micrograph below
(left). A chloroplast beginning to store nutrient sugar as starch is at the right.

105 Endosymbiosis-Mitochondria & Chloroplasts
E. Cytoskeletal structures
We have come to understand that the cytoplasm of a eukaryotic cell is highly
structured, permeated by rods and tubules. The three main components of this
cytoskeleton are microfilaments, intermediate filaments and microtubules.
Microtubules are composed of  and -tubulin protein monomers. Monomeric actin
proteins make up microfilaments. Intermediate filament proteins are related to keratin,
a protein found in hair, fingernails, bird feathers, etc. Cytoskeletal rods and tubules
not only determine cell shape, but also play a role in cell motility. This includes the
movement of cells from place to place and the movement of structures within cells.

CMB3e

23

We have already noted that a prokaryotic cytoskeleton is composed in part of proteins
homologous to actins and tubulins. As in a eukaryotic cytoskeleton, these bacterial
proteins may play a role in maintaining or changing cell shape. On the other hand,
flagellum-powered movement in bacteria relies on flagellin, a protein not found in
eukaryotic cells. A bacterial flagellum is actually a rigid hook-like structure attached to
a molecular motor in the cell membrane that spins to propel the bacterium through a
liquid medium.
In contrast, eukaryotic microtubules slide past one another causing a more flexible
flagellum to undulate in wave-like motions. Likewise, the motion of a eukaryotic cilium
is based on sliding microtubules, in this case causing the cilia to beat rather than
undulate. Cilia are involved not only in motility, but also in feeding and sensation.
The structures and assembly of the main cytoskeletal components are shown below.

Microtubules in eukaryotic flagella and cilia arise from a basal body (similar to
kinetosomes or centrioles). Aligned in a flagellum or cilium, microtubules form an
axoneme surrounded by plasma membrane. In electron micrographs of cross
sections, a ciliary or flagellar axoneme is typically organized as a ring of nine paired
microtubules (called doublets) around two singlet microtubules (illustrated below).

Illustration by G. Bergtrom

Centrioles are themselves comprised of a ring of microtubules. In animal cells they
participate in spindle fiber formation during mitosis and are the point from which
microtubules radiate thorough the cell to help form and maintain its shape. These
structures do not involve axonemes. The spindle apparatus in plant cells, which
typically lack centrioles, form from an amorphous structure called the MTOC, or
MicroTubule Organizing Center, which serves the same purpose in mitosis and
meiosis as centrioles do in animal cells.
106 Filaments & Tubules of the Cytoskeleton
Elsewhere, we describe how microfilaments and microtubules interact with motor
proteins (dynein, kinesin, myosin, etc.) to generate force that results in the sliding of
filaments and tubules to allow cellular movement. You will see that motor proteins can
also carry cargo molecules from one place to another in a cell.

V. How We Know the Functions of Cellular Organelles and
Structures: Cell Fractionation
We can see and describe cell parts in the light or electron microscope, but we could not
definitively know their function until it became possible to release them from cells and
separate them from one another. This became possible with the advent of

CMB3e

25

differential centrifugation. Under centrifugal force generated by a spinning centrifuge,
subcellular structures separate by differences in mass. Structures that are more massive
reach the bottom of the centrifuge tube before less massive ones. A cell fractionation
scheme is illustrated below. Biochemical analysis of the isolated cell fractions can reveal
what different organelles and cellular substructures do.

Illustration by G. Bergtrom

107 Dissecting the Cell; a Cell Fractionation Scheme
Cell fractionation separates cells into their constituent parts. The first step of a cell
fractionation is to break open the cells and release their contents. This can be done by
physical means such as grinding in a mortar and pestle, tissue grinder or similar
device, exposure to ultrasound or high pressure, or exposure to enzymes or other
chemicals that can selectively degrade the plasma membrane. The next step is to isolate
the subcellular organelles and particles from the cytoplasm (i.e., cytosol) by differential
centrifugation. As noted, centrifugation of broken cells at progressively higher centrifugal
force separates particulate cell components based on their mass. At the end of this
process, a researcher will have isolated mitochondria, chloroplasts, nuclei, ribosomes
etc. After re-suspension, each pellet can be re-suspended and prepared for microscopy.

Can you tell what organelles have been purified in each of these fractions based on the
electron micrographs alone? Consider the structures on the left as an example. These
were found in a low speed centrifugal pellet, implying that they are large structures. They
look a bit like nuclei, which are also the largest structures in a eukaryotic cell. What
biochemical or functional tests might you do to confirm that the four structures shown
from left to right are isolated nuclei, rough endoplasmic reticulum, Golgi vesicles and
mitochondria? Physical separation combined with biochemical-molecular analysis of
subcellular structures has revealed their basic functions and continue to reveal previously
un-noticed structures and functions in cells.

All of cell and molecular biology is devoted to understanding how prokaryotic and
eukaryotic cells (and organisms) use their common structural and biochemical inheritance
to meet very different survival strategies. As you progress in your studies, watch for
experiments in which cell parts are separated and reassembled, or reconstituted.
Reconstitution is one of the recurring experimental themes involving the functional
analysis of cell components. Look for this theme as you continue your studies. Look also
for another theme, namely how evolution can account for the common biochemistry and
genetics of life…, and its structural diversity!

VI. The Origins, Evolution, Speciation, Diversity and Unity of Life
The question of how life began has been with us since the beginnings or recorded history.
It is now accepted that there was a time, however brief or long, when the earth was a
lifeless (prebiotic) planet. Life’s origins on earth date to some 3.7-4.1 billion years ago
under conditions that favored the formation of the first cell, the first entity with all of the
properties of life. But couldn’t those same conditions have spawned multiple cells
independently, each with all of the properties of life? If so, from which of these did life, as
we know it today, descend? Whether there were one or more different “first cells”,
evolution (a property of life) only began with those cells.
115 Properties of Life
The fact that there is no evidence of cells of independent origin may reflect that they
never existed. Alternatively, the cell we call our ancestor was evolutionarily successful at
the expense of other life forms, which thus became extinct. In any event, whatever this
successful ancestor may have looked like, its descendants would have evolved quite
different appearances, chemistries and physiologies. These descendant cells would have
found different genetic and biochemical solutions to achieving and maintaining life’s
properties. One of these descendants evolved the solutions we see in force in all cells
and organisms alive today, including a common (universal) genetic code to store life’s
information, as well as a common mechanism for retrieving the
encoded information. Francis Crick called is commonality the “Central Dogma” of biology.
That ancestral cell is called our Last Universal Common Ancestor, or LUCA.
116 The Universal Genetic Code

117 Origins of Life

118 Life Origins vs Evolution

CMB3e

Elsewhere we consider in more detail how we think about the origins of life. For now, our
focus is on evolution, the property of life that is the basis of speciation and life’s diversity.
Natural selection was Charles Darwin’s theory for how evolution led to the structural

diversity of species. New species arise when beneficial traits are naturally selected from
genetically different individuals in a population, with the concomitant culling of less fit
individuals from populations over time. If natural selection acts on individuals, evolution
results from the persistence and spread of selected, heritable changes through
successive generations in a population. Evolution is reflected as an increase in diversity
and complexity at all levels of biological organization, from species to individual
organisms to molecules. For an easy read about the evolution of eyes (whose very
existence according to creationists could only have formed by intelligent design by a
creator), see the article in National Geographic by E. Yong (Feb., 2016, with beautiful
photography by D. Littschwager).
Repeated speciation occurs with the continual divergence of life forms from an ancestral
cell through natural selection and evolution. Our shared cellular structures, nucleic acid,
protein and metabolic chemistries (the ‘unity’ of life) supports our common ancestry with
all life. These shared features date back to our LUCA! Most living things even share
some early behaviors. Take our biological clock, an adaptation to our planet’s 24 hour
daily cycles of light and dark that have been around since the origins of life; all organisms
studied so far seem to have one!. The discovery of the genetic and molecular
underpinnings of circadian rhythms (those daily cycles) earned Jeffrey C. Hall, Michael
Rosbash and Michael W. Young the 2017 Nobel Prize in Medicine or Physiology (click
Molecular Studies of Circadian Rhythms wins Nobel Prize to learn more)!
The molecular relationships common to all living things largely confirm what we have
learned from the species represented in the fossil record. Morphological, biochemical
and genetic traits that are shared across species are defined as homologous, and can
be used to reconstruct evolutionary histories. The biodiversity that scientists (in
particular, environmentalists) try to protect is the result of millions of years of
speciation and extinction. Biodiversity needs protection from the unwanted acceleration
of evolution arising from human activity, including blatant extinctions (think passenger
pigeon), and near extinctions (think American bison by the late 1800s). Think also of the
consequences the introduction of invasive aquatic and terrestrial species and the effects
of climate change.
Let’s look at the biochemical and genetic unity among livings things. We’ve already
considered what happens when cells get larger in evolution when we tried to explain how
larger cells divided their labors among smaller intracellular structures and organelles.
When eukaryotic cells evolved into multicellular organisms, it became necessary for the
different cells to communicate with each other and to respond to environmental cues.

CMB3e

29

Some cells evolved mechanisms to “talk” directly to adjacent cells and others evolved to
transmit electrical (neural) signals to other cells and tissues. Still other cells produced
hormones to communicate with cells to which they had no physical attachment. As
species diversified to live in very different habitats, they also evolved very different
nutritional requirements, along with more extensive and elaborate biochemical pathways
to digest their nutrients and capture their chemical energy. Nevertheless, despite billions
of years of obvious evolution and astonishing diversification, the underlying genetics and
biochemistry of living things on this planet is remarkably unchanged. Early in the 20th
century, Albert Kluyver first recognized that cells and organisms vary in form appearance
in spite of the essential biochemical unity of all organisms (see Albert Kluyver in
Wikipedia). This unity amidst the diversity of life is a paradox of life that we will probe
further in this course.
A. Genetic Variation, the Basis of Natural Selection
DNA contains the genetic instructions for the structure and function of cells and
organisms. When and where a cell or organism’s genetic instructions are used (i.e., to
make RNA and proteins) are regulated. Genetic variation results from random
mutations. Genetic diversity arising from mutations is in turn, the basis of natural
selection during evolution.
119 The Random Basis of Evolution
B. The Genome: An Organism’s Complete Genetic Instructions
We’ve seen that every cell of an organism carries the DNA including gene sequences
and other kinds of DNA. The genome of an organism is the entirety of its genetic
material (DNA, or for some viruses, RNA). The genome of a common experimental
strain of E. coli was sequenced by 1997 (Blattner FR et al. 1997The complete genome
sequence of Escherichia coli K-12. Science 277:1452-1474). Sequencing of the
human genome was completed by 2001, well ahead of the predicted schedule (Venter
JC 2001The sequence of the human genome. Science 291:1304-1351). As we have
seen in the re-classification of life from five kingdoms into three domains, nucleic acid
sequence comparisons can tell us a great deal about evolution. We now know that
evolution depends not only on gene sequences, but also, on a much grander scale, on
the structure of genomes. Genome sequencing has confirmed not only genetic
variation between species, but also considerable variation between individuals of the
same species. Genetic variation within species is in fact the raw material of evolution.
It is clear from genomic studies that genomes have been shaped and modeled (or
remodeled) in evolution. We’ll consider genome remodeling in more detail elsewhere.

CMB3e

30

C. Genomic ‘Fossils’ Can Confirm Evolutionary relationships.
It had been known for some time that gene and protein sequencing could reveal
evolutionary relationships and even familial relationships. Read about an early
demonstration of such relationships based on amino acid sequence comparisons
across evolutionary time in Zuckerkandl E and Pauling L. (1965) Molecules as
documents of evolutionary theory. J. Theor. Biol. 8:357-366. It is now possible to
extract DNA from fossil bones and teeth, allowing comparisons of extant and extinct
species. DNA has been extracted from the fossil remains of humans, other hominids,
and many animals. DNA sequencing reveals our relationship to each other, to our
hominid ancestors and to animals from bugs to frogs to mice to chimps to
Neanderthals to… Unfortunately, DNA from organisms much older than 10,000 years
is typically so damaged or simply absent, that relationship building beyond that time is
impossible. Now in a clever twist, using what we know from gene sequences of
species alive today, investigators recently ‘constructed’ a genetic phylogeny
suggesting the sequences of genes of some of our long-gone progenitors, including
bacteria (click here to learn more: Deciphering Genomic Fossils). The comparison of
these ‘reconstructed’ ancestral DNA sequences suggests when photosynthetic
organisms diversified and when our oxygenic planet became a reality.

VII. Microscopy Reveals Life’s Diversity of Structure and Form
Broadly speaking, there are two kinds of microscopy. In Light Microscopy, the specimen
on the slide is viewed through optical glass lenses. In Electron Microscopy, the viewer is
looking at an image on a screen created by electrons passing through, or reflected from
the specimen. For a sampling of light and electron micrographs, check out this Gallery of
Micrographs. Here we compare and contrast different microscopic techniques.
A. Light Microscopy
Historically one form or other of light microscopy has revealed much of what we know
of cellular diversity. Check out the Drawings of Mitosis for a reminder of how
eukaryotic cells divide and then check out The Optical Microscope for descriptions of
different variations of light microscopy (e.g., bright-field, dark field, phase-contrast,
fluorescence, etc.). Limits of magnification and resolution of 1200X and 2 m,
(respectively) are common to all forms of light microscopy. The main variations of light
microscopy are briefly described below.

CMB3e

31

1. Bright-Field microscopy is the most common kind of light microscopy, in which the
specimen is illuminated from below. Contrast between regions of the specimen
comes from the difference between light absorbed by the sample and light passing
through it. Live specimens lack contrast in conventional bright-field microscopy
because differences in refractive index between components of the specimen (e.g.,
organelles and cytoplasm in cells) diffuse the resolution of the magnified image.
This is why Bright-Field microscopy is best suited to fixed and stained specimens.
2. In Dark-field illumination, light passing through the center of the specimen is
blocked and the light passing through the periphery of the beam is diffracted
(“scattered”) by the sample. The result is enhanced contrast for certain kinds of
specimens, including live, unfixed and unstained ones.
3. In Polarized light microscopy, light is polarized before passing through the
specimen, allowing the investigator to achieve the highest contrast by rotating the
plane of polarized light passing through the sample. Samples can be unfixed,
unstained or even live.
4. Phase-Contrast or Interference microscopy enhances contrast between parts of a
specimen with higher refractive indices (e.g., cell organelles) and lower refractive
indices (e.g., cytoplasm). Phase–Contrast microscopy optics shift the phase of the
light entering the specimen from below by a half a wavelength to capture small
differences in refractive index and thereby increase contrast. Phase–Contrast
microscopy is a most cost-effective tool for examining live, unfixed and unstained
specimens.
5. In a fluorescence microscope, short wavelength, high-energy (usually UV) light is
passed through a specimen that has been treated with a fluorescing chemical
covalently attached to other molecules (e.g., antibodies) that fluoresces when
struck by the light source. This fluorescent tag was chosen to recognize and bind
specific molecules or structures in a cell. Thus, in fluorescence microscopy, the
visible color of fluorescence marks the location of the target molecule/structure in
the cell.
6. Confocal microscopy is a variant of fluorescence microscopy that enables imaging
through thick samples and sections. The result is often 3D-like, with much greater
depth of focus than other light microscope methods. Click at Gallery of Confocal
Microscopy Images to see a variety of confocal micrographs and related images;
look mainly at the specimens.
7. Lattice Light-Sheet Microscopy is a 100 year old variant of light microscopy that
allows us to follow subcellular structures and macromolecules moving about in
living cells. It was recently applied to follow the movement and sub-cellular cellular
location of RNA molecules associated with proteins in structures called RNA
granules (check it out at RNA Organization in a New Light).

CMB3e

32

B. Electron Microscopy
Unlike light (optical) microscopy, electron microscopy generates an image by passing
electrons through, or reflecting electrons from a specimen, and capturing the electron
image on a screen. Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) can achieve much
higher magnification (up to 106X) and resolution (2.0 nm) than any form of optical
microscopy! Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) can magnify up to 105X with a
resolution of 3.0-20.0 nm. TEM, together with biochemical and molecular biological
studies, continues to reveal how different cell components work with each other. The
higher voltage in High Voltage Electron microscopy is an adaptation that allows TEM
through thicker sections than regular (low voltage) TEM. The result is micrographs
with greater resolution, depth and contrast. SEM allows us to examine the surfaces of
tissues, small organisms like insects, and even of cells and organelles. Check this link
to Scanning Electron Microscopy for a description of scanning EM, and look at the
gallery of SEM images at the end of the entry.

I.

Introduction

In this chapter, we start with a review basic chemistry from atomic structure to
molecular bonds to the structure and properties of water, followed by a review of key
principles of organic chemistry - the chemistry of carbon-based molecules. You may find
it useful to have your old general chemistry textbook handy, or check out the excellent
introduction to general chemistry by Linus Pauling (1988, General Chemistry New York,
Springer-Verlag). We’ll see how the polar covalent bonds define the structure and
explain virtually all of properties of water. These range from the energy required to melt
a gram of ice to vaporize a gram of water to its surface tension to its ability to hold heat…,
not to mention its ability to dissolve a wide variety of solutes from salts to proteins and
other macromolecules. We will distinguish water’s hydrophilic interactions with solutes
from its hydrophobic interactions with fatty molecules. Then, we review some basic
biochemistry. Well-known biological molecules include monomers (sugars, amino acids,
nucleotides, lipids…) and polymers (polysaccharides, proteins, nucleic acids, fats…).
Biochemical reactions that link glucose monomers into polymers on the one hand, and
break the polymers down on the other are essential reactions for life on earth.
Photosynthetic organisms link glucose monomers into starch, a polysaccharide. Amylose
is a simple starch, a large homopolymer of repeating glucose monomers. Likewise,
polypeptides are heteropolymers of 20 different amino acids. DNA and RNA nucleic
acids are also heteropolymers, made using only four different nucleotides.
When you eat, digestive enzymes in your gut catalyze the hydrolysis of the plant or
animal polymers we ate back down to monomers. Hydrolysis adds a water molecule
across the bonds linking the monomers in the polymer. Our cells then take up the
monomers. Once in our cells, condensation (dehydration synthesis) reactions
remove water molecules from participating monomers to grow new polymers that are
more useful to us. While they are not, strictly speaking, macromolecules, triglycerides
(fats) and phospholipids are also broken down by hydrolysis and synthesized in
condensation reactions. Triglycerides are energy-rich molecules, while phospholipids
(chemical relatives of triglycerides) are the basis of cellular membrane structure.

CMB3e

35

Relatively weak interactions between macromolecules, for example, hydrogen bonds
(H-bonds), electrostatic interactions, Van der Waals forces, etc., hold many cellular
structures and molecules together. Individually, these bonds are weak. But millions of
them hold can the two complementary DNA strands tightly in a stable double helix. We
will see this theme of strength in numbers repeated in other molecular and cellular
structures. Monomers also serve other purposes related to energy metabolism, cell
signaling etc. Depending on your chemistry background, you may find “Googling” these
subjects interesting and useful. The short VOPs in this chapter might help as a guide to
understanding the basic chemistry and biochemistry presented here.
Learning Objectives
When you have mastered the information in this chapter, you should be able to:
1. compare and contrast the definitions of atom, element and molecule.
2. List differences between atoms, elements and molecules and between energy and
position-based atomic models.

7. distinguish polar and non-polar covalent bonds and their physical-chemical properties.
8. predict the behavior of electrons in compounds held together by ionic interactions.
9. explain how the properties of water account for the solubility of salts and
macromolecules and the role of H-bonds in support those properties.
10. consider why some salts are not soluble in water in terms of water’s properties.
11. describe how molecular linkages form during polymer metabolism and place hydrolytic
and dehydration synthetic reactions in a metabolic context.
12. distinguish between chemical “bonds” and “linkages” in polymers.
13. categorize different chemical bonds based on their strengths.

II.

Atoms and Basic Chemistry

A. Overview of Elements and Atoms
The difference between elements and atoms is often confused in casual
conversation. Both terms describe matter, substances with mass. Different elements
are different kinds of matter distinguished by different physical and chemical
properties. In turn, the atom is the fundamental unit of matter…, that is, of an element.

CMB3e

36

The number of positively charged protons and neutral neutrons in an atomic nucleus
account for most of the mass of an atom. Each negatively charged electron that
orbits a nucleus is about 1/2000th of the mass of a proton or neutron. Thus, they do
not add much to the mass of an atom. Electrons stay in atomic orbits because of
electromagnetic forces, i.e., their attraction to the positively charged nuclei. Nuclear
size (mass) and the cloud of electrons around its nucleus define structure of an atom.
And that structure dictates the different properties of the elements.
Recall that atoms are chemically most stable when they are electrically uncharged,
with an equal number of protons and electrons. Isotopes of the same element are
atoms with the same number of protons and electrons, but a different number of
neutrons. Therefore, isotopes are also chemically stable, but they may not be
physically stable. For example, the most abundant isotope of hydrogen contains one
proton, one electron and no neutrons. The nucleus of the deuterium isotope of
hydrogen contains one neutron and that of tritium contains two neutrons. Both
isotopes can be found in water molecules. Deuterium is stable. In contrast, the
tritium atom is radioactive, subject to nuclear decay over time. Whether physically
stable or not, all isotopes of an element share the same chemical and electromagnetic
properties and behave the same way in chemical reactions.
The electromagnetic forces that keep electrons orbiting their nuclei allow the formation
of chemical bonds in molecules. We model atoms to illustrate the average physical
location of electrons (the orbital model) on one hand, and their potential energy
levels (the Bohr, or shell model) on the other. Look at the models for helium
illustrated below.
Illustration by G. Bergtrom

CMB3e

37

Up to two electrons move in a space defined as an orbital. In addition to occupying
different areas around the nucleus, electrons exist at different energy levels, moving
with different kinetic energy. Electrons can also absorb or lose energy, jumping or
falling from one energy level to another.
A unique atomic number (number of protons) and atomic mass (usually measured in
Daltons, or Da) characterize different elements. A unique symbol with a
superscripted atomic number and a subscripted atomic mass number defines each
element. Take the most common isotope of carbon (C) for example. Its atomic
number is 6 (the number of protons in its nucleus) and its mass is 12 Da (6 protons
and 6 neutrons at 1 Da each!). Remember that the mass of the electrons in a carbon
(C) atom is negligible!
Find the C atom and look at some of the other atoms of elements in the partial
periodic table below.

Illustration by G. Bergtrom

CMB3e

38

This partial periodic table shows the elements essential for all life in greater or lesser
amounts, as well as some that may also be essential in humans.
122 Atoms and Elements
B. Electron Configuration – Shells and Subshells
The Bohr model of the atom reveals how electrons can absorb and release energy.
The shells indicate the energy levels of electrons. Electrons can absorb different
kinds of energy (radiation, light, electrical). For example, beaming UV light at atoms
can excite electrons. If an electron absorbs a full quantum of energy (or a photon of
radiant energy), it will be boosted from the ground state (the shell it normally
occupies) into a higher shell, an excited state. Excited electrons move at greater
speed around the nucleus, with more kinetic energy than it did at ground. Excited
electrons also have more potential energy than ground state electrons. This is
because they are unstable, releasing some of the energy gained during excitation as
they return to ground, i.e., their starting energy level (shell), as shown below.

Illustration by G. Bergtrom

CMB3e

39

Electrons falling back to ground typically release excitation energy as heat. Atoms
whose excited electrons release their energy as light fluoresce; they are fluorescent.
A fluorescent light is an example of this phenomenon; electrical energy excites
electrons out of atomic orbitals in molecules coating the interior surface of the bulb.
As all those excited electrons return to ground state, they fluoresce, releasing light.
These atoms can be repeatedly excited by electricity. As we shall see, biologists and
chemists have turned fluorescence into tools of biochemistry, molecular biology and
microscopy. The ground state is also called the resting state, but electrons at ground
are by no means resting! They just move with less kinetic energy excited electrons.
123 Electron Energy & Fluorescence

III. Chemical bonds
Atoms form bonds to make molecules. Covalent bonds are strong. They can involve
unequal or equal sharing of a pair of electrons, leading to polar covalent bonds and
non-polar covalent bonds respectively. Ionic bonds are weaker than covalent bonds,
created by electrostatic interactions between elements that can gain or lose electrons.
Hydrogen (H-) bonds are in a class by themselves! These electrostatic interactions
account for the physical and chemical properties of water. They are also involved in
interactions between and within other molecules. While atoms can share, gain or lose
electrons in chemical reactions, they will neither gain nor lose protons or neutrons. Let’s
look more closely at chemical bonds and how even the weak bonds are essential to life.
A. Covalent Bonds
Electrons are shared in covalent bonds. Hydrogen gas (H2) is a molecule, not an
atom! H atoms in the H2 molecule share their electrons equally. Likewise, the carbon
atom in methane (CH4) shares electrons equally with four hydrogen atoms. The equal
sharing of electrons in non-polar covalent bonds in H2 and CH4 is shown below.

Illustration by G. Bergtrom

CMB3e

40

A single pair of electrons in H2 forms the covalent bond between two H atoms in the
hydrogen molecule. In methane, the carbon (C) atom has four electrons in its outer
shell that it can share. Each H atom has a single electron to share. If the C atom
shares its four electrons with the four electrons in the four H atoms, there will be four
paired electrons (8 electrons in all) moving in filled orbitals around the nucleus of the C
atom some of the time, and one pair moving around each of the H atomic nuclei some
of the time. Thus, the outer shell of the C atom and each of the H atoms are filled at
least some of the time. This stabilizes the molecule. Recall that atoms are most
stable when their outer shells are filled and when each electron orbital is filled (i.e.,
with a pair of electrons).
Polar covalent bonds form when electrons in a molecule are shared unequally. This
happens if the atomic nuclei in a molecule are very different in size. This is the case
with water, shown below.

-

The paired e s in water are closer to the O atom
because its nucleus is much larger than that of the H
atoms:

Illustration by G. Bergtrom

The larger nucleus of the oxygen atom in H2O attracts electrons more strongly than do
either of the two H atoms. As a result, the shared electrons spend more of their time
orbiting the O atom, such that the O atom carries a partial negative charge while each
of the H atoms carry a partial positive charge. The Greek letter delta () indicates
partial charges in polar covalent bonds. In the two illustrations above, compare the
position of the paired electrons in water with those illustrated for hydrogen gas or
methane.

CMB3e

41

Water’s polar covalent bonds allow it to attract and interact with other polar covalent
molecules, including other water molecules. The polar covalent nature of water also
goes a long way to explaining its physical and chemical properties, and why water is
essential to life on this planet!
124 Covalent Bonds
Both polar and non-polar covalent bonds play a major role on the structure of
macromolecules, like insulin, the protein hormone shown below.

CC-BY 2.5 http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:InsulinMonomer.jpg

The X-ray image of a space-filling model of the hexameric form of stored insulin
(above left) emphasizes its tertiary structure in great detail. Regions of internal
secondary structure are highlighted in the ribbon diagram on the right; as secreted
from Islets of Langerhans cells of the pancreas, active insulin is a dimer of two
polypeptides (A and B), shown here in blue and cyan respectively. The subunit
structure and the interactions holding the subunits together result from many
electrostatic interactions (including H-bonds) and other weak interactions. The
disulfide bonds (bridges) seen as yellow ‘Vs’ in the ribbon diagram stabilize the
associated A and B monomers. We will look at protein structure in more detail in an
upcoming chapter.

CMB3e

42

B. Ionic Bonds
Atoms that gain or lose electrons to achieve a filled outer shell form ions, acquiring a
negative or a positive charge, respectively. Despite being electrically charged, ions
are stable because their outer electron shells are filled. Common table salt is a good
example (illustrated below).

Illustration by G. Bergtrom

Na (sodium) can donate a single electron to Cl (chlorine) atoms, generating Na+ and
Cl- ions. The oppositely charged ions then come together forming an ionic bond, an
electrostatic interaction of opposite charges that holds the Na+ and Cl- ions together in
crystal salt. Look up the Bohr models of these two elements and see how ionization of
each leaves filled outer shells (energy levels) in the ions.

IV. A Close Look at Water Chemistry
1. Hydrogen Bonds, the Polarity and Properties of Water
Hydrogen bonds are a subcategory of electrostatic interaction (i.e., formed by the
attraction of oppositely charges). As noted above, water molecules attract one
another (cohere) because of strong electrostatic interactions that form H-bonds.
Because of water’s polar covalent nature, it is able to attract positively and negatively
charged groups of solutes, making it a good solvent. Solutes (water-soluble
molecules) or molecular surfaces attracted to water are hydrophilic. Lipids like fats
and oils are not polar molecules and therefore do not dissolve in water; they are
hydrophobic (from hydro, water; phobic, fearing).

CMB3e

43

Soluble salts like NaCl dissolve because the Cl- and Na+ ions more strongly attract the
partial positive and negative charges (respectively) of water molecules. The result is
that the ions separate. We call this separation of salt ionization. The ionization of
NaCl dissolving in water is shown below.

Illustration by G. Bergtrom

Water is also a good solvent for macromolecules (proteins, nucleic acids) with
exposed polar chemical groups on their surfaces that attract water molecules, as
shown below.

Illustration by G. Bergtrom

125 Water, Hydrogen & ionic Bonds

CMB3e

44

In addition to being a good solvent, we recognize the following properties of water, all
of which result from its polar nature and H-bonding abilities:








Cohesion: the ability of water molecules to stick together via H-bonds.
High Surface tension: water’s high cohesion means that it can be hard to break
the surface; think the water strider, an insect that ‘walks’ on water.
Adhesion: this results from water’s electrostatic interactions with ions and the
partial charges on polar covalent molecules or functional groups. Adhesion
explains water’s solvent properties and (at least in part) capillary action where
water molecules ‘crawl’ along hydrophilic surfaces, often against the force of
gravity.
High specific heat: The cohesion of water molecules is so strong that it takes a lot
of energy to separate the molecules and make them move faster, i.e., to heat
water; specifically it takes 1 Kcal, (1 Calorie, with a capital C) to heat a gram of
water 1oC. Incidentally, high specific heat also explains why water “holds its heat”
(i.e., stays hotter longer that the pot that it’s in!).
High heat of vaporization: It takes even more energy per gram of water to turn it
into water vapor!

2. Water Ionization and pH
One last property of water: it ionizes weakly to form H+ and OH- ions, - or more
correctly, pairs of water molecules form H3O+ and OH- ions. You can think of this as
happening in the following two reactions:

Acid molecules added to water dissociate and release protons. This drives reaction
#2, forming more H3O+ ions in the solution, in turn driving reaction #1 forward. A pH
meter measures the relative acidity or concentration of protons in a solution. Acidic
solutions have a pH below 7.0 (neutrality).
Bases ionizing in water release OH- (hydroxyl) ions. The increase in OH- ions removes
protons from the solution, driving both reaction in reverse and raising the pH of the
solution.

CMB3e

45

To summarize acid-base chemistry:
When dissolved in water,
•
•

Acids release H+
Bases accept H+

Since the pH of a solution is the negative logarithm of the hydrogen ion concentration,
•
•
•

at pH 7.0, a solution is neutral
below a pH of 7.0, a solution is acidic
above a pH of 7.0, a solution is basic

VI. Some Basic Biochemistry: Carbon, Monomers, Polymers and the
Synthesis and Degradation of Macromolecules
Like evolution, the origin of life involved some prebiotic ‘natural selection’ of chemicals in
the environment. As with evolution, this chemical selection would favor expanding
possibility and diversity. In simple terms, atoms that could interact with a maximal
number of other atoms to form the largest number of stable molecules would have been
most likely to accumulate in the environment. The tetravalent C atom met these criteria
for chemical selection, proving perfect for building an organic chemistry set.
At the same time, water turned out to be the perfect place to launch prebiotic chemical
selection experiments. Water persists as the life’s universal solvent, which by way, is why
evidence of water in places beyond our earth gets us all excited!
A. Isomerism in Organic Molecules and the Diversity of Shape
The carbon skeleton is a perfect platform of organic molecule diversity. The
differences in arrangement of atoms and functional chemical groups around C atom
result in isomerism. Isomers of an organic molecule have the same chemical formula
but different shapes (and so, potentially different chemical properties and biochemical
function). The larger the carbon skeleton of an organic molecule, the greater the
diversity of molecular shapes available for chemical selection.

Look at the examples of structural isomers and geometric isomers below.

It is easy to see that the structural isomers of C4H10 (above left and right) have
different shapes. You cannot convert one structural isomer to the other without
breaking covalent bonds. In the geometric isomers of C4H8 in the lower panel, the H
atoms on the double-bonded C atoms can be on the same (cis) or opposite (trans)
side of the planar double bond. Geometric isomers too, cannot be interconverted
without breaking chemical bonds. Optical isomers are yet a third kind of isomer.
They exist around optically active (asymmetric, or chiral) carbons. A chiral C is one
that is covalently linked to four different atoms and/or molecular groups. The principle
of chirality is illustrated below.

Illustration by G. Bergtrom

Optical isomers (also called enantiomers) also differ in shape, and just like structural
and geometric isomers, they can’t be converted from one to the other without breaking
and re-making covalent bonds. We say that optical isomers are optically active
CMB3e

47

because they bend, or rotate light in opposite directions in a polarimeter. Light
passing through a solution of one optical isomer is rotated in one direction while light
passing through the other isomer is rotated in the opposite direction. These directions
are referred to as l, or levo (meaning left) and d or dextro (meaning right). If a
molecule has more than one chiral C (glucose for example has four chiral carbons), its
behavior in a polarimeter will be based on the sum of optical activities of all the chiral
carbons. The common isomer of glucose in our diet is d-glucose. The d- and lisomers of glucose are illustrated below (showing chiral carbons in red).

Illustration by G. Bergtrom

Glucose enantiomers are also referred to as D and L respectively. This is a
convention based on the configuration of the four different atoms or groups around the
last optically active carbon in a molecule (5C in glucose). For glucose, d and l in fact
correspond to D and L respectively. As we will see for some molecules, the upper
case designation of a chiral molecule does not always indicate how it bends light in a
polarimeter, while the lower case d and l always do!
Remember that the shape and chemical properties of any molecule dictates its
function. Isomerism in organic (carbon-based) molecules increased the diversity of
molecular shapes available for chemical selection. An early selection of isomers (and
specific optical isomers in particular) during chemical evolution contributed greatly to
chemical functions and reactions we recognize in cells… even before there was life on
earth. That all life uses the same isomers of glucose in energy reactions and the
same isomers of amino acids to build proteins confirms the prebiotic selection of those
isomers!

B. Monomers to Polymers and Back: Dehydration Synthesis and Hydrolysis
All living things build and break down polymers (macromolecules) by dehydration
synthesis (condensation reactions) and hydrolysis, respectively. Dehydration
synthesis and hydrolysis reactions are essentially the reverse of each other, as
illustrated below:

Illustration by G. Bergtrom

Condensation reactions build macromolecules by removing a water molecule from
interacting monomers. The ‘bond’ that forms in a condensation reaction is not a single
bond, but a linkage involving several bonds! The linkages form by removing an OH
from one monomer and an H group from the other to form a water molecule.
126 Organic Molecules Monomers & Polymers
Repeated condensation reactions such as the one between two amino acids shown
below form the peptide linkages that build polypeptides during translation.

Illustration by G. Bergtrom

CMB3e

49

Cells perform repeated condensation reactions to build other polymers, including
polysaccharides and polynucleotides (the RNA and DNA nucleic acids). Consider the
polymerization of glucose monomers into storage or structural polysaccharides for
example. Cells use only (d)glucose is used by cells to make polysaccharides.
Straight-chain (d)glucose with four chiral carbons becomes cyclic when dissolved in
water, where the cyclic molecule acquires a fifth chiral carbon, shown below.

Illustration by G. Bergtrom

The fifth pair of enantiomers in solution are called  and , or more correctly,
(d)glucose and (d)glucose. Having selected d-glucose for most cellular energy
metabolism, life then exploited the additional chiral carbon in cyclic d-glucose to make
the different polysaccharide polymers we now find in plants and animals.

CMB3e

50

The condensation reactions shown below link glucose monomers, forming storage
and structural polysaccharides.

Illustration by G. Bergtrom

The -OH (hydroxyl) groups on the #1 C of (d)glucose are below the glucose rings.
The condensation reaction removes a water molecule, linking the sugars by an 1,4
glycoside linkage in the dimer, connecting them by their # 1 and # 4 carbons. Other
linkages are possible; diverse -glycoside linkages characterize branched storage
polysaccharides like glycogen in animals and the starches in plants. When
dglucose enantiomers polymerize, they form rigid structural polysaccharides
such as those of cellulose in plant cell walls. A modified -glucose called N-acetyl
glucosamine (not shown) polymerizes to form chitin, the principal component of fungal
cell walls and of the tough exoskeleton of arthropods (insects, crustacea). In another
chapter, we’ll revisit the linkage of amino acids the in the process of translation to build
a polypeptide, using only L amino acids to make their proteins! We’ll also look at the
details of replication and transcription that cells use to catalyze condensation reactions
to synthesizing DNA and RNA from nucleotide monomers. To summarize:


Linkages in these biopolymers are broken and formed daily in our lives! After a
protein- and carb-containing meal, digestion, the hydrolysis of glycoside and peptide
linkages, begins in your mouth and continues in your stomach and small intestines.
Then our cells use condensation reactions to complete the job of turning carrot- and
cow-derived monomers into you or me!

CMB3e

51



Prebiotic chemical evolution has selected only one of the optical isomers
(enantiomers) of glucose, amino acid and other monomers with which to build
polymers. This is so even though some of the different isomers are available and
even used for different purposes. The flexible (d)glucose polymer was selected to
be the storage polysaccharides that we use for energy, a selection probably made by
cells themselves. Storage polysaccharides include the plant starches and animal
glycogen. Likewise, the rigid inflexibility of (d)glucose polymers would have been
selected to reinforce cell structure and stability. Since all organisms store
carbohydrate energy in (d)glucose polymers and since (d)glucose polymers are
almost universally used to strengthen cell structure, these selections must have
occurred early in the history of life.

To conclude this chapter and to emphasize the significance of chirality to life, here is
what can happen when the wrong isomer ends up in the wrong place at the wrong
time…

C. A Tale of Chirality Gone Awry
Consider the story of Thalidomide, a tragic example of what happens if we are
unaware of enantiomeric possibilities. Introduced in 1957, Thalidomide sold as an
over-the-counter anti-nausea drug for cancer treatments and as a very effective
morning sickness remedy for pregnant women. However, by the early 1960s, the birth
of about 10,000 infants with severely deformed limbs was connected to the drug. The
half of the infants affected that survived did so with other defects as well. Of course,
the response was to pull Thalidomide off the market.
Thalidomide is a teratogen. Teratogens are substances or conditions (drugs,
chemicals, radiation, illness during pregnancy, etc.) that cause deformities during
embryogenesis and fetal development. The chemical basis of Thalidomide’s effects
are based on its enantiomeric (chiral) structure in which an amine-containing ring can
exist in front of, or behind the rest of the molecule.

CMB3e

52

The structure of Thalidomide is shown below.

Public Domain; By Vaccinationist - (R)-(+)-Thalidomide on PubChem(S)-(−)-Thalidomide on
PubChem, https://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?curid=50750574

The two isomers are referred to as ‘S’ and ‘R’. Of these, the S isomer is the teratogen.
While synthesis of pure R is possible, when used in treatment, R and S easily
interconvert, creating a racemic mixture. In the mother, S is transferred to the embryo or
fetus, with its terrible consequences. Remarkably, there were relatively few cases of
Thalidomide-induced birth deformities in the United States because our FDA (Food and
Drug Administration) had not yet approved the drug for clinical use. Of course, we
already knew that cells synthesized polymers from specific optical isomers of their
precursor monomers. So the sad Thalidomide story resulted from the untested effects of
an unexpected optical isomer. Many countries quickly tightened their pre-approval drug
testing regulations because of this tragedy.
In a more hopeful twist of the tale, Thalidomide has turned out to be effective in treating
cancer, leprosy, rheumatoid arthritis and other autoimmune diseases. Such therapeutic
benefits may be due to its anti-inflammatory effects. Its effects on tumor growth seems to
be due to its inhibition of angiogenesis (development of blood vessels) in the tumors.
Ironically, blockade of angiogenesis might also have contributed to the failure of proper
limb growth during pregnancy.
To conclude, when all is normal, the shapes of molecules, particularly macromolecules,
are essential for the specificity of reactions essential to life.

Protein Structure and Configuration: Primary, Secondary, Tertiary, Quaternary;
Protein Folding, Domains and Motifs, Studying Proteins

I.

Introduction

Proteins are the workhorses of cells, responsible for just about all aspects of life (look at
oxytocin in the cartoon)! Comprised of one or more polypeptides, they:







are the catalysts that make biochemical reactions possible.
are membrane components that selectively let substances in and out of the cell.
allow cell-cell communication and cell’s response to environmental change.
form the internal structure of cells (cytoskeleton) and nuclei (nucleoskeleton).
enable the motility of cells and things inside cells.
are in fact responsible for other cell functions too numerous to summarize here!

We owe much of what we know about biomolecular structure to the development of X-ray
crystallography. In fact an early determination of the structure of insulin (as well as
penicillin and vitamin B12) using X-ray crystallography earned Dorothy Hodgkins the 1964
Nobel Prize in Chemistry. In this chapter, we look at the different levels of protein
structure…, in fact what it takes to be a functional protein.
The primary structure (1o structure) of a polypeptide is its amino acid sequence.
Interactions between amino acids near each other in the sequence cause the polypeptide
to fold into secondary (2o) structures, including helix and -, or pleated sheet
conformations. Tertiary (3o) structures form when non-covalent interactions between
amino acid side-chains at some distance from one another in the primary sequence
cause the polypeptide further folds into more a complex 3-dimensional structure. Other
proteins (called chaperones!) facilitate the accurate folding of a polypeptide into correct,
bioactive, 3-dimensional conformations. Quaternary (4o) structure refers to proteins
made up of two or more polypeptides. Refer to the four levels of structure on the next
page as we explore how each level affects the shape and biological/biochemical function
of the protein.
Covalent bonds between specific amino acids (e.g., cysteines) that end up near each
other after folding may stabilize tertiary and quaternary structures. Many proteins also
bind metal ions (e.g., Mg++, Mn++) or small organic molecules (e.g., heme) before they
become functionally active. Finally, we look beyond these orders of structure at their
domains and motifs that have evolved to perform one or another specific protein
functions.

Clearly, in trying to understand molecular (especially macromolecular) function, a
recurring theme emerges: the function of a protein depends on its conformation. In turn,
protein conformation is based on the location and physical and chemical properties of
critical functional groups, usually amino acid side chains. Watch for this theme as we
look at enzyme catalysis, the movement of molecules in and out of cells, the response of
cells their environment, the ability of cells and organelles to move, how DNA replicates,
how gene transcription and protein synthesis are regulated…, just about everything a cell
does! We will conclude this chapter with a look at some techniques for studying protein
structure.
Learning Objectives
When you have mastered the information in this chapter, you should be able to:
1. define and distinguish between the orders of protein structure.
2. differentiate between beta sheet, alpha helix and random coil structure based on the
atomic interactions involved on each.
3. trace the path to the formation of a polypeptide; define its primary structure and how it
is determined by ‘protein sequencing’.
4. describe how globular proteins arise from the hydrophobic and hydrophilic interactions
that drive protein folding and how changes in protein shape can cause disease.
5. formulate an hypothesis (or look one up) to explain why the amino acid glycine is a
disruptor of alpha helical polypeptide structure.
6. compare and contrast motif and domain structure of proteins and polypeptides, and
their contribution to protein function.
7. describe different techniques for studying proteins and the physical/chemical
differences between proteins that make each technique possible.

II.

Levels (Orders) of Protein Structure

A. Primary Structure
1. L amino acids and the C-N-C-N-… polypeptide backbone
The primary structure of a protein refers to the amino acid sequence of its
polypeptide chain(s). Cells use only 20 amino acids to make polypeptides and
proteins, although they do use a few additional amino acids for other purposes.
Peptide linkages between amino acids in polypeptides form in condensation
reactions in cells during protein synthesis (i.e., translation). The linkages involve
multiple covalent bonds. They break and rearrange between the carboxyl and
amino groups of amino acids during linkage formation.

CMB3e

57

The 20 amino acids found in proteins are shown below.

https://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?curid=9176441

Except for glycine, the -carbon in the 19 other amino acids is bound to four
different groups, making them chiral or optically active.
CMB3e

58

Recall that chiral carbons allow for mirror image D and L or d and l optical isomers.
Recall also that only the lower case d or l defines the optical properties of isomers.
Just to make life interesting, L amino acids are actually dextrorotary in a
polarimeter, making them d-amino acids! While both enantiomers exist in cells,
only dextrorotary d (i.e., L) amino acids (along with glycine) are used by cells to
build polypeptides and proteins. A partial polypeptide is illustrated below.

Illustration by G. Bergtrom

The result of translation in a cell is a polypeptide chain with a carboxyl end and an
amino end. Amino acid side chains (circled above) end up alternating on opposite
sides of a C-N-C-N-… polypeptide backbone because of the covalent bond
angles along the backbone. You could prove this to yourself by assembling a short
polypeptide with a molecular modeling kit, the kind you might have used in a
chemistry class! The C-N-C-N-…backbone is the underlying basis of higher
orders, or levels of protein structure (see below).
132 Amino Acid Sequence & Protein Primary Structure
2. Determining Protein Primary Structure - Polypeptide Sequencing
Frederick Sanger was the first to demonstrate a practical method for sequencing
proteins when he reported the amino acid sequence of the two polypeptides of
Bovine (cow) insulin. Briefly, the technique involves stepwise hydrolysis of
polypeptide fragments, called an Edman Degradation. Each hydrolysis leaves
behind a polypeptide fragment shortened by one amino acid that can be identified.
Sanger received a Nobel Prize in 1958 for this feat. By convention, the display and
counting of amino acids always starts at the amino-, or N-terminal end (the end

CMB3e

59

with a free NH2-group). Primary structure is dictated directly by the gene encoding
the protein. After transcription of a gene), a ribosome translates the resulting
mRNA into a polypeptide.
For some time now, the sequencing of DNA has replaced most direct protein
sequencing. The method of DNA sequencing, colloquially referred to as the
Sanger dideoxy method, quickly became widespread and was eventually
automated, enabling rapid gene (and even whole genome) sequencing. Now,
instead of directly sequencing polypeptides, we can infer amino acid sequences
from gene sequences isolated by cloning or revealed after complete genome
sequencing projects. This is the same Sanger who first sequenced proteins, and
yes…, he won a second Nobel Prize for the DNA sequencing work in 1980!
The different physical and chemical properties of amino acids themselves result
from the side chains on their -carbons. The unique physical and chemical
properties of polypeptides and proteins are determined by their unique combination
of amino acid side chains and their interactions within and between polypeptides.
In this way, primary structure reflects the genetic underpinnings of polypeptide and
protein function. The higher order structures that account for the functional motifs
and domains of a mature protein derive from its primary structure. Christian
Anfinsen won a half-share of the 1972 Nobel Prize in Chemistry for demonstrating
that this was the case for the ribonuclease enzyme (Stanford Moore and William H.
Stein earned their share of the prize for relating the structure of the active site of
the enzyme to its catalytic function). See 1972 Nobel Prize in Chemistry for more.
B. Secondary Structure
Secondary structure refers to highly regular local structures within a polypeptide (e.g.,
 helix) and either within or between polypeptides (-pleated sheets). Linus Pauling
and coworkers suggested these two types of secondary structure in 1951. A little
Linus Pauling history is would be relevant here! By 1932, Pauling had developed his
Electronegativity Scale of the elements that could predict the strength of atomic bonds
in molecules. He contributed much to our understanding of atomic orbitals and later to
the structure of biological molecules. He earned the 1954 Nobel Prize in Chemistry
for this work. He and his colleagues later discovered that sickle cell anemia was due
to an abnormal hemoglobin, and went on to predict the alpha helical and pleated sheet
secondary structure of proteins. While he did not earn a second Nobel for these novel
molecular genetics studies, he did win the 1962 Nobel Peace prize for convincing
almost 10,000 scientists to petition the United Nations to vote to ban atmospheric
nuclear bomb tests. A more detailed review of his extraordinary life (e.g., at Linus
Pauling-Short Biography) is worth a read!

CMB3e

60

Secondary structure conformations occur due to the spontaneous formation of
hydrogen bonds between amino groups and oxygens along the polypeptide backbone,
as shown in the two left panels in the drawing below. Note that amino acid side
chains play no significant role in secondary structure.

133 Protein secondary structure
The  helix or  sheets are a most stable arrangement of H-bonds in the chain(s).
These regions of ordered secondary structure in a polypeptide can be separated by
varying lengths of less structured peptide called random coils. All three of these
elements of secondary structure can occur in a single polypeptide or protein that has
folded into its tertiary structure, as shown at the right in the illustration above. The
pleated sheets are shown as ribbons with arrowheads representing N-to-C or C-to-N
polarity of the sheets. As you can see, a pair of peptide regions forming a pleated
sheet may do so either in the parallel or antiparallel directions (look at the arrowheads
of the ribbons), which will depend on other influences dictating protein folding to form
tertiary structure. Some polypeptides never go beyond their secondary structure,
remaining fibrous and insoluble. Keratin is perhaps the best-known example of a
fibrous protein, making up hair, fingernails, bird feathers, and even filaments of the
cytoskeleton. Most polypeptides and proteins however, do fold and assume tertiary
structure, becoming soluble globular proteins.

CMB3e

61

C. Tertiary Structure
Polypeptides acquire their tertiary structure when hydrophobic and non-polar side
chains spontaneously come together to exclude water, aided by the formation of salt
bridges and H-bonds between polar side chains that find themselves inside the
globular polypeptide. In this way,  helices or  sheets are folded and incorporated
into globular shapes. The forces that cooperate to form and stabilize 3-dimensional
polypeptide and protein structures are illustrated below.

Illustration by G. Bergtrom

Polar (hydrophilic) side chains that can find no other side-chain partners are typically
found on the outer surface of the ‘’globule’, where they interact with water and thus
dissolve the protein (recall water of hydration). Based on non-covalent bonds,
tertiary structures are nonetheless strong simply because of the large numbers of
otherwise weak interactions that form them. Nonetheless, covalent disulfide bonds
between cysteine amino acids in the polypeptide (shown above) can further stabilize
tertiary structure. Disulfide bonds (bridges) form when cysteines far apart in the
primary structure of the molecule end up near each other in a folded polypeptide.
Then the –SH (sulfhydryl) groups in the cysteine side chains are oxidized, forming
the disulfide (–S-S- ) bonds.

CMB3e

62

The sulfhydryl oxidation reaction is shown below.

Illustration by G. Bergtrom

134 Protein Tertiary (30) Structure
135 Disulfide Bridges Stabilize 30 Structure
To better understand how disulfide bridges can support the 3-dimensional structure of
a protein, just imagine its physical and chemical environment. Changing the
temperature or salt concentration surrounding a protein might disrupt non-covalent
bonds involved in the 3D shape of the active protein. Unaffected by these changes,
disulfide bridges limit the disruption and enable the protein to re-fold correctly and
quickly when conditions return to normal (think homeostasis!).

III.

Changes in Protein Shape Can Cause Disease

While the conformation of a protein determines its biological function, an allosteric change
(change in shape) can moderate or disrupt its function. Under normal circumstances,
cells use changes in protein shape to regulate metabolism. Such allosteric regulation is
well documented in familiar biochemical pathways such as glycolysis and is discussed in
more detail elsewhere. Less well understood is how (or why) is why conformational
change in some proteins cells has devastating effects.
A. Sickle Cell Anemia
Mutant genes for globins can result in hemoglobin disorders characterized by
inefficient oxygen delivery by blood. In the 1940s, the British biochemist J.B.S.
Haldane made a correlation between southern African regions with high incidences
hemoglobin disorders and malaria, suggesting that heterozygous individuals (i.e.,
those that had only one copy of a mutant hemoglobin gene), were somehow protected
from malaria. Another well-known example of a hemoglobin disorder is sickle cell
anemia, caused by a single base change in the gene for human -hemoglobin, one of

CMB3e

63

the polypeptides in hemoglobin. Since red blood cells are rich in hemoglobin, sickling
hemoglobins can cause the cells themselves to become sickle-shape. Sickled cells
disrupt capillary flow and oxygen delivery, resulting in the symptoms of anemia. Sickle
cell anemia originated in Africa and spread to the United States during the slave trade.
Once out of Africa and regions where malaria was epidemic, the mutation was of no
value, and was just a source of disease. Individuals heterozygous for the sickle cell
mutation have sickle cell trait and are generally unaffected because at least some of
their hemoglobin is normal. Homozygous individuals make only the sickle cell variant
of -hemoglobin; they will suffer more frequent and severe suffer episodes of the
disease. Stressors that can trigger sickling include infection or dehydration. Compare
normal red blood cells to a sickle cell below.

https://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?curid=30148180

The sickle cell gene affects perhaps more than 100 million people worldwide, including
8-10% of African Americans. For more demographic information, see Sickle Cell Trait
Demographics Article and Sickle Cell Data from the CDC. In Africa, heterozygotes
with sickle cell trait are protected from malaria, confirming Haldane’s hypothesis. But
patients homozygous for the -hemoglobin mutation derive little benefit from its antimalarial effects.
In the meantime, despite a 33% reduction in cases of malaria, the disease (caused by
a mosquito-borne parasite) still threatens half of the people on the planet, causing
over a half-million deaths per year. There are treatments other than mosquito nets
and killing mosquitos, but at this time, there is still no preventive vaccine.
B. The Mis-Folding of Prions and Alzheimer’s Disease
1. The Prion Protein
When first discovered, prion proteins seemed to behave as infectious agents that
could reproduce without DNA or other nucleic acid. As you can imagine, this
highly unorthodox and novel hereditary mechanism generated its share of
controversy. Read about research on the cellular PrPc prion protein at
en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prion.

CMB3e

64

Of course, prions turned out not to be reproductive agents of infection after all.
Recent studies of prions have revealed several normal prion protein functions such
as roles in memory formation in mice and in sporulation in yeast (Check out Prion
Proteins May Play a Role in Memory Formation). A mutant version of the prion
protein (PrPSc) is able to mis-fold, assuming an abnormal shape. The deformed
PrPSc can then induce abnormal folding even normal PrPc! These events,
illustrated below, result in the formation of so-called amyloid plaques.

Flickr, Creative Commons License. Adapted from Author: AJC1, 18 April 2007; https://www.learner.org/courses/physics/visual/visual.html?shortname=protein_folding

In their abnormally folded state, prions have been associated Alzheimer’s Disease
(which affects about 5.5 million Americans, as well as with Mad Cow disease and
Creutzfeldt-Jakob-Disease (mad cow disease in humans), as well as Scrapie in
sheep, among others. We are beginning to understand that the role of prion
proteins in Alzheimer’s Disease is less causal and somewhat indirect.
2. The amyloid beta (A) peptide
The post-mortem brains of patients that suffered Alzheimer’s disease exhibit
characteristic extracellular amyloid plaques composed largely of the amyloid
beta (A) peptide. Enzymatic cleavage of the APP protein (amyloid precursor
protein) generates extracellular 39-43 amino acid A peptides. Under normal
conditions, excess A peptides are themselves digested.

CMB3e

65

Unregulated A peptide formation however, leads to the formation of beta amyloid
plaques seen in Alzheimer’s disease.as illustrated below.

The scissors in the illustration represent two enzymes that digest the APP. Prion
proteins are not a proximal cause of Alzheimer’s Disease, but may have a role in
initiating events that lead to it. Normal prion protein (PrPc), itself a membrane
receptor, is thought to bind A peptides, effectively preventing their aggregation
into plaques. An experimental reduction of PrPc was shown to increases

CMB3e

66

extracellular A peptides. Presumably prion protein aggregation induced by
mutant PrP (PrPsc) prevents prion proteins from binding to A peptide, leading to
its accumulation and ultimately to amyloid plaque formation and
neurodegeneration.
3. The Tau protein
A protein called tau is also associated with Alzheimer’s Disease. Misshapen tau
accumulating in neurofibrillary tangles in hippocampus brain neurons may be a
more immediate cause of the neuronal disfunction associated with the disease. In
normal neurons, a Microtubule-Associated Protein Tau (MAP-T) is phosphorylated and then binds to, and stabilizes microtubules. But when neuronal tau
becomes hyper-phosphorylated, its conformation changes. No longer stabilized,
the microtubules disassemble and the deformed tau proteins form neurofibrillary
tangles. Immunostaining of hippocampal neurons with antibodies to tau protein
localizes the neurofibrillary tangles as seen in the micrograph below.

There is no cure for Alzheimer’s disease, although treatments with cholinesterase
inhibitors seem to slow its advancement. For example, the drug Aricept inhibits
acetylcholine breakdown by acetylcholinesterase, thereby enhancing cholinergic
neurotransmission, which may in turn prolong brain neural function. Unfortunately,
there is as yet no treatment to restore lost memories and the significant cognitive
decline associated with Alzheimer’s disease. Perhaps more promising in this
respect, the recent development of a blood test may detect people at risk for
Alzheimer’s disease. As it happens, Aβ molecules escape into the blood stream as
much as 8 years before Alzheimer’s symptoms appear. The prospect of early Aβ
detection has raised hopes that new therapies might be on the horizon. For a brief
review, see Early Detection of Alzheimer's Disease.

C. Some Relatives of Alzheimer’s Disease
Some of the same protein abnormalities that are seen in Alzheimer’s disease also
characterize other neurodegenerative diseases as well as traumatic brain damage, as
discussed below.
1. Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathy
An abnormal accumulation of tau protein is diagnostic of CTE (Chronic Traumatic
Encephalopathy). In the early 20th century, disoriented boxers staggering about
after a fight were called ‘punch drunk’, suffering from dementia pugilistica. We now
know they suffered from CTE, as do other athletes exposed to repetitive mild-tosevere brain trauma, such as football players. Immunostaining of whole brains and
brain tissue from autopsied CTE patients with antibodies to tau protein show
accumulations of abnormal tau proteins and tau neurofibrillary tangles very much
like those found in of Alzheimer’s patients. Many National Football League and
other football players have been diagnosed post-mortem with CTE, and many still
living show signs of degenerative cognition and behavior consistent with CTE (see
a List of_NFL_players_with_chronic_traumatic_encephalopathy to see how many!
2. Parkinson’s Disease
This is yet another example of a neurodegenerative disease that results when a
single protein changes shape in brain cells. Though not characterized as plaques,
aggregates can form in brain cells when the protein alpha-synuclein undergoes
anomalous conformational change. The change results in MSA (Multiple System
Atrophy) or Parkinson’s Disease (click Synuclein Allostery and Aggregation in
Parkinson's Disease to read more details about this recent research). Much of the
high-resolution electron microscopy that reveals protein structure and that can
capture conformational changes we now recognize, comes from the work of
Jacques Dubochet, Joachim Frank and Richard Henderson who received the 2017
Chemistry Nobel Prize for Chemistry for developing and refining cryo-electron
microscopy for biomolecular imaging (see 2017 Nobel Prize for Chemistry for
more).

Quaternary Structure

Quaternary structure describes a protein composed of two or more polypeptides. Like
tertiary structure, multimeric polypeptide are formed by the same kinds of non-covalent
interactions and may be stabilized disulfide bonds. Specifically, a dimer contains two, a
trimer three, a tetramer four polypeptides… and so on. Multimers made up of identical

CMB3e

69

subunits are referred to with a prefix of "homo-" (e.g. a homotetramer). Those made up of
different subunits are heteromers. The vertebrate hemoglobin molecule, consisting of two
- and two - globins (shown below) is a heterotetramer.

V.

Some Proteins are Chemically Modified and Others Require
Prosthetic Groups to be Biologically Active

Many polypeptides are modified after translation, for instance by phosphorylation or
glycosylation (addition of one or more phosphates or sugars respectively to specific
amino acids in the chain). These modifications account for and enhance the molecular
and functional diversity of proteins within and across species.
Hemoglobins exemplify another feature of the structure of many proteins. To be
biologically active, globin polypeptides must associate with a prosthetic group, in this case
a cyclic organic molecule called heme. At the center of each heme is the iron that
reversibly binds oxygen. All kinds of organisms, from bacteria to plants and animals
and even in some anaerobic organisms contain some kind of hemoglobin. Other proteins
must be bound to different metal ions (magnesium, manganese, cobalt…) to be
biologically active.

Protein Domains, Motifs, and Folds in Protein Structure

The structures of two different proteins shown below share a common PH (Pleckstrin
Homology) domain (maroon).

CC BY-SA 3.0; By Fdardel - Own work, https://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?curid=17659815

These two and many other proteins have this domain, allowing them to bind a molecule of
phosphatidyl-inositol triphosphate that is generated as part of a common cell-signaling
pathway. The implication of this common domain is that a cell can have signaling
pathways that allowing it to respond to different signals that lead to the same response,
albeit under different conditions and probably at different times. Proteins are typically
described as consisting of several distinct sub-structures, discussed below.
A. Domains
A structural domain is an element of the protein's overall structure that is stable and
often folds independently of the rest of the protein chain. Like the PH domain above,
many domains are not unique to the protein products of one gene, but instead appear
in a variety of proteins. Proteins sharing more than a few common domains
are encoded by members of evolutionarily related genes comprising gene families.
Genes for proteins that share only one or a few domains may belong to gene
superfamilies. Superfamily members can have one function in common, but their
sequences are otherwise unrelated. Domain names often derive from their
prominent biological function in the protein they belong to (e.g., the calcium-binding
domain of calmodulin), or from their discoverers (the PH domain!). The domain

71

swapping that gives rise to gene families and superfamilies are natural genetic events.
Because protein domains can also be "swapped" by genetic engineering to make
chimeric proteins with novel functions.
137 Protein Domain Structure & Function

B. Motifs
Protein motifs are small regions of protein three-dimensional structure or amino acid
sequence shared among different proteins. They are recognizable regions of protein
structure that may (or may not) be defined by a unique chemical or biological function.
C. Supersecondary Structure
Supersecondary structure refers to a combination of secondary structure elements,
such as beta-alpha-beta units or the helix-turn-helix motif. They may be also referred
to as structural motifs. “Google” Supersecondary structure for examples.
D. Protein Folds
A protein fold refers to a general aspect of protein architecture, like helix bundle, betabarrel, Rossman fold or other "folds" provided in the Structural Classification of
Proteins database. Click Protein Folds to read more about these structures.

Proteins, Genes and Evolution: How Many Proteins are We?

If evolution did not have to select totally new proteins for each new cellular function, then
how many genes does it take to make an organism? The number of genes in an
organism that encode proteins may be far fewer than the number of proteins they actually
make. Current estimates suggest that it takes just 25,000 genes make and operate a
human and all its proteins (check out Pertea and Salzberg at Estimating the number of
genes in the human genome). However, our cells (and those of eukaryotes generally)
may express as many as 100,000 different proteins. How is this possible? Are there
more efficient ways to evolve new and useful cellular tasks than evolving a new genes?
As we already noted, the use of the same 20 amino acids to make proteins in all living
things speaks to their early (even pre-biotic) selection and to the common ancestry of all
living things. Complex conserved domain structures shared among otherwise different
proteins imply that evolution of protein function has occurred as much by recombinatorial
exchange of DNA segments encoding these substructures, as by an accumulation of

CMB3e

72

base substitutions in otherwise redundant genes. Likewise, motifs and folds might also be
shared in this way. Protein number can exceed gene number in eukaryotes, in part
because cells can produce different RNA variants from the same genes by “alternative
splicing”, which can create mRNAs that code different combinations of substructures from
same gene! Alternate splicing is discussed in detail in a later chapter). The conservation
of amino acid sequences across species (e.g., histones, globins, etc.) is testimony to the
common ancestry of eukaryotes. Along with the synthesis of alternate versions of an
RNA, an ongoing repurposing of useful regions of protein structure may prove a strategy
for producing new proteins without adding new genes to a genome.

Chapter 4: Bioenergetics
Thermodynamics (Free Energy, Enthalpy and Entropy), Chemical Energy,
Open vs. Closed Systems

I.

Introduction

Three Laws of Thermodynamics describe the flow and transfer of energy in the
universe. They are:
1. Energy can neither be created nor destroyed.
2. Universal entropy (disorder) is always increasing.
3. Entropy declines with temperature -as temperatures approach absolute zero, so
goes entropy.
In living systems, we do not have to worry about the third law because equations for
energy exchange in living systems already reflect the temperature dependence of entropy
changes during reactions. Here we look at how we came to understand basic
thermodynamic principles and how they apply to living systems. First, we will look at
different kinds of energy and at how redox reactions govern the flow of energy through
living things. Next, we will try to understand some simple arithmetic statements of the
Laws of Thermodynamics for closed systems and then at how they apply to chemical
reactions conducted under standard conditions. Finally, since there really is no such
thing as a closed system, we look at the energetics of reactions occurring in open
systems. For an excellent discussion of how basic thermodynamic principles apply to
living things, see Lehninger A. (1971) Bioenergetics: The Molecular Basis of Biological
Energy Transformation. Benjamin Cummings, San Francisco.
Learning Objectives
When you have mastered the information in this chapter, you should be able to:
1. explain the difference between energy transfer and energy transduction.
2. compare and contrast potential vs. kinetic as well as other categories of energy (e.g.,
mass, heat, light…, etc.).
3. explain the reciprocal changes in universal free energy and entropy.
4. derive the algebraic relationship between free energy, enthalpy and entropy.
5. state the difference between exothermic, endothermic, exergonic, and endergonic
reactions
6. predict changes in free energy based on changes in the concentrations of reactants
and products in closed systems and open systems.
7. explain how the same reaction can be endergonic but will (under appropriate
conditions) release free energy.

CMB3e

76

8. predict whether a biochemical reaction will release free energy if it is exothermic, and
if so, under what conditions (you should be able to do this after working some sample
problems of closed system energetics).
9. distinguish between the equilibrium and steady-state of reactions and explain how an
endergonic reaction could also be spontaneous (i.e., could release free energy).

II.

Kinds of Energy

We can easily recognize different kinds of energy around us like heat, light, electrical,
chemical, nuclear, sound, etc., and you probably know that energy is measurable
(calories, joules, volts, decibels, quanta, photons…). Even mass is a form of energy, as
you may recall from Albert Einstein’s famous e=mc2 equation (the law of relativity).
The problem in thinking about thermodynamics is that the universe is big and there are
too many kinds of energy to contemplate at once! To simplify, imagine only two kinds of
energy in the universe: potential energy and kinetic energy. A helpful example is a
dam. The water above the dam has potential energy. As the water flows over (or
through) the dam, its potential energy is released as kinetic energy. In the old days the
kinetic energy of flowing water could be used to power (i.e., turn) a millstone to grind
wheat or other grains into flour. These days, water is more likely to flow through a
hydroelectric dam where kinetic energy is converted (transduced) to electricity. In this
simple view, heat (molecular motion), electricity (a current of electrons), sound (waves),
and light (waves OR moving ‘particles’) are different forms of kinetic energy. The energy
of mass or its position in the universe is potential energy. Thus chemical energy, for
example the energy in a mole of ATP, is potential energy. Physicists talk a lot about
potential energy and about kinetic energy flow and conversion.
An equally simple way to conceptualize energy is as useful vs. useless. This concept
led directly to the arithmetic formulation of the thermodynamic laws. In this utilitarian way
of thinking about energy, useless energy is entropy, while useful energy can be any of
the other forms of energy (potential or kinetic).
A key to understanding bioenergetics is recognizing the difference between closed and
open systems in the universe. Systems such as biochemical reactions in a test tube,
reach equilibrium. Such systems are considered closed. Closed systems are artificial,
possible only in the laboratory, where one can restrict and measure the amount of energy
and mass getting into or escaping the system. Cells on the other hand (in fact every
reaction or event in the rest of the universe) are open systems. Open systems readily
exchange energy and mass with their surroundings.

CMB3e

77

With this brief introduction, we can imagine ourselves to be early scientists trying to
understand energy flow in the universe, asking how the Laws of Thermodynamics apply
to living systems (bioenergetics). We’ll see that the Laws can be demonstrated because
all kinds of energy can be measured (as heat in calories or joules, electricity in volts, light
in quanta, matter in units of mass, etc.).
138 Different Kinds of Energy; Chemical Equilibrium

III. Deriving Simple Energy Relationships
A. Energy in the Universe: the Universe is a Closed System
Consider an event, any even. I think we can agree that when stuff happens,
participants in the happening go from an unstable state to a relatively more stable
state. For example, you carrying a bag of marbles and you accidentally drop the bag.
The marbles would fall to the floor, roll and spread out, eventually coming to a stop.
At that point, the marbles are in a more stable state than they were when you were
holding the bag.
If asked, you would say that gravity made the marbles fall from the bag. That is
certainly true. Could we then say that the drive to greater stability is what made the
marbles fall? In fact, regardless of the force or impetus for the event, we can say that
the drive to achieve greater stability that makes things/events happen! This is the
essence of the Second Law of Thermodynamics: all universal energy transfer
events occur with an increase in stability…, that is, an increase in entropy. We’ll
consider the second law and entropy in detail shortly.
The tendency of things go from unstable to more stable is a natural, rational state of
affairs…, like those marbles on the floor, or a messy bedroom with clothes strewn
about. Intuitively, messy and disordered is more stable than ordered. Of course,
marbles dropping or clothing going from folded and hung to wrinkled on the floor
releases energy (potential energy) as they fall (kinetic energy). If you don’t believe
that this release of energy is real, just think of how much energy you will need to pick
up the marbles or re-fold your clothes (after laundering them of course!).
We can model the flow of energy in the universe in a way that is consistent with
thermodynamic laws. Since the First law of Thermodynamics says that energy can
be neither created nor destroyed, a simple statement of the First Law could be:

Euniversal = Elight + Eheat + Eelectrical + Emass....
CMB3e

78

The equation sums up the different kinds of energy in the universe. Look at it this
way:

Illustration by G. Bergtrom

Energy cannot get in or out of the universe. Energy can only be transferred from one
place to another, or converted from one form to another. It follows then that Euniversal is
the sum of all kinds of energy in the universe, and that this sum is a constant. The
equation below is consistent with this idea.

Elight + Eheat + Eelectrical + Emass +… = a constant
This is a statement of the First Law of Thermodynamics.
139 First Law of Thermodynamics

CMB3e

79

If we go with the simpler binary notion or useful and useless energy, our equation
shortens to the sum of just two kinds of energy in the universe:

Euniversal = Guniversal + TSuniversal
In this equation, G is useful energy (“Gibbs” free energy ), S is useless energy
(entropy), and T is absolute temperature (included because of the third law).
This is also a statement of the First Law. Here is our revised circle diagram:

Illustration by G. Bergtrom

By the way, segregating things and concepts into circles is a way of logically viewing
relationships between them. John Venn first formalized this approach in the late 19th
century. The Venn diagrams used here to describe the universe are very simple. For
examples of more complex overlapping components of the universe that share some
but not all attributes, “Google” Venn Diagrams.

CMB3e

80

In this binary energy model, it follows that as universal entropy increases, free energy
in the universe must decrease:

Illustration by G. Bergtrom

Free or ‘potentially useful’ energy is higher in more ordered, complex and therefore
relatively unstable systems. Such unstable, ordered systems will release free energy
spontaneously.
140 Second Law Thermodynamics
While the arithmetic statements about changes in energy are useful concepts, the
parameters are of course, not measurable! But if we isolate a bit of the universe, we
can measure energies and watch energy flow.
B. Energy is Exchanged Between Systems in the Universe
If we can measure the amount of energy put into or removed from a system within
the universe, we can write a more useful equation to follow the transfer of energy
between a system and its surroundings:

H = G + TS
In this formula, H is the change (in enthalpy, i.e., as energy entering/leaving the
system in units of heat energy); G is change in free energy and S is change in
entropy; T = absolute temperature (oK).

CMB3e

81

Heat given off in a reaction (or other event) is often confused with entropy. It is true
that much of the increase in entropy that occurs in living things is indeed in the form of
random molecular motion, or heat. But remember that heat can have its uses; not all
heat is entropic! Hence, it is more interesting (and accurate!) to think of energy in
terms of changes in enthalpy, free energy and entropy during energy transfers.
According to the equation H = G + TS, interacting systems in our universe would
seem to be closed systems. Accordingly, energy put into or removed from the system
(H) will be exactly balanced by increases and/or decreases in the other two terms in
the equation (G + TS). Recall that we refer to these systems as closed systems not
because they are really closed, but because we can isolate them well enough to
account for energy flow into and out of the system. The value of this (or any)
algebraic equation with three variables is that if you know two of the values, you can
calculate the third! Here is a simple situation to illustrate the point: If I put a liter of
water on a burner and light the flame, the water gets hot. If the temperature of the liter
of water rises by 1oC, we know that it has absorbed 1000 calories (one Kcal, or one
food Calorie) of the heat from the burner.
Since energy interactions depend on different physical conditions, such as
temperature and air pressure, we need to standardize those conditions when
conducting experiments that measure energy changes in experimentally isolated
systems. For more on how standardizing these physical parameters enables
measuring energy change in chemical reactions (in fact, any energy exchange), click
the link below.
141 Deriving Closed System Thermodynamics
Turning to bioenergetics, let’s apply the equation H = G + TS to chemical
reactions in cells. Because most life on earth lives at sea level where the air pressure
is 1 atmosphere and the temperature is in the 20’s (Celsius), typical determinations of
H, G, and S are made under standard conditions where T=298oK (25oC), an
atmospheric pressure of pressures of 1 atm, and a constant pH of 7.0. In addition,
measured values are adjusted to calculate unimolar quantities of reactants (see
below). Our equation for reactions under these standard conditions becomes: H =
Go + TS, where Go is the standard free energy change for the reaction
conducted in a closed system under standard conditions, while H and S are still the
enthalpy and entropy changes, but determined under standard conditions.

CMB3e

82

What are unimolar conditions in practice? It means that if you burn 180 mg of
glucose in a calorimeter, multiply the calories released (H) by 1000. This gives you
the calories released by burning 180 gm (i.e., a whole mole) of the stuff. Now we are
ready to consider examples of how we determine the energetics of reactions.
C. How is Enthalpy Change (H) Determined?
H for a chemical reaction can easily be determined by conducting the reaction under
standard conditions in a bomb calorimeter (illustrated below).

Illustration by G. Bergtrom

Food manufacturers determine the Calorie content of food using a bomb calorimeter.
As a reaction takes place in the beaker in the illustration, it will either release or
absorb heat, either heating or cooling the water in the calorimeter jacket, as measured
by the thermometer. A reaction that releases heat as it reaches equilibrium is defined
as exothermic, and the H for an exothermic reaction will be negative. For example,
a package says that a chocolate bar has 90 Calories. This means that burning the bar
will generate 90 kilocalories (Kcal) of heat as measured in the calorimeter. Recall that
one Calorie (with a capital C) = 1000 calories, or one Kcal. One calorie (lower case) is
the energy needed to raise a gram of water by 1oC).

CMB3e

83

You are probably most familiar with reactions that release heat, but some chemical
reactions actually absorb heat. Take the common hospital cold pack for example.
Squeeze it to get it going and toss it in the calorimeter. You can watch the
temperature in the calorimeter drop as the pack absorbs heat from the surroundings!
Such reactions are defined as endothermic, with a positive H. OK, so we can
determine the value of one of the energy parameters… we need to know at least one
other, either Go or S before the equation H = Go + TS becomes useful.
D. How is Standard Free Energy Change (G0) Determined?
As it turns out, standard free energy change, Go , is directly proportional to the
concentrations of reactants and products of a reaction conducted to completion (i.e.,
equilibrium) under standard conditions. Therefore, to determine Go, we need to be
able to measure the concentration of reactants and reaction products before and after
a chemical reaction (i.e., when the reaction reaches equilibrium). Take the following
generic chemical reaction:

2A + B <====> 2C + D
The following equation relates G0 the equilibrium concentrations of A, B, C and D:

Go = -RTlnKeq = RTln [C]2[D]
[A]2[B]
R= the gas constant (1.806 cal/mole-deg), T = 298oK and Keq is the equilibrium
constant. This is the Boltzman equation. As you can see, the Keq for the reaction
is the ratio of the product of the concentrations of the products (raised to their
stoichiometric powers) to the product of the concentrations of the reactants (raised to
their stoichiometric powers).
If you can determine equilibrium concentrations of reactants and products in a
chemical reaction, you can use this equation to calculate Go (standard free energy
change) for a reaction. Consider the following generic chemical reaction:

A + B

C + D

If the Go is a negative number, the reaction is defined as exergonic. We say that
exergonic reactions release free energy. If the Go is a positive number, the reaction
absorbs free energy and is defined as endergonic.
CMB3e

84

142 Determining H & G in Closed Systems
E. Working an Example Using These Equations for Closed Systems
Consider the following reaction:

X

Y

If you are given [X] and [Y], you can also do the math. At equilibrium, the
concentrations of the reactants and products for this reaction measured (assayed),
with the following results:

[X] = 2.5 Kcal/Mole; [Y] = 500 cal/Mole
Use the Boltzmann equation (above) to calculate the standard free energy for this
reaction. What is the Keq for this reaction? What is the Go for the reaction? If you
did not come up with a Keq of 0.2 and an absolute value for the standard free energy
for|Go| of 866.2 Kcal/mole, re-calculate or collaborate with a classmate. Hint: make
sure that you convert the units in your equation so that they are all the same!). Based
on the calculated value of Go, is this reaction endergonic or exergonic?
If you conduct the reaction in a bomb calorimeter, it proceeds to equilibrium with a H
= -750 Kcal/Mole. What kind of reaction is this? Together with the enthalpy change, it
is now possible to calculate an absolute value for the entropy change to be |S| =
116.2 cal/mol-deg for this reaction. At equilibrium, did the reaction proceed with an
increase or decrease in entropy under standard conditions? Again, if you did not get
the correct answer, re-calculate or collaborate with a classmate.
143 Determining S in Closed System
F. Summary: The Properties of Closed Systems
First, let’s reiterate that there is no such thing as a closed system, unless of course the
universe is one! What we call a closed system is simply one in which we can measure
the energy going into or coming out of the system, and within which we can measure
energy transfers and transductions (changes from one kind of energy to another.

Closed systems are experimentally defined by an investigator.
Standard conditions apply.
Energy entering or leaving the system is measurable.
Reactions reach equilibrium regardless of reaction rate.
Product and reactant concentrations at equilibrium are
constant.
Measured energy transfer/transduction values are constant.

G. Actual Free Energy Change in Open Systems
Later we will be discussing the flow of energy through living things, from sunlight to
chemical energy in nutrient molecules into ATP, from chemical energy as ATP into the
performance of all manner of cellular work. Cells are open systems that constantly
exchange mass and energy with their environment and never reach equilibrium. In
addition, diverse organisms live under very different atmospheric conditions and maintain
different body temperatures (e.g., your cat has a higher body temperature than you do!).
Clearly, the conditions under which cells conduct their biochemical reactions are
decidedly non-standard. However, while open systems do not reach equilibrium, they do
achieve a steady state in which the rate of input of energy and matter is equal to the rate
of output of energy and matter. Think of a biochemical pathway like glycolysis. If a cell’s
energy needs are constant, the pathway will reach a steady state. Of course, a cell’s
need for energy (as ATP) can change as energy needs change. If it does, then the
steady state of ATP production will change to meet the needs of the cell.
Since reaction rates can change (and are in fact regulated in cells), implying that the
steady state of a reaction or biochemical pathway can change. We characterize open
systems by their properties, as listed below.

Properties of Open Systems



CMB3e

Open systems exchange energy and mass with their surroundings.
Open systems never reach equilibrium
They achieve steady state where the energy input rate = output rate.
The steady state can change.
In open systems, endergonic reactions can be energetically
favorable (spontaneous).

86

Fortunately, there is an equation to determine free energy changes in open systems.
For our chemical reaction 2A + B <====> 2C + D, this equation would be:

G’ = Go + RTln [C]ss2 [D] ss
[A] ss2 [B] ss
Here, G’ is the actual free energy change for a reaction in an open system. Go is
the standard free energy change for the same reaction under standard conditions
In a closed system. R is again the gas constant (1.806 cal/mole-deg) and T is the
absolute temperature in which the reaction is actually occurring. The subscript ‘ss’
designates reactant and product concentrations measured under steady state
conditions. To determine the actual free energy of a biochemical reaction in a cell (in
fact in any living tissue), all you need to know are the Go for the reaction, the steady
state concentrations of reaction components in the cells/tissues, and the absolute T
under which the reactions are occurring.
144 The Energetics of Open Systems
Elsewhere, we will use the reactions of the glycolytic pathway to exemplify the
energetics of open and closed systems. At that time, pay careful attention to the
application of the terminology of energetics in describing energy flow in closed vs.
open systems.

Chapter 5: Enzyme Catalysis and Kinetics
Mechanism of Enzyme Catalysis, Induced Fit, Activation Energy,
Determining and Understanding Enzyme Kinetics

I.

Introduction

In this chapter, we look at the properties and mechanism of action of enzymes. These
include allosteric change (induced fit, enzyme regulation), energetic events (changes in
activation energy), and how enzymes work in open and closed (experimental) systems.
Any catalyst, by definition, accelerates a chemical reaction. But enzymes and inorganic
catalysts differ in important ways (blue and red in the table below).

Enzymes are long polymers that can fold into intricate shapes. As a result, they can be
more specific than inorganic catalysts in which substrates they recognize and bind to.
Finally, enzymes are flexible and can be regulated in ways that rigid, inflexible, metallic
inorganic catalysis cannot. The specificity of an enzyme lies in the structure and flexibility
of its active site. We will see that the active site of enzymes undergo conformational
change during catalysis. The flexibility of enzymes also explains the effects of enzymes
to cellular metabolites that indicate the biochemical status of the cell. When such
metabolites bind to an enzyme, they force a conformational change in the enzyme that

CMB3e

89

change the catalytic rate of the reaction, a phenomenon called allosteric regulation. As
you might imagine, changing the rate of a biochemical reaction can change the rate of an
entire biochemical pathway…, and ultimately the steady state concentrations of products
and reactants in the pathway.
To understand the importance of allosteric regulation, we’ll look at how we measure the
speed of enzyme catalysis. As we consider the classic early 20th century enzyme kinetic
studies of Leonor Michaelis and Maud Menten, we’ll focus on the significance of the Km
and Vmax values that they derived from their data. But, before we begin our discussion
here, remember that chemical reactions are by definition, reversible. The action of
catalysts, either inorganic or organic, depends on this concept of reversibility.
Finally, let’s give a nod to recent human ingenuity that enabled enzyme action to turn an
extracellular profit! You can now find enzymes in household cleaning products like
detergents, where they digest and remove stains caused by fats and pigmented proteins.
Enzymes added to meat tenderizers also digest (hydrolyze) animal proteins down to
smaller peptides. Enzymes can even clean a clogged drain!
Learning Objectives
When you have mastered the information in this chapter, you should be able to:
1. describe how the molecular flexibility of protein and RNA molecules make them ideal
biological catalysts.
2. compare and contrast the properties of inorganic and organic catalysts.
3. explain why catalysts do not change equilibrium concentrations of a reaction
conducted in a closed system.

Enzymes

By 1941, their studies correlating mutations with enzyme deficiencies in Neurospora
crassa (bread mold) and Drosophila melanogaster led George Beadle and Edward Tatum
to propose the one-gene/one-enzyme hypothesis in 1941. In 1958, they shared Nobel

CMB3e

90

Prize in Physiology and Medicine for this work. By the time of the award, their hypothesis
had morphed twice: first into the one-gene/one-protein, and then the one-gene/onepolypeptide hypothesis. This rightfully revered history helped launch the age of
molecular biology, making the discovery of RNA catalysts quite a surprise! The discovery
of RNA catalysts, dubbed ribozymes, earned Sidney Altman and Thomas Cech the
Nobel Prize in Chemistry in1989. Ribozymes are now known that catalyze RNA splicing
(the removal of unwanted regions of a precursor RNA. Ribozymes are also associated
with a region of ribosomal RNA, where they participate in the catalysis of protein
synthesis. Here, the focus here is based on the long history of protein enzyme catalysis,
but you should recognize the mechanisms of enzyme catalytic mechanisms to be
discussed involve essential features in all biocatalysts.
Enzymes are generally soluble in or outside cells while a few are part of membranes or
other cellular structures. In all cases, they bind to soluble substrates (the reactants in
enzyme-catalyzed reactions). The large size and exquisite diversity of protein structures
make enzymes highly specific catalysts. The specificity of an enzyme results from the
shape of the active site of the enzyme, which is dependent on the three-dimensional
arrangement of amino acids in and around the region. The substrates of a catalyzed
biochemical reaction are bound to, and held in place on the enzyme while rapid bond
rearrangements take place. Because of their flexibility, enzymes undergo change in
shape at the active site during catalysis itself. In addition, this flexibility enables small
metabolites in cells to interact with and change the shapes of many enzymes. The latter
phenomenon enables allosteric regulation, allowing cells to control the rates and even
the direction of biochemical reactions and pathways. As we will see, enzymes may also
be bound to prosthetic groups or ions that contribute to the shape and activity of the
enzyme.
Almost no chemical reaction occurs that is not directly the result of enzyme catalysis, from
the digestion of nutrients in your mouth, stomach and small intestines to pretty much
every chemical reaction inside your cells [check out Kornberg A (1989) Never a Dull
Enzyme. Ann. Rev. Biochem. 58:1-30].
145 Enzymes vs. Other Catalysts
A. The Mechanisms of Enzyme Catalysis
We describe the action of biological catalysis in two ways. One way takes into
account structural features of the enzyme (active site shape, overall conformation, the
affinities of the enzyme for its substrates). The other way involves the energetics of

CMB3e

91

enzyme action. We’ll see that enzymes lower the activation energy of a chemical
reaction. Activation energy is an inherent energy barrier to the reaction. Of course,
structural and energy considerations of enzyme catalysis are related.
1. Structural Considerations of Catalysis
From a chemistry course, you may recall that the rate of an uncatalyzed reaction is
dependent on the concentration of the reactants in solution. This is the Law of
Mass Action, recognized in the19th century. Look at this simple reaction:

A + B

C + D

The Law of Mass Action makes two key assumptions:
a) At any given time following the start of the reaction, the rate of product
formation is proportional to the concentrations of the reactants and products
([A], [B], [C] and [D] in this case).
b) Chemical reactions in the laboratory eventually reach equilibrium, at which
point the net rate of formation of reaction products is zero (i.e., the forward and
reverse reactions occur at the same rate).
At the start of the reaction written above, since there are no products yet, the
reaction rate should be directly proportional only to the concentration of the
reactants. Therefore, the Law of Mass Action predicts that a chemical reaction will
occur faster at higher concentrations of A & B. This is because there are more
reactant molecules in solution and a greater likelihood that they will collide in an
orientation that allows the bond rearrangements for the reaction to occur.
Of course, reactant concentrations decline as products accumulate over time.
Then the rate of formation of C & D should slows down, now affected by product as
well as reactant concentrations; remember, all chemical reactions are inherently
reversible! You may recognize the chemical rate equations from a chemistry
course; these enable quantitation of reaction rates for our sample reaction. Here is
the rate of formation or the products, C and D:
Rate of formation of products (C & D) = k1[A][B] – k-1[C][D]
This equation recognizes that the reaction is reversible. Thus, the net reaction rate
is equal to the rate of the forward reaction (k1[A][B]) minus the rate of the back

CMB3e

92

reaction (k-1[C][D]). The equation is valid (applicable) at any time during the
reaction. k1 and k-1 are rate constants for the forward and reverse reactions,
respectively.
So how do catalysts work? Catalysts increase chemical reaction rates by bringing
reactants together more rapidly than they would encounter each other based just
on random molecular motion in solution. This is possible because catalysts have
an affinity for their substrates.
In the case of inorganic catalysts, relatively weak, generic forces account for the
affinity of reactants and inorganic catalysts. Thus, a metallic catalyst (e.g., silver,
platinum) attracts molecules with the appropriate (e.g., charge) configuration. If
the attraction (affinity) is sufficient, the metal will hold reactants in place long
enough to catalyze the bond rearrangements of a chemical reaction.
Unlike inorganic catalysts, enzymes have evolved highly specific shapes with
physical-chemical properties. As a result, enzymes typically attract only the
substrates necessary for a particular biochemical reaction. The active site of an
enzyme has the exquisitely selective affinity for its substrate(s). This affinity is
many times greater than those of inorganic catalysts for generic reactants. The
result is that enzymes are more efficient, faster catalysts.
Early ideas of how substrate-enzyme interaction could be so specific suggested a
Lock and Key mechanism, illustrated below.

Illustration by G. Bergtrom

According to this model, the affinity of enzyme for substrate brings them together,
after which the substrate uniquely fits into the active site like a key into a lock.

CMB3e

93

Once in the active site, the substrate(s) would undergo the bond rearrangements
specific for the catalyzed reaction to generate products and regenerate an
unchanged enzyme. But X-ray crystallography of enzyme-substrate interaction
revealed that the active site of the enzyme changes shape during catalysis. This
allosteric change suggested the revised, Induced Fit mechanism of enzyme action
modeled below.

Illustration by G.
Bergtrom

In this model, enzyme-substrate affinity causes the substrate to bind to the enzyme
surface. Once bound, the enzyme undergoes an allosteric change, drawing the
substrate(s) more tightly into the active site and catalyzing the reaction. Of course,
after the reaction products come off, the enzyme returns to its original shape.
146 Induced Fit Mechanism of Enzyme Action
2. Energetic Considerations of Catalysis
Catalysts work by lowering the activation energy (Ea) for a reaction, thereby
dramatically increasing the rate of the reaction. Activation energy is essentially a
barrier to getting interacting substrates together to actually undergo a biochemical
reaction. Compare the random motion of substrates in solution that occasionally
encounter one another. They even more rarely bump into one another in just the
right way to cause a reaction. This explains why adding more reactants or
increasing the temperature of a reaction can speed it up…, by increasing the

CMB3e

94

number of random as well as productive molecular collisions. Unlike molecules
and reactions in a test tube, living organisms do not have these options for
conducting fast biochemical reactions, or controlling reaction rates.
Inorganic catalytic surfaces attract reactants where catalysis can occur. The
attractions are weak compared to those of enzymes and their substrates. An
enzyme’s active site attracts otherwise randomly distributed substrates very
strongly, making enzyme catalysis faster than inorganic catalysis. Again, cells
cannot use inorganic catalysts, most of which are insoluble and would attract
reactants indiscriminately... not a good way for cells to control metabolism! The
advent of enzymes with their specificity and high rate of catalysis was a key event
in chemical evolution required for the origins of life. As we saw, allosteric change
during the ‘induction of fit’ enables specific catalysis. In fact, a catalyzed reaction
will be faster than the same reaction catalyzed by a piece of metal, and of course
much faster (millions of times faster!) than the uncatalyzed reaction. The
energetics of catalysis helps to explain why. Take a look at the energetics of a
simple reaction in which A & B are converted to C & D, shown below.

Illustration by G.
Bergtrom

Conducted in a closed system, enzyme-catalyzed reactions reach their equilibrium
more rapidly. As with all catalysts, enzymes are not consumed by the reactions
they catalyze, nor do they alter the equilibrium concentrations of reactants and
products of these reactions. The roughly 4000 biochemical reactions known to be
catalyzed in cells are undoubtedly an underestimate! But remember too, that we
estimate that the human genome has only 20,000 to 25,000 different genes!
147 Enzyme Activation Energy

CMB3e

95

B. Enzyme Regulation
We noted that some enzymes are regulated, which just means that factors in the cell
can slow down or speed up their rate of catalysis. In this way, the cell can respond
quickly to metabolic needs reflected by the intracellular levels of these factors.
Factors that slow down catalysis are called inhibitors. Those that speed up catalysis
are called activators. In addition to responding to intracellular molecular indicators of
the metabolic status of the cell, enzymes may be inhibited by drugs, poisons or
changes in the chemical milieu (e.g. pH). Since cellular reactions occur as part of
biochemical pathways, regulating a single enzyme can affect an entire pathway. For
example, look at the generic pathway illustrated below.

Illustration by G.
Bergtrom

This pathway exists to produce substance E. Under normal conditions, another series
of metabolic reactions would consume E. However, if the cell is meeting its metabolic
needs and no longer needs so much E, it will accumulate in the cell. If there is an
excess of E in the cell, it might bind to one of the enzymes. In the pathway shown, E
binds to enzyme 1. This binding causes an allosteric change inhibiting catalysis and
slowing down the entire pathway. In this example, of allosteric regulation, we can
assume that inhibitory regulation of enzyme 1 evolved to control the rate of production
of substance E. This is a common mode of enzyme allosteric regulation, called
feedback inhibition.
Enzymes can be regulated precisely because they can be bent out of shape (or into
shape for that matter!). Some small metabolites become chemical information when
they accumulate in cells, becoming the indicators of cellular metabolic status. The
result is a decrease or increase enzyme activities to achieve an appropriate cellular
response.

CMB3e

96

Whether an activator or an inhibitor of enzyme catalysis, regulatory molecules typically
bind to enzymes at allosteric regulatory sites, causing local allosteric changes that is
transmitted to the active site. Enzyme inhibition will occur if a change in shape
reduces the affinity of enzyme for substrate or the rate of the bond rearrangements
after the substrate has entered the active site. Enzyme activation would occur if the
allosteric effect were to increase this affinity and/or catalytic rate. The mechanism of
allosteric regulation of enzyme activity is illustrated below.

Illustration by G.
Bergtrom

148 Allosteric Regulation of Enzyme Activity
We can understand the effects changing rates of enzyme catalysis by determining
enzyme kinetics. By comparing kinetic data for each enzyme in a biochemical
pathway, one can determine a standard rate-limiting reaction under a given set of
conditions. For example, if clinical tests reveal that a patient is producing too much of
a biochemical metabolite, then the catalytic rate of the normally rate-limiting enzyme in
its pathway of synthesis may have increased. What then, if the patient is producing
too little of the metabolite? Either the catalytic rate of the rate-limiting enzyme has
decreased or the catalytic rate of another enzyme in the biochemical pathway has
become rate limiting. Reasons why a cellular biochemical would deviate from ‘normal’
levels include:



CMB3e

Viral & bacterial infection or environmental poisons: these can interfere with a
specific reaction in a metabolic pathway; remedies depend on this information!
Chronic illness resulting from mutational enzyme deficiencies: treatments
might include medications designed to enhance or inhibit (as appropriate) enzyme
activity.
97





Genetic illness tied to metabolic deficiency: if a specific enzyme is the culprit,
investigation of a pre- and/or post-natal course of treatment might be possible.
Life-style changes and choices: these might include eating habits, usually
remediated by a change in diet.
Life-Style changes brought on by circumstance rather than choice: these are
changes due to aging, such as the possibility of onset of Type 2 Diabetes; this can
be delayed by switching to a low carb diet favoring hormonal changes that improve
proper sugar metabolism.

Knowing the rate-limiting reaction(s) in biochemical pathways can identify regulated
enzymes and lead to a remedy to correct a metabolic imbalance. As noted, ribozymes
are RNA molecules that catalyze biochemical reactions; their kinetics can also be
analyzed and classified. Next, we look at an overview of enzyme kinetics (for clear,
detailed explanations of enzyme catalytic mechanisms, check out Jencks WP [1987,
Catalysis in Chemistry and Enzymology. Mineola, NY, Courier Dover Publications]).
We will consider how enzymes are regulated later, when we discuss glycolysis, a
biochemical pathway that most living things use to extract energy from nutrients.
C. Enzyme Kinetics
All catalyzed chemical reactions display saturation kinetics, as shown below.
Illustration by G. Bergtrom

Note how at high substrate concentration, the active sites on all the enzyme
molecules are bound to substrate molecules.

CMB3e

98

The experiment described below will determine the kinetics of the conversion of S
to P by enzyme E.

Illustration by G. Bergtrom

A series of reaction tubes are set up, each containing the same concentration of
enzyme ([E]) but different concentrations of substrate ([S]). The concentration of P
([P]) produced at different times just after the start of the reaction in each tube is
plotted to determine the initial rate of P formation for each concentration of substrate
tested (see below).

Illustration by G. Bergtrom

In this hypothetical example, the rates of the reactions (amount of P made over time)
do not increase at substrate concentrations higher than 4 X10-5 M. The upper curves
therefore represent the maximal rate of the reaction at the experimental concentration
of enzyme. We say that the maximal reaction rate occurs at saturation.

149 Measuring Enzyme Kinetics

CMB3e

99

Next, we can estimate the initial reaction rate (vo) at each substrate concentration by
plotting the slope of the first few time points through the origin of each curve in the
graph. Consider the graph below, of the initial reaction rates estimated in this way.

Illustration by G. Bergtrom

Each straight line is the vo for the reaction at a different [S] near the very beginning of
the reaction, when [S] is high and [P] is vanishingly low. Next, we plot these rates
(slopes, or vo values) against the different concentrations of S in the experiment to get
the curve of the reaction kinetics below.

Illustration by G. Bergtrom

This is an example of Michaelis-Menten kinetics common to many enzymes, named
after the two biochemists who realized that the curve described rectangular
hyperbola.

CMB3e

100

Put another way, the equation mathematically describes the mechanism of catalysis of
the enzyme. The equation below mathematically describes a rectangular hyperbola:

xa
y = x+b

You might be asked to understand the derivation of (or even derive!) the MichaelisMenten equation in a Biochemistry course. Suffice it to say here that Michaelis and
Menten started with some simple assumptions about how an enzyme-catalyzed
reaction would proceed and wrote reasonable chemical and rate equations for those
reactions. Here is one way to write the chemical equation for a simple reaction in
which an enzyme (E) catalyzes the conversion of substrate (S) to product (P):

S

E

P

Michaelis and Menten rationalized that this reaction might actually proceed in three
steps. In each step, E, the enzyme is treated as a reactant in the conversion of S to P.
The resulting chemical equations are shown below.

Reasoning that the middle reaction (the conversion of E-S to E-P) would be the fastest
one, and therefore would not be the rate-limiting reaction of catalysis, they only
considered the first and third reactions to be relevant in determining the overall
kinetics of product formation. Then they wrote the following rate equations for just
these two chemical reactions (as one would in an introductory chemistry course):

vE-S formation = k1[E][S] - k-1[E-S]
vP formation

= k2[E-S] - k-2[E][P]

Both of these equations describe a straight line, which does not describe the observed
hyperbolic reaction kinetics. Solving one for e.g., E-S and substituting the solution for

CMB3e

101

E-S in the other equation left a single equation that also described a straight line.
Again, not the expected rectangular hyperbola. To arrive at a chemical rate equation
consistent with a rectangular hyperbola, Michaelis and Menten made several
assumptions, including those made by G. E. Briggs and J. B. S. Haldane about how E,
S and P would behave in a catalyzed reaction.
It was those assumptions allowed them to re-write each equation, combine and rewrite
them into a single mathematical equation that did indeed describe a rectangular
hyperbola. Here are Briggs and Haldane’s assumptions:

We have already seen the equation that Michaelis and Menten derived and now
known as the Michaelis-Menten equation:

v0 =

Vmax[S]
Km + [S]

The take-home message here is that the assumptions about an enzyme-catalyzed
reaction are a good approximation of how the reaction proceeds over time.
Michaelis and Menten defined Vmax and Km as key kinetic factors in enzymatic
reactions. In the generic example of substrate conversion to product, we saw that
increasing [S] results in a higher rate of product formation because a higher rate of
encounters of enzyme and substrate molecules. At some point however, increasing
[S] does not increase the initial reaction rate any further. Instead, vo asymptotically
approaches a theoretical maximum for the reaction, defined as Vmax, the maximum
initial rate. As we have already seen, Vmax occurs when all available enzyme active
sites are saturated (occupied by substrate). At this point, the intrinsic catalytic rate
determines the turnover rate of the enzyme. The substrate concentration at which the
reaction rate has reached ½Vmax is defined as KM (the Michaelis-Menten constant).
The Km is a ratio of rate constants remaining after rewriting the rate equations for the
catalyzed reaction.
150 Graphing Enzyme Kinetic Data

CMB3e

102

To recapitulate, the two most important kinetic properties of an enzyme are:
1. how quickly the enzyme becomes saturated with a particular substrate, which is
related to the Km for the reaction, and
2. the maximum rate of the catalyzed reaction, described by the Vmax for the
reaction.
Knowing these properties suggests how an enzyme might behave under cellular
conditions, and can show how the enzyme should respond to allosteric regulation by
natural inhibitory or activating factors…, and to poisons or other anomalous chemicals.
You can find more details of how kinetic equations are derived (a necessary step in
understanding how the enzyme works) in any good biochemistry textbook, or check
out the Michaelis-Menten Kinetics entry in in the Enzymes Wikipedia link.

Introduction

We used to get metabolic pathways charts like the one you see here free from vendors of
biochemical reagents. This one is a high-resolution image; if you zoom in, you can
actually read the content…, but don’t feel you must! The big picture is correct in macrodetail, but the chart is likely out of date in small new details. In this chapter, we ‘zoom in’
on the small region in the middle of the chart, encompassing glycolysis and the Krebs
cycle.
We have looked at the principles governing thermodynamics (the flow of energy in the
universe) and bioenergetics (energy flow in living systems). We saw evidence that
energy can be exchanged between components in the universe, but that it can be neither
created nor destroyed. That makes the universe a closed system, a conclusion codified
as the first law of thermodynamics. Personally, I find it troubling that there is no escape
from the universe…, that is, until I remind myself that the universe is a pretty big place,
and I am but a small part of a small system. You can define systems for yourself: the
solar system, planet earth, the country you pledge allegiance to, your city or village, your
school, a farm or homestead…! Then you may derive comfort from the realization that
you can move from one system to another and even exchange goods and services
between them. This is a metaphor for energy flow between systems in the universe. We
also said that the first law applies to closed systems within the universe…, and that there
are no closed systems in the universe! Any system in the universe is open, always
exchanging energy and mass with neighboring systems. What we mean by the
term ‘closed system’ is that we can define and isolate some small part of the universe,
and then measure any energy that this isolated system gives up to its environment, or
takes in from it. The simplest demonstration of the first law in action was the bomb
calorimeter that measures heat released or absorbed during a chemical reaction.
The second concept said that energy flows from one place to another only when it can.
In the vernacular, we say that energy flows downhill. Anything that happens in the
universe (a galaxy moving through space, a planet rotating, you getting out of bed, coffee
perking, sugar burning in your cells, your DNA replicating) does so because of a downhill
flow of energy. We saw that by definition, any happening or event in the universe,

CMB3e

104

however large or small, is spontaneous, occurring with a release of free energy.
Remember, spontaneous means “by itself” and not necessarily instantaneous or fast!
Finally, we noted that that when enzymes catalyze biochemical reactions in a closed
system, the reactions still reach equilibrium, despite the higher rate of the catalyzed
reaction. What does this tell you about the energetics of catalyzed reactions in closed
systems?
With this brief reminder about energy flow and what enzymes do, we’ll turn to the
question of how our cells capture nutrient free energy. This will include examples of the
energetics of closed systems that reach equilibrium, and open systems that don’t! First
we’ll tackle glycolysis, an anaerobic pathway for generating chemical energy from
glucose, as well as the first of several pathways of respiration. Then we’ll look at
Gluconeogenesis, a regulated reversal of glycolysis. We ask when, where and why we
would want to make, rather than burn glucose. Finally, we begin a discussion of
respiration with a look at the Krebs Cycle.
The complete respiratory pathway can be summarized by the following equation:

C6H12O6 + 6O2

6CO2 + 6H2O

The standard free energy change for this reaction (Go) is about -687Kcal/mole. That is
the maximum amount of nutrient free energy that is (at least in theory) available from the
complete respiration of a mole of glucose. Given the cost of about 7.3 Kcal to make each
mole of ATP (adenosine triphosphate), how many moles of ATP might a cell produce after
burning a mole of glucose? We’ll figure this out here.
Learning Objectives
When you have mastered the information in this chapter, you should be able to:
1. explain the difference between fermentation and respiratory glycolysis and the role of
redox reactions in both processes.
2. calculate and then compare and contrast Go and G’ for the same reaction, and
explain any differences in free energy in open and closed systems.
3. describe and explain the major events of the first stage of glycolysis and trace the free
energy changes through the formation of G-3-P.
4. describe and explain the major events of the second stage of glycolysis and trace the
free energy changes through the formation of pyruvate and lactic acid.
5. state the role of redox reactions in glycolysis and fermentation.
6. compare and contrast glucose (i.e., carbohydrates in general), ATP, NADH and
FADH2 as high-energy molecules. [Just for fun, click Power in the Primordial Soup to
read some far out speculations on prebiotic high-energy molecules that might have
been around when ATP was being hired for the job!].

Glycolysis (from the Greek glyco (sugar) lysis (Separation), or
Sugar Breakdown

One of the properties of life is that living things require energy. The pathways of energy
flow through life are shown below.

Illustration by G. Bergtrom

CMB3e

106

To begin with, the most common intracellular energy currency with which livings things
“pay” for cellular work is ATP. The energy to make ATP on planet earth ultimately comes
from the sun via photosynthesis. Recall that light energy fuels the formation of glucose
and O2 from CO2 and water in green plants, algae, cyanobacteria and a few other
bacteria. Photosynthesis even produces some ATP directly, but not enough to fuel all
cellular and organismic growth and metabolism. So all cells, even plant cells, use
fermentation or respiration (anaerobic or aerobic processes respectively) to capture
nutrient free energy (mostly) as ATP.
ATP is called a high-energy intermediate because its hydrolysis releases a large
amount to free energy. In the condensation reactions that make ATP, it takes about 7.3
Kcal of free energy to link a phosphate to ADP in a phosphate ester linkage. Having
captured nutrient free energy in a form that cells can use, ATP hydrolysis releases that
free energy to fuel cellular work, including bending cilia, whipping flagella, contracting
muscles, transmitting neural information, building polymers from monomers, and more.
The energetics of ATP hydrolysis and synthesis are summarized below.

CMB3e

107

The free energy needed to make ATP in animal cells comes exclusively from nutrients
(sugars, fats, proteins). As noted, plants get free energy directly from sunlight, but they
mobilize nutrient free energy they make in much the same way as the rest of us get it
from what we eat! Glucose oxidation releases a considerable amount of free energy,
enough to synthesize many molecules of ATP, as shown below.

Cellular respiration, the oxidation of glucose, starts with glycolysis. Otto Myerhoff and
Archibald V. Hill shared a Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine with in 1923 for isolating
enzymes of glucose metabolism from muscle cells. Thanks to the efforts of others (e.g.,
Gustav Embden, Otto Meyerhof, Otto Warburg, Gerty Cori, Carl Cori), all the enzymes
and reactions of the glycolyitic pathway were known by 1940, and the pathway became
known as the Embden-Myerhoff Pathway. As we will see, glycolysis is an evolutionarily
conserved biochemical pathway used by all organisms to capture a small amount of
nutrient free energy. For more detail, check out Fothergill-Gilmore LA [(1986) The
evolution of the glycolytic pathway. Trends Biochem. Sci. 11:47-51]. The glycolytic
pathway occurs in the cytosol of cells where it breaks down each molecule of glucose
(C6H12O6) into two molecules of pyruvic acid (pyruvate; CH3COCOOH). This occurs in
two stages, capturing nutrient free energy in two ATP molecules per glucose molecule
that enters the pathway.

CMB3e

108

Glycolytic reactions are summarized below, highlighting the two stages of the pathway.

Illustration by G. Bergtrom

Stage 1 of glycolysis actually consumes ATP. Phosphates are transferred from ATP first
to glucose and then to fructose-6-phosphate, reactions catalyzed by hexokinase and
phosphofructokinase respectively. So, these Stage 1 phosphorylations consume
free energy. Later, in Stage 2 of glycolysis, nutrient free energy is captured in ATP and
NADH (reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide). NADH forms in redox reactions in
which NAD+ is reduced as some metabolite is oxidized. In Stage 2, it is glyceraldehyde3-phosphate that is oxidized…, but more later!
In fact, by the end of glycolysis, four molecules of ATP and two of NADH have been
formed and a single starting glucose molecule has been split into two molecules of
pyruvate. Pyruvate will be metabolized either anaerobically or aerobically.

151 Overview of Glycolysis
Anaerobic (complete) glycolysis is a fermentation pathway. In anaerobic glycolysis the
electrons in NADH produced in Stage 2 of glycolysis are used to reduce pyruvate, so that
in the end, there is no consumption of O2 and no net oxidation of nutrient (i.e., glucose).
A familiar anaerobic glycolytic pathway is the production of alcohol by yeast in the
absence of oxygen. Another one is the muscle fatigue you might have experienced after
especially vigorous and prolonged exercise. This results from a fermentation that
produces an anaerobic build-up of lactic acid in skeletal muscle cells. In anaerobic
glycolysis, the reduction of pyruvate can lead to one of several other fermentation end
products, along with a net yield of two ATPs per glucose fermented.
Aerobic (incomplete) glycolysis also produced two ATPs, and is the first step in the
complete oxidation of glucose, the respiration pathway oxidizing glucose to CO2 and
H2O, leaving no carbohydrates behind. Pyruvate is completely oxidized in mitochondria.
As we look at the reactions of glycolysis and the Krebs cycle, watch for redox reactions in
both pathways.
CMB3e

110

Along the way, we’ll also consider Gluconeogenesis, a pathway that essentially reverses
the glycolysis and results in glucose synthesis. Gluconeogenesis occurs both under
normal conditions, during in high-protein/low carb diets, and during fasting or starvation.
In another chapter, we’ll look at electron transport and oxidative phosphorylation, the
pathways that complete the oxidation of glucose. Here, we begin with a closer look at
glycolysis, focusing on the enzyme-catalyzed reactions and free energy transfers
between pathway components. We will consider the energetics and enzymatic features
of each reaction.

III.

Some Details of Glycolysis

A. Glycolysis, Stage 1
Reaction 1: In the first reaction of glycolysis, the enzyme hexokinase rapidly
phosphorylates glucose entering the cell, forming glucose-6-phosphate (G-6-P). As
shown below, the overall reaction is exergonic; the free energy change for the
reaction is -4 Kcal per mole of G-6-P synthesized.

Illustration by G. Bergtrom

This is a coupled reaction, in which phosphorylation of glucose is coupled to ATP
hydrolysis. The free energy of ATP hydrolysis (an energetically favorable reaction)
fuels the glucose phosphorylation (an energetically unfavorable reaction). The
reaction is also biologically irreversible, as shown by the single vertical arrow.

CMB3e

111

Excess dietary glucose can be stored in most cells (especially liver and kidney cells)
as a highly branched polymer of glucose monomers called glycogen. In green algae
and plants, glucose made by photosynthesis is stored as polymers of starch. When
glucose is necessary for energy, glycogen and starch hydrolysis forms glucose-1phosphate (G-1-P) which is then converted to G-6-P.
Let’s look at the energetics (free energy flow) of the hexokinase-catalyzed reaction.
This reaction can be seen as the sum of two reactions shown below.

Recall that ATP hydrolysis is an exergonic reaction, releasing ~7 Kcal/mole (rounding
down!) in a closed system under standard conditions. The condensation reaction of
glucose phosphorylation occurs with a Go of +3 Kcal/mole. This is an endergonic
reaction under standard conditions. Summing up the free energy changes of the two
reactions, we can calculate the overall Go of -4 Kcal/mole for the coupled reaction
under standard conditions in a closed system.

CMB3e

112

The reactions above are written as if they are reversible. However, we said that the
overall coupled reaction is biologically irreversible. Where’s the contradiction? To
explain, we say that an enzyme-catalyzed reaction is biologically irreversible when
the products have a relatively low affinity for the enzyme active site, making catalysis
(acceleration) of the reverse reaction very inefficient. Enzymes catalyzing biologically
irreversible reactions don’t allow going back to reactants, but they are often
allosterically regulated. This is the case for hexokinase. Imagine a cell that slows its
consumption of G-6-P because its energy needs are being met. What happens when
G-6-P levels rise in cells? You might expect the hexokinase reaction to slow down so
that the cell doesn’t unnecessarily consume a precious nutrient energy resource. The
allosteric regulation of hexokinase is illustrated below.

As G-6-P concentrations rise in the cell, excess G-6-P binds to an allosteric site on
hexokinase. The conformational change in the enzyme is then transferred to the
active site, inhibiting the reaction.
152 Glycolysis Stage 1, Reaction 1

CMB3e

113

Reaction 2: In this slightly endergonic and reversible reaction, isomerase catalyzes
the isomerization of G-6-P to fructose-6-P (F-6-P), as shown below.

Reaction 3: In this biologically irreversible reaction, 6-phosphofructokinase (6-Pfructokinase) catalyzes the phosphorylation of F-6-P to make fructose 1,6 diphosphate (F1,6 diP). This is also a coupled reaction, in which ATP provides the
second phosphate. The overall reaction is written as the sum of two reactions, as
shown below.

CMB3e

114

Like the hexokinase reaction, the 6-P-fructokinase reaction is a coupled, exergonic
and allosterically regulated reaction. Multiple allosteric effectors, including ATP,
ADP and AMP and long-chain fatty acids regulate this enzyme.
Reactions 4 and 5: These are the last reactions of the first stage of glycolysis. In
reaction 4, F1,6 diP (a 6-C sugar) is reversibly split into dihydroxyacetone phosphate
(DHAP) and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate (G-3-P). In reaction 5 (also reversible),
DHAP is converted into another G-3-P. Here are the reactions:

The net result is the formation of two molecules of G-3-P in the last reactions of Stage
1 of glycolysis. The enzymes F-diP aldolase and triose-P-isomerase both catalyze
freely reversible reactions. Also, both reactions proceed with a positive free energy
change and are therefore endergonic. The sum of the free energy changes for the
splitting of F1,6 diP into two G-3-Ps is a whopping +7.5 Kcal per mole, a very
energetically unfavorable process.
Summing up, by the end of Stage 1 of glycolysis, we have consumed two ATP
molecules, and split one 6C carbohydrate into two 3-C carbohydrates. We have also
seen two biologically irreversible and allosterically regulated enzymes.
153 Glycolysis Stage 1; Reactions 2-5

CMB3e

115

B. Glycolysis, Stage 2
We will follow just one of the two molecules of G-3-P generated by the end of Stage 1
of glycolysis, but remember that both are proceeding through Stage 2 of glycolysis.
Reaction 6: This is a redox reaction. G-3-P is oxidized to 1,3, diphosphoglyceric acid
(1,3, diPG) and NAD+ is reduced to NADH. The reaction catalyzed by
glyceraldehyde-3-phopsphate dehydrogenase is shown below.

In this freely reversible endergonic reaction, a hydrogen molecule (H2) is removed
from G-3-P, leaving behind phosphoglyceric acid. This short-lived oxidation
intermediate is phosphorylated to make 1,3 diphosphoglyceric acid (1,3diPG). At the
same time, the hydrogen molecule is split into a hydride ion (H-) and a proton (H+).
The H- ions reduce NAD+ to NADH, leaving the protons behind in solution. Remember
that all of this is happening in the active site of the same enzyme!
Even though it catalyzes a reversible reaction, G-3-P dehydrogenase is allosterically
regulated. However, in contrast to the regulation of hexokinase, that of G-3-P
dehydrogenase is more complicated! The regulator is NAD+ and the mechanism of
allosteric regulation of G-3-P dehydrogenase by NAD+ is called negative
cooperativity. It turns out that the higher the [NAD+] in the cell, the lower the affinity
of the enzyme for more NAD+ and the faster the reaction in the cell! The mechanism
is discussed at the link below.
154 Glycolysis Stage 2; Reaction 6

CMB3e

116

Reaction 7: The reaction shown below is catalyzed by phosphoglycerate kinase. It
is freely reversible and exergonic, yielding ATP and 3-phosphoglyceric acid (3PG).

Catalysis of phosphate group transfer between molecules by kinases is called
substrate-level phosphorylation, often the phosphorylation of ADP to make ATP. In
this coupled reaction the free energy released by hydrolyzing a phosphate from 1,3
diPG is used to make ATP. Remember that this reaction occurs twice per starting
glucose. Two ATPs have been synthesized to this point in glycolysis. We call 1,3
diPG a very high-energy phosphate compound.
Reaction 8: This freely reversible endergonic reaction moves the phosphate from the
number 3 carbon of 3PG to the number 2 carbon as shown below.

Mutases like phoshoglycerate mutase catalyze transfer of functional groups within a
molecule.

CMB3e

117

Reaction 9: In this reaction (shown below), enolase catalyzes the conversion of 2PG
to phosphoenol pyruvate (PEP).

Reaction 10: This reaction results in the formation of pyruvic acid (pyruvate), as
shown below. Remember again, two pyruvates are produced per starting glucose
molecule.

The enzyme pyruvate kinase couples the biologically irreversible, exergonic hydrolysis
of a phosphate from PEP and transfer of the phosphate to ADP in a coupled reaction.
The reaction product, PEP, is another very high-energy phosphate compound.
155 Glycolysis Stage 2; Reactions 7-10
Pyruvate kinase is allosterically regulated by ATP, citric acid, long-chain fatty acids,
F1,6 diP, and one of its own substrates, PEP.

CMB3e

118

In incomplete (aerobic) glycolysis, pyruvate is oxidized in mitochondria during
respiration (see the Alternate Fates of Pyruvate above). Fermentations are called
complete glycolysis because pyruvate is reduced to one or another end product.
Recall that muscle fatigue results when skeletal muscle uses anaerobic fermentation
to get energy during vigorous exercise. When pyruvate is reduced to lactic acid
(lactate), lactic acid accumulation causes muscle fatigue. The enzyme Lactate
Dehydrogenase (LDH) that catalyzes this reaction is regulated, but not allosterically.
Instead different muscle tissues regulate LDH by making different versions of the
enzyme! Click the Link below for an explanation.
156 Fermentation: Regulation of Pyruvate Reduction is NOT Allosteric!
C. A Chemical and Energy Balance Sheet for Glycolysis
Compare the balance sheets for complete glycolysis (fermentation) to lactic acid and
incomplete (aerobic) glycolysis, showing chemical products and energy transfers.

There are two reactions in Stage 2 of glycolysis that each yield a molecule of ATP.
Since each of these reactions occurs twice per starting glucose molecule, Stage 2 of
glycolysis produces four ATP molecules. Since Stage 1 consumed two ATPs, the net
yield of chemical energy as ATP by the end of glycolysis is two ATPs, whether
complete to lactate or incomplete to pyruvate! Because they can’t make use of
oxygen, anaerobes have to settle for the paltry 15 Kcal worth of ATP that they get

CMB3e

119

from a fermentation. Since there are 687 Kcal potentially available from the complete
combustion of a mole of glucose, there is a lot more free energy left to be captured
during the rest of respiration.
157 Balance Sheet of Glycolysis
Remember also that the only redox reaction in aerobic glycolysis is in Stage 2. This is
the oxidation of G-3-P, a 3C glycolytic intermediate. Now check out the redox reaction
a fermentation pathway. Since pyruvate, also a 3C intermediate, was reduced, there
has been no net oxidation of glucose (i.e., glycolytic intermediates) in complete
glycolysis.
By this time, you will have realized that glycolysis is a net energetically favorable
(downhill, spontaneous) reaction pathway in a closed system, with an overall negative
Go. Glycolysis is also normally spontaneous in most of our cells, driven by a
constant need for energy to do cellular work. Thus the actual free energy of
glycolysis, or G’, is also negative. In fact, glycolysis in actively respiring cells
proceeds with release of more free energy than it would in a closed system. In other
words, the G’ for glycolysis in active cells is more negative than the Go of
glycolysis!
Now, for a moment, let’s look at gluconeogenesis, the Atkins Diet and some not-sonormal circumstances when glycolysis essentially goes in reverse, at least in a few
cell types. Under these conditions, glycolysis is energetically unfavorable, and those
reverse reactions are the ones proceeding with a negative G’!

IV. Gluconeogenesis
In a well-fed animal, most cells can store a small amount of glucose as glycogen. All cells
break glycogen down as needed to retrieve nutrient energy as G-6-P. Glycogen
hydrolysis, or glycogenolysis, produces G-1-P that is converted to G-6-P, as we saw at
the top of Stage 1 of glycolysis. But, glycogen in most cells is quickly used up between
meals. Therefore, most cells depend on a different, external source of glucose other than
diet. Those sources are liver and to a lesser extent, kidney cells, that can store large
amounts of glycogen after meals. In continual feeders (for examples cows
and other ruminants), glycogenolysis is ongoing. In intermittent feeders (like us), liver
glycogenolysis can supply glucose to the blood for 6-8 hours between meals, to be
distributed as needed to all cells of the body. Thus, you can expect to use up liver and
kidney glycogen reserves after a good night’s sleep, a period of intense exercise, or any

CMB3e

120

prolonged period of low carbohydrate intake (fasting or starvation). Under these
circumstances, animals use gluconeogenesis (literally, new glucose synthesis) in liver
and kidney cells to provide systemic glucose to nourish other cells. As always in
otherwise healthy individuals, the hormones insulin and glucagon regulate blood glucose
homeostasis, protecting against hypoglycemia (low blood sugar) and hyperglycemia (high
blood sugar) respectively. The gluconeogenic pathway produces glucose from
carbohydrate and non-carbohydrate precursor substrates. These precursors include
pyruvate, lactate, glycerol and gluconeogenic amino acids. The latter are amino acids
that can be converted to alanine. Look at the side-by-side reactions of glycolysis and
gluconeogenesis on the next page. Look for the two bypass reactions, catalyzed by two
carboxylases and two phosphatases (brown in the illustration) and the glycolytic reactions
that function in reverse during gluconeogenesis.

CMB3e

121

If glycolysis is an exergonic pathway, then gluconeogenesis must be an endergonic one.
In fact, while glycolysis through two pyruvates generates a net of two ATPs,
gluconeogenesis from two pyruvate to glucose costs 4 ATPs and two GTPs! Likewise,
gluconeogenesis is only possible if the bypass enzymes are present. These are
necessary to get around the three biologically irreversible reactions of glycolysis.
Except for the bypass reactions, gluconeogenesis is essentially a reversal of glycolysis.
As drawn in the pathways above, glycolysis and gluconeogenesis would seem to be
cyclic. In fact this apparent cycle was recognized by Carl and Gerti Cori, who shared the
1947 Nobel Prize for Medicine or Physiology with Bernardo Houssay for discovering how
glycogen is broken down to pyruvate in muscle (in fact most) cells, which can then be
used to resynthesize glucose in liver cells. Named after the Coris, The Cori Cycle, shown
below, recognizes the interdependence of liver and muscle in glucose breakdown and
resynthesis.

In spite of this free energy requirement, gluconeogenesis is energetically favorable in liver
and kidney cells! This is because the cells are open systems. The accumulation of
pyruvate in liver cells and a rapid release of new glucose into the blood drives the
energetically favorable reactions of gluconeogenesis forward. Thus, under

CMB3e

122

gluconeogenic conditions, glucose synthesis occurs with a negative G’, a decline in
actual free energy. Of course, glycolysis and gluconeogenesis are not simultaneous!
Which pathways operate in which cells is tightly controlled.
Glycolysis is the norm in all cell types, even in liver and kidney. However, the cessation
of glycolysis in favor of gluconeogenesis in the latter cells is under hormonal control, as
illustrated below.

hypothalamicpituitary
axis

Illustration by G. Bergtrom

Key in turning on liver gluconeogenesis is the role of glucocorticoid hormones. What
causes the secretion of glucocorticoids? A long night’s sleep, fasting and more
extremely, starvation are forms of stress. Stress responses starts in the hypothalamicpituitary axis. Different stressors cause the hypothalamus to secrete a neurohormone
that in turn, stimulates the release of ACTH (adrenocorticotropic hormone) from the

CMB3e

123

pituitary gland. ACTH then stimulates the release of cortisone and other glucocorticoids
from the cortex (outer layer) of the adrenal glands. As the name glucocorticoid suggests,
these hormones participate in the regulation of glucose metabolism. Here is what
happens at times of low blood sugar (e.g., when carbohydrate intake is low):
1. Glucocorticoids stimulate the synthesis of gluconeogenic bypass enzymes in liver
cells.
2. Glucocorticoids stimulate protease synthesis in skeletal muscle, causing hydrolysis of
the peptide bonds between amino acids. Gluconeogenic amino acids circulate to the
liver where they are converted to pyruvate, a major precursor of gluconeogenesis.
Some amino acids are ketogenic; they are converted to Acetyl-S-CoA, a precursor to
ketone bodies.
 Glucocorticoids stimulate increased levels of enzymes including lipases that
catalyze hydrolysis of the ester linkages in triglycerides (fat) in adipose and other
cells. This generates fatty acids and glycerol.
 Glycerol circulates to liver cells that take it up convert it to G-3-P, augmenting
gluconeogenesis. Fatty acids circulate to liver cells where they are oxidized to
Acetyl-S-CoA that is then converted to ketone bodies. and released to the
cisculation.
 Most cells use fatty acids as an alternate energy nutrient when glucose is limiting. ,
and while heart and brain cells depend on glucose for energy, brain cells can use
ket9one bodies as an alternate energy course.
Thus essential roles of glucocorticoids include
1. enabling most cells to oxidize fats (fatty acids) for energy
2. allowing brain cells to use gluconeogenic glucose for energy, and in the extreme,
ketone bodies as an alternate energy source
3. allowing cardiac muscle to use gluconeogenic glucose as its energy source.
It’s a pity that we humans cannot use fatty acids as gluconeogenic substrates! Plants and
some lower animals have a glyoxalate cycle pathway that can convert the products of
fatty acid oxidation (acetate) directly into carbohydrates that can enter the gluconeogenic
pathway. Lacking this pathway, we (and higher animals in general) cannot convert fats to
carbohydrates, in spite of the fact that we can all too easily convert the latter to the
former!
The dark side of bad eating habits is prolonged starvation that can overwhelm the
gluconeogenic response. You see this in reports from third world regions suffering
starvation due to drought or other natural disaster, or war. The spindly arms and legs of
starving children result from muscle wasting as the body tries to provide the glucose

CMB3e

124

necessary for survival. When the gluconeogenic response is inadequate to the task, the
body can resort to ketogenic fat metabolism. Think of this as a last resort, leading to the
production of ketone bodies and the “acetone breath” in starving people.

V. The Atkins Diet and Gluconeogenesis
You may know that the Atkins Diet is an ultra-low carb diet. It is one of several low-carb
ketogenic diets. The glucocorticoid hormones released on a low carb diet trick the body
into a constant gluconeogenic state. While the liver can produce enough glucose for
brain and heart cells, the rest of the cells in our bodies switch to burning fats, hence the
weight loss. Discredited some years ago, the Atkins Diet (and similar ones e.g., South
Beach) is now back in favor. Some folks on these diets restrict their intake of
carbohydrates so much that they can develop “acetone breath”! Nevertheless, low carb
diets are important in the control of diabetes. In older folks, type 2 (adult-onset) diabetics
can control their disease with a low carb diet and a drug called metformin, which blocks
gluconeogenesis and therefore prevents glucose synthesis from gluconeogenic
substrates, at the same time stimulating cellular receptors to take up available glucose.
For more details on the mechanism of metformin action, check out Hundal RS et al.
[(2000) Mechanism by Which Metformin Reduces Glucose Production in Type 2
Diabetes. Diabetes 49 (12): 2063–9]. Given the prevalence of obesity and type 2
diabetes in the U.S., it’s likely that someone you know is taking metformin or other similar
medication!

VI. The Krebs/TCA/Citric acid cycle
Glycolysis through fermentative reactions produces ATP anaerobically. The evolution of
respiration (the aerobic use of oxygen to efficiently burn nutrient fuels) had to wait until
photosynthesis created the oxygenic atmosphere we live in now. Read more about the
source of our oxygenic atmosphere in Dismukes GC et al. [(2001) The origin of
atmospheric oxygen on earth: the innovation of oxygenic photosynthesis. Proc. Nat.
Acad. Sci. USA 98:2170-2175].
The Krebs cycle is the first pathway of oxygenic respiration. Evolution of this respiration
and the chemical bridge from glycolysis to the Krebs cycle, no doubt occurred a few
reactions at a time, perhaps at first as a means of protecting anaerobic cells from the
‘poisonous’ effects of oxygen. Later, natural selection fleshed out the aerobic Krebs
cycle, electron transport and oxidative phosphorylation pathways we see today.

CMB3e

125

Whatever its initial utility, these reactions were an adaptive response to the increase in
oxygen in the earth’s atmosphere. As a pathway for getting energy out of nutrients,
respiration is much more efficient than glycolysis. Animals rely on it, but even plants and
photosynthetic algae use the respiratory pathway when sunlight is not available! Here we
focus on oxidative reactions in mitochondria, beginning with pyruvate oxidation and
continuing to the redox reactions of the Krebs cycle.
After entering the mitochondria, pyruvate dehydrogenase catalyzes pyruvate oxidation to
Acetyl-S-Coenzyme A (Ac-S-CoA). Then the Krebs cycle completely oxidizes the Ac-SCoA. These mitochondrial redox reactions generate CO2 and lot of reduced electron
carriers (NADH, FADH2). The free energy released in these redox reactions is coupled to
the synthesis of only one ATP per pyruvate oxidized (i.e., two per the glucose we started
with!). It is the NADH and FADH2 molecules have captured most of the free energy in the
original glucose molecules. These entry of pyruvate into the mitochondrion and its
oxidation are summarized below.

Illustration by G.

Pyruvate oxidation converts a 3C carbohydrate into acetate, a 2C molecule, releasing a
molecule of CO2. In this highly exergonic reaction, CoA-SH forms a high-energy thioester
linkage with the acetate in Ac-S-CoA. The oxidation of pyruvic acid results in the
reduction of NAD+, production of Ac-S-CoA and a molecule of CO2, as shown below.

CMB3e

126

The Krebs cycle functions during respiration to oxidize Ac-S-CoA and to reduce NAD+
and FAD to NADH and FADH2 (respectively). Intermediates of the Krebs cycle also
function in amino acid metabolism and interconversions. All aerobic organisms alive
today share the Krebs cycle we see in humans. This is consistent with its spread early in
the evolution of our oxygen environment. Because of the central role of Krebs cycle
intermediates in other biochemical pathways, parts of the pathway may even have predated the complete respiratory pathway. The Krebs cycle takes place in mitochondria of
eukaryotic cells.
After the oxidation of pyruvate, the Ac-S-CoA enters the Krebs cycle, condensing with
oxaloacetate in the cycle to form citrate. There are four redox reactions in the Krebs
cycle. As we discuss the Krebs cycle, look for the accumulation of reduced electron
carriers (FADH2, NADH) and a small amount of ATP synthesis by substrate-level
phosphorylation. Also, follow the carbons in pyruvate into CO2. The Krebs Cycle as it
occurs in animals is summarized below.

Illustration by G. Bergtrom

CMB3e

127

To help you understand the events of the cycle,
1. find the two molecules of CO2 produced in the Krebs cycle itself.
2. find GTP (which quickly transfers its phosphate to ADP to make ATP). Note that in
bacteria, ATP is made directly at this step.
3. count all of the reduced electron carriers (NADH, FADH2). Both of these electron
carriers carry a pair of electrons. If you include the electrons on each of the NADH
molecules made in glycolysis, how many electrons have been removed from glucose
during its complete oxidation?
Remember that glycolysis produces two pyruvates per glucose, and thus two molecules
of Ac-S-CoA. Thus, the Krebs cycle turns twice for each glucose entering the glycolytic
pathway. The high-energy thioester bonds formed in the Krebs cycle fuel ATP synthesis
as well as the condensation of oxaloacetate and acetate to form citrate in the first
reaction. Each NADH carries about 50 Kcal of the 687 Kcal of free energy originally
available in a mole of glucose; each FADH2 carries about 45 Kcal of this free energy.
This energy will fuel ATP production during electron transport and oxidative
phosphorylation.
159 Highlights of the Krebs Cycle
Finally, the story of the discovery of the Krebs cycle is as interesting as the cycle itself!
Albert Szent-Györgyi won a Nobel Prize in 1937 for discovering some organic acid
oxidation reactions initially thought to be part of a linear pathway. Hans Krebs did the
elegant experiments showing that the reactions were part of a cyclic pathway. He
proposed (correctly!) that the cycle would be a supercatalyst that would catalyze the
oxidation of yet another organic acid. Some of the experiments are described by Krebs
and his coworkers in their classic paper: Krebs HA, et al. [(1938) The formation of citric
and α-ketoglutaric acids in the mammalian body. Biochem. J. 32: 113–117]. Hans Krebs
and Fritz Lipmann shared the 1953 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine. Krebs was
recognized for his elucidation of the TCA cycle, which now more commonly carries his
name. Lipmann was recognized for proposing ATP as the mediator between food
(nutrient) energy and intracellular work energy, and for discovering the reactions that
oxidize pyruvate and synthesize Ac-S-CoA, bridging the Krebs Cycle and oxidative
phosphorylation (to be considered iin the next chapter)..

Introduction

We have seen that glycolysis generates two pyruvate molecules per glucose molecule,
and that the subsequent oxidation of each pyruvate generates two Ac-S-CoA molecules.
After the further oxidation of each Ac-S-CoA by the Krebs cycle, aerobic cells have
captured about 30 Kcal out of the 687 Kcal potentially available from a mole of glucose in
two molecules of ATP. Not much for all that biochemical effort! However, a total of 24
H+ (protons) pulled from glucose in redox reactions have also been captured, in the form
or the reduced electron carriers NADH and FADH2. We begin here with a look at
electron transport and oxidative phosphorylation, the linked (“coupled”) mechanism
that transfers much of nutrient free energy into ATP. We will see that the free energy
released by the transport of electrons from the reduced electron carriers is captured in a
proton (H+) gradient. Then we’ll see how dissipation of this gradient releases free
energy to fuel ATP synthesis by oxidative phosphorylation. Next, we will contrast
mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation with the substrate-level phosphorylation we saw
in glycolysis and the Krebs cycle. After presenting an energy balance sheet for
respiration, we look at how cells capture of free energy from alternate nutrients. Then we
discuss photosynthesis (overall, the opposite of respiration) and conclude by comparing
photosynthesis and respiration.

All cells use an electron transport chain (ETC) to oxidize substrates in exergonic
reactions. The electron flow from reduced substrates through an ETC is like the
movement of electrons between the poles of a battery. In the case of the battery, the
electron flow releases free energy to power a motor, light, cell phone, etc. In the
mitochondrial ETC, electrons flow when the reduced electron (NADH, FADH2) are
oxidized. In plants and other photosynthetic organisms, an ETC serves to oxidize
NADPH (a phosphorylated version of the electron carrier NADH). In both cases, free
energy released when the redox reactions of an ETC are coupled to the active transport
of protons (H+ ions) across a membrane. The result is a chemical gradient of H+ ions as
well as a pH gradient. Since protons are charged, the proton gradient is also an electrical
gradient. In a kind of shorthand, we say that the free energy once in reduced substrates
is now in an electrochemical gradient. That gradient free energy is captured in ATP
synthesis reactions coupled to the flow (diffusion) of protons back across the membrane
in the process called oxidative phosphorylation. In aerobic respiration, electrons are
ultimately transferred from components at the end of the ETC to a final electron acceptor
molecular oxygen, O2, making water. In photosynthesis, electron transfer reduces CO2 to
sugars.
The Chemiosmotic Mechanism explained how the creation of an electrochemical
gradient and how gradient free energy ends up in ATP. For this insight, Peter Mitchell
won the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1978. You can read Mitchell’s original proposal of
the chemiosmosis model of mitochondrial ATP synthesis in Mitchell P (1961) Coupling of
phosphorylation to electron and hydrogen transfer by a chemiosmotic type of mechanism.
Nature 191:144-148. Here we focus on the details of respiration as it occurs in the
mitochondria of eukaryotic cells. The end products of electron transport are NAD+, FAD,
water and protons. The protons end up outside the mitochondrial matrix because they
are pumped across the cristal membrane using the free energy of electron transport.

and cytochrome C (Cyt c) constitute the ETC), the sequence of reactions that oxidize

electron carriers are transferred from one ETC complex to the next. At the end of chain,

CMB3e

132

electrons, protons and oxygen unite in complex IV to make water. As you might expect,
under standard conditions in a closed system, electron transport is downhill, with an
overall release of free energy (negative Go) at equilibrium.
In the illustration above, we can see three sites in the respiratory ETC that function as H+
pumps. At these sites, the negative change in free energy of electron transfer is large
and coupled to the action of a pump. The result is that protons accumulate outside the
matrix of the mitochondrion. Because the outer mitochondrial membrane is freely
permeable to protons, the electrochemical gradient is in effect between the cytoplasm and
the mitochondrial matrix. Proton flow back into the mitochondrial matrix through lollipopshaped ATP synthase complexes releases the gradient free energy that is harnessed as
chemical energy.
164 Proton Pumps Store Free Energy of the ETC in Proton Gradients

III. Oxidative Phosphorylation
Oxidative phosphorylation is the mechanism that by which ATP captures the free
energy in the mitochondrial proton gradient. Most of the ATP made in aerobic organisms
is made by oxidative phosphorylation, rather than by substrate phosphorylation (the
mechanism of ATP synthesis in glycolysis or the Krebs cycle). Some aerobic chemistry
may have evolved in response to the toxic effects of rising environmental oxygen levels.
Later elaboration of respiratory metabolism were undoubtedly selected because it turns
out to be more efficient at making ATP than anaerobic fermentations such as ‘complete’
glycolysis. In other words, oxidative phosphorylation fueled by electron transport is more
efficient that substrate-level phosphorylation. Oxidative phosphorylation couples
controlled diffusion of protons through the cristal membrane ATP synthase to ATP
production.
To summarize here, the movement of electrons down the electron transport chain fuels
three proton pumps that establish a proton gradient across the cristal membrane that
stores free energy. We say that the proton gradient has a proton-motive force, resulting
from the difference in proton concentration (an H+ or pH gradient) and a difference in
electric potential. The use of this force to make ATP is regulated.
Conditions in the cell control when the energy stored in this gradient will be released to
make ATP. The switch that allows protons to flow across the cristal membrane to relieve
the proton gradient is an ATP synthase, a tiny, complex enzymatic protein motor. For a
clear discussion of this complex enzyme, see P. D. Boyer (1997) The ATP synthase – a
splendid molecular machine. Ann. Rev. Biochem. 66:717-749.

CMB3e

133

The capture of free energy of protons flowing through the complex is summarized below.

Illustration by G. Bergtrom

In mitochondria, the protons pumped out of the mitochondrial matrix (using the free
energy released by electron transport) can then flow back into the matrix through the ATP
synthase. If the three ETC sites in the cristal membrane that actively transport protons
are proton pumps, then the cristal membrane ATP synthase complexes function as
regulated proton gates that catalyzes ATP synthesis when protons are allowed to flow
through them. For their discovery of the details of ATP synthase function, P. D. Boyer
and J. E. Walker shared the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1997.
165 Proton Gates Capture Proton Gradient Free Energy as ATP
The ratio of ATP to ADP concentrations regulates proton flow through the ATP synthase
gates is regulated. A high ATP/ADP ratio in the mitochondrial matrix indicates that the
cell does not need more ATP, closing the proton gate remains closed so that the proton
gradient cannot be relieved. On the other hand, a low ATP/ADP ratio in the matrix means
that the cell is hydrolyzing a lot of ATP…, and that the cell needs more. Then the proton
gate opens, and protons flow through cristal membrane ATP synthases back into the
matrix along a concentration gradient. As they flow, they release the free energy that
powers a protein motor in the enzyme that in turn, activates ATP synthesis. Recall that

CMB3e

134

according to the endosymbiotic theory, aerobic bacteria are the evolutionary ancestor to
mitochondria; in fact, the cell membrane of aerobic bacteria house an ETC and
chemiosmotic mechanism of ATP generation much like that in mitochondria.
Proton gradients do not only power ATP synthesis, but can also power cellular work quite
directly. The well-known example is the bacterial flagellum driven directly by proton flow
through cell membrane proton gate/molecular motor complex (below).

Electron transport in the cell membrane creates the gradient, and relief of the gradient
directly powers the flagellum.

CMB3e

135

Just as we did for glycolysis, we can count the ATPs and see how much free energy we
get from aerobic respiration, i.e., the complete oxidation of glucose. You can see this in
the link below.
166 A Balance Sheet for Respiration

IV. Photosynthesis
Chemically, photosynthesis is the reverse reaction of respiration. Compare the two
reactions:

1. C6H12O6 + 6O2
2. 6CO2 + 6H2O

6CO2 + 6H2O (Go = -687Kcal/mole)
C6H12O6 + 6O2 (Go = +687Kcal/mole)

If respiration (reaction 1) is the complete oxidation of glucose to H2O and CO2, then
photosynthesis (reaction 2) is the reduction of CO2 using electrons from H2O.
Photosynthesis is thus an endergonic reaction. During photosynthesis, sunlight
(specifically visible light), fuels the reduction of CO2 (summarized below).

Illustration by G. Bergtrom

CMB3e

136

Photosynthesis began in the absence of oxygen; it came before oxygenic respiration on
earth. Increasing oxygen in the atmosphere led to selection of oxygenic respiratory
pathways (the Krebs cycle, electron transport and oxidative phosphorylation). When we
look at photosynthesis in some detail, we will see that photosynthesis and respiration
have electron transport-ATP synthesizing systems with similar features. This suggests
that they share a common evolutionary ancestry. Elsewhere, we will consider what a
common ancestral system might have looked like. Two biochemical pathways make up
photosynthesis:
 Light-dependent reactions that use visible light energy to remove electrons from
water, reduce electron carriers, pump protons and make ATP;
 Light-independent reactions that use ATP to transfer electrons from the reduced
electron carriers to CO2 to synthesize glucose.
The two pathways are summarized below.

Illustration by G. Bergtrom

A. The Light Dependent Reactions
Colored substances contain pigments that reflect the colors that we see and at the
same time, absorb all the other colors of visible light. Early studies asked which plant
pigments absorbed the light that allowed (we say supported) photosynthesis.
Chlorophyll, the abundant pigment we see in plant tissues is actually two separate
green pigments, chlorophyll a and chlorophyll b. One might therefore predict that
light absorbed by chlorophyll will support photosynthesis, but light absorbed by other
pigments in plant cells would not.

CMB3e

137

The experiment to test this hypothesis is illustrated below.

Illustration by G. Bergtrom

The action spectrum of photosynthesis below plots the results of this experiment.

Illustration by G. Bergtrom

The spectrum shows that all wavelengths of visible light energy support
photosynthesis. In addition, other experiments revealed that radiation other than
visible light (e.g., ultraviolet and infrared light) do not support photosynthesis. One
can conclude that chlorophylls alone are likely not the only pigments to support
photosynthesis.

CMB3e

138

Chlorophylls are easily purified from leaves. The graph below shows an average
absorbance spectrum for of chlorophylls. The absorbance of chlorophyll a and
chlorophyll b are slightly different, but center at wavelengths at 450 nm and 675 nm.

Illustration by G. Bergtrom

We can conclude from the absorbance spectra that chlorophylls do support
photosynthesis, but that, indeed, they are not alone in doing so. Chlorophylls alone do
not account for the action spectrum of photosynthesis! Clearly, other pigments
absorbing elsewhere in the visible spectrum also support photosynthesis. Of course,
we knew that leaves and other photosynthetic plant tissues contained a variety of
different pigments, many of which we see as fall colors. All of these pigments
(including chlorophylls) are found in the chloroplasts, the organelles that conduct
photosynthesis in plants. Examine the structure of chloroplasts in the electron
micrographs below.

The visible light absorbance spectra of three different kinds of plant pigments shown
below do coincide with the action spectrum of photosynthesis. This implies that
absorption of light by those pigments is responsible for photosynthesis.

Illustration by G. Bergtrom

Carotenoids, chlorophyll b and other accessory pigments participate in capturing
light energy for photosynthesis. Two clusters of pigments capture light energy. These
reaction centers are part of photosystems 1 and photosystem 2 on thylakoid
membranes of chloroplasts. Johann Deisenhofer, Robert Huber and Hartmut Michel
first determined the 3D structure of a bacterial reaction center. Then they and
unraveled the relationship between the structure of the proteins in the center and the
membrane in which they were embedded. For this, they shared the 1988 Nobel Prize
in Chemistry.
The activities of Photosystem I are animated at Photosystem 1 Action. You should
see light (a photon) excite electron (e-) pairs excited from Photosystem I pigments that
then transfer their energy from pigment to pigment, ultimately to chlorophyll a P700.
The impact of the electron pair then excites a pair of electrons from chlorophyll a
P700. This e- pair is captured by a photosystem I (PSI) e- acceptor. Next, the
reduced PSI acceptor is oxidized as electrons move down a short ETC, eventually
reducing NADP+ to NADPH. Electrons on NADPH will eventually be used to reduce

CMB3e

140

CO2 to a carbohydrate. So far, so good! But that leaves an electron deficit in
Photosystem I. The Z-Scheme illustrated below follows electrons taken from water
(absorbed through roots) into photosystem II (PSII), which will replace those missing
from PSI.

Illustration by G. Bergtrom

Let’s summarize the flow of electrons from water through the Z-scheme. Light excites
an e- pair from the P680 form of chlorophyll a in PSII. A PSII electron acceptor in the
thylakoid membrane, identified as pheophytin, captures these electrons. An electron
transport chain oxidizes the pheophytin, transferring e- pairs down to PSI. Some of
the free energy released pumps protons from the stroma into the space surrounded by
the thylakoid membranes. The gradient free energy fuels ATP synthesis as protons
flow back into the stroma through a chloroplast ATP synthase. The link at Action in
the Z-Scheme animates the entire Z-Scheme, showing first how PSI electrons reduce
NADP+ and then how PSII electrons replace missing PSI electrons, making ATP along
the way. The oxygen released by splitting water ends up in the atmosphere.

CMB3e

141

B. Cyclic Photophosphorylation
The Z-Scheme does not in fact make enough ATP to power the Calvin Cycle. But
when the need for ATP exceeds the capacity of the tissues to make sugar, the
photosynthetic apparatus can take a time-out, resorting to Cyclic Photophosphorylation for a while. Cyclic Photophosphorylation simply takes electrons
excited to the PSI electron acceptor, and instead of sending them to NADP+, deposits
them on PC (plastocyanin) in the electron transport chain between PSII and PSI.
These electrons then flow down this ‘long line’ of the Z, right back to PSI, releasing
their free energy to make ATP. In light, the electrons just go up and around, hence the
name Cyclic Photophosphorylation. The path of electrons is shown below and
animated at Action in Cyclic Photophosphorylation.

Illustration by G. Bergtrom

C. The Light-Independent (“Dark”) Reactions
1. The Dark Reactions of C3 Photosynthesis
As we have seen, the light-dependent reactions of photosynthesis require light
energy and water and generate O2, ATP and NADPH. In the light-independent
(or ‘dark’) reactions, the ATP and NADPH will provide free energy and electrons
(respectively) for carbon fixation (the reduction of CO2 to make carbohydrates).
CO2 enters photosynthetic tissues through stomata. Stomata are pores in leaves

CMB3e

142

that can be open or closed, depending on light, temperature conditions and water
availability. In addition to allowing CO2 into photosynthetic tissues, stomata also
function in transpiration, which allows excess water in cells to leave the plants by
transpiration (sometimes called evapotranspiration). C3 photosynthesis is the
mechanism of carbon fixation in most plants, so called because its first
carbohydrate product is a 3-C molecule, 3-phosphoglyceric acid (3-PG). You
should recognize 3-PG; it is also a glycolytic intermediate. The Calvin Cycle is the
most common dark reaction pathway. For its discoverer, M. Calvin received the
Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1961. The Calvin Cycle is shown below.

Illustration by G. Bergtrom

Check the animation at Action in the Calvin Cycle.
Each carbon dioxide entering the Calvin cycle is "fixed" to a 5-carbon ribulose
bisphosphate molecule (RuBP), catalyzed by the enzyme RuBP carboxylaseoxygenase, or Rubisco for short. The expected 6-C molecule must be quickly
split into two 3-C molecules since it has not been detected as an intermediate to
date! The first detectable products are two molecules of 3-PG. Each 3-PG is in
turn reduced to glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate (G-3-P, another familiar molecule).
CMB3e

143

The cycle regenerates the RuBP and produces glucose. Perhaps the easiest way
to see this is to imagine the cycle going around 12 times, fixing 12 molecules of
carbon dioxide, as shown in the link above. Two of the G-3-P molecules are linked
together to make a single 6-C molecule of glucose (which is polymerized into
starch for storage in daylight). That leaves 10 molecules of G-3-P, for a total of 30
carbons. The latter part of the cycle will regenerate 5 molecules of new RuBP,
accounting for our 30 carbons!
2. Photorespiration
There are times that even plants in temperate environments suffer prolonged hot,
dry spells. Perhaps you have seen a lawn grow more slowly and turn brown after
a dry heat wave in summer, only to grow and re-green after the rains resume. C3
plants resort to photorespiration during drought and dry weather, closing their
stomata to conserve water. Under these conditions, CO2 can’t get into the
leaves… and O2 can’t get out! As CO2 levels drop and O2 rise in photosynthetic
cells, the Calvin Cycle slows down. Instead of fixing CO2, the enzyme Rubisco
now catalyzes “O2 fixation” using its oxygenase activity. The combination of RuBP
with O2 splits RuBP into a 3-carbon and a 2-carbon molecule: 3-phosphoglyceric
acid (3-PG) and phosphoglycolate respectively. The reaction is shown below.

Illustration by G. Bergtrom

Not only does photorespiration result in only one 3-carbon carbohydrate
(compared to two in the Calvin Cycle), but the phosphoglycolate produced is
cytotoxic (not healthy for cells!). Removing the phosphate and metabolizing the
remaining glycolic acid costs energy. Therefore, photorespiration can only be
sustained for a short time. On the other hand, plants that have adapted to live in
hot arid environments all the time have evolved one of two alternate pathways.
One is the CAM (Crassulacean Acid Metabolism); the other is the C4 pathway.
Each is an alternative to C3 carbon fixation.

CMB3e

144

3. The CAM Photosynthetic Pathway
Crassulacean acid metabolism (CAM) was discovered in the Crassulaceae.
These are succulents like sedum (a common ground cover), cactuses and jade
plants, and some orchids. The CAM pathway was selected in evolution to allow
plants to conserve water, especially during the high daytime temperatures.
Stomata in chlorenchymal (mesophyll) leaf cells close during the day to minimize
water loss by transpiration. The stomata open at night, allowing plant tissues to
take up CO2. CAM plants fix CO2 by combining it with PEP (phosphoenol
pyruvate). This eventually produces malic acid that is stored in plant cell
vacuoles. By day, stored malic acid retrieved from the vacuoles splits into pyruvate
and CO2. The CO2 then enters chloroplasts and joins the Calvin Cycle to make
glucose and the starches. The CAM pathway is shown below.

Illustration by G. Bergtrom

CMB3e

145

In sum, CAM plant mesophyll cells
 open stomata to collect, fix and store CO2 as an organic acid at night.
 close stomata to conserve water in the daytime.
 re-fix the stored CO2 as carbohydrate using the NADPH and ATP from the light
reaction the next the day.
4. The C4 Photosynthetic Pathway
C4 refers to malic acid, the 4-carbon end product of CO2 fixation. In this regard,
the C4 pathway is the same as in CAM metabolism! In both pathways, PEP
carboxylase is the catalyst of carbon fixation, converting phosphoenol pyruvate
(PEP) to oxaloacetate (OAA). The OAA is then reduced to malic acid, as shown
below.

Illustration by G. Bergtrom

CMB3e

146

C4 metabolism diverges from CAM pathway after malic acid formation. PEP
carboxylase catalysis is rapid in C4 plants, in part because malic acid does not
accumulate in the mesophyll cells. Instead, it is rapidly transferred from mesophyll
to adjacent bundle sheath cells, where it enters chloroplasts. The
result is that C4 plants can keep stomata open for CO2 capture (unlike CAM
plants), but closed at least part of the day to conserve water. The 4-carbon malic
acid is oxidized to pyruvate (three carbons) in the bundle sheath cell chloroplasts.
The CO2 released enters the Calvin cycle to be rapidly fixed by Rubisco. Of
course, this system allows more efficient water use and faster carbon fixation
under high heat, dry conditions than does C3 photosynthesis. Corn is perhaps the
best-known C4 plant!
By the way, can you recognize several more intermediates common to respiration
and the light-independent photosynthetic reactions?

V. More Thoughts on the Mechanisms and Evolution of Respiration
and Photosynthesis.
We can assume that the abundance of chemical energy on our cooling planet favored the
formation of cells that could capture free energy from these nutrients in the absence of
any oxygen. For a time, we thought that the first cells would have extracted nutrient free
energy by non-oxidative, fermentation pathways. And they would have been voracious
feeders, quickly depleting their environmental nutrient resources. In this scenario, the
evolution of autotrophic life forms saved life from an early extinction! That is because
autotrophs could create organic molecules extracting free energy from inorganic
molecules or from light.
An alternative scenario that is gaining traction, suggests that the first cells may have
started with oxidative reactions that used something other than oxygen as a final electron
acceptor. In this scenario (to be considered in more detail elsewhere), non-oxygenic
‘oxidative’ chemistries came first, followed by the evolution of anoxic fermentative
chemistries, then followed by photosynthesis, and finally respiratory pathways. In either
scenario, we can safely assume that photosynthesis existed before oxygenic respiration.
We also assume that oxygenic photoautotrophs that capture free energy from light would
become the most abundant autotrophs, if for no other reason than sunlight is always
available (at least during the day), and oxygen is abundant in the air! The early
photoautotrophs were likely the ancestors of today’s cyanobacteria. In fact, a
phylogenetic study of many genes including “plastid-encoded proteins, nucleus-encoded
proteins of plastid origin…, as well as wide-ranging genome data from

CMB3e

147

cyanobacteria” suggests a common ancestry of freshwater cyanobacteria and eukaryotic
chloroplasts (Ponce-Toledo, R.I. et al., 2017, An Early-Branching Freshwater
Cyanobacterium at the Origin of Plastids. Current Biology 27:386-391).
But what about the origins of respiratory metabolism and the endosymbiotic origins of
mitochondria? Let’s start by asking how respiration co-opted photosynthetic electron
transport reactions that captured the electrons from H2O needed to reduce CO2, turning
those reactions to the task of burning sugars back to H2O and CO2. As photosynthetic
organisms emerged and atmospheric oxygen increased, elevated oxygen levels would
have been toxic to most living things. Still, some autotrophic cells must have had a preexisting genetic potential to conduct detoxifying respiratory chemistry. These would have
been facultative aerobes with the ability to switch from photosynthesis to respiration when
oxygen levels rose. Today’s purple non-sulfur bacteria such as Rhodobacter sphaeroides
are just such facultative aerobes! Perhaps we aerobes descend from the ancestors of
such cells that survived and spread from localized environments where small amounts of
oxygen threatened their otherwise strictly anaerobic neighbors. Is it possible that the
endosymbiotic critter that became the first mitochondrion in a eukaryotic cell was not just
any aerobic bacterium, but a purple photosynthetic bacterium?

Chapter 8: DNA, Chromosomes and Chromatin
The “Stuff of Genes”; The Double Helix; Chromosomes and Chromatin
I.

Introduction

Here we look at classic experiments that led to our understanding that genes are
composed of DNA. We already knew that genes were on chromosomes (chromo –
colored; soma-body). Early 20th century gene mapping even showed the relative
location (locus) of genes on chromosomes. Compared to eukaryotes, bacteria contain a
very small amount of DNA per cell. Subsequent bacterial gene mapping and electron
microscopy revealed that the E. coli “chromosome is little more than a small closed,
circular DNA double helix. In contrast, linear eukaryotic chromosomes are highly
condensed structures composed of DNA and protein, visible only during mitosis or
meiosis. During the much longer interphase portion of the eukaryotic cell cycle,
chromosomes de-condense to chromatin, a less organized form of protein-associated
DNA in the nucleus. Chromatin is the gatekeeper of gene activity in eukaryotic cells, a
situation quite different from bacterial cells. Since we know that all cells of an organism
contain the same DNA, and all cells must alter patterns of gene expression over time,
understanding the structure and organization of DNA in cells is essential to an
understanding of how and when cells turn genes on and off.

II.

The Stuff of Genes

That all eukaryotic cells contain a nucleus was understood by the late 19th century. By
then, histological studies had shown that nuclei contained largely proteins and DNA. At
around the same time, the notion that the nucleus contains genetic information was
gaining traction. In 1910, Albrecht Kossel received the 1910 Nobel Prize in Physiology or
Medicine for his discovery of the adenine, thymine, cytosine and guanine (the four DNA
bases), as well as of uracil in RNA. Mendel’s Laws of Inheritance, presented in 1865,
were not widely understood, probably because they relied on a strong dose of arithmetic
and statistics, when the utility of quantitative biology was not much appreciated. But,
following the re-discovery three decades later, the number of known inherited traits in any
given organism increased rapidly. At that time, DNA was known as a small, simple
molecule, made up of only the four nucleotides (see DNA Structure below for additional
historical perspective). So, the question was how could such a small, simple account for
the inheritance of so many different physical traits? The recognition that enzyme
activities were inherited in the same way as morphological characteristics led to the onegene-one enzyme hypothesis that earned G. W. Beadle, E. L. Tatum and J. Lederberg
the 1958 Nobel Prize for Physiology and Medicine. When enzymes were later shown to
be proteins, the hypothesis became one-gene-one protein. When proteins were shown to
be composed of one or more polypeptides, the final hypothesis became one-gene-onepolypeptide. However, this relationship between genes and proteins failed to shed any
light on how DNA might be the genetic material. In fact, quite the contrary! As chains of
up to 20 different amino acids, polypeptides and proteins had the potential for enough
structural diversity to account for the growing number of heritable traits in a given
organism. Thus, proteins seemed more likely candidates for the molecules of inheritance.
The experiments you will read about here began around the start of World War I and
lasted until just after World War 2. During this time, we learned that DNA was no mere
tetramer, but was in fact a long polymer. This led to some very clever experiments that
eventually forced the scientific community to the conclusion that DNA, not protein, was
the genetic molecule, despite being composed of just four monomeric units. Finally, we
look at the classic work of Watson, Crick, Franklin and Wilkins that revealed the structure
of the genetic molecule.
A. Griffith’s Experiment
Fred Neufeld, a German bacteriologist studying pneumococcal bacteria in the early
1900s discovered three immunologically different strains of Streptococcus pneumonia
(Types I, II and III). The virulent strain (Type III) was responsible for much of the
mortality during the Spanish Flu (influenza) pandemic of 1918-1920. This pandemic

CMB3e

151

killed between 20 and 100 million people, many because the influenza viral infection
weakened the immune system of infected individuals, making them susceptible to
bacterial infection by Streptococcus pneumonia.
In the 1920s, Frederick Griffith was working with virulent wild type (Type III) and
benign (Type II) strains of S. pneumonia. The two strains were easy to tell apart petri
dishes because the virulent strain grew in morphologically smooth colonies, while the
benign strain formed rough colonies. For this reason, the two bacterial strains were
called S and R, respectively. We now know that S cells are coated with a
polysaccharide (mucus) capsule, making colonies appear smooth. In contrast, R cell
colonies look rough (don’t glisten) because they lack the polysaccharide coating.
Griffith knew that injecting mice with S cells killed them within about a day! Injecting
the non-lethal R cells on the other hand, caused no harm. Then, he surmised that,
perhaps, the exposure of mice to the R strain of S. pneumonia first would immunize
them against lethal infection by S cells. His experimental protocol and results,
published in 1928, are summarized below.

Illustration by G. Bergtrom

CMB3e

152

To test his hypothesis, Griffith injected mice with R cells. Sometime later, he injected
them with S cells. However, the attempt to immunize the mice against S. pneumonia
was unsuccessful! The control mice injected with S strain cells and the experimental
mice that received the R strain cells first and then S cells, all died in short order! As
expected, mice injected with R cells only survived.
Griffith also checked the blood of his mice for the presence of bacterial cells:
 Mice injected with benign R (rough) strain cells survived and after plating blood
from the mice on nutrient medium, no bacterial cells grew.
 Many colonies of S cells grew from the blood of dead mice injected with S cells.
Griffith performed two other experiments, shown in the illustration:
1. He injected mice with heat-killed S cells; as expected, these mice survived. Blood
from these mice contained no bacterial cells. This was “expected” since heating
the S cells should have the same effect as pasteurization has on bacteria in milk!
2. Griffith also injected mice with a mixture of live R cells and heat-killed S cells, in
the hope that the combination might induce immunity in the mouse where injecting
the R cells alone had failed. You can imagine his surprise when, far from
becoming immunized, the injected mice died and abundant S cells had
accumulated in their blood.
Griffith realized that something important had happened in his experiments. In the
mixture of live R cells and heat-killed S cells, something released from the dead S
cells had transformed some R cells. Griffith named this “something” the transforming
principle, a molecule present in the debris of dead S cells and sometimes acquired by
a few live R cells, turning them into virulent S cells. We now know that R cells lack
polysaccharide coat, and that the host cell’s immune system can attack and clear R
cells before a serious infection can take hold.
B. The Avery-MacLeod-McCarty Experiment
Griffith didn’t know the chemical identity of the transforming principle. However, his
experiments led to studies that proved DNA was the “stuff of genes”. With improved
molecular purification techniques developed in the 1930s, O. Avery, C. MacLeod, and
M. McCarty transformed R cells in vitro (that is, without the help of a mouse!). They
purified heat-killed S-cell components (DNA, proteins, carbohydrates, lipids…) and
separately tested the transforming ability of each molecular component on R cells in a
test tube.

The experiments of Avery et al. are summarized below.

Since only the DNA fraction of the dead S cells could cause transformation, Avery et
al. concluded that DNA must be the Transforming Principle. In spite of these
results, DNA was not readily accepted as the stuff of genes. The sticking point was
that DNA was composed of only four nucleotides. Even though scientists knew that
DNA was a large polymer, they still thought of DNA as that simple molecule, for
example a polymer made up of repeating sequences of the four nucleotides:
…AGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCT…
Only the seemingly endless combinations of 20 amino acids in proteins promised the
biological specificity necessary to account for an organism’s many genetic traits.
Lacking structural diversity, DNA was explained as a mere scaffold for protein genes.
To adapt Marshal McLuhan’s famous statement that the medium is the message (i.e.,
airwaves do not merely convey, but are the message), many still believed that proteins
are the medium of genetic information as well as the functional message itself.

The reluctance of influential scientists of the day to accept a DNA transforming
principle deprived its discoverers of the Nobel Prize stature it deserved. After new
evidence made further resistance to that acceptance untenable, even the Nobel
Committee admitted that failure to award a Nobel Prize for the discoveries of Avery et
al. was an error. The key experiments of Alfred Hershey and Martha Chase finally put
to rest any notion that proteins were genes
167 Transformation In & Out of Mice; Griffith, McCarthy et al.
C. The Hershey-Chase Experiment
Biochemically, bacterial viruses were known consist of DNA enclosed in a protein
capsule. The life cycle of bacterial viruses (bacteriophage, or phage for short) begins
with infection of a bacterium, as illustrated below.

Illustration by G. Bergtrom

Phages are inert particles until they bind to and infect bacterial cells. Phage particles
added to a bacterial culture could be seen attach to bacterial surfaces in an electron
microscope. Investigators found that they could detach phage particles from bacteria
by agitation in a blender (similar to one you might have in your kitchen). Centrifugation
then separated the bacterial cells in a pellet at the bottom of the centrifuge tube,

CMB3e

155

leaving the detached phage particles in the supernatant. By adding phage to bacteria
and then detaching the phage from the bacteria at different times, it was possible to
determine how long it the phage had to remain attached before the bacteria become
infected. It turned out that pelleted cells that had been attached to phage for short
times would survive and reproduce when re-suspended in growth medium. But
pelleted cells left attached to phage for longer times had become infected;
centrifugally separated from the detached phage and resuspended in fresh medium,
these cells would go on and lyse, producing new phage. Therefore, the transfer of
genetic information for virulence from virus to phage took some time. The viral genetic
material responsible for infection and virulence was apparently no longer associated
with the phage capsule, which could be recovered from the centrifugal supernatant.
Alfred Hershey and Martha Chase designed an experiment to determine whether the
DNA enclosed by the viral protein capsule or the capsule protein itself caused phage
to infect the bacterium. In the experiment, they separately grew E. coli cells infected
with T2 bacteriophage in the presence of either 32P or 35S (radioactive isotopes of
phosphorous and sulfur, respectively). The result was to produce phage that
contained either radioactive DNA or radioactive proteins, but not both (recall that only
DNA contains phosphorous and only proteins contain sulfur). They then separately
infected fresh E. coli cells with either 32P- or 35S-labeled, radioactive phage. Their
experiment is described below.

Illustration by G. Bergtrom

CMB3e

156

Phage and cells were incubated with either 32P or 35S just long enough to allow
infection. Some of each culture was allowed to go on and lyse to prove that the cells
were infected. The remainder of each mixture was sent to the blender. After
centrifugation of each blend, the pellets and supernatants were examined to see
where the radioactive proteins or DNA had gone. From the results, the 32P always
ended up in the pellet of bacterial cells while the 35S was found in the phage remnant
in the supernatant. Hershey and Chase concluded that the genetic material of
bacterial viruses was DNA and not protein, just as Avery et al. had suggested that
DNA was the bacterial transforming principle.
Given the earlier resistance to “simple” DNA being the genetic material, Hershey and
Chase used cautious language in framing their conclusions. They need not have; all
subsequent experiments confirmed that DNA was the genetic material. Concurrent
with these confirmations were experiments demonstrating that DNA might not be
(indeed, was not) such a simple, uncomplicated molecule! For their final contributions
to pinning down DNA as the “stuff of genes”, Alfred D. Hershey shared the 1969 Nobel
Prize in Physiology or Medicine with Max Delbruck and Salvador E. Luria.
168 Hershey and Chase: Viral Genes are in Viral DNA

III. DNA Structure
A. Early Clues and Ongoing Misconceptions
By 1878, a substance in the pus of wounded soldiers derived from cell nuclei (called
nuclein) was shown to be composed of 5 bases (the familiar ones of DNA and RNA).
The four bases known to make up DNA (as part of nucleotides) were thought to be
connected through the phosphate groups in short repeating chains of four nucleotides.
By the 1940s, we knew that DNA was a long polymer. Nevertheless, it was still
considered too simple to account for genes (see above). After the Hershey and
Chase experiments, only a few holdouts would not accept DNA as the genetic
material. So, the question remaining was how such a “simple” molecule could account
for all the genes, even in so simple an organism as a bacterium. The answer to this
question was to lie at least in part in an understanding of the physical structure of
DNA, made possible by the advent of X-Ray Crystallography.
If a substance can be crystallized, the crystal will diffract X-rays at angles revealing
regular (repeating) structures of the crystal. William Astbury demonstrated that high
molecular weight DNA had just such a regular structure. His crystallographs

CMB3e

157

suggested DNA to be a linear polymer of stacked bases (nucleotides), each nucleotide
separated from the next by 0.34 nm. Astbury is also remembered for coining the term
“molecular biology” to describe his studies. The term now covers as all aspects of
biomolecular structure, as well as molecular functions (e.g. replication, transcription,
translation, gene regulation…).
In an irony of history, the Russian biologist Nikolai Koltsov had already intuited in 1927
that the basis of genetic transfer of traits would be a "giant hereditary molecule" made
up of "two mirror strands that would replicate in a semi-conservative fashion using
each strand as a template". A pretty fantastic inference if you think about it since it
was proposed long before Watson and Crick and their colleagues worked out the
structure of the DNA double-helix!
B. Wilkins, Franklin, Watson & Crick
Maurice Wilkins, an English biochemist, was the first to isolate highly pure, high
molecular weight DNA. Working in Wilkins laboratory, Rosalind Franklin was able to
crystalize this DNA and produce very high-resolution X-Ray diffraction images of the
DNA crystals. Franklin’s most famous (and definitive) crystallography was “Photo 51”,
shown below.

Fair Use (Ref.Wikipedia); By Source (WP:NFCC#4), Fair use,
https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?curid=38068629 or https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photo_51

This image confirmed Astbury’s 0.34 nm repeat dimension and revealed two more
numbers, 3.4 nm and 2 nm, reflecting additional repeat structures in the DNA crystal.
When James Watson and Francis Crick got hold of these numbers, they used them
along with other data to build DNA models out of nuts, bolts and plumbing. Their
models eventually revealed DNA to be a pair of antiparallel complementary of
nucleic acid polymers…, shades of Koltsov’s mirror-image macromolecules! Each
strand is a string of nucleotides linked by phosphodiester bonds, the two strands held
together in a double helix by complementary H-bond interactions.
CMB3e

158

Let’s look at the evidence for these conclusions and as we do, refer to the two
illustrations of the double helix below.

Recalling that Astbury’s 0.34 nm dimension was the distance between successive
nucleotides in a DNA strand, Watson and Crick surmised that the 3.4 nm repeat was
a structurally meaningful 10-fold multiple of Astbury’s number. When they began
building their DNA models, they realized from the bond angles connecting the
nucleotides that the strand was forming a helix, from which they concluded that the 3.4
nm repeat was the pitch of the helix, i.e., the distance of one complete turn of the
helix. This meant that there were 10 bases per turn of the helix. They further
reasoned that the 2.0 nm number might reflect the diameter of helix. When their scale
model of a single stranded DNA helix predicted a helical diameter much less than 2.0
nm, they were able to model a double helix that more nearly met the 2.0 nm diameter
requirement. In building their double helix, Watson and Crick realized that bases in
opposing strands would come together to form H-bonds, holding the helix together.
However, for their double helix to have a constant diameter of 2.0 nm, they also
realized that the smaller pyrimidine bases, Thymine (T) and Cytosine (C), would
have to H-bond to the larger purine bases, Adenine (A) and Guanosine (G).

CMB3e

159

Now to the question of how a “simple” DNA molecule could have the structural
diversity needed to encode thousands of different polypeptides and proteins. In early
studies, purified E. coli DNA was chemically hydrolyzed down to nucleotide
monomers. The hydrolysis products contained nearly equal amounts of each base,
reinforcing the notion that DNA was that simple molecule that could not encode
genes. But Watson and Crick had private access to revealing data from Erwin
Chargaff. Chargaff had determined the base composition of DNA isolated from
different species, including E. coli. He found that the base composition of DNA from
different species was not always equimolar, meaning that for some species, the DNA
was not composed of equal amounts of each of the four bases (see some of this data
below).

The mere fact that DNA from some species could have base compositions that
deviated from equimolarity put to rest the argument that DNA had to be a very simple
sequence. Finally, it was safe to accept that to accept the obvious, namely that DNA
was indeed the “stuff of genes”.
Chargaff’s data also showed a unique pattern of base ratios. Although base
compositions could vary between species, the A/T and G/C ratio was always one, for
every species. Likewise the ratio of (A+C)/(G+T) and (A+G)/(C+T). From this
information, Watson and Crick inferred that A (a purine) would H-bond with T (a
pyrimidine), and G (a purine) would H-bond with C (a pyrimidine) in the double helix.
When building their model with this new information, they also found H-bonding
between the complementary bases would be maximal only if the two DNA strands
were antiparallel, leading to the most stable structure of the double helix.

CMB3e

160

Watson and Crick published their conclusions about the structure of DNA in 1953
(Click here to read their seminal article: Molecular Structure of Nucleic Acids: A
Structure for Deoxyribose Nucleic Acid. Their article is also famous for predicting a
semi-conservative mechanism of replication, something that had been predicted by
Koltsov 26 years earlier, albeit based on intuition… and much less evidence!
Watson, Crick and Wilkins shared a Nobel Prize in 1962 for their work on DNA
structure. Unfortunately, Franklin died in 1958 and Nobel prizes were not awarded
posthumously. There is still controversy about why Franklin did not get appropriate
credit for her role in the work. But she has been getting well-deserved, long-delayed
recognition, including a university in Chicago named in her honor!
169 Unraveling the Structure of DNA
Confirmation of Watson & Crick’s suggestion of semiconservative replication came
from Meselson and Stahl’s very elegant experiment, which tested the three possible
models of replication shown below.

Illustration by G. Bergtrom

In their experiment, E. coli cells were grown for in medium containing 15N, a ‘heavy’
nitrogen isotope. After many generations, all of the DNA in the cells had become
labeled with the heavy isotope. At that point, the 15N-tagged cells were placed back
in medium containing the more common, ‘light’ 14N isotope and allowed to grow for
exactly one generation.

CMB3e

161

Meselson and Stahl’s predictions and their experimental design are shown below.

Illustration by G. Bergtrom

Meselson and Stahl knew that 14N-labeled and 15N-labeled DNA would form separate
bands after centrifugation on CsCl chloride density gradients. They tested their
predictions by purifying and centrifuging the DNA from the 15N-labeled cells grown in 14N
medium for one generation. They found that this DNA formed a single band with a
density between that of 15N-labeled DNA and 14N-labeled DNA. This result eliminated a
conservative model of DNA replication (as Watson and Crick also predicted. That left two
possibilities: replication was either semiconservative or dispersive. The dispersive model
was eliminated when DNA isolated from cells grown for a 2nd generation on 14N were
shown to contain two bands of DNA on the CsCl density gradients.

Chromosomes
We understood from the start of the 20th century that chromosomes contained genes.
Therefore, it becomes necessary to understand the relationship between chromosomes,
chromatin, DNA and genes. As noted earlier, chromosomes are a specialized,
condensed version of chromatin, with key structural features shown below.

telomeres

We now know that the compact structure of a chromosome prevents damage to the DNA
during cell division. This damage can occur when forces on centromeres generated by
mitotic or meiotic spindle fibers pull chromatids apart. As the nucleus breaks down during
mitosis or meiosis, late 19th century microscopists saw chromosomes condense from the
dispersed cytoplasmic background. These chromosomes remained visible as they
separated, moving to opposite poles of the cell during cell division. Such observations of
chromosome behavior during cell division pointed to their role in heredity. A computercolorized cell in mitosis is shown below.

It is possible to distinguish one chromosome from another by karyotyping. When cells in
metaphase of mitosis are placed under pressure, they burst and the chromosomes
spread apart. Such a chromosome spread is shown below.

By the early 1900s, the number, sizes and shapes of chromosomes were shown to be
species-specific. What’s more, a close look at chromosome spreads revealed that
chromosomes came in morphologically matched pairs. This was so reminiscent of
Gregor Mendel’s paired hereditary factors that chromosomes were then widely accepted
as the structural seat of genetic inheritance. Cutting apart micrographs like the one
above and pairing the chromosomes by their morphology generates a karyotype. Paired
human homologs are easily identified in the colorized micrograph below.

IV. Genes and Chromatin in Eukaryotes
Chromosomes and chromatin are a uniquely eukaryotic association of DNA with more or
less protein. Bacterial DNA (and prokaryotic DNA generally) is relatively ‘naked’ – not
visibly associated with protein.
The electron micrograph of an interphase cell (below) reveals that the chromatin can itself
exist in various states of condensation.

Research by
G. Bergtrom

Chromatin is maximally condensed during mitosis, forming chromosomes. During
interphase, chromatin exists in more or less condensed forms, called Heterochromatin
and euchromatin respectively. Transition between these chromatin forms involve
changes in the amounts and types of proteins bound to the chromatin, and can that can
occur during gene regulation, i.e., when genes are turned on or off. Active genes tend to
be in the more dispersed euchromatin so that enzymes of replication and transcription
have easier access to the DNA. Genes that are inactive in transcription are
heterochromatic, obscured by additional chromatin proteins present in heterochromatin.
We’ll be looking at some experiments that demonstrate this in a later chapter.

CMB3e

165

We can define three levels of chromatin organization in general terms:
1. DNA wrapped around histone proteins form nucleosomes in a "beads on a string"
structure.
2. Multiple nucleosomes coil (condense), forming 30 nm fiber (solenoid) structures.
3. Higher-order packing of the 30 nm fiber leads to formation of metaphase
chromosomes seen in mitosis & meiosis.
The levels of chromatin structure were determined in part by selective isolation and
extraction of interphase cell chromatin, followed by selective chemical extraction of
chromatin components. The steps are:




Nuclei are first isolated from the cells.
The nuclear envelope gently ruptured so as not to physically disrupt chromatin
structure.
the chromatin can be gently extracted by one of several different chemical treatments
(high salt, low salt, acid...).

The levels of chromatin structure are illustrated below.

Salt extraction dissociates most of the proteins from the chromatin. When a low salt
extract is centrifuged and the pellet resuspended, the remaining chromatin looks like
beads on a string. DNA-wrapped nucleosomes are the beads, which are in turn linked by
uniform lengths of metaphorical DNA “string’ ( # 1 in the illustration above). A high salt
chromatin extract appears as a coil of nucleosomes, or 30 nm solenoid fiber (# 2 above).
Other extraction protocols revealed other aspects of chromatin structure shown in #s 3
and 4 above. Chromosomes seen in metaphase of mitosis are the ‘highest order’, most
condensed form of chromatin.
The 10 nm filament of nucleosome ‘beads-on-a-string’ remaining after a low salt
extraction can be seen in an electron microscope as shown below.

When these nucleosome necklaces were digested with the enzyme deoxyribonuclease
(DNAse), the DNA between the ‘beads’ was degraded, leaving behind shortened 10nm
filaments after a short digest period, or just single beads the beads after a longer
digestion (below).
Illustration by G. Bergtrom

Roger Kornberg (son of Nobel Laureate Arthur Kornberg who discovered the first DNA
polymerase enzyme of replication) participated in the discovery and characterization of
nucleosomes while he was still a post-doc! Electrophoresis of DNA extracted from these
digests revealed nucleosomes separated by a “linker” DNA stretch of about 80 base
pairs. DNA extracted from the nucleosomes was about 147 base pairs long. This is the
DNA that had been wrapped around the proteins of the nucleosome.
172 Nucleosomes-DNA & Protein

After separating all of the proteins from nucleosomal DNA, five proteins were identified
(illustrated below).

Illustration by G. Bergtrom

Histones are basic proteins containing many lysine and arginine amino acids. Their
positively charged side chains enable these amino acids bind the acidic, negatively
charged phosphodiester backbone of double helical DNA. The DNA wraps around an
octamer of histones (2 each of 4 of the histone proteins) to form the nucleosome. About a
gram of histones is associated with each gram of DNA. After a high salt chromatin
extraction, the structure visible in the electron microscope is the 30nm solenoid, the coil of
nucleosomes modeled in the figure below.

As shown above, simply increasing the salt concentration of an already extracted
nucleosome preparation will cause the ‘necklace’ to fold into the 30nm solenoid structure.
173 Chromatin Structure: Dissecting Chromatin
As you might guess, an acidic extraction of chromatin should selectively remove the basic
histone proteins, leaving behind an association of DNA with non-histone proteins. This
proved to be the case. An electron micrograph of the chromatin remnant after an acid
extraction of metaphase chromosomes is shown on the next page.
DNA freed of the regularly spaced histone-based nucleosomes, loops out, away from the
long axis of the chromatin. Dark material along this axis is a protein scaffolding that
makes up what’s left after histone extraction. Much of this protein is topoisomerase, an
enzyme that prevents DNA from breaking apart under the strain of replication.

V. Structure and Organization of DNA in Bacteria
Sexual reproduction allows compatible genders (think male and female) to share genes, a
strategy that increases species diversity. It turns out that bacteria and other single celled
organisms can also share genes… and spread diversity. We will close this chapter with a
look at sex (E. coli style!), and gene-mapping experiments showing linearly arranged
genes on a circular bacterial DNA molecule (the bacterial ‘chromosome’).
E. coli sex begins when F+ and F- cells meet. These cells are “opposite” mating types
that can share DNA during conjugation. F+ cells contain the F plasmid, a small circular
DNA molecule that is separate from the E. coli chromosome. The F (fertility) plasmid has
genes that encode sex pili on F+, as well as factors needed to form a mating bridge, or
conjugation tube. The behavior of the F plasmid during conjugation is shown below.
Illustration by G. Bergtrom

When an F+ (donor) cell encounters an F- (recipient) cell, sex pili on the donor cell initiate
recognition. Next, a conjugation tube forms, linking the cytoplasms of the two cells. After
nicking one strand of the F plasmid DNA, the nicked begins to roll into the conjugation
tube and into the recipient (F-) cell. The DNA strand entering the recipient cell replicates,
as does the intact circle remaining in the donor cell (replicating DNA is shown in red in the
illustration).

CMB3e

171

E. coli conjugation can have different outcomes:
1. One outcome is that one of two semi-conservatively replicated F plasmids remains in
the donor cell and another is now in the recipient cell. In this case, the recipient cell
becomes a new F+ donor cell!
2. The other outcome is integration of the F plasmid into recipient cell chromosomal
DNA. Insertion is typically at specific sites in the DNA where there is sufficient
sequence similarity between the plasmid and chromosomal DNA to allow insertion by
recombination. The result is that the recipient cell becomes an Hfr (High-frequency
recombination) cell. This cell will produce Hfr strain progeny cells.
These two possible results of conjugation in E. coli are illustrated below.

Illustration by G. Bergtrom

Hfr cells readily express their integrated F plasmid genes, and like F+ cells, develop sex
pili and form a conjugation tube with an F- cell. One strand of the bacterial chromosomal
DNA will be nicked at the original insertion site of the F plasmid.

CMB3e

172

The next events parallel the replicative transfer of an F plasmid during F+/F- conjugation,
except that only part of the Hfr donor chromosomal DNA is transferred, as shown below.

Illustration by
G. Bergtrom

In this illustration, the F plasmid has inserted ‘in front of’ an A gene so that when it enters
the conjugation tube, it brings along several E. coli chromosomal genes Because of the
size of the bacterial chromosome, only a few bacterial genes enter the recipient gene
before transfer is aborted. But in the brief time of DNA transfer, at least some genes did
get in to the recipient F- strain where they can be expressed. Here is an outline of an
experiment that allowed mapping bacterial genes on a circular DNA chromosome:
1. Hfr cells containing functional A, B, C, D genes were mated with recipient cells
containing mutants of either the A, the B, the C or the D gene.
2. Conjugation was mechanically disrupted at different times after the formation of a
conjugation tube.
3. Recipient cells from each of the disrupted conjugations were then grown in culture and
analyzed for specific gene function.
In this hypothetical example, the results were that a recipient cell with a mutant A gene
acquired a wild type A gene (and therefore A-gene function) after a short time before
conjugation disruption. Progressively longer times of conjugation (measured in separate
experiments) were required to transfer gens B, C and D (respectively) to the recipient cell.
Thus the order of these genes on the bacterial chromosome was

-A-B-C-DThe timing of conjugation that led to F- mutants acquiring a functional gene from the Hfr
strain was so refined that not only could the gene locus be determined, but even the size )
length) of the genes! Thus, the time to transfer a complete gene to an F- cell reflects the
size (length) of the gene. The other important conclusion is that genes are arranged
linearly on bacterial DNA.

CMB3e

173

Recall that genes already mapped along the length of eukaryotic chromosomes implied a
linear order of the genes. However, little was known about eukaryotic chromosome
structure at the time, and the role of DNA as the ‘stuff of genes’ was not appreciated.
These bacterial mating experiments demonstrated for the first time that genes are linearly
arranged not just along a chromosome, but also along the DNA molecule.
Over time, many bacterial genes were mapped all along the E. coli chromosome by
isolating many different Hfr strains in which an F plasmid had inserted into different sites
around the DNA circle. These Hfr strains were mated to F- bacteria, each with mutations
in one or another known bacterial gene. As in the original ‘ABCD’ experiment, the order
of many genes was determined, and even shown to be linked at a greater or lesser
distance to those ABCD genes and each other.
The map that results from such a study is diagrammed below.

Illustration by G. Bergtrom

CMB3e

174

Using the different Hfr strains (numbered in the diagram) in conjugation experiments, it
was shown that in fact, the different Hfr cells transferred different genes into the recipient
cells in the order implied by the diagram. What’s more, when the experiment was done
with Hfr4 (in this generic diagram); the order of genes transferred after longer times of
conjugation was found to be:

V-W-X-Y-Z-A-B….
The obvious conclusion from experiments like these was that the E. coli DNA molecule
(its ‘chromosome’) was a closed circle! We will see visual evidence of circular E. coli
chromosomes in the next chapter, with some discussion of how this evidence informed
our understanding of DNA replication.

Repair

Many Enzymes of Replication; Okazaki Fragments; Mechanisms,
Actions and Enzymes of DNA Repair; When DNA Repair Fails
I.

Introduction

Replication begins at one or more origins of replication along DNA, where helicase
enzymes catalyze unwinding of the double helix. DNA unwinding creates replicating
bubbles, or replicons, with replication forks at either end. Making a new DNA strand
starts with making an RNA primer with RNA nucleotides and primase enzymes. DNA
nucleotides are then added to the 3’-ends of primers by one a DNA polymerase. Later,
other DNA polymerases catalyze removal of the RNA primers and replacement of the
hydrolyzed ribonucleotides with new deoxyribonucleotides. Finally, DNA ligases stitch
together the fragments of new DNA synthesized at the replication forks. This complex
mechanism is common to the replication of ‘naked’ prokaryotic DNA and of chromatinencased eukaryotic DNA, and must therefore have arisen early in the evolution of
replication biochemistry. In this chapter, we look at the details of replication and the
differences in detail between prokaryotic and eukaryotic replication that arise because of
differences in DNA packing. As with any complex process with many moving parts,
replication is error-prone. Therefore, we will also look at how the overall fidelity of
replication relies mechanisms of DNA repair that target specific kinds of replication
mistakes, or mutations. At the same time, lest we think that uncorrected errors in
replication are always a bad thing, they usually do not have bad outcomes. Instead, they
leave behind the very mutations that allow natural selection and the evolution of diversity.

DNA Replication

As we’ve seen, DNA strands have directionality, with a 5’ nucleotide-phosphate and a 3’
deoxyribose hydroxyl end. This is even true for circular bacterial chromosomes…, if the
circle is broken! Because the strands of the double helix are antiparallel, the 5’ end of
one strand aligns with the 3’end of the other at both ends of the double helix. The
complementary pairing of bases in DNA means that the base sequence of one strand can
be used as a template to make a new complementary strand. As we’ll see, this structure
of DNA created some interesting dilemmas for understanding the biochemistry of
replication. The puzzlement surrounding how replication proceeds begins with
experiments that visualize replicating DNA.
A. Visualizing Replication and Replication Forks
Recall the phenomenon of bacterial conjugation allowed a demonstration bacterial
chromosomes were circular. In 1963, John Cairns confirmed this fact by direct
visualization of bacterial DNA. He cultured E. coli cells for long periods on 3Hthymidine (3H-T) to make all of their cellular DNA radioactive. He then disrupted the
cells gently to minimize damage to the DNA. The DNA released was allowed to settle
and adhere to membranes. A sensitive film was placed over the membrane and time
was allowed for the radiation to expose the film. After Cairns developed the
autoradiographs, he examined the results in the electron microscope. He saw tracks
of silver grains in the autoradiographs (the same kind of silver grains that create an
image on film in old-fashioned photography). Look at the two drawings of his
autoradiographs on the next page.
Cairns measured the length of the “silver” tracks, which usually consisted of three
possible closed loops, or circles. The circumferences of two of these circles were
always equal, their length closely predicted by the DNA content of a single, nondividing cell. Cairns therefore interpreted these images to be bacterial DNA in the
process of replication.
CMB3e

177

Cairns’ autoradiographs and the measurements that led him to conclude that he was
looking at images of bacterial circular chromosomes are illustrated below.

Bergtrom

He arranged his autoradiograph images in a sequence (below) to make his point.

CMB3e

178

Because the replicating chromosomes looked (vaguely!) like the Greek letter , Cairns
called them theta images. He inferred that replication starts at a single origin of
replication on the bacterial chromosome, proceeding around the circle to completion.
175 Seeing E. coli Chromosomes
Subsequent experiments by David Prescott demonstrated bidirectional
replication…, that replication did indeed begin at an origin of replication, after which
the double helix was unwound and replicated in both directions, away from the origins,
forming two replication forks (illustrated below).

Illustration by G. Bergtrom

176 Semiconservative Bidirectional Replication From Two RFs
Bacterial cells can divide every hour (or even less); the rate of bacterial DNA synthesis
is about 2 X 106 base pairs per hour. A typical eukaryotic cell nucleus contains
thousands of times as much DNA as a bacterium, and typical eukaryotic cells double
every 15-20 hours. Even a small chromosome can contain hundreds or thousands of
times as much DNA as a bacterium. It appeared that eukaryotic cells could not afford
to double their DNA at a bacterial rate of replication! Eukaryotes solved this problem
not by evolving a faster biochemistry of replication, but by using multiple origins of
replication from which DNA synthesis proceeds in both directions. This results in the
creation of multiple replicons.

CMB3e

179

Each replicon enlarges, eventually meeting other growing replicons on either side to
replicate most of each linear chromosome, suggested in the illustration below.

Illustration by G. Bergtrom

Before we consider the biochemical events at replication forks in detail, let’s look at
the role of DNA polymerase enzymes in the process.
177 Multiple Replicons in Eukaryotes
B. DNA Polymerases Catalyze Replication
The first of these enzymes was discovered in E. coli by Arthur Kornberg, for which he
received the 1959 Nobel Prize in Chemistry. Thomas Kornberg, one of Arthur’s sons
later found two more of DNA polymerases! All DNA polymerases require a template
strand against which to synthesize a new complementary strand. They all grow new
DNA by adding to the 3’ end of the growing DNA chain in successive condensation
reactions. And finally, all DNA polymerases also have the odd property that they can
only add to a pre-existing strand of nucleic acid, raising the question of where the ‘preexisting’ strand comes from! DNA polymerases catalyze the formation of a
phosphodiester linkage between the end of a growing strand and the incoming

CMB3e

180

nucleotide complementary to the template strand. The energy for the formation of the
phosphodiester linkage comes in part from the hydrolysis of two phosphates
(pyrophosphate) from the incoming nucleotide during the reaction. While replication
requires the participation of many nuclear proteins in both prokaryotes and
eukaryotes, DNA polymerases perform the basic steps of replication, as shown in the
illustration below.

178 DNA Polymerases & Their Activities
Although DNA polymerases replicate DNA with high fidelity with as few as one error
per 107 nucleotides, mistakes do occur. The proofreading ability of some DNA
polymerases corrects many of these mistakes. The polymerase can sense a
mismatched base pair, slow down and then catalyze repeated hydrolyses of
nucleotides until it reaches the mismatched base pair.

CMB3e

181

This basic proofreading by DNA polymerase is shown below.

CC BY-SA 3.0; Adapted from: I. Madprime, https://commons.Wikimedia.org/w/index.php?curid=2527732

After mismatch repair, DNA polymerase resumes forward movement. Of course, not
all mistakes are caught by this or other repair mechanisms (see DNA Repair, below).
Mutations in the eukaryotic germ line cells that elude correction can cause genetic
diseases. However, most are the mutations that fuel evolution.
Without mutations in germ line cells (egg and sperm), there would be no mutations
and no evolution, and without evolution, life itself would have reached a quick dead
end! Other replication mistakes can generate mutations somatic cells. If these
somatic mutations escape correction, they can have serious consequences, including
the generation of tumors and cancers.
CMB3e

182

C. The Process of Replication
DNA replication is a sequence of repeated condensation (dehydration synthesis)
reactions linking nucleotide monomers into a DNA polymer. Like all biological
polymerizations, replication proceeds in three enzymatically catalyzed and
coordinated steps: initiation, elongation and termination.
1. Initiation
As we have seen, DNA synthesis starts at one or more origins or replication.
These are DNA sequences targeted by initiator proteins in E. coli (below).

Illustration by G. Bergtrom

After breaking hydrogen bonds at the origin of replication, the DNA double helix is
progressively unzipped in both directions (i.e., by bidirectional replication). The
separated DNA strands serve as templates for new DNA synthesis. Sequences at
replication origins that bind to initiation proteins tend to be rich in adenine and
thymine bases. This is because A-T base pairs have two hydrogen (H-) bonds that
require less energy to break than the three H-bonds holding G-C pairs together.
Once initiation proteins loosen H-bonds at a replication origin, DNA helicase uses
the energy of ATP hydrolysis to unwind the double helix. DNA polymerase III is
the main enzyme that then elongates new DNA. Once initiated, a replication
bubble (replicon) forms as repeated cycles of elongation proceed at opposite
replication forks.
179 Replication Initiation in E. coli
Recalling that new nucleotides can only be added to the free 3' hydroxyl group of a
pre-existing nucleic acid strand. Since no known DNA polymerase can start
synthesizing new DNA strands from scratch, this is a problem!
CMB3e

183

The action of DNA polymerases therefore requires a primer, a nucleic acid strand
to which to add nucleotides. The questions were…, what is the primer and where
does it come from? Since RNA polymerases (enzymes that catalyze RNA
synthesis) are the only nucleotide polymerase that can grow a new nucleic acid
strand against a DNA template from scratch (i.e., from the first base), it was
suggested that RNA might be the primer, After synthesis of a short RNA primer,
new deoxynucleotides would be added to its 3’ end by DNA polymerase. The
discovery of short stretches of RNA nucleotides at the 5’ end of Okazaki fragments
confirmed the notion of RNA primers. We now know that cells use primase, a
special RNA polymerase active during replication, to make those RNA primers
against DNA templates before a DNA polymerase can grow the DNA strands at
replication forks. As we will see now, the requirement for RNA primers is nowhere
more in evidence in events at a replication fork.
2. Elongation
Looking at elongation at one replication fork (below), we see another problem:

Illustration by G. Bergtrom

CMB3e

184

One of the two new DNA strands can grow continuously towards the replication
fork as the double helix unwinds. But what about the other strand? Either this
other strand must grow in pieces in the opposite direction, or it must wait to begin
synthesis until the double helix is fully unwound.
If one strand of DNA must be replicated in fragments, then those fragments would
have to be stitched (i.e., ligated) together. The problem is illustrated below.

Illustration by G. Bergtrom

According to this hypothesis, a new leading strand of DNA is lengthened
continuously by sequential addition of nucleotides to its 3’ end against its leading
strand template. The other strand however, would be made in pieces that would
be joined in phosphodiester linkages in a subsequent reaction. Because of the
extra step and presumably extra time it takes to make and join these new DNA
fragments, this new DNA is called the lagging strand, making its template the
lagging strand template.
Reiji Okazaki and his colleagues were studying mutants of T4 phage that grew
slowly in their E. coli host cells. They graphed the growth rates of wild-type and
mutant T4 phage and demonstrated that slow growth was due to a deficient DNA

CMB3e

185

ligase enzyme, already known to catalyze the circularization of linear phage DNA
molecules being replicated in infected host cells. The graph below summarizes
their results.

Illustration by G. Bergtrom

Okazaki’s hypothesis was that the deficient DNA ligase in the mutant phage not
only slowed down circularization of replicating T4 phage DNA, but would also be
slow at joining phage DNA fragments replicated against at least one of the two
template DNA strands. When the hypothesis was tested, the Okazakis found that
short DNA fragments did indeed accumulate in E. coli cells infected with ligasedeficient mutants, but not in cells infected with wild type phage. The lagging strand
fragments are now called Okazaki fragments.

181 Okazaki Fragments are Made Beginning with RNA Primers
You can check out Okazaki’s original research at ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/Okazaki
article

CMB3e

186

Each Okazaki fragment would have to begin with a 5’ RNA primer, creating yet
another dilemma! The RNA primer must be replaced with deoxynucleotides before
stitching the fragments together. This in fact happens, and the process illustrated
below.

Illustration by G. Bergtrom

Removal of RNA primer nucleotides from Okazaki fragments requires the action of
DNA polymerase I, an enzyme that can also catalyze hydrolysis of the
phosphodiester bonds between the RNA (or DNA) nucleotides from the 5’-end of a
nucleic acid strand. Flap Endonuclease 1 (FEN 1) also plays a role in removing
‘flaps’ of nucleic acid from the 5’ ends of the fragments often displaced by
polymerase as it replaces the replication primer. At the same time as the RNA
nucleotides are removed, DNA polymerase I catalyzes their replacement by the
appropriate deoxynucleotides. Finally, when a fragment is entirely DNA, DNA
ligase links it to the rest of the already assembled lagging strand DNA. Because
of its 5’ exonuclease activity (not found in other DNA polymerases), DNA
polymerase 1 also plays unique roles in DNA repair (discussed further below).
As Cairn’s suggested and others demonstrated, replication proceeds in two
directions from the origin to form a replicon with its two replication forks (RFs).
Each RF has a primase associated with replication of Okazaki fragments along
lagging strand templates.
CMB3e

The requirement for primases at replication forks is shown below.

Now we can ask what happens when replicons reach the ends of linear
chromosomes in eukaryotes.
182 Replication Elongation in E. coli
3. Termination
In prokaryotes, replication is complete when two replication forks meet after
replicating their portion of the circular DNA molecule. In eukaryotes, many
replicons fuse to become larger replicons, eventually reaching the ends of the
chromosomes…, where there is yet another problem (below)!
Illustration by G. Bergtrom

CMB3e

188

When a replicon nears the end of a chromosome (i.e. a double-stranded DNA
molecule), the strand synthesized continuously stops when it reaches the 5’ end of
its template DNA. In theory, synthesis of a last Okazaki fragment can be primed
from the 3’ end of the lagging template strand. The illustration above implies
removal of a primer from the penultimate Okazaki fragment and DNA polymerase
catalyzed replacement with DNA nucleotides. But what about the last Okazaki
fragment? Would its primer be hydrolyzed? Moreover, without a free 3’ end to
add to, how are those RNA nucleotides replaced with DNA nucleotides? The
problem here is that every time a cell replicates, one strand of new DNA (likely
both) would get shorter and shorter. Of course, this would not do…, and does not
happen! Eukaryotic replication undergoes a termination process involving
extending the length of one of the two strands by the enzyme telomerase. The
action of telomerase is summarized in the illustration below.

Illustration by
G. Bergtrom

Telomerase consists of several proteins and an RNA. From the drawing,, the RNA
component serves as a template for 5’-> 3’ extension of the problematic DNA
strand. The protein with the requisite reverse transcriptase activity is called
Telomerase Reverse Transcriptase, or TERT. The Telomerase RNA Component
is called TERC. Carol Greider, Jack Szostak and Elizabeth Blackburn shared the
2009 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for discovering telomerase.
183 Telomere Replication Prevents Chromosome Shortening

CMB3e

189

One of the more interesting recent observations was that differentiated, nondividing cells no longer produce the telomerase enzyme. On the other hand, the
telomerase genes are active in normal dividing cells (e.g., stem cells) and cancer
cells, which contain abundant telomerase.
4. Is Replication Processive?
Drawings of replicons and replication forks suggest separate events on each DNA
strand. Yet events at replication forks seem to be coordinated. Replication may
be processive, meaning both new DNA strands are replicated in the same
direction at the same time, smoothing out the process. How might this be
possible? The drawing below shows lagging strand template DNA bending, so
that it faces in the same direction as the leading strand at the replication fork.

Illustration by G. Bergtrom

184 Processive Replication

CMB3e

190

The replisome structure cartooned at the replication fork consists of clamp
proteins, primase, helicase, DNA polymerase and single-stranded binding proteins
among others.
Newer techniques of visualizing replication by real-time fluorescence videography
call the processive model into question, suggesting that the replication process is
anything but smooth! Are lagging and leading strand replication not in fact
coordinated? Alternatively, is the jerky movement of DNA elongation in the video
an artifact, so that the model of smooth, coordinated replication integrated at a
replisome still valid? Or is coordination defined and achieved in some other way?
Check out the video yourself in the article at 2017 Real-Time Fluorescent
Replication Video.
5. One more problem with replication
Cairns recorded many images of E. coli of the sort shown below.

Illustration by G. Bergtrom

The coiled, twisted appearance of the replicating circles were interpreted to be a
natural consequence of trying to pull apart helically intertwined strands of DNA…
or intertwined strands of any material! As the strands continued to unwind, the

CMB3e

191

DNA should twist into a supercoil of DNA. Increased DNA unwinding would
cause the phosphodiester bonds in the DNA to rupture, fragmenting the DNA.
Obviously, this does not happen. Experiments were devised to demonstrate
supercoiling, and to test hypotheses explaining how cells relax the supercoils
during replication. Testing these hypotheses revealed the topoisomerase
enzymes. These enzymes bind and hold on to DNA, catalyze hydrolysis of
phosphodiester bonds, control unwinding of the double helix, and finally catalyze
the re-formation of the phosphodiester linkages. It is important to note that the
topoisomerases are not part of a replisome, but can act far from a replication fork,
probably responding to the tensions in overwound DNA. Recall that
topoisomerases comprise much of the protein lying along eukaryotic chromatin.
185 Topoisomerases Relieve Supercoiling During Replication
We have considered most of the molecular players in replication. Below is a list of
the key replication proteins and their functions (from DNA Replication in
Wikipedia):

CMB3e

192

III. DNA Repair
A. DNA Damage (Mutation) is a Fact of Life
We generally accept the notion that replication faithfully duplicates the genetic
material. At the same time, evolution would not be possible without mutation, and
mutation is not possible without at least some adverse consequences.
Germline mutations are heritable. When present in one, but especially in both alleles
of a gene, such mutations can result in genetic disease (e.g., Tay-Sach’s disease,
cystic fibrosis, hemophilia, sickle-cell anemia, etc.). Rather than causing disease,
some germline mutations may increase the likelihood of becoming ill (e.g., mutations
of the BRCA2 gene greatly increase a woman’s odds of getting breast cancer).
Somatic mutations in actively dividing cells might result in benign “cysts” or
malignant tumors (i.e., cancer). Other somatic mutations may play a role in dementia
(Alzheimer’s disease) or in some of the neuropathologies along the autism spectrum.
Since the complex chemistry of replication is subject to an inherent high rate of error,
cells have evolved systems of DNA repair to survive high mutation rates. As we saw,
DNA polymerases themselves have proofreading ability so that incorrectly inserted
bases can be quickly removed and replaced. Beyond this, multiple mechanisms have
evolved to repair mismatched base pairs and other kinds of damaged DNA that
escape early detection. How often and where DNA damage occurs is random, as is
which damage will be repaired and which will escape to become a mutation. For
those suffering the awful consequences of unrepaired mutation, the balance between
retained and repaired DNA, damage is to say the least, imperfect. However, evolution
and the continuance of life itself rely on this balance.
B. What Causes DNA Damage
DNA is most exposed and therefore most vulnerable to damage, especially in
eukaryotes. The simplest damage to DNA during replication is the point mutation, the
accidental insertion of a ‘wrong’ nucleotide into a growing DNA strand. Other
mutations, equally accidental, include DNA deletions, duplications, inversions, etc.,
any of which might escape repair. The causes of DNA damage can be chemical or
physical, and include spontaneous intracellular events (e.g., oxidative reactions) and
environmental factors (radiation, exogenous chemicals, etc.). Based on studies of
different kinds of DNA damage, Thomas Lindahl estimated that DNA damaging events
might be occurring at the rate of 10,000 per day! Lindahl realized that there must be

CMB3e

193

some “fundamental DNA repair mechanisms” at work to protect cells against such a
high rate of DNA damage. The discovery of the base excision repair mechanism
earned Thomas Lindahl a share in the 2015 Nobel Prize in Chemistry.
Environmental factors that can damage DNA include UV light, X-rays and other
radiation, as well as chemicals (e.g., toxins, carcinogens, and even drugs, etc.). Both
germline and somatic cells can be affected. While mutations can and do cause
often debilitating diseases, it is instructive to keep the impact of mutations in
perspective.
Most mutations are actually silent; they do not cause disease. In addition, much DNA
damage is repaired. Cells correct more than 99.9% of mistaken base changes before
they have a chance to become mutations. That is why we think of replication as a
“faithful” process. Let’s look at some common types of DNA damage that are usually
repaired:


Pyrimidine dimers, typical of adjacent thymines (less often cytosines) in a single
DNA strand, caused by UV exposure



Depurination; the hydrolytic removal of guanine or adenine from the #1 C (carbon)
of deoxyribose in a DNA strand



Deamination: hydrolytic removal of amino (-NH2) groups from guanine (most
common), cytosine or adenine



Oxidative damage of deoxyribose with any base, but most commonly purines



Inappropriate methylation of any bases, but most commonly purines



DNA strand breakage during replication or from radiation or chemical exposure

C. Some Molecular Consequences of Uncorrected DNA Damage
While bacteria suffer DNA damage, we will focus here on eukaryotes since they have
evolved the most sophisticated mechanisms. Remember that unrepaired DNA
damage will be passed on to daughter cells in mitosis, or might be passed on to the
next generation if the mutation occurs in a germline cell.
Next, let us consider some molecular consequences of uncorrected DNA damage.

CMB3e

194

1. Depurination
This is the spontaneous hydrolytic removal of guanine or adenine from
deoxyribose C#1 in a DNA strand. Its frequency of 5000 depurinations per cell per
day emphases the high rate of DNA damage that demands a fix! If not
repaired, depurination results in a single base-pair deletion in one chromosome
after replication, leaving the DNA in the same region of the other chromosome
unchanged. The effects of depurination are illustrated below.

Illustration by G. Bergtrom

The replisome ignores the missing base during replication of the depurinated DNA
region (an A in this example), jumping to the C in the depurinated template DNA.
Unrepaired, one new double-stranded DNA will have a deletion, leaving the other
new one with no mutation.
2. Pyrimidine Dimerization
UV light exposure of DNA can cause adjacent pyrimidines (commonly thymines;
less often, cytosines) on a DNA strand to dimerize. Pyrimidine dimers form at a
rate of a bit less than 100 per cell per day!

CMB3e

195

Uncorrected dimerization results in 2-base deletion in one chromosome while the
other is unchanged (below).

Illustration by G. Bergtrom

You can predict that correction of this radiation-induced damage will either involve
disrupting the dimers (in this case thymine dimers), or removal and replacement of
the dimerized bases by monomeric bases.
3. Deamination
Deamination is the hydrolytic removal of amino (-NH2) groups from guanine (most
common), cytosine or adenine, at a rate of 100 per cell per day. Deamination does
not affect thymine (because it has no –amino groups!). Uncorrected deamination
results in a base substitution on one chromosome (actually, a T-A pair substitution
for the original C-G in this example) and no change on the other. Deamination of
adenine or guanine results in unnatural bases (hypoxanthine and xanthine,
respectively). These are easily recognized and corrected by DNA repair systems.
The U-A base pair remains occasionally un-repaired.

CMB3e

196

The consequences of deamination to base sequence are shown below.

Illustration by G. Bergtrom

D. DNA Repair Mechanisms
Many enzymes and proteins are involved in DNA repair. Some of these function in
normal replication, mitosis and meiosis, but were co-opted for DNA repair activities.
These molecular co-optations are so vital to normal cell function that some repair
activities and molecular players are highly conserved in evolution. Among different
DNA repair pathways that have been identified, we will look at Base Excision Repair,
Nucleotide Excision Repair, Transcription Coupled Repair, Non-homologous
End-Joining, and Homologous Recombination (of these, the last is perhaps the
most complex).
1. Base Excision Repair
Upon detection and recognition of an incorrect base (e.g., oxidized bases, openring bases, deaminated Cs or As, bases containing C=C bonds saturated to C-C
bonds…), specific DNA glycosylases catalyze hydrolysis of the damaged base

CMB3e

197

from affected deoxyribose in the DNA. To learn more about the specific versions of
this enzyme, click https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA_glycosylase. Events of
base excision repair are summarized below.

Illustration by G. Bergtrom

After a DNA glycosylase removes an offending base, an AP endonuclease
recognizes the deoxyribose with the missing base and nicks the DNA at that
nucleotide. Phosphodiesterase next hydrolyzes the remaining phosphate-ester
bond of ‘base-less’ sugar phosphate, removing it from the DNA strand. DNA
polymerase then adds correct nucleotide to the 3’ end of the nick. Finally, DNA
ligase III (an ATP-dependent mammalian version of the original prokaryotic
enzyme) seals the remaining nick in the strand. Thomas Lindahl (see above)
discovered most of these enzymes.
2. Nucleotide Excision Repair
The discovery of nucleotide excision repair earned Aziz Sancar a share in the
2015 Nobel Prize in Chemistry. The results of this mechanism include the removal
of thymidine dimers.

CMB3e

198

The events of nucleotide excision repair are shown below for a pyrimidine dimer.

Illustration by G. Bergtrom

In this example, an Excision Nuclease recognizes a pyrimidine dimer and
hydrolyzes phosphodiester bonds between nucleotides several bases away from
either side of the dimer. A DNA helicase then unwinds and separates the DNA
fragment containing the dimerized bases from the damaged DNA strand. Finally,
DNA polymerase acts 5’-3’ to fill in the gap and DNA ligase seals the remaining
nick to complete the repair.
3. Mismatch repair
DNA Mismatch Repair occurs when DNA polymerase proofreading misses an
incorrect base insertion into a new DNA strand. This repair mechanism relies on
the fact that double-stranded DNA shows a specific pattern of methylation. The
discovery of the mismatch repair mechanism earned Paul Modrich a share in the
2015 Nobel Prize in Chemistry. These methylation patterns are related to
epigenetic patterns of gene activity and chromosome structure that are expected
to be inherited by daughter cells. When DNA replicates, the methyl groups on
the template DNA strands remain, but the newly synthesized DNA is unmethylated. In fact, it will take some time for methylation enzymes to locate and
methylate the appropriate nucleotides in the new DNA. In the intervening time,

CMB3e

199

several proteins and enzymes can detect inappropriate base pairing (the
mismatches) and initiate mismatch repair. The basic process is illustrated below.

Mismatch repaired

4. Transcription Coupled Repair (in Eukaryotes)
If an RNA polymerase reading a template DNA encounters a nicked template or
one with an unusual base substitution, it might stall transcription and “not know
what to do next”. Thus at a loss, a normal transcript would not be made and the
cell might not survive. No big deal in a tissue comprised of thousands if not
millions of cells, right? Nevertheless, Transcription Coupled Repair exists! In
this repair pathway, if RNA polymerase encounters a DNA lesion (i.e., damaged
DNA) while transcribing a template strand, it will indeed stall. This allows time for
coupling proteins to reach the stalled polymerase and enable repair machinery
(e.g., by base, or nucleotide excision) to effect the repair. Once the repair is
complete, the RNA polymerase ‘backs up’ along the template strand with the help
of other factors, and resumes transcription of the corrected template.

CMB3e

200

5. Non-homologous End-Joining
DNA replication errors can cause double stranded breaks, as can environmental
factors (ionizing radiation, oxidation, etc.). Repair by non-homologous endjoining deletes damaged and adjacent DNA and rejoins the ‘cut’ ends (shown
below).
Illustration by G. Bergtrom

Once the site of a double-stranded break is recognized, nucleotides hydrolyzed
from the ends of both strands at the break-site leave ‘blunt ends’. Next, several
proteins (Ku among others) bring DNA strands together and further hydrolyze
single DNA strands to create staggered (overlapping, or complementary) ends.
The overlapping ends of these DNA strands form H-bonds. Finally, DNA ligase
seals the H-bonded overlapping ends of DNA strands, leaving a repair with deleted
bases.
In older people, there is evidence of more than 2000 ‘footprints’ of this kind of
repair per cell. How is this possible? This quick-fix repair often works with no ill
effects because most of the eukaryotic genome does not encode genes or even
regulatory DNA (whose damage would otherwise be more serious).
6. Homologous Recombination
Homologous recombination is a complex but normal and frequent part of meiosis in
eukaryotes. You may recall that homologous recombination occurs in synapsis
in the first cell division of meiosis (Meiosis I). During synapsis,

CMB3e

201

homologous chromosomes align. This may lead to DNA breakage, an exchange
of alleles, and ligation to reseal the now recombinant DNA molecules. Novel
recombinations of variant alleles in the chromosomes of sperm and eggs ensure
genetic diversity in species. The key point is that DNA breakage of DNA is
required to exchange alleles between homologous chromosomes. Consult the
genetics chapter in an introductory biology textbook, or the recombination chapter
in a genetics text to be reminded of these events.
Cells use the same machinery to reseal DNA breaks during normal recombination
and to repair DNA damaged by single or double stranded breakage. A single DNA
strand nicked during replication can be repaired by recombination with strands of
homologous DNA that are being replicated on the other strand. A double stranded
break can be repaired using the same recombination machinery that operates on
sister chromatids in meiosis. In both cases, the process accurately repairs
damaged DNA without any deletions. These mechanisms are conserved in the
cells of all species. This indicates an evolutionary imperative of accurate repair to
the survival of species, no less than the imperative to maintain genetic diversity of
species.
a) Repair of a Single-Stranded Break
A specific example of homologous recombination repair is the re-establishment
of a replication fork damaged when a replisome reaches a break in one of the
two strands of replicating DNA (illustrated below).

Illustration by G. Bergtrom

Such a break may have occurred prior to replication itself, and repair begins
when the replication fork (RF) reaches the lesion. In the first step, a 5’-3’
exonuclease trims template DNA back along its newly synthesized
CMB3e

complement. Next, RecA protein monomers (each with multiple DNA binding
sites) bind to the single-stranded DNA to form a nucleoprotein filament. With
the help of additional proteins, the 3’ end of the ‘filament’ scans the ‘other’
replicating strand for homologous sequences. When such sequences are
found, the RecA-DNA filament binds to the homologous sequences and the
filament of new DNA ‘invades’ the homologous (i.e., opposite) double stranded
DNA, separating its template and newly replicated DNA. After strand
invasion, replication of a leading strand continues from the 3’ end of the
invading strand. A new RF is established as the leading strand template is
broken and re-ligated to the original break; New lagging strand replication then
resumes at the new (re-built) RF. The result is an accurate repair of the original
damage, with no deletions or insertions of DNA.
RecA, a bacterial protein, is another of those evolutionarily conserved proteins.
Its homolog in Archaea is called RadA. In Eukaryotes, the homolog is called
Rad51, where it initiates synapsis during meiosis. Thus, it seems that a role
for RecA and its conserved homologs in DNA repair predated its use in
synapsis and crossing over in eukaryotes! For more about the functions of
RecA protein and its homologs, click The functions of RecA.
b) Repair of a Double-Stranded Break
Homologous recombination can also repair a double-stranded DNA break with
the aid of a number of enzymes and other proteins. Alternate repair pathways
are summarized in the illustration on the next page. Here is a list of proteins
involved in these homologous recombination pathways:
MRX, MRN: bind at double-stranded break; recruit other factors.
Sae2: an endonuclease (active when phosphorylated).
Sgs1: a helicase.
Exo1, Dna2: single strand exonucleases.
RPA, Rad51, DMC1: proteins that bind to overhanging DNA to form a
nucleoprotein filament and initiate strand invasion at similar sequences.
The activities of other enzymes in the drawing are identified. Not shown in this
illustration are two gene products that interact with some of the proteins that
mediate the repair pathway. These are products of the BRCA1 and BRCA2
genes (the same ones that when mutated, increase the likelihood of a woman
getting breast cancer). Expressed mainly in breast tissue, their wild-type
(normal) gene products participate in homologous recombination repair of
double-stranded DNA breaks. They do this by binding to Rad51 (the human
RecA homolog!).

RNA Transcription, RNA Polymerases, Initiation, Elongation, Termination, Processing

I.

Introduction

Transcription, the synthesis of RNA based on a DNA template, is the central step of the
Central Dogma proposed by Crick in 1958. The basic steps of transcription are the same
as for replication: initiation, elongation and termination. Differences between
transcription in prokaryotes and eukaryotes are in the details. Here are some:
 E. coli uses a single RNA polymerase enzyme to transcribe all kinds of RNAs while
eukaryotic cells use different RNA polymerases to catalyze ribosomal RNA (rRNA),
transfer RNA (tRNA) and messenger RNA (mRNA) synthesis.
 In contrast to eukaryotes, some bacterial genes are part of operons whose mRNAs
encode multiple polypeptides.
 Bacterial mRNAs are typically translated as they are being transcribed.
 Most RNA transcripts in prokaryotes emerge from transcription ready to use
 Eukaryotic transcripts synthesized as longer precursors undergo processing by
trimming, splicing, or both!
 DNA in bacteria is virtually ‘naked’ in the cytoplasm while eukaryotic DNA is wrapped
up in chromatin proteins in a nucleus.
 In bacterial cells the association of ribosomes with mRNA and the translation of a
polypeptide can begin even before the transcript is finished. This is because these
cells have no nucleus. In our cells, RNAs must exit the nucleus before they encounter
ribosomes in the cytoplasm.
In this chapter, you will meet bacterial polycistronic mRNAs (transcripts of operons
that encode more than one polypeptide) and the split genes of eukaryotes (with their
introns and exons. We will look at some details of transcription of the three major
classes of RNA and then at how eukaryotes process precursor transcripts into mature,
functional RNAs. Along the way, we will see one example of how protein structure has
evolved to interact with DNA.
Learning Objectives
When you have mastered the information in this chapter, you should be able to:
1. discriminate between the three steps of transcription in pro- and eukaryotes, and the
factors involved in each.
2. state an hypothesis for why eukaryotes evolved complex RNA processing steps.
3. speculate on why any cell in its right mind would have genes containing introns and
exons so that their transcripts would have to be processed by splicing.

Overview of Transcription

A. The Major Types of Cellular RNA
All cells make three main kinds of RNA: ribosomal RNA (rRNA), transfer RNA (tRNA)
and messenger RNA (mRNA). rRNA is a structural as well as enzymatic component
of ribosomes, the protein-synthesizing machine in the cell. Quantitatively, rRNAs are
by far the most abundant RNAs in the cell and mRNAs, the least. Three rRNAs and
about 50 ribosomal proteins make up the two subunits of a bacterial ribosome, as
illustrated below.

CMB3e

207

tRNAs are the decoding devices used in protein synthesis (translation) to convert
nucleic acid sequence information into the amino acid sequences of polypeptides.
tRNAs attached to amino acids are positioned on ribosomes based on codonanticodon recognition, as shown below.

Illustration by G. Bergtrom

During translation, tRNAs decode base sequences in messenger RNA (mRNAs) into
amino acid sequences of polypeptides.
186 Transcription Overview: Ribosomes and Ribosomal RNAs
187 Transcription Overview: Demonstrating the Major RNAs
In 2009, Venkatraman Ramakrishnan, Thomas A. Steitz and ADA Yonath received the
Nobel Prize in Chemistry their studies on the structure and molecular biology of the
ribosome. Dr. Yonath is one of five women to receive a Nobel Prize – the others were
Marie Curie, Irène Joliot-Curie, Dorothy Hodgkin and Barbara Mclintock.
The fact that genes are inside the eukaryotic nucleus and that the synthesis of
polypeptides encoded by those genes happens in the cytoplasm led to the proposal
that there must be a messenger RNA (mRNA. Sidney Brenner eventually confirmed
the existence of mRNAs. Check out his classic experiment in Brenner S (1961, An
unstable intermediate carrying information from genes to ribosomes for protein
synthesis. Nature 190:576-581).

CMB3e

208

Recall polypeptide synthesis by the formation of polyribosomes (polysomes) along a
single mRNA, as illustrated below.

Illustration by G. Bergtrom

While mRNA is a small fraction of total cellular RNA, there are still smaller amounts of
other RNAs such as the transient primers that we saw in DNA replication. We’ll
encounter still other kinds of low-abundance RNAs later.
B. Key Steps of Transcription
In transcription, an RNA polymerase uses the template DNA strand of a gene to
catalyze synthesis of a complementary, antiparallel RNA strand. RNA polymerases
use ribose nucleotide triphosphate (NTP) precursors, in contrast to DNA
polymerases, which use deoxyribose nucleotide (dNTP) precursors. In addition,
RNAs incorporate uracil (U) nucleotides into RNA strands instead of the thymine (T)
nucleotides that end up in new DNA. Another contrast to replication - RNA synthesis
does not require a primer. With the help of transcription initiation factors, RNA
polymerase locates the transcription start site of a gene and begins synthesis of a new
RNA strand from scratch. Finally, like replication, transcription is error-prone.
The basic steps of transcription are summarized on the next page. Here we can
identify several of the DNA sequences that characterize a gene. The promoter is the
binding site for RNA polymerase. It usually lies 5’ to, or upstream of the transcription
start site (the bent arrow). Binding of the RNA polymerase positions the enzyme to

CMB3e

209

near the transcription start site, where it will start unwinding the double helix and begin
synthesizing new RNA. The transcribed grey DNA region in each of the three panels
are the transcription unit of the gene. Termination sites are typically 3’ to, or
downstream from the transcribed region of the gene. By convention, upstream refers
to DNA 5’ to a given reference point on the DNA (e.g., the transcription start-site of a
gene). Downstream then, refers to DNA 3’ to a given reference point on the DNA.

188 Transcription Overview: The Basic Mechanism of RNA Synthesis
In bacteria, some transcription units encode more than one kind of RNA. Bacterial
operons are an example of this phenomenon. The resulting mRNAs can be translated
into multiple polypeptides at the same time.

CMB3e

210

In the illustration below, RNA polymerase is transcribing a single mRNA molecule
encoding three separate polypeptides.

Illustration by G. Bergtrom

Bacterial transcription of the different RNAs requires only one RNA polymerase.
Different RNA polymerases catalyze rRNA, mRNA and tRNA transcription in
eukaryotes. Roger Kornberg received the Nobel Prize in Medicine in 2006 for his
discovery of the role of RNA polymerase II and other proteins involved in eukaryotic
messenger RNA transcription (like father-like son!!).
189 RNA Polymerases in Prokaryotes and Eukaryotes
While mRNAs, rRNAs and tRNAs are most of what cells transcribe, a growing number
of other RNAs (e.g., siRNAs, miRNAs, lncRNAs…) are also transcribed. Some
functions of these transcripts (including control of gene expression or other transcript
use) are discussed elsewhere.
C. RNAs are Extensively Processed After Transcription in Eukaryotes
Many eukaryotic RNAs are processed (trimmed, chemically modified) from large
precursor RNAs to mature, functional RNAs. These precursor RNAs (pre-RNAs, or
primary transcripts) contain in their sequences the information necessary for their
function in the cell.

CMB3e

211

Processing of the three major types of transcripts in eukaryotes is shown below.

Illustration by G. Bergtrom

To summarize the illustration:
1. Many eukaryotic genes are ‘split’ into coding regions (exons) and non-coding
intervening regions (introns).
2. Transcription of split genes generates a primary mRNA transcript (pre-mRNA).
3. Primary transcripts are spliced to remove the introns from the exons; exons are
then ligated into a continuous mRNA. In some cases, the same pre-mRNA is
spliced into alternate mRNAs encoding related but not identical polypeptides!
4. Pre-rRNA is cleaved and/or trimmed (not spliced!) to make shorter mature rRNAs.
5. Pre-tRNAs are trimmed, some bases within the transcript are modified and 3 bases
(not encoded by the tRNA gene) are enzymatically added to the 3’-end.
190 Post Transcriptional Processing Overview
The details of transcription and processing differ substantially in prokaryotes and
eukaryotes. Let’s focus first on details of transcription itself, and then RNA
processing.
CMB3e

212

II.

Details of Transcription

Find a well-written summary of transcription in prokaryotes and eukaryotes at an NIH
website (Transcription in Prokaryotes and Eukaryotes). Here (and at this link), you will
encounter proteins that bind DNA. Some proteins bind DNA to regulate transcription,
inducing or silencing transcription of a gene. We will discuss their role in the regulation of
gene expression later. Other proteins interact with DNA simply to allow transcription.
These include one or more that, along with RNA polymerase itself, that must bind to the
gene promoter to initiate transcription. We will look at bacterial transcription first.
A. Transcription in Prokaryotes
In E. coli, a single RNA polymerase transcribes all kinds of RNA, associating with one
of several sigma factor proteins (factors) to initiate transcription. It turns out that
different promoter sequences and corresponding factors play roles in the
transcription of different genes (illustrated below).

Illustration by G. Bergtrom

In the absence of the factor, the E. coli RNA polymerase can transcribe RNA, but
does so at a high rate, and from random sequences in the chromosome. In contrast,
when the factor is bound to the RNA polymerase, the complex seems to scan the
DNA, recognize and then bind to the promoter sequence of a gene. In this case, the
overall transcription rate is slower, but only genes are transcribed, rather than random
bits of the bacterial genome! The Pribnow box, named for its discoverer, was the first
promoter sequence characterized.

CMB3e

213

One way bacteria regulate which gene expression is to control selectively the cellular
concentrations of different factors. A recent example may be sigma 54, a protein
produced under stress (e.g., higher temperatures, antibiotic attack…). Sigma 54
bound RNA polymerase finds and binds to the promoters of genes the bacterium
express to mount a defense against the stress (for more details, check out Sigma 54 a bacterial stress protein that alters transcription). We shall see more modes of
prokaryotic gene regulation in the next chapter.
Soon after transcription is initiated, the factor falls off the RNA polymerase, which
then continues unwinding the double helix and elongating the transcript (illustrated
below).

Illustration by G. Bergtrom

Elongation is the successive addition of nucleotides complementary to their DNA
templates, forming phosphodiester linkages. The enzymatic reactions of elongation
are similar to the DNA polymerase-catalyzed elongation during replication.
There are two ways that bacterial RNA polymerase ‘knows’ when it has reached the
end of a transcription unit. In one case, as the RNA polymerase nears the 3’ end of
the nascent transcript, it transcribes a 72 base, C-rich region. At this point, a
termination factor called the rho protein binds to the nascent RNA strand. rho is an
ATP-dependent helicase that breaks the H-bonds between the RNA and the template
DNA strand, thereby preventing further transcription.

CMB3e

214

rho-dependent termination is illustrated below.

Illustration by G. Bergtrom

In the other mechanism of termination, the polymerase transcribes RNA whose
termination signal assumes a secondary hairpin loop structure that causes the
dissociation of the RNA polymerase, template DNA and the new RNA transcript.
The role of the hairpin loop in rho-independent termination is illustrated below.

Illustration by G. Bergtrom

191 Details of Prokaryotic Transcription

CMB3e

215

B. Transcription in Eukaryotes
Whereas bacteria rely on a single RNA polymerase for their transcription needs,
eukaryotes use three different RNA polymerases to synthesize the three major
different kinds of RNA, as shown below.

Note that catalysis of the synthesis of most of the RNA in a eukaryotic cell (rRNAs) is
by RNA polymerase I. With the help of initiation proteins, each RNA polymerase
initiates transcription at a promoter sequence. Once initiated, the RNA polymerases
then catalyze the successive formation of phosphodiester bonds to elongate the
transcript. Recall that mRNAs are the least abundant in eukaryotes as they are in
bacterial cells.
Unfortunately, the details of the termination of transcription in eukaryotes are not as
well understood as they are in bacteria. Therefore, we will focus on initiation, and then
consider the processing of different eukaryotic RNAs into ready-to-use molecules.
1. Eukaryotic mRNA Transcription
The multiple steps of eukaryotic mRNA transcription are shown on the next page.

CMB3e

216

The Multiple Steps of Eukaryotic mRNA Transcription

Illustration by G. Bergtrom

Transcription of eukaryotic mRNAs by RNA polymerase II begins with the
sequential assembly of a eukaryotic initiation complex at a gene promoter. The
typical eukaryotic promoter for a protein-encoding gene contains a TATA box DNA
sequence motif as well as additional short upstream sequences. TATA-binding
protein (TBP) first binds to the TATA box along with TFIID (transcription initiation
factor IID).

CMB3e

217

This intermediate recruits TFIIA and TFIIB. Next, TFGIIE, TFIIF and TFIIH, several
other initiation factors and RNA polymerase II bind to form the transcription
initiation complex. Phosphorylation adds several phosphates to the aminoterminus of the RNA polymerase, after which some of the TF’s dissociate from the
initiation complex. The remaining RNA polymerase-TF complex can now start
making the mRNA.
Unlike prokaryotic RNA polymerase, eukaryotic RNA Polymerase II does not have
an inherent helicase activity. For this, eukaryotic gene transcription relies on the
multi-subunit TFIIH protein, in which two subunits have helicase activity.
Consistent with the closer relationship of archaea to eukaryotes (rather to
prokaryotes), archaeal mRNA transcription initiation resembles that of eukaryotes,
albeit requiring fewer initiation factors during formation of an initiation complex.
192 Eukaryotic mRNA Transcription
A significant difference between prokaryotic and eukaryotic transcription is that
RNA polymerase and other proteins involved at a gene promoter do not see naked
DNA. Instead, they must recognize specific DNA sequences through chromatin
proteins. On the other hand, all proteins that interact with DNA have in
common a need to recognize the DNA sequences to which they must bind…,
within the double helix. In other words, they must see the bases within the helix,
and not on its uniformly electronegative phosphate backbone surface. To this
end, they must penetrate the DNA, usually through the major groove of the
double helix. We will see that DNA regulatory proteins face the same problems in
achieving specific shape-based interactions!
193 Recognition of Transcription factors at Promoters
2. Eukaryotic tRNA and 5SRNA Transcription
Transcription of 5S rRNA and tRNAs by RNA Polymerase III is unusual in that the
promoter sequence to which it binds (with the help of initiation factors) is not
upstream of the transcribed sequence, but lies within the transcribed sequence.
After binding to this internal promoter, the polymerase re-positions itself to
transcribe the RNA from the transcription start site so that the final transcript thus
contains the promoter sequence!

CMB3e

218

5S rRNA transcription by RNA polymerase III is shown below.

Illustration by G. Bergtrom

3. Transcription of the Other Eukaryotic rRNAs
tRNAs are also transcribed by RNA polymerase III in much the same way as the
5S rRNA. The other rRNAs are transcribed by RNA polymerase I, which binds to
an upstream promoter along with transcription initiation factors. We know less of
the details of this process compared to our understanding of mRNA transcription.
We’ll explore what we do know next. As already noted, transcription termination is
not as well understood in eukaryotes as in prokaryotes. Coupled termination and
polyadenylation steps common to most prokaryotic mRNAs are discussed in more
detail below, with a useful summary at the NIH-NCBI website Eukaryotic
Transcription Termination.

III.

Details of Eukaryotic mRNA Processing

Eukaryotic mRNA primary transcripts undergo extensive processing, including splicing,
capping and, polyadenylation. The steps described here are considered in order of
(sometimes overlapping!) occurrence. We begin with splicing, an mRNA phenomenon.
A. Spliceosomal Introns
Bacterial gene coding regions are continuous. The discovery of eukaryotic split genes
with introns and exons came as quite a surprise. Not only did it seem incongruous for
evolution to have stuck irrelevant DNA in the middle of coding DNA, no one could
have dreamt up such a thing! For their discovery of split genes, by Richard J. Roberts
and Phillip A. Sharp shared the Nobel Prize for Physiology in 1993. In fact, all but a
few eukaryotic genes are split, and some have one, two (or more than 30-50!) introns
separating bits of coding DNA, the exons. Splicing is summarized below.

Illustration by G. Bergtrom

Splicing involves a number of small ribonuclear proteins (snRNPs). snRNPs are
particles composed of RNA and proteins. They bind to specific sites in an mRNA and
then direct a sequential series of cuts and ligations (the splicing) necessary to process
the mRNAs.

CMB3e

220

The role of snRNPs in splicing pre-mRNAs is illustrated below.

Illustration by G. Bergtrom

snRNP binding to a pair of splice sites flanking an intron in a pre-mRNA forms the
spliceosome that completes the splicing, including removal of the lariat (the
intermediate structure of the intron). The last step is to ligate exons into a continuous
mRNA with all its codons intact and ready for translation.
Spliceosome action is summarized below.

221

B. Specific Nuclear bodies and their associated proteins facilitate the assembly
and function of the SnRNPs
Recall the organization of nuclei facilitated by nuclear bodies. Cajal bodies (CBs) and
Gems are nuclear bodies that are similar in size and have related functions in
assembling spliceosomal SnRNPs. Some splicing defects correlate with mutations in
the coil protein that associate with Cajal bodies; others correlate with mutations in SMN
proteins normally associated with Gems. An hypothesis was that CBs and Gems
interact in SnRNP and spliceosome assembly…, but how? Consider the results of an
experiment in which antibodies to coilin and the SMN protein were localized in
undifferentiated and differentiated neuroblastoma cells.

Creative Commons Deed, NC, Attribution 2.5 Adapted from: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19735367

A and C are undifferentiated cells in culture; B and D are cells that were stimulated to
differentiate. In the fluorescence micrographs at the right, arrows point to fluorescent
nuclear bodies. The coilin protein is associated with CBs and SMN is found in Gems.
Therefore, we expect that fluorescent antibodies to coilin (green) will localize to CBs
and antibodies to SMN protein (red) will bind to Gems. This is what happens in the
nuclei of undifferentiated cells (panel C). But in panel D, the two antibodies colocalize, suggesting that the CBs and Gems aggregate in the differentiated cells. This
would explain the need for both functional coilin and SMN protein to produce
functional SnRNPs. The CBs and Gems may be aggregating in differentiated cells
due to an observed increase in expression of the SMN protein. This could lead to
more active Gems more able to associate with the CBs.
This and similar experiments demonstrate that different nuclear bodies do have
specific functions. They are not random structural artifacts, have evolved to organize
nuclear activities in time and space in ways that are essential to the cell.
CMB3e

222

C. Group I and Group II Self-Splicing Introns
While Eukaryotic Spliceosomal introns are spliced using snRNPs as described above,
Group I or Group II introns are removed by different mechanisms. Group I introns
interrupt mRNA and tRNA genes in bacteria and in mitochondrial and chloroplast
genes. They are occasionally found in bacteriophage genes, but rarely in nuclear
genes, and then only in lower eukaryotes. Group I introns are self-splicing! Thus,
they are ribozymes that do not require snRNPs or other proteins. Instead, they fold
into a secondary stem-loop structure that positions catalytic nucleotides at appropriate
splice sites, excise themselves, and re-ligate the exons. Group II introns in
chloroplast and mitochondrial rRNA, mRNA, tRNA and some bacterial mRNAs can be
quite long, form complex stem-loop tertiary structures, and self-splice, at least in a test
tube! However, Group II introns encode proteins required for their own splicing in
vivo. Like spliceosomal introns, they form a lariat structure at an A residue branch
site. All this suggests that the mechanism of spliceosomal intron splicing evolved from
that of Group II introns.
D. So, Why Splicing?
The puzzle implied by the question of course is why higher organisms have split
genes in the first place. While the following discussion can apply to all splicing, it will
reference mainly spliceosomal introns. Here are some answers to the question “Why
splicing?”


Introns in nuclear genes are typically longer (often much longer!) than exons.
Since they are non-coding, they are large targets for mutation. In effect, noncoding DNA, including introns can buffer the ill effects of random mutations.



You may recall that gene duplication on one chromosome (and loss of a copy from
its homolog) arise from unequal recombination (non-homologous crossing over). It
occurs when similar DNA sequences align during synapsis of meiosis. In an
organism that inherits a chromosome with both gene copies, the duplicate can
accumulate mutations as long as the other retains original function. The diverging
gene then becomes part of a pool of selectable DNA, the grist of evolution, in the
descendants of organisms that inherit the duplicated genes, increasing species
diversity. Unequal recombination can also occur between similar sequences (e.g.,
in introns) in the same or different genes. Introns can also enable the sharing of
exons between genes. After unequal recombination between introns flanking an
exon, one gene will acquire another exon while the other will lose it. Once again,
as long as an organism retains a copy of the participating genes with original
function, the organism can make the required protein and survive. Meanwhile, the

CMB3e

223

gene with the extra exon may produce the same protein, but one with a new
structural domain and function. Like a complete duplicate gene, one with a new
exon and added function is in the pool of selectable DNA. Thus, this phenomenon
of exon shuffling increases species diversity! The evidence indicates that
exon shuffling has occurred, creating proteins with different overall functions that
nonetheless share at least one domain and one common function. An example
discussed earlier involves calcium-binding proteins that regulate many cellular
processes. Structurally related calcium (Ca++) binding domains are common to
many otherwise structurally and functionally unrelated proteins. Consider exon
shuffling in the unequal crossover (non-homologous recombination) illustrated
below.

Illustration by G. Bergtrom

In this example, regions of strong similarity in different (non-homologous) introns in
the same gene align during synapsis of meiosis. Unequal crossing over between
the genes inserts exon C in one of the genes. The other gene loses the exon (not
shown in the illustration).

CMB3e

224

In sum, introns are buffers against deleterious mutations, and equally valuable, are
potential targets for gene duplication and exon shuffling. This makes introns key
players in creating genetic diversity, the hallmark of evolution.
196 Origin of Introns
197 Intron Evolution-What was selected here?
E. Capping
A methyl guanosine cap added 5’-to-5’ to an mRNA functions in part to help mRNAs
leave the nucleus and associate with ribosomes. The cap is added to an exposed 5’
end, even as transcription and splicing are still in progress. A capping enzyme places
a methylated guanosine residue at the 5’-end of the mature mRNA. The 5’ cap
structure is shown below (check marks are 5’-3’ linked nucleotides).

Bergtrom

CMB3e

225

F. Polyadenylation
After transcription termination, poly(A) polymerase catalyzes the addition of
multiple AMP residues (several hundred in some cases) to the 3’ terminus by the
enzyme. The enzyme binds to an AAUAA sequence near the 3’ end of an mRNA
and begins to catalyze the addition of the adenosine monophosphates. The
AAUAA poly(A) recognition site is indicated in red in the illustration of
polyadenylation shown below.

Illustration by G. Bergtrom

The result of polyadenylation is a 3’ poly (A) tail whose functions include assisting
in the transit of mRNAs from the nucleus and regulating the half-life of mRNAs in
the cytoplasm. The poly (A) tail shortens each time a ribosome completes
translating the mRNA.

Ribosomal RNA Processing in Eukaryotic Nuclei

In most eukaryotes, a large rRNA gene in most eukaryotes transcribes a 45S precursor
transcript containing (from shortest to longest) 5.8S rRNA, 18SrRNA and 28S rRNA. The
‘S’ stands for Svedberg, the biochemist who developed the sedimentation velocity ultracentrifugation technique to separate molecules like RNA by size. The higher the S value,
the larger the molecule and therefore the faster it moves through the viscous sugar
gradient during centrifugation. RNA Polymerase I transcribes 45S precursor rRNAs (preRNAs) from multiple large transcription units in the genome (shown below).

Illustration by G. Bergtrom

The 45S pre-rRNA is processed by cleavage. The many copies (200-400!) of the 45S
gene in eukaryotic cells might be expected, since making proteins (and therefore
ribosomes) will be an all-consuming cellular activity. In humans, 45S genes (45S rDNA)
are distributed among five acrocentric chromosomes (those that have a centromere very
near one end of the chromosome). The 45S rDNA in chromosomes is packed in the
nucleolus inside nuclei.

CMB3e

227

Because these genes are present in so many copies and organized into a specific region
of chromatin, it is possible to visualize 45S transcription in progress in electron
micrographs such as the ones below.

The term lampbrush came from the shape of the 45S genes in the process of
transcription; the RNAs extending from the DNA template look like an old-fashioned brush
used to clean the chimney of a kerosene lamp.
Multiple gene copies encode 5S rRNAs. However, unlike the 45S rRNA genes, 5S rRNA
gene may be spread among many chromosomes (seven in Neurospora crassa, the bread
mold). Or in the case of humans, 5S RNA gene copies are distributed along chromosome
1. The 5S rRNA genes are transcribed by RNA polymerase III with minimal posttranscriptional processing. As already noted, the promoters of the 5S genes are within
the transcribed part of the genes, rather than upstream of their 5S transcription units.

 enzymatic addition of a -C-C-A base triplet at the 3’ end, and
 the modification of bases internal to the molecule
A yeast tRNA showing these modifications is illustrated below.

The 45S pre-rRNAs initially bind to ribosomal proteins in the nucleolus (that big
nuclear body!) to initiate assembly and then and serve as a scaffold for the continued
addition of ribosomal proteins to both the small and large ribosomal subunits. After
the 5S rRNA added to the nascent large ribosomal subunit, processing (cleavage) of
45S rRNA is completed and the subunits are separated. The separated ribosomal
subunits exit the nucleus o the cytoplasm where they will associate with mRNAs to
translate new proteins. To better understand what is going on, try summarizing what
you see here in the correct order of steps. You can also see this process animated at
this link: Ribosome Assembly and Transport from the Nucleus.
B. mRNA
The 5’ methyl guanosine cap and the poly(A) tail collaborate to facilitate exit of
mRNAs from the nucleus into the cytoplasm. We now understand that proteins in the
nucleus participate in the export process. A nuclear transport receptor binds along the
mature (or maturing) mRNA, a poly-A-binding protein binds along the poly-A tail of the
message, and another protein binds at or near the methyl guanosine CAP itself.
These interactions enable transport of the mRNA through nuclear pores. After the
mRNA is in the cytoplasm, the nuclear transport receptor re-cycles back into the
nucleus while a translation initiation factor replaces the protein bound to the CAP.
The nuclear transport process is summarized in the illustration below.

mRNA Export from the Nucleus . The mature mRNA, now in the cytoplasm, is ready
for translation. Translation is the process of protein synthesis mediated by ribosomes
and a host of translation factors (including the initiation factor in the illustration above.
The genetic code directs polypeptide synthesis during translation. Details of
translation will be discussed shortly.

The Genetic Code, tRNA (Adapter) Molecules, Translation (Protein Synthesis)

I.

Introduction

We begin this chapter with a look at how the genetic code was broken (deciphered).
The very terms genetic code, broken and deciphered came from what was at the time, the
recent history of the World War II. Winning WWII relied heavily on breaking enemy codes
(recall the Enigma machine), and hiding strategic battle information from the enemy
(recall the Navajo code talkers). We will look at the elegant experiments that first
deciphered the amino acid meaning of a few 3-base codons, and then all 64 codons. Of
these, 61 encode amino acids and three are stop codons. The same kinds of
experiments that broke the genetic code also led to our under-standing of the mechanism
of protein synthesis. Early studies indicated that genes and proteins are colinear, i.e.,
that the length of a gene was directly proportional to the polypeptide it encoded. It would
follow then, that the lengths of mRNAs are also collinear with their translation products.
Colinearity suggested the obvious hypotheses that translation proceeded in three steps
(initiation, elongation and termination), just like transcription itself. We now know that
initiation is a complex process involving the assembly of a translation machine near the 5’
end of the mRNA. This machine consists of ribosomes, mRNA, several initiation factors
and a source of chemical energy. Since mature mRNAs are actually longer than needed
to specify a polypeptide (even after splicing!), one function of initiation factors is to
position the ribosome and associated proteins near a start codon. The start codon
specifies the first amino acid in a new polypeptide. Once the initiation complex forms,
elongation begins. Cycles of condensation reactions on the ribosome connect amino
acids by peptide linkages, growing the chain from its amino-end to its carboxyl-end.
Translation ends when the ribosome moving along the mRNA encounters a stop codon.
We will look at how we came to understand the discrete steps of translation.
Learning Objectives
When you have mastered the information in this chapter, you should be able to:
1. compare and contrast the mechanisms and energetics of initiation, elongation and
termination of translation and transcription.
2. speculate on why the genetic code is universal (or nearly so).
3. justify early thinking about a 4-base genetic code.
4. justify early thinking about an overlapping genetic code (for example, one in which the
last base of a codon could be the first base of the next codon in an mRNA.
5. explain why all tRNA structures share some, but not other features.

CMB3e

234

6. compare and contrast the roles of the ribosomal A, E and P sites in translation.
7. trace the formation of an aminoacyl-tRNA and the bacterial Initiation Complex.
8. describe the steps of translation that require chemical energy from NTPs.
9. formulate an hypothesis to explain why stop codons all begin with U.
10. create a set of rules for inferring an amino acid sequence from a stretch of DNA
sequence.
11. speculate about why large eukaryotic genomes encode so few proteins.

II.

An Overview of the Genetic Code

A. The (Nearly) Universal, Degenerate Genetic Code
The genetic code is the information for linking amino acids into polypeptides in an
order based on the base sequence of 3-base code words (codons) in a gene and its
messenger RNA (mRNA). With a few exceptions (some prokaryotes, mitochondria,
chloroplasts), the genetic code is universal – it’s the same in all organisms from
viruses and bacteria to humans. The table of the Standard Universal Genetic Code
on the next page shows the RNA version of triplet codons and their corresponding
amino acids. There is a single codon for two amino acids (methionine and
tryptophan), but two or more codons for each of the other 18 amino acids. For the
latter reason, we say that the genetic code is degenerate. The three stop codons in
the Standard Genetic Code ‘tell’ ribosomes the location of the last amino acid to add
to a polypeptide. The last amino acid itself can be any amino acid consistent with the
function of the polypeptide being synthesized. However, evolution has selected AUG
as the start codon for all polypeptides, regardless of function, as well as for the
placement of methionine within a polypeptide. Thus, all polypeptides begin life with a
methionine at their amino-terminal end. As we will see in more detail, the mRNA
translation machine is the ribosome and the decoding device is tRNA. Each amino
acid attaches to a tRNA whose short sequence contains a 3-base anticodon that is
complementary to an mRNA codon. Enzymatic reactions catalyze the dehydration
synthesis (condensation) reactions that link amino acids in peptide bonds in the
order specified by codons in the mRNA.
201 The Genetic Code Dictionary
B. Comments on the Nature and Evolution of Genetic Information
The near-universality of the genetic code from bacteria to humans implies that the
code originated early in evolution. It is probable that portions of the code were in
place even before life began. Once in place however, the genetic code was highly

CMB3e

235

constrained against evolutionary change. The degeneracy of the genetic code
enabled and contributed to this constraint by permitting base many base changes that
do not affect the amino acid encoded in a codon.

236

The near universality of the genetic code and its resistance to change are features of
our genomes that allow us to compare gene and other DNA sequences to establish
evolutionary relationships between organisms (species), groups of organisms (genus,
family, order, etc.) and even individuals within a species.
In addition to constraints imposed by a universal genetic code, some organisms show
codon bias, a recent constraint on which universal codons an organism uses. Codon
bias is seen in organisms preferably use A-T rich codons, or in organisms that favor
codons richer in G and C. Interestingly, codon bias in genes often accompanies
corresponding genomic nucleotide bias. An organism with an AT codon bias may also
have an AT-rich genome (likewise GC-rich codons in GC-rich genomes). You can
recognize genome nucleotide bias in Chargaff’s base ratios!
Finally, we often think of genetic information as genes for proteins. Obvious examples
of non-coding genetic information include the genes for rRNAs and tRNAs, common to
all organisms. The amount of these kinds of informational DNA (i.e., genes for
polypeptides, tRNAs and rRNAs) as a proportion of total DNA can range across
species, although it is higher in eukaryotes prokaryotes. For example, ~88% of the E.
coli circular chromosome encodes polypeptides, while that figure is less ~1.5% for
humans. Some less obvious informative DNA sequences in higher organisms are
transcribed (e.g., introns). Other informative DNA in the genome is never transcribed.
The latter include regulatory DNA sequences, DNA sequences that support
chromosome structure and other DNAs that contribute to development and phenotype.
As for that amount of truly non-informative (useless) DNA in a eukaryotic genome, that
amount is steadily shrinking as we sequence entire genomes, identify novel DNA
sequences and discover novel RNAs (topics covered elsewhere in this text).

III.

Gene and Protein Colinearity and Triplet Codons
Serious efforts to understand how proteins are encoded began after Watson and Crick
used the experimental evidence of Maurice Wilkins and Rosalind Franklin (among
others) to determine the structure of DNA. Most hypotheses about the genetic code
assumed that DNA (i.e., genes) and polypeptides were colinear.

A. Colinearity
For genes and proteins, colinearity just means that the length of a DNA sequence in a
gene is proportional to the length of the polypeptide encoded by the gene. The gene
mapping experiments in E. coli already discussed certainly supported this hypothesis.

CMB3e

237

The concept of colinearity is illustrated below.

Illustration by G. Bergtrom

If the genetic code is collinear with the polypeptides it encodes, then a one-base
codon obviously does not work because such a code would only account for four
amino acids. A two-base genetic code also doesn’t work because it could only
account for 16 (42) of the twenty amino acids found in proteins. However, threenucleotide codons could code for a maximum of 43 or 64 amino acids, more than
enough to encode the 20 amino acids. And of course, a 4-base code also works; it
satisfies the expectation that genes and proteins are collinear, with the’ advantage’
that there would be 256 possible codons to choose from (i.e., 44 possibilities).
B. How is the Genetic Code ‘Read’ to Account for All of An Organisms’ Genes?
George Gamow (a Russian Physicist working at George Washington University) was
the first to propose triplet codons to encode the twenty amino acids, the simplest
hypothesis to account for the colinearity of gene and protein, and for encoding 20
amino acids. One concern that was raised was whether there is enough DNA in an
organism’s genome to fit the all codons it needs to make all of its proteins? Assuming
genomes did not have a lot of extra DNA laying around, how might genetic information
be compressed into short DNA sequences in a way that is consistent with the
colinearity of gene and polypeptide. One idea assumed 44 meaningless and 20
meaningful 3-base codons (one for each amino acid) and 44 meaningless codons,
and that the meaningful codons in a gene (i.e., an mRNA) would be read and
translated in an overlapping manner.

CMB3e

238

A code where codons overlap by one base is shown below.

Illustration by G. Bergtrom

You can figure out how compressed a gene could get with codons that overlapped by
two bases. However, as attractive as an overlapping codon hypothesis was in
achieving genomic economies, it sank of its own weight almost as soon as it was
floated! If you look carefully at the example above, you can see that each succeeding
amino acid would have to start with a specific base. A look back at the table of 64
triplet codons quickly shows that only one of 16 amino acids, those that begin with a C
can follow the first one in the illustration. Based on amino acid sequences
accumulating in the literature, virtually any amino acid could follow another in a
polypeptide. Therefore, overlapping genetic codes are untenable. The genetic code
must be non-overlapping!
Sidney Brenner and Frances Crick performed elegant experiments that directly
demonstrated the non-overlapping genetic code. They showed that bacteria with a
single base deletion in the coding region of a gene failed to make the expected
protein. Likewise, deleting two bases from the gene. On the other hand, bacteria
containing a mutant version of the gene in which three bases were deleted were able
to make the protein. The protein it made was slightly less active than bacteria with
genes with no deletions.

CMB3e

239

The next issue was whether there were only 20 meaningful codons and 44
meaningless ones. If only 20 triplets actually encoded amino acids, how would the
translation machinery recognize the correct 20 codons to translate? What would
prevent the translational machinery from ‘reading the wrong’ triplets, i.e., reading an
mRNA out of phase? If for example, if the translation machinery began reading an
MRNA from the second or third bases of a codon, it would likely encounter a
meaningless 3-base sequence in short order.
One speculation was that the code was punctuated. That is, perhaps there were the
chemical equivalent of commas between the meaningful triplets. The commas would
be of course, additional nucleotides. In such a punctuated code, the translation
machinery would recognize the ‘commas’ and would not translate any meaningless 3base triplet, avoiding out-of-phase translation attempts. Of course, a code with
nucleotide ‘commas’ would increase the amount of DNA needed to specify a
polypeptide by a third!
Then, Crick proposed the Commaless Genetic Code. He divided the 64 triplets into
20 meaningful codons that encoded the amino acids, and 44 meaningless ones that
did not. The result was such that when the 20 meaningful codons are placed in any
order, any of the triplets read in overlap would be among the 44 meaningless codons.
In fact, he could arrange several different sets of 20 and 44 triplets with this property!
Crick had cleverly demonstrated how to read the triplets in correct sequence without
nucleotide ‘commas’.
202 Speculations About a Triplet Code
As we know now, the genetic code is indeed ‘commaless’… but not in the sense that
Crick had envisioned. What’s more, Thanks to the experiments described next, we
know that ribosomes read the correct codons in the right order because they know
exactly where to start!
C. Breaking the Genetic Code
When the genetic code was actually broken, it was found that 61 of the codons specify
amino acids and therefore, that the code is degenerate. Breaking the code began
when Marshall Nirenberg and Heinrich J. Matthaei decoded the first triplet. They
fractionated E. coli and identified which fractions had to be added back together in
order to get polypeptide synthesis in a test tube (in vitro translation).

CMB3e

240

The cell fractionation is summarized below.

Illustration by G. Bergtrom

Check out the original work in the classic paper by Nirenberg MW and Matthaei JH
[(1961) The dependence of cell-free protein synthesis in E. coli upon naturally
occurring or synthetic polyribo-nucleotides. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 47:1588-1602].
The various cell fractions isolated by this protocol were added back together along
with amino acids (one of which was radioactive) and ATP as an energy source. After
a short incubation, Nirenberg and his coworkers looked for the presence of high
molecular weight radioactive proteins as evidence of cell-free protein synthesis.
They found that all four final sub-fractions (1-4 above) must be added together to
make radioactive proteins in the test tube. One of the essential cell fractions
consisted of RNA that had been gently extracted from ribosome (fraction 2 in the
illustration). Reasoning that this RNA might be mRNA, they substituted a synthetic
poly(U) preparation for this fraction in their cell-free protein synthesizing mix,
expecting poly(U) to encode a simple repeating amino acid.

CMB3e

241

They set up 20 reaction tubes, with a different amino acid in each…, and made only
poly-phenylalanine. The experiment is illustrated below.

Illustration by G. Bergtrom

So, the triplet codon UUU means phenylalanine. Other polynucleotides were
synthesized by G. Khorana, and in quick succession, poly(A) and poly(C) were shown
to make poly-lysine and poly-proline in this experimental protocol. Thus AAA
and CCC must encode lysine and proline respectively. With a bit more difficulty and
ingenuity, poly di- and tri-nucleotides were also used in the cell free system to
decipher several additional codons.
203 Deciphering the First Codon
M. W. Nirenberg, H. G. Khorana and R. W. Holley shared the 1968 Nobel Prize in
Physiology or Medicine for their contributions to our understanding of protein
synthesis. Deciphering the rest of the genetic code was based on Crick’s realization
that chemically, amino acids have no attraction for either DNA or RNA (or triplets
thereof). Instead, he predicted the existence of an adaptor molecule that would
contain nucleic acid and amino acid information on the same molecule. Today we
recognize this molecule as tRNA, the genetic decoding device.
Nirenberg and Philip Leder designed the experiment that pretty much broke the rest of
the genetic code. They did this by adding individual amino acids to separate test
tubes containing tRNAs, in effect causing the synthesis of specific aminoacyl-tRNAs.

CMB3e

242

They then mixed their amino acid-bound tRNAs with isolated ribosomes and synthetic
triplets. Since they had already shown that synthetic three-nucleotide fragments
would bind to ribosomes, they hypothesized that triplet-bound ribosomes would in
turn, bind appropriate amino acid-bound tRNAs. The experiment is shown below.

Illustration by G. Bergtrom

Various combinations of tRNA, ribosomes and aminoacyl-tRNAs were placed over a
filter. Nirenberg and Leder knew that aminoacyl-tRNAs alone passed through the filter
and that ribosomes did not. They predicted then, that triplets would associate with the
ribosomes, and further, that this complex would bind the tRNA with the amino acid
encoded by the bound triplet. This 3-part complex would also be retained by the filter,
allowing the identification of the amino acid retained on the filter, and therefore the
triplet code-word that had enabled binding the amino acid to the ribosome.
204 Deciphering all 64 Triplet Codons
After the code was largely deciphered, Robert Holley actually sequenced a yeast
tRNA, and from regions of internal complementarity, predicted the folded structure of
the tRNA. This first successful sequencing of a nucleic acid was possible because the

CMB3e

243

tRNA was short, and contained several modified bases that facilitated the sequencing
chemistry. Holley found the amino acid alanine at one end of the tRNA and he found
one of the anticodons for an alanine codon roughly in the middle of the tRNA
sequence. Holley predicted that this (and other) tRNAs would fold and assume a
stem-loop, or cloverleaf structure with a central anticodon loop. The illustration
below shows this structure for a phenylalanine tRNA along with subsequent computergenerated structures (below right) showing a now familiar “L”-shaped molecule with an
amino acid attachment site at the 3’-end at the top of the molecule, and the
anticodon loop at the other, bottom ‘end’.

205 tRNA Structure and Base Modifications
After a brief overview of translation, we’ll break translation down into its 3 steps and
see how aminoacyl-tRNAs function in the initiation and elongation steps of translation,
as well as the special role of an initiator tRNA.

CMB3e

244

III.

Translation

A. Overview of Translation (Synthesizing Proteins)
Like any polymerization in a cell, translation occurs in three steps: initiation brings a
ribosome, mRNA and an initiator tRNA together to form an initiation complex.
Elongation is the successive addition of amino acids to a growing polypeptide.
Termination is signaled by sequences (one of the stop codons) in the mRNA and
protein termination factors that interrupt elongation and release a finished
polypeptide. The events of translation occur at specific A, P and E sites on the
ribosome (see drawing below).

Illustration by G. Bergtrom

B. Translation – First Steps
1. Making Aminoacyl-tRNAs
Translation is perhaps the most energy-intensive job a cell must do, beginning with
the attachment of amino acids to their tRNAs. The basic amino-acylation reaction
is the same for all amino acids. A specific aminoacyl-tRNA synthase attaches
each tRNA to (charges) an appropriate amino acid.

CMB3e

245

Charging tRNAs requires ATP and proceeds in three steps (shown below).

Illustration by G. Bergtrom

In the first step, ATP and an appropriate amino acid bind to the aminoacyl-tRNA
synthase. ATP is hydrolyzed releasing a pyrophosphate (PPi) and leaving an
enzyme-AMP-amino acid complex. Next, the amino acid is transferred to the
enzyme, releasing the AMP. Finally, the tRNA binds to the enzyme, the amino
acid is transferred to the tRNA and the intact enzyme is regenerated and released.
The charged tRNA is ready to use in translation.
Several studies had already established that polypeptides are synthesized from
their amino (N-) terminal end to their carboxyl (C-) terminal end. When it became
possible to determine the amino acid sequences of polypeptides, it turned out that
around 40% of E. coli proteins had an N-terminal methionine, suggesting that all
proteins began with a methionine. It also turned out that, even though there is only
one codon for methionine, two different tRNAs for methionine could be isolated.
One of the tRNAs was bound to a methionine modified by formylation, called
formylmethionine-tRNAfmet (or fmet-tRNAf for short). The other was methioninetRNAmet (met-tRNAmet for short), charged with an unmodified methionine.

CMB3e

246

Methionine and formylated methionine are shown below.

Illustration by G. Bergtrom

tRNAmet and tRNAf each have an anticodon to AUG, the only codon for
methionine, but have different base sequences encoded by different tRNA genes.
tRNAmet is used to insert methionine in the middle of a polypeptide. tRNAf is the
initiator tRNA, and is only used to start new polypeptides with formylmethionine. In
prokaryotes, methionine on met-tRNAf is formylated at its amino group to make the
fmet-tRNAf. The formylating enzyme that does this does not recognize methionine
on met-tRNAmet.
In E. coli, a formylase enzyme removes the formyl group from all N-terminal formyl
methionines at some point after translation has begun. As we noted, the
methionine itself (and sometimes more N-terminal amino acids) are also removed
from about 60% of E. coli polypeptides. Eukaryotes have inherited both the
initiator tRNAf and the tRNAmet, using only met-tRNAf during initiation. However,
methionine on the eukaryotic initiator met-tRNAf is never formylated in the first
place. What’s more, methionine is absent from virtually all mature eukaryotic
polypeptides.

CMB3e

247

Early in evolution, the need for an initiator tRNA must have ensured a correct
starting point for translation on an mRNA and therefore growth of a polypeptide
from one end to the other, that is, from its N- to its C-terminus. At one time,
formylation of the N-terminal methionine may have served to block accidental
addition of amino acids or other modifications at the N-terminus of a polypeptide.
Today, formylation seems to be a kind of molecular appendix in bacteria. Since
then, evolution (in eukaryotes at least) has selected other features to replace
actual formylation as the protector of the N-terminus of polypeptides.
2. Initiation
Now that we have charged the tRNAs, we can look more closely at the three steps
of translation. Understanding translation initiation began with a molecular
dissection of the components of E. coli cells required for cell-free (in vitro) protein
synthesis, including cell fractionation, protein purification and reconstitution
experiments. Initiation starts with when the Shine-Delgarno sequence forms Hbonds with a complementary sequence in the 16S rRNA bound to 30S ribosomal
subunit. The Shine-Delgarno sequence is a short nucleotide sequence in the 5’
untranslated region (5’-UTR) of the messenger RNA, just upstream of the initiator
AUG codon. This requires the participation of initiation factors IF1 and IF3. In this
event, IF1 and IF3 as well as the mRNA are bound to the 30S ribosomal subunit
(below).

Illustration by G. Bergtrom

Demonstration of the binding of an mRNA to a ribosomal subunit required isolation
and separation of the 30S ribosomal subunit, an RNA fraction of the cell, and the
purification of initiation factor proteins from the bacterial cells. This was
CMB3e

248

followed by reconstitution (adding the separated fractions back together) in the
correct order show that mRNA would only bind to the 30S subunit in the presence
of the two specific initiation factor proteins.
206 Translation Initiation: mRNA Associates with 30S Ribosomal Subunit
Next, with the help of GTP and another initiation factor (IF2), the initiator fmettRNAf recognizes and binds to the AUG start codon found in all mRNAs. Some
call the resulting structure (shown below) the Initiation Complex, which includes
the 30S ribosomal subunit, Ifs 1, 2 and 3, and the fmet-tRNAf.

Illustration by G. Bergtrom

207 Initiation Complex Formation
In the last step of initiation, the large ribosomal subunit binds to this complex. IFs
1, 2 and 3 disassociate from the ribosome and the initiator fmet-tRNAfmet ends up
in the P site of the ribosome.

CMB3e

249

Some prefer to call the structure formed at this point the initiation complex (below).

Illustration by G. Bergtrom

208 Adding the Large Ribosomal Subunit
Initiation can happen multiple times on a single mRNA, forming the polyribosome,
or polysome described in Chapter 1. Each of the complexes formed above will
engage in the elongation of a polypeptide described next.
3. Elongation
Elongation is a sequence of protein factor-mediated condensation reactions and
ribosome movements along an mRNA. As you will see, polypeptide elongation
requires a considerable input of free energy.

CMB3e

250

a) Elongation-1
The first step in elongation is the entry of the next aminoacyl-tRNA (aa2tRNAaa2), which requires the free energy of GTP hydrolysis. The energy is
supplied by the hydrolysis of GTP bound elongation factor 2 (EF2-GTP). The
aa2-tRNAaa2 enters the ribosome based on codon-anticodon interaction at the
A site as shown below.

Illustration by G. Bergtrom

The GDP dissociates from EF2 as aa2-tRNAaa2 binds the anticodon in the A
site. To keep elongation moving along, elongation factor (EF3) rephosphorylates the GDP to GTP, which can re-associate with free EF2.
209 Elongation: Elongation Factors and GTP

CMB3e

251

b) Elongation-2
Peptidyl transferase, a ribozyme component of the ribosome itself, links the
incoming amino acid to a growing chain in a condensation reaction.

Illustration by G. Bergtrom

In this reaction, the fmet is transferred from the initiator tRNAf in the P site to
aa2-tRNAaa2 in the A site, forming a peptide linkage with aa2.
210 Elongation: A Ribozyme Catalyzes Peptide Linkage Formation
c) Elongation 3
Translocase catalyzes GTP hydrolysis as the ribosome moves (translocates)
along the mRNA. After translocation, the next mRNA codon shows up in the A
site of the ribosome and the first tRNA (in this example, tRNAf) ends up on the
E site of the ribosome.

CMB3e

252

The movement of the ribosome along the mRNA is illustrated below.

Illustration by G. Bergtrom

The tRNAf, no longer attached to an amino acid, will exit the E site as the next
(3rd) aa-tRNA enters the empty A site, based on a specific codon-anticodon
interaction (assisted by elongation factors and powered by GTP hydrolysis) to
begin another cycle of elongation. Note that in each cycle of elongation, an
ATP is consumed to attach each amino acid to its tRNA, and two GTPs are
hydrolyzed in the cycle itself. In other words, at the cost of three NTPs, protein
synthesis is the most expensive polymer synthesis reaction in cells!
211 Elongation: Translocase Moves Ribosome Along mRNA
212 Adding the Third Amino Acid
213 Big Translation Energy Costs
As polypeptides elongate, they eventually emerge from a groove in the large
ribosomal subunit. As noted, a formylase enzyme in E. coli cytoplasm removes
the formyl group from the exposed initiation fmet from all growing polypeptides.
While about 40% of E. coli polypeptides still begin with methionine, specific
proteases catalyze the hydrolytic removal of the amino-terminal methionine
CMB3e

253

(and sometimes even more amino acids) from the other 60% of polypeptides.
The removal of the formyl group and one or more N-terminal amino acids from
new polypeptides are examples of post-translational processing.
214 The Fates of fMet and Met; Cases of Post-Translational Processing
4. Termination
Translation of an mRNA by a ribosome ends when translocation exposes one of
the three stop codons in the A site of the ribosome. Stop codons are not situated
some distance from the 3’ end of an mRNA. The region between a stop codon to
the end of the mRNA is called the 3’ untranslated region of the messenger RNA
(3’UTR).
Since there is no aminoacyl-tRNA with an anticodon to the stop codons (UAA,
UAG or UGA), the ribosome actually stalls and the translation slow-down is just
long enough for a protein termination factor to enter the A site. This interaction
causes release of the new polypeptide and the disassembly of the ribosomal
subunits from the mRNA. The process requires energy from yet another GTP
hydrolysis. After dissociation, ribosomal subunits can be reassembled with an
mRNA for another round of protein synthesis. Translation termination is illustrated
below.

We have seen some examples of post-translational processing (removal of formyl groups
in E. coli, removal of the N-terminal methionine from most polypeptides, etc.) Most
proteins, especially in eukaryotes, undergo one or more additional steps of posttranslational processing before becoming biologically active. We will see examples in
upcoming chapters.
Let’s conclude this chapter with a “we thought we knew everything” moment! A recent
study reports that ribosomes can sometimes re-initiate translation in the 3’ UTR of an
mRNA using AUG codons upstream of the normal start codon of the mRNA. There is
evidence that the resulting short polypeptides may be functional! Click here to read

Introduction

Cells regulate their metabolism in several ways. We have already that allosterically
regulated enzymes monitor the cellular levels of metabolites. Recall that glycolytic
intermediates rise and fall in cells based on cellular energy needs, binding to or
dissociating from allosteric sites. Allosteric enzymes respond to interaction with
allosteric effectors with an increase or decrease in catalytic activity.
Cells can also control absolute levels of enzymes and other proteins by turning genes on
and off, typically by controlling transcription. Transcription regulation usually starts with
extracellular environmental signaling. The signals are chemicals in the in the air, in the
water, or in the case of multicellular organisms, in blood, lymph or other extracellular
fluids. Bacterial and protist genes often respond to environmental toxins or fluctuating
nutrient levels. Familiar signal molecules in higher organisms include hormones
released at the appropriate time in a sequential developmental program of gene
expression, or in response to nutrient levels in body fluids.
Some signal molecules get into cells binding to specific intracellular receptors to
convey their instructions. Others bind to cell surface receptors that transduce their
‘information’ into intracellular molecular signals. When signaling leads to gene regulation,
responding cells ultimately produce transcription factors. These in turn recognize and
bind to specific regulatory DNA sequences associated with the genes that they control.
DNA sequences that bind transcription factors are relatively short. They can lie proximal
(close) to the transcription start site of a gene, and/or in the case of eukaryotes, distal to
(far from) it. We will see that binding some regulatory DNA sequences are enhancers,
turning on or increasing gene transcription. Others are silencers, down-regulating, or
suppressing transcription of a gene. Finally, DNA regulatory sequences are hidden
behind a thicket of chromatin proteins in eukaryotes. When patterns of gene expression
in cells change during development, chromatin is re-organized, cells differentiate, and
new tissues and organs form. To this end, new patterns of gene expression and
chromatin configuration in a cell must be remembered in its descendants.

CMB3e

256

In this chapter, we look at the path from cell recognition of a signal molecule to the
interaction of regulatory proteins with DNA in both prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells. We
also consider how eukaryotic cells remember instructions that alter chromatin
configuration and patterns of gene expression, topics in the field of epigenetics.

II.

Gene Regulation in Prokaryotes

Many prokaryotic genes are organized in operons, linked genes transcribed into a single
mRNA encoding two or more proteins. Operons usually encode proteins with related
functions. Regulating the activity of an operon (rather than multiple single genes
encoding single proteins) allows better coordination of the synthesis of several proteins at
once. In E. coli, the regulated lac operon encodes three enzymes involved in the
metabolism of lactose (an alternative nutrient to glucose). Regulation of an operon (or of
a single gene for that matter) can be by repression or by induction. When a small
metabolite in a cell binds to a regulatory repressor or inducer protein, the protein
undergoes an allosteric change that allows it to bind to a regulatory DNA sequence…, or
to un-bind from the DNA.

CMB3e

257

We will see examples of such regulation in the lac and trp operons. Lac operon gene
regulation is an example of gene repression as well as induction. Trp (tryptophan)
operon regulation is by gene repression. In both the operons, changes in levels of
intracellular metabolites reflect the metabolic status of the cell and elicit appropriate
changes in gene transcription. We will look at the regulation of both operons.

216 Overview of Prokaryotic Gene Regulation
The mRNA transcribed from the lac operon is simultaneously translated into those three
enzymes, as shown below.

Illustration by G. Bergtrom

A. Mechanisms of Control of the lac Operon
In the animal digestive tract (including ours), genes of the E. coli lac operon regulate
the use of lactose as an alternative nutrient to glucose. Think cheese instead of
chocolate! The operon consists of lacZ, lacY, and lacA genes that were called
structural genes. By definition, structural genes encode proteins that participate in
cell structure and metabolic function. As already noted, the lac operon is transcribed
into an mRNA encoding the Z, Y and A proteins.

CMB3e

258

Let’s take a closer look at the structure of the lac operon and the function of the Y, Z
and A proteins (below).

Illustration by G. Bergtrom

The lacZ gene encodes β-galactosidase, the enzyme that breaks lactose (a
disaccharide) into galactose and glucose. The lacY gene encodes lactose permease,
a membrane protein that facilitates lactose entry into the cells. The role
of the lacA gene (a transacetylase) in lactose energy metabolism is not well
understood. The I gene to the left of the lac Z gene is a regulatory gene (to
distinguish it from structural genes). Regulatory genes encode proteins that interact
with regulatory DNA sequences associated with a gene to control transcription. The
operator sequence separating the I and Z genes is a transcription regulatory DNA
sequence.
The E. coli lac operon is usually silent (repressed) because these cells prefer glucose
as an energy and carbon source. In the presence of sufficient glucose, a repressor
protein (the I gene product) is bound to the operator, blocking transcription of the lac
operon. Even if lactose is available, cells will not be use it as an alternative energy
and carbon source when glucose levels adequate. However, when glucose levels
drop, the lac operon is active and the three enzyme products are translated. We will
see how limiting glucose levels induce maximal lac operon transcription by both
derepression and direct induction, leading to maximal transcription of the lac genes
only when necessary (i.e., in the presence of lactose and absence of glucose). Let’s
look at some of the classic experiments that led to our understanding of E. coli gene
regulation in general, and of the lac operon in particular.
In the late 1950s and early 1960s, Francois Jacob and Jacques Monod were studying
the use of different sugars as carbon sources by E. coli. They knew that wild type E.
coli would not make the -galactosidase, -galactoside permease or -galactoside
transacetylase proteins when grown on glucose. Of course, they also knew that the
CMB3e

259

cells would switch to lactose for growth and reproduction if they were deprived of
glucose! They then searched for and isolated different E. coli mutants that could not
grow on lactose, even when there was no glucose in the growth medium. Here are
some of the mutants they studied:
1. One mutant failed to make active -galactosidase enzyme but made permease.
2. One mutant failed to make active permease but made normal amounts of galactosidase.
3. Another mutant failed to make transacetylase…, but could still metabolize lactose
in the absence of glucose. Hence the uncertainty of its role in lactose metabolism.
4. Curiously, one mutant strain failed to make any of the three enzymes!
Since double mutants are very rare and triple mutants even rarer, Jacob and Monod
inferred that the activation of all three genes in the presence of lactose were controlled
together in some way. In fact, it was this discovery that defined the operon as a set of
genes transcribed as a single mRNA, whose expression could therefore be effectively
coordinated. They later characterized the repressor protein produced by the lacI
gene. Jacob, Monod and Andre Lwoff shared the Nobel Prize in Medicine in 1965 for
their work on bacterial gene regulation. We now know that negative and positive
regulation of the lac operon (described below) depend on two regulatory proteins that
together, control the rate of lactose metabolism.
1. Negative Regulation of the lac Operon by Lactose
Refer to the illustration below to identify the players in lac operon derepression.

CMB3e

260

The repressor protein product of the I gene is always made and present in E. coli
cells. I gene expression is not regulated! In the absence of lactose in the growth
medium, the repressor protein binds tightly to the operator DNA. While RNA
polymerase is bound to the promoter and ready to transcribe the operon, the
presence of the repressor bound to the operator sequence close to the Z gene
physically blocks its forward movement. Under these conditions, little or no
transcript is made. If cells are grown in the presence of lactose, the lactose
entering the cells is converted to allolactose. Allolactose binds to the repressor
sitting on the operator DNA to form a 2-part complex, as shown below.

polymerase can transcribe the lac operon genes as illustrated below.

261

2. Positive Regulation of the Lac Operon; Induction by Catabolite Activation
The second control mechanism regulating lac operon expression is mediated by
CAP (cAMP-bound catabolite activator protein or cAMP receptor protein). When
glucose is available, cellular levels of cAMP are low in the cells and CAP is
in an inactive conformation. On the other hand, if glucose levels are low, cAMP
levels rise and bind to the CAP, activating it. If lactose levels are also low, the
cAMP-bound CAP will have no effect. If lactose is present and glucose levels are
low, then allolactose binds the lac repressor causing it to dissociate from the
operator region. Under these conditions, the cAMP-bound CAP can bind to the
operator in lieu of the repressor protein. In this case, rather than blocking the RNA
polymerase, the activated Camp-bound CAP induces even more efficient lac
operon transcription. The result is synthesis of higher levels of lac enzymes that
facilitate efficient cellular use of lactose as an alternative to glucose as an energy
source. Maximal activation of the lac operon in high lactose and low glucose is
shown below.

Illustration by G. Bergtrom

217 Regulation of the lac Operon

CMB3e

262

cAMP-bound CAP is an inducer of transcription. It does this by forcing the DNA in
the promoter-operator region to bend. And since bending the double helix loosens
H-bonds, it becomes easier for RNA polymerase to find and bind the promoter on
the DNA strand to be transcribed…, and for transcription to begin. cAMP-CAPinduced bending of DNA is illustrated below.

Illustration by G. Bergtrom

3. Lac Operon Regulation by Inducer Exclusion and Multiple Operators
In recent years, additional layers of lac operon regulation have been uncovered. In
one case, the ability of lac permease to transport lactose across the cell membrane
is regulated. In another, additional operator sequences have been discovered to
interact with a multimeric repressor to control lac gene expression.
a) Regulation of Lactose use by Inducer Exclusion
When glucose levels are high (even in the presence of lactose), phosphate is
consumed to phosphorylate glycolytic intermediates, keeping cytoplasmic
phosphate levels low. Under these conditions, unphosphorylated EIIAGlc binds to
the lactose permease enzyme in the cell membrane, preventing it from bringing
lactose into the cell.

CMB3e

263

The role of phosphorylated and unphosphorylated EIIAGlc in regulating the lac
operon are shown below.

Illustration by
G. Bergtrom

High glucose levels block lactose entry into the cells, effectively preventing
allolactose formation and the derepression of the lac operon. Inducer exclusion is
thus a logical way for the cells to handle an abundance of glucose, whether or not
lactose is present. On the other hand, if glucose levels are low in the growth
medium, phosphate concentrations in the cells rise sufficiently for a specific kinase
to phosphorylate the EIIAGlc. Phosphorylated EIIAGlc then undergoes an allosteric
change and dissociates from the lactose permease, making it active so that more
lactose can enter the cell. In other words, the inducer is not “excluded” under
these conditions!
The kinase that phosphorylates EIIAGlc is part of a phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP)dependent phosphotransferase system (PTS) cascade. When extracellular
glucose levels are low, the cell activates the PTS system in an effort to bring
whatever glucose is around into the cell. But the last enzyme in the PTS
phosphorylation cascade is the kinase that phosphorylates EIIAGlc.
Phosphorylated EIIAGlc dissociates from the lactose permease, re-activating it,
bringing available lactose into the cell from the medium.

CMB3e

264

b) Repressor Protein Structure and Additional Operator Sequences
The lac repressor is a tetramer of identical subunits (below).

CC-BY-SA; From: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lac_repressor

Each subunit contains a helix-turn-helix motif capable of binding to DNA.
However, the operator DNA sequence downstream of the promoter in the operon
consists of a pair of inverted repeats spaced apart in such a way that they can only
interact two of the repressor subunits, leaving the function of the other two subunits
unknown… that is, until recently!
Two more operator regions were recently characterized in the lac operon. One,
called O2, is within the lac z gene itself and the other, called O3, lies near the end
of, but within the lac I gene. Apart from their unusual location within actual

CMB3e

265

genes, these operators, which interact with the remaining two repressor subunits,
went undetected at first because mutations in the O2 or the O3 region individually
do not contribute substantially to the effect of lactose in derepressing the lac
operon. Only mutating both regions at the same time results in a substantial
reduction in binding of the repressor to the operon.
B. Mechanism of Control of the Tryptophan Operon
If ample tryptophan (trp) is available, the tryptophan synthesis pathway can be
inhibited in two ways. First, recall how feedback inhibition by excess trp can
allosterically inhibit the trp synthesis pathway. A rapid response occurs when
tryptophan is present in excess, resulting in rapid feedback inhibition by blocking the
first of five enzymes in the trp synthesis pathway. The trp operon encodes
polypeptides that make up two of these enzymes.

Enzyme 1 is a multimeric protein, made from polypeptides encoded by the trp5 and
trp4 genes. The trp1 and trp2 gene products make up Enzyme 3. If cellular
tryptophan levels drop because the amino acid is rapidly consumed (e.g., due to
demands for proteins during rapid growth), E. coli cells will continue to synthesize the
amino acid, as illustrated below.

Illustration by G. Bergtrom

CMB3e

266

On the other hand, if tryptophan consumption slows down, tryptophan accumulates in
the cytoplasm. Excess tryptophan will bind to the trp repressor. The trp-bound
repressor then binds to the trp operator, blocking RNA polymerase from transcribing
the operon. The repression of the trp operon by trp is shown below.

Illustration by G. Bergtrom

In this scenario, tryptophan is a co-repressor. The function of a co-repressor is to
bind to a repressor protein and change its conformation so that it can bind to the
operator.
219 Repression of the Tryptophan (TRP) Operon

III. The Problem with Unregulated (Housekeeping) Genes in All Cells
Before we turn our attention to the regulation of gene expression in eukaryotes, consider
for a moment the expression of constitutive, or housekeeping, genes that are always
active. The requirement that some genes are always “on” raises questions about cellular
priorities of gene expression. Constitutive gene products are sets of many polypeptides
that form large macromolecular complexes in cells, or enzyme sets that participate in vital
biochemical pathways. How do cells maintain such polypeptides in stoichiometrically
reasonable amounts? Or, can their levels rise or fall transiently without much effect?
Recent studies suggest that transcription of housekeeping genes is in fact, not at all
coordinated! Nevertheless, we also saw that the efficiency of glycolysis relied on the
evolution of allosteric regulatory mechanisms to control the activities of glycolytic
enzymes rather than their transcription. While this takes care some element of metabolic
control, a problem remains. Recall that protein synthesis is energy-intensive, each
peptide linkage costing three NTPs (not to mention the waste of an additional NTP per
phosphodiester linkage made in transcription of an mRNA!). The overproduction of

CMB3e

267

proteins under any circumstances would seem to be a waste of energy. We may not
know just how expensive it is to express housekeeping genes. But whatever they are,
these energy expenses are the cost of evolving complex structures and biochemical
pathways vital to their everyday function and survival. Now back to our focus on
regulated gene expression… in eukaryotes.

IV. Gene Regulation in Eukaryotes
A. The Difference between Eukaryotic and Prokaryotic Gene Regulation
Let’s recall an experiment described earlier and illustrated below.

Illustration by G. Bergtrom

Results of this experiment provided the evidence that even very different cells of an
organism contain the same genes. In fact, in any multicellular eukaryotic organism,
every cell contains the same DNA (genes). Therefore, the different cell types in an
organism differ not in which genes they contain, but which sets of genes they express!
Looked at another way, cells differentiate when they turn on new genes and turn off
old ones. Thus, gene regulation produces different sets of gene products during
differentiation, leading to cells that look and function differently in the organism.
220 An Experiment: All of an Organism's Cells Have the Same Genome
CMB3e

268

Compared to prokaryotes, many steps in eukaryotes lie between transcription of an
mRNA and the accumulation of a polypeptide end product. Eleven of these steps are
shown in the pathway from gene to protein below.

CC-BY-SA 3.0; Adapted From https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromatin

Theoretically, cells could turn on, turn off, speed up or slow down any of the steps in
this pathway, changing the steady state concentration of a polypeptide in the cells.
While regulation of any of these steps is possible, the expression of a single gene is
typically controlled at only one or a few steps. A common form of gene regulation is at
the level of transcription initiation, similar to transcriptional control in bacteria, in
principle if not in detail.

221 Many Options for Regulating Eukaryotic Genes

CMB3e

269

B. Complexities of Eukaryotic Gene Regulation
Gene regulation in eukaryotes is more complex than in prokaryotes. This is in part
because their genomes are larger and because they encode more genes. For
example, the E. coli genome houses about 5,000 genes, compared to around 25,000
genes in humans. Furthermore, eukaryotes can produce even more than 25,000
proteins by alternative splicing of mRNAs and in at least a few cases, by initiating
transcription from alternative start sites in the same gene. And of course, the activity
of many more genes must be coordinated without the benefit of multigene operons!
Finally, eukaryotic gene regulation is made more complicated because all nuclear
DNA is wrapped in protein in the form of chromatin.
All organisms control gene activity with transcription factors that bind to specific
DNA sequences (cis regulatory elements). In eukaryotes, these elements can be
proximal to (near) the promoter of a gene, or distal to (quite far from) the gene they
regulate. A eukaryotic map showing the components of a typical gene and its
associated cis-acting regulatory elements is shown below.
.

Illustration by G. Bergtrom

Enhancers are typical distal cis elements that recognize and bind transcription factors
to increase the rate of transcription of a gene. Oddly enough, these short DNA
elements can be in the 5’ or 3’ non-translated region of the gene, or even within
introns, and can lie thousands of base pairs away from the genes they control. Note
that enhancer elements are even in introns can also be very far from the start-site of
transcription of a gene.

CMB3e

270

Upstream regulatory regions of eukaryotic genes (to the left of a gene promoter as
shown above) often have distal binding sites for more than a few transcription factors,
some with positive (enhancing) and others with negative (silencing) effects. Of
course, which of these DNA regions are active in controlling a gene depends on which
transcription factor(s) are present in the nucleus. Sets of positive regulators will work
together to coordinate and maximize gene expression when needed, and sets of
negative regulators will bind negative regulatory elements to silence a gene.
222 Transcription Factors Bind DNA Near and Far
We saw that in eukaryotes, the initiation of transcription involves many transcription
factors and RNA polymerase II acting at a gene promoter to form a transcription preinitiation complex. TFIID, or TATA binding protein is one of the first factors to
bend, causing the DNA in the promoter region to bend, much like the CAP protein in
bacteria. TFIID also recruits other transcription factors to the promoter. As in
bacteria, bending the DNA loosens H-bonds between bases, facilitating unwinding the
double helix near the gene. Bending eukaryotic DNA also brings distal regulatory
proteins bound to enhancer sequences far from the promoter together with the
proteins bound to more proximal regulatory elements, as shown in the drawing below.

CMB3e

271

Nucleotide methyation sites may facilitate regulatory protein-enhancer binding. When
such regulatory proteins, here called activators (i.e., of transcription), bind to their
enhancers, they acquire an affinity for protein cofactors that enable recognition and
binding to other proteins in the transcription initiation complex. This attraction
stabilizes the bend in the DNA that then makes it easier for RNA polymerase II to
initiate transcription.
223 Assembling a Eukaryotic Transcription Initiation Complex
It is worth reminding ourselves that it is shape and allosteric change that allow DNAprotein interactions (in fact, any interactions of macromolecules). The lac repressor
we saw earlier is a transcription factor with helix-turn-helix DNA binding motifs. This
motif and two others (zinc finger, and leucine zipper) characterize DNA binding
proteins are illustrated below.

DNA-binding motifs in each regulatory protein shown here bind one or more regulatory
elements ‘visible’ to the transcription factor in the major groove of the double helix.
224 Transcription Factor Domains/Motifs Bind Specific DNA Sequences
We will look next at some common ways in which eukaryotic cells are signaled to turn
genes on or off, or to increase or decrease their rates of transcription. As we
describe these models, remember that eukaryotic cells regulate gene expression in
response to changes in extracellular environments. These can be unscheduled,
unpredictable changes in blood or extracellular fluid composition (ions, small
metabolites), or dictated by changes in a long-term genetic program of differentiation
and development. Changes in gene expression even obey circadian (daily) rhythms,
the ticking of a clock. In eukaryotes, changes in gene expression, expected or not,
are usually mediated by the timely release of chemical signals from specialized cells
(e.g., hormones, cytokines, growth factors, etc.). We will focus on some betterunderstood models of gene regulation by these chemical signals.
C. Regulation of Gene Expression by Hormones that enter Cells and Those That
Don’t
Gene-regulatory (cis) elements in DNA and the transcription factors that bind to them
have co-evolved. But not only that! Eukaryotic organisms have evolved complete
pathways that respond to environmental or programmed developmental cues and lead
to an appropriate cellular response. Chemicals that regulate genes in prokaryotes are
not usually signals communicated by other cells. In eukaryotes, chemicals released
by some cells signal other cells to respond, thus coordinating the activity of the whole
organism. Hormones released by cells in endocrine glands are well-understood signal
molecules; hormones affect target cells elsewhere in the body.
225 Chemicals That Control Gene Expression
1. How Steroid Hormones Regulate Transcription
Steroid hormones cross the cell membranes to have their effects. Common steroid
hormones include testosterone, estrogens, progesterone, glucocorticoids and
mineral corticoids. Once in target cell, such hormones bind to a steroid hormone
receptor protein to form a steroid hormone-receptor complex. The receptor
may be in the cytoplasm or in the nucleus, but in the end, the hormone-receptor
complex must bind to DNA regulatory elements of a gene to either enhance or
silence transcription. Therefore, a steroid hormone must cross the plasma
membrane, and may also need to cross the nuclear envelope.
CMB3e

273

Follow the binding of a steroid hormone to a cytoplasmic receptor below.

Here the hormone (the triangle) enters the cell. An allosteric change in the
receptor releases a protein subunit called Hsp90 (the black rectangle in the
illustration). The remaining hormone-bound receptor enters the nucleus.
The fascinating thing about Hsp90 is that it was first discovered in cells subjected
to heat stress. When the temperature gets high enough, cells shut down most
transcription and instead transcribe Hsp90 and/or other special heat shock genes.
The resulting heat shock proteins seem to protect the cells against metabolic
damage until temperatures return to normal. Since most cells never experience
such high temperatures, the evolutionary significance of this protective mechanism
is unclear. As we now know, heat shock proteins have critical cellular functions, in
this case blocking the DNA-binding site of a hormone receptor until a specific
steroid hormone binds to it.
Back to hormone action! No longer associated with the Hsp90 protein, the
receptor bound to its hormone cofactor binds to a cis-acting transcription control
element in the DNA, turning transcription of a gene on or off. The hormone

CMB3e

274

receptors for some steroid hormones are already in the nucleus of the cell, so the
hormone must cross not only the plasma membrane, but also the nuclear envelope
in order to access the receptor.
As for steroid hormone functions, we already saw that glucocorticoids turn on the
genes of gluconeogenesis. Steroid hormones also control sexual development
and reproductive cycling in females, salt and mineral homeostasis in the blood,
metamorphosis in arthropods, etc., all by regulating gene expression.
226 Steroid Hormones Regulate Gene Transcription
2. How Protein Hormones Regulate Transcription
Protein hormones are of course large and soluble, with highly charged surfaces.
Other hormones might be relatively small (e.g., adrenalin), but are charged. Large
or highly charged signal molecules cannot get across the phospholipid barrier of
the plasma membrane. To have any effect at all, they must bind to receptors on
the surface of cells. These receptors are typically membrane glycoproteins.
The information (signals) carried by protein hormones must be conveyed into the
cell indirectly, by a process called signal transduction. There are two well-known
pathways of signal transduction, each of which involves activating pathways of
protein phosphorylation in cytoplasm. The phosphorylation cascade that results
activates a transcription factor that binds to regulatory DNA, turning a gene on or
off.
Binding of a hormone to a cell surface receptor leads to an allosteric change in the
receptor. This in turn activates other proteins either in the plasma membrane or in
the cytoplasm, leading to the synthesis of a cytoplasmic second messenger. The
second messenger typically binds to a protein kinase in the cytoplasm, launching a
series of protein phosphorylations, or a phosphorylation cascade. The last in the
series of proteins to be phosphorylated is an activated transcription factor that will
bind to a cis-regulatory DNA sequence.
cAMP was the first second messenger metabolite to be discovered. It mediates
many hormonal responses, controlling both gene activity and enzyme activity.
cAMP forms when the hormone-receptor in the membrane binds to and activates a
membrane-bound adenylate cyclase enzyme. The cAMP produced then binds to a
protein kinase, the first of several in a phosphorylation cascade.
Signal transduction mediated by cAMP is summarized in the illustration below.

CMB3e

275

Illustration by G. Bergtrom

A different kind of signal transduction involves a hormone receptor that is itself the
protein kinase. The role of enzyme-linked hormone receptors in signal
transduction is summarized below.

Illustration by G. Bergtrom

CMB3e

276

Binding of the signal protein (e.g. hormone) to the enzyme-linked receptor causes
an allosteric change that activates the receptor kinase, starting phosphorylation
cascade resulting in an active transcription factor. We look at signal

transduction in more detail in another chapter.
227 Signal Transduction Can Lead to Gene Regulation

Consider again the illustration of the different levels of chromatin structure (below).

Transcription factors bind specific DNA sequences by detecting them through the
grooves (mainly the major groove) in the double helix. The drawing above reminds us
however, that unlike the nearly naked DNA of bacteria, eukaryotic (nuclear) DNA is
coated with proteins that, in aggregate are by mass, greater than the mass of DNA
that they cover. The protein-DNA complex of the genome is of course, chromatin.
Again, as a reminder, DNA coated with histone proteins forms the 9 nm diameter
beads-on-a-string structure in which the beads are the nucleosomes. The
association of specific non-histone proteins causes the nucleosomes to fold over on
themselves to form the 30 nm solenoid. As we saw earlier, it is possible to
selectively extract chromatin. Take a second look at the results of typical extractions
of chromatin from isolated nuclei below.

Further accretion of non-histone proteins leads to more folding and the formation of
euchromatin and heterochromatin characteristic of non-dividing cells. In dividing
cells, the chromatin further condenses to form the chromosomes that separate during
either mitosis or meiosis.
CMB3e

278

Recall that biochemical analysis of the 10 nm filament extract revealed that the DNA
wraps around histone protein octamers, the nucleosomes or beads in this beads-on-astring structure. Histone proteins are highly conserved in the eukaryotic evolution
(they are not found in prokaryotes). They are also very basic (many lysine and
arginine residues) and therefore very positively charged. This explains why they are
able to arrange themselves uniformly along DNA, binding to the negatively charged
phosphodiester backbone of DNA in the double helix.
Since the DNA in euchromatin is less tightly packed than it is in heterochromatin,
perhaps active genes are to be found in euchromatin and not in heterochromatin.
Experiments in which total nuclear chromatin extracts were isolated and treated with
the enzyme deoxyribonuclease (DNAse) revealed that the DNA in active genes was
degraded more rapidly than non-transcribed DNA. More detail on these experiments
can be found in the two links below.
228 Question: Is Euchromatic DNA Transcribed?
229 Experiment and Answer: Euchromatin is Transcribed
The results of such experiments are consistent with the suggestion that active genes
are more accessible to DNAse because they are in less coiled, or less condensed
chromatin. DNA in more condensed chromatin is surrounded by more proteins, and
thus is less accessible to, and protected from DNAse attack. When packed up in
chromosomes during mitosis or meiosis, all genes are largely inactive.
Regulating gene transcription must occur in non-dividing cells or during the interphase
of cells, where changing the shape of chromatin (chromatin remodeling) in order to
silence some and activate other genes is possible. Changing chromatin conformation
involves chemical modification of chromatin proteins and DNA. For example,
chromatin can be modified by histone acetylation, de-acetylation, methylation and
phosphorylation, reactions catalyzed by histone acetyltransferases (HAT enzymes),
de-acetylases, methyl transferases and kinases, respectively. For example,
acetylation of lysines near the amino end of histones H2B and H4 tends to unwind
nucleosomes and open the underlying DNA for transcription. De-acetylation then,
promotes condensation of the chromatin in the affected regions of DNA. Likewise,
methylation of lysines or arginines (the basic amino acids that characterize histones!)
of H3 and H4 can open DNA for transcription, while demethylation has the opposite
effect. In one case, di-methylation of a lysine in H3 can suppress transcription. These
chemical modifications affect recruitment of other proteins that alter chromatin
conformation and ultimately activate or block transcription.

Nucleosomes themselves can be moved, slid and otherwise repositioned by
complexes that hydrolyze ATP for energy to accomplish the physical shifts. Some
cancers are associated with mutations in genes for proteins involved in chromatin
remodeling. This is no doubt, because failures of normal remodeling could adversely
affect normal cell cycling and normal replication. In fact, a single, specific pattern of
methylation may mark DNA in multiple cancer types (check out Five Cancers with the
Same Genomic Signature - Implications).
E. Regulating all the Genes on a Chromosome at Once
Recall that X chromosomes in human female somatic cells is inactivated, visible in the
nucleus as a Barr body. One of the two X chromosomes in female fruit flies is also
inactivates. However, both males and females of Drosophila (presumably also us!)
require X chromosome gene expression during embryogenesis. Given the difference
in X chromosome gene dosage between males and females, do males get by with
fewer X chromosome gene products than females?
Experiments looking at the expression of X chromosome gene in male and female
flies revealed similar levels of gene products. It turns out that the activity of a nuclear
body called HLB (Histone Locus Body) is required for increase in X chromosome
gene transcription. A protein, called CLAMP (Chromatin-Linked Adaptor for Malespecific lethal (MSL) Protein), was shown to bind to GAGA nucleotide repeats lying
between the genes for histones 3 and 4. As there are about 100 repeats of the fivegene histone locus on X chromosomes, and thus about 100 repeats of the GAGA
repeats. Therefore, many CLAMP proteins bind to the HLBs, where they recruit many

CMB3e

280

MSL proteins. The MSL protein complexes that form then globally increase male X
chromosome gene expression, compensating for the lower X gene dosage in males.
Read the original research at Increasing the Gene Expression of an Entire X
Chromosome (L.E. Reider et al. (2018) Genes & Development 31:1-15). And finally,
there is emerging evidence that the HLB action may also be involved in inactivation of
an entire female X chromosome later in embryogenesis in females!

Epigenetics

Aristotle thought that an embryo emerged from an amorphous mass, a “less fully
concocted seed with a nutritive soul and all bodily parts”. The much later development of
the microscope led to more detailed (if inaccurate) descriptions of embryonic
development. In 1677, no less a luminary than Anton von Leeuwenhoek, looking at a
human sperm with his microscope, thought he saw a miniature human inside! The tiny
human, or homunculus, became the epitome of preformation theory.
William Harvey, also in the 17th century, described changes in morphology in the
developing embryos of chickens (and other animals). Harvey coined the term epigenesis
to counter the notion that any tiny adult structures in eggs or sperm simply grew bigger
during embryonic gestation. Meanwhile, other experiments were leading embryologists to
the conclusion that the physical and chemical environment of an embryo strongly affected
development. Thus temperature, pH, and in the case of chicken eggs, position of
incubation, affect embryonic development. In a series of very elegant experiments
reported in 1924, Hans Speeman reported that cells associated with differentiation of one
region of an embryo could be transplanted to a different part of the same embryo, or to
another embryo entirely, where it would induce new tissue development. He won the
1935 Nobel Prize in Physiology and Medicine for his discovery of embryonic organizers
that induced morphogenesis.
Other embryologists (including Conrad Waddington) demonstrated that cells killed by
freezing or boiling still induced morphogenesis after being placed on an embryo. Thus,
actual chemicals influence embryogenesis. The fact that differences in physical or
chemical environment could affect embryonic development led many to conclude that
environment played the dominant role and that genes played only a minor one in an
organism’s ultimate phenotype. Unlike most of his fellow embryologists, Waddington
believed in a more equitable role of genes and environment in determining phenotype.
Adapting the term epigenesis, he coined the term epigenetics to describe the impact of
environment on embryonic development (1942, The Epigenotype. Endeavour. 1: 18–20).
At the time, the concept of epigenetics led to a nature vs. nurture controversy. We now
understand that differences in environmental influence can cause individuals with the
same genes (genotype) to vary in appearance (phenotype). A modern version of the

CMB3e

281

nature vs. nurture argument has more to do with complex traits, for example how much
do genetics vs. environment influence intelligence, psychology and behavior. There is
much to-do and little evidence to resolve these questions…, and likely too many factors
affecting these traits to separate them experimentally.
These days, the field of epigenetics looks closely at protein interactions in eukaryotes
affecting gene expression. These interactions change the structure NOT of genes (or
DNA), but of the proteins (and other molecules) that affect how DNA and genes are used.
As we have seen, the control of transcription involves transcription factors that recognize
and bind to regulatory sequences in DNA such as enhancers or silencers. These proteinDNA interactions often require selective structural changes in the conformation of the
chromatin surrounding genes. These changes can be profound and stable, and they are
not easily undone.
An example of epigenetics is inheritance of chromatin protein alterations that accompany
gene expression changes in development. Given an appropriate signal, say a hormone
at the right time, a few cells respond with chromatin rearrangements and the expression
of a new set of genes. The new pattern of gene expression defines a cell that has
differentiated. Hundreds, even thousands of such changes accompany progress from
fertilized egg to fully mature eukaryotic organism. Every one of these changes in a cell is
passed on to future generations of cells by mitosis, accounting for different tissues and
organs in the organism. Hence, the many different epigenomes representing our
differentiated cells are heritable.
To sum up, epigenetics is the study of when and how undifferentiated cells (embryonic
and later, adult stem cells) acquire their epigenetic characteristics and then pass on their
epigenetic information to progeny cells. As we’ll see shortly, epigenetic inheritance is not
limited to somatic cells, but can span generations! First, let’s look at this brief history of
our changing understanding of evolution.
Jean-Baptiste Lamarck proposed (for instance) that when a giraffe’s neck got longer so
that it could reach food higher up in trees, that character would be inherited by the next
giraffe generation. According to Lamarck, evolution was purposeful, with the goal of
improvement.
Later, Darwin published his ideas about evolution by natural selection, where nature
selects from pre-existing traits in individuals (the raw material of evolution). The individual
that just randomly happens to have a useful trait then has a survival (and reproductive)
edge in an altered environment.

CMB3e

282

Later still, the rediscovery of Mendel’s genetic experiments, it became increasingly clear
that it is an organism’s genes that are inherited, are passed down the generations, and
are the basis of an organism’s traits. By the start of the 20th century, Lamarck’s notion of
purposefully acquired characters was discarded.
Epigenetic inheritance implies an epigenetic blueprint in addition to our DNA blueprint.
This means that, in addition to passing on the genes of a male and female parent,
epigenomic characteristics (which genes are expressed and when) are also passed to the
next generation. Waddington suspected as much early on, calling the phenomenon
genetic assimilation, and once again created controversy! Does genetic assimilation
make Lamarck right after all? Prominent developmental biologists accused Waddington
of promoting purposeful evolution. Waddington and others denied the accusation, trying
to explain how epigenetic information might be heritable, without leading to purposeful
evolution.
Is there in fact, an epigenetic code? Data from the small Swedish town of Överkalix led to
renewed interest in epigenetic phenomena. Consider the meticulous harvest, birth,
illness, death and other demographic and health records collected and analyzed by L. O.
Bygren and colleagues at Sweden’s Karolinska Institute.
A sample of Bygren’s data is shown in the table below.

It looked to the good doctor as if environment was influencing inheritance! It is as if the
environment was indeed causing an acquired change in the grandparent that is passed
not to one, but through two generations… and in a sex-specific way!
230 Epigenetic Inheritance: First Inkling

CMB3e

283

This phenomenon was subsequently demonstrated experimentally with the exposure of
pregnant rats to a toxin. Rat pups born to exposed mothers suffered a variety of
illnesses. This might be expected if the toxic effects on the mother were visited on the
developing pups, for example through the placenta. However, when the diseased male
rat pups matured and mated with females, the pups in the new litter grew up suffering the
same maladies as the male parent. This even though the pregnant females in this case
were NOT exposed to the toxins. Because the original female was already pregnant
when she was exposed, the germ line cells (eggs, sperm) of her litter had not suffered
mutations in utero. This could only mean that epigenetic patterns of gene expression
caused by the toxin in pup germ line cells (those destined to become sperm & eggs) in
utero were retained during growth to sexual maturity, and then passed on to their
progeny, even while gestating in a normal unexposed female.

Drosophila click Dietary Change Causes Heritable Change in Drosophila Epigenome. For
recent evidence for a role of male DNA methylation in trans-generational epigenetic
inheritance, check out More on Epigenetic Inheritance across Generations.
These days, the term epigenetics describes heritable changes in chromatin modifications
and gene expression. We now know that epigenetic configurations of chromatin that are
most stable include patterns of histone modification (acetylation, phosphorylation,
methylation…) or DNA (methylation, phosphorylation…). Such changes can convert the
30nm fiber to the 10nm ‘beads-on-a-string’ nucleosome necklace… and vice versa. Such
changes in chromatin (chromatin remodeling) lead to altered patterns of gene expression,
whether during normal development or when deranged by environmental factors
(abundance or limits on nutrition, toxins/poisons or other life-style choices). The active
study of DNA methylation patterns even has its own name, methylomics! Check out
Epigenetics Definitions and Nomenclature for more epigenetic nomenclature.
Let’s close this chapter with a question and some observations. Can you be sure that
your smoking habit will not affect the health of your children or grandchildren? What
about your eating habits? Drinking? It is not a little scary to know that I have a gullible
germline epigenome that can be influenced by my behavior, good and bad. And that my
children (and maybe grandchildren) will inherit my epigenetic legacy long before they get
my house and my money. And that may not be all… epigenetic memory in C. elegans
can stretch to 14 generations! Read about epigenetic inheritance resulting from Dad’s
cocaine use at Sins of the Father and about multigenerational epigenetic inheritance at

Chapter 13: Post Transcriptional Regulation of
Gene Expression
Regulating gene expression with short and long non-coding RNAs, CRISPR-Cas
and protein phosphorylation; Control gene expression by regulating translation

I.

Introduction

The metabolic potential of cells is flexible, depending on various mechanisms that
ultimately determine the levels and activities of proteins that dictate a cell’s metabolic
state. We have seen some of these regulatory mechanisms:
 the regulation of transcription by extracellular chemical signals or developmental
chemical prompts, and
 the control of enzyme or other protein activity by allosteric regulation or chemical
modification (e.g., phosphorylation or dephosphorylation).
In this chapter, we look at different kinds of post-transcriptional regulation, events
somewhere between mRNA transcription and controls on the activity of finished proteins.
These control mechanisms are most diverse in eukaryotes.
Like other pathways for regulating gene expression, post-transcriptional regulation begins
with extracellular chemical signaling. Responses include changes in the rate of
polypeptide translation, and changes in macromolecular turnover rate (e.g., changes in
the half-life of specific RNAs and proteins in cells). Regardless of mechanism, each upor down-regulation of gene expression contributes to changes in the steady state of a
particular RNA or protein required for proper cell function. In considering posttranscriptional regulation, we will see how cells use specific proteins and different noncoding RNA transcripts to target unwanted proteins or RNAs for degradation.
Learning Objectives
When you have mastered the information in this chapter, you should be able to:
1. explain what it is about C. elegans makes it a model organism for studying
development and the regulation of gene expression.
2. compare and contrast the origins and functions of miRNA and siRNA.
3. search for examples of miRNAs, siRNAs, lncRNAs and circRNAs that regulate the
expression of specific genes and explain their mechanisms.
4. explain how a riboswitch functions to control bacterial gene expression.
5. explain the origins and roles of bacterial CRISPR-Cas immune system components.
6. explain how eif2 activity is modulated to coordinate red cell heme and globin levels.
7. describe how eukaryotic cells degrade unwanted proteins and speculate on how
bacteria might do so.
8. answer the questions “How did junk DNA arise?” and “Does junk DNA have value?”

II.

Post-transcriptional Control of Gene Expression

Not too long ago we thought that very little of the eukaryotic genome was ever
transcribed. We also thought that the only non-coding RNAs were tRNAs and rRNAs.
Now we know that other RNAs play roles in gene regulation and the degradation of spent
cellular DNA or unwanted foreign DNA. These are discussed in detail below.
A. Riboswitches
The riboswitches is a bacterial transcription mechanism for regulating gene
expression. While this mechanism is not specifically post-transcriptional, it is included
here because the action occurs after transcription initiation and aborts completion of
an mRNA. When the mRNA for an enzyme in the guanine synthesis pathway is
transcribed, it folds into stem-&-loop structures. Enzyme synthesis will continue for as
long as the cell needs to make guanine. But if guanine accumulates in the cell,
excess guanine will bind stem-loop elements near the 5’ end of the
mRNA, causing the RNA polymerase and the partially completed mRNA dissociate
from the DNA, prematurely ending transcription. The basis of guanine riboswitch
regulation of expression of a guanine synthesis pathway enzyme is shown below

Illustration by G. Bergtrom

232 Riboswitches Interrupt Bacterial Transcription
CMB3e

288

The ability to form folded, stem-loop structures at the 5’ ends of bacterial mRNAs
seems to have allowed the evolution of translation regulation strategies. Whereas
guanine interaction with the stem-loop structure of an emerging 5’ mRNA can abort its
own transcription, similar small metabolite/mRNA and even protein/mRNA interactions
can also regulate (in this case prevent) translation. As we will see shortly, 5’ mRNA
folded structures also play a role in eukaryotic translation regulation.
233 Small Metabolites Also Regulate Bacterial mRNA translation
B. CRISPR/Cas: RNA-Protein Complex of a Prokaryotic Adaptive Immune System
In higher organisms, the immune system is adaptive. It remembers prior exposure to
a pathogen, and can thus mount a response to a second exposure to the same
pathogen. The discovery of an ‘adaptive immune system’ in many prokaryotes
(bacteria, archaebacteria) was therefore something of a surprise.
CRISPR (Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeat) RNAs are
derived from phage transcripts that have interacted with CRISPR-Associated (Cas)
proteins. They make up the CRISPR/Cas system that seems to have evolved to fight
of viral infection by targeting phage DNA for destruction. When viral DNA gets into a
cell during a phage infection, it can generate a CRISPR/Cas gene array in the
bacterial genome, with spacer DNA sequences separating repeats of the CRISPR
genes. These remnants of a phage infection are the memory of this prokaryotic
immune system. When a phage attempts to re-infect a previously exposed cell,
spacer RNAs and Cas genes are transcribed. After Cas mRNA translation, the Cas
protein and spacer RNAs will engage and target the incoming phage DNA for
destruction to prevent infection. Thus, the CRISPR/Cas systems (there is more than
one!) remember prior phage attacks, and transmit that memory to progeny cells. The
CRISPR/Cas9 system in Streptococcus pyogenes is one of the simplest of these
immune defense systems (illustrated below).
Illustration by
G. Bergtrom

CMB3e

289

The CRISPR/Cas gene array consists of the following components:
 Cas:
Genes native to host cells
 CRISPR:
24-48 bp repeats native to host cells
 Spacer DNA:
DNA between CRISPR repeats: typically, phage DNA from
prior phage infection or plasmid transformation
 leader DNA:
Contains promoter for CRISPR/spacer RNA transcription
 tracr gene:
Encodes transcription activator (tracr) RNA (not all systems)
Let’s look at CRISPR/Cas in action.
1. The CRISPR/Cas Immune Response
Consider the mechanism of action of this prokaryotic immune system. The action
begins when infectious phage DNA gets into the cell, as drawn below.

Illustration by
G. Bergtrom

Let’s summarize what has happened here:
a) Incoming phage DNA was detected after phage infection.
b) Then the tracr and Cas genes are transcribed along with the CRISPR/spacer
region. Cas mRNAs are translated to make the Cas protein. Remember, the
spacer DNAs in the CRISPR region are the legacy of a prior phage infection.
c) CRISPR/spacer RNA forms hydrogen bonds with a complementary region of
the tracr RNA as the two RNAs associate with Cas proteins.
CMB3e

290

d) Cas protein endonucelases hydrolyze spacer RNA from CRISPR RNA
sequences. The spacer RNAs remain associated with the complex while the
actual, imperfectly palindromic CRISPR sequences (shown in blue in the
illustration above) fall off.
In the next steps, phage-derived spacer RNAs, now called guide RNAs (or
gRNAs) ‘guide’ mature Cas9/tracrRNA/spacer RNA complexes to new incoming
phage DNA resulting from a phage attack. The association of the complex with the
incoming phage DNA and subsequent events are illustrated below.

Illustration by
G. Bergtrom

Once again, let’s summarize:
a) Spacer (i.e., gRNA) in the complex targets incoming phage DNA.
b) Cas helicase unwinds incoming phage DNA at complementary regions.
c) gRNA H-bonds to incoming phage DNA.
d) Cas endonucleases create a double-stranded break (hydrolytic cleavage) at
specific sites in incoming phage DNA. Because precise site DNA strand
cleavage is guided by RNA molecules, CRISPR/Cas endonucleases are
classified as type V restriction enzymes.
e) The incoming phage DNA is destroyed and a new phage infection is aborted.

Check out More about CRISPR in Wikipedia to learn more about how bacteria
acquire spacer DNAs, and therefore how this primitive adaptive immune system
‘remembers’) in the first place.
2. Using CRISPR/Cas to Edit/Engineer Genes
Early studies demonstrated the reproducible cleavage of incoming phage DNA at
specific nucleotides. Several labs quickly realized that it might be possible to
adapt the system to cut DNA at virtually any specific nucleotide in a target DNA! It
has turned out that the system works both in vivo and in vitro, allowing virtually
unlimited potential for editing genes and RNAs in a test tube… or in any cell. Here
is the basic process:
a) Engineer gDNA with a Cas-specific DNA sequence that targets a desired target
in genomic DNA.
b) Fuse the gDNA to tracr DNA to make a single guide DNA (sgDNA) so that it
can be made as a single guide transcript (sgRNA).
c) Engineer a CRISPR/Cas9 gene array that substitutes this sgDNA for its original
spacer DNAs.
d) Place engineered array in a plasmid next to regulated promoters.
e) Transform cells by ‘electroporation’ (works for almost any cell type!)
f) Activate the promoter to transcribe the CRISPR/Cas9 genes…
The applications are powerful… and controversial!
3. The Power and the Controversy
The application of gene editing with CRISPR/Cas systems has already facilitated
studies of gene function in vitro, in cells and in whole organisms. Click CRISPR
Applications from NEB for a description of CRISPR/Cas applications already on
the market! The efficiency of specific gene editing using CRISPR/Cas systems
holds great promise for understanding basic gene structure and function, for
determining the genetic basis of disease, and for accelerating the search for gene
therapies. Here are just a few examples of how CRISPR/Cas approaches are
being applied.


CMB3e

One can engineer an sgRNA with desired mutations targeting specific sites in
chromosomal DNA. Then clone sgRNA into the CRISPR/Cas9 array on a
plasmid. After transformation of appropriate cells, the engineered
CRISPR/Cas9 forms a complex with target DNA sequences. Following

292

nicking of both strands of the target DNA, DNA repair can insert the mutated
guide sequences into the target DNA. The result is loss or acquisition of DNA
sequences at specific, exact sites, or Precision Gene Editing. It is the ability to
do this in living cells that has excited the basic and clinical research
communities.


Before transforming cells, engineer the CRISPR/Cas9 gene array on the
plasmid to eliminate both endonuclease activities from the Cas protein. Upon
transcription of the array in transformed cells, the CRISPR/Cas9-sgRNA still
finds an sgRNA-targeted gene. However, lacking CAS protein endonuclease
activities, the complex that forms just sits there blocking transcription. This
technique is sometimes referred to as CRISPRi (CRISPER interference), by
analogy to RNAi. Applied to organisms (and not just in vitro or to cells), it
mimics the much more difficult knockout mutation experiments that have been
used in studies of behavior of cells or organisms rendered unable to express a
specific protein.



There are now several working CRISPR/Cas systems capable of Precision
Gene Editing. They are exciting for their speed, precision, their prospects for
rapid, targeted gene therapies to fight disease, and their possibilities to alter
entire populations (called Gene Drive). By inserting modified genes into the
germline cells of target organisms, gene drive can render harmless entire
malarial mosquito populations, to eliminate pesticide resistance in e.g. insects,
eliminate herbicide resistance in undesirable plants, or genetically eliminate
invasive species. For more information, click Gene drive; for an easy read
about this process and the controversies surrounding applications of CRISPR
technologies to mosquitoes in particular, check out J. Adler, (2016) A World
Without Mosquitoes. Smithsonian, 47(3) 36-42, 84.



It is even possible to delete an entire chromosome from cells. This bit of global
genetic engineering relies on identifying multiple unique sequences on a single
chromosome and then targeting these sites for CRISPR/Cas. When the
system is activated, the chromosome is cut at those sites, fragmenting it
beyond the capacity of DNA repair mechanisms to fix the situation. Click Using
CRISPR/Cas9 to delete a chromosome to learn more.

If for no other reason than its efficiency and simplicity, precision gene editing with
CRISPR/Cas techniques has raised ethical issues. Clearly, the potential exists for
abuse, or even for use with no beneficial purpose at all. It is significant that,
as in all discussions of biological ethics, scientists are very much engaged in the
conversation. Despite the controversy, we will no doubt continue to edit genes

CMB3e

293

with CRISPR/Cas, and we can look for a near future Nobel Prize for its discovery
and application! If you still have qualms, maybe RNA editing will be the answer.
Check out the link at Why edit RNA? for an overview of the possibilities!
Finally, “mice and men” (and women and babies too) have antibodies to Cas9
proteins, suggesting prior exposure to microbial CRISPR/Cas9 antigens. This
observation may limit clinical applications of the technology! See Uncertain Future
of CRISPR-Cas9 Technology.
C. The Small RNAs: miRNA and siRNA in Eukaryotes
Micro RNAs (miRNAs) and small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) are found in C. elegans, a
small nematode (roundworm) that quickly became a model for studies of cell and
molecular biology and development. The particular attractions C. elegans are that
(a) its genome has ~21,700 genes, comparable to the ~25,000 genes in a human
genome!; (b) it uses the products of these genes to produce an adult worm consisting
of just 1031 cells organized into all of the major organs found in higher organisms; (c)
It is possible to trace the embryonic origins of every single cell in its body! C. elegans
is illustrated below.
CC BY-SA 3.0; From http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caenorhabditis_elegans

1. Small Interfering RNA (siRNA)
siRNA was first found in plants as well as in C. elegans. However, siRNAs (and
miRNAs) are common in many higher organisms. siRNAs were so-named
because they interfere with the function of other RNAs foreign to the cell or

CMB3e

294

organism. Their action was dubbed RNA interference (RNAi). For their discovery
of siRNAs, A. Z. Fire and C. C. Mello shared the 2006 Nobel Prize in Physiology or
Medicine. The action of siRNA targeting foreign DNA is illustrated below.

Illustration by G. Bergtrom

When cells recognize foreign double-stranded RNAs (e.g., some viral RNA
genomes) as alien, the DICER a nuclease called hydrolyzes them. The resulting
short double-stranded hydrolysis products (the siRNAs) combine with RNAi
Induced Silencing Complex, or RISC proteins. The antisense siRNA strand in the
resulting siRNA-RISC complex binds to complementary regions of foreign RNAs,
targeting them for degradation. Cellular use of RISC to control gene expression in
this way may have derived from the use of RISC proteins by miRNAs as part of a
cellular defense mechanism, to be discussed next.

CMB3e

295

Custom-designed siRNAs have been used to disable expression of specific genes
in order to study their function in vivo and in vitro. Both siRNAs and miRNAs are
being investigated as possible therapeutic tools to interfere with RNAs whose
expression leads to cancer or other diseases.
234 siRNA Post Transcriptional Regulation
235 Did siRNA Coopt RISC strategy to Trash Corrupt or Worn out RNA?
For an example check out a Youtube video of unexpected results of an RNAi
experiment at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3XboKthxM8. In the experiment
described, RNAi was used to block embryonic expression of the orthodenticle
(odt) gene that is normally required for the growth of horns in a dung beetle. The
effect of this knock-out mutation was, as expected, to prevent horn growth. What
was unexpected however, was the development of an eye in the middle of the
beetle’s head (‘third eye’ in the micrograph).
The 3rd eye not only looks like an eye, but is a functional one. This was
demonstrated by preventing normal eye development in odt-knockout mutants.
The 3rd eye appeared…, and was responsive to light! Keep in mind that this was a
beetle with a 3rd eye, not Drosophila! To quote Justin Kumar from Indiana
University, who though not involved in the research, stated that “…lessons learned
from Drosophila may not be as generally applicable as I or other Drosophilists,
would like to believe … The ability to use RNAi in non-traditional model systems is
a huge advance that will probably lead to a more balanced view of development.”
2. Micro RNAs (miRNA)
miRNAs target unwanted endogenous cellular RNAs for degradation. They are
transcribed from genes now known to be widely distributed in eukaryotes. The
pathway from pre-miRNA transcription through processing and target mRNA
degradation is illustrated on the next page.
As they are transcribed, pre-miRNAs fold into a stem-loop structure that is lost
during cytoplasmic processing. Like SiRNAs, mature miRNAs combine with RISC
proteins. The RISC protein-miRNA complex targets old or no-longer needed
mRNAs or mRNAs damaged during transcription.

An estimated 250 miRNAs in humans may be sufficient to H-bond to diverse target
RNAs; only targets with strong complementarity to a RISC protein-miRNA complex
will be degraded.
236 miRNA Post-Transcriptional Regulation
D. Long Non-Coding RNAs
Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are a yet another class of eukaryotic RNAs. They
include transcripts of antisense, intronic, intergenic, pseudogene and retroposon DNA.
Retroposons are one kind of transposon, or mobile DNA element; pseudogenes are
recognizable genes with mutations that make them non-functional. While some
lncRNAs might turn out to be incidental transcripts that the cell simply destroys, others
have a role in regulating gene expression.
A recently discovered lncRNA is XistAR that, along with the Xist gene product, is
required to form Barr bodies. Barr bodies form in human females when one of the X
chromosomes in somatic cells is inactivated. For a review of lncRNAs, see Lee, J.T.
(2012. Epigenetic Regulation by Long Noncoding RNAs; Science 338, 1435-1439).

CMB3e

297

An even more recent article (at lncRNAs and smORFs) summarizes the discovery that
some long non-coding RNAs contain short open reading frames (smORFs) that are
actually translated into short peptides of 30+ amino acids! Who knows? The human
genome may indeed contain more than 21,000-25,000 protein-coding genes!
E. Circular RNAs (circRNA)
Though discovered more than 20 years ago, circular RNAs (circRNAs) are made in
different eukaryotic cell types. Click Circular RNAs (circRNA) to learn more about this
peculiar result of alternative splicing. At first circRNAs were hard to isolate. When
they were isolated, circRNAs contained “scrambled” exonic sequences and were
therefore thought to be nonfunctional errors of mRNA splicing.
In fact, circRNAs are fairly stable. Their levels can rise and fall in patterns suggesting
that they are functional molecules. Levels of one circRNA, called circRims1, rise
specifically during neural development. In mice, other circRNAs accumulate during
synapse formation, likely influencing how these neurons will ultimately develop and
function. Thus, circRNAs do not seem to be ‘molecular mistakes’. In fact, errors in
their own synthesis may be correlated with disease! Speculation on the functions of
circRNAs also includes roles in gene regulation, particularly the genes or mRNAs from
which they themselves are derived.
F. “Junk DNA” in Perspective
Not long ago, we thought that less than 5% of a eukaryotic genome was transcribed
(i.e., into mRNA, rRNA and tRNA), and that much of the non-transcribed genome
served a structural function… or no function at all. The latter, labeled junk DNA,
included non-descript intergenic sequences, pseudogenes, ‘dead’ transposons, long
stretches of intronic DNA, etc. Thus, junk DNA was DNA we could do without. Junk
DNAs were thought to be accidental riders in our genomes, hitchhikers picked up on
the evolutionary road.
While miRNA genes are a small proportion of a eukaryotic genome, their discovery,
and that of more abundant lnc RNAs suggest a far greater amount of functional DNA
in the genome. Might there be in fact, no such thing as “junk DNA”? The debate
about how much of our genomic DNA is a relic of past evolutionary experiments and
without genetic purpose continues. Read all about it at Junk DNA - not so useless
after all and Only 8.2% of human DNA is functional.

CMB3e

298

Perhaps we need to re-think what it means for DNA to be “junk” or to be without
“genetic purpose”. Maintenance of more than 90% of our own DNA with no known
genetic purpose surely comes at an energy cost. At the same time, all of that DNA is
grist for future selection, a source of the diversity required for long-term survival. The
same natural selection that picks up ‘hitchhiker’ DNA sequences, as we have seen,
can at some point, put them to work!
G. The RNA Methylome
Call this an RNA epi-transcriptome if you like! Recall that methyl groups direct
cleavage of ribosomal RNAs from eukaryotic 45S pre-RNA transcripts. tRNAs among
other transcripts, are also post-transcriptionally modified. Known since the 1970s,
such modifications were thought to be non-functional. But are they?

III. Eukaryotic Regulation of Translation
A. The basics of Eukaryotic mRNA Translation
The basic features of translation initiation in eukaryotes are shown below.

Illustration by
G. Bergtrom

In many respects, the overall process is similar to prokaryotic translation initiation
described elsewhere. The 40S ribosomal subunit itself can bind to and scan an
mRNA, seeking the start site of an ORF (open reading frame) encoding a polypeptide.
When GTP-bound eukaryotic initiation factor 2 (GTP-eIF2) binds met-tRNAf, it forms a
CMB3e

299

ternary complex (TC). The TC can associate with the scanning 40S subunit. When a
TC-associated scanning subunit encounters the start site of the ORF, scanning stalls.
Additional eIFs enable formation of the initiation complex, positioning the initiator tRNA
anticodon over the start site AUG in the mRNA. The initiation complex then recruits
the large (60S) ribosomal subunit. Binding of the 60S ribosomal subunit to the
initiation complex causes the release of all the eIFs and hydrolysis of the GTP on
eIF2. The GDP remains bound to eIF2. For protein syntheses to continue, new GTP
must replace GDP on eIF2. Another initiation factor, eIF2B, facilitates this GTP/GDP
swap, recycling GTP-eIF2 for use in initiation. The regulation of translation is
superimposed on these basic processes.
B. Translation Regulation
Since mRNAs are made to be translated, it is likely that by default, they are! We know
that CAP and poly(A) tails on mRNAs are required for efficient translation because
mRNAs engineered to lack one and/or the other are poorly translated. Also, there is
little evidence to that cells modify the process of capping or polyadenylation, or the
structures themselves.
Translation regulation typically targets initiation. It may be global, affecting the
synthesis of many polypeptides at once, or specific, affecting a single polypeptide.
Global regulation involves changes in the activity of eukaryotic initiation factors (eIFs)
that would typically affect all cellular protein synthesis. Specific regulation involves
binding sequences or regions on one or a few mRNAs that recognize and bind specific
regulatory proteins and/or other molecules. That binding controls translation of only
those mRNAs, without affecting general protein biosynthesis. mRNA structural
features involved in translation and in translation regulation are illustrated below.

Illustration by
G. Bergtrom

We will consider three examples of translational control of gene expression.
CMB3e

300

1. Specific Translation Control by mRNA Binding Proteins
Ferritin is a cellular iron-storage protein made up of heavy and light chain
polypeptides. Translation of ferritin in iron-deficient cells is inhibited. In the
absence of ferritin production, ferritin-iron complexes release iron for metabolic
use. The 5’-UTR of mRNAs for both chains contain stem-loop binding sites that
specifically recognize iron regulatory proteins (IRP1, IRP2). When ferritin
mRNAs are bound to IRPs, translation initiation is blocked. The inhibition of ferritin
translation by IRPs is illustrated below.
Illustration by
G. Bergtrom

Illustration by
G. Bergtrom

Normally, the initiation complex scans the 5’-UTR of an mRNA. When it finds the
normal translation start site, it can bind the large subunit and begin translating the
polypeptide. In iron-deficient cells, scanning by the initiation complex is thought to
be physically blocked by steric hindrance.
2. Coordinating Heme & Globin Synthesis
Consider that reticulocytes (the precursors to erythrocytes, the red blood cells in
mammals) synthesize globin proteins. They also synthesize heme, an iron-bound
porphyrin-ring molecule. Each globin must bind to a single heme to make a
hemoglobin protein subunit. Clearly, it would not do for a reticulocyte to make too
much globin protein and not enough heme, or vice versa. It turns out that hemin

CMB3e

301

(a precursor to heme) regulates the initiation of translation of both  and  globin
mRNAs. Recall that, to sustain globin mRNA translation, the GDP-eIF2 generated
after each cycle of translation elongation must be exchanged for fresh GTP. This is
facilitated by the eIF2B initiation factor. eIF2B can exist in phosphorylated
(inactive) or un-phosphorylated (active) states. Making sure that globin is not
under- or overproduced relative to heme biosynthesis involves controlling levels of
active vs. inactive eIF2B by hemin. Hemin accumulates when there is not enough
globin polypeptide to combine with heme in the cell. Excess hemin binds and
inactivates an HCR kinase, preventing phosphorylation of eIF2B. Since
unphosphorylated eiF2B is active, it facilitates the GTP/GDP swap needed to allow
continued translation. Thus, ongoing initiation ensures that globin mRNA
translation can keep up with heme levels. In other words, if hemin production gets
ahead of globin, it will promote more globin translation.
When globin and heme levels become approximately equimolar, hemin is no
longer in excess. It then dissociates from the active HCR kinase. The now- active
kinase catalyzes eIF2B phosphorylation. Phospho-eIF2B is inactive, and cannot
facilitate the GTP/GDP swap on eIF2. Globin mRNA translation initiation, thus
blocked, allows a lower rate of globin polypeptide translation to keep pace with
heme synthesis. The regulation of globin mRNA translation initiation by hemin is
shown below.

Illustration by G.
Bergtrom

237 Translation Regulation of Globin Polypeptide Synthesis

CMB3e

302

3. Translational Regulation of Yeast GCN4
Like the coordination of heme and globin production, the regulation of the GCN4
protein is based on controlling the ability of the cells to swap GTP for GDP on eIF2.
However, this regulation is quite a bit more complex, despite the fact that yeast is a
more primitive eukaryote! GCN4 is a global transcription factor that controls the
transcription of as many as 30 genes in pathways for the synthesis of 19 out of the
20 amino acids! The discovery that amino acid starvation caused yeast cells to
increase their production of amino acids in the cells led to the discovery the
General Amino Acid Control (GAAC) mechanism involving GCN4. GCN is short
for General Control Nondepressible, referring to its global, positive regulatory
effects. It turns out that the GCN4 protein is also involved in stress gene
expression, glycogen homeostasis, purine biosynthesis…, in fact in the action of
up to 10% of all yeast genes! Here we focus on the GAAC mechanism.
Yeast cells provided with ample amino acids do not need to synthesize them.
Under these conditions, GCN4 is present at basal (i.e., low) levels. When the cells
are starved of amino acids, GCN4 levels increase as much as ten-fold within two
hours, resulting in an increase in general amino acid synthesis. This rapid
response occurs because amino acid starvation signals an increase in the activity
of GCN2, a protein kinase. The GCN2 kinase catalyzes phosphorylation of GDPeIF2. As we have already seen, phosphorylated eIF2B cannot exchange GTP for
GDP on the eIF2, in this case with the results shown below.

Illustration by G. Bergtrom

CMB3e

303

There is a paradox here. You would expect a slowdown in GTP-eIF2 regeneration
to inhibit overall protein synthesis, and it does. However, the reduced levels of
GTP-eIF2 somehow also stimulate translation of the GCN4 mRNA, leading to
increased transcription of the amino acid synthesis genes. In other words, amino
acid starvation leads yeast cells to use available substrates to make their own
amino acids in order that protein synthesis can continue… at the same time as
initiation complex formation is disabled!
Let’s accept that paradox for now, and look at how amino acid starvation leads to
increased translation of the GCN4 protein and the up-regulation of amino acid
biosynthesis pathways. To begin with, we are going to need to understand the
structure of GCN4 mRNA. In the illustration below, note the 4 short uORFs in the
5’UTR of the RNA; these play a key role in GCN4 translation regulation

Illustration by G. Bergtrom

We noted earlier that when a Ternary Complex (TC)-associated 40S ribosomal
subunit scans an mRNAs and find the ORF start sites for its polypeptide, initiation
complexes form, 60S ribosomal subunits bind and translation starts. GCN4 mRNA
has four uORFs in its 5’ UTR. While uORFs encode only a few amino acids before
encountering a stop codon, they can also be recognized during scanning. When
TCs and 40S subunits are plentiful, they seem to engage uORFs in preference to
the GCN4 coding region ORF, as illustrated below.

Illustration by G. Bergtrom

CMB3e

304

Under these conditions, active eIF2B allows the GTP/GDP swap on GDP-eIF2,
leading to efficient GTP-eIF2 recycling and high TC levels. TCs bind small
subunits during scanning and/or at the start sites of uORFs, forming initiation
complexes that then bind 60S ribosomal subunits and begin uORF translation.
The effect is to slow down scanning past the uORFs, thereby inhibiting initiation
complex formation at the actual GCN4 ORF.
What happens in amino acid-starved cultures of yeast cells, when GTP-eIF2
cannot be efficiently regenerated and TCs are in short supply? To review, amino
acid starvation signals an increase in GCN2 kinase activity resulting in
phosphorylation and inactivation of eIF2B. Inactive phospho-eIF2 will not facilitate
the GTP/GDP swap at GDP-eIF2, inhibiting overall protein synthesis. The
resulting reduction in GTP-eIF2 also lowers the levels of TC and TC-associated
40S subunits. The illustration below shows how this phenomenon up-regulates
GCN4 translation, even as the translation of other mRNAs has declined.

Under these conditions, initiation complex formation at uORFs is less likely, and
remaining TC-40S complex scanning is more likely to reach the GCN4 ORF,
increasing GCN4 translation! The increased production of the gene-regulatory
GCN4 protein then turns on virtually all of the genes for enzymes of amino acid
biosynthesis. The cells thus make their own amino acids when the medium has
few to contribute! For a good review of the translation-level regulation in general,
and of GCN4, click Regulation of GCN4 Translation.

IV. Eukaryotic Regulation of Protein Turnover

Illustration by G. Bergtrom

C. Regulating Protein Turnover (Half-Life)
We have already seen that organelles have a finite life span, or half-life. Recall that
lysosomes participate in destroying worn out mitochondria and their molecular
components. We also saw the role of small RNAs (especially miRNA) in destroying
old, damaged or otherwise unwanted RNAs from cells. All cell structures and
molecules have a finite half-life, defined as the time it takes for half of them to
disappear in the absence of new synthesis of the structure or molecule. As we
already know, the steady-state level of any cellular structure or molecule exists when
the rate of its manufacture or synthesis is balanced by the rate of its turnover. Of
course, steady state levels of things can change. For example, the level of gene
expression (the amount of a final RNA or protein gene product in a cell) can change if

CMB3e

305

rates of transcription, processing or turnover change. We should also expect the
same for the steady-state levels of cellular proteins. Here we consider the factors that
govern the half-life of cellular proteins.
The half-life of different proteins seems to be inherent in their structure. Thus, some
amino acid side chains are more exposed at the surface of the protein and are thus
more susceptible to change or damage over time than others. Proteins with fewer
‘vulnerable’ amino acids should have a longer half-life than those with more of them.
Proteins damaged by errors of translation, folding, processing gone awry or just worn
out from use or ‘old age’ will be targeted for destruction. All molecules have a half-life!
The mechanism for detecting and destroying unwanted old, damaged or misbegotten
proteins involves a 76-amino acid polypeptide called ubiquitin that targets the protein
for destruction, delivering it to a large complex of polypeptides called the proteasome.
Here is what happens:
1. The first step is to activate an ubiquitin. This starts when ATP hydrolysis fuels the
binding of ubiquitin to an ubiquitin-activating enzyme.
2. An ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme then replaces the ubiquitin-activation enzyme.
3. The protein destined for destruction replaces the ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme.
4. Several more ubiquitins then bind to this complex.
5. The poly-ubiquinated protein delivers its protein to one of the 19S ‘CAP’
structures of a proteasome.
6. After binding to one of the CAP structures of a proteasome, the poly-ubiquinated
target proteins dissociate and the ubiquitins are released and recycled as the
target protein unfolds (powered by ATP hydrolysis). The unfolded protein then
enters a 20S core proteasome.
The target protein is digested to short peptide fragments by proteolytic enzymes in the
interior of the proteasome core. The fragments are release from the CAP complex at
the other end of the proteasome and digested down to free amino acids in the
cytoplasm. There is a mind-boggling variety of proteins in a cell…, and there are as
many as 600 different ubiquitin proteins, encoded by as many genes! Presumably,
each ubiquitin handles a subclass of proteins based on common features of their
structure.
With its complex quaternary structure, the 26S proteasome is smaller than a
eukaryotic small ribosomal subunit (40S), but is still one of the largest cytoplasmic
particles… and without the benefit of any RNA in its structure! The illustration on the
next page details the role of ubiquitin in the degradation of a worn out protein by a
proteasome. Click on Proteasome in Action to see an animated version of the
illustration.

Introduction

Because of their small size, bacterial genomes have few repetitive DNA sequences. In
contrast, repetitive DNA sequences make up a large part of a eukaryotic genome. Much
of this repeated DNA consists of identical or nearly identical sequences of varying length
repeated many times in a genome. Examples include satellite DNA (minisatellite and
microsatellite DNA) and transposons, or transposable elements. Here we look at
experiments that first revealed the existence and proportion of repeated DNA in genomes.
Next we describe Barbara McClintock’s even earlier (and pretty amazing!) discovery of
transposable elements. After we describe the different classes of transposons and
different mechanisms of transposition, we tackle the question of why they and other
repetitive DNAs even exist. Elsewhere we introduced the notion of junk DNA as DNA
sequences that serve no known purpose. Is repeated DNA junk DNA? Are transposable
elements junk? We are now learning that transposons and other repetitive DNAs can
have specific functions, from regulating gene expression to reshaping genomes to
increasing genetic diversity in evolution. So, far from being ‘junk’, much redundant DNA
exists in genomes because of evolutionary selection.

II.

The Complexity of Genomic DNA

By the 1960s, when Roy Britten and Eric Davidson were studying eukaryotic gene
regulation, they knew that there was more than enough DNA to account for the genes
needed to encode an organism. It was also likely that DNA was more structurally
complex than originally thought. They knew that cesium chloride (CsCl) density
gradient centrifugation separated molecules based on differences in density and that
fragmented DNA would separate into a main and a minor band of different density in
centrifuge tube. The minor band was dubbed satellite DNA, recalling the Sputnik satellite
recently launched by Russia. DNA bands of different density could not exist if the
proportions of A, G, T and C in DNA (already known to be species-specific) were the
same throughout a genome. Instead, there must be regions of DNA that are richer in A-T
than G-C pairs and vice versa. Analysis of satellite bands that moved further on the
gradient (i.e., were more dense) than the main band were indeed richer in GC content.
Those that lay above the main band were more AT-rich.
Consider early estimates of how many genes it might take to make a human, mouse,
chicken or petunia: about 100,000! We know now that it takes fewer! Nevertheless, even
with inflated estimates of the number of genes it takes to make a typical eukaryote, their
genomes contain 100-1000 times more DNA than necessary to account for 100,000
genes. How then to explain this extra DNA? Britten and Davidson’s elegant
renaturation kinetics experiments revealed some physical characteristics of genes and
so-called ‘extra’ DNA. Let’s look at these experiments in some detail.
A. The Renaturation Kinetic Protocol
The first step in a renaturation kinetic experiment is to shear DNA isolates to an
average size of 10 Kbp by pushing high molecular weight DNA through a hypodermic
needle at constant pressure. The resulting double-stranded fragments
(dsDNA) is then heated to 1000C to denature (separate) the two strands. The
solutions are then cooled to 600C to allow the single stranded DNA (ssDNA)
fragments to slowly re-form complementary double strands. At different times after
incubation at 60oC, the partially renatured DNA was sampled and ssDNA and dsDNA
were separated and quantified.

CMB3e

310

The experiment is summarized in the drawing below.

Illustration by G. Bergtrom

The amount, or percent of DNA that had renatured over time could be graphed.
B. Renaturation Kinetic Data
A plot of dsDNA formed at different times (out to many days!) is shown below for a
renaturation kinetics experiment using rat DNA.

Illustration by G. Bergtrom

In this example, the DNA fragments could be placed in three main groups with
different overall rates of renaturation. Britten and Davidson reasoned that the dsDNA
that had formed most rapidly was composed of sequences that must be more highly
repetitive than the rest of the DNA. The rat genome also had a lesser amount of more
moderately repeated dsDNA fragments that took longer to anneal than the highly

CMB3e

311

repetitive fraction, and even less of a very slowly re-annealing DNA fraction. The latter
sequences were so rare in the extract that it could take days for them to re-form
double strands, and were classified as non-repetitive, unique (or nearly unique)
sequence DNA, as illustrated below.

Illustration by G. Bergtrom

It became clear that the rat genome (in fact most eukaryotic genomes) consists of
different classes of DNA that differ in their redundancy. From the graph, a surprisingly
a large fraction of the genome was repetitive to a greater or lesser extent.
238 Discovery of Repetitive DNA
When renaturation kinetics were determined for E. coli DNA, only one ‘redundancy
class’ of DNA was seen, as is shown below.

Illustration by G. Bergtrom

CMB3e

312

Based on E. coli gene mapping studies and the small size of the E. coli ‘chromosome’,
the reasonable assumption was that there is little room for ‘extra’ DNA in a bacterial
genome, and that the single class of DNA on this plot must be unique-sequence DNA.
C. Genomic Complexity
Britten and Davidson defined the relative amounts of repeated and unique (or singlecopy) DNA sequences in an organism’s genome as its genomic complexity. Thus,
prokaryotic genomes have a lower genomic complexity than eukaryotes. Using the
same data as is in the previous two graphs, Britten and Davidson demonstrated the
difference between eukaryotic and prokaryotic genome complexity by a simple
expedient. Instead of plotting the fraction of dsDNA formed vs. time of renaturation,
they plotted the percent of re-associated DNA against the concentration of the renatured DNA multiplied by the time that DNA took to reanneal (the CoT value).
When CoT values from rat and E. coli renaturation data are plotted on the same
graph, you get the CoT curves in the graph below.

Illustration by G. Bergtrom

This deceptively simple extra calculation (from the same data!) allows comparison of
the complexities of any number of genomes. These CoT curves tell us that ~100% of
the bacterial genome consists of unique sequences, compared to the rat genome with
its three DNA redundancy classes. Prokaryotic genomes are indeed largely
composed of unique (non-repetitive) sequence DNA that must include single-copy
genes (or operons) that encode proteins, ribosomal RNAs and transfer RNAs.
239 CoT Curves and DNA Complexity Explained!

CMB3e

313

C. Functional Differences between Cot Classes of DNA
The next question of course was what kinds of sequences are repeated and which are
‘unique’ in eukaryotic DNA? Eukaryotic satellite DNAs, transposons and ribosomal
RNA genes were early suspects. To begin to answer these questions, satellite DNA
was isolated from the CsCl gradients, made radioactive and then heated to separate
the DNA strands. In a separate renaturation kinetic experiment, rat DNA was sampled
at different times. The isolated Cot fractions were once again denatured and mixed
with heat-denatured radioactive satellite DNA. The mixture was then cooled to allow
renaturation. The experimental protocol is illustrated below.

Illustration by G. Bergtrom

The results of this experiment showed that radioactive satellite DNA only annealed to
DNA from the low Cot fraction (highly repeated) fraction of DNA. Satellite DNA is thus
highly repeated in the eukaryotic genome. In similar experiments, isolated rRNAs
made radioactive formed RNA-DNA hybrids when mixed and cooled with the
denatured middle CoT fraction of eukaryotic DNA. Thus, rRNA genes were
moderately repetitive. With the advent of recombinant DNA technologies, the

CMB3e

314

redundancy of other kinds of DNA were explored using cloned genes (encoding rRNA,
proteins, transposons and other sequences) to probe DNA fractions obtained from
renaturation kinetics experiments. Results of such experiments are summarized in the
table below.

The table compares properties (lengths, copy number, functions, percent of the
genome, location in the genome, etc.) of different kinds of repetitive sequence DNA.
The observation that most of a eukaryotic genome is made up of repeated DNA, and
that transposons can be as much as 80% of a genome was a surprise!

III. The ‘Jumping Genes’ of Maize
Barbara McClintock’s report that bits of DNA could jump around and integrate themselves
into new loci in DNA was so dramatic and arcane that many thought the phenomenon
was either a one-off, or not real! Only with the subsequent discovery of transposons in
bacteria (and in other eukaryotes) were McClintock’s jumping genes finally recognized for
what they were! As we describe her experiments, keep in mind that McClintock’s
research and intuitions about gene regulation and epigenetic inheritance came long
before molecular technologies made it possible to prove and give names to these
phenomena. To begin our tale of transposons, look at the illustration of maize
reproduction below.

indeed follow Mendelian rules, but the genetics of mosaicism did not. Mosaic color
patterns after genetic crosses were not consistent, implying that the mutations
responsible for kernel color were not due to mutations in germ cells. Rather, genes
controlling anthocyanin synthesis must be undergoing mutations in somatic cells that
would become (or already were) the ones in which the pigments were produced.
242 What Interested McClintock About Maize
A. Discovering the Genes of Mosaicism; the Unstable Ds Gene
McClintock was looking for a genetic explanation for seed color variation in the 1940s
and early 1950s. DNA structure had only recently been published. Gene cloning and
DNA sequencing were decades into the future! Her only available technologies were
based on understanding Mendelian allelic assortment in traditional breeding studies.
Nevertheless, since seed color is expressed in cells derived from endosperm, she
knew that the inheritance of kernel color phenotype must be studied against a
triploid genetic background. McClintock was also aware of proposals that the
variegated color phenotype might result when an ‘unstable mutation’ that produced
colorless kernels ‘reverted’ in some cells but not others to create a spotted or streaked
phenotype. Just what made for an ‘unstable mutation’ was of course, unknown.

CMB3e

317

McClintock ultimately identified three genes involved in seed kernel coloration. Two of
the genes initially studied by McClintock controlled the presence vs. absence of kernel
color. These are the C and Bz genes:
1. C’ is the dominant inhibitor allele, so-called because if even one copy was present,
the kernels were colorless (yellow), regardless of the rest of the genetic
background.
2. Bz and bz are dominant and recessive alleles of the Bz gene, respectively. In the
absence of a C’ (dominant) allele, the presence of a Bz allele would lead to purple
kernels. If the bz allele was present without both C’ and Bz alleles, the kernels
would be dark brown.
3. The gene required to get variegated kernel color was the Ds (Dissociator) gene.
Without a viable Ds gene, kernels were either colored or colorless depending on
the possible genotypes dictated by the C and Bz alleles.
In other words, it must be the Ds gene that suffers ‘unstable mutations. Because the
Ds gene effect was random and only affected some aleurone layer cells, it was
suspected to be a region of chromosomal instability (prone to damage or breakage) in
some cells but not others. Let’s look at what McClintock did to figure out what was
going on in corn kernel color genetics.
Having already demonstrated crossing-over in maize (actually, another remarkable
achievement!), McClintock mapped the C’, Bz and Ds genes to Chromosome 9. She
then selectively mated corn with the genotypes shown in the protocol below.

Remember that triploid cell genotypes are being considered in this illustration! You
can refer to the phenotypic effects of the allelic backgrounds of three genes as we
follow McClintock’s cross. Her cross of a homozygous recessive with a homozygous
dominant plant should ring a bell! Let’s look more closely at this cross.
CMB3e

318

The expected triploid genotypes from the cross are shown below.

Illustration by G. Bergtrom

Aleurone cells resulting from this cross should all be colorless (yellow) because of the
presence of the dominant C’ allele. However, while there were indeed many
colorless kernels on the hybrid cob, there were also many mosaic kernels with dark
spots/streaks against a colorless background. McClintock’s interpretation of events is
illustrated below.

Illustration by G. Bergtrom

According to McClintock, if some aleurone layer cells in some kernels suffered
chromosome breakage at the Ds (Dissociator) locus (indicated by the double slash,
//), the C’ allele is inactivated. Without a functional C’ allele, the operative genotype

CMB3e

319

in the affected cells is CCbzbz. These cells then revert to making the brow pigment
as directed by the bz allele. When these cells divide, they create clusters of brown
cells surrounded by cells with an unbroken chromosome and thus an active C’ allele,
creating the appearance of pigment spots or streaks in the kernel, against the
otherwise colorless background in the surrounding cells.
243 Variegated Maize Kernels result from “Loss” of the Ds Gene
B. The Discovery of Mobile Genes: the Ac/Ds System
The experiments just described were reproducible using a single breeding stock of
maize. But when McClintock tried to repeat the experiments by crossing the
homozygous dominant males with homozygous recessive females from a different
breeding stock, all the kernels of the progeny cobs were colorless, as if the Ds gene
had not caused any chromosomal damage.
It seemed that the Ds gene contributed by the male was unable to function (i.e.,
‘break’) in females of this new breeding stock. McClintock hypothesized that the
female in the original cross must have contributed a factor that could somehow
activate the Ds gene to break, and that this factor, yet another gene, was absent or
inactive in the females of the new breeding stock. McClintock called the new factor
the activator, or Ac gene. Based on the dependence of Ds on the Ac locus,
McClintock recognized that these ‘genes’ were part of as a 2-element, Ac/Ds system
influencing mosaicism in maize kernels.
She then demonstrated that Ac-dependent Ds ‘breakage’ was in some cases also
associated with inactivation of a normal Bz gene, leading to a loss of purple color
kernels. It was at this point that McClintock concluded that far from simply ‘breaking’
the chromosome at a fragile Ds locus, the Ds gene had actually moved to (or into) the
Bz gene, disrupting its function. Again, this could not happen in the absence of an
active Ac gene. McClintock had discovered the first transposon, earning the 1983
Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine! With the advent of recombinant DNA
technologies, we now know that:
1. the Ds element is a transposon missing a gene for a transposase enzyme
required for transposition.
2. the Ac element has this gene and is capable of independent transposition.
3. Ac provides the transposase needed to mobilize itself and the Ds element.
4. the sequence similarity of Ds and Ac elements support their common ancestry.

CMB3e

320

The basic features of the maize Ac/Ds system are:
a) Ac is 4563 bp long
b) Ds is a truncated version of Ac.
c) There are eleven bp inverted repeats at either end of the Ac and Ds element
d) There are eight bp direct repeats (NOT inverted repeats) of ‘target DNA’ at
the site of insertion of either transposon.
Look for these features as we describe prokaryotic and eukaryotic transposons.

IV. Transposons Since McClintock
Transposons exist everywhere we look in prokaryotes and account for much of eukaryotic
repetitive DNA. As such, they can be a large proportion of eukaryotic genomes, including
some that no longer even transpose. Transposons were once considered useless or
junk DNA, with no obvious function…, or selfish genes with no other purpose than selfreplication. But in light of some new evidence, perhaps not!
As you will see, mechanisms of transposition share many features with DNA replication,
recombination and repair, and even viral infection. As you study these mechanisms, keep
in the back of your mind that transposition is often triggered by cellular stress.
A. Insertion Sequences (IS Elements)
Bacterial IS elements were the first mobile elements described after those in maize.
As we’ll see, they share some structural features of eukaryotic transposons.
Discovered in the late 1960s, many have been identified (IS1, IS2…, IS10 etc.).
Some are inserted into well-known genes (e.g., those of the lac operon), but most are
not, likely because there is little ‘extra’ DNA in the compact bacterial genome. Without
extra non-coding DNA to buffer against damaging mutations, few bacterial cells would
live to tell a tale of transposition! It should surprise us that IS elements can be made
to transpose in the lab, but are generally silent in nature.
Members of the IS element family vary in length from about 750 to 1425 bp. Within
this stretch of DNA lie transposase and resolvase genes whose products are
necessary for mobility. At either end of the IS element are inverted repeats, and
when found in either genomic or plasmid DNA, the IS sequence itself is flanked by

CMB3e

321

direct repeats of host genome or plasmid DNA that result from the mechanism of
transposition. Again, because of their compact genomes, bacteria can only tolerate
low copy numbers of IS elements in their genome or on plasmids (less than ten copies
and as few as one!). A typical IS element is illustrated below.

Illustration by G.
Bergtrom

B. Composite Transposons: Tn Elements
If a pair of IS elements should lie close to each other, separated by a short stretch of
genomic or plasmid DNA, they can transpose together, carrying the DNA between
them as part of a composite transposon, or Tn element. If some of the DNA
between IS elements in a Tn element contains antibiotic resistance genes, its
transposition can carry and spread these genes to other DNA in the cell. Tn elements
(like IS elements) are present in low copy number. A generic Tn element is drawn
below.

Illustration by G.
Bergtrom

Antibiotic resistance genes have the medical community worried; their spread has led
to antibiotic-resistant pathogens that cause diseases that are increasingly hard and
even impossible to treat. Earlier we saw genetic ‘transformation’ of streptococcal cells
CMB3e

322

that pick up virulence genes in DNA from dead cell. We routinely transform cells with
plasmids as part of recombinant DNA experiments. But bacteria can transfer plasmid
DNA between themselves quite naturally. During bacterial conjugation, an F (fertility)
plasmid normally transfers DNA between compatible bacterial mating types (review
bacterial conjugation elsewhere in this text for more details). An F plasmid containing
a Tn element harboring an antibiotic resistance gene can thus is passed from donor to
recipient during conjugation. The Tn element can transpose into to the recipient
bacterial genome. In this way, transposition is a major pathway for the transfer and
spread of antibiotic resistance.
C. Complex Transposons
Bacterial Complex Transposons also contain other genes in addition to those
required for mobility. Some complex transposons resemble a bacteriophage, or as in
the case of phage Mu, actually are phage! In fact, Mu can function either as an
infectious phage that reproduces in an infected cell, or as a transposon in the bacterial
genome. Transposon genes in Mu phage are illustrated below.

Illustration by G. Bergtrom

After infecting a bacterium, Mu can enter the lytic phase of its life cycle, replicating its
DNA, producing and ultimately releasing new infectious phage ‘particles’ by lysing the
host bacterial cell. Alternatively, like other phage, Mu can undergo lysogeny,
inserting its DNA into the host cell chromosome. Integrated copies of Mu might excise
and re-enter the lytic phase to produce more phage, particularly if some environmental
stress threatens host bacterial survival. But, a third lifestyle choice, transposition, is
available to Mu once the phage integrates into the bacterial chromosome. The three
lifestyle options for Mu phage are illustrated in the next few pages.

Lytic and lysogenic lifestyle options for Mu phage are shown below.

Mu phage DNA can act as a transposable element while in the lysogenic pathway, as
shown below.

As we turn to a description of eukaryotic transposons, look for similarities to bacterial IS
and Tn elements.

D. Overview of Eukaryotic Transposable Elements
There are two classes transposons in eukaryotes:
Class I (Retrotransposons) move/’jump’ by transcription of RNA at one locus,
followed by reverse transcription and integration of the cDNA back into genomic DNA
at a different location. Retrotransposons may be derived from (or be the source of)
retroviruses since active retroviruses excise from and integrate into DNA much like
retrotransposons. Retroposons are a sub-class of retrotransposons (see below).
Class II (DNA Transposons) move by one of two mechanisms. In the cut-&-paste
pathway, the transposon leaves one locus and integrates at another. In the replicative
pathway, the original transposon remains in place while new copies are mobile. The
table below shows the distribution and proportion of genomes represented by different
classes/types of transposable elements.

The table confirms that bacteria contain few transposons, while eukaryotes vary
widely in transposon load (transposons as a percentage of genomic DNA), from as
low as 4% to more than 70%.

CMB3e

326

The table below summarizes transposable elements by class, sub-type, size, genomic
distribution, mechanism of transposition, etc.

CMB3e

327

Between the two tables above, we can conclude the following:




Transposon load is not correlated with evolutionary complexity of organisms.
Shared transposons have different evolutionary histories in different organisms.
Where transposons remain active, they continue to shape genomic landscapes,
especially in organisms with a high transposons load.

We will revisit some of these conclusions later, after looking at the structure and
mechanism of mobility of different transposable elements.
247 Introduction to Eukaryotic Transposons
E. The Structure of Eukaryotic DNA (Class II) Transposons
Active eukaryotic DNA transposons share structural features with bacterial mobile
elements, including genes required for transposition, flanking inverted repeats and
flanking insertion-site direct repeats of host cell DNA. The characteristic structure of a
eukaryotic DNA transposon is shown below.

Illustration by G. Bergtrom

CMB3e

328

Class II transposons can ‘jump’ by cut-and-paste or replicative mechanisms.
Cut-and-paste transposition removes a copy from one location and moves
(transposes) it to another location. As its name suggests, replicative transposition
leaves a copy of the original transposon in place while inserting a new copy elsewhere
in the genome. Transposition by the cut-and-paste mechanism is diagrammed below.

Illustration by G. Bergtrom

Note that after transcription of the transposase gene, the enzyme nicks the DNA and
trims the 3’OH ends to create a staggered cut to excise the transposon. The
transposase actually brings the transposon ends together during the cut step and
mediates its insertion at a new DNA site. After ligation of the 3’OH ends of the
transposon to the 5’OH at the insertion site, replication replaces the missing bases,
generating the direct repeats of host cell genomic DNA at the insertion site. A final
ligation step completes transposition.
In the replicative transposition, the transposon also nicks and trims the DNA at its
source (original) insertion site. But, unlike the cut and paste mechanism, the source
transposon is not excised.

CMB3e

329

Details of the replicative mechanism of transposition is summarized below.

Illustration by G. Bergtrom

After nicking the 3’ ends of the transposon at the insertion site, transposase holds the
transposon ends together while catalyzing a hydrolytic attack of DNA at a new
insertion site. This is followed by priming of transposon strand replication from the
3’OH ends of the insertion site DNA strands. A cointegrate structure forms in which
each transposon copy has been made by semi-conservative replication. The
cointegrate is resolved by one of two recombinational mechanisms. The result leaves
copies of the transposon at both the original site and the new insertion site.
Let’s compare and contrast the features of cut-&-paste and replicative DNA
transposition. The common features are that:
 Transposon-encoded transposase binds, brings transposon ends together and
catalyzes single-stranded cleavage (hydrolysis) leaving ‘staggered ends’.
 Transposase holds the transposon ends together for the remaining steps.
The differences between the two mechanisms are that in cut & paste transposition, the
transposon is completely excised and then transposed to a new site in genomic DNA.
In contrast, after single stranded cleavage in replicative transposition, transposase-

CMB3e

330

bound free 3’ ends of the transposon hydrolyze both strands of stranded DNA at a
new insertion site. After ligation of the 3’ ends of transposon strands to 5’ ends of cut
genomic DNA insertion-site ends, the remaining 3’ ends of the insertion site DNA ends
prime replication of the transposon, forming the cointegrate, which is followed by its
resolution by one of two recombination pathways.
248 Eukaryotic Class II (DNA) Transposition
F. The Structures of Eukaryotic RNA (Class I) Transposons
Like DNA transposons, all RNA transposons leave insert-site footprints, i.e., direct
repeats of genomic DNA flanking the element. Unlike DNA transposons, active
eukaryotic Class I transposons move via an RNA intermediate. Also unlike DNA
transposons, they lack terminal inverted repeats.
The mobility of the RNA intermediate of all retrotransposons requires a promoter that
recognizes a reverse transcriptase enzyme as well as endonuclease and integrase
enzymes (to be described below). Autonomous Class I RNA transposons include
LTR retrotransposons (e.g., the yeast Ty element) as well as Non-LTR
retrotransposons). The latter include the autonomous LINEs (Long Interspersed
Nuclear Elements). The autonomous LTR and Non-LTR LINEs contain and express
genes needed for enzymes required for transposition. On the other hand, SINEs (a
sub-class of Non-LTR retrotransposons) lack genes for enzymes required for
transposition and therefore can’t transpose independently. Thus, they are nonautonomous retrotransposons that rely on “true” (autonomous) retrotransposon
activity for mobility. SINEs are sometimes called retroposons to distinguish them
from the autonomous retrotransposons.
249 Introduction to Features of Retrotransposition
Next we take a closer look at Retrotransposon structures and the genes and enzyme
activities required for retrotransposition.
1. LTR retrotransposons: The Yeast Ty element
The Ty transposon harbors several genes needed for transposition. These
include:
 the Gag gene that encodes group-specific antigen, a protein that forms a viruslike particle that will contain reverse-transcribed transposon DNA,
 the RT gene that encodes the reverse transcriptase that will make reversetranscribed copies of retrotransposon transcript RNAs.
CMB3e

331



the Prt gene that encodes a protease that will break down the virus-like particle
as the retrotransposon enters the nucleus.
 the Int gene that encodes the integrase required for integration of the
retrotransposon into a genomic DNA insertion site.
A representative Ty element is shown below as it would exist integrated into yeast
genomic DNA.

Long Terminal Repeats

In fact, many of the events in Ty transposition occur in the cytoplasmic “virus-like
particle” in yeast cells. To see more, click Virus-Like Particles in Ty Transposition.
Note that the Pol region in the illustration above consists of overlapping open
reading frames (ORFs) encoding the Prt, RT and Int genes. The ready-to-move
transposon consists only of the region of DNA symbolized in yellow.
250 LTR Retrotransposons-the Ty Element
2. Non-LTR Retrotransposons: LINEs
LINEs (Long Interspersed Nuclear Elements) also encode enzymes needed for
transposition and like other transposons, generate target-site direct repeats
flanking the inserted element. But they do not have the long terminal repeats!
Instead, their ORFs (genes) are flanked by 5’ and a 3’ untranslated regions
(UTRs).

CMB3e

332

The structure of the human L1 Line is drawn below.

Illustration by G. Bergtrom

The 5’ UTR contains a promoter from which cellular RNA polymerase II can
transcribe the downstream genes (see the Transcription chapter). The second of
these (ORF2) encodes the reverse transcriptase and an integrase activity essential
for transposition of the LINE. All Class I (RNA-intermediate) autonomous
transposons share the following features:
a) a Promoter in the 5’ UTR from which they can be transcribed
b) a Reverse Transcriptase that generates a cDNA copy of the transposable
element
c) RNAse H (an endonuclease) that degrades the transcript after reverse
transcription
d) Integrase (like a transposase) that catalyzes insertion of the retrotransposon
copy at insertion sites
251 Non-LTR Retrotransposons: LINEs
3. Non-LTR Retrotransposons: LINEs
Non-LTR SINE retrotransposons typically lack genes, but their non-genic DNA is
nonetheless flanked by 5’ and 3’ UTRs. RNA polymerase III, which also
transcribes transfer RNAs, also transcribes SINEs. However, to transpose, they
rely on the concurrent activity of a Non-LTR transposon (a LINE) to provide the
requisite enzymatic activities.

333

A typical SINE (e.g., the Alu element) is shown below.

252 Non-LTR Retrotransposons: SINEs

G. Mechanisms of Retrotransposition
There are two mechanisms of retrotransposition: Extrachromosomally Primed
Retrotransposition (LTR retrotransposons for example) and Insertion Target-Site
Primed Retrotransposition (non-LTR Retrotransposons like LINEs and SINEs).
These will be considered next.
1. Extrachromosomally Primed Retrotransposition (e.g., of a LINE)
As its name suggests, in extrachromosomally primed retrotransposition, a circular
reverse transcript of the retrotransposon attacks, nicks and integrates into a
genomic insertion site. In this mechanism, reverse transcriptase creates a cDNA
copy of a transcribed retro-element. Integrase/endonuclease then binds the cDNA
copy, holding the ends together, in effect circularizing it. This isolable
ribonucleoprotein resembles an intasome, a structure similar to the nucleoprotein
complex that catalyzes the integration of retroviral cDNAs during lysogeny.

CMB3e

334

Extrachromosomally primed retrotransposition is illustrated below.
Illustration by G. Bergtrom

The three-dimensional structure of a retroviral intasome interacting with DNA and
nucleosomes was recently determined (for more, see Retroviral Intasome 3D
Structure). In this form, the retrotransposon attacks DNA at an insertion site,
creating staggered ends. After insertion, the gaps in the DNA are filled in. Ligation
seals the retrotransposon in its new location, creating direct insertion site repeats.
253 Extrachromosomally Primed Retrotransposition
2. Target-Site Primed SINE Retrotransposition (e.g., of a SINE)
A key feature of target-site primed retrotransposition (retroposition) is the absence
of an integrase-bound, circular double-stranded reverse transcript. In SINE
transposition, RNA polymerase III (the same enzyme that catalyzes tRNA and 5S
rRNA transcription) transcribes the SINE. If a LINE is concurrently transcribed, its
enzymes will be made. When its integrase-endonuclease catalyzes hydrolysis of
one strand of DNA at a new insertion site, the 3’OH end of this strand can prime

CMB3e

335

reverse transcription of the one SINE cDNA strand by the LINE reverse
transcriptase. After hydrolysis of the second target site DNA strand, its 3’-OH end
primes replication of the second strand of the SINE cDNA. Integrase completes
insertion of the copy-SINE in its new genomic location. The target-site primed
retrotransposition mechanism of retrotransposition is illustrated below.

G. Bergtrom

254 Target Primed Retrotransposition

V. On the Evolution of Transposons, Genes and Genomes
We noted that transposons in bacteria carry antibiotic resistance genes, a clear example
of benefits of transposition in prokaryotes. Of course, prokaryotic genomes are small, as
is the typical bacterial transposon load. Yeast species also have low transposon load.
But, what can we make of the high transposon load in eukaryotes?
CMB3e

336

To many, the fact that genes encoding proteins typically represent only 1-2% of a
eukaryotic genome meant that the rest of the genome was informationally non-essential.
Even though transposons turn out to be much of the non-coding DNA in some eukaryotic
genomes, they seemed to serve no purpose other than their own replication. For many
organisms, large amounts of transposon DNA were dubbed selfish DNA and their genes,
selfish genes.
Are transposons just junk DNA, some kind of invasive or leftover genomic baggage?
Given their propensity to jump around and potential to raise havoc in genomes, how do
we tolerate and survive them? Is the sole ‘mission’ of transposons really just to
reproduce themselves? Or are transposons tolerated because they are neither selfish
nor junk? By their sheer proportions and activity in eukaryotic genomes, we will see that
transposons have dispersed into, and re-shaped genomic landscapes. Do the
consequences of transposition (relocation dispersal through a genome, structural
alteration and mutation of genes) have any functional or evolutionary value?
While all of these questions are a reasonable response to the phenomena of jumping
genes, a rational hypothesis would be that, like all genetic change, transposons began by
accident. But, their spread and ubiquity in genomes of higher organisms must in the long
term have been selected by virtue of some benefit that they provide to their host cells and
organisms. Let’s briefly looks at the evolutionary history of transposons to see if this
assumption has some merit.
A. A Common Ancestry DNA and RNA (i.e., All) Transposons
Transposases catalyze the cut-and-paste as well as the replicative transposition of
Class II (DNA) transposons. Integrases catalyze insertion of reverse-transcribed
retrotransposons. Bottom line: both enzymes end by catalyzing insertion of
transposons into new DNA locations. So, it should not be surprising that class I and II
transposons enzymes share similar amino acid sequence and domain structures.
These similarities support a common ancestry of class I and II transposons.
Sequence comparisons of transposable elements themselves reveal that they
comprise distinct families of related elements.
This allows us to speculate on the origins of these families in different species. For
example, the TC1/mariner (DNA) transposon is found in virtually all organisms
examined (except diatoms and green algae). Based on sequence analysis, there is
even an insertion element in bacteria related to the mariner element. This amount and
diversity of conservation bespeaks an early evolution of the enzymes of transposition,
and of transposition itself, within and even between species. Linear descent, or the
‘vertical” transmission of transposons from parents to progeny, is the rule. However,
the presence of similar transposons in diverse species is best explained by
CMB3e

337

interspecific DNA (“horizontal”) transfer. That is, a transposon in one organism must
have been the ‘gift’ of an organism of a different species! This is further discussed
below. Clearly, moveable genes have been a part of life for a long time, speaking
more to an adaptive value for organisms than to the parasitic action of a selfish, rogue
DNA!
B. Retroviruses and LTR Retrotransposons Share a Common Ancestry
The ‘integration’ domain of retrotransposons and retroviruses share significant
similarities as shown below.

Alternate amino acids conserved at several positions in these sequences are not shown.

The question raised by these observations is: Did transposons (specifically
retrotransposons) arise as defective versions of integrated retrovirus DNA (i.e.,
reverse transcripts of retroviral RNA)? Or, did retroviruses emerge when
retrotransposons evolved a way to leave their host cells. To approach this question,
let’s first compare mechanisms of retroviral infection and retrotransposition.
In addition to the structural similarities between the enzymes encoded by
retrotransposon and retroviral RNAs, LTR retrotransposons and retroviruses both
contain flanking long terminal repeats. However, retrotransposition occurs within the
nucleus of a cell while retroviruses must first infect a host cell before the retroviral
DNA can be replicated and new viruses produced (check out Visualizing Retroviral
Infection to see how immunofluorescence microscopy using antibodies to singlestranded cDNAs was used to track the steps of HIV infection!). A key structural
difference between retrotransposons and most retroviruses is an ENV gene-encoded
protein envelope surrounding retroviral DNA. After infection, the incoming retrovirus
sheds its envelope proteins and viral RNA is reverse transcribed. After the reverse
transcripts enter the nucleus, transcription of genes and translation of enzymes
CMB3e

338

necessary for the replication of the viral cDNA leads to the production of new
enveloped infectious viruses that will eventually lyse the infected cell. But…, here are
two curious phenomena:


Retroviral DNA, like any genomic DNA, is mutable. If a mutation inactivates one of
the genes required for infection and retroviral release, it could become an LTR
retrotransposon. Such a genetically damaged retroviral integrate might still be
transcribed and its mRNAs translated. If detected by its own reverse transcriptase,
the erstwhile viral genomes would be copied. The cDNAs, instead of being
packaged into infectious viral particles, would become a source of so-called
endogenous retroviruses (ERVs). In fact, ERVs exist, making up a substantial
portion of the mammalian genome (8% in humans)… and do in fact, behave like
LTR retrotransposons!



Yeast TY elements transcribe several genes during retrotransposition (see the list
above), producing not only reverse transcriptase and integrase, but also a
protease and a structural protein called Gag (Group-specific antigen). All of the
translated proteins enter the nucleus. Mimicking the retroviral ENV protein, the
Gag protein makes up most of a coat protein called VLP (virus-like particle). VLP
encapsulates additional retrotransposon RNA in the cytoplasm, along with the
other proteins. Double-stranded reverse transcripts (cDNAs) of the viral RNA are
then made within the VLPs. But, instead of bursting out of the cell, the
encapsulated cDNAs (i.e., new retrotransposons) shed their VLP coat and re-enter
the nucleus, where they can now integrate into genomic target DNA. Compare this
to the description of retroviral infection. During infection, retroviral envelope
proteins attach to cell membranes and release their RNA into the cytoplasm.
There, reverse transcriptase copies viral RNA into double-stranded cDNAs that
then enter the nucleus where they can integrate into host cell DNA. When
transcribed, the integrated retroviral DNA produces transcripts that are translated
in the cytoplasm into proteins necessary to form an infectious viral particle. The
resulting viral RNAs are encapsulated by an ENV (envelope) protein encoded in
the viral genome. Of course, unlike VLP-coated retrotransposon RNAs, the
enveloped viral RNAs do eventually lyse the host cell, releasing infectious
particles. Nevertheless, while VLP coated Ty elements are not infectious, they
sure do look like a retrovirus!

Common mechanisms of retrovirus and retrotransposon replication and integration
clearly support their common ancestry, but they do not indicate origins. On the one
hand, the origin of ERVs from retroviruses might imply an origin of retrotransposons
from retroviruses. On the other, transposons have been around since the earliest
prokaryotic cells, but that retrotransposons arose with eukaryotes. In that case, Type
II (DNA) transposable elements were around before retroviruses.

The phylogenetic analysis below is based on comparisons of retroviral and
retrotransposon reverse transcriptase gene DNA sequences.

Tree drawn by G. Bergtrom, based on data from
Nakamura et al. 1997 and Eickbush 1994

Comparisons of aligned DNA sequences permit evolutionary analyses that reflect
phylogenetic relationships of genes (in this case, retrotransposon and viral genes), in
much the same way the evolutionary biologists historically demonstrated evolutionary
relationships of plants and animals by comparing their morphological characteristics.

ancestry with Ted, 17.6 and Gypsy ERVs (boxed) in the ”Gypsi-TY3 subgroup”.
Further, this sub-group shares common ancestry with more distantly related
retroviruses (e.g., MMTV, HTLV…), as well as the even more distantly related (older,
longer diverged!) Copia-TY1 transposon sub-group. This and similar analyses
suggest strongly that retroviruses evolved from a retrotransposon lineage [For a
review of retroposon/retrovirus evolution, check Lerat P. & Capy P. (1999,
Retrotransposons and retroviruses: analysis of the envelope gene. Mol. Biol. Evol.
19(9): 1198-1207).
C. Transposons Can Be Acquired by “Horizontal Gene Transfer”
As noted, transposons are inherited vertically, meaning that they are passed from cell
to cell or parents to progeny by reproduction. But they also may have spread between
species by horizontal gene transfer. This just means that organisms exposed to
DNA containing transposons might inadvertently pick up such DNA and become
transformed as the transposon becomes part of the genome. Accidental mobility of
transposons between species would have been rare, but an exchange of genes by
horizontal gene transfer would have accelerated with the evolution of retroviruses.
Once again, despite the potential to disrupt the health an organism, retroviral activity
might also have supported a degree genomic diversity useful to organisms.
255 Transposon Evolution

VI. Roles of Transposition in Evolution and Diversity
A. Transposons and Exon Shuffling
A role for unequal recombination in moving exons in and out of different eukaryotic
split genes was described earlier. This kind of exon shuffling could happen when
short DNA sequences in two different introns misalign during meiotic synapsis,
allowing for unequal crossing over. Expression of a gene with a ‘new’ exon produces
a protein with a new domain and a new activity. If the event is not harmful, diversity is
increased!
When found in introns, transposons are long regions of DNA similarity that can
stabilize synapsis, increasing the chances of unequal recombination and exon
shuffling. For example, Alu (SINE) elements are often found within introns, where
they can integrate with no ill effect. The similarity of Alu elements in the introns of
unrelated genes does seem to account for exon shuffling by unequal crossing over
between the different genes that share domains and specific functions as a result.
CMB3e

341

Another way in which transposons facilitate germ line cell exon shuffling is more
direct. Imagine a pair of transposons in introns of a gene on either side of an exon.
Should such transposons behave like the two outer IS elements in a bacterial Tn
element (discussed above), they might be excised as a single, large transposon
containing an exon. The paired transposons flanking the exon might then insert in an
intron of a completely different gene! This possibility is illustrated on the next page.
Transposon-mediated exon shuffling can explain insertion of exon-encoded domains
of epidermal growth factor (EGF) into several unrelated genes. The mitogen EGF was
discovered because it stimulated skin cells to start dividing. The gene for TPA (tissue
plasminogen activator, a blood-clot dissolving protease) shares EGF gene domains.
TPA is a treatment for heart attack victims that, if administered rapidly after the attack,
can dissolve the clot and allow coronary artery blood flow to heart muscle to resume.
Other genes that contain EGF domains include those for Neu and Notch proteins, both
involved in cellular differentiation and development.
Some exon shuffling events may have been mediated by LINE transposition and by a
special group of recently discovered transposons called helitrons. Helitrons replicate
by a rolling circle mechanism. If you are curious about helitrons, do a google search
to learn more about them, and what role they may have had in refashioning and
reconstructing genomes in evolution. The general pathway of exon shuffling involving
paired proximal DNA transposons is illustrated below.

Illustration by G.
Bergtrom

In the generic example shown above, exon 2 of gene A has been inserted, along with
flanking transposons, into another gene (gene B).

CMB3e

342

B. Transposon Genes and Immune System Genes Have History
Several important eukaryotic genes may have been derived from transposons.
Perhaps the most intriguing example of this is to be found in the complex vertebrate
immune system. Our immune system includes immunoglobulins (antibodies). You
inherited genes for immunoglobulin proteins from your parents.
These genes contain multiple variant V, D, and J regions linked to a C region. V, D, J
and C are defined as Variable, Joining, Diversity and Constant DNA regions,
respectively. They will recombine to create many diverse V-D-J-C immunoglobulin
antibody molecules (the D region is not always included in the final recombined gene).
These gene rearrangements occur during the maturation of certain stem cells in bone
marrow that will become immune cells (B or T lymphocytes). In response to a
challenge by foreign substances called antigens, cells will be selected that contain
rearranged immunoglobulin genes coding for immunoglobulins that can recognize,
bind and eliminate the invading antigens.
A discussion of the molecular biology of the immune system is beyond our scope
here. Suffice it to say that the recombinational pathway of immunoglobulin gene
rearrangements includes enzymatic activities very similar to those of transposition. In
fact, the so-called RAG1 enzyme active in immunoglobulin gene rearrangement is
closely related to genes in a family of transposons (transib) found in invertebrates and
fungi. Thus, it looks like genes of the immune system might have their origins in a
transposon!

VII. Coping with the Dangers of Rampant Transposition
Most organisms do not have the high transposon load that we have. For those like us,
and given a general tendency of transposons to insert at random into new DNA loci, how
come we exist at all? Isn’t the danger of transposition into essential gene sequences
magnified by the possibility of multiple simultaneous transpositions of elements generated
by cut-and-paste and especially replicative mechanisms? Indeed, transposons have
been found in genes that are inactive as a result.
An obvious explanation for our survival of transposon activity is that most transposition is
into the >90% percent of the genome that does not code for proteins. Another is that
eukaryotic organisms have two copies of every gene, so that if one is inactive, the other
may sustain us. Beyond this, several mechanisms exist to silence a transposon after
transposition has occurred, mitigating the dangers of rampant transposition. As long as a
transposition is not lethal (e.g., because its integration disrupts an activity essential to
life), the cell and organisms can survive the event. In time, mutations at the ends of

CMB3e

343

transposons or in genes responsible for transposition would render them inactive. Finally,
there may be a more direct curb on transposition. The small interfering RNAs (siRNAs)
we encountered earlier could complement and target viral RNAs for destruction (see the
Transcription chapter for more information on siRNAs). There is some evidence that
siRNAs similarly target transposon transcripts.
Summing up, transposon activity is moderated by mutational loss of function and/or by
more direct mechanisms that limit transposition and thus genetic damage. If an
accumulation of transposons to a high load, as occurs in many species, were deleterious,
they would be limited or eliminated from genomes. Instead, persistent transposons and
acts of transposition are largely neutral, increasing options for diversity in the selection of
new genotypes and phenotypic characteristics. We also know now that transposons can
function in genetic regulation. Thus, transposons are neither selfish nor junk DNA. Check
out these links for more: Not junk after all? and Eulogy for Junk DNA.

Overview

We start this chapter by looking at technologies that led to genetic engineering. The
ability of make recombinant DNA is such a seminal technology that just realizing it could
be done and then doing it in a test tube for the first time earned Paul berg a half-share in
the 1980 Nobel Prize in Chemistry (the other half was shared by Walter Gilbert and
Frederick Sanger for studies that enabled efficient DNA sequencing). First we’ll look at
cDNA synthesis, the synthesis of DNA copies from RNA, something retroviruses routinely
do as part of the pathway of their reproduction. The retrovirus injects its RNA into target
cells where it transcribes a reverse transcriptase enzyme. The enzyme reversetranscribes a copy DNA (the cDNA) complementary to the viral RNA. The First steps in
retroviral infection is summarized in the illustration below.

Illustration by G. Bergtrom

The same reverse transcriptase enzyme makes a double stranded cDNA, or (ds)cDNA,
which then replicates. These cDNAs are transcribed into new viral RNA genomes and
mRNAs for viral proteins. The latter encapsulate the RNA genomes into new viruses.
Reverse transcriptase is now a laboratory tool, used to reverse transcribe cDNA from
virtually any RNA sequence. It, along with many viral, bacterial and even eukaryotic
enzymes and biomolecules, are now part of our recombinant DNA and genetic
engineering toolkit.
CMB3e

346

We will see how a cDNA library is made and screened for a cDNA clone, and how a
cloned cDNA can fish an entire gene out of a genomic library. Next we will see how the
polymerase chain reaction (PCR) can produce (amplify) millions of copies of a single
gene (or other DNA sequence) from as little DNA as is found in a single cell. Apart from
its well-publicized use in forensics, PCR is another important laboratory tool for fetching,
amplifying and studying sequences of interest. These venerable technologies illustrate
important principles of cloning and sequence analysis. Of course, the analysis of
traditionally cloned and amplified DNA sequences has been used to study the evolution
and expression of individual genes. And sometimes we are misled! For example,
knowing that a genetic mutation is associated with an illness usually leads to a search for
how the mutation might cause the illness. But, as researchers in any discipline keep
warning us, correlation is not causation! In fact, we know that many phenotypes,
including genetic disease, are not the result of a single mutant gene. Autism is just one
example.
The newer fields of genomics and proteomics leverage a growing battery of powerful
tools to study many genes and their regulatory networks at the same time. The
molecular networking made possible by genomics and proteomics (and other colorful
holistic terms we’ll discuss later) promise to get us past naïve and often incorrect notions
of causation. We may be soon able to identify many correlations that might sum up to
causation or propensity to genetic illness.

II.

Make and Screen a cDNA Library

The first step in making a cDNA library is to isolate cellular mRNA. This mRNA extract
should represent all of the transcripts in the cells at the time of isolation, or the cell’s
transcriptome. This term is used by analogy to genome. However, a genome is all of
the genetic information of an organism. In contrast, a transcriptome (usually eukaryotic)
reflects all of the genes expressed in a given cell type at a moment in time. Reversetranscribed cDNAs from an mRNA extract are also referred to as a transcriptome…, and
likewise, a cDNA library. A cDNA library is a tube full of bacterial cells that have taken up
(i.e., been transformed with) plasmids recombined with cDNAs. cDNA libraries made
from mRNAs taken from different cell types or the same cells grown under different
conditions are in effect, different transcriptomes. Each reflects mRNAs transcribed in
cells at the moment of their extraction. When cells in a cDNA library are spread out on a
nutrient agar petri dish, each cell grows into a colony of cells; each cell in the colony is a
clone of a starting cell. cDNA libraries can be used isolate and sequence the DNA
encoding a polypeptide that you are studying.
Recall that the mature mRNA in eukaryotic cells has been spliced. This means that
cDNAs from eukaryotic cells do not include introns. Introns, as well as sequences of
enhancers and other regulatory elements in and surrounding a gene must be studied in
genomic libraries, to be discussed later. Here we look at how to make a cDNA library.
A. cDNA construction
mRNA is only a few percent of a eukaryotic cell; most is rRNA. But that small amount
of mRNA can be separated from other cellular RNAs by virtue of their 3’ poly(A) tails.
Simply pass a total RNA extract over an oligo-d(T) column (illustrated below).

Illustration by G. Bergtrom

CMB3e

348

The strings of thymidine (T) can H-bond with the poly(A) tails of mRNAs, tethering
them to the column. All RNAs without a 3’ poly(A) tail will flow through the column as
waste. A second buffer is passed over the column to destabilize the A-T H-bonds to
allow elution of an mRNA fraction. When free’ oligo d(T) is added to the eluted
mRNA, it forms H-bonds with the poly(A) tails of the mRNAs, serving as a primer for
the synthesis of cDNA copies of the poly(A) mRNAs originally in the cells. Finally, four
deoxynucleotide DNA precursors and reverse transcriptase (originally isolated from
chicken retrovirus-infected cells) are added to start reverse transcription. The
synthesis of a cDNA strand complementary to an mRNA is shown below.

Illustration by G. Bergtrom

After heating to separate the cDNAs from the mRNAs, the cDNA is replicated to
produce double-stranded, or (ds)cDNA, as illustrated below.

Illustration by G. Bergtrom

CMB3e

349

Synthesis of the second cDNA strand is also catalyzed by reverse transcriptase! The
enzyme recognizes DNA as well as RNA templates, and has the same 5’-to-3’ DNA
polymerizing activity as DNA polymerases. After 2nd cDNA strand synthesis,
S1 nuclease (a single-stranded endonuclease originally isolated from an East Asian
fungus!) is added to open the loop of the (ds) cDNA structure and trim the rest of the
single-stranded DNA. What remains is the (ds) cDNA.
258 Isolate mRNA and Make cDNA

259 Reverse Transcriptase

B. Cloning cDNAs into plasmid vectors
To understand cDNA cloning and other aspects of making recombinant DNA, we need
to talk a bit more about the recombinant DNA tool kit. In addition to reverse
transcriptase and S1 nuclease, other necessary enzymes in the ‘kit’ include
restriction endonucleases (restriction enzymes) and DNA ligase. The natural
function of restriction enzymes in bacteria is to recognize specific restriction site
sequences in phage DNA (most often palindromic DNA sequences), hydrolyze it and
thus avoid infection.
Restriction enzymes that make a scissors cut through the two strands of the double
helix leaves blunt ends. Restriction enzymes that make a staggered cut on each
strand at their restriction site leave behind complementary (‘sticky’) ends (below).

Illustration by
G. Bergtrom

If you mix two of double-stranded DNA fragments with the same sticky ends from
different sources (e.g., different species), they will form H-bonds at their
complementary ends, making it easy to recombine plasmid DNA with (ds)cDNA, that
have the same complementary ‘sticky ends’. Using the language of recombinant DNA
technologies, let’s look at how plasmid vectors and cDNAs can be made to recombine.

CMB3e

350

1. Preparing recombinant plasmid vectors containing cDNA inserts
Vectors are carrier DNAs engineered to recombine with foreign DNAs of interest.
When a recombinant vector with its foreign DNA insert gets into a host cell, it can
replicate many copies of itself, enough in fact for easy isolation and study. cDNAs
are typically inserted into plasmid vectors that are usually purchased “off-the-shelf”.
They can be cut with a restriction enzyme at a suitable location, leaving those
sticky ends. On the other hand, it would not do to digest (ds)cDNA with restriction
endonucleases since the goal is not to clone cDNA fragments, but entire cDNA
molecules. Therefore, it will be necessary to attach linkers to either end of the
(ds)cDNAs. Plasmid DNAs and cDNA-linker constructs can then be digested with
the same restriction enzyme to produce compatible ‘sticky ends’. Steps in the
preparation of vector and (ds)cDNA for recombination are shown below.

Illustration by G. Bergtrom

To prepare for recombination, a plasmid vector is digested with a restriction
enzyme to open the DNA circle. To have compatible sticky ends, double-stranded
cDNAs to be inserted are mixed with linkers and DNA ligase to put a linker DNA at

CMB3e

351

both ends of the (ds) cDNA. DNA ligase is another tool in the recombinant DNA
toolkit. Linkers are short, synthetic double-stranded DNA oligomers containing
restriction sites recognized and cut by the same restriction enzyme as the plasmid.
Once the linkers are attached to the ends of the plasmid DNAs, they are digested
with the appropriate restriction enzyme. This leaves both the (ds)cDNAs and the
plasmid vectors with complementary sticky ends.
260 Restriction Enzymes and Recombinant DNA
2. Recombining plasmids and cDNA inserts and transforming host cells
The next step is to mix the cut plasmids with the digested linker-cDNAs in just the
right proportions so that the most of the cDNA (linker) ends will anneal (form Hbonds) with the most of the sticky plasmid ends. Adding DNA ligase to the
plasmid/linker-cDNA mixture forms phosphodiester bonds between plasmid and
cDNA insert, completing the recombinant circle of DNA, as shown below.

Illustration by G. Bergtrom

CMB3e

352

In early cloning experiments, an important consideration was to generate plasmids
with only one copy of a given cDNA insert, rather than lots of re-ligated
plasmids with no inserts or lots of plasmids with multiple inserts. Using betterengineered vector and linker combinations, this issue became less important.

261 Recombine a cDNA Insert with a Plasmid Vector
3. Transforming host cells with recombinant plasmids
The recombinant DNA molecules are now ready for ‘cloning’. They are added to
E. coli (sometimes other host cells) made permeable so that they can be easily
transformed. Recall that transformation as defined by Griffith is bacterial uptake
of foreign DNA leading to a genetic change. The transforming principle in
cloning is the recombinant plasmid! The transformation step is shown below.
Illustration by G. Bergtrom

The tube full of transformed cells is the cDNA library.

262 Making the cDNA Library

CMB3e

353

After all these treatments, not all plasmid molecules in the mix are recombinant;
some cells in the mix haven’t even taken up a plasmid. So when the recombinant
cells are plated on agar, how do you tell which of the colonies that grow came from
cells that took up a recombinant plasmid? Both the host strain of E. coli and
plasmid vectors used these days were further engineered to solve this problem.
One such plasmid vector carries an antibiotic resistance gene. In this case,
ampicillin-sensitive cells would be transformed with recombinant plasmids
containing the resistance gene. When these cells are plated on media containing
ampicillin (a form of penicillin), they grow, as illustrated below.

Illustration by G. Bergtrom

Untransformed cells (cells that failed to take up a plasmid) lack the ampicillin
resistance gene and thus, do not grow on ampicillin-medium. But, there is still a
question. How can you tell whether the cells that grew were transformed by a
recombinant plasmid containing a cDNA insert? It is possible that some of the
transformants contain only non-recombinant plasmids that still have the ampicillin
resistance gene!
To address this question, plasmids were further engineered with a streptomycin
resistance gene. But this antibiotic resistance gene was also engineered to
contain restriction enzyme sites in the middle of the gene. Thus, inserting a cDNA
in this plasmid would disrupt and inactivate the gene. Here is how this second bit

CMB3e

354

of genetic engineering enabled growth only of cells transformed with a recombinant
plasmid containing a cDNA insert. We can tell transformants containing
recombinant plasmids apart from those containing non-recombinant plasmids by
the technique of replica plating shown (illustrated below).

Illustration by G. Bergtrom

After colonies grow on the ampicillin agar plate, lay a filter over the plate. The filter
will pick up a few cells from each colony, in effect becoming a replica (mirror
image) of the colonies on the plate. Place the replica filter on a new agar plate
containing streptomycin; the new colonies that grow on the filter must be
streptomycin-resistant, containing only non-recombinant plasmids. Colonies
containing recombinant plasmids, those that did not grow in streptomycin are
easily identified on the original ampicillin agar plate. In practice, highly efficient

CMB3e

355

recombination and transformation procedures typically reveal very streptomycinresistant cells (i.e., colonies) after replica plating. In this case, ampicillin-resistant
cells constitute a good cDNA library, ready for screening.
263 Making a Replica Plate Filter
4. Identifying colonies containing plasmids with inserts of interest
The next step is to screen the colonies from the cDNA library for those containing
the specific cDNA that you’re after. This typically begins preparing multiple replica
filters like the one above. Remember, these filters are replicas of bacterial cells
containing recombinant plasmids that grow on ampicillin but not streptomycin.
The number of replica filters that must be screened can be calculated from
assumptions and formulas for estimating how many colonies must be screened to
represent an entire transcriptome (i.e., the number of different mRNAs in the
original cellular mRNA source). Once the requisite number of replica filters are
made, they are subjected to in situ lysis to disrupt cell walls and membranes.
The result is that the cell contents are released and the DNA is denatured (i.e.,
becomes single-stranded). The DNA then adheres to the filter in place (in situ,
where the colonies were). The result of in situ lysis is a filter with faint traces of the
original colony (below).

Illustration by
G. Bergtrom

CMB3e

356

Next, a molecular probe is used to identify DNA containing the sequence of
interest. The probe is often a synthetic oligonucleotide whose sequence was
inferred from known amino acid sequences. These oligonucleotides are made
radioactive and placed in a bag with the filter(s). DNA from cells that contained
recombinant plasmids with a cDNA of interest will bind the complementary probe.
The results of in situ lysis and hybridization of a radioactive probe to a replica
filter are shown below.

Illustration by G. Bergtrom

264 Probing a Replica Plate Filter
The filters are rinsed to remove un-bound radioactive oligomer probe, and then
placed on X-ray film. After a period of exposure, the film is developed. Black
spots will form on the film from radioactive exposure, creating an autoradiograph of
the filter.

CMB3e

357

The black spots in the autoradiograph correspond to colonies on a filter that
contain a recombinant plasmid with your target cDNA sequence (below).

Illustration by G. Bergtrom

Once a positive clone is identified on the film, the corresponding recombinant
colony is located on the original plate. This colony is grown up in a liquid culture
and the plasmid DNA is isolated. At that point, the cloned plasmid DNA can be
sequenced and the amino acid sequence encoded by its cDNA can be inferred
from the genetic code dictionary to verify that the cDNA insert in fact encodes the
protein of interest. Once verified as the sequence of interest, a cloned plasmid
cDNA can be made radioactive or fluorescent, and used to
 probe for the genes from which they originated.
 identify and quantitate the mRNA even locate the transcripts in the cells.
 quantitatively measure amounts of specific mRNAs.
Isolated plasmid cDNAs can even be expressed in suitable cells to make the
encoded protein. These days, diabetics no longer receive pig insulin, but get
synthetic human insulin human made from expressed human cDNAs. Moreover,
while the introduction of the polymerase chain reaction (PCR, see below) has
superseded some uses of cDNAs, they still play a role in genome-level and
transcriptome-level studies.

III. DNA sequencing
A. A Brief History of DNA Sequencing
RNA sequencing came first, when Robert Holley sequenced a tRNA in 1965. The
direct sequencing of tRNAs was possible because tRNAs are small, short nucleic
acids, and because many of the bases in tRNAs are chemically modified after
transcription. An early method for DNA sequencing developed by Walter Gilbert and
colleagues involved DNA fragmentation, sequencing of the small fragments of DNA,
and then aligning the overlapping sequences of the short fragments to assemble
longer sequences. Another method, the DNA synthesis-based ‘dideoxy’ DNA
sequencing technique, was developed by Frederick Sanger in England. Sanger and
Gilbert both won a Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1983 for their DNA sequencing efforts.
However, because of its simplicity, Sanger’s method quickly became the standard for
sequencing all manner of cloned DNAs.
The first complete genome to be sequenced was that of a bacteriophage (bacterial
virus) called φX174. At the same time as the advances in sequencing technology
were occurring, so were some of the early developments in recombinant DNA
technology. Together these led to more efficient and rapid cloning and sequencing of
DNA from increasingly diverse sources. The first focus was of course on genes and
genomes of important model organisms, such as E. coli, C. elegans, yeast (S.
cerevisiae)…, and of course us! By 1995, Craig Venter and colleagues at the
Institute for Genomic Research had completed the sequence of an entire bacterial
genome (Haemophilus influenzae) and by 2001, Venter’s private group along with
Frances Collins and colleagues at the NIH had published a first draft of the sequence
of the human genome. Venter had proven the efficacy of a whole-genome
sequencing approach called shotgun sequencing, which was much faster than the
gene-by-gene, fragment-by-fragment ‘linear’ sequencing strategy being used by other
investigators (more later!). Since Sanger’s dideoxynucleotide DNA sequencing
method remains a common and economical methodology, let’s consider the basics of
the protocol.
B. Details of DiDeoxy Sequencing
Given a template DNA (e.g., a plasmid cDNA), Sanger used in vitro replication
protocols to demonstrate that he could:
1. replicate DNA under conditions that randomly stopped nucleotide addition at every
possible position in growing strands.
2. separate and then detect these DNA fragments of replicated DNA.

CMB3e

359

Recall that DNA polymerases catalyze the formation of phosphodiester bonds by
linking the  phosphate of a nucleotide triphosphate to the free 3’ OH of a
deoxynucleotide at the end of a growing DNA strand. Recall also that the ribose sugar
in the deoxynucleotide precursors of replication lack a 2’ OH (hydroxyl) group.
Sanger’s trick was to add dideoxynucleotide triphosphates to his in vitro replication
mix. The ribose on a dideoxynucleotide triphosphate (ddNTP) lacks a 3’ OH, in
addition to the 2’ OH group (as shown below).

Illustration by G. Bergtrom

Adding a dideoxynucleotide to a growing DNA strand stops replication. No further
nucleotides can add to the 3’-end of the replicating DNA strand because the 3’–OH
necessary for the dehydration synthesis of the next phosphodiester bond is absent!
Because they can stop replication in actively growing cells, ddNTPs such as
dideoxyadenosine (tradename, cordycepin) are anti-cancer chemotherapeutic drugs.
266 Treating Cancer with Dideoxynucleosides
A look at a manual DNA sequencing protocol reveals what is going on in the
sequencing reactions. Four reaction tubes are set up, each containing the template
DNA to be sequenced, a primer of known sequence and the four required
deoxynucleotide precursors necessary for replication.

CMB3e

360

The set-up for manual DNA sequencing is shown below.

Illustration by G. Bergtrom

A different ddNTP, (ddATP, ddCTP, ddGTP or ddTTP) is added to each of the four
tubes. Finally, DNA polymerase is added to each tube to start the DNA synthesis
reaction. During DNA synthesis, different length fragments of new DNA accumulate
as the ddNTPs incorporate randomly, opposite complementary bases in the template
DNA being sequenced. The expectations of the didieoxy sequencing reactions in the
four tubes are illustrated below.

Illustration by G. Bergtrom

CMB3e

361

A short time after adding the DNA polymerase to begin the reactions, the mixture is
heated to separate the DNA strands and fresh DNA polymerase is added to repeat the
synthesis reactions. These sequencing reactions are repeated as many as 30 times
in order to produce enough radioactive DNA fragments to be detected. When the
heat-stable Taq DNA polymerase from the thermophilic bacterium Thermus
aquaticus became available ( more later!), it was no longer necessary to add fresh
DNA polymerase after each replication cycle. The many heating and cooling cycles
required for what became known as chain-termination DNA sequencing were soon
automated using inexpensive programmable thermocyclers.
Since a small amount of a radioactive deoxynucleotide (usually 32P-labeled ATP) was
present in each reaction tube, the newly made DNA fragments are radioactive. After
electrophoresis to separate the new DNA fragments in each tube, autoradiography of
the electrophoretic gel reveals the position of each terminated fragment. The DNA
sequence can then be read from the gel as illustrated in the simulated autoradiograph
below.

Illustration by G. Bergtrom

CMB3e

362

As shown in the cartoon, the DNA sequence can be read by reading the bases from
the bottom of the gel, starting with the C at the bottom of the C lane. Try reading the
sequence yourself!
267 Manual Dideoxy Sequencing
The first semi-automated DNA sequencing method was invented in Leroy Hood’s
California lab in 1986. Though still Sanger sequencing, the four dideoxynucleotides in
the sequencing reaction were tagged for detection with a fluorescent dyes instead
radioactive phosphate-tagged nucleotides. After the sequencing reactions, the
reaction products are electrophoresed on an ‘automated DNA sequencer’. UV light
excites the migrating dye-terminated DNA fragments as they pass through a detector.
The color of their fluorescence is detected, processed and sent to a computer,
generating color-coded graph like the one below, showing the order (and therefore
length) of fragments passing the detector and thus, the sequence of the strand.

A most useful feature of this sequencing method is that a template DNA could be
sequenced in a single tube, containing all the required components, including all four
dideoxynucleotides! That’s because the fluorescence detector in the sequencing
machine separately sees all the short ddNTP-terminated fragments as they move
through the electrophoretic gel.
Hood’s innovations were quickly commercialized making major sequencing projects
possible, including whole genome sequencing. The rapidity of automated DNA
sequencing led to the creation of large sequence databases in the U.S. and Europe.

The NCBI (National Center for Biological Information) maintains the U.S. database.
Despite its location, the NCBI archives virtually all DNA sequences determined
worldwide. New ‘tiny’ DNA sequencers have made sequencing DNA so portable that
in 2016, one was even used in the International Space Station. Expanding databases
and new tools and protocols (some are described below) to find, compare and analyze
DNA sequences have also grown rapidly.
268 Automated Sequencing Leads to Large Genome Projects
C. Large scale sequencing
Large-scale sequencing targets entire prokaryotic, and typically much larger
eukaryotic genomes. The latter require strategies that either sequence long DNA
fragments and/or sequencing DNA fragments more quickly. We already noted the
shotgun sequencing used by Venter to sequence smaller and larger genomes
(including our own… or more accurately, his own!). In shotgun sequencing, cloned
DNA fragments 1000 base pairs or longer are broken down at random into smaller,
more easily sequenced fragments. The fragments are themselves cloned and
sequenced and non-redundant sequences are assembled by aligning overlapping
regions of sequence. Today’s computer software is quite adept at rapid overlapping
sequence alignment as well as connecting and displaying long contiguous DNA
sequences. Shotgun sequencing is summarized below.

Sequence gaps that remain after shotgun sequencing can be filled in by primer
walking, in which a known sequence near the gap is the basis of creating a
sequencing primer to “walk” into the gap region on an intact DNA that has not been
fragmented. Another ‘gap-filling’ technique involves PCR (the Polymerase Chain
Reaction, to be described shortly). Briefly, two oligonucleotides are synthesized based
on sequence information on either side of a gap. Then PCR is used to synthesize the
missing fragment, and the fragment is sequenced to fill in the gap.

IV.

Genomic Libraries

A genomic library might be a tube full of recombinant bacteriophage. Each phage
DNA molecule contains a fragmentary insert of cellular DNA from a foreign organism.
The library is made to contain a representation of all of possible fragments of that
genome. Bacteriophage are often used to clone genomic DNA fragments because:
•
•
•

phage genomes are bigger than plasmids and can be engineered to remove a large
amount of DNA that is not needed for infection and replication in bacterial host cells.
the missing DNA can thus be replaced by foreign insert DNA fragments as long as 1820kbp (kilobase pairs), nearly 20X as long as typical cDNA inserts in plasmids.
purified phage coat proteins can be mixed with the recombined phage DNA to make
infectious phage particles that would infect host bacteria, replicate lots of new
recombinant phage, and then lyse the cells to release the phage.

The need for vectors like bacteriophage that can accommodate long inserts becomes
obvious from the following bit of math. A typical mammalian genome consists of more
than 2 billion base pairs. Inserts in plasmids are very short, rarely exceeding 1000 base
pairs. Dividing 2,000,000,000 by 1000, you get 2 million, a minimum number of phage
clones that must be screened to find a sequence of interest. In fact, you would need
many more than this number of clones to find a gene (or parts of one!). Of course, part of
the solution to this “needle in a haystack” dilemma is to clone larger DNA inserts in more
accommodating vectors.
From this brief description, you may recognize the common strategy for genetically
engineering a cloning vector: determine the minimum properties that your vector must
have and remove non-essential DNA sequences. Consider the Yeast Artificial
Chromosome (YAC), hosted by (replicated in) yeast cells. YACs can accept humongous
foreign DNA inserts! This is because to be a chromosome that will replicate in a yeast
cell requires one centromere and two telomeres… and little else!

CMB3e

365

Recall that telomeres are needed in replication to keep the chromosome from shortening
during replication of the DNA. The centromere is needed to attach chromatids to spindle
fibers so that they can separate during anaphase in mitosis (and meiosis). So along with
a centromere and two telomeres, just include restriction sites to enable recombination
with inserts as long as 2000 Kbp. That’s a YAC! The tough part of course is keeping a
2000Kbp long DNA fragment intact long enough to get it into the YAC.
However a vector is engineered and chosen, sequencing its insert can tell us many
things. They can show us how a gene is regulated by revealing known and uncovering
new regulatory DNA sequences. They can tell us what other genes are nearby, and
where genes are on chromosomes. Genomic DNA sequences from one species can
probe for similar sequences in other species and comparative sequence analysis can
then tell us a great deal about gene evolution and the evolution of species.
One early surprise from gene sequencing studies was that we share many common
genes and DNA sequences with other species, from yeast to worms to flies… and of
course vertebrates and our more closely related mammal friends. You may already know
that the chimpanzee’s and our genomes are 99% similar. Moreover, we have already
seen comparative sequence analysis showing how proteins with different functions
nevertheless share structural domains.
Let’s look at cloning a genomic library in phage. As you will see, the principles are similar
to cloning a foreign DNA into a plasmid, or in fact any other vector, but the numbers and
details used here exemplify cloning in phage.
A. Preparing Genomic DNA of a Specific Length for Cloning
To begin with, high molecular weight (i.e., long molecules of) the desired genomic
DNA are isolated, purified and then digested with a restriction enzyme. Usually, the
digest is partial, aiming to generate overlapping DNA fragments of random length.
When the digest is electrophoresed on agarose gels, the DNA (stained with ethidium
bromide, a fluorescent dye that binds to DNA) looks like a bright smear on the gel. All
of the DNA could be recombined with suitably digested vector DNA. But, to further
reduce the number of clones to be screened for a sequence of interest, early cloners
would generate a Southern blot (named after Edward Southern, the inventor of the
technique) to determine the size of genomic DNA fragments most likely to contain a
desired gene.

CMB3e

366

Beginning with a gel of genomic DNA restriction digests, the Southern blot protocol is
illustrated below.

Illustration by G. Bergtrom

To summarize the steps,
a) Digest genomic DNA with one or more restriction endonucleases.
b) Run the digest products on an agarose gel to separate fragments by size (length).
The DNA appears as a smear when stained with a fluorescent dye.
c) Place a filter on the gel. The DNA transfers (blots) to the filter for e.g., 24 hours.
d) Remove the blotted filter and place it in a bag containing a solution that can
denature the DNA.
e) Add radioactive probe (e.g., cDNA) containing the gene or sequence of interest.
The probe hybridizes (bind) to complementary genomic sequences on the filter.
f) Prepare an autoradiograph of the filter and see a ‘band’ representing the size of
genomic fragments of DNA that include the sequence of interest.

CMB3e

367

Once you know the size (or size range) of restriction digest fragments that contain the
DNA you want to study, you are ready to
a) run another gel of digested genomic DNA.
b) cut out the piece of gel containing the fragments that ‘lit up’ with your probe in the
autoradiograph.
c) remove (elute) the DNA from the gel piece into a suitable buffer.
d) prepare the DNA for insertion into (recombination with) a genomic cloning vector.
B. Recombining Size-Restricted Genomic DNA with Phage DNA
After elution of restriction digested DNA fragments of the right size range from the
gels, the DNA is mixed with compatibly digested phage DNA at concentrations that
favor the formation of H-bonds between the ends of the phage DNA and the genomic
fragments. Addition of DNA ligase covalently links the recombined DNA molecules.
These steps are abbreviated in the illustration below.

Illustration by G.
Bergtrom

The recombinant phage that are made next will contain sequences that become the
genomic library.

CMB3e

368

C. Creating Infectious Viral Particles with Recombinant phage DNA
The next step is to package the recombined phage DNA with added purified viral coat
proteins to make infectious phage particles (below).
Illustration by G. Bergtrom

269 Genomic Libraries: Make and Package Recombinant Phage DNA
Packaged phage are added to a culture tube full of host bacteria (typically E. coli).
After infection, the recombinant DNA enters the cells where it replicates and directs
the production of new phage that eventually lyse the host cell (illustrated below).

Illustration by G. Bergtrom

CMB3e

369

The recombined vector can also be introduced directly into the host cells by
transduction (which is to phage DNA what transformation is to plasmid DNA).
Whether by infection or transduction, the recombinant phage DNA ends up in host
cells which produce new phage that eventually lyse the host cell. The released
phages go on to infect more host cells until all cells have lysed. What remains is a
tube full of lysate containing cell debris and lots of recombinant phage particles.
270 Infect Host with Recombinant Phage to Make a Genomic Library
D. A Note About Some Other Vectors
We’ve seen that phage vectors accommodate larger foreign DNA inserts than plasmid
vectors, and YACs even more…, and that for larger genomes, the goal is to choose a
vector able to house larger fragments of ‘foreign’ DNA so that you end up screening
fewer clones. Given a large enough eukaryotic genome, it may be necessary to
screen more than a hundred thousand clones in a phage-based genomic library.
Apart from size-selection of genomic fragments before inserting them into a vector,
selecting the appropriate vector is just as important. The table below lists commonly
used vectors and the sizes of inserts they will accept.

example by screening a phage lysate genomic library for a recombinant phage with a
genomic sequence of interest.

E. Screening a Genomic Library; Titering Recombinant Phage Clones
A phage lysate is titered on a bacterial lawn to determine how many virus particles
are present. A bacterial lawn is made by plating so many bacteria on the agar plate
that they simply grow together rather than as separate colonies. In a typical titration,
a lysate might be diluted 10-fold with a suitable medium and this dilution is further
diluted 10-fold… and so on. Such serial 10X dilutions are then spread over bacterial
(e.g., E. coli) lawns. What happens on such a culture plate?
Let’s say that when 10 l of one of the dilutions are spread on the bacterial lawn, they
infect 500 E. coli cells on the bacterial lawn. After a day or so, there will be small
clearings in the lawn called plaques…, 500 of them in this example. These are 500
tiny clear spaces on the bacterial lawn created by the lysis of first one infected cell,
and then progressively more and more cells neighboring the original infected cell.
Each plaque is thus a clone of a single virus, and each virus particle in a plaque
contains a copy of the same recombinant phage DNA molecule (below).

Illustration by G. Bergtrom

If you actually counted 500 plaques on the agar plate, then there must have been 500
virus particles in the 10 l seeded onto the lawn. And, if this plate was the fourth
dilution in a 10-fold serial dilution protocol, there must have been 2000 (4 X 500)
phage particles in 10 l of the original undiluted lysate.
F. Screening a Genomic Library; Probing the Genomic Library
In order to represent a complete genomic library, it is likely that many plates of such a
dilution (~500 plaques per plate) will have to be created and then screened for a
plaque containing a gene of interest. But, if only size-selected fragments were
CMB3e

371

inserted into the phage vectors in the first place, the plaques represent only a partial
genomic library, requiring screening fewer clones to find the sequence of interest. For
either kind of library, the next step is to make replica filters of the plaques. Replica
plating of plaques is similar to making a replica filter bacterial colonies. While much of
the phage DNA in a plaque is encased in viral proteins, there will also be DNA on the
plaque replicas that were never packaged into viral particles. The filters can be
treated to denature the latter DNA and then directly hybridized to a probe with a
known sequence.
In the early days of cloning, probes for screening a genomic library were usually an
already isolated and sequenced cDNA clone, either from the same species as the
genomic library, or from a cDNA library of a related species. After soaking the filters in
a radioactively labeled probe, X-Ray film is placed over the filter, exposed and
developed. Black spots will form where the film lay over a plaque containing genomic
DNA complementary to the radioactive probe. In the example illustrated below, a
globin cDNA might have been used to probe the genomic library (globin genes were
among the first to be cloned!).

Illustration by G. Bergtrom

G. Isolating a Gene for Further Study
Cloned genomic DNA fragments are much longer than any gene of interest, and
always longer than any cDNA from a cDNA library. They are also embedded in a
genome that is thousands of times as long as the gene itself, making the selection of
an appropriate vector necessary. If the genome can be screened among a
reasonable number of cloned phage (~100,000 plaques for instance), the one plaque
producing a positive signal on the autoradiograph would be further studied.
CMB3e

372

This plaque should contain the gene of interest. The next step is to find the gene
within a genomic clone that can be as much a 20kbp long. The traditional strategy is
to purify the cloned DNA, subject it to restriction endonuclease digestion, and separate
of the digest particles by agarose gel electrophoresis. Using Southern Blotting, the
separated DNA fragments are denatured and blotted to a nylon filter. The filter is then
probed with the same tagged probe used to find the positive clone (plaque). The
smallest DNA fragment containing the gene of interest can itself be subcloned in a
suitable vector, and grown to provide enough DNA for further study of the gene.
271 Screen a Genomic Library, Pick and Grow a Phage Clone

V. The Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR)
The polymerase chain reaction (PCR) can amplify a region of DNA from any source, even
from a single cell’s worth of DNA or from fragments of DNA obtained from a fossil. This
amplification usually takes just a few hours, generating millions of copies of the desired
target DNA sequence. The effect is to purify the DNA from surrounding sequences in a
single reaction! Kary B. Mullis was awarded a Nobel Prize in 1993 for his development of
PCR, which is now the basis of innumerable research studies of gene structure, function
and evolution as well as applications in criminal forensics, medical diagnostics and other
commercial uses. PCR is described in detail below.
A. PCR – the Basic Process
Typical PCR relies on knowing two bits of DNA sequence that will be used to design
and synthesize short oligonucleotide sequences (oligomers) in the laboratory. The
two oligomers are chosen to be complementary to sequences opposite strands of
double-stranded DNA containing the gene to be studied. We say that the two
oligomers face, or oppose each other. That just means that the 3’ end of one
oligomer faces the 3’ end of the opposing oligomer. This way the two oligomers can
serve as primers for the elongation replication of both strands of a double stranded
target DNA sequence. Check out the link below for further explanation.
272 PCR: Design and Synthesize Opposing Oligonucleotide Primers
The first step in PCR is to add oligomer primers to the target DNA from which a gene
(or other genomic sequence) is to be amplified. The mixture is then heated to
denature the target DNA. The mixture is cooled to allow the primers to H-bond to
complementary target DNA strands. Next, the four deoxynucleotide precursors to
DNA (dATP, dCTP, dTTP and dGTP) are added along with a small amount of a DNA

CMB3e

373

polymerase. New DNA strands will now lengthen from the oligonucleotide primers on
the template DNAs. To make lots of the PCR product, this reaction cycle must be
repeated many times. Therefore, after allowing elongation, the mixture is heated to
denature (separate) all the DNA strands. When the mixture is again cooled, the
oligomers again find complementary sequences with which to H-bond. Early versions
of PCR originally relied on an E. coli DNA polymerase, which is inactivated by heating,
and so had to be re-added to the PCR mixture for each elongation cycle. Just as with
DNA sequencing, researchers very quickly switched to the heat-stable Taq
polymerase, of Thermus aquaticus. The enzymes of T. aquaticus remain active at
the very high temperatures at which these organisms live. Since heating does not
destroy the Taq polymerase in vitro, PCR, like DNA sequencing reactions, could be
automated with programmable thermocylers that raised and lowered temperature
required by the PCR reactions. There was no longer a need to replenish a DNA
polymerase once the reaction cycles were begun. Thermocyling in a typical PCR
amplification is illustrated below for the first two PCR cycles, the second of which
produces the first strands of DNA that will actually be amplified exponentially.

Illustration by G. Bergtrom

CMB3e

374

You can see from the illustration that the second cycle of PCR has generated the two
DNA strands that will be templates for doubling and re-doubling the desired product
after each subsequent cycle. A typical PCR reaction might involve 30 PCR cycles,
resulting in a nearly exponential amplification of the desired sequence.
273 PCR: The Amplification Reaction
CHALLENGE: Starting with a pair of complementary target DNA
molecules (after the 3rd PCR cycle), how many double stranded PCR
products should you theoretically have at the end of all 30 PCR cycles?

The amplified products of PCR amplification products are in such abundance that they
can easily be seen under fluorescent illumination on an ethidium bromide-stained
agarose gel (below).

In this gel, the first lane (on the left) contains a DNA ladder, a mixture of DNAs of
known lengths that can be used to estimate the size of the PCR fragments in the 3rd
and 4th lanes (the gel lane next to the ladder is empty). The two bright bands in lanes
3 and 4 are PCR products generated with two different oligomer primer pairs. PCRamplified DNAs can be sequenced and used in many subsequent studies.

B. The many Uses of PCR
PCR-amplified products can be labeled with radioactive or fluorescent tags to serve as
hybridization probes for
 screening cDNA or genomic libraries and isolation of clones.
 determining migration position on a Southern blot.
 determining migration position on a northern blot (a fanciful name for RNAs that
are separated by size on gels and blotted to filter).
 and more!
1. Quantitative PCR
We noted above that PCR has wide applications to research, medicine and other
practical applications. A major advance was Quantitative PCR, applied to studies
of differential gene expression and gene regulation. In Quantitative PCR, initial
cDNAs are amplified to detect not only the presence, but also the relative amounts
of specific transcripts being made in cells.
2. Forensics
Another application of PCR is in forensic science, to identify a person or organism
by comparing its DNA to some standard, or control DNA. An example of one of
these acrylamide gel DNA fingerprints is shown below.

are manifold and often quite inventive! For a list, click Variations on Basic PCR.

3. Who are your Ancestors?
Tracing your ethnic, racial and regional ancestry is related to DNA fingerprinting, in
that it relies on PCR amplification of genes and other DNA regions and comparison
of these your sequences to distinguishing DNA markers in large sequence
databases. The price of these services have come down, and as a result, their
popularity has gone up in recent years. Typically, you provide spit or a salivary
(buccal) swab to the service and they amplify and sequence the DNA in your
samples. The analysis compares your DNA sequences to database sequences
looking for patterns of ethnic and regional markers that you might share with the
database(s). Based on these comparisons, you are provided with a (more…, or
less) accurate map of your DNA-based ancestry. Folks who are spending around
$100.00 (less when on sale!) often ask just how accurate are these analyses, and
what do they actually mean. For example, what does it mean if your DNA says
you are 5% native American? In fact, different services can sometimes give you
different results! You can get some answers and explanations DNA Ancestry

VI. Genomic Approaches: The DNA Microarray
Traditionally, when cellular levels of a protein were known to change in response to a
chemical effector, molecular studies focused on control of the transcription of its gene.
These studies often revealed that the control of gene expression was at the level of
transcription, turning a gene on or off through interactions of transcription factors with
DNA. However, protein levels are also controlled post-transcriptionally, by regulating
the rate of mRNA translation or degradation. Studies of transcriptional and posttranscriptional regulation mechanisms are seminal to our understanding of how the
correct protein is made in the right amounts at the right time.
We may have suspected, but now know that control of gene expression and cellular
responses can be more complex than increasing or decreasing the transcription of a
single gene or translation of a single protein. Whole genome sequences and new
techniques make possible the study of the expression of virtually all genes in a cell at the
same time, a field of investigation called genomics. Genomic studies reveal networks of
regulated genes that must be understood to more fully explain the developmental and
physiological changes in an organism. When you can ‘see’ all of the RNAs being
transcribed from active genes in a cell, you are looking at a cell’s transcriptome. By
analogy to genomics, transcriptomics defines studies of ‘webs’ of interactive RNAs.
Again, by analogy to genomics and transcriptomics, the broad study of active and inactive
proteins in cells or tissues, how they are modified (processed) before use and how they
interact is called proteomics. The technologies applied to proteomic studies include
protein microarrays, immunochemical techniques and others uniquely suited to protein
analysis (click Proteomics Techniques-Wikipedia for more information). Protein
Microarrays are increasingly being used to identify protein-protein interactions, as well as
the different states of proteins under different cellular conditions. Read even more about
these exciting developments and their impact on basic and clinical research at Protein
Microarrays from ncbi.
Finally think about this: creating a proteomic library analogous to a genomic library would
seem a daunting prospect. But efforts are underway. Check out A stab at mapping the
Human Proteome for original research leading to the sampling of a tissue-specific human
proteome, and click Strategies for Approaching the Proteome for more general
information.
Let’s look at some uses of DNA microarrays. This technology involves ‘spotting’ DNA
(e.g., cloned DNA from a genomic or cDNA library, PCR products, oligonucleotides…) on
a glass slide, or chip. In the language of microarray analysis, the slides are the probes.
Spotting a chip is a robotic process. Because the DNA spots are microscopic, a cellspecific transcriptome (cDNA library) can fit on a single chip. A small genome microarray

CMB3e

378

might also fit on a single chip, while larger genomes might need several slides. A primary
use of DNA microarrays is transcriptional profiling. A genomic microarray can probe a
mixture of fluorescently tagged target cDNAs made from mRNAs, in order to identify
many (if not all) of the genes expressed in the cells at a given moment (i.e., its
transcriptome). cDNA microarray probes can also probe quantitative differences in gene
expression in cells or tissues during normal differentiation or in response to chemical
signals. They are also valuable for genotyping, (i.e. characterizing the genes in an
organism). Microarrays are so sensitive that they can even distinguish between two
genes or regions of DNA that differ by a single nucleotide. Click Single Nucleotide
Polymorphisms, or SNPs to learn more. In the microarray below, each colored spot (red,
yellow, green) is a different fluorescently tagged molecule hybridizing to target sequences
on the microarray. In the fluorescence microscope, the spots fluoresce different colors in
response to UV light.: Sample Microarray

With quantitative microarray methods, the brightness (intensity) of the signal from each
probe can be measured. In this way, we can compare the relative amounts of cDNA (and
thus, different RNAs) in the transcriptome of different tissues or resulting from different
tissue treatments. A table of different applications of microarrays (adapted from
Wikipedia) is shown on the next page.

Synopsis
In a transcription (mRNA or gene expression) profiling experiment the
expression levels of thousands of genes are simultaneously monitored to study
the effects of certain treatments, diseases, and developmental stages on gene
expression.
Assessing genome content in different cells or closely related organisms,
where one organism’s genome is the probe for a target genome from a
different species.
Small microarrays to check IDs of organisms in food and feed for genetically
modified organisms (GMOs), mycoplasmas in cell culture, or pathogens for
disease detection. These detection protocols often combine PCR and
microarray technology.
DNA sequences bound to a particular protein can be isolated by
immunoprecipitating the protein. The fragments can be hybridized to a
microarray (such as a tiling array) allowing the determination of protein binding
site occupancy throughout the genome.
Analogously to ChIP, genomic regions bound by a protein of interest can be
isolated and used to probe a microarray to determine binding site occupancy.
Unlike ChIP, DamID does not require antibodies but makes use of adenine
methylation near the protein's binding sites to selectively amplify those
regions, introduced by expressing minute amounts of protein of interest fused
to bacterial DNA adenine methyltransferase.
Identifying single nucleotide polymorphism among alleles within or between
populations. Some microarray applications make use of SNP detection,
including Genotyping, forensic analysis, measuring predisposition to disease,
identifying drug-candidates, evaluating germline mutations in individuals or
somatic mutations in cancers, assessing loss of heterozygosity, or genetic
linkage analysis.
An exon junction array design uses probes specific to the expected or potential
splice sites of predicted exons for a gene. It is of intermediate density, or
coverage, to a typical gene expression array (with 1-3 probes per gene) and a
genomic tiling array (with hundreds or thousands of probes per gene). It is
used to assay the expression of alternative splice forms of a gene. Exon arrays
have a different design, employing probes designed to detect each individual
exon for known or predicted genes, and can be used for detecting different
splicing isoforms.
Genome tiling arrays consist of overlapping probes designed to densely
represent a genomic region of interest, sometimes as large as an entire human
chromosome. The purpose is to empirically detect expression of transcripts or
alternatively spliced forms which may not have been previously known or
predicted.

VII.

Ome-Sweet Ome,

Early molecular technologies, including the ones described in this chapter, were applied
to understanding the structure, function and regulation of specific genes. Some of the
more recent technologies (e.g., microarrays) are well adapted to holistic approaches to
understanding cell function. Terms we have already seen (genome, epigenome,
transcriptome) were coined in an effort to define the different objects of study whose
underlying network of molecular interactions can more accurately explain cell function.
Distinguishing these objects of study can be difficult, and their overlap in cells can be
confusing. Here is a short compendium of …omes with an attempt at clarification:








Genome - total cell’s DNA content, identical in every cell of an organism
Exome - A cell’s total coding DNA (excluding non-coding DNA)
Metabolome - A cell’s metabolic landscape (i.e., metabolic status)
Epigenome - A cell’s total DNA-modification/chromatin topography
Methylome – The pattern of methylation of DNA in the genome
Proteome – A cell’s profile of protein content
transcriptome - A cell’s RNA transcript profile and steady state at any given moment

One can be excused for assuming that such cellular profiles would be the same for all
cells in a tissue, only changing as gene expression is regulated during development or
when signaled by extracellular events or chemical signals. But, even genomic and
exomic profiles can change! Recall somatic mutations in dividing cells, and genome loss
in some cells (e.g., erythrocytes that emerge from our reticulocytes). Studies of large
numbers of individual cells suggest profile variation even in cells of the same tissue or cell
culture. How and why this is so is a rapidly growing new area of study, made possible by
new tools for studying DNA, RNA and proteins molecules in single cells (see Mapping
Protein Networks, The Dark Proteome, A Human Transcriptome Study, Nature vs.
Nurture: Influences on Epigenome and Methylome). Can you name the next …ome?
Maybe the chondrome (see Mining Mitochondrial Genes).

From Genetic Engineering and Genetic Modification

By enabling us to focus on how genes and their regulation have evolved, these genomic,
transcriptomic and proteomic technologies have vastly increased our knowledge of how
cells work at a molecular level. We continue to add to our knowledge of disease process
and in at least a few cases, how we can treat disease. The use of technologies to
genetically modify organisms is more controversial, despite the best of human intentions.

Some genetically modified organisms (GMOs) aim to increase food productivity to better
feed the world. The introduction ‘beneficial’ genes into some GMOs have made
 drought-resistant crops to increase the range where major food crops can be grown.
 pest-resistant crops to reduce reliance on environmentally toxic chemical pesticides.
 herbicide-resistant crops that survive chemicals used to destroy harmful plants.
The quest for “improved” plant and animal varieties has been going on since before
recorded history. Farmers have been cross-breeding cows, sheep, dogs, and crop
varieties from corn to wheat, hoping to find faster growing, larger, hardier, (you name it)
varieties. It is the manipulation of DNA (the essence of the genetic material itself) that is
at the root of controversy. Controversy is reflected in opinions that GMO foods are
potentially dangerous, and that their cultivation should be banned. However, the general
consensus is that attempting to ban GMOs is too late! In fact, you are probably already
partaking of some GMO foods without even knowing it. Perhaps the good news is that
after many years of GMO crops already in our food stream, the emerging scientific
consensus is that GMO foods are no more harmful than unmodified foods. The current
debate is whether or not to label foods that are (or contain) GMO ingredients as
genetically modified.
In an odd but perhaps amusing take on the discomfort some folks feel about GMOs, a
startup company has genetically modified Petunias. When grown in water, their flowers
are white, but when ‘watered’ with beer, they will produce pink flowers or purple flowers
depending on how much beer they get (Check it out at Can Beautiful Flowers Change
Face?). According to the company, they seek “to bring what it sees as the beauty of
bioengineering to the general public” (and perhaps some profit as well?).
More recently, we have CRISPR and related tools that can precisely edit gene (in fact any
DNA) sequences. And unlike the “quack medicines” of old, these tools have the real
potential to cure disease, destroy disease-carrying vectors, cure cancer, improve crops
and possibly alter the course of evolution. The speed with which one can accomplish
such good (or evil) is truly awesome.

Chapter 16: Membrane Structure
Membrane Structure and Function: the fluid mosaic, membrane proteins,
glycoproteins, glycolipids
I.

Overview

The plasma membrane has the same phospholipid bilayer construction as all
intracellular membranes. All membranes are a fluid mosaic of proteins attached to or
embedded in the phospholipid bilayer. The different proteins and to some extent, different
phospholipids, structurally and functionally differentiate one kind of cellular membrane
from another. Integral (trans-membrane) proteins span the phospholipid lipid bilayer,
with one hydrophobic domain and two hydrophilic domains. In the case of the plasma
membrane, the hydrophilic domains interact with the aqueous extracellular fluid on one
side and the cytoplasm on the other, while the hydrophobic domain keeps the proteins
anchored in the membrane. Once embedded in the fatty acid interior of a membrane,
integral membrane proteins cannot escape! In contrast, peripheral membrane
proteins bind to membrane surfaces, typically held in place by hydrophilic interactions
with charged features of the membrane surface (phospholipid heads, hydrophilic surface
domains of integral proteins). Integral membrane proteins are often glycoproteins whose
sugars face the outside of the cell. Cells thus present a sugar coating, or glycocalyx, to
the outside world. As cells form tissues and organs, they become bound to extracellular
proteins and glycoproteins that they, or other cells, secrete to form an extracellular
matrix. We will spend much of this chapter looking at characteristic structures and
biological activities of plasma membrane proteins and their functions.
Learning Objectives
When you have mastered the information in this chapter, you should be able to:
1. distinguish components of the membrane that can move (diffuse) laterally in the
membrane from those that can flip (switch) from the outer to the inner surface of the
phospholipid bilayer.
2. compare the fluid mosaic membrane to earlier membrane models and cite the
evidence for and against each (as appropriate).
3. describe how cells might make their plasma membranes and suggest an experiment
that would demonstrate your hypothesis.
4. distinguish between transmembrane and peripheral membrane proteins, and provide
specific examples of each.
5. decide whether a newly discovered protein might be a membrane protein.
6. predict the effect of molecular and physical influences on membrane fluidity.
7. suggest how organisms living in warm tropical waters have adapted to the higher
temperatures. Likewise, fish living under the arctic ice.

II.

Plasma Membrane Structure

In eukaryotic cells, the plasma membrane surrounds a cytoplasm filled with ribosomes
and organelles. Organelles are structures that are themselves encased in membranes.
Some organelles (nuclei, mitochondria, chloroplasts) are even surrounded by double
membranes. All cellular membranes are composed of two layers of phospholipids
embedded with proteins. All are selectively permeable (semi-permeable), allowing only
certain substances to cross the membrane. The unique functions of cellular membranes
are due to their different phospholipid and protein compositions. Decades of research
have revealed these functions (see earlier discussions of mitochondrial and chloroplast
function for instance). Here we’ll describe general features of membranes, using the
plasma membrane as our example.
A. The Phospholipid Bilayer
Gorter and Grendel predicted the bilayer membrane structure as early as 1925. They
knew that red blood cells (erythrocytes) have no nucleus or other organelles, and thus
have only a plasma membrane. They also knew that the major chemical component
of these membranes were phospholipids. The space-filling molecular model below
shows the basic structure of phospholipids, highlighting their hydrophilic (polar)
heads and hydrophobic tails.

Molecules with hydrophilic and hydrophobic domains are amphipathic molecules.
Gorter and Grendel had measured the surface area of red blood cells. They then did
a ‘blood count’ and then disrupted a known number of red blood cells. They then
measured the amount of phospholipids in the membrane extracts. From this, they
calculated that there were enough lipid molecules per cell to wrap around each cell
twice. From these observations, they predicted the phospholipid bilayer with fatty
acids interacting within the bilayer. Curiously, Gorter and Grendel had made two
calculation errors in determining the amount of phospholipid per cells. Nevertheless,
their errors compensated each other so that, while not strictly speaking correct, their
conclusion remained prophetic! Common membrane phospholipids are shown below.

Amphipathic molecules mixed with water spontaneously aggregate to ‘hide’ their
hydrophobic regions from the water. In water, these formed actual structures called
liposomes that sediment when centrifuged!

Liposome membrane structure is consistent with the predicted phospholipid bilayer,
with the hydrophobic tails interacting with each other and the polar heads facing away
from each other, forming a phospholipid bilayer. This led to a picture of membrane
architecture based on phospholipid interactions. An iconic illustration of the
phospholipid bilayer, with its hydrophobic fatty acid interior and hydrophilic external
surfaces is drawn below.

B. Models of Membrane Structure
In 1935, Davson and Danielli suggested that proteins might be bound to the polar
heads of the phospholipids in the plasma membrane, creating a protein/lipid/protein
sandwich. Decades later, J.D. Robertson observed membranes in the transmission
electron microscope at high power, revealing that all cellular membranes had a
trilamellar structure. The classic trilamellar appearance of a cellular membrane in the
electron microscope is illustrated below.

Public domain; Adapted from: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_cell_membrane_theory By Sandraamurray

CMB3e

387

The trilamellar structure is consistent with the protein-coated hydrophilic surfaces of a
phospholipid bilayer in Davson and Danielli’s protein-lipid-protein sandwich.
Observing that all cellular membranes had this trilamellar structure, Robertson he
further proposed his Unit Membrane model: all membranes consist of a clear
phospholipid bilayer coated with electron-dense proteins.
The static view of the trilamellar models of membrane structure implied by the
Davson-Danielli or Robertson models was replaced in 1972 by Singer and Nicolson’s
Fluid Mosaic model (see The fluid mosaic model of membranes. Science 175:720731). They suggested that in addition to peripheral proteins that do bind to the
surfaces of membranes, many integral membrane proteins actually span the
membrane. Integral membrane proteins were imagined as a mosaic of protein ‘tiles’
embedded in a phospholipid medium. But unlike a mosaic of glazed tiles set in a firm,
cement-like structure, the protein ‘tiles’ were predicted to be mobile (fluid) in a
phospholipid sea. In this model, membrane proteins are anchored in membranes by
one or more hydrophobic domains; their hydrophilic domains would face aqueous
external and cytosolic environments. Thus, like phospholipids themselves, membrane
proteins are amphipathic. We know that cells expose different surface structural (and
functional) features to the aqueous environment on opposite sides of a membrane.
Therefore, we also say that cellular membranes are asymmetric. A typical model of
the plasma membrane of a cell is illustrated below.

CMB3e

388

In this model, peripheral proteins have a hydrophobic domain that does not span the
membrane, but that anchors it to one side of the membrane. Other peripheral (or socalled “surface”) proteins are bound to the membrane by interactions with the polar
phosphate groups of phospholipids, or with the polar domains of integral membrane
proteins.
Because of their own aqueous hydrophilic domains, membrane proteins are a natural
barrier to the free passage of charged molecules across the membrane. On the other
hand, membrane proteins are responsible for the selective permeability of
membranes, facilitating the movement of specific molecules in and out of cells.
Membrane proteins also account for specific and selective interactions with their
extracellular environment. These interactions include the adhesion of cells to each
other, their attachment to surfaces, communication between cells (both direct and via
hormones and neurons), etc. The ‘sugar coating’ of the extracellular surfaces of
plasma membranes comes from oligosaccharides covalently linked to membrane
proteins (as glycoproteins) or to phospholipids (as glycolipids). Carbohydrate
components of glycosylated membrane proteins inform their function. Thus,
glycoproteins enable specific interactions of cells with each other to form tissues.
They also allow interaction with extracellular surfaces to which they must adhere. In
addition, they figure prominently as part of receptors for many hormones and other
chemical communication biomolecules. Protein domains exposed to the cytoplasm,
while not glycosylated, often articulate to components of the cytoskeleton, giving cells
their shape and allowing cells to change shape when necessary. Many membrane
proteins have essential enzymatic features, as we will see. Given the crucial role of
proteins and glycoproteins in membrane function, it should come as no surprise that
proteins constitute an average of 40-50% of the mass of a membrane. In some cases,
proteins are as much as 70% of membrane mass (think cristal membranes in
mitochondria!).
278 Properties of Proteins Embedded in a Phospholipid Bilayer
279 Different Membrane Compositions
C. Evidence for Membrane Structure
Membrane asymmetry refers to the different membrane features facing opposite
sides of the membrane. This was directly demonstrated by the scanning electron
microscope technique of freeze-fracture. The technique involves freezing of isolated
membranes in water and then chipping the ice. When the ice cracks, the encased
membranes split along a line of least resistance… that turns out to be between the
hydrophobic fatty acid opposing tails in the interior of the membrane. Scanning
CMB3e

389

electron microscopy then reveals features of the interior and exterior membrane
surfaces. Among the prominent features in a scanning micrograph of freeze-fractured
plasma membranes are the pits and opposing mounds facing each other on opposite
flaps of the membrane, as illustrated below.

Illustration by G. Bergtrom

Other features shown here are consistent with phospholipid membrane structure.
280 Freeze Fracture Electron Microscopy of Cell Membranes
Cytochemistry confirmed the asymmetry of the plasma membrane, showing that only
the external surfaces of plasma membranes are sugar coated, Check the link below
for more detailed descriptions of the experiments.
281 EM Cytochemical Demonstration of Membrane Asymmetry
Finally, the asymmetry of membranes was also demonstrated biochemically. In one
experiment, whole cells treated with proteolytic enzymes, followed by extraction of the
membranes and then isolation of membrane proteins. In a second experiment,
plasma membranes were isolated from untreated cells first, and then treated with the
CMB3e

390

enzymes. In a third experiment, proteins were extracted from plasma membranes
isolated from untreated cells. Electrophoretic separation of the three protein extracts
by size demonstrated that different components of integral membrane proteins were
present in the two digest experiments, confirming the asymmetry of the plasma
membrane. Again, for more details, check the link below.
282 Electrophoretic Demonstration of Membrane Asymmetry
The idea that membranes are fluid was also tested. In yet another elegant
experiment, antibodies were made to mouse and human cell membrane proteins.
Membranes were isolated and injected into a third animal (a rabbit most likely). The
rabbit saw the membranes and their associated proteins as foreign and responded by
making specific anti-membrane antibody molecules. The antibodies against each
membrane source were isolated and separately tagged with different colored
fluorescent labels so that they would glow a different color when subjected to
ultraviolet light. After mouse and human cells were mixed under conditions that
caused them to fuse, making human-mouse hybrid cells. When added to fused cells,
the tagged antibodies bound to the cell surface proteins. After a short time, the
different fluorescent antibodies were seen to mix under a fluorescence microscope
under UV light. The fluorescent tags seemed to moving from their original location in
the fused membranes. Clearly, proteins embedded in the membrane are not static,
but are able to move laterally in the membrane, in effect floating and diffusing in a “sea
of phospholipids”. The mouse antibodies as seen in the hybrid cell right after fusion
are cartooned below.

283 Two Demonstrations of Membrane Fluidity: The Fluid Mosaic

CMB3e

391

D. Membrane Fluidity is Regulated
1. Chemical Factors Affecting Membrane Fluidity
As you might imagine, the fluidity of a membrane depends on its chemical
composition and physical conditions surrounding the cell, for example the outside
temperature. Factors that affect membrane fluidity are summarized below.

Illustration by G. Bergtrom

Just as heating a solution causes dissolved molecules and particulates to move
faster, phospholipid and protein components of membranes are also more fluid at
higher temperatures. If the fatty acids of the phospholipids have more unsaturated
(C=C) carbon bonds, these hydrophobic tails will have more kinks, or bends. The
kinks tend to push apart the phospholipid tails. With more space between the fatty
acid tails, membrane components can move more freely. Thus, more

CMB3e

392

polyunsaturated fatty acids in a membrane make it more fluid. On the other hand,
cholesterol molecules tend to fill the space between fatty acids in the hydrophobic
interior of the membrane. This reduces the lateral mobility of phospholipid and
protein components in the membrane. By reducing fluidity, cholesterol reduces
membrane permeability to some ions.
2. Functional Factors Affecting Membrane Fluidity
Evolution has adapted cell membranes to different and changing environments to
maintain the fluidity necessary for proper cell function. Poikilothermic, or coldblooded organisms, from prokaryotes to fish and reptiles, do not regulate their
body temperatures. Thus, when exposed to lower temperatures, poikilotherms
respond by increasing the unsaturated fatty acid content of their cell membranes.
At higher temperatures, they increase membrane saturated fatty acid content.
Thus, the cell membranes of fish living under the arctic ice maintain fluidity by
having high levels of both monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fatty acids. What
about fish species that range across warmer and colder environments (or that live
in climates with changing seasons). For these fish, membrane composition can
change to adjust fluidity to environment.
The warm-blooded (homeothermic) mammals and birds maintain a more or less
constant body temperature. As a result, their membrane composition is also
relatively constant. But there is a paradox! Their cell membranes are very fluid,
with a higher ratio of polyunsaturated fat to monounsaturated fats than say,
reptiles. The apparent paradox is resolved however, when we understand that this
greater fluidity supports the higher metabolic rate of the warm-blooded species
compared to poikilotherms. Just compare the life styles of almost any mammal to
a lazy floating alligator, or a snake basking in the shade of a rock!
284 Factors Influencing Membrane Fluidity
E. Making and Experimenting with Artificial Membranes
Membrane-like structures can form spontaneously. When phospholipids interact in an
aqueous environment, they aggregate to exclude their hydrophobic fatty tails from
water, forming micelles. Micelles are spherical phospholipid monolayer vesicles that
self-assemble, a natural aggregation of the hydrophobic fatty acid domains of these
amphipathic molecules.

CMB3e

393

A micelle is drawn below.

Public domain; Adapted from: https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c6/Phospholipids_aqueous_solution_structures.svg

Micelles can further self-assemble into spherical phospholipid bilayers called
liposomes (below).

Public domain; Adapted from: https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c6/Phospholipids_aqueous_solution_structures.svg

When formed in the laboratory, these structures behave somewhat like cells, for
example, forming a pellet at the bottom of a tube when centrifuged. Liposomes can
be custom designed from different kinds of phospholipids and amphipathic proteins
that become integral to the liposome membranes. When liposomes can be prepared
in the presence of specific proteins or other molecules that can’t cross the membrane.
The trapped molecules cannot get out of this synthetic ‘organelle’. Such were the
studies that allowed the identification of the mitochondrial respiratory chain
complexes. The ability to manipulate liposome content and membrane composition
also make them candidates for the drug delivery to specific cells and tissues (google
liposome for more information).

CMB3e

394

F. The Plasma Membrane is Segregated into Regions with Different Properties of
Fluidity and Selective Permeability
As we will see shortly, fluidity does not result in an equal diffusion of all membrane
components around the cell membrane surface. Instead, extracellular connections
between cells as well as intracellular connections of the membrane to differentiated
regions of the cytoskeleton, effectively compartmentalize the membrane into subregions. To understand this, imagine a sheet of epithelial like those in the cartoon
below.

Illustration by G. Bergtrom

The sheet of cells exposes one surface with unique functions to the inside of the organ
they line. It exposes the opposite surface, one with a quite different function, to the
other side of the sheet. The lateral surfaces of the cells are yet another membrane
compartment, one that functions to connect and communicate between the cells in the
sheet. Components, i.e., membrane proteins illustrated with different symbolic shapes
and colors, may remain fluid within a compartment. Of course, this macrodifferentiation of cell membranes to permit cell-cell and cell-environmental interactions
makes intuitive sense.
The recent observation that cellular membranes are even more compartmentalized
was perhaps less anticipated. In fact, membranes are further divided into microcompartments. Within these compartments, components are fluid but seldom move
between compartments. Studies indicate that cytoskeletal elements create and
maintain these micro-discontinuities. For example, integral membrane proteins are
immobilized in membranes if they are attached to cytoskeletal fibers (e.g., actin) in the
cytoplasm. Furthermore, when aggregates of these proteins line up due to similar
interactions, they form kind of fence, inhibiting other membrane components from
crossing. By analogy, this mechanism of micro-compartmentalization is called the
CMB3e

395

Fences and Pickets model; proteins attached to the cytoskeleton serve as the pickets.
The movement across the fences (i.e., from one membrane compartment to another)
is infrequent. Extra kinetic energy is presumably needed for a molecule to ‘jump’ a
fence between compartments. Hence, this kind of motion, or hop diffusion
distinguishes it from the Brownian motion implied by the original fluid mosaic model.
285 Membrane Domains: Regional Differentiation of a Plasma Membrane

III. Membrane Proteins
Clearly, membrane proteins themselves have domains that keep membranes in or
attached to the membrane, provide catalytic surfaces and allow interactions inside, across
and outside of cells and organelles. Membranes anchor proteins in several ways. As
noted, membrane proteins, like phospholipids, are amphipathic, with hydrophobic
domains that non-covalently interact strongly with the fatty acid interior of membranes.
Some integral membrane proteins span the entire membrane, with hydrophilic domains
facing the cytosol or cell exterior. Peripheral proteins bind to a membrane surface
through non-covalent interactions. Examples of integral and peripheral membrane
proteins, glycoproteins and lipoproteins are illustrated below.

Illustration by G. Bergtrom

286 Domains of Membrane Proteins

CMB3e

396

IV. How membrane proteins are held in membranes
The hydrophobic domain of integral membrane proteins consists of one or more alphahelical regions that interact with the hydrophobic interior of the membranes. Hydrophilic
domains tend to have more tertiary structure with hydrophilic surfaces, and so face the
aqueous cytosol and cell exterior. Two trans-membrane proteins are cartooned below.

Transmembrane
Proteins

Illustration by
G. Bergtrom

Spanning the membrane one or more times
The protein on the left crosses the membrane once, while the one on the right crosses the
membrane three times. How a transmembrane protein inserts into the membrane during
synthesis dictates the locations of its N- and C-terminus. Transmembrane proteins can in
fact cross a membrane more than once, which also determines the location of its N- and
C-termini. N-terminal end of a plasma membrane polypeptide always ends up exposed to
the outside of the cell. The alpha helical domains that anchor proteins in membranes are
mostly non-polar and hydrophobic themselves. As an example, consider the amino acids
in the alpha-helical domain of the red blood cell protein glycophorin A, a membrane
protein that prevents red blood cells from aggregating, or clumping in the circulation.
One glycophorin A polypeptide with its hydrophobic trans-membrane alpha helix is
cartooned below. Glycophorin A monomers pair to form dimers in the plasma membrane.

Illustration by G. Bergtrom

CMB3e

397

Proteins that span membranes multiple times may include amino acids with charged,
polar side chains, provided that these side chains interact between helices so that they
are shielded from the fatty acid environment in the membrane. Because of these
hydrophilic interactions, such proteins can create pores for the transport of polar
molecules and ions; we will see some of these proteins later. Integral membrane proteins
that do not span the membrane also have a hydrophobic helical domain that anchors
them in the membrane, while their hydrophilic domains typically interact with intracellular
or extracellular molecules to e.g., hold cells in place give cells and tissues their structure,
etc.
The very presence of the hydrophobic alpha-helical domains in trans-membrane proteins
makes them difficult if not impossible to isolate from membranes in a biologically active
form. By contrast, the peripheral polypeptide cytochrome c readily dissociates from the
cristal membrane, making it easy to purify. For many years, an inability to purify other
cristal membrane electron carriers in biologically active form limited our understanding of
the structure and function of the mitochondrial electron transport system.
Hydrophobic alpha-helical domains are in fact, a hallmark of membrane-spanning
proteins. It is even possible to determine the primary structure of a polypeptide encoded
by a gene before the protein itself has been isolated. For example, knowing the DNA
sequence of a gene, we can infer the amino acid sequence of the protein encoded by
the gene. A hydrophobicity analysis of the inferred amino acid sequence can tell us if a
protein is likely to be a membrane protein. Let’s look at a hydropathy (hydrophobicity)
plot (below).

Some of these functions are summarized and illustrated below.

399

Transmembrane proteins perform most of the functions illustrated here. However,
peripheral membrane proteins also play vital roles in membrane function. Remember that
Cytochrome c in the electron transport system on the mitochondrial cristal membrane is a
peripheral protein. Other peripheral membrane proteins may serve to regulate the
transport or signaling activities of transmembrane protein complexes or may mediate
connections between the membrane and cytoskeletal elements. The peripheral
membrane proteins by shown here do not penetrate membranes. They bind reversibly to
the internal or external surfaces of the biological membrane with which they are
associated. We will be looking more closely at what holds membrane proteins in place
and how they perform their unique functions. Check out major membrane protein

VI. Glycoproteins
Membrane proteins are often covalently linked to oligosaccharides, which are branched
glycoside-linked sugars (averaging around 15 sugar residues). As glycans, they are the
sugars linked to glycoproteins. Glycoproteins are rare in the cytosol, but common on
secreted and membrane proteins. Oligosaccharides are typically linked to proteins via
the hydroxyl group on serine or threonine. Occasional linkages are to modified amino
acids like hydroxylysine or hydroxyproline (O-glycosylation), and to the amide nitrogen
on asparagine (N-glycosylation). The oligosaccharide domains of glycoproteins often
play a major role in membrane protein function. For example, the glycoproteins, along
with the polar domains of integral and peripheral proteins and glycolipids, are a major
feature of the glycocalyx. A cell membrane and its glycocalyx are illustrated below.

CC-BY; Adapted from: http://cnx.org/The Glycocalyx

Oligosaccharides begin their synthesis in the rough endoplasmic reticulum (RER), with
the creation of a core glycoside. Partial glycans are enzymatically linked to compatible
amino acids of a membrane protein. As these proteins travel through the Golgi vesicles
CMB3e

401

of the endomembrane system, terminal glycosylation attaches more sugars to the core
glycoside to complete glycoprotein synthesis. When vesicles budding from the transGolgi vesicles fuse with the plasma membrane, the sugars on the glycoproteins end up
on the exterior cell surface. This is illustrated in the link below.
291 The Path to Sugar Coated Cells

VII.

Glycolipids

Glycolipids are phospholipids attached to oligosaccharides, and as noted, are part of
the glycocalyx. Both are only found on the extracellular surface. Glycolipids are
synthesized in much the same way as glycoproteins. Specific enzymes catalyze initial
glycosylation of either phospholipids or polypeptides, followed by the addition of more
sugars. Along with glycoproteins, glycolipids play roles in cell-cell recognition and the
formation of tissues. The glycans on the surfaces of one cell will recognize and bind
to carbohydrate receptors (lectins) on adjacent cells, leading to cell-cell attachment
as well as intracellular responses in the interacting cells. Glycoproteins and
glycolipids also mediate the interaction of cells with extracellular molecular signals and
with chemicals of the extracellular matrix (ECM). The ECM includes components of
connective tissue, basement membranes, in fact any surface to which cells attach.

VIII. Glycoproteins and Human Health
We’ll close this chapter with a few examples of glycoproteins that play crucial roles in
human physiology. Let’s look first at the major human blood groups. The major A, B, AB,
O and Rh blood groups result from the presence or absence of glycoprotein antigens
embedded in red blood cell membranes and the presence or absence in the blood, of
antibodies against the antigens. Typically, exposure to antigens (foreign substances like
bacteria, viruses, toxins…) generates immunoglobulins, the antibody molecules of our
immune system; immunoglobulins are glycoproteins. The situation with blood groups is
something of a paradox. The blood group antibodies already in the blood of a healthy
person are not a response to foreign antigen invasion!
You probably know that these blood groups must be compatible for a successful blood
transfusion. A mismatch between donor and recipient can be devastating. The
interaction of the red cell antigens of one blood group with antibodies in another blood
group will cause the red cells to clump, restricting blood flow and ultimately killing the
transfusion recipient. The table below summarizes why transfusions with mismatched A,
B, AB, O blood groups must be avoided.

CMB3e

403

Another red blood cell antigen is the Rh factor. People have either it (Rh+) or not (Rh-).
In contrast, when an Rh- recipient receives blood from an Rh+ donor, the recipient’s
immune system makes defensive anti-Rh antibodies in the usual way. This too can
cause blood cell clumping with bad consequences. A word to the wise: it’s a good idea to
know your own blood group!
Check the Red Cross website (http://www.redcrossblood.org/learn-about-blood/bloodtypes.html ) or https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_type for more detail about blood
groups.
The last example here involves the cell surface major histocompatibility complex (MHC)
glycoproteins that distinguish self from non-self in body tissues and organs. Major organ
Transplantation (liver, kidneys, heart) from donors into patients with failing organs has
become, if not routine, then at least increasingly common. Before a transplant, MHC
tissue typing determines donor and recipient compatibility, reducing the chances of the
rejection of the transplanted organ. Since available donors are few, and good matches
even fewer, patients wait on prioritized lists for a matched organ. Even when MHC typing
is a match for a patient, the immune systems of transplant recipients are suppressed with
hormones to reduce further the chance of rejection. Unlike the limited number of blood
groups, many MHC proteins are analyzed to determine a match. Thus, it is not practical
(or routinely necessary) to ‘know’ your MHC type!

Chapter 17: Membrane Function
Passive, facilitated and active transport, the traffic of proteins in cells, cellcell interactions, excitability and signal transduction
I.

Introduction

Small molecules like O2 or CO2 can cross cellular membranes unassisted; neither the
hydrophilic surfaces nor the hydrophobic interior of the phospholipid bilayer are barriers to
their transit. On the other hand, most molecules (even water!) need the help of
membrane transport proteins to get in or out of cells and organelles. Transport proteins
can act as gates that might be open or closed. When open, they permit diffusion of
molecules into or out of cells along a concentration gradient so that their concentrations
equalize across the membrane. Like the passive diffusion of small gasses, facilitated
diffusion by membrane proteins does not require an input of energy. In contrast, some
transport proteins are actually pumps, using chemical energy to move molecules across
membranes against a concentration gradient. The result of this active transport is to
concentrate solutes on one side of a membrane. For example, pumps that create sodium
and potassium ion gradients are responsible for the excitability of cells. Recall that this
is one of the fundamental properties of life: the ability of cells and organisms to respond to
stimuli.
As you read this chapter, look for how allosteric change can regulate membrane function,
where we consider how:
 membrane gates and pumps work.
 membrane protein interactions allow cells to self-assemble into tissues and organs.
 cells direct protein traffic to the cytoplasm, into membranes themselves, into
organelles…, or out of the cell.
 membrane proteins participate in direct communication between adjacent cells.
 membrane proteins are receptors for more long-distance communications,
responding to neurotransmitters, hormones, and other external chemical signals.

Membrane Transport

The first control on the passage of molecules across membranes is the semi-permeable
character of the membrane itself. Molecules move in and out of cells in one of three
ways: passive diffusion, facilitated transport and active transport.
Only a few small, relatively uncharged molecules can cross a membrane unassisted (i.e.,
by passive diffusion). Hydrophilic molecules that must enter or leave cells do so with
help, i.e., by facilitated transport. Passive and facilitated transport release the free energy
inherent in concentration gradients as molecules diffuse across a membrane. In contrast,
active transport consumes energy to create concentration gradients of specific solutes.
The specificity of facilitated and active transport lies in integral membrane proteins that
recognize and bind specific solutes for transport. As you may predict, allosteric regulation
of these proteins controls the movement of their target molecules into or out of cells.

Despite its polarity, many believed that the small water molecules crossed membranes
without help. Indeed, it does to a limited extent. However, others suspected that given its
highly charged polar covalent bonds relative to its small size, water molecules require an
assist to get across membranes efficiently. Let’s begin with a closer look at passive
diffusion and facilitated diffusion, followed by osmosis (a special case of facilitated
diffusion), and finally, at active transport.
A. Passive Diffusion
Passive diffusion is the movement of molecules over time by random motion (also
called Brownian motion) from regions of higher concentration to regions of lower
concentration. Significant passive diffusion across cellular membranes is limited to a
few molecules, mostly gasses like O2, CO2, and N2, that can freely cross the
hydrophobic phospholipid barrier. The rapid diffusion of gasses is essential for O2 and
CO2 exchange between the alveolar capillaries and cells of the lungs during
physiological respiration. O2 and CO2 exchange also occurs in mitochondria during
cellular respiration. Diffusion across membranes does not require energy. In fact,
diffusion releases energy - recall the movement of protons through the F1 ATPase
proton gate that synthesizes ATP during mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation.
The rate of diffusion of a molecule is dependent only on its own concentration. It is
unaffected by the concentration of other molecules. Over time, random motion of
solutes within and across compartments results in a dynamic equilibrium for each
different solute over time. At equilibrium, solute molecules continue to diffuse across
the membrane, but for each molecule moving across in one direction, another
molecule of the same solute crosses in the other direction.
B. Facilitated Diffusion of Solutes and Ions
Like passive diffusion, facilitated diffusion is the spontaneous (downhill) passage of
molecules or ions across membranes through specific transmembrane proteins. The
kinetics of passive and facilitated diffusion reveals the differences between the two
processes. To understand the latter, recall that the rate of enzyme catalysis is
saturable. That is, as the concentration of substrate is increased, the rate of the
catalyzed reaction approaches a maximum (Vmax), when all enzyme molecules in
solution are bound to substrate molecules. The same saturation phenomenon applies
to facilitated transport – the rate of solute movement across a membrane is directly
proportional to the number of transport proteins in the membrane.

CMB3e

408

The kinetics of passive and facilitated diffusion are illustrated by the graph shown
below.

Illustration by G. Bergtrom

Perhaps you see another similarity between facilitated diffusion and enzyme catalysis
in this graph! Relative rates of facilitated diffusion are typically rapid, compared to
those of passive diffusion. This is because the allosteric changes that accompany
facilitated transport are rapid, just as they are during enzyme catalysis. There are
three kinds of facilitated transport of solutes (below).

Illustration by G. Bergtrom

CMB3e

409

The GLUT protein (glucose transporter) protein shown above (left) allows glucose
uniport, the specific transport of a single substance in or out of cells. Kidney cells
have glucose transporters that symport (couple) the simultaneous movement of
glucose and sodium ions; SGLT (Sodium-GLucose Transporter) serves a similar
function in small intestine cells, enabling absorption of dietary glucose and sodium.
Antiport (above, right) allows the specific exchange of molecules across a
membrane. In the example shown, ATP leaves the mitochondrial matrix, crossing the
cristal membrane at the same time as ADP enters the matrix.
Whether by uniport, symport or antiport, each solute will independently cross a
membrane down its concentration gradient, moving from higher concentration to
where it is at a lower concentration. Recall that diffusion along a gradient releases
free energy that depends on relative concentrations of the solutes.
Proteins mediating facilitated diffusion are of two kinds: carrier proteins and channel
proteins. Carrier proteins allow solute transport. Ions, with their high charge-to-mass
ratio, need help to cross the hydrophobic membrane barrier; this is the job of channel
proteins that essentially serve as ion pores.
Like all transporter proteins, both carrier and channel proteins undergo allosteric
change during transport. They are also typically subject to allosteric regulation, rather
than being in a constant ‘open’ state. Examples of facilitated diffusion are considered
in more detail below.
1. Carrier Proteins
When a carrier protein binds a solute that must cross the membrane, it undergoes
an allosteric change (illustrated below). During transport, the carrier protein
undergoes another change in shape. When the solute reaches the other side of
the membrane, it no longer has a high affinity for the carrier protein. After release
of the solute, a final allosteric change restores the original conformation of the
transport protein. These sequential conformational changes are illustrated on the
next page.
Any given carrier protein is specific for a single solute, or at most a single family of
closely related solutes. We just saw the GLUT1 transporter carrier protein that
allows glucose (but not fructose or ribose!) to cross cell membranes. Different
specific carrier proteins facilitate the transport of amino acids and other charged
solutes across cell membranes. Once again, molecules that indicate cell status
(i.e., a need to import or export solute) are allosteric effectors that regulate carrier
proteins. The regulation of glucose transport into cells by insulin is a perfect

CMB3e

410

Illustration by G. Bergtrom

example. One consequence of insulin released during a meal (or just in
anticipation of a meal) is the stimulation of glucose transporters to take up glucose.
An inability of those transporters to respond to insulin accounts in part for Type II
(adult onset) diabetes.
Water gets across membranes by osmosis (we’ll look more closely at how osmosis
affects cells in a moment). We noted that small amounts of water could cross the
phospholipid bilayer unassisted. Water can also cross a membrane incidentally,
when ions flow through their channel proteins. But most osmosis involves
facilitated diffusion mediated by aquaporins. Some aquaporins only transport
water. Others have evolved to co-facilitate the transport of glucose (see above),
glycerol, urea, ammonia, carbon dioxide and even ions (protons) along with water.
Like other carrier proteins, aquaporins are allosterically regulated to allow cells to
meet their specific water balance requirements. So fundamental was the
understanding of water balance that the discovery of aquaporins earned Peter
Agre a Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 2003. Since Agre’s discovery (in 1992), several
genetic diseases have been linked to aquaporin gene mutations.
Kidney cells are critically involved in vertebrate water balance and have many
aquaporins in their membranes. In a rare form of diabetes, abnormal aquaporins
cause the kidneys to excrete unusually large volumes of water. In another
example, aquaporin gene mutations lead to the development of cataracts in both
eyes. Since their initial discovery, aquaporins have been described in bacteria and
plants. To learn more, click Aquaporins - Wikipedia.

2. Ion Channels
Allosteric regulation of ion channel proteins controls ion homeostasis in blood and
extracellular fluids within narrow limits. Often, multiple integral proteins contribute
to the formation of an ion channel. When stimulated, channel proteins rearrange to
open a pore allowing specific ion transport. Some ion channels, like the glucosesodium ion symport system noted above, mobilize the energy of diffusion of one
solute (an ion in this case) to rapidly transport another solute through the same
channel (acting like an ion channel and a carrier protein). Finally, ion channels are
responsible for the excitability of cells, where Na+ , K+ and Ca++ channels
collaborate in ion movements into and out of cells leading to neuronal or muscle
cell responses (more shortly!).
293 Passive and Facilitated Diffusion
C. Osmosis
Osmosis, the diffusion of water across membranes from lower to higher solute
concentrations, is an essential activity. It allows cells to use water to maintain cellular
integrity or to adapt to changes in the solute composition in the extracellular
environment. Osmosis across cellular membranes relies on the facilitated transport of
water by aquaporins. The passive diffusion of water molecules, can be demonstrated
with an artificial (e.g., dialysis) membrane. Water will cross such a membrane if solute
concentrations are higher on one side of the membrane. Water crosses the
membrane “trying” to equalize the solute concentrations on both sides of the
membrane. In effect, water movement is from the side of a membrane where the free
water molecule concentration is higher (i.e., where the concentration of solute is
lower) to the side where the concentration of free water is lower (i.e., where the
concentration of solute is higher).
4. Osmosis in Plant and Animal Cells
We could present this section in the context of free water concentrations, but we
will do so in the more familiar terms of solute concentrations. Osmosis affects
plant and animal cells according to the same principles, but with different effects.
First, let us consider the effect of different experimental solute concentrations on
animal cells, illustrated on the next page.

CMB3e

412

Illustration by G. Bergtrom

If the solute concentration inside and outside the cell is the same, there is no net
movement into or out of the cells. The extracellular medium and cytosol are said
to be isotonic to each other. When water diffuses into the cells from a low
solute medium, the medium is said to by hypotonic to (less concentrated than)
the cytosol. In this case, movement of water into a cell lowers the cytosol solute
concentration. Animal cells swell and burst in a hypotonic solution. In hypertonic
solutions (with a higher solute concentrations than the cytosol), animal cells shrivel
up as water leaves the cell. From this brief description, you should conclude that
water crosses from the hypotonic to the hypertonic side of a membrane.
As with animal cells, exposure of plant cells to hypotonic or hypertonic solutions
causes the same directional water movements, but with some key differences due
to their cell walls. In hypotonic solutions, water enters plant cells, moving into the
cytosol and then into water vacuoles called tonoplasts. This results in higher
osmotic pressure (water pressure) in the tonoplasts. The expanding tonoplast
creates turgor pressure, compressing the cytosol against the cell wall. Rather
than bursting, the cells and plant tissues stiffen and become turgid. Since water

CMB3e

413

cannot enter plant cells indefinitely, water stops entering the cells when the
osmotic pressure outside the cells and the turgor pressure inside the cells are at
equilibrium. You encountered this phenomenon if you have ever over-watered
houseplants. The stiffened leaves and stems become brittle and are easily
snapped or broken. In hypertonic medium, plant cells (like animal cells) lose
water, resulting in plasmolysis. This is the effect of shrinkage of the plasma
membrane. However, the plasma membrane remains tightly attached to the plant
cell wall at several points. You may have seen under-watered plants with floppy or
droopy stems and leaves. These have become flaccid due to loss of water and
thus the loss of turgor pressure needed to keep leaves and stems upright. The
effects of different solutions on plant cells are illustrated below.

Illustration by
G. Bergtrom

Formally, osmotic or turgor pressure is defined as the force per unit area (i.e.,
pressure) required to prevent the passage of water across a semipermeable
membrane from a hypotonic to a hypertonic solution.
2. Osmosis in Plant Life
While individual plant cells respond to changes in solute concentrations, these
changes are rapidly communicated to adjacent cells through plasmodesmata.
These structures connect the plasma membranes of adjacent cells through their
cell walls, allowing rapid, direct sharing of physical and chemical information.

CMB3e

414

A plasmodesma is illustrated below.

Illustration by G. Bergtrom

In this way, effects on osmotic pressure in a few cells created by changes in water
availability are transmitted to adjacent cells, affecting turgor pressure in those cells
and, ultimately, in plant tissues.
Finally, plant life depends on water! Recall that plant cells require a continual
supply of water for use in photosynthesis, to provide hydrogen to reduce CO2 to
glucose. Photosynthesis as well as the loss of excess water from plant tissues
(especially leaves) by transpiration lowers cellular osmotic pressure. As water
moves up from the roots to replace water used and lost by leaf cells, the osmotic
pressure drops in the fine root hair cells (with their high surface area). This draws
water into the cells and roots by osmosis. Thus, osmotic pressure is the main
force driving water into plants and, defying gravity, moving it up from the roots to
the rest of the plant.

CMB3e

415

3. Osmosis in Animal Life
Changes in osmotic environment can stress or kill an organism. For example,
freshwater organisms (protozoa or fish) placed in sea water will die. Likewise, saltwater fish placed in freshwater. But organisms can osmoregulate (control the
osmotic pressure in their cells), at least to a point. Paramecium for example,
expels fresh water to prevent bursting as it takes on water. This is accomplished
by a contractile vacuole (shown below).

CC-BY-SA 3.0; From: http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Paramecium_caudatum_Ehrenberg,_1833.jpg

Water constantly enters these freshwater protists because the solute concentration
in the cytosol is always higher than the freshwater water they live in. To cope with
a constant uptake of water, their contractile vacuoles collect excess water and then
contract to expel the water. At a high-energy cost, Paramecia constantly pump
water out of the cell to maintain water balance (i.e., correct osmotic pressure).
Another protist strategy for coping with change in environmental solute
concentrations (salinity) is to pump salts (or suitable salt solute substitutes in or out
of the cell, as needed (For some details, see Protist Osmoregulation Genes
Acquired by Eukaryotes from Bacteria by Horizontal Gene Transfer .
Larger organisms like freshwater fish cope with their hypotonic environment by
urinating a lot! At the other end of the spectrum, salt-water fish cope with the high
solute concentration of solutes (salts) in their environment by excreting excess salt.
Salmon spend time in seawater growing to maturity and later swim upstream in
fresh water to spawn. You can imagine how salmon and similar organisms have to
osmoregulate to adapt to their changing, very different environments. In this
case, osmoregulation begins when hormonal changes respond to changes in
living circumstance and dictate a compensatory response.

CMB3e

416

4. Summing Up
Osmosis is the movement of water across membranes to where solutes are at high
concentration. At the same time, solutes that can diffuse across membranes move
in or out of cells towards where they are at lower concentration, either passively, or
by facilitated diffusion. We have evolved different facilitated transport proteins
specific for different proteins. Finally, most water crosses membranes by
facilitated diffusion through aquaporin proteins that serve as pores in cellular
membranes.
294 Osmosis
D. Active Transport
Excitability (adaptation) is another of the defining properties of life. This property of all
cells is based on chemical and electrical reactivity. Neurotransmitters released at a
synapse cross the synaptic cleft from a “sending” neuron to a responding cell (another
neuron or a muscle cell). The neurotransmitter binds to receptors on the responding
cell resulting in a membrane depolarization, a rapid change in the electrical potential
difference across the cell membrane. While responses to neurotransmitters occur in
fractions of a second, all cells are responsive, albeit not always as fast as neurons or
muscle cells. Changes in membrane polarity of any cell depend on unequal
concentrations of ions inside and outside cells. Cells at rest typically have a higher
[K+] in the cytosol and higher [Cl-] and [Na+] outside the cell (below).

Illustration by G. Bergtrom

CMB3e

417

These ionic differences across membranes are what enable such cells as neurons
and muscle to respond to chemical and other (e.g., electrical) signals. Thus, cells
have a resting potential, shown here with plus and minus signs on opposite sides of
the membrane. The measured resting potential (difference in charge or potential
difference) of most cells is typically between -50mv to -70mv. Disturbance of the
resting potential (i.e., membrane depolarization), results from a flow of ions across
membranes.
Resting potentials sustained by ion gradients permit physiological response to
chemical or other signals. Resting potentials change when cells are excited, as well
as by normal, but non-functional ion leakage. Whether incidental or intentional, the
correct ion balance must be restored and maintained. This is accomplished by the
active transport of ions across the membrane. This energetically unfavorable
process requires an input of free energy, typically from ATP hydrolysis. The Na+/K+
pump is an active transport protein complex linked to ATPase activity. Next, we
consider ion flow during cell excitation and how ion pumps work.
Let’s begin by looking at the allosteric changes that occur when the Na+/K+ pump
works to restore and maintain ion gradients (illustrated on the next page). In operation,
the ATPase domain of the Na+/K+ pump hydrolyzes ATP, leaving a phosphate
attached to the pump and inducing the first of several allosteric changes in the pump
proteins (No. 1, above). In its new conformation, the pump binds three Na+ ions,
causing a second conformational change that in turn releases the Na + ions into the
extracellular fluid (No. 2). The release of Na+ ions outside the cell causes a third
allosteric change (No. 3), after which two K+ ions from the extracellular fluid are
able to bind to the pump protein. K+ binding causes the hydrolysis of the phosphate
from the pump protein, returning the pump proteins to their original conformation (No.
4) and releasing the two K+ ions into the cytosol. The Na+/K+ pump is ready for action
again!

296 Active Transport by the Sodium/Potassium Pump

studies of how it works to maintain intracellular ion balance, Jens C. Skou earned a

III. Ligand and Voltage Gated Channels in Neurotransmission
A. Measuring Ion Flow and Membrane Potential
When neurotransmitters bind to their receptors, ion channels in responding neuron or
muscle cells open. The resulting influx of Na+ ions disrupts the resting potential of
the target cell. The effect is only transient if the membrane potential remains negative.
However, if enough Na+ ions enter the cell, the membrane becomes depolarized. If
the cell experiences hyperpolarization, a localized reversal of normal membrane
polarity (say from –70 mV to +65mV or more) will generate an action potential. This
action potential will travel like a current along the neural or muscle cell membrane,
eventually triggering a physiological response, e.g., the excitation of the next nerve
cell in a neuronal pathway or contraction of the muscle cell. The patch-clamp device
detects specific ion flow and any the resulting change in potential difference across
the membrane. Principles of patch-clamp measurement are illustrated below.

Illustration by G. Bergtrom

In the example above, closing the switch on the power supply sends an electrical
charge to the cell, opening up voltage-gated ion channel. In this case, a potassium
sensor in the device detects the flow of K+ ions through the channel and out of the cell.
At the same time, a volt meter registers the resulting change in membrane potential.
297 A Patch Clamp Device Can Record Membrane Potential and Ion Flow
298 Patch Clamp Measures Resting Potential and Depolarization
In addition to voltage-gated ion channels, the patch clamp device can measure ion
flow through ligand-gated ion channels and mechanically-gated ion channels.

CMB3e

420

The former channels are receptor-ion gates that open when they bind an effector
molecule. Mechanically-gated ion channels detect physical pressure or stress that
result in a local membrane deformation, opening the channel.
299 Gated Ion Channels
300 Types of Gated Ion Channels-Illustrated
Finally, cells maintain a high intracellular concentration of K+ ions, causing K+ ions to
slowly leak from the cell, a phenomenon detectable by a patch-clamp. The presence
of negative ions (Cl- ions, organic ions) inside a cell limits the leakage. This creates
the electronegative interior of a cell relative to outside the cell, i.e., the resting potential
across its plasma membrane. The patch-clamp technique has been used to correlate
the flow of ions and changes in membrane potential when a neuron fires, causing an
action potential in a responding cell.
Such a correlation is described on the next page. In the illustration, follow the opening
and closing of ion channels and the flow of ions. An action potential (in fact any shift
from resting potential) results from facilitated diffusion of specific ions into or out of the
cell through gated ion channels (green, above) that must open and close in sequence.
The behavior of two different voltage-gated ion channels are illustrated in the graph.
Electrical stimulation opens Na+ channels. Na+ ions rush into the cell, reducing the
membrane potential from the resting state to zero, or even making the cytoplasm more
positive than the extracellular fluid. If the reversal in polarity is high enough, a voltagegated K+ opens and potassium ions rush into the cell, restoring the resting potential of
the cell.
A cell can continue to respond to stimuli with action potentials for as long as there is
sufficient Na+ outside the cell and K+ inside the cell. While active transport of Na+ and
K+ is not required to re-establish the resting potential, it will eventually be necessary to
restore the balance of the two ions in the cell. If a nerve or muscle cell fires several
times (or even if it just leaks ions), the [K+] inside the cell and the [Na+] outside the cell
would drop to a point where the cell cannot generate an action potential when
stimulated.
Ultimately, it is the role of ATP-dependent Na+/K+ pumps to restore the appropriate
Na+-K+ balance across the responding cell membrane. As we have seen, each cycle
of pumping exchanges 3 Na+ ions from the intracellular space for 2 K+ ions from the
extracellular space. The pump has two effects:
 It restores Na+ concentrations in the extracellular space relative to the cytoplasm.
 It restores K+ concentrations in the cytoplasm relative to the extracellular space.

421

Illustration by G. Bergtrom

301 Gated Ion Channels Open and Close in Order During an Action Potential

Together with the higher negative ion concentrations in the cytosol, the unequal
exchange of Na+ for K+ ions maintains the resting potential of the cell over the long
term and ensures that nerve and muscle cells remain excitable. Next, we will take a
closer look at the role of both ligand-gated and voltage-gated ion channels in
neurotransmission.

CMB3e

422

B. Ion Channels in Neurotransmission
Action potentials result in an orderly, sequential opening and closing of voltage- and
ligand-gated channels along the neuronal axon. In the link below, you can see the
sequential cycling of voltage-gated channels that propagates a localized action
potential (membrane depolarization) along an axon towards a synapse.
302 Propagating an Action Potential Along an Axon
When a propagated depolarization reaches a synapse, gated ion channels either open
or close in the neuron and the responding cell. The cooperation of voltage- and
ligand-gated channels at a neuromuscular junction is illustrated below.

Illustration by G.
Bergtrom

As you can see from the illustration, after a neuron fires, an electrical impulse (a
moving region of hyperpolarization) travels down the axon to the nerve ending. At the
nerve ending, the traveling charge difference (electrical potential) across the cell

CMB3e

423

membrane stimulates a Ca++-specific voltage-gated channel to open. Ca++ ions then
flow into the cell because they are at higher concentrations in the synaptic cleft than in
the cytoplasm.
The Ca++ ions in the cell cause synaptic vesicles to fuse with the membrane at the
nerve ending, releasing neurotransmitters into the synaptic cleft. Then, the
neurotransmitters bind to a receptor on the responding cell plasma membrane. This
receptor is a ligand-gated channel (also called a chemically-gated channel). Upon
binding of the neurotransmitter ligand, the channel opens. The rapid diffusion of Na+
ions into the cell creates an action potential that leads to the cellular response, in this
case, muscle contraction. We have already seen that K+ channels participate in
restoring membrane potential after an action potential, and the role of the
sodium/potassium pump in restoring the cellular Na+/K+ balance.
303 The Role of Gated Ion Channels at a Neuromuscular Junction

IV. Endocytosis and Exocytosis
Endocytosis is a mechanism for internalizing large extracellular molecules (e.g.,
proteins), insoluble particles, or even microorganisms. The three main types of
exocytosis are phagocytosis, pinocytosis and receptor-mediated endocytosis.
Pinocytosis is non-specific. Phagocytosis targets large structures (e.g., bacteria, food
particles…) and is not particularly specific. As its name suggests, receptor-mediated
endocytosis is specific for substances recognized by a cell-surface receptor. Exocytosis
is typically the secretion of large molecules. These could be proteins and glycoproteins
like digestive enzymes and many peptide/polypeptide hormones, each of which must exit
the cell to either the extracellular fluid or circulation. Exocytotic pathways also deliver
membrane proteins made in cells to the cell surface.
A. Endocytosis
Different forms of endocytosis are illustrated on the next page.
1. Phagocytosis (above left): phagocytes extend pseudopodia by membrane
evagination. The pseudopodia of amoeba (and amoeboid cells generally) engulf
particles of food that end up in digestive vesicles (phagosomes) inside the
cytosol. Phagocytes are a class of white blood cells that are part of our immune
system. They engulf foreign particles that must be eliminated from the body. A
lysosome fuses with the phagosome, after which stored hydrolytic enzyme are
activated. The result is the digestion of the engulfed particles. Phagocytosis
begins upon contact between the outer cell surface and those particles.

2. Pinocytosis (above center): pinocytosis is a non-specific, more or less constant
pinching off of small vesicles that engulf extracellular fluid containing solutes; they
are too small to include significant particulates.
3. Receptor-mediated endocytosis (above right): this kind of endocytosis relies on
the affinity of receptors for specific extracellular substances. Upon binding their
ligands, the receptors aggregate in differentiated regions of cell membrane called
coated pits. The coated pits then invaginate and pinch off, forming a coated
vesicle, thereby bringing their extracellular contents into the cell. After the coated
vesicles deliver their contents to their cellular destinations, the vesicle membranes
are recycled to the plasma membrane. Receptor-mediated endocytosis is
perhaps the best understood mechanism for bringing larger substances into cells.
The drawings below are taken from a series of electron micrographs that illustrates
the invagination of coated pits to form clathrin-coated vesicles. The receptor and
coat proteins are clearly visible as larger structures on the inner surfaces of the pits
and on the outer surfaces of the clathrin-coated vesicles.

Watch fluorescently labeled proteins enter cells by receptor-mediated endocytosis
live by following the bright spots in the video loop at Receptor-mediated
endocytosis - esp. watch two left panels. Clathrin, a large protein, is the principal
protein on the surface of the invaginated coated pit. Clathrin is linked to specific
integral membrane proteins via adaptor protein 1 (AP1). AP1 recruits specific
cargo proteins to bring into the cell when the coated pits invaginate.

CMB3e

426

Some details of receptor-mediated endocytosis are illustrated below.

Illustration by G. Bergtrom

In the illustration, substances to be internalized have bound to their cell membrane
receptors. The receptors then cluster to form a coated pit. Assisted by the
protein dynamin (a GTPase), the coated pits invaginate. The final pinch-off of a
coated vesicle requires GTP hydrolysis (not shown).
Once internalized, the coated vesicles lose their clathrin and associated adaptor
protein coat. The uncoated vesicle fuses with an early endosome to form a
sorting vesicle (i.e., late endosome). Sorting vesicles separate imported content
from the receptors that are recycled to the membrane. In the vesicle that remains,
now a lysosome, digestive enzymes catalyze hydrolysis of the vesicle contents.
The digest products are then released for cellular use.

A well-known example of receptor-mediated endocytosis is the uptake of
cholesterol bound to low density lipoprotein (LDL), a complex of phospholipid,
protein and cholesterol illustrated below.

A single LDL complex carries as many as 15,000 molecules of cholesterol. LDL,
sometimes called “bad cholesterol”, is not good for you at high levels. On the other
hand, high-density lipoprotein (HDL) is “good cholesterol”. As one gets older, it is
important to monitor one’s HDL/LDL ratio; the higher it is the better!
B. Exocytosis
Maintaining cell size or volume seems to be a built-in component of the machinery of
receptor-mediated endocytosis that balances endocytosis with membrane recycling.
However, exocytosis is also necessary to restore plasma membrane internalized by
pinocytosis and phagocytosis, and for eliminating cellular waste products.
Exocytosis is also the end-point of a complex process of packaging proteins destined
for secretion or for insertion into the membrane themselves. The pathways of
exocytosis and endocytosis share common features, as illustrated on the next page.

CMB3e

428

Note that the formation of both lysosomes and secretion vesicles begins in the rough
endoplasmic reticulum, followed by passage and maturation through Golgi vesicles.
While endocytotic vesicles and secretion vesicles form in ‘opposite directions’, they
both share common structural features with the plasma membrane, from which they
are derived and with which they fuse (respectively).

As we have seen, many secretory and membrane proteins are glycoproteins, to which
sugars are covalently attached starting in the rough endoplasmic reticulum. As we
have also seen, their glycosylation begins in the RER. Check the link below to see the
process again.
291 The Path to Sugar Coated Cells
Individual cells often produce more than a few packaged proteins at the same time,
requiring the sorting of each protein to its correct destination – extracellular fluids,
lysosomes, peroxisomes and other ‘microbodies’, and of course, membranes
themselves. Next we consider how cells target proteins to their different intracellular
and extracellular destinations.

V. Directing the Traffic of Proteins in Cells
Each polypeptide protein translated by ribosomes from a sequence of bases in an mRNA
has a specific functional location, either in the cytoplasm, on cellular membranes, inside
organelles or in extracellular fluids. In this section we consider the movement and sorting
of proteins in the endomembrane system as well as the transport of proteins into and
out of organelles.
A. Packaging proteins in the RER
All protein synthesis begins in the same way, with the formation of an initiation
complex and subsequent elongation cycles peptide bond formation and carboxylterminal amino acid addition. However, secretory proteins and those destined for
lysosomes, peroxisomes or other microbodies, complete elongation directly into
cisternae, or spaces enclosed by the rough endoplasmic reticulum (RER). It is
possible to isolate and purify proteins secreted by cultured cells. A good model system
for studying secretory protein synthesis turn out to be mouse myeloma cells.
Mouse myeloma cells were isolated and grown in culture, where they synthesize an
IgG light chain, a polypeptide that is part of a mouse immunoglobulin molecule.
Immunoglobulins are assembled from light and heavy chain polypeptides and
secreted into the circulation. There they serve as circulating antibodies of the
vertebrate immune system. Mouse myeloma cells are cancer cells that have lost the
ability to make the heavy chain polypeptides. Instead, they secrete mostly the IgG
light chain, making it easy to purify it from the cell culture medium. An early
experiment revealed that secreted polypeptides made in an in vitro translation system
are larger (longer) than the same polypeptides isolated from secretion fluids. This
experiment is summarized on the next page.

In one part of the experiment described above, myeloma cells were grown in the
presence of radioactive amino acids. The resulting radioactive IgG light chain
polypeptides were isolated (follow the red arrows). mRNA separately extracted from
another batch of the myeloma cells was added to a cell-free translation system
containing radioactive amino acids. The radioactive polypeptide synthesized in vivo
and in vitro were separated on electrophoretic gels and autoradiographed (follow the
blue arrows, above).
CMB3e

432

From the autoradiograph, the mature, secreted polypeptides made in vivo had
migrated faster on the gel than had those translated in vitro. The cell-free translation
product was indeed, larger than the mature secreted polypeptide. To explain these
results, Gunther Blobel and colleagues suggested the Signal Hypothesis, according
to which secretory protein genes encode extra amino acids as a short amino-terminal
signal peptide that directs a growing secretory polypeptide to the RER. To explain
the smaller (i.e., shorter) length of the mature, secreted polypeptide, they further
proposed that the signal peptide is only a temporary ‘traffic’ signal, removed by an
RER-associated enzyme as the polypeptide crossed the RER membrane into the
cisternal space.
304 Formulating the Signal Hypothesis: Early Experiments
In the test of the Signal Hypothesis (which won Blobel the 1999 Nobel Prize in
Physiology or Medicine), isolated RER membranes were included with mouse
myeloma cell mRNA in cell-free protein synthesis systems. Electrophoretic
autoradiographs this time showed that the polypeptides made in vitro in the presence
of RER were the same size as the mature, secreted polypeptides. The RER must
therefore contain processing activity, i.e., a signal peptidase that removes the signal
peptide! The steps of the signal hypothesis that emerged from the experiments of
Blobel and his colleagues are illustrated below.

The Signal Hypothesis, Step-By-Step

5

Illustration by G. Bergtrom

CMB3e

433

Recall that the synthesis of any protein starts with assembly of a translation initiation
complex, followed by polypeptide elongation. During elongation, the growing
polypeptide moves through and emerges from a channel, or groove in the large
subunit. As the N-terminal signal sequence (i.e., the signal peptide) of a secretory
polypeptide emerges from this groove, it interacts with the RER membrane.
Beginning at the lower left of the illustration above, the steps of the process are:
1. An SRP (signal recognition particle) binds to the hydrophobic signal peptide.
2. Elongation stops until the SRP-ribosome complex finds the RER membrane.
3. The ribosome-SRP complex binds to an SRP receptor on the RER membrane.
4. The SRP detaches from the growing polypeptide chain, to be recycled.
5. Translation elongation resumes through a translocation channel; a signal
peptidase in the RER membrane catalyzes co-translational hydrolysis of the
signal peptide, which remains embedded in the RER membrane.
6. Elongation continues and the growing polypeptide begins to fold in the RER.
305 Testing the Signal Hypothesis
306 Details of the Signal Hypothesis
Step 2 above requires that the SRP find and bind to the signal peptide before the
nascent polypeptide gets too long and starts to fold into a 3D (tertiary) conformation.
It turns out the ribosome itself may keep the signal peptide available by destabilizing
electrostatic interactions that would otherwise lead to folding and an undoubtedly
incorrect conformation. For more on ribosome involvement in protein folding, check
out the link at Protein Folding-Destabilizing One Protein Strand at a Time.
The secretory mechanism just described for eukaryotes has its counterpart in bacteria,
which secrete proteins that assist in nutrient scavenging as well as cell wall synthesis.
Partially elongated signal peptides guide mRNA-bound ribosomes to the cytoplasmic
side of the plasma membrane, where the ribosomes bind and then pass elongating
proteins through the plasma membrane into the space between the cell membrane
and wall. As the protein exits the cell, a bacterial signal peptidase (SPase) cleaves
the signal peptide. Apparently, the mechanism for the secretion of proteins evolved
early and since been conserved. As we will see, this mechanism has been further
coopted by eukaryotes for packaging proteins into some organelles and into
membranes themselves. Some interesting speculations on the evolution of the protein
packaging pathway are discussed in the link below.
307 Destinations of Protein Traffic and Evolution of Pathways

CMB3e

434

Early on, we discovered that antibiotics stop bacterial growth either by disrupting the
cell wall or otherwise killing the cells outright. We now know that some antibiotics
(e.g., arylomycins) disrupt plasma membrane SPase function, preventing proteins
required in the space between the cell wall and membrane from ever making it out of
the cell. Once used against Staphylococcus aurease, arylomycins are no longer
effective because many strains have become resistant to these antibiotics (click
Bacterial Signal Peptidase and Antibiotic Resistance to read about the mechanism of
arylomycin resistance). As you may already know, S. aurease is now resistant to
many antibiotics, and illness from untreatable infections has its own name, MRSA
(Methicillin-Resistant Staph Aurease - dig on your own to see more about methicillin
resistance). While named for methicillin resistance, MRSA now describes nearly
untreatable S. aurease infections.
B. Synthesis of Membrane-Spanning (Integral) Proteins
N-terminal signal sequences also guide ribosomes translating integral membrane
proteins to the RER. However, before such a protein can pass completely through the
membrane, a stop-transfer sequence (a hydrophobic domain within the polypeptide
chain) traps the protein in the fatty acid interior of the membrane. Multiple stoptransfer sequences account for transmembrane proteins that span a membrane more
than once (below).

308 Integral Membrane Proteins Have Stop Transfer Sequences

435

C. Moving and Sorting Packaged Proteins to Their Final Destinations
Like proteins packaged in RER, those made in the cytoplasm go to different
destinations before they become functional. Let’s look at the sorting mechanisms for
proteins sequestered by the endomembrane system and those made in the
cytoplasm.
1. Traffic on the Endomembrane Highway
We have already seen that, once packaged in the RER cisternae, proteins begin
post-translational modification (by e.g., ‘core glycosylation’). Transport vesicles
that bud off from the RER carry packaged and membrane proteins to the cis
vesicles of the Golgi apparatus. There, vesicle fusion is mediated by the
recognition of complementary integral membrane proteins embedded in the two
membranes. Later, such packaged proteins are sorted to different organelles or to
the plasma membrane. Sorting starts as proteins move from the cis to the trans
face of the Golgi vesicles, where specific sorting proteins associate with different
packaged proteins in the trans Golgi vesicles. The packaged proteins then sort to
vesicles that bud off from trans Golgi stacks. These vesicles move to their final
destinations, recognizing and fusing with appropriate membranes. Some events of
protein trafficking are animated at Events in Protein Trafficking and summarized in
the illustration on the next page.
James E. Rothman, Randy W. Schekman and Thomas C. Südhof won the 2013
Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for their studies of the regulation of vesicle
traffic (click 2013 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for more information).
Let’s follow some proteins in and on RER membranes through the cell:


Transition vesicles carrying their mix of packaged proteins bud off from the
RER with the help of COPI and COPII coat proteins, and dissociate from the
ribosomes originally attached to them. Transition vesicles however, remain
associated with the COP proteins.



These vesicles fuse with the cis Golgi vesicles, a process also mediated by
COP proteins. COPI proteins detach during or after fusion, to be recycled back
to the RER
.
Packaged proteins and membrane proteins are further processed as the pass
through the Golgi vesicle stack, for example undergoing terminal glycosylation.



CMB3e

436

Illustration by G. Bergtrom

CMB3e

437



At the trans face of the Golgi vesicles, cargo receptor proteins in the
membranes to bind specific packaged proteins (now called cargo proteins).
With the help of clathrin and other COP proteins, cargo protein-bound receptor
proteins bud off from the trans Golgi stack. However this time, specific cargo
proteins sort to separate vesicles with different cellular or extracellular
destinations. These budding vesicles also acquire membrane V-SNARE (for
vesicle-SNARE) proteins.



When V-SNARE proteins on their vesicles bind to complementary T-SNARE
(for target-SNARE) proteins on receiving membranes, the membranes fuse.
o Some vesicles follow this pathway, fusing with lysosomes or similar
vesicles to stock them with appropriate enzymes and other protein content.
Coat proteins come off the fusing vesicle and are recycled, while vesicle
contents are transferred into the next vesicle.
o Vesicles containing secretory proteins typically fuse to form larger
secretory vesicles. Secretory vesicles can be stored until the cells are
signaled to release their contents from the cell. At that point, secretion
vesicles fuse with the plasma membrane, releasing their contents to the
extracellular fluid. Once again, coat proteins and clathrin dissociate from
the secretory vesicle during fusion.

Other players have been left out of this discussion, notably those that hydrolyze
nucleotide triphosphates to provide the energy for this protein trafficking. In
addition, you might recognize other molecular players such as clathrin that play a
role receptor-mediated endocytosis. Maybe that’s not a surprise! After all,
endocytosis is, at least partly, molecular traffic in the opposite direction of vesicle
formation and secretion.
2. Nuclear Protein Traffic
Almost all proteins are encoded in the nucleus and translated in the cytosol.
These include most of those found in nucleus itself, as well as in mitochondria and
chloroplasts (see the Endosymbiotic Hypothesis for a description of intraorganelle gene expression). Proteins synthesized in the cytosol destined for
these organelles contain oligopeptide traffic signals that direct them to their
appropriate destinations. We saw earlier that large molecules (mRNAs, tRNAs)
and even whole particles (i.e., ribosomal subunits) cross the nuclear envelope
through nuclear pores.

CMB3e

438

As for proteins headed for the nucleus, nuclear localization signals rich in
positively charged amino acids (lysine, proline) enable binding to the negatively
charged domain of a nuclear transport receptor protein in the cytosol. This
process is illustrated below.

Illustration by G. Bergtrom

As the complex of the two proteins approach a nuclear pore, it interacts with
nuclear pore fibrils, causing the pore to open. The two bound proteins then cross
the double membrane of the nuclear envelope where they accumulate against a
concentration gradient. This active transport comes from ATP hydrolysis as the
nuclear proteins enter the nucleus.

CMB3e

439

3. Mitochondrial Protein Traffic
Recall that mitochondria contain their own genome and translational machinery.
Thus, they transcribe RNAs and translating proteins of their own. However, genes
in the nucleus encode many of the proteins found in mitochondria. Import of these
proteins into mitochondria is illustrated below.

Illustration by G. Bergtrom

Unlike the co-translational packaging of proteins by the RER, mitochondrial protein
transfer is post-translational. This means that mitochondrial proteins formed in the
cytoplasm have already folded, assuming a tertiary structure. However, the folded
protein exposes an N-terminal signal peptide on its surface that recognizes and
binds to a receptor protein at the outer mitochondrial membrane. The receptor
protein spans both the mitochondrial outer membrane (OM) and cristal membrane
(CM).

CMB3e

440

The receptor protein delivers the protein to membrane contact proteins that also
span both mitochondrial membranes. The membrane contact proteins acts as a
channel, or pore, through which the mitochondrial protein will cross into the
mitochondrial matrix.
But there is a problem: the folded protein cannot cross the membrane by itself!
The entry of a completed mitochondrial protein in the cytoplasm requires a socalled chaperone protein, in this case the HSP70 (heat-shock 70) protein. HSP70
controls unfolding of the mitochondrial protein as it passes into the matrix. Upon
removal of the signal peptide by a mitochondrial signal peptidase, another HSP70
molecule resident in the mitochondrion facilitates refolding of the protein into a
biologically active shape. Recall that HSPs were initially discovered in heat
stressed organisms; HSP70 is a 70 Kd protein.
309 Protein Traffic to Nuclei and Mitochondria

How Cells are Held Together and How They Communicate

Proteins and glycoproteins on cell surfaces play a major role in how cells interact with
their surroundings and with other cells. Some of the proteins in the glycocalyx of
adjacent cells interact to form cell-cell junctions, while others interact with extracellular
proteins and carbohydrates to form the extracellular matrix (ECM). Still others are part
of receptor systems that bind hormones and other signaling molecules at the cell surface,
conveying information into the cell by signal transduction.
A. Cell Junctions
Cell junctions serve different functions in cells and tissues. Cell junctions in healthy
cells serve to bind cells tightly, to give tissues structural integrity and to allow cells in
contact with one another to pass chemical information directly between them.
Electron micrographs and illustrations different cell junctions are shown on the next
page.

•

CMB3e

Tight Junctions (zonula occludens) are typical in sheets of epithelial cells that line
the lumens of organs (e.g., intestines, lungs, etc.). Zonula refers to the fact that
these structures form a band encircling an entire cell, attaching it to all surrounding
cells. Occludens refers to ‘water-tight’ seal or occluding barrier of tight junctions,
that stops extracellular fluids from crossing to the other side of a sheet of cells by
passing between cells. Tight junction membrane proteins (TJMPs) create the
waterproof barrier between cells.



Desmosomes (adherens junctions) essentially glue (adhere) cells together, giving
tissues their strength. Belt desmosomes (zonula adherens) surround entire cells,
strongly binding them to adjacent cells. Spot desmosomes (macula adherens) act
like rivets, attaching cells at ‘spots’. In both cases, cadherins cross cell
membranes from intracellular plaque proteins, spanning the intercellular space to
link adjacent cell membranes together. Plaques are in turn, connected to
intermediate filaments (keratin) of the cytoskeleton, further strengthening
intercellular attachments and thus, the tissue cell layer.



Gap junctions, the third cell junction, do not so much physically bind cells together
as enable chemical communication between cells. Connexon structures made of
connexin proteins act as pores that open to allow direct movement of ions and
small molecules between cells. This communication by ion or molecular
movement is quite rapid, ensuring that all cells in a sheet or other tissue in one
metabolic state can respond to each other and switch to another state
simultaneously. In plants, we have seen the plasmodesmata that perform
functions similar to the gap junctions of animal cells.

310 Cell Junction Structure and Function
Many glycocalyx proteins that interact to form junctions between cells are
glycoproteins. Generally, proteins that interact to bind cells together are called
Intercellular Cell Adhesion Molecules (ICAMs). These include selectins. During
blood clotting, selectins on one platelet recognize and bind specific receptors on other
platelets, contributing to the clot. NCAMs are another kind of ICAM, ones with sugary
immunoglobulin domains that interact specifically to enable neural connections.
We’ve already seen the calcium-dependent cadherins involved in forming adherens
junctions (desmosomes). These are essentially the ‘glue’ that binds cells together to
form strong cohesive tissues and sheets of cells.
Some examples of membrane proteins that enable cell-cell recognition and adhesion
are illustrated on the next page.

B. Cancer and Cell Junctions
During embryogenesis, cells migrate from a point of origin by attaching to and moving
along an extracellular matrix (ECM), which acts as a path to the cell’s final
destination. This ECM (or basal lamina) is made up of secretions from other cells…,
or from the migrating cells themselves! One major secretion is fibronectin. One of its
functions is to bind to integral membrane proteins called integrins, attaching the cells
to the ECM. During development, integrins respond to fibronectin by signaling cell
and tissue differentiation, complete with the formation of appropriate cell junctions. An
orderly sequence of gene expression and membrane protein syntheses enable
developing cells to recognize each other as different or the same.

CMB3e

444

The influences of cell surfaces on tissue differentiation are summarized below.

Illustration by
G. Bergtrom

An early difference between eukaryotic normal and cancer cells is how they grow in
culture. Normal cells settle to the bottom of a culture dish when placed in growth
medium. Then they grow and divide, increasing in number until they reach
confluence, when a single layer of cells completely covers the bottom of the dish.
The cells in this monolayer seem to ‘know’ to stop dividing, as if they had completed
formation of a tissue, e.g., a cell layer of epithelial cells. This phenomenon, originally
called contact inhibition, implies that cells let each other know when they have
finished forming a tissue and can stop cycling and dividing. In contrast, cancer cells
do not stop dividing at confluence. Instead, they continue to grow and divide, piling up
in multiple layers.
Among other deficiencies, cancer cells do not form gap junctions and typically have
fewer cadherens and integrins in their membranes. Thus, cancer cells cannot inform
each other of when they reach confluence. Neither can they form firm adherens
junctions. In vivo, a paucity of integrins would inhibit cancer cells from binding and
responding to fibronectin. Therefore they also have difficulty attaching firmly to an

CMB3e

445

extracellular matrix, which may explain why many cancers metastasize, or spread
from their original site of formation. These differences in growth in culture between
normal and cancer cells are shown below.

314 Role of the Extracellular Matrix in Cell Migration and Development

VII. Signal Transduction
When hydrophobic chemical effector molecules such as steroid hormones reach a target
cell they can cross the hydrophobic membrane and bind to an intracellular receptor to
initiate a response. When large effector molecules (e.g., protein hormones) or highly
polar hormones (e.g., adrenalin) reach a target cell, they can’t cross the cell membrane.
Instead, they bind to transmembrane protein receptors on cell surfaces. A conformational
change initiated on the extracellular domain of the receptor induces further allosteric
change on the cytoplasmic domain of the receptor. A sequential series of molecular
events then converts information delivered by the external effector into intracellular
information, a process called signal transduction.
CMB3e

446

A general outline of signal transduction events is illustrated below.

https://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?curid=20266475

Many effects of signal transduction are mediated by a sequence, or cascade of protein
phosphorylations catalyzed by protein kinases inside the cell. Here we will consider G
Protein-linked and enzyme-linked receptors.
315 Introduction to Signal Transduction
A. G-Protein Mediated Signal Transduction by PKA (Protein Kinase A)
GTP-binding proteins (G-Proteins) transduce extracellular signals by inducing
production of second messenger molecules in the cells. When hormones or other
effector (signal) molecules bind to their membrane receptors, an allosteric change
on the cytoplasmic domain of the receptor increases the affinity of the cytoplasmic
domain the receptor for G proteins on the inner plasma membrane surface. G
proteins are trimers consisting of ,  and  subunits, embedded in the cytoplasmic
surface of responsive cell membranes. G-protein-mediated signal transduction is
illustrated in the seven steps shown on the next page.
The receptor changes shape upon binding its effector signal molecule (steps 1, 2). In
this conformation, the receptor recognizes and binds to the G-protein trimer on the
cytoplasmic surface of the plasma membrane (step 3). Upon binding of the trimer to
the receptor, GTP displaces GDP on the  subunit of the G-protein (step 4).

CMB3e

447

Illustration by
G. Bergtrom

After a conformational change, the  subunit dissociates from the and  subunits
(step 5). In this illustration, the GTP- subunit can now bind to a transmembrane
enzyme, adenylate cyclase (step 6). Finally, the initial extracellular chemical signal is
transduced to an intracellular response involving second messenger molecules (step
7). In this case, the second messenger is cAMP. The well-known fight-or-flight
response to adrenaline in liver cells of higher animals is a good example of a cAMPmediated cellular response. After adrenalin binds to its receptors, G-proteins in turn
bind to the cytoplasmic side of the receptor, which then binds to adenylate cyclase.
cAMP binds to and activates protein kinase A (PKA), setting off the amplification
cascade response. Some details of a G-protein mediated signal amplification
cascade are detailed in the illustration on the next page.
After activation of adenylate cyclase (steps 1 and 2 in the drawing), cAMP is
synthesized and binds to two of the four subunits of an inactive PKA (step 3). A
conformational change dissociates the tetramer into two cAMP-bound inert subunits
and two active PKA subunits (step 4). Each active PKA enzyme catalyzes
phosphorylation and activation of an enzyme called phosphorylase kinase (step 5).

CMB3e

448

CMB3e

449

Illustration by G. Bergtrom

In step 6, phosphorylase kinase catalyzes glycogen phosphorylase phosphorylation.
Finally, at the end of the phosphorylation cascade, the now active glycogen
phosphorylase catalyzes the hydrolysis glycogen to glucose-1-phosphate (step 7).
This results in a rapid retrieval free glucose from liver cells into the circulation.
Remind yourself of how this works by reviewing the conversion of glucose-1
phosphate (G-1-P) to G-6-P in glycolysis and its fate in gluconeogenesis. Of course,
the increase in circulating glucose provides the energy for the fight-or-flight decision.
317 G-Protein Activation of Protein Kinase A and a Fight-or-Flight Response

In addition to activating enzymes that break down glycogen, cAMP-activated PKA
mediates cellular responses to different effectors resulting in a phosphorylation
cascade leading to
 activation of enzymes catalyzing glycogen synthesis.
 activation of lipases that hydrolyze fatty acids from triglycerides.
 microtubule assembly.
 microtubule disassembly.
 mitogenic effects (activation of enzymes of replication).
 activation of transcription factors increasing/decreasing gene expression.
Of course, when the cellular response is no longer needed by the organism, it must
stop producing the signal molecules (hormone or other effector). As their levels drop,
effector molecules dissociate from their receptors and the response stops. This is all
possible because binding of signals to their receptors is freely reversible! This is
animated for G-protein based signal transduction in the link below.
316 G-Protein Signal Transduction
C. Signal Transduction using PKC
Many responses involving G-proteins begin by activating the integral membrane
adenylate cyclase. A different G-protein-mediated signaling pathway generates other
second messengers. Protein kinase C (PKC) plays a major roles in the activating
these other second messengers and subsequent phosphorylation cascades in
which the activation of just a few enzyme molecules in the cell results in the activation
of many more enzymes. Like PKA, PKC-mediated signal transduction also amplifies
the cell’s first molecular response to the effector. The role of G-proteins is similar for
PKA and PKC signal transduction. Responses can include diverse effects in

CMB3e

450

different cells…, or even in the same cells using different effector signals. But, PKC
and PKA signal transduction differ in that PKC activation requires an additional step,
as well as the generation of two intracellular messenger molecules. The events
leading to the activation of PKC are illustrated below.

Illustration by G. Bergtrom

Here are details of the steps leading to PKC activation. An effector signal molecule
binds to its receptor, activating an integral membrane phospholipase C enzyme.
Phospholipase C catalyzes formation of cytosolic inositol triphosphate (IP3) and
membrane bound diacyl glycerol (DAG), two of those other intracellular second
messenger molecules. IP3 interacts with receptors on smooth endoplasmic
reticulum, causing the release of sequestered Ca++ ions into the cytoplasm. Finally,
Ca++ ions and DAG activate Protein Kinase C (PKC) that then initiates a
phosphorylation amplification cascade leading cell-specific responses.

Protein Kinase C mediated effects include:
 Neurotransmitter release.
 Hormone (growth hormone, leutinizing hormone, testosterone) secretion leading to
cell growth, division and differentiation.
 Glycogen hydrolysis, fat synthesis.
Additional independent phospholipase C effects include:
 Liver glycogen breakdown.
 Pancreatic amylase secretion.
 Platelet aggregation
PKA and PKC are serine-threonine kinases that they place phosphates on serine or
threonine in target polypeptides. Let’s consider tyrosine kinases next.
D. Receptor Tyrosine Kinase-Mediated Signal Transduction
The intracellular activity of these receptors is in the cytoplasmic domain of the receptor
itself. When bound to its effector, receptor-kinase catalyzes phosphorylation of
specific tyrosine amino acids in target proteins. While studying the action of nerve
growth factor (NGF) and epidermal growth factor (EGF) in stimulating growth and
differentiation of nerve and skin, Stanley Cohen and Rita Levi-Montalcini discovered
the EGF receptor, the first enzyme-linked tyrosine kinase…, and won the 1986 Nobel
Prize in Physiology or Medicine! Watch the animation of receptor kinase signal
transduction at the link below (a description is provided in the next few paragraphs).
319 Receptor Kinase Signal Transduction
Monomer membrane receptor kinases dimerize when they bind effector ligands, at
which point sulfhydryl group-containing SH2 proteins bind to each monomer. This
activates the kinase domain of the receptor. After multiple cross-phosphorylations of
the receptor monomers, the SH2 proteins fall away allowing the receptors to interact
with other cytoplasmic proteins to continue the response pathway. The characteristic
response to EGF and NGF signaling is cellular proliferation. Not surprisingly,
mutations correlated with cancer cells often lie in signaling pathways leading to cell
proliferation (growth and division). Cancer-causing genes, or oncogenes, were
actually first discovered in viruses, but J. Michael Bishop and Harold Varmus won the
1964 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for showing that cells were actually the
origin of a chicken retrovirus (the Rous Sarcoma Virus). Oncogenes turn out to be
mutations of genes for proteins in mitogenic signal transduction pathways. Under
normal circumstances, mitogenic chemical signals (like EGF) bind to their receptors
and induce target cells to begin dividing.
CMB3e

452

The Ras protein-mediated activation of a phosphorylation cascade leading to the MAP
(mitogen-activated protein) kinase is an example of such a signal transduction
pathway, one with a central role in many receptor kinase signaling pathways. The
Ras gene was one of those originally discovered as an oncogene whose mutation
leads to uncontrolled cell division, i.e., cancer. Ras gene/protein activity may in fact
be responsible for up to 30% of all cancers!
320 The RAS Oncogene, its Normal Mitogenic Effects and Cancer
MAP kinase phosphorylates transcription factors and other nuclear proteins that affect
gene activity leading to cell proliferation and differentiation, as shown below.

E. Signal Transduction in Evolution
We saw that signal transduction typically takes a few signal molecules interacting with
a few cell surface receptors to amplify a response in a cascade of enzymatic
reactions, typically phosphorylations, to activate (or inactivate) target proteins.
Amplification cascades can take a single effector-receptor interaction and magnify its
CMB3e

453

effect in the cell by orders of magnitude, making the signaling systems rapid and
highly efficient. The range of cellular and systemic (organismic) responses to the
same chemical signal is broad and complex. Different cell types can have receptors
for the same effector, but respond differently. For example, adrenalin targets cells of
the liver and blood vessels among others, with different effects in each. As it
happens, adrenaline is also a neurotransmitter. Apparently, as organisms evolved,
they became more complex in response to environmental imperatives, adapting by coopting already existing signaling systems in the service of new pathways. Just as the
same signal transduction event can lead to different pathways of response in different
cells, evolution has allowed different signal transduction pathways to engage in
crosstalk. This is when two different signal transduction pathways intersect in the
same cells. In one example, the cAMP produced at the front end of the PKA signaling
pathway can activate (or under the right circumstances, inhibit) enzymes in the MAP
kinase pathway. These effects result in changes in the levels of active or inactive
transcription factors and can therefore modulate the expression of a gene using two
(or more) signals. We are only beginning to understand what looks less like a linear
pathway and more like a web of signal transduction.

Chapter 18: The Cytoskeleton & Cell Motility
Microfilaments, intermediate filaments and microtubules – roles in cell structure,
secretion, cell migration and other organelle movements
I.

Introduction
The cell as it appears in a microscope was long thought to be a bag of liquid surrounded
by a membrane. The electron microscope revealed a cytoskeleton composed of thin
and thick rods, tubes and filaments. Other intracellular structures and organelles are
enmeshed in these microfilaments, intermediate filaments and microtubules. We will
compare the molecular compositions of these structures and their subunit proteins. In
aggregate, they account for organelle location in cells, the shapes of cells, and cell
motility. Cell motility includes the movement of cells and organisms, as well as the
internal movements of organelles (e.g., vesicles) and other structures in the cell. Of
course, these movements are not random…, and they require chemical energy! A long
and well-studied system of cell motility is the interaction of actin and myosin during
skeletal muscle contraction. We will first consider a paradox suggesting that ATP was
required for contraction BUT ALSO for relaxation of muscle fibers. Then we look at
experiments that resolve the paradox. Animals control skeletal muscle contraction, but
some muscles contract rhythmically or with little or no control on the part of the animal think cardiac muscles of the heart, or smooth muscles like those in digestive and
circulatory systems. We will also look at the role of calcium ions and regulatory proteins
in controlling the response of skeletal muscles our commands, and finally, at the elasticity
of skeletal muscles.

Introduction

Most eukaryotic cells look like a membrane-bound sac of cytoplasm containing a nucleus
and assorted organelles in a light microscope. In the late 19th century, microscopists
described a dramatic structural re-organization of dividing cells. In mitosis, duplicated
chromosomes (i.e., chromatids) condense in the nucleus just as the nuclear membrane
dissolves. Spindle fibers emerge and then seem to pull the chromatids apart to opposite
poles of the cell. Spindle fibers turn out to be bundles of microtubules, each of which is a
polymer of tubulin proteins. Let’s look below at that fluorescence micrograph of a
mitosing metaphase cell again; most of the cell other than what is fluorescing is not
visible in the micrograph.

To get this image, antibodies were made against purified microtubule, kinetochore and
chromosomal proteins (or DNA), and then linked to different fluorophores (organic
molecular fluorescent tags). When the fluorophores were added to dividing cells in
CMB3e

457

metaphase, they bound to their respective fibers. Upon UV light irradiation, the
fluorophores emit different colors of visible light, visible in a fluorescence microscope.
Microtubules are green, metaphase chromosomes are blue and kinetochores are red in
the micrograph.
Both mitosis and meiosis are very visible examples of movements within cells, both
already described by the late 19th century. As for movement in whole organisms, mid20th century studies focused on what the striations (or stripes) seen in skeletal muscle
in the light microscope might have to do with muscle contraction. The striations turned
out to be composed of a protein complex originally named actomyosin (acto for active;
myosin for muscle). Electron microscopy later revealed that actomyosin (or
actinomyosin) is composed of thin filaments (actin) and thick filaments (myosin) that
slide past one another during muscle contraction.
Electron microscopy also hinted at a more complex cytoplasmic structure of cells in
general. The cytoskeleton consists of fine rods and tubes in more or less organized
states that permeate the cell. The most abundant of these cytoskeletal components are
microfilaments, microtubules and intermediate filaments. But, even myosin is
present in non-muscle cells, albeit at relatively low concentrations. Microtubules
account for chromosome movements of mitosis and meiosis, while together with
microfilaments (i.e., actin), they enable organelle movement inside cells (you may have
seen cytoplasmic streaming of Elodea chloroplasts in a biology lab exercise).
Microtubules also underlie cilia- and flagella-based motility of whole cells such as
paramecium, amoeba, phagocytes, etc., while actin microfilaments and myosin enable
muscle and thus higher animal movement! Finally, the cytoskeleton is a dynamic
structure. Its fibers not only account for the movements of cell division, but they also give
cells mechanical strength and unique shapes. All of the fibers can disassemble,
reassemble and rearrange, allowing cells to change shape, for example, creating
pseudopods in amoeboid cells and spindle fibers of mitosis and meiosis. In this chapter
we look at the molecular basis of cell structure and different forms of cell motility

II. The Molecular Structure and Sub-Cellular Organization of
Cytoskeletal Components
Of the three main cytoskeletal fibers, intermediate filaments serve a mainly structural role
in cells. Microtubules and microfilaments have dual functions, dynamically maintaining
cell shape and enabling cell motility. For example, when attached to the plasma
membrane, microfilaments maintain cell shape. However, by interacting with motor
proteins (e.g., myosin), they can pull or push against a muscle cell membrane, changing
the shape of the cell. Likewise, motor proteins such as dynein and kinesin can move
‘cargo’ to and fro along microtubule tracks from one point to another in the cell. We will

CMB3e

458

look at how motor proteins interact with microtubules and microfilaments shortly. At this
point, let’s take another look at the drawings and micrographs of the three main
cytoskeletal filaments of eukaryotic cells (below) that we saw earlier in the text.

321 Introduction to the Cytoskeleton
The location and general functions of microtubules, microfilaments and intermediate
filaments were demonstrated by immunofluorescence microscopy. After exposing cells to
fluorophore-tagged antibodies against either microtubule, microfilament (actin) or
intermediate filament proteins, fluorescence micrographs of the stained cells revealed the
different locations of the fibers in cells.

These localizations are consistent with known functions of the major cytoskeletal
component filaments in cell structure and motility.
Despite the small size of prokaryotic cells, they too were recently found have previously
unsuspected cytoplasmic structures that could serve as a cytoskeleton (ncbi-A
Prokaryotic Cytoskeleton?). So perhaps all (not just eukaryotic) cells are more than an
unorganized bag of fluid sap! Next, we consider specific roles of microtubules,
microfilaments, intermediate filaments and related proteins in the eukaryotic cytoskeleton.

A. Microtubules – an Overview
Microtubules assemble from dimers of -tubulinand-tubulin monomers. After
formation,  -tubulin dimers add to a growing, or plus end (+end), fueled by GTP
hydrolysis. Disassembly at the -end of microtubules powers changing the shape of
cells or the separation and movement of chromatids to opposite poles of cells during
cell division (i.e., mitosis or meiosis). Isolated single microtubules were shown to grow
by addition to one end and to disassemble at the opposite end, thus distinguishing the
+ends and -ends. A summary of this experiment demonstrating microtubule polarity
is in the link below.
323 Demonstration of the Polarity and Dynamics of Microtubules
Microtubules in most cells can seem disordered. In interphase, they tend to radiate
from centrioles in non-dividing animal cells, without forming discrete structures.
However, in the run-up to cell division, microtubules reorganize to form spindle fibers.
This reorganization is nucleated from centrioles in animal cells and from a more
amorphous microtubule organizing center (MTOC) in plant cells. A typical centriole
(or basal body) in has a ‘9 triplet’ microtubule array as seen in the electron
micrograph cross section (below).

1. The Two Kinds of Microtubules in Spindle Fibers
a) Kinetochore Microtubules
Duplicated chromosomes condense in prophase of mitosis and meiosis,
forming visible paired chromatids attached at their centromeres. Specific
proteins associate with centromeres to make a kinetochore during
condensation. As the spindle apparatus forms, some spindle fibers attach to
the kinetochore; these are the kinetochore microtubules. By metaphase,
bundles of kinetochore microtubules stretch from the kinetochores at the cell
center to the polar centrioles or MTOCs of the dividing cell, as drawn below.
Illustration by G. Bergtrom

We now know that the +ends of kinetochore microtubules are in fact at the
kinetochores, where these fibers are assembled! At anaphase, forces
generated when microtubules shorten at their –ends (disassembly ends)
separate the chromatids. Microtubule disassembly at centrioles/MTOCs
provides the force that draws daughter chromosomes to the opposite poles of
the cell as cell division continues.

CMB3e

462

b) Polar Microtubules
The spindle fiber polar microtubules extend from centrioles/MTOCs at
opposite poles of the cell. They do not bind to kinetochores of chromatids, but
instead, overlap at the center of the dividing cells. As kinetochore microtubules
pull at chromatids in anaphase, polar microtubules slide past one another in
opposite directions, pushing apart the poles of the cell. In this
case, dynein (a motor protein attached to microtubules) catalyzes ATP
hydrolysis to power microtubule sliding. Dynein motors on the microtubules
from one pole of the cell in effect, ‘walk’ along overlapping microtubules
extending from the opposite pole. The role of microtubule disassembly at the
centrioles (i.e., at the minus end) was demonstrated in a clever experiment in
which a tiny laser beam was aimed into a cell at spindle fibers attached to the
kinetochore of a pair of chromatids (see this animated at the link below).
324 Spindle Fiber Microtubules Generate Force on Chromatids
2. Microtubules in Cilia and Flagella
The microtubules of cilia or flagella emerge from a basal body, shown at the left in
the electron micrograph below.

Basal bodies are structurally similar to centrioles, organized as a ring of nine
microtubule triplets. Cilia and flagella formation begin at basal bodies but show a
typical 9+2 arrangement (9 outer doublet plus 2 central microtubules) in cross

section (shown in the micrograph, above right). After detergent treatment to
remove the membranes of isolated cilia or flagella, the remaining axonemes
preserve the 9+2 microtubule arrangement.
The structural relationship between the axonemes of a cilium or flagellum and an
individual microtubule are shown in the cross sections below.

It is possible to see the tubulin subunits that make up a microtubule polymer in
cross section. Each tubule is made up of a ring of 13 tubulin subunits. The
microtubules in the ‘doublets’ share tubulins, but are also composed of 13 tubulins.
When fully formed, the 25 nm diameter microtubules appear to be a hollow
cylinder. When microtubules are isolated, they typically come along with dynein
motor proteins and other Microtubule-Associated Proteins (MAPs), some of
which hold microtubules together in an axoneme.
3. Microtubule Motor Proteins Move Cargo from Place to Place in Cells
Motor proteins such as dynein and kinesin, are ATPases; they use the free energy
of ATP hydrolysis to power intracellular motility. Let’s take a closer look at how
these two major motor proteins carry cargo from place to place inside of cells.
Organelles are a typical cargo. Examples include vesicles formed at the trans

CMB3e

464

Golgi face containing secretory proteins, pigments or neurotransmitters.
Secretory vesicles move along microtubule tracks to the plasma membrane for
exocytosis. Vesicles containing neurotransmitters move from the cell body of
neurons along microtubule tracks in the axons, reaching the nerve ending where
they become synaptic vesicles. In a chameleon, pigment vesicles in skin cells
disperse or aggregate along microtubule tracks to change skin color to match the
background.
Motor proteins carry cargo vesicles in opposite directions. The transport of
neurotransmitters is a well-understood example. Neurotransmitter vesicles arise
from the endomembrane system in neuron cell bodies. Powered by ATP, kinesin
powers anterograde vesicle movement from the cell body to nerve endings. In
contrast, an ATP-dependent dynein motor, as part of a dynactin complex, powers
retrograde movement of empty vesicles back to the cell body. Motor protein
structure and action are below.

At this point, we can look at several specific kinds of cell motility involving
microtubules and microfilaments.
4. The Motor Protein Dynein Enables Axonemes to Bend
Take a look at the cross-section of axonemes a few illustrations ago. In the 9+2
axoneme of cilia and flagella, dynein arms attached to the A tubules of the outer
doublets walk along the B tubules of the adjacent doublet. If only the doublets on
one side of an axoneme take a walk while those on the other side hold still, the
microtubules will slide past one another and the axoneme (and therefore a cilium
or flagellum) will bend. However, microtubule sliding is constrained by flexible
nexin and radial spoke attachments. The movements of cilia and flagella are
illustrated below.

CC-BY 3.0; From: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Flagellum-beating.svg

The differences in flagellar motion (wave-like propeller) and ciliary motion (single
plane, back and forth beat) result in part from which microtubules are sliding at a
given moment and the nature of their restraint by axoneme proteins. Let’s look at
some experiments that demonstrate these events.

CMB3e

466

Experiments on isolated axonemes demonstrate the sliding microtubule
mechanism of ciliary and flagellar motility. In one experiment, isolated flagella and
purified axonemes were both shown to ‘beat’ in the presence of added ATP
(below).

Illustration by G. Bergtrom

Agitating sperm or ciliated cells in a high-speed blender for a few seconds will
shear and detach flagella or cilia from the rest of the cell. Adding ATP to detached
cilia or flagella will cause them to beat, a phenomenon easily seen in a light
microscope. Axonemes isolated from detached cilia or flagella by detergent
treatment (to disrupt membranes) retain their characteristic 9+2 microtubule
arrangement as well as other ultrastructural features…, and will even ‘beat’ in the
presence of ATP!
326 9+2 Microtubule Array in Axonemes that Beat
Additional detergent treatment removes radial spokes, nexin and other proteins
from the axoneme, causing the microtubules to separate. Dissociated microtubule
doublets and central ‘singlets’ can then be observed in the electron microscope.

CMB3e

467

When separated microtubules are dialyzed to remove the detergents, the doublet
microtubules re-associate, forming sheets, as shown in the cartoon below.

Illustration by G. Bergtrom

ATP added to these ‘reconstituted’ microtubule doublets causes the microtubules
to separate as the ATP is hydrolyzed. When such preparations are fixed for
electron microscopy immediately after adding the ATP, they are caught in the act
of sliding. See this animated in the first link below.

C. Microfilaments – Structure and Role in Muscle Contraction
At 7 nm in diameter, microfilaments (actin filaments) are the thinnest cytoskeletal
component. Globular actin (G-actin) monomers polymerize to form linear F-actin
polymers. Two polymers then combine to form the twin-helical actin microfilament. As
with microtubules, microfilaments have a +end to which new actin monomers are
added to assemble F-actin, and a –end at which they disassemble when they are in

CMB3e

468

a dynamic state, such as when a cell is changing shape. When one end of a
microfilament is anchored to a cellular structure, for example to plaques in the cell
membrane, motor proteins like myosin can use ATP to generate a force that deforms
the plasma membrane and thus, the shape of the cell. One of the best-studied
examples of myosin/actin interaction is in skeletal muscle where the sliding of highly
organized thick myosin rods and the thin actin microfilaments results in muscle
contraction.
1. Thick and Thin Filaments of Skeletal Muscle Contraction
Bundles of parallel muscle cells make up a skeletal muscle. Light microscopy of
skeletal muscle thin sections show striated muscle cells (myocytes, below).

CC-BY-SA, 3.0; Adapted from https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Skeletal_striated_muscle.jpg

The dark purplish structures surrounding the myocyte are mitochondria, which will
provide the ATP to fuel contraction. Skeletal muscle is made up of ‘aligned’,
bundled myocytes. The bundled myocytes (also called myofibers) are further
organized into fascicles that are finally bundled into a muscle. The blowout
illustration on the next page shows this anatomical organization and fine structure
of a muscle (left panel).
High-resolution electron microscopy from the 1940s revealed the fine structure of
skeletal muscle (right panel of the illustration), allowing characterization of the
sarcomere. The dark bands of the striations in the light micrograph of myocytes
are regions of aligned, adjacent sarcomeres. A pair of Z lines demarcate a
sarcomere (Z for zwischen, German for between). The I band is a relatively clear
region of the sarcomere, largely made up of thin (actin) microfilaments. The A
band at the center of the sarcomere consists of overlapping thin and thick (actin
and myosin) filaments, while the H zone is a region where myosin does not
overlap actin filaments. An M line lies at the center of the H zone. Multiple
repeating sarcomeres of myocytes aligned in register in the fascicles give the
appearance of striations in whole muscles.

with the sliding of thick and thin filaments during contraction. Additional key
structures of the sarcomere can be seen in the drawing at the right.

Note that in the sarcomeres of a contracted muscle cell, the H zone has almost
disappeared. While the width of the A band has not changed after contraction, the
width of the I bands has decreased and the Z-lines are closer in the contracted
sarcomere. The best explanation here was the Sliding Filament Hypothesis
(model) of skeletal muscle contraction.
330 The Sliding Filament Model of Skeletal Muscle Contraction
3. The Contraction Paradox: Contraction and Relaxation Require ATP
The role of ATP in fueling the movement of sliding filaments during skeletal muscle
contraction was based in part on experiments with glycerinated fibers (muscle
fibers soaked in glycerin to permeabilize the plasma membrane). The soluble
cytoplasmic components leak out of glycerinated fibers, but leave the sarcomere
structures intact, as visualized by electron microscopy. Investigators found that, if
ATP and calcium were added back to glycerinated fibers, the ATP was hydrolyzed
and the fiber could still contract… and even lift a weight!

CMB3e

471

The contraction of a glycerinated muscle fiber in the presence of ATP is illustrated
below.
Illustration by G. Bergtrom

When assays showed that all of the added ATP had been hydrolyzed, the muscle
remained contracted. It would not relax, even with the weight it had lifted still
attached! Attempting to manually force the muscle back to its relaxed position
didn’t work. But the fiber could be stretched when fresh ATP was added to the
preparation! Moreover, if the experimenter let go immediately after stretching the
fiber, it would again contract and lift the weight! A cycle of forced stretching and
contraction could be repeated until all of the added ATP was hydrolyzed. At that
point, the fiber would again no longer contract…, or if contracted, could no longer
be stretched.
The contraction paradox then, was that ATP hydrolysis was required for muscle
contraction as well as for relaxation (stretching). The paradox was resolved when
the functions of the molecular actors in contraction were finally understood. Here
we review some of the classic experiments that led to this understanding.

An early experiment hinted at the interaction of actin and myosin in contraction.
Homogenates of skeletal muscle were viscous. The viscous component was
isolated and shown to contain a substance that was called actomyosin (acto,
active; myosin, muscle substance). Under appropriate conditions, adding ATP to
actomyosin preparations caused a decrease in viscosity. However, after the added
ATP was hydrolyzed, the mixture became viscous again. Extraction of the nonviscous preparation (before it re-congealed and before the ATP was consumed)
led to the biochemical separation of two the main substances we now recognize as
the actin and myosin filaments of contraction. What’s more, adding these
components back together reconstituted the viscous actomyosin extract (now
referred to as actinomyosin to reflect its composition). And…, adding ATP to the
reconstituted solution eliminated its viscosity. The ATP-dependent viscosity
changes of actinomyosin solutions were consistent with an ATP-dependent
separation of thick and thin filaments. Perhaps actin and myosin also separate in
glycerinated muscles exposed to ATP, allowing them to stretch and relax.
The advent of electron microscopy provided further evidence of a role for ATP in
both contraction and relaxation of skeletal muscle The purification of skeletal
muscle actin (still attached to Z Lines) from myosin is cartooned below, showing
what the separated components looked like in the electron microscope.

Next, when actin (still attached to Z-Lines) and myosin were mixed, electron
microscopy of the resulting viscous material revealed thin filaments interdigitating
with thick filaments. The result of this reconstitution experiment is shown below.

Illustration by G. Bergtrom

As expected, when ATP was added to these extracts, the solution viscosity
dropped, and electron microscopy that the revealed thick (myosin) and thin (actin)
filaments had again separated. The two components could again be isolated and
separated by centrifugation.
In yet further experiments, actinomyosin preparations could be spread on over an
aqueous surface, forming a film on the surface of the water. When ATP was
added to the water, the film visibly “contracted”, pulling away from the edges of
the vessel, reducing its surface area! Electron microscopy of the film revealed
shortened sarcomere-like structures with closely spaced Z lines and short I
bands…, further confirming the sliding filament model of muscle contraction.

When actin and myosin were further purified from isolated actinomyosin, the thick
myosin rods could be dissociated into large ~599Kd myosin monomers. Thus,
thick filaments are massive polymers of myosin monomers! The molecular
structure of myosin thick filaments is shown below.

An early observation of isolated actin filaments was that they had no ATPase
activity. On the other hand, while isolated myosin preparations did have an
ATPase activity, they would only catalyze ATP hydrolysis very slowly compared to
intact muscle fibers. Faster ATP hydrolysis occurred only if myosin filaments were
mixed with microfilaments (either on, or detached from Z-lines). In the electron
microscope, isolated myosin protein monomers appeared to have a double-head
and single tail regions. Biochemical analysis showed that the myosin monomers
themselves were composed of the two heavy chain and two pairs of light chain
polypeptides shown in the illustration above.

Proteolytic enzymes that hydrolyze peptide linkages only between specific amino
acids, can ‘cut’ the heavy chains of myosin monomers into S1 (head) and tail
fragments. Electron micrographs of these two fragments after separation by
ultracentrifugation are shown above. S1 fragments were shown to have a slow
ATPase activity, while the tails had none. The slow activity was not an artifact of
isolation; mixing the S1 fraction with isolated actin filaments resulted in a higher
rate of ATP hydrolysis. Clearly, myosin heads are ATPases that interact with actin
microfilaments.

The direct demonstration of an association of S1 myosin head fragments with
rabbit smooth muscle actin microfilaments is shown below.

bodies and actin polarity in vertebrate smooth muscle. The Journal of Cell Biology. 1982;95(2):403-413.

Just as for skeletal muscle, smooth muscle contraction is due to actin-myosin
sliding, though smooth muscle is not striated and lacks sarcomere morphology; a
white arrow in the micrograph points to one of several myosin (thick) filaments
visible in the micrograph. The interaction of the S1 myosin heads with actin
filaments dramatically alters their morphology. In this image, the diagonal stripes,
or arrowhead-like appearance of the S1-actin binding all along actin filaments
indicates that F-actin filaments are polar, with a plus (+) and a minus (–) end, as
was expected.
The same “decoration” of microfilaments with arrowheads is seen when S1 heads
(or even intact myosin monomers) bind to thin sections of skeletal muscle
sarcomeres, preparations of actin still attached to the Z lines, and with isolated Factin preparations. These images are consistent with the requirement that myosin
must bind to actin to achieve a maximum rate of ATPase activity during
contraction.

CMB3e

477

The arrowheads on decorated actin still attached to Z lines always face in opposite
directions, as shown below.

Illustration by G. Bergtrom

These opposing arrowheads, consistent with the sliding filament model of
contraction in which bipolar thick filament pull actin filaments towards each other
from opposite sides of the myosin rods, drawing the Z-lines closer together and
shortening sarcomeres.

5. Allosteric Change and the Micro-Contraction Cycle
Whereas dynein and kinesin are motor proteins that ‘walk’ along microtubules, the
myosin monomer is a motor protein that walks along microfilaments. In each case,
these motor proteins are ATPases that use free energy of ATP hydrolysis to effect
conformational changes that result in the walking, i.e., motility. In skeletal muscle,
allosteric changes in myosin heads enable the myosin rods to do the walking along
F-actin filaments.

CMB3e

478

When placed in sequence such different myosin head conformations are likely the
same as would occur during a micro-contraction cycle (illustrated below).

To help you follow the sequence, follow the small red dot on a single monomer in
the actin filament. Here are the steps:
a. In the presence of Ca++ ions, myosin binding sites on actin are open (Ca++regulation of muscle contraction is discussed in more detail below).
b. Myosin heads with attached ADP and Pi bind to open sites on actin filaments.
c. The result of actin-myosin binding is an allosteric change in the myosin head, a
bending of the hinge region, that pulls the attached microfilament (follow the red
dot - it has moved from right to left!). This bit of micro-sliding of actin along
myosin is the power stroke.
d. In its ‘bent’ conformation, the myosin head, still bound to an actin monomer in
the F-actin, binds ATP, causing ADP and Pi to come off the myosin head and
dissociating it from the actin.

CMB3e

479

e. Once dissociated from actin, myosin heads catalyze ATP hydrolysis, resulting
in another conformational change. The head, still bound to ADP and Pi, has
bent at its hinge, taking on a high-energy conformation that stores the energy
of ATP hydrolysis.
f. The stored free energy is released during the power stroke. Or…, if Ca++ has
been removed, the myosins remain in the high-energy conformation of step e,
until a release of Ca++ again signals contraction.
Micro-contraction cycles of actin sliding along myosin continue as long as ATP is
available. During repetitive micro-contraction cycles, myosin heads on the thick
filaments pull actin filaments attached to Z-lines, bringing the Z lines closer to each
other. The result is shortening of the sarcomere and ultimately, of muscle cells
and the entire muscle. In the absence of ATP (as after the death of an organism),
the micro-contraction cycle is interrupted. All myosin heads will remain bound to
the actin filaments in the state of muscle contraction or relaxation (stretch) at the
time of death. This is rigor mortis at the molecular level (see the illustration
above). At the level of whole muscle, rigor mortis results in the inability to stretch
or otherwise move body parts when ATP is, once and for all, depleted.
6. Resolving the Contraction Paradox
The myosin head micro-contraction cycle resolves the contraction paradox:
 ATP is necessary for muscle contraction: In step e in the illustration above,
as ATP on myosin heads is hydrolyzed, the heads change from a low-energy to
a high-energy conformation. The myosin heads can now bind to actin
monomers (step b in the micro-contraction cycle). This results in of the power
stroke (step c), where free energy released by an allosteric change in myosin,
pulls the actin along the myosin, in effect causing a micro-shortening of the
sarcomere, in other words, contraction!
 ATP is necessary for muscle relaxation: At the end of step c, myosin
remains bound to actin until ATP can again bind to the myosin head. Binding of
ATP in step d displaces ADP and inorganic phosphate (Pi)… and breaks actinmyosin cross-bridges. A removal of Ca++ from sarcomeres at the end of a
contraction event blocks myosin binding sites on actin, while the rapid breakage
of actin-myosin cross-bridges by ATP-myosin binding allows muscle relaxation
and the sliding apart of the actin and myosin filaments (i.e., stretching). This
leaves the myosin heads in the ‘cocked’ (high-energy) conformation, ready for
the next round of contraction.
To summarize, ATP-myosin binding breaks actin-myosin cross-bridges. The
muscle can then relax and stretch. Free energy of ATP hydrolysis, now stored in a
high-energy myosin conformation, is released during the microcontraction power
stroke.
CMB3e

Electron microscopic examination of myosin monomer heads at different ionic
strengths or when bound to antibodies (as shown below), provides visual evidence
that myosin heads are flexible and can take on alternate stable conformations, as
would be expected during the micro-contraction cycle.

7. Ca++ Ions Regulate Skeletal Muscle Contraction
Typically, the neurotransmitter acetylcholine released by a motor neuron binds to
receptors on muscle cells to initiate contraction. In early experiments, Ca++ was
required, along with ATP, to get glycerinated skeletal muscle to contract. It was
later demonstrated that Ca++ ions were stored in the sarcoplasmic reticulum, the
smooth endoplasmic reticulum of muscle cells. As we have seen, an action
potential generated in the cell body of a neuron propagates along an axon to the
nerve terminal, or synapse. In a similar fashion, an action potential generated at a
neuromuscular junction travels along the sarcolemma (the muscle plasma
membrane) to points where it is continuous with transverse tubules (T-tubules).
The action potential then moves along the T-tubules and then along the
membranes of the sarcoplasmic reticulum. This propagation of an action potential
opens Ca++ channels in the sarcoplasmic reticulum. The Ca++ released bathes the
sarcomeres of the myofibrils, allowing filaments to slide (i.e., contraction).

CMB3e

481

The action potential at a neuromuscular junction that initiates contraction is
summarized in the illustration below.

Ca++ ions released from the sarcoplasmic reticulum bathe the myofibrils, where
they bind to one of three troponin molecules to regulate skeletal muscle
contraction.

The three troponins and a tropomyosin molecule are bound to actin filaments..
Experiments using anti-troponin and anti-tropomyosin antibodies localize these
proteins on thin filaments spaced at regular intervals in electron micrographs.
The drawing below models this association of the troponin subunits and
tropomyosin with the thin filaments.

In resting muscle, tropomyosin (a fibrous protein) lies along the actin filament
where it covers up the myosin binding sites of seven G-actin subunits in the
microfilament. In this conformation, troponin T (tropomyosin-binding troponin)
and troponin I (inhibitory troponin) hold the tropomyosin in place.

CMB3e

483

The ‘cross-section illustration below illustrates the role conformational changes in
troponin C upon binding Ca++ in regulating contraction.

Illustration by G. Bergtrom

A chain reaction of conformational changes begins when Ca++ ions bind to
troponin-C. The result is that the three-subunit troponin complexes bound to
tropomyosin shift position along the filament to expose the myosin-binding sites on
the G-actin subunits. Only after this shift can ATP-bound myosin in turn bind to
actin and initiate the micro-contraction cycle discussed earlier. The regulation of
contraction by Ca++ is animated in the link below.

8. Muscle Contraction Generates Force
Contraction by ATP-powered sliding of thin along thick filaments generates force
on the Z-lines. In three dimensions, the Z-lines are actually Z-disks) to which the
actin thin filaments are attached. The protein -actinin in the Z-disks anchors the
ends of the actin filaments to the disks so that when the filaments slide, the Z-disks
are drawn closer, shortening the sarcomeres. Another Z-disk protein, desmin, is
an intermediate filament organized around the periphery of Z-disks. Desmin
connects multiple Z-disks in a myofibril. By keeping the Z-Disks in register, muscle
cell, and ultimately, muscle contraction is coordinated. Finally, actin filaments at
the ends of the cell must be connected to the cell membrane for a muscle cell to
shorten during myofibril contraction. Several proteins, including syntrophins and
dystrophin (another intermediate filament protein) anchor the free ends of
microfilaments coming from Z-disks to the cell membrane.
Still other proteins anchor the cell membrane in this region to the extracellular
matrix (tendons) that are in turn, attached to bones! Force generated by myosin
hydrolysis of ATP and the sliding of filaments in individual sarcomeres are thus
transmitted to the ends of muscles to effect movement. If the name dystrophin
sounds familiar, it should! The gene and its protein were named for a mutation
that causes muscular dystrophy, resulting in a progressive muscle weakening.
338 Contraction Generates Force Against Z Disks and Cell Membranes
9. The Elastic Sarcomere: Do Myosin Rods Just Float in the Sarcomere?
In fact, myosin rods are anchored to proteins in the Z discs and M-lines. In 1954,
R. Natori realized that when contracted muscle relaxes, it lengthens beyond its
resting state, then shortening again to its resting length. He proposed that this
elasticity must be due to a fiber in the sarcomere. Twenty-five years later, the
elastic structure was identified as titin, a protein that holds several molecular
records! The gene for titin contains the largest number of exons (363) of known
proteins. After actin and myosin, titin is also the most abundant protein in muscle
cells. At almost 4 x 106 Da, the aptly named titin is the also the largest known
polypeptide. Extending from the Z discs to the M line of sarcomeres, titin coils
around thick filaments along the way. Titin is anchored at Z-disks by -actinin and
telethonin proteins. At the M-line, titin binds to myosin-binding protein C
(MYBPC3) and calmodulin, among others (e.g., myomesin, obscurin and
skelamin). Some if not all of these proteins must participate in keeping the
myosin thick filaments positioned and in register in the sarcomere. This is similar
to how Z-disks bind the ends of actin filaments to keep sarcomeres in register.
CMB3e

485

The location of titin and several other sarcomere proteins is illustrated below.

Coiled titin molecules (in red in the illustration) extend from the Z to M lines. The
colorized electron micrograph of one extended titin molecule in the middle of the
illustration above should convince you of the length (35,213 amino acids!) of this
huge polypeptide! Titin’s elastic features are largely in the region labeled P in the
micrograph, between Z discs and the myosin rods. The many domains of this P
region are shown at the bottom of the illustration. With all the binding (and other)
functions, you might expect that titin has many domains. It does! They include Ig
(immunoglobulin) domains, fibronectin domains (not shown here), PEVK and
N2A domains (that helps bind titin to -actinin in Z-disks). Which and how many Ig
and/or PEVK domains are present in a particular muscle depends on which
alternative splicing pathway is used to form a titin mRNA.
Over a micron long, Titin functions as a molecular spring, as Natori predicted. Its
coiled domains compress during contraction, passively storing some of the energy
of contraction. When skeletal muscle relaxes, Ca++ is withdrawn from the
sarcomere, ATP displaces ADP from myosin heads and actin and myosin
dissociate. The muscle then stretches, typically under the influence of gravity or

CMB3e

486

an opposing set of muscles. However, during contraction, 244 individually folded
protein domains of titin were compressed, and during relaxation, these domains
de-compress; the stored energy of compression also helps to power relaxation. At
the same time, titin connections limit the stretch so that a potentially overstretched
muscle can ‘bounce’ back to its normal relaxed length.
In a particularly elegant experiment, R. Linke et al. provided a visual demonstration
of myofiber elasticity consistent with the coiled spring model of titin structure.
They made antibodies to peptide domains on either side of the PEVK domain of
titin (N2A and I20-I22) and attached them to nanogold particles (which will
appear as electron dense granules in transmission electron microscopy). Then
individual myofibers were stretched to different lengths, fixed for electron
microscopy and treated with the nanogold-linked antibodies. The antibodies
localize to and define the boundaries of the titin PEVK domains. The image below
does not show original immune-stained electron micrographs but show alternate
sarcomere micrographs with simulated localization of nanogold particles, reflecting
actual results.

nanogold particles and elongating parts of the sarcomere to illustrate results of work from the laboratory of Wolfgang Linke.

In the experiment, increased stretch lengthened the I bands on either side of Z
lines of sarcomeres (blue bars). Likewise, the titin PEVK domains also lengthened
as is evident from the increased distance between the nanogold-linked N2A and
120/122 antibodies that bind on either side PEVK domains. This demonstration of

CMB3e

487

titin (and therefore sarcomere) elasticity) is consistent with the storage of some of
the free energy of contraction when the molecule is compressed, and the passive
release of that energy during relaxation. Since titin tethers thick filaments to Zdisks and M-lines, it also limits the amount of sarcomere stretch during relaxation.
An animation from Linke’s lab is at http://www.titin.info/.
D. Non-muscle Microfilaments
Electron microscopy revealed that thin (~10 nm) filaments permeated the cytoskeleton
of eukaryotic cells. These were suspected to be actin microfilaments. Microfilaments
typically lie in the cortex of cells, just under the plasma membrane, where they support
cell shape. These same microfilaments can also re-organize dynamically, allowing
cells to change shape. A dramatic example of this occurs in dividing cells, during
cytokinesis when the dividing cell forms a cleavage furrow in the middle of the cell.
The cortical microfilaments slide past each other with the help of non-muscle myosin,
progressively pinching the cell until it divides into two new cells.
To test whether these 10 nm ‘microfilaments’ were in fact actin, intact myosin
monomers or S1 myosin head fragments were placed atop electron micrographs of
many different cell types. When viewed in the electron microscope, such preparations
always revealed that the 10 nm microfilaments were decorated with arrowheads, just
like S1 fragment decorated muscle cell actin or Z line-bound actin! Clearly, these
cytoplasmic microfilaments are a form of F-actin. In the example shown below, cells
in cytokinesis were treated with S1 myosin head fragments.

See the role of cortical filaments in cytokinesis at Cortical Actin Filament Action in
Cytokinesis. Of course, actin microfilaments are involved in all manner of cell motility
in addition to their role in cell division. They enable cell movement and cytoplasmic
streaming inside cells. And while they give intestinal microvilli strength, they even
enable microvilli to move independent of the passive pressures of peristalsis.
Other examples of microfilaments in cell motility include the ability of amoeba and
other phagocytic cells to extend pseudopodia to engulf food or foreign particles (e.g.,
bacteria), respectively. Similarly, when fibroblast cells move along surfaces, they
extend thin filipodia into the direction of movement by assembling actin bundles along
the axis of cell movement. Actin stress fibers that help to maintain cell shape

dual roles of actin in fibroblast movement are also illustrated (below right).

As we saw for microtubule-mediated cell motility, some actin-mediated motility may be
primarily based on actin assembly and disassembly, as in the extension of filipodia at
the moving front of a fibroblast. As the fibroblast moves forward, a retraction fiber at
the hind-end of the cell remains attached to the surface (substratum) along which it is
migrating. Eventually however, actin-myosin interactions (in fact, sliding) causes
retraction of most of this ‘fiber’ back into the body of the cell.
Movements mediated by stress fibers may also explain the cytoplasmic streaming that
distributes cellular components and nutrients throughout a cell. The movements of
both involve actin-myosin interactions. Studies of non-muscle cell motility suggest the
CMB3e

structure and interacting molecular components of stress fibers. They reveal
overlapping myosin and actin filaments that slide during movement, as illustrated
below.

Filamin in this drawing is shown holding actin filaments together at an angle, while actinin also helps to bundle the actin (thin) filaments. Titin (not shown) also seems to
be associated with stress fibers. However, unlike highly organized skeletal muscle
sarcomeres, the proteins and filaments in stress fibers are not part of Z- or M-line
superstructures. Could such less-organized non-muscle stress fiber filament bundles
be the evolutionary predecessor to sarcomeres in muscle cells?

E. Actins and Myosins are Encoded by Large Gene Families
Actins may be the most abundant protein in cells! At least six different actin isoforms
encoded by a large actin gene family have nearly identical amino acid sequences, all
of which are involved in cytoskeletal function. The -actin isoform predominates.
Genes for some isoforms are expressed in a cell-specific manner.
Are all actin isoforms functionally significant? Myosin monomers (or S1 heads)
decorate virtually all actins. This makes one wonder if any one actin is an adaptation,
however subtle, such that the absence of one isoform would pose a significant threat
to the survival of an organism? Since amino acid sequence differences between
actins would not predict dramatically different protein function, could they underlie
some as yet unknown physiological advantage to different cells? In mice, the loss of a
-actin gene has little effect on the organism, while loss of the -actin gene in mice is
lethal at embryonic stages. In contrast, studies show that a mutated -actin gene in
humans correlate with delayed development and later neurological problems (e.g.,
epilepsy), kidney and heart abnormalities, but is not lethal. In fact, people with such
mutations can lead nearly normal, healthy lives (Beta-Actin Gene Mutations and
Disease).
Like the actins, myosin genes encoding variant isoforms comprise a large eukaryotic
gene family. All isoforms have ATPase activity and some are clearly involved in cell
motility. Unique functions are not yet known for other isoforms, but different myosin
monomers can decorate actin, and myosins from one species can decorate actin
filaments of other species, even across wide phylogenetic distances.
F. Intermediate Filaments – an Overview
These 10 nm filaments are proteins with extended secondary structure that in fact, do
not readily fold into tertiary structures, and they have no enzymatic activity. Recall
their intercellular location in desmosomes where they firmly bind cells together to
confer tensile strength to tissues. Within cells, intermediate filaments permeate the
cells where they participate in regulating and maintaining cell shape. Recall their role
in anchoring actin to either Z-disks or plasma membrane plaques in muscle cells,
transmitting the forces of contraction to the shortening of the sarcomeres and then to
the actual shortening of a muscle. The extracellular keratins that make up fur, hair,
fingernails and toenails, are proteins related to intermediate filaments. Unlike
intracellular intermediate filaments, keratins are bundles of rigid, insoluble extracellular
proteins that combine to align to form stable, unchanging secondary structures.
Finally, lamins are intermediate filaments that make up structural elements of the
nuclear lamina, a kind of nucleoskeleton.

CMB3e

491

As we saw earlier, intermediate filament subunits have a common structure consisting
of a pair of monomers, each with globular domains at their C- and N-terminal ends,
separated by coiled rod regions. Monomers are non-polar; i.e., unlike microtubules
and actin filaments, they do not have ‘plus’ and ‘minus’ ends. The basic unit of
intermediate filament structure is a dimer of monomers. Dimers further aggregate to
form tetramers and larger filament bundles. Like microtubules and actin filaments,
intermediate filament bundles can disassemble and reassemble as needed when cells
change shape. Unlike microtubules and actin, intermediate filaments can stretch, a
property conferred by the coiled rod regions of the filaments. This should be
reminiscent of titin molecules! The structural features and elasticity of intermediate
filaments is illustrated in the cartoon below.

Illustration by G.
Bergtrom

In the bundled intermediate filaments that permeate the cytoplasm of cells, the ability
to stretch contributes to the viscosity of cytoplasm, and is even called viscoelasticity.
This elastic property is thought to allow actins and microtubules a degree of freedom
of movement of cells, and within the cytoplasm of cells.

Introduction

Mitosis is the condensation of chromosomes from chromatin and their separation into
dividing cells. Cytokinesis is the process that divides a cell into two new cells after
duplicated chromosomes are safely on opposite sides of the cell. Mitosis and Cytokinesis
together are a relatively short time in the cell cycle. While cell cycle times vary, imagine
a cell that divides every 20 hours. Mitosis and cytokinesis would last about 1-1.5 hours in
the life of this cell. Mitosis is divided into 4-5 phases (depending on whose text you are
reading!), the last of which overlaps cytokinesis. Mitosis takes about an hour and
cytokinesis about 30 minutes in this example.
The rest of a 20-hour cell cycle is spent in interphase, so-called because 19th century
microscopists saw nothing happening in cells when they were not in mitosis or actually
dividing. However, by the 1970s, experiments had revealed that interphase itself could
be divided into discrete phases of cellular activity, called G1, S and G2, occurring in that
order. It turns out that kinases regulate progress through the cell cycle, catalyzing timely
protein phosphorylations. The early experiments led to the discovery of mitosispromoting factor (MPF), one of these kinases.
Kinase-regulated events are checkpoints that cells must pass through in order to enter
the next step in the cell cycle. As you might guess, the failure of a checkpoint can have
serious consequences. Carcinogenesis, the runaway proliferation of cancer cells, is one
such consequence that we will consider in this chapter. We will also look at the fate of
differentiating cells and at details of cellular end-of-life events, including apoptosis, or
programed cell death).

Bacterial Cell Division and the Eukaryotic Cell Cycle

The life of actively growing bacteria is not separated into a time for duplicating genes (i.e.,
DNA synthesis) and one for binary fission (dividing and partitioning the duplicated DNA
into new cells). Instead, the single circular chromosmome of a typical bacterium is
replicating even before fission is complete, so that the new daughter cells already
contained partially duplicated chromosomes. Cell growth, replication and fission are
illustrated below.

CMB3e

495

The roughly 30-60 minute life cycle of an actively growing bacterium is not divided into
discrete phases. On the other hand, typical eukaryotic cells have a roughly 16-24 hour
cell cycle (depending on cell type) that is divided into four separate phases. In the late
1800s, light microscopy revealed that some cells lost their nuclei while forming
chromosomes (from chroma, colored; soma, bodies). In mitosis, paired, attached
chromosomes (chromatids) were seen to separate and to be drawn along spindle fibers
to opposite poles of dividing cells. Thus homologous chromosomes were equally
partioned to the daughter cells at the end of cell division. Because of the same
chromosomal behavior was observed in mitosis in diverse organisms, chromosomes
were soon recognized as the stuff of inheritance, the carrier of genes!
The short period of intense mitotic activity was in stark contrast to the much longer ‘quiet’
time in the life of the cell, called interphase. The events of mitosis itself were described
as occurring in 4 phases occupyiing a short time as shown below.

Illustration by G. Bergtrom

Depending on whom you ask, cytokinesis (the cell movements of actually dividing a cell
in two) is not part of mitosis. In that sense, we can think of three stages in the life of a
cell: interphase, mitosis and cytokinesis. Of course, it turned out that interphase is not
cellular ‘quiet time’ at all!
A. Defining the Phases of the Cell Cycle
Correlation of the inheritance of specific traits with that of chromosomes was
demonstrated early in the early 20th century, most elegantly in genetic studies of the
fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster. At that time, chromosomes were assumed to
contain the genetic material and that both were duplicated during mitosis. The first
CMB3e

496

clue that this was not so came only after the discovery that DNA was in fact the
chemical stuff of genes. The experiment distinguishing the time of chromosome
formation from the time of DNA duplication is summarized below.
1. Cultured cells were incubated with 3H-thymine, the radioactive base that cells will
incorporate into thymidine triphosphate (dTTP), and then into DNA.
2. After a short period of culture, unincorporated 3H-thymine was washed away, and
the cells were fixed and spread on a glass slides.
3. Slides were dipped in a light-sensitive emulsion containing the same light sensitive
chemicals as found in the emulsion-side of film.
4. After some time to allow the radioactivity on the slide to ‘expose’ the emulsion, the
slides were developed (in much the same way as developing film).
5. The resulting autoradiographs in the microscope revealed images in the form of
dark spots created by exposure to hot (i.e., radioactive DNA.
If DNA replicates in chromosomes undergoing mitosis, then when the developed film
is placed back over the slide, any dark spots should lie over the cells in mitosis, and
not over cells that are not actively dividing. The experimental is illustrated below.

Illustration by G. Bergtrom

CMB3e

497

Observation of the autoradiographs show that none of the cells in mitosis is radioactively
labeled. But some of the cells in interphase were! Therefore, DNA synthesis must take
place sometime in interphase, before mitosis and cytokinesis (illustrated below).

Illustration by G. Bergtrom

340 Experiments that Reveal Replication in Interphase of the Cell Cycle
Next a series of pulse-chase experiments were done to determine when in the cell cycle
DNA synthesis actually takes place. Cultured cells given a short pulse (exposure) to 3Hthymine and then allowed to grow in non-radioactive medium for different times (the
chase). At the end of each chase time, cells were spread on a glass slide and again
prepared for autoradiography. Analysis of the autoradiographs identified distinct periods
of activity within interphase: Gap1 (G1), a time of DNA synthesis (S) and Gap 2 (G2).

CMB3e

498

Here are the details of these very creative experiments, performed before it became
possible to synchronize cells in culture so that they would all be growing and dividing at
the same time.
1. Cells were exposed to 3H-thymine for just 5 minutes (the pulse) and then
centrifuged. The radioactive supernatant was then discarded
2. The cells were rinsed and centrifuged again to remove as much labeled precursor
as possible.
3. The cells were re-suspended in fresh medium containing unlabeled (i.e., nonradioactive) thymine and further incubated for different times (the chase periods).
4. After dipping the slides in light-sensitive emulsion, exposing and developing the
film, the autoradiographs were examined, with the following results:
a) After a 3-hour (or less) chase period, the slides looked just like they would
immediately after the pulse. That is, none of the 7% of the cells that were in
mitosis is radioactively labeled, but many interphase cells showed labeled
nuclei, as shown below.

Illustration by
G. Bergtrom

b) After 4 hours of chase, a few of the 7% of the cells that were in mitosis were
labeled, along with others in interphase (below).

Illustration by
G. Bergtrom

c) After a 5 hour chase, most cells in mitosis (still about 7% of cells on the slide)
were labeled; many fewer cells in interphase were labeled (below).

Illustration by
G. Bergtrom

d) After a 20 hour chase, none of the 7% of cells that were in mitosis is labeled.
Instead, all of the labeled cells are in interphase (below).

The plot defines the duration of events, or phases of the cell cycle as follows:



CMB3e

The first phase (interval #1 on the graph) must be the time between the end of
DNA synthesis and the start of mitosis, defined as Gap 2 (G2).
Cell doubling times are easily measured. Assume that the cells in this
experiment doubled every 20 hours. This would be consistent with the time
interval of 20 hours between successive peaks in the number of radiolabeled
mitotic cells after the pulse (interval #2).
Interval #3 is easy enough to define. It is the time when DNA is synthesized,
from start to finish; this is the synthesis, or S phase.
One period of the cell cycle remains to be defined, but it is not on the graph!
That would be the time between the end cell division (i.e., mitosis and
cytokinesis) and the beginning of DNA synthesis (replication). That interval can
be calculated from the graph as the time of the cell cycle (~20 hours) minus the
sum of the other defined periods of the cycle. This phase is defined as the Gap
1 (G1) phase of the cycle.

500

So at last, here is our cell cycle with a summary of events occurring in each phase.

Illustration by G. Bergtrom

During all of interphase (G1, S and G2) , the cell grows in size, preparing for the next
cell division. Growth in G1 includes the synthesis of enzymes and other proteins that
will be needed for replication.
DNA is replicated during the S phase, along with the synthesis of new histone and
other proteins that will be needed to assemble new chromatin. G2 is the shortest time
of interphase and is largely devoted to preparing the cell for the next round of mitosis
and cytokinesis. Among the proteins whose synthesis increases in this time are the
tubulins and proteins responsible for condensing chromatin into the paired
chromatids representing the duplicated chromosomes. Cohesin is a more recently
discovered protein made in the run-up to mitosis. It holds centromeres of chromatids
together until they are ready to separate.
341 Events in the Phases of the Cell Cycle

In a final note, typical dividing cells have generation times ranging from 16 to 24
hours. Atypical cells, like newly fertilized eggs, might divide every hour or so! In these
cells, events that normally take many hours must be completed in just fractions of an
hour.
B. When Cells Stop Dividing…
Terminally differentiated cells are those that spend the rest of their lives performing a
specific function. These cells no longer cycle. Instead, shortly after entering G 1 they
are diverted into a phase called Go, as shown below.

Illustration by G. Bergtrom

Referred to as terminally differentiated, these cells normally never divide again.
With a few exceptions (e.g., many neurons), most terminally differentiated cells have a
finite lifespan, and must be replaced by stem cells. Examples include red blood cells.
With a half-life of about 60 days, they are regularly replaced by reticulocytes produced
in bone marrow.

CMB3e

502

III. Regulation of the Cell Cycle
Progress through the cell cycle is regulated. The cycle can be controlled or put on ‘pause’
at any one of several phase transitions. Such checkpoints monitor whether the cell is on
track to complete a successful cell division event. Superimposed on these controls are
signals that promote cell differentiation. Embryonic cells differentiate as the embryo
develops. Even after terminal differentiation of cells that form all adult tissues and
organs, adult stem cells will divide and differentiate to replace worn out cells. Once
differentiated, cells are typically signaled in G1 to enter Go and stop cycling. In some
circumstances cells in Go are recruited to resume cycling. However, if this occurs to by
mistake, the cells may be transformed to cancer cells. Here we consider how the normal
transition between phases of the cell cycle is controlled.
A. Discovery and Characterization of Maturation Promoting Factor (MPF)
Growing, dividing cells monitor their progress through the phases. Cells produce
internal chemical signals that tell them when it’s time to begin replication or mitosis, or
even when to enter into Go when they reach their terminally differentiated state. The
experiment that first demonstrated a chemical regulator of the cell cycle involved
fusing very large frog’s eggs! The experiment is described below.

Illustration by G. Bergtrom

CMB3e

503

The hypothesis tested here was that frog oocyte cytoplasm from germinal vesicle
stage oocytes (i.e., in mid-meiosis) contains a chemical that caused the cell to lose its
nuclear membrane, condense its chromatin into chromosomes and enter meiosis.
Cytoplasm was withdrawn from one of these mid-meiotic oocytes with a fine
hypodermic needle, and then injected into a pre-meiotic oocyte. The mid-meiotic
oocyte cytoplasm induced premature meiosis in the immature oocyte. A maturation
promoting factor (MPF) could be isolated from the mid-meiotic cells and injected into
pre-meiotic cells; it caused them to enter meiosis. MPF turns out to be a protein
kinase made up of two polypeptide subunits as shown below.

Illustration by G. Bergtrom

MPF was then also shown to stimulate somatic cells in G2 to enter premature mitosis.
So conveniently, MPF can also be Mitosis Promoting Factor! Hereafter we will
discuss the effects of MPF as being equivalent in mitosis and meiosis. When active,
MPF targets many cellular proteins.
342 Discovery of MPF Kinase and Its Role in Meiosis and Mitosis

CMB3e

504

Assays of MPF activity as well as the actual levels of the two subunits over time during
the cell cycle are graphed below.

Illustration by G. Bergtrom

One subunit of MPF is cyclin, a regulatory polypeptide. The other subunit, cyclindependent kinase (cdk), contains the kinase enzyme active site. Both subunits must
be bound to make an active kinase. Cyclin was so-named because its levels rise
gradually after cytokinesis, peak at the next mitosis, and then fall. Levels of the cdk
subunit do not change significantly during the life of the cell. Because the kinase
activity of MPF requires cyclin, it tracks the rise in cyclin near the end of the G2, and its
fall after mitosis. Cyclin begins to accumulate in G1, rising gradually and binding to
more and more cdk subunits. MPF reaches a threshold concentration in G2 that
triggers entry into mitosis. For their discovery of these central molecules Leland H.
Hartwell, R. Timothy Hunt, and Paul M. Nurse won the 2001 Nobel Prize in Physiology
or Medicine.

CMB3e

505

B. Other Cyclins, CDKs and Cell Cycle Checkpoints
Other chemical signals accumulate at different points in the cell cycle. For example,
when cells in S are fused with cells in G1, the G1 cells begin synthesizing DNA
(visualized as 3H-thymine incorporation). An experiment showing control of progress
to different phases of the cell cycle is illustrated below.

Illustration by G. Bergtrom

An S phase factor could be isolated from the S phase cells. This factor also turns out
to be a two-subunit protein kinase, albeit a different one from MPF. Just as MPF
signals cells in G2 to begin mitosis, the S phase kinase signals cells in G1 to enter the
S phase of the cell cycle. MPF and the S phase kinase govern activities at two of
several cell cycle checkpoints. In each case, the activity of the kinases is governed
by prior progress through the cell cycle. In other words, if the cell is not ready to begin
mitosis, active MPF production is delayed until it is. Likewise, the S phase kinase will
not be activated until the cell is ready to begin DNA synthesis.
343 Cell Cycle Control at Check Points and the Go "Phase"

CMB3e

506

The sequence of signals that control progress through the cell cycle is probably more
intricate and extensive than we currently know, but the best-described checkpoints are
in G1, G2 and M (below).

Illustration by G. Bergtrom

We generally envision checkpoints as monitoring and blocking progress until essential
events of a current phase of the cell cycle phase are completed. These kinases are
part of molecular sensing mechanisms that act by phosphorylating cytoplasmic and/or
nuclear proteins required by upcoming phases of the cycle. Let’s take a closer look at
some events that are monitored at these checkpoints in more detail.
1. The G1 Checkpoint
The G1 checkpoint controls the transition from the G1 to the S phase of the cell
cycle. If actively dividing cells (e.g., stem cells) in G1 fail to complete their
preparation for replication, the S-phase kinase won’t be produced and the cells
won’t proceed the S phase until the preparatory biochemistry catches up with the
rest of the cycle. To enter S, a cell must be ready to make proteins of replication,
like DNA polymerases, helicases, primases…, among others. Only when these
molecules have accumulated to (or become active at) appropriate levels, is it “safe”
to enter S and begin replicating DNA. This description of G1 checkpoint activity is
consistent with the idea that all checkpoints delay cycling until a prior phase is
complete.
What about cells that are fully differentiated? Such terminally differentiated cells
stop producing the active G1 checkpoint kinase and stop dividing. These cells are
arrested in Go (see below). As an interesting side-note, recall that somatic
CMB3e

507

cells are diploid and germ cells (sperm, egg) are haploid. So, are cells in G2 that
have already doubled their DNA ‘tetraploid’, however briefly? Whether or not we
can call G2 cells tetraploid (officially, probably not), it is clear that G1 cells and Go
cells are diploid!
2. The G2 Checkpoint
Passage through the G2 checkpoint is only possible if DNA made in the prior S
phase is not damaged. Or if it was, that the damage has been (or can be) repaired
(review the proofreading functions of DNA polymerase and the various DNA repair
pathways). Cells that do successfully complete replication and pass the G2
checkpoint must prepare to make the proteins necessary for the upcoming mitotic
phase. These include nuclear proteins necessary to condense chromatin into
chromosomes, tubulins for making microtubules, etc. Only when levels of these
and other required proteins reach a threshold can the cell begin mitosis. Consider
the following two tasks required of the G2 checkpoint (in fact, any checkpoint):
 sensing whether prior phase activities have been successfully completed.
 delaying transition to the next phase if those activities are unfinished.
But what if sensing is imperfect and a checkpoint is leaky? A recent study
suggests that either the G2 checkpoint is leaky, or at least, that incomplete
activities in the S phase are tolerated, and that some DNA repair is not resolved
until mitosis is underway in M! Check it out at DNA repair and replication during
mitosis.
3. M Checkpoint
The M checkpoint is monitored by the original MPF phosphorylation of proteins
that: (a) bind to chromatin causing it to condense and form chromatids, (b) lead to
the breakdown of the nuclear envelope, and (c) enable spindle fiber formation,. In
addition, tension in the spindle apparatus at metaphase tugs at the kinetochores
holding the duplicated chromatids together. When this tension reaches a
threshold, MPF peaks and an activated separase enzyme causes the chromatids
to separate at their centromeres. Beginning in anaphase, tension in the spindle
apparatus draws the new chromosomes to opposite poles of the cell. Near the end
of mitosis and cytokinesis, proteins phosphorylated by MPF initiate the breakdown
of cyclin in the cell. Passing the M checkpoint means that the cell will complete
mitosis and cytokinesis, and that each daughter cell will enter a new G1 phase.
Dividing yeast cells only seem to have the three checkpoints discussed here. More
complex eukaryotes use more cyclins and cdks to control the cell cycle at additional
checkpoints. Different cyclins show cyclic patterns of synthesis, while cdks remain at

CMB3e

508

constant levels throughout the cell cycle (as in MPF). Different gene families encode
evolutionarily conserved cdks or cyclins. But each cyclin/cdk pair has been coopted in
evolution to monitor different cell cycle events and to catalyze phosphorylation of
phase-specific proteins. To learn more, see Elledge SJ (1996) Cell Cycle
Checkpoints: Preventing an Identity Crisis. Science 274:1664-1672.
344 Cyclin/cdk Checkpoints for Cell Cycle Phases
C. The Go State
This is not really a phase of the cell cycle, since cells in Go have reached a terminally
differentiated state and have stopped dividing. In development, terminally
differentiated cells in tissues and organs no longer divide. Nevertheless, most cells
have finite half-lives (recall our red blood cells that must be replaced every 60 days or
so). Because cells in many tissues are in Go and can’t divide, they must be replaced
by stem cells, which can divide and differentiate. Some cells live so long in Go that
they are nearly never replaced (muscle cells, neurons). Other cells live short lives in
Go (e.g., stem cells, some embryonic cells). For example, a lymphocyte is a
differentiated immune system white blood cell type. However, exposure of
lymphocytes to foreign chemicals or pathogens activates mitogens that cause them
to re-enter the cell cycle from Go. The newly divided cells then make the antibodies
that neutralize the chemicals and fight off the pathogens. The retinoblastoma (Rb)
protein is an example of a mitogen. Like other mitogens, the Rb protein is a
transcription factor that turns on genes that lead to cell proliferation.
What if cells continue cycling when they aren’t supposed to? Or, what if they are
inappropriately signaled to exit Go? Such cells are in trouble! Having escaped
normal controls on cell division, they can become a focal point of cancer cell growth.
You can guess from its name that the retinoblastoma gene was discovered as a
mutation that causes retinal cancer. For more about the normal function of the Rb
protein and its interaction with a G1 cdk, check out the link below.

IV. When Cells Die
As noted, few cell types live forever; most live for a finite time. Most are destined to turn
over (another euphemism for dying), mediated by programmed cell death, or
apoptosis. This occurs in normal development when cells are only temporarily required
for a maturation process (e.g., embryonic development, metamorphosis). When no

CMB3e

509

longer necessary or when genetically or otherwise damaged, such cells are detected and
signaled to undergo apoptosis. Programmed cell death starts with an external signal
programmed to appear at a specific time in development. The signal molecule acts on
target cells to induce transcription of Bcl2 genes. Bcl2 proteins Bak and Bax are outer
mitochondrial membrane channel components that allow the release of cytochrome C into
the cytoplasm. This sets off molecular events leading to apoptosis. The role of
cytochrome C in apoptosis is illustrated below.

Illustration by G. Bergtrom

Mitochondrial exit of cytochrome C is possible because it is a peripheral membrane
protein, only loosely bound to the cristal membrane. It exists in equilibrium between
membrane-bound and unbound states. As some cytochrome C molecules exit the
intermembrane space, others detach from the cristal membrane and follow. In the
cytosol, cytochrome C binds to adaptor proteins that then aggregate. The
cytochrome c-adaptor complex has a high affinity for a biologically inactive procaspase.
Binding of procaspase to the cytochrome C-adaptor complex causes an allosteric change
in the procaspase, releasing an active caspase. Caspases are proteolytic enzymes that
start the auto-digestion of the cell.

CMB3e

510

One example of apoptosis is amphibian metamorphosis. Thyroid hormone signals
tadpole metamorphosis. The hormone causes tadpoles to digest their own tail cells,
allowing reabsorption and recycling of the digestion products. These in turn serve as
nutrients to grow adult frog structures. For their work in identifying apoptosis genes,
Sydney Brenner, H. Robert Horvitz and John E. Sulston shared the 2002 Nobel Prize in
Physiology or Medicine.

V. Disruption of the Cell Cycle Checkpoints Can Cause Cancer
If a checkpoint fails or if a cell suffers physical damage to chromosomes during cell
division, or if it suffers a debilitating somatic mutation in a prior S phase, it may selfdestruct in response to a consequent biochemical anomaly. This is another example of
apoptosis. On the other hand, when cells die from external injury, they undergo
necrosis, an accidental rather than a programmed death. In the cells shown below,
apoptosis or necrosis were chemically induced, followed and identified as apoptotic or
necrotic using fluorescent markers (propidium iodide, green; acridine orange, orange.

As we’ve noted, cycling cells continue to divide until they attain Go in the terminally
differentiated state. Most terminally differentiated cells are cleared by apoptosis when
they reach the end of their effective lives, to be replaced by stem cells. We also noted
that accidental signaling can bring cells out of Go, leading to renewed cell proliferation.
While these cells are obviously abnormal, they are not detected by apoptotic defense
mechanisms. Thus, they undergo uncontrolled cell divisions, becoming cancer cells.
Likewise, physically damaged or mutated cells may sometimes escape apoptotic
clearance. When they do, they may also become cancer cells. Apoptotic clearance and
uncontrolled cancer cell proliferation are compared below.

A. P53 Protein Mediates Normal Cell Cycle Control
Cancerous growth could result if a normal dividing cell should suffer a somatic
mutation that disrupts normal cell cycle control. Think an over-expression of cdk for
example. Alternatively, imagine cyclin levels in daughter cells that never drop; such
cells would never stop cycling.
Other possibilities include a cell in Go that is stimulated to begin cycling again by an
inappropriate encounter with a hormone or other signal. If undetected, these
anomalies can transform cells to cancer cells. The p53 protein (illustrated below) is a
DNA-binding, gene-regulatory protein that detects some of these anomalies and
enables dividing cells to repair the damage before proceeding through cell cycle check
points…, or failing that, will lead to apoptosis of the cell.

CMB3e

513

Not surprisingly, mutations in the gene for the P53 protein (called TP53 in humans)
are associated with many human cancers (pancreatic, lung, renal cell, breast, etc.).
As many as half of human cancers are associated with mutated p53 genes. Thus,
p53 is one of a class of tumor suppressor proteins. Studies of humans with a
condition known as LFS (Li-Fraumeni syndrome) have at least one mutated p53
allele. The mutation leads to a ~100% lifetime risk of cancer, beginning in childhood.
In cultured cells, mutagenized p53 genes exhibit key characteristics of cancer cells,
including unregulated cell proliferation and suppression of apoptosis.
1. How p53 works
The p53 protein is normally bound to an active Mdm2 protein. To enable cell cycle
checkpoints, p53-Mdm2 must separate and be kept separate to allow p53 time to
act. In dividing cells, physical stress or chemical stress such as DNA damage
during cell growth can activate an ATM kinase. ATM kinase in turn,
phosphorylates Mdm2, causing it to dissociate from p53. The same kinase also
phosphorylates another kinase, Chk2, as well as the now ‘free’ p53. ATM kinaseinitiated events are further detailed below.

Illustration by G. Bergtrom

CMB3e

514

Each of the proteins and enzymes phosphorylated by the ATM kinase has a role in
cell cycle checkpoint function and cell cycle arrest while errors are corrected:





Now separated from Mdm2, Phospho-p53 actively up-regulates several genes,
including the p21 gene.
The P21 protein binds to cdks; cyclins can’t bind P21-cdks.
Active Phospho-Chk2 catalyzes cyclin phosphorylation; phospho-cyclins
can’t bind to p21-cdks.
The inability of cyclins to bind cdks specifically blocks the cell cycle between
the G1 and S, and the G2-to-M phases.

These kinase-mediated events at cell cycle checkpoints are illustrated below.

Illustration by
G. Bergtrom

The cell cycle is remains arrested while the cell attempts to finish essential
biochemical activities necessary to correct stress-induced or other physical or
chemical aberrations before moving on to the next phase of the cycle. If DNA
repairs or other corrections are successful, the cell can progress to the next phase.

CMB3e

515

If not, proteasomes target the Chk2-cyclin complex for degradation. Likewise,
any P53 remaining bound to unphosphorylated Mdm2 is also targeted for
proteasome destruction. The result is that any cell unable to correct effects of
stress or chemical damage, or to repair DNA damage, is target for apoptosis.
The levels and activity of p53 as well as the other proteins discussed above,
control both the amount of p53 protein available to respond to cell cycling
anomalies, and the responses themselves. Phosphorylation (activation) of p53
not only leads to a rapid arrest of the cell cycle, but also to the activation of genes
encoding proteins required for DNA repair and of proteins required for apoptosis (in
the event that repair efforts fail). The interactions of p53 with different proteins
leading to alternate cell fates are summarized below.

Illustration by G. Bergtrom

To sum up, p53 suppresses malignant tumor growth either by
 allowing DNA or other cellular repair before resumption of normal cell cycling,
preventing unregulated cell divisions; after repair, p53 and other proteins are
inactivated and/or destroyed and the cell cycle can resume.
 The inability to repair/correct cell cycling problems sets in motion events
leading to apoptosis, thereby also blocking tumorigenesis by killing off
damaged cells.

CMB3e

516

It should be clear now why a mutant p53 that reduces or eliminates p21 protein
production or blocks essential DNA repair protein production, will allow damaged
cells to enter S and keep them replicating and dividing, transforming such them
into cancer cells. In an interesting twist, it seems that compared to humans, few
whales or elephants die from cancer, despite having thousands of times more cells
than humans. The reason seems to be that, at least for elephants, they have as
many as 20 copies (40 alleles) of their p53 genes! Thus a mutation in one allele of
one of them may have little effect, while the tumor-repressing effects of the
remaining p53 genes prevails. Read about this recent research at Whales and
Elephants Don't Get Cancer!
2. The Centrality of p53 Action in Cell Cycle Regulation
Because of its multiple roles in regulating and promoting DNA repair, and in
controlling cell cycle checkpoints, p53 has been called “the Guardian of the
Genome”! Here is further evidence of this central role.
a) ‘Oncogenic Viruses’
Cancer causing viruses include Human Papilloma Virus (HPV), Epstein Barr
Virus (EBV), human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), Hepatitis B and C viruses
(HBV, HCV), Human herpes virus 8 (HHV-8) and simian virus 40 (SV40).
There is a demonstrated link between SV40, p53 and cancer. SV40 is a viral
contaminant of polio vaccines that were used in the 1960s. The virus is
tumorigenic in mammals, though an association of SV40 and cancer in humans
is unproven. In infected cells, SV40 DNA enters the nucleus where it can
integrate into the host cell genome. SV40 infections are usually latent, (i.e.,
they cause no harm). However, activation can lead to cellular transformation
and the growth of malignant sarcomas in muscles as well as tumors in other
organs. The RNA polymerase II in infected cells transcribes the SV40 genes,
producing proteins that replicate and encapsulate the viral DNA in a membrane
to make new viral particles. However, the relatively small SV40 genome does
not encode all of the enzymes and factors need for viral DNA replication. The
infected cells themselves provide these factors, producing them only during the
S phase. At that time, the SV40 large T antigen (made soon after infection)
enters the host cell nucleus where it regulates transcription of genes essential
to viral replication and viral particle formation. The large T antigen also binds to
p53, interfering with transcription of proteins whose genes are regulated by

CMB3e

517

p53. Unable to exercise checkpoint functions, the host cell divides
uncontrollably, forming cancerous tumors. Deregulation of the cell cycle by
large T antigen ensures progress to the S phase and unregulated co-replication
of viral and host cell DNA.
b) p53 and Signal transduction
Stress can activate signal transduction pathways. For example, mutations
affecting the MAPK (MAP kinase) signaling pathway can lead to tumorigenesis.
This can be explained by the observation that when activated, the MAPK
pathway leads to amplified production of a kinase that phosphorylates p53.
Active phospho-p53 in turn augments activation of the MAPK signal
transduction pathway. You may recall that MAPK signal transduction typically
ends with a mitogenic response.
Another example of p53 interaction is with FAK (focal adhesion kinase)
proteins. FAK activity is increased by integrin-mediated signal transduction.
Recall that membrane integrins bind fibronectin, contributing to formation of the
extracellular matrix, or ECM. Elevated FAK activity participates in the
regulation of cell-cell and cell-ECM adhesion at focal adhesion points.
Another role for FAK is to bind directly to inactive p53 and increase p53-Mdm2
binding. As we have just seen, persistent p53-Mdm2 is targeted for
ubiquitination… and ultimate destruction! In fact, abnormally high levels of FAK
are associated with many different tumor cell lines (colon, breast, thyroid,
ovarian, melanoma, sarcoma…). These result when p53 is unable properly to
activate cell cycle checkpoints.
While the interactions implied here are complex and under active study, these
p53 activities certainly confirm its central role as both guardian of the genome
and as guardian of cell division.
B. Growth and Behavior of Cancer Cells
Different cancer cell types have different growth and other behavioral properties. You
may have heard of slow growing and fast growing cancers. Colon cancers are
typically slow growing. Periodic colonoscopies that detect and remove colorectal
tumors in middle-age or older people can prevent the disease (although the risks of
disease and the procedure itself must be balanced). Pancreatic cancers are fast
growing and usually go undetected until they reach an advanced stage. The twin
goals of medical research are to detect the different cancers early enough for
successful intervention, and of course, to find effective treatments.

CMB3e

518

A single mutated cell in a tissue can become the growth point of a tumor, essentially a
mass of cells cloned from the original mutated one. Benign tumors or growths (for
example breast and uterine fibroids in women, or common moles in any of us)
stop growing and are not life threatening. They are often surgically removed for the
comfort of the patient (or because cells in some otherwise benign tumors may have a
potential to become cancerous).
Malignant tumors (also called malignant neoplasms) are cancerous and can grow
beyond the boundaries of the tumor itself. When tumor cells are shed they may enter
the bloodstream and travel to other parts of the body, the phenomenon called
metastasis. Cancer cells that metastasize can become the focal point of new tumor
formation in many different tissues. Because cancer cells continue to cycle and
replicate their DNA, they can undergo yet more somatic mutations. These further
changes can facilitate metastasis and cancer cell growth in different locations in the
body.
C. Cancer Treatment Strategies
There are many different kinds of cancers originating in different tissues of the body.
They all share the property of uncontrolled cell division, albeit for different molecular
and not always well-understood reasons. The two major cancer treatment strategies
developed in the 20th century all aim at disrupting replication in some way.
 Radiation therapy relies on the fact that most cells in our bodies do not divide,
aiming mutagenic radiation at tumors in the hope that replicating DNA will be
mutated at so many sites (i.e., genes) that the tumor cells can no longer survive or
replicate properly.
 Chemotherapy is used to attack tumors that do not respond well to radiation or
that are not easily be reached by radiation technologies, and to fight cancers that
do not even form focused tumors (such as lymphomas and leukemias involving
lymph and blood cells). These chemotherapies also aim to derange replication or
mitotic activities. For example, recall cordycepin (dideoxyadenosine triphosphate,
or ddATP). When present during replication, ddATP is incorporated into a growing
DNA chain, after which no additional nucleotides can be added to the DNA strand.
That makes ddATP a potent chemotherapeutic disruptor of replication. Taxol is
another chemo drug that acts in this case, not by inhibiting S phase replication, but
by blocking spindle fiber microtubules from depolymerizing, thus blocking mitotic
anaphase and telophase in the latter part of the M and C phases of the cycle.
Colchicine (a plant alkaloid) attacks cancer (and other dividing) cells by blocking
microtubule formation and therefore preventing spindle fiber formation in mitotic
prophase.

CMB3e

519

These therapies are not effective against all cancers, and of course, they don’t target
specific kinds of cancer cells. Their success relies simply on the fact that cancer cells
proliferate rapidly and constantly while other cell types do not. Many if not all of the
side effects of radiation and chemotherapies result from the damage done to normal
dividing cells (e.g., hair follicle cells accounting for hair loss among many cancer
patients, depletion of blood cells that fail to be replaced by stem cells in bone marrow).
Much research now is focused on mobilizing the body’s own immune system to create
more specific, targeted cancer treatments. In a fascinating bit of history, more than
100 years ago, Dr. William B. Coley injected a terminal cancer patient with
streptococcal bacteria, who then emerged tumor-free upon his recovery from the
infection (for details, check out The Earliest Cancer Immunotherapy Trials). The
phenomenon of “Dr. Coley’s Toxins” was initially thought to be an anti-tumor effect of
the bacteria. But by 1948 it was widely attributed to the immune response activated by
the infection. In the 1990s, scientists revisited the immune response to cancer, and
by the turn of the 21st century, studies of cancer immunotherapy picked up steam
(and more substantial research funding!).
Recent animal immunotherapy experiments and human clinical trials are promising. A
few immunotherapies have already been approved by the U.S. FDA (Food and Drug
Administration). Cancer immunotherapy strategies capitalize on the fact that your
body sometimes recognizes cancer cell markers (e.g., cell surface molecules) as
foreign, thus mounting an immune defense against those cells. But that response is
sometimes not powerful enough to clear new, rapidly dividing cancer cells. Cancer
apparently results when the immune response is weak. There are different,
sometimes overlapping approaches to cancer immunotherapy. All are based on the
fact that cancer cells that have mutated in some way and are producing aberrant
proteins that the immune system can see as foreign enough to elicit an immune
response, however slight. Some immunotherapies seek to boost that immune
response. Others seek isolate or generate unique cancer cell antigens that will
immunize a patient when injected with these cancer antigens. Some
immunotherapies are summarized in the table on the next page. As you can see from
the table, immuno-targeting cancer cells has already proven to be highly effective. In
some cases the therapy is an example of personalized medicine, in which treatments
are uniquely tailored to you as a patient. Issues with immunotherapies are that
 they are time and labor intensive…, and costly to produce.
 while they may ‘cure’ you, they likely won’t not work on someone else.
 like radiation and chemotherapy, immunotherapies come with their own unpleasant
and sometimes severe side effects.
A more detailed discussion of cancer immunotherapies is on the cancer.gov website
at Cancer Treatment Immunotherapy.

A short history; Origins under reductive vs. non-reductive conditions; Prebiotic

I.

Introduction

It is nearly universally accepted that there was a time, however brief or long, when the
earth was a lifeless planet. Given that the cell is the basic unit of life, and that to be alive
is to possess all of the properties of life, any cell biology textbook would be remiss
without addressing the questions of when and how the first cells appeared on our planet.
Abiogenesis is the origin of life from non-living matter. Of course describing abiogenesis
is no longer possible by observation! Through experiment and educated guesswork, it
has been possible to construct reasonable (if sometimes conflicting) scenarios to explain
the origins of life, and hence our very existence.
In this chapter, we will see that different scenarios share at least one feature, namely a
set of geologic, thermodynamic and chemical conditions that favored an accumulation of
organic molecules and proto-structures that would eventually become a cell. Those
permissive conditions would have been an ecological, climatological, and environmental
prebiotic laboratory in which many experimental cells might have formed and competed.
Hence the chapter title “Origins of Life”! Multiple origins were not only possible under
these conditions, but also probable! According to Jeremy England, of MIT, the laws of
thermodynamics dictate that "... when a group of atoms is driven by an external source of
energy (like the sun or chemical fuel) and surrounded by a heat bath (like the ocean or
atmosphere), matter inexorably acquires the key physical attribute(s) associated with life”.
(Statistical Physics of Self Replication). Here is a reminder of those key attributes, or
properties of life.

CMB3e

523

Remember, to be alive is to possess not just some, but all of these properties! If entities
with all of the properties of life (i.e., cells) did originate independently, they would have
reproduced to form separate populations of cells. In this scenario, less successful
populations go extinct while successful ones become dominant. Successful organisms
would have spread, spawning populations and generating new species. The take-home
message is that if conditions on a prebiotic earth favored the formation of the ‘first cell’,
then why not the formation of two, or dozens or even hundreds of ‘first cells’? However,
we will see that only one successful population of cells would survive to become the
source of the common ancestor of all life on earth, while other populations became
extinct.
As to the question of when life began, geological and geochemical evidence suggests the
presence of life on earth as early as 4.1 billion years ago. As for how life began, this
remains the subject of ongoing speculation. All of the scenarios described below attempt
to understand the physical, chemical and energetic conditions that might have been the
ideal laboratory for prebiotic “chemistry experiments”. What all the scenarios share are
the following requirements.

Let’s consider some tricky definitions. If one believes the origin of life was so unlikely that
it could only have happened once (still a common view), then the very first cell (defined as
the progenote, the progenitor of us all) is our common genetic ancestor.
On the other hand, what if there were many origins of life? Then there must have been
more than one ‘first cell’, generating multiple populations of cells. Each such population,
starting with its own ‘progenote’ would have evolved. In this scenario, only one cell
population would survive; its evolved cells would have been the source of our Last
Universal Common Ancestor, or LUCA. All populations of other first cells went extinct.
The LUCA remains defined as the highly evolved cell(s) with genome, biochemistry and
basic metabolic infrastructure that is shared among all things alive today.
Whatever the pathway to the first living cells on earth, molecular studies over the last
several decades support the common ancestry of all life on earth, in the form of the
LUCA. Look at the phylogenetic tree on the next page showing the domains of life that
we have seen before, with the LUCA at its root.

CMB3e

524

From:

Regardless of the number of ‘first cells’, the LUCA’s ancestors still descended from a
progenote! So, how did we get to our own progenote, or first cell? Consider these
common features of any life-origins scenario:
 reduction of inorganic molecules to form organic molecules
 a source of free energy to fuel the formation of organic molecules
 a scheme for catalytic acceleration of biochemical reactions
 separation of early biochemical ‘experiments’ by a semipermeable boundary.
CMB3e

525

Next, consider some proposed scenarios for the creation of organic molecules:
 import of organic molecules (or even life itself) from extraterrestrial sources.
 organic molecule synthesis on an earth with a reducing atmosphere.
 organic molecule synthesis on an earth with a non-reducing atmosphere.
Here we explore alternate free-energy sources and pathways to the essential chemistry
of life dictated by these different beginnings. Then we look at possible scenarios of
chemical evolution that must have occurred before life itself. Finally, we consider how
primitive (read “simpler”) biochemistries could have evolved into the present-day
metabolisms shared by all existing life forms.

Thinking about Life’s Origins: A Short Summary of a Long History
By all accounts, the earth must have been a very unpleasant place soon after its
formation! For that reason, the period from 4.8 to 4.0 billion years ago is called the
Hadean Eon, after Hades, the hell of the ancient Greeks!

CMB3e

526

Until recently, geological, geochemical and fossil evidence suggested that life arose
between 3.8 and 4.1 billion years ago. The 2017 discovery of 3.95 billion year-old
sedimentary rocks in Labrador with evidence of life, points to an even earlier origin of life,
(see From Canada Comes the Oldest Evidence of Life on Earth). In fact, questions about
life’s origins are probably “as old as the hills…” or at least as old as the ancient Greeks!
We only have records of human notions of life’s origins dating from biblical accounts and,
just a bit later, from Aristotle’s musings. While Aristotle did not suggest that life began in
hell, he and other ancient Greeks did speculate about life’s origins by spontaneous
generation, in the sense of abiogenesis (life originating from non-life). He further
speculated that the origins of life were gradual.
Later, the dominant theological accounts of creation in Europe in the middle ages muted
any notions of origins and evolution. While a few mediaeval voices ran counter to strict
biblical readings of the creation stories, it was not until the Renaissance in the 14th-17th
century that an appreciation of ancient Greek humanism was reawakened, and with it,
scientific curiosity and the ability to engage in rational questioning and research.
Many will recall that Louis Pasteur in the mid-19th century put to rest any lingering notions
of life forming from dead (e.g., rotten, or fecal) matter. He showed that life would not form
in sterilized nutrient solutions unless the broth was exposed to the air. Fewer know that
much earlier, Anton Van Leeuwenhoek, the 17th century microscopist who first described
bacteria and animalcules, mostly protozoa in pond water, had already tested the notion of
spontaneous generation. By observing open and sealed containers of meat over time, he
became convinced that ‘large’ animals like fleas and frogs do not arise de novo from
putrid meat or slime. He also declared that insects come from other insects, and not from
the flowers that they visited.
No lesser light than Charles Darwin suggested in 1859 that life might have begun in a
"warm little pond, with all sorts of ammonia and phosphoric salts, light, heat, electricity,
&c., present, that a proteine compound was chemically formed ready to undergo still more
complex changes." He even realized that these chemical constituents would not have
survived in the atmosphere and waters of his day, but must have done so in a prebiotic
world. In On the Origin of Species, he referred to life having been ‘created’. There,
Darwin was not referring to a biblical basis of creation; he clearly meant that life originated
“by some wholly unknown process" at a time before which there was no life. Finally,
Pasteur’s 1861 contribution was the irrefutable, definitive proof that ‘invisible’ microbial life
likewise did not arise by spontaneous generation. Thus for creatures already on earth,
they could only arise by biogenesis (life-from-life), the opposite of abiogenesis, a term
that now applies to only the first origins of life!

CMB3e

527

Among Darwin’s friends and contemporaries were Charles Lyell and Roderick Murchison,
both geologists who understood much about the slow geological changes that shaped the
earth. Darwin was therefore familiar with the concept of extended periods of geological
time, amounts of time he believed was necessary for the natural selection of traits leading
to species divergence.
Fast-forward to the 1920s when J.H.B.S. Haldane and A. Oparin offered an hypothesis
about the life’s origins based on notions of the chemistry and physical conditions that
might have existed on a prebiotic earth. Their proposal assumed that the earth’s
atmosphere was hot, hellish and reducing (i.e., filled with inorganic molecules able to give
up electrons and hydrogens). There are more than a few hypotheses for which chemicals
were already present on earth, or that formed when the planet formed about 4.8 billion
years ago. We’ll start our exploration with Oparin and Haldane’s reducing atmosphere.
Then we look at possibility that life began under non-reducing conditions (with passing
reference to a few other ideas).
348 Early Ideas to Explain the Origins of Life

III.

Formation of Organic Molecules in an Earthly Reducing Atmosphere
A prerequisite to the prebiotic chemical experimentation is a source of organic molecules.
Just as life requires energy (to do anything and everything!), converting inorganic
molecules into organic molecules requires an input of free energy. As we have seen,
most living things today get free energy by oxidizing nutrients or directly from the sun by
photosynthesis. Recall that in fact all the chemical energy sustaining life today ultimately
comes from the sun. But, before there were cells, how did organic molecules form from
inorganic precursors? Oparin and Haldane hypothesized a reducing atmosphere on the
prebiotic earth, rich in inorganic molecules with reducing power (like H2, NH3, CH4, and
H2S) as well as CO2 to serve as a carbon source. The predicted physical conditions on
this prebiotic earth were:
• lots of water (oceans).
• hot (no free O2).
• lots ionizing (e.g., X-, -) radiation from space, (no protective ozone layer).
• frequent ionizing (electrical) storms generated in an unstable atmosphere.
• volcanic and thermal vent activity.
A. Origins of Organic Molecules and a Primordial Soup
Oparin suggested that abundant sources of free energy fueled the reductive synthesis
of the first organic molecules to create what he called a “primeval soup”. No doubt, he
called this primeval concoction a “soup” because it would have been rich in chemical
CMB3e

528

(nutrient) free energy. The Oparin/Haldane proposal received strong support from the
experiments of Stanley Miller and Harold Urey (Urey had already won the 1934 Nobel
Prize in Chemistry for discovering deuterium). Miller and Urey tested the prediction
that, under Haldane and Oparin’s prebiotic earth conditions, inorganic molecules could
produce the organic molecules in what came known as the primordial soup. Their
famous experiment, in which they provided energy to a mixture of inorganic molecules
with reducing power, is illustrated below.

Illustration by G. Bergtrom

Miller’s earliest published data indicated the presence of several organic molecules in
their ocean flask, including a few familiar metabolic organic acids (lactate, acetate,
several amino acids…) as well as several highly reactive aldehydes and nitriles. The
latter can interact in spontaneous chemical reactions to form organic compounds.
Later analyses further revealed purines, carbohydrates and fatty acids in the flask.
Later still, 50 years after Miller’s experiments (and a few years after his death), some
un-analyzed sample collection tubes from those early experiments were discovered.

CMB3e

529

When the contents of these tubes were analyzed with newer, more sensitive detection
techniques, they were shown to contain additional organic molecules not originally
reported, including 23 amino acids (to read more, click Surprise Goodies in the Soup!).
Clearly, the thermodynamic and chemical conditions proposed by Oparin and Haldane
could support the reductive synthesis of organic molecules. At some point, Oparin
and Haldane’s evolving chemistries would have to have been internalized inside of
semipermeable aggregates (or boundaries) destined to become cells. Examples of
such structures are discussed below. A nutrient-rich primordial soup would likely
have favored the genesis of heterotrophic cells that could use environmental nutrients
for energy and growth, implying an early evolution of fermentative pathways similar to
glycolysis. But, these first cells would quickly consume the nutrients in the soup,
quickly ending the earth’s new vitality!
So, one must propose an early evolution of least small populations of cells that could
capture free energy from inorganic molecules (chemoautotrophs) or even sunlight
(photoautotrophs). As energy-rich organic nutrients in the ‘soup’ declined,
autotrophs (notably photoautotrophs that could split water using solar energy) would
be selected. Photoautotrophs would fix CO2, reducing it with H- ions from water.
Photoautotrophy (photosynthesis) would thus replenish carbohydrates and other
nutrients in the oceans and add O2 to the atmosphere.
Oxygen would have been toxic to most cells, but a few already had the ability to
survive oxygen. Presumably these spread, evolving into cells that could respire, i.e.,
use oxygen to burn environmental nutrients. Respiratory metabolism must have
followed hard on the heels of the spread of photosynthesis.
Photosynthesis began between 3.5 and 2.5 billion years ago (the Archaean Eon).
Eventually, photosynthetic and aerobic cells and organisms achieved a natural
balance to become the dominant species in our oxygen-rich world.
B. The Tidal Pool Scenario for an Origin of Polymers and Replicating Chemistries
In this scenario, prebiotic organic monomers would concentrate in tidal pools in the
heat of a primordial day, followed by polymerization by dehydration synthesis. The
formation of polymer linkages is an ‘uphill’ reaction requiring free energy. Very high
temperatures (the heat of baking) can link monomers by dehydration synthesis in the
laboratory, and may have done so in tidal pool sediments to form random polymers.
This scenario further assumes that the dispersal of these polymers from the tidal pools
with the ebb and flow of high tides.

CMB3e

530

The tidal pool scenario is illustrated below.

Illustration by G. Bergtrom

The concentration of putative organic monomers at the bottom of tidal pools may have
offered opportunities to catalyze polymerization, even in the absence of very high
heat. Many metals (nickel, platinum, silver, even hydrogen) are inorganic catalysts,
able to speed up many chemical reactions. The heavier metals were likely
to exist in the earth’s crust as well as in the sediments of primordial oceans, as they
do today. Such mineral aggregates in soils and clays have been shown to possess
catalytic properties. Furthermore, metals (e.g., magnesium, manganese…) are now
an integral part of many enzymes, consistent with an origin of biological catalysts in
simpler aggregated mineral catalysts in ocean sediments.
CMB3e

531

Before life, the micro-surfaces of mineral-enriched sediment, if undisturbed, could
have been able to catalyze the same or at least similar reactions repeatedly, leading
to related sets of polymers. Consider the possibilities for RNA monomers and
polymers, based on the assumption that life began in an RNA world. The possibilities
are illustrated below.

Illustration by G. Bergtrom

The result predicted here is the formation not only of RNA polymers (perhaps only
short ones at first), but of H-bonded double-stranded RNA molecules that might
effectively replicate at each cycle of concentration, polymerization and dispersal.
Heat and the free energy released by these same reactions could have supported
polymerization, while catalysis would have enhanced the fidelity of RNA replication.
Of course, in the tidal pool scenario, repeated high heat or other physical or chemical
attack might also degrade newly formed polymers. But what if some RNA double
strands were more resistant to destruction. Such early RNA duplexes would
CMB3e

532

accumulate at the expense of the weaker, more susceptible ones. Only the fittest
replicated molecules would be selected and persist in the environment! The
environmental accumulation of structurally related, replicable and stable polymers
reflects a prebiotic chemical homeostasis (one of those properties of life!).
349 Life Origins in a Reducing Atmosphere?
Overall, this scenario hangs together nicely, and has done so for many decades.
However, there are now challenging questions about the premise of a prebiotic
reducing environment. Newer evidence points to an earth atmosphere that was not at
all reducing, casting doubt on the idea that the first cells on the planet were
heterotrophs. Recent proposals posit alternative sources of prebiotic free energy and
organic molecules that look quite different from those assumed by Oparin, Haldane,
Urey and Miller.

IV.

Origins of Organic Molecules in a NON-Reducing Atmosphere

A prebiotic non-reducing atmosphere is based on several assumptions: (1) The early
earth would have had insufficient gravity to hold H2 and other light gasses; thus
“outgassing” would have resulted in a loss of H2 and other reducing agents from the
atmosphere. (2) Geological evidence suggests that the earth’s oceans and crust formed
early in the Hadean Eon, just a few hundred million years after formation of the planet. (3)
Studies of 4.4 billion year old (early Hadean Eon) Australian zircon crystals suggest that
their oxidation state is the same as modern day rocks, meaning that the early Hadean
atmosphere was largely N2 and CO2, a distinctly non-reducing one! A colorized image of
this Australian zircon is shown below.

http://geoscience.wisc.edu/geoscience/people/faculty/ john-valley/john-valley-incle-on-zircons/

CMB3e

533

So life might have begun in a non-reducing environment. Nevertheless, how far back can
we date the appearance of the first actual cells on earth? Solid geological evidence of
actual life dates to 3.5-3.95 billion years ago (i.e., the Archaean Eon). Softer evidence of
microbial life exists in the form of graphite and other ‘possible’ remains as old as 4.1
billion years ago, near the end of the Hadean Eon. Thus, regardless of whether life
began 3.5 or even 4.1 billion years ago, the evidence suggests that life’s beginnings had
to contend with a non-reducing environment.
Before we look more closely at other evidence of life origins under non-reducing
conditions, let’s consider the Panspermia, the possibility that life came to earth from
extraterrestrial sources and a related hypothesis that prebiotic organic molecules came
from extraterrestrial sources. Then we will examine how cells might have formed in
localized, favorable terrestrial environments.

A. Panspermia – an Extraterrestrial Origin of Earthly Life
Panspermia posits that life itself arrived on our planet on comets or meteorites. Since
these are unlikely to have sustained life in space, they must have been a kind of
interstellar ‘mailbox’ into which dormant life forms were deposited. The cells in the
mailboxes must have been cryptobiotic. Examples of cryptobiosis exist today (e.g.,
bacterial spores, brine shrimp!). Once delivered to earth’s life-friendly environment,
such organisms would emerge from dormancy, eventually populating the planet.
There is however, no evidence of dormant or cryptobiotic life on comets or meteorites,
and no hard evidence to support Panspermia. On the other hand, there is evidence at
least consistent with an extraterrestrial source of organic molecules, and plenty to
support more terrestrial origins of life. In any case, notions of Panspermia (and even
extraterrestrial sources of organic molecules) simply beg the question of the
conditions that would have led to the origin of life elsewhere!
While panspermia is not a favored scenario, it is nevertheless intriguing, in the sense
that it is in line the likelihood that organic molecules formed soon after the Big Bang.
Moreover, if ready-made organic molecules and water were available, we can expect
(and many do!) that there is life on other planets. This expectation has stimulated
serious discussion and funding of programs looking for signs of life on other planets.
For example, NASA funded Rover’s search for (and discovery of) signs of water on
Mars. It even supported the more earth-bound Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence
(the SETI program), based on the assumption that life not only exists elsewhere, but
that it evolved high level communication skills (and why not?)! For a fascinating story
about meteorites from Mars that contain water and that are worth more than gold, click

B. Extraterrestrial Origins of Organic molecules
Even if life did not come to us ready-made, could organic molecules have arrived on
earth from outer space? They are abundant, for example in interstellar clouds, and
could have become part of the earth as the planet formed around 4.8 billion years ago.
This suggests that there was no need to create them de novo. One hypothesis
suggests meteorites, comets and asteroids, known to contain organic molecules,
brought them here during fiery impacts on our planet. Comet and meteorite
bombardments would have been common 3.8 or more billion years ago. In this
scenario the question of how (not on earth!) free energy and inorganic molecular
precursors reacted to form organic molecules…, is moot!
A related hypothesis suggests that those fiery hits themselves provided the free
energy necessary to synthesize the organic molecules from inorganic ones… a
synthesis-on-arrival scenario. With this hypothesis on the one hand, we are back to
an organic oceanic primordial soup. On the other, some have suggested that organic
molecules produced in this way (not to mention any primordial life forms) would likely
have been destroyed by the same ongoing impacts by extraterrestrial bodies; witness
the relatively recent dinosaur extinction by an asteroid impact off the coast of Mexico
some 65.5 million years ago.
350 Life Origins in a Non-Reducing Atmosphere?
C. Organic Molecular Origins Closer to Home
Deep in the oceans, far from the meteoric bombardments and the rampant free energy
of an oxygen-free and ozone-less sky, deep-sea hydrothermal vents would have been
spewing reducing molecules (e.g., H2S, H2, NH4, CH4), much as they do today. Some
vents are also high in metals such as lead, iron, nickel, zinc copper, etc. When
combined with their clay or crustal substrata, these minerals could have provided
catalytic surfaces to enhance organic molecule synthesis. Could such localized
conditions have been the focus of prebiotic chemical experimentation leading to the
origins of life? Let’s look at two kinds of deep-sea hydrothermal vents recognized
today: volcanic and alkaline.
1. Origins in a High-Heat Hydrothermal Vent (Black Smoker)
The free energy available from a volcanic hydrothermal vent would come from the
high heat (temperatures ranging to 350oC) and the minerals and chemicals
expelled from the earth’s mantle.

CMB3e

535

A volcanic hydrothermal vent is illustrated below.

http://www.photolib.noaa.gov/htmls/nur04506.htm

Conditions assumed for prebiotic volcanic hydrothermal vents could have
supported catalytic syntheses of organic molecules from inorganic precursors (see
Volcanic Vents and organic molecule formation). The catalysts would have been
metallic (nickel, iron…) minerals. Chemical reactions tested include some that are
reminiscent of biochemical reactions in chemoautotrophic cells alive today. Günter
Wächtershäuser proposed the Iron-sulfur world theory of life’s origins in these
vents, also called “black smokers”. These vents now spew large amounts of CH4
and NH4 and experiments favor the idea that iron-sulfur aggregates in and around
black smokers could provide catalytic surfaces for the prebiotic formation of
organic molecules like methanol and formic acid from dissolved CO2 and the CH4
and NH4 coming from the vents. Wächtershäuser is also credited with the idea that
prebiotic selection acted not so much on isolated chemical reactions, but on
aggregates of metabolic reactions.
We might think of such metabolic aggregates as biochemical pathways or multiple
integrated pathways. Wächtershäuser proposed the selection of cyclic chemical
reactions that released free energy usable by other reactions. This prebiotic
metabolic evolution of reaction chemistries (rather than a simpler chemical
evolution) would have been essential to the origins of life. A variety of
extremophiles (e.g., thermophilic archaea) now living in and around black smokers
seems to be testimony to black smoker origins of life.

CMB3e

536

While the idea of selecting metabolic pathways has great merit, there are problems
with a life-origins scenario in volcanic hydrothermal vents. For one thing, their high
temperatures would have destroyed as many organic molecules as were created.
Also, the extremophilic archaea now found around these volcanic vents cannot be
the direct descendants of any cells that might have originated there. Woese’s
phylogeny clearly shows that archaea share a lineage with eukaryotes (not
eubacteria - see above). Therefore, extremophilic cellular life originating in the
vents must have first have given rise to a more moderate LUCA before then dying
off themselves…, after which extremophiles would once again evolve
independently to re-colonize the vents! This mitigates against an extremophilesfirst origins scenario. Given these concerns, recent proposals focus on life origins
in less extreme alkaline hydrothermal vents.
2. Origins in an Alkaline Deep-Sea Vent (White Smoker)
Of the several scenarios discussed here, an origin of autotrophic life in alkaline
vents is one of the more satisfying alternatives to a soupy origin of heterotrophic
cells. For starters, at temperatures closer to 100oC -150oC, alkaline vents (white
smokers) are not nearly as hot as are black smokers. An alkaline vent is shown
below.

http://oceanexplorer.noaa.gov/explorations/04fire/logs/hirez/cha
mpagne_vent_hirez.jpg

CMB3e

537

Other chemical and physical conditions of alkaline vents are also consistent with
an origins-of-life scenario dependent on metabolic evolution. For one thing, the
interface of alkaline vents with acidic ocean waters has the theoretic potential to
generate many different organic molecules [Shock E, Canovas P. (2010) The
potential for abiotic organic synthesis and biosynthesis at seafloor hydrothermal
systems. Geofluids 10 (1-2):161-92)].
In laboratory simulations of alkaline vent conditions, the presence of dissolved CO2
favors serpentinization, a reaction of water and heat with serpentinite, an ironcontaining mineral found on land and in the oceanic crust. A sample of
serpentinite is shown below.

CC BY-SA 4.0 From: https://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?curid=48672474 Gabriel HM - Own work,

Experimental serpentinization produces hydrocarbons and a warm aqueous
oxidation of iron produces H2 that could account for abundant H2 in today’s white
smoker emissions. Also, during serpentinization, a mineral called olivine [(Mg+2,
Fe+2)2SiO4] reacts with dissolved CO2 to form methane (CH4). So, the first
precondition of life, the energetically favorable creation of organic molecules, is
possible in alkaline vents.

CMB3e

538

Proponents of cellular origins in a late-Hadean non-reducing ocean also realized
that organic molecules formed in an alkaline (or any) vent would disperse and be
rapidly neutralized in the wider acidic oceans waters. Somehow, origins on a nonreducing planet had to include some way to contain newly formed organic
molecules from the start, and to power further biochemical evolution. What then,
were the conditions in an alkaline vent that could have contained organic
molecules and led to metabolic evolution and ultimately, life’s origins? Let’s
consider an intriguing proposal that gets at an answer!
The porous rock structure of today’s alkaline vents provides micro-spaces or
micro-compartments that might have captured alkaline liquids emitted by white
smokers. It turns out that conditions in today’s alkaline vents also support the
formation of hydrocarbon biofilms. Micro-compartments lined with such biofilms
could have formed a primitive prebiotic membrane against a rocky “cell wall”, within
which alkaline waters would be trapped. The result would be a natural proton
gradient between the alkaline solutions of organic molecules trapped in the microcompartments and the surrounding acidic ocean waters. Did all this happen?
Perhaps! Without a nutrient-rich environment, heterotrophs-first is not an option.
That leaves only the alternate option: an autotrophs-first scenario for the origins
of life. Nick Lane and his coworkers proposed that proton gradients were the
selective force behind the evolution of early metabolic chemistries in the alkaline
vent scenario (Prebiotic Proton Gradient Energy Fuels Origins of Life). Organized
around biofilm compartments, prebiotic structures and chemistries would have
harnessed the free energy of the natural proton gradients. In other words, the first
protocells, and then cells, may have been chemoautotrophs.
Last but not least, how might chemoautotrophic chemistries on a non-reducing
planet have supported polymer formation, as well as polymer replication?
Today we see storage and replication of information in nucleic acids as separate
from enzymatic catalysis of biochemical reactions. But are they all that separate?
If replication is the faithful reproduction of the information needed for a cell, then
enzymatic catalysis ensures the redundant production of all molecules essential to
make the cell! Put another way, if catalyzed polymer synthesis is the replication of
the workhorse molecules that accomplish cellular tasks, then what we call
‘replication’ is nothing more than the replication of nucleic acid information needed
to faithfully reproduce these workhorse molecules. So, was there an early,
coordinated, concurrent selection of mechanisms for the catalyzed metabolism as
well as catalyzed polymer synthesis and replication? We’ll return to these
questions shortly, when we consider the origins of life in an RNA world.

CMB3e

539

Life-origins in a non-reducing (and oxygen-free) atmosphere raise additional
questions. Would proton gradients provide enough free energy to fuel and
organize life’s origins? If so, how did cells arising from prebiotic chemiosmotic
metabolism actually harness the energy of a proton gradient? Before life, were
protocells already able to transduce gradient free energy into chemical free
energy? And was ATP selected to hold chemical free energy from the start?
Alternatively, was the relief of the gradient coupled at first to the synthesis of other
high-energy intermediate compounds with e.g., thioester linkages? Later on, how
did cells formed in alkaline vents escape the vents to colonize the rest of the
planet?
Regardless of how proton gradient free energy was initially captured, the
chemoautotrophic LUCA must have already have been using membrane-bound
proton pumps and an ATPase to harness gradient free energy to make ATP, since
all of its descendants do so. Finally, when did photoautotrophy (specifically
oxygenic photoautotrophy) evolve? Was it a late evolutionary event? Is it
possible that photosynthetic cells evolved quite early among some of the
chemoautotrophic denizens of the white smokers, biding their time before
exploding on the scene to create our oxygenic environment?
351 Life Origins in a Thermal Vent
3. Heterotrophs-First vs. Autotrophs-First: Some Evolutionary Considerations
In the alkaline vent scenario, chemiosmotic metabolism predated life. Therefore,
the first chemoautotrophic cells did not need the fermentative reactions required by
cells in a heterotrophs-first origin scenario. Even though all cells alive today
incorporate a form of glycolytic metabolism, glycolysis may not be the oldest
known biochemical pathway, as we have thought for so long.
In support of a later evolution of glycolytic enzymes, those of the archaea show
little structural resemblance to those of bacteria. If fermentative heterotrophy was
a late evolutionary development, then LUCA and its early descendants would lack
a well-developed glycolytic pathway. Instead, the LUCA must have been one of
many ‘experimental’ autotrophic cells, most likely a chemoautotroph deriving free
energy from inorganic chemicals in the environment. To account for
heterotrophy in the three domains of life, it must have evolved separately in the two
antecedent branches descending from the last universal common ancestor of
bacterial, archaeal and eukaryotic organisms.

4. Summing Up
Speculation about life’s origins begins by trying to identify a source of free energy
with which to make organic molecules. The first cells might have been
heterotrophs formed in a reducing earth environment, from which autotrophs later
evolved. On the other hand, the earliest cells may have been autotrophs formed
under non-reducing conditions in the absence of a primordial soup. Then, only
after these autotrophs had produced enough nutrient free energy to sustain them
did heterotrophs belatedly emerge. Discoveries suggesting that the earth’s
atmosphere was a non-reducing one more that 4 billion years ago (soon after the
formation of the planet), and that there was life on earth 3.95 billion years ago

CMB3e

541

favor metabolic origins of autotrophic life in a thermal vent, likely an alkaline vent.
Questions nevertheless remain about life-origins under non-reducing conditions.
Even the composition of the prebiotic atmosphere is still in contention (see NonReducing earth-Not so fast!).
For now, let us put these concerns aside for a moment and turn to events that get
us from the LUCA and its early descendants to the elaborated chemistries
common to all cells today. The descriptions that follow are educated guesses
about pathways taken early on towards the familiar cellularity now on earth. They
mainly address the selection of catalytic mechanisms, replicative metabolism, the
web of intersecting biochemical pathways, and the even more intricate chemical
communication that organized cell function and complexity.

Origins of Life Chemistries in an RNA World

In the tidal pool scenario, with its feel of ‘best-fit’ with origins of life in a reducing
environment, the energy for polymer formation from organic monomers came from an
overheated earth environment. In that scenario, we considered the possibility that chains
of nucleotides might have been synthesized, and then even replicated to form populations
of nucleic acids. But if the prebiotic environment was non-reducing, where would the
energy have come from to make any polymers, let alone ones that could replicate
themselves? If you guessed that the energy was provided by a proton gradient between
biofilm-enclosed acidic proto-cells and an alkaline ocean…, you would have been right!
In this case, then polymers would have been synthesized in enclosed spaces, and not in
tidal pools only to be dispersed and diluted in the wider oceans. And then, how would
replicative, informational and catalytic chemistries have arisen from these organic
monomers and polymers? Polypeptides would have formed, but they have no inherent
chemical or structural basis for self-replication. Unlike polypeptides, we saw in describing
the tidal pool scenario that polynucleotides (nucleic acids) do! In fact, evidence is
accumulating to support the increasingly accepted hypothesis that life originated in a RNA
world:

 Today’s RNAs include ribozymes that catalyze their own replication (e.g., self-splicing
introns).
 Some RNAs are part of ribonucleoproteins with at least co-catalytic activity (recall
ribosomes, spliceosomes and the secretory signal recognition particle).
 Retroviruses (e.g., HIV) store their genetic information in RNA genomes that may
have been integral to the emergence of cellular life.

CMB3e

542

Ribozymes, ribonucleoprotein structures and retroviruses may be legacies of a prebiotic
RNA world. In fact, in an ‘in vitro evolution study’, self-replicating ribozyme polymerases
in a test tube become more efficient at replicating a variety of increasingly longer and
more complex RNAs over time. For more about these autocatalysts, click Artificial
Ribozyme Evolution Supports Early RNA World.
There are hypothetical RNA world scenarios for the origins of replicating, catalytic
polymers, and even a real organic chemical autocatalyst that can catalyze its own
synthesis. So, which may have come first? A self-replicating RNA or some other selfreplicating molecule, even a self-replicating organic molecule? Arguably, chemical
evolution of an autocatalytic RNA is a stretch, but at least one organic molecule, AminoAdenosine Triacid-Ester (AATE), is a present-day self-replicating autocatalyst. Could an
organic molecule like AATE have been a prebiotic prelude to the RNA world? The
structure and replication of AATE are described below.

Illustration by G. Bergtrom

CMB3e

543

The replicative reaction proceeds in the following steps:




The aminoadenosine triacid ester binds another molecule of aminoadenosine.
The two aminoadenosines, now in opposite orientations, can attract and bind a
second ester.
After bond-rearrangements, the molecule separates into two molecules of AATE.

This reaction is catalytic because the stereochemistry of the reacting molecules creates
an affinity of the aminoadenosine ester molecule first for an additional free
aminoadenosine molecule, and then for a second free ester. The structure formed allows
(i.e., catalyzes) linkage of the second aminoadenosine and ester followed by the
separation of both AATE molecules. Subtle, sequential changes in the molecular
conformation of the molecules result in the changes in affinities of the molecules for each
other. In the replicative reaction, the AATE, free ester and free aminoadenosine
concentrations would drive the reaction. Could AATE-like molecules have been
progenitors of autocatalyzed polymer replication? Could replication of a prebiotic AATElike molecule have led to an RNA world? Could primitive RNAs have been stabilized by
binding to short prebiotic peptides, becoming forerunners of ribozymes? The possibility of
a prebiotic AATE-like molecule is intriguing because the ‘triacid’ includes a nucleotide
base, the purine adenosine! On the other hand, the possibility of prebiotic replicating
RNA-peptide complexes implies the origins of life in an RNA-Protein world (rather than
exclusively RNA-world)! Whether life began in an RNA world or an RNA-protein world,
catalyzed replication is of course another property of life.

Molecules Talk: Selecting Molecular Communication and
Complexity

In our complex human society, we define communication by its specificity. Without a
careful choice of words, our speech would be at best, a source of magnificent
misunderstanding…, or just plain babel! What does this mean for prebiotic chemistries?
In terms of prebiotic chemical evolution, selection by definition would have favored
protective accumulation of longer-lived molecular aggregates. Over time, the same
selective imperatives would create webs of such aggregates, increasing the range and
specificity of molecular interactions in a challenging environment. If this were to have
occurred in an enclosed proto-cellular space, it should have resulted in a primitive
molecular communication and a growing complexity (another property of life!). In fact, all

CMB3e

544

of the properties of life must have accompanied the achievement of more and more
complex intermolecular communication. Simply put, a prebiotic (or for that matter a
cellular) genetic change that alters the rate of one catalytic reaction (if not destructive) will
drive the selection of changes in components of other, interconnected metabolic
chemistries. If molecular communication required the evolution of catalytic specificity,
then the final elaboration of complexity and order as a property of life further requires the
selection of mechanisms of regulation and coordination.
C. Intermolecular Communication Leads to An Early Establishment of Essential
Interconnected Chemistries
Earlier, we suggested that inorganic catalyst precursors to biological enzymes were
probably minerals embedded in clay or other substrata, providing surfaces that would
naturally aggregate organic molecules and catalyze repetitive reactions. Either the
initial objects of prebiotic selection included external stable monomers and polymers,
outside or as seems more likely, inside proto-cells. Later, selection would have
favored polymers that enhanced growth and reproduction of successful aggregates.
These polymers were likely those that catalyzed their own synthesis, perhaps
collaborating with inorganic catalytic minerals. The result would be the elaboration of
a web of interconnected chemical reactions between molecules with high affinity for
each other, thereby increasing the specificity of those reactions. In the context of life
origins and evolution, co-catalysis describes the activities of these interconnected
metabolic reactions.
As noted, high-affinity interactions are inherently protective. During prebiotic
chemical/metabolic evolution, protected stable molecular assemblies would be
targets of selection. Continuing co-evolution of catalysts, substrates and co-catalytic
reaction sets would lead to more and more sophisticated molecular communication.
Once established, efficient biochemical reaction sets would be constrained against
significant evolutionary change. Any change (mutation) that threatened this efficiency
would mean the end of a prebiotic chemical (or for that matter, cell) lineage! This
explains why we find common pathways for energy-generation (e.g., autotrophic and
fermentative), reproduction (replication), and information storage and retrieval (DNA,
RNA, protein synthesis) in all of LUCA’s descendants.
Sophisticated, effective communication requires coordination. In fact, effective
communication is defined by coordination, the capacity to make chemical decisions.
Selection of molecular aggregates that sequestered metabolic reactions behind a
semipermeable membrane ensure that only certain molecules communicate with each
other. This sequestration is likely to have occurred repeatedly during chemical
evolution, beginning with the synthesis of larger, polymeric molecules and possibly, an

CMB3e

545

aggregation of primitive lipoidal molecules. We can think of increasingly effective
catalysis in an enclosed environment as a conversation mediated by good
speakers! Coordination is a property that likely co-evolved with life itself!
B. Origins of Coordination
Let’s look some possible structures churning around in the prebiotic chemistry set that
might have self-assembled, or sequestered compatible chemistries of life. Along with
the alkaline vent biofilm compartment, coacervates, proteinoid microspheres and
liposomes have been considered as possible progenitors of biological membranes.
Each can be made in the laboratory. They are demonstrably semipermeable, and in
some cases can even replicate! Micrographs and the production of coacervates,
proteinoid microspheres and liposomes are shown below.

Oparin had proposed that the action of sunlight in the absence of oxygen could cause
ionized, oppositely charged organic molecules (e,g, amino acids, carbohydrates, etc.)
to form droplets from organic molecules in his primordial soup. These coacervates
were actually produced in 1932, visualized by microscopy and demonstarted to be a
semi-permeable compartment. They even behaved as if they were able to grow and
reproduce (also as Oparin originally suggested they might).
In the 1950s, Sidney Fox produced proteinoid microspheres from short peptides
that formed spontaneously from aqueous amino acid solutions heated to dryness (not
unlike what happens in the tidal pool scenario of polymer formation from organic
monomers). These can be seen by light and electron microscopy.
While liposomes are easily made in a laboratory, it isn’t clear that they existed on a
pre-biotic earth. Nevertheless, cell membranes must have had acquired their
phospholipid bilayer structure by the time of LUCA since we all have them! Prior to
LUCA, chemical rearrangenments must have occurred to enable incorporation of a
phospholipid bilayer into whatever starting boundary life started with.
We have already considered the biofilm proposed for cellular origins in an alkaline
vent. The formation of such biofilms would have separated acidic ocean protons from
the interior of such protocells, creating a proton gradient. Such a gradient could have
driven the early evolution of chemiososis as a means to create chemical energy,
complete with the eventual selection of ATP synthases and the enzymes of proton
transport, again because all cells descendent from LUCA’s posess these
biochemistries.
Of course, proteinoid microspheres, coacervates, biofilm-based ‘membranes and
liposomes are not alive, and are therefore not cells. But one or another of them must
have been where the enhanced coordination of molecular communication required
for life began.
354 Protected Molecular Communication: Semipermeable Membranes
An important take-home message here is that whatever the original structure of the
first cells, they arose soon after the organic chemical prerequisites of life began to
acquire familiar metabolic functions. We need to see chemical and structural progress
to cellularity as concurrent metabolic evolutionary events. At some point, selection of
sequestered biochemistries led to protocells, then to the first cells, each with all of the
properties of life.

CMB3e

547

Finally, selection of highly specific communication between cellular molecules allowed
cells themselves to talk to one another, engage in group activities, and eventually join
together to form multicellular organisms. Multicellularity is of course a characteristic of
many if not most eukaryotes. But watch a great TED Talk on bacterial intercellular
communication by Dr. Bonnie Bassler at Intercellular Communication in Bacteria.
C. Origins of Information Storage and Retrieval in an RNA World
Let us accept for now that molecular communication began concurrently with the
packaging of interconnected co-catalytic sets into semipermeable structures. Then
the most ‘fit’ of these structures were selected for efficient coordination of meaningful,
timely chemical messages. Ultimately, coordination requires information
processing, storage and retrieval, something we recognize in Francis Crick’s
Central Dogma of information flow from DNA to RNA to protein. Cells and organisms
do coordination quite well, but what do its beginnings look like? The answer may lie in
the pre-biotic RNA world we discussed earlier. The Central Dogma, modified to
account for reverse transcription and the behavior of retroviruses, is shown below.

CMB3e

548

We do not really know how cells came to rely on DNA to store, pass on and mobilize
genetic information, but we have presented reasons to believe that the first replicating
nucleic acid was RNA, creating an RNA world. Here is the evidence that leads us to
this conclusion.







Based on the stem-and-loop and other structures that form when RNA molecules
undergo internal H-bonding, we know that RNAs can take on varied and intricate
shapes.
Diverse conformations are consistent with the evolution of specificity in the
interaction of RNAs with themselves and/or with other molecules in the prebiotic
environment.
RNAs, either alone as autocatalysts (for example, self-splicing mRNAs) or in
catalytic ribonucleoprotein complexes (e.g., ribosomes) exist in cells today.
Some of these RNAs (specifically rRNAs), have a long phylogenetic heritage,
shared by cells in all three domains of life.

The propensity of single stranded RNA molecules to fold based on internal H-bonding
can lead to those diverse three-dimensional shapes (tertiary structure). These
structures could have interacted with other molecules in a prebiotic environment.
Because they could be replicated according to different prebiotic scenarios, the same
RNAs could also pass on simple genetic information contained in their base
sequences. The combination of informational and catalytic properties in a single
molecule is illustrated below.

The capacity of RNAs as catalysts and warehouses of genetic information speaks to
an efficient candidate for the first dual or multi-purpose polymer, a property that is not
known and cannot be demonstrated for DNA. Read more about the proposed ‘RNA
worlds’ in which life may have begun in Cech TR (2012) [The RNA Worlds in Context.
In Cold Spring Harbor Perspectives in Biology (Cold Spring Harbor, NY: Cold Spring
Harbor press) 4(7):a006742e].
355 Self-Replication: Information, Communication & Coordination
What might RNA catalysis beyond self-replication have looked like in simpler times?
Consider the interaction between a two hypothetical RNAs and different hypothetical
amino acids bound to each, shown below.

Illustration by G. Bergtrom

CMB3e

550

The binding of each RNA to its amino acid would be a high affinity, specific interaction
based on charge and shape complementarity. Likewise, the two RNAs seen in the
illustration must have a high affinity for each other, also based on chemical and
physical complementarities. One can even envision some strong H-bonding between
bases in the two RNAs that might displace intra-strand H-bonding (not shown here).
The result is that the two amino acids are brought together in a way that catalyzes
peptide bond formation. This will require an input of free energy (recall that peptide
bond is one of the most energy intensive reaction in cells). For now, assume a
chemical energy source and let us focus on the specificities required for RNA catalytic
activity.
We know now that tRNAs the intermediaries between nucleic acids and polypeptide
synthesis. So it’s fair to ask how the kind of activity illustrated above could have led to
the tRNA-amino acid interactions we see today. There is no obvious binding
chemistry between today’s amino acids and RNAs, but there may be a less obvious
legacy of the proposed bindings. This has to do with the fact that the genetic code is
universal, which means that any structural relationship between RNA and amino acids
must have been selected early (at the start!) of cellular life on earth. Here is the
argument.
1. The code is indeed universal (or nearly so)
2. There is a correlation between the chemical properties of amino acids and their
codons, for example:
 Charged (polar) amino acids are encoded by triplet codons with more G
(guanine) bases.
 Codons for uncharged amino acids more often contain a middle U (uracil) than
any other base.
These correlations would mean that an early binding of amino acids to specifically
folded RNAs was replaced in evolution by enzyme-catalyzed covalent attachment of
an amino acid to a ‘correct’ tRNA, such as we see today.
What forces might have selected separation of the combined template/informational
functions from most of the catalytic activities of RNAs? Perhaps it was the selection of
the greater diversity of structure (i.e., shape) that folded polypeptides can achieve,
compared to folded RNAs. After all, polypeptides are strings of 20 different amino
acids compared to the four bases that make up nucleic acids. This potential for
molecular diversity would in turn accelerate the pace of chemical (and ultimately
cellular) evolution.

CMB3e

551

A scenario for the transition from earlier self-replicating RNA events to the translation
of proteins from mRNAs is illustrated here.

Illustration by G. Bergtrom

Adaptor RNAs in the illustration will become tRNAs. The novel, relatively unfolded
RNA depicts a presumptive mRNA. Thus, even before the entry of DNA into our
RNA world, it is possible to imagine the selection of the defining features of the
genetic code and mechanism of translation (protein synthesis) that characterizes all
life on the planet. Next, we consider “best-speculations” of how RNA-based
information storage and catalytic chemistries might have made the evolutionary
transition to DNA-based information storage and predominantly protein based
enzyme catalysis.
D. From Ribozymes to Enzymes; From RNA to DNA
The term co-catalysis could very well describe biochemical reactions in which a
catalyst accelerates a chemical reaction whose product feeds back in some way on its
own synthesis. We saw this in action when we discussed allosteric enzyme regulation
and the control of biochemical pathways. Catalytic feedback loops must have been
significant events in the evolution of the intermolecular communication and metabolic
coordination required for life.
CMB3e

552

Here we will consider some scenarios for the transition from an RNA world to
something more recognizable as today’s nucleic acid information storage and proteinbased catalytic metabolism.
1. Ribozymes Branch Out: Replication, Transcription and Translation
If RNAs catalyzed their own replication, it may have resembled the autocatalytic
replication of AATE. At the same time, some RNAs may also have attracted amino
acids to their surfaces and catalyzed peptide bond formation, as already described.
Shapely prebiotic RNAs may therefore have catalyzed synthesized peptides, some
of which would eventually take over catalysis of RNA synthesis! The scenario is
summarized below.

Illustration by G. Bergtrom

356 Information Storage and Retrieval in an RNA World
Selection favoring the synthesis of short oligopeptides and polypeptides is
consistent with a catalytic diversification that led to the dominance of protein
catalysts, i.e., enzymes. The primitive enzyme shown here must have been
selected because at first, it assisted the autocatalytic replication of the RNA itself!
Over time, the enzyme would evolve along with the RNA. This co-evolution then
eventually replaced autocatalytic RNA replication with the enzyme-catalyzed RNA
synthesis we recognize as transcription today. In this scenario, self-splicing premRNAs and ribozymes are surviving remnants of an RNA world!
Let’s turn now to some ideas about how an RNA world could make the transition to
the DNA-RNA-protein world we have today.

The transfer of function from RNA to DNA is by no means a settled issue among
students of life origins and early evolution. A best guess is that the elaboration of
protein enzymes begun in the RNA world would lead to reverse transcriptase-like
enzymes that copied RNA information into DNA molecules. DNA information may
have been selected because DNA is chemically more stable than RNA. The basic
transfer scenario is illustrated below.

Illustration by G.
Bergtrom

All cells alive today store information in DNA (only some viruses have an RNA
genome). Therefore, transition to the use of DNA as an information molecule must
have preceded the origin of life. At least, it must have occurred in the cells from
which the LUCA arose. Details of this key change involve evolutionary steps yet to
be worked out to everyone’s satisfaction!

E. The Evolution of Biochemical Pathways
The tale of the evolution of enzymes from ribozymes and of informational DNA from
RNA, and the other metabolic chemistries behind prebiotic semipermeable boundaries
is ongoing in cells today. Undoubtedly, early cellular metabolism involved only
reactions crucial to life…, catalyzed by a limited number of enzymes. But, if evolution
inexorably trends towards greater complexity of molecular communication and
coordination…, in other words, towards increasingly refined regulation of metabolism,
how did the repertoire of enzymes get larger, and how did biochemical pathways
become more elaborate? We answered the first question elsewhere, when we
discussed gene duplication (e.g., by unequal crossing over). The duplicate genes
encoding the same enzyme provided the raw material for new enzymes and new
enzymatic functions.
Whether in cells or in prebiotic structures, we can hypothesize how a new chemical
reaction could evolve. For example, assume that a cell acquires molecule D required
for an essential function, from an external, environmental source. What happens if
levels of D in the environment become limiting? Clearly, cells would die without
enough D. That is, unless cells that already have a duplicated, redundant gene that
has mutated and now encodes an enzyme with the ability to make D in the cell. Such
a cell might have existed with other cells without the mutation, but a D-limited
environment would select the mutant cell for survival and reproduction. Imagine the
scenario illustrated below.

CMB3e

555

In a similar scenario, a mutation in a duplicated gene could result in a novel enzyme
activity that can convert some molecule (e.g., C or D) in the cell into a new molecular
product. If the new enzyme and molecular product do not kill or debilitate the cell, the
cell might survive to be selected by some future exigency.

VII.

A Summary and Some Conclusions

Our consideration of how life began on earth was intentionally placed at the end of this
textbook, after we tried to get a handle on how cells work. Clearly any understanding of
life origins scenarios is very much a matter of informed, if divergent speculations.
Alternative notions for the origins of life entertained here all address events that presaged
life under ‘best-guess’ hypothetical conditions. After trying to get a grip on prebiotic
events, we asked how we got from what could have happened under a given set of
prebiotic conditions to the cellular life we recognize today. All proposals recognize that
the first cells had all of the properties of life (including evolution itself). Starting with that
common understanding, all arguable scenarios try to navigate pathways from primitive,
less controlled chemistries to more regulated and coordinated metabolisms, in other
words from chemical simplicity to biochemical complexity. The chemical and metabolic
evolution that began before life may have overlapped in time with cellular evolution, at
least until the LUCA. While chemical evolution was mainly a series of selections by the
physicality of a prebiotic world, the evolution of life contends with both that physical world,
and with life itself. LUCA, the universal common ancestor, had already escaped the RNA
world, replicating DNA, transcribing RNA and translating mRNAs into polypeptides, all
behind a semipermeable phospholipid bilayer. Whether a heterotroph or (increasingly
more likely) an autotroph, LUCA used the energy of ATP to power all of its cellular work,
as do its descendants. Thus, cellular evolution, in fact all life after the LUCA, is focused
on continued selection of the complexities of metabolism that enables the spread and
diversification of life from wherever it started.
The selection of chemistries and traits encoded by already existing, accumulated random,
neutral genetic changes, continue to this day, increasing the diversity of species and their
spread to virtually every conceivable ecological niche on the planet. The overall takehome message of this chapter should be an understanding of how the molecular basis of
evolution can help us understand how life may have begun on earth (or anywhere for that
matter!). In turn, speculation about life’s origins informs us about how the properties of
life were selected under a set of prebiotic physical and chemical conditions.
