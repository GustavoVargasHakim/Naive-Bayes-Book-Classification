PREFACE

Many students decide to follow a career path that is related to medicine,
for example Biomedical Sciences (Medical Technology in the USA), Clinical
Sciences, Clinical Physiology and Nursing. While there are a number of
textbooks for medical students and nurses as well as a number covering the
clinical biochemistry area, there did not seem to us to be a book that dealt with
disease from a more scientific standpoint. Such a book would cover a range
of disease conditions, their causes and diagnoses, and outline treatment but
set at an appropriate level. The idea of writing Biology of Disease arose from
discussions between ourselves and various colleagues and students over a
number of years regarding the absence of a single book, which summarized
most of the clinical material studied by first- and second-year Biomedical
Sciences and related-degree students. It was felt that such a textbook would
assist students during the first and second years of their degree programmes,
particularly if it covered aspects of the Biomedical Sciences appropriate
to courses accredited by the Institute of Biomedical Science of the UK and
similar courses elsewhere.
When writing Biology of Disease it was decided to include appropriate
background material, describing it in relatively simple terms. However, in
practice it was not possible to cover all these aspects; hence some preknowledge
of biochemistry and cell and molecular biology has been assumed. Although
Biology of Disease is not primarily a medical textbook, we do think it could
also be of value to students participating in foundation courses for medical
schools. The areas and topics covered by the term biomedical sciences are vast
and we have had to curtail the number of topics included ‚Äì modern medicine
and its ancillary subjects represent a huge body of knowledge.
The structure of the book aims to help students plan their learning and
navigate their way through complex topics. For example, all chapters begin
with clearly stated Objectives, followed by a short Introduction to set the scene
for the ensuing contents. The main body of text of all the chapters includes
‚ÄòBoxes‚Äô of one or two pages length to highlight a medical or scientific aspect
we felt to be of special interest. Margin Notes emphasize material worth
highlighting and provide a little extra explanation to the text. Each chapter
has a concluding short Summary. Students (and staff) can test themselves
against the chapter material using the simple Case Studies and relevant
end-of-chapter questions provided. Each chapter is illustrated by simple line
diagrams, light and electron micrographs and tables, as well as molecular
models of compounds of interest.

PREFACE

Units and drug nomenclature proved somewhat troublesome! For the sake
of consistency, we have generally tried to apply SI units whenever possible.
Within the UK, differing hospitals seem to apply units on a rather arbitrary
basis and, indeed, other countries, such as the USA, use differing units and
systems of nomenclature. Thus, for example, in the UK a serum cholesterol
concentration greater than 5 mmol dm‚Äì3 is regarded as clinically dangerous
whereas the corresponding unit used in the US is 190 mg dL‚Äì1. In such cases, we
have generally made somewhat arbitrary decisions and used whatever units
seemed best suited to the purpose. We have applied a similar ad hoc system
for naming some biological materials and drugs. Thus, for example in the
USA adrenaline and paracetamol are called epinephrine and acetaminophen
respectively. We have used UK nomenclature.
We are grateful to the many people who helped in producing Biology of Disease,
especially to our graphic artist, Mick Hoult of Manchester Metropolitan
University, who not only drew and re-drew all of the many figures in the text
and frequently improved upon our initial hazy notions and crude sketches. We
would like to thank the numerous colleagues who offered helpful advice and
suggestions, and to the many individuals who supplied illustrations. We are
also grateful to our reviewers; in particular, Dr David Holmes of the University
of Northumbria at Newcastle-upon-Tyne who commented on nearly every
chapter but also to the individual reviewers of each respective chapter. Thanks
must also go to the team at Taylor & Francis, especially editorial assistant
Chris Dixon and editor Liz Owen, for their constant encouragement, and to
our production editor Karin Henderson. However, the authors themselves
take responsibility for any errors and omissions as well as for those parts of
the text that are still not as clear or comprehensive as they might be. We hope
that you will write and tell us how we can still further improve the book for the
benefit of future editions.

1.1

INTRODUCTION

Disease can be defined as any abnormality or failure of the body to function
properly and this may require medical treatment (Figure 1.1). The scientific
study of diseases is called pathology.
Every disease has a distinct set of features that include a cause, associated
clinical symptoms and a characteristic progression, with associated
morphological and functional changes in the patient. The presence of an
abnormality on its own, however, does not necessarily indicate disease since
the affected individual must also suffer from ill health. Health can be defined as
an absence of signs and symptoms associated with any disease. This definition
has limitations in that there are circumstances where individuals believe
they are ill even though detectable indications of disease are not present.
Conversely, there are individuals who believe they are healthy but on detailed
examination are found to suffer from a serious disease. For this reason, the
World Health Organization (WHO) devised the more appropriate definition
of health as a state of physical, mental and social well-being and not merely
the absence of disease. Currently there is considerable interest, particularly in
developed countries, in promoting health by improving lifestyle and reducing
mental and social factors associated with ill health.
Individuals differ in their physical appearance and also internally in the
composition of the biological materials of which they are made. Differences

THE NATURE AND INVESTIGATION OF DISEASES

between individuals are due to biological variation. Variation in values for
measurable body features or biological substances (analytes) occurs for a
number of reasons. Differences in the genotypes of individuals ensure that no
two individuals are the same (other than identical twins). Biological variation
arises due to differences in lifestyle, experiences, dietary and other factors as
well as genes. There are also differences in physiological processes arising from
bodily control mechanisms. For example, the concentration of blood glucose
varies between individuals with diet, time of day and physical activity.

1.2

CHARACTERISTIC FEATURES OF DISEASES

Every disease has a number of characteristic features. These features allow
diseases to be categorized and allow a better understanding of the disease, its
diagnosis and management. A correct diagnosis should mean that appropriate
treatment is given.

ETIOLOGY

pathogen, Neisseria meningitidis, a causative

'

Etiology refers to the cause of a disease. Etiological agents can be endogenous,
in other words originating from within the body, or exogenous, coming from
outside the body. Endogenous agents include genetic defects and endocrine
disorders, while exogenous agents include microorganisms such as viruses
(Figure 1.2), bacteria (Figure 1.3) and fungi that cause infections, chemicals,
physical trauma and radiation. Many diseases are said to be predictable and
arise as a direct consequence of exposure to the causative agent. Other diseases
are considered probable in that they may be a consequence of the causative
agent but the development of illness is not inevitable. An individual can be
infected with a pathogenic microorganism but the outcome of the disease
may depend on other factors such as the nutritional and immune status of
the affected person.
Some diseases have more than one etiological agent and may, indeed, be
caused by a range of factors. Such diseases are said to be multifactorial in
origin. Diabetes mellitus type 2, a disorder of carbohydrate, fat and protein
metabolism, is believed to have a multifactorial origin involving several genetic,
dietary and environmental factors (Chapter 7). Many diseases are of unknown
cause and are said to be idiopathic. An example of this is hypertension, where
more than 90% of cases are of unknown cause. The treatment of idiopathic
diseases is restricted to alleviating the symptoms. Some conditions are caused
by the effects of treatment and are called iatrogenic diseases (from the Greek
word iatros, doctor). The treatment of some cancers with cytotoxic drugs, for
example, can cause a severe iatrogenic anemia although they may be curing
the cancer.
Occasionally a disease of unknown etiology is more commonly found in
populations with certain dietary, occupational or lifestyle conditions called
risk factors. Smoking is a significant risk factor in the development of heart
disease and lung cancer (Chapters 14 and 17). Some risk factors may be
important in the development of the disease whereas others may make the
individual more susceptible to disease. Predisposing factors are conditions or
situations that make an individual more susceptible to disease. They include
age, sex, heredity and environmental factors. For example, the immune
system in a newborn is not fully developed and, as a consequence, babies
are more susceptible to infections. However, during aging the immune system
undergoes a progressive decline in function making the elderly also more
susceptible to infections. Sex may also be a predisposing factor: men are more
likely to suffer from gout than women whereas osteoporosis is more common
in the latter.

for Cancer Research, Royal Cancer Hospital, UK.

Some diseases increase the risk of developing others. Thus some conditions
increase the risk of someone developing cancer and are said to be premalignant.
This is seen in ulcerative colitis, an inflammatory condition affecting the
large intestine that increases the probability of developing bowel cancer in
sufferers. Some diseases predispose the patient to other conditions by allowing
infectious agents, not normally pathogenic, to cause disease. This is seen in
opportunistic infections where a decline in the immunological functions
of an individual makes them susceptible to infections by microorganisms
that are normally nonpathogenic. In acquired immunodeficiency syndrome
(AIDS), the individuals infected with the human immunodeficiency virus
(HIV), (Figure 1.4) have little resistance to infections by microorganisms,
such as those responsible for causing pneumonia, as well as microorganisms
such as the yeast Candida, which are part of the normal flora of the body
(Chapter 2).
Diseases are often described as being primary or secondary. Primary may
refer to a disease of unknown cause or idiopathic, whereas secondary is used
to refer to a condition that arises from an existing disease. However, these
terms are also often used to describe the stages of a disease. For example, in
cancer the primary tumor is the initial tumor whereas secondary tumors arise
following metastasis of the primary tumor to other tissues (Chapter 17).

PATHOGENESIS
Every disease has a pathogenesis that describes the development of the
disease or, more specifically, how the etiological agent(s) acts to produce
the clinical and pathological changes characteristic of that disease. Some
examples of how diseases undergo pathogenesis include inflammatory
reactions in response to harmful agents and carcinogenesis where the
formation of tumors occurs as a result of exposure to carcinogens (cancerinducing substances).

THE NATURE AND INVESTIGATION OF DISEASES

Diseases have ‚Äònatural histories‚Äô that describe the typical patterns of how
each disease usually progresses, its effects and its duration. The effects of the
disease on the patient are referred to as morbidity. Occasionally the morbidity
of a disease may cause disability that, in turn, may restrict the activities of
the patient. The mortality of a disease describes its possibility of causing
death. This is usually expressed as a percentage. Some diseases have a rapid,
often severe onset that is described as acute. However, other diseases have a
chronic onset and develop gradually over a relatively longer time. Thus acute
renal failure is characterized by rapid deterioration of kidney function over a
matter of days, while chronic renal failure develops over months or even years
(Chapter 8).
Diseases rarely occur immediately following exposure to an etiological agent.
In most cases, a period of time, the incubation period, must elapse before
the disease becomes apparent. In carcinogenesis, this period may last several
decades and is referred to as the latent period. With infectious diseases, the
time between exposure and development of the disease is often characteristic
of the infectious agent involved.

MANIFESTATIONS OF DISEASES
The etiology of a disease and its pathogenesis produce clinical manifestations
that include signs and symptoms of the disease. A symptom is an indication
that a disease is present and something of which the patient complains, for
example, nausea, malaise or pain (Table 1.1). A sign is something that the
clinician specifically looks or feels for, such as redness or swelling of the skin,
when examining the patient. Some diseases present with a subclinical stage
where these signs and symptoms are not apparent, even though the disease
is established and characteristic biochemical and cellular changes that are
detectable by laboratory analysis of, for example blood or urine have taken
place.
Clinical signs and symptoms are often accompanied by structural or functional
abnormalities, called lesions, in affected tissues that are responsible for
ill health and usually cause the signs and symptoms of disease. Lesions
may be biochemical in nature, such as defective hemoglobin in patients
with hemoglobinopathies (Chapter 13). Alternatively, a lesion may include
deposition of abnormal substances in cells, tissues and organs such as
deposition of amyloid in the brain in patients with Alzheimer‚Äôs disease (Chapter
18). Loss of healthy surface tissue, for example, in gastric ulceration, may also

CHARACTERISTIC FEATURES OF DISEASES

be a feature of some diseases. Diseases may involve functional abnormalities
such as an inappropriate secretion of hormones. Examples of these include
the excessive production of thyroid hormones in hyperthyroidism or the
inadequate secretion of insulin in type 1 diabetes mellitus. Other functional
defects might include impaired nerve conduction and muscular contraction.
The term syndrome is often applied to describe certain diseases that are
characterized by multiple abnormalities that form a distinct clinical picture.
For example, Cushing‚Äôs syndrome (Chapter 7) occurs when an excess of the
hormone cortisol produces a combination of clinical features that include
hirsutism (excessive growth of facial hair), obesity, hypertension and
characteristic facial and body features.
Some diseases frequently present with complications, that is, new or
separate processes secondary to, and a consequence of, the initial disease.
Diabetic cataracts, retinopathy and nephropathy are all chronic or long-term
complications of diabetes mellitus.
The manifestations of a disease in a given person are not static and are affected
by compensatory mechanisms in the body as well as by environmental
influences and responses to treatment. Diseases often have a range of
manifestations and their presence and severity may vary from patient to
patient. In addition to differences between individuals, differences occur
within an individual at different stages of development, from infancy to old
age. Figure 1.5 outlines the key features of some diseases in terms of their
etiology, pathogenesis and manifestations.

OUTCOME OF A DISEASE
The prognosis of a disease is its likely outcome. Prognoses can vary considerably
between different diseases and, of course, can be influenced by treatment.
Hence when giving a prognosis, it is necessary to clarify if the disease is
following its natural course or whether there is, or needs to be, medical or
surgical intervention. A viral disease such as German measles (rubella) will
normally resolve of its own accord, whereas a broken leg or a heart attack
needs treatment. With some diseases, especially some cancers, patients may
go through a period of good health with a reduction or disappearance of the
symptoms and the disease is said to be in remission. However, a relapse may
occur with a return of the disease symptoms following this period of apparent
recovery. Diseases with a tendency towards remission and relapse include
acute lymphoblastic leukemia and ulcerative colitis (Chapters 17 and 11).

THE NATURE AND INVESTIGATION OF DISEASES

1.3

CLASSIFICATION OF DISEASES

Some diseases share common features and can be grouped together in a
classification system. One way of classifying diseases is on the basis of their
cause (Table 1.2). This is by no means perfect as some diseases have multiple
causes and there is likely to be an overlap between the different categories.
Infectious diseases are caused when microorganisms such as viruses, bacteria,
fungi, protozoa and helminths enter and spread within the body (Chapters 2
and 3).
Immunological diseases (Chapters 4 and 5) occur in circumstances in
which the immune system can cause damage to the body‚Äôs own tissues. In
autoimmune conditions, for example autoimmune thyroiditis, antibodies are
produced that attack the body‚Äôs own tissues. Alternatively, there are diseases
associated with immunodeficiency that increase the susceptibility of the
patient to infectious agents. This occurs in severe combined immunodeficiency
(SCID) and in AIDS.
Endocrine diseases arise from the over- or underproduction of hormones or
from resistance to a particular hormone perhaps because the cellular receptor
is absent as the result of a mutation (Chapter 7). Thus, for example, acromegaly
is caused by the overproduction of growth hormone in adults, whereas type 2
diabetes mellitus is a consequence of insulin resistance, when the appropriate
target cells fail to respond to the hormone (Figure 1.6).
Homeostatic diseases arise when mechanisms for controlling homeostasis
are disrupted. For example, in the syndrome of ‚Äòinappropriate ADH secretion‚Äô
(Chapter 8) diminished urine production leads to an increase in body fluids.
Nutritional diseases result from an inadequate intake of nutrients, such as
proteins (which supply essential amino acids), carbohydrates, essential fatty
acids, vitamins or trace elements. Inadequate nutrition is a major cause of
disease, particularly in developing countries. Such deficiencies may be
generalized, as in protein-energy malnutrition (Chapter 10) where there
is simply not enough food, or there may be a lack of a specific nutrient, for
example, vitamin A (Figure 1.7) leading to several disorders including night
blindness. In contrast, in many developed countries an excessive intake of
energy combined with a lack of exercise is responsible for a worrying increase
in obesity.
Toxic diseases (Chapter 12) are caused by the ingestion of a variety of poisons
that may be encountered in the environment. Ingestion may be accidental or
deliberate. Carbon monoxide can be inhaled from car exhausts or faulty gas
fires or water heaters, causing tissue hypoxia and death.
Genetic diseases arise due to defects in the genes or chromosomes of
individuals (Chapter 15). A defective gene may result in the inadequate
production of a key enzyme, such as phenylalanine hydroxylase in
phenylketonuria. Down syndrome is an example of a disorder which arises
due to an abnormal chromosome complement. Some genetic disorders
are not inherited from parents and may arise from a new genetic mutation
in the offspring, as in the disease progeria. Congenital diseases are present
at birth and may or may not have been inherited. They may arise due to a
developmental defect of known or unknown cause. Thus, a newborn may
suffer from fetal alcohol syndrome, a congenital condition arising as a
consequence of excessive alcohol intake by the mother during pregnancy.

Neoplastic diseases are characterized by the uncontrolled and abnormal
growth of cells. These cells form benign or malignant tumors (Chapter 17).
Malignant neoplasms are a major cause of death in many developed countries.
Moreover, their incidence is increasing as people live longer.

W^dad\nd[Y^hZVhZ

EPIDEMIOLOGY OF DISEASE

Traumatic diseases are caused by physical injury and include mechanical
trauma, extremes of heat or cold, electrical shock and radiation. Apart from
the obvious problems caused by extensive damage to tissues, traumatic
diseases may render an individual more prone to infection by compromizing
the immune system (Chapter 4).
Degenerative diseases involve the progressive loss of body tissues and
impairment of their functions usually associated with aging (Chapter 18).
Examples include neurodegenerative diseases, such as the relatively common
Alzheimer‚Äôs disease and muscular dystrophy.
Psychogenic diseases originate in the mind. They may have a significant
psychological or emotional component as seen, for example, in
schizophrenia.
Iatrogenic diseases arise as a consequence of treatment. For example,
patients who are receiving drugs, such as thiazide diuretics to control their
blood pressure, may suffer from low serum K+ (hypokalemia, see Chapter 8)
caused by an excessive renal loss. If untreated, hypokalemia may, in turn,
cause cardiac arrhythmias (Chapter 14). Finally, idiopathic diseases are those
of unknown cause.

1.4

EPIDEMIOLOGY OF DISEASE

Epidemiology is the study of how diseases spread in populations in relation
to their causal factors. Consequently, epidemiology is largely concerned with
the collection and interpretation of data about diseases in groups of people
rather than in individuals. The types of data collected in epidemiological
studies provide information about the etiology of the diseases, whether there
is a need for screening or the introduction of other preventative measures and
whether health care facilities are appropriate.

Figure 1.7 Computer generated model of vitamin
A (retinol).

The prevalence of a disease refers to the proportion of people in a population
affected at a specific time. The incidence rate is the number of new cases of a
disease in a population occurring within a specified period of time.
Epidemiological studies can often provide information about the cause(s)
of diseases. Thus if a disease has a high incidence in a particular region or
population, then the disease may have a genetic origin or it may be caused
by environmental factors peculiar to that area. Epidemiological studies of
migrant populations are especially useful since they can provide valuable
information on the etiology of a disease. A case in point might be where a
migrant population has a high incidence of a particular disease and then
moves to another geographical area where the incidence of the same disease
is low. If the incidence of disease in the migrant population remains high, then
it is likely that the disease has a genetic basis. If, however, the incidence in
the migrant population decreases to the level of the new geographical region,
then environmental factors probably play a role in its etiology.
The data on the incidence of some diseases are very reliable. This is especially
so for some infectious diseases and cancers that are notifiable. Clinicians are
legally required to supply details of all new cases of diseases on the notifiable
list to a central register. However, obtaining data on the incidence of other
diseases can be difficult. For most diseases, the data obtained refer to mortality
rates for that disease based on the causes listed on death certificates. This
method of obtaining data has the major limitation of underestimating the
incidence if the disease does not have a fatal outcome.
The incidence of certain diseases changes with time and also can vary
considerably from one country to another and even within different regions
of the same country. These differences are particularly marked between

THE NATURE AND INVESTIGATION OF DISEASES

developing and developed countries. Infectious diseases and malnutrition are
still more prevalent in developing countries, while in the developed world, the
incidence of many infectious diseases has been reduced dramatically in the
last 100 years. The infant mortality rate is often used as a measure of health
related to socioeconomic status. In general, the infant mortality rate is higher
in developing compared with developed countries.
The decreased incidence of many diseases in developed countries may reflect
changes in exposure to causative agents as well as the effects of preventative
measures. For example, the reduction of diseases such as cholera is associated,
in a large part, with improved public health measures. Improvements in
sanitation, sewage and hygiene have had a considerable impact in reducing
the incidence of many infectious diseases. Mass immunization against
infectious diseases, such as polio, has had enormous beneficial effects in
reducing disease in the population as a whole. Unfortunately the reduction in
infectious diseases has been accompanied by an increasing incidence of other
diseases, such as cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, several types of cancers
and psychiatric diseases. All are associated with aging and, to a certain extent,
this may reflect the increased life expectancy in the developed countries:
people are not killed by infectious diseases and live longer. Some evidence
does suggest that the increased incidence of these diseases is also due to
changes in diet such as increased consumption of saturated fats and other
lifestyle factors, for instance a lack of exercise. Intervention studies aimed at
changing diet and lifestyle factors in an attempt to reduce the incidence of
these diseases are already proving beneficial.
Socioeconomic factors can also influence the incidence of many diseases.
Poverty tends to be associated with an increased incidence of malnutrition
and malnourished individuals are more susceptible to infectious diseases.
Overcrowding is known to promote the spread of infectious diseases resulting
in epidemics.
Some diseases have a high incidence in populations associated with
certain occupations. For example, coal workers have a high incidence of
pneumoconiosis caused by inhalation of coal dust and, in the past, workers
with asbestos faced a high risk of asbestosis, and of developing mesothelioma
of the lung. Occupational hazards need to be identified and minimized to
reduce the incidence of these diseases.

1.5

INVESTIGATING DISEASES

For the majority of diseases, the clinical outcome is likely to be improved if
treatment is started at an early stage. Consequently the proper investigation
of disease is necessary to ensure a rapid and accurate diagnosis and to allow
appropriate treatment to be initiated as soon as possible. The procedure for
investigating a disease is outlined in Figure 1.8. It starts with the affected
person presenting symptoms and visiting his or her physician when feeling
unwell or after a period of ill health. The examination usually begins with the
clinician asking the patient about his or her current and past medical histories,
current and previous medications, use of alcohol and tobacco, any family
history of disease and possibly occupational history. This is usually followed
by a clinical examination to look for signs of any abnormality. This may
involve visual examinations of the skin, eyes, tongue, throat, nails and hair to
detect abnormalities together with tests to assess cardiovascular, respiratory,
gastrointestinal, genitourinary, nervous and musculoskeletal functions.
Since diseases typically present with recognizable signs and symptoms, the
clinician may make a diagnosis of the disease based on the clinical history
and the examination and then initiate treatment. Sometimes this may not be
possible, given that many clinical symptoms and signs are not specific to any

one disease. However, a range of diagnostic services is also available to the
clinician in modern health care systems. These include imaging techniques,
physiological function tests, radiographic examinations (X-rays) and pathology
laboratory investigations that can be applied to confirm, reject or distinguish
between the various provisional diagnoses. The clinician may only be able
to make a provisional diagnosis or a shortlist of possible diagnoses and then
request additional investigations that rely on the diagnostic services available
at the surgery, clinic or hospital.

1.6

TYPES OF PATHOLOGY LABORATORIES

The function of hospital pathology laboratories (Table 1.3) is to make scientific
investigations of disease. The typical pathology service offered by hospitals has
six main branches: medical microbiology, immunology, clinical biochemistry,
hematology, histopathology and clinical genetics.
Medical microbiology is concerned primarily with the detection and identification of pathogenic microorganisms. For clinical purposes, these consist of
viruses, bacteria, protozoa, fungi and helminths (worms). Microorganisms
are detected directly in specimens obtained from the patient or on swabs (for
example throat, nasal) that are cultured in growth medium to increase the
number of microorganisms and allow their easier detection. The presence of
microorganisms may also be determined indirectly by detecting antibodies
produced by the patient in response to the infection. Medical microbiology
laboratories also investigate the responses of pathogenic microorganisms to
antibiotics.
Immunology laboratories are concerned with studying the body‚Äôs immune
response in both healthy and diseased states. Immune responses are ‚Äòcellmediated‚Äô or ‚Äòhumoral‚Äô. The former involves T lymphocytes, the latter the
production of antibodies by specialized B lymphocytes. The presence or
absence of antibodies in plasma can be determined, for example, by serum
electrophoresis (Figure 1.9) to assess generalized immunodeficiencies and
other diseases. However, of more diagnostic value during the investigation

4 and 5) is produced in multiple myeloma, a
tumor of the B lymphocytes; the white blood
cells that produce immunoglobulins. The
proteins in samples of serum can be separated
by electrophoresis and stained with dye. Lane 1
shows the separated proteins from normal serum.
The most abundant protein is serum albumin
which shows as the strongly staining band near
the positive end. Lane 2 shows a myeloma serum
sample with a second dense band at the negative
end. This band shows the enormous amount of a
single type of immunoglobulin, produced by the
tumor. In multiple myeloma, the serum protein
concentration increases making the blood thick
and difÔ¨Åcult to pump around, putting a strain
on the heart and kidneys. In addition, so much
effort is put into synthesizing one type of useless
antibody that the concentration of other antibody
molecules decreases and patients become prone
to infection.

THE NATURE AND INVESTIGATION OF DISEASES

of immune diseases may be the measurement of specific antibodies that are
produced in response to a particular antigen (which may be an infectious
agent or an autoantigen). The number of cells involved in immunity, such as
T-cells, B-cells, T-helper and T-suppressor cells, are often determined as this
can provide valuable information about the immune status of an individual.

Clinical biochemistry is concerned with investigating the biochemical
changes associated with diseases. A wide range of substances or analytes are
measured in clinical biochemistry laboratories. Some of these analyses are
carried out routinely on all samples (blood, urine) coming into the laboratory
using automated methods (Figure 1.10); others need to be requested specially.
Analyses include those for proteins, enzymes, hormones, lipids, tumor
markers, blood gases, sugars and inorganic ions to investigate a variety
of disorders, including those associated with abnormal renal, respiratory,
metabolic, bone and endocrine function. In addition, analytes are measured
during investigations of genetic disorders both to diagnose and to monitor the
effectiveness of therapies.
Hematology is concerned with the study of disorders of blood cells, including
blood clotting (coagulation) defects. Hematological investigations can involve
determining the concentrations of blood proteins, such as hemoglobin, to aid
in the diagnosis of diseases. The microscopic examination of blood films, thin
layers of blood spread out on a microscope slide and stained (Figure 1.11) and
marrow removed from bone cavities by aspiration (Figure 1.12) may also be
helpful. Some hematology laboratories may also be involved in the provision
of blood and blood products for transfusion services, but these are often run
as separate services.
Histopathology is concerned with the investigation of disease by examining
cells and tissues. This involves the macro- and microscopic investigation
of body tissues for the identification of disease. Amongst other things,
histopathology laboratories are usually involved in the diagnosis of
malignancies and can also provide information on how far a tumor has
progressed (‚Äòstaging‚Äô) and therefore can suggest a likely prognosis. In addition,
histopathology laboratories may also assist with investigation of a range of
infectious and inflammatory conditions affecting body tissues.
Clinical genetics is a growing area in the investigation of diseases. A major focus
of clinical genetics laboratories is the identification of genetic abnormalities
(Chapter 15). This could include, for example, identifying the number and
form of chromosomes (Figure 1.13) in blood films to identify any numerical
and structural abnormalities.

ROLE OF HOSPITAL LABORATORY TESTS

Tests performed by the pathology laboratory can assist clinicians in
investigating disease. The tests may only give a subjective assessment,
such as when a pathologist assesses the types of cells obtained from a fine
needle aspirate of a suspected breast tumor when investigating breast
cancer. However, tests may provide quantitative information, such as the
concentration of thyroid hormones in the serum, that can then be compared
with a normal value. Unfortunately, the term normal is often difficult to
define in clinical terms. To alleviate this problem, reference ranges have
been widely adopted. Numerical reference limits are based on the mean
value plus or minus two standard deviations against which test results can
be compared. The uses of reference ranges are explored more thoroughly
later in the chapter. The term normal range is still used synonymously with
reference range.
In general, the roles of laboratory tests include:

the diagnosis, to identify the disease;

‚Ä¢

detection of complications.

The results of laboratory investigations are used in conjunction with the
patient‚Äôs clinical history and examination to determine the nature of the
disease affecting the patient. Thus a low value for the concentration of glucose
in the blood of a patient can confirm hypoglycemia and the clinician can
start palliative treatment, even though the cause of the hypoglycemia may be
unknown at this stage.

Laboratory tests may be used to detect a disease before it presents
clinically. This is referred to as screening. For example, the concentration
of phenylalanine in the serum of all newborn babies in the UK is measured
to detect phenylketonuria (Chapter 15). Affected children have a high
concentration of serum phenylalanine (hyperphenylalaninemia) and
metabolites of phenylalanine, such as phenylpyruvic acid are usually
present. If untreated, this condition leads to irreversible brain damage but
if caught early and treated by diet, individuals develop normally. Other
examples of screening tests include smears taken from the lining of the
uterine cervix (Margin Note 1.1 and Figure 1.15). Screening tests may also be

Glycated hemoglobin

Laboratory tests may be used to monitor the course of an illness or the effects
of its treatment. For example, the concentration of glycated hemoglobin
in erythrocytes is measured in diabetics on a regular basis. The higher the
concentration of glucose in the serum, the more readily the sugar reacts with
proteins in a nonenzymic reaction to form glycated hemoglobin, in which
sugar molecules are covalently attached to the protein. Thus the amount of
glycated hemoglobin is an indicator of average glycemia in such patients
over a period of days or months. Diabetics who are not complying with their
treatment by not taking their insulin regularly or giving themselves the wrong
dose, or whose treatment is ineffective, can be identified because poor control
of blood glucose gives rise to higher concentrations of glycated hemoglobin
than is normal or even found in well-controlled diabetics (Figure 1.14).

THE NATURE AND INVESTIGATION OF DISEASES

BOX 1.1 Clinical speciÔ¨Åcity and sensitivity
If a test for a particular disease gives a positive result in affected
patients, the result is referred to as a true positive (TP). However,
if a positive result is obtained in an individual who does not
have the disease, this is referred to as a false positive (FP). In
individuals without the disease, the test results should be a true
negative (TN) but occasionally a negative result is obtained in
a patient who has the disease and this is referred to as a false
negative (FN). The ability of a test to discriminate between diseased and healthy states is described by its clinical speciÔ¨Åcity and
sensitivity.
The speciÔ¨Åcity of a test is the measure of the incidence of negative results in individuals free of the disease, and deÔ¨Åned as:

ease and a positive result in all patients affected by the disease.
Such a test would discriminate completely between the diseased
and healthy states. Unfortunately, such perfection rarely occurs
and tests almost always have some degree of overlap (Figure
1.16(A)). Indeed, factors that increase the speciÔ¨Åcity of a test
often decrease its sensitivity and vice versa.
When using a clinical test, it should also be appreciated that its
ability to detect a disease is inÔ¨Çuenced by the prevalence of that
disease in the population being studied. This ability is described
by the predictive values of the test. The predictive value of a positive test is deÔ¨Åned as:
Predictive value of positive test = TP s 100 / TP + FP

SpeciÔ¨Åcity = TN s 100 / TN + FP
A test with a speciÔ¨Åcity of 90% means that, on average, 90 out
of 100 individuals without the disease would give a negative test.
Conversely, 10 of these individuals would give a positive result
even though they do not have any disease.

and of a negative test as:
Predictive value of negative test = TN s 100 / TN + FN

A test of 90% sensitivity means that, on average, 90% of individuals with the disease will give a positive test while the remaining 10% of individuals with the disease would give a negative
result.

The range of values obtained for any test in healthy individuals usually overlaps with those obtained from patients with the
disease. Hence, some patients who are genuinely ill will give test
results that imply they are healthy (FN), whereas others who are
not ill appear to have the disease (FP). However, if extreme values
are used in the test for comparison, then the number of FN results
will be reduced or eliminated. The method will, however, detect
more FP results (Figure 1.16(B)). Thus the test will have a high
speciÔ¨Åcity but low sensitivity. If the cut-off value is reduced, then
the number of FP results would be reduced but at the expense
of increasing the number of FN results. Thus the test has a high
sensitivity but only by decreasing its speciÔ¨Åcity (Figure 1.16(C)).

Ideally, a test should have 100% speciÔ¨Åcity and sensitivity, that
is, it should give a negative result in all individuals without dis-

Whether the sensitivity or the speciÔ¨Åcity of a test should be
increased depends on the disease under investigation and the

The sensitivity of a clinical test is a measure of the incidence of
positive results in individuals affected by the disease. Sensitivity
can be expressed as:
Sensitivity = TP s 100 / TP + FN

Physicians have to be very careful when interpreting the results

consequences of making an incorrect diagnosis. Thus when
screening for a disease with severe or fatal consequences, the
test must have a high sensitivity. This ensures it will detect all
results that are TP although some FP results will also be detected.
Patients with positive results can then be investigated further to
identify those with FP results. This test should also have a high
predictive value for a negative test so that affected individuals
are not missed when screening for the condition. Conversely, in
some circumstances, it might be more important to have a test
with high speciÔ¨Åcity. For example, if the purpose of the test is to
identify and select patients for treatment with a new drug then
it is necessary that the test has a high speciÔ¨Åcity. This will ensure
that individuals without the disease are not selected and treated.
This type of test should have a high predictive value for a positive
result so that number of individuals with FP results are minimized
and not subjected to any unnecessary treatment.

Laboratory tests can be used to indicate the risk of developing a disease. The risk
of developing coronary artery disease increases with increasing concentration
of blood cholesterol, more so if other risk factors, such as smoking, obesity or
diabetes, are present.
Tests in pathology laboratories can indicate the likely outcome of a disease.
Renal failure (Chapter 8) is a progressive disease that leads to a gradual build
up of creatinine in the serum (Figure 1.17). Measurements of serum creatinine
may therefore indicate end-stage renal disease when the patient may need
dialysis to survive.
Vital information regarding the development and complications in a particular
disease may be provided by laboratory tests. Urine is normally essentially free
of protein; hence the presence of 30 to 200 mg dm‚Äì3 of serum albumin in the
urine (microalbuminuria) of diabetic patients may indicate the development
of nephropathy, a common secondary complication of diabetes.

Cervical smear (Figure 1.15) testing is
a screening that looks for abnormal
changes in cells of the cervix, that is
the neck of the uterus (Chapter 17).
Some of these abnormal cells can
develop into cancer over 10 or more
years. The commonest cervical cancer,
squamous cell carcinoma, is largely
preventable given that treatment of
the abnormal cells will remove them
in more than 90% of cases although
occasionally further treatment may
be needed. However, no screening is
100% reliable and some abnormalities
may go undetected, hence the
importance of regular tests every three
years if screening is to be effective in
preventing cancer. The development

HOSPITAL LABORATORY TESTS

Hospital laboratories routinely offer a wide range of clinical tests all of
which must undergo a thorough evaluation for both analytical and clinical
performance. The clinical demand for the test has to be established and its
clinical relevance is subject to review. In addition to thorough evaluation of
analytical methods, other aspects, such as the stability of samples, needs to be
considered. For example, some samples must be assayed immediately while
others can be stored at an appropriate temperature. All laboratory staff must
be appropriately trained to ensure high analytical standards and produce
valid data. This usually means that control urine and sera are run through the
analyzers at regular intervals to check that the methods are working properly
and reproducibly. Many of the companies that supply apparatus and reagents
also supply standard sera for example, which are tested in laboratories all
over the country, and the results are recorded in a nationwide database so
that comparisons can be made and laboratories can check that their methods
are all giving the same results.
Figure 1.18 illustrates the overall procedure routinely followed when a clinician
requires a hospital test. Note that this procedure can be divided into a number
of distinct steps:
‚Ä¢

request for the test ( a form; patient‚Äôs details recorded);

‚Ä¢

specimen collection, labeling, transport and storage (instructions);

‚Ä¢

analysis (obtaining the results);

interpretation (the results are often printed out with the range of values to
help the doctor make an interpretation).

Prior to any test being requested, careful thought should be given as to
whether the test is necessary and how its results will affect the management
of the disease for the benefit of the patient. If this is not the case, then one has
to consider the value in requesting and performing the test. Unfortunately
clinicians sometimes request clinical tests that are unnecessary and will not
be of benefit in treating the patient. This problem often occurs when using
forms on which tests can be requested simply by ticking a box. Requesting
unnecessary tests poses a number of problems for the patients, clinicians,
the biomedical scientists (medical technologists in the USA) and the
hospital. The test means that the patient is put to an inconvenience, as extra
specimens are required. Unnecessary tests can be misleading and result in
poor patient management while imposing a financial burden on the hospital.
The increased workload for laboratory scientific staff may make the clinician
in question rather unpopular! However, set against this is the fact that many
of the machines used in the hospital for clinical analysis routinely test for
a number of analytes, whether they are asked to or not, since it is easier to
set up the machine in this way rather than to adjust them for individual
patients.
Specimens are collected in a variety of ways (Figure 1.19) from the collection
of blood using a simple thumbprick or, more usually a syringe, to surgery to
obtain a biopsy, where a small piece of tissue is taken from the patient.
Blood needs to be collected with care (Chapter 13). If too many erythrocytes
burst, this is known as hemolysis; the specimen will be unsuitable for the
determination of some analytes: for example, the value obtained for ‚Äòserum
K+‚Äô will not be a true value since potassium is released from hemolyzed blood
cells. Blood should not be collected from an arm that is receiving an infusion
as a drip, since this will dilute the blood. Often, in such cases, the measured
concentrations of electrolytes and glucose in the blood samples resemble
those of the infusion fluid.

HOSPITAL LABORATORY TESTS

For some analytes, the blood must be collected into a tube containing an
anticoagulant or preservative. Specimens of blood for glucose determination
must be collected into a tube containing fluoride ions (F‚Äì) since this inhibits
glycolysis and prevents the utilization of serum glucose by blood cells.
Occasionally blood is collected into the wrong tube and then decanted into
the correct tube. This can cause a number of problems. For example, blood
collected into a tube containing ethylene diamine tetraacetate (EDTA) will be
unsuitable for the determination of serum Ca2+, since EDTA is an anticoagulant,
works by chelating and removing available Ca2+.
The transport of specimens and their storage must be considered carefully
since an inappropriate environment can influence the values of clinical test
results. Swabs, for example, obtained during a microbiological investigation
of an affected site, contain only a small volume of specimen and dry easily.
They therefore need to be transported to the laboratory as quickly as possible

Margin Note 1.2 Mean, standard
i
deviation and coefÔ¨Åcient of
variance
_
The mean (x) is the arithmetic
average value of a particular group of
measurements. It can be calculated
from:
_
x = 3x/n
where n is the number of individual
measurements and 3 is the total of
individual values (x).
The standard deviation (SD) is a
measure of the dispersion of the
data. This is deÔ¨Åned
as the square
_
root of 3 (x‚Äìx)2 / n‚Äì1. Hence the
smaller the value of the SD relative to
that of the mean, the less dispersed
the data. It can
_ be seen from Figure
1.20 that the x ¬± SD include
_ about
68% of the samples, the x ¬± 2SD will
include approximately 95% of the
samples.
The coefÔ¨Åcient of variance (cv) is also
a measure of_ dispersion. It is related
to both the x and SD:
_
cv = 100.SD / x

to preserve the pathogens. Blood specimens that have been stored overnight
may show erroneously high concentrations of serum K+, phosphate and
activities of erythrocyte enzymes because these all leak from the cells during
storage. To prevent this happening, the serum should be separated from
blood cells immediately following collection and stored separately if it is to
be analyzed the following day.
Certain samples require a timed collection, for example, the collection of
urine specimens over a 24-hour period for determination of creatinine
clearance values (Chapter 8) or the collection of stools over a three-day period
for fecal fat determination to assess malabsorption (Chapter 11). The results
obtained for such tests often lack accuracy because of the practical difficulties
in obtaining accurately timed specimens from the patient.

1.9

EVALUATION OF LABORATORY TESTS

The clinical tests used in hospital laboratories undergo thorough evaluation
prior to usage in a laboratory. A number of factors are assessed including
accuracy, precision, reliability, practicality, safety, ease of use, duration and
cost.
Accuracy refers to the ability of a method to give results that are close to the
true value of the substance (analyte) being measured. The results obtained
from laboratory tests may be based on subjective assessment as, for example,
following the microscopic examination of a tissue section obtained after
biopsy during the investigation of a possible malignancy. These types of
assessments rely heavily on the experience of the practitioner in recognizing
and identifying key changes. Many tests, however, provide quantitative data
such as blood glucose concentrations in diabetics, or the concentration of
thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) in the serum of a patient with suspected
hypothyroidism. The interpretation of many clinical tests for analytes requires
referral to its reference range (see Section 1.9).
The precision of a method refers to its ability to provide the same result every
time it is used. Precision is assessed by repeatedly measuring samples taken
from a single specimen and from batches of samples. The variation in the
results may be assessed by calculating statistical parameters, such as standard
deviation (SD) or coefficient of variance (cv).

Frequency

Since both the mean and standard
deviation have the same units,
the coefÔ¨Åcient of variance is a
percentage; the lower its value the
lower the dispersion.

REFERENCE RANGES

Often substances in biological materials are present in extremely low
concentrations and it may be necessary for the clinical test to detect such low
concentrations of analyte and, indeed, monitor changes in its concentration.
The analytical sensitivity of a method is its ability to detect small amounts of
the analyte under investigation. A related term is the limit of detection, which
is the smallest amount of a substance that can be distinguished from the zero
value. Biological material contains many components and some of these may
interfere with the test being used, giving rise to unreliable results. For this
reason, the analytical specificity of a test, that is, the ability of the method to
detect only the test substance, may be determined.
In addition to analytical variation, test results are subject to biological
variation. The discrimination between normal and abnormal results can be
influenced by a number of biological factors. These include the sex and age
of the patient, his or her diet, the time of collecting the sample, the posture
adopted, whether the patient is stressed or had been exercising, the menstrual
state of a female patient and whether she is pregnant, whether the person is
taking drugs (legal or illegal). All these influence the results of the test. Thus,
for example, plasma iron and urate values are higher in male than female
patients; the activity of serum alkaline phosphatase is greater in growing
children than in adults. Variations in diet may affect concentration of certain
analytes, such as cholesterol (Figure 1.21). The values of some analytes, such
as the concentration of cortisol in the plasma, show a diurnal variation. Blood
should be collected from a seated patient since differences in posture at the
time of blood collection can influence the concentrations of a number of
analytes including the concentration of plasma proteins. Stress influences the
release of a number of hormones, such as adrenaline and cortisol, while the
concentrations of serum analytes, like creatine kinase and lactate, increase
following exercise. The concentrations of ovarian hormones are strongly
influenced by the menstrual cycle and corticosterone is known to vary by as
much as 50% during different stages of the cycle. The nature and concentrations
of many hormones change during pregnancy. Lastly, some drugs can influence
results. For example, patients on estrogen-containing oral contraceptives
often have an increased concentration of total plasma protein.
Analytical methods need to satisfy certain criteria to ensure they are practical
and suitable for use in the laboratory. New methods are introduced into the
laboratory only if they offer significant advantages over existing methods. New
methods are assessed for their speed, that is, how many specimens can be
processed in a given time and how long it takes to produce a result. The time
a test takes may, of course, be vitally important in the care and treatment of a
patient when urgent intervention is necessary.
Hospital laboratories have witnessed an increasing workload in recent years,
and although they are helped by automation (Figure 1.10), they process very
large numbers of specimens on a daily basis. Like all organizations, they have
a finite budget and it is vital that the cost of tests is kept to a minimum. As
well as direct costs, such as those for reagents, equipment and labor, there are
indirect costs, such as the heating and lighting of laboratories. Safety is also
of importance and biological, chemical, mechanical and electrical hazards
associated with the method need to be assessed to ensure the safety of hospital
laboratory staff.

1.10 REFERENCE RANGES
Reference ranges were mentioned earlier (Section 1.7). The reference range for
any particular analyte can be obtained by measuring it in healthy individuals
from a representative sample of the local population. Most laboratories
use healthy blood donors. It may be important to know the normal range

THE NATURE AND INVESTIGATION OF DISEASES

in adults, children, males, females, particular ethnic groups, or pregnant
or postmenopausal women. However, since no analytical method is 100%
accurate and since individuals vary, care must be taken when establishing a
reference range. To determine the reference range, the values for the measured
analyte are plotted against their frequency in the selected population. In most
cases, the resultant graph shows a normal or Gaussian distribution with_ most
values clustered around the center as seen in Figure 1.20. The mean ( x ) and
standard deviation (SD) can be determined from these data.
In general, the reference range is taken to be between two standard deviations
either side of the mean. This will cover 95% of the values obtained for the
selected sample (provided the curve is Gaussian). The 95% reference range
was selected as this minimizes any overlap between the results for a healthy
population and those for a population with the disease. However, choosing
a 95% range is one of the major limitations of reference ranges, since 5% of
healthy individuals will, by definition, give results that are outside these values.
Thus a test result outside the reference range does not necessarily imply that
the individual is ill although it does indicate that there is a greater likelihood
of the presence of disease.
The profile of test results for some substances, for example serum bilirubin,
does not give a Gaussian curve but shows a skewed distribution. This skewed
distribution can be transformed mathematically to a Gaussian distribution
and a normalized reference range calculated.
The values of a number of analytes, such as serum iron and alkaline
phosphatase vary with the age or sex of the patient. In such cases, age- and
sex-matched reference ranges are required. When interpreting results for a
particular patient, the ideal reference value would be obtained from the same
patient before their illness and this is sometimes possible. For example, the
concentrations of electrolytes in serum can be measured in a patient before
an operation for comparison with those obtained postoperatively. However, in
most cases the results for the patient before they became ill are not available.

1.11 QUALITY OF TEST RESULTS AND CLINICAL AUDITING
Margin Note 1.3 False negatives
and false positives

i

It is clear that false negative or false
positive results from a test can have
serious consequences (and no test
is 100% reliable). This applies even
more to tests that patients can carry
out at home. One can imagine the
anguish or joy that a false positive in
a pregnancy test might cause. The
recent development of a quick home
test for HIV based on a saliva test is
perhaps a more severe example. This
HIV test, approved in the US, has
raised fears that people who Ô¨Ånd that
they are infected (or obtain a positive
result) may kill themselves.

&-

The results of tests performed in pathology laboratories assist with diagnosis
of disease or the monitoring of treatment. Thus they can greatly influence the
management of patients, and it is essential to assure the quality of laboratory
results. Erroneous results have the potential to cause considerable harm (both
physical and psychological) to patients and must be avoided. All laboratories
have practices and procedures to ensure erroneous results are minimized
and that good quality results are provided. Errors can arise at the three
different stages of analysis, that is, preanalytical, analytical and postanalytical.
Preanalytical errors occur before the sample has been analyzed. Analytical
errors arise during the laboratory testing procedure. Postanalytical errors
arise after the specimen has been analyzed.
In general, preanalytical mistakes result from inappropriate methods
of collection or incorrect labeling, handling, transport or storage of the
specimen. Experimental mistakes that can give rise to analytical errors are
detected by introducing systems for each clinical test to warn when errors
occur. This is normally achieved by analyzing a control sample within each
batch of tests. A control sample is one that is identical in composition to the
test samples except that it contains a known concentration of the test analyte.
All samples, including the control sample, must be treated identically. For
example, if the concentration of glucose in serum is being determined, then
the control should be serum, not water, containing a known concentration of
glucose.

W^dad\nd[Y^hZVhZ

QUALITY OF TEST RESULTS AND CLINICAL AUDITING

The control sample is usually an aliquot from a larger sample for which the
mean and standard deviation have already been determined. The results
for control samples are usually recorded graphically so that changes in the
quality of the method are detected as soon as they arise. A common chart
used for quality control purposes is the Levey-Jennings chart (Figure 1.22)
in which the control limits are set at the mean ¬± 2 SD and ¬± 3 SD. If the
control values fall outside the ¬± 2 SD limit, that is, there is drift away from the
accepted limits, there is only a 5% probability that the result lies in a normal
distribution around the mean and is still valid. Any results that lie outside
the 3 SD warning limit suggests that a problem is occurring with the method.
Problems could include unstable reagents in the analyzer, problems with
temperature control or contamination, all of which require investigation.
Occasionally there are gross (and usually very obvious) inaccuracies in the
value of a test result such that it bears no resemblance to values seen in health
or disease. These are referred to as ‚Äòblunders‚Äô. Blunders usually arise because
of transcriptional errors in reporting the result. To reduce the number of
blunders, results should be checked thoroughly by senior staff before being
sent to clinicians.

quality control of quantitative results of tests.
The values of controls are plotted as means ¬± 2
and 3 SD. When results are plotted out like
this, any trend affecting quality of test can be
detected, for example the values for one control
(red) lie outside ¬± 3 SD. Courtesy of Department of
Clinical Biochemistry, Manchester Royal InÔ¨Årmary, UK.

Most laboratories have their own quality control samples and these are used
for internal quality assurance purposes. Many countries now participate
in external quality assurance, whereby quality control samples are sent
to participating laboratories from a central source to assess the analytical
performance of their methods for particular analytes. Furthermore, to ensure
quality of service provision, many laboratories follow a set of procedures
required for accreditation by external agencies. These procedures ensure
good laboratory practice (GLP) and cover all aspects of the laboratory that
are involved in the production of test results. These procedures ensure that all
laboratory staff are adequately trained and have clearly defined responsibilities.
The equipment used should be of adequate standard with a logbook showing
a full record of maintenance and faults. All methods used in the laboratory are
standardized, fully documented and appropriate for the analysis. Full details
of each method are provided as a standard operating procedure (SOP) that
includes details of specimen handling, the analytical method, equipment
used and quality control procedures.
To improve the quality of the services they provide, many laboratories
participate in some form of audit. Clinical audit (Figure 1.23) is a process
whereby practices and procedures involved in patient care are monitored and,
if necessary, revised to provide a more efficient and cost-effective service that
should ultimately benefit the patient. Audit is part of the process of ensuring

quality and is usually divided into five stages. The first is the observation and
review of current practice and procedures in the laboratory. The second stage
involves the identification of areas of concern that could be improved and
questions are asked as to whether the current service can be provided more
economically. Third, a series of changes are devised to rectify and improve
the identified area(s) of concern. Fourth, these changes are implemented and
steps taken to ensure compliance and, finally, at the fifth stage, the changes
are monitored and compared with previous procedures in order to assess
whether there is indeed any improvement in the service provided or whether
the revised procedures are actually more cost effective.
A clinical audit is usually followed by a re-audit after an appropriate period
of time. The audit may include several processes such as the initial stages of
test requesting, specimen collection and transport. The audit may wish to
investigate whether appropriate advice is available to clinicians requesting
tests, whether the test request forms are easy to use or whether appropriate
containers are provided for specimen collection. Other types of audit processes
may relate to the analytical service provided by the laboratory, such as whether
the repertoire of tests offered is appropriate to the needs of the clinical service.
A clinical audit may wish to investigate whether provision of the laboratory
service out of hours is efficient and cost-effective and whether test results are
being returned to the clinicians at the right place and within an appropriate
time.

1.12 SUMMARY
Health is a ‚Äòstate of physical, mental and social well-being, not merely the
absence of disease‚Äô. Disease refers to any abnormality or failure of the body
to function properly. For medical treatment to commence the disease needs
to be diagnosed and its etiology established. This also helps to define the
prognosis, that is, the likely course of the disease and its outcome. Diseases
have a number of possible causes. They may be exogenous, such as infections
or trauma (accidents) or they may be endogenous such as diabetes or cancer.
Some diseases may be caused by a range of factors and are called multifactorial
and, for some, the cause may be unknown and these are referred to as
idiopathic.
The pathogenesis describes how the etiological agent produces the clinical
signs and symptoms and the pathological changes characteristic of that disease.
This enables the physician to make a diagnosis and prescribe treatment. The
prognosis should also emerge at this stage.
Diseases may be classified into a number of types: genetic, infectious,
endocrine, traumatic, degenerative, immunological, nutritional, homeostatic,
neoplastic (cancer), toxic, psychogenic and iatrogenic (caused by the treatment
itself). Epidemiology is the study of how diseases spread in populations. This
is of importance in the control of diseases.
Various types of laboratories specialize in investigating the pathology of
diseases. A laboratory may measure the concentrations of analytes in blood
and urine, identify infectious agents such as bacteria and viruses, characterize
genetic diseases by looking at the patient‚Äôs chromosomes, or identify problems
with the blood, for example those involving defective hemoglobin or clotting
factors. The laboratories report their findings to the clinician in charge of
the patient to help in the process of diagnosis and in making decisions on
treatment and how well any treatment is working. Pathology laboratories
must work to high standards of accuracy, otherwise wrong treatments may be
given and patients may be misinformed about their disease and its prognosis.
Therefore pathology laboratories take steps to standardize and check their
procedures on a daily basis and investigate new tests exhaustively before they
are introduced.

outline the types and effects of microbial virulence factors.

2.1

INTRODUCTION

The body is exposed to many pathogenic microorganisms and multicellular
parasites. Most microorganisms found associated with the body are harmless
and live as commensals or symbionts but others cause disease and are known
as pathogens. Infection, from the Latin ‚Äòinficere‚Äô (to put in), is the successful
persistence and/or multiplication of the pathogen on or within the host. In
this respect, pathogenesis may be defined as the molecular and biochemical
mechanisms that allow pathogens to cause diseases. Mummies preserved in
ancient Egypt and elsewhere display evidence that infectious diseases have
always been a threat. The emergence of new pathogens and the development
of resistance to current treatments for existing pathogens means that infectious
diseases will probably always be with us.
Many antibiotic drugs (Chapter 3) are available to treat infectious diseases and,
in many cases, will effect a cure. It is, however, possible for them to exacerbate the
problem since the drug can remove commensals allowing antibiotic resistant
pathogens to flourish. Also, an adequate immune response is often necessary,
since drugs alone may fail to eliminate the infection. Thus all pathogens must
overcome the defense systems present in their hosts (Chapter 4).
Some pathogens regularly cause diseases while others do not. For example,
Pseudomonas aeruginosa (Figure 2.1) can cause overwhelming disease in
patients whose defense systems are compromized but not in those with
intact defenses. It is likely that any microorganism with the ability to live in
or on humans will sometimes become an opportunistic pathogen especially
if the balance between the usual microorganisms present and the immune

Prevention, USA.

PATHOGENS AND VIRULENCE

system is disturbed. Thus bacteria which are normally harmless, but which
are opportunistic pathogens, can cause infections under certain conditions.
For example, wounds can become badly infected with bacteria that normally
exist on the skin, and bacteria that normally live in the gut can cause serious
infections if peritonitis (Chapter 11) allows the gut contents to enter the
peritoneum. In general, these infections are not transferable to other healthy
humans.
The success of pathogenic microorganisms depends on their ability to
colonize host tissues and to counter the host‚Äôs defense mechanisms. Virulence
is measured by the infective dose and the severity of the disease caused. For
example, as few as 10 to 100 Shigella dysenteriae cells can cause shigellosis but
more than 10 000 cells are needed of the less virulent salmonella or cholera
bacteria. True pathogens are equipped with a range of virulence factors. The
strains of some bacterial species, such as pathogenic forms of Escherichia coli
(Figure 2.2) can produce different virulence factors that cause, for example,
diarrhea, urinary tract infections or sepsis. Other strains, however, do not
produce virulence factors or do so to a lesser extent and are therefore not
pathogenic, except when they infect an immunocompromized host.
A pathogen must be transmitted from a source to the patient. Direct contact
between hosts is the most obvious form of transmission but coughs and
sneezes (aerosols), food, water and arthropod vectors are all used by various
pathogens. The long-term survival of pathogenic microorganisms also
depends on maintaining their infectivity during transmission from host
to host. Diseases that are transmitted from animals to humans are called
zoonoses, while humans who harbor a pathogen but are asymptomatic are
called carriers.

Margin Note 2.1
Communicable pathogens are
transmitted from host to host
and, in general, cannot live for
extended periods outside a host.
Noncommunicable pathogens
normally live in the abiotic environment but may infect a host if
they are transmitted to him or her.
Contagious pathogens are those
that are easily transmitted. The
sources of pathogens can be abiotic: soil, water, or animals or other
humans.

2.2

TYPES OF PATHOGENS

Infectious diseases are caused by pathogens that have the ability to infect
humans. They may be subcellular, such as prions and viruses, single-celled
prokaryotic bacteria, single-celled eukaryotic protozoa and yeasts, or
multicellular organisms such as, fungi, certain worms, such as nematodes
and flukes (generally referred to as helminths) and arthropods, such as mites.
The term parasite, an organism that lives at the expense of another, is often
applied to viruses, protozoa and helminths, although the terms pathogen and
parasite are virtually interchangeable.

PRIONS
Spongiform encephalopathies or prion diseases (Chapter 15) are all fatal
diseases for which there is no cure. They include Creutzfeldt-Jacob disease
(CJD), Gerstmann-Str√§ussler-Scheinker syndrome (GSS) and fatal familial
insomnia (FFI). These diseases generally develop slowly over 10 to 20 years
in older individuals. Prion diseases occur sporadically, or they can be familial,
that is genetic, or they can be acquired, that is, infectious.
Prions are degenerate host proteins. The normal form of the protein adopts a
largely A helical conformation that is harmless, but can refold to a B sheet-rich
form that is a pathological conformation. Such misfolded proteins aggregate
to form deposits in the brain leading to a lethal spongiform condition
where holes develop in the brain. A misfolded prion protein, in some poorly
understood way, induces a conformational change in a native A prion protein
to produce a B type conformation. This new misfolded protein, in turn, can
catalyze conformational changes in other native proteins, eventually forming
a chain reaction and produces deposits of prions in the brain. The sporadic
form of the disease occurs in individuals with mutations in the prion gene
that predisposes them to produce the misfolded form of the protein. Since

the diseases usually only occur after reproductive life is over, they can run
in families giving the familial form. If misfolded prions enter the body in the
diet, they resist digestion. They may also enter by iatrogenic means, through
surgery or blood transfusions for instance, and can initiate the infectious form
of the disease.

VIRUSES
Viruses are obligate intracellular parasites. They are complexes of proteins,
which form a capsid, and nucleic acid (RNA or DNA), comprising their
genome, that together form a viral particle or virion (Figure 2.3). Some viral
particles also have a lipid membrane or envelope acquired when the viral
particle leaves its host cell (Figures 1.4 and 2.7). Viruses must enter a target
or host cell to replicate. They bind to the target cell by attaching to specific
proteins or carbohydrates on the cell‚Äôs surface (Figure 2.4). For example, the
human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) attaches to a protein called CD4 found
on the surfaces of certain T lymphocytes and macrophages of the immune
system (Chapter 4). Other examples of viruses and the cellular receptors to
which they bind are shown in Table 2.1.

Figure 2.3 Schematic showing the structure of a
typical viral particle.

Once infected, the host cell then manufactures new viral particles. In some
cases, replication may include an inactive latent state. For example, the virus
Varicella zoster (Figure 2.5), which causes chicken pox, enters nerve cells and,
after the initial infection, remains dormant. If, however, the host immune
system becomes weakened, Varicella can reactivate and cause painful attacks
of shingles in the area served by that nerve.
In some cases the viral nucleic acid can be integrated into that of the host
and eventually lead to cell transformation and the formation of cancers
(Chapter 17). Thus, for example, hepatitis B virus can contribute to primary
hepatocellular carcinoma, while certain strains of the human papillomavirus
that cause genital warts may contribute to the development of cervical
carcinoma.

PATHOGENS AND VIRULENCE

BOX 2.1 Infectious diseases in history
The earliest human skeletons show evidence of a variety of
infectious diseases. Evidence from mummies preserved in ancient
Egypt 4000 years ago shows that the population suffered from
diseases such as tuberculosis, trachoma and dental caries. The
skeletons of monks buried in medieval Northern monasteries
show the characteristic signs of syphilis!
Perhaps the best known example of an infectious disease is
plague, a term originally applied to any widespread disease
causing great mortality. The name is now conÔ¨Åned to bubonic
plague, an infectious disease of animals and humans caused by
the bacterium Yersinia pestis (Figure 2.6). This bacterium mainly
affects rodents but their Ô¨Çeas can transmit the bubonic form
of the disease to humans when they bite to feed on blood.
Transmission occurs readily in crowded urban areas with poor
hygiene. Infection usually results from a bite from a rodent
Ô¨Çea carrying the plague bacterium or by handling an infected
animal. Once humans are infected, they infect others very
rapidly. Plague causes fever and painful swellings of the lymph
glands called buboes, which is how the disease derives its name.
It also causes spots on the skin that are initially red but then
turn black. The coughing and sneezing of infected individuals
spreads pneumonic plague; a much more lethal form of the
disease. Bubonic plague is fatal in about 30% of cases but is
readily treatable with antibiotics. In contrast, pneumonic plague
is often fatal even with antibiotic therapy.
Bubonic plague has had a profound impact on humans
throughout recorded history. In AD 541, the Ô¨Årst great plague
pandemic, that is a disease affecting patients over a wide
geographical area, spread throughout the world from its
origins in Egypt. It is thought to have killed between 50% and
60% of the population over four years, being spread by the
Ô¨Çea-infested rats that inhabited human homes and workplaces
and by human sufferers of the disease. In the early 1330s, a
second pandemic originated in China. At the time China was
one of the world‚Äôs busiest trading nations and the disease
rapidly spread to western Asia, the Middle East and Europe. It
entered Europe in October 1347 when several Italian merchant
ships, returning from a trip to the Black Sea (a key link in trade
with China) arrived in Sicily with many people on board already
dying of plague. Within days the disease spread to the city and
the surrounding countryside. In August the following year, the
plague had spread as far north as England, where people called
it the Black Death because of the black spots on the skins
of patients. Medieval medicine was ineffective in treating the
disease. However, in winter the disease declined simply because
the Ô¨Çeas that carried the bacteria were dormant. Each spring,
the plague returned. After Ô¨Åve years more than 13 million
people in China and 20‚Äì30 million in Europe, one third of the
European population, were dead.

East Journal of Emergency Medicine and Dr M.
Schneider, Kryptozoologie respectively.

In addition to the terrible fatalities, the Black Death produced
enormous social changes from which medieval society never
recovered. The resulting serious labor shortages all over Europe
led to a demand for higher wages by workers and peasant revolts
broke out in Belgium, England, France and Italy. The end of the
1300s saw the eventual collapse of the prevailing social system
of tied serfs.
Even when the Black Death pandemic ended, smaller outbreaks
of bubonic plague continued for centuries. The Great Plague
of London in 1664 to 1666 is estimated to have killed 70 000
people out of a total population of 460 000. In 1894, outbreaks
occurred in Canton and Hong Kong in which 80 000 to 100 000
died. Within 20 years the plague had spread and killed 10 million
people worldwide.
Advances in living conditions, public health and antibiotic therapy
make future pandemics of Yersinia pestis unlikely. However, if an
infected person is not treated promptly, the disease is likely to
cause severe illness or death. Outbreaks of plague still occur in
some rural communities or in some cities that are still associated
with infected rats and their Ô¨Çeas. The World Health Organization
reports 1000 to 3000 cases of plague annually. It is unlikely that
the disease will ever be completely eradicated because wild
animals hold a huge reservoir of the bacterium.

W^dad\nd[Y^hZVhZ

TYPES OF PATHOGENS

In more recent years, pandemics of a number of other diseases
have occurred. The most recent is associated with the human
immunodeÔ¨Åciency virus (HIV) virus (Figures 1.4 and 2.7 and
Chapter 4), although the most numerous are associated with
inÔ¨Çuenza (Figure 2.8). The inÔ¨Çuenza pandemic of 1918‚Äì1919,
named Spanish Flu though the name has little relevance, killed up
to 40 million people, many more than the nine million fatalities
of World War 1 (WW1). It was one of the most devastating
epidemics in history and is comparable with the Black Death
in sheer numbers of people killed. In two years, a Ô¨Åfth of the
world‚Äôs population was infected. The virus had a mortality rate
of 2.5% compared with the previous inÔ¨Çuenza epidemics of less
than 0.1%. Further, most deaths were of people aged 20 to 40
years, which is unusual given that inÔ¨Çuenza normally kills the
elderly and the very young. Indeed, the death rate for 15- to 34year-olds from the inÔ¨Çuenza and associated pneumonia were 20
times higher in 1918 than in previous years.
The origin of this inÔ¨Çuenza variant is uncertain but is thought to
have originated in China where mutations led to an inÔ¨Çuenza virus
with novel surface proteins making it relatively unrecognizable to
immune defense. The inÔ¨Çuenza pandemic swiftly followed trade
routes and shipping lines. The mass movement of people as a
result of WW1 also enabled the virus to spread rapidly. Outbreaks
swept through North America, Europe, Asia, Africa, Brazil and
the South PaciÔ¨Åc. The shortage of medical facilities created by
WW1 accentuated problems. As with the Black Death, social
problems occurred with shortages of cofÔ¨Åns, morticians and
gravediggers so that bodies had to be stored in piles until they
could be buried.
The genes of all inÔ¨Çuenza viruses are maintained in wild aquatic
birds. Periodically these viruses are transmitted to other species.
Thus the potential for outbreaks of inÔ¨Çuenza is still present.
InÔ¨Çuenza viruses mutate constantly but usually in such a way
that one year‚Äôs vaccine offers some protection against the next
year‚Äôs strain. However, every 10 to 20 years, a major mutation
produces a particularly new virulent strain against which current
vaccines offer little protection. Such viruses are associated with
epidemics and pandemics like that of 1918 to 1919. Indeed, in
1997 epidemiologists and public health ofÔ¨Åcials recognized a
new variety of inÔ¨Çuenza virus, known as subtype H5N1 from its
surface proteins. Given its lethal effects on poultry it was called
Chicken Ebola, but is now more commonly called 'bird Ô¨Çu'. When
it infected the human population of Hong Kong it killed six of the
Ô¨Årst 18 conÔ¨Årmed cases. Fortunately the H5N1 subtype cannot
be transmitted through the air from one human host to another.
In Hong Kong, bird-to-human contact is relatively easy given the
often close proximity of the two and is believed to have been
the route of transmission and Hong Kong ofÔ¨Åcials ordered the
slaughter of Hong Kong‚Äôs entire poultry population in 1997.
However, by 2005/6, cases of bird Ô¨Çu were being reported in
diverse parts of the world.

PATHOGENS AND VIRULENCE

BACTERIA
Bacteria are cellular microorganisms that do not have a discrete nucleus and are
described as prokaryotic (Figure 2.9). They are responsible for a large proportion
of all infectious diseases and although prokaryotes share considerable
biochemistry with eukaryotes, their metabolism differs in numerous ways,
making them susceptible to chemical agents that do not significantly damage
human cells. This is the basis of antibiotic therapy (Chapter 3). While most
species of pathogenic bacteria do not enter host cells and are described as
extracellular pathogens, some significant groups of bacteria are intracellular
parasites. Examples of the latter include Mycobacteria and Listeria.

PROTOZOA, FUNGI AND HELMINTHS
Protozoa, fungi and helminths are eukaryotic organisms. They therefore share
many biochemical features with humans. Also, they have many seemingly
sophisticated ways of countering the host immune system. This often makes
them difficult to eradicate when they cause disease. Fungi, protozoa and
helminth parasites are responsible for a large proportion of infective diseases,
particularly in the developing world.
Protozoa consist of single eukaryotic cells although in some species these may
group together as loose aggregates. Malaria, caused by species of Plasmodium,
is easily the most clinically important protozoal infection worldwide and
is responsible for many millions of deaths annually (Box 2.2). Protozoa are,
however, also the causative agents for a number of other infections including
amebiasis, giardiasis, leishmaniasis, toxoplasmosis, trichomoniasis and
trypanosomiasis.
Fungi are a heterogeneous group of organisms, ranging from unicellular
yeasts to elongated chains of cells, known as hyphae (Figure 2.10). Fungal
infections, or mycoses, are relatively common and may be superficial or
systemic. Fungi cause disease in humans by invading tissues, by being toxic
or by initiating an allergic response. Clinically important fungal infections
include those of Epidermophyton, Microsporum and Trichophyton species
that cause ringworm, athlete‚Äôs foot and nail infections (Figure 2.11).
Infections with yeasts and other fungi can result in, for example, candidiasis,

aspergillosis and cryptococcosis. Systemic fungal infections are, in general,
much more common in immunocompromized individuals, for example those
with AIDS (Chapter 3), those undergoing cancer chemotherapy (Chapter 17)
or those being treated with immunosuppressive drugs to prevent rejection of
a transplant (Chapter 6).

A)

The clinically important helminths (worms) can be divided into three main
groups: nematodes (roundworms), cestodes (flatworms) and trematodes
(flukes). Helminths often have complex life cycles that may involve other
hosts in addition to humans. In humans, they may infect the alimentary canal,
blood vessels, lymphatics or other tissues such as skeletal muscle. Helminths
are significant parasites in tropical climates. Examples of disease-causing
helminths are the pork tapeworm Taenia solium (Figure 2.12) that can live in
the gut and Schistosoma the cause of bilharzia.
x 75

ARTHROPODS AND VERTEBRATES
Arthropods may be directly parasitic, but many are also relevant to infectious
diseases as vectors of pathogens. The mite Sarcoptes scabiei lives in the
outer layers of the skin and can cause scabies while fleas (Pulex) and head
and pubic lice, Phthirus capitans and pubis respectively, are blood sucking
parasites (Figure 2.13). Houseflies and cockroaches are noted carriers of food
poisoning organisms. More specific vectors include ticks that transmit Borrelia
burgdorferi, the cause of Lyme disease. Yersinia pestis, the bubonic plague
organism is spread by the fleas on black rats (Box 2.1). Malarial parasites are
spread by female Anopheles mosquitos (Box 2.2) and tsetse flies are vectors for
Trypanosoma brucei which causes sleeping sickness. Several disease-causing
organisms use mammals as vectors with perhaps the best known being the
rabies virus.

PATHOGENS AND VIRULENCE

BOX 2.2 Malaria ‚Äì the bad air disease
Malaria infects hepatocytes and blood. It is named malaria
from the eighteenth-century Italian ‚Äòmala aria‚Äô, meaning
bad air, from the belief the disease was caused by the
unwholesome air of swampy districts. Malaria is caused by
four main Plasmodium species, falciparum, malariae, ovale
and vivax, and is responsible for a signiÔ¨Åcant proportion of
mortality and morbidity worldwide, particularly in tropical
climates.
The life cycle of Plasmodium (Figure 2.14) is complicated
by any standards! A feeding female Anopheles mosquito
infects a human with a haploid stage of the parasite called
a sporozoite. These infect liver cells, replicate and develop,
and when released as merozoites can infect other liver
cells or erythrocytes. Here the parasite, usually called a
trophozoite, also grows and divides leading to the eventual
lysis of the blood cell. The released trophozoites can invade
other erythrocytes in 48 h cycles of invasions and lyses that
cause the characteristic fevers and chills associated with
malaria. The symptoms of the disease are usually most severe
during the lysis of erythrocytes. However, eventually some
trophozoites develop into male and female gametocytes
that can be ingested by a feeding mosquito. Within the
insect gut, the gametocytes fuse forming a diploid zygote.
The zygote enters the gut wall forming a cyst. Within
the cyst, the zygote develops and forms sporozoites that
migrate to the salivary gland. Thus the cycle of events can
be repeated when the mosquito next feeds on a human.
The symptoms of malaria may present after a variable
incubation period and include headaches, general malaise,
sweating, muscular pains and rigors and anorexia. The
clinical course and symptoms of different forms of malaria
are variable although infections are characterized by the
recurring attacks of chills and fevers described above.
A variety of antimalarial drugs is available (Chapter 3). Some
prevent the hepatic forms of Plasmodium from invading
erythrocytes; others destroy the erythrocytic or gametocyte
forms of the parasite in the patient‚Äôs blood preventing
transmission of the parasite by the mosquito. Chloroquine
is the usual choice for treating malaria because it is cheap,
safe and normally effective. However, chloroquine-resistant
strains of Plasmodium falciparum are now endemic in subSaharan Africa and elsewhere. Drugs available to treat
these resistant parasites include halofantrine, meÔ¨Çoquine,
quinine and quinidine and others. However, in many cases
the molecular mechanisms of action of antimalarial drugs
are not well understood.
The remarkably complicated life cycle of the malarial
parasites with their prehepatic, hepatic, pre-erythrocyte
and erythrocyte stages, means there is a large choice of
antigenic targets to use for vaccine development (Chapter
3). Despite a number of efforts and trials to develop an
effective malarial vaccine, to date none has been successful,
although the complete sequencing of its genome in 2005
should assist in this.

VIRULENCE FACTORS

2.3

VIRULENCE FACTORS

Evolution has provided pathogens and parasites with a wide range of factors
that allow them to invade and colonize their host while at the same time
avoiding and/or neutralizing host defense mechanisms. Many virulence
factors of pathogens have been identified; some are relatively nonspecific in
action: some microorganisms, for example, possess specialized iron uptake
systems. Microorganisms require iron for oxygen transport, mitochondrial
energy metabolism, electron transport, the synthesis of nucleic acids and
gene expression. However, although an essential element, iron is often only
available in limited quantities and microorganisms that possess a variety of
iron uptake systems are able to grow in regions of the host that would otherwise
be expected to be sterile since little iron is available. Other virulence factors
have rather more defined defensive or offensive actions.

DEFENSIVE VIRULENCE FACTORS
Numerous pathogens evade the host‚Äôs defenses by producing slime layers
or possessing polysaccharide capsules (Figure 2.15). Slime layers consist of
exopolysaccharides (EPSs) that bind large quantities of water. Slime production
is particularly important in bacteria that form biofilms since it forms a
protective coat around the bacterial population. For example, the biofilm
formed by the opportunistic Pseudomonas aeruginosa in the respiratory tract
of cystic fibrosis patients protects it from the immune system and antibiotics.
Capsules generally consist of a single polysaccharide structure that also binds
considerable quantities of water and forms a protective layer around the
bacterial cell. The polysaccharide is often negatively charged which renders it
resistant to uptake by phagocytic cells. Capsules can also protect the bacterium
from attack by the immune system (Chapter 4). Some polysaccharide
capsules are molecular mimics of host cell surface structures. The capsule of
Escherichia coli K1 and the type B capsule of Neisseria meningitidis consists
of A-2, 8-N-acetylneuraminic acid residues. This is identical to neuraminic
acid residues on the neuronal adhesion molecule N-CAM and other sialylated
molecules of the nervous system. Consequently host immune systems do not
recognize the bacteria as foreign and both pathogens can invade the CNS
causing meningitis.

fragilis an obligately anaerobic bacterium that
is normally found in the gastrointestinal tract.
It is most frequently isolated from clinical
infections such as peritonitis (Chapter 11). Note
the prominent capsules surrounding each cell.
Courtesy of Dr S. Patrick, Queen‚Äôs University Belfast,
UK.

Other examples of molecular mimicry are the many proteins of pathogenic
bacteria that are homologous to specific regions of host proteins. Yersinia
induces the production of antibodies that cross-react with part of a particular
variant of a host protein called HLA-B27 (Chapters 4 and 5). Cross-reactivity
between other bacterial species and HLA-B27 is thought to be involved in the
development of types of arthritis known as Reiter‚Äôs syndrome and ankylosing
spondylitis.
Some bacteria directly or indirectly activate or suppress actions of the immune
system by producing pathogenicity factors called modulins or microkines.
The P fimbriae of the uropathogenic Escherichia coli, for example, induces an
increase in the release of interleukin 4 (IL-4) by uroepithelial cells. Modulation
of cytokine production may lead to increased pathogenicity (Chapter 4).
A number of microorganisms prevent their hosts mounting an effective
immune response by changing their surface antigens. This can occur in a
number of ways. For example, several viruses, including influenza and HIV,
have genes coding for surface proteins that mutate at relatively fast rates. This
is referred to as hypermutability. Thus, the antigenic structure of these surface
proteins is prone to change at intervals, leaving a population that is no longer
immune to that virus. Other microorganisms that undergo antigenic variation
include the trypanosome that causes sleeping sickness. These regularly
change the structure of their surface glycoproteins during the course of an

PATHOGENS AND VIRULENCE

infection. The malarial parasites Plasmodium also express different surface
antigens during the infection process. Some parasitic worms, for example,
schistosomes, become coated with patient antigens, such as MHC molecules
and common blood group antigens, and so avoid recognition by the host.

OFFENSIVE VIRULENCE FACTORS
Bacterial offensive virulence factors include adhesins, invasins and toxins.
Adhesins are proteins found on the surfaces of microbial cells that bind to
specific sites on the cells of the host. The best studied are those in the pili
of, for example, certain strains of Escherichia coli and Vibrio cholerae. Pili
are fibers about 2 Mm long and 2 to 8 nm in diameter that extend from some
bacterial cells (Figure 2.16). They consist of about 1000 protein molecules
and include a type of adhesin that belongs to a group of biomolecules called
lectins. These are glycoproteins that bind specifically to certain sugars or the
glycosidic bonds found in some carbohydrates. In the case of Escherichia coli
and Vibrio cholerae, these are mannose and fucose sugar residues respectively
which may be found on the surfaces of host cells.
Invasins are also proteins. They allow pathogens that have bound to the
host to be internalized, that is, enter the host cell preventing it from being
removed by ciliary action or washing and ensuring that the pathogen is
protected from direct immune attack. Once internalized, the microorganisms
may remain in membrane-bound vesicles. Others escape into the cytosol
and so avoid the killing mechanisms associated with phagocytosis. Some
microorganisms are so adapted to intracellular life that they are unable
to reproduce outside the host cell. These include species of Chlamydia,
Rickettsia and some mycobacterial pathogens. These organisms are
therefore obligate intracellular parasites and may cause infectious diseases,
for example, Chlamydia pneumoniae, Rickettsia typhi and Mycobacterium
leprae. However, others, such as strains of Listeriae, Salmonellae, Shigellae
and Yersiniae, are facultative and can live outside their host cells.
Pathogenic microorganisms produce different types of toxin. They can be
classified into two types: cell-associated toxins, for example endotoxins, and
those secreted by the bacterium called exotoxins.

Escherichia coli cell with numerous pili.

W^dad\nd[Y^hZVhZ

VIRULENCE FACTORS

Endotoxins are produced by bacteria with Gram-negative cell walls and
are lipopolysaccharides embedded in the outer membrane of the cell
walls of Gram-negative bacteria. The toxic portion is called lipid A and the
damage it causes varies with the susceptibility of the host. Fever is common
because endotoxins stimulate host cells to release cytokines that affect the
thermoregulatory center of the hypothalamus. In serious cases, endotoxic
shock can result.
Exotoxins are proteins secreted by both Gram-positive and negative bacteria.
They may be subdivided into three groups: those that damage membranes,
those with specific host targets and superantigens.
Exotoxins that damage membranes cause the cell to lose water and ions,
disrupting ion gradients across the membrane. In high doses cell lysis occurs,
hence they are sometimes called hemolysins or cytolysins. A clinically
significant feature of such toxins in an infection is their antiphagocytic activity.
Some of the hemolysins and cytolysins of bacteria, such as Staphylococcus
aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes and Bordetella pertussis are polypeptides
that aggregate in the membranes of host cells forming pores. Thiol-activated
lysins are predominantly produced by Gram-positive bacteria. These toxins
are proteins that contain a large number of cysteine residues. They bind to
cholesterol molecules in the membranes of target cells in oligomers of 25
to 100 toxin molecules. These form large toxin-lined aqueous pores in the
membrane that constitute the lesions of membrane damage.
Phospholipases catalyze the hydrolysis of phospholipids in the membranes of
host cells. For example, the A toxin of Clostridium perfringens (Figure 2.17) is
a phospholipase C which catalyzes the following reaction:
Phospholipase C
Phosphotidylcholine + H2O

phosphocholine + diacylglycerol

Similarly, the B hemolysin of Staphylococcus aureus is a sphingomyelinase C
that catalyzes the following reaction:

Figure 2.17 Molecular model of the A toxin of
Clostridium perfringens. PDB Ô¨Åle 1CA1.

Sphingomyelinase C
Sphingomyelin + H2O

phosphocholine + ceramide

The degradation of membrane lipids, naturally, results in a loss of membrane
integrity and function. Exotoxins that target specific sites in the host do so
in a wide variety of ways, for example, they may act on cells to deregulate or
kill them or they may have an extracellular target. Gram-negative bacteria,
such as Enterobacteriaceae (Escherichia coli, Citrobacter freundii, Yersinia
enterocolitica), secrete heat-stable enterotoxins as small as Mr 2000 (Figure
2.18). These toxins bind to specific receptors that are part of a cyclic GMPdependent signal transduction system of enterocytes in the upper intestinal
epithelium. This system regulates the concentration of intracellular cyclic
GMP that, in turn, is involved in the activation of intracellular enzymes, for
example, protein kinase G (Chapter 7). The binding of the toxins interrupts
the secretion of Na+ and Cl‚Äì and this results in a watery diarrhea.
A number of exotoxins consist of two dissimilar polypeptides usually
referred to as the A and B subunits. The B subunit recognizes and binds
to specific target cells and facilitates entry of the A subunit which has an
intracellular toxicity. The tetanus and botulinum toxins are Zn-dependent
proteases (Figure 2.19) that act as neurotoxins. They catalyze the hydrolysis
of synaptobrevin 2, a protein involved in docking and fusion of vesicles
containing neurotransmitters. Thus their actions inhibit the release of
neurotransmitters. Following its internalization into neurons of the CNS, the
tetanus A subunit, tetanospasmin, migrates to peripheral nerve endings by

PATHOGENS AND VIRULENCE

retrograde axonal transport. Here it is released by postsynaptic dendrites and
diffuses to the presynaptic neurons where its action prevents the release of
the inhibitory neurotransmitters, G-aminobutyric acid and glycine. This leads
to unchecked excitatory impulses with a continuous stimulation of muscles
and spastic paralysis. In contrast, botulinum toxin is absorbed from the
gastrointestinal tract and is transported to susceptible neuromuscular and
peripheral autonomic synapses where it inhibits the release of acetylcholine,
causing flaccid paralysis.
Some exotoxins are ADP ribosyl transferases. The cholera, pertussis and
diphtheria toxins (Figure 2.20) use NAD+ as a donor substrate so that the
ADP ribosyl portion of NAD+ is transferred to the target protein releasing
nicotinamide. Cholera and pertussis toxins attack G proteins and interfere with
signal transduction so that receptor-mediated signal transduction pathways
are activated or inhibited (Chapter 7).

toxin. The red sphere represents a bound Zn. PDB

ADP ribosylation by cholera toxin fixes the GA protein in its active form. This
leads, in turn, to a long-lasting activation of adenylate cyclase and synthesis
of cyclic AMP and activation of protein kinase A. The net result is a longlived opening of the chloride channel of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane
conductance regulator, (CFTR, Chapter 16), that increases secretion of
hydrogen carbonate (HCO3‚Äì) and Cl‚Äì into the intestinal lumen but which
inhibits the absorption of Na+ and Cl‚Äì. The resulting osmotic effect causes
a massive leakage of intracellular water into the intestinal lumen and
subsequent diarrhea. This is called fulminant cholera.

COURSE OF INFECTION

Diphtheria toxin kills cells by blocking protein synthesis. The target of the
toxin is a single protein, elongation factor EF2, involved in protein synthesis.
Its activities are inhibited by ADP ribosylation. The Shiga family of toxins
produced by Shigella dysenteriae and Escherichia coli (Figure 2.21) also inhibit
protein synthesis but by a different mechanism. They are N glycosidases
that hydrolyze an N-glycosidic bond between specific adenine and ribose
residues of the 28S ribosomal RNA of the 60S ribosomal subunit.
Microorganisms secrete a number of toxins that are enzymes which degrade
components of the connective tissues. Staphylococci and Streptococci
secrete enzymes that degrade the extracellular matrix allowing them to
invade and colonize tissues. Clostridium perfringens secretes a variety of
carbohydrases and proteases that degrade connective tissues, allowing it to
colonize and spread through subcutaneous tissues. If the bacteria invade
the deeper muscles tissue they may cause necrosis and gas production from
anaerobic fermentations (gas gangrene). This type of infection is extremely
painful and can spread rapidly. Much of the direct damage is caused by the
A toxin described above. Other pathogens secrete proteases that hydrolyze
specific components of the immune defense, such as IgA or enzymes that
detoxify catalases and superoxidase dismutases (SODs) that are used by
some immune cells to kill microbial pathogens (Chapter 4).

subunit. PDB Ô¨Åle 1CZG.

Superantigens are polypeptides synthesized by Gram-positive pathogens,
such as some strains of Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pyogenes.
They are extremely effective and potent stimulators of the immune
system because of their unique ability to stimulate large numbers of its
cells simultaneously. This leads to a massive release of molecules called
cytokines that activate numerous physiological systems, such as the
temperature regulatory system. The superantigen of Streptococcus pyogenes
is responsible for streptococcal toxic shock syndrome (STSS). The fever,
shock and tissue damage associated with STSS is thought to be the result of
an overproduction of the cytokines Tumor Necrosis Factor A, Interleukin 1B
and Interleukin 6. The superantigen of Staphylococcus aureus, toxic shock
syndrome toxin 1 (Figure 2.22) causes symptoms that can lead to a rapid
failure of many body organs.

2.4

COURSE OF INFECTION

The course of an infection can be considered to follow up to four major stages
namely: adhesion, entry, localized infection and generalized infection.
A virulent pathogen is one that is well adapted to establish an infection. Most
pathogens are adapted to adhere to cells, usually epithelial, that line the site
of entry. Adherence is the first stage of infection, given that it prevents the
pathogen being swept away and eliminated from the body.
Pathogens enter the body through one of a number of so-called portals of entry.
These include the skin and conjunctiva, respiratory tract, gastrointestinal
tract (GIT), urogenital system and, in the case of fetuses, the placenta. Once
entry has been gained, conditions for growth, such as temperature, nutrients,
must be favorable, but the pathogen must also be able to overcome the local
defenses. Pathogens are often adapted to enter their hosts through a single
portal of entry and do not cause infectious diseases if they enter through a
different portal.

Figure 2.22 Molecular model of TSST-1 from
Staphylococcus aureus. PDB Ô¨Åle 2QIL.

A localized infection acts as a focus of infection and, indeed, many remain local
in nature or are prevented from spreading by host defenses. If the pathogenic
organisms penetrate tissues and reach the blood or lymphatic systems or
enter cells such as phagocytes, they can be distributed throughout the body
and infect other tissues and organs causing a generalized infection. Again,

PATHOGENS AND VIRULENCE

certain pathogens are particularly well adapted to infect specific target tissues
and organs. During infections, the pathogen multiplies and can be shed from
the host into the environment through portals of exit. In localized infections
these are the same as that of entry; in a generalized infection, other portals
are used. These may include loss from the skin in pus, scales and blood, from
the respiratory tract as droplets and aerosols of mucus and saliva, from the
GIT in feces and bile, from the urogenital system in urine, mucus and genital
secretions and, in pregnancy, from the placenta with direct transfer to the
fetus.
A pathogen may be eliminated at any stage of the infective process. In some
cases, the growth may be held in check but not eliminated. Such latent
infections can be activated later giving recurring infections. In some cases,
individuals can recover from a disease but the pathogen may remain in the
body for considerable periods. Such people are symptomless carriers and are
reservoirs of the disease.
Some viruses which exhibit latency, with or without sporadic reactivation are
shown in Table 2.2.

SUMMARY

Organisms that cause diseases in humans are found in all microbial groups,
including viruses, bacteria as well as fungi and helminths. In addition,
prion proteins can cause infectious disease since these aberrant proteins
can be passed on, for example, in food. A number of microorganisms
are not normally pathogenic, but can become so when a new ‚Äòniche‚Äô
becomes available to them, for example a burn wound, or when the host is
immunocompromized in some way. Pathogenic microorganisms display a
variety of virulence factors that aid entry into the host and which help them
to overcome host defenses. These virulence factors can have a generalized

action or be more specifically defensive or offensive in nature. An example of
the former is the possession of hypermutable genome that leads to changes
in the nature of the surface antigens of the microorganism and enables them
to escape the host‚Äôs immune system. Examples of offensive virulence factors

3.1

INTRODUCTION

The presence of virulence factors, described in Chapter 2, allows pathogenic
microorganisms to infect specific body systems and cause a vast range of
diseases. A small number of such organisms are also able to cause systemic
disease, that is one affecting the whole body. A pathogen must be transmitted
from a source to the patient. Direct contact between hosts is the most obvious
form of transmission but coughs and sneezes (aerosols), food, water and
arthropod vectors are all used by various pathogens. The long-term survival
of pathogenic microorganisms also depends on them maintaining their
infectivity during transmission from host to host. The sources of pathogens
can be abiotic, soil, water for example, or animals or other humans. Diseases
that infect animals and humans are called zoonoses, while humans who
harbor a pathogen but are symptomless are called carriers.
In a text of this length, it is simply not possible to describe all diseases
caused by microorganisms. This chapter will concentrate on selected,
representative examples of infections of the major body systems and those
microorganisms that can produce a generalized infection. In addition, the
ways in which infectious diseases are prevented, investigated and treated
will be outlined.

INFECTIONS OF THE SKIN

The skin is a major element of the innate immune defense (Chapter 4). It is
normally colonized by a variety of microorganisms although the numbers and
types vary between different areas of the body. In normal circumstances it
forms an effective barrier to invading microorganisms.
Papillomaviruses can infect epidermal cells and stimulate their proliferation
to form warts. Numerous herpes viruses have been described and at least eight
of them, the Human Herpes Viruses (HHV1-8), infect humans and can cause
clinical disease. Largely due to historical reasons, they are also known by other
names (Table 3.1). For example, Herpes simplex viruses 1 and 2 may infect skin
of the genitalia causing Herpes labialis and Herpes genitalis respectively and
Varicella zoster (Figure 2.5) causes chickenpox and shingles.

Bacterial skin infections normally occur only if the normal balance between
the skin environment and these organisms is disturbed. The outbreaks of
acne caused by Propionibacterium species (Figure 3.1) during the hormonal
changes associated with puberty are typical. Breaks in the skin from wounds or
surgery or lesions from insect bites or chickenpox may also lead to infections
of the skin by Staphylococcus aureus (Figure 3.2) and Streptococcus pyogenes.
In children especially, they may cause impetigo contagiosa, an extremely
contagious skin infection. Staphylococcus aureus can colonize hair follicles
leading to inflammations that can develop into abscesses (boils) or even, in
extreme cases, carbuncles: an amalgam of several abscesses. Enterobacteria,
Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pyogenes,
are all associated with a variety of skin problems following weakening of the
patient, for example, by diabetes (Chapter 7), by a deficiency of the immune
system (Chapter 5), by nosocomial, or hospital acquired, infection of surgical
wounds or burning of the skin. Mycobacterium leprae is the causative organism
of the dreaded disease leprosy, which, although now virtually eliminated in
developed countries, still affects many thousands in the developing world.
Fungi are associated with a variety of infections, particularly of the skin
(Chapter 2 and Figure 2.11).

INFECTIONS OF THE EYES, EARS AND CENTRAL NERVOUS
SYSTEM

Eyelid infections generally involve the lid margins, eyelid glands or follicles
causing styes or hordeolums. They are usually associated with Staphylococcus

INFECTIONS OF THE EYES, EARS AND CENTRAL NERVOUS SYSTEM

aureus infections. The conjunctiva is particularly susceptible to infection.
The epithelial surface enclosed by the eyelids is a warm moist enclosed
environment in which microorganisms can rapidly become established.
However, microorganisms must avoid being rinsed away by tears and some
pathogens, such as Chlamydia trachomatis (Figure 3.3), attach specifically
to conjunctival cells. An estimated 500 million people are infected with
different serotypes of Chlamydia trachomatis, making trachoma the most
significant eye infection worldwide. The disease blinds approximately
1% of infected individuals while many others suffer visual impairment.
Chlamydia trachomatis is transmitted by contact with contaminated flies,
fingers and towels although trachoma itself results from chronic repeated
infections. This is much more likely to occur in regions where restricted
access to water prevents regular washing of the hands and face. Chlamydia
is also a sexually transmitted disease (Section 3.6) and there is evidence that
untreated chlamydial infections can lead to premature delivery and babies
born to infected mothers can be infected in their eyes and respiratory tracts.
Chlamydia is a leading cause of early infant pneumonia and conjunctivitis
(pink eye) in the newborn.
A laboratory diagnosis of trachoma can be carried out using samples of
conjunctival fluid or scrapings. The usual treatment is with oral or topical
antibiotics, such as tetracycline or doxycycline (Section 3.11). Chlamydia
infections account for only a fifth of cases of conjunctivitis; others are caused
by bacteria such as Streptococcus pneumoniae and Leptospira spp.
Serious infections of the inner eye with Pseudomonas aeruginosa may
follow trauma or after invasion by the protozoan Toxoplasma gondii
causing chorioretinitis and possible blindness. This widespread protozoan
is not a serious threat unless acquired in utero or when an individual is
immunosuppressed, perhaps as a result of taking drugs to prevent transplant
rejection (Chapter 6). Infection occurs by swallowing oocysts released by
infected cats or by eating meat containing tissue cysts.

trachomatis, growing in cultured eukaryotic
cells, stained with iodine. Courtesy of School of
Biochemistry and Microbiology, University of Leeds,
UK.

The eyes may also be infected by parasitic worms, for example, larval forms
of the tapeworm Echinococcus granulosus that is transmitted by eggs passed
from infected dogs. Infection by the larvae of the nematode Toxocara canis,
which occurs naturally in the intestine of dogs, is, however, more common. An
infection can lead to the detachment of the retina. River blindness in Africa and
Central America is caused by the helminth Onchocerca volvulus. Simulium flies
carrying larvae obtained from the skin of infected hosts transmit the infection.
These flies develop in rivers, hence the name of the disease. River blindness is
a serious infection with over 300 000 people infected worldwide. The rates of
blindness, which is irreversible, may reach 40%. The usual treatment is with
anthelminthic drugs.
Infections of the outer ear may cause pain or irritation and are resistant to
some antibiotics. The middle ear can be colonized by viruses and bacteria
from the upper respiratory tract causing acute otitis media with swelling
and blockage of the Eustachian tube and may lead to deafness, though this
is generally temporary. Microorganisms that cause middle ear infections
include the virus that causes mumps. This may be followed by secondary
infections with Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae.
This is very common in children. Indeed, otitis media is the most frequent
illness diagnosed in young children. The general symptoms, apart from a
devastating earache, are fever, vomiting and diarrhea. The vesicles of the
tympanum become dilated, with bulging of the drum itself occurring in the
later stages of infection. If treatment is inadequate, then acute attacks may
eventually perforate the eardrum, produce chronic discharges and defective
hearing. The usual treatment is with oral antibiotics (Section 3.11), such as
ampicillin, amoxycillin, erythromycin and cefixime.

Margin Note 3.1 Haemophilus

i

Haemophilus inÔ¨Çuenzae type b is the
cause of ‚ÄòHib‚Äô meningitis. It is also
responsible for childhood epiglottitis,
causing the throat to swell alarmingly
and breathing difÔ¨Åculties as mucus
collects in the throat and fever.
The condition is life threatening.
Haemophilus inÔ¨Çuenzae type b can
also cause pneumonia and other
lower respiratory infections. The
health risks are mainly associated
with children under Ô¨Åve years old
but adults whose resistance has
been weakened by sickle cell anemia
(Chapter 13), chronic disease of the
spleen, alcoholism (Chapter 12) or
some malignancies (Chapter 17) are
also at risk. In the developed world,
the introduction of an effective
vaccine in the 1980s eradicated
Hib disease. However, it is still a
problem with thousands of children
in sub-Saharan countries affected.
In 2005, it was reported that a Ô¨Åveyear Medical Research Council led
program, involving SanoÔ¨Å Pasteur
and the World Health Organization
(WHO), of vaccinations against
Hib had successfully eliminated the
disease in children in the Gambia.
Hopefully, this will encourage other
countries to adopt a similar practice
of routine Hib immunization policies.

INFECTIOUS DISEASES AND TREATMENTS

Infections of the central nervous system (CNS) may affect the meninges,
the spinal cord or the brain causing meningitis, myelitis and encephalitis
respectively. More than one area may be infected simultaneously. Such
infections can also become systemic infections (Section 3.7). Pathogens can
enter these areas following head injuries, along the axons of neurons or
by breaching the blood‚Äìbrain or blood‚Äìcerebrospinal fluid barriers (Figure
3.4). The most common causes of viral meningitis are enteroviruses, such
as ECHO-, Coxsackie- and, formerly, poliomyelitis viruses (Figure 3.5). Viral
meningitis is not usually a life-threatening condition. Bacterial meningitis,
in contrast, has a mortality greater than 10%. The principal causative
organisms are the capsulated bacteria, Neisseria meningitidis (Figure
1.3), Streptococcus pneumoniae and, before the introduction of a vaccine,
Haemophilus influenzae (Margin Note 3.1). Effective vaccines are also
available against some serogroups of Neisseria meningitidis and a vaccine
against Streptococcus pneumoniae is being tested.
Encephalomyelitis results from infections by a number of viruses or protozoa.
These include some poliovirus types, Herpes simplex, measles virus, HIV, toga
viruses, which are transmitted by arthropods, and the rabies virus that is
transmitted from infected mammals. The protozoan Toxoplasma gondii may
infect individuals with compromized immune systems while Trypanosoma
brucei is the causative organism of African sleeping sickness.

INFECTIONS OF THE RESPIRATORY SYSTEM

The respiratory system is constantly exposed to inhaled microorganisms but
is protected by extensive defenses. The nose filters out particles larger than 10
Lm although those smaller than 5 Lm may reach the bronchi and alveoli. In
addition, there is a host of immune defenses including alveolar macrophages,
secretory IgA antibodies, complement proteins, surfactant proteins, secreted
defensins and lactoferrin (Chapter 4). Despite this, infections of the respiratory
tract are frequent causes of illness. The World Health Organization (WHO) has
reported that many hundreds of millions of patients suffer acute infections
of the lower respiratory tract worldwide. Figure 3.6 indicates the sites of a
number of respiratory diseases.

discussions.

Respiratory viruses are transmitted directly by aerosols or indirectly from
contaminated surfaces. The first site of attack is, not surprisingly, the epithelium
of the nose and throat. Indeed, the hundreds of corona and rhinoviruses
that cause the common cold replicate at 32 to 33oC, the temperature of the
mucosal surface lining the nose. The influenza viruses (Figures 2.4 and 2.8)
infect and replicate in respiratory epithelial cells causing cellular damage.
The generalized symptoms that present, such as muscular aches, malaise and
anorexia, suggest the virus may spread systemically from the respiratory tract
but there is no conclusive evidence for this.
The loss of ciliated and mucus producing epithelial cells impairs clearance of
invading microbes and creates conditions for secondary bacterial infections
of staphylococci, streptococci or Haemophilus influenzae. Bacterial proteases,
for example the V8 protease of Staphylococcus aureus, can enhance the
infectiveness of the influenza virus by improving virus adhesion.
Corynebacterium diphtheriae (Figure 3.7) and Bordetella pertussis (Figure
3.8) are obligate bacterial pathogens. Corynebacterium diphtheriae infects
the nasopharynx and the tonsils and may lead to a lethal systemic infection
affecting the heart, liver and kidneys. Bordetella pertussis is the causative agent
of whooping cough. It adheres to the epithelial cells lining the trachea and
bronchi where it interferes with ciliary action and releases toxins (Chapter 2)
and substances that damage and kill cells and irritate the surface, causing the
characteristic cough. Effective vaccines are available against both organisms
although 40 million infections of whooping cough occur annually worldwide. In
contrast, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Staphylococcus
aureus and Moraxella catarrhalis, make up to 60% of the normal bacterial
population of the nasopharyngeal mucous membrane in healthy individuals.
They can become opportunistic pathogens in immunosuppressed individuals

or following changes to the bacterium that render it increasingly virulent.
The commonest form of bacterial pneumonia is lobar pneumonia caused
by Streptococcus pneumoniae and results in a massive inflammation of one
lobe of the lung. Staphylococcus aureus may cause bronchopneumonia, while
Haemophilus influenzae can infect the epiglottis.
Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Figure 3.9) causes tuberculosis (TB) of the lung
and may be considered a rather special case of bacterial infection of the
lower respiratory tract. The bacteria enter the alveoli in inhaled air and are
phagocytozed by macrophages where they escape being killed and multiply
(Chapter 4). Mycobacteria can then enter the lymphatic system and invade
a neighboring lymph node. The healing of local lesions leads to calcification
of the lung tissues. In immunodeficient individuals, the lymph nodes and
tissues may be progressively affected until eventually the mycobacteria are
spread by the blood. Also with impaired immunity, dormant Mycobacterium
tuberculosis can be reactivated causing a severe form of pneumonia.

Atypical pneumonias can result from infections with Mycoplasma
pneumoniae, Chlamydia pneumoniae and Legionella pneumophila. These
infections are associated with ‚Äòflu-like' symptoms, such as high temperatures
and coughing, although bronchial secretions and sputum do not contain pus
as would be expected of a typical bacterial lobar pneumonia.
Generally, pathogenic fungi do not produce toxins but damage
tissues directly or disturb normal metabolic functions and can induce
hypersensitivity responses (Chapter 5). Fungi can cause respiratory
infections; Aspergillus fumigatus can invade the respiratory system and
lead to one of several types of diseases. It may simply grow in the mucus of
the bronchi and induce a hypersensitive state but may invade old wound
cavities of the lungs, such as those resulting from TB, and grow as a solid
mass called an aspergilloma. Aspergillosis may also result from an invasive
growth in the lungs and other tissues. Generally, the infective dose of
spores is extremely large although the invasive form may be secondary to
other systemic diseases. Similarly, Pneumocystis carinii can cause a serious
pneumonia (PCP) in AIDS compromized patients (Box 3.1). The yeast,
Candida albicans, is also an opportunistic agent in sufferers of AIDS.

tuberculosis in a specimen of sputum. Courtesy

Control and Prevention, USA.

INFECTIONS OF THE GASTROINTESTINAL TRACT

All regions of the gastrointestinal tract (GIT) are subject to infection. Saliva
traps and removes many pathogens and these can also be killed by stomach
acid (Chapter 11). Unfortunately new ones are constantly introduced through
breathing and eating.
Infections of the oral cavity (Figure 3.6) differ in type and symptoms to those
of the stomach and intestines. Inflammation of oral tissues caused by fungal
infection, actinomycosis, often occurs following injuries, such as an accidental
bite to the lining of the mouth or fracture of the jaw. Immunosuppression
resulting from viral infections, AIDS, cancer treatment or treatment with
broad spectrum antibiotics can all allow the yeast Candida albicans (Figure
3.10) to invade and colonize the mucous membrane, eventually producing a
thick layer of yeast cells called candidiasis or thrush.
Some bacteria can resist removal by saliva and become immobilized by
binding to surface receptors of cells in the mouth, eventually forming biofilms
and microcolonies. Oral streptococci, such as Streptococcus sanguis and
Streptococcus mutans (Figure 3.11), secrete glycosyltransferases that mediate
their adhesion to extracellular carbohydrates on tooth surfaces leading to
the formation of dental plaque, which is a complex mixture of bacteria and
extracellular materials. These bacteria, together with Actinomyces species, can

cause caries by forming plaque on the tooth enamel, where they catabolize
sugars to produce acid that demineralizes enamel and allows the dentine
to be eroded. Abscesses of the roots of teeth can also be caused by mixed
bacterial infections.
Periodontal (gum) diseases are inflammatory conditions that attack the
gums, bone, and other supporting structures of the teeth. The extent of the
inflammatory response depends upon the types of pathogens involved and
the effectiveness of the immune response. However, they are major causes of
tooth loss in adults. Gingivitis is the earliest form of periodontal disease and
occurs when plaque accumulates on the teeth near the gums, which become
inflamed and bleed easily. If detected and treated early, gingival tissues will
return to normal without long-lasting damage. Untreated gingivitis progresses
to periodontitis, which is also known as pyorrhea. Plaque hardens and extends
from the gum line to the tooth root causing the gums to detach from the
teeth and form pockets. Periodontal pockets create room for greater bacterial
activity, particularly of facultative and obligate anaerobic bacteria leading to
a progressive cycle of tissue damage until eventually the bone supporting the
teeth is destroyed resulting in their loss.
Stomach and intestinal infections are caused by viruses, bacteria, protozoa and
worms, all of which may be transmitted in food, contaminated drinking water
or by fecal‚Äìoral contact. The need for strict personal hygiene is emphasized
because these are the most frequent infections of children under five years
of age. Approximately 40% of cases of diarrhea (Chapter 11) in children are
caused by rotaviruses (Figure 3.12). In the very young this is potentially lethal
and the WHO has estimated that out of the nearly two billion annual diarrhea
diseases worldwide, three million end fatally.

ingested microorganisms. However, the motile bacterium, Helicobacter
pylori (Chapter 11) has specific receptors enabling it to bind to the gastric
epithelium. It secretes urease, which catalyzes the hydrolysis of urea releasing
ammonia that neutralizes stomach acid, and cytotoxins that damage the cells.
This causes chronic inflammation of the gastric mucosal membrane and can
lead to stomach and duodenal ulcers (Chapter 11). The partially digested
food (chyme) in the stomach is made alkaline in the small intestine by
secretions of the gut and pancreas and by bile salts (Chapter 11). In the ileum
and jejunum, nonenveloped viruses, such as rotaviruses and adenoviruses,
may infect enterocytes (Chapter 11) and damage the intestinal mucous
membrane with disruption of water and electrolyte resorption. This can result
in intestinal cramps, vomiting, watery diarrhea and a raised temperature.
Enteropathogens, such as Vibrio cholerae and forms of Escherichia coli that
are enterotoxic (ETEC) or enteropathogenic (EPEC) all have similar effects.
The protozoan parasites Giardia lamblia and Cryptosporidium parvum are
water-borne parasites that can infect the GIT. Giardia lamblia (Figure 3.14)
frequently causes chronic disease, with watery diarrhea and, in some cases,
a subfebrile temperature leading to malnutrition in children as a result of
malabsorption. Cryptosporidium parvum can adhere to the epithelium of the
small intestine and cause a shortening of the villi, which may be the cause of
the diarrhea.
The lower portion of the ileum has areas of lymphoid tissue called Peyer‚Äôs
patches (Figure 3.13) composed of so-called M (microfold) cells, rather than
the usual enterocytes and goblet cells (Chapter 11). These cells are able
to translocate materials directly to the lymph follicles found beneath the
mucosal surface. Invasive bacteria such as Campylobacter jejuni (Figure 3.15),
Salmonellae and Yersiniae can use M cells to enter the submucosal area. Here
they can multiply and destroy the adjacent epithelium, form abscesses and
spread through the lymph and blood systems into the mesenteric lymph
nodes, spleen and liver. The infection can also spread into the colon, causing
inflammation of the colon or colitis. The ileum and colon can also be attacked
by the bacteria Yersinia enterocolitica, Salmonella enterica and Campylobacter
jejuni resulting in abdominal cramps, vomiting, watery, occasionally bloody,
diarrhea and fever. Shigella dysenteriae and Escherichia coli pathotypes, EHEC
(enterohemorrhagic) and EIEC (enteroinvasive) can cause a hemorrhagic
colitis with bloody stools and subfebrile to febrile temperatures. The
pathogenic protozoan Entamoeba histolytica is thought to infect 50 million
people and kill about 100 000 per year worldwide due to amebic liver abscesses.
Lastly, Clostridium difficile, a normal inhabitant of the gut, is an opportunistic
pathogen. It is especially common in older people in hospitals and nursing
homes and has been implicated in iatrogenic infections following medical
interventions, such as antibiotic therapy. Infection with Clostridium difficile
is now recognized as the major causative agent of colitis and diarrhea, which
may occur following antibiotic intake and can be fatal in older patients.

INFECTIONS OF THE UROGENITAL SYSTEM

The urinary system and the genital systems are subject to infections by
specific respective pathogens (Figure 3.16). Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are
frequent in the developed world, with many millions of cases occurring each
year. A number of factors, including diabetes mellitus (Chapter 7), scarring,
kidney stones, use of catheters or anatomical peculiarities of the urinary tract
all predispose individuals to UTIs. These originate in the perianal area and
move up the urethra into the bladder causing a short-lived, acute infection

called cystitis. Escherichia coli is the most common agent causing up to 80% of
the relatively uncomplicated UTIs, like cystitis. Women are more prone than
males to cystitis because of their relatively short urethra and the hormonal
changes associated with the menstrual cycle (Chapter 7). Cystitis is readily
treated by increasing the uptake of fluids, particularly of acid drinks like
cranberry juice, which causes increased flushing of the bladder, and by the
use of antibiotics. Unfortunately, reinfections are frequent.
Pseudomonas aeruginosa (Figure 2.1) has been known to cause UTIs following
hospitalization. Similarly, infections by Enterococcus faecalis and Klebsiella
pneumoniae have followed organ transplants (Chapter 6). Unfortunately,
these organisms often show multidrug resistance against antibiotics (Box 3.4).
Thrush in the bladder, caused by the yeast Candida albicans can also occur
following antibiotic treatment.
There has been a large increase in the incidence of sexually transmitted
diseases (STDs) in the UK in recent years. Sexually transmitted diseases can
affect the urinary system and the genital tract and are caused by a wide range
of different pathogens. Human papilloma virus (HPV) can cause anogenital
warts (condyloma acuminata). Strains 16 and 18 of HPV cause lesions in the
cervix that are involved in the development of cervical carcinoma. Infection
with Herpes simplex virus (HHV-2) can lead to genital herpes with painful
ulcers and vesicular lesions of the genital mucous membrane. Infection with
human immunodeficiency virus (Box 3.1) leads to acquired immunodeficiency
syndrome (AIDS).

INFECTIOUS DISEASES AND TREATMENTS

BOX 3.1 HIV and AIDS
In March 1981, physicians in New York reported eight cases of
the previously rare Kaposi‚Äôs sarcoma (KS), in a form that was
markedly more aggressive than usual. All the affected were young
gay men. Also in 1981, the Communicable Disease Centers (CDC)
in Atlanta, Georgia, began to investigate an increase in requests
from New York and Los Angeles for pentamidine, a drug used to
treat Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia (PCP), an extremely serious
fungal infection. In addition to PCP and/or KS, patients suffered
a variety of opportunistic pathogens that eventually caused
their death. The combination of infections and KS appeared
to be the result of a total breakdown of the immune system
and became known as Acquired ImmunodeÔ¨Åciency Syndrome
(AIDS). Subsequently, AIDS was seen in intravenous drug abusers
and in a number of recipients of blood transfusions, and a viral
cause was suspected.
In 1983, a virus, variously named Lymphadenopathy Virus
(LAV) and Human T cell Lymphotropic Virus Type III (HTLV III),
was isolated. Following international agreement the virus was
renamed Human ImmunodeÔ¨Åciency Virus (HIV) (Figure 3.17)
in 1986. A number of strains of the virus have since emerged;
HIVs I and 2 are the most prevalent. HIV is a human retrovirus,
that is, its nucleic acid is RNA that on infection is transcribed
into DNA by the viral enzyme reverse transcriptase (Figure 3.18).
An electron micrograph of the virus and an illustration of its
replication cycle are shown in Figures 3.17 and 3.19 respectively.
The virus infects the CD4+ Helper T lymphocyte, a key regulatory
cell of the immune system (Chapter 4), rendering the patient
susceptible to a whole range of infections with all microbial
groups, from dysentery and diarrhea to pneumonia. For example,
the protozoan Cryptosporidium parvum can cause a moderate to
severe diarrhea that would soon be resolved in healthy people.
In HIV infected patients, cryptosporidial diarrhea is among the
commonest clinical presentations during the transition to fullblown AIDS, particularly in developed countries. The diarrhea
is severe, protracted and may become life threatening. Death
is commonly caused by pneumonia associated with the fungus
PCP among a host of opportunistic infections. A list of infections
common in AIDS patients is shown in Table 3.2.
Since the emergence of HIV, the virus has spread worldwide with
an estimated 38 million people, including 2.3 million children,
living with HIV/AIDS. It is thought that 25 million people have
died of AIDS up to the end of 2005. The virus has had devastating effects on communities, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa,
where about 8% of the adult population are estimated to be
living with HIV/AIDS.
There is no effective treatment that completely clears the body of
the virus. Drugs have been developed to inhibit replication of HIV
in positive individuals to prevent them developing AIDS. These
drugs target enzymes needed at different stages in the replication of the virus and include inhibitors of reverse transcriptase,
for example azidothymidine (AZT), and antiproteases, such
as amprenavir which prevent the virus from budding from an

*%

infected cell as shown in Figures 1.4 and 2.7. The combined use
of a number of drugs with different actions has been extremely
effective at preventing the development of AIDS but aggressive
therapy can lead to problems such as HAART (Margin Note 16.1).
Infected people can now expect to live relatively healthy lives
following initial infection. However, combination therapy has
to be taken for the remainder of the patient‚Äôs life. The drugs
have a number of side effects and are also extremely expensive.
There is evidence that some multiple drug resistance is emerging
amongst HIV strains. Since the virus was identiÔ¨Åed in 1983, the
search for a successful vaccine for HIV has been ongoing. All the
latest scientiÔ¨Åc technology has been used in this effort but, to
date, no vaccine has been successful.

INFECTIOUS DISEASES AND TREATMENTS

Some types of Chlamydia trachomatis are among the commonest causes of
STDs producing local inflammations of the urethra and cervix. In contrast,
other types are highly invasive and infiltrate the lymphatic system leading to
necrosis (lymphogranuloma venereum).
The most widely known STDs are probably gonorrhea and syphilis caused
by the bacteria Neisseria gonorrhoeae, a Gram-negative diplococcus, and
Treponema pallidum a spirochete (Figure 3.20 (A) and (B)) respectively.
Gonorrhea, a common STD, is a pelvic inflammatory disease whose
major symptoms include a purulent inflammation of the uterine cervix
and urethritis. In some women, however, the infection may be relatively
asymptomatic and may go unnoticed. Syphilis was thought to have
originated in the Americas and been brought to Europe by sailors on the
Columbian expeditions. More recent evidence suggests that it was present
in the Old World long before this. Treponema spirochetes can enter through
mucous membranes or minute abrasions in the skin during sexual acts.
The infection shows three stages of pathogenesis. Initially, an ulcer called
a chancre develops at the site of infection. The infection then spreads to
nearby lymph nodes causing them to swell and harden. Secondary syphilis
develops after one to three months. It is characterized by the presence of
highly infectious lesions on various parts of the body. The disease may lie
dormant for many years but, if not treated with antibiotics, will develop into
tertiary syphilis causing inflammations of the aorta and CNS. Dementia,
heart attacks and death can all result. Patients with tertiary syphilis cannot
infect others with the disease. Some patients may develop benign late
syphilis, which is usually rapid in onset but does respond well to treatment.
It usually begins three to 10 years after infection and is characterized by
the development of gummas. These are tumor-like growths of a rubbery
consistency that are most likely to affect the skin or long bones but can
also develop in the eyes, mucous membranes, throat, liver and stomach
lining. However, since the use of antibiotic treatments for syphilis they are
increasingly uncommon.
The protozoan Trichomonas vaginalis (Figure 3.21) is a frequent colonizer of
the mucosal membrane of the urogenital system. It is generally asymptomatic

but an inflammatory reaction, trichomoniasis vaginitis, may result in a frothy
cream-colored discharge.
A number of arthropods may be sexually transmitted. These include crab lice
and the scabies mite (Figure 2.14(A)).

3.7

SEPSIS AND SYSTEMIC INFECTIONS

A relatively small number of pathogens are able to enter the body in the
lymphatic or circulatory systems and produce a generalized or systemic
infection involving numerous body organs: brain, bone marrow, kidneys, liver,
lungs and spleen. Local skin infections, such as with Streptococcus pyogenes
or Staphylococcus aureus or infections of the GIT or urogenital system with
Enterobacteriaceae can unfortunately progress to acute generalized infections
within only a few days, given appropriate conditions. For example, Streptococcus
pyogenes or Staphylococcus aureus secrete toxins called superantigens
(Chapters 2 and 4) that stimulate the release of cytokines from immune cells and
produce an excessive inflammatory response called systemic inflammatory
response syndrome (SIRS) consisting of four characteristic stages. In stage I,
respiration, heart rate and body temperature all increase. The leukocyte count
may be increased or decreased. Stage II refers to the presence of the organism
in the blood of the patient; this is called sepsis. Normally less than 50% of
cases can be identified. Stage II may be cured intrinsically by the immune
system or extrinsically by the administration of antibiotics. If unsuccessful,
the condition progresses to stage III: serious sepsis or multiorgan dysfunction
syndrome (MODS) characterized by lactic acidosis, falling blood pressure,
hypoxia and oliguria. If clinical measures fail to stabilize the patient, then
stage IV, septic shock, develops with irreversible organ failure and the death
of the patient in most cases.
In contrast to the possible acute developments of localized infections,
generalized infections may have incubation times of up to three weeks.
A classical example of such a systemic infection is typhoid fever caused by
Salmonella typhi (Figure 3.22). The pathogen may be ingested and can enter
the body through the tonsils in the throat and Peyer‚Äôs patches in the gut. The
bacterium is distributed to various organs in the lymph and blood, infects

Salmonella typhimurium (Figure
3.23), as its name suggests, causes
a lethal, systemic infection that
resembles typhoid fever in mice.
However, in humans it does not cause
as severe a disease as Salmonella
typhi although it is a major cause of
food poisoning. This rarely leads to
fatalities, other than in the elderly
or very young or in patients with
depressed immune systems who
are not treated with antibiotics. The
disease is characterized by symptoms
of nausea and vomiting, abdominal
cramps and diarrhea that generally

cells and grows intracellularly. The major symptoms are fevers of up to 40oC
and the development of abscesses in the intestine that may cause perforations
and a fatal peritonitis. Even when the patient recovers, a relapse may occur.
Salmonella typhi infects about 60 million patients annually, mainly in the
developing world. If untreated, it can be fatal. Some recovered patients retain
the pathogen in the gall bladder and excrete bacteria in their feces, becoming
carriers, although remaining healthy themselves.
The zoonosis, brucellosis, caused by various species of Brucella (Figure 3.24), is
also a primary systemic infection. This is a common infection of cattle (Brucella
abortus), sheep and goats (Brucella melitensis) and can infect humans if they
drink contaminated milk, if they inhale the bacteria into the lungs or if there
is direct contact through skin lesions. People who work in direct contact with
animals, such as farmers, veterinarians, shepherds, goatherds and abattoir
workers, are most at risk. The pathogen colonizes and grows in the main
abdominal organs and bone marrow producing periodic attacks of relapsing
fever over an extended period.

3.8

INVESTIGATING INFECTIOUS DISEASES

To diagnose an infectious disease, two criteria must be satisfied. First, signs
and symptoms compatible with the suspected infectious agent must be
apparent. Secondly, the pathogen must be recovered from the infected site of
the patient or there must be evidence of the pathogen being present at that
site.

Figure 3.23 Electron micrograph of Salmonella
typhimurium. Courtesy of Dr A. Curry, Manchester
Royal InÔ¨Årmary, UK.

Infectious diseases can affect any organ or system and can cause a wide variety
of symptoms and signs (Chapter 1). The clinical history and examination
should aim to identify the sites of infection and the causative organism. The
clinical history focuses on aspects relevant to infectious disease, such as
recent travel history, food and water intake, occupational exposure, sexual
activity and any use of intravenous drugs. The clinical examination involves
identifying fever, skin rashes, swollen lymph nodes (lymphadenopathy) and
investigations of the eyes, ears, mouth and throat. Fever is a typical symptom
of infection but not all patients with fever have an infection and not all
infectious diseases present with fever. Investigations of the vagina, rectum
and penis are necessary in sexually transmitted diseases.
The history and clinical examination is often supported by tests to assess health
and identify the organs affected. These tests include imaging techniques such
as X-rays, ultrasound, computerized tomography (CT), magnetic resonance
imaging and blood tests (Chapters 18 and 13). The blood tests involve a full
blood count where eosinophilia is an important finding in parasitic infections
and lymphocytosis is usually found in viral infections. The erythrocyte
sedimentation rate and C-reactive protein (Chapter 4) levels are nonspecific
tests of value in monitoring the course of infectious diseases. Other tests
involve assessing liver and renal functions (Chapters 11 and 8), which may be
disrupted by an infection.
Microbiological tests to identify the infectious agents are especially helpful.
Specimens for microbiological investigations include blood, cerebrospinal
fluid (CSF), feces, pus, sputum and urine (Chapter 1). Microbiological
investigations use a variety of techniques, including culture, serological,
biochemical and molecular biological tests.

The suspected microorganism from the patient is grown outside the body
usually on or in growth media, such as nutrient agar or broth, or in selective
media which support the growth of particular microorganisms, until growth

INVESTIGATING INFECTIOUS DISEASES

is detectable. In the case of bacteria, characterization is based on their
microscopic appearance and the shape, texture and color of colonies. To
some extent, bacteria can be identified by their ability to grow in specific
media, such as blood agar or Sabouraud‚Äôs agar. Indicator media that include
some substance that visibly changes as a result of the metabolic activities
of particular microorganisms are also of use in identification. Fungi and
mycoplasmas are cultured in similar ways to bacteria. However, they require
a greater use of microscopic and colonial morphology for identification.
Certain microorganisms, such as chlamydiae, and all human viruses, are
intracellular pathogens and their growth requires the inoculation of cultured
eukaryotic cells. When viruses infect and replicate within cultured cells,
pathological changes are produced that are characteristic of particular viruses
and can be used for identification purposes. Moreover, electron microscopy
of supernatants from these cultures, or even on patient samples, can show
the presence of particular viruses. For example, Norwalk virus (Figure 3.25),
which causes outbreaks of vomiting and diarrhea, has been identified in stool
samples of affected individuals. The diagnosis of parasitic infections, protozoa
and helminths, may involve growing them in culture. More frequently, parasites
are identified directly from specimens isolated from infected patients and/or
indirectly by examining the cysts or eggs of the parasite.

SEROLOGICAL TESTS
Serological tests involve identifying infectious agents indirectly by measuring
serum antibodies in the affected individual. Antibody levels against a pathogen
increase in the early stages of the disease and then fall during recovery. Such
tests are particularly useful in situations where it is impossible to isolate the
infectious agent and are used to make a diagnosis of, say, HIV infection. It is
preferable to take a blood sample early in the infection (acute serum) and
10‚Äì14 days later (convalescent serum). A fourfold or greater rise in antibody

BOX 3.2 API strips
The API system, named from the parent company Appareils et
Proc√©d√©s d‚ÄôIdentiÔ¨Åcation, for identifying bacteria and yeasts
was Ô¨Årst developed in the 1970s. Although the tests themselves
were not new, the system used standardized and miniaturized
versions of the existing biochemical tests on a single strip. Each
test strip contains a number of separate compartments that
contain the dehydrated reagents necessary for each speciÔ¨Åc
test. The test is typically performed by forming a homogeneous
suspension of the microorganism to be identiÔ¨Åed in 0.85% NaCl
solution. Samples of the suspension are then added to each of
the wells and this also rehydrates the reagents. The organisms
will produce some observable change in the wells, for example
color changes due to pH differences or enzyme activities or form
end products that can be identiÔ¨Åed. Any one well will, of course,
give a positive (+) or negative (‚Äì) result. A number of tests are

necessary to identify a species or strain and the tests on any
one API strip give a proÔ¨Åle or numerical identiÔ¨Åer that is the
sequence of positive and negative test results (Figure 3.26). The
organisms can then be named from a codebook that correlates
this sequence with the bacterial species or strain or, more usually,
identiÔ¨Åcations can be made with a computerized database.
Organisms can generally be identiÔ¨Åed accurately and reliably in
four to 48 h, depending upon the strips used and the species of
microorganism concerned.
API tests include 15 identiÔ¨Åcation systems for almost all groups
of bacteria and over 600 different species. These include
Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria, such as species
and subspecies of Enterobacteriaceae, bacilli, Campylobacter,
Corynebacteria, enterococci, Listeria, micrococci, Staphylococci
and Streptococci and some anaerobic bacteria and yeasts.

titer in the second serum is diagnostic of an acute infection. Antibodies to
bacteria can be detected by their ability to agglutinate these microorganisms.
Alternatively, a variety of immunotechniques are available which are outlined
in Chapter 4.

BIOCHEMICAL AND MOLECULAR BIOLOGICAL TECHNIQUES
A variety of biochemical and molecular biological tests are available to help
identify microorganisms. The simple Gram stain can immediately eliminate
many possible bacteria. The abilities of some bacteria specifically to ferment
some carbohydrates, use different substrates, express restricted enzyme
activities or form specific products in enzyme catalyzed reactions can all aid in
identification. The susceptibility of bacteria to different antibiotics (Figure 3.27)
can also be useful and has the added utility of indicating possible therapy.

The GC ratio of the DNA of bacteria is generally expressed as a percentage
100(G + C) / (A + T + G + C) and varies from 20 to nearly 80%. Any one
particular group of bacteria has a characteristic value. Specific genes from
pathogenic organisms have been cloned and sequenced. That for the 16S
ribosomal RNA has received considerable attention and, indeed, differences
in the sequences of this gene have allowed evolutionary relationships between
different groups of bacteria to be deduced. The entire genomes of a number
of viruses, pathogenic bacteria and parasitic protozoa have been sequenced
and the number is growing rapidly. Nucleic acid probes can be designed to
detect characteristic sequences of pathogens and identify the organism in
body fluids or tissues. This technique has been enhanced by the development
of the polymerase chain reaction.

The polymerase chain reaction
The polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was devised by Mullis in 1983. He was
awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1993; the shortness of time between
the two dates is indicative of the perceived importance of PCR. Indeed, it is
hard to exaggerate the impact of PCR because it has revolutionized molecular
biological techniques. The PCR is an elegantly simple in vitro method for
increasing in an exponential manner the number of relatively short strands of
specific DNA fragments, normally of 500 to 5kbp, although longer lengths of
up to 40 kbp can also be amplified. These may be whole genes but are more
usually only a fragment of one. DNA consists of two polynucleotide strands
arranged together in the now familiar double helical structure. The strands
run in opposite directions: one in the 3_ k 5_ direction, the other with a 5_ k 3_
orientation. The bases of the nucleotides of each strand associate together such
that they form complementary pairs, with an adenine (A) of one strand paired
with a thymine (T) of the other, and guanine (G) pairing with cytosine (C). The
base pairs, and therefore the polynucleotide strands, are held by hydrogen
bonds. It is the sequence of bases in the DNA strand(s) that is unique and
specific to a particular gene.
The PCR is used to replicate the original DNA sample (template DNA) using a
DNA dependent DNA polymerase, usually abbreviated to DNA polymerase. This
enzyme copies the template DNA to produce new strands with complementary
sequence. Some DNA polymerases can proofread, that is correct any mistakes
in the newly formed strand to ensure the fidelity of its sequence. Crucially,
DNA polymerases cannot begin the new strand de novo, but can only extend
an existing piece of DNA. Thus two primer molecules are required to initiate
the copying process. The primers are artificial oligonucleotides, short DNA
strands of fewer than 50 nucleotides that are complementary to regions that
flank the section of the template DNA of interest. Hence the primer determines
the beginning of the region to be amplified. Primers are usually made to order
by commercial suppliers who must, of course, be supplied with the required
sequence.

INVESTIGATING INFECTIOUS DISEASES

The PCR consists of a series of cycles, each of which consists of three identical
steps (Figure 3.28). First, the double-stranded DNA has to be heated to 90‚Äì
96¬∞C to break the hydrogen bonds that connect the two strands and allow
them to separate. This denaturation is called melting. Prior to the first cycle,
the DNA is often heated for an extended time, called a ‚Äòhot start‚Äô, of up to 5
to 10 min to ensure that the template DNA and the primers are fully melted.
In subsequent cycles, 30 s to 3 min at 94 to 96¬∞C is normally sufficient for
melting. Placing a heated lid on top of the reaction tubes or a layer of oil
on the surfaces of the reaction mixtures prevents evaporation. The second
step is primer annealing at temperatures of 50 to 65¬∞C for 30 to 60 s, during
which the primers bind to their complementary bases on the now singlestranded DNA templates. The primers must be present in excess of the target
DNA otherwise its strands will simply rejoin. The design of the length of the
primers requires careful consideration. Primer melting temperature, which
must not be confused with that of the template DNA itself, increases with
the length of the primer. The optimum length for a primer is generally 20 to
40 nucleotides that have melting temperatures of 60 to 75¬∞C, although this
depends upon their G/C content. If the primers are too short they will anneal
at random positions on the relatively long template and result in nonspecific
amplification. However, too long a primer and the melting temperature would
be so high, that is above 80¬∞C, that the DNA polymerase would have reduced

activity. The third step is the synthesis of DNA in reactions catalyzed by the
polymerase and which extend the primers using the complementary strands
as templates. This usually requires 45 to 120 s at 72¬∞C. The extended portion of
DNA is a complement of the template strand. Given the high temperatures of
the reactions, DNA polymerases from thermophilic organisms are preferred.
The Taq polymerase from Thermus aquaticus is widely used although it has the
disadvantage of lacking proofreading capabilities and therefore of introducing
errors (mutations) of 1 in 400 to 500 nucleotides in the new DNA. Polymerases
such as Pwo or Pfu, obtained from Archea, have proofreading mechanisms
that significantly reduce mutations and are used in ‚Äòlong range‚Äô PCR of up to
about 30 kbp.
The result of the first cycle is two helices that are usually overextensions of
the target sequences. Each is composed of one of the original strands plus
its newly assembled complementary strand and its associated primer, for
each of the original template DNA molecules. The cycle is usually repeated
20 to 30 times in identical conditions with a doubling of the amount of DNA
present for every cycle (Figure 3.29). Hence after 30 cycles the amount of DNA
in the original sample has increased over 230 (109 fold)! A PCR experiment
normally terminates with a 10 min incubation at 72¬∞C to ensure that all of
the amplified DNA molecules are fully extended by the polymerase. Note that
extremely stringent conditions are necessary to prevent any unwanted DNA
contaminating PCR experiments, since this would also be amplified.
The great advantages of PCR are the increase in sensitivity and its automation.
Samples of DNA from even a single cell or from samples many years old
can be amplified and then analyzed. The PCR reaction is automated in a
thermocycler, which automatically heats and cools the reaction tubes to the
appropriate temperatures, for the desired times and the required numbers of
cycles.
The products of PCR are identified by determining their base sequences and/
or their sizes using agarose or polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis against a
known sample. The size of the product can be estimated by comparison with
the electrophoretic mobility of fragments of DNA of known size (Figure 3.30).
The biomedical sciences apply PCR in four main areas, which are the
identification of infectious disease organisms for diagnostic purpose, in the
detection of variations and mutations in hereditary diseases (Chapters 15 and
16), detecting acquired mutations that lead to cancers (Chapter 17) and in
tissue typing (Chapter 6). It is especially useful in diagnosing diseases caused
by organisms that are difficult or impossible to culture. Its ability to amplify
incredibly small amounts of DNA means that PCR-based tests can identify
sources of infection more accurately, reliably, rapidly and cheaply than previous
methods. For example, it can detect three different sexually transmitted

disease agents, Herpes, papillomaviruses and Chlamydia on a single swab.
Polymerase chain reaction tests can even distinguish the specific strains of
papillomaviruses that predispose individuals to cervical cancer. Diagnostic
tests are also available for the viruses involved in AIDS, viral hepatitis and viral
meningitis. The PCR is the most sensitive and specific test for Helicobacter
pylori, the main cause of stomach ulcers (Chapter 11). In England and Wales,
47% of cases of meningococcal infections in 2002 were diagnosed using
PCR tests for meningococcal DNA in clinical samples. Bacterial infections in
middle ear fluid from children suffering otitis media are detectable by PCR,
indicating an active infection, even when standard culture methods fail. The
Lyme disease bacterium, Borrelia burgdorferi, is often difficult to diagnose
accurately on the basis of general symptoms but PCR can amplify its DNA in
body fluids.

3.9

PREVENTING INFECTIOUS DISEASES

Infections are the commonest cause of human morbidity and mortality.
In developing countries at the beginning of the last century diseases, such
as TB, pneumonia and bacterial infections secondary to influenza, were
major causes of death. However, in the developed world their impact has
been lessened by public health measures such as improved housing, better
sanitation and advanced social and economic conditions. Unfortunately, in
developing countries infectious diseases, such as malaria, TB, respiratory and
GIT infections, are still major causes of death, particularly in children.
The prevention of infectious disease is achieved by the use of vaccines
(Chapter 4). Vaccination works by stimulating the immune system to produce
antibodies against the pathogenic organism by introducing bacteria or viruses
that have been rendered ‚Äòharmless‚Äô in some way. The simplest, though not
necessarily the most effective, method of preparing vaccines is by killing
whole microorganisms. These are then injected into the host to induce an
immune response. An example of a ‚Äòkilled‚Äô vaccine is that used to protect
against whooping cough caused by Bordetella pertussis. In some instances the
immune response produced against dead organisms is insufficient to induce
good immunity. This is usually because killing the microorganism often
involves denaturing their proteins so while the immune response recognizes
the denatured proteins it does not react to the native proteins on the pathogen.
To overcome this problem, live but attenuated (weakened) microorganisms
may be used. These microorganisms are less virulent and, in most cases,
stimulate an effective immune response in the host. This type of approach is
used for the combined vaccine against measles, mumps and rubella (MMR)
and for the oral vaccine against poliomyelitis (Margin Note 3.4).

Margin Note 3.3

i

The extreme sensitivity of PCR means
it can even diagnose the diseases on
old and therefore largely degraded
samples. The former USA vice
president and presidential candidate
Hubert H. Humphrey (1911‚Äì1978)
underwent tests for bladder cancer in
1967. However, these gave negative
results and, untreated, he died of
the disease. A urine sample taken in
1967 and a tissue sample from his
cancer-ridden bladder obtained in
1976 were analyzed retrospectively
with PCR ampliÔ¨Åcation in 1994.
The DNA of both samples showed
identical mutations in the p53
gene (Chapter 17). This is a wellestablished tumor suppressing gene.
Had it been possible to diagnose
the cancer in 1967, then Humphrey
could have received the beneÔ¨Åts of
the then current treatments and his
life may have been extended. This is,
of course, only one of many examples
where advances in biomedical
sciences have greatly improved
clinical practice.

Some patients do not develop an effective immune response to these
weakened microorganisms and, unfortunately, the weakened microorganisms
can become virulent again, a phenomenon known as reversion. To overcome
this problem, selected proteins, from, for example, bacterial capsules or
viral envelopes, are extracted from the microorganism and used as vaccines.
These are known as subunit vaccines. Unfortunately, bacterial capsular
polysaccharide is often poor at stimulating immunity and a recent development
is to render the vaccine more immunogenic by attaching the polysaccharide
to an immunogenic protein. Such vaccines are known as conjugate vaccines:
examples include the most recent vaccines against Neisseria meningitidis
serogroup C, and Haemophilus influenzae.
Subunit vaccines against viral proteins can now be produced more cheaply by
employing recombinant DNA techniques. In such cases, nucleic acid coding
for the protein in question is isolated and cloned. This DNA is then transfected
into a suitable microorganism which can be cultured and induced to synthesize

Margin Note 3.4 Baby and
childhood vaccination programmes

i

Most countries of the developed
world have baby and childhood
vaccination programmes that protect
against a variety of potentially lifethreatening conditions. In early 2006,
the UK government announced
it was amending its vaccination
programme for children less than two
years old by adding a new vaccine to
its programme that protects against
the Pneumococcus bacterium, which
causes ear infections, pneumonia
and meningitis. This would give the
UK a fairly typical baby vaccination
programme, as follows. At the age
of two months, the baby is given a
vaccine against Pneumococcus and
a Ô¨Åve-in-one vaccine that protects
against Hib, diphtheria, polio,
tetanus and whooping cough.
At three months, a meningitis C
vaccine and a Ô¨Åve-in-one booster are
administered. These are followed a
month later with another Ô¨Åve-in-one
booster and boosters for meningitis C
and Pneumococcus. When the baby
is one year old, he or she receives a
combined Hib/meningitis C vaccine,
which is followed a month later
with the MMR (combined mumps,
measles and rubella) vaccine and
another Pneumococcal booster.

INFECTIOUS DISEASES AND TREATMENTS

the protein in vitro. An example is the recombinant vaccine against Hepatitis
B produced in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae that have been transfected
with a gene encoding the S (surface) protein of the virus. More recently, DNA
vaccines, which consist of viral genes transfected into bacterial plasmids and
injected directly into muscle, have been undergoing clinical trials, although,
as yet, none of these is routinely available.
For those infectious diseases where toxins (Chapter 2), rather than the
microorganism, are responsible for the disease, vaccines may be prepared
against chemically modified or heat inactivated toxins. These inactive toxins,
known as toxoids, are then used for vaccination purposes and, indeed, this is
the approach used for diphtheria and tetanus vaccines.

3.10 CONTROLLING THE SPREAD OF PATHOGENS
Controlling the spread of an infectious agent is a complex process, requiring
a number of interventions, some of which will depend on the microorganism
involved. Epidemiological investigations (Chapter 1) can help to pinpoint
the source of the infection. Strict hygiene precautions, for example thorough
cleaning and disinfection of contaminated materials, and hand washing, can
prevent the spread of pathogens between patients. The boiling of drinking
water may be necessary, depending on the source of the outbreak. Routine
microbiological investigations may be carried out to ensure that the microbe
is under control. For the patient, antibiotics or antiviral drugs (Section 3.11)
may be given, while patient contacts may be offered vaccination and/or drug
treatment. Examples of this multifactorial approach can be seen following
outbreaks of Neisseria meningitidis, in schools and colleges, where all contacts
with infected patients are offered antibiotics and vaccines, depending on the
serotype.

3.11 TREATMENT OF INFECTIOUS DISEASES
The treatment of infectious disease is almost entirely pharmacological
although nursing care is obviously necessary in many cases and surgery may
sometimes be used. The development and extensive uses of antibiotics and
other drugs over the last 60 years in particular has had an enormous impact in
reducing the number and effects of infectious diseases. Viruses and bacteria
are the most important causes of infectious diseases in developed countries,
while fungi, protozoa and helminths are of increased importance in the
tropical climates of developing countries.

ANTIVIRAL DRUGS
Viruses are acellular and can only replicate by utilizing the metabolic processes
of their host cell. It is difficult to target viruses inside host cells without
damaging both infected and normal host cells hence there are relatively few
effective antiviral agents. To be fully effective, antiviral drugs should ideally
inhibit viral replication but not affect the reproduction of the host cell.
Unfortunately, current antiviral drugs are not fully effective as all interfere to
some extent with reproduction of the host cell and so produce adverse effects.
Antiviral agents do not normally directly ‚Äòkill‚Äô the virus but, rather, inhibit
their replication. Therefore, they must be administered for sufficient time to
allow natural immune mechanisms to eradicate all the virions present. Thus
antiviral therapy may well fail in severely immunocompromized patients.
Most antiviral agents act by disrupting one of the steps in the replication
cycle of the target virus. They may prevent viral internalization into the host
cell. If the virion enters its host cell, other antiviral agents can interfere with

+%

TREATMENT OF INFECTIOUS DISEASES

the release of the viral nucleic acid from the capsid. Some antiviral agents
prevent the synthesis of the viral nucleic acid or its proteins. Even if the virus
is successfully synthesized, agents that interfere with its release from the host
cell can prevent its dissemination. Lastly, some antivirals can help promote
a more effective immune response against viral infection. Table 3.3 lists
examples of each type of antiviral agents.

Viruses can become resistant to specific antiviral agents (Box 3.4). Hence a
therapy combining several agents, each of which acts at a different stage in the
replication cycle is likely to be a more effective treatment. For example, HIV
treatment is typically a combination of the antiHIV proteases (Figure 3.31)
amprenavir, ritonavir and the antiHIV reverse transcriptase inhibitor AZT,
which is a ribonucleoside analog (Figure 3.32 and Box 3.1).

ANTIBACTERIAL DRUGS
Drugs to treat bacterial diseases are generally called antibiotics. They are the
most significant in clinical practice because bacteria are responsible for the
greater proportion of infectious diseases. Most antibiotics are derived from
the products of the metabolism of microorganisms, such as certain bacteria
and fungi. Their actions usually rely on differences between microbial and
host cells. Ideally, antibiotic drugs should kill the target bacterium, that is, they
should be bactericidal. Bacteriostatic drugs prevent the bacteria replicating
and must be administered for sufficient time to allow the immune defenses of
the body to eliminate the pathogen.

INFECTIOUS DISEASES AND TREATMENTS

Not all antibiotics are effective against all pathogenic bacteria. Some are only
effective against Gram-negative bacteria, whereas others are effective against
Gram-positive only (see later). Other antibiotics can be used to treat a range
of both Gram-positive and negative organisms and are referred to as broad
spectrum antibiotics. Antibacterial drugs generally act in one of four major
ways: they may inhibit the synthesis of the bacterial nucleic acid, proteins or
the cell wall or they may act in a variety of rather miscellaneous and, in some
cases, unknown mechanisms.

Figure 3.33 Molecular model of rifampicin (a
rifamycin antibiotic) shown in red, bound to
an RNA polymerase. The spheres represent
magnesium and zinc atoms. PDB Ô¨Åle 1I6V.

Many drugs inhibit both replication and transcription at several points.
These drugs fall into a number of general families. Sulphonamides inhibit
the formation of folate which is essential for the synthesis of precursors of
nucleic acids. Nitroimidazoles bind directly to DNA and denature its helical
structure such that it is no longer a substrate for DNA-binding proteins.
Clofazimine, a drug which is used to treat leprosy, also binds to DNA
preventing replication and transcription, though it is not a nitroimidazole.
Quinolones, nalidixic acid and norfloxin, and the synthetic antibiotic
ciprofloxacin, fluoroquinolones, offloxacin, norfloxacin and others, are
inhibitors of DNA topoisomerase II, an enzyme essential for the replication
and transcription of DNA. The rifamycins are inhibitors of RNA polymerases
(Figure 3.33) and suppress transcription.
Protein synthesis begins with the translation of messenger RNA molecules
by ribosomes to form polypeptides. Translation is broadly similar in both
bacterial and mammalian cells though there are some significant differences
between the two types of cells. For instance, bacterial ribosomes consist
of 30S and 50S subunits (Figure 3.34), whereas eukaryotic ones have larger
60S and 40S subunits. A number of the protein translation factors necessary
for translation also differ. These differences are exploited by a number of
antibacterial drugs.
The main antibacterial antibiotics that interfere with protein synthesis
are the aminoglycosides, lincosamides, macrolides and tetracyclines. The
streptogramin quinupristin-dalfopristin, a relatively newly introduced
drug, also interferes with protein synthesis. Aminoglycosides, such as
streptomycin and gentamicin, are bactericidal and have complex effects
following irreversible binding to specific proteins of the 30S subunit. They
inhibit protein synthesis by interfering with initiation, inhibiting an essential
checking step called proofreading performed by the ribosome so incorrect
amino acids are inserted into the polypeptide leading to the production of
nonfunctional or toxic peptides, inhibit elongation and prevent ribosomes
associating together as functional polyribosomes. Clindamycin and
lincomycin are lincosamides. These antibiotics can be bacteriostatic or
bactericidal. They interfere with the first and subsequent steps in translation
within the ribosome. Macrolides may be bacteriostatic or bactericidal.
Examples include the widely used erythromycin and azithromycin and
clarithromycin. They prevent translocation, that is, the movement of the
peptide-tRNA complex within the ribosome. The tetracyclines are a well
known group of drugs and include the parent tetracycline itself, as well
as other antibiotics, such as doxycycline and oxytetracycline. Their action
is bacteriostatic in that they inhibit the binding of the aminoacyl-tRNA
complex to the 30S subunit and so slow down translation. Streptogramins
type A and B (dalfopristin and quinupristin respectively), produced by
Streptomyces pristinaepiralis, are chemically modified to give the drug
quinupristin-dalfopristin. Quinupristin and dalfopristin alone each show
weak bacteriostatic activities, however, together their actions are synergistic
since they both target different site/actions of the 50S ribosome of bacteria,
inhibit protein synthesis and lead to the release of incomplete polypeptides.
Dalfopristin binds directly within the peptidyl transferase center of the
ribosome interfering with the binding of tRNA molecules and inhibiting

+'

W^dad\nd[Y^hZVhZ

TREATMENT OF INFECTIOUS DISEASES

elongation of the polypeptide, while quinupristin blocks the exit tunnel of
the polypeptide from the ribosome. Quinupristin-dalfopristin was licensed
for use in the UK and USA in the late 1990s for treating severe infections with
Gram-positive organisms, including nosocomial pneumonia and infections
related to the use of intravascular catheters. It is particularly useful for treating
complicated skin infections with methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus
and Streptococcus pyogenes and life-threatening infections of vancomycinresistant Enterococcus faecium (Box 3.4). Quinupristin-dalfopristin has poor
activity against Enterococcus faecalis compared with Enterococcus faecium.
The latter is generally a less serious pathogen and other treatments are
available, even though the former is the more prevalent clinically. However,
strains of Enterococcus faecium resistant to quinupristin-dalfopristin are
being found.
Several other antibiotics that interfere with protein synthesis are also in
clinical use. Fusidic acid, a bactericidal agent that is used only in the treatment
of gonorrhea, inhibits translocation. Chloramphenicol is a widely known
antibiotic although its action is bacteriostatic. It inhibits the formation of
peptide bonds by the ribosome. Lastly, spectinomycin, used in the treatment
of penicillin-resistant staphylococcal infections, prevents translocation.
Human cells, like all animal cells, lack a cell wall. This means that metabolic
processes in the bacterial cell concerned with wall synthesis are excellent
targets for specific antibacterial agents. The bacterial cell wall forms a
protective bag around each microbial cell that prevents osmotic lysis. The
wall contains layers of peptidoglycan, each of which consists of rows of amino
sugars linked together by short peptides. Gram-negative bacterial cell walls
have only a single layer of peptidoglycan. In contrast, those of Gram-positive
organisms may have as many as 40.
Bacterial growth involves cell division and entails the breakdown of the
cell wall by bacterial enzymes, followed by synthesis of new peptidoglycan.
Antibiotics, such as the A-lactams, that inhibit cell wall synthesis are almost
all bactericidal since their presence stops new peptidoglycan formation and
therefore affects cell wall synthesis while bacterial enzymes continue to break
down the existing cell wall. A-Lactams are the largest, most widely used class of
antibacterial antibiotics and contain the best known antibiotics, the penicillins
and cephalosporins. They are, of course, only active against growing bacterial
cells. All contain a chemical structure known as a A-lactam ring (Figure
3.35) responsible for their antibacterial effects. A-Lactams are irreversible
inhibitors of transpeptidase, the enzyme that catalyzes the cross-link between
the sugar residues and peptides in the peptidoglycan layer(s). A number of
non-A-lactam antibiotics also reduce the efficiency of bacterial cell wall
synthesis. They inhibit a number of different enzyme catalyzed steps in the
synthesis at a wide variety of sites; hence they have no common mechanism of
action. Examples of these drugs include cycloserine, vancomycin, fosfomycin
and isoniazid (Figure 10.29) among others.
A rather miscellaneous grouping of antibiotics includes the polymyxins,
nitrofurantoin, pyrazinamide and metronidazole. Polymyxins are effective
against Gram-negative bacteria where they disrupt the structure of the cell
membrane. Nitrofurantoin may be considered a prodrug given the need
for bacterial enzymes to metabolize it to an active form that is thought
to damage bacterial DNA. Pyrazinamide is used to treat TB and acts by an
unknown mechanism although TB treatment, in general, requires prolonged
therapy with a combination of antibiotics (see later). Metronidazole is an
effective drug against anaerobic bacteria and some protozoan parasites. The
unionized form of metronidazole is readily taken up by these organisms,
which possess electron transport systems able to reduce it to an active form
that disrupts the helical structure of DNA, inhibiting bacterial nucleic acid

Margin Note 3.5 Fleming and
penicillin

i

The antibacterial activity of penicillin
was discovered by Fleming (1881‚Äì
1955) in 1928 at St Mary‚Äôs Hospital
in London. During this period,
Fleming went on holiday and left
some cultures of staphylococci
on agar plates unwashed. When
he returned, he noticed a fungal
contaminant growing on one of the
plates that was inhibiting the growth
of the bacteria around it. Fleming
realized that the mold was secreting
a substance into the agar which
was preventing the bacteria from
growing. He called this substance
penicillin after the contaminating
mold, Penicillium notatum (Figure
3.36). However, Fleming was unable
to isolate the substance and its
puriÔ¨Åcation did not occur until
many years later following extensive
work by Chain and Florey in Oxford
during World War II. The signiÔ¨Åcance
of Fleming‚Äôs discovery of the Ô¨Årst
antibiotic was quickly appreciated
and, among many honors, Fleming
was elected Fellow of the Royal
Society in 1943 and knighted in
1944. In 1945 Fleming, Chain and
Florey were jointly awarded the
Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine
for their discovery of penicillin and its
curative effects.

synthesis. Metronidazole is used alone or combined with other antibiotics to
treat abscesses in the liver, pelvis, abdomen and brain caused by susceptible
anaerobic bacteria and colon infections caused by Clostridium difficile,
Giardia infections of the small intestine, amebic liver abscesses and amebic
dysentery and Trichomonas vaginalis vaginal infections, and both male and
female carriers of trichomonas.
Despite their specificity, antibiotics can cause toxicity in humans including
allergic responses to the penicillins and sulphonamides, ear and kidney damage
by aminoglycosides (Box 3.3), while chloramphenicol can show liver and bone
marrow toxicities causing serious hematological diseases, particularly aplastic
anemia. This can cause the death of rare susceptible individuals.

ANTIFUNGAL, ANTIPROTOZOAL AND ANTHELMINTHIC DRUGS
Fungi, protozoa and helminth parasites are responsible for many infections,
particularly in the developing world. Given that they are all eukaryotic, then
drugs to treat them are prone to act against host cells and they often have side
effects. These drugs may kill the parasite or simply inhibit its growth. In the
latter case, therapy must be continued for sufficient time to allow the host
immune system to eradicate the organism.
Most antifungal drugs are not fungistatic but are fungicidal. One fungistatic
drug, griseofulvin, inhibits intracellular transport and mitosis in fungi by
interfering with the functions of their microtubules. A comparatively large
number of fungicidal drugs suppress the synthesis of the essential cell
membrane constituent, ergosterol. These include the allylamine antifungals,
terbinafine and naftifine; the imidazoles, clotrimazole, econazole,
ketoconazole and miconazole and the triazoles fluconazole and itraconazole.
Ciclopiroxolamine inhibits the synthesis of fungal cell membrane proteins.
The polyene antifungals, amphotericin and nystatin insert into plasma
membranes of susceptible fungi. This increases the permeability of
the membranes, allowing water and ions to leak and kill the parasite.
Fluorocytosine inhibits the synthesis of fungal DNA.
In many cases, the precise biochemical mechanisms of antiprotozoal drugs
are not known in any great detail. However, atovaquone inhibits electron
transport in mitochondria. Pentamidine and isethionate interfere with the
synthesis of protozoal macromolecules, while metronidazole, nifurtimox
and tinidazole are thought to denature existing macromolecules. A number
of other antiprotozoal therapeutic drugs are in clinical use. These variously
affect protozoal enzymes, inhibit glycolysis and fatty acid oxidation or inhibit
the synthesis of precursors of nucleic acids.
In general, the therapeutic bases of anthelminthic drugs are poorly understood.
A number of commonly used drugs interfere with muscle contractions in the
worms producing flaccid or spastic paralysis. This kills the parasite or makes
it susceptible to attack by the host immune system. Paralysis is achieved by
several overlapping mechanisms. Metriphonate inhibits cholinesterase leading
to spastic paralysis while ivermectin potentiates inhibitory F aminobutyric acid
mediated peripheral neurotransmission and levamisole and pyrantel block
nerve transmission at the neuromuscular junction. Diethylcarbamazine and
piperazine cause hyperpolarization of muscle membranes. Praziquantel acts
directly on muscle cells and increases the permeability of muscle membranes
to Ca2+.

Other anthelminthic agents act through different mechanisms. Oxamniquine
interacts with helminth DNA and disrupts its structure. Niclosamide
inhibits mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation in helminth parasites. The
anthelminthic agents albendazole, mebendazole and thiabendazole disrupt
the microtubules of the cytoskeleton of the helminth.

TREATMENT OF INFECTIOUS DISEASES

BOX 3.3 Ototoxicity and M√©ni√®re‚Äôs disease
Approximately 5‚Äì10% of patients treated with aminoglycosides,
of which the best known examples are streptomycin and
gentamicin, experience side effects, involving hearing, balance
and the renal functions. Ototoxicity, that is, drug or chemical
damage to the inner ear (Figure 3.37), can result in hearing loss
or tinnitus and can lead to a loss of balance and feelings of
dizziness. The extent of ototoxicity varies with the drug, its dose
and other clinical conditions. In the majority of cases the damage
is minor and reversible once medication ceases. In other cases,
the extent of damage is limited, for example high-frequency
hearing loss, where the damage to the ear makes it difÔ¨Åcult to
hear high pitched musical notes, but does not affect the ability
to hear the spoken word or converse. In extreme cases, there may
be complete and permanent deafness.
Ototoxicity is obviously undesirable; however, the ear damage
associated with aminoglycosides can help some patients
who suffer from M√©ni√®re‚Äôs disease. M√©ni√®re‚Äôs disease is
named after the French physician M√©ni√®re (1799‚Äì1862).
In the 1860s he theorized that attacks of vertigo, tinnitus
and hearing loss arose from problems in the inner ear. The
disease is an idiopathic syndrome, although some patients can
identify triggers that can induce or aggravate symptoms, of
endolymphatic hydrops, a condition in which abnormally large
amounts of endolymph collect in the inner ear. Its symptoms
are recurring episodes of hearing loss, tinnitus, rotational
vertigo (a form of dizziness), nausea and a sense of pressure
in the middle ear. M√©ni√®re‚Äôs disease affects adults from the
age of 20 years but is commonest in patients in their 40s
and 50s. Given its generalized symptoms, the criteria used in

diagnosing M√©ni√®re‚Äôs disease are variable and estimating its
incidence is difÔ¨Åcult, although it is thought to be 0.5 to 7.5
per 1000. The incidence varies by ethnic background and is
commoner in Britain and Sweden but it is known to affect
black and Oriental ethnic groups.
Betahistine may be used to control M√©ni√®re‚Äôs disease. Avoidance
of triggers can reduce the frequency and duration of symptoms
and episodes but not all episodes can be attributed to triggers.
Conservative treatments for M√©ni√®re‚Äôs disease involve a reduced
sodium diet and diuretics to control water retention and
reduce inner ear Ô¨Çuid pressure, and medications to reduce the
vertigo, nausea/vomiting, or both during an episode. Vestibular
rehabilitation therapy to help retrain the body and brain to
process balance information can help with the poor balance that
afÔ¨Çicts patients between attacks. Devices that deliver a series of
low-pressure air pulses designed to displace inner ear Ô¨Çuid may
also be used. In 20‚Äì40% of patients, conservative treatments are
ineffective and a chemical labyrinthectomy may be performed
with ototoxic aminoglycosides to control the vertigo associated
with the affected ear but cause less damage to the hearing
mechanism than some traditional treatments. Gentamicin is
injected through the tympanic membrane into the middle ear
from where it can diffuse into the inner ear and destroy some or
all of the balance cells. In patients with M√©ni√®re‚Äôs disease of both
ears, streptomycin can be given intramuscularly and will have
an effect on both ears. About 10% of patients require surgery,
which can be used to relieve the pressure on the inner ear or to
block the transfer of information from the affected ear to the
brain.

Margin Note 3.6 Necrotizing
fasciitis

i

The condition necrotizing fasciitis
is an infection with the so-called
‚ÄòÔ¨Çesh-eating bacteria‚Äô, for example
Group A Streptococci (GAS), most
commonly Streptococcus pyogenes.
The prevalence and incidence of this
condition are both extremely rare but
can begin after surgery, particularly
abdominal or gynecological
interventions. However, it may
also develop from complications
of childbirth, burns or following
relatively minor traumas, for example
bites and abscesses. The bacteria
produce extracellular enzymes
that attack soft tissues, often in
an extremity, destroying muscle,
fat and skin, causing an extensive
necrosis of subcutaneous tissue.
The lysosomal hydrolytic enzymes
(Chapter 16) released from damaged
cells of the patient may exacerbate
the bacterial damage. The condition
can be diagnosed by culturing the
bacteria from blood samples or
aspirations of pus from affected sites
although surgical exploration may be
necessary. Necrotizing fasciitis can
have such a sudden and rapid onset
that extent of destruction of soft
tissues may quickly kill the patient.
Hence an early diagnosis and prompt
medical and surgical interventions are
necessary to reduce the risk of death.
Treatment often includes intravenous
penicillin and clindamycin, along with
aggressive surgical debridement,
the removal of infected tissue, which
can be very extensive. For those
with severe illness, conÔ¨Ånement in
an intensive care unit is needed.
Limb amputation may be necessary.
Unfortunately, approximately 20%
of patients who suffer necrotizing
fasciitis die of the condition.

INFECTIOUS DISEASES AND TREATMENTS

COMBINATION THERAPY
Combination therapy is the treatment of infections with two or more
drugs usually to increase the clinical efficacy of the treatment, for example
as described above for quinupristin-dalfopristin, or to minimize the
development of resistant strains of the infective organism. Where the
infection is of unknown origin, then multiple therapies are advisable to fight
the most likely pathogens. With mixed infections involving two or more
known pathogens, it is desirable to target each microorganism with one or
more different antibiotics. Combination therapy may be used even if only
a single infective pathogen is present as using combinations of drugs can
prevent or delay the development of resistance to the drugs being used (Box
3.4). For example, some bacteria are resistant to A-lactams because they
produce a A-lactamase that catalyzes the breakdown of the A-lactam ring.
Combining an inhibitor of A-lactamase, such as clavulanic acid, with the Alactam antibiotic helps preserve the drug in vivo. Other drugs commonly
combined in therapeutic use are sulphamethoxazole and trimethoprim that
synergistically inhibit the synthesis of folate by blocking different steps in its
synthesis. The cocktail of isoniazid, rifampicin and pyrazinamide is used in
the treatment of TB, while clofazimine, dapsone and rifampicin are used in
combination in the therapy of leprosy.

SURGERY
Most infectious diseases can be treated using drug therapies. However, surgical
intervention may be required in instances when the pathogen is resistant to
available treatments or where it is the only means to contain an infection that
is spreading to other areas of the body, as, for example, in gangrene caused
by Clostridium perfringens (Figure 3.38) or necrotizing fasciitis (Margin Note
3.6). In other cases, surgery might be desirable because access to the affected
site by the antimicrobial agents is limited, as in the case of some abscesses
or appendectomy where surgical drainage or removal of necrotic tissue
respectively can enhance the recovery process.

perfringens growing in Schaedler‚Äôs broth.

TREATMENT OF INFECTIOUS DISEASES

BOX 3.4 Development of antidrug resistance
Drug resistance refers to the loss of effectiveness of a
pharmacological agent against a pathogen. The pathogen or
parasite may, of course, be initially nonsusceptible to a particular
drug and this is referred to as primary resistance. Secondary or
acquired resistance is that which develops over a period of time
in a previously sensitive organism.
The development of secondary resistance by viruses following
the chronic use of antiviral drugs is common and is normally the
result of spontaneous mutations in viral genes. Many antiviral
drugs target the same viral enzyme. Hence a mutation in the gene
for that enzyme may render the virus resistant to several antiviral
agents. In other cases, resistance to two antivirals is acquired by
discrete mutations. The strain of virus that acquires resistance to
one speciÔ¨Åc drug may be more susceptible to another antiviral
agent. This is one reason why combination therapy involving
two or more antiviral drugs maximizes the therapeutic effects, as
for example, in the treatment of AIDS (Box 3.1). Unfortunately,
given time, viral strains resistant even to combinations of antiviral
drugs are likely to develop. Strains of the HIV virus resistant to the
commonly used zidovudine, lamivudine and ritonavir are now
present.
Like viruses, secondary or acquired resistance can also develop
in previously sensitive bacteria. Indeed, the development of
microorganisms that are resistant to drug treatment is well
illustrated in bacteria, a number of which are now resistant
to commonly used antibiotics. For example, sulphonamide
resistance can be caused by a single mutation in the gene
coding for dihydropterate synthase. Genes that confer
resistance against a particular drug may be acquired as a
result of spontaneous mutations. It may, however, occur by
acquiring new genetic material from other bacteria. This genetic
material may be chromosomal, most commonly transposons,
or extrachromosomal, usually plasmids. Plasmids are especially
signiÔ¨Åcant in the transfer of antibiotic resistance between
resistant and nonresistant bacteria. Further, a single plasmid may
contain the genetic determinants for resistance to several drugs.
Antibiotic resistance in bacteria is achieved by four major
biochemical mechanisms. There may be a decrease in the
uptake or increase in the efÔ¨Çux of the drug by the bacterial cell.
Streptococci and some anaerobe bacteria, for example, lack the
electrochemical gradient across the cell membrane necessary to
allow aminoglycoside entry. Some bacteria develop enzymes that
are able to modify and inactivate certain drugs. The production
of A-lactamase by some bacteria that renders them resistant
to A-lactams has already been mentioned in the main text.
However, in the 1980s it was found that Klebsiella spp and in
some cases Escherichia coli were producing new A-lactamases

CZhhVg6]bZY!BVjgZZc9Vlhdc!8]g^hHb^i]:YLddY

that could hydrolyze the extended spectrum cephalosporins.
These enzymes were collectively named extended spectrum
A-lactamases (ESBLs).
When an antibiotic blocks a single reaction, for example, by
inhibiting an enzyme, then resistance may be acquired by the
bacterium acquiring mechanisms to bypass that reaction. This is
the principal mechanism of resistance to sulphonamides. Bacteria
may also acquire the ability to modify chemically the targets
of speciÔ¨Åc drugs. Examples of the target modiÔ¨Åcation include
topoisomerase II, the pharmacological target of quinolones
and Ô¨Çuoroquinolones, and ribosomal proteins targeted by
aminoglycosides.
Bacteria may differ in the way they resist the actions of a drug
while, in some cases, they may use more than one way of nullifying
the effects of a single drug. Several clinically signiÔ¨Åcant bacteria
are now resistant to a number of antibiotics and, unfortunately,
are sometimes spread to vulnerable patients within hospitals.
An example of such a bacterium is the methicillin-resistant
Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). In addition to producing Alactamase, MRSA is resistant to more than 40 A-lactams in
clinical use because they contain a gene coding for an additional
penicillin binding protein (PBP) which has only low afÔ¨Ånity for the
A-lactams. This allows MRSA to continue the synthesis of cell wall
material during treatment with A-lactam drugs.
Enterococci are normally found in the large intestine and
the female urogenital system. They can contaminate hands,
equipment and the patient care environment. The recovery of
enterococci from the hands of health care workers indicates that
fecal-hand contact may be a major means of transmission to
hospitalized patients with intravascular devices. This can lead
to life-threatening bloodstream infections. Vancomycin was the
drug of choice for treating such patients; however, vancomycinresistant enterococci (VRE) were isolated in 1994. These bacteria
are also resistant to many of the antibiotics previously used in
treatment and patients may be affected for many months. Not
surprisingly, VRE infections have become a serious health care
issue. The vancomycin-resistant gene of VRE can be transmitted
to other bacteria, for example Staphylococcus aureus and strains
of this organism partially resistant to vancomycin, vancomycinresistant Staphylococcus aureus (VRSA), were discovered in Japan
in 1996, and in the USA and France in 1997.
Antibiotic resistance can also, of course, develop in the eukaryotic
pathogens, fungi, protozoa and helminths. Resistance in the
malarial parasite has been mentioned in Chapter 2. In all cases,
the continual emergence of resistant strains of pathogens means
there is a need to keep developing new pharmacological agents
that are capable of treating infectious diseases.

INFECTIOUS DISEASES AND TREATMENTS

CASE STUDY 3.1
Andrew, a 48-year-old male, presented at the Accident
and Emergency Department of his local hospital. He
told the examining doctor that the previous day he had
experienced pain on the side of his right calf. Within 6 h,
the area was septic and pus could be expressed. Over
the day, the swelling and redness (inflammation) had
gradually extended to cover the area from the ankle to
the knee. Physical examination showed respiration,
pulse, blood pressure and temperature were all within
reference values. There was no obvious area of pus at
the site and pus did not drain on puncturing with a 20gauge needle. Andrew was treated with intramuscular
and oral ceftriaxone. Two days later, Andrew returned

with increased pain and slightly increased temperature.
The center of inflammation showed an obvious pus-filled
area. Culture of the pus showed the presence of clusters
of Gram-positive cocci on nutrient agar and yellowishcolored colonies on 5% sheep blood agar. The area was
removed by aspiration and the area excised and drained.

SUMMARY

3.12 SUMMARY
Pathogenic microorganisms cause clinical conditions from infections of
single organs or systems to systemic disease. Infections of the skin may be
caused by viruses, such as papilloma and Herpes simplex types. Skin bacteria
cause boils and abscesses and severe and chronic conditions such as leprosy.
Fungi also cause a variety of skin infections, although these are not usually
severe, unless the patient is immunocompromized. Severe infections of the
eye include trachoma, a chlamydial disease that is the most common eye
infection worldwide. Helminths, such as Toxocara canis can cause blindness.
Viruses and bacteria may cause painful ear infections which, if recurrent,
may damage hearing. Both groups of organisms are capable of infecting
the CNS, sometimes resulting in encephalomyelitis by Herpes simplex or
meningitis by Neisseria menigitidis. A number of viruses and bacteria cause
significant respiratory infections, some of which, for example TB, are chronic.
All varieties of microorganisms can infect the GIT, causing illnesses ranging
from short-term gastroenteritis to stomach ulcers. An extensive number of
microorganisms can infect the genital tract or are transmitted sexually. Several
may cause systemic diseases.
The diagnosis of infectious disease involves a combination of laboratory tests
to identify the microorganism present in specimens typically by culturing
them. However, the presence of antibodies to the organisms in the patient may
be used for identification and to compare levels in acute and convalescent
patients. An increasing number of biochemical and molecular biological
techniques have been introduced, many of which rely on identifying bacterial
or viral nucleic acid in clinical specimens.
Infectious disease may be prevented by vaccination and public health measures
or treatment with drugs. Depending on the infectious agent, these may be
antiviral, antibacterial (antibiotics), antifungal or anthelminthic. Drugs may
be given singly, or in combinations, as, for example, in the treatment of HIV
patients.

QUESTIONS
1.

BrieÔ¨Çy review the causes of infections associated with the genital
tract.

2.

List some of the methods used in the diagnosis of infectious diseases.

3.

A 19-year-old student attended a barbecue to celebrate his brother‚Äôs
21st birthday. He ate a very rare steak. Two days late he began to
experience pains on defecation, and to suffer from persistent diarrhea
that rapidly increased in frequency and produced bloody stools. What
is the student suffering from? Suggest how this condition should be
treated.

4.

Examine Figure 3.27. To which antibiotics is this strain of Escherichia
coli resistant?

5.

Compare and contrast the actions of griseofulvin and albendazole.

4.1

INTRODUCTION

The immune system is a set of organs, tissues, cells and molecules that protect
the body from disease caused by microorganisms and multicellular parasites
(Chapter 2). Immunology is the study of the immune system and how it works.
Unraveling of the mechanisms of immune defense and the use of products of
the immune system in investigating and treating disease has revolutionized the
biomedical sciences in a way that is comparable to that of molecular biology
in recent years. This chapter describes the major components of the immune
system and explains how a coordinated immune response is produced against
infectious agents. In addition, the use of immunological techniques in the
biomedical sciences will be outlined.

THE IMMUNE SYSTEM

4.2

TYPES OF IMMUNE DEFENSE

The immune system has to distinguish between the cells and macromolecules
that make up the body that is, self, and those that are foreign or nonself.
Immunological defenses are usually classified as nonspecific and specific.
Nonspecific defenses constitute a first line of defense and are available
immediately any foreign material, including substances such as wood splinters
as well as microorganisms, enters the body. Nonspecific defenses include
responses such as inflammation, a rapid immediate response to tissue damage,
and the acute phase response, a relatively rapid response to infection. In
specific immunological defense, cells of the immune system recognize not just
individual microorganisms, but also the particular proteins or glycoproteins
found on that microorganism. This type of defense may take several days to
become effective, depending on whether the immune system was previously
exposed to that specific microorganism but, once activated, results in a longlasting immunity to it. This immunity can be humoral, in that it involves the
production of antibodies and/or cell-mediated, which involves the production
of cells that kill or recruit other cells to kill the infected cells. Humoral immunity
is effective against microorganisms that do not invade cells and this includes
most bacteria and multicellular parasites (Chapter 2). Cell-mediated immunity
is effective against intracellular parasites, including viruses and some bacteria.
However, these two types of specific immunity are not mutually exclusive and
usually both types are activated on exposure to the infectious agent.

4.3

NONSPECIFIC DEFENSES

Microorganisms are prevented from entering the body by structural barriers,
such as the skin and the mucosal membranes. These barriers are further
protected by chemical secretions, for example lactic acid in sebum and
hydrochloric acid secreted in the stomach. Furthermore, mucus, secreted by the
mucosal membranes that line the urogenital, respiratory and gastrointestinal
tracts, contains lysozyme, an antibacterial enzyme that catalyzes the hydrolysis
of the peptidoglycan wall of some types of bacteria. Should microorganisms
breach these barriers, other antimicrobial proteins such as complement and
interferons may be activated and/or produced. Finally, there are a number of
cells that have a role in the elimination of microorganisms. These cells may
be found in the blood, although a number are also found in the solid tissues.
Some blood cells move between the blood and the extravascular tissues,
particularly during an infection.

INTERFERONS
Interferons (IFNs) are families of inducible, secretory proteins produced by
eukaryotic cells in response to viral infections and other stimuli. They disrupt
viral replication in neighboring healthy cells by inducing those cells to produce
enzymes that inhibit replication of viral nucleic acid and the production of
viral proteins. There are three major families of interferons: IFNs @ A and F.
Interferons @ and A are produced by cells that have been infected with a virus.
They are the predominant forms produced by leukocytes and fibroblasts
respectively, although both types are produced by other viral infected cells
in the body. Interferon F is produced by cells of the specific immune system
in response to any agent, whether bacterium, virus or foreign protein, which
stimulates that system.
Interferons belong to a large family of proteins called cytokines, a general name
given to proteins secreted by cells that stimulate activities in other cells after
binding to receptors on their surfaces. Cytokines act at low concentrations and
may stimulate different activities depending on the type of target cell. Many

NONSPECIFIC DEFENSES

different cytokines are involved in the immune response and some are now
used therapeutically. Interferon @ has been used to treat hairy cell leukemia
and Kaposi‚Äôs sarcoma (Chapter 5), while IFN A is used in the treatment of
multiple sclerosis and IFN F has been used to treat several immune deficiency
diseases (Chapter 5). Cytokines are also involved in the pathology of a number
of diseases, particularly inflammatory disorders, such as rheumatoid arthritis
(Chapter 5).

COMPLEMENT
Complement is the name given to a set of about 30 plasma proteins, some
of which are listed in Table 4.1 and which, when activated, can combat an
infection by lysing the invading microorganisms, stimulating inflammation
and promoting the uptake of the microbe by phagocytic cells. Activation of
complement can be achieved in one of several ways. The classical pathway
is initiated when antibody binds to the microorganism. This pathway may
therefore take several days to become effective if specific antibody is not
already present. The classical pathway for activation initially involves
complement proteins C1‚ÄìC4 (Table 4.1). An alternative pathway can be
activated in the absence of antibody by cell wall components of bacteria, such
as lipopolysaccharide. This first line of defense against microorganisms uses
the complement proteins C3, and Factors B and D. Both pathways feed into a
common pathway involving complement proteins C5‚ÄìC9 that results in lysis
of the target cell (Figure 4.1). Both pathways also result in the production of
small peptides that induce phagocytosis and inflammation. The classical and
alternative pathways are described in more detail in Chapter 6. Complement
is also activated by C-reactive protein (CRP), and mannose-binding lectin
(MBL), both of which are plasma proteins produced by the liver during the
early or acute stage of an infection. Mannose-binding lectin is, as its name
implies, a protein that binds to mannose residues on bacteria. This activates
an associated protease that, in turn, activates proteins of the classical pathway.
Thus, it provides a means of entering the classical pathway in the absence of
antibody.
Complement is essential for immunological defense. Indeed, a deficiency
of just a single complement protein can lead to increased susceptibility
to bacterial infections. Complement is also involved in the pathology of a
number of immunological disorders, including autoimmune diseases, such
as rheumatoid arthritis and autoimmune hemolytic anemias (Chapter 5).

NONSPECIFIC CELLS
Leukocytes are the white blood cells (Chapter 13) produced from precursor
stem cells present in the bone marrow. All have immunological roles. About
80% of them are involved in nonspecific immune defense but the small
lymphocytes (Section 4.5) are the cells of the specific immune system whose
products control the numbers and activities of the nonspecific cells and so the
two systems are interlinked.

All leukocytes can be classified into one of two groups, the polymorphonuclear
leukocytes (PMN), which have lobed nuclei and granular cytoplasm, and
mononuclear leukocytes (MN) that have a more rounded nucleus (Figure
4.2). Polymorphonuclear leukocytes form approximately 65% of all blood
leukocytes. They are classified into three groups: neutrophils, basophils and
eosinophils.
Neutrophils, which make up around 60% of the blood leukocytes, are phagocytic
cells that ingest and kill bacteria. These cells have receptors for antibodies and
for the activated complement protein, C3b. Thus, neutrophils will bind readily
to bacteria coated with any of these proteins, and phagocytosis is promoted
(Figure 4.3). This phenomenon is known as opsonization. The killing of the

Basophils (Figure 4.2) are found in low numbers in the blood and usually form
less than 1% of the leukocytes present. Basophils promote inflammation.
They have prominent cytoplasmic granules which take up basic stains such
as toluidine blue, and contain an abundance of pharmacologically active
agents, such as histamine and heparin, and factors that are chemotactic for
other PMNs (Table 4.2). In addition, basophils have the capacity to synthesize
and secrete other mediators when appropriately stimulated. The primary,
that is granular, and secondary induced mediators are necessary to promote
and maintain inflammation and their inappropriate release can result in
immunological disorders such as hay fever and allergic asthma (Chapter 5).
Despite their relatively low numbers in the blood, basophils are essential
for initiating inflammation. However, a similar type of cell known as a mast
cell, which is found in solid tissues rather than blood, is of greater clinical
significance. Mast cells are found throughout the body but especially in the
skin, mucosal membranes and epithelia of the respiratory and gastrointestinal
tracts and in the connective tissue of a variety of internal organs. Mast cells
are highly granular and contain similar mediators to the basophil although
the granular contents may vary according to location. Mast cells also secrete
a number of cytokines, many of which are proinflammatory, that is they

promote inflammation. Both mast cells and basophils have receptors for a
particular class of antibody, known as immunoglobulin E (Section 4.4) and this
has significance in the pathology of some of the most common immunological
disorders, namely allergies (Chapter 5).
Like basophils, eosinophils are found in low numbers in the blood and
usually constitute less than 2% of white cells. They also have prominent
cytoplasmic granules but in this case they take up acidic stains, for example
eosin, because they contain highly basic proteins. Though capable of
phagocytosis, the major role of eosinophils is to assist in the elimination
of multicellular parasites such as tapeworms and nematodes (Chapter 2).
Eosinophils first bind to the surface of the helminth, often using antibodies
and then secrete their toxic granular proteins onto its surface. Eosinophils
can be attracted to areas of inflammation by chemotactic factors secreted by
basophils and mast cells.

MONONUCLEAR LEUKOCYTES
The mononuclear leukocytes comprise three distinct groups of cells:
monocytes and large granular lymphocytes (LGLs), which are nonspecific
cells, and small lymphocytes that are responsible for the specific immune
response.
Monocytes (Figure 4.2) make up approximately 5% of the blood leukocytes.
They have a characteristic indented, often horseshoe-shaped nucleus and
a granular cytoplasm. Monocytes are immature cells that circulate for
only a matter of hours before they enter the solid tissues and develop into
macrophages. The spleen, lungs, liver, lymph nodes and tonsils contain
especially high numbers of macrophages. Monocytes and macrophages are
phagocytic cells, clearing the blood and solid tissues of microbes as well
as dead or dying host cells, including neutrophils and erythrocytes. Their
numbers and generalized distribution ensure they effectively clear foreign
material. Macrophages have killing mechanisms similar to those found in
neutrophils and can be stimulated by target cells coated with antibodies and/or
complement proteins. Following phagocytosis of microorganisms, especially
bacteria, they secrete a range of cytokines, including interleukins 1 (IL-1), 6
(IL-6) and 8 (IL-8) and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF @) Interleukin 1, IL6 and TNF-@ are proinflammatory and are responsible for initiating events in
the early or acute phase of infection, while IL-8 is a chemokine that attracts
neutrophils to its source.
Monocytes and macrophages also play significant roles in the specific immune
response since they are able to ‚Äòprocess‚Äô foreign material and ‚Äòpresent‚Äô it to
certain types of small lymphocyte in a form they can recognize. As such, they
are known as antigen presenting cells (APC), although they are not the only
cells to carry out this activity.
Large granular lymphocytes (LGL) make up 5‚Äì10% of the blood leukocytes.
These cells have rounded nuclei and a granular cytoplasm (Figure
4.2). Functionally, LGL represent a mixed population of cells: some are
natural killer (NK) cells that kill virus-infected cells and some tumor cells
nonspecifically. Natural killer cells bind to the target cell and release proteins,
some of which perforate the target cell membrane while others induce a
genetically programmed cell death called apoptosis. Natural killer cells are
the first line of defense against viruses since they prevent their replication and
spread. They may also form a defense against potential tumors by destroying
some cancerous cells as they arise in the body (Chapter 17).

INFLAMMATION AND THE ACUTE PHASE RESPONSE

responses to infection and tissue damage. Acute inflammation will be used

Infection

here to describe the body‚Äôs immediate and localized response to tissue
damage. However, should an infection arise as a result of damage to tissue,
acute inflammation can merge with the acute phase response, which is a
whole body response that occurs within a few hours of an infection entering
the body. The acute phase response involves the production of a number of
chemical mediators that promote and prolong local inflammation. In addition,
chronic infection can lead to chronic inflammation together with a prolonged
acute phase response. This potentially confusing series of overlapping events
is clarified in Figure 4.4.
Inflammation is a rapid local response to tissue damage, as would happen, for
example, if the skin is scratched by a thorn. The response is characterized by
reddening and swelling of the skin as well as sensations of heat and pain at the
damaged site. Inflammation is initiated by the release of mediators, especially
histamine, from mast cells in the damaged area (Figure 4.5). Histamine
causes blood vessels to dilate and become leaky so that plasma escapes into
the damaged tissue where it dilutes any noxious agents that entered at the
damaged site, and helps to wash them away into the lymph (Section 4.5). If
bacteria enter the damaged area they activate complement to release proteins
that are chemotactic to neutrophils, encouraging them to move out of the
blood between the lining endothelial cells.

The acute phase response occurs within hours of exposure to microorganisms.
This is a systemic response involving the whole body and several organ systems.
The response is brought about by cytokines, including IL-1, IL-6 and TNF @
released by monocytes and macrophages. An acute phase response results in
changes in the composition of the blood, including an increased neutrophil
count and the appearance of, or increase in, a number of defense proteins
called acute phase proteins. The appearance in the blood of a particular
protein, C-reactive protein (CRP), which binds to bacteria and activates
complement, is often used as a marker of infection. The plasma concentration
of CRP prior to an acute phase response is so low as to be barely measurable;
thereafter its synthesis increases 100‚Äì1000 fold.
The acute phase response is a primary defense against infection, with
multiple beneficial effects. However, it has the potential to cause harm if an
infection is prolonged. For example, acute phase proteins are synthesized in
the liver from amino acids released by the enzyme catalyzed proteolysis of
muscle tissues. Following an acute infection, this muscle protein is rapidly
replaced. However, a chronic infection, such as tuberculosis, can result
in severe and prolonged muscle wastage, a condition known as cachexia
(Chapters 10 and 17). High body temperature, or fever, is another symptom
of the acute phase response. While elevated body temperatures may inhibit
the replication of bacteria, fever can be dangerous, especially in children, if
the temperature becomes too high.

SPECIFIC IMMUNE RESPONSES

4.4

SPECIFIC IMMUNE RESPONSES

The specific immune response allows the development of true immunity to
an infectious agent. Since true immunity can only develop after exposure
to the virulent microorganism or a harmless vaccine derived from it, the
response is often called acquired immunity. For example, an individual who
has had measles is unlikely to suffer that disease again, even though exposure
to the virus may occur subsequently even after many years. Two major
features define a specific immune response. First, specific immunity is only
induced towards the agent, called the immunogen, which stimulated it and

BOX 4.1 Vaccination
The process of protecting people from infection by deliberately
exposing them to microbial components was initiated in modern
times by Jenner (1749‚Äì1823) in 1796, when he showed that
immunity to smallpox, which is caused by the Variola virus,
was induced by the introduction into the skin of material from
the crusts of cowpox lesions. This process became known as
vaccination, from the Latin vacca, a cow, a term which is still
used today. In this case, immunization with the cowpox virus
induced immunity that cross-reacted with the variola virus,
because the viruses share some molecular similarities. Crossreactions between vaccines are quite rare and most vaccines are
usually speciÔ¨Åc for only one type of microorganism.
Since Jenner‚Äôs time, vaccination has been widely applied to
protect people from many serious infections. Vaccination against
smallpox became compulsory in several developed countries
from the 1900s to the 1940s and the WHO embarked on an
eradication program, using the cross-reacting Vaccinia virus
(Figure 4.6) as a vaccine. This program was deemed successful
in 1980, the last case of smallpox having been reported in 1977.
With this success, the WHO also embarked on a program to
eradicate polio by world-wide vaccination but this has not yet
been achieved.
Traditional vaccines to induce immunity to microorganisms
include the use of attenuated viruses, such as polio, measles,
mumps, killed bacteria, for example whooping cough, toxoids,
which are derived from bacterial toxins, for example those of
tetanus and diphtheria and bacterial cell wall polysaccharides
from, for example, Neisseria meningitidis serogroup A (Chapter
2). More recent developments include recombinant subunit
vaccines. Here the vaccine is a microbial protein that has
been produced by genetically engineered eukaryotic cells. An
example of this is the vaccine for hepatitis B, which consists
of a viral surface protein produced by the recombinant yeast,
Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Other recent developments in
vaccine production include polysaccharide conjugate vaccines in
which a bacterial polysaccharide is conjugated to a protein, in
order to stimulate a more potent immune response. Examples
of polysaccharide conjugate vaccines include those for
Haemophilus inÔ¨Çuenzae and Neisseria meningitidis serogroup
C. Where several strains of a microorganism are known to cause
disease, multivalent vaccines containing components from

CZhhVg6]bZY!BVjgZZc9Vlhdc!8]g^hHb^i]:YLddY

a number of strains may be used. The newest development
in vaccine production is the DNA vaccine, which consists of
plasmid DNA containing a gene coding for the microbial
protein in question. This DNA is injected intramuscularly and is
taken up by the muscle cells. For a limited period the gene is
transcribed and translated to form the foreign protein, which
stimulates the immune response in situ. Several DNA vaccines
are currently in clinical trial.
At present there are no successful vaccines in routine use against
protozoa, including the malarial parasites (Chapter 2) that infect
300‚Äì500 million annually and kill two to three million people
worldwide each year. Such organisms have very complex life
cycles, often with secondary animal hosts and often accompanied
by distinct antigenic changes, which divert the immune system.
In 2005, a new vaccine against malaria was tested on a group
of over 2000 children in Mozambique. This vaccine is aimed at
the sporozoite form of the parasite, which is the form injected
into humans by mosquitoes, and has been shown to cut the risk
of developing severe malaria by 58%.

Margin Note 4.2 Haptens

i

Some molecules, such as steroid
hormones, are too small to stimulate
a speciÔ¨Åc immune response.
However, if such molecules
are attached covalently to an
immunogenic protein they can be
recognized by the immune system
and an immune response will then
be mounted against them. In this
case, the small molecule is called a
hapten and the protein to which it is
attached the carrier. The ability of the
immune system to recognize small
molecules when they are presented
in the appropriate context has proved
extremely useful as it is possible to
produce antibodies to a wide range
of smaller molecules. The antibodies
can then be used in speciÔ¨Åc assays
to determine the presence and
concentration of the hapten in
biological samples (Box 4.2). For
example, assays for steroid hormones
use antibodies that have been
produced in animals by immunizing
them with the steroid linked to a
protein.

THE IMMUNE SYSTEM

secondly, the specific immune response is more rapid following subsequent
contacts with that same immunogen. It is the rapid secondary response that
prevents the development of disease in the immune individual. The ability
to produce a quicker response on second contact with an immunogen is
known as immunological memory. This process is mimicked by the use of
vaccines, where an attenuated or less virulent strain of the microorganism is
administered to induce immunity without causing the disease.
The body‚Äôs specific response to an infectious agent such as rubella virus,
the cause of German measles, is to respond with two types of immunity,
that is, humoral immunity and cell-mediated immunity. A specific immune
response is only stimulated by an immunogen, which may be the whole
microorganism but could merely be a protein, glycoprotein or lipoprotein. As
a general rule, proteins with a Mr greater than 5000‚Äì10 000 are immunogenic.
Polysaccharides are usually only weakly immunogenic, although they
generally become more immunogenic when conjugated to a protein.
Cells of the specific immune system do not recognize the whole immunogen
but, rather, small regions of immunogenic macromolecules known as epitopes.
Usually, epitopes are sequences of 5‚Äì7 amino acid residues on immunogenic
proteins, but they may also be short sequences of sugar residues in a
polysaccharide, lipopolysaccharide or glycoprotein. A large macromolecule
may have many epitopes that are recognized by the immune system. However,
a protein that has some similarities with our own proteins, for example bovine
serum albumin that has a similar size and structure to human albumin, will
have fewer nonself regions recognizable as epitopes.
The term antigen is often confused with an immunogen and, indeed, some
textbooks use the terms interchangeably. Here, an antigen is defined as
something that will bind to the product of an immune response, such as
an antibody. Nowadays the term is most commonly used when discussing
immunotechniques, where an antibody is used to detect an antigen or quantify
how much of it is present in a sample (Box 4.2).

ROLES OF HUMORAL AND CELL-MEDIATED IMMUNITY
Most immunogens stimulate both humoral and cell-mediated immunity.
Antibodies are found in body fluids, including blood and lymph, and have
access to extracellular organisms. They are therefore most effective at
eliminating microorganisms that live outside the cells of the host. Cellmediated immunity, on the other hand, is effective against intracellular
parasites, which includes all viruses and a number of intracellular bacteria,
such as Mycobacterium tuberculosis and Listeria monocytogenes. However,
antibodies are useful in protecting cells in the initial stages of a viral infection
and in preventing the spread of viruses from one cell to another.

In a humoral response, the immune system produces specific glycoproteins
called antibodies that are found in the blood plasma, mostly in the F globulin
fraction (Figure 4.7), in lymph and in body secretions such as saliva, tears,
mucus and milk. Antibodies have binding sites that are complementary to the
shape of an epitope. These sites allow antibodies to bind to the epitopes of the
immunogen and initiate its destruction by a variety of other agents, such as
complement, phagocytic cells and LGLs. Collectively, antibodies are known as
immunoglobulins (Igs) which are heterogeneous molecules indeed because
each antibody is specific for an individual epitope. Despite this heterogeneity,
they can be divided into one of five major classes or isotypes, IgG, IgM, IgA, IgE
and IgD, based on differences in their structures, and particularly in the amino
acid sequences of their largest polypeptide subunits which are known as heavy
chains (see below). Some of their properties are listed in Table 4.3.

Immunoglobulin G

B)

Immunoglobulin G (IgG) is the most abundant antibody in the blood where it is
found at concentrations of approximately 13.5 mg cm‚Äì3. It is evenly distributed
between the vascular and extravascular compartments. In humans, IgG occurs
as four subclasses, all with slightly different properties and roles in the body.
For example, all subclasses except IgG4 can activate complement (Table 4.3).
Immunoglobulin G is produced after IgM on exposure to an immunogen and
is the predominant antibody produced on a second exposure, that is in the
secondary response. It is also the only antibody in humans that can cross the
placenta to allow maternal antibodies to protect the developing fetus from
infection. On some occasions, this may cause problems as, for example, when
the mother has become sensitized to fetal antigens or has an autoimmune
disease (Chapter 5).
Immunoglobulin G is a symmetrical molecule consisting of four polypeptide
chains joined by disulfide bonds as shown in Figure 4.8(A). The four chains

light chains each with a Mr of 25 000. Both heavy and light chains have a domain
structure. A domain is a globular region made up of approximately 110 amino
acid residues and stabilized by an intrachain disulfide bond (Figure 4.9). The

The interchain disulfide links between the two heavy chains and between
the light and the heavy chains (Figure 4.8 (A)) produce two units, called the
Fab, or fragment antigen binding, part of which can recognize and bind to
an epitope (Figure 4.8 (C)). The remainder of the molecule, consisting only
of the carboxyl terminal halves of the heavy chains is known as the Fc, or
fragment crystallizable, portion. The Fc region is concerned with complement
activation, placental transfer and binding to LGL and phagocytes.

Immunoglobulin M
Immunoglobulin M (IgM) is the largest of the antibodies with a Mr of about
900 000. Its concentration in the plasma is roughly 1.5 mg cm‚Äì3, which is
approximately 10% of the plasma immunoglobulins. Most IgM is vascular,
with little present in lymph or secretions. Immunoglobulin M is always the
first antibody to be produced during an immune response and is also the
predominant one formed when an immunogen is encountered for the first
time, that is, during a primary response (Figure 4.10). The structure of IgM is
shown in Figure 4.11 (A). Four polypeptide chains form a structure somewhat
similar to that of IgG but this four-chain structure is repeated five times. The
five units are joined by their Fc portions by a J chain. Thus, each molecule of
IgM has ten binding sites, the largest number of any of the antibody classes.
Immunoglobulin M is efficient at agglutinating cells or clumping them
together, and is an effective activator of complement.

Immunoglobulin A
Immunoglobulin A (IgA) is found in plasma at concentrations between 0.5‚Äì
3.0 mg cm‚Äì3 but is also the major antibody found in body secretions, including
mucus, saliva and tears. Thus, it protects mucosal surfaces. In humans,
most plasma IgA occurs in the familiar four chain structure, similar to IgG

days to several weeks. Despite its low plasma concentrations, IgE is a potent
stimulator of inflammation, since binding of epitopes to mast-cell bound
antibody can trigger degranulation of these cells. The proinflammatory nature
of IgE is seen in the elimination of multicellular parasites, such as tapeworms
and nematodes. However, in susceptible individuals, this antibody can also
trigger an inflammatory response to otherwise harmless immunogens, such
as pollen, resulting in allergic reactions (Chapter 5).

Immunoglobulin D
Immunoglobulin D (IgD) is found in plasma at a concentration of about 30
Lg cm‚Äì3. Its role as a secreted antibody is uncertain. Hyperimmunoglobulin D
syndrome (HIDS), in which IgD levels are increased, is associated with periodic
fever and joint disease. However, IgD does have a role in the recognition of
epitopes by cells of the specific immune system (Section 4.6).
The concentration of immunoglobulins shown above for all the
immunoglobulins represents their mean plasma concentrations. During

BOX 4.2 Immunoassay
As well as being molecules of major signiÔ¨Åcance in protecting the
body from infection, antibodies are also powerful reagents for
detecting and quantifying antigens. The speciÔ¨Åcity of antibodies
allows biomedical scientists to measure the level of an analyte,
such as a steroid hormone, in biological Ô¨Çuids such as plasma,
which contain hundreds of other biomolecules, some of which
may be very similar to the analyte being measured. The use of
antibodies to quantify antigens is called immunoassay and
immunoassays are used in all branches of the biomedical sciences.
Some immunoassays are among the most sensitive assays known,
detecting antigens in the range of mg cm‚Äì3 to pg cm‚Äì3.
One of the earliest immunoassays developed is known as radial
immunodiffusion (RID). This method relies on the ability of
antibodies to precipitate soluble protein antigens. Antibody is
incorporated evenly into an agar gel and a measured volume
of antigen solution is added to wells cut into the agar. As the
antigen diffuses into the agar the reaction with antibody forms a
circle of precipitation (Figure 4.12). After allowing all the antigen
to diffuse, which takes about 72 h, the diameter of this precipitin
ring is measured. The antigen concentration is proportional to
the square of the diameter so that the concentration of the
unknown can be determined from a standard curve produced
using known antigen concentrations.
Radial immunodiffusion is a simple and reliable method, which
can be used, for example, to measure the concentrations of a
number of serum proteins. However, it is not a sensitive method,
suitable for determining concentrations in the Lg cm‚Äì3 to mg
cm‚Äì3 range, and takes several days before the result can be read.
Nephelometry is another technique which detects precipitation,

infection, concentrations increase as humoral immunity is activated.
Levels significantly above the normal range for the appropriate age group
are associated with myeloma, a cancer of antibody-producing cells or with
infection with Epstein Barr virus. Concentrations significantly below the
normal range are associated with immunodeficiency disorders (Chapter 5).

CELL-MEDIATED IMMUNITY
Cell-mediated immunity (CMI) involves the direct and indirect destruction of
host cells infected by viruses or other intracellular parasitic microorganisms,
such as rickettsias (Chapter 2). The direct destruction of infected cells is
brought about by the production of specific cytotoxic cells that are capable
of killing any such infected cell that induced their formation. Indirect
destruction is brought about by the release of cytokines that promote
destruction by macrophages and LGLs. This type of immunity forms the
major defense against viral infections since the destruction of virus-infected
host cells prevents the replication and spread of the virus.

but in solution rather than in agar. It relies on the ability of
precipitates formed by an antibody reacting with a protein
antigen to scatter a beam of light passed through it. Scattered
light is detected at right angles to the original light source. This
method is much more rapid than RID, although optically clear
antibodies must be used. Other methods, which use ‚Äòlabeled‚Äô
reagents, are much more sensitive and can be used to measure
nonprotein antigens. In addition, results from these assays can be
obtained within hours rather than days. The Ô¨Årst of these labeled
reagent techniques to be developed was radioimmunoassay (RIA),
which was devised in 1960, but is still used extensively. Radioimmunoassay relies on the competition between radiolabeled
and unlabeled antigen for a limited amount of antibody. The
more unlabeled antigen (standard or unknown) there is in a
sample, the less radioactive antigen will bind to the antibody.
Radioimmunoassays are extremely sensitive, measuring routinely
in the pg cm‚Äì3 to Lg cm‚Äì3 range.
Enzyme immunoassays (EIA) rely on the use of an enzymelabeled antibody to measure an antigen. The enzyme used is
one that will convert a colorless substrate into a colored soluble
product that can be measured spectrophotometrically. The most
frequently used enzyme labels are horseradish peroxidase and
alkaline phosphatase and the most common EIA is the enzymelinked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The simplest ELISA format
is to allow a protein antigen to adsorb onto the wells of a plastic
microtiter plate (Figure 4.13). An enzyme labeled antibody is then
added which binds to the antigen in the wells. Wells containing
a large amount of antigen will contain more antibody, and
therefore more enzyme. The substrate for the enzyme is then
added and, after a limited period, the reaction is stopped and

of ELISA which allow the measurement of nonprotein antigens,
or which allow the sensitivity to be increased to that approaching

SMALL LYMPHOCYTES

Small lymphocytes are the cells responsible for specific immunity (Figure
4.2). They make up approximately 20% of the blood leukocytes. There are two
populations of small lymphocytes that mature at different sites in the body
and have distinct functions (Figure 4.14).

of small (B and T) lymphocytes.

The precursors of small lymphocytes originate in the bone marrow by
division of lymphoid stem cells. Some small lymphocytes remain in the
bone marrow where they mature into B lymphocytes. When maturation is
complete, B lymphocytes have antibodies on their surface that are receptors
for an individual epitope. Thus a single B lymphocyte is specific for an
epitope and is capable of clonal division and of making antibody to it when
stimulated appropriately by the immunogen. Thus they are responsible for
humoral immunity. The second population of small lymphocytes, known as
T lymphocytes, leave the bone marrow when immature and complete their
maturation in the fetal thymus, a bilobed organ situated just above the heart.
During their development in the thymus, T lymphocytes first acquire specificity
for an epitope, by producing a cell surface receptor. They then mature into
one of two T cell subsets. Cells of the first subset are known as cytotoxic
precursors or TC cells. When appropriately stimulated, TC cells develop into
cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) that are capable of killing virus-infected cells.
Cells of the second subset of T cells are the helper T lymphocytes or TH cells.
When stimulated by an immunogen, TH cells develop into cytokine-secreting
TH cells that produce an array of cytokines that control the activities of both
specific and nonspecific cells of the immune system. Thus TH cells have a
central role in the regulation of all immune responses.
When mature, both B and T lymphocytes are released into the circulation.
However, small lymphocytes are not confined to the blood and many move
into the lymphoid tissues: the spleen, lymph nodes, tonsils and the mucosaassociated lymphoid tissues found in the respiratory, gastrointestinal
and urogenital tracts. Small lymphocytes constantly move between the
blood and the lymphoid systems, a phenomenon known as recirculation.
The route of this recirculatory process is shown in Figure 4.15. Lymph is
the fluid that drains from the tissues into small lymphatic vessels. These
merge with larger lymphatic vessels, the largest of which, the thoracic duct,
delivers the lymph to the blood at its junction with the left subclavian vein.
En route to the thoracic duct, lymph is filtered through many lymph nodes.
Small lymphocytes circulating in the blood are able to move between the

endothelial cells lining the blood vessels that supply the lymph nodes.
These blood vessels have a specialized endothelium which aids this process.
By crossing the blood vessel wall, the small lymphocytes enter the lymph
node and from this they enter the lymphatics and, eventually, return to the
blood.

4.6

PRODUCTION OF A SPECIFIC IMMUNE RESPONSE

All small lymphocytes are specific for a single epitope on an individual
immunogen. This means that they will respond only to that epitope and no
other. The basis of this specificity depends on lymphocyte membrane proteins
that act as receptors for individual epitopes. The receptors on B lymphocytes
are surface immunoglobulins that have the same specificity as the antibody
that the cells will subsequently secrete following appropriate stimulation. The
surface antibodies on a single cell may belong to more than one class, so, for
example, B lymphocytes may express both IgG and monomeric IgM, but these
will have identical specificities. The T cell receptor (TCR) is composed of two
polypeptide chains that form a single binding site. All the receptors on a single
T cell have the same specificity.
Although T and B cells have different types of receptor and are involved in
different aspects of the immune response, there are some similarities in
the way they are activated and respond to a specific epitope. For example
when both B and T lymphocytes are exposed to an appropriate epitope they
enter a series of cell divisions that result in the production of a clone of cells
of identical specificity (Figure 4.16). These cell divisions require cytokines
that are produced and secreted by TH lymphocytes once they have been
appropriately stimulated. Most of the cells in the clone of small lymphocytes
then differentiate into effector cells, the nature of which depends on the
type of small lymphocyte that was stimulated. Not all the cells in the clone
differentiate at this stage. Some remain as memory cells, awaiting the next
exposure to the same immunogen when a faster and quantitatively greater
response is produced.

BOX 4.3 Distinguishing T and B lymphocytes
In a standard stained blood smear, all small lymphocytes appear
similar and it is not possible to distinguish between B and T
lymphocytes, or between the TC and TH cells. However, these
cells can be distinguished by staining for marker proteins in the
membranes of these cells. Different markers that can be used to
distinguish T and B lymphocytes are shown in Table 4.4.
The
marker
molecules
can
be
distinguished
by
immunohistochemistry, in which a labeled antibody is
used to stain the cells. One of the commonest labels used is a
Ô¨Çuorescent molecule, such as Ô¨Çuorescein, which produces an
apple-green colored Ô¨Çuorescence when irradiated with light of
short wavelengths.
B lymphocytes can be stained with an anti-immunoglobulin
carrying a conjugated Ô¨Çuorescein label. This binds to the cell
surface immunoglobulin, so that the B lymphocyte Ô¨Çuoresces
when examined with a Ô¨Çuorescence microscope. All mature T
lymphocytes can be identiÔ¨Åed by the CD3 protein carried on
their surface. Staining usually involves an indirect method that

CZhhVg6]bZY!BVjgZZc9Vlhdc!8]g^hHb^i]:YLddY

is a two-stage process. This involves incubating the lymphocytes
with an unconjugated anti-CD3 antibody, which is a monoclonal
antibody originating in mice (Box 4.4). This is then followed
by the second stage involving incubation with a Ô¨Çuoresceinconjugated antibody to the mouse immunoglobulin bound to
the CD3 proteins on the T lymphocyte surface (Figure 4.17). The
cells can then be distinguished by their Ô¨Çuorescence. Similarly,
TH and TC cells can be stained and identiÔ¨Åed using anti-CD4 and
anti-CD8 antibodies respectively.
Fluorescent labeled antibody techniques, known as
immunoÔ¨Çuorescence, have been in use since the 1950s. They
are easy to perform and reliable, although the preparations are
not permanent as the Ô¨Çuorescent label tends to bleach, and they
need to be examined soon after the test has been performed.
In addition, they require the use of Ô¨Çuorescence microscopes
although lymphocyte samples can also be quantiÔ¨Åed using a
Ô¨Çow cytometer, which is usually available in major laboratories
that deal with multiple samples on a regular basis.

Labels other than Ô¨Çuorochromes are available, which

and the use of an ordinary light microscope. For
example, antibodies labeled with an enzyme, such

substrate into an insoluble colored compound

microscopically. This technique is called enzyme

PRODUCTION OF A SPECIFIC IMMUNE RESPONSE

HUMORAL IMMUNITY
The response of B lymphocytes to an immunogen is outlined in Figure 4.19.
Once the receptors on B lymphocyte bind to an epitope on the immunogen,
the lymphocyte is stimulated to divide and differentiate under the influence
of cytokines released from TH lymphocytes, to form a clone of antibodysecreting cells called plasma cells (Figure 4.20). Plasma cells are not found in
the blood of healthy individuals. Instead, they are present in the lymph nodes
and spleen, where they secrete antibodies until they die after a lifespan of a
few days to several months. Antibody secreted by plasma cells in lymph nodes
first appears in the lymph and then the blood, while antibody produced in the
spleen moves directly to the blood.
The class of antibody that is secreted depends, in part, on which B lymphocyte
was stimulated and on the cytokines that influenced its differentiation. Certain
cytokines are known to favor the production of antibodies of a particular class.
For example IL-4 promotes the production of IgE, and favors a response to
multicellular parasites. However, a predisposition to produce IgE may also
make that individual more susceptible to allergic reactions, such as hay fever
and allergic asthma, as will be discussed in Chapter 5.
Although Figure 4.19 illustrates a single B lymphocyte responding to a single
epitope on an immunogen to give rise to a single clone of plasma cells, in
reality an immunogen, such as a bacterium, contains numerous proteins each
of which may have hundreds of epitopes. Thus, a humoral immune response
involves the stimulation of many B lymphocytes, each of which can proliferate
into a clone. Although each clone produces only a single type of antibody,
called a monoclonal antibody, hundreds of clones are formed so that the
response of the system is polyclonal, resulting in a heterogeneous array of
antibodies appearing in the blood.

THE IMMUNE SYSTEM

BOX 4.4 Monoclonal antibodies
Each clone of plasma cells produces homogeneous or monoclonal
antibody that is speciÔ¨Åc for a single epitope. In 1975, Kohler and
Milstein, working at Cambridge, developed a technique whereby
plasma cells could be immortalized producing a speciÔ¨Åed
monoclonal antibody so that they could be cultured indeÔ¨Ånitely.
The technique, outlined in Figure 4.21, involves immunizing
mice with the immunogen in question. After the required
immunization protocol, the mouse spleen containing antibodysecreting plasma cells is removed and gently homogenized
to form a suspension of single cells. The plasma cells are then
fused with cultured cells derived from a mouse myeloma, that is
a plasma cell tumor, the cells of which are immortal. The fusing
agent, or fusogen, is polyethylene glycol (PEG). The resulting cells
are known as hybrid myelomas, or, more frequently hybridomas
and are, like their myeloma progenitor, essentially immortal
when grown in suspension. Since the fusogen is indiscriminate
in its actions, the cell suspension also contains hybrids consisting
of plasma cell‚Äìplasma cell and myeloma‚Äìmyeloma cell fusions.
While the plasma‚Äìplasma cell fusions die within a short time
in culture, the myeloma‚Äìmyeloma fusions and any unfused
myeloma cells have to be selectively removed, as they would
quickly outgrow the hybridomas. The commonest selection
procedure involves using a myeloma cell lacking hypoxanthine
guanine phosphoribosyl transferase (HGPRT) activity and
growing the resulting hybridomas in medium containing
hypoxanthine, aminopterin and thymidine (HAT medium) for a
period after hybridization. Aminopterin inhibits dihydrofolate
reductase (DHFR), which is essential for the synthesis of DNA.
Cells that possess HGPRT can overcome this block by using
HGPRT and thymidine kinase (TK), as long as they are supplied
with hypoxanthine and thymidine. Thus, hybridoma cells, which
have HGPRT, supplied by the plasma cells, and TK activities survive
in HAT medium but myeloma cells do not.
A suspension of fused cells produced from a single mouse spleen
may contain millions of hybridoma cells derived from different
clones. To produce monoclonal antibodies, individual hybridoma
cells need to be isolated and grown individually. Isolation is
achieved by diluting the cell suspension to such a degree that
there is a high degree of certainty that aliquots will contain only
a single hybridoma cell. Such aliquots can then be grown on
in culture to produce a clone, which will secrete a monoclonal
antibody.
Monoclonal antibodies have widespread uses in the diagnosis
and treatment of disease. They can be used in immunoassays (Box
4.2) to measure the concentrations of biomolecules in clinical
samples. For example, commercial monoclonal antibodies to
hormones such as thyroxine, estrogen, and testosterone can be
used to conÔ¨Årm suspected hormonal deÔ¨Åciencies (Chapter 7). In
addition, monoclonal antibodies to cancer associated antigens
can be used to screen for cancers or to monitor the treatment of
cancers. An example of such an antigen is the prostate-speciÔ¨Åc
antigen (PSA) which is elevated in the blood of patients with
benign hyperplasia of the prostate gland, prostatitis and tumors
of the prostate gland (Chapter 17).

Monoclonal antibodies have been used in clinical trials for
treating autoimmune diseases and a variety of malignancies.
Since most monoclonal antibodies are mouse immunoglobulins,
they need to be ‚Äòhumanized‚Äô by linking the mouse Fab region to
a human Fc portion so that they are less likely to be recognized
as foreign protein by the immune system when injected.
The monoclonal antibody, MRA, is a humanized antibody to
the human IL-6 receptor, which began clinical trials in 2005
for the treatment of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), an
autoimmune disease (Chapter 5).

PRODUCTION OF A SPECIFIC IMMUNE RESPONSE

Activation of T lymphocytes
The manner in which T lymphocytes recognize foreign epitopes is rather more
complex than that used by their B lymphocyte counterparts, as the receptors
on T cells are unable to bind to epitopes on ‚Äònative‚Äô proteins. Instead, peptides
derived from the foreign protein are ‚Äòpresented‚Äô to them on the surfaces of
other host cells, bound to membrane proteins encoded by a genetic region
called the Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC). In humans, this genetic
region is found on chromosome 6. The proteins encoded by the MHC include
two classes of membrane proteins. Class I proteins are found on all nucleated
cells in the body. They consist of a single polypeptide, the @ chain, which is
associated with a smaller protein called A2 microglobulin (A2M) that is not
encoded within the MHC. Class II proteins are found on only a few cell types
and are made up of two polypeptides, @ and A, both encoded within the MHC.
Both Class I and II proteins have grooves that can bind a foreign peptide in an
extended form (Figures 4.22 and 4.23). The peptide-binding groove is formed
by the @1 and @2 domains of the Class I molecule and the @1 and A1 domains
of the Class II molecule, while these structures are supported, in the Class I
molecule by the @3 domain and the A2M, and in the Class II molecules by the
@2 and A2 domains.

The requirement to have foreign peptides presented by different MHC
molecules to TC and TH cells can be explained by looking at their roles in vivo.

Activation of TC cells
The role of TC cells is, ultimately, to destroy virus-infected cells. Since all
nucleated cells are susceptible to such infections, MHC encoded Class I
molecules are required by these cells to present endogenously produced
viral peptides to TC cells. Thus, viral protein produced within the cytoplasm
of an infected cell may be hydrolyzed to produce short peptides, about 8‚Äì12
amino acid residues in length. These peptides are then transported across the
endoplasmic reticulum where they become attached to Class I proteins and
the complex transported to the surface of the cell membrane in Golgi vesicles.

THE IMMUNE SYSTEM

The TC cell is activated when the T cell receptor recognizes the complex of MHC
Class I protein with its bound virus derived peptide and binds to it (Figure 4.24
(A) and (B)). An accessory protein, CD8, is also involved in this interaction as
it also binds to the MHC protein. Once bound, the TC cell is stimulated into
a series of mitotic divisions to form a clone of cells, which then differentiate
into cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL). These cells resemble TC cells but their
cytoplasm is more granular, owing to the presence of vesicles containing
cytotoxic proteins called granzymes and perforins. The CTL binds to a virus
infected cell using the same mechanism as the Tc cell, and then releases these
cytotoxic proteins which destroy the target cell. Cytotoxic T lymphocytes also
release IL-2 and IFN F which stimulate NK cells and macrophages to kill virus
infected cells.

Activation of TH cells
When stimulated by an immunogen, TH cells secrete cytokines required for
specific and nonspecific immune responses. Thus they are required for an
effective immune response to the whole range of infectious agents, from
viruses to multicellular parasites. In order to activate a TH cell, an immunogen
has to be taken up by an antigen presenting cell (APC). Here, its proteins are
hydrolyzed within endocytic vesicles and the resulting peptides of 12‚Äì19 amino
acid residues are attached to MHC encoded Class II proteins and transported

.'

PRODUCTION OF A SPECIFIC IMMUNE RESPONSE

to the cell membrane. The MHC Class II protein and foreign peptide complex
is recognized and bound by a TCR (Figure 4.25). The coreceptor protein, CD4,
also binds to the MHC protein. Several different types of cells can act as APCs,
including monocytes, macrophages, dendritic cells in the lymphoid tissues
and Langerhans cells of skin. However, under certain conditions, other cells,
including epithelial cells, can be induced to express MHC Class II proteins
and it has been proposed that such cells may initiate autoimmune reactions
(Chapter 5).
When a TH cell is stimulated by the MHC class II protein‚Äìpeptide complex
on the surface of an APC, it is stimulated to proliferate and differentiate
into cells that actively secrete cytokines. The cytokines include growth and
differentiation factors that stimulate B and T cells, hemopoietic factors, as
well as factors that stimulate mast cells, macrophages and eosinophils.
There are two subsets of TH cells, called TH1 and TH2. They differ in the profile
of cytokines they secrete as shown in Table 4.5. Cytokines produced by TH1
favor the development of cell-mediated immunity, which is used to destroy
intracellular parasites such as viruses. Those produced by TH2 cells stimulate
humoral immunity to extracellular parasites, including most bacteria and
helminth worms and flukes. In addition, cytokines produced by TH1 inhibit
TH2 cells and vice versa.

SUMMARY

CASE STUDY 4.1
Maria is a 28-year-old biology teacher who suspected she
might be pregnant as it was now eight weeks since the
start of her last period. Her pregnancy was confirmed
when she carried out a home pregnancy test. Maria
and her partner were delighted and began to make
plans for the future. However, Maria became concerned
when, during the eighth week of her pregnancy, several
children in one of her classes developed German measles
(rubella). Maria knew that, if she developed rubella,
there was a high risk that the baby would be harmed.
Unfortunately, she could not remember if and when she
had ever been immunized against rubella. She consulted
her family doctor who took a blood sample and had it

tested for antibodies. The test revealed that Maria‚Äôs blood
was positive for IgM antibodies specific for rubella but no
IgG antibodies specific for rubella were detected.
Questions
(a)

What are the consequences of this result for the
unborn baby?

(b)

Why would the consequences be different if IgG
antibodies specific for rubella had been detected?

(c)

SUMMARY

The basis of the actions of the immune system is its ability to distinguish self
from nonself. It defends the body in a variety of nonspecific and specific ways.
Nonspecific defenses include structural barriers and complement. Specific
defenses are the development of immune responses against infectious
agents. An effective immune response results from the complex interaction
of nonspecific and specific cells. The nonspecific cells include the monocytes,
large granular lymphocytes and polymorphonuclear leukocytes found in
the blood. The specific cells are the small lymphocytes found in the blood
and lymphoid tissues. Nonspecific responses include inflammation and the
acute phase response, while specific responses include the production of
antibodies, known as humoral immunity, and the production of cytotoxic
cells, in the process known as cell-mediated immunity. Humoral immunity
is effective at dealing with extracellular bacteria and multicellular parasites,
while cell-mediated immunity is effective at killing cells infected with a virus.
Small lymphocytes are highly specific since they bear cell surface receptors for
epitopes found on foreign proteins. Small lymphocytes belong to one of two
major subsets, the B lymphocytes responsible for humoral immunity and the
T lymphocytes, some of which, the TC cells, can develop into cytotoxic cells,
while others, the TH cells, regulate immune responses through the secretion
of cytokines.
Antibodies are glycoproteins which are highly specific for epitopes. This
specificity has enabled them to be used in the detection and quantitation of
antigens, in highly sensitive techniques such as ELISA.

INTRODUCTION

A fully functioning immune system is essential for maintaining health
(Chapter 4) but, like all body systems, the immune system itself is subject to
many clinical disorders. Immunological disease can occur for one of three
reasons. Firstly, immunodeficiency diseases occur in individuals whose
immune systems are inadequate, perhaps due to the absence or malfunction
of essential components, making them susceptible to infectious disease and
even to certain types of cancer. Secondly, autoimmune diseases can occur as
a result of the immune system mounting an immune response against ‚Äòself‚Äô
components. Finally, immunological hypersensitivity occurs when immune
responses, often mounted against seemingly innocuous immunogens, result
in tissue damage. Indeed, immunological hypersensitivities are among the
commonest of immunological disorders. This chapter will examine the variety,
etiologies, diagnoses and treatments of these three groups of immunological
disorders.

DISORDERS OF THE IMMUNE SYSTEM

5.2

IMMUNODEFICIENCY DISEASES

Immunodeficiency diseases result from a failure of one or more components
of the immune system and may involve the absence or malfunction of organs,
cells or proteins of the immune system. Where the immunodeficiency results
from a direct defect within the immune system, the disease is classified as a
primary immunodeficiency (PID). All PIDs are inherited or have a genetic
component. Most, but not all, primary deficiencies are congenital, that is
are present from birth, although some do not manifest themselves until
later in life. Secondary immunodeficiencies (SIDs) arise as a consequence
of other conditions. For example, some viruses are associated with an
immunosuppression, which may be transient, as for example in measles, or
permanent, as in HIV infection. Conditions that can give rise to secondary
immunodeficiency are listed in Table 5.1. This chapter will concentrate on the
primary immunodeficiencies.

Contributing factor

Comments

Malnutrition

a proper functioning immune system requires a supply of
essential nutrients (Chapter 10 )

Physical trauma

for example extensive burns and surgery are associated with
an immunosuppression

Immunosuppressive drugs

drugs given to prevent transplant rejection (Chapter 6 );
chemotherapeutic therapy for cancer (Chapter 17 )

Infectious diseases

for example HIV (Chapter 2 ); measles; cytomegalovirus

Hematologic disease

for example myeloma (Chapter 4 ); leukemia (Chapter 17 )

Immaturity of immune system

for example in premature infants

Aging of the immune system

all body systems start to malfunction with aging, the immune
system is no different (Chapter 18 )

Metabolic and hereditary disorders

for example diabetes mellitus (Chapter 7 )

Stress

stress hormones, such as cortisol (Chapter 7 ) can be
immunosuppressive

Table 5.1 Some factors contributing to secondary immunodeÔ¨Åciency

Patients with immunodeficiency diseases invariably suffer infections
more frequently and with increased severity although the type of infection
depends to a large extent on the nature of the immune deficit. Some general
rules to guide diagnoses are given in Table 5.2. Other types of disorder may
also arise as a consequence of a PID. So, for example, deficiencies of some
complement proteins may lead to systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), an
autoimmune disorder (Section 5.2). Certain types of cancer, such as nonHodgkins lymphoma, a tumor of the lymph glands, and Kaposi‚Äôs sarcoma, a
tumor derived from blood vessels and which frequently shows in the skin, are
also more frequent in the immunodeficient patient, because these tumors are
linked to infections with certain viruses (Chapter 17).

PRIMARY IMMUNODEFICIENCY DISEASE
Primary immunodeficiencies are classified according to the site of the
immunological defect. The 100 or so inherited PIDs were classified into
eight groups or tables (Table 5.3) at a meeting of the International Union of
Immunological Societies in 2003.

Combined T and B deÔ¨Åciencies
Deficiencies that affect both B and T lymphocyte (Chapter 4) numbers and/
or their functions are life threatening. Such deficiencies are termed severe
combined immunodeficiency (SCID). The term SCID represents a group
of disorders associated with more than 20 different mutations and with a
frequency of between one in 50 000 and one in 500 000 births. As some forms
of SCID are inherited in an X-linked fashion (Chapter 15), more boys than girls
are affected, with the male : female ratio of approximately 3 : 1.
Depending on the mutation involved, T and B cells may both be decreased (T‚ÄìB‚Äì
SCID) or B cells numbers may be normal or increased (T‚ÄìB+SCID). In the latter,
the absence of T cells renders B cells functionally inactive, owing to the need
for the cytokines produced by TH cells for antibody production as described in
Chapter 4. In either case, the disorder becomes apparent in the first few weeks

DISORDERS OF THE IMMUNE SYSTEM

BOX 5.1 Laboratory tests for lymphocyte function
test may not be sufÔ¨Åciently sensitive. However, some proteins
and other types of molecules, such as lipopolysaccharide, act
as mitogens and stimulate many lymphocytes to divide and
are known as polyclonal activators because they stimulate many
different clones of lymphocytes. Mitogens are examples of
lectins, which stimulate lymphocyte proliferation by binding to
carbohydrate residues on the lymphocyte membrane. Lectins are
frequently of plant origin (Table 5.4) although some are derived
from other groups of organisms. It is also possible to stimulate
lymphocytes to divide by incubating them with antibodies
directed at cell surface receptors. Thus, an antibody to CD3 will
stimulate all mature T lymphocytes to divide.
A typical response of T lymphocytes to the lectin
phytohemagglutinin (PHA) from runner beans in a healthy
individual is shown in Figure 5.1. A failure to respond in this
way is indicative of a lymphocyte defect. In patients with SCID,
the proliferative response is less than 10% of control values.

It is theoretically easy to test for lymphocyte function in vivo by
immunizing a patient with immunogens known to stimulate cellmediated or humoral immunity and monitoring the response
of their immune systems. A test for humoral immunity would
involve measuring the levels of speciÔ¨Åc antibody in vitro.
Tests for cell-mediated immunity might involve injecting a
small amount of immunogen subcutaneously and looking for
delayed hypersensitivity (Section 5.4). However, such tests
are not necessarily appropriate or, indeed, ethical, especially
for sick babies. Fortunately, there are tests that can be used to
measure the function of lymphocytes in vitro. For example, small
lymphocytes can be incubated with antigens to which the patient
has been exposed. If the child is immune, the small lymphocytes
will respond by starting to proliferate. The amount of cell division
can be measured by determining the amount of radiolabeled
thymidine incorporated into the DNA of the dividing cells. Of
course, an antigen will only stimulate those cells which bear
speciÔ¨Åc receptors, perhaps only one in 100 000 cells and so the

or months of life with the mean age at diagnosis being 6.5 months. The disease
is characterized by chronic viral and fungal infections. Chronic diarrhea and
oral Candida infections are common and in the presence of other infections,
the child fails to thrive. Affected infants may suffer generalized viral infections
if given live viral vaccines, such as the MMR and polio vaccines. Laboratory
tests show fewer than 3000 per mm3 circulating lymphocytes (where the
reference range for an infant of six months is between 4000 and 13 500 per
mm3). The lymphocytes present are functionally inactive and do not respond
in vitro to known mitogens (Box 5.1). Chest X-rays show an abnormally small
or absent thymus.
Approximately 20% of T‚ÄìB‚Äì SCID arises from mutations in the gene encoding
adenosine deaminase (ADA). The absence of this enzyme results in the
accumulation of metabolites, such as ADP, GTP and dATP, which are toxic to

IMMUNODEFICIENCY DISEASES

small lymphocytes. A similar syndrome arises from deficiency of the purine
nucleoside phosphorylase (PNP) that results in an accumulation of dGTP.
Approximately 40% of cases of T‚ÄìB+ SCID are X-linked and arise from mutations
in a polypeptide that forms part of the receptor for several interleukins (ILs),
so that affected lymphocytes are unable to respond to interleukin signals.
If not diagnosed early and treated appropriately, children with SCID usually
die from infections in the first few years of life. Management of this condition
includes administering antiviral, antibacterial and antifungal drugs and
measures must be taken to avoid infection. Keeping such infants in totally
aseptic conditions is neither feasible nor ethical, since this would preclude
direct contact with other humans. Their immune system may be restored
with a bone marrow transplant. This can lead to long-term survival but is not
without danger, chiefly graft versus host disease (GVHD; Chapter 6). Gene
therapy has been attempted with some ADA deficient patients and, in a few
cases, has been reported to be successful.

Antibody deÔ¨Åciencies
The normal concentration ranges for the five immunoglobulin classes,
IgM, IgG, IgA, IgE and IgD (Chapter 4), in adults are shown in Table 5.5.
Deficiencies involving immunoglobulins of all classes are commonly referred
to as agammaglobulinemias or hypogammaglobulinemias, depending on
the level of deficiency. However, with some disorders there may be a selective
deficiency of a single immunoglobulin class, as in selective IgA deficiency, or
a dysregulation, where some antibody classes are reduced while others are
increased.

Transient hypogammaglobulinemia (TH) occurs when the start of production
of IgG in very young children is delayed. It possibly arises when the maturation
of helper T lymphocytes is itself delayed. During pregnancy, IgG is the only
immunoglobulin to cross the placenta from mother to fetus. Thus a newborn
baby has adult levels of IgG, most of which is maternally derived (Figure 5.2).

DISORDERS OF THE IMMUNE SYSTEM

During the first three months postpartum, the maternally derived IgG is
catabolized and steadily disappears from the baby‚Äôs circulation. Between three
and six months, serum IgG levels may be quite low, after which the levels begin
to increase, and should normally attain ‚Äòadult‚Äô levels at about 12‚Äì18 months of
age. In infants with transient hypogammaglobulinemia, the production of IgG
is delayed considerably, sometimes for as long as two years. During this time
the child is susceptible to recurrent infections with pyogenic (pus producing)
bacteria and antibiotics must be administered. The incidence of TH has been
estimated as 23 to 61 per million births.
Common variable immunodeficiency (CVID) is the commonest primary
immunodeficiency involving all classes of antibody. It is a heterogeneous
group of disorders and includes a range of phenotypes. Many patients are
not diagnosed until early adulthood. Most patients show low levels of IgG and
IgA, with near normal or 50% of normal levels of IgM and normal lymphocyte
counts. The latter allows CVID to be distinguished from other antibody
deficiencies such as X-linked agammaglobulinemia (see below). Some patients
also have impaired cell-mediated immunity (Chapter 4). The incidence has
been estimated at one in 10 000‚Äì50 000.
The etiology of CVID is unknown and the majority of cases are sporadic. The
B lymphocytes are immature and, when stimulated, do not differentiate into
antibody-secreting plasma cells following the binding of an antigen (Chapter
4), owing to defects in their cell surface receptors or signal transduction
mechanisms (Chapter 7). However, it is possible that in some patients there
may be other defects, such as mutations in immunoglobulin regulatory genes.
In addition, many CVID patients have defects in CD4+ T lymphocytes so that
the T and B cell interactions required for antibody production are impaired.
Patients with CVID present with recurrent pyogenic infections, especially
of the respiratory tract, commonly involving Streptococcus pneumoniae,
Staphylococcus aureus, Haemophilus influenzae and Moraxella catarrhalis.
This can lead to bronchiectasis, in which the bronchi and bronchioles are
abnormally dilated. Those patients who also have some impairment in cellmediated immunity also suffer infections with mycobacteria and the fungus
Pneumocystis carinii. Such patients also suffer recurrent severe infections with
herpes simplex and herpes zoster (Chapter 3), and may develop viral illness
when immunized with live viral vaccines.
The diagnosis of CVID relies on the measurement of immunoglobulins,
including specific antibodies to common vaccines, and ruling out other
immunodeficiencies, such as X-linked agammaglobulinemia. Its treatment
usually involves replacement therapy with pooled immunoglobulins obtained
from healthy donors. All pooled immunoglobulin preparations are treated to
inactivate viruses, such as hepatitis virus or HIV, which may be present. These
preparations are available commercially and need to be given intravenously
every three to four weeks to maintain plasma levels and protect against
infections. The dose depends on the weight of the patient and is usually
400‚Äì600 mg kg‚Äì1. Alternatively, weekly subcutaneous administration of lower
doses, which can be done at home, may be more convenient. Intramuscular
injection, which allows a greater volume to be administered than can be
delivered subcutaneously, can also be given.
X-linked agammaglobulinemia (XLA) or Bruton‚Äôs disease is caused by
a deficiency in Bruton‚Äôs tyrosine kinase (Btk), which is required for the
maturation of preB cells in the bone marrow to form B lymphocytes. The
deficiency of Btk is due to one or more of 300 different mutations in the BTK
gene located on the X chromosome. B lymphocytes are therefore absent from
the circulation and plasma cells are not present in the spleen and lymph
nodes. Tonsils and adenoids may be absent, as demonstrated by radiography.
However, circulating T lymphocytes are normal. Serum immunoglobulin

IMMUNODEFICIENCY DISEASES

levels are extremely low and all classes of immunoglobulin are affected.
This is a rare inherited disorder with an incidence of about one in 250 000
males. Patients present with recurrent pyogenic infections, which occur from
around three to nine months of age, when maternally derived IgG is low.
Infections encountered may result in pneumonia, otitis media, meningitis
and diarrhea.
It is essential that patients with XLA are diagnosed as early as possible so that
replacement immunoglobulin therapy can begin. Infections are treated with
antibiotics. The prognosis for children diagnosed before the age of five years
is good, with patients often surviving to middle age. Tests for mutations of the
BTK gene are available, which allows for genetic counseling of affected females
and prenatal diagnosis of fetal cells obtained by chorionic villus sampling or
amniocentesis (Chapter 15), with the possibility of a therapeutic abortion.
Selective IgA deficiency, as its name implies, affects only a single class of
immunoglobulin. Many IgA deficient individuals are asymptomatic, with
the condition only being detected during investigation of other disorders. In
contrast, other patients with selective IgA deficiency suffer recurrent infections,
typically ear infections, sinusitis and pneumonia. A high proportion of
sufferers also develop autoantibodies that are directed against a variety of self
antigens and approximately a third present with autoimmune diseases, such
as systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) (Section 5.3). It is not known which
features determine the severity of the disease. Selective IgA deficiency is a
relatively common disorder with an incidence of one in 500 to 700 Caucasians,
although the frequency is much lower in other ethnic groups.
A patient who presents with a history of recurrent infection, chronic
diarrhea, and autoimmune disease should be suspected of having a
selective IgA deficiency. This can be confirmed by measuring serum
immunoglobulin concentrations. Values of IgA below 0.07 mg dm‚Äì3, while
other immunoglobulins are normal, would confirm the deficiency. Treatment
of selective IgA deficiency normally involves using antibiotics to treat
bacterial infections and replacement therapy is not usually necessary. If the
disease presents with autoimmunity then anti-inflammatory drugs, such
as corticosteroids, may be given. The prognosis is good, with patients living
normal lifespans. However, approximately 10% of patients with a selective
IgA deficiency also have a deficiency of the IgG2 subclass, which is usually
produced in response to polysaccharide antigens. Patients with both defects
suffer more severe bacterial infections, especially with encapsulated bacteria.
Immunoglobulin replacement therapy may be appropriate in these cases.

The DiGeorge anomaly and the Wiskott Aldridge syndrome
The third group of PIDs (Table 5.3) contains a number of well-defined
immunodeficiency syndromes, of which the DiGeorge anomaly and the
Wiskott Aldridge syndrome are well-known examples.
The DiGeorge anomaly (DGA) is a developmental disorder involving organs
that develop from the third and fourth pharyngeal pouches of the embryo. It
is associated with a deletion or partial monosomy of chromosome 22 (Chapter
15) that results in a range of defects. Several different patterns of inheritance
have been reported, including autosomal dominant and autosomal recessive.
Its incidence has been estimated to be between one in 20 000 to 66 000,
depending on the country.
The DGA is characterized by facial abnormalities, hypoparathyroidism and
hypocalcemia with symptoms of convulsions and tetany, congenital heart
disease that may be so severe as to be life threatening, and a small underdeveloped or sometimes absent thymus that results in a profound immunodeficiency. Patients suffer severe and recurring viral and fungal infections.

DISORDERS OF THE IMMUNE SYSTEM

Indeed, the immunological defects are the second commonest cause, after
heart conditions, of death in DGA patients. The number of circulating T
lymphocytes is severely reduced leading to defects in cell-mediated immunity.
T cell proliferative responses to mitogens vary in DGA patients, such that they
can be classified either as partial or complete. In the former, proliferation is
reduced but in the latter it is completely absent. The absence of helper T
lymphocytes reduces antibody production, so that antibacterial immunity may
also be compromised, even though the number of circulating B lymphocytes is
normal.

Margin Note 5.1 Fluorescence
in situ hybridization

i

Fluorescence in situ hybridization
(FISH) relies on the ability of
Ô¨Çuorochrome-labeled DNA probes to
hybridize with complementary DNA
in tissue sections. The hybridized
probe can be seen as Ô¨Çuorescent
‚Äòspots‚Äô in the nuclei of target
interphase cells and can be located to
speciÔ¨Åc chromosomes when applied
to cells in metaphase (Chapters 17
and 18).

A diagnosis of DGA is based on the cardiac malformations, hypoparathyroidism resulting in hypocalcemia and a small or absent thymus. T
lymphocytes in the circulation are reduced and the proliferative response
to mitogens is impaired. Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) has
been used to detect deletions in chromosome 22 in the majority of patients
(Margin Note 5.1). Other syndromes, without any apparent genetic link,
but which have known environmental causes, bear some resemblance to
DGA. One example is fetal alcohol syndrome, which results from prolonged
exposure to alcohol during fetal development. Children with fetal alcohol
syndrome also show the characteristic facial features associated with DGA.
Attempts have been made to treat the immunological deficit in DGA with
thymus transplants, (Chapter 6) although results have been variable. The
associated hypocalcemia is treated with calcium and vitamin D supplements,
while cardiac malformations must be rectified surgically. The prognosis
for patients with DGA is variable and depends mostly on the degree of
cardiovascular abnormality. For patients with severe cardiac problems it is
poor, with a mortality rate of over 80% at the age of six months.
The Wiskott Aldridge syndrome (WAS) arises from mutation in the WAS gene,
which was identified on the short arm of the X chromosome in 1994. The
gene codes for the cytoskeletal protein sialophorin, found in lymphocytes and
platelets, that is involved in the assembly of actin filaments. The incidence of
WAS is approximately one per 250 000 male births.
The syndrome is characterized by decreased levels of IgM but often with
increased production of IgE and IgA. In the early stages, T and B cell numbers
in the blood are normal. Since IgM is the prevalent antibody in immune
responses to bacterial polysaccharides, there is an increased incidence of
infections with encapsulated bacteria. Sufferers may also develop eczema.
Blood platelets are small, short-lived and reduced in number, leading to
thrombocytopenia and increased bleeding times which may prove fatal
(Chapter 13). As WAS progresses, there is a loss of both humoral and cellmediated immunity and, along with severe infections, there is also an increase
in leukemia and lymphoid tumors.
The treatment for WAS includes antibiotics for infections and platelet
transfusions to prevent bleeding. Immunoglobulin replacement therapy may
also be given to provide some protection against infection. Bone marrow
transplants (Chapter 6) have been successful in some cases. Unfortunately
the prognosis for WAS sufferers is poor, with death commonly occurring
before the age of four years usually from severe infection and bleeding.
Genetic counseling is recommended for women who have had a child with
WAS. Detection of the abnormal gene in cells obtained by chorionic villus
sampling or amniocentesis allows a prenatal diagnosis, with the possibility of
terminating the pregnancy if the fetus is found to be affected.

The Chediak-Higashi syndrome
Chediak-Higashi syndrome (CHS) is a rare autosomal recessive disorder
first described in 1943. It is sometimes classified as a phagocytic defect.

IMMUNODEFICIENCY DISEASES

However, even though phagocytic cells, such as neutrophils and monocytes,
are defective, Natural Killer (NK) cells, which form the first line of defence
against viruses, are also abnormal. The syndrome arises from a mutated form
of the CHS1 gene located on chromosome 1. The gene product is involved in
the intracellular transport of proteins and the synthesis of storage granules
in certain cells. The mutation results in neutrophils with abnormally large or
‚Äògiant‚Äô lysosomes (Chapter 16) and platelets (Chapter 13) with abnormal dense
bodies. In addition, melanocytes, the pigment-producing cells of the skin,
contain larger than normal melanosomes; the pigment storing organelles.
Chediak-Higashi syndrome presents as an immune deficiency that leads to
recurrent bacterial infections, most commonly with Staphylococcus aureus,
Streptococcus pyogenes, and Pneumococcus spp and viral infections, such
as with Epstein-Barr virus, that frequently result in tumors of the lymph
nodes (lymphomas). Leukocyte counts reveal neutropenia and abnormal
neutrophils that do not respond to chemotactic molecules, for example
activated complement proteins, and which fail to kill ingested bacteria. Infants
suffer recurrent skin infections, which may result in ulcers and abscesses.
The abnormalities of melanocytes means that patients are deficient in skin
pigment and have blond hair and translucent blue eyes. Infants also bruise
very easily, due to defective platelets. In addition, they suffer progressive
neurological dysfunction, with abnormal gait, mental retardation and
peripheral neuropathy. If the child survives beyond the first decade this may
lead to Parkinsonism and/or dementia. Morbidity and mortality are high in
CHS, with infants frequently dying before the age of 10 years, usually from
overwhelming pyogenic infections attributable to poor neutrophil function.
The recommended treatment for children with CHS is a bone marrow transplant
to correct the immune deficit. However, success has been variable and this
treatment has no effect on the lack of pigmentation since melanocytes do not
arise from bone marrow. Antibiotics are given to treat bacterial infections and
antiviral drugs, such as acyclovir or interferon @, to limit infection with the
Epstein-Barr virus. Patients with lymphoma are given anticancer drugs, such as
vincristine.

Phagocytic defects
Phagocytic cells, such as monocytes, macrophages and neutrophils, form part
of the nonspecific immune defense. These cells kill ingested bacteria using
several different mechanisms as described in Chapter 4. A defect in any of these
mechanisms can lead to increased incidences of infections. Thus, patients may
be severely compromized by defective phagocytes, even if their B and T cell
populations and functions are normal. Some examples of phagocytic defects
are chronic granulomatous disease and leukocyte adhesion deficiency.
Chronic granulomatous disease (CGD) is named from the granulomatous
inflammatory nodules that present on the skin and in the gastrointestinal and
genitourinary tracts. It is an inherited disorder of phagocytic cells characterized
by their inability to generate the reactive oxygen intermediates needed to
produce bactericidal compounds, such as hydrogen peroxide. The formation
of reactive oxygen intermediates is dependent on NADPH oxidase activity.
This enzyme is composed of four subunits and a defect in any one of them
can result in CGD. Approximately 65% of all CGD cases is due to a defect in
the CYBB gene located on the X chromosome which encodes cytochrome b245.
The genes for the other subunits are located on autosomal chromosomes and
females and males are equally affected. The incidence of CGD is estimated to
be about one in 200 000 to 250 000.
Sufferers of CGD usually present before the age of five years. Skin infections,
pneumonia, gastroenteritis, perianal abscesses are common. Abscesses on
internal organs, such as the lungs, spleen and liver, may also be present. The

syndrome

Hyper IgD and periodic fever
syndrome (HIDS) is a rare disease
which was Ô¨Årst reported in 1984.
Patients suffer recurrent attacks of
fever and symptoms of inÔ¨Çammation
and an acute phase response from
about the age of one year. These
attacks may last up to six days and
may be triggered by surgery, trauma
or vaccination. Clinical Ô¨Åndings
include, usually, elevated levels of
serum IgD sometimes with higher
levels of IgA. The disease is inherited
as an autosomal recessive trait and
sufferers have been shown to have
a defective gene for mevalonate
kinase. Most sufferers are of
Western European origin, with the
majority being Dutch or French. The
mevalonate kinase enzyme is involved
in the metabolism of cholesterol,
although how this deÔ¨Åciency is
related to the inÔ¨Çammatory condition
is not known.

DISORDERS OF THE IMMUNE SYSTEM

small amounts of hydrogen peroxide produced by CGD patients makes them
resistant to catalase negative bacteria. However, catalase positive bacteria,
by definition produce catalase, which catalyzes the degradation of hydrogen
peroxide; hence these types of bacteria give rise to infections in CGD sufferers.
Pneumonia is generally associated with fungal infections; and disseminated
fungal disease also occurs.
A diagnosis of CGD takes into account the recurrent infections of early
onset, granulomas, hepatosplenomegaly, that is enlarged liver and spleen,
and lymphadenopathy. Laboratory investigations include the nitroblue
tetrazolium (NBT) test to determine the activity of the NADPH oxidase. In
neutrophils with normal levels of enzyme, the pale yellow NBT is reduced
to a blue colored compound as NADPH is oxidized, and can be observed in
the cytoplasm. Patients with CGD are treated with high doses of antibiotics
over long periods of time. This treatment also helps to dispel the granulomas.
Abscesses may need to be drained. Bone marrow transplantation has been
used successfully to treat some patients.
Leukocyte adhesion deficiency (LAD) occurs in two forms, but both are caused
by the failure of leukocytes to express cell adhesion molecules essential for
their movement through blood vessel walls during inflammation. Thus
phagocytes are unable to enter inflamed tissues and remove bacteria. In LAD I,
patients do not express the integrin, CD18 on neutrophils, macrophages and
lymphocytes that allows them to bind to endothelial cells lining the blood
vessels. In addition, CD18 is the receptor for C3b, which is an opsonin for
phagocytic cells and crucial molecule of the complement pathway. Patients
suffer localized bacterial infections that may become life threatening. In LAD
II leukocytes fail to express ligands for other cell adhesion molecules, namely
E and P selectins. Binding of leukocytes to these ligands allows them to roll
along the endothelial cell surfaces before crossing into the tissues. Both LAD
I and LAD II are autosomal recessive disorders. While LAD I affects all ethnic
groups, LAD II has only been reported in people of Middle Eastern origin.
Patients with LAD I suffer localized bacterial infections that may become
life threatening. Children do not usually survive beyond two years of age
unless they have a bone marrow transplant. Patients with LAD II also suffer
repeated infections as well as severe growth and mental retardations. Blood
counts from patients with either form of LAD show a leukocytosis, that is, a
white blood cell count in excess of 20 q 109 dm‚Äì3 in the absence of infection,
compared to normal values of 4‚Äì11 q 109 dm‚Äì3 (Chapter 13). Both diseases may
be diagnosed by flow cytometry, to assess the presence of the cell adhesion
molecule on blood leukocytes. Leukocyte adhesion deficiency I has been
treated successfully with bone marrow transplantation (Chapter 6).

Complement deÔ¨Åciencies
The role of complement in immune defense was outlined in Chapter 4. Here it
will be described in more detail. The activation of complement results in the:
t

lysis of bacteria;

t

stimulation of the inflammatory response;

t

promotion of phagocytosis;

t

clearance of immune complexes.

The value of these roles cannot be overestimated. Complement may be
activated by one of three pathways: the classical pathway, which is activated
by IgG or IgM, following binding to an antigen; the alternative pathway, which
is stimulated principally by components of the cell walls of bacteria and
yeasts; and the lectin pathway, which is initiated by the binding of mannose
binding lectin (MBL) to bacteria. Complement proteins C1, 2, 3 and 4 are
involved in classical activation, while Factors B, D, H, I and P are involved in

&%-

W^dad\nd[Y^hZVhZ

IMMUNODEFICIENCY DISEASES

the alternative pathway activation. Activation of the lectin pathway requires
MBL, MBL-associated serine proteases (MASP) 1 and 2 and C2, C3 and C4. All
three pathways can lead to the production of membrane attack complexes
(MACs), which are composed of C5b, C6, C7, C8 and C9. These cause lysis of
the pathogen; in addition, fragments of activated complement proteins, such
as C3a, C4a, C5a, promote inflammation by binding to mast cells and causing
them to degranulate and release inflammatory chemicals, such as histamine
(Chapter 4). These chemicals may also promote the chemotaxis of neutrophils
out of the inflamed vessels. Other complement proteins, such as C1q, C3b
and C567 act as opsonins. The absence of any of these proteins can severely
compromise health. Complement is potentially very inflammatory once
activated and there are a number of regulatory molecules which either prevent
unregulated activation of complement, such as C1 inhibitor (C1INH), or which
prevent damage to innocent bystander cells, such as Decay Accelerating Factor
(DAF).
Inherited deficiencies of each complement protein have been described (Table
5.6). Deficiencies in several of the early classical pathway proteins result in
an increased incidence of immune complex disorders, showing the role of
complement in helping to remove immune complexes from the circulation.
Over 90% of patients with a homozygous C1q deficiency and 10% of patients
with a homozygous C2 deficiency develop SLE (Section 5.3). A deficiency of
MBL is associated with increased incidence of infections with, for example,
Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Newborn babies and infants are particularly at risk
from this deficiency, indicating the importance of this pathway in protecting
the young from infection.

DISORDERS OF THE IMMUNE SYSTEM

Deficiencies in the classical and the alternative pathways can be detected in
the laboratory by carrying out the CH50 and AP50 tests respectively. The CH50
test measures the ability of the patient‚Äôs serum to lyse antibody-coated sheep
erythrocytes, while the AP50 determines its ability to lyse these uncoated cells
in rabbits. Results are expressed in terms of the ability of the serum to induce
lysis of 50% of the target erythrocytes. Individual complement proteins can
be measured by immunoassay, using specific antibodies. Thus C3 and C4 can
be measured by nephelometry, single radial immunodiffusion or by ELISA
(Chapter 4).
Hereditary angioedema (HAE) results from faults in the activity of the
complement regulator, C1 inhibitor (C1INH). This protein normally functions
to prevent the overactivation of the first part of the classical pathway by
inhibiting C1r and C1s. The lack of the inhibitor leads to consumption of C4
and C2. Two types of HAE occur. Type I results from reduced levels of C1INH
while in Type II the inhibitor is present but nonfunctional. The condition is
an autosomal dominant disorder, which has an incidence of one in 50 000 to
150 000, with 85% of cases being Type I.
The disorder presents as noninflammatory and painless swellings of the
skin, especially that of the limbs, which is often precipitated by physical
trauma and anxiety. Abdominal pain is caused by the involvement of internal
organs, such as the stomach, bladder and intestines. Severe edema of the
larynx can cause death. Treatment during attacks is to administer fresh
frozen plasma or commercially available C1-INH. Prophylactic treatment
with danazol, an androgen, has been shown to stimulate the synthesis of
C1-INH, but prolonged treatment may result in unpleasant side effects, such
as virilization in women and suppression of testosterone production in men
(Chapter 7).

5.3

AUTOIMMUNE DISORDERS

The macromolecules of the body are potentially highly immunogenic but,
fortunately, immune systems do not usually mount immune responses against
them. In fact, we are ‚Äòtolerant‚Äô to ‚Äòself‚Äô (Box 5.2). Whatever mechanisms lie
behind the induction and maintenance of tolerance, it is clear that a number
of disorders arise when these mechanisms fail and the immune system starts
to attack self antigens. Failures of immunological tolerance lie behind the
development of autoimmune disease. Autoimmune disease affects 5 to 7%
of the population and autoimmune disorders are debilitating, chronic and
painful.

CLASSIFICATION OF AUTOIMMUNE DISORDERS
Autoimmune disorders are often classified according to whether they are
organ-specific, affecting only one organ or are systemic that is, affecting
multiple organ systems (Table 5.7). In addition, destruction of cells and tissues
can be brought about by autoantibodies and/or cell-mediated immunity. For
example, in multiple sclerosis (MS) patients produce antibodies against myelin,
the fatty material surrounding the axons of nerves. In addition, MS patients
have TH and TC lymphocytes in their blood and cerebrospinal fluid, which are
specific for myelin protein. Thus, humoral and cell-mediated autoimmunity
may contribute to the demyelination of nerves in MS patients. In some
instances, autoantibodies can block or stimulate a cell receptor. Myasthenia
gravis is an example of the former, while Graves disease (Chapter 7) is an
example of the latter. Like most classification schemes, that of autoimmune
disorders is not perfect. For example, Goodpasture‚Äôs syndrome directly affects
both kidneys and lungs while MS exerts systemic effects by attacking one type
of tissue only.

Table 5.7 Some examples of autoimmune disease

Many, but not all, autoimmune disorders, affect a preponderance of female
patients, with three times as many females as males presenting with
autoimmune diseases. The reasons for this gender bias are unclear but may be
related to sex hormone levels. Many autoimmune disorders show a link with
the type of MHC antigens that are present on cells. In humans, the MHC is
known as the HLA system. The links between HLA type and different diseases
is described in Chapter 6. So, for example, patients with Goodpasture‚Äôs
syndrome have a higher incidence of HLA-DR2 than the healthy population.

AUTOIMMUNE DISORDERS AFFECTING ENDOCRINE GLANDS
Autoimmune disorders of the thyroid gland are among the most common
autoimmune disorders. Some will be discussed in Chapter 7. Autoimmune
thyroiditis, also known as Hashimoto‚Äôs thyroiditis, results in hypothyroidism
and myxedema. The disease presents, typically, in women of middle age
who are overweight, lethargic, constantly feel cold, are constipated and have
coarse, dry hair and skin. The thyroid is swollen with a generally painless
goiter, but which has a rubbery consistency when palpated. A biopsy of
the thyroid shows infiltration with both CD8+ and CD4+ T lymphocytes
that progressively destroy the thyroid gland. Patients also have antibodies
to thyroglobulin and to thyroid peroxidase, which can be determined by

DISORDERS OF THE IMMUNE SYSTEM

BOX 5.2 How to recognize self
There are a number of theories to explain the development
of immunological tolerance and it may indeed be that several
different mechanisms are involved. It has been shown in
experimental systems that rodents become tolerant to potential
immunogens if they were exposed to them during fetal
development. Thus mice exposed to foreign proteins in utero
do not mount immune responses against these immunogens
when adults. The suggestion that lymphocytes exposed to
epitopes, including self epitopes, during fetal development are
selectively removed or deleted from the immune system explains
the experimental induction of tolerance, and there is certainly
evidence that this happens to developing T lymphocytes in
the thymus (Figure 5.3). However, this does not explain the
development of tolerance to immunogens which are not
present in the fetus but which are expressed in the adult. It
may be that some immunogens are kept anatomically separate
from the immune system during life, to avoid potentially
immunogenic self proteins inducing an immune response. For
instance, it has been shown that when rabbits are injected with
lens protein they make antibodies that then bind to the lenses
of their own eyes. Another example is seen in vasectomized
men who may start to make antisperm antibodies, presumably
because the sperm they continue to produce become exposed
to their immune systems following the operation. Finally, there
is evidence that some types of T lymphocytes can suppress
immune responses against self antigens. These T lymphocytes
have, in the past, been called suppressor T lymphocytes and
were thought to belong to the CD8+ subset. However, it
has been shown that both CD8+ and CD4+ cells can have
suppressor activity by producing inhibitory cytokines, such as
IFN F and IL-10 respectively.

In the cortex, cells that recognize self epitopes are
deleted.

ELISA (Chapter 4). Immunohistochemical techniques (Chapter 4) can show
the patient‚Äôs serum to have antibodies that bind to microsomal antigens in
sections of normal thyroid (Figure 5.4). Patients may be given thyroxine to
treat the myxedema, and thyroidectomy may be required. The prognosis for
patients with Hashimoto‚Äôs thyroiditis is good.
In Graves disease, patients suffer symptoms of thyrotoxicosis: are thin, have a
high resting pulse rate, constantly feel hot, have bulging eyes, or exophthalmos,
due to growth of tissue around the orbit of the eye and may suffer diarrhea and
general agitation. They have nodules in the thyroid that are foci of infiltrating
T lymphocytes. Low levels of antibodies to thyroid microsomal antigens are
seen in the plasma. However, more than 90% of patients have antibodies to
the thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) receptor on the surface of thyroid
cells. These antibodies bind to the receptor and stimulate the production of
thyroid hormone (Figure 5.5). This production is not regulated by the usual
negative feedback mechanisms (Chapter 7) leading to the disease symptoms.
Graves disease may be treated successfully by destruction of thyroid tissue.
This can be achieved by its surgical removal or by giving the patient radioactive
iodine that becomes concentrated in the thyroid. When women with Graves
disease are pregnant, autoantibodies to TSH cross the placenta and the baby
is born with thyrotoxicosis. Urgent treatment is required but, in time, the baby
recovers as its levels of maternally derived antibodies drop.

The binding of antibodies to alveolar membranes causes hemoptysis, that is,
the coughing up of blood from the lungs and about 40% of patients experience
chest pain. Hemorrhaging from the lungs may eventually lead to respiratory
failure. There is some suggestion that the binding of antibodies to the alveolar
basement membranes is facilitated by exposure to organic solvents, which
increase the permeability of the alveolar capillaries. The incidence of antiGBM
disease is rare, of the order of 0.5 cases per million in the UK. Unlike most

Antiglomerular basement membrane diseases are characterized by
autoantibodies to the glomerular basement membrane (antiGBM). They
include Goodpasture‚Äôs syndrome and Goodpasture‚Äôs disease. The former
disorder shows glomerulonephritis, pulmonary hemorrhage and the presence
of circulating antibodies to glomerular basement membrane; the latter is
similar, but without the lung involvement. Both diseases are now included
under the more general heading of antiGBM disease. Tissue damage is caused
by antiGBM antibodies binding to the glomerular basement membrane and
activating complement. Complement-mediated inflammation then ensues.
The symptoms of glomerulonephritis include proteinuria and hematuria and
erythrocyte casts (Margin Note 5.3) are seen.

autoimmune disease, it shows a predominance in males, with younger males
generally presenting with both lung and kidney involvement.
Antiglomerular basement membrane disease can be diagnosed from
linear deposits of antiGBM antibodies, which can be visualized by
immunofluorescence on a kidney biopsy. An early diagnosis is essential and
treatment must be started immediately. Therapy involves removal of circulating
antibodies by plasmapheresis and the administration of immunosuppressive
drugs (Chapter 6). The mortality rate for antiGBM disease is improving, and is
currently at 10%, although most patients develop end stage renal disease. In
the past, the disease was invariably fatal.

MYASTHENIA GRAVIS
Myasthenia gravis (MG) is an autoimmune disorder in which patients produce
antibodies to acetylcholine receptors at the neuromuscular junction of striated
muscle. The antibodies block the receptors so that they fail to respond to
acetylcholine (Figure 5.6). This results in intermittent but progressive weakness
of skeletal muscles, including those for breathing and the facial muscles
involved in chewing, swallowing, talking and eye movements. The latter can
lead to double vision and an inability to raise the eyelids, a condition known
as ptosis. Difficulty with respiration may lead to inadequate intake of air and
an inability to clear secretions from the respiratory tract. The incidence of
pneumonia is increased in these patients. Approximately 75% of patients with
MG also have thymic abnormalities such as hyperplasia and thymoma. The
incidence of MG has been quoted as up to 14 in 100 000, with a female to male
ratio of about 3 : 2.
The problems associated with movement of eye muscles are often the first
sign of MG. The presence of autoantibodies may be confirmed by indirect
immunofluorescence tests and the levels are a useful measure of disease
progression. However, autoantibodies may not be detected in patients
where the disease is confined to the facial muscles. Patients are treated
with immunosuppressive drugs and cholinesterase inhibitors and with
plasmapheresis (Chapter 6) to remove the autoantibodies. The condition is
improved in the majority of patients by thymectomy. The mortality rate in

Criteria for diagnosis
1. Stiffness of the joints in the morning

RHEUMATOID ARTHRITIS
Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic, painful and debilitating condition
characterized by symmetrical arthritis and radiological changes to the
bone. The revised classification of rheumatoid arthritis (1988) is shown in
Table 5.8. Autoantibodies are present in the plasma of patients with RA. The
commonest, occurring in 70% of cases, is an IgM class antibody directed
against IgG, called rheumatoid factor (RF). However, RFs belonging to the
IgA and IgG classes have also been detected. The presence of RF causes large
amounts of immune complexes to be formed, since IgG is present at relatively
high concentrations in the blood. The complexes may adhere to blood vessel
walls, activating complement and initiating an inflammatory reaction. While
a minority of patients suffer a single episode of joint inflammation with longterm remission, most have a progressive illness characterized by intermittent
‚Äòflares‚Äô. In periods of active joint inflammation, the affected joints (Figure
5.7) are painful, swollen, red and warm to the touch; all characteristics of the
inflammation within them. The presence of RF and subsequent inflammatory
disease does not, however, adequately explain the pathogenesis of RA. Cellmediated immunity is known to be heavily involved in joint destruction. The
synovial membranes of affected joints are infiltrated with small lymphocytes,
especially TH1 cells, monocytes and macrophages so that the membranes
themselves become thickened. Activated macrophages within the synovial
fluid produce cytokines, such as IL-1 and tumor necrosis factor @ (TNF @),
which mediate erosion of bone. The accumulation of inflammatory
neutrophils within the synovial fluid also contributes to the damage to the
cartilage. Patients may also suffer inflammation of blood vessels or vasculitis
and about 20% have subcutaneous rheumatoid nodules, often on the elbows
and forearms but which may also occur in internal organs. The nodules
consist of a mass of monocytes, lymphocytes and plasma cells surrounding a
necrotic core, and probably represent the progression of vasculitis.

have four or more of these symptoms and symptoms
one to four for at least six weeks.

The etiology of RA remains unknown, despite numerous infectious agents
having been implicated over the years. However, RA remains one of the most
common autoimmune disorders, with an incidence of one to two per 100. The
female to male ratio is approximately 3 : 1 and the disease manifests maximally
between the ages of 40 and 60, although juvenile forms also exist.
Rheumatoid factor can be detected in plasma or serum by using the RoseWaaler test, which determines the ability of the serum to agglutinate sheep

erythrocytes sensitized with specific IgG antisheep erythrocyte antibody
(Figure 5.8). Alternatively, latex particles nonspecifically coated with IgG can
be used. A smaller proportion of individuals, around 40%, with RA also have
antinuclear factors and these are also seen in patients with systemic lupus
erythematosus (see below). Treatment of RA is with immunosuppressive agents
such as methotrexate (Chapter 6) and anti-inflammatory drugs, including
steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (SAIDs), such as corticosteroids, and the
nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, for example aspirin. New treatments
aimed at blocking the effect of TNF @ have been trialled. These involve either the
infusion of a monoclonal antibody to TNF @, or the administration of soluble
receptors for TNF @. In the latter case, the soluble receptors bind to TNF and
prevent this inflammatory cytokine from binding to receptors on cells. The
prognosis for patients with very severe disease is poor in terms of five-year
survival. However, even with less severe disease, the condition is painful and
debilitating, particularly during periods of active disease. The long-term use of
immunosuppressive drugs leads to an increased susceptibility to infection.

SYSTEMIC LUPUS ERYTHEMATOSUS
Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is an autoimmune disease in which
about 95% of patients have antinuclear antibodies (ANAs) in their plasma.
The deposition of immune complexes leads to widespread inflammation that
affects many organs systems within the body. Clinical features of the disease
are summarized in Table 5.9, the commonest presentations are arthritis and
skin rash, particularly the butterfly rash of the face (Figure 5.9). Renal disease
occurs in approximately half of affected individuals, with nephritis developing
early on in the disease. Although the etiology of SLE is uncertain, the systemic
nature of the disease is linked to the type of autoantibodies present. The
disease primarily affects women of reproductive age, although much younger
and much older patients have been seen. The female to male ratio is about
4 : 1, although in younger patients this gender bias does not occur.
Unfortunately different patients have different patterns of symptoms
and their variety in this multisystem disorder has, in the past, presented

difficulties with diagnosis, so it must take full account of the range of
presentations. Diagnosis can be helped by demonstrating the presence of
ANAs in samples of plasma, using indirect immunofluorescence on cultured
Hep-2 cells. The commonest pattern seen is a diffuse staining throughout
the nucleus due to antibodies against chromatin. It is also possible to detect
different patterns of fluorescence which are indicative of antibodies to
different nuclear antigens and which can help in diagnosis or in assessing
prognosis (Table 5.10). Autoantibodies against extractable nuclear antigens
(ENA) can also be detected by RIA or ELISA (Chapter 4). Positive tests for
ANAs require further investigations, for example with tests for antidoublestranded dsDNA (dsDNA) antibodies. The presence in the blood of so-called
LE cells, which are neutrophils containing phagocytozed nuclei and resemble
large multinucleate cells, is also indicative of SLE. Other laboratory tests
used in the diagnosis of SLE include those listed in Table 5.11. Rheumatoid

Systemic lupus erythematosus is treated with immunosuppressive drugs, such
as azathioprine or cyclosporine (Chapter 6) although the use of such drugs
in patients prone to kidney disease needs careful monitoring. In addition,
patients maintained on immunotherapy are more susceptible to infectious
diseases. The prognosis for sufferers of SLE has improved greatly over the last
50 years because the disease is now diagnosed earlier. For example, in the
1950s, most patients died within 10 years of diagnosis, whereas today around
90% are alive 10 years after diagnosis.

IMMUNOLOGICAL HYPERSENSITIVITY

Immunological hypersensitivities are disorders in which the immune
response to a foreign immunogen results in tissue damage. The term allergy,
which originally meant ‚Äòaltered reactivity‚Äô, is sometimes used synonymously
with hypersensitivity. In fact, allergies are only some specific types of
hypersensitivity. Although the word hypersensitivity implies an overreaction,
in fact, there is nothing essentially abnormal about the immune response in
these cases. It may simply be the extent and nature of the exposure to the
immunogen that results in the damage. Indeed, immunogens that provoke
hypersensitivities are often ‚Äòharmless‚Äô in that they are not necessarily infectious
agents. Immunological hypersensitivities represent the most common group
of immunological disorders and, collectively, affect approximately 10% of the
population.

Margin Note 5.4 Atopy

i

People who suffer Type I
hypersensitivities are frequently
referred to as being atopic. The term
atopy refers to an inherited tendency
to develop an allergic condition
typiÔ¨Åed by rhinitis, asthma and
eczema, that is Type I hypersensitivity.
There is a deÔ¨Ånite genetic
predisposition to atopy, with different
members of the families sometimes
showing different manifestations.

&&-

In 1963, Gell and Coombs classified hypersensitivities into four ‚Äòtypes‚Äô based
on the part of the immune system that caused the tissue damage (Table 5.12).
This classification scheme is still used today, although not all hypersensitivities
belong exclusively to one type. For example, immunological reactions to drugs
can be both Types I and III, while intrinsic allergic alveolitis has components of
Types III and IV. In addition, expansion of the classification to include further
types has been suggested. This chapter retains the original classification.

TYPE I HYPERSENSITIVITY
Type I hypersensitivity is also referred to as immediate, because its effects
are apparent within eight h of exposure to an immunogen. The effects can be
fairly trivial, as in hay fever, or life threatening, as in atopic (Margin Note 5.4)
or allergic asthma or anaphylactic shock. The term allergy is often used for
Type I, although this is also used for some of the other types. Immunogens
that cause allergies are often referred to as allergens and this is the term that
will be used here.

The different manifestations (Table 5.13) of Type I depend on the degree of
previous exposure to the allergen and also on the route of exposure. The
underlying cause is the production of IgE in response to an allergen. This type
of antibody stimulates inflammatory responses that are aimed at eliminating
parasitic worms. Atopic individuals produce IgE in response to allergens
that, in nonallergic individuals, would stimulate the production of IgG. The
tissue mast cells and blood basophils have receptors for the Fc region of
IgE, so that IgE binds to the surface of these cells. The more sensitized an
individual, the more their mast cells are coated with IgE. Further exposure to
the same allergen results in the cross-linking of mast-cell bound IgE by the
allergen (Figure 5.10). This triggers an explosive degranulation of the mast
cell that releases pharmacologically active mediators, including histamine,
which causes vasodilation, smooth muscle contraction and mucus secretion,
depending on where they are released. In addition the subsequent release
of further mediators, for example leukotrienes and prostaglandins, which
are synthesized at the mast cell membrane potentiate inflammation and
smooth muscle contraction. This response which evolved as a defense
against multicellular parasites, causes the characteristic symptoms of the
hypersensitivity.

DISORDERS OF THE IMMUNE SYSTEM

Type I hypersensitivity is the most common form of the immunological
hypersensitivities and is estimated to affect between one in 5‚Äì10 individuals,
with conditions, such as allergic rhinitis, allergic asthma and food allergies.

Allergic rhinitis
Allergic rhinitis or hay fever is extremely common and its effects are well known.
Seasonal allergic rhinitis typically presents in the spring and summer and is
generally brought on by pollen to which the individual has been sensitized.
Some individuals show sensitivity to many types of pollen (Figure 5.11),
including well-known ‚Äòculprits‚Äô such as ragweed, while others are allergic to a
single type of tree pollen. Individuals who suffer allergic rhinitis all year round
are most likely to be allergic to other types of allergens, such as the dead skin
cells sloughed from household pets, or the feces of house dust mites (Figure
5.12) which thrive in warm, carpeted dwellings. Although allergic rhinitis is
not life threatening, it can be very debilitating.

Allergic asthma
Allergic asthma is a serious and potentially life-threatening condition brought
on by air-borne allergens, such as those which trigger hay fever. In patients
with allergic asthma, sensitization to a range of air-borne allergens stimulates
inflammation in the respiratory tract, narrowing the airways and eventually
leading to hyperreactivity of the muscles of the bronchial tree. The condition
is very distressing particularly during an asthmatic attack, when severe
respiratory distress may require emergency treatment. The incidence of
asthma is increasing in children for which various explanations have been put
forward. For example, it may be that increasing air pollution is predisposing
patients to more frequent asthmatic attacks by increasing the hyperreactivity
of the bronchial muscles.

Food allergies

Figure 5.11 Photographs showing the release
of pollen grains from (A) hazel, Corylus avellana
and (B) Timothy grass, Phleum pratense.

Allergies to food are also seen in atopic individuals. Normally, the allergy will
present as a skin rash, possibly with diarrhea, within an hour of consumption
of the particular food involved. Foods known to cause allergies include eggs,
shellfish, mushrooms and strawberries. Recently, much attention has focused
on the extent of severe allergic reactions to nuts, especially peanuts. This
may be due to the increased use of peanut paste as a thickening agent in the
preparation of processed foods. Individuals who are allergic to peanuts may
suffer rapid and life-threatening allergic reactions and are advised to avoid
processed food unless the ingredients are clearly labeled. It has also been
known for individuals to suffer severe reactions to certain fruits, such as
papaya, though this is rare.

BOX 5.3 Anaphylactic shock
Anaphylactic shock is a life-threatening reaction to an allergen
that may begin within minutes of exposure. Anaphylactic shock
is often due to intramuscular or intravenous exposure to an
immunogen as, for example, in a penicillin sensitive individual
who has been given intramuscular or intravenous penicillin to
treat a bacterial infection. People who are highly sensitized to bee
venom may also develop anaphylactic shock following a bee sting.
Anaphylactic shock may also be brought about by sensitization
to latex found, for example, in rubber gloves used in hospitals,
and this appears to be an increasing problem. In addition,
food allergies in highly sensitized individuals occasionally result

&'%

in anaphylactic shock. Typically, those affected suffer extreme
respiratory distress accompanied by hypotension and may also
develop a skin rash (urticaria) and diarrhea. The condition arises
from a systemic release of mast cell mediators. The extensive
vasodilation causes a sudden massive drop in blood pressure.
The effects of mediators, in particular leukotrienes, on respiratory
muscles also lead to breathing difÔ¨Åculties. Anaphylactic shock is
a medical emergency and must be treated immediately with, for
example, rapid intramuscular injection of adrenalin to relax the
smooth muscle tissues.

IMMUNOLOGICAL HYPERSENSITIVITY

Management of Type I hypersensitivity
The most appropriate strategy for treating Type I hypersensitivity is to identify
the allergen and to avoid it. Laboratory tests to identify the allergen in question
may involve skin testing (Box 11.5). Extracts of common allergens are injected
intradermally. In sensitive individuals, the causative allergen will produce a
‚Äòwheal and flare‚Äô skin reaction within 20 min. The ‚Äòwheal‚Äô is a raised red lump,
while the flare is the red inflamed area that surrounds it. Investigations of Type
I hypersensitivity include the radioallergosorbent test (RAST) which measures
the level of allergen-specific IgE in the blood. This involves incubating samples
of serum from a patient with the potential allergen immobilized on a solid
support, any IgE that becomes bound to the allergen is then detected by the
addition of 125I-labeled anti-IgE antibodies.
When complete avoidance of the allergen is not feasible, drugs may be
used to control the symptoms. These include antihistamines, such as
brompheniramine maleate and loratadine, anti-inflammatory drugs, such as
corticosteroids, and ‚ÄòIntal‚Äô which prevents mast cell degranulation.

Figure 5.12 The house dust mite.

TYPE II HYPERSENSITIVITY
Type II or cytotoxic hypersensitivity refers to those situations in which antibody
activates complement causing tissue damage. Examples include transfusion
reactions to mismatched blood, and hemolytic disease of the newborn
(HDN). In addition, autoimmune reactions that involve lysis of cells can be
included here. Autoimmune diseases have already been discussed above and
transfusion and HDN are described in Chapter 6, hence only a brief discussion
of the causes and consequences of the transfusion of ABO incompatible blood
will be given here.

Transfusion reactions
The ABO blood group system contains four blood groups: A, B, AB, or O,
according to the types of antigens found on erythrocyte membranes (Chapter
6). In the plasma, there are also antibodies to the blood group antigens that
are not present on the erythrocyte membranes. Thus, individuals with blood
group A have anti-B antibodies in their plasma, while those of blood group B
have anti-A (Figure 5.13). These antibodies are known as isohemagglutinins,
and usually belong to the IgM class, which are efficient activators of
complement. If a blood group A individual is transfused with group B blood,
then antibodies from the donated blood will bind to recipient erythrocytes,
activate complement and cause their lysis. Similarly, antibodies in the
recipient will lyse the donated erythrocytes. The sudden and simultaneous
lysis of cells leads to kidney failure and death.

TYPE III HYPERSENSITIVITY
Type III or complex-mediated hypersensitivity is brought about by immune
complexes that usually involve antibodies to soluble antigens. Immune
complexes can be harmful because they activate complement, triggering
inflammation and the influx of neutrophils into an area. Over a period of time,
this can cause tissue damage, principally due to lytic enzymes released by
dying neutrophils. As the size of immune complexes varies, depending on the
relative proportions of antigen and antibody, the clinical consequences may
vary. For example, in autoimmune diseases such as RA (Section 5.3) immune
complexes between rheumatoid factor and IgG are produced in antigen excess.
These complexes are small and soluble and travel in the circulation. They
may adhere to the insides of blood vessels, triggering vasculitis, or terminate
in the kidney and cause nephritis. In intrinsic allergic alveolitis, immune
complexes produced in the alveoli are large, and precipitate in the lungs,
causing alveolitis. The name ‚Äòintrinsic allergic alveolitis‚Äô covers a number of

DISORDERS OF THE IMMUNE SYSTEM

occupational diseases, in which workers are exposed to air-borne immunogens.
A typical example of this disorder is Farmer‚Äôs lung (Figure 5.14). This disorder
typically begins in winter time, when the farmer develops a cough. Since this
is not an unusual occurrence, the disease may go unrecognized for several
years. However, the disease is progressive and, if untreated, will progress to
emphysema. The disease is related to the farmer moving hay to feed livestock
during the winter. Ascomycete fungi grow well in the warm damp conditions
at the center of a haystack, and a cloud of spores are released when the hay is
moved. The farmer inhales the spores and, over months and years, develops
high levels of circulating IgG to immunogenic molecules which have been
leached from the spores. With high levels of IgG in the blood supply to the
alveoli, further exposure to spore antigens causes large immune complexes to
precipitate in the lungs, setting up inflammation in the alveoli.

Successive winters may result in immune complex-mediated damage to the
lungs, with fibrosis and loss of gas exchange capacity. Although Farmer‚Äôs lung
is classified as an antibody-mediated hypersensitivity, it is now recognized
that cell-mediated immunity is also involved and that damage caused by
specific T cells also contributes to the disease. It is essential that Farmer‚Äôs lung
be diagnosed early to avoid permanent damage to lung tissue. Treatment
in the early stages may simply involve avoidance of the antigen, although
corticosteroids may also be used to treat the inflammatory reaction.

TYPE IV DELAYED TYPE HYPERSENSITIVITY
Delayed-type hypersensitivity (DTH) requires more than 18 h after exposure
to an immunogen for the symptoms to become apparent. This type of
hypersensitivity is caused by T lymphocytes rather than antibody. The DTH
reaction is typified by the Mantoux reaction. The vaccine to protect against
tuberculosis (TB) consists of an attenuated form of Bacillus Calmette
Gu√©rin (BCG) which is a strain of Mycobacterium bovis (Chapter 2). Before
being given the vaccine, individuals are skin tested to see if they are already
sensitized by infection or previous vaccination. This involves injecting
an extract of mycobacteria, called purified protein derivative (PPD)
intradermally. If an individual is sensitized, then after about 18‚Äì24 h, the
injection site becomes swollen and red. The swelling increases for around
48 h then subsides slowly so that this ‚Äòpositive‚Äô reaction is still visible after
several weeks. An individual who gives a positive Mantoux test may then be
investigated to ensure that the positive result was due to prior sensitization
rather than active disease.
The swelling is caused by small lymphocytes and monocytes infiltrating
into the area. Initially, sensitized CD4+ T cells respond to PPD by releasing
cytokines (Figure 5.15) that attract and retain monocytes at the site and induce
inflammation, allowing the entry of more CD4+ cells. Thus a cascade reaction
occurs, producing a slow but progressive swelling at the site of the injection.
The reaction subsides once the phagocytic monocytes have removed all the
PPD.
Delayed type hypersensitivity is also seen in contact allergies to a number
of chemicals, including certain biological stains, some hair dyes, nickel salts
in cheap jewellery, mercuric salts in some tattoo dyes, fluorodinitrobenzene
and some plant biochemicals, such as urushiol in poison ivy. Typically, once
sensitized, an individual will develop dermatitis approximately 18 to 24 h after
further skin contact with the same chemical. Skin sensitizing chemicals are
not typical immunogens, since they are neither proteins nor large molecules.
However, it appears that sensitization involves their chemical binding to skin
proteins to form a hapten-protein conjugate (Chapter 4). Langerhans cells,
which are antigen presenting cells in the skin, process the ‚Äònew‚Äô antigen and
present it to helper T lymphocytes, which become sensitized. Once this has

W^dad\nd[Y^hZVhZ

SUMMARY

happened, any further contact with the chemical will promote cytokine release
from T cells, producing a cascade similar to that of the Mantoux reaction.
Laboratory workers need to be aware of the skin sensitizing nature of many of
the chemicals used in biomedical science and to conduct risk assessments for
their use, since sensitization, once induced, is irreversible. The only treatment
for Type IV hypersensitivy is to avoid the allergen, although corticosteroid
creams may give some relief during an episode of dermatitis.

SUMMARY

Disorders of the immune system include immunodeficiencies, autoimmune
diseases and hypersensitivities. The lack of a component of the immune
system renders the sufferer much more susceptible to infectious disease and
some forms of cancer. These diseases may be treated by giving antibiotics and
antiviral drugs to treat infections and, where possible, to replace the missing
component by administration of antibodies or by a bone marrow transplant.
Autoimmune diseases occur when the mechanisms for preventing self-

reactivity fail. These diseases can be organ specific or systemic. They can be
treated with immunosuppressive drugs, although this renders the individual
more susceptible to infection. Hypersensitivities are classified into four types
depending on the underlying cause. They are best treated by avoiding contact

INTRODUCTION

Blood transfusion is the transfer of blood or blood products into the bloodstream of a patient who has lost blood due to injury, disease or an operation.
The amount and type of blood or component transfused depends on the
needs of the patient. Transfusions of blood and blood products are routine
and are generally safe therapeutic procedures that are rarely associated with
adverse reactions. However, it is only in the last hundred or so years that
the foundations of these procedures have been established. Similarly, the
transplantation of organs and solid tissues from one individual to another to

&',

replace diseased or nonfunctional tissue is now well established. However,
it is little more than 50 years since the first successful clinical transplant
of a kidney in 1954 paved the way for the range of tissue transplants currently available. Advances in the transplantation of bone marrow and stem
cells have brought the two fields of transfusion and transplantation closer
together.
This chapter will explain the role of the transfusion scientist and will discuss
the biochemical and genetic bases of a number of blood group systems and
the methods used to determine blood groups. In addition, the adverse reactions of transfusion and the consequences to a fetus of antibodies against fetal
erythrocytes being transmitted across the placenta will also be outlined. The
evidence for the immunological basis for the rejection of tissue transplants
will also be examined, together with the genetics of the HLA system, a series
of genes encoding proteins that stimulate rejection of tissues (Chapter 4).
The chapter will also consider how the rejection of tissues can be prevented
by immunosuppressive therapy and will review the set of circumstances
which result in graft versus host disease (GVHD), as well as considering the
consequences of GVHD for the relatively new treatments which involve
the transplantation of stem cells.

6.2

BLOOD AND BLOOD PRODUCTS FOR TRANSFUSION

The role of the biomedical scientist in the transfusion laboratory is to ensure
that the blood and blood products being transfused into a patient are safe.
To ensure safety, the blood is tested to determine its blood group and to
check that it is not contaminated with harmful microorganisms. In addition,
checks are made to ensure that the transfused blood does not contain antibodies that will destroy the erythrocytes of the recipient and cause death.
Blood transfusions are required to replace blood lost as a result of accident
or surgery. Surgical procedures which require transfusions include the transplantation of organs, such as the liver and heart, where significant bleeding
may occur. Blood may also be given to treat certain diseases, such as anemia.
Plasma may also be transfused to treat badly burned patients who have lost
significant amounts of fluid or in the treatment of bleeding disorders. Plasma
products, such as Factor VIII, to treat hemophilia (Chapter 13), or immunoglobulins, to treat certain immunodeficiency disorders (Chapter 5), may
also be given. Platelet concentrates are also used to treat bleeding disorders
(Figure 6.1).
In the UK, blood containing leukocytes is no longer transfused for a number
of reasons, as shown in Table 6.1. Sensitization to Major Histocompatibility
Complex (MHC) antigens, which are present on blood leukocytes but not
erythrocytes, may have consequences if the recipient later requires a transplant (Section 6.11) and GVHD may have a fatal outcome in immunosuppressed individuals. As a consequence, leukocytes are removed from blood,
usually within a few hours of collection. This involves filtering the blood
through leukocyte-specific filters, which trap the leukocytes but not the
smaller erythrocytes or platelets. Such a process is called leukodepletion and
it reduces the leukocyte count to less than 5 q 106 dm‚Äì3. The number of leukocytes left in blood can be assessed by counting in a hemocytometer, or by
using a flow cytometer (Box 6.1).

THE DISCOVERY OF THE BLOOD GROUP SYSTEMS

It has been known since the seventeenth century that the transfusion of blood
between individuals could have rapid and fatal consequences. Fortunately, in
1900 Landsteiner (1868‚Äì1943) discovered that individuals could be classified
into different groups depending on the characteristics of their erythrocytes
and the presence of specific antibodies in their plasma to erythrocyte antigens. These discoveries laid the foundations for the routine and safe therapeutic transfusion of blood. Landsteiner drew blood from a number of individuals
and separated the erythrocytes from the plasma. He then mixed together all
possible combinations of erythrocytes and plasma from these individuals
together and showed that only certain combinations resulted in the clumping or agglutination of the erythrocytes (Figure 6.2). These patterns of agglutination showed that there were different blood groups, which Landsteiner
named A, B and O. In 1902 von Decastelo (1872‚Äì1960) and Sturli (1873‚Äì1964)
discovered a fourth blood group which he called AB. It became clear that fatal
blood transfusions resulted from incompatible blood being transfused and

TRANSFUSION AND TRANSPLANTATION

BOX 6.1 The Ô¨Çow cytometer
The Ô¨Çow cytometer (Figure 6.3) is an instrument that can analyze
several properties of cells simultaneously in mixed populations.
The cells to be analyzed are passed as single cells in a stream
past a laser light source. This is usually achieved by having a
sheath of Ô¨Çuid passing through an oriÔ¨Åce of 50‚Äì300 Mm. The
sample is injected into the sheath Ô¨Çuid as it passes through the
oriÔ¨Åce. With the right sheath Ô¨Çuid Ô¨Çow rate, the sample and the
Ô¨Çuid do not mix (Figure 6.4). As the cells are illuminated by the
laser beam some of the light is scattered. The scattered light is
detected simultaneously by two detectors. One measures side
scatter, that is the light deÔ¨Çected 90¬∫ from the incident beam.
The other detects the light scattered in a forward direction up
to 10o from the incident beam. This is the forward scatter. The
intensity of the forward and side scatters are related to the size
and shape of the cells. The forward scatter is sensitive to the surface characteristics of the cell, whereas side scatter is more sensitive to the granularity of a cell. Thus a mixed population of cells
can be analyzed on the basis of these measurements. In addition

that these procedures were successful when the blood transfused was of an
identical blood group. The discovery of the ABO blood group system led to
Landsteiner receiving the Nobel Prize for Physiology and Medicine in 1930.
Landsteiner later discovered other blood group systems, including the Rh system. Since then, numerous other systems have been discovered, as shown in

&(%

THE DISCOVERY OF THE BLOOD GROUP SYSTEMS

to forward and side scatter, cells can be stained with Ô¨Çuorescent
antibodies to proteins that are characteristic of a cell population. For example, in a mixed population of lymphocytes, the
T lymphocytes (Chapter 4) could be stained with a Ô¨Çuorescent
antibody to the CD3 marker. This would allow T lymphocytes to
be distinguished from B lymphocytes, which do not have this
protein. As the cells are illuminated in the laser beam the T lymphocytes will Ô¨Çuoresce, and this Ô¨Çuorescence is picked up by
further detectors, using appropriate Ô¨Ålters. The intensity of the
Ô¨Çuorescence is related to the amount of CD3 on the surface of
the cell (Figure 6.5).

The Ô¨Çow cytometer is used in many aspects of pathology science. In transfusion it can be used, for example, to measure the
number of fetal erythrocytes in the maternal circulation following a placental bleed. In transplantation it may be used to evaluate the results of a cross match (Section 6.11).

It is also possible to distinguish different populations simultaneously if they are stained with antibodies to unique marker
proteins and if the antibodies are conjugated to different Ô¨Çuorescent molecules. Thus, helper T lymphocytes (TH cells) can be
stained with a Ô¨Çuorochrome labeled antibody to CD4. At the
same time all the T cells can be stained with an antibody to
CD3 which is conjugated to a different Ô¨Çuorochrome. Analysis
by Ô¨Çow cytometry would reveal four populations of small lymphocytes: those which are CD3‚Äì and CD4‚Äì, presumably BC
lymphocytes, those that are CD3+ and CD4‚Äì, presumably TC
lymphocytes, those that are CD3‚Äì and CD4+, a very minor
population, and those that are CD3+ and CD4+, that is, the
TH cells (Figure 6.6).

THE ABO BLOOD GROUP SYSTEM (ISBT 001)

The ABO blood group system classifies people into one of four major blood
groups: A, B, AB and O, according to the different type of antigen present on
the surfaces of their erythrocytes. The frequencies of these blood groups vary
between different populations (Table 6.3).

THE ANTIGENS OF THE ABO SYSTEM
The antigens that determine ABO blood groups are oligosaccharide constituents of cell surface glycolipids and glycoprotein. These sugars are added to
an existing chain of oligosaccharides which protrudes from the erythrocyte
membrane (Figure 6.7). The H gene, located on chromosome 19, encodes an
enzyme, L-fucosyl transferase, which adds L-fucose to the terminal galactose,
to form the H antigen. In blood group O individuals, the H antigen is found
on their erythrocytes and also on a variety of other cells. People of blood
group A and AB possess the A gene, encoded on chromosome 9. This gene
encodes N-acetylgalactosaminyl transferase which adds N-acetylgalactosamine to the terminal galactose of the H antigen, to form the A antigen. This
antigen is found on the erythrocytes of individuals of blood group A and AB.
The B gene, which is allelic to the A gene, encodes D-galactosyl transferase
which adds D-galactose to the terminal galactose of the H antigen, to form
the B antigen. This antigen is found on the erythrocytes of blood groups B
and AB individuals. The O gene, also allelic to the A and B genes, does not
appear to produce a protein, that is, it is a silent gene. The A, B and O genes
are inherited in a Mendelian fashion (Chapter 15) and A and B are codominant. The genotypes that determine the different phenotypes in the ABO
system are shown in Table 6.4.

TRANSFUSION AND TRANSPLANTATION

Approximately 75% of Caucasians attach A, B and H antigens (depending on
their blood group) to soluble proteins and secrete them into saliva and other
body fluids, and are known as secretors. Secretor status is dependent on the
expression of a fucosyl transferase, which is encoded by the SECRETOR gene
on chromosome 19. In the past, the presence or absence of secreted ABH antigens has been used in forensic science for the purpose of identification.

ANTIBODIES OF THE ABO BLOOD GROUP SYSTEM
Transfusion of ABO incompatible blood causes problems because individuals
possess plasma antibodies to the complementary antigens. Thus, people of
blood group A have antibodies to the B antigen, those with blood group B
have antibodies to the A antigen (Table 6.5). People of blood group AB have
neither antibody, while those of blood group O possess both. These antibodies
will agglutinate erythrocytes of the complementary group. The pattern of
agglutination when serum and erythrocytes of different ABO types are mixed
in vitro is shown in Table 6.6.

Table 6.6 Patterns of hemagglutination when sera and cells of different ABO types are mixed

Antibodies directed against the ABO antigens generally belong to the IgM
class though IgG antibodies (Chapter 4) may also be found. IgM antibodies are
pentameric molecules, which are efficient agglutinators of cells and activators of complement. These antibodies, which are sometimes called isohemagglutinins because they agglutinate erythrocytes, are sometimes also termed
‚Äònatural antibodies‚Äô because they are present even though people have never
been ‚Äòimmunized‚Äô with blood of an inappropriate group. In fact, the blood
group antigens are also found on some common bacteria and the antibodies
that are produced following infection are capable of cross-reacting with blood
group antigens. Of course, people do not make antibodies to antigens that
they themselves express, because of immunological tolerance (Chapter 5).

CONSEQUENCES OF ABO INCOMPATIBLE TRANSFUSIONS
An example of an incompatible blood transfusion would be when a patient
of blood group A, the recipient, is given blood from a donor who is blood
group B. In this case the anti-B antibodies present in the plasma of the

&()

THE Rh BLOOD GROUP SYSTEM (ISBT 004)

recipient bind to the donated erythrocytes and activate complement. This
results in the simultaneous lysis of billions of erythrocytes in the donated
blood. At the same time, the limited amount of anti-A antibodies in the
donated blood binds to the recipient‚Äôs erythrocytes and hemolyzes those
too. The lysis of so many erythrocytes, called acute intravascular hemolysis,
releases so much hemoglobin that acute renal failure and shock result. This
has serious clinical consequences and, indeed, is fatal in approximately 10%
of cases. In addition to the problems caused by the release of hemoglobin, the
fragments of erythrocyte membrane released may also initiate the blood clotting systems, leading to disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). The
consequences of an incompatible transfusion may vary according to the blood
group involved. For example, antibodies to some of the other blood group
systems may result in a delayed, extravascular hemolysis. Slower destruction
of the donated cells may lead to a decreasing hemoglobin concentration, with
the patient suffering a fever and general malaise.
The administration of an incompatible donation is most often due to errors
postdonation, and is rarely due to mismatching of bloods.

6.5

THE Rh BLOOD GROUP SYSTEM (ISBT 004)

The Rh blood group system divides people into Rh positive and Rh negative
groups depending on whether or not their erythrocytes carry the Rh antigen. Landsteiner and Wiener discovered this system in 1940. They showed
that antisera raised in guinea pigs against erythrocytes from rhesus monkeys
reacted with 85% of Caucasian blood donors in New York. The Rh system of
blood group antigens is often described as if it is a single antigen. However,
it consists of a complex series of antigens, which are specified by two genes:
RHD and RHCE. The former encodes the RhD protein which expresses the D
antigen while the latter encodes the RhCcEe protein which carries either the
C or c antigen together with the E or e antigen. At one time it was thought that
another antigen, termed the ‚Äòd‚Äô antigen, was present when the D antigen was
absent. It is now recognized that the d antigen does not exist. However the
term is still used to indicate the D negative phenotype.
An individual person inherits a set of genes from each parent, with the possible haplotypes (haploid genotypes) being shown in Table 6.7, where the
symbol ‚Äòd‚Äô is used to express a lack of the RHD gene. Under the Fisher system for nomenclature, each Rh haplotype is assigned a code. The commonest
genotypes are shown in Table 6.8. If an individual has the D antigen, they are
said to be RhD positive. Thus, amongst the most common genotypes the only

individuals who are RhD negative are those with the genotype dce/dce (or rr
using the Fisher code) and these constitute 15% of Caucasians. RhD negative individuals do not normally have antibodies to the D antigen. However,
they can become sensitized if transfused with blood from an Rh positive individual. For example, a person with the genotype dce/dce who is transfused
with blood from a DCE/DCE individual may make antibodies to C, D and E
antigens, although anti-D antibodies are the most common.

HEMOLYTIC DISEASE OF THE NEWBORN
Hemolytic disease of the newborn (HDN) is a serious disease characterized
by anemia, splenomegaly, hepatomegaly and edema. The condition is caused
by the transfer of maternal anti-erythrocyte antibodies across the placenta.
The condition may arise in the offspring of women who are RhD negative.
Such women may become sensitized to RhD antigen when they give birth
to an RhD positive child. At birth, some of the baby‚Äôs blood can enter the
maternal circulation and the mother will respond by making anti-D antibodies. This does not have any clinical consequence for the child itself, but may
cause problems during a subsequent pregnancy, if that fetus is RhD positive. Antibodies to Rh antigens are clinically significant during pregnancy
because they are of the IgG class. Thus they can cross the placenta and bind
to the fetal erythrocytes. Although Rh antibodies are IgG, they do not appear
to activate complement. Instead, the antibody-coated erythrocytes bind to
receptors for the Fc portion of IgG (Chapter 4) on monocytes and macrophages, a phenomenon known as immune adherence. This occurs when
blood is traveling through the spleen and liver. The uptake and subsequent
destruction of antibody-coated erythrocytes in these organs is known as
extravascular hemolysis.
The consequences for the second or subsequent child depend on the extent
of maternal sensitization and, hence, the amount of circulating antibody.
Destruction of fetal erythrocytes in utero may lead to fetal anemia and
hyperbilirubinemia, an excess of bilirubin in the blood (Chapter 13). The
concentrations of serum bilirubin indicate the degree of hemolysis. Babies
born with significant levels of bilirubin will suffer kernicterus or brain
damage due to the build up of the lipid soluble bilirubin in the brain. The
baby will need phototherapy, which helps to breakdown the bilirubin
(Chapters 11 and 13).
If the anemia is severe, the fetus may die of heart failure or hydrops fetalis,
which is an extreme edema of the entire body of the fetus. This may lead to

&(+

THE Rh BLOOD GROUP SYSTEM (ISBT 004)

spontaneous abortion. A longer term child may be stillborn. The considerably
enlarged spleen and liver in a child born alive with HDN is associated with
erythrocyte destruction in these organs. The baby may also have a facial rash
indicative of hemorrhages due to impaired platelet function.
The commonest cause of HDN is antibody to the RhD antigen although it may
also be caused by antibodies to other blood group antigens, for example, antibodies to blood group A or B antigens, if the antibodies are of the IgG class. In
addition, antibodies to the Rhc antigen, and to the Kell blood group antigen
(Section 6.6), may also be involved.
All pregnant women in the UK and other developed countries now have
their ABO and Rh status checked at their initial hospital booking, which is
usually at 12‚Äì16 weeks of pregnancy. They are also checked for anti-D, anti-c
or anti-Kell (Section 6.6) and, if these are present, the concentrations will be
monitored regularly throughout the second trimester of pregnancy. If the
levels of clinically significant antibodies start to rise, clinical intervention
may be necessary. Concentrations of anti-D below 4 international units (IU)
cm‚Äì3 are unlikely to cause HDN, those between 4‚Äì15 IU cm‚Äì3 have a moderate risk of HDN, while values above 15 IU cm‚Äì3 are associated with a high
risk of HDN.

Margin Note 6.1 HDN and the

i

Hemolytic disease of the newborn
does not occur within the ABO
system if Anti-A and Anti-B are of the
IgM class. This is because IgM does
not cross the placenta. In addition,
a woman who is blood group A,
RhD negative, is unlikely to become
sensitized to a fetus who is blood
group B, RhD positive because,
when the fetal red cells enter her
circulation following the birth, her
anti-B antibodies will destroy the fetal
erythrocytes before sensitization to
RhD can occur.

Since the 1970s, a prophylactic treatment to prevent Rh sensitization has
been available which has greatly reduced the incidence of HDN due to RhD
sensitization. The treatment involves the intramuscular injection of at least
500 IU of anti-D immunoglobulin within 72 h of the birth of a RhD positive
baby. The administered antibodies bind to any erythrocytes from the baby
which have entered the maternal circulation and destroy them, preventing
the mother from making antibodies.

In 2002, the National Institute for Clinical Excellence (NICE) in the UK recommended that antenatal anti-D prophylaxis should be routinely offered to any
pregnant Rh negative woman who has not made anti-D antibodies to prevent
sensitization predelivery caused by, for example, a placental bleed.

The direct antiglobulin test (DAT), formerly known as the Direct Coombs

erythrocytes. If they are present, then a sample of the erythrocytes from the
baby will be agglutinated by an antibody to IgG, known as antihuman globulin (Figure 6.8).

The Kleihauer test uses the Kleihauer-Betke stain and is a method of assessing the volume of fetal blood that has entered the maternal circulation. In
most cases the volume that has entered will be less than 4 cm3, and 500 IU of
Anti-D is sufficient to remove the erythrocytes in this volume. However, for
less than 1% of women, the volume of fetal blood is larger and the mother
consequently needs more than this amount of anti-D. The Kleihauer test is
carried out on a sample of maternal blood 2 h after delivery. The principle
of the test is that the hemoglobin in adult erythrocytes can be eluted with
acid, whereas the hemoglobin of fetal erythrocytes is resistant to acid elution. A smear of maternal blood is placed in a solution of hematoxylin and
hydrochloric acid, pH 1.5, and then is counterstained with eosin. The maternal red cells appear as pale ‚Äòghosts‚Äô whereas the fetal erythrocytes stain pink
with eosin, while the leukocytes stain blue (Figure 6.9). The ratio of fetal to
maternal cells is an indicator of the volume of blood that has entered the
circulation. This test can also be carried out during pregnancy if a placental
bleed is suspected.

OTHER BLOOD GROUP SYSTEMS

The Lewis blood group system (ISBT 007, symbol Le) is related the Lewis
antigens Lea and Leb present on erythrocytes. However, these antigens are
not integral parts of the membrane but are soluble plasma proteins which
become reversibly adsorbed onto erythrocyte membranes. The levels of
bound antigens therefore vary, although the erythrocytes of children 2 years
old and above have approximately adult levels.
The Lea and Leb antigens are not the products of different forms of a single
gene, but arise from different actions of a fucosyl transferase that attaches
fucose residues to an oligosaccharide known as type-1 precursor oligosaccharide. If the fucose is added to a subterminal position it produces the Lea
antigen, whereas attachment to the terminal position gives the Leb antigen.
Approximately 72% of white populations are Le(a‚Äìb+), that is, they lack the
Lea but have the Leb, 22% are Le(a+b‚Äì), and 6% lack both antigens. Antibodies
to the Le antigens are usually of the IgM class and, as such, do not cause HDN
since they do not cross the placenta.
The Duffy system of blood group antigens (ISBT 008, symbol FY) is comprised
of six antigens, of which Fya and Fyb are the most significant in transfusion
reactions. These antigens are expressed on an erythrocyte membrane glycoprotein and also form the site of attachment for malarial parasites (Chapter 2).
Thus a Fy(a‚Äìb‚Äì) individual, who does not express the blood group antigens,
has a selective advantage in a malarial area. Indeed, 68% of blacks of African
descent are of this phenotype, which is rare in whites. Antibodies to Duffy
antigens belong to the IgG class and may cause HDN.
The Kidd antigens (ISBT 009, symbol JK) are expressed on a membrane glycoprotein, which is associated with urea transport. The Jka and Jkb antigens
result from the expression of a codominant pair of genes. Approximately 27%
of whites, and 57% of blacks are Jk(a+ b‚Äì) while 50% of whites and 34% of
blacks are Jk(a+ b+). The Jk(a‚Äìb+) phenotype is found in 23% of whites and

&(-

LABORATORY DETERMINATION OF BLOOD GROUPS

only 9% of blacks, while the Jk(a‚Äìb‚Äì) phenotype is rare in both populations.
Antibodies to Jka and Jkb belong to the IgM or the IgG class and may cause a
mild form of HDN.
The Kell blood group system (ISBT 006, symbol KEL) is formed from 24 antigens expressed on a glycoprotein of the erythrocyte membrane. The antigen
K (formerly Kell) is highly immunogenic and IgM or IgG antibodies to it are
common in transfused patients. Similarly, antibodies to its allele, designated
k (formerly Cellano), can also cause HDN, although specific antibodies are
rare in transfused patients.

6.7

LABORATORY DETERMINATION OF BLOOD GROUPS

Traditional methods for determining blood groups rely on the agglutination of erythrocytes by antibodies, usually referred to as hemagglutination.
Hemagglutination can be carried out on glass microscopy slides or in microtiter plates in which agglutination patterns are easily distinguished from the
settling of erythrocytes. Recent years have seen increasing use of the Diamed
typing system to detect hemagglutination. This is a system which uses monoclonal typing antibodies, distributed in a gel, contained in individual tubes
set in plastic ‚Äòcards‚Äô. Cells are added to the antibodies and the cards are centrifuged. Where agglutination has occurred, the agglutinates remain on top
of the gel, whereas nonagglutinated cells settle through the gel to the bottom
(Figure 6.10). Most transfusion laboratories now use gel technology for blood
grouping and compatibility testing.
Whichever technique is used, a blood group, such as the ABO grouping, is
determined by incubating the individual‚Äôs erythrocytes with antibodies to
known antigens (anti-A and anti-B in this case) and also mixing the individual‚Äôs plasma with erythrocytes of known A, B, AB or O blood groups. The
pattern of hemagglutination shown will enable the determination of the blood
group.
Hemagglutination occurs when antibodies to an erythrocyte antigen crosslink the cells, forming visible aggregates. The extent of hemagglutination
depends on the temperature, pH and the ionic strength of the medium.
Agglutination is favored in low ionic strength saline (LISS). Erythrocytes have
a net electronegative charge and repulsive forces normally keep them about
20 nm apart. When antibodies bind to the erythrocyte, the reduced surface
charge allows the cells to agglutinate. This is most effectively achieved with
IgM antibodies, which can cause direct agglutination of erythrocytes. To
obtain a direct agglutination with IgG antibodies, it is usually necessary to
include bovine serum albumin in the medium, which masks the charges on
the erythrocytes and allows them to come closer together. Another method
of reducing the negative charge is to use proteolytic enzymes to remove surface proteins that carry the charge. The enzyme can be added to the erythrocytes prior to the addition of the antibody, or all the components can be
added together. Polycationic polymers such as polybrene will also reduce
the negative charge on erythrocytes.
The antiglobulin test (Section 6.5) uses the ability of antihuman globulin
(AHG) to agglutinate erythrocytes coated with nonagglutinating erythrocytespecific IgG. This can be used to detect erythrocytes already coated with antierythrocyte IgG in the direct antiglobulin test (DAT), or can be used on cells
which have been incubated with antibody in vitro (see Figure 6.8).

TRANSFUSION AND TRANSPLANTATION

6.8

ROLE OF COMPLEMENT IN TRANSFUSION REACTIONS

In Chapter 4, the ‚Äòbeneficial‚Äô role of complement in eliminating immunogens was discussed. The activation of complement is also involved in some
forms of immunological hypersensitivity and can cause some of the problems associated with autoimmune disease (Chapter 5). However, given that
it amplifies the actions of antibodies, complement can cause many of the
problems associated with transfusion reactions. Thus, complement causes
lysis of sensitized erythrocytes, that is, erythrocytes coated with antierythrocyte antibodies.

C1q
Stalk

Figure 6.11 A diagram of the C1q molecule
to show the six sites (‚Äòheads‚Äô), each of which
can bind to an Fc region of an IgG or an IgM
molecule.

The classical pathway for complement activation is initiated when IgG or IgM
binds to an epitope, in this case on the erythrocyte‚Äôs membrane. The antibody
could be IgM, as is usually the case with Anti-A or Anti-B, or IgG, as is the
case with antibodies to Rh antigens. The binding of antibody to the epitope
induces a conformational change in the Fc region of IgG or IgM, allowing the
binding of C1 protein. The C1 is comprised of three loosely associated proteins called C1q, C1r and C1s. The C1q is a large protein and has several binding sites allowing it to bind to multiple Fc regions of antibodies (Figure 6.11).
It requires at least two of these sites to bind to adjacent Fc regions on the surface of a cell to activate complement. For this reason IgM, which has several
Fc regions per molecule, is more efficient than IgG at activating complement.
Indeed, a single molecule of IgM can activate complement, whereas it takes
about 1000 molecules of IgG to achieve the density required for activation. The
binding of C1q activates C1r and this, in turn, activates C1s which acquires
proteolytic activity (Figure 6.12). C1s has two substrates: C4 and C2 each of
which are hydrolyzed to two fragments: C4a, C4b and C2a and C2b respectively. Proteins C4b and C2a are the larger fragments in each case and they
combine to form a new proteolytic enzyme, C4b2a. A single enzyme molecule
can generate a number of product molecules. Thus for a limited number of
antibody molecules, many molecules of C4b2a are formed, because enzymic
steps allow amplification to occur. C4b2a is the classical pathway C3 convertase (Chapter 4) which cleaves C3 into two fragments: a larger C3b molecule
and a C3a. The former binds to the target cell membrane where it may bind
a molecule of the C3 convertase to form a C5 convertase, which catalyzes
the hydrolysis of C5 into C5a and C5b. C5b binds to the cell membrane and
forms a site for the build up of the Membrane Attack Complex (MAC). This is
a large, cylindrical, hydrophobic structure constructed from single molecules
of C5b, C6, C7, C8 and several molecules of C9. When it inserts into the membrane it forms a pore of approximately 10 nm diameter. Since amplification
has occurred at each enzymic step, the target cell membrane may be covered
with MACs (Figure 6.13). The MACs allow small ions to equilibrate across the
cell membrane, increasing the osmotic pressure within the cell so that water
moves across the membrane into the cell causing it to lyze. In vitro this can
be seen as a sudden clearing of the cloudy suspension of erythrocytes. In
vivo, several regulatory proteins may prevent direct lysis of the erythrocytes.
Instead, the cells are lyzed by phagocytic cells that have receptors for C3b and
other complement proteins on their membranes. Table 6.9 lists some of the
receptors involved in the clearance of sensitized erythrocytes. In the transfusion laboratory it is much easier to look for complement proteins on erythrocytes than to look for antibodies, since a small amount of antibody may result
in large amounts of complement on the cells. Thus, the presence of complement proteins on cells is used as an indicator of the presence of complement
binding antibodies.
It is essential for the transfusion scientist to be able to detect hemolytic antibodies. Such antibodies may be present due to transfusion reactions, to HDN
or they may be autoantibodies to erythrocytes, as happens in autoimmune
hemolytic anemia. The presence of relevant antibodies may be detected in

&)%

C1q

Table 6.9 Complement receptors

C1r

samples of serum by hemolysis in vitro using the complement activity in the
serum or they may be detected by examining the surface of erythrocytes for
activated complement proteins. The presence of complement in serum diminishes with storage, therefore it is recommended that samples of sera should be
stored at ‚Äì20¬∫C to retain activity if they are to be used for hemolysis determination. Further, some anticoagulants, such as EDTA, inhibit complement,
which may be significant if plasma rather than serum is available. Other sera
may have ‚Äòanticomplementary‚Äô activity due to the presence of a denatured
form of complement known as complementoid.

C1s

Receptors for C3b are found on all the major types of phagocytic cells and also
on erythrocytes themselves, so that even these cells have a role in the clearance of immune complexes from the blood. Antigen‚Äìantibody complexes
coated in C3b bind to erythrocytes and are removed by macrophages in the
spleen and liver.
In vivo, other complement proteins trigger inflammatory reactions. For example, C3a, C4a and C5a cause blood basophils and tissue mast cells to degranulate. The mediators released stimulate inflammation (Chapter 4), which may
have consequences in a patient who has anti-erythrocyte antibodies. In addition, both C3a and C5a are chemotactic factors for neutrophils and promote a
build up of these cells, which may itself lead to clinical problems.
The alternative pathway for complement activation is a positive feedback
loop which is usually initiated by microorganisms such as bacteria and yeasts.
However, feedback may utilize C3b, produced in the classical pathway, and
amplify the amount of C3b produced. The positive feedback loop is controlled to prevent an overproduction of C3b. One regulatory step binds C3b to a
plasma protein called Factor H and in the bound form is inactivated by Factor
I, which converts it to C3bi, a form that can no longer enter the amplification
loop. C3b may then be degraded into smaller fragments, C3dg and C3d, which
may remain bound to the erythrocyte membrane. The presence of natural
regulators means that many antibodies that are potentially able to lyze erythrocytes are unable to do so in vitro and the transfusion scientist may look for
the presence of C3d on erythrocytes to determine whether antibodies to them
are present.

HAZARDS OF TRANSFUSION

One hazard of transfusion is a hemolytic transfusion reaction (HTR) if preexisting antibodies are present in the recipient. This may result in acute intravascular hemolysis, as in ABO incompatibility, or in delayed extravascular
hemolysis, as with several of the other blood group systems. Acute intravascular hemolysis has serious clinical consequences and, indeed, may be fatal.
With delayed extravascular hemolysis the patient may suffer fever and general
malaise as the donated erythrocytes are destroyed and the hemoglobin levels

Hazards of Transfusion group

i

In the UK, adverse reactions to transfusion are reported to the Serious
Hazards of Transfusion (SHOT) group
based at the Manchester Blood
Centre. Here, the data are collected
and an annual report is produced.
This process enables trends to be
recognized, and recommendations
on safe practice in transfusion to be
made.

TRANSFUSION AND TRANSPLANTATION

fall. To prevent either occurrence, the recipient should be screened before the
transfusion for the presence of anti-erythrocyte antibodies.
The transfusion of leukocytes may also lead to adverse reactions, such as
nonhemolytic febrile transfusion reactions. Such patients exhibit flushing,
fever, rigors and hypotension. These may be caused by the reaction between
antibodies and leukocyte antigens in the recipient, resulting in the lysis of
donated leukocytes and release of cytokines from them. In addition, activated
complement proteins cause the release of histamine from basophils, triggering inflammatory reactions. As all blood is leukodepleted before transfusion,
such reactions are rare.

TRANSFUSION RELATED ACUTE LUNG INJURY
Transfusion related acute lung injury (TRALI) is a life-threatening complication of transfusion. It presents as a rapidly progressing and severe respiratory
failure with diffuse damage to alveolar cells and the filling of alveolar spaces
with fluid. Histological examinations reveal an infiltration of the alveoli with
neutrophils and monocytes, indicative of an acute inflammatory reaction.
The symptoms of TRALI include dyspnea, cyanosis, hypotension, fever and
pulmonary edema, which usually occur within 6 h of transfusion. The condition is thought to arise from the interaction of leukocytes and specific
antileukocyte antibodies, usually in the donor plasma, though occasionally
in that of the recipient. The most likely antibodies are those to the Major
Histocompatibility (MHC) antigens, which are commonest in women who
have had multiple pregnancies (Section 6.11) and in males and females who
have received multiple transfusions. In addition, antibodies to neutrophil
antigens have also been implicated.
TRALI has been reported to occur after transfusion of fresh frozen plasma,
platelets, whole blood and concentrated erythrocytes. In the UK in 2003, 36
cases of suspected TRALI were reported to SHOT. Nine patients died, seven
possibly, and one definitely due to transfusion. Plasma-rich components were
implicated in 20/21 cases in which there was proven leukocyte incompatibility between the patients and the donor. In 2004, however, 23 suspected
cases were reported in the UK. Of these, 13 were highly likely to be TRALI and
were linked to fresh frozen plasma, in six cases, platelets in four, erythrocytes
in two and whole blood in one. The incidence of TRALI has since decreased
in the UK, due to the processing of fresh frozen plasma from untransfused
male donors who have tested negative for antileukocyte antibodies.

IRON OVERLOAD
Patients who receive many transfusions over a long period of time may
develop iron overload. The excess of iron, for which there is no excretory
route, from transfused blood may cause tissue damage, especially to the
liver, heart and endocrine glands. Signs of iron overload can be detected
after 10‚Äì20 transfusions and the condition may be fatal if left untreated.
Patients should be treated with a chelating agent such as deferrioxamine
mesylate to remove unwanted iron (Chapter 13).

ALLOIMMUNIZATION
Patients who receive regular erythrocyte transfusions may become immunized to other blood group antigens present on the ABO compatible cells.
This may have consequences for future transfusions. If patients receive whole
blood, rather than leukodepleted blood, they may become immunized to the
MHC antigens on the foreign leukocytes. This may become clinically significant if in the future they require an organ transplant (Section 6.11). However,

&)'

W^dad\nd[Y^hZVhZ

SCREENING OF BLOOD DONORS

the increasing use of leukodepleted blood, in which the leukocytes have been
removed prior to transfusion, prevents the immunization of recipient to these
antigens.

GRAFT VERSUS HOST DISEASE
Graft versus host disease (GVHD) is a potentially fatal condition which is
associated with the transfusion of whole blood or blood products, such as
packed erythrocytes or platelets, which contain residual lymphocytes. It
usually results from the transfusion of leukocytes into an immunodeficient
patient or when blood is transfused into neonates or premature babies.
The small lymphocytes present in the donated blood recognize the antigens of the recipient as foreign and mount an immune response against
them. The donor lymphocytes proliferate in the patient and attack tissues,
causing enlargement of the spleen and liver, diarrhea and an extensive
skin rash. Acute GVHD may be fatal and for this reason it is recommended
that products such as packed erythrocytes be irradiated prior to use to prevent residual small lymphocytes from reacting to the host antigens. Graft
versus host reaction can also be a consequence of bone marrow transplantation (Section 6.14). Frozen plasma is safe in this respect, since freezing
destroys leukocytes. Transfusion associated GVHD is not usually linked to
AIDS.

INFECTIONS
One potential hazard of transfusion is infection with microorganisms present
in the donor. In the past, blood transfusions have spread infections such as
HIV (Chapter 4) and hepatitis C (Chapter 11) to the patient. For this reason
there is now extensive screening of blood donors (Section 6.10).

Margin Note 6.3 Plasmapheresis
and leukapheresis

i

Different components of the blood
can be isolated as the donation
is occurring by sending the blood
through a cell separator. A catheter
is Ô¨Årst inserted into the vein of the
donor. Blood entering the catheter
is transferred to the cell separator
where it is centrifuged at a speed
necessary to collect the required
component. The blood, minus the
component that has been removed,
is returned to the donor via a catheter inserted into a vein in the other
arm. Plasmapheresis is the collection of plasma, with the return of the
erythrocytes and leukocytes to the
donor. Leukapheresis is the collection of leukocytes, with plasma and
erythrocytes being returned. Similarly,
plateletpheresis involves the collection of platelets, with all other
components being returned. The term
apheresis is a general term that covers the collection of speciÔ¨Åc blood
components in this way.

6.10 SCREENING OF BLOOD DONORS
Transfusion scientists must be assured that the process of transfusing blood
poses minimal risk to the patient and donor alike. Aside from the obvious
need for blood to be carefully matched to avoid a possibly fatal transfusion
reaction, it is essential that donors are carefully screened to avoid those who
are ill or who may be harmed by giving blood, or whose blood poses a health
risk because, for example, it is contaminated with certain viruses even though
the donor shows no signs of ill health.
In the UK, blood is taken from healthy donors aged between 17 and 70 and
is a voluntary and unpaid activity. Potential donors who are excluded from
donation include individuals with HIV or hepatitis viral infections, as well as
individuals who are at risk of becoming HIV and/or hepatitis virus positive,
for example prostitutes, drug abusers who inject themselves with drugs, and
individuals who have had sex with men or women living in Africa (Table 6.10).
In addition, people with low hemoglobin levels (below 135 g dm‚Äì3 and 125 g
dm‚Äì3 for men and women respectively), those who have had infectious diseases such as a cold or sore throat within the last seven days or viral infections
such as measles, mumps, rubella, chickenpox, shingles or herpes simplex
cold sores within the last three weeks. Other reasons for exclusion include the
recent use of therapeutic drugs, for example aspirin, antibiotics, antihistamines and antidepressants.
All donated blood is screened for a variety of infectious agent as shown in
Table 6.11. Some tests are mandatory while others are optional. Optional tests
such as those for cytomegalovirus (CMV) are used when the blood is to be
transfused into immunocompromized individuals.

BOX 6.2 ArtiÔ¨Åcial blood
The potential risks arising from the transfusion of blood have led
to research into the development of an artiÔ¨Åcial blood or blood
substitute that would alleviate these risks. In addition, the supply
of blood in some regions of the world is too small to make its
availability reliable. For an artiÔ¨Åcial material to be a ‚Äògood‚Äô blood
substitute it should contain a material that will carry appropriate
amounts of oxygen around the body. In addition, the Ô¨Çuid carrier
must be isotonic to prevent cell lysis due to osmotic differences.
It must also be able to withstand sterilization to prevent the risk
of infection. Two classes of artiÔ¨Åcial blood substitute have been
investigated. One is based on the use of solutions of modiÔ¨Åed
hemoglobin, the other has involved the use of products based
on perÔ¨Çuorocarbons.

&))

MODIFIED HEMOGLOBINS
Originally, these substitutes were based on free hemoglobin
extracted from erythrocytes. However, it became apparent that
free hemoglobin is associated with renal toxicity. Hemoglobin
inside the erythrocyte forms tetrameric molecules whereas outside the erythrocyte it forms toxic dimers. Cross-linking the
tetramers or processing them to polymers prevents dimer formation. However, success has been limited. The use of hemoglobin-based solutions has been hampered by severe side effects
including hypertension and vasoconstriction. One cross-linked
hemoglobin product was withdrawn from a phase II clinical
trial in 1998 because of unacceptably high mortality compared
with standard treatments. However, other attempts may prove
to be more useful.

TRANSPLANTATION OF SOLID TISSUES AND ORGANS

6.11 TRANSPLANTATION OF SOLID TISSUES AND ORGANS
The transplantation of solid tissues from one individual to another for therapeutic purposes is a fairly routine medical procedure. Interest in transplantation mainly arose during the Second World War during attempts to treat badly
burned airmen using skin grafts from unrelated donors. Indeed, it was from
experiments with skin grafting in rodents that the role of the immune system
in the rejection of transplants was identified. Moreover, once this role was
recognized, the search for drugs that could prevent rejection became more
focused. The first successful kidney transplant was performed by Murray
(1919‚Äì) in 1954 while the first human heart transplant, by Barnard (1922‚Äì
2001), was performed in 1967.
Once technical problems associated with the transplantation of whole organs
were overcome, the major problem associated with transplanting organs was,
and remains, rejection. This is caused by the immune system of the recipient recognizing the cells of the donated organ as foreign and mounting an
immune response against them. Unless steps are taken to prevent it, transplant rejection is inevitable, unless the donor and the recipient are identical
twins. However, organ transplantation is now remarkably advanced compared
with initial attempts. Indeed, a range of transplants are routinely performed
(Table 6.12).

IMMUNOLOGICAL REJECTION OF TRANSPLANTS
The rejection of a transplant is due to the immune system of the recipient
recognizing the donated cells as foreign, that is nonself. Thus, the greater
the genetic disparity between the donor and recipient, the greater the
chances of rejection. The commonest type of clinical transplant is called
an allograft, that is, a graft between two genetically nonidentical people.
However, isografts, in which pieces of tissue are transplanted from one site
to another on the same individual are also routinely undertaken, for example in skin grafting to treat burns. Isografts are not rejected since the donor
and recipient are, of course, genetically identical. Occasionally, the graft
may come from another species, such as those occasions when a baboon
heart has been transplanted into a human. Such grafts are known as xenogeneic transplants. Xenogeneic transplants are also subject to rejection,

In 2003, trials at the Karolinska hospital in Stockholm used an
artiÔ¨Åcial blood to treat patients. The product was said to transport oxygen through the body ‚Äòbetter than real blood‚Äô. It is
thought that the substitute was based on hemoglobin solutions.
In October 2005, the American Food and Drug Administration
(FDA) was reported to be conducting a trial with patients in
Kansas. Patients traveling by emergency ambulance to hospitals
in four counties in the state were being given an artiÔ¨Åcial blood
substitute called PolyHeme, rather than saline, to treat severe
bleeding.

PERFLUOROCARBON-BASED SOLUTIONS
PerÔ¨Çuorocarbons (PCFs) are compounds in which Ô¨Çuoride and

CZhhVg6]bZY!BVjgZZc9Vlhdc!8]g^hHb^i]:YLddY

bromide atoms are attached to an inert carbon chain. They
are able to dissolve large quantities of oxygen and have been
shown to improve the oxygenation of tissues, even at low
doses. However, PCFs are immiscible with water and must be
administered as emulsions. They have been investigated over
a considerable period. In 1966 mice were found to survive a
10-min immersion in an oxygen saturated PCF liquid and were
able to breathe atmospheric oxygen when removed from the
trial. Several products based on PCFs have been the subjects of
clinical trials, although patients also have to breathe 70‚Äì100%
oxygen and Ô¨Çu-like symptoms have been reported. The use of
PFCs to enhance artiÔ¨Åcially the performance of athletes has also
been reported.

owing to the increased genetic disparity between the donor and the recipient. Other more common examples of xenogeneic grafts involve the use of
porcine and bovine heart valves to replace diseased human ones. In the latter case the valves are treated with glutaraldehyde to stiffen them and to
mask their antigenic determinants, and these are often referred to as bioprosthetic valves. There is much debate about proposals to breed genetically engineered transgenic pigs to carry some human antigens on their
cells to provide transplants for humans. Apart from the ethics of breeding
animals purely to supply organs for humans, there is also the risk of the
transfer of an unknown virus from pigs to humans, with possible disastrous
consequences.

CAUSES OF GRAFT REJECTION
The transplanted cells of an allograft carry histocompatibility antigens on
their membranes, which are recognized as foreign by the cells of the immune
system. These histocompatibility antigens are found on proteins that are
encoded by the Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) which, in humans,
is also known as the Human Leukocyte Antigen (HLA) complex (Chapter 4).
The MHC complex is a genetic region that encodes several classes of proteins,
some of which are membrane proteins. Class I MHC proteins (MHC I) are found
on the membranes of all nucleated cells and are involved in the recognition
of virus-infected cells by the precursors of cytotoxic T lymphocytes (TC cells).
Class II MHC proteins (MHC II) are found on the membranes of antigen
presenting cells such as macrophages and are involved in the recognition by
TH lymphocytes of foreign proteins on the surface of antigen presenting cells.
It is relatively minor differences between the amino acid sequences of the
MHC molecules of the donor and of the recipient that lead to the rejection of
the transplanted tissue.
The rejection of an allograft usually takes place a few weeks after the transplant unless immunosuppressive treatments are given. Small lymphocytes
recognize the transplanted cells as foreign. An acute rejection is caused by
T lymphocytes that infiltrate the graft. The presence of T lymphocytes and
monocytes in the infiltrate is a strong indicator of cell-mediated immunity.
Both TH and TC cells are involved in graft rejection. The TC cells develop into
cytotoxic T lymphocytes directed against the foreign histocompatibility antigens of the grafted cells and are able to destroy cells of the grafts directly, or
indirectly by producing cytokines that attract monocytes and macrophages.
The TH lymphocytes respond by producing cytokines that activate a variety of
nonspecific cells to attack the graft.

THE HLA SYSTEM

Sometimes rejection may take place within hours or minutes of transplantation, once the tissue has become revascularized. This is known as hyperacute rejection and is due to antibodies against graft antigens being already
present in the plasma of the recipient. These antibodies bind to the graft
cells and activate complement leading to the rapid destruction of donor
cells. Hyperacute rejection can also be brought about if the recipient already
has antibody to MHC antigens present on the graft. These antibodies may
be present for a number of reasons. For example, women who have had a
number of pregnancies often have antibodies to the MHC antigens on the
fetus, which were inherited from the father. Secondly, patients who have had
a number of blood transfusions may become immunized to the MHC antigens on residual leukocytes present in the transfusion. Thirdly, patients who
have had a previous transplant and rejected it will almost certainly have antibodies to any foreign MHC antigens that were present on that graft. Finally,
antibodies to blood group antigens can also cause hyperacute rejection if
they are already present in the recipient. For example, the blood group A, B
and H antigens are present on the endothelial cells lining blood vessels. If a
recipient of blood group A is given a transplant, for example a kidney from a
person of blood group B, the anti-B antibodies in the plasma of the recipient
will attack the endothelial cells of the graft and activate complement causing destruction of the graft. For this reason, transplants are no longer carried
out against a major blood group barrier. Given that pre-existing antibodies
can cause a rapid rejection of a graft it is essential to know which potential
recipients have such antibodies. Hence, a cross match is performed in which
serum from the recipient is incubated with cells from the donor. If the donor
cells are killed in the presence of recipient serum and complement, the transplant will not be undertaken and another potential recipient will be sought.
A chronic rejection takes place months or years after transplantation and is
brought about by a combination of cell-mediated and humoral mechanisms.

6.12 THE HLA SYSTEM
The HLA system of genes is found on the short arm of chromosome 6. This
region encodes MHC proteins. The structures of MHC I and II were discussed
in Chapter 4 in the context of their roles in the immune response. Here their
involvement in triggering rejection will be emphasized. Molecules of MHC I
consist of a single polypeptide encoded by the MHC that is always associated
with a smaller protein, B2M, encoded outside the MHC. However, MHC II proteins consist of two polypeptides, A and B, both of which are encoded by the
MHC region.
Figure 6.14 illustrates the structure of the HLA-region although it has been
greatly simplified to aid understanding. The HLA complex contains a number
of genetic loci, including those that encode different types of Class I proteins.
Thus, the HLA-A, B and C regions contain genes that encode HLA-A, B and C
proteins respectively. These are all found on nucleated cells and are distinct
types of proteins and not allelic forms of each other. However, there are allelic
forms of each of the HLA-A, B and C genes, and these encode HLA proteins,
each of which have small differences in their amino acid sequences. Each of
the Class I genes is polyallelic, which means that many different alleles exist
although, of course, each individual only expresses a maximum of two alleles
at each locus, given chromosomes occur in pairs (Chapter 15). Moreover, the
alleles are codominant so that each nucleated cell expresses two different alleles of the HLA-A gene, as well as two different forms of the HLA-B and of the
HLA-C gene. A large number of allelic forms of each gene exist (Table 6.13).
The HLA complex in humans is one of the most highly polymorphic systems
known. Given that each individual has two of each of these alleles, and that the
allelic forms are codominant, it can be seen that the chances of two unrelated

individuals having the same ‚Äòset‚Äô of HLA genes is very small, making the possibility of finding ‚Äògood‚Äô transplant matches, other than identical twins, low.
In the HLA complex, the Class II region is located nearest to the centromere,
which contains the DP, DQ and DR loci. Within each of these loci there are
genes encoding the @ and A chains of the class II molecules. The situation is
rather more complex than for Class I because each locus may contain more
than one gene that encodes the @ and A chains. For example, the HLA-DR
region contains three or four genes for the HLA-A chain. All of the A gene
products may be expressed in a single cell, making the degree of variation
much higher than that of class I proteins. Like Class I, the Class II region also
displays a high degree of polymorphism (Table 6.14).

HLA TYPING
Human Leukocyte Antigen typing is the process whereby the HLA antigens
present on the cells of the recipient and the potential donor are determined.
By determining the HLA types of potential transplant recipients, and storing
these details on computer databases it is possible to match the donor organ,
when one becomes available, to the most appropriate recipient. The degree

of match required depends on the organ being transplanted, and is much
more stringent for bone marrow transplants than for solid organ transplants.
The transplantation of bone marrow is used to treat a number of conditions, including immunodeficiency and some kinds of cancer (Chapter 17).
Transplantation of bone marrow presents particular difficulties because bone
marrow contains immunocompetent cells that can lead to fatal GVHD.
The traditional method for HLA typing is a serological technique that uses
antibodies to known HLA antigens. This method is still used but is being
superseded by molecular biological techniques. The serological method is
the lymphocytotoxicity assay. In this assay, the cells to be typed are peripheral
blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) that are readily obtained from whole blood.
For typing Class II HLA antigens it is necessary to use purified B lymphocytes,
since resting T lymphocytes do not express Class II molecules. Aliquots of the
cells to be typed are pipetted into the wells of 96-well trays, known as Teresaki
plates, after the inventor of this test. Antibodies to individual HLA antigens
are added to each well and will bind to the lymphocytes if they express the
appropriate antigen. The addition of complement to all the wells results in
the death of cells with bound antibody. Viability stains, such as the fluorescent acridine orange and ethidium bromide are then used to reveal wells
containing dead cells. Acridine orange enters living cells and stains the nuclei
green, while ethidium bromide enters dead cells and stains the nuclei red
(Figure 6.15). The anti-HLA antibodies used in these tests may be obtained
from people already sensitized to HLA antigens or they may be monoclonal
antibodies with specificities for known HLA antigens. Rabbit serum is used
as a source of complement. A test is scored as strongly positive when more
than 50% of the cells in a well are killed.

Molecular biology techniques
The main molecular biological technique used in histocompatibility testing
is the polymerase chain reaction (PCR; Chapter 3) in which samples of DNA
from the individual being typed is amplified many times over. Methods that
use PCR require very little DNA and do not require living cells. For example,
they can be carried out on whole blood that has been stored frozen. In the
sequence specific primer (SSP) assay the primers used in the PCR are those
specific for individual HLA alleles. The DNA will only be amplified in those
mixtures that contain a probe complementary to that of the DNA being typed
(Figure 6.16). Another method, called a sequence specific oligonucleotide
probe (SSOP) assay, amplifies all the DNA by PCR and then uses sequence
specific oligonucleotide probes to identify the products. In some laboratories
the oligonucleotide probes are attached to microspheres. Incubation of the
microspheres with the PCR product allows the latter to bind to any complementary HLA sequence. The microspheres, with bound DNA, are then analyzed in a flow cytometer to identify target HLA sequences.

it is probable that the recipient already has antibodies against graft antigens
and the donor is unlikely to be a suitable match.

Matching donor and recipient
Individuals inherit a set of HLA genes from each parent. Thus, siblings are
more likely to have a closer match than unrelated donors and, occasionally,
people have donated a healthy kidney to a sibling with renal failure. Other
sources of kidneys for transplantation include cadavers, often people who
have been killed in accidents. The HLA types of potential recipients are stored
in computer databases so that when a kidney donor becomes available, they
can be HLA typed and the kidneys given to those recipients whose HLA antigens match as closely as possible.
Retrospective studies on the outcome of kidney transplantation have shown
that matching the donor to the recipient improves graft survival. Thus, in
the most favorable match, that is no mismatches of the HLA-DR, HLA-A and
HLA-B alleles graft survival is superior to those with no mismatch of HLADR and only one mismatch of HLA-A and/or HLA-B alleles. These also gave
significantly better graft survival than any other mismatched graft.

6.13 IMMUNOSUPPRESSION
All patients who receive an allograft are liable to reject the transplant, even
if the recipient and host are closely matched for histocompatibility antigens.
This is because relatively few of the HLA antigens are tested for, and complete
matches are rare. Thus, all patients who receive an allograft have to take immunosuppressive drugs to prevent rejection resulting from an immune response.
Immunosuppressive treatments fall into a number of categories. The first generation of immunosuppressive drugs were used to prevent lymphocytes from
proliferating (Table 6.15). As these drugs act by inhibiting cell division, they
are also used in the treatment of cancer. Their actions are described in more
detail in Chapter 17. Corticosteroids, such as cortisol, are also immunosuppressive agents but act principally by suppressing inflammation. They are still
used, often in combination with other drugs such as methotrexate. All the first
generation drugs produce a ‚Äòblanket‚Äô immunosuppression and prevent all
immune responses. This makes the patient more susceptible to infections of
all kinds, but especially to opportunistic infections caused by such organisms
as Candida albicans. Immunosuppressed patients are also more susceptible
to the types of cancers associated with viruses, including lymphoma, associated with the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) and Kaposi‚Äôs sarcoma, associated with
the Kaposi‚Äôs sarcoma associated herpes virus (KSV). First generation immunosuppressive treatments also have significant toxicity, because they affect all
dividing cells, including those of the bone marrow and of the GIT. Some, such
as methotrexate, also show liver toxicity.

The second generation of immunosuppressive treatments target T lymphocytes rather than B cells. These included the use of antilymphocyte
globulin, an antibody raised against human T lymphocytes. The third generation of immunosuppressive treatments are much more selective in their
action and target only those T cells which have been activated by an antigen.
Cyclosporin A, a cyclic peptide (Figure 6.17) derived from the soil fungus
Tolypocladium inflatum gams, is most commonly used. The peptide shows
considerable immunosuppressive action, without the bone marrow toxicity demonstrated by other drugs. Tacrolimus, a macrolide antibiotic (Figure
6.18) derived from Streptomyces tsukubaensis, is similar to cyclosporin A in
action. It is more powerful than cyclosporin A but also has more side effects.
Mycophenolate mofetil is an example of a prodrug, which is converted in the
body to mycophenolic acid, another powerful immunosuppressive agent.

TRANSFUSION AND TRANSPLANTATION

6.14 HEMOPOIETIC STEM CELL TRANSPLANTATION
The transplantation of hemopoietic stem cells is used to correct some immunodeficiency diseases (Chapter 5) and during the treatment for some types of
cancer, such as leukemias and lymphomas (Chapter 17). Patients with total
bone marrow failure, such as in aplastic anemia, or partial failure, as seen in
some of the hemoglobinopathies, may also benefit from a stem cell transplant
(SCT).
Hemopoietic stem cells for transplantation may be derived from bone marrow, from peripheral blood, and from umbilical cord blood and SCTs may be
autologous, syngeneic or allogeneic. In an autologous transplant the patient‚Äôs
own stem cells are harvested prior to a treatment in which their own stem
cells are destroyed, as, for example, in patients who receive radiation treatment or high dose chemotherapy to treat leukemia. The stem cells are stored
in liquid nitrogen until the transplant can take place, when they are thawed
and reinfused.

Margin Note 6.4 Bone marrow
databases

i

Potential bone marrow donors are
always required to increase the
number of HLA types available. The
National Marrow Donor Program in
the USA maintains an international
registry of stem cell donors. Similarly,
in the UK the two main bone marrow
registries are the British Bone Marrow
registry and the Anthony Nolan Bone
Marrow registry.

A SCT between identical twins is called a syngeneic transplant. In contrast, an
allogeneic SCT involves donors and recipients who are genetically nonidentical. The donor could be a sibling or a potential donor identified in a bone marrow registry (Margin Note 6.4). Donors who are related to the recipient are more
likely to be compatible. There is a much greater need for close HLA matching
of the donor and recipient involved in bone marrow transplants (BMTs), as
GVHD can be a major hazard of this type of transplantation and can occur
between seven and 30 days post-transplantation. In the acute form of GVHD
epithelial cells in the skin and those lining the intestine are attacked by the sensitized T cells originating in the graft. Patients present with a severe maculopapular skin rash and sloughing of the intestinal epithelium may lead to diarrhea.
Splenomegaly and hepatomegaly occur, as these organs become attacked by
T lymphocytes and the patient may become jaundiced. Acute GVHD is frequently fatal. A chronic form with similar symptoms may occur over a longer
time frame. The patients may suffer frequent secondary infections.
One method of avoiding GVHD is to remove T lymphocytes from SCTs prior
to giving the graft. This process, known as T cell depletion involves the use of
an antibody to T cells. Once GVHD develops it must be treated with immunosuppressive drugs.

BONE MARROW TRANSPLANTATION
The first successful bone marrow transplant (BMT) was achieved in 1968.
Bone marrow contains the hemopoietic stem cells that give rise to all the
formed elements of the blood (Chapter 13). In bone marrow transplantation
(BMT), the donor receives a general or local anesthetic and the marrow is
harvested using a needle inserted through the skin over the pelvic bone and
into the bone cavity. The process takes approximately one hour to harvest sufficient quantity; usually a minimum of 3 q 108 nucleated bone marrow cells
containing approximately 2 q 106 stem cells per kilogram of recipient body
weight is required. At this stage the marrow may be infused into the recipient
or it may require further processing. The marrow is treated to remove blood
and plasma, especially if there is a disparity between the ABO blood group of
the donor and the recipient. Fragments of bone are removed and the marrow may also be depleted of T cells to reduce the risk of GVHD prior to intravenous transfusion into the recipient. The recipient may be given antibiotics
because, until the marrow is engrafted and starts to produce blood cells, the
patient is at risk of infection. They may also be given platelet and erythrocyte
transfusions to prevent bleeding and anemia. A patient receiving a bone marrow transplant may show adverse side effects, such as nausea, fatigue, hair
loss and loss of appetite.

HEMOPOIETIC STEM CELL TRANSPLANTATION

PERIPHERAL BLOOD STEM CELL TRANSPLANTATION
Peripheral blood stem cell transplantation (PBSCT) is the most common form
of SCT. Collection of stem cells from peripheral blood is easier both for the
collector and the donor. In addition, engraftment of PBSCT is often more
rapid than with bone marrow. The donor is treated with granulocyte colony
stimulating factor (G-CSF) to increase the number of stem cells in the blood.
The stem cells are then obtained from the donor by leukapheresis (Margin
Note 6.3). Leukapheresis may take several hours to complete and more than
one session may be needed, with stem cells being stored frozen between
donations.

UMBILICAL CORD STEM CELL TRANSPLANTATION
Stem cells may also be obtained from umbilical cord blood, of course with
the permission of the family involved. Following birth, blood derived from the
baby is obtained from the umbilical cord and the placenta. Since only a small
amount of blood is retrieved in this way, the collected stem cells are typically
used to treat children.

IDENTIFICATION OF HEMOPOIETIC STEM CELLS
Hemopoietic stem cells have a marker protein called CD34 that may be used
in their identification. Thus, the numbers of CD34 positive cells in a preparation can be assessed if a sample is stained with a fluorescent antibody to
CD34. The cells can be estimated either by using a fluorescence microscope
or by flow cytometry (Box 6.1 and Figure 6.19). Both peripheral and cord blood
may be further processed to obtain the stem cells. For example, an anti-CD34
antibody linked to magnetic particles will bind to CD34+ cells, which can then
be purified using a magnet.

Storage of transplant material
Harvested stem cells may be stored for 2‚Äì3 days in a refrigerator at 4oC. This
may be required, for example, if more than one harvesting procedure is needed
or if a patient has to undergo radiation or chemotherapy for cancer treatment
(Chapter 17) prior to receiving the graft. If longer term storage is required, the
stem cells may be stored in liquid nitrogen vapour at ‚Äì176oC. Prior to storage,
the cryopreservative dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) is added to prevent ice crystal formation, which would destroy the cells. A programmed freezer allows
the cells to be cooled at the optimum rate for cell survival, which is normally
approximately 1oC per min.

Post-transplant support
Patients who have just undergone BMT or PBSCT transplantation are highly
susceptible to infections. If transfusions of blood products are required, for
example for anemia, these products should be free of CMV, a virus which is
a latent infection in some individuals. In an immunosuppressed individual,
CMV can cause serious illness.

6.15 SUMMARY
Transfusion of blood and blood products is a routine and safe clinical procedure, which rarely causes harm. Transfusion has been greatly facilitated by
knowledge of the range of blood group antigens and the conditions under
which antibodies to blood group antigens can cause problems. The screening of donors, for example for HIV or hepatitis viruses, has also increased the
safety of the procedure. The transfusion of incompatible blood can cause the
death of a recipient but this is a rare occurrence. Transfusion laboratories
are involved in ensuring that compatible blood is given to patients and that
all aspects of this procedure are safe. In addition, laboratories monitor the

presence of antibodies in pregnant women that might cause problems for a

Transplantation of solid tissue has progressed considerably since the first
successful kidney transplant and a wide range of tissues and organs are now
transplanted routinely. The rejection of transplants is minimized by a careful
matching of donor and recipient and by the administration of immunosuppressive drugs. Bone marrow and other forms of stem cell transplant carry the
risk of GVHD, although this is decreased if good HLA matches are achieved
and if the patients are carefully monitored post-transplant.

7.1

INTRODUCTION

The endocrine system is one of two major control systems in the body, the
other being the nervous system, that help control the activities of the body. It
consists of a number of ductless glands (Figure 7.1) that produce hormones.
Hormones are molecules that circulate in the blood and excite or inhibit the
metabolic activity of target tissues or organs. These responses maintain and
regulate body functions, such as growth and development, responses to stress
and injury, reproduction, homeostasis and energy metabolism (Figure 7.2).
Hormones can be divided into three chemical groups: amines, peptides and
proteins, and steroids (Table 7.1). Many amine hormones, such as adrenaline
(epinephrine) and those produced by the thyroid gland, are derivatives of
tyrosine. The majority of hormones are peptides and proteins, examples being
insulin and growth hormone. A number of protein hormones, for example
thyroid stimulating hormone, are glycoproteins in that they have carbohydrate
groups covalently attached to them. All steroid hormones are derivatives of
cholesterol and include cortisol and testosterone. Figure 7.3 shows examples
of each type of hormones.

HORMONE PRODUCTION

Amine hormones include adrenaline, noradrenaline (also called epinephrine
and norepinephrine respectively) and thyroid hormones. Their synthesis
involves a series of enzyme-catalyzed reactions in the cytoplasm of
endocrine cells. For example, thyroid hormones (Section 7.7) are synthesized
by iodination of tyrosine residues in the protein thyroglobulin found in
the thyroid. Most peptide hormones are synthesized as large inactive
prohormones, which are subsequently cleaved by enzymes to produce the
active hormone. Sometimes a number of hormones may be derived from
the same prohormone. Steroid hormones are synthesized by a sequence of
enzymatic reactions using cholesterol as a common precursor. The enzymes
responsible for conversion of cholesterol to hormone are located in the
smooth endoplasmic reticulum and mitochondria of cells. The presence
or absence of particular enzymes determines the type of steroid hormone
synthesized by that specific cell.
Amine hormones, such as adrenaline and noradrenaline, are stored in
secretory granules within the cytoplasm, but thyroid hormones are stored
within the thyroid follicles as components of thyroglobulin. Peptide hormones
are usually stored in membrane-bound vesicles within the cytoplasm of the
endocrine cell. Steroid hormones are not usually stored but are released upon
synthesis. However, lipid droplets may be found in the cytoplasm containing
precursor material for these hormones.
Hormones are released in response to nervous, hormonal or metabolic stimuli.
Hormones stored in granules are released when the granules move and fuse
with the plasma membrane. Some hormones, for example thyroxine, are
released continuously whereas others show diurnal variation and their release
varies during the day. For example, cortisol shows diurnal variation with levels
being high in the morning but low at night. The concentrations of hormones
in the plasma must be kept within narrow ranges for optimum function. A

DISORDERS OF THE ENDOCRINE SYSTEM

BOX 7.1 The pineal gland
The pineal gland or body is an appendage of the posterior end
of the roof of the third ventricle in the brain (Figure 7.4). It is
shaped like a pinecone, hence its name, weighs 100 to 150
mg and is only 8 to 10 mm long. It is composed largely of
pinealocytes and glial cells. In older animals, the pineal often
contains calcium deposits, sometimes referred to as brain sand!
Descartes (1596‚Äì1650) regarded the pineal gland as ‚Äòthe seat
of the soul‚Äô, because he believed it was unique in the human
brain in being the only structure not duplicated on the right and
left sides. This observation is not strictly true, however, since it is
Ô¨Ånely divided into two hemispheres that can be observed with
a microscope.

7‚Äì150 fold during peak production. In daylight the activity of
NAT, and therefore melatonin production, is reduced. The rhythm
is endogenously synchronized to 24 h by the suprachiasmatic
nucleus of the hypothalamus, an area of the brain known to
coordinate biological clock signals, but can be entrained to values
between 23 and 27 h primarily by the environmental light‚Äìdark
cycle acting through the retina. When the retina is exposed
to light, nervous impulses are relayed to the suprachiasmatic
nucleus. Nerve Ô¨Åbers from the hypothalamus descend to the
spinal cord, from where postganglionic Ô¨Åbers ascend back to
the pineal gland. Thus the pineal gland can measure day length
and adjust its secretion of melatonin appropriately.

The physiological function of the pineal gland in humans is
poorly understood. However, pinealocytes are known to produce
the hormone, melatonin (5-methoxy-N-acetyltryptamine), from
tryptophan by acetylating serotonin (Figure 7.5). Melatonin has
a relatively simple structure yet communicates information about
environmental lighting to physiological systems of the body. This
light-transducing ability has led some to call the pineal gland
the ‚Äòthird eye‚Äô. Melatonin, therefore, helps regulate the internal
‚Äòclock‚Äô of the body affecting biological rhythms and, in particular,
patterns of sleeping and waking and possibly the onset of
puberty. It may also function as a free radical scavenger and
reduce oxidative damage. Most melatonin is synthesized during
the night and can be secreted directly into the blood because the
capillaries of the pineal gland are permeable and do not form
part of the normal blood‚Äìbrain barrier (Figure 3.4). In a normal
environment in healthy humans the release of melatonin usually
starts at 21.00 to 22.00 h and ends between 07.00 to 09.00 h,
with peak levels of 60 to 70 pg cm‚Äì3 occurring in the plasma of
adults between 02.00 and 04.00 h. The activity of the usual ratelimiting enzyme, serotonin-N-acetyltransferase (NAT), increases

Small cysts are commonly seen within the pineal region
although their discovery is frequently incidental to radiographic
investigations. However, they are benign and nonprogressive and
should be treated conservatively. The pineal gland is also subject
to numerous types of malignant tumors, for example teratomas,
germinomas, choriocarcinomas, endodermal sinus tumors,
mixed germ cell tumors, pineoblastoma and pineocytoma,
and gliomas. Fortunately, all are rare and collectively account
for less than 1% of intracranial space-occupying lesions. With
the exception of parenchymal cell tumors, pineoblastoma and
pineocytoma, they occur mainly in patients below the age of 20
years. Germinomas and teratomas occur predominantly in males.
The commonest symptoms are secondary to hydrocephalus,
such as headaches, vomiting, and drowsiness, with visual
problems, diabetes insipidus, and reproductive abnormalities. In
children, pineal tumors of the region are often associated with
abnormal pubertal development. Some evidence suggests that
precocious puberty is due to the production of human chorionic
gonadotrophin (hCG) by germ cell tumors of the pineal gland.
Delayed puberty has also been associated with pineal tumors.

Pineal tumors can be diagnosed from the symptoms, physical
examination and tests for tumor markers in samples of
cerebrospinal Ô¨Çuid (CSF), such as A fetoprotein and hCG,
together with CSF cytology. Computer aided tomography (CAT)
or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) (Chapter 18) can aid in
differential diagnosis. Germinomas respond well to radiation
therapy, whereas surgery is usually the choice for other types.
There have been signiÔ¨Åcant improvements in prognosis, with
62% surviving germinomas for over Ô¨Åve years, although survival
is only 14% for other malignant tumors.

Given that melatonin affects normal sleep patterns, there is interest
in using it, possibly combined with phototherapy, to treat sleep
disorders. Phototherapy, more properly called full spectrum bright
light therapy, is a repeated exposure to 3 to 6 h of artiÔ¨Åcial light
that is as bright as sunlight. The use of melatonin in shift workers,
who often Ô¨Ånd it difÔ¨Åcult to adjust to working at night and sleeping
during the day, unfortunately has not shown promise. Melatonin
therapy does not appear to help their condition and appears not
to be as effective as phototherapy. However, melatonin therapy
appears to be modestly beneÔ¨Åcial in elderly insomniacs who have
lower concentrations compared with matched noninsomniacs.
Jet lag also involves the disruption of circadian rhythms where
melatonin therapy seems to be of use. During long distance air
travel, taking melatonin close to the bedtime of the destination
appears to reduce the symptoms associated with jet lag. The
greatest beneÔ¨Åts occur when jet lag would be expected to be
greatest, that is, on journeys that cross many time zones.

The production and secretion of melatonin is related to the
length of the night: the longer the night, the more produced
over a longer secretion time. Also, melatonin proÔ¨Åles show a
seasonal phase, with an earlier secretion in summer than in
winter. The condition seasonally affective disorder (SAD) or
winter depression is characterized by changes of moods and
eating and sleeping patterns. It appears to develop in people
living at high latitudes in winter when sunlight is lacking. The
increased release of melatonin in winter has been suggested as
a possible cause of SAD but at present there is no consensus
as to its causes. The assumption that melatonin duration is a
seasonal signal in humans led to the treatment of SAD with
bright light in an attempt to induce advancement of the
melatonin rhythm. It appears to be somewhat more efÔ¨Åcient
when given in the morning, although there is a large placebo
effect. However, other mechanisms are also possible; indeed,
many pharmacological antidepressant treatments stimulate
melatonin secretion.

DISORDERS OF THE ENDOCRINE SYSTEM

number of factors control hormone production by the endocrine glands. The
secretion of pituitary hormones is under the influence of peptides released
from the hypothalamus and, this in turn, is influenced by signals from the
central nervous system (CNS). Most hormones released from endocrine glands
are controlled by a negative feedback effect, such as for thyroid hormones
(Section 7.7) and cortisol (Section 7.9). Finally, changes in the amounts of
materials regulated by hormones themselves may influence the release of that
hormone, as is the case for insulin. Target cells and the liver contain enzymes
that degrade hormones. Hormones of low Mr are removed from the circulation
by the kidneys and excreted in urine.
The half-lives of hormones vary from a few seconds to weeks. Many small
or water insoluble hormones form complexes with large plasma transport
proteins. The kidneys cannot filter out these large complexes and so their
rapid loss is prevented. In addition, these complexes protect the hormone
from degradation by enzymes and release the hormone slowly. The bound
and free hormones are in equilibrium and it is only the free fraction that is
biologically active.

7.3

MECHANISMS OF HORMONAL ACTION

Hormones act by binding to specific receptors of target cells to form a
complex (Figure 7.6) that elicits a cellular response. Only the target tissue
will express the receptor for a given hormone and be able to respond to it.
Hormone receptors may be located on the surface of the cell or within the
cell respectively. Hormones that bind to the former function through what
are called second messenger systems, the hormone being the primary or first
messenger. Second messengers are small Mr water-soluble molecules and ions
that are generally able to move freely throughout the cell. The most common
secondary messengers are cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP), the
structurally related cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP), Ca2+, inositol
triphosphate (IP3), and diacylglycerol (DAG) whose structures are shown in
Figure 7.7.
Extracellular receptors are transmembrane proteins that have an extracellular
and an intracellular portion joined by a transmembrane domain. Binding of
the hormone to the extracellular portion changes the conformation or shape
of the complex, such that the intracellular part can catalyze changes to the
concentration of the second messenger in the cytosol and amplify the initial
signal, that is the binding of the hormone, to produce marked changes in the
activities of existing proteins in the target cell.
Amine and peptide and protein hormones are water soluble and cannot easily
cross the lipid layer of the plasma membrane. These hormones bind to surface
receptors on the plasma membrane (Figure 7.8). G-protein-coupled receptors
are the most common cell surface receptors and binding to these results
in the activation of adenylate kinase, through a number of proteins whose
conformations are changed in turn. Activated adenylate kinase catalyzes the
conversion of ATP to the secondary messenger cAMP, whose concentration in
the cytoplasm therefore increases.

Cyclic AMP, in turn, stimulates protein kinase which then catalyzes the
phosphorylation of specific enzymes in the cytosol. Depending on the
enzyme, phosphorylation can cause an increase or decrease in activity. A
phosphodiesterase inactivates cAMP by hydrolyzing it to AMP and prevents
its accumulation in the cytoplasm.
Hormones that recognize intracellular receptors function in an entirely
different fashion. Such hormones are able directly to enter the cell where

G proteins are so called because
they bind the guanyl nucleotides,

they regulate the synthesis of proteins. For example, steroid hormones are
hydrophobic and lipid soluble and so diffuse directly through the plasma
membrane into the cytoplasm of target cells. Thyroid hormones enter their
target cells by facilitated diffusion. In the cytoplasm, steroid and thyroid
hormones bind to intracellular receptors forming hormone‚Äìreceptor
complexes (Figure 7.10). The complex then interacts with the DNA of specific
genes in the nucleus to switch their transcription on or off, allowing or
preventing the production of appropriate mRNA molecules respectively. Thus
the cell‚Äôs production of proteins, such as enzymes, is regulated to produce a
physiological response to the hormone.

7.4

CAUSES OF ENDOCRINE DISORDERS

Endocrine disorders arise because a disruption to the endocrine system
causes decreased (hypofunction) or increased (hyperfunction) hormonal
activity or resistance to hormone action. There may be defects in synthesis
of the hormone due to an inherited deficiency of an enzyme required for
its synthesis. Inappropriate stimuli may impair the release of the hormone
or certain drugs may stimulate hormone release. Defects in the negative
feedback mechanism may cause abnormal hormone secretion. Faulty
inactivation or excretion of hormones in liver or renal diseases respectively
can increase hormone levels. Excessive hormone secretion can occur
ectopically from a nonendocrine source, such as a tumor. Even if correctly
synthesized and released, the target tissues may not recognize the hormone
because of a lack of receptors or because the receptors themselves are
nonfunctional. Disorders will also occur if the target cells do recognize the
hormone but there is a defect in the secondary messenger system responsible
for converting the hormonal signal to a physiological action.
In some autoimmune diseases (Chapter 5), antibodies are produced that
stimulate or destroy endocrine glands, as in Grave‚Äôs disease and autoimmune
thyroiditis respectively. The various causes underlying endocrine disorders
are summarized in Figure 7.11. A considerable number of endocrine disorders
have been described including disorders associated with the pituitary, thyroid,
pancreas, adrenal glands and the reproductive systems.

THE PITUITARY GLAND

The pituitary gland is often referred to as ‚Äòthe master gland‚Äô given that its
secretions regulate the activities of many of the other hormone-producing
glands. Despite its crucial role, it weighs only about 0.5 g. The pituitary is found
in a bony cavity at the base of the skull and is connected to the hypothalamus
by a pituitary stalk composed of blood vessels and nerve fibers. It is composed
of two lobes, an anterior pituitary or adenohypophysis and a posterior pituitary
or neurohypophysis (Figure 7.12).
The anterior pituitary secretes a number of hormones (Figure 7.13) that are
regulated by the release of peptides from the hypothalamus with stimulatory or
inhibitory effects on the anterior pituitary. The principal peptides released by
the hypothalamus reach the anterior pituitary by a portal blood circulation.
These peptides include thyrotrophin releasing hormone (TRH), growth
hormone releasing hormone (GHRH), gonadotrophin releasing hormone
(GnRH), corticotrophin releasing hormone (CRH) and dopamine. With
the exception of dopamine, all are stimulatory, controlling the release
of thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH), growth hormone (GH), follicle
stimulating hormone (FSH) together with luteinizing hormone (LH) and
adrenocorticotrophic hormone (ACTH) respectively. Thyroid stimulating
hormone targets the thyroid gland causing it to release thyroid hormones.

Growth hormone acts on general body tissues to promote growth and
development. Follicle stimulating hormone and LH, collectively referred
to as gonadotrophins, act on the testes and ovaries and are essential for
reproduction. Adrenocorticotrophic hormone acts on the adrenal cortex and
stimulates release of cortisol. Prolactin stimulates the female mammary glands
to control lactation. The release of prolactin is inhibited by dopamine.
The posterior pituitary is composed of a collection of nerve fibers originating
in the hypothalamus. It secretes two main hormones, antidiuretic hormone
(ADH) or vasopressin, and oxytocin although both are made in the
hypothalamus and reach the posterior pituitary in the nerve fibers of the stalk.
The former stimulates the kidneys to conserve water (Chapter 8), whereas the
latter promotes uterine contractions during childbirth and stimulates the
release of milk in breast feeding.

DISORDERS OF PITUITARY FUNCTION
The majority of disorders in pituitary function are caused by tumors of the
gland although some pituitary diseases can lead to underproduction of its
hormones. Approximately 80% of pituitary tumors are functional, that is
they cause an excessive secretion of hormones. The most common secrete
prolactin, and account for 50% of functional tumors. The incidence of

DISORDERS OF THE ENDOCRINE SYSTEM

tumors affecting other hormones is 15% GH, 10% ACTH, 4% FSH/LH with
less than 1% promoting TSH secretion. Large pituitary tumors may also exert
pressure on nerves, causing headaches and visual disturbances. Radiological
investigations such as X-rays, computer-aided tomography (CAT) scans and
magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), outlined in Chapter 18, are important in
locating tumors and estimating their sizes.
Prolactin secreting tumors, prolactinomas, cause hyperprolactinemia that, in
turn, can lead to infertility in both males and females. Nonprolactin secreting
tumors or pituitary stalk section by surgery, which block the dopaminergic
inhibition of prolactin secretion, also result in hyperprolactinemia.
Hyperprolactinemia abolishes menstruation (amenorrhea) and causes an
inappropriate release of breast milk (galactorrhea) and impotence and breast
development (gynecomastia) in males. Other causes of hyperprolactinemia
include drugs, for example phenothiazines, that block dopamine receptors, or
methyldopa that reduces the level of dopamine in the brain.
Investigating a patient with a possible prolactinoma includes assessing the
concentrations of prolactin in the plasma (Table 7.2) following stimulation with
TRH, although this test is not commonly used in most hospitals. In addition
to TRH, prolactin is also secreted in response to stress and estrogens. Patients
with a prolactinoma have plasma prolactin concentrations in excess of 2000
mU dm‚Äì3. These high values are generally not affected by TRH stimulation in
individuals with prolactinomas. The first line of treatment is with a dopamine
antagonist, such as bromocriptine, although surgical removal of the tumor
may be necessary in cases which do not respond to drug therapy.
Disorders of oxytocin are uncommon and have little clinical significance.
However, ADH release is essential for life and disorders of its release are
well recognized. The release of ADH is stimulated by increased osmolality
of the plasma and a decrease in blood volume detected by hypothalamic
osmoreceptors and cardiac baroreceptors respectively. The role of ADH in
fluid regulation is outlined in Chapter 8. A decreased output of ADH gives rise
to diabetes insipidus, characterized by excessive production of dilute urine
(polyuria). Patients are constantly thirsty (polydipsia), have hypernatremia
and a plasma osmolality in excess of 295 mmol kg‚Äì1.

GROWTH HORMONE DISORDERS

Cranial diabetes insipidus may be caused by brain tumors, meningitis, trauma
and following surgery, but can be idiopathic. Nephrogenic diabetes insipidus
occurs when the kidneys fail to respond to ADH. The lack of response may be
caused by drugs, such as lithium, chronic renal disease, hypercalcemia or it
may be congenital. Patients with suspected diabetes insipidus are investigated
by performing a fluid deprivation test in which the patient is deprived of fluid
intake for a period of 8 h. In normal individuals, this results in concentrated
urine with a plasma osmolality below 295 mmol kg‚Äì1. However, in patients with
diabetes insipidus, the urine does not become concentrated and the plasma
osmolality increases. At the end of the 8 h period, the patient is allowed to
drink water and given desmopressin, a synthetic analog of ADH, after which
the urine is collected hourly for a further 4 h. In cranial diabetes insipidus
the urine becomes concentrated, but with nephrogenic diabetes insipidus
this does not occur as the kidneys are insensitive to ADH (or desmopressin
in this case). Hence the test discriminates between cranial and nephrogenic
diabetes insipidus.

A)

Patients suffering from diabetes insipidus require access to rehydrating
fluids but, in each case, the underlying cause must be treated. Patients with
cranial diabetes insipidus are often given desmopressin in a nasal spray or
chloropropamide which increases renal sensitivity to ADH. The use of the
latter drug requires careful monitoring since it can lead to hypoglycemia.
Individuals with nephrogenic diabetes insipidus do not respond to analogs of
ADH and often there is no suitable treatment. Especial attention to adequate
water intake is essential.
A number of patients present with hypopituitarism, which is a failure
to secrete one or more pituitary hormones, although this is a relatively
uncommon complaint. Hypopituitarism may result from a tumor, infarction,
infections, trauma affecting the pituitary or may be secondary to disorders
of the hypothalamus. The clinical presentation of hypopituitarism often
depends on the age of the affected individual. A decreased release of
GH is often an early feature, leading to dwarfism in children (Section
7.6). Inadequate secretion of gonadotrophins may cause amenorrhea
(see above) and infertility in adult females, and loss of secondary sexual
characteristics in males. Elderly patients with hypopituitarism may complain
of symptoms, such as hypoglycemia and hypothermia, relating to ACTH
and TSH deficiencies respectively. In most cases, GH and gonadotrophin
deficiencies tend to present before that of ACTH. Hyposecretion is assessed
by stimulatory tests where the ability of the anterior pituitary to secrete the
hormone in question is assessed following stimulation of the patient with
the hypothalamic peptide or its analog. A failure to respond would suggest
hypopituitarism.

GROWTH HORMONE DISORDERS
GH

Growth hormone (GH) or somatotrophin promotes linear growth and the
maintenance of tissues by stimulating the uptake of amino acids by cells,
protein synthesis, increasing blood glucose concentration and fat metabolism
and promoting epiphyseal bone growth. These effects are mediated by locally
acting effectors called somatomedins that are synthesized by many tissues
but particularly liver. Somatomedins stimulate cell proliferation and/or
differentiation. They include insulin-like growth factors-I and II (IGF-I and
IGF-II). Insulin-like growth factor-I is the most significant physiologically and,
indeed, its concentration correlates with that of GH.
Growth hormone is a polypeptide 191 amino acid residues long (Figure 7.14
(A)). Approximately 70% of plasma GH is bound to growth hormone binding
protein. Growth hormone is synthesized in the anterior pituitary gland in

DISORDERS OF THE ENDOCRINE SYSTEM

an inactive form called preprogrowth hormone that is hydrolyzed in several
enzyme-catalyzed reactions to give active GH prior to its secretion. A number
of factors, such as sleep, amino acids, exercise and stress stimulate GHRH
release from the hypothalamus and that, in turn, stimulates GH secretion.
Hyperglycemia stimulates the secretion of somatostatin from the hypothalamus and this inhibits the secretion of GH. Increasing concentrations of
serum GH and IGF-I exert a negative feedback effect that prevents further
release of GH (Figure 7.14 (B)). The rate of adult secretion varies but is
generally about 1.4 mg daily and occurs in pulses with the largest amounts
being released during sleep.
The clinical features resulting from an excess or deficiency of GH depend on
the age of the person. A deficiency during childhood leads to a stunted growth
called dwarfism (Figure 7.15 (A)) and therefore requires early detection.
However, GH deficiency is a rare cause of dwarfism and other causes, for
example thyroid deficiency or inadequate nutrition, need to be excluded first.
The commonest causes of GH deficiency are nonendocrine tumors that affect
the pituitary gland or hypothalamus. Growth hormone deficiency may also be
a consequence of generalized pituitary disease or a congenital defect leading
to a deficient production of GHRH. Whatever the cause, the major clinical
feature is stunted growth, well below that expected for a child of comparable
age, with a short height, immature face and skeleton as revealed by radiological
investigations. Clinical signs of other anterior pituitary hormone deficiencies
may be evident.
The most common cause of excessive GH release is a GH secreting pituitary
tumor or adenoma (Chapter 17). Although these are benign, they are not
subject to normal control and continually release large amounts of GH. The

causes of these tumors are unknown but a genetic basis has been suggested.
Ectopic GH secretion is extremely rare but has been reported in patients with
bronchial carcinoma.
Excessive GH release causes gigantism in children and acromegaly in adults.
Children with GH excess grow as much as 6 inches per year to abnormal
heights, often in excess of 8 feet. Muscle weakness is seen in longstanding cases.
Acromegaly has an insidious onset and may take years for its clinical features,
enlargement of bones of hands, feet and face, thickening of soft tissues causing
coarse facial features, enlarged tongue and lips, prognathism or protruding
jaw, increased sweating and enlargement of internal organs, such as liver,
spleen and heart, to become apparent. Additionally, acromegalics suffer from
paresthesia of the hands and feet due to entrapment of nerves by thickened
bone and subcutaneous tissue, headaches/vision disorders due to the growing
pituitary tumor and sensory nerve entrapment, impaired glucose tolerance
or diabetes mellitus and increased incidences of coronary heart disease and
stroke (Chapter 14). Individuals affected by excessive GH secretion throughout
life show features of both gigantism and acromegaly (Figure 7.15 (B)).
The prognosis for both gigantism and acromegaly depends on how far the
disorder has advanced. Gigantism is rarely life threatening and prognosis is
usually good. However, an individual with advanced acromegaly will develop
serious complications, such as coronary heart disease, cerebrovascular disease
and diabetes mellitus.

DIAGNOSIS AND TREATMENT OF GROWTH HORMONE DISORDERS
A variety of tests are used to assess GH deficiency. Random measurements
of serum GH are of limited value due to fluctuations in plasma GH levels in
normal individuals. Urinary GH excretion is low in deficiency but obtaining
an accurately timed collection of urine is difficult. Most tests rely on
demonstrating that the hormone does not increase in concentration following
a stimulus. Growth hormone increases after exercise and this has been used
as a preliminary screening test. In the exercise test, the patient is subjected
to hard physical exercise until they have a pulse rate greater than 150 beats
per min (Chapter 14). Blood is collected at 0, 2 and 20 min after stopping
exercise. In normal individuals, the plasma concentration of GH increases by
20 mU dm‚Äì3 above the initial value. Growth hormone release increases during
sleep, hence high values in a nocturnal sample may exclude deficiency. Blood
samples are collected using a venous catheter at 30 min intervals for 3 to 4 h
after the onset of sleep. A peak of at least 10 mU dm‚Äì3 occurs in normal
individuals but not in patients with GH deficiency. Clonidine is a potent
stimulator of GH secretion and is used in a definitive test for GH deficiency.
Growth hormone from genetically engineered sources is used in treatment
but must be continued until longitudinal growth is completed. In cases where
deficiency is due to low levels of GHRH, analogs of this peptide, for example
hexarelin, have been used.
A diagnosis of excess GH is made on clinical grounds supported by biochemical
and radiological investigations. Photographs taken of the patient when younger
are particularly useful when making a diagnosis. Basal serum concentrations
of GH are increased in GH excess but, because release is influenced by so
many factors, the result of a single sample is unreliable.
The concentration of IGF-I in serum is raised in patients with acromegaly and
is of diagnostic significance. The oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) is used
to confirm a diagnosis of acromegaly and is similar to that used for diagnosis
of diabetes mellitus (Section 7.8) except that levels of plasma GH are also
determined. In a healthy individual, the glucose load suppresses GH release
to below 2 mU dm‚Äì3 by stimulating the release of somatostatin. In patients
with acromegaly, this suppression is not seen.

DISORDERS OF THE ENDOCRINE SYSTEM

The management of GH excess cannot reverse any clinical changes that have
taken place prior to treatment. However, management is important because
it improves survival and reduces deaths due to heart disease or stroke. Growth
hormone secreting tumors are treated in one of three ways, the clinical decision
depending on severity of disease, the age of the patient and the response
to treatment. Surgical removal of the pituitary tumor may be attempted
depending on its size and location with steps taken to minimize damage to
the anterior pituitary. If GH levels do not normalize, other treatments must
be considered. Radiotherapy is usually performed over a 4‚Äì6 week period by
external irradiation using a cobalt source. Its effects are slow and, in some
cases, hyposecretion of other pituitary hormones may occur. Drugs, such as
bromocriptine, suppress GH release in acromegalics and are often used in
patients too old to undergo surgery or radiotherapy. Somatostatin analogs, for
example octeotride, have also been used to inhibit GH release. Some patients
require all three modes of treatment but are not always successfully treated. To
detect recurrence, serum IGF-I needs to be monitored at regular intervals.

THYROID HORMONE DISORDERS

The thyroid gland is the largest endocrine gland in the body, weighing about
20 g. It is a bilobular organ that consists of microscopic spherical follicles
with secretory cells (Figure 7.16) that synthesize the thyroid hormones.
Thyroid hormones (Figure 7.17 (A) and (B)) consist of triiodothyronine (T3)
and thyroxine (T4). Triiodothyronine is the most active, four times that of T4,
and has a half-life of 1.5 days compared with 9 days for T4. However in most
tissues, particular the liver, T4 can be readily converted to T3. More than 99% of
T3 and T4 are transported in the serum as complexes: 70% to thyroxine binding
globulin (TBG) and about 20% to albumin and around 10% to prealbumin.
The remaining small free portion is the metabolically active fraction.

THYROID HORMONE DISORDERS

The effects of thyroid hormones are to increase heat production, oxygen
consumption, the metabolism of proteins, fats and carbohydrates and to
promote normal growth. They are also necessary for the normal functioning
of the CNS. Levels of plasma T4 and T3 are regulated by the release of thyroid
stimulating hormone (TSH) from the anterior pituitary that, in turn, is
controlled by the release of thyrotrophin releasing hormone (TRH) from the
hypothalamus. Increasing concentrations of free T4 and T3 inhibit further
release of TSH and TRH by a negative feedback effect (Figure 7.17 (C)).
The most serious disorder of thyroid function is hyperthyroidism caused by
an excessive production of thyroid hormones. The clinical syndrome resulting
from hyperthyroidism is thyrotoxicosis (Figure 7.18). Its clinical features are
weight loss, sweating, heat intolerance, anxiety, hyperkinesis, increased
appetite, osteoporosis, menorrhagia, tachycardia and pretibial edema.
The commonest cause of hyperthyroidism is Grave‚Äôs disease, which can occur
at any age but particularly in 20- to 40-year-old females. Patients with Grave‚Äôs
disease suffer from exophthalmos or protrusion of the eyeballs, in addition to
clinical features of hyperthyroidism. It is an autoimmune disease (Chapter 5),
characterized by the presence of thyroid stimulating antibodies in the blood
that bind to TSH receptors in thyroid cells and stimulate them in a similar
manner to TSH. Toxic nodules are the second main cause of hyperthyroidism
and tend to be found in elderly patients. They may occur singly or as multiples
in a nodular goiter and are autonomous (self-governing) secretors of thyroid
hormones. An excessive intake of thyroxine in individuals who are treated for
hypothyroidism can cause hyperthyroidism. Rare causes of hyperthyroidism
include ectopic thyroid tissue and tumors that secrete TSH although the latter
are very uncommon.

DISORDERS OF THE ENDOCRINE SYSTEM

Hypothyroidism (myxodema) is most common in women of 30‚Äì60 years of
age (Figure 7.19). Its clinical features include psychosis, diminished sweating,
hypokinesis, weight gain, muscle weakness, constipation, dry, cold skin and
dry hair, ischemic heart disease, bradycardia and menstrual irregularities.
The primary cause of hypothyroidism is a defect in the secretion of thyroid
hormones by the thyroid gland. In, for example, Hashimoto‚Äôs thyroiditis, an
autoimmune disease, there is destruction of thyroid tissue by antibodies
(Chapters 4 and 5) produced against the thyroid. Hypothyroidism may
also occur after surgery (postthyroidectomy) and following treatment with
antithyroid drugs. Congenital hypothyroidism occurs because of the failure of
the thyroid gland to develop normally during embryonic growth. If untreated,
this condition results in cretinism where the child suffers from mental
retardation, muscle weakness, short stature, neurological signs and is often
dumb and mute. Hypothyroidism may also arise due to iodine deficiency in
certain parts of the world. Secondary causes of hypothyroidism are linked to
the pituitary or the hypothalamus with defective secretions of TSH and TRH
respectively.

DIAGNOSIS AND TREATMENT OF THYROID DISORDERS
Investigating thyroid abnormalities involves measurements of serum
TSH as a first line test for thyroid function. Some laboratories also include
measurement of free T4 and/or free or total T3 in their first line screen.
Sensitive assays for measurement of TSH are readily available. Thyroid
stimulating hormone levels are increased in primary hypothyroidism,
normal in euthyroid individuals (those without thyroid disease) and low or
undetectable in hyperthyroidism.

&,)

W^dad\nd[Y^hZVhZ

THYROID HORMONE DISORDERS

Total T4 and T3 measurements were once used widely in pathology laboratories
but have the disadvantage that their values are dependent on plasma TBG
levels, which can give misleading results. When TBG levels increase, for
example in pregnancy or in females receiving estrogen-containing oral
contraceptives, then total T4 and total T3 are also increased even though the
individual is not hyperthyroid. Decreases in TBG concentrations occur in
malnutrition, protein loss, severe illness and malabsorption (Chapters 10 and
11) and causes a reduction in total T4 and T3. There has been some controversy
on the validity of free thyroid hormone measurements, but most laboratories
now determine free T4 and T3, rather than the total concentration. Free T4 and
particularly free T3, are usually increased in hyperthyroidism. Free T4 is low in
hypothyroidism and is the preferred measurement for its detection because
free T3 can be normal in hypothyroidism due to an increase in its peripheral
formation from T4. In a few patients with hyperthyroidism, free T4 is within the
reference range but free T3 is increased and TSH is nearly always undetectable.
This form of hyperthyroidism is referred to as T3 toxicosis.
In any systemic illness, such as myocardial infarction, fever or liver disease,
the normal metabolism of thyroid hormones is disturbed, reducing the
concentrations of T4 and T3 in the plasma because T4 is converted to an
inactive isomer called reverse T3 or rT3 (Figure 7.20) and T3 is not replenished
from T4. Thyroid stimulating hormone levels may be normal or reduced and
concentrations of TBG, albumin and prealbumin may also decline. Patients
may have reduced T4, T3 and TSH, although there is no thyroid dysfunction.
For this reason, thyroid function tests should not be performed on sick
patients until they recover. Table 7.3 outlines the results of tests used in
thyroid disorders. The TRH test is rarely used now in the diagnosis of thyroid
disease. It is almost exclusively used in the diagnosis of patients with pituitary
disease and to assess the capacity of the pituitary to secrete TSH. The patient
is given 200 Mg of TRH intravenously and the serum TSH is measured after
0, 20 and 60 min. A normal response involves a three- to fivefold increase in
TSH above the basal level. A slow rise in TSH (where the 60-min concentration
is greater than the one at 20 min) together with low basal levels of TSH and
thyroid hormones suggests hypothalamic disease, while a lack of response is
suggestive of pituitary hypothyroidism or hyperthyroidism (Figure 7.21).

Other techniques for investigating thyroid function include administration of
isotopes, such as 99mTc-pertechnetate, and determining their distribution using
a camera that detects F radiation. This technique distinguishes between active
and inactive thyroid nodules and can distinguish between Grave‚Äôs disease,
multinodular goiter or an adenoma affecting the thyroid gland. A thyroid
biopsy involves aspirating tissue from the affected region of the thyroid using
a syringe and fine needle. The collected cells are examined microscopically
for evidence of thyroid nodules. Often thyroid disease has an autoimmune
basis and measurement of antibodies can aid diagnosis. Antiperoxidase and
antithyroglobulin antibodies are found in patients affected by Hashimoto‚Äôs
thyroiditis and often in those with Grave‚Äôs disease. However, the detection of
antibodies is not always diagnostic, as low levels of these antibodies can occur
in older people who are euthyroid.
The management of hyperthyroidism includes using antithyroid drugs, for
example, carbimazole. This is useful in young patients and acts by reducing
the production of thyroid hormones. Other forms of treatment include
radioiodine therapy with 131I, although this is normally used in older patients,
and partial or complete surgical removal of the thyroid gland (thyroidectomy).
Some patients develop hypothyroidism, often as a consequence of treatment,
and may have to be placed on thyroxine therapy. In this regard it is important
to monitor TSH levels to detect developing hypothyroidism. Management
of hypothyroidism involves replacement therapy with thyroxine, often for
life. Thyroxine is readily available, safe and inexpensive. The treatment is
monitored at regular intervals by measurement of serum concentrations of
TSH to ensure they are kept within its reference range.

REGULATION OF BLOOD GLUCOSE

7.8

REGULATION OF BLOOD GLUCOSE

Adequate concentrations of glucose in the blood are necessary for brain cells
as they cannot metabolize substances other than glucose and ketone bodies
as energy sources nor can they store or synthesize glucose. After a meal, any
released glucose is absorbed by the gastrointestinal tract (Chapter 11) enters
the bloodstream and is delivered to the peripheral tissues where it may be
metabolized to allow ATP production. Surplus glucose is converted to glycogen
and stored in the liver and skeletal muscles or converted to triacylglycerols
and stored in adipose tissue. During fasting, the liver produces glucose by
glycogenolysis or gluconeogenesis and this is used to maintain blood glucose
concentration (Figure 7.22).
The concentration of glucose in plasma is regulated by the hormones insulin
and glucagon. Insulin is synthesized as preproinsulin in the B cells of the
islets of Langerhans in the pancreas but during its secretion is enzymatically
converted to active insulin (Figures 7.3 (B) and 7.23). Insulin has a number of
functions. It inhibits glycogenolysis, gluconeogenesis, lipolysis, ketogenesis

Sanger determined the complete

demonstration that proteins have
strictly deÔ¨Åned primary structures.
With the techniques of chemistry
and molecular biology available at
that time, this was an incredible
achievement and Sanger was
awarded the 1958 Nobel Prize in
Chemistry. Nowadays, sequencing a
protein as small as insulin would be a
trivial task. The sequences of smallish
peptides are easily determined by
mass spectrometry and it is relatively
easy to determine the base sequence
of a gene (DNA) and then interpret
it in terms of the amino acid order
of the encoded protein. Indeed,
complete genome sequences of
numerous organisms, including those
of human beings and a number of
human pathogens and parasites,
are known and are widely available
in various websites. Incredibly, the
major method for sequencing DNA,
the dideoxy method, was also devised
by Sanger in 1977, when he and
coworkers published the complete
sequence of the genome of the virus,
JX174. Sanger was awarded the
Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1980 for
this work. Sanger thus belongs to

and proteolysis and stimulates glucose uptake by muscle and adipose tissues,
glycolysis, glycogenesis, protein synthesis and uptake of K+ and Pi. Glucagon
is released by the A cells of the pancreas. Its effects are antagonistic to those
of insulin. An increase in blood glucose stimulates the pancreas to produce
insulin which, in turn, promotes the uptake and utilization of glucose by cells
lowering its concentration. A reduction in blood glucose stimulates release of
glucagon that promotes glycogenolysis in the liver thereby increasing blood
glucose levels (Figure 7.24). Disorders of insulin release or activity can cause
an increase in blood glucose, hyperglycemia, or its reduction, hypoglycemia.

Diabetes mellitus is a syndrome characterized by hyperglycemia due to an
absolute or relative deficiency of, and/or resistance to, insulin. This is the
commonest endocrine disorder, affecting about 2% of the world‚Äôs population.
Diabetes can be primary when caused directly by malfunction of one or more
of the systems regulating blood glucose concentration, or secondary as a result
of another disease. Primary diabetes is divided into types 1 and 2. In type 1
diabetes, also known as insulin dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM), there is
a decrease or absence of insulin production. It occurs in 15% of all diabetics
and typically presents acutely during childhood or adolescence, although it
can occur at any age. Patients have marked weight loss and ketoacidosis (see
below) can occur readily. Type 1 diabetes mellitus is an autoimmune disease
(Chapter 5) and antibodies that react with B cells of the islets of Langerhans
in the pancreas have been demonstrated in over 90% of patients. It also has
a strong association with certain histocompatibility antigens such as HLADR3, DR4 and certain DQ alleles (Chapters 4 and 6). Many cases of type 1
diabetes may develop after a viral infection, such as with Coxsackie B, which
initiates an autoimmune reaction that destroys the B cells of the pancreas.
Type 2 diabetes is also known as noninsulin dependent diabetes mellitus
(NIDDM), where insulin secretion tends to be normal or even elevated. It
accounts for about 85% of all cases of diabetes, has a gradual onset and tends
to occur in middle-aged and elderly individuals. Patients are less likely to
develop ketoacidosis. The etiology of type 2 diabetes is still unclear but has a
strong association with obesity. The disease may arise because an abnormal
insulin, not recognized by its receptor, is produced, lack of insulin receptors,
the presence of defective receptors or by a defective secondary messenger
system linking the insulin receptor to the glucose transporter in the plasma
membrane. Type 2 diabetes has a strong familial incidence. For example, if
an identical twin develops type 2 diabetes there is a strong likelihood that the
other twin will become diabetic.
Secondary diabetes mellitus is uncommon and is a consequence of other
disorders that involve excess secretion of hormones antagonistic to insulin,
such as cortisol in Cushing‚Äôs syndrome and GH in acromegaly. Damage to the
pancreas following, for example, chronic pancreatitis or pancreatic surgery,
may result in secondary diabetes.
Patients with diabetes mellitus suffer from a number of symptoms, including
polydipsia, the production of large volumes of urine (polyuria), unexplained
weight loss, blurred vision, tiredness and an increased susceptibility to
infections. Diabetic patients are also susceptible to acute and chronic
complications.
Acute complications of diabetes mellitus include diabetic ketoacidosis
(DKA), hyperosmolar nonketotic (HONK) coma and hypoglycemia. Diabetic
ketoacidosis occurs most commonly in patients with uncontrolled type 1
diabetes mellitus as a result of their failure to comply with insulin therapy
or it can also be precipitated by infections, such as the common cold, when
the body responds by releasing more glucose into the bloodstream and by

reducing the action of insulin. The pathogenesis of DKA is outlined in Figure
7.25. In DKA, glucose uptake by cells decreases whereas gluconeogenesis
and glycogenolysis are both stimulated, causing severe hyperglycemia.
Increased breakdown of proteins occurs and the released amino acids enter
gluconeogenesis or are degraded to form urea. As a result of insulin deficiency,
there is a shift of both K+ and Pi from the intracellular to the extracellular
compartments causing hyperkalemia and hyperphosphatemia respectively
(Chapter 8). The insulin deficiency also stimulates lipolysis producing free fatty
acids (FFAs) and glycerol. In the liver, FFAs are converted to acetyl CoA which
is then converted to acetoacetate and finally acetone and B-hydroxybutyrate.
Acetoacetate, acetone and B-hydroxybutyrate are called ketone bodies even
though B-hydroxybutyrate is not a ketone. The liver cannot utilize ketone
bodies and they accumulate in the blood (ketonemia) and may be excreted in
the urine (ketonuria). The ketone bodies in the blood are moderately strong
acids, H+Ketone‚Äì, and react with buffers, such as NaHCO3 (Chapter 9),

decreasing the concentration of hydrogen carbonate but increasing that of
carbonic acid producing an acidosis. The carbonic acid dissociates to CO2 and
H2O and the blood PCO2 increases. Thus the lung ventilation rate increases
as the body attempts to remove the excess CO2. The ketonemia is believed to
be responsible for the abdominal pain, vomiting and acidosis associated with
DKA. Severe hyperglycemia in DKA exerts a high osmotic pressure causing
water to move out of the cells leading to cellular dehydration. Blood volume
rises and the kidneys respond with polyuria. If blood glucose levels exceed
the renal threshold, glucose is lost in the urine causing glycosuria. Eventually
an osmotic diuresis may occur with loss of water and electrolytes. The blood
volume therefore declines further (hypovolemia) reducing the glomerular

filtration rate (GFR) and causing uremia. Dehydration and hypovolemia may
stimulate the thirst center and the patient may suffer polydipsia.
Diabetic ketoacidosis is a medical emergency and is fatal in about 10% of
adults and 5% of children if untreated. Death in untreated cases of DKA is due
to poor tissue perfusion, acidosis and cardiovascular failure. The following
approaches are taken to correct the metabolic disturbance. Isotonic saline
and insulin are administered to correct the dehydration and hyperglycemia
respectively. Following administration of insulin, K+ enters the cells and
this may cause hypokalemia therefore it may be necessary to administer K+
supplements. In the past, severe cases of acidosis were treated by infusion
of hydrogen carbonate although this approach is rarely adopted nowadays.
Finally, if the DKA was precipitated by an infection, then it is necessary to
identify and treat this infection.
Patients with uncontrolled type 2 diabetes mellitus may enter a HONK coma.
This tends to occur in the elderly and develops over a period of days or even
weeks. In these patients, the levels of insulin are sufficient to prevent ketosis
but they often have severe hyperglycemia, characterized by blood glucose
concentration above 35 and often in excess of 50 mmol dm‚Äì3, together with
severe dehydration and high serum osmolality. A HONK coma is usually
precipitated by severe illness, diuretics, dehydration and glucocorticoid
therapy. Its treatment is similar to that for DKA, except that the patient is
rehydrated at a slower rate and insulin requirements are lower than those for
a patient with DKA.
The chronic complications of diabetes mellitus include retinopathy, cataract,
atherosclerosis, nephropathy and neuropathy. Diabetics with poor blood
glucose control are most susceptible to these chronic complications. It is
generally accepted that increased protein glycation and the accumulation
of tissue advanced glycation end products (Chapter 18) are involved in the
pathogenesis of chronic complications.

Diagnosis and treatment of diabetes mellitus
Investigation of diabetes is made on the basis of clinical features and
laboratory investigations. A preliminary screening test may identify the
presence of urinary glucose, although this is not diagnostic of diabetes
mellitus. A patient presenting with symptoms of diabetes mellitus must have
a venous blood specimen taken and its glucose concentration determined. A
patient is diagnosed as diabetic if the fasting plasma glucose concentration is
equal to or greater than 7.0 or the random concentration is greater than 11.1
mmol dm‚Äì3. Diabetes mellitus is excluded if the fasting or random plasma
glucose concentrations are less than 6.1 or 7.8 mmol dm‚Äì3 respectively. If
the individual under investigation lacks the typical symptoms of diabetes
then diagnosis cannot be confirmed by a single glucose determination
but reconfirmed by at least one additional positive test on another day or
investigated using the oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT). During the OGTT,
the patient is kept on a normal diet for three days prior to the test and then
fasts overnight prior to the test. A basal (fasting) venous blood sample is taken
for glucose determination before the patient drinks 75 g of anhydrous glucose
dissolved in a small volume of water. Blood specimens are collected after one
and two hours and plasma glucose determined. Plasma glucose values greater
than or equal to 7.0 mmol dm‚Äì3 for the basal sample or 11.1 mmol dm‚Äì3 for
the 2 h samples are diagnostic of diabetes mellitus. Individuals with plasma
glucose concentrations less than 7.0 for the basal sample or between 7.8 and
11.1 mmol dm‚Äì3 for the 2h samples are categorized as having impaired glucose
tolerance (IGT). This group has an increased risk of developing cardiovascular
disease (Chapter 14). Patients with plasma glucose concentrations of 6.1 to
7.0 mmol dm‚Äì3 for the basal samples or less than 7.8 mmol dm‚Äì3 for the 2 h

samples are categorized as having impaired fasting glucose (IFG) and are at
risk of developing diabetes. The values given relate to venous plasma samples
and are different from those for whole blood samples.
The management of diabetes mellitus aims to provide relief from symptoms
and reduce the chances of developing acute and chronic complications. This
includes educating the patient that diabetes is a life-long disease and affected
individuals must be responsible for their own treatment. Regular clinical and
laboratory assessment of the patient is required to ensure that treatment is
effective, to detect early signs of treatable complications so as to reduce their
progression and ensure compliance with treatment. Management involves
the dietary restriction of simple sugars and of saturated fats and cholesterol
and the use of complex carbohydrate and fibers. Dietary control is often
accompanied by use of injected insulin or oral hypoglycemic drugs, such
as sulfonylureas, in patients with type 1 and type 2 diabetes respectively.
Occasionally, it may be necessary to use insulin in patients with type 2
diabetes to control blood glucose effectively. Hypoglycemic drugs act by
increasing the sensitivity of A cells to glucose therefore stimulating insulin
release or by increasing sensitivity of target cells to insulin. Both effects will
reduce blood glucose levels. Some hypoglycemic drugs act to reduce the
absorption of glucose by the GIT or reduce glycogenolysis in the liver. Diabetic
patients on treatment are monitored regularly to ensure that blood glucose
is kept in control. Most patients measure their own blood glucose at home
regularly using kit methods based on reagent strips and a portable glucose
meter (Figure 7.26) and adjust insulin dosage according to needs, perhaps
following a change in diet, during illness or after exercise. The amount of
glycated hemoglobin (Figure 1.14) in a patient is determined regularly to
assess therapy compliance because its presence is an indicator of average
glycemia over the previous 6‚Äì8 weeks. The amount of glycated hemoglobin
tends to be less than 6% in nondiabetics but may exceed 10% in uncontrolled
diabetes. Diabetic patients with high values have poor blood glucose control
and their treatment or compliance must be reviewed.

HYPOGLYCEMIA
Hypoglycemia is defined as a blood glucose concentration less than 2.2
mmol dm‚Äì3 in a random specimen collected into a tube containing an
inhibitor of glycolysis. Hypoglycemia occurs because of an imbalance

utilization. Its clinical features are mainly due to abnormal function of the
CNS (neuroglycopenia) and can be acute or chronic. Acute features include
tiredness, confusion, hunger, dizziness, blurred vision, convulsions, coma,
anxiety, profuse sweating and tachycardia. The typical signs and symptoms
are more likely to occur if blood glucose falls rapidly: in children and young
adults the symptoms often present when the glucose concentration is less
than 2.2 whereas neonates develop symptoms only when it is less than
1.5 mmol dm‚Äì3. Acute hypoglycemia is usually associated with diabetics
who have taken too much insulin. Its chronic features include personality
changes, memory loss and dementia and are generally observed in patients
with insulin secreting tumors.
Most cases of hypoglycemia occur in patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus
because of insufficient carbohydrate, too high a dose of insulin, inappropriate
use of hypoglycemic drugs, excessive alcohol intake and strenuous exercise.
Hypoglycemia can occur during fasting if the individual has an insulin
secreting tumor or insulinoma which is a primary tumor of the B cells of the
islets of Langerhans. These tumors produce excessive amounts of insulin
or secrete insulin when it is not required. Nonpancreatic tumors, especially
carcinomas of the liver and sarcomas, may cause hypoglycemia by increasing
cellular uptake of glucose but this is unlikely to be the sole cause. Many of
these tumors secrete IGF-II which has insulin-like effects and is capable of
causing hypoglycemia.
Hypoglycemia in children is particularly dangerous because of the high risk of
permanent brain damage. Its diagnosis is especially necessary in the first few
months of life. A fetus exposed to maternal hyperglycemia will have pancreatic
islet cell hyperplasia and elevated insulin levels. Following birth, the neonate
has hyperinsulinism and may develop hypoglycemia now the high glucose
supply from the mother has been removed. In addition, these babies are larger
than average in size since insulin promotes growth.

Diagnosis and treatment of hypoglycemia
An initial assessment of a patient with frequent episodes of hypoglycemia
involves a thorough clinical evaluation with an emphasis on the patient‚Äôs drug
history, relationship of symptoms to meals, presence/history of endocrine
disease and an investigation of a possible nonpancreatic tumor. Laboratory
tests can confirm the diagnosis of hypoglycemia by demonstrating a low
blood glucose concentration. To confirm that the clinical features are due
to hypoglycemia, the patient can be given glucose by mouth or parenterally
as appropriate. Symptoms that are due to acute neuroglycopenia resolve
immediately whereas those due to chronic neuroglycopenia often persist.
Measurement of plasma insulin concentration can help in the diagnosis or
exclusion of an insulinoma. An insulinoma is likely if the patient has fasting
hypoglycemia together with high serum insulin levels that are greater than
10 mU dm‚Äì3 and raised C-peptide levels (Figure 7.23). Insulin secretion in an
insulin-treated diabetic cannot be determined for obvious reasons. However,
insulin and the C-peptide are secreted by islet cells in equimolar amounts and
therefore a measurement of C-peptide together with insulin can differentiate
between hypoglycemia due to an insulinoma, which will have a high C-peptide
concentration, from that due to exogenous insulin, which will have relatively
low amounts of C-peptide.
Hypoglycemia can be fatal and patients must be treated urgently. The aim in
comatose patients is to rapidly correct the hypoglycemia using intravenous
dextrose or intramuscular glucagon. If a patient is conscious and can swallow,
then they are given sweet drinks, sweets or glucose tablets. The underlying
cause of hypoglycemia needs to be identified and rectified; an insulinoma, for
example, requires surgical removal.

DISORDERS OF THE ADRENAL CORTEX

7.9

DISORDERS OF THE ADRENAL CORTEX

Adrenal glands each weigh about 5 g and are found on the upper surfaces
of the kidneys. They consist of an outer cortex and an inner medulla. The
cortex consists of three layers: the zona glomerulosa, zona fasciculata and
zona reticularis (Figure 7.27). The adrenal cortex is essential for life since it
produces three groups of steroid hormones. The glucocorticoids, such as
cortisol, and adrenal androgens, for example testosterone, are produced
by the zona reticularis and zona fasciculata and mineralocorticoids, such
as aldosterone, from the zona glomerulosa. Adrenal cortex cells have many
low density lipoprotein receptors on their surfaces enabling them to take up
precursor cholesterol rapidly from the plasma.
Cortisol (Figure 7.28 (A)) is released in response to adrenocorticotrophic
hormone (ACTH) from the anterior pituitary that, in turn, is controlled by
the release of corticotrophin releasing factor (CRF) from the hypothalamus.
Cortisol exerts a negative feedback effect on the anterior pituitary and
hypothalamus (Figure 7.28 (B)). The secretion of cortisol shows a diurnal
variation: highest in the morning, lowest at night. Cortisol stimulates an
increase in protein catabolism, hepatic glycogenolysis and gluconeogenesis
and a redistribution of adipose tissue but suppresses inflammation. About
90% of blood cortisol is bound to a cortisol binding globulin called transcortin
whilst the remaining 10% is free.
The major mineralocorticoid, aldosterone (Figure 7.29 (A)), is released in
response to hypotension, Na+ depletion or hyperkalemia (Chapter 8). A group
of cells in the kidneys called juxtaglomerular cells detect a fall in blood pressure
and secrete renin which circulates in the blood and catalyzes the conversion
of the plasma protein angiotensinogen to angiotensin I. A converting enzyme
in the lungs converts angiotensin I to angiotensin II that stimulates the release
of aldosterone from the adrenal cortex and ADH from the posterior pituitary
(Figure 7.29 (B)). Aldosterone stimulates the retention of Na+ in exchange
for K+ and H+ in the kidney tubules increasing the osmolality of the ECF and
the retention of water raising the blood pressure or the ECF volume back to

physiological values. Angiotensin II also stimulates thirst that helps to increase
blood pressure. The adrenal cortex secretes androgens, such as testosterone,

is the hormone that stimulates the growth and development of the male
characteristics (Section 7.10).

DISORDERS OF THE ENDOCRINE SYSTEM

Adrenal hypofunction or Addison‚Äôs disease is a rare condition but is simple
to treat once diagnosed. It can arise from one of a number of causes: an
autoimmune destruction of the adrenal cortex, as a response to tuberculosis
(TB), amyloidosis, hemochromatosis, following adrenalectomy or hypothalamic or pituitary diseases referred to as secondary adrenal insufficiency.
Addison‚Äôs disease is characterized by a deficiency of glucocorticoids and
mineralocorticoids. Its clinical features include weakness, lethargy, anorexia,
nausea, vomiting, weight loss, hypotension, skin pigmentation, hypoglycemia
and depression (Figure 7.30). In the first few months, symptoms are usually
vague with only lethargy, weakness and weight loss presenting as a result of
glucocorticoid deficiency. Later, patients start to vomit and have abdominal
pain. The lack of mineralocorticoids leads to an excessive loss of Na+ and
therefore hypotension is common in these patients. Plasma ACTH is increased
because of pituitary response to low levels of cortisol given the lack of a
negative feedback mechanism. Adrenocorticotrophic hormone can stimulate
melanocytes in skin to produce the melanin, hence pigmentation is a common
feature in Addison‚Äôs disease.

Diagnosis and treatment of Addison‚Äôs disease
A clinical suspicion of Addison‚Äôs disease can be confirmed by demonstrating
hyperkalemia with hyponatremia (Chapter 8). The plasma cortisol is usually,
but not always, low in these patients. A high concentration of ACTH coupled
with a low concentration of cortisol is indicative of Addison‚Äôs disease
whereas low cortisol and ACTH values are suggestive of secondary adrenal
insufficiency. The situation can be resolved using complex biochemical
tests with the analog of ACTH, synacthen. The short synacthen test involves
an intramuscular injection of 0.25 mg of synacthen. The concentration of
plasma cortisol is measured within 30 min. If it rises by at least 200 or to a
value greater than 550 nmol dm‚Äì3, then Addison‚Äôs disease is unlikely. If this
is not the case, then it is appropriate to proceed to the long synacthen test
which involves an intramuscular injection of 1 mg of ACTH daily for three
days. On the fourth day, the short synacthen test is performed and the serum
concentration of cortisol is measured. If this is less than 200 nmol dm‚Äì3 with
no increase following administration of synacthen there is primary adrenal
failure and the patient is suffering from Addison‚Äôs disease. If, however, there
is an incremental increase of at least 200 nmol dm‚Äì3 above the baseline, then
the decreased output of cortisol from adrenal gland is secondary and due to
a deficiency of ACTH caused by a hypothalamic or pituitary disorder. Once
Addison‚Äôs disease is diagnosed, it is necessary to ascertain its cause. A number
of laboratories test for the presence of antibodies against the adrenal glands to
see if there is an autoimmune cause. A plain abdominal X-ray may be useful in
that it can detect calcification of adrenal glands as a result of TB (Chapter 3).
The conventional therapy for Addison‚Äôs disease involves treatment with
steroids, such as hydrocortisone and fludrocortisone, which possess
glucocorticoid and mineralocorticoid activities respectively. If a patient is left
untreated he or she will eventually experience an adrenal crisis precipitated
by stress, bacterial infection, trauma or surgery, which is a medical emergency.
Typical clinical features of a crisis are abdominal pain, vomiting, hypotension
together with hyponatremia, hypoglycemia and hyperkalemia. Its treatment
involves administering saline infusions to correct the hypotension, fluid

W^dad\nd[Y^hZVhZ

DISORDERS OF THE ADRENAL CORTEX

and salt losses and intravenous steroids to correct glucocorticoid and
mineralocorticoid deficiencies. The precipitating factors, such as bacterial
infections, require identification and appropriate treatment.

CUSHING‚ÄôS SYNDROME
Adrenal hyperfunction can cause Cushing‚Äôs syndrome and arise from a
number of causes. The commonest cause is a pituitary lesion secreting high
levels of ACTH (referred to as Cushing‚Äôs disease). Other causes include ectopic
production of ACTH from a carcinoma of the lungs, or excessive production
of cortisol from an adrenal adenoma or carcinoma and iatrogenic causes,
such as corticosteroid or ACTH treatment. The major clinical features (Figure
7.31) include truncal obesity, thinning of skin, excessive bruising, poor wound
healing, purple striae on the abdomen and thighs, muscle weakness and
wasting, hirsutism, the development of increased body hair on the face, chest
upper back and abdomen in females (especially in adrenal carcinoma), hypertension, amenorrhea and psychiatric disturbances. Excess of cortisol has a
mineralocorticoid effect leading to the retention of Na+ and water producing
hypertension. Hypokalemia may also occur because of an excessive loss of K+
(Chapter 8). Excess cortisol increases blood glucose levels and some of these
patients may have diabetes mellitus. The clinical features are due to increased
cortisol production and, partly, to excessive androgen release.

X]VeiZg,/

DISORDERS OF THE ENDOCRINE SYSTEM

Diagnosis and treatment of Cushing‚Äôs syndrome
A clinical suspicion of the syndrome is supported by hypokalemia and
alkalosis, high urinary free cortisol, which is normally less than 300 nmol per
24 h, and loss of the usual diurnal rhythm of cortisol secretion. Initial screening
criteria are followed by tests using the cortisol analog, dexamethasone, which
is not detected by the usual methods of measuring cortisol. Dexamethasone,
however, suppresses ACTH production and cortisol secretion in normal people.
The low dose dexamethasone test involves giving 1 mg of dexamethasone
at night. A blood specimen is taken for cortisol measurement the following
morning. A failure of dexamethasone to suppress cortisol release is suggestive
of Cushing‚Äôs syndrome or disease. To distinguish between the two, a high dose
dexamethasone test may be used or the concentration of ACTH in plasma
measured. The high dose dexamethasone test consists of administering
2 mg of dexamethasone every 6 h for a period of 48 h. The concentration of
cortisol in the plasma is then measured at 09.00 h on the morning following
the last dose. In Cushing‚Äôs syndrome, due to excessive secretion of cortisol by
an adrenal tumor or in response to an ectopic source of ACTH, suppression
of cortisol does not occur. In Cushing‚Äôs disease, caused by a pituitary lesion
secreting ACTH, the concentration of cortisol is suppressed to less than 50%
of its value prior to the test. Plasma ACTH levels are raised in patients with
Cushing‚Äôs disease and ectopic ACTH production, but are low in patients who
have an adrenal tumor that secretes cortisol.
The management and treatment of Cushing‚Äôs syndrome depends upon its
cause. Drugs, such as metyrapone, that inhibit the synthesis of cortisol may
be used. Tumors can be removed surgically.

CONGENITAL ADRENAL HYPERPLASIA
Congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) is an autosomal recessive condition
(Chapter 15) characterized by an abnormal biosynthesis of steroid hormones
in the adrenal glands. The clinical features depend on whether cortisol and/
or aldosterone or androgens are involved. The commonest cause of CAH is
a complete or partial deficiency of 21-hydroxylase activity (Figure 7.32) that
accounts for 95% of all cases, and occurs with an incidence of 1 in 12 000
newborn babies in the UK. A deficiency of 21-hydroxylase activity blocks
the synthesis of cortisol and, as a consequence, negative feedback to the
anterior pituitary is diminished. The anterior pituitary increases its secretion
of ACTH, which causes hyperplasia of the adrenal glands. The substrate,
17A-hydroxyprogesterone accumulates and stimulates the production of
adrenal androgens. A deficiency in 21-hydroxylase activity is complete in
approximately one-third of CAH patients. Less common forms of CAH are
characterized by deficiencies of other enzymes in the synthetic pathway.
Females affected with CAH are born with ambiguous genitalia, although
in cases of partial enzyme deficiency this may not be apparent until early
adulthood where the female presents with hirsutism, amenorrhea and
infertility. Males with CAH present with premature development of the
male secondary sexual characteristics called pseudoprecocious puberty. In
individuals with a complete deficiency of 21-hydroxylase activity, aldosterone
production is also inhibited and these individuals usually present shortly
after birth with a life-threatening condition characterized by excessive salt
and water loss.

Diagnosis and treatment of congenital adrenal hyperplasia
Diagnosis of CAH due to 21-hydroxylase deficiency is made by detecting
increased concentrations of 17A-hydroxyprogesterone in the baby‚Äôs blood at
least two days following birth. Maternal 17A-hydroxyprogesterone may still be
present at two days postparturition, hence the need for the delay. The affected

individuals are treated with cortisol and, if necessary, aldosterone. The
treatment should reduce ACTH secretion and therefore excessive androgen
production. The treatment requires monitoring by regular measurements of
plasma 17A-hydroxyprogesterone.

CONN‚ÄôS SYNDROME
Conn‚Äôs syndrome, also called primary hyperaldosteronism, is characterized by
an increased production of aldosterone. In 80% of cases this is due to an adrenal
adenoma. Other causes include hypertrophy of the zona glomerulosa of the
adrenal cortex and adrenal carcinoma, although the latter is extremely rare.
The excessive secretion of aldosterone leads to the increased retention of Na+
and loss of K+ by the kidneys. Most of the clinical features, muscle weakness,
tetany, paresthesiae, polydipsia and polyuria, are due to the hypokalemia
(Chapter 8) whereas the excessive Na+ retention causes hypertension.

Diagnosis and treatment of Conn‚Äôs syndrome
Investigating the possibility of Conn‚Äôs syndrome involves determining the
concentrations of Na+ and K+ in the serum and urine of the patient. Plasma
Na+ can be high, slightly increased or normal, whereas that of K+ is always
reduced. Measurements of plasma aldosterone and renin in patients with
Conn‚Äôs syndrome often show a high aldosterone concentration and a low
renin activity. Conn‚Äôs syndrome is managed by treating its underlying cause.
Often this is a tumor that must be removed surgically. Other approaches
involve using diuretics, such as spironolactone, an antagonist to aldosterone
that helps to control hypertension. This is particularly useful when the cause
of Conn‚Äôs syndrome is adrenal hyperplasia.

DISORDERS OF THE ENDOCRINE SYSTEM

BOX 7.2 Pheochromocytoma
Adrenaline (epinephrine) and noradrenaline (norepinephrine)
are catecholamine hormones secreted by the adrenal medulla.
They stimulate increases in heart, metabolic and breathing rates,
the depth of breathing and dilate blood vessels to muscles and
increase the metabolism of carbohydrate stores to prepare the
body for ‚Äòfright, Ô¨Çight or Ô¨Åght‚Äô.
Pheochromocytomas are tumors of the adrenal medulla that
cause uncontrolled and irregular secretion of adrenaline and
noradrenaline. Such tumors are usually benign, that is they do
not metastasize (Chapter 17), and are rare causes of hypertension
(Chapter 14) accounting for some 0.5% of such cases.
Adrenaline and noradrenaline are metabolized to metadrenaline
and normetadrenaline respectively by catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT). Metadrenaline and normetadrenaline are
converted to 4-hydroxy-3-methoxymandelic acid (HMMA), also
known as vanillylmandelic acid (VMA), by monoamine oxidase
(MAO). Metadrenaline and normetadrenaline and HMMA are all
excreted in the urine (Figure 7.33).
Patients affected by pheochromocytomas present with
headaches, pallor, tremors, increased heart rate and palpitations,
sweating and abdominal discomfort. Pheochromocytoma
leads to high levels of catecholamines in the plasma. However,
a diagnosis based on measurement of plasma levels is difÔ¨Åcult,
as they are subject to variation by a number of factors including
posture. Screening tests include measuring and demonstrating
increased concentrations of urinary HMMA or metadrenaline
and normetadrenaline (Figure 7.33). The reference range for
urine HMMA is less than 35 Mmol per 24 h whereas those for
metadrenaline and normetadrenaline are less than 0.1 and less
than 0.57 Mmol per 24 h respectively. In cases where the results
are equivocal, the pentolinium test is conducted. Patients are
given 2.5 mg of pentolinium by intravenous injection. A blood
specimen is collected before and 15 min after the injection.
Pentolinium is a drug that inhibits release of catecholamines

in normal individuals but not in those suffering from
pheochromocytoma.
The treatment of pheochromocytoma involves surgical removal
of the tumor. However, it is necessary to block the action of
excess adrenaline and noradrenaline before any surgery by
administration of phenoxybenzamine. This is because during the
operation, the sudden release of large amounts of catecholamines
results in high blood pressure which, in turn, could cause a heart
attack or brain hemorrhage.

7.10 REPRODUCTIVE HORMONES
The male and female reproductive systems (Figure 7.34 (A) and (B)) produce
and secrete a number of sex hormones and are responsible for the maturation
of germ cells, the production of gametes and, in the female, the fertilization
of the ovum and its subsequent growth and development. The testes produce
male gametes or spermatozoa (‚Äòsperms‚Äô) that mature and are stored in the
epididymis and vas deferens. Testes are composed of lobules with up to
three seminiferous tubules containing cells undergoing spermatogenesis.
These cells are supported and nourished by Sertoli cells. Spermatogenesis
involves meiosis and produces haploid sperm (Chapter 15) as outlined in
Figure 7.35. Each sperm has a head and a tail consisting of a midpiece and
flagellum. The midpiece contains mitochondria that provide energy for the
locomotory movements of the flagellum. The head contains a nucleus and

is covered by a cap called an acrosome, which contains enzymes required to
penetrate the ovum or egg. The production of ova, female gametes, begins
in the ovaries by a process called oogenesis (Figure 7.36). Primordial germ
cells in the outer germinal epithelium divide by mitosis to form a diploid
primary oocyte that becomes surrounded by follicle cells to produce primary
follicles. These migrate into the center of the ovary. As many as two million
primary follicles are present at birth and remain dormant until puberty.
Approximately 400 primary follicles mature over the lifetime of a female until
follicle development ceases at the menopause. The primary follicle matures
to form a secondary follicle. During this development, the primary oocyte
divides by meiosis but this is arrested and forms a haploid secondary oocyte,
which is the precursor of the ovum, and a small polar body. In an adult
fertile female, the nucleus of a secondary oocyte begins the second meiotic
division at each monthly ovulation but progresses only to metaphase, when

division again ceases. The second meiotic division of the secondary oocyte is
completed at fertilization.
In males and females, the hypothalamus secretes gonadotrophin releasing
hormone (GnRH) which regulates secretion of LH and FSH from the basophil
cells of the anterior pituitary. Secretion of GnRH, LH and FSH occurs in pulses.
Follicle stimulating hormone and LH act cooperatively to stimulate the ovaries
and testes to secrete sex hormones and to develop germ cells.
The testes are stimulated by LH to release testosterone from their Leydig
cells (Figure 7.37). Testosterone is the principal androgen and its secretion
inhibits further release of LH by a negative feedback mechanism. Follicle
stimulating hormone and testosterone are required by Sertoli cells in the
basement membrane of the seminiferous tubules to produce inhibin that,
in turn, inhibits the secretion of FSH by negative feedback (Figure 7.37).
Testosterone is also required for sexual differentiation, the development of
secondary sexual characteristics and spermatogenesis. It is transported in the
blood, bound to sex hormone binding globulin, SHBG (Figure 7.38 (A)) and to
a lesser extent albumin. Typically, only its free fraction is metabolically active.
Testosterone enters target cells and is converted to the potent androgen,
dihydrotestosterone by the enzyme 5@-reductase. Testosterone is also found
in the plasma of normal females, half of which is secreted by the ovaries, the
remainder arising from the peripheral conversion of androstenedione and
DHEAS, both of which are secreted by the adrenal cortex.
The ovaries produce estrogens, of which estradiol is required for the development of female secondary sexual characteristics and normal menstruation.
Circulating estradiol is bound mostly to SHBG (Figure 7.38 (B) ), although the
blood concentration of estradiol varies widely with the menstrual cycle.

respectively.

The plasma concentration of estradiol is low before puberty but increases
rapidly and fluctuates during the menstrual cycle, a series of cyclical changes
in the ovary, uterus and pituitary that occur approximately every 28 days until
the menopause. Variations in plasma hormones in the menstrual cycle (Figure
7.40) depend on interactions between the hypothalamus, anterior pituitary
and ovaries. Follicle stimulating hormone is released at the beginning of the
cycle and increases growth of the follicles in the ovaries. Estradiol production
increases the sensitivity of the pituitary to GnRH but decreases its secretion
by the hypothalamus. The release of estradiol gradually increases and a follicle
matures during the first half of the cycle. At the start of each cycle, about 20
secondary follicles enlarge and begin to secrete estrogen and the hormone
inhibin, and a cavity filled with follicular fluid forms around their ova. This is
referred to as antrum formation. By about the sixth day, one of the secondary
follicles in an ovary has outgrown the others and becomes the dominant
follicle. Its secretion of estrogen and inhibin decreases the secretion of FSH

BOX 7.3 Oral contraceptive pill
Oral contraceptives (Figure 7.39) known colloquially as the pill,
contain a synthetic version of estrogen, called ethinylestradiol
and the synthetic version of progesterone, progestogen. The
estrogen prevents ovulation taking place, whereas progestogen
acts on the pituitary gland to block the normal physiological
control of the menstrual cycle. Progestogen alters the lining of
the uterus so that it is unsuitable for implantation and increases
the viscosity of the mucus in the cervix, so that conception is less
likely even if ovulation does occur. Oral contraceptive pills are
taken daily for three weeks and then stopped for a week during
menstruation.
Pincus (1903‚Äì1967) began development of the contraceptive
pill in 1950. Within a few years, clinical trials on 6000 women
began in Puerto Rico and Haiti. The Ô¨Årst commercially available
contraceptive pill was introduced in 1960 after it was discovered
that Mexican yam (Pachyrhizus erosus) was a cheap natural source
of the hormone precursors required to make the pill. Over 60
million women worldwide use the pill with about three million in
the UK. Early contraceptive pills contained between 100‚Äì175 Mg
of estrogen and 100 mg of progestogen. However, shortly after
introduction of the pill, some concern was expressed about their
side effects. These included an increased disposition to blood
clots, heart attacks and strokes, although the risks involved were
still relatively small. Studies by 1969 showed that the increased

REPRODUCTIVE HORMONES

Following copulation, the sperm are propelled through the vas deferens by
muscular contractions into the urethra. The sperm are suspended in liquid
semen produced by the seminal vesicles, prostate and bulbourethral glands.
Semen contains nutrients, which activates and increases the motility of sperm,
and is alkaline to counteract the acidity of the vagina. The ruptured follicle
develops into the corpus luteum, which secretes progesterone and estradiol
and stimulates the development of the endometrium for implantation.
Fertilization of the egg to form a zygote usually takes place in the Fallopian
tubes and the developing embryo is transported to the uterus by ciliary action
and muscular contractions. The zygote begins a series of mitotic divisions
to form a developing embryo that embeds into the endometrium lining the
uterus and undergoes further development to produce a fetus and eventually
a neonate in 9 months. Fertilization ensures that the corpus luteum does not
degenerate but begins to produce a number of sex hormones, together with
those produced by the gonads and anterior pituitary.

(Figures 7.36 and 7.40), leading to the regression of the other follicles in an
apoptotic process to form atretic follicles. It is uncertain how only the one
follicle becomes dominant, but appears to be related to its ability to secrete
the estrogen, needed for its maturation under the influence of LH. Maturation
involves the dominant secondary follicle accumulating fluid filled cavities
that eventually enlarge to the point where they are called a Graafian follicle.
Ovulation occurs each month when a Graafian follicle ruptures to release
the oocyte, now usually called an ovum, into the Fallopian tube. The ovum
is transported along the tube by ciliary action. The portion of the follicle
remaining in the ovary develops into a corpus luteum. If fertilization does not
occur, this degenerates within 10 days or so.

risks of heart attacks and stroke were related to the amounts of
estrogen in the pills. As a consequence, the amounts of estrogens
used have decreased over the years and by 2006 contained less
than one third of that in earlier contraceptive pills. Indeed, a
reduction in the risk of heart disease and stroke has been detected
in females on modern versions of the pill. Initially, there was some
concern that usage of the pill increased the likelihood of cancers
of the breast and cervix, but clinical data have cast doubt on this.
Using the pill is still associated with some side effects, such as
nausea, bleeding between menstrual periods and depression. The
pill does increase the chance of blood clot in the legs (deep vein
thrombosis, DVT, Chapter 14) although the risk for most pill users
is very low. It is now known that usage of the pill may have many
beneÔ¨Åts, for example protection against pelvic infection because
the thickened cervical mucus acts as a barrier to bacteria. Also,
long-term usage of the pill has been reported to reduce the risk
of certain ovarian cancers and can prevent ectopic pregnancies.
The development of the contraceptive pill has been a remarkable
achievement as it allows women to control their fertility in a safe
and effective manner. Since its introduction, the pill has had a
tremendous impact on female liberty and has aided the process
of making pregnancy and motherhood a choice for women.
This, particularly in the developed world, has given them greater
choices in marriage, work, love and lifestyle.

There is also a ‚Äòmorning after pill‚Äô, also known as the ‚Äòpostcoital
pill‚Äô. This pill is used by women to reduce the chances of pregnancy following unprotected sexual intercourse. It contains the
active ingredient levonorgestrel, which is a synthetic derivative of
progesterone. The precise mechanism of action of this pill is still
unclear but it is believed to act by preventing ovulation, fertilization and implantation of the fetus. The whole process from fertilization to implantation in the womb can take up to three days,
so the morning after pill can prevent pregnancy occurring for up
to 72 h after intercourse. This pill is more effective the earlier it is
taken after intercourse and it is estimated that 85% of pregnancies
would be prevented if the morning after pill was taken within 72
h of sexual intercourse.
There is considerable interest in a contraceptive pill designed for
use by men. This pill contains desogestrel as well as testosterone.
This combination blocks the production of sperm while
maintaining male characteristics and sex drive. As with the female
contraceptive pill, it must be taken daily. In preliminary studies,
the male pill reduced sperm counts to zero and is expected to be
more effective than the female pill or the condom. According to
the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) of the USA, the condom
has a failure rate of about 14% under typical conditions, while
the failure rate of the female pill is less than 1%. The male pill
appears to be 100% effective.

DISORDERS OF THE ENDOCRINE SYSTEM

DISORDERS OF SEX HORMONES
Disorders associated with male sex hormones include hypogonadism and
gynecomastia. In the former, there is deficient sperm production and decreased
testosterone secretion. Hypogonadism can occur because of testicular disease,
referred to as primary or hypergonadotrophic hypogonadism, or to a defect
in the hypothalamus or pituitary gland leading to secondary or hypogonadotrophic hypogonadism. In the latter, there may be a deficiency of both gonadotrophins or only of LH. The causes of primary hypogonadism are varied.
They include congenital defects, such as Klinefelter syndrome (Chapter 15), a
deficiency of 5A-reductase activity, testicular agenesis (failure of the testes to
develop), acquired defects due to testicular infections, for example mumps or
cytotoxic drugs, trauma or irradiation. The causes of secondary hypogonadism include pituitary tumors and hypothalamic disorders such as Kallmann‚Äôs
syndrome. The treatment of hypogonadism is usually directed at the underlying cause. Testosterone is given in cases of testosterone deficiency. However, if
fertility is required then gonadotrophins may have to be administered.
Gynecomastia, or breast development in males, is usually related to a
disturbance in the balance of estrogens to androgens. In puberty, it occurs in
approximately 50% of normal boys due to a temporary increase in the secretion
of estrogens. Other than at puberty, the condition is pathological. It may
arise because of decreased androgen activity in hypogonadism or because of
increased estrogen production from various endocrine tumors. Such tumors
may secrete large quantities of estrogens or may secrete hCG that stimulates
estrogen production. Some drugs possess estrogen or antiandrogen activity
and their use can lead to gynecomastia.
Disorders associated with female sex hormones include amenorrhea,
oligomenorrhea, infrequent menstruation, and virilism, with the development
of hirsutism, muscle mass, deepening of the voice and male psychological
characteristics. Amenorrhea can be primary where menstruation fails to
occur by the age of 16 years, or secondary, where menstruation stops for three
months or more after normal menstruation has been established and before
menopause. The other clinical features of amenorrhea include hirsutism,
acne, menstrual cycle disturbances and obesity, although these features vary
in their severity and prevalence. A common reason for secondary amenorrhea
in females is pregnancy. This condition must be excluded before other possible
causes, for example stress, severe weight loss, polycystic ovary syndrome
(PCOS, see below), gonad dysgenesis, such as in Turner syndrome (Chapter
15), the decrease in gonadotrophin secretion associated with some tumors,
hyperprolactinemia and congenital adrenal hyperplasia, are investigated. The
causes of amenorrhea are investigated by measuring the concentrations of
FSH, LH and prolactin in plasma as outlined in Figure 7.41. A high value for
FSH indicates ovarian failure. One for prolactin suggests hyperprolactinemia
and requires further investigations to confirm this diagnosis. If, however,
the values for FSH, LH and prolactin are normal, further tests to investigate
pituitary or hypothalamic diseases are necessary. The management of
amenorrhea is aimed at treating its underlying cause.
Patients with virilism present with enlargement of the clitoris, deepening
of the voice, atrophy of the breasts and hirsutism. Hair growth is not only
excessive but shows a male-like distribution. The cause of virilism is increased
androgen secretion although abnormally low levels of SHBG can also increase
the free testosterone fraction. In some cases virilism occurs because of an
increased sensitivity to androgens by target cells. Its causes include PCOS,
androgen secreting tumors, congenital adrenal hyperplasia, Cushing‚Äôs
syndrome and may be iatrogenic following treatment with androgens and
progesterone. Its commonest cause is PCOS, characterized by multiple cysts
in the ovaries that arise from follicles that have failed to ovulate. The ovaries
secrete large amounts of androgens although why this is so is unclear. Many

patients with PCOS suffer from acne, obesity, type 2 diabetes mellitus and may
be infertile. A diagnosis of PCOS is made on clinical grounds and assisted by
ultrasonography. Plasma LH is often increased in these patients but may be
normal, whereas the concentration of testosterone is increased. Treatment of
severe PCOS may involve using the antiandrogen drug, cyproterone but this
leads to infertility. If fertility is required, then clomiphene, an antiestrogen
drug, may be used and can induce ovulation in 75% of cases.

Infertility
Infertility is defined as a failure to conceive despite regular unprotected sexual
intercourse for one year. Female infertility may be due to failure to ovulate,
obstruction of the Fallopian tubes or to diseases of the uterine lining. In
females, failures to ovulate due to hyperprolactinemia or to hypothalamicpituitary dysfunction are responsible for 20% of cases of infertility. Damage
to the Fallopian tubes may also be a cause of female infertility. Male infertility
is usually due to decreased numbers or motility of sperm (oligospermia)
or complete absence of sperm (azoospermia). Infertility due to endocrine
dysfunction occurs only rarely in males. The normal volume of ejaculate is

2 to 5 cm3 and contains 40 to 500 million sperm. A sperm count of less than
20 million per cm3 is believed to be subnormal and causes 25% of infertility
cases. In general, the lower the total sperm number the greater the chances of
infertility although men with low counts have been known to father children.
The motility of sperm is also necessary for fertilization to take place and at
least 60% of sperm should have a normal shape and be mobile with beating
flagella.
Investigating infertility involves a clinical and laboratory evaluation of
both partners. Women should be investigated for regular menstruation.
If it is regular, then ovulation is probably occurring. The concentration of
progesterone in plasma is also indicative and should exceed 30 nmol dm‚Äì3
on day 21 of the menstrual cycle, values below 10 nmol dm‚Äì3 are suggestive
of abnormal ovulation. If ovulation is confirmed then it may be necessary to
examine cervical mucus following intercourse to determine the presence of
motile, normal shaped sperm.
Microscopic examination of samples of ejaculate will indicate whether the
sperm produced are motile and normal in shape or show abnormalities, such
as malformed heads and twin sperm formed by a failure in development.
Sperm counts will show if adequate numbers of sperm are produced. A low
sperm count may be further investigated by measuring the concentrations
of testosterone, FSH and LH in the plasma to compare with their reference
ranges of 9‚Äì30 nmol dm‚Äì3, 2‚Äì10 U dm‚Äì3 and 2‚Äì10 U dm‚Äì3 respectively. In some
cases, a biopsy of the testes may by necessary. Investigation of infertility in

7.11 SUMMARY
The endocrine glands and the hormones they produce control many of the
activities of the body. Hormones are released into the blood and travel to
their sites of action where they bind to cell surface or intracellular receptors
to initiate activities. Hormones belong to several categories of molecules
including amines, peptides, proteins and steroids. Endocrine disorders may
arise from damage to the endocrine gland, causing hypo- or hypersecretion of
the hormone, or some failure of the hormone‚Äìreceptor interactions. Disorders
of the pituitary gland may arise from pituitary tumors, such as prolactinomas,
with excessive secretion of hormones. Abnormal GH secretion leads to
dwarfism or acromegaly. Several thyroid disorders arise as a consequence of
autoimmune conditions which can cause hypo- or hyperactivities. However,
the commonest endocrine disorders involve insulin resistance or its absence
leading to dysregulation of blood glucose concentrations. Disorders of
the adrenal gland can result in Addison‚Äôs disease or Cushing‚Äôs syndrome.
Dysfunctions associated with reproductive hormones can cause a number
of clinical conditions, including gynecomastia in men and disruption of
menstruation, infertility, and virilism in women.

INTRODUCTION

Homeostasis is the maintenance of a stable internal environment within
the body. This stability is necessary for optimum functioning of proteins,
particularly enzymes, cells, tissues, organs and systems. Many substances have
to be maintained at appropriate concentrations, including water, electrolytes,
such as Na+, K+, Ca2+, Mg2+ and Pi, and the acid‚Äìbase components H+ and HCO3‚Äì.
In addition, waste products, such as urea and urate, must be kept below
toxic levels. Normally biochemical and physiological mechanisms regulate
and control the concentrations of all these components and, in general,
homeostatic controls involve negative feedback mechanisms. A receptor
detects unacceptable levels of a particular substance under homeostatic
control and sends a signal to a regulatory center that initiates a response that
corrects the imbalance and returns conditions to a physiologically acceptable
state (Figure 8.1). Once normality returns, the receptor is no longer stimulated
and the center ceases to respond. Disorders of homeostasis can occur, often
as a result of failures in the control mechanisms or because of damage to the
regulatory center by external agents.

DISORDERS OF WATER, ELECTROLYTES AND URATE BALANCES

Within the body, the kidneys regulate water, electrolyte concentrations,
including acid‚Äìbase balance (Chapter 9), and excrete nitrogenous wastes, for
example urate. Disorders of water, electrolyte and acid‚Äìbase homeostasis and
urate excretion account for a large number of investigations that are carried
out in hospital laboratories.

8.2

KIDNEYS

The functions of the kidney include maintaining the volume of the plasma
and its concentrations of electrolytes, such as Na+ and K+, and keeping its pH
within normal physiological ranges. This is largely achieved by varying the
amounts of water and salts excreted, the removal of excess H+ (Chapter 9)
and the regeneration of HCO3‚Äì. Kidneys also excrete waste products, such as
urea, urate and creatinine, and produce the enzyme rennin and the hormones
erythropoietin and calcitriol (also called 1A,25-dihydroxycholecalciferol,
1A,25DHCC). These control blood pressure, stimulate the production of
erythrocytes by the bone marrow (Chapter 13) and regulate the absorption of
Ca2+ by the gastrointestinal tract (GIT) (Chapter 11) respectively. Kidneys also
synthesize prostaglandins and degrade hormones, such as insulin.
Each kidney is composed of an outer fibrous capsule, a cortex, a middle medulla
and an inner pelvis region (Figure 8.2A). The tough capsule surrounding each
kidney offers protection against trauma and prevents the entry of bacteria
(Chapter 3). Kidneys are composed of about a million functional units called
nephrons each composed of a tuft of capillaries called a glomerulus and a
tubule. Tubules have four different regions: the proximal tubule, the loop
of Henle, the distal tubule and the collecting duct (Figure 8.2B). The cortex

contains the Bowman‚Äôs capsules and their glomeruli. The medulla is composed
of the tubules arranged in pyramids that lead into calyces that, in turn, lead
into the pelvis of the kidney. The pelvis drains into the ureters that take urine
from the kidneys to the bladder.
Kidneys have a rich blood supply and normally receive about 25% of the
cardiac output. The renal artery supplies blood at a high pressure to afferent
arterioles that supply the glomerular capillaries. Glomerular capillaries
drain into efferent arterioles that, in turn, divide to form a capillary network
covering the nephron (Figure 8.2B). Blood eventually leaves each kidney
in a renal vein. Blood is separated from the lumen of the tubules by three
layers: the capillary endothelial cells, a basement membrane and specialized
epithelial cells of the Bowman‚Äôs capsule, called podocytes (Figure 8.3).
Openings between the extensions of the podocytes are called fenestra. The
basement membrane contains negatively charged glycoproteins that give the
basement membrane an overall negative charge. The hydrostatic pressure of
blood in the glomerulus is high at 10 kPa because of its direct route from
the heart and because the diameters of afferent arterioles supplying the
glomeruli are less than the efferent arterioles collecting blood from them.
This forces the plasma to filter through the layers into the lumen of the
capsule. The hydrostatic pressure of blood in the glomerulus is opposed
by osmotic pressure of 4 kPa generated by its plasma proteins and a back
pressure of 2.7 kPa exerted by the filtrate in the Bowman‚Äôs capsule. Thus the
effective pressure, Peff, is:
Peff = 10 ‚Äì (4 + 2.7) = 3.3 kPa
Water and small molecules are passively filtered into the Bowman‚Äôs capsule
leaving blood cells and plasma proteins in the capillary. Particles with a
Mr less than 5000, such as electrolytes, sugars, amino acid, urea and some
small polypeptides and proteins pass freely from the plasma through the
glomerular wall into the lumen of the capsule. Substances with Mr up to
68 000, can penetrate to some extent but larger molecules, such as proteins
above 68 000 are excluded because of their size and to some extent their
charge, given that most plasma proteins are negatively charged at pH 7.4.
Hence the initial filtrate in the capsule lumen has a composition similar to
that of plasma except that it is largely free of protein. Most of the filtrate is
reabsorbed as it passes along the nephron. The proximal tubule is responsible
for bulk reabsorption of filtrate while the distal tubule is important for fine
tuning its composition depending upon the needs of the body. Normally all
the glucose, amino acids, K+ and HCO3‚Äì and about 75% of the Na+ are absorbed
by energy dependent mechanisms. The reabsorption of water occurs passively
and follows Na+ reabsorption. Approximately 90% of the filtered Na+ and 80%
of water is reabsorbed in the distal tubule. More Na+ is reabsorbed in the distal
tubule by the cells exchanging it for K+ and H+. This exchange is controlled by

aldosterone (Chapter 7). Between 6 and 12% of the filtered urate is excreted by
the kidneys with the remainder being reabsorbed in the proximal convoluted
tubule. Tubular fluid passes into collecting ducts that extend into the renal
medulla and discharge urine into the renal pelvis. About 1 to 2 dm3 of urine
is produced per day depending on the amount of fluid intake with larger
volumes being produced after increased intake of water.

RENAL FUNCTION TESTS
Renal function tests are used to detect the presence of renal diseases and assess
their progress. They are, however, of little use in determining the causes of
renal disease. The most widely used test is to measure the glomerular filtration
rate (GFR), that is, the rate of filtrate formation by the kidneys. The value of
the GFR depends on the net pressure across the glomerular membrane, the
physical nature of the membrane and the surface area of the membrane that
reflects the number of functioning glomeruli. All three factors can change as
a result of disease and this will be reflected in the value of the GFR. In adults,
the GFR is about 120 cm3 per minute although it is related to body size, being
higher in men than women. The GFR is also affected by age and declines in
the elderly.

Measuring the GFR
The GFR is determined by measuring the concentration of a substance in
the urine and plasma that is known to be completely filtered from the plasma
at the glomerulus. This substance must not be reabsorbed nor secreted by
renal tubules and must remain at a constant concentration in the plasma
throughout the period of urine collection. It should also be possible to
measure the concentration of this substance in the plasma and urine both
conveniently and reliably. Inulin and creatinine have been used to assess GFR
using the equation:
GFR  (Uc s V) / Pc
where Uc is the concentration of substance in urine, Pc is the concentration of
substance in plasma, V is rate of formation of urine in cm3 per min giving the
GFR units of cm3 min‚Äì1.
Creatinine is derived from creatine phosphate in the muscle and the amount
produced daily is relatively constant. An estimate of creatinine clearance can
be made by a determination of the creatinine concentration in the plasma
(Figure 1.17) and the creatinine content in a 24-h urine collection. Normal
creatinine clearance in adults is between 115 and 125 cm3 min‚Äì1. Reliable
measurements of creatinine clearance are often difficult because of the need
to obtain a complete and accurately timed urine sample.
Measurements of the concentration of serum creatinine may be used to assess
renal function and they are easier to determine than creatinine clearance
values. The concentration of creatinine in serum increases with deteriorating
renal function but this test lacks sensitivity. For example, the GFR must fall
to less than 50% of the original value before there is a significant increase in
serum creatinine. This means that a normal serum creatinine value does not
necessarily exclude the presence of renal disease.

RENAL FAILURE
Renal failure is the cessation of renal function and it can be acute or chronic.
In acute renal failure there is rapid loss of renal function within hours or days,
although the condition is potentially reversible and normal renal function can
be regained. The deterioration is sudden, with increases in the concentrations
of urea, creatinine and H+ in serum. Patients with acute renal failure often, but
not always, present with oliguria, where there is less than 400 cm3 of urine

'%+

KIDNEYS

passed per day. Indeed, patients are sometimes anuric and do not pass any
urine at all. Chronic renal failure is the gradual, progressive deterioration of
kidney function. As kidney function declines, there is accumulation of waste
products that eventually reach toxic levels in the blood and may affect other
organs.

Acute renal failure
Acute renal failure can be categorized as prerenal, where the loss in renal
function is due to a decrease in renal blood flow, postrenal, where the loss is
due to an obstruction of the urinary tract, or intrinsic, where the loss is due to
damage to the kidney itself.
Prerenal kidney failure can occur because of a decreased plasma volume
following blood loss, burns, prolonged diarrhea or vomiting, decreased
cardiac output or occlusion of the renal artery. Whatever the reason, prerenal
acute renal failure results in a low GFR and decreased blood flow to kidneys.
Aldosterone and antidiuretic hormone (Section 8.3 and Chapter 7) release is
stimulated by the low blood pressure and the kidneys respond by producing
smaller volumes of concentrated urine. The biochemical indicators of prerenal
acute renal failure include increased amounts of urea and creatinine in serum
due to the low GFR, metabolic acidosis (Chapter 9), because of an inability
of the kidneys to excrete H+, and hyperkalemia (Section 8.5) because of the
low GFR and acidosis. Postrenal kidney damage can be the consequence of
a blockage of the urinary tract by, for example, renal calculi, kidney stones or
neoplasms. These obstructions increase the hydrostatic pressure that opposes
glomerular filtration. If this persists for a sufficiently long time it can cause
intrinsic renal damage. If pre- or postrenal acute failures are not corrected,
patients can develop intrinsic renal damage. A variety of conditions cause
intrinsic acute renal failure. These include nephrotoxins, for example drugs
such as aminoglycosides and analgesics, septic shock (Chapters 2 and 4), a
low cardiac output (Chapter 14), burns or crush injuries and renal diseases,
such as glomerulonephritis. Glomerulonephritis is inflammation of the renal
cortex which affects the filtration mechanism of the kidney. It may develop
following an infection (Chapters 2, 3 and 5).
Three phases occur in acute renal failure. The first is an oliguric phase with
a low urine output. The second is a diuretic phase where the urine output
increases while the third is a recovery phase when normal function returns.
The oliguric phase is characterized by increased concentrations of K+, urea,
creatinine and H+ in the serum. If the patient survives the oliguric phase, then
urine output increases after a few days when the diuretic phase starts. The GFR
increases during the diuretic phase and as the output of urine increases the
amounts of urea and creatinine in the serum gradually fall. Tubular function
may still be abnormal in this phase so that the acidosis may still persist. In the
recovery phase, tubular cells regenerate and tubular function is restored to
normal. The concentrations of urea and creatinine in serum decrease and K+
returns to normal levels as the GFR improves.
The management of acute renal failure includes correction of prerenal factors
if they are present. This could be achieved, for example by increasing the
extracellular fluid volume by administering fluids. Biochemical monitoring
of creatinine and K+ is required and dialysis may be necessary when K+
concentrations are high or when severe acidosis is present. The cause of the
renal failure should be identified and treated wherever possible.

Chronic renal failure
Many diseases, such as glomerulonephritis, diabetes mellitus, hypertension
and polycystic kidney disease, can lead to irreversible renal damage. All these
conditions effectively decrease the number of functioning nephrons. Patients

may remain asymptomatic until the GFR falls below 15 cm3 min‚Äì1. Chronic
renal failure progresses to end-stage renal failure (ESRF) where dialysis or a
kidney transplant is necessary for survival. Metabolic features of ESRF include
the impairment of urinary concentration and dilution, abnormal electrolyte
and H+ homeostasis, the retention of waste products and decreased syntheses
of erythropoietin and calcitriol. Chronic renal failure is accompanied by
increases in the concentrations of K+, urea, creatinine, Pi and H+ and decreased
Ca2+ in the plasma.
Patients with chronic renal failure often present with a number of clinical
features including neurological symptoms, such as lethargy, growth failure,
myopathy, anorexia, nausea, vomiting, anemia, hypertension, nocturia and
impotence. The causes of many of these are not known but are probably due
to the retention of toxins that cannot be excreted.
In some cases, it is possible to delay the progression of the disease by treating
its cause. A number of measures may be taken to alleviate symptoms before
dialysis becomes necessary. These include careful matching of water and Na+
intake with their losses. High blood K+ is controlled with oral ion exchange
resins given as their Ca2+ or Na+ salts (Section 8.5) whereas a high blood Pi is
controlled by oral aluminum or magnesium salts that precipitate ingested
phosphate in the GIT. A restriction of dietary protein may reduce the formation
of nitrogenous waste.

Water is necessary to maintain the volumes of body compartments, for
excretion of waste products and as a medium in which biochemical reactions
occur. Water intake is variable and can depend, to some extent, on social
habits but is supplied in the diet, from food as well as water and as a product
of oxidative metabolism. Its loss is variable although an almost fixed amount,
called the insensible loss, occurs from the GIT, skin and lungs. An average 70
kg man has 42 dm3 of water distributed between various body compartments
(Figure 8.4). Water accounts for 60% of body weight in men but only 55% in
women given they have a higher proportion of fat. In disease, patients can be
dehydrated, where water loss caused by vomiting and diarrhea exceeds gain,
or overhydrated, with an accumulation of water in body compartments. The
clinical features of dehydration and over hydration are listed in Table 8.1. A
reduced extracellular fluid (ECF) volume causes a decline in blood circulation
with decreased excretion of wastes and reduced oxygen and nutrient supply
to the cells. Humans deprived of fluid intake die after a few days because the
reduced total body fluid leads to a circulatory collapse.

DISORDERS OF WATER HOMEOSTASIS

The kidneys regulate water balance by varying the output of urine from 0.5
to 15 cm3 min‚Äì1 to match water intake. When there is an excess of water, the
kidneys lose water rapidly but in times of shortage it is conserved. The total body
water is therefore kept constant. Water loss from the kidneys can be regulated
by the hormone arginine vasopressin also called antidiuretic hormone
(ADH). Antidiuretic hormone acts by altering the permeability to water of the
collecting ducts in the kidneys. Osmoreceptor cells in the hypothalamus detect
an increase or decrease in osmolality between the intracellular fluid (ICF) and
ECF. An increase in the osmolality of the ECF stimulates the receptors and
these, in turn, stimulate the release of ADH from the posterior pituitary gland
(Chapter 7). Antidiuretic hormone then stimulates the kidneys to retain water
and produce a more concentrated urine. The retention of water helps return
the osmolality of the ECF back to normal. If the osmolality of the ECF is low,
the osmoreceptors are not stimulated and ADH is not released. This results in
water loss from the kidneys in dilute urine. The loss of water helps to increase
the osmolality of the ECF back to normal values. A low blood or ECF volume can
be detected by baroreceptors in the aortic arch and carotid sinus (Chapter 14).
These receptors also stimulate a release of ADH and, indeed, this mechanism
can override the release of ADH by osmolality to maintain blood volume and
therefore circulation. Antidiuretic hormone interacts with a second hormone,
aldosterone to maintain the normal volume and concentration of the ECF.
Aldosterone, a steroid hormone, is produced by the adrenal cortex (Chapter 7)
and released in response to a low ECF volume or blood pressure. It stimulates
retention of Na+ together with water in the kidneys returning the ECF volume
back to normal.
There are distinctive signs and symptoms associated with loss of water from
body compartments. For example, loss of water from the ICF results in cell
dysfunction that presents clinically as confusion, lethargy and coma. Loss of
water from the ECF decreases blood pressure, leading to renal shutdown and
shock. A reduction in total body water (ICF and ECF) produces a combination
of both effects.
All body fluids contain electrolytes (Table 8.2). The regulation of water content
by ADH helps to maintain normal electrolyte concentrations within the body.
The concentration of Na+ and K+ in the ICF and ECF are maintained largely
by the activity of the plasma membrane Na+/K+-ATPase (Chapter 11). This
enzyme acts as an energy-dependent pump that expels Na+ from the cell in
exchange for an intake of K+ to maintain both at physiological concentrations.
The concentrations of these ions are maintained within narrow ranges and,
since water can flow freely through most membranes, the concentrations
of Na+ and K+ are responsible for maintaining the appropriate osmolalities
of these compartments. The movement of water from one compartment to
another is mainly responsible for determining their volumes.
Homeostatic mechanisms exist to minimize changes in body water and
electrolyte composition and are particularly important in maintaining the

Margin Note 8.1 Osmolality and
the movement of water

i

Osmolality is the concentration
of particles (molecules or ions)
dissolved in a Ô¨Çuid. Compartments
of cells and, indeed, the body in
general are divided by selectively
permeable membranes. Most
biological membranes are freely
permeable to water. If the osmolality
is not the same on both sides of the
membrane, then there will be a net
movement of water from the side
of low to high osmolality since the
osmolality of a body compartment
is proportional to the concentration
of a compartment expressed as
mmoles of solute per kg of water.
In humans, the osmolality of serum
is approximately 285 mmol kg‚Äì1.
Serum osmolality can be measured
directly using an osmometer or, if the
concentration of solute particles is
known, it can be calculated in units
of mmol kg‚Äì1 using the expression:

volume of the ECF. Water will remain in the extracellular compartment only if
its osmolality is sufficiently high.
The assessment of fluid and electrolyte disorders in patients is a significant
workload in the hospital pathology laboratory. In most cases, clinical tests to
determine the concentrations of electrolytes in blood must be interpreted in
conjunction with a clinical examination which involves taking the patient‚Äôs
clinical history, looking for signs and symptoms of hydration or dehydration
and assessing kidney function.

8.4

DISORDERS OF Na+ HOMEOSTASIS

Sodium ions are significant constituents of tissues, including bone, they control
the volume of ECF and are required for normal neuromuscular functions. The
intake of Na+ is variable, from less than 100 mmol to more than 300 mmol day‚Äì1.
Losses are also variable, but renal loss is normally matched to intake. Small
amounts of Na+ are lost via skin and in feces and, under some circumstances,
the GIT (Chapter 11) can be a major route of Na+ loss, as in diarrhea.
The average 70 kg man contains 3700 mmol of Na+ (Figure 8.5), of which
75% is found in the ECF. Hyponatremia and hypernatremia refer to serum
concentrations of Na+ below and above the reference range of 135‚Äì145 mmol
dm‚Äì3. Hyponatremia is caused by an excessive retention of water or the loss of
Na+, these two conditions resulting in different clinical features. The retention
of water produces behavioral disturbances, headaches, confusion, convulsions
and eventually coma. The symptoms associated with excessive loss of Na+ are
weakness, apathy, dizziness, weight loss and hypotension. Hyponatremia
due to water retention is the more common. Water may be retained with or
without an increase in total body Na+. The former produces an edema, giving
an edematous hyponatremia, whereas the latter results in nonedematous
hyponatremia.
Edema is the excessive accumulation of fluid in interstitial compartments
of the body, resulting from an increase in the concentration of Na+ in the
ECF. It results in swelling, which may be localized in, for example, legs and
ankles (Figure 8.6) but can be more general in the chest cavity, abdomen
and lungs. The major causes of edematous hyponatremia are heart failure,
nephrotic syndrome and liver disease. All three reduce blood volume and
stimulate aldosterone secretion, which, in turn, stimulates the retention
of Na+. The reduced blood volume also stimulates release of ADH from the
posterior pituitary. Both result in more water than Na+ being retained, giving
rise to hyponatremia. Nephrotic syndrome leads to a loss of blood proteins
to the urine, reduced concentrations of albumin leading to edema. The
commonest cause of nephrotic syndrome is renal damage by diseases such as
glomerulonephritis (Chapter 3). The treatment of edematous hyponatremia
is aimed at its underlying cause, for example heart failure, kidney or liver
diseases, and at removing the excess water and Na+ using diuretics, and
restricting water intake.
Nonedematous hyponatremia, the result of water overload without an
increase in total body Na+, is due to a decreased excretion of water from the
syndrome of inappropriate secretion of ADH (SIADH), a severe renal failure
or an increased intake by compulsive drinking or excessive parenteral fluid.
The SIADH is a common finding in clinical practice. Patients present with
reduced plasma osmolality, normal kidney function and a low output of urine.
This syndrome is associated with many conditions, including malignancies,
for example carcinoma of the lungs or bowel (Chapter 17), infections, such
as pneumonia and tuberculosis (Chapter 3), trauma following, for example
abdominal surgery, or it may be induced with drugs, such as chlorpropamide.
All these conditions result in SIADH with water retention and a low urinary

DISORDERS OF K+ HOMEOSTASIS

output. The excessive water is distributed between ICF and ECF and so the
clinical signs of water overload, edema, may be mild or absent. Treatment of
SIADH is to reduce water intake to less than 750 cm3 day‚Äì1 and to correct its
underlying cause.
Hyponatremia from loss of Na+ decreases the total body Na+ of patients. The
losses may occur from vomiting, diarrhea, kidneys (aldosterone deficiency),
the effects of drugs, such as spironolactone, or a decreased dietary intake
of Na+, although this is very rare. The loss of Na+ is always accompanied
by water loss; as the volume of the ECF decreases the release of ADH is
stimulated and the increased reabsorption of water produces hyponatremia.
The decreased volume of ECF means that the patient presents with the
clinical symptoms of dehydration. Treatment is aimed at correcting the Na+
losses with intravenous infusions of 0.9% NaCl, and treating the underlying
cause, for example steroid therapy for aldosterone deficiency as in Addison‚Äôs
disease (Chapter 7).

Hypernatremia is caused by water depletion, water and Na+ depletion with
the loss of water predominating, or to an excess of Na+ (Figure 8.7). Its clinical
features are variable but, in general, patients present with muscular weakness,
hypertension, intense thirst (polydipsia) and polyuria. If fluid loss occurs, the
features associated with dehydration may be present. However, if Na+ is in
excess, raised blood pressure or edema may be seen.
Water depletion results from a decreased intake, such as in comatose patients,
infants or the elderly. The body conserves water by producing a low volume
of concentrated urine. Increased water losses can also occur in diseases such
as diabetes insipidus that result in large quantities of dilute urine (Chapter 7).
Hypernatremia with water and Na+ depletion occurs only if relatively more
water than Na+ is lost. It is commonly caused in children by excessive sweating
or diarrhea. Patients respond by producing low volumes of concentrated
urine. The condition may also occur during osmotic diuresis in patients with
diabetes mellitus (Chapter 7) where both water and Na+ are lost, together with
other electrolytes in large volumes of dilute urine, producing hypernatremia
and a decreased ECF. An excess of Na+ in the ECF is caused by an increased
intake or decreased excretion of Na+. The intake may be oral, for example salt
tablets or seawater, or parenteral as in the treatment of Conn‚Äôs or Cushing‚Äôs
syndromes (Chapter 7). Both disorders produce dilute urine due to retention
of Na+ by the kidneys.
Hypernatremia is treated by oral administration of water. If this is not
possible, then 5% dextrose is administered parenterally. If hypernatremia is
due to an excessive Na+ intake, measures to remove it must be considered.

DISORDERS OF K+ HOMEOSTASIS

Potassium ions are necessary to maintain cell volume, for the optimal
activities of a number of enzymes, and to maintain the resting potential of
cell membranes and therefore neuromuscular functions, especially in the
heart (Chapter 14). The intake of K+ varies between 30 and 100 mmol day‚Äì1
and losses are equally variable. The kidneys excrete most ingested K+ with a
smaller amount being eliminated by the GIT. A high concentration of plasma
K+ stimulates the release of aldosterone (Chapter 7) that, in turn, increases
the renal excretion of K+. Gastrointestinal losses can be significant during
vomiting and diarrhea. Only very small amounts of K+ are lost in sweat. The
average 70 kg human contains about 3600 mmol of K+ (Figure 8.8), almost all
being found in the ICF. Values for the concentration of K+ in the serum below
and above the reference range of 3.4 to 4.9 mmol dm‚Äì3 are called hypokalemia
and hyperkalemia respectively. Hyperkalemia is the more common clinical
condition.

DISORDERS OF WATER, ELECTROLYTES AND URATE BALANCES

Unlike Na+, the plasma K+ concentration does not vary significantly with
water loss or overload. However, hyperkalemia must be identified because
concentrations of serum K+ above 7 mmol dm‚Äì3 can result in cardiac arrest
and death. Renal failure, acidosis, aldosterone deficiency, damage to cells
and an excess intake of K+ can all cause hyperkalemia. In renal failure, the
kidneys are unable to excrete K+ because of the low GFR. Further, acidosis, a
common feature of renal failure, leads to hyperkalemia because the low pH of
the ECF means that K+ moves out of cells in exchange for H+, to return the pH
to reference values. A deficiency of aldosterone, such as in Addison‚Äôs disease
where the kidneys lose their ability to excrete K+, can result in hyperkalemia.
The destruction of cells during trauma can release large amounts of K+ causing
hyperkalemia. Lastly, an excessive oral or parenteral intake of K+ is a rare cause
of hyperkalemia. The treatment of hyperkalemia includes infusion of insulin
and glucose to promote the entry of K+ into cells. Severe hyperkalemia may
require dialysis.
Hypokalemia is clinically significant, giving rise to muscular weakness and
cardiac arrhythmias, hence patients often present with breathlessness and
chest pain. The causes of hypokalemia include increased K+ losses from
the GIT or kidneys, alkalosis, certain clinical disorders, some drugs, or a
decreased K+ intake. Excessive losses from the GIT can occur during vomiting
and diarrhea. Hypokalemia occurs in alkalosis because the pH of the ECF is
high and H+ moves from the ICF to the ECF as part of the buffering process,
while K+ moves in the opposite direction leading to hypokalemia. A number of
disorders, for example, Cushing‚Äôs and Conn‚Äôs syndromes, are associated with
increased cortisol and aldosterone production respectively. Both hormones
have mineralocorticoid activity and stimulate the renal retention of Na+ in
exchange for K+ causing hypokalemia. Drugs, such as carbenoxolone used
to treat gastric ulcers (Chapter 11), can cause hypokalemia because of their
mineralocorticoid activity. Decreases in oral or parenteral intakes of K+ are
rare but can lead to hypokalemia. Patients with hypokalemia are treated with
oral K+ salts. Severe hypokalemia may require intravenous infusions of K+.

8.6

DISORDERS OF Ca2+ HOMEOSTASIS

Calcium is required for bone and teeth structure, the release of neurotransmitters and initiation of muscle contraction, as a cofactor for coagulation
factors (Chapter 13), some enzyme activities and it also acts as an intracellular
second messenger for a number of hormones (Chapter 7).
The normal dietary intake of Ca2+ of about 25 mmol day‚Äì1 is supplemented
by the reabsorption of Ca2+ from gastrointestinal secretions. Approximately
19 mmol of Ca2+ is lost in the feces daily. The kidneys normally filter about
240 mmol of Ca2+ daily but, as most of this is reabsorbed by the tubules, normal
renal loss of Ca2+ is only about 6 mmol per day (Figure 8.9). Calcium is the most
abundant mineral in the body and the average adult contains approximately
1 kg or 25 000 mmol of Ca2+. Approximately 99% of Ca2+ is present in the bone.
About 500 mmol of Ca2+ is exchanged daily between bone and the ECF. The
ECF contains about 22.5 mmol of Ca2+, of which 9.0 mmol is present in the
plasma. Approximately 47% of Ca2+ in plasma occurs as free ionized Ca2+,
46% is protein bound and 7% is complexed with citrate or phosphate. Only
free Ca2+ is physiologically active and its plasma concentration is controlled
by homeostatic mechanisms involving the hormones parathyroid hormone
(PTH), calcitriol and calcitonin (Figure 8.10). Parathyroid hormone is secreted
by the parathyroid glands in response to a fall in the concentration of plasma
ionized Ca2+ and vice versa. It stimulates the release of Ca2+ from bone, a
process called bone resorption, and a decreased reabsorption of HCO3‚Äì by the
kidneys that produces an acidosis, which helps to increase plasma ionized
Ca2+ and stimulates the synthesis of calcitriol from cholecalciferol in the liver.

W^dad\nd[Y^hZVhZ

DISORDERS OF Ca2+ HOMEOSTASIS

This hormone is also formed in the skin by the action of ultraviolet light on
7-dehydrocholesterol. Calcitriol increases Ca2+ and Pi absorption from the
GIT and increases bone resorption. The physiological function of calcitonin
remains unclear but it is known to reduce the concentration of Ca2+ in plasma
by inhibiting both bone resorption and the renal reabsorption of Ca2+.
The serum reference range for total Ca2+ is 2.20‚Äì2.60 mmol dm‚Äì3 and for free
1.20‚Äì1.37 mmol dm‚Äì3. Values above and below these are called hypercalcemia
and hypocalcemia respectively.
The renal damage associated with hypercalcemia is its most serious
consequence. Hypercalcemia may suppress neuromuscular excitability
causing constipation and abdominal pain and affect the CNS, resulting
in depression, nausea and anorexia. The nausea may cause vomiting and
therefore dehydration. Calcium can stimulate gastrin and therefore gastric
acid secretion and so hypercalcemia may be associated with peptic ulcers
(Chapter 11). Hypercalcemia may cause arrhythmias and in severe cases may
result in cardiac arrest (Chapter 14). The commonest causes of hypercalcemia
are malignant disease or primary hyperparathyroidism. Less common causes
include thyrotoxicosis, vitamin D intoxication, thiazide diuretics and familial
hypocalciuric hypercalcemia. Rare causes are tuberculosis, sarcoidosis,
acromegaly, milk-alkali syndrome and idiopathic hypercalcemia of infancy.
Cancerous tumors of the lungs stimulate an increase in plasma Ca2+ by
producing a PTH related protein (PTHrp) that resembles the structure of
PTH (Figure 8.11). Cytokines and prostaglandins released by tumors that
have metastasized to the bones, may lead to increased resorption of Ca2.
Primary hyperparathyroidism occurs most commonly due to a parathyroid
adenoma, which is a benign tumor, and only rarely due to a parathyroid
carcinoma. It affects both men and women at any age but is most common in
postmenopausal women. In primary hyperparathyroidism, there is excessive
PTH secretion that causes hypercalcemia and sometimes hypophosphatemia
(Section 8.7), which increases bone turnover particularly of the metaphyses
(Figure 8.12). Thyroid hormones have no direct effect on Ca2+ homeostasis
but can cause increased bone turnover by increasing osteoclastic activity
and giving rise to mild hypercalcemia during thyrotoxicosis. An excessive
iatrogenic or accidental ingestion of vitamin D or thiazide diuretics that
interfere with renal Ca2+ loss can also cause hypercalcemia.
Familial hypocalciuric hypercalcemia is a recently recognized autosomal
dominant (Chapter 15) condition that develops from childhood. It is

characterized by chronic hypercalcemia but is usually asymptomatic,
with normal levels of PTH and no parathyroid adenoma. The mechanism
underlying this condition is unknown. Both sarcoidosis and tuberculosis are
granulomatous diseases. In these conditions, hypercalcemia occurs as there
is increased production of calcitriol by macrophages in the granulomas.
Hypercalcemia is occasionally seen in acromegaly, probably due to stimulation
of calcitriol production by excess growth hormone. Hypercalcemia may occur
in people who ingest large amounts of milk together with alkali antacids, such
as HCO3‚Äì, to relieve symptoms of peptic ulceration. An alkalosis occurs that
is believed to reduce renal Ca2+ excretion although the precise mechanism is
still unclear. This milk-alkali syndrome is very rare as antacid treatment of
peptic ulcers has been replaced by drugs that inhibit gastric acid secretion.
The condition idiopathic hypercalcemia of infancy is associated with
hypercalcemia because of an increased sensitivity to vitamin D in bone and the
GIT but the precise mechanism underlying this hypercalcemia is unknown.
Patients who present with hypercalcemia are investigated for malignancy or
primary hyperparathyroidism as this accounts for up to 90% of cases. If both
malignancy and primary hyperparathyroidism are excluded, other causes
must be considered and investigated (Figure 8.13 and Box 8.1). A number

BOX 8.1 Albumin and Ca2+
Changes in the concentration of albumin (Figure 8.14(A)) in
plasma affect the total Ca2+ concentration but not the free Ca2+
content. A high plasma albumin concentration gives rise to a
high total plasma Ca2+ concentration and, conversely, a low
plasma albumin concentration produces a low total plasma
Ca2+ concentration (Figure 8.14(B)). The determination of total
plasma or serum Ca2+ concentration can be misleading since it
is affected by conditions that change the concentration of albumin. The effect of these changes can be overcome by measuring
free Ca2+. However, its determination is difÔ¨Åcult and expensive
and the usual solution is to calculate an adjusted value for total
Ca2+ using the following formulae if the [albumin] is given in g

Since the free Ca2+ concentration is unaffected by variations in the
concentration of albumin, clinical symptoms are not manifested.
However, free Ca2+ competes with H+ for negatively charged
binding sites on albumin and changes in the concentration of
free Ca2+ may occur in acute acid‚Äìbase disorders, with clinical
consequences (Figure 8.15). These do not, however, affect the
total plasma Ca2+ concentration. In alkalosis, more H+ dissociates from albumin allowing increased amounts of free Ca2+ to
bind to it. This has the effect of increasing the protein bound
Ca2+ fraction but at the expense of decreasing the free plasma
Ca2+ leading to hypocalcemia. In acidosis, increasing amounts of
H+ bind to albumin as Ca2+ dissociates from it, decreasing the
protein bound Ca2+ and increasing free plasma Ca2+ producing
hypercalcemia.

of approaches are taken to managing hypercalcemia. The underlying cause
should be treated wherever possible. Intravenous saline may be administered
in dehydrated patients to restore the glomerular filtration rate and enhance
Ca2+ loss and hydration. Drugs, such as frusemide, inhibit renal reabsorption
of Ca2+ and promote its excretion while bisphosphonates lower Ca2+ levels
by inhibiting bone resorption. In very severe cases, dialysis or emergency
parathyroidectomy may be necessary. In some cases, an artefactual
hypocalcemia may be reported when blood samples are erroneously
collected into tubes containing ethylene diaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA). This
anticoagulant is a chelator of Ca2+ and its use will lead to low values for Ca2+
concentrations.
The clinical effects of hypocalcemia include behavioral disturbances,
paresthesiae, tetany, convulsions and cataracts. Its major causes are
renal failure, Mg2+ and vitamin D deficiencies, hypoparathyroidism and
pseudohypoparathyroidism. Chronic renal failure may decrease the
reabsorption of Ca2+ by decreasing the synthesis of calcitriol leading to
hypocalcemia. This may lead to bone disease because the increased
output of PTH arising from the hypocalcemia can increase osteoclast
activity. Magnesium ions are required for PTH secretion and its action
and a deficiency produces hypocalcemia. A deficiency in vitamin D may
arise from a poor diet, malabsorption (Chapters 10 and 11) or inadequate
exposure to sunlight leading to an inadequate absorption of Ca2+ from
food. Hypoparathyroidism, or a reduced activity of the parathyroid
glands with decreased production of PTH, results in hypocalcemia. The
condition can be congenital, where there is an absence of the parathyroid
glands, or acquired hypoparathyroidism that may be idiopathic, or caused
by autoimmune conditions or surgery, for example thyroidectomy. In
pseudohypoparathyroidism, there is excessive PTH secretion because target
tissues fail to respond to the hormone, producing a persistent hypocalcemia.
This condition is more common in males than females and patients present
with skeletal abnormalities including short stature, mental retardation,
cataracts and testicular atrophy.
The investigation of hypocalcemia is outlined in Figure 8.16. The underlying
cause of hypocalcemia should be treated wherever possible. Magnesium
supplements may be prescribed in hypocalcemia due to Mg2+ deficiency,
whereas calcitriol and its precursors may be prescribed in vitamin D deficiency.
Oral Ca2+ supplements are prescribed in mild cases of hypocalcemia.

DISORDERS OF PHOSPHATE HOMEOSTASIS

Phosphate (Pi) combines with Ca2+ to form hydroxyapatite, the mineral
component of bone and teeth and is also required for some enzymic activities,
oxidative phosphorylation and the synthesis of 2,3-bisphosphoglycerate that
regulates the dissociation of oxyhemoglobin (Chapter 13), the excretion of H+
(Chapter 9) and for cell membrane integrity. The daily intake of Pi is about
40 mmol. The kidneys lose approximately 26 mmol daily and 14 mmol are lost
in feces. The total body content of Pi in the average male is over 20 000 mmol
(Figure 8.17) with 17 000 occurring in bone and 3000 in soft tissues, largely
attached to lipids and proteins. Thus about 85% occurs in bone while the ICF
and the ECF contain 15% and 0.1% respectively. The plasma concentration is
about 1 mmol dm‚Äì3. Approximately 80% of the plasma content occurs as free
inorganic Pi, 15% is protein-bound and about 5% is complexed with Ca2+ and
Mg2+. Parathyroid hormone (Figure 8.11) and the hormone, calcitriol, control
the homeostasis of Pi; the former decreasing the reabsorption by the kidneys
and reducing its plasma concentration, the latter stimulating Pi absorption in
the GIT and increasing the concentration.

W^dad\nd[Y^hZVhZ

DISORDERS OF PHOSPHATE HOMEOSTASIS

The reference range for total serum Pi is 0.8‚Äì1.4 mmol dm‚Äì3 but a higher
reference range applies in infancy and childhood. Hyperphosphatemia and
hypophosphatemia are used to describe concentrations above and below the
reference range respectively. Hypophosphatemia causes more damage than
hyperphosphatemia but, fortunately, is less common.
Hyperphosphatemia may cause metastatic calcification, for example the
deposition of calcium phosphate in soft tissues as the excess Pi precipitates
with Ca2+ and causes hypocalcemia and tetany in affected patients. The
commonest cause of hyperphosphatemia is renal failure where the GFR and
Pi excretion decline. Hypoparathyroidism reduces renal excretion of Pi giving
rise to hyperphosphatemia. In diabetic ketoacidosis (Chapter 7), a deficiency
of insulin prevents the uptake of Pi by cells leading to hyperphosphatemia.
Other causes are an increased intake of Pi or its release from damaged cells
in intravascular hemolysis. Indeed, any condition where there is increased
turnover of cells, for example following treatment of malignant disease with
chemotherapy, results in release of Pi during cell destruction. Excessive
intake, either oral or intravenous, is a rare cause and is more likely when
there is also renal failure as in pseudohypoparathyroidism where there is
resistance by the kidneys to PTH that decreases their excretion of Pi. A delay
in the separation of plasma or serum from blood before analysis for Pi or
hemolysis of a blood sample prior to its analysis can indicate artefactual
hyperphosphatemia but this does not reflect the true clinical situation.
A number of biochemical tests are useful when investigating
hyperphosphatemia. These include determining the concentrations of Pi,
Ca2+, urea and creatinine in serum and the concentration of Pi in urine.
The following strategy has proved useful in investigating obscure causes
of hyperphosphatemia. First, it is necessary to exclude artefactual causes.
Secondly, serum concentrations of creatinine and urea should be determined
to exclude renal failure. If the serum concentration of Ca2+ is normal or
above reference values, vitamin D intoxication or untreated diabetes
mellitus should be considered. Thirdly, if the plasma or serum concentration
of Ca2+ is low, then hypoparathyroidism should be investigated. Finally,
if the urinary concentration of Pi is low, then hypoparathyroidism is,
again, a consideration, whereas a high urinary concentration indicates
increased intake, malignancy or intravascular hemolysis. Patients with
hyperphosphatemia are managed by treating the underlying cause wherever
possible. The oral intake of aluminum, Ca2+ and Mg2+ salts may be used as
these can bind Pi in the GIT reducing its absorption.

The clinical features of hypophosphatemia include paresthesiae, ataxia,
coma, osteomalacia and muscle weakness. There may be increased
susceptibility to infection possibly due to defective phagocytosis. The
causes of hypophosphatemia are varied. Vitamin D deficiency results in a
decreased synthesis of calcitriol and therefore decreased Pi absorption in the
GIT. Increased renal loss of Pi may occur in primary hyperparathyroidism
where increased secretion of PTH causes excessive renal loss of Pi. Certain
diuretics that increase renal loss of Pi can cause hypophosphatemia. It may
also occur during the recovery phase of diabetic ketoacidosis when patients
are administered insulin, which promotes cellular uptake of Pi. Total body Pi
may be depleted as a consequence of osmotic diuresis. There are a number
of rare causes of hypophosphatemia. These include an inadequate dietary
intake usually associated with parenteral nutrition, or when agents, such
as aluminum hydroxide are used as antacids and prevent its absorption in
the GIT, and in chronic alcoholics who have a complex and multifactorial
condition with poor diet and reduced GIT absorption (Chapter 11).
Determination of the serum concentrations of Pi and Ca2+ and the urinary
concentration of Pi are useful in investigating hypophosphatemia. The

following strategy may be used when its cause is not obvious. First, exclude
causes such as alkalosis and chronic alcoholism. Secondly, a reduced
urinary Pi suggests decreased dietary or parenteral intakes or increased
cellular uptake, for example in insulin therapy. Thirdly, if the urinary
concentration of Pi is above its reference range then excessive renal losses
are occurring and the concentration of Ca2+ in the plasma or serum should
be determined. If this is increased, then primary hyperparathyroidism
or malignancy may be present. If, however, the concentration is low or
normal, renal defects or inappropriate diuretic therapy are considerations.
Hypophosphatemia should be managed by treating the underlying cause
wherever possible. In some situations it may be necessary to administer
oral or parenteral Pi.

Magnesium intake
15 mmol d

Magnesium is required to maintain the structures of ribosomes, nucleic acids
and numerous proteins and acts as a cofactor for over 300 enzymes, including
those involved in energy metabolism and protein synthesis. It is also required
for normal cell permeability and neuromuscular functions. The usual dietary
intake of Mg2+ is about 15 mmol day‚Äì1 and approximately 30% of this is absorbed
in the GIT, the rest is lost in the feces. The adult human body contains over
1200 mmol of Mg2+ (Figure 8.18). Approximately 750 mmol is found in bone
and about 450 mmol in muscle and soft tissues. The ECF contains only 15
mmol. Approximately 55% of plasma Mg2+ occurs as free ionized Mg2+, 32% is
protein-bound and 13% complexed with Pi or citrate.

Figure 8.18 The distribution of body Mg2+.

The kidneys lose 5 to10 mmol of Mg2+ daily but losses are adjusted to control
Mg2+ homeostasis. An increased dietary intake of Mg2+ results in increased renal
loss and vice versa. This is achieved principally by adjusting the reabsorption
of Mg2+ by cells of the proximal tubules and loop of Henle. A number of
factors influence the rate of excretion of Mg2+ including hypercalcemia and
hypophosphatemia (Section 8.6) that decrease renal reabsorption and PTH,
which stimulates renal retention.
The reference range for serum Mg2+ is 0.8‚Äì1.2 mmol dm‚Äì3. Hypo- and
hypermagnesemia refer to concentrations below and above the reference
range respectively. Note that measurements of the concentration of Mg2+ in
plasma or serum are unreliable indicators of its body status since only 1% of
body Mg2+ occurs in the ECF.
The clinical effects of hypomagnesemia are similar to those seen in hypocalcemia and include tetany, muscle weakness, convulsions and cardiac
arrhythmias. These effects are related to the role of Mg2+ in neuromuscular
function. The causes of hypomagnesemia include decreased intake
as in starvation (Chapter 11), poorly managed parenteral nutrition or
malabsorption. Increased losses of Mg2+ as in osmotic diuresis in diabetics
(Chapter 7), diuretic therapy, hyperaldosteronism and excessive losses
from the GIT in prolonged diarrhea, GIT fistula and laxative abuse can also
cause hypomagnesemia. The use of anticancer drugs (Chapter 17), such as
cisplatinum, can damage the kidneys and prevent the renal reabsorption
of Mg2+. In alcoholism (Chapter 12), hypomagnesemia is believed to occur
due to increased renal excretion, inadequate dietary intake, vomiting and
diarrhea.
In many cases, the cause of hypomagnesemia is determined by clinical
examination. However, measuring the urinary Mg2+ may be useful as
the amount of Mg2+ excreted per day decreases with decreased intake. If
hypomagnesemia occurs with increased renal excretion then losses are likely
to be due to renal damage. Hypercalcemia may increase renal Mg2+ excretion

causing hypomagnesemia but hypocalcemia may occur in hypomagnesemia
due to hypoparathyroidism.

In hypomagnesemia, the underlying cause should be treated wherever
possible. Oral Mg2+ supplements may be adequate for mild cases but severe
Mg2+ deficiency together with malabsorption may require intravenous
infusions of Mg2+.
The clinical effects of hypermagnesemia are also largely related to the role of
Mg2+ in neuromuscular activities and include muscular weakness, respiratory
paralysis and, in very severe cases, cardiac arrest. Acute or chronic renal
failures are the commonest causes of hypermagnesemia; others include
its release from damaged cells from, for example, crush injuries. Mild
hypermagnesemia may occur in mineralocorticoid deficiency, as in Addison‚Äôs
disease. In rare cases, hypermagnesemia may occur from an increased oral
or parenteral intake of Mg2+ or from the use of Mg2+ containing antacids or
laxatives. When this does occur, it is usually combined with renal failure.
The management of hypermagnesemia involves treating the underlying
cause wherever possible. Hypermagnesemia due to renal failure may require
dialysis.

DISORDERS OF URATE METABOLISM

In humans, the end product of the metabolism of the purines, adenine and
guanine is urate (Figure 8.19). There are three sources of purines namely
diet, the breakdown of endogenous nucleotides and nucleic acids and
de novo synthesis. Most dietary nucleic acids are ingested in the form of
nucleoproteins from which urate is produced by the GIT (Chapter 11). The
degradation and de novo synthesis of purines are linked (Figure 8.20). The
body urate pool, and therefore plasma concentration, depends upon the
relative rates of urate formation and excretion. Both the kidneys and the GIT
excrete urate with renal excretion accounting for approximately 66% of the
total. Almost all the urate is filtered at the glomerulus but most is reabsorbed
by the proximal tubule. However, both reabsorption and secretion occur in
the distal tubule, so that the net effect is to excrete about 10% of the urate.
Urate secreted into the GIT is metabolized to CO2 and NH3 by bacterial
action or uricolysis.
The reference range for serum urate is 0.1 to 0.4 mmol dm‚Äì3. However, there
is a wide variation in the concentration of urate in plasma or serum even in
health. Plasma urate concentration tends to be higher in males than females,
is highest in obese individuals, those from affluent social classes and those
with a high protein and alcohol intake. Thus hyperuricemia is defined as a
concentration greater than 0.42 mmol dm‚Äì3 in men and more than 0.36 mmol
dm‚Äì3 in women.
Hyperuricemia may arise as a result of increased production of uric acid
or decreased excretion or both. Excessive synthesis may occur because of
a defective synthetic metabolic pathway, stimulation of de novo purine
synthesis by alcohol or by increased nucleic acid turnover, as in malignant
disease, or the use of cytotoxic drugs. An excessive dietary intake of
purines will also produce hyperuricemia. A decreased urate excretion may
be due to a reduced GFR giving rise to hyperuricemia. Increased proximal
tubular reabsorption and decreased distal tubular secretion of urate have
similar effects. Lactate and A-hydroxybutyrate compete with urate for
excretion by the distal tubule. Therefore lactic acidosis or ketosis (Chapter
7) are often associated with hyperuricemia. Some drugs, for example low
doses of aspirin, can inhibit the distal tubular secretion of urate causing
hyperuricemia.

DISORDERS OF WATER, ELECTROLYTES AND URATE BALANCES

Urate has low solubility and the ECF easily becomes saturated at
concentrations just above the upper limit of the reference range. There
is a tendency for crystalline monosodium urate to form in people with
hyperuricemia, giving rise to gout. Crystals of monosodium urate (Figure
8.21(A)) tend to form in cartilage and synovial fluid of joints and particularly
those of the big toe causing gout (Figure 8.21(B)). The crystals are phagocytosed
by neutrophil leukocytes and may cause damage to lysosomal membranes
within these cells (Chapter 16). As a consequence, lysosomal contents are
released, causing damage to both leukocytes and surrounding tissues with
an associated inflammatory response (Chapter 4). Gout may be primary,
with no known cause, or secondary, as a consequence of another disorder.
Primary gout is characterized by recurrent attacks of arthritis. It is more
common in men than women. The metabolic defect in patients is unknown
but a number of abnormalities may be responsible for the overproduction of
urate and therefore increased urinary urate output. In many patients there is
a combined defect of urate overproduction together with its impaired renal
excretion. Patients with primary gout often have deposits of urate in their soft
tissues and some can develop renal stones composed of urate salts. The risk
that a normal person will develop gout varies with their urate concentration.
The annual incidence of gout in men is low, about 0.1%, when the urate
concentration is less than 0.42 mmol dm‚Äì3. This increases to 0.6% when the
concentration is 0.42‚Äì0.54 mmol dm‚Äì3 and 5% when urate concentrations
are greater than 0.54 mmol dm‚Äì3. The reason for the onset of acute attacks in
gout is unclear since a sharp rise in the concentration of urate is not usually
demonstrable.
Secondary gout is rare but can arise from a number of other disorders including
myeloproliferative disorders (Chapter 17) such as polycythemia vera, where
the hyperuricemia is due to an increased cell turnover, the use of cytotoxic
drug therapy that increases cell destruction and the breakdown of nucleic
acids, and psoriasis with its increased turnover of skin cells.

CASE STUDIES

A diagnosis of gout is made on clinical grounds, a demonstration of hyperuricemia and a satisfactory response to uricosuric drugs. A high plasma urate
concentration does not always mean that the patient has gout, that is high
plasma urate concentration makes the diagnosis of gout more likely, whereas
a consistently low plasma urate concentration excludes the diagnosis. To
confirm diagnosis it is necessary to aspirate the joint fluid during an acute
attack. The finding of urate crystals, 2‚Äì10 ¬µm long and needle shaped, within
neutrophils will confirm the diagnosis.
Anti-inflammatory drugs, such as indomethacin, are used to treat acute
attacks of gout but have no effect on the hyperuricemia which is treated with a
diet low in protein and alcohol. Urate lowering drugs, for example allopurinol,
that prevent the formation of urate and decrease de novo synthesis of purines,
are used in long-term treatment or when plasma urate levels are persistently
higher than 0.6 mmol dm‚Äì3.
Hypouricemia, where the concentration of urate in serum is below the reference
range, is uncommon and not of clinical significance. Its occurrence is due to
a decreased urate synthesis, as in congenital xanthine oxidase deficiency and
severe liver disease, or to increased excretion of urate as seen in renal tubular
disorders, such as the Fanconi syndrome. Hypouricemia may also result from
excessive use of drugs such as allopurinol.

8.10 SUMMARY
It is essential to maintain appropriate levels of water and electrolytes in
the body so that metabolic reactions can function effectively. The stable
environment within the body is maintained by homeostatic mechanisms,
which return levels to normal, following a shift in equilibrium. In addition,
waste products such as urate need to be removed to prevent toxicity. The
kidneys help to maintain the balance of water, electrolytes and waste
products and a number of renal function tests are available to assess their
function in cases of suspected renal failure. Dehydration, possibly as a result
of gastrointestinal disease causing diarrhea and vomiting, is a severe, lifethreatening condition. Disorders of electrolyte balance can involve a lack or
excess of the electrolyte in question. Thus distinct syndromes can occur with
disorders affecting the levels of Na+, K+, Ca2+, Mg2+ and Pi. Disorders of urate
metabolism may result in high levels of urate in the blood, leading to gout
and renal stones, whereas low levels of urate in the blood are rare.

INTRODUCTION

The concentration of hydrogen ions, H+, in the blood is kept within a narrow
reference range to give the blood a pH of approximately 7.4. The body
possesses physiological and biochemical mechanisms that maintain this pH by
removing excess H+ and carbon dioxide produced during metabolism (Figure
9.1). These activities are vital for normal bodily functions and are performed
by the renal and respiratory systems respectively. Failure to maintain the

acid‚Äìbase balance at an appropriate value will give rise either to an acidosis,
with a blood pH below the reference range, or an alkalosis with the pH above
it. Different types of acidoses and alkaloses produce specific characteristic
clinical features. Once a specific acid‚Äìbase disorder has been identified, a
clinical strategy must be adopted to manage the symptoms and to treat the
underlying cause(s).

THE PRODUCTION AND TRANSPORT OF CARBON DIOXIDE

Body tissues produce about 20 moles of CO2 per day during oxidative
metabolism. The CO2 diffuses from the cells into the extracellular fluid (ECF),
that is the blood and tissue fluid, and eventually enters the plasma in quantities
with the potential to form enough carbonic acid to disturb its pH. However,
in normal circumstances this does not occur because the CO2 is transported
to the lungs and excreted. During transport, a substantial proportion of the
CO2 enters the erythrocytes by diffusion. Within the erythrocytes, a small
proportion of the CO2 remains dissolved or combines with proteins, mainly
hemoglobin, to form carbamino compounds:
Protein-NH2 + CO2 s Protein-NH-COO‚Äì + H+
The major portion, however, combines with water to produce carbonic acid in
a reaction catalyzed by carbonic anhydrase (Figure 9.2):

(HCO3‚Äì,

Figure 9.3 shows how H+ are removed from solution when they react with
oxyhemoglobin (HbO8) and promote the release of its oxygen to the tissues
and forms protonated hemoglobin (‚ÄòH+Hb‚Äô). The HCO3‚Äì formed diffuses down
its electrochemical gradient out of the erythrocytes to the plasma in exchange
for Cl‚Äì, thus maintaining the electrochemical equilibrium of the erythrocyte.
The exchange of HCO3‚Äì for Cl‚Äì is normally called the chloride shift. Since both
ions are charged, neither would pass freely across biological membranes,
however, an anion exchanger protein facilitates their transport. This exchanger
is a membrane protein that forms a pore through the membrane allowing the
cotransport of the ions across the membrane. Given that the ions move in
opposite directions, the anion exchanger or cotransporter is said to be an
antiporter. The concentration of HCO3‚Äì in the plasma is normally kept between
21‚Äì28 mmol dm‚Äì3.
In the lungs, the partial pressure of oxygen is high while that of carbon dioxide
is low. Thus oxygen enters the erythrocytes forming oxyhemoglobin, releasing
the bound H+ and promoting the reverse of the events that occur in other body
tissues (Figure 9.3). Thus, H+ associates with HCO3‚Äì to produce carbonic acid
which then breaks down to carbon dioxide and water. The water enters the
large body pool of water while the CO2 leaves the erythrocytes and is excreted
on exhalation.
These events provide an interesting confirmation that enzymes catalyze
reactions in either direction depending upon the position of equilibrium.
Thus carbonic anhydrase promotes the formation of carbonic acid in most
body tissues where the concentration of CO2 is relatively high. However, in the
lungs, where the concentration of CO2 is reduced, the enzyme catalyzes the
formation of CO2 and H2O from carbonic acid.

BUFFERING AND THE EXCRETION OF H+

About 60 mmol of H+ are produced each day from the oxidation of sulfurcontaining amino acid residues or from incomplete metabolic activities, such
as anerobic glucose metabolism or ketone body formation (Chapter 7). If all
the H+ were released into the approximately 14 dm3 of ECF, the concentration
of H+ would be 4 mmol dm‚Äì3 or about 100 000 times more acidic than normal.
In reality, the concentration of H+ is kept within the narrow limits of 40 p 5
nmol dm‚Äì3 to maintain the appropriate body physiological pH of 7.4 ¬± 0.05.
This pH is necessary for normal physiological functions and is maintained by
temporary buffering systems that resist changes to the pH of the plasma until
the excessive H+ are excreted by the kidneys (Chapter 8).
When H+ are released by cells, the ECF is buffered by the hydrogen carbonate‚Äì
carbonic acid buffer system (Box 9.1):
H+ + HCO3‚Äì s H2CO3 s CO2 + H2O
Other buffering systems, such as hemoglobin in the erythrocytes, also make
significant contributions as described in Section 9.2. If the concentrations of
H+ and HCO3‚Äì reach equilibrium, buffering would become ineffective. However,
in the case of the hydrogen carbonate‚Äìcarbonic acid system this is usually
prevented from occurring by the breakdown of carbonic acid to CO2 and
water. The formation of carbonic acid from H+ and HCO3‚Äì is a rapid reaction.
Its potentially slow breakdown to CO2 and H2O is accelerated by carbonic
anhydrase in the erythrocytes and kidneys and the removal of carbon dioxide
at the lungs prevents the system from reaching equilibrium.
Buffering by the hydrogen carbonate‚Äìcarbonic acid system removes H+ from
the ECF but at the expense of HCO3‚Äì. The ECF contains relatively large amounts
of HCO3‚Äì, for example, its concentration is usually about 24 mmol dm‚Äì3. If, for
any reason, the amount of H+ produced increases, then the concentration
of HCO3‚Äì will decrease as the hydrogen carbonate‚Äìcarbonic acid buffering
system operates. Any excess H+ must be excreted from the body by the kidneys

The pH of a solution is deÔ¨Åned as:

above it increase in alkalinity.

A buffered solution is one that resists changes to its pH when
relatively small amounts of acid or alkali are added to it. In

(Chapter 8) to keep the ECF and tissues at an appropriate pH. In addition,
the HCO3‚Äì used in buffering must be regenerated to return its concentration
in the plasma to normal values, otherwise the body will become depleted
of HCO3‚Äì and buffering capacity. Two separate mechanisms operate in the
kidneys to recover the HCO3‚Äì initially removed from the blood by filtration at
the glomerulus and to regenerate that used in buffering. The first mechanism
is the HCO3‚Äì recovery system while the second regenerates the HCO3‚Äì (Figures
9.5 and 9.6).
In health, virtually all of the HCO3‚Äì is reabsorbed from the kidney tubule
lumen. The operation of the system depends upon the tubule cells being
polarized, that is, their luminal and basal surfaces differ in composition and
permeability (Figure 9.5). In this manner, they resemble the enterocytes that
line the absorptive surface of the gastroinstinal tract (Chapter 11). Direct
reabsorption of HCO3‚Äì from the renal tubular fluid cannot occur because the
luminal surfaces of renal tubular cells are impermeable to HCO3‚Äì. However,
the concentration of CO2 within the tubular cells is maintained at a relatively
high value and so carbonic anhydrase catalyzes the formation of carbonic
acid. The acid dissociates to HCO3‚Äì and H+. The continuous formation of
HCO3‚Äì and H+ within the tubule cells is promoted by their removal. The HCO3‚Äì is
transported across the basal membrane of the cell into the interstitial fluid
and then into the capillaries. In contrast, H+ is exchanged for Na+ across the
luminal membrane and enters the lumen of the kidney tubule. A membrane
protein called the sodium bicarbonate cotransporter 1 (NBC 1) present in the
luminal cell membrane facilitates the exchange of ions. Within the lumen,
the H+ combine with HCO3‚Äì to form carbonic acid. The acid breaks down
spontaneously to CO2 and H2O in the proximal tubule, but carbonic anhydrase
activity on the luminal surfaces of the cells speeds up the reaction in the distal
tubule. The CO2 can enter the tubule cell across its luminal membrane and so
the HCO3‚Äì is recovered, indirectly, as CO2. Approximately 80% of the filtered
HCO3‚Äì in the proximal tubule is recovered by this mechanism. However, there

BUFFERING AND THE EXCRETION OF H+

In plasma, H2CO3 breaks down to release carbon dioxide and
water:

usually by combining a weak acid with the salt of that acid. The
pH of these solutions can be calculated using the HendersonHasselbalch equation:

H2CO3 s CO2 + H2O

pH = pKa + log [base] / [acid]

Since the concentration of H2CO3 is directly proportional to the
partial pressure of CO2 (PCO2), it follows that:

It is important to note that buffering is only effective at pH values equal to the pKa ¬± 1.

[H2CO3‚Äì] = PCO2 q 0.225

The buffering systems of the body do not excrete excess H+ but
temporarily remove them from free solution preventing excessive changes in pH. The effect of any H+ produced by the body
is neutralized largely by the hydrogen carbonate‚Äìcarbonic acid
buffer system.

where 0.225 is the solubility constant of CO2. Hence the
Henderson-Hasselbalch equation can be rewritten as:
pH = pKa + log [HCO3‚Äì] / PCO2 q 0.225

For the hydrogen carbonate‚Äìcarbonic acid buffer system:
H

+

It follows that the concentration of H+ is directly proportional
to the ratio, PCO2 / [HCO3‚Äì]. Thus the concentration of H+ in the
blood varies as the concentration of HCO3‚Äì and the PCO2 change:
an increase in H+ occurs when there is an increase in PCO2 or
a decline in HCO3‚Äì; while a decrease in H+ will occur when the
PCO2 decreases or HCO3‚Äì increases.

Therefore:
pH = pKa + log [HCO3‚Äì] / [H2CO3]

has not been a net loss of H+ and the HCO3‚Äì used in buffering has not been
regenerated. The HCO3‚Äì is regenerated when carbonic acid is formed in the
luminal cell as described above (Figure 9.6). Again, H+ are exchanged for Na+
and enter the lumen. Here the H+ react with phosphate (HPO42‚Äì) and ammonia
(NH3) to give H2PO4‚Äì and NH4+ respectively. Ammonia is a significant urinary
buffer produced by the deamination of glutamine in the renal tubular cells
in a reaction catalyzed by glutaminase (Figure 9.7). The ammonia formed
can readily diffuse across cell membranes but NH4+ cannot enter the cells by
passive reabsorption. Thus the NH4+, and the H2PO4‚Äì, are excreted in the urine.
For every H+ excreted as NH4+ and H2PO4‚Äì,a single HCO3‚Äì is formed in the tubule
cell and secreted across the basal surface to the interstitial fluid and then into
the blood. Hence the HCO3‚Äì concentration of the ECF is regenerated.
The synthesis of glutaminase is induced in states of chronic acidosis (Section
9.4) allowing an increase in the production of ammonia and an increased
excretion of H+ as NH4+.

DISORDERS OF ACID‚ÄìBASE BALANCE

9.4

TYPES OF ACID‚ÄìBASE DISORDERS

Disorders of acid‚Äìbase balance are either acidoses or alkaloses. In an acidosis,
there is accumulation of H+ in the blood and its pH falls below the reference
range. In an alkalosis there is a depletion of H+ and therefore the blood has
a pH above its reference range. Acid‚Äìbase disorders can be further divided
into two groups depending on their causes. If the abnormal pH occurs
because of a metabolic or renal dysfunction, it is referred to as a metabolic
acid‚Äìbase disorder. When the abnormal pH is due to lung dysfunction, then
it is a respiratory acid‚Äìbase disorder. Physiological mechanisms that attempt
to return the pH back to values within the reference range are referred to
as compensation. Metabolic disorders cause a change in the concentration
of HCO3‚Äì in the blood but respiratory disorders cause a change in its PCO2
(Table 9.1). In any acid‚Äìbase disorder, the pH of the blood depends on the
severity of the primary disturbance and the amount of compensation that
has occurred.
Margin Note 9.1 Fistula
A Ô¨Åstula is an abnormal passage
from a cavity or tube to another
cavity or free surface.

i

Metabolic acidosis and alkalosis are the results of decreases and increases,
respectively, in the concentration of HCO3‚Äì. These could be caused by the
production of ketone bodies during diabetic ketoacidosis (Chapter 7) or from
the loss of HCO3‚Äì from a duodenal fistula. Respiratory acidosis is associated
with an increased PCO2 whereas respiratory alkalosis occurs when the PCO2 is
decreased. For example, an impairment of respiratory function can increase
the PCO2 in the blood while hyperventilation would decrease it.
Compensation of acid‚Äìbase disorders occurs by two major mechanisms: renal
compensation and respiratory compensation. Renal compensation occurs
when a respiratory disorder impairs lung function. The body attempts to adjust
the pH of blood back to within its reference range by increasing the excretion
of H+ by the kidneys. Respiratory compensation is necessary when there is a
metabolic acid‚Äìbase disorder and involves changes in the ventilation of the
lungs. Renal compensation is a relatively slow mechanism while respiratory
compensation is much quicker to take effect. An acid‚Äìbase disorder is said to
be fully compensated if the compensatory mechanism returns the pH of the
blood back to its reference range. However, compensation is usually partial
and the pH remains outside the reference range.

METABOLIC ACID‚ÄìBASE DISORDERS
Metabolic acid‚Äìbase disorders lead to an accumulation or a loss of H+
resulting in changes in the concentration of HCO3‚Äì in the blood. The direct
loss or gain of HCO3‚Äì will also cause a metabolic acid‚Äìbase disorder. Thus
metabolic disorders are recognized by investigating the concentration of
HCO3‚Äì in the blood. Respiratory compensation occurs quickly, often within
hours, and patients will show some change in blood PCO2 because of hypoor hyperventilation.
Metabolic acidosis may arise from an increase in the amount of H+ formed or
a decrease in the concentration of HCO3‚Äì. Diabetic ketoacidosis (Chapter 7),

TYPES OF ACID‚ÄìBASE DISORDERS

lactic acidosis, poisoning with, for example, salicylate, methanol, ethylene
glycol (Chapter 12) or the condition known as inherited organic acidosis all
increase the production of H+. In contrast, a decreased excretion of H+ as in
renal tubular acidosis, acute and chronic renal failure (Chapter 8), the use of
inhibitors of carbonic anhydrase or a deficiency of mineralocorticoid, such
as aldosterone (Figure 9.8) all increase blood H+ content. Acid ingestion, as in
acid poisoning, the excessive intake of amino acids by infusion, the direct loss
of HCO3‚Äì by diarrhea or a pancreatic fistula can all reduce the concentration of
HCO3‚Äì in the blood.

Figure 9.8 Computer generated model of
aldosterone.

The clinical effects of metabolic acidosis include hyperventilation, where
the increased H+ concentration acts as a rapid and powerful stimulant of
the respiratory center leading to a deep sighing breathing called Kussmaul
respiration. The patients may also present with neuromuscular irritability that
can cause cardiac arrhythmias. Cardiac arrest is more likely in the presence of
hyperkalemia (Chapters 8 and 14). Eventually metabolic acidosis can depress
the activities of the central nervous system and this can progress to coma and
even death. Patients with metabolic acidosis are managed by treating the
underlying cause and this usually resolves the acid‚Äìbase disorder. In severe
cases, the patients may be administered HCO3‚Äì intravenously to correct the
acidosis.
Metabolic alkalosis may occur as a consequence of gastrointestinal loss of H+
following vomiting and gastric aspiration or from excessive renal loss of H+ in
Conn‚Äôs and Cushing‚Äôs syndromes (Chapter 7). Some clinical treatments, such
as the use of carbenoxolone, an anti-inflammatory drug used to treat ulcers,
and thiazide diuretic drugs that reduce blood pressure by promoting the
secretion of urine and by K+ depletion, can also result in this condition. Finally,
the administration of alkali, including alkali ingestion, and inappropriate
treatment for acidosis can also cause metabolic alkalosis.
The clinical effects of metabolic alkalosis include hypoventilation that is a
consequence of the low H+ concentration. It is often accompanied by mental
confusion and eventually coma. Patients may also suffer from paresthesia.
Other effects of metabolic acidosis include tetany and muscle cramps that
arise due to a decrease in the concentration of unbound Ca2+ in the plasma
(Chapter 8) arising from the alkalosis. Metabolic alkalosis is usually managed
by treating its underlying cause.

RESPIRATORY ACID‚ÄìBASE DISORDERS
In respiratory acid‚Äìbase disorders, the primary disturbance is caused by a
change in the partial pressure of arterial CO2. Respiratory disorders are related
to a defect in the rate of ventilation of lungs or the exchange of gases across the
alveolar membrane. The changes in PCO2 (Box 9.1) alter the concentrations of
carbonic acid in the blood, which, in turn, dissociates to HCO3‚Äì and H+.
Some causes of respiratory acidosis are shown in Table 9.2. In general,
obstruction of the airways by disease, or inhibition of the respiratory center in
the brain by disease, trauma or drugs can cause respiratory acidosis.
Respiratory acidosis may be acute or chronic. Acute conditions occur
within minutes or hours. It is usually the low PO2 (hypoxemia) that is more
dangerous than the high PCO2 (hypercapnia). Further, renal compensation is
slow, taking two or three days to become effective, so respiratory acidosis is
usually uncompensated. Alveolar hypoventilation is usually the most common
reason for acute respiratory acidosis. Hypoventilation increases the arterial
PCO2 and so the concentration of H+ also rises quickly. The high PCO2 and
associated low PO2 can cause coma and eventually death if untreated. Causes
of acute respiratory acidosis include choking, bronchopneumonia and acute
exacerbation of asthma.

Table 9.2 Some conditions giving rise to respiratory acidosis

Chronic respiratory acidosis is, again, usually due to a decline in alveolar
ventilation. However, this is normally a well established condition and subject
to maximum renal compensation. Long-standing conditions responsible for
chronic respiratory disorders include chronic bronchitis and emphysema.
The high PCO2 is believed to be responsible for the clinical features of
respiratory acidosis, such as peripheral vasodilatation and headaches. The
acidosis can cause central nervous system depression leading to a coma.
The treatment of respiratory acidosis is to improve alveolar ventilation,
lowering the PCO2 and increasing the PO2. In chronic respiratory acidosis, it
is usually not possible to treat the underlying cause and treatment is aimed at
maximizing alveolar ventilation by using physiotherapy or bronchodilators.
Respiratory alkalosis is less common than respiratory acidosis. However, it is
often an acute condition due to hyperventilation. Often renal compensation
does not occur.
The clinical effects of respiratory alkalosis include confusion, headaches,
dizziness and coma. Respiratory alkalosis may be caused by hypoxia,
increased respiration or pulmonary disease. Hypoxia is associated with high
altitudes, severe anemia and pulmonary disease. Increased respiration may
result from the use of respiratory stimulants, such as salicylates, from primary
hyperventilation syndrome, artificial hyperventilation, and pulmonary
diseases, such as pulmonary edema and embolisms. The treatment of
respiratory alkalosis is aimed at removing its underlying cause as this usually
resolves the acid‚Äìbase disturbance.

MIXED ACID‚ÄìBASE DISORDERS
Sometimes patients may present with more than one acid‚Äìbase disorder and
this is known as a mixed acid‚Äìbase disorder. These may present as (i) severe
acidemia, that is a low blood pH, (ii) with a normal or near normal pH or (iii)
with alkalemia, that is, a high blood pH. Whatever the underlying cause, all
mixed acid‚Äìbase disorders are associated with abnormal levels of blood PCO2
and HCO3‚Äì.
For example, a patient with chronic bronchitis may also have renal failure.
Both these disorders increase the concentration of H+ in the blood. Chronic
bronchitis leads to respiratory acidosis while the renal failure causes metabolic
acidosis. This patient will therefore present with a mixed acid‚Äìbase disorder
with a high blood PCO2 and H+ concentration but a low concentration of
HCO3‚Äì. In some cases, however, the two disorders in a mixed acid‚Äìbase disorder
can be antagonistic, that is, have opposing effects on the concentration of H+
in blood. In this case the blood H+ concentration may be near normal although

'('

W^dad\nd[Y^hZVhZ

INVESTIGATING ACID‚ÄìBASE DISORDERS

the PCO2 and HCO3‚Äì concentration will both be abnormal. For example, a
patient with salicylate poisoning may have a metabolic acidosis together with a
respiratory alkalosis. Patients may also present with metabolic and respiratory
alkaloses. This could occur in someone with congestive cardiac failure who is
on diuretic therapy. The former will cause a respiratory alkalosis and the latter
a metabolic alkalosis. Such individuals will usually have a high blood pH and
increased HCO3‚Äì but the PCO2 will be decreased.

9.5

INVESTIGATING ACID‚ÄìBASE DISORDERS

An investigation of an acid‚Äìbase disorder involves three stages. The first stage
involves identifying whether the patient has an acidosis or an alkalosis. The
second stage is to determine whether the acid‚Äìbase disorder is metabolic or
respiratory in nature while the third stage involves determining the degree of
compensation.
Acid‚Äìbase disorders are investigated as outlined in Figure 9.9. An arterial blood
specimen is collected and its H+ concentration (pH) and PCO2 measured.
The blood must be collected from an artery into a syringe containing an

collection. The concentration of H+ and PCO2 level are measured directly using
an automated analyzer that is also programmed to calculate the corresponding
concentration of HCO3‚Äì (Figure 9.10) according to the Henderson-Hasselbalch
equation. An acidosis or alkalosis can be identified from the pH, that is the
concentration of H+, in the blood. An examination of the levels of PCO2 and
HCO3‚Äì shows whether the identified disorder is metabolic or respiratory in
origin and indicates to what extent compensation is occurring.

SUMMARY

The pH of the blood is maintained at 7.4 within normal limits by physiological
mechanisms that remove the H+ and CO2 produced by metabolism. Excess
CO2 is transported by the blood to the lungs and excreted. In the blood, the
dissolved CO2 is converted to hydrogen carbonate in a reaction catalyzed
by carbonic anhydrase. Buffering systems such as the hydrogen carbonate‚Äì
carbonic acid system and hemoglobin serve to maintain the physiological pH
in health. Acid‚Äìbase disorders result in the blood pH being lower (acidosis) or
higher (alkalosis) than normal. Such disorders may be metabolic or respiratory
in nature and can be fatal if untreated, although there are physiological
mechanisms for at least a partial compensation of the disorder. Treatment of
most acid‚Äìbase disorders involves treatment of the underlying causes.

10.1 INTRODUCTION
Nutrition is concerned with food and how the body uses it. All nutrients must
be ingested, and most of them digested, before they can be assimilated and
used by the body. Carbohydrates, lipids and proteins are nutrients that are
required in comparatively large amounts. Others, such as vitamins, minerals
and trace elements, are also necessary but are required in much smaller
quantities. Water is also necessary to support life. Nutrients have a variety
of metabolic roles and are needed for normal growth, development and the
maintenance of health. The body can make some nutrients from others that
must be supplied in the diet; the former are nonessential, the latter essential
nutrients. Specific daily nutritional requirements are determined by a number
of factors and, indeed, vary throughout the life of any individual. The major
factors concerned include the age, sex, physical activity and the general wellbeing of the person concerned and, in the case of females, menstruation,
pregnancy and lactation. Good nutrition is essential for health and the
prevention of diseases. Nutritional disorders may arise from a deficiency or,
in some cases, an excess of some component of the diet.

Figure 10.1 Overview of the general roles of
nutrients.

Food is obviously needed to sustain life but a balanced diet is vital for good
health. General evidence for good nutrition is a well developed body with an
ideal weight (Section 10.3), good skin, including hair, and muscle tone, and
physical and mental alertness. The food eaten by an individual constitutes the
diet and it should supply appropriate amounts and proportions of a variety
of substances, usually called nutrients. Some nutrients, the macronutrients,
such as carbohydrates, lipids and proteins, are required in amounts that are
large compared with the micronutrients, such as vitamins, minerals and
trace elements, which are needed in much smaller quantities. Nutrients
are needed to sustain a number of activities within the body if good health
is to be maintained. They supply the raw materials required for growth and
maintenance of tissues, include substances that help regulate metabolism,
for example the cofactors and coenzymes necessary for enzyme activities
and provide the energy to drive metabolism and maintain homeothermy.
Nutrients vary in their contributions to these roles and there is also overlap
between their contributions to each (Figure 10.1).

NUTRIENTS AND ENERGY
Diets are often described in terms of their energy content, despite the fact
that they need to supply materials for needs other than just their energy
provision (Figure 10.1). It is possible for a diet to supply an adequate amount
of energy but be deficient in some essential raw materials, such as vitamins
and minerals needed by the individual. A balanced diet is one that supplies
adequate energy distributed appropriately between carbohydrates, lipids,
and proteins and contains the necessary amounts of vitamins, minerals, trace
elements, water and nondigestible fiber.
Nutritional energy is usually measured in joules or kilojoules. The number of
joules required by any one person needs to be matched to their energy output
(Table 10.1). The term recommended daily amount (RDA) was originally used
by the UK Department of Health in 1979 to define the amounts of certain
nutrients needed by different groups within the population.

Unfortunately, RDAs were often used inappropriately to assess the dietary
needs of individuals. Accordingly, in 1991, they were replaced with dietary
reference values (DRVs) that are guidance values as to the amounts of energy
and nutrients that should be ingested, rather than exact recommendations.
Dietary reference values indicate the amount of energy or amount of an
individual nutrient required by a group of a certain age range and sex for good
health. The value of any DRV is given as a daily intake. However, in practice
DRVs must be determined from the energy and nutrient intakes averaged
from several days eating, because food intake and appetite vary from day to
day. Groups for which DRVs have been set include seven groups of infants of
both sexes from birth to age 10 years, four groups each for males and females
between the ages of 11 and 50-plus, with extra groups for women who are
pregnant or are lactating. The value of a DRV applies to healthy people, since
patients who are unwell for whatever reason may have differing nutritional
requirements. Dietary terms that are related to DRVs are the estimated average
requirement (EAR), reference nutrient intake (RNI) and lower reference
nutrient intake (LRNI). The EAR is the mean amount of energy or nutrient
needed by a population, while the RNI is an amount of a nutrient that is
greater than the dietary needs of 97.5% of that group. The LRNI is the amount
of a nutrient sufficient to meet the requirements of 2.5% of a population. Note
that most people will need more than the LRNI. Figure 10.2 shows how EAR,
RNI and LRNI are related. Finally, the safe intake is the amount judged to be
sufficient for the needs of most people and anything below this level could
be undesirable. This arbitrary value is given when there is simply insufficient
evidence to establish reliable values for EAR, RNI or LRNI.

CARBOHYDRATES
Carbohydrates have the general formula (CH2O)n. The main dietary
carbohydrates (Figure 10.3) are mono- and disaccharide sugars, for example
fructose, glucose, lactose and sucrose, and polysaccharides, mainly starch,
and these are usually the major suppliers of energy. Current recommendations
from the WHO suggest that 55% of dietary energy should be in the form of
carbohydrates. Most of the carbohydrates should be in the form of starch with
no more than 10‚Äì15% of energy intake in the form of sugars. However, dietary
fiber or roughage largely consists of cellulose, a polysaccharide that cannot
be digested and absorbed, although it may be metabolized by bacteria in the
large intestine (Chapter 11). Foods rich in fiber include wholemeal cereals,
flour, root vegetables, nuts and fruits. Dietary fiber stimulates peristalsis and
protects against constipation and is known to reduce blood cholesterol and
glucose and the incidence of colorectal cancers (Chapter 17). Communities
that consume high fiber diets have relatively low incidences of these cancers.

LIPIDS
Dietary lipids are the fats and oils, both of which contain fatty acids that are
concentrated sources of energy. Fats are also needed as carriers for the fatsoluble vitamins A, D, E and K. Fatty acids may be saturated or unsaturated, that
is, they lack or contain double bonds respectively. The only difference between
fats and oils is in their melting points which are related to their degree of
unsaturation and chain length: oils are liquid at room temperatures, indicating
a higher degree of unsaturation than fats which are solid at these temperatures.
Dietary fats (Figure 10.3) consist largely of triacylglycerols together with small
amounts of phospholipids and cholesterol. The WHO has recommended that
total fats should not supply more than 30% of the energy intake of the diet.

Essential fatty acids
Humans lack the enzymes necessary for synthesizing certain unsaturated
fatty acids necessary for health and these are essential fatty acids (EFAs).

DIET AND DISEASE

A number of fatty acids cannot be synthesized by the body including linoleic,
linolenic and arachidonic acid (Figure 10.4) and are precursors of many
biologically active and clinically relevant molecules, such as the eicosanoids
(prostaglandins, thromboxanes, prostacyclins and leukotrienes). These
molecules act like hormones and mediate a wide range of physiological
activities affecting, for example inflammatory responses, blood pressure and
clotting, reproductive activities and the sleep‚Äìwake cycle. Their actions are
local, affecting only cells near their sites of production, and they act at low
concentrations via second messengers (Chapter 7).
Humans, like all mammals, lack the enzymes needed to form a double bond
beyond C-9 or within the terminal seven carbon atoms of a fatty acid (Figure
10.5). Rather than the strict chemical convention of numbering carbon atoms
in fatty acids from the carboxyl group, the double bonds in fatty acids are often
numbered from the terminal or V carbon atom, giving rise to three families
of fatty acids with their first double bond occurring at positions V-3, V-6 and
V-9. These three families cannot be metabolically interconverted. The term
omega fatty acid has entered everyday English and the structures of a number
of examples are shown in Figure 10.6. Linoleic acid is an V-6 acid. Two forms of
linolenic acid occur, a V-3 type called @ linolenic acid (ALA) and the V-6 form,
F linolenic acid (GLA). Other V-3 EFAs are eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and

docosahexaenoic acid (DHA). Omega-3 and V-6 fatty acids are EFAs because
they are not synthesized by the body but must be obtained in the diet. Seeds
and vegetable oils are excellent dietary sources of V-6 EFAs and the body is
able to convert linoleic acid to GLA and arachidonic acid. Many vegetable
oils contain only low amounts of ALA since this is normally present in the
chloroplasts of plants and may only be a significant dietary constituent if
green leafy vegetables are consumed. However, ALA can be used to synthesize
EPA and DHA by body tissues. Rich sources of the V-3 EFAs, EPA and DHA are
in the oils from the muscles and skins of a number of cold deepwater fishes,
such as herring, mackerel, salmon, sardines and tuna (Figure 10.7). Cod, which
live in similar environments, store fat in the liver: hence cod liver oil is also an
excellent source of EPA and DHA.

A dietary deficiency of EFAs leads to a dry scaly skin subject to erythema,
poor healing of wounds and hair loss and a failure to thrive in infants. The
first associations between V fatty acids and health came from studying
Greenland Inuit (Eskimo) and inhabitants of fishing villages in Japan and
people of Okinawa. These groups have much lower incidences of diseases,
such as coronary heart disease (CHD, Chapter 14), rheumatoid arthritis
(Chapters 5 and 18) and diabetes mellitus (Chapter 7), than their European
or USA counterparts, even though their diets are high in fat from eating seal
and fish. However, these organisms are rich in V-3 fatty acids that have been
shown subsequently to provide significant health benefits. The metabolites
of V-3 fatty acids decrease platelet function, reduce the risk from sudden
death caused by cardiac arrhythmias and slow the progress of atherosclerosis.
Modest decreases in blood pressure also occur with high intakes of V-3 fatty
acids. Some studies have indicated that V-3 fatty acids inhibit the synthesis
of very low density lipoprotein (VLDL) and triacylglycerols (TAGs) and so
decrease their concentration in plasma, particularly in patients suffering
from hypertriglyceridemia (Chapters 13 and 14). Furthermore, they have
been associated with reducing morning stiffness and the number of tender
joints in patients with rheumatoid arthritis. There is, however, no established
recommended daily intake for V-3s although it has been suggested that 1‚Äì2%
of the total daily energy intake should be in the form of EFAs. Human adults
are thought to require up to 10 g of linolenic acid daily.
The eicosanoids formed from V-6 fatty acids, although produced by many
of the same enzymes as those from V-3 acids, have different physiological
functions and effects. For example, the V-3 group is antithrombic and antiinflammatory, both processes promoted by V-6 acid derived metabolites.
Thus a balancing of the intakes of V-3 and V-6 fatty acids in the diet is
thought to be of importance. The diet typical of the developed world is
far richer in V-6 than V-3 fatty acids; it has been suggested that ratios of

V-3:V-6 of 2:1 or 1:1 are a healthier balance. The American Heart Association
and the UK Food Standards Agency recommends that people without a history
of CHD should consume two servings of fish weekly and those with known
CHD should eat one serving of fish daily. More than these amounts are not
recommended because, unfortunately, significant amounts of environmental
contaminants, such as methylmercury, polychlorinated biphenyls and
dioxins, are concentrated in some species of fish. For the same reason, young
children and women who may become pregnant, who are pregnant or who
are breastfeeding should avoid eating excessive amounts of fish and shellfish.
Omega-3 fatty acids exert a dose related effect on bleeding time and it has
been suggested that care be applied to their excessive intake, particularly
when combined with anticoagulant medications, such as warfarin or heparin
(Chapter 13). In general, however, their ingestion is well tolerated, although
side effects can include a fishy aftertaste and gastrointestinal tract (GIT)
disturbances, for example nausea, bloating, belching, all of which appear to
be dose dependent.

Dietary proteins (Figure 10.3) are necessary to supply the amino acids needed
for growth and the general repair and maintenance of tissues. A daily intake
of about 65 g and 50 g of dietary protein is required in males and females
respectively, which provides about 10‚Äì15% of the total energy in a balanced
diet, although only about 5% of body energy comes from their catabolism
under normal circumstances. Protein must be obtained from a variety of
sources to supply all essential amino acids. Humans are unable to synthesize
nine of the 20 amino acids found in proteins that have codons in the genetic
code and these are therefore essential dietary constituents (Table 10.2).
However, the nonessential amino acids can be synthesized if the supply of the
essential ones is adequate. The ‚Äòquality‚Äô of dietary protein is important and
protein intake needs to be varied, particularly as some plant proteins lack one
or more of the essential amino acids.

Water is vital for life because it helps stabilize the structures of large molecules,
such as proteins and starch, functions as a medium for most biochemical
reactions, acts as a solvent for electrolytes, glucose, vitamins, minerals and
numerous other small molecules and transports nutrients to, and waste
products away from, cells as well as around the whole body. The GIT (Chapter
11) secretes some 7‚Äì9 dm3 of water that aids the digestion and absorption of
nutrients. To maintain these functions, loss of body water should match intake
to ensure water balance (Chapter 8). It is recommended that two to three dm3
of water should be consumed daily, of which about 60% should be liquid water
and the rest obtained from seemingly solid foods. The homeostasis of water
has been described in Chapter 8.

VITAMINS
Vitamins are organic substances that the body cannot synthesize or can make
only from chemically closely related compounds. They are needed in the diet
but only in relatively small amounts (Table 10.3).
Vitamins may be classified as water soluble, such as the B group and vitamin C
(Figure 10.9) and fat soluble, such as the vitamins A, D, E and K. Some of the B
vitamins and, in general, each fat soluble vitamin comprise a group of closely
related compounds called vitamers. In such cases, the name of the vitamin is
used as a collective descriptor. Vitamins have specific biochemical roles and
are essential for normal metabolism, growth and good health.

Vitamin B1 or thiamin is an essential component of the coenzyme or prosthetic
group, thiamin pyrophosphate (TPP, Figure 10.10). This is necessary for the
actions of some enzymes, for example transketolase activity of the pentose
phosphate pathway for oxidizing glucose and oxidative decarboxylations
catalyzed by pyruvate and 2-oxoglutarate dehydrogenases in carbohydrate
metabolism. Thiamin is therefore necessary for the metabolic formation of ATP,
the major energy carrier in metabolism, and NADPH. Thiamin pyrophosphate
is also known to function in nerve conductance. Vitamin B2 or riboflavin is
also required to form coenzymes or prosthetic groups, in this case flavin
mononucleotide (FMN, Figure 10.11 (A)) and flavin dinucleotide (FAD, Figure
10.11 (B)), which function as electron carriers in flavoproteins. The flavoproteins
are extremely numerous and include renal L-amino acid oxidase, NADH
reductase, 2-hydroxyacid oxidase (FMN) and D- and L-amino acid oxidases,
succinate dehydrogenase and glutathione reductases (FAD). Hence riboflavin
is essential to many oxidation and reduction reactions in, for example, the TCA
cycle, electron transport and the oxidation of fatty acids in mitochondria.

Nicotinic acid and nicotinamide are vitamers of niacin, which strictly is not

are electron and hydrogen carriers. The former is crucial in electron transport
associated with oxidative phosphorylation and ATP formation, the reduced
form of NADPH is essential to the biosynthesis of, for example sugars, lipids,
amino acids and nucleotides.
Vitamin B5 or pantothenic acid is an essential part of coenzyme A (Figure 10.13),
which is the major carrier of metabolically active acyl (fatty acid residues)
in metabolism. Thus it is essential to many of the reactions involved in the
oxidation of lipids and in the synthesis of lipids including steroid hormones,
some neurotransmitters and hemoglobin.
The vitamers pyridoxine, pyridoxal and pyridoxamine all have vitamin B6
activity (Figure 10.14), forming pyridoxal 5-phosphate, which is a cofactor for a
number of enzymes. These include glutamate decarboxylase that catalyzes the
formation of F aminobutyric acid, a neurotransmitter of the central nervous
system, and enzymes that catalyze transamination and decarboxylation
reactions of amino acids. Vitamin B6 is therefore essential for the synthesis
of nonessential amino acids and in the catabolism of amino acids. Pyridoxal
5-phosphate is also a cofactor for glycogen phosphorylase of liver and muscle
tissues and helps regulate the actions of steroid hormones (Chapter 7) by
participating in the dissociation of hormone‚Äìreceptor complexes from DNA.

DIET AND DISEASE

Vitamin B12 or cobalamin is an unusual molecule in that it contains an
organometallic bond between cobalt and carbon (Figure 13.18 (A)). A close
relationship exists between the functions of vitamin B12 and folic acid and,
to some extent at least, they depend on each other for activation. Organic
one carbon groups, for example methyl (CH3‚Äì), methylene (‚ÄìCH2-), methenyl
(‚ÄìCH=), formyl (‚ÄìCHO), formate (‚ÄìCOO‚Äì) and formino (‚ÄìCHNH), are generally
toxic. In metabolism, they are bound to carriers derived from vitamin B12 and
folic acid, which allows them to be converted to different oxidation states and
used in a variety of different reactions in a nontoxic manner. These reactions
are necessary for the catabolism of some amino acids, for the formation of
a number of proteins and the synthesis of purine and pyrimidine bases and
therefore nucleotides and nucleic acids. Unlike vitamin B12 and folic acid that
carry organic one carbon compounds, vitamin H or biotin (Figure 10.15) is
required to form the prosthetic group that carries CO2 in a number of enzymes.
These include acetyl CoA carboxylase and pyruvate decarboxylase which are
key enzymes of fatty acid synthesis and gluconeogenesis, the production of
glucose from noncarbohydrate precursors.
Vitamin C or ascorbic acid (Figure 10.16) is required to reduce metal ions in a
number of enzymes following catalysis. Prolyl and lysyl hydroxylases contain
Fe2+(II) which is oxidized to Fe3+(III) during hydroxylation reactions involved
in cross-linking collagen molecules, which adds strength to connective
tissues. Ascorbate reduces their iron back to the ferrous state, regenerating
an active enzyme. Similarly, the Cu2+(II) in enzymes involved in synthesis of
catecholamine hormones (Chapter 7) is returned to the Cu+(I) state following
the oxidation of the copper during catalysis. The antioxidant properties of
ascorbic acid, in association with vitamin E, help protect lipids in the cell
membranes and blood lipoproteins from oxidative damage. It also enhances
the absorption of iron and regulates the absorption of copper from the GIT.
Several vitamers, retinol, retinaldehyde or retinal and retinoic acid, show
vitamin A activities. Retinol (Figure 10.17 (A)) can be metabolically converted
to retinaldehyde, which, in turn can be oxidized to retinoic acid. In addition,
the provitamin A carotenoids, for example A carotene (Figure 10.17 (B)),
can be converted to active forms in the liver. Retinoic acid helps regulate
the proliferation and development of cells in a tissue specific manner that
resembles the actions of steroid hormones (Chapter 7). It binds to nuclear
receptors, which then interact with DNA and activate specific genes. Vitamin
A is associated with the development of epithelial cells, such as the skin and
the mucosal membranes that cover internal and external surfaces of the
body and have numerous functions, for example, as structural barriers that

prevent microorganisms from entering the body (Chapter 4). Retinaldehyde is
necessary for vision and functions as the prosthetic group (visual pigments) of
opsin proteins in light-sensitive retinal cells. Vitamin A is a weak antioxidant
that can protect against free radical damage. There is some evidence that A
carotene reduces the incidence of cardiovascular disease and some forms of
cancer.

The usual dietary form of vitamin D is cholecalciferol (Figure 10.18), although
this is not strictly a vitamin since it can be formed by ultraviolet irradiation
of the skin from 7-dehydrocholesterol. Foods are sometimes fortified with
the synthetic ergocalciferol, which has the same biological activity as
cholecalciferol. Enzyme-catalyzed hydroxylations yield the active metabolites
1@, 25 dihydroxycholecalciferol (Chapter 8) and calcitriol respectively. Vitamin
D mainly functions in the homeostasis of calcium as described in Chapter 8.
Vitamin E is generally used to describe the tocopherols and tocotrienols that
comprise a number of vitamers of differing biological potencies, of which
the most active is @ tocopherol (Figure 10.19 (A) and (B)). Like vitamins A
and D, vitamin E also has a role in regulating gene expression, although a
receptor has yet to be found, and also in signal transduction. A major function
generally ascribed to vitamin E is to protect cellular membranes against
free radicals (described in Chapters 12 and 18) and prevent the oxidation of
plasma lipoproteins, especially low density lipoproteins (Chapter 14). The
corresponding reduction of the vitamin produces a relatively unreactive and
therefore less damaging tocopheroxyl radical. This is also relatively long lived
and so persists sufficiently long to be reoxidized back to the active form by
vitamin C or glutathione peroxidases. However, the utility of this mechanism
has been challenged and it has been suggested that the antioxidant role is more
restricted and arises from an inhibition of NADPH oxidase and so reduces the
production of radicals, such as superoxide.

A number of compounds are possible vitamers of vitamin K, including
phylloquinone and the menaquinones. The first is the normal dietary source,
while the menaquinones are a group of compounds with similar structures
synthesized by GIT bacteria. Phylloquinone (Figure 10.20) is metabolically
necessary for the conversion of glutamate residues in some proteins to F
carboxyglutamates. This is necessary for the synthesis of some blood clotting
factors, which are described in Chapter 13, and some proteins of the bone
matrix. The ability of menaquinones to function as vitamin K is unclear;
they may partially satisfy the human requirements for vitamin K but their
contribution is probably much less than previously thought.

than 100 mg per day and are provided by a variety of foods (Table 10.4).
Both groups have diverse functions. Minerals play roles in promoting growth
and are important constituents of body tissues such as bone, teeth, hair, skin
and nails, and as cofactors in some enzymes and other proteins. Sodium,
potassium and chloride are required to maintain the electrolyte and osmotic
composition of intra- and extracellular fluids, generate electrochemical
gradients across plasma membranes and for nerve conductance and muscle
contraction. Calcium is an essential component of bone and teeth, is required
for muscle contraction and is a second messenger for some hormones and
neurotransmitters. Magnesium is a cofactor for many enzymes, especially
those utilizing nucleotides involved in energy metabolism and nucleic acid
synthesis. Like calcium, phosphate is needed for bone and teeth formation
and is also a component of nucleic acids and phospholipids. It activates a
number of enzymes, especially some involved in energy metabolism and is

an important renal buffer. Sulfate is required for the synthesis of cartilage and
other components of the extracellular matrix.
Compared with minerals, trace elements are required in much smaller
quantities, but like them are supplied by a variety of foods (Table 10.5). Trace
elements include iron, cobalt, copper, molybdenum, chromium, manganese,
zinc, selenium, iodide and fluoride. They are present in the body at
concentrations less than 100 parts per million and are required in milligrams
or even micrograms per day and a number are toxic in excess.
Trace elements have specific and diverse functions. Chromium helps maintain
blood glucose concentration by acting as a cofactor for insulin activity. The
role of cobalt as a component of vitamin B12, has already been mentioned.
Copper is also an essential cofactor for a number of enzymes, including those
involved in collagen and elastin synthesis and some redox proteins. Copper is
also required for iron absorption and metabolism and hemoglobin synthesis.
Fluoride is necessary for the ‚Äòhardening‚Äô of bone and teeth. All the thyroid
hormones contain iodine as described in Chapter 7. Iron is a component of
the prosthetic group, heme found in hemoglobin and myoglobin, where it
maintains its oxidation state and binds a dioxygen molecule. Iron is also found
in the heme of cytochromes and in nonheme iron proteins involved in electron
transfer, where, of course, its oxidation state does alter. Manganese is essential
for the activities of a number of enzymes. For example, pyruvate carboxylase and
phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase function in gluconeogenesis; arginase is a
key enzyme of the urea cycle that detoxifies ammonia produced during amino
acid metabolism and superoxide dismutase is a major antioxidant defence.
Enzymes that contain molybdenum are common and catalyze several reactions
in purine metabolism, for example xanthine oxidase, and maintains the
synthesis of sex hormones. Selenium is a cofactor in, for example, glutathione
peroxidases, and zinc in carbonic anhydrase and RNA polymerase.

DIET AND DISEASE

BOX 10.1 Inherited disorders of copper metabolism
Menkes or kinky hair disease is a neurodegenerative disease of
impaired copper transport that results in extreme tissue copper
deÔ¨Åciency and was Ô¨Årst described in 1962. It is a sex-linked
inherited disorder that only affects male children (Chapter
15). Babies born with classic Menkes disease appear normal at
birth and symptoms typically begin about three months later.
The disease is characterized by a failure to thrive, psychomotor
deterioration, seizures, hypothermia and strikingly peculiar hair,
which is characteristically kinky, stubby, tangled, sparse or steely
and easily broken and is often white, ivory or gray colored. Brain
problems, such as blood clots at the base of the brain (subdural
hematoma) and/or rupture or thrombosis of arteries in the brain
may occur. Recurrent respiratory and urinary tract infections
are common and weakened bones (osteoporosis) may result in
fractures. Menkes disease has an incidence of 1 in 50 000 to
250 000.
The condition arises from mutations in the ATP7A gene found on
the X chromosome, the product of which is a copper transporting
adenosine triphosphatase (ATPase). Transport of dietary copper
from intestinal cells is impaired, leading to the low serum copper
levels and poor incorporation of copper into cuproproteins.
Copper accumulates in excessive amounts in the liver, but is
deÔ¨Åcient in most other tissues and impairs the functions of a
number of essential enzymes, including tyrosinase, monoamine
oxidase, cytochrome c oxidase, lysyl oxidase and ascorbic acid
oxidase. Low activities of tyrosinase leads to depigmentation of

Margin Note 10.2 Kwashiorkor in
the developed world

i

Kwashiorkor is rarely seen in
developed countries except in
neglected children, the very elderly
or as a consequence of nutritional
ignorance. For example, cases of
kwashiorkor have been reported
in the USA in a small number of
children fed somewhat idiosyncratic
diets. Most of these cases were not
associated with poverty and about
half were associated with perceived
or presumed food allergies. A
signiÔ¨Åcant portion of the food of
some of these children was ricebased beverages, popularly referred
to as ‚Äòrice milk‚Äô, which contain less
than half the amount of protein of
breast milk. Other patients were fed
brown rice emulsion, goat‚Äôs milk or
atole, a liquid emulsion of barley,
water, and sugar.

hair, while monoamine oxidase results in kinky hair. Impaired
lysyl oxidase leads to defects in elastin and collagen, resulting
in vascular weaknesses and cytochrome c oxidase malfunction
results in hypothermia. A defective ascorbate oxidase leads to
skeletal demineralization and osteoporosis.
A diagnosis of Menkes disease in neonates could be based on
high concentrations of copper levels in the placenta. However,
this would be unusual, given a general absence of signs and
symptoms at this age. After six weeks, low serum levels of copper
and the copper binding protein, ceruloplasmin, are indicative of
the condition. A microscopic examination of hair samples shows
characteristic Menkes abnormalities and a skin biopsy can be
used to assess copper metabolism. There is no effective treatment
for Menkes disease and prognosis is poor. Milder forms of the
disease respond to intramuscular injections of copper, but the
severe form does not show much change. Other treatments are
focused on relieving the symptoms. Most patients die within the
Ô¨Årst decade of life, however, survival to the late 20s has been
reported. Genetic screening of the individual‚Äôs family can identify
carriers and provide guidance for counseling on recurrence
risks.
Wilson‚Äôs disease is characterized by an excessive accumulation
of copper, although patients have normal or even low
concentrations of copper in their blood and increased urinary
excretion, and was Ô¨Årst described in 1912. It is an autosomal

10.3 NUTRITIONAL DISORDERS
Nutritional disorders can arise from a deficiency or excess of nutrients and
may affect growth or cause specific diseases and even death. They are proving
to be major health issues. Nutritional disorders can arise from an inadequate
intake of food, such as protein-energy malnutrition, or an excessive intake,
for example obesity, or due to an inadequate amount of a specific dietary
nutrient, such as scurvy in vitamin C deficiency.

PROTEIN-ENERGY MALNUTRITION
Protein-energy malnutrition (PEM) is the name for a spectrum of disorders
that arise due to lack of food. Despite the name, affected individuals may not
be suffering from a lack of protein, however, because of their deficiency of
total energy, dietary proteins that would normally be used for tissue repair or
growth are used as a fuel. In addition, vitamin and mineral intakes are usually
inadequate. In the developed world, PEM is rare and is usually associated with
solitary elderly patients who are malnourished or with children suffering from
neglect. The clinical features of PEM vary depending upon the severity, from
the merely underweight to two major conditions, marasmus and kwashiorkor
(Margin Note 10.2 and Table 10.6). Protein-energy malnutrition can also be life
threatening in that it increases susceptibility to infectious diseases that would
not normally be lethal.
Marasmus is a chronic disorder that develops over a period of months to
years and is caused by an inadequate energy intake (Figure 10.21). It occurs

W^dad\nd[Y^hZVhZ

NUTRITIONAL DISORDERS

recessive condition caused by mutations to the ATP7B gene
located on chromosome 13 that, like ATP7A, encodes a
copper transporting ATPase. Indeed, the two proteins are
55% homologous in amino acid sequence. However, ATP7A
is predominantly expressed in the placenta, GIT and blood‚Äì
brain barrier, ATP7B expression is mainly hepatic. In contrast
to ATP7A, mutations lead to an accumulation of copper in
the liver and brain and damage to other tissues also. The Ô¨Årst
symptoms shown by about 50% of patients with Wilson‚Äôs
disease are swelling and tenderness of the liver and sometimes
fever; this resembles more common disorders, such as viral
hepatitis. Abnormal levels of circulating liver enzyme activities
can indicate serious liver damage, which can progress to
cirrhosis. Other symptoms may include jaundice, abdominal
swelling and abdominal pain. An extremely severe hepatitis
called fulminant hepatitis may occur in about 5% of patients
with jaundice, Ô¨Çuid leaking into the abdomen, low blood
protein content and clotting abnormalities, swelling of the
brain and damage to erythrocytes causing hemolytic anemia.
There may also be difÔ¨Åculties with speech, swallowing and
coordination resulting in trembling, an unsteady walk and
writing problems. A characteristic brown pigmentation
in the cornea of the eye, called Kayser-Fleischer rings may
occur. Decreased renal functions and osteoporosis may occur
prematurely in some patients. Associated psychiatric problems
include severe insomnia, poor concentration, depression and

suicidal impulses. Wilson‚Äôs disease, though more common than
Menkes disease, is still rare with an incidence of 1 in 30 000.
Wilson‚Äôs disease is diagnosed by a combination of blood and
urine tests, eye examination and liver biopsy. A decrease in serum
ceruloplasmin is seen in 95% of patients and an increased urinary
excretion of copper is present in most, but not all, symptomatic
patients. Kayser-Fleischer rings are visible with a slit-lamp
examination performed by an optometrist or ophthalmologist
in about 50% of patients presenting with liver disease. The
deÔ¨Ånitive test is the demonstration of a high copper content in
liver tissue obtained by biopsy.
Long-term maintenance therapy of Wilson‚Äôs disease is possible
with D-penicillamine, trientine or zinc treatments. Penicillamine
and trientine chelates copper, leading to an increased urinary
excretion and reduced tissue levels. Zinc, with vitamin B6
(pyridoxine) supplements, reduces copper absorption and
promotes its loss from the GIT. Foods high in copper, such as
shellÔ¨Åsh, nuts, liver, chocolate and mushrooms should be avoided,
as should alcohol. Medical therapies must be continued for life.
Patients with acute liver failure or those with advanced liver disease
who do not respond to medical therapy should be considered
for liver transplantation, which effectively cures the condition
and results in long-term survival of approximately 80%. Genetic
testing can be used to assist counseling and to screen siblings of
an identiÔ¨Åed patient.

South America, and in patients with long-term illnesses, such as chronic
pulmonary disease and anorexia nervosa (see later). Children with marasmus
fail to thrive, are emaciated and lack subcutaneous fat. Cachexia, muscle
wastage associated with some chronic infections, such as tuberculosis
(Chapter 4), or the severe and prolonged weight loss seen in some cancers
(Chapter 17) produces similar clinical features to marasmus but the etiologies
are different.
The name, kwashiorkor is derived from one of the Kwa languages of Ghana

Margin Note 10.3 BMI and IBW

i

The generally accepted way to assess
the weight of patients is to determine
their body mass index (BMI) where
BMI = weight (kg) / height (m)2
Health risks associated with weight
are lowest for a BMI of 20‚Äì25 kg
m‚Äì2. A BMI of less than 18.5 kg m‚Äì2
is underweight, one of greater than
30 kg m‚Äì2 is deÔ¨Åned as obese. Ideal
body weight (IBW) is another index
that can be useful in assessing the
nutritional status of a patient. This
index is deÔ¨Åned differently for men
and women. The IBW of a man 5 feet
tall is 106 pounds and this increases
by an additional six pounds for each
inch over the height of 5 feet. For a
woman, the IBW at 5 feet tall is 100
pounds and this increases by Ô¨Åve
extra pounds for each additional inch.

DIET AND DISEASE

is common in parts of the world affected by famine and where there is
poor education and knowledge of nutrition. In the original description of
kwashiorkor in children of the Gambia reported in 1932, Williams (1894‚Äì
1992) implied that a deficiency of protein was its major cause, even when
the energy input was adequate. Since then, a number of explanations for the
development of kwashiorkor have been proposed. Environmental toxins,
such as aflatoxins from moldy foods, general conditions of overcrowding and
poverty, a lack of other key nutrients and high rates of disease have all been
implicated. A combined protein and energy deficiency, although important,
is not the key factor and it is generally accepted that the condition is likely to
be due to deficiency of one of several nutrients, including copper, selenium,
zinc and the vitamins folic acid, C, A, A carotene and E that are associated
with oxidative stress management. It is likely that infectious diseases are
the precipitating factor because children with reduced antioxidant status
exposed to the stress of an infection are most liable to develop kwashiorkor.
Further, kwashiorkor usually occurs following infectious conditions, such
as diarrhea, or diseases, for example measles, indicating that its causes
are not purely nutritional. Invading pathogens trigger a macrophage
respiratory burst (Chapters 4 and 5) that considerably increases the total free
radical load of the patient and this may be the start of events that result in
kwashiorkor. Unfortunately, its causes are still not fully known; siblings in
the same household and on the same type of diet may develop marasmus
or kwashiorkor. However, lower concentrations of the antioxidants A
carotene, glutathione and vitamin E are observed in children suffering
from kwashiorkor than in those affected by marasmus; both of course, have
reduced levels compared with healthy children.
A significant feature of kwashiorkor is a large protruding abdomen due to
edema and an enlarged liver. The edema is traditionally thought to occur
because an inadequate intake of protein leads to a reduced plasma albumin
concentration, which in turn causes edema, although electrolyte disturbances,
such as potassium deficiency and sodium retention, are also thought to play
a role. The hepatomegaly occurs from a large infusion of fats into the liver;
the cause of which is unknown. Early features of kwashiorkor include fatigue,
irritability, lethargy, stunted growth, muscular wasting, edema in the lower
limbs and impaired neurological development. The skin may be affected by
dermatitis and have areas of hypo- or hyperpigmentation and thin, brittle,
light colored hair that is easily pluckable. The patients may also present with
delayed wound healing and anemia. If untreated, kwashiorkor can result in
shock, coma and death, with a mortality rate as high as 60%. In the long term,
it can lead to impaired physical and mental development.

OBESITY
Obesity is diagnosed when the patient‚Äôs BMI is greater than 30 kg m‚Äì2 (Margin
Note 10.3). It is characterized by an excess of fat in the body, particularly under
the skin and is generally recognizable when a person is 20% above their IBW.
Environmental and genetic factors can determine body weight, but overeating
combined with lack of exercise are its usual causes (Box 10.2). Very rarely,
obesity may be secondary to endocrine disease (Chapter 7), for example
hypothyroidism that decreases energy requirements, Cushing‚Äôs syndrome
where the distribution of body fat is altered, and some hypothalamic disorders
that are associated with overeating.

NUTRITIONAL DISORDERS

BOX 10.2 Leptin and obese/OBESE
In 1994, the *obese gene was discovered in mice. Its expression
in adipocytes produces the hormone leptin, a polypeptide of 146
amino acid residues (Figure 10.23), which is secreted in amounts
that are proportional to the mass of body fat. Among the effects
of leptin are to decrease adiposity or total body fat and to pass
through the blood‚Äìbrain barrier and act on the hypothalamus
to inhibit eating. It also stimulates the oxidation of fatty stores
and prevents lipid accumulating in nonadipose tissues and so
protects the individual against some of the adverse effects of
fat accumulation, for example coronary artery disease. During
periods when more energy is used than ingested, that is the
starved state, adipose tissue is metabolized and the amount of
leptin secreted declines. Hence, the mouse is stimulated to eat
more. When more energy is consumed than used, the converse
holds. Mutations to the gene or its absence in mice can lead
to excessive overeating and morbid obesity (Figure 10.24 (A)
and (B)). Injections of synthetic leptin to obese mice cause a
weight loss. These Ô¨Åndings led to great excitement that obesity

in humans could be a genetic phenomenon and controllable
by leptin therapy. However, although the physiological effects
of leptin are similar in humans and mice, mutations in the
*OBESE gene have been discovered in only a handful of obese
humans. Two of these patients were members of the same
highly consanguineous family and weighed 29 and 86 kg at the
ages of two and eight years respectively. Their OBESE genes had
a deletion mutation of a single guanine nucleotide at codon
133 leading to a biologically inactive leptin. Injections of leptin
relieved their symptoms. However, most obese people, in fact,
secrete leptin in amounts that exceed its production in thinner
people because they have a greater mass of fat. Unfortunately,
they appear to be less sensitive to its effects.

*The convention is to write mice genes in lower case italic letters and
humans in upper case italics.

BOX 10.3 The Atkins Diet
The Atkins diet is a high protein, high fat and low carbohydrate
slimming diet (Figure 10.27) introduced by Atkins (1930‚Äì2003)
in 1972. The Atkins diet has received much publicity, and is
one of the more popular of those diets in which carbohydrate
intake is restricted. Individuals on the Atkins diet exclude most
cereal-based foods, beans, fruits and starchy vegetables. Instead
they eat generous amounts of meat, poultry, eggs, cream and
butter. Carbohydrates promote insulin production that, in turn,
causes weight gain because of the growth promoting effects
of insulin (Chapter 7). A low carbohydrate diet will therefore
reduce insulin production leading to a loss of weight. When
the intake of carbohydrates is reduced, the body responds
quickly by utilizing stored glycogen for energy, reducing body
weight as the glycogen and its associated water are lost.
Muscle, lean body mass, is not depleted because of the high
intake of dietary proteins but body fats are used for energy. The
oxidation of fats produces ketone bodies (ketosis) that are lost
in the urine, although this condition is much less severe than
the ketoacidosis of diabetes mellitus (Chapter 7). A number of
tissues, for example brain, utilize glucose in preference to other
fuels and this can be produced by gluconeogenesis in the liver
using amino acids when the dietary intake of carbohydrate is
low. The glucose 6-phosphate supplied from gluconeogenesis
also partially replenishes glycogen stores (Figure 10.28). The high
protein and fat intakes and the circulating ketone bodies have
satiating effects that suppress appetite, reduce food intake and
aid weight loss.
The program for a typical Atkins diet consists of four phases:
induction, ongoing weight loss (OWL), premaintenance and
a Ô¨Ånal or lifetime maintenance phase. In the induction phase,
carbohydrate intake is limited to 20 g daily and is associated
with the greatest weight loss, which can be as high as 3‚Äì4 kg
per week. In the OWL phase, carbohydrate intake is increased
by 5 g per day each week, with the goal of Ô¨Ånding the intake
of carbohydrates that will maintain weight reduction. The
OWL phase continues until weight is within 4.5 kg of the set

target. In the premaintenance phase, carbohydrate intake
is further increased with the aim of Ô¨Ånding the maximum
amount of carbohydrate intake that can be consumed each
day without causing a weight gain. The Ô¨Ånal or lifetime
maintenance phase continues the dietary plan of the previous
phase and also aims to avoid a return to previous dietary habits.
It has been shown that the weight losses in the Ô¨Årst six months
on the Atkins diet are greater than conventional diets but
there is little difference between them over a one-year period.
Supporters of the Atkins diet claim that the ketosis produced
during low carbohydrate diets is a safe and natural condition
necessary for weight loss. Surprisingly given the high fat intake,
some studies have indicated that individuals on the Atkins diet
have higher levels of HDL, the so-called ‚Äògood‚Äô cholesterol and
lower levels of triacylglycerols in their blood and that levels of
LDL cholesterol (Chapter 14) and glucose remain unchanged.
Some studies have shown these reductions are attributable to
the initial weight loss and concentrations often return to levels
that are higher than before the diet. Critics have also expressed
concerns that diets high in saturated fats may increase the
risk of cardiovascular diseases. The ketosis can result in bad
breath, tiredness, weakness, dizziness, insomnia and nausea.
Constipation may also occur as a consequence of avoiding highÔ¨Åber foods such as fruit, vegetables, rice and cereals. There are
also concerns that the unbalanced nature of the diet may lead
to nutritional deÔ¨Åciencies with undesirable effects. For example,
poor intakes of calcium may increase the risk of developing
osteoporosis. The high protein intake can also produce acidosis
that can leach calcium from bones and increase the likelihood
of kidney stones leading to osteoporosis and kidney problems
respectively. The poor intakes of antioxidants, found in fruit
and vegetables, increase susceptibility to heart disease and
cancers. Whether the Atkins diet should be recommended
for weight loss is a controversial issue. Long-term studies
are required to assess nutritional status, body composition
and cardiovascular risk factors in individuals on the diet.

ANOREXIA NERVOSA AND BULIMIA NERVOSA
Anorexia nervosa (AN) and bulimia nervosa (BN) are both disorders of eating
behavior and body weight regulation. Anorexia is simply a lack of appetite;
bulimia is derived, in part, from the Greek word limos meaning hunger. Both
have received considerable publicity in recent years although they were reported
many centuries ago. The prevalence rate for AN in young females is estimated to
be 0.3% and for BN 1% and 0.1% in young women and young men respectively.
The incidence in the general population is much lower with the incidences of
AN and BN being approximately 8 and 12 cases per 100 000 respectively.
Anorexia nervosa is an extreme refusal or reluctance to eat and associated
psychological problems, leading to a severe weight loss. Compulsive exercising
and the abuse of laxatives and diuretics often compound the reduced input
of dietary energy. Patients are therefore normally extremely hungry and are
obsessed with food but they avoid eating, especially carbohydrates. The
signs and symptoms of AN include a body weight at least 15% below the
recommended weight, a ‚Äòwasted‚Äô appearance with reduced muscle mass,
and swelling of the joints. In younger females, puberty is delayed; an older
female is likely to become amenorrhetic and infertile because her body
weight reduces to less than 45 kg and/or fat content becomes less than 22% of
body weight. The skin is dry, hair thin and the nails brittle. Constipation and
decreased heart rate and blood pressure are common. If left untreated, longterm damage to the skeleton and cardiac systems are likely and death can

NUTRITIONAL DISORDERS

result from starvation, cardiac arrest or other complications. Sufferers of AN
are often of above average intelligence but generally have a grossly dysmorphic
view of their own bodies, seeing themselves as obese, even though they ‚Äòknow‚Äô
they are underweight. It is unclear as to what causes this view. It has been
suggested that overreactions to relatively mild obesity, peer or social pressures
regarding an ideal human shape or a wish to delay the onset of menarche may
all be linked to the condition.
Bulimia nervosa is characterized by episodes of excessive or ‚Äòbinge‚Äô eating that
induce feelings of guilt such that sufferers induce vomiting to void the food.
This cycle of eating and induced vomiting can be repeated many times. As with
anorexics, the use of laxatives, diuretics and dieting pills may be abused. The
condition tends to affect older patients than those with anorexia. The signs
and symptoms of BN include puffy cheeks due to enlarged salivary glands
and often severely damaged tooth enamel because of the excessive vomiting.
Electrolyte imbalance, such as loss of potassium, can cause health problems
and increases the risk of cardiac arrest (Chapters 8 and 13). However, patients
generally manage to maintain their weight at an appropriate value and so the
condition may not be noticed and can remain undetected for many years.

DISORDERS OF VITAMIN NUTRITION
An inadequate dietary intake of a vitamin, its impaired absorption, or
insufficient utilization of an adequate intake, increased dietary requirements,
for example in pregnancy, without a corresponding increased intake or
an increased excretion of a vitamin give rise to hypovitaminoses. In many
cases, the symptoms of a hypovitaminosis can be correlated with the known
functions of the vitamin (Section 10.2), although in other cases they are
rather generalized. Hypovitaminoses often develop over an extended period.
Initially there is depletion of body stores with a biochemical impairment, that
is a subclinical deficiency. This eventually results in an overt deficiency with
frank signs and symptoms and is usually accompanied by other evidence of
malnutrition, for example PEM. A covert deficiency does not present with
clinical features under normal conditions, but any trauma or stress may
precipitate the hypovitaminosis. Starving individuals will suffer from multiple
vitamin deficiencies. At the other extreme, an excess of the vitamin can be
toxic and may result in a hypervitaminosis.

Hypovitaminoses
A deficiency of vitamin B1 or thiamin in some developing countries is common
because of the high consumption of foods, such as polished rice, where the
vitamin is lost during milling, and in chronic alcoholics, who often have a poor
diet. The consequences of a deficiency are depression, irritability, defective
memory, peripheral neuropathy and beriberi. Beriberi, which literally means
‚ÄòI cannot, I cannot‚Äô in Singhalese, occurs in two forms, which affect different
body systems. Dry beriberi mainly affects the nervous system, wet beriberi
the heart and circulation; both types usually occur in the same patient but
one set of symptoms predominates. Patients with the dry form may present
late, with polyneuropathy and Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome (Box 10.4). The
polyneuropathy is characterized initially by heavy, stiff legs, then weakness,
numbness and paresthesia and absent ankle jerks. Later stages involve the
trunk and arms. Wet beriberi, also known as shoshin, from the Japanese for
acute heart damage, is less common and characterized by edema. Symptoms
appear rapidly with acute heart failure in addition to the polyneuropathy. It is
highly fatal and known to cause sudden deaths in young migrant laborers in
Asia whose diet consists of white rice.
Vitamin B2 (riboflavin) deficiency is rare in the developed world and usually
only seen in alcoholics who normally have diets lacking other nutrients or

BOX 10.4 Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome or cerebral beriberi
Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome or cerebral beriberi, also known as
Wernicke‚Äôs disease or Korsakoff psychosis, is a brain disorder with
the loss of speciÔ¨Åc functions. The term Gayet disease is applied
when lesions are more extensive than those in the Wernicke
type. The condition is primarily due to a deÔ¨Åciency of vitamin B1
(thiamin) or secondary to alcoholism and/or starvation. Even in
alcoholics on a balanced diet, which is very unusual (Chapter 12),
the heavy drinking interferes with the absorption of thiamin from
the GIT. The syndrome includes two separate conditions. The
Ô¨Årst, Wernicke‚Äôs encephalopathy, involves damage to nerves of
the central and peripheral nervous systems. Korsakoff syndrome,
or Korsakoff psychosis, begins as Wernicke‚Äôs symptoms diminish
and involves damage to areas of the brain involved with memory.
Patients often attempt to hide the memory loss by confabulating,
that is telling detailed and credible stories that are untrue,
although these are not usually deliberate attempts at deception
because the patient often believes them to be factual. Other

symptoms include double vision and other eye abnormalities, a
loss of muscle coordination, unsteady gait and hallucinations.
Many of these symptoms are indicative of alcohol withdrawal and
may also be present or develop even when Wernicke-Korsakoff
syndrome is not present. Other disorders related to the abuse of
alcohol may also be apparent. Incidence and prevalence data for
Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome are poorly reported although one
study has indicated a prevalence of 1 to 3%.
Abstinence from alcohol or moderate intake together with
adequate nutrition reduces the risk of developing WernickeKorsakoff syndrome. Thiamin supplements and a good diet
may also help prevent the condition occurring in a heavy
drinker but not if damage has already occurred. The syndrome
is diagnosed following an examination of the nervous and
muscular systems that demonstrates polyneuropathy or damage
to multiple nerves and decreased or abnormal reÔ¨Çexes. Testing
of gait and coordination can indicate damage to the parts of

suffer malabsorption. However, it is a major problem globally affecting
some 200 million people, especially children, in developing countries. Other
susceptible people include the elderly with a poor diet and regular laxative
users. The main metabolic effects are on lipid metabolism, which leads to
clinical features of weakness, dermatitis, glossitis, insomnia and sensitivity to
bright light, normochromic and normocytic anemia. A deficiency of vitamin
B2 is rarely fatal because it is present in most foods, which provide adequate
amounts to maintain function, and there is efficient reutilization of the
vitamin during the turnover of flavoproteins, so that little is lost.
A deficiency of niacin causes pellagra, where the patients present with weight
loss, anemia, dementia, dermatitis and diarrhea. Pellagra can be primary
when the diet is deficient in nicotinic acid, such as when maize is the staple,
but it can be secondary, where other diseases interfere with absorption.
Causes of secondary pellagra include prolonged diarrhea, cirrhosis of the
liver, alcoholism (Chapter 12) and use of isoniazid (Figure 10.29) to treat TB.
Isoniazid reacts with vitamin B6 to form an inactive hydrazone and can lead
to a deficiency.
A deficiency of vitamin B5 (pantothenic acid) is rare but has been induced
experimentally in animals by feeding a diet virtually devoid of the vitamin or
by giving metabolic antagonists, such as V methylpantothenic acid. Symptoms
included irritability, fatigue, malaise, GIT problems, muscle cramps and
paresthesia. Historically, pantothenic acid deficiency has been implicated in
the ‚Äòburning feet‚Äô syndrome experienced by severely malnourished prisoners
of war.

A deficiency of vitamin B6 impairs the synthesis of F aminobutyric acid and
amino acid metabolism and may be implicated in the development of some
cancers (Chapter 17). Clinical features associated with a deficiency of vitamin
B6 include peripheral neuropathy. However, deficiencies are uncommon
because it is widely available. Cases have been reported in infants fed
overheated and inadequately fortified milk formula who developed severe
symptoms: irritability, opisthotonos, which is an arching of the head, neck
and spine backwards, and convulsions that were relieved by vitamin B6
supplements.

the brain that control muscle coordination. Muscles may be
weak and atrophied and abnormalities of eye movement may
be present. The patient may present as cachectic. Clinical tests
should demonstrate low serum vitamin B1 concentration and low
erythrocyte transketolase activity but an increase in pyruvate. A
magnetic resonance image or computed tomography scan of
the brain (Chapter 18) of a Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome patient
can show changes in the thalamus or hypothalamus. If the case
history is signiÔ¨Åcant for chronic alcohol abuse, then serum or
urine alcohol concentrations and liver enzyme activities may be
increased above normal.
Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome is a life-threatening condition with
a mortality rate of 10 to 20%. Treatment is aimed at controlling the
symptoms as much as possible and preventing any progression
of the disorder although some symptoms, particularly the loss of
memory and cognitive skills, may be permanent. Hospitalization

is required for the initial control of symptoms. In lethargic,
unconscious or comatose patients, appropriate monitoring
and care is necessary, particularly to prevent obstruction of the
airways. Carbohydrate loading, for example by glucose infusion,
may precipitate Wernicke‚Äôs encephalopathy in at-risk patients
but can be prevented by supplements of vitamin B1 prior to
the glucose infusion. Injections or oral supplements of vitamin
B1 may improve some symptoms but do not generally lead to
the recovery of memory and intellect. Total abstinence from
alcohol is required to prevent progressive damage to the brain
and peripheral nerves and a well-balanced, nourishing diet is
recommended. Joining a support group whose members share
common experiences and problems can often help in coping
with the stresses of the illness. There may be a need for custodial
care if the loss of cognitive skills is severe.

A deficiency of vitamin B12 causes megaloblastic anemia (Chapter 13)
and degeneration of the spinal cord. However, deficiencies are generally
uncommon, even in cases of severe malabsorption (Chapter 11), since
considerable amounts of the vitamin are stored in the liver. Deficiencies
can occur in strict vegetarians since sources are animal products. When a
deficiency does occur, it is seen most commonly in pernicious anemia,
an autoimmune disease characterized by lack of intrinsic factor required
for absorption of the vitamin from the GIT (Chapters 11 and 13). Bacterial
overgrowth in the GIT or diseases affecting the small intestine, such as
Crohn‚Äôs disease (Chapter 11), can also lead to a deficiency. Elderly people
with atrophic gastritis absorb vitamin B12 poorly. However, the first sign of
this is neuropathy because the anemia is hidden by folic acid intakes.
Folic acid deficiency is relatively common and occurs because of an
inadequate dietary intake in alcoholics and the elderly or because of
increased requirements, for example pregnancy and diseases associated
with increased cell and nucleic acid turnover, such as leukemia. The
deficiency can also arise because of malabsorption and because some
drugs affect folic acid metabolism, for example anticonvulsant drugs
interfere with its absorption. The major clinical feature of folic acid
deficiency is megaloblastic anemia (Chapter 13). An increased intake of
folic acid before and during pregnancy is associated with a decreased
risk of the fetus developing neural tube defects. Taking supplements of
folic acid before conception and in the first three months of pregnancy
reduces the incidence of spina bifida by more than 20%. In women who
have already had a pregnancy affected by a neural tube defect, taking a
daily folic acid supplement reduces their chances of a similarly affected
pregnancy by approximately 70%. Folic acid supplements are associated
with decreased amounts of homocysteine in the plasma with a reduced risk
of cardiovascular disease (Chapter 14).
Patients suffering a lack of only vitamin H (biotin) are extremely rare.
They tend to be individuals who consume extremely large amounts of raw
eggs, since the white contains the protein avidin, which binds tightly to
biotin (Figure 10.30). The vitamin is not released unless the egg is cooked;

however, more than 20 raw eggs must be consumed daily for this to become
a serious problem. Biotin deficiency occasionally occurs in hospital patients
on parenteral nutrition and leads to anorexia, nausea, dermatitis and
depression.
A lack of vitamin C causes scurvy. Inadequate dietary intake occurs in
infants aged six to 12 months who receive processed milk without vitamin C
supplements and in the elderly who have vitamin C deficient diets. The clinical
features of scurvy include skin papules, petechial and muscle hemorrhages,
poor wound healing, gum disease, anemia and osteoporosis. It has been
suggested that vitamin C reduces the incidence, duration and severity of the
common cold without any side effects, but there is no scientific evidence for
these claims.

binding protein with a bound retinol form of
vitamin A (red). PDB Ô¨Åle 1BRP.

A deficiency of vitamin A is rare in the developed world; indeed, large
amounts are stored in the liver and transported around the body bound to
retinol-binding protein in the plasma (Figure 10.31). In contrast, deficiencies
are major health issues in parts of Africa and South-East Asia. In pregnant
women, vitamin A deficiency not only causes night blindness but may increase
the risk of maternal mortality. Affected patients may present with anemia and
disorders of ectodermal tissues and increased risk of disease and death from
severe infections.
A deficiency of vitamin D impairs mineralization of bone matrix causing
rickets in children (Figure 10.32) and osteomalacia in adults. Rickets results in
deformities of the legs that bow due to the weight of the body, skull, rib cage
and pelvis. During the 1950s, rickets was virtually eradicated in the UK by
fortification of infant foods with vitamin D. Unfortunately, some susceptible
children suffered vitamin D toxicity and developed hypercalcemia (Chapter
8). As a consequence, the amount of vitamin D added to foods was reduced
and rickets reappeared. Overt rickets is now rare in the UK, although
subclinical rickets affects about 10% of young children. Osteomalacia causes
pain in the bones, especially of the pelvis and legs, and there is an increased
susceptibility to fractures of the long bones following minor trauma. It is
not uncommon in the UK, especially among women of some ethnic origins
because of their lack of exposure to sunlight during purdah and the wearing
of traditional clothes.
Vitamin E deficiency is rare. When it does occur, it is most likely in newborn
children because transfer of vitamin E across the placenta is poor and these
children also have less adipose tissue, where most of the vitamin is stored.
Deficiencies of vitamin E can occur with long-term parenteral nutrition and in
prolonged and severe steatorrhea (Chapter 11). Vitamin E deficiency in children
causes irritability, edema, hemolytic anemia and neurological dysfunction.
Decreased concentrations of plasma vitamin E have been associated with
progression of atherosclerosis and growth of some tumors. Other symptoms
such as ataxia, dysarthria, sensory loss and paresthesia have been described
in adults.

Papules are solid, limited raised
areas of skin about 5 mm in diameter
but their shape and color may vary.
They may be transitional lesions, and
can become vesicular or ulcerate.
Larger lesions are called nodules.
Petechial hemorrhages are small
round dark red spots caused by
bleeding under the skin.

'+'

The clinical effects of vitamin K deficiency include a prolonged clotting time
and a bleeding tendency as described in Chapter 13. A maternal deficiency
can lead to serious bone defects in the fetus. Vitamin K deficiency is most
common in neonates because it cannot cross the placenta and milk is a
poor dietary source so the baby is at risk of bleeding. Newly born babies lack
bacteria in their GIT that can synthesize vitamin K, although the significance
of intestinal synthesis by bacteria is debatable anyway. For this reason, it has
been recommended that all neonates are given a single prophylactic dose
of vitamin K. In adults, a deficiency may be seen in fat malabsorption or in
people using antibiotics that reduce intestinal bacteria. An inadequate intake
may reduce the density of bone and increase the risk of osteoporosis and
associated fractures, particularly in postmenopausal women.

NUTRITIONAL DISORDERS

Hypervitaminoses
Hypervitaminoses are relatively rare compared with deficiencies. An excess of
vitamins B6 and niacin can be toxic and is usually associated with excessive
intake of vitamin supplements. Large doses of niacin are associated with
a variety of clinical problems, including abnormalities of liver functions,
hyperglycemia, an increase in plasma uric acid and vasodilation. Daily doses
of vitamin B6 greater than 500 mg over an extended period can cause a sensory
neuropathy.
Most examples of hypervitaminoses are associated with vitamins A and D.
Vitamin A is stored in the liver and excessive dietary intake over prolonged
periods can lead to a toxic overload. Typical symptoms are pain in the bones,
a scaly dermatitis, nausea and diarrhea with enlargements of the liver and
spleen. Most cases of vitamin A toxicity are caused by patients overdosing
with vitamin supplements. The only natural food known to contain dangerous
levels of the vitamin is polar bear liver; not a common dietary item in most
societies! Animal studies have shown that vitamin A can produce teratogenic
effects when administered in high doses. The consumption of excessively large
amounts of vitamin A during pregnancy may increase the risk of congenital
malformations.
Excess of vitamin D is, again, largely associated with the overconsumption
of vitamin supplements. Toxicity is due to overstimulation of calcium
absorption from the gut and excessive resorption from bone which results in
its demineralization. The weakening of the bone and hypercalcemia (Chapter
8) promote metastatic calcification and a tendency in the patient to form
kidney stones.

NUTRITIONAL DISORDERS OF MINERALS AND TRACE ELEMENTS
Minerals and trace elements are necessary for numerous and diverse
metabolic activities. Clinical disorders arising from deficiencies in the
dietary intakes of minerals are not uncommon and a number are described
in Chapter 8. Conditions caused by excessive mineral ingestion are less
common but several are also outlined in the same chapter.

Figure 10.32 A child with the characteristic
bowed legs of rickets.

The total quantity of any one trace element in the body is usually less
than 5 g and these elements are often required in quantities of less than
20 mg per day, hence dietary deficiencies are uncommon. Chromium
deficiency can occur in patients on parenteral nutrition without adequate
supplementation and leads to glucose intolerance. An excess of chromium
(II) has no known symptoms, although chromium (III) and especially
chromium (VI) compounds are toxic. A deficiency of cobalt is rare and
causes indigestion, diarrhea, weight loss and a loss of memory. An excess of
cobalt is not associated with any known symptoms, although a high intake
over a prolonged period may lead to infertility in men. In addition, there
are occasional reports of cobalt cardiomyopathy following occupational
exposure.
Copper deficiency is uncommon, except in patients on synthetic oral or on
long-term parenteral nutrition. It can occur in infants because of malnutrition,
malabsorption, chronic diarrhea or prolonged feeding with low copper milk
diets. Premature infants are particularly susceptible because of their low copper
stores in the liver. Copper deficiency causes neutropenia and hypochromic
anemia in the early stages, both of which respond to dietary copper but not
iron. This is followed by bone abnormalities such as osteoporosis, decreased
pigmentation of the skin, pallor and neurological abnormalities in the later
stages. A dietary excess of copper is rare but occasionally happens following
food contamination and causes salivation, stomach pain, nausea, vomiting
and diarrhea (Box 10.1).

Warfarin is often used therapeutically
as an anticoagulant (Chapter 13).
However, because of the similarities
in structures, it is a vitamin K
antagonist (Figure 10.33 (A) and (B)).
Patients on warfarin therapy require
increased amounts of the vitamin.

models of (A) vitamin K1 and (B) warfarin. Note
the structural similarities in the ‚Äòleft-hand‚Äô sides

carbon in black and hydrogen in gray.

Nearly half of dietary fluoride is taken up by bone and can influence its
mechanical properties. The incorporation of fluoride in tooth enamel as
fluorapatite makes teeth more resistant to dental caries as it resists breakdown
by acids. Fluoride deficiency leads to impaired bone formation and dental
defects (Box 10.5).
Iodine deficiency causes an enlargement of the thyroid gland called goiter
(Figure 10.34), while a prolonged deficiency in children can lead to cretinism
(Chapter 7). Iodine deficiency is commonest in upland areas with thin
limestone soil because minerals, such as iodine are easily leached from these
types of soils and plants in the area are iodine deficient. The situation is
exacerbated if commercial iodized salt is not available. In some areas of Africa,
Brazil and the Himalayas, more than 90% of the population may develop goiter
due to iodine deficiency. Excessive intake of dietary iodide can also lead to
goiter. This is most commonly seen in Japanese communities who have a high
dietary intake of seaweed.

A lack of iron leads to anemia, which is described in Chapter 13. Increased
intake of dietary, medicinal or transfused iron can cause hemosiderosis,

BOX 10.5 Dental caries and Ô¨Çuoride
The bulk of the tooth is composed of a hard tissue called
dentine. The exposed part of the tooth or crown is covered with
enamel. Dental caries or tooth decay is caused by bacteria in
the plaque and is the commonest cause of toothache (Chapter
3). It is particularly common in children. Bacteria in the plaque
catabolize sugars producing organic acids that can demineralize
the enamel and the underlying dentine. The development of
dental caries depends upon a balance between the plaque
and bacteria and the ability of enamel to resist attack. The
commonest cause of dental caries is poor dental hygiene and
a frequent intake of dietary sugars. Regular brushing of the

'+)

teeth can remove plaque and reduce acid production since it
takes about 24 hours for the bacteria to reestablish themselves.
Treatment of caries involves removing the decayed part of the
teeth by drilling and replacing the decayed material with a
Ô¨Ålling.
Epidemiological studies have demonstrated the beneÔ¨Åts of
adding Ô¨Çuoride to drinking water (Ô¨Çuoridation) because as little
as one part per million (ppm) can prevent dental caries. Studies
in the UK showed that children living in areas with water Ô¨Çuoride
concentrations of about 1 ppm had 50% fewer cases of dental

characterized by deposits of iron compounds in organs such as the liver
and heart. Acute ingestion of large doses of ferrous salts can be fatal,
particularly in children under the age of two. Manganese deficiency is rare
but is believed to cause ataxia, hearing loss and dizziness. Inhalation of dust
from mining and other industrial sources can lead to manganese toxicity
and causes severe neurological dysfunction, similar to Parkinson‚Äôs disease
(Chapter 18). A dietary deficiency of molybdenum has not been reported.
However, molybdenum deficiency was noted in a patient on parenteral
nutrition who suffered from mental disturbances that progressed to coma.
Supplementation of molybdenum improved the patient‚Äôs clinical condition.
Levels of manganese in food and water must exceed 100 mg kg‚Äì1 body
weight to produce manganese toxicity. However, few data are available but
the major signs include diarrhea and anemia. The high concentrations are
thought to stimulate xanthine oxidase, leading to increased serum uric acid
and gout (Chapter 8).
Selenium deficiency results from a low dietary intake in parts of the world with
soils of low selenium content and has been reported in patients on long-term
parenteral nutrition. A deficiency of selenium may lead to a cardiomyopathy.
In China, this is called Keshan‚Äôs disease and affects young women and children
in selenium deficient regions and although selenium deficiency is a basic
factor in Keshan‚Äôs disease, its occurrence is seasonal and it is associated with
viral infections that cause inflammation of the heart. Prophylactic selenium
prevents the disease developing but selenium supplements do not reverse
heart muscle damage. A large intake of selenium causes selenosis, a condition
characterized by loss of hair, skin and nails.
Zinc deficiency is relatively common in populations in rural areas of the
Middle East and subtropical and tropical areas where unleavened whole
wheat bread can provide up to 75% of the energy intake. The little zinc in
wheat is bound by the relatively large amounts of phytic acid and fiber present
that inhibit its absorption. This is not a problem in leavened bread, as yeasts
produce phytases that inactivate the phytic acid. Zinc deficiency also occurs
during prolonged parenteral nutrition if inadequate amounts are provided.
A deficiency is associated with a period of severe catabolism, as would occur
in PEM. A severe deficiency occurs in the skin condition acrodermatitis
enteropathica, where there is an inherited defect in GIT zinc absorption. A
deficiency of zinc delays the onset of puberty. High doses of zinc reduce the
amount of copper the body can absorb causing anemia and weakness of the
bones.

caries than those in areas where the water Ô¨Çuoride was below
0.1 ppm. Indeed, removal of Ô¨Çuoride from the water increased
the incidence of caries. These UK studies have been supported
by others worldwide, where similar results have been obtained
despite ethnic, social, climatic and dietary differences. Fluoride
in toothpastes, mouthwashes or when consumed in a liquid
or tablet form is also effective in preventing dental caries. The
addition of Ô¨Çuoride to drinking water at concentrations greater
than 12 ppm promotes dental Ô¨Çuorosis, a mottling of the teeth
as they form in the jaws. Its effects are generally cosmetic and
only cause functional problems when the disorder is severe.

CZhhVg6]bZY!BVjgZZc9Vlhdc!8]g^hHb^i]:YLddY

Other concerns of Ô¨Çuoridation include its possible association
with cancer and arthritis. There is, however, a weak association
between Ô¨Çuoridation and an increased susceptibility to bone
fractures.
The addition of Ô¨Çuoride to drinking water has also raised ethical
issues because it is seen by some as an infringement of personal
liberty in that individuals have no choice but to drink water
containing Ô¨Çuoride. The use of Ô¨Çuoridation requires careful
consideration of the ethical issues and the balance between its
beneÔ¨Åcial and any potentially harmful effects.

10.4 INVESTIGATING NUTRITIONAL DISORDERS

Figure 10.35 Measuring arm circumference.

Figure 10.36 Measuring skin fold thickness.

The main objectives in investigating nutritional disorders are to detect
malnutrition, determine the most appropriate treatment and to monitor
the progress of the patient during treatment. A number of fairly general
investigations are available for patients suspected of suffering from
malnourishment, for example taking a medical history, physical examination
and laboratory investigations. A patient‚Äôs medical history may help to reveal
the underlying basis of the complaint. A significant part is determining
the dietary history, which usually involves dietary recall of the last one
to seven days, or food frequency questionnaires where patients estimate
how often a particular food on a list has been eaten. A medical history also
includes specific questions concerning recent weight changes, dietary
habits, for example alcohol consumption, appetite, GIT function, use of
vitamin and mineral supplements and drug intake. A physical examination
can include anthropometric measurements, such as weight, height, body
mass index (Margin Note 10.2), arm circumference and skinfold thickness.
Arm circumference is an indicator of muscle mass. The arm circumference
is measured at the midarm point in millimeters (Figure 10.35) and values
are typically 293 mm in males and 285 mm in females. Skinfold thickness
indicates the extent of subcutaneous fat stores. It is commonly measured
at the biceps, triceps, subscapular and suprailiac sites in both males and
females. In, for example, the triceps measurement the arm is allowed to hang
freely and a fold of skin above the midpoint of the arm is pulled from the
underlying muscle and measured to the nearest millimeter using calipers
(Figure 10.36). Values are typically 12.5 and 16.5 mm for males and females
respectively. Measurements at the four sites should be made in duplicate and
should not vary by more than 1 mm. If consecutive measurements become
increasingly smaller the fat is being compressed and other sites should be
assessed while the tissue recovers. However, the accuracy of the test depends
upon selecting the sites correctly, an appropriate technique in taking the
measurements and the experience of the tester; hence the trend is more
important than the values at any one time. Values for arm circumference
and skinfold thickness are compared with standard values for the same sex.
Undernutrition is indicated if they are less than 90% of these values.
The appearance of the skin, hair, nails, eyes, bones, teeth and mucous
membranes may reveal signs of malnutrition. A number of general laboratorybased investigations on blood and urine samples can aid in diagnosing
malnutrition and are listed in Table 10.8. These tests are not reliable when

Hair and nail samples are of questionable clinical value and are not routinely

PROTEIN-ENERGY MALNUTRITION
A diagnosis of PEM must identify the type present. Individuals affected by
maramus present with decreased anthropometric measurements, loss of
muscle mass and body weight. There is also a decline in body temperature,
pulse and metabolic rate. Serum protein levels are often low but can be
normal. Children suffering from PEM have reduced rates of growth and are
shorter, particularly in marasmus, compared with their normal counterparts.
This can be easily assessed using charts of growth rates (Figure 10.37). They
also have an impaired immune system, because of reduced protein synthesis
in particular of immunoglobulins, and, as a consequence, infections such
as measles that a child would normally be expected to survive are common
causes of death in severe cases. A diagnosis of kwashiorkor is made following
a thorough physical examination together with a medical and dietary history.
Patients affected with kwashiorkor have the characteristic swollen abdomen,

OBESITY
In addition to arm circumference and skinfold thickness, the distribution
of fat in obese patients can be assessed by determining the waist : hip ratio.
The waist circumference is measured at its narrowest point and divided by
that of the hip at its widest. Ratios greater than 0.80 for women and 0.95 for
men increase the risk of developing clinical problems associated with obesity
(Table 10.7). Ultrasonography can also be used on soft tissue adipose material.
The technique reflects ultrasound waves from internal tissues or organs and
the echo patterns are analyzed to form a picture of body tissues called a
sonogram. The extent of fat deposition can be accurately determined but is
more expensive than other methods and not widely used.

ANOREXIA NERVOSA AND BULIMIA NERVOSA
Anorexia nervosa and BN are difficult to identify, given that the patients often
take extreme measures to hide the condition and, indeed, often refuse to admit
to any problem. Diagnosis relies on a medical history, clinical investigation

supported by anthropometric measurements, coupled with a sympathetic
psychological assessment.

VITAMINS
The majority of vitamin disorders encountered in clinical practice are
deficiencies. The investigative procedures are varied and depend upon
the vitamin in question. Chemical tests can help to confirm the diagnosis
of overt vitamin deficiencies and may enable diagnosis to be made at a
relatively early stage. The types of tests used include direct measurements of
the concentration of the vitamin or one of its metabolites in plasma, serum,
erythrocytes, urine or tissue biopsies. The concentration of vitamin in plasma
does not necessarily reflect body vitamin status and a measurement of the
concentration in blood cells may be a better indicator. Enzyme-based tests
are available for some vitamins. Metabolites that accumulate in the blood
or urine following the blockage of a metabolic pathway normally catalyzed
by an enzyme that requires a vitamin as a cofactor or coenzyme may also be
investigated.
Vitamin B1 (thiamin) deficiency can be assessed by direct measurement
of its concentration in plasma or indirectly by determining the increase in
erythrocyte transketolase activity in the presence of added TPP. The increase
in activity is called the activation coefficient. A coefficient less than 15% is
considered normal; an increase of 15‚Äì25% indicates a marginal deficiency,
while an increase greater than 25% with clinical signs is indicative of severe
thiamin deficiency. Thiamin deficiency can also be assessed by the clinical
response to administered thiamin, that is, an improvement in the condition
after administering thiamin supplements. The nutritional status of vitamin B2
(riboflavin) is investigated in a similar manner by determining the activation
of glutathione reductase activity of erythrocytes in the presence of added
FAD.
Assessing the nutritional status of niacin is more difficult. The usual method
is to determine the concentrations of metabolites of niacin, for example
1-methylnicotinamide and 1-methyl-3-carboxamido-6-pyridone, in urine
samples. Both are reasonably good measures of niacin status, as is the ratio of
the concentrations of NAD+ to NADP+ in erythrocytes. A ratio of less than 1.0
may identify subjects at risk of developing a niacin deficiency. The nutritional
status of vitamin B5 (pantothenic acid) can also be assessed by determining
its concentration in plasma or urine samples. In general, plasma pantothenic
acid concentrations decrease in patients on a pantothenic acid deficient diet.
However, the concentrations of pantothenic acid in blood respond less readily
to intake than does the concentration in urine.
The status of vitamin B6 can be investigated in a manner similar to those for
thiamin and riboflavin by determining the activation coefficients of erythrocyte
alanine and aspartate transaminase activities (ALT and AST respectively) in
the presence of the cofactor pyridoxal phosphate. Alternatively, vitamin B6
status may be assessed by the tryptophan loading test. Tryptophan is normally
catabolized by the pathway shown in Figure 10.38. However, the activity of
kynureninase decreases markedly in B6 deficient patients. If such a patient
is given an oral dose of 50 mg per kilogram body weight of tryptophan, then
there is an increase in the amounts of kynurenic and xanthurenic acids formed
and these appear in the urine. Generally less than 30 mg of xanthurenic acid
is excreted daily; higher amounts are indicative of vitamin B6 deficiency.
However, some other disorders of tryptophan catabolism can also lead to an
increase in xanthurenic acid production so abnormal results must be treated
with caution.
A possible deficiency of vitamin H (biotin) can be investigated by measuring
its concentration in whole blood, serum or urine. Determining plasma biotin

is not a reliable indicator of status. Changes in urinary excretion of biotin or
of its metabolites are better indicators of biotin status.
Folic acid status may be investigated by directly measuring its concentration
in serum or erythrocytes although these are associated with a number of
problems. Serum folic acid tends to reflect dietary intake over the previous
few weeks. Patients with both acquired and inherited folic acid deficiency may
remain moderately deficient for months or years, taking in just enough folic
acid to prevent low erythrocyte folic acid concentrations and frank anemia.
Erythrocyte values are not sensitive to short-term variations; depletion
occurs only in the later stages of deficiency and is usually accompanied by
megaloblastic anemia. Both erythrocyte and serum folic acid studies must
be performed. Severe folic acid deficiency is accompanied by a macrocytic
anemia (Chapter 13) although the size of erythrocytes may be entirely normal
in lesser degrees of depletion. Serum vitamin B12 concentrations should also
be measured when evaluating folic acid deficiency since if either vitamin
is deficient it can lead to a failure in absorption by megaloblastic intestinal
cells resulting in a secondary deficiency of the other. Formiminoglutamic
acid (FIGLU) is a substrate for the folic acid dependent enzyme, formimino-

DIET AND DISEASE

glutamate formiminotransferase required for histidine catabolism. When the
vitamin is deficient, FIGLU accumulates and is excreted into urine providing
a sensitive test of deficiency. However, FIGLU also increases in vitamin B12
deficiency and liver disease, so a high FIGLU excretion is not specific for the
diagnosis.
A deficiency of vitamin B12 (cobalamin) is investigated by measuring its serum
concentration and by hematological examination of blood and bone marrow
slides. Serum B12 can be measured in isolation or as part of a Schilling test
to exclude intrinsic factor deficiency (pernicious anemia, Chapter 13). A
Schilling test will assess whether vitamin B12 is being absorbed correctly by
the body. The amount of vitamin B12 excreted in urine over a 24 h period is
determined after giving the patient a known amount of radioactively labeled
vitamin B12. If the GIT is able to absorb vitamin B12 normally, then up to 25%
of the vitamin will be present in the urine. If there is failure in absorption,
then little or no vitamin B12 is detected in the urine. In the latter case, the test
is repeated following an oral dose of intrinsic factor to determine whether the
vitamin deficiency is due to lack of intrinsic factor or a GIT problem.
The concentration of vitamin C in the plasma is a poor indicator of
deficiency. Measurements of cellular stores, especially in leukocytes are more
useful. However, vitamin C concentrations in leukocytes should always be
accompanied by a differential leukocyte count, given that different types of
leukocytes vary in their capacity to accumulate the vitamin. A change in the
proportion of polymorphonuclear leukocytes, which become saturated with
vitamin C at lower concentrations than other leukocytes, would result in a
change in total concentration of vitamin C per 106 cells, even if the nutritional
status of the vitamin is unchanged.
The concentration of vitamin A in the plasma can be measured but this may
be misleading as it only declines when tissue stores become severely depleted.
Deficiency can also occur in severe protein deficiency which decreases the
amount of its carrier protein. In such cases, the concentration of plasma
vitamin A would increase once the protein deficiency was corrected. Clinical
investigations of possible vitamin D deficiency involve determining serum
calcium and phosphate concentrations and measuring serum alkaline
phosphatase activity, since the enzyme is lost from cells during bone
catabolism. The metabolite, 25-hydroxycholecalciferol in samples of plasma
can be measured directly and is a good indicator of vitamin D status in the
presence of normal renal function. Vitamin E status can also be assessed
by direct measurement of its concentration in the plasma or serum, while
vitamin K deficiency is investigated by assessing the prothrombin time of the
patient (Chapter 13).

MINERALS AND TRACE ELEMENTS
A diagnosis of an overt mineral deficiency or excess can be confirmed by
chemical tests that measure its concentration in the serum or, in some cases,
urine. These measurements can give an indication of the amounts present
in body tissues, although urine values tend to reflect dietary intake rather
than the amounts stored in the body. The value of determining the serum
concentrations of sodium, potassium, calcium and phosphate have been
considered in Chapter 8. Investigations of chloride and sulfate are of little
clinical relevance.
Measuring the concentrations of trace elements in clinical samples is complex
and requires sensitive techniques because of their low values. Samples of
plasma are often used but the determined values may not accurately reflect
the concentration of the trace element at its site of action, which may be
intracellular. However, for many trace elements, a low plasma concentration
is indicative of a deficiency and adequate supplementation needs to be

GENERAL MANAGEMENT OF NUTRITIONAL DISORDERS

provided, while a high value is an indicator of possible toxic levels. Copper
deficiency is uncommon, except in patients on synthetic oral or intravenous
diets. In these patients, serum copper is reduced to less than 12 Lmol dm‚Äì3.
Low concentrations of plasma copper may indicate depleted stores but are
a poor indicator of short-term copper status. Measuring Cu/Zn superoxide
dismutase and cytochrome oxidase activities can also indicate copper status
as the activities of these enzymes are reduced on a low copper diet. There is
no satisfactory test for chromium deficiency and a diagnosis is usually made
following improved glucose tolerance after chromium supplementation.
Serum fluoride concentration can indicate fluoride exposure and can
provide information on endemic fluorosis and allow preventative measures
to be taken. Some, but not all studies, have reported a direct relationship
between serum fluoride and the degree of fluorosis. Measurements of serum
iodine may be a useful assessment of thyroid activity in adults. They may
also be of use in investigating cretinism in infants, allowing a diagnosis to
be made at an earlier age than is possible by other methods. Serum iodine
measurements are also of value in assessing iodine toxicity. Methods to
investigate the iron status of a patient are described in Chapter 13. Serum
iron and total iron binding capacity can be investigated but serum ferritin
is a better measure of total body iron stores. The amount of magnesium in
serum is less than 1% of the total in the body and is therefore a relatively
poor indicator of magnesium status. If hypomagnesemia is present (Chapter
8), then magnesium deficiency is likely but a normal serum value does not
exclude a significant deficiency. Measurements of molybdenum in biological
fluids are rarely required, which is perhaps fortunate since the methods used
are inadequate due to the low concentrations involved. Selenium deficiency
occurs with poor dietary intake and can be detected by its measurement
in plasma or whole blood. However, determining erythrocyte activity of
the selenium dependent enzyme, glutathione peroxidase can indirectly
assess selenium status. Zinc concentrations less than 8 Lmol dm‚Äì3 in the
plasma may indicate zinc deficiency but low values may be associated with
hypoalbuminemia, as most zinc is bound to albumin.
Chemical tests for mineral and trace element deficiencies must always be
used to complement the medical history and physical examination since
many of their findings may reflect underlying disease additional to the
nutritional status of a patient. It is therefore necessary to understand these
illnesses and how they influence the findings of physical and laboratory
investigations.

10.5 GENERAL MANAGEMENT OF NUTRITIONAL DISORDERS
Patients who are malnourished or at risk of developing malnutrition require
appropriate therapy, which ranges from simple dietary advice to long-term
parenteral nutrition. The dietary needs of the patient must be carefully assessed
to provide the correct amounts of energy, protein, vitamins, minerals and trace
elements. Patients receive these diets by oral (Figure 10.39), tube and parenteral
feeding; the last is most commonly administered by intravenous infusion.
Oral supplementation should be used wherever possible and the common
practice is to encourage consumption of specific foods or supplements that
rectify the nutritional disorder in question. In cases where oral feeding is
not possible, then liquid food is administered through a nasal tube to the
stomach or small intestine. Tube feeding is particularly useful in patients with
swallowing difficulties or anorexia. During tube feeding, liquid may be pumped
continuously at a constant rate of 75 to 150 cm3 per hour for 8‚Äì24 h. Liquid
foods for tube feeding are available commercially as formulae that meet nearly
all the patient needs. In some cases, food is administered as a bolus, that is,
infusing a discrete volume of formula through the tube under gravity several

times daily. It has the advantages of reducing the cost and allowing stable longterm patients more mobility. Parenteral feeding bypasses the GIT so nutrients
are delivered directly into the blood. It is only used when oral or tube feeding
have been deemed unsuitable; such as in patients who cannot eat or absorb
food from the GIT. Total parenteral nutrition given via the peripheral veins or,
in cases of long-term nutrition, through a central venous catheter can provide
complete nutrition using preparations containing appropriate amounts of
energy, amino acids, vitamins, minerals and trace elements. Like liquid foods
for tube feeding, these preparations are available commercially but they are
occasionally prepared individually to meet a patient‚Äôs specific needs. Patients
on long-term total parenteral nutrition require careful clinical and laboratory
monitoring. Indeed, patients often have an increased risk of infection at the
venous catheter site so care is necessary. Biochemical changes usually precede
any clinical signs of nutrient deficiency and so regular laboratory monitoring
is essential for early detection of any micronutrient deficiency.
Patients with PEM cannot immediately accept normal food because there
are digestive enzyme deficiencies and often gastroenteritis. Rehydration is
a priority and oral solutions (Figure 10.40) achieve this in some cases, while
intravenous infusions may be necessary in severe cases. Diluted milk with
added sugar may be given initially and as this becomes accepted the proportion
of milk can be gradually increased. The cessation of diarrhea indicates that the
health of the GIT mucosa is improving and normal foods can be gradually
returned to the diet.
The management of obesity aims to reduce food intake, particularly total
energy intake, and to encourage regular exercise. This is often achieved by
cutting down on high energy foods, such as fats and alcohol. Education and
psychological support can be helpful in cases of severe obesity. Orlistat, an
inhibitor of pancreatic lipase, has been used to manage obesity since it reduces
the digestion and absorption of dietary fats (Chapter 11) and sibutramine to
suppress the appetite, in conjunction with an energy-controlled diet, has been
used to control weight. Surgery is used in some cases of severe obesity. Jejunoileal bypass surgery for morbid obesity was first performed in 1952. In this
process the end of the jejunum or the beginning of the ileum are removed and
the remaining portions joined together. Most of the small intestine is removed
leaving only a short length for digestion and absorption. Although jejuno-ileal
bypass surgery results in a very good weight loss, severe side effects occur. The
technique has been replaced with gastric bypass surgery where the upper part
of the stomach is connected to the small intestine about one third of the way
along its length. Thus only the lower part of the stomach and approximately
two thirds of the small intestine are available for digestion and absorption,
reducing energy intake and therefore weight, but dieting is still likely to be
required. Again, this operation is not without the risk of developing serious
postoperative complications. Liposuction may also be used to remove fat
from under the skin though this is typically performed mainly for cosmetic
rather than therapeutic reasons.

Eating disorders, such as AN and BN, are difficult to prevent and remain
hard to treat. There are seemingly few effective treatments and no universally
recognized plan of treatment. However, the goals of any therapy must be to
establish normal eating patterns and to restore the patient‚Äôs nutritional status
and weight. Usually a multidisciplinary approach tailored to the individual is
used. This will involve specialists in nutrition and mental health in addition
to clinicians. Therapy generally involves the family, behavior modification and
nutrition counseling, support groups and the use of antidepressants. Most
patients with AN or BN are treated as outpatients although in severe cases
hospitalization may be necessary. Given that compliance is often problematic,
AN and BN are generally considered to be chronic disorders interrupted only
by intermittent periods of short-lived remission.

of biological molecules. The amount of each nutrient required to maintain
health can be expressed as its dietary reference value (DRV). Nutritional
disorders may arise from deficiencies or in some cases an excess of nutrients.
Such disorders may be investigated, initially by taking a medical history, by
the use of dietary questionnaires and by a physical examination, which may
include taking anthropometric measurements. Laboratory tests may be used
to confirm suspected diagnoses. Protein-energy malnutrition may lead to
marasmus or kwashiorkor, while obesity, an increasing problem in developed
countries, predisposes an individual to a variety of disorders including
type 2 diabetes and coronary heart disease. Anorexia nervosa and bulimia
nervosa are complex eating disorders with underlying psychological bases
that require treatment, as well as help for the obvious nutritional deficits. The
variety of disorders arising from vitamin deficits reflects the range of vitamins
required for health and their diverse roles in the body. Hypervitaminoses are
uncommon, although some B vitamins along with vitamin A and D toxicities
have been observed when excessive amounts of vitamin supplements have
been consumed. Disorders associated with mineral deficiencies are rare,
though they do occur, for example is the development of thyroid goiter in
diets deficient in iodine.
The management of nutritional disorders may require simple dietary advice,
or, where severe, nutritional supplements. Medical interventions may require
tube or parenteral feeding to restore a good nutritional status.

DISORDERS OF THE
GASTROINTESTINAL TRACT, PANCREAS,
LIVER AND GALL BLADDER

OBJECTIVES
After studying this chapter you should be able to:
N

outline the structure of the gastrointestinal tract and its accessory organs;

N

describe the processes involved in the digestion of foods;

N

outline the process whereby nutrients are absorbed by the gastrointestinal
tract;

N

review the role of the small intestine in homeostasis;

N

explain the causes of some pancreatic, liver and gall bladder disorders;

N

describe some common gastrointestinal tract disorders.

11.1 INTRODUCTION
The gastrointestinal tract (GIT) is essentially a long tube extending from the
mouth to the anus with a number of specialized regions. Most of the nutrients
(Chapter 10) in food have to be digested before they can be assimilated.
Digestion involves the hydrolysis of polysaccharides, oligosaccharides, proteins and lipids in enzyme-catalyzed reactions. The products of hydrolysis,
such as monosaccharides, amino acids, free fatty acids and monoacylglycerols,
can then be absorbed. Some nutrients, vitamins and minerals for instance, are
absorbed without the need for digestion. The digestion of food and absorption of the released nutrients are the major functions of the GIT together with
its accessory organs, the pancreas, liver and gall bladder. The peritoneum
lines the abdominal cavity and covers the major organs. Folds of the peritoneum, called the mesentery, and mesocolon hold the intestines in place. The
GIT has significant roles in the homeostasis of nutrients and in protecting
the body against pathogens (Chapter 2) ingested with the food. Digestion and
absorption, can, of course, only take place after ingestion of food, unlike the
homeostatic and protective functions that operate continuously.

DISORDERS OF THE GASTROINTESTINAL TRACT, PANCREAS, LIVER AND GALL BLADDER

11.2 THE GASTROINTESTINAL TRACT AND ITS ACCESSORY
ORGANS
The GIT may be described as a tubular system with distinctive regions that
begin with the mouth leading to the pharynx, esophagus, stomach, the
small and large intestines and terminating at the anus (Figure 11.1 (A)). It
is associated with several accessory digestive organs, such as the pancreas,
liver and gall bladder (Figure 11.1 (B)). The walls of the GIT have a fairly
common substructure (Figure 11.2 (A) and (B)) and its interior is called the
lumen. The GIT and accessory organs are bound to each other and to the
inner wall of the abdomen by the peritoneum. This is a strong, colorless
membrane with a smooth surface that consists of two parts; the parietal
peritoneum, which lines the abdominal cavity, and the visceral peritoneum
that covers most of the organs in the abdomen (Figure 11.3). The thin space
between the two parts, called the peritoneal cavity, is filled with serous
fluid. In males, the peritoneum forms a closed sac but in females it is continuous with the mucous membrane of the uterine tubes. The mesentery is
a fan shaped portion of peritoneum that extends from the posterior abdominal wall and wraps around the small intestine and returns to its origin
forming a double layer (Figure 11.4). The mesentery contains the blood and

lymphatic vessels and nerves that supply the small intestine. Another peritoneal fold, the mesocolon (Figure 11.4), has similar functions with respect
to the large intestine. The mesentery and mesocolon anchor the intestines
in place but only loosely, allowing them considerable movement as muscular activities mix and move the contents through the GIT.
The pancreas is found near the stomach and small intestine (Figure 11.1 (A)
and (B)) and functions as both an exocrine and an endocrine gland. In its exocrine role it produces pancreatic juice that is released into the first part of the
small intestine, the duodenum, through the pancreatic duct. This secretion
contains precursors of digestive enzymes that are activated and function in
the GIT, and also hydrogen carbonate (HCO3‚Äì) that increases the pH of GIT
contents. This latter function is vital since the material leaving the stomach
is acidic. The pancreas produces about 1200‚Äì1500 cm3 of pancreatic juice per

day. Within the tissues of the pancreas are groups of cells called the islets of
Langerhans. The cells in the islets have endocrine functions and produce and
secrete the peptide hormones glucagon and insulin that regulate the concentration of glucose in the blood (Chapter 7).
The liver is the largest organ in the body (Figure 11.1 (A) and (B)), weighing
about 1.5 kg. It has two major lobes, each divided into functional units called
lobules. Lobules consist of cuboidal cells arranged around a central vein into
which the blood drains. Between the plates of hepatic cells are sinusoids that
are supplied by the portal vein and hepatic artery (Figure 12.2 and Chapter
12). The sinusoids are lined with phagocytic Kupffer cells that belong to the

BOX 11.1 Peritonitis
Peritonitis is an inÔ¨Çammation of the peritoneum that lines the
abdominal cavity and covers the surfaces of abdominal organs.
The condition is marked by exudations into the peritoneum of
serum, Ô¨Åbrin, cells and pus. Primary peritonitis is caused by the
spread of an infection from the blood and lymph nodes to the
peritoneum and accounts for less than 1% of all cases. Secondary
peritonitis is the commonest type and occurs when bacteria
enter the peritoneum from the GIT or biliary tract. The symptoms
of peritonitis may include vomiting, swelling of the abdomen,
severe abdominal pain and tenderness, weight loss, constipation
and moderate fever. Its major causes are perforations of GIT wall,
which allows seepage of the luminal contents into the abdominal cavity. These can arise from a ruptured appendix or from perforations of the stomach, including damage from ulcers, and gall
bladder. Pelvic inÔ¨Çammatory disease in sexually active women is
also a common cause. Peritonitis can also develop after surgery
when bacteria have been allowed to enter the abdomen during
an operation.
Peritonitis must be rapidly diagnosed and treated because complications can occur rapidly. Diagnosis relies on taking a medi-

'-%

cal history and a physical examination, particularly to investigate
any abdominal swelling and tenderness. Diagnostic tests include
using X-rays or a CT scan (Chapter 18) of the abdomen to conÔ¨Årm
the presence of Ô¨Çuid, accumulation of pus or infected organs
in the abdomen. Microbiological tests on samples of blood
or abdominal Ô¨Çuid can identify the causative microorganism.
Peritonitis is frequently life-threatening and acute peritonitis is a
medical emergency. The outlook for untreated patients is poor.
SpeciÔ¨Åc treatments for peritonitis depend on the age, health,
medical history and the severity of the condition. Treatment is
generally aimed at treating the underlying condition. Antibiotics
are given immediately once peritonitis has been diagnosed. A
nasal tube may be inserted into the stomach or intestine to drain
Ô¨Çuid and gas. Peritoneal lavage, where large amounts of Ô¨Çuid are
injected into the peritoneum to wash out the infective microorganisms causing the condition, may be desirable. Intravenous
Ô¨Çuids are also given to replace lost body Ô¨Çuids. Morphine may
be prescribed in hospitalized patients to reduce pain. Emergency
exploratory surgery may be necessary, especially in cases that
involve appendicitis, a perforated peptic ulcer or diverticulitis.

reticuloendothelial system and their main function is to engulf bacteria and
other foreign particles in blood. Thus there is a dual blood supply to liver, with
blood coming from the digestive tract and spleen through the portal vein, and
from the aorta in the hepatic artery (Figure 14.2). About a third of incoming
blood is arterial, and brings oxygen, whereas two thirds is venous from the
portal vein.
The large reserve capacity of the liver means that it needs only 10‚Äì20% of
its tissues to be functioning to sustain life. It also has a remarkable ability
to regenerate itself after its tissue has been removed or destroyed by disease. Complete destruction or removal of the liver results in death within
10 h, hence liver disease with loss of function is a serious matter (Chapter
12). The liver has numerous functions. It acts as an interface between the
GIT and the rest of the body tissues because the hepatic portal vein carries blood directly to it from the GIT. Hence it is able to regulate the posthepatic blood concentrations of many of the nutrients absorbed by the GIT.
Similarly, the liver also regulates the concentrations of many biomolecules
produced by the body, for example steroid hormones, and deals with many
toxins, such as drugs, pesticides and carcinogens, to render them less harmful and solubilizes them for excretion (Chapter 12). The liver also produces
many of the plasma proteins including albumin and the clotting factors
(Chapter 13). Bile produced by the hepatocytes is secreted into bile canaliculi and eventually drains into the bile duct. About 700‚Äì1200 cm3 of bile
are produced daily and stored and concentrated in a hollow organ called
the gall bladder (Figure 11.1 (A) and (B)) prior to its release in the small
intestine. Bile does not contain enzymes, but it does contain bile salts, for
example sodium glycocholate and taurocholate. These are detergents that
aid in the digestion of lipids by emulsifying them to form water-soluble
complexes.
Bile pigments are derived from heme which results from the destruction
of old erythrocytes (Chapter 13). In the spleen (Figure 11.1 (A) and (B)),
destruction of red blood cells releases hemoglobin, which is then catabolized to free heme and globin. The latter is degraded to amino acids.
Bilirubin is derived from heme, the iron-containing protoporphyrin ring
of hemoglobin. A typical adult produces around 450 ¬µmol of bilirubin per
day. This bilirubin is referred to as unconjugated bilirubin. It is insoluble
in water and is transported in the plasma bound to albumin to be taken
up by hepatocytes. Here, it is conjugated with glucuronic acid by UDPglucuronyltransferase to form mono- and diglucuronides in a manner
resembling the detoxification reactions described in Chapter 12. Conjugated
bilirubin is much more water soluble than its unconjugated form and is
secreted into the bile duct. In the small intestine, conjugated bilirubin is a
substrate for bacteria that convert it to urobilinogen and stercobilin. Most
stercobilin is excreted in feces, although some urobilinogen is absorbed and
taken to the liver in the hepatic portal vein and re-excreted in bile or by the
kidneys (Figure 11.5).

11.3 DIGESTION
Digestion is the hydrolytic breakdown of nutrient macromolecules and
compound lipids to smaller products that can be absorbed. The hydrolytic
reactions are catalyzed by a variety of enzymes: proteases that digest proteins; carbohydrases that digest carbohydrates; lipases that catalyze the
hydrolysis of lipids and nucleases that degrade DNA and RNA. Digestion
occurs in the mouth, to a small extent, stomach and small intestine, and
most absorption of nutrients occurs in the small intestine and that of water
in the large intestine.

Margin Note 11.1 Flavor and
taste

i

Flavor is a complicated amalgam of
sensory perceptions, involving the
taste, smell and texture of foods,
previous exposure to particular foods,
especially in childhood, and even
the noises associated with chewing
some foods. In general, much of the
everyday sensation of Ô¨Çavor is derived
largely from olfactory stimulation.
Anosmia, the loss of the sense of
smell, for example when infected with
a cold, can severely reduce the sense
of taste.
Six tastes can be detected by different types of sensory taste buds
distributed over the tongue. These
are bitter, salty, sour, sweet, fats
(fatty acids) and savory or umami.
The Ô¨Årst four are self-explanatory.
The perception of fats is more strictly
the detection of small amounts of
fatty acids hydrolyzed from lipids by
the action of lingual lipase. In 1907,
Ikeda working at the Tokyo Imperial
University investigated the source of a
Ô¨Çavor well recognized in many Asian
countries called umami. This most
easily translates in English as savory or
meaty. He was successful in extracting
crystals of the amino acid, glutamate
from a type of seaweed called kombu
used in traditional Japanese cuisine.
Many foods that have a umami
Ô¨Çavor are protein rich, for example
meat, seafoods, aged cheeses, and
contain large amounts of glutamate.
Monosodium glutamate (MSG) was
developed as a food additive and is
probably the most familiar example
of an additive that imparts a savory or
umami taste.
The evolution of speciÔ¨Åc taste receptors is most easily explained by the
advantages gained in detecting foods
rich in essential nutrients (salty, sweet,
fats and savory) and in avoiding ones
that contain toxins (bitter and sour).

MOUTH
In the mouth, teeth break the food into smaller portions increasing the surface
area upon which digestive enzymes can act. Three pairs of salivary glands,
the submandibular located under the jaws, the sublingual located under the
tongue and the parotid situated in front of the ears (Figure 11.6), secrete saliva
into the mouth. The saliva contains amylase (Figure 11.7), water and mucus.
The water helps to dissolve nutrients, while the mucus acts as a lubricant to
aid swallowing and lubricates passage of food through the GIT. Chewing and
the actions of the tongue mix the food with the saliva. Salivary amylase begins
the digestion of carbohydrates (Figure 11.8) although the digestion of carbohydrates in the mouth is minimal since the food is not retained there for any
length of time. Lingual lipase is secreted by lingual serous glands. Again, little
digestion occurs in the mouth but it has been suggested that the fatty acids

In swallowing, the soft palate is elevated, which seals off the nasal cavity and
pushes against the back wall of the pharynx. This, in turn, triggers an automatic reflex action in muscles that raise the larynx, pushing its opening, the
glottis, against a flap of tissue called the epiglottis. These actions prevent food
entering the trachea of the respiratory system and ensure food is expelled
from the mouth into the esophagus. Rhythmic waves of contraction of smooth
muscle tissue in the walls of the GIT, called peristalsis, forces food along the
GIT. Peristalsis in the esophagus ensures that food is propelled to the stomach
even if the person is upside down.

STOMACH
The stomach is a sac-like region of the GIT (Figure 11.1 (A) and (B)). Its inner
surface is highly folded (Figure 11.9) allowing it to expand up to eightfold from
its empty volume of about 50 cm3 following a meal. Muscular activities of the
stomach wall mix the food with gastric juice secreted by gastric glands located
in the mucosal lining of the stomach. Gastric glands produce about 1 to 2 dm3

DISORDERS OF THE GASTROINTESTINAL TRACT, PANCREAS, LIVER AND GALL BLADDER

i

Patients suffering cystic Ô¨Åbrosis (CF,
Chapter 15) are defective in pancreatic lipase and other enzyme
activities due to exocrine pancreatic
insufÔ¨Åciency when the pancreatic
duct becomes blocked with a thick
secretion. This reduces their ability to
digest lipids and leads to lipid
malabsorption and steatorrhea
(Section 11.8). Many CF patients are
treated with supplements of porcine pancreatic extracts that contain
pancreatic lipase activity. However,
these supplements are needed in high
doses because the duodenums of
many cystic Ô¨Åbrosis patients are more
acidic than in healthy individuals
and denaturation or inhibition of the
enzyme can occur. The treatment is
effective in only 30% of cystic Ô¨Åbrosis
patients and 15‚Äì20% still suffer from
steatorrhea. There is considerable
interest in using recombinant mammalian gastric lipases since these are
resistant to acid damage and inhibition and so should prove a more
effective treatment.

of gastric juice per day from three types of secretory cells. Parietal or oxyntic
cells produce hydrochloric acid (HCl), peptic or chief cells secrete pepsinogen, the precursor of pepsin, and gastric lipase, and mucous cells that secrete
mucus that protects the mucosa lining the stomach from the corrosive action
of the HCl.
The activity of salivary amylase continues within the bolus and is possibly
only inactivated when the bolus contents are completely mixed with the acidic
gastric juice. The pH optimum of lingual lipase is between 3.5 and 6.0 and is
activated in the upper portion of the stomach. Gastric lipase is secreted by the
chief cells of the stomach and also has an acid optimum. About 10 to 30% of
dietary fat may be hydrolyzed in the stomach. However, lipase activity in the
stomach is highest against triacylglycerols with short or medium length fatty
acid residues, which are found in milk, and so may be of most importance in
newborn infants.
Pepsinogen is a weakly-active protease. It has an acid optimum pH, hence the
need for HCl secretion in the stomach. In these conditions, about pH 1 to 2,
protein molecules in the food are denatured making them more susceptible
to digestion. Also, at this pH, pepsinogen molecules act on one another at
specific sites to produce the fully active protease, pepsin (Figure 11.10), that
begins the digestion of the denatured proteins to form shorter polypeptides
and peptides. The denaturation and digestion of proteins reduces the chance
of their absorption and prevents them being immunogenic (Chapter 4). The
watery mixture of gastric juice and partially digested food is called chyme.
The acid also activates intrinsic factor (IF), a glycoprotein secreted by the parietal cells that is needed for absorption of vitamin B12 (Chapter 13). Vitamin B12
is released from dietary proteins by the action of pepsin and binds to one of
two binding proteins present in gastric juice whose affinity for vitamin B12 is
increased in acid conditions and is greater than that of IF. When chyme enters
the small intestine, proteases from pancreatic juice break down the binding
proteins and vitamin B12 becomes bound to IF. The mucosal lining in the ileum
has receptors for IF which bind the IF‚Äìvitamin B12 complex, so that vitamin
B12 is absorbed and enters the portal blood. Given that the absorption of vitamin B12 is dependent upon IF, any condition that decreases the secretion of IF,
for example atrophic gastritis (Section 11.8), interferes with digestion of the
binding proteins, for example pancreatic exocrine insufficiency, or decreases
the binding and internalization of the IF‚Äìvitamin B12 complex, such as some
diseases that affect the ileum, can cause pernicious anemia (Chapter 13).

chyme. The pyloric sphincter controls the passage of chyme from the stomach to the small intestine allowing only relatively small amounts of chyme
through at any one time. This control is necessary because the digestive activity within the small intestine is time-consuming and because its capacity is
limited. The activities of the stomach and small intestine are coordinated by
the nervous and endocrine systems.

SMALL INTESTINE
The final stages of digestion and the absorption of its products occur in the
small intestine (Figure 11.1 (A)). Contractions in the small intestine help to
break food up, mix it with digestive juices and propel it towards the colon.
The small intestine is about 23 feet (7 m) long in an adult. It is divided into
three sections: the duodenum constitutes the first 250 mm, followed by the
jejunum then the ileum. Digestion occurs primarily in the duodenum and
jejunum and absorption in the ileum.
The walls of the duodenum contain goblet cells that secrete mucus that
protects it against damage by acidic chyme. Crypts of Lieberkuhn are pits
within the wall of the small intestine with secretory cells that release intestinal juice and Paneth cells that secrete lysozyme. Intestinal juice is largely
water with mucus and buffered to a pH of about 7.6. Along with pancreatic
juice (see below), it neutralizes chyme and provides a liquid medium that
aids absorption of nutrients. Lysozyme is an antibacterial enzyme. The epithelial lining consists of cells called enterocytes organized into small projections into the lumen called villi (Figure 11.11). In turn, each enterocyte

DISORDERS OF THE GASTROINTESTINAL TRACT, PANCREAS, LIVER AND GALL BLADDER

BOX 11.2 Cyclic vomiting syndrome
Vomiting or emesis is the expulsion of food from the stomach
(and sometimes duodenum) through the esophagus and mouth.
It is usually experienced as the Ô¨Ånal of three events, nausea,
retching and vomition. Nausea is an unpleasant psychic experience associated with decreased gastric motility and increased
muscle tone in the small intestine. Additionally, there is often
reverse peristalsis in the proximal small intestine. Retching or
dry heaves is the spasmodic respiratory movements conducted
with a closed glottis. While this is occurring, the antrum of the
stomach contracts and the fundus and cardia relax. Vomition is
when the contents of the stomach and sometimes small intestine
are propelled up to and out of the mouth.
Vomiting can be initiated by a variety of stimuli, including infections (gastroenteritis), various chemical irritants (emetics) and
poisons, distension of the stomach, unpleasant sights and
smells, dizziness, anesthetics, a number of drugs, a variety of
illnesses, for example brain tumors, and hormonal changes associated with pregnancy. All result in nervous impulses being sent
to a vomiting center in the medulla oblongata, which responds
by sending motor impulse to muscles of the upper GIT, diaphragm and abdominal muscles (Figure 11.12). The resulting
contractions squeeze the stomach between the diaphragm and
abdominal muscles and expel its contents. A simple episode of
vomiting rarely causes problems but may on occasion have more
serious consequences, such as aspiration pneumonia. However,
severe or repetitive vomiting results in disturbances to acid‚Äìbase
balance, electrolyte depletion and dehydration. In such cases,
the underlying cause must be rapidly identiÔ¨Åed and appropriate therapy initiated. In many cases antiemetic drugs must be
administered to suppress vomiting and reduce its sequelae.
Cyclic vomiting syndrome (CVS) or abdominal migraine is a
disorder of the GIT characterized by recurrent, severe and pro-

Ô¨Årst described by Gee in 1882. It usually occurs in children of
two to 16 years old, most commonly between the ages of three

has its apical plasma membrane surface, which is the side facing the lumen
of the GIT, arranged into microscopic extensions called microvilli forming
a brush border that coats the villi (Figure 11.13). The opposing face of the
enterocyte is called the basolateral membrane. The presence of villi and
microvilli means that the interior surface area of the small intestine is enormous, estimated at 300 m2 in humans. Hydrolytic enzymes that are integral
proteins of the plasma membranes forming the microvilli catalyze further
digestive reactions. For example: lactose is hydrolyzed to glucose and galactose in a reaction catalyzed by lactase; sucrose to glucose and fructose by
sucrase; and the disaccharides maltose and isomaltose, produced by the
action of amylase on starch, are hydrolyzed to glucose by maltase and isomaltase activities (Table 11.1).
Pancreatic juice is produced by the pancreas and contains water, alkaline salts
that give it a pH of 7.8 to 8.0, enzymes and zymogens (Margin Note 11.4) and

DIGESTION

Cyclic vomiting syndrome occurs in four distinct phases. First,
there is a prodrome phase, which is often accompanied by
abdominal pain, and which signals that an episode of nausea and vomiting is about to begin. This can last a few minutes to several hours. However, sometimes a prodrome does
not occur and patients enter the second phase, an episode,
directly. Episodes consist of nausea followed by severe vomiting, which usually begin at night or Ô¨Årst thing in the morning. Abdominal pain, dizziness, headaches, photosensitivity,
fever and sometimes diarrhea may also present. Vomiting can
be as frequent as six to 12 times an hour during the worst
of the episode and can continue for one to Ô¨Åve days during
which the patient appears pale, listless and exhausted, often
to the point of near unconsciousness. The third or recovery
phase begins when the nausea and vomiting stop. Generally,
appetite and energy return but the time required for this
varies considerably. The fourth phase is the symptomless interval between episodes.
Episodes are triggered by speciÔ¨Åc events or conditions, most
commonly infections such as colds and inÔ¨Çuenza, but also emotional stress, excitement, allergies eating certain foods, for example chocolate or cheese, overeating, excessively hot weather and
physical exhaustion. Motion sickness and menstruation can also
trigger episodes.
The severity of vomiting in CVS is a risk factor for a number of
complications, the most obvious being dehydration and electrolyte imbalance, which are described in Chapter 8. Other complications include peptic esophagus caused by stomach acid
in the vomit, hematemesis, which is blood in the vomit from
the damaged esophagus, a Mallory-Weiss tear of the lower end
of the esophagus or the stomach may bruise from violent and
prolonged vomiting or retching. Finally, tooth corrosion can be

caused by stomach acid in a manner similar to that seen in bulimics (Chapter 10).
Cyclic vomiting syndrome is difÔ¨Åcult to diagnose and many
patients are initially misdiagnosed. It is usually identiÔ¨Åed from
the general symptoms and medical history and by excluding more common diseases or disorders that can also cause
nausea and vomiting. Diagnosis is time consuming because
a repeating pattern of vomiting must be established. There is
no cure for CVS. Avoiding known triggers of an episode is an
obvious remedy but they cannot always be avoided. Ibuprofen
taken in the prodrome phase may help prevent or alleviate
an episode. Once an episode begins, treatment is supportive
with bed rest and sleep in a dark, quiet room. Other medications that may be helpful are ranitidine or omeprazole which
decrease the amount of acid produced. Severe nausea and
vomiting may require hospitalization and intravenous Ô¨Çuids to
prevent dehydration, since drinking water normally promotes
more vomiting although it does dilute the acid in the vomit,
making the episode less painful. Sedatives may help if the
nausea continues. Drinking water and replacing lost electrolytes is essential in the recovery phase.
Cyclic vomiting syndrome and migraine show a number of similarities and the two may be related. Like CVS, migraine is characterized by headaches that begin and end abruptly, followed by
longer periods without pain or other symptoms. They both have
a number of similar triggers, including stress and excitement.
Many children with CVS have a family history of migraine or suffer migraine attacks as they grow older. Given these similarities,
CVS patients subject to frequent and long-lasting episodes are
treated with some success using propranolol, cyproheptadine
and amitriptyline that are generally used for treating migraine
headaches.

enters the small intestine through the pancreatic duct. The salts neutralize
acid from the stomach.
Proteolytic enzymes can be divided into exopeptidases and endopeptidases.
The exopeptidases are aminopeptidases and carboboxypeptidases that catalytically remove amino acids from the ends of proteins and peptides (Figure
11.14 (A)). The pancreatic proteases, elastase, trypsin and chymotrypsin, are
endoproteases (Figure 11.14 (B)) and hydrolyze proteins and peptides at different peptide bonds throughout the molecules to produce peptides and
amino acids. The actions of endopeptidases increase the number of protein
ends, effectively increasing the concentration of substrates for the exopeptidases. Pancreatic amylase continues the digestion of polysaccharides to produce disaccharides. Pancreatic lipase (Figure 11.15) hydrolyzes lipids to fatty
acids and 2-monoacylglycerols but requires the presence of colipase, another
protein secreted by the pancreas, for full activity. Bile released from the gall
bladder enters the intestine through the bile duct and emulsifies lipids into
droplets of about 1 Lm diameter, which greatly increases the surface area
available for lipase activity. Pancreatic esterase activity can complete the
digestion to glycerol and free fatty acids (Figure 11.16).

11.4 ABSORPTION OF THE PRODUCTS OF DIGESTION
The large surface area of the small intestine allows the rapid absorption of the
products of digestion. The enzymes concerned with the final stages of digestion of a number of nutrients are located in the brush border of the enterocytes as described in Section 11.3 or even within their cytoplasm. This ensures
that the final products of digestion are produced near or within the absorptive surface of the GIT. Enterocytes are joined together by tight junctions that
ensure material cannot leak from the lumen. Absorption by enterocytes is
largely active and selective and they have a high metabolic rate because the
transport of materials across their membranes requires considerable amounts
of metabolic energy. A membrane-bound Na+/K+-ATPase uses a major proportion of this energy to catalyze the hydrolysis of ATP in the presence of Na+
and K+. The free energy from the hydrolysis is used to expel three Na+ from the
cell and to pump two K+ into the cell. This may be summarized as:

Since both Na+ and K+ are being transported against their electrochemical
gradients both movements are an active transport. Also, since more positive
charges are being pumped out of the cell than are entering it, the effect contributes to the potential difference across the membrane, called the resting
membrane potential, of about ‚Äì60 mV, the inside of the cell being negative

with respect to the outside. The membrane potential of the apical membrane
of the enterocyte can be harnessed to facilitate the uptake of a variety of nutrients from the lumen of the GIT. Both amino acids and monosaccharides are
transported across the enterocyte luminal membrane in a Na+-dependent
fashion. A variety of different membrane transporter proteins are responsible
for the absorption of specific sugars and different groups of amino acids.
Glucose and galactose are transported across the enterocyte luminal membrane in an active, Na+-dependent fashion by the same transporter. One molecule of these sugars can only move through the transporter into the cell if
Na+ ions move in at the same time (Figure 11.17). The concentrations of the
sugars can build up within the cytoplasm, such that they are able to leave the
cell through the basolateral membrane by facilitated diffusion. Other monosaccharides, for example fructose and trehalose, are absorbed only by facilitated diffusion and are absorbed to a much lesser extent.
The major initial products of protein digestion are small peptides and these
are absorbed by enterocytes of the jejunum at their luminal surfaces by peptide transporter protein, called the PepT1 (Figure 11.18). This occurs in a H+dependent fashion that resembles the uptake of glucose and galactose. Within
the cytoplasm, the peptides are hydrolyzed to amino acids, ensuring a continuous sink is present to facilitate peptide uptake by the cells. The exit of the
amino acids from the cells on the basolateral side also occurs down their concentration gradients. However, as peptides are moved further along the GIT,
they are hydrolyzed by peptidases to free amino acids and their absorption
occurs in the ileum using a number of Na+-dependent transporters (Figure
11.18), which have specificities for different amino acid side chains. Peptides

can also be absorbed by a paracellular route where they pass between enterocytes, rather than being absorbed across the luminal surface. Relatively large
peptides can be absorbed by this method and may initiate an allergic reaction
leading to food allergies (Chapter 5 and 10).
Digestion of RNA produces nucleotides that are further degraded to nucleosides at the brush border and which, again, are absorbed in a Na+-dependent
manner. Catabolism within the cytoplasm converts the nucleotides to ribose
phosphate and bases. Eventually the purine bases are converted to urate and
the pyrimidines to uracil as shown in Figure 11.19.
Fatty acids, monoacylglycerols, monoacylphospholipids and cholesterol are
absorbed as mixed micelles by the brush border of the enterocytes (Figure
11.20). The triacylglycerols and phospholipids are reformed within the enterocyte cytoplasm and packaged into large lipoprotein complexes called chylomicrons (Chapter 14) that are transported from the GIT in lacteals of the
lymphatic system. This ensures the lipids bypass the liver and are delivered to
the blood through the thoracic duct.
Water-soluble vitamins are taken up by enterocytes by a variety of mechanisms. Vitamins B1 (thiamin) and B2 (riboflavin) are absorbed in the upper
portion of the small intestine. Thiamin is actively transferred to the portal
system. Specific transporter proteins actively accumulate niacin (nicotinic
acid and nicotinamide), folic acid and biotin (vitamin H) in Na+-dependent
fashions. Pantothenic acid and the vitamers of vitamin B6 are absorbed by
diffusion. Vitamin C is absorbed in the jejunum by a Na+-dependent mechanism, similar to that described for glucose. The fat-soluble vitamins, A, D, E
and K, are absorbed within the mixed micelles of fatty acids, monoacylglyc-

in dietary lipids means that the absorption of fat-soluble vitamins is greatly
reduced.
Many minerals are absorbed in an energy dependent fashion along the
length of the GIT, although Ca2+ and iron are mainly absorbed in the duode-

BOX 11.3 Hartnup‚Äôs disease
Hartnup‚Äôs disease, also known as Hartnup disorder, Hartnup
aminoaciduria or Hartnup syndrome, was Ô¨Årst named by Baron
and coworkers in 1956 from a disorder that affected the Hartnup
family of London. Hartnup disease is inherited as an autosomal
recessive trait (Chapter 15), particularly where consanguinity is
common. It arises from mutations to SLC6A19, a gene located
on chromosome 5, whose product, a sodium-dependent neutral amino acid transporter, is expressed mainly in the GIT and
kidneys. The defective gene product impairs the absorption of
tryptophan and other neutral amino acids, such as valine, phenylalanine, leucine, isoleucine, across the brush border membranes
of the small intestine and renal tubular epithelium. Two tissuespeciÔ¨Åc forms have been described; one affects both the GIT and
kidneys, the other only the kidneys. The abnormality in amino
acid transport can lead to deÔ¨Åciencies in neutral amino acids;
the defective absorption of tryptophan may result in a niacin

'.'

deÔ¨Åciency (Chapter 10). The condition clinically resembles pellagra and may be misdiagnosed as a dietary deÔ¨Åciency of niacin.
Tryptophan is retained within the GIT lumen and converted by
bacteria to toxic indole compounds. Tubular renal transport is
also defective and contributes to gross aminoaciduria. Hartnup‚Äôs
disease has an overall prevalence of 1 in 18 000 to 42 000 and,
although rare, this makes it among the commonest of amino
acid disorders.
Hartnup‚Äôs disease usually begins at three to nine years of age
but it may present as early as 10 days after birth. Most patients
are asymptomatic but poor nutrition leads to more frequent and
severe attacks. Patients present with pellagra-like light-sensitive
rash, aminoaciduria, cerebellar ataxia, emotional instability, neurological and psychiatric symptoms that may considerably diminish their quality of life. Mental retardation and short stature have

num. Dietary iron occurs in nonheme and heme forms and their absorption
by duodenal enterocytes is by different mechanisms. Dietary nonheme iron
occurs in ferrous (Fe(II)2+) and ferric (Fe(III)3+) forms. Ferrous iron is soluble up to a pH of about 7 but the predominant form, ferric iron, is sparingly
soluble above pH 3 and is not available for absorption and must be reduced
before it can be transported across the intestinal epithelium. A ferrireductase

been described in some patients. Malnutrition and a low-protein
diet are the primary contributing factors to morbidity. In rare
cases, severe central nervous system (CNS) damage may lead to
death.
Plasma concentrations of amino acids are usually normal in
Hartnup‚Äôs disease. However, it may be diagnosed by demonstrating increased concentrations of neutral amino acids, such
as tryptophan, glutamine, valine, phenylalanine, leucine and
isoleucine in the urine, with normal levels of proline, hydroxyproline and arginine, which differentiates Hartnup‚Äôs disease from
other causes of gross aminoaciduria. Other tryptophan metabolites, including kynurenine and serotonin, are also found in the
urine and neutral amino acids occur in the feces. Urinary indole
derivatives, for example 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid, may be

CZhhVg6]bZY!BVjgZZc9Vlhdc!8]g^hHb^i]:YLddY

demonstrated following an oral tryptophan load (Chapter 10).
In selected patients, diagnosis may require the transport defect
be identiÔ¨Åed in vitro using a jejunal sample obtained by biopsy.
Most patients can be treated with a high-protein diet which overcomes the deÔ¨Åcient transport of neutral amino acids because
dipeptides can be actively absorbed as shown in Figure 11.18
and by paracellular routes. Indeed, in the developed world,
cases presenting with extreme clinical symptoms are rare probably because of the protein rich diet available. Patients who are
symptomatic are advised to avoid excessive exposure to sunlight
and use sunscreens with a skin protection factor of at least 15.
Dietary supplements of 40 to 200 mg niacin daily relieve the
pellagra-like symptoms. Psychiatric treatment may help patients
with severe CNS damage.

called Dcytb bound to the brush border of enterocytes reduces ferric iron to
the ferrous form. Ferrous iron is then transported into the cell by a H+ coupled
mechanism as illustrated in Figure 11.21. The transporter, called the divalent
metal transporter 1 (DMT1), is also able to effect the absorption of a number
of other divalent metal ions, such as those of cadmium, cobalt copper, lead,
nickel and zinc. Heme iron is absorbed into the enterocyte by a heme receptor
and, once internalized, its ferrous iron is released into the intracellular pool
by heme oxygenase activity (Figure 11.21). Ferrous iron is exported from the
enterocyte across the basal membrane by a membrane protein called ferroportin1 or Ireg1. It is then oxidized by hephaestin, a transmembrane copper
dependent ferroxidase, which is necessary for effective iron transport. The
ferric iron is bound by transferrin in the plasma and can be stored in erythrocytes in ferritin molecules (Chapter 13).
Calcium is absorbed in the upper part of the small intestine in an ionic form.
This absorption requires the active metabolite of vitamin D, 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3, and is inhibited by substances that form insoluble calcium salts,
such as phosphate and oxalate. The uptake of Na+ has been mentioned already
in relation to the active uptake of several nutrients and many anions, hydrogen carbonate, chloride and iodide, can passively follow it into enterocytes.
Phosphate is actively accumulated by enterocytes.
Amino acids, monosaccharides, urate and uracil, B vitamins, vitamin C and
minerals all leave the enterocytes through their basolateral membranes,
enter the hepatic portal vein and are delivered to the liver. Following their
absorption, many minerals are bound by intracellular proteins before being
expelled through the basolateral membrane into the bloodstream where they

Approximately 9 dm3 of fluid pass through the GIT each day. Reabsorption of
water from the GIT is essential to prevent dehydration. Most, about 95%, is

11.5 ACTIVITIES OF THE LARGE INTESTINE
The large intestine is so named because its diameter is greater than that of the
small intestine though it is, in fact, much the shorter of the two. Fluid, containing the unabsorbed products of digestion, directly enters from the small
intestine at a junction that is also the site of the vestigial cecum and appendix (Figure 11.22). Absorption of Na+ and water occurs over the surface of the
large intestine, which also acts as a reservoir for material resistant to digestion by GIT enzymes. However, bacterial action on this material releases some
nutrients from food, for example certain vitamins as well as about 200‚Äì2000
cm3 of gas in 10‚Äì14 episodes per day. The final waste together with bacteria
forms the feces, which passes to the last section of the GIT, the rectum, and is
eliminated through the anus. Two sphincter muscles control elimination: the
first of smooth muscle opens involuntarily in response to pressure within the
rectum; the second is controlled voluntarily and allows for a conscious decision to defecate.

Large intestine

11.6 THE SMALL INTESTINE AND HOMEOSTASIS
Within enterocytes a portion of the monosaccharides absorbed are converted
to lactate by glycolysis. Excess nonessential amino acids, especially glutamine,
are used to synthesize alanine and ammonia (Figure 11.23). These products are
then delivered to the liver in the hepatic portal vein. Converting some of the
absorbed nutrients to lactate and alanine reduces the metabolic load on the
liver because it can easily regenerate pyruvate from them. Pyruvate is a versatile liver metabolite; it is a substrate for the TCA cycle, allowing the formation
of ATP during oxidative phosphorylation but it can be used for the biosynthesis of glucose and glycogen, ketone bodies, fatty acids and all but two of the
nonessential fatty acids and cholesterol. The GIT is a significant contributor
to nutrient homeostasis both during and after nutrient absorption because
the formation of lactate and alanine continues even when absorption ceases.

11.7 HORMONAL CONTROL OF GIT SECRETIONS
The GIT produces a large number of hormones many of whose functions are
not well understood, although some of them, together with neuronal activities, are concerned with coordinating the secretions of various digestive juices.
Endocrine cells are scattered throughout the entire GIT in clusters forming a
diffuse portion of the endocrine system (Chapter 7). Over 25 peptides have
been extracted and characterized from the GIT. No deficiency states are
known for any of these peptides although hormone-secreting tumors have
been described.
The G cells in the antral and pyloric regions of the stomach produce gastrin.
Gastrin occurs in a number of molecular forms, for example gastrin17 and gastrin34 are composed of 17 and 34 amino acid residues respectively. Gastrin17 is
the most active and has a half-life of about 8 min. Its precursor, gastrin34, has a
half-life of approximately 40 min. The release of gastrin is stimulated by food
entering the stomach from the esophagus and its function is, in turn, to stimulate release of gastric juice. Gastric inhibitory peptide (GIP) is a peptide of 43
amino acid residues secreted by the duodenum and upper jejunum. It stimulates insulin release (Chapter 7), reduces the secretions of gastrin and pepsin
and inhibits gastric movements. The hormone, vasoactive intestinal peptide
(VIP) is comprised of 28 amino acid residues. It is released in response to distension of the GIT by food. It stimulates the contraction of smooth muscle
tissues of the GIT wall and pancreatic exocrine secretions and it also inhibits
gastrin and gastric acid release. Pancreatic polypeptide is formed, as its name
implies, by the pancreas and inhibits pancreatic hydrogen carbonate and protein secretions. Secretin is also produced in the duodenum and jejunum. It is
a 27-amino acid residue peptide with a half-life of 17 min. Its release is triggered by acid from the stomach and it functions to stimulate the release of

'.+

DISORDERS OF THE GIT AND ACCESSORY ORGANS

pancreatic juice, the hydrogen carbonate of which helps neutralize the acid
in chyme. Glucose-dependent insulinotrophic polypeptide (gastric inhibitory
polypeptide) is also released in the duodenum and jejunum. It inhibits the
secretion of gastric acid and stimulates insulin secretion. Mucosal cells in the
upper region of the small intestine secrete cholecystokinin (CCK). Two molecular forms are produced consisting of 33 and 39 amino acid residues respectively. The release of CCK is stimulated by peptides and fatty acids in the food
and, in turn, stimulates the release of pancreatic juice and contractions of the
gall bladder. Motilin is a 22 amino acid residue peptide that is structurally
unrelated to any other GIT hormone produced in the upper small intestine. It
controls GIT movements during fasting. The ileum and colon produce peptide
YY and neurotensin. The former decreases pancreatic and gastric secretions,
while the latter may regulate peristalsis of the ileum. The hormone called substance P is produced along the entire GIT. Its functions include stimulating
the secretion of saliva and it is also involved in the vomit reflex.

11.8 DISORDERS OF THE GIT AND ACCESSORY ORGANS
Disorders of the GIT and its accessory organs can affect the mouth, esophagus, stomach, pancreas, liver, bile duct, small and large intestines. Some of the
disorders affect the exocrine pancreas, liver, stomach, small and large intestines.

DISORDERS OF THE EXOCRINE PANCREAS
Acute pancreatitis is a severe, rapid inflammation of the pancreas with varying
degrees of edema (Chapter 8), hemorrhage (Chapter 13) and tissue necrosis.
It arises because of an inappropriate activation of pancreatic enzymes which
then autodigest pancreatic tissue. Normally, these enzymes are inactive until
they reach the duodenum. The cause of acute pancreatitis is unclear, although
excessive alcohol intake is believed to have a major role, but viral infections,
drug reactions and pancreatic cancer have also been implicated. The clinical
features of acute pancreatitis include attacks of severe abdominal pain that
may extend to the back, vomiting, fever and shock. The leakage of pancreatic
enzymes into the bloodstream from damaged tissue and a demonstration of
increased plasma amylase activity aids in diagnosis. Typically, there is a fivefold rise in plasma amylase activity over the first two days of an attack that
returns to normal within three to five days. Treatment is symptomatic and
aimed at maintaining circulation and fluid volume and decreasing pain with
analgesics.
Chronic pancreatitis is a slow, progressive destruction of pancreatic tissue
accompanied by inflammation and fibrosis. Like acute pancreatitis, the damage is believed to be due to autodigestion of pancreatic tissue by the activation
of enzymes in situ. Excessive alcohol intake is the leading cause of chronic
pancreatitis although many cases are idiopathic. Clinical features of chronic
pancreatitis include severe and persistent abdominal pain, weight loss, malabsorption and hyperglycemia. Complications of chronic pancreatitis include
diabetes mellitus (Chapter 7). Chronic pancreatitis is investigated using X-ray
examination of the pancreas to reveal calcification that may result from the
release of free fatty acids following the breakdown of fats and by examining
the feces to detect steatorrhea. Treatment is directed toward management of
pain and rectifying the nutritional disorders that arise from malabsorption
(see below).
A number of tests are available to assess pancreatic function. The most widely
used is the fluorescein dilaurate test which indirectly assesses the activity of
pancreatic enzymes. The patient is given an oral dose of the synthetic ester,
fluorescein dilaurate, that is hydrolyzed to release fluorescein by pancreatic

cholesterol esterase. Fluorescein, but not fluorescein dilaurate, is absorbed
by the small intestine and transported to the liver where it is converted to
fluorescein glucuronide, which is then excreted in the urine. The latter can
be detected by its characteristic fluorescence. The test is controlled for variations in intestinal absorption, hepatic conjugation and renal excretion by
repeating the test the next day but using an oral dose of fluorescein. The ratio
of fluorescein excreted after administration of fluorescein dilaurate to that
excreted after administration of free fluorescein is greater than 0.3 in normal
individuals. However, a ratio less than 0.2 is indicative of abnormal pancreatic
function. Ratios between 0.2 and 0.3 are inconclusive. Other investigations
of pancreatic function include the para-aminobenzoic acid (PABA) test in
which the patient is given 0.5 g of the synthetic peptide, benzoyltyrosylaminobenzoic acid (BTPABA). This is hydrolyzed to PABA in the small intestine by
pancreatic chymotrypsin (Figure 11.24). Following its absorption, the PABA is
excreted unchanged in the urine. The patient is also given a known amount of
radioactively labeled PABA (14C-PABA) to correct for variations in the absorption, metabolism and excretion of PABA formed from BTPABA. The amount
of PABA found in the urine is a measure of the activity of pancreatic chymotrypsin. There is reduced excretion of urinary PABA in individuals with abnormal pancreatic function.

DISORDERS OF THE LIVER, GALL BLADDER AND BILE DUCT
Jaundice is the yellow discoloration of tissues due to an accumulation of
bilirubin (Figure 11.5). Many disorders of the liver give rise to jaundice,
although clinical jaundice may not be seen until the concentration of bilirubin
in the serum is greater than 50 ¬µmol dm‚Äì3. The causes of jaundice can be prehepatic, hepatic or posthepatic.
The causes of prehepatic jaundice include hemolysis, where there is an
increased breakdown of hemoglobin producing large amounts of bilirubin
that overloads the conjugating mechanism. Such bilirubin is mostly uncon-

DISORDERS OF THE GIT AND ACCESSORY ORGANS

jugated and commonly occurs in newborn babies. If the concentration of
serum bilirubin approaches 200 ¬µmol dm‚Äì3, then phototherapy (Chapter 6
and Margin Note 11.5) is used to degrade it, otherwise its high concentration may cause damage to the brain called kernicterus. Other causes of prehepatic hyperbilirubinemia include hemolytic disease of the newborn due
to Rhesus incompatibility (Chapter 6) and ineffective erythropoiesis, which
occurs in pernicious anemia (Chapter 13). The commonest causes of hepatic
hyperbilirubinemia are viral hepatitis and paracetamol (acetaminophen)
poisoning (Chapter 12). There is also physiological jaundice of the newborn,
a mild unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia that develops because of low activity of UDP-glucuronyltransferase, following birth. Activity increases within
two weeks and the jaundice disappears. Other causes include Gilbert‚Äôs and
Criggler-Najjar syndromes. In Gilbert‚Äôs syndrome, the affected individuals
have an inherited partial deficiency of hepatic UDP-glucuronyltransferase.
Patients present with a mild jaundice and occasionally suffer from abdominal discomfort but otherwise the condition is harmless. Fasting, infection,
stress and excessive alcohol intake may aggravate the symptoms. Treatment
of Gilbert‚Äôs syndrome is by administration of phenobarbitone to stimulate
glucuronyltransferase activity. Criggler-Najjar syndrome is a rare hereditary
disorder characterized by a complete absence of glucuronyltransferase activity from birth. Patients suffer from severe unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia.
Treatment using phototherapy in affected newborns may temporarily reduce
the unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia but infants generally die within one
year of birth.

Margin Note 11.5 Phototherapy
for jaundice in newborns

i

Phototherapy is the most common
way of treating jaundice in newborn
children. It involves exposing the baby
to blue light (400‚Äì500nm). This is
absorbed by the bilirubin, degrading
it to a form that is more water soluble
and can be excreted in the feces and
urine. A baby with jaundice may need
repeated phototherapy over several
days.

One of the causes of posthepatic hyperbilirubinemia is cholestasis where there
is failure of bile to reach the small intestine. Cholesterol is virtually insoluble
in water and is maintained in an aqueous environment in vesicles combined
with phospholipids and bile salts. In normal conditions, the vesicles maintain
the concentration of cholesterol in bile near its saturation point. Cholesterol
monohydrate crystals form when the ratio of cholesterol, phospholipids and
bile salts exceeds the normal range and results in the formation of gallstones
in a process termed cholelithiasis. Eighty per cent of gallstones are composed
largely of cholesterol; the remaining 20% consist of calcium and bilirubin.
They vary in size from that of a grain of sand to the diameter of a golf ball. In
many cases, the smaller stones can be excreted in the bile duct without causing harm. Larger gallstones usually cause abdominal pain and are so large
that they obstruct the flow of bile into the small intestine. However, in some
cases gallstones may exist for years without causing any symptoms. When
there is a complete blockage, there is little or no urobilinogen in the feces,
which are pale colored due to absence of stercobilinogens. When the blockage is removed, urobilinogen becomes detectable in the urine and the feces
regain their normal color. Occasionally intrahepatic obstruction arises where
a blockage affects the bile canaliculi in liver cirrhosis (Chapter 12) or cancer
(Chapter 17). This type of blockage causes an increase in the concentration of
conjugated bilirubin in the serum.
It is essential to determine whether the cause of the increased amounts of
conjugated bilirubin is intra- or extrahepatic because it is of diagnostic significance and determines the subsequent treatment. The degree of obstruction
to the flow of bile is usually greater in extrahepatic cholestasis. Extrahepatic
cholestasis may benefit from surgery to remove the gall bladder or to remove
the gallstone. Nonsurgical treatments are preferred because surgery can be
hazardous. Oral dissolution therapy with ursodiol and chenodiol, which are
derived from bile salts, is effective in treating small, predominantly cholesterol gallstones. Treatment may be required for months to years before the
gallstones are dissolved but is preferred in patients who cannot undergo surgery. In some cases, gallstones may be broken down using ultrasound waves
to smaller particles that can easily be excreted.

BOX 11.4 Pregnancy, cholelithiasis and cholestasis
Cholelithiasis, or the presence of gallstones, in the gall bladder
(Figure 11.25) has a general incidence one in 1000 but pregnancy induces changes in the composition of bile that increases
its frequency up to six in 100. For example, in the second trimester the bile salt pool generally decreases but biliary cholesterol
levels may increase producing bile that is more prone to form
stones. Additionally, emptying of the gall bladder slows in the
second trimester further increasing the risk of cholelithiasis.

Ray, Southwest Tennessee Community College, USA.

The symptoms of cholelithiasis are similar in pregnant and nonpregnant patients and may present as pain in the middle of the
upper abdomen, which can become more severe on eating fatty
foods, jaundice and fever. Symptoms usually occur only when the
stones block one of the ducts in the biliary system. Cholelithiasis
is frequently asymptomatic and often the stones are only discovered by routine X-ray examination, surgery or at autopsy. An
ultrasound examination of the liver is helpful in determining the

presence of gallstones. Surgical treatment can be safely accomplished in the Ô¨Årst or second trimester but should be avoided during the third trimester because of the enlargement of the uterus.
Obstetric cholestasis (OC) or cholestasis of pregnancy is a liver
disorder where the Ô¨Çow of bile from the liver in pregnant women
is reduced. It has a reported incidence of one in 10 000 pregnancies in the USA. There is some evidence for a genetic link with
OC. It also has an ethnic predisposition since it occurs in 0.01
to 0.02% of pregnancies in north America, but 1 to 1.5% in
Sweden and 5 to 21% in Chile but is rare in black patients.
Typically OC presents in the third trimester but can occur as
early as the thirteenth week. In 80% of patients it presents with
severe pruritus (itching), with jaundice developing in the remaining 20% showing typical dark urine and light colored stools. In a
normal pregnancy itching is not uncommon and is thought to be
related to hormonal changes and stretching of the skin over the
stomach as the baby grows. However, in OC the itching generally
begins elsewhere, especially on arms, legs, hands and soles of
the feet, face, back and breasts. It is usually worse at night, leading to sleeplessness and exhaustion, and can be of such intensity
that scratching draws blood. The itching completely disappears
within a week or two of the birth and does not cause long-term
health problems for the mother but the condition is associated
with increased health risks to the fetus. For example, studies in
the USA have shown that intrahepatic OC is associated with a
12 to 44% incidence of prematurity, a 16 to 25% incidence of
fetal distress and increases the perinatal mortality rate from 1.3
to 3.5%.

Acute hepatitis is caused by infection and subsequent inflammation of the
liver, where liver cells are destroyed and the liver becomes necrotic. The commonest cause is viral infections, for example with hepatitis A, B, C, D and E
viruses, although drugs, toxins and autoimmune reactions can also lead to
acute hepatitis. The initial symptoms of acute viral hepatitis include malaise,
anorexia, fever, rashes, abdominal pain, dark urine and jaundice.
Hepatitis A virus causes a mild hepatitis where patients recover usually with
no complications. The virus is transmitted by contaminated food or drink,
especially where sanitation is poor. Following an incubation period of 15 to
40 days, the patient develops fever, sickness and, shortly afterwards, jaundice. Hepatitis B virus is more serious with a mortality rate of 5‚Äì20% although
most patients gradually recover. Hepatitis B virus spreads from one person
to another via body fluids, such as blood, saliva, semen, vaginal fluids, tears,
breast milk and urine. Transmission may occur during sexual activity with
an infected person and vertically from an infected mother to the baby. It is
commonly present in drug addicts. The symptoms develop suddenly after an
incubation period of one to six months and include fever, chills, weakness
and jaundice. In contrast to other types of hepatitis, more than 80% of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infections cause chronic liver disease. Approximately 170
million people worldwide may be infected with HCV. This infection is mild
in the early stages and is often only diagnosed when it has already caused
severe liver damage. For this reason, infection with HCV has been referred
to as the ‚Äòsilent epidemic‚Äô. Blood transfusions were the commonest means of

DISORDERS OF THE GIT AND ACCESSORY ORGANS

The pathophysiology of intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy
remains poorly understood and unfortunately no one knows
why babies are at risk of being stillborn. One possibility is that
the liver cannot cope with the increased amounts of hormones
produced during pregnancy, which reduces the Ô¨Çow of bile leading to a build up of bile salts in the blood.
In addition to a complete medical history and physical examination, generalized severe itching without a rash is often the Ô¨Årst
clue to diagnosis of OC. This can be conÔ¨Årmed by liver function
tests (LFTs) and serum bile acid tests; the latter is the most sensitive test. Normally the amounts of bile acids in blood increases
before the LFTs can detect any changes. Blood tests to check
blood clotting in OC are necessary prior to birth and patients may
require extra vitamin K since a lack of the vitamin may decrease
the effectiveness of clotting and increase blood loss during the
birth (Chapter 13). Patients with OC require cardiotocography,
that is monitoring the heartbeat of the fetus over a set period of
time, ultrasound scans and blood tests. Some pregnant women
may be hospitalized to evaluate the progress of the fetus. Close
fetal surveillance at delivery is also desirable.
Following a diagnosis of OC, patient care involves giving general support. SpeciÔ¨Åc treatments are determined by the medical
history, overall health and tolerance of the patient to speciÔ¨Åc
medications and by the severity of the disease. Resting as much
as possible and eating a well-balanced diet that includes large
amounts of vegetables, fruit and whole wheat cereals, including
bread, may help, as does frequent cold baths, the use of calamine

lotion and loose cotton clothing to relieve the itching. Steroids
may be used to reduce the levels of bile salts in the blood and
relieve the itching. For example, ursodeoxycholic acid at doses
of 15 mg kg‚Äì1 per day helps increase the Ô¨Çow of bile, reduce
the level of bile acids in the blood and ameliorate the pruritus
and is well tolerated by both mother and fetus. Dexamethasone,
another steroid, is sometimes prescribed to increase the maturity of the fetal lungs before delivery and may also help relieve
maternal itching. Parenteral vitamin K supplementation is recommended for patients with prolonged cholestasis and when blood
clotting factors concentrations are abnormal.
Obstetric cholestasis may also increase the mother‚Äôs risk of postpartum hemorrhage. If the well being of the mother or the fetus
are judged to be at risk, then an early delivery at weeks 37 or
38 may be necessary. There does not appear to be any harmful
effects to babies born to mothers with OC. Maternal symptoms
usually resolve within two days of delivery and the increases in
serum bilirubin and LFTs soon return to normal after delivery.
Obstetric cholestasis is not thought to cause any lasting liver
damage although it may leave the liver more sensitive to normal
changes in the concentration of hormones leading to bouts of
mild itching during the menstrual cycle just before ovulation or
just prior to the start of a period. A consultant obstetrician familiar with the condition should carefully manage any subsequent
pregnancies since the condition recurs in 60 to 70% of cases but
it may not follow the same pattern. For example, the itching may
be more severe and could begin earlier in the pregnancy.

transmission prior to the testing of blood products for HCV. Infections with
hepatitis B and C viruses are associated with liver cancer (Chapter 17). The
hepatitis D virus occurs only with or after infection with hepatitis B virus and
its mode of transmission is identical to that of the B virus. Hepatitis E was initially grouped as a type C virus. It occurs in people who have been to parts of
the world where this virus is endemic, such as India. It is transmitted by water
contaminated with fecal material.
A clinical history of recent blood transfusions or intravenous drug use may all
suggest acute hepatitis. Blood tests based on antigen‚Äìantibody reactions are
conducted to establish the type of virus causing the hepatitis. Many patients
present with proteinuria and bilirubinuria and show increased levels of serum
alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity. A liver biopsy will confirm the initial diagnosis. The HCV is treated with @-interferon (Chapter 4), otherwise patients
are advised to take plenty of bed rest with adequate food and fluid intakes. A
serious complication of many cases of acute hepatitis is the development of
chronic hepatitis.
Chronic hepatitis is an inflammation of the liver that persists for more than
six months without improvement. Its causes include autoimmune liver damage, chronic infection with hepatitis B virus and excessive drug and alcohol
use. Chronic hepatitis can be divided into two histological types, namely,
chronic persistent hepatitis, which has a good prognosis, and chronic active
hepatitis that may respond to immunosuppressive or antiviral agents but

often progresses to cirrhosis, leading to death within five years as a result of
liver failure.
Cirrhosis (Chapter 12) is a condition where the liver responds to injury or
death of some of its cells by producing strands of fibrous tissue between
which are nodules of regenerating cells. Patients with cirrhosis may be
asymptomatic for a long period of time before vague symptoms such as
nausea, vomiting, anorexia, weakness, weight loss and edema of the legs
become apparent. Its clinical complications include jaundice, ascites, which
is an abnormal accumulation of fluid in the abdomen, GIT bleeding and
hepatic encephalopathy. Cirrhosis may interfere with intrahepatic circulation causing gradual failure of liver function. Cirrhosis can be divided into
three types, namely, alcoholic, postnecrotic and biliary cirrhosis. Alcoholic
cirrhosis is discussed in Chapter 12.
Postnecrotic cirrhosis accounts for about 25% of all cases of cirrhosis and is
associated with viral infections, the use of certain drugs and poisons. About
25% of postnecrotic cirrhosis cases have a prior history of viral hepatitis.
Unfortunately 75% of all patients with postnecrotic cirrhosis die within one to
five years. Biliary cirrhosis accounts for approximately 15% of all cases of cirrhosis and is characterized by the death of liver cells surrounding bile ducts.
It is most commonly caused by an obstruction of the bile duct leading to an
accumulation of bile within the liver.
Diagnosis of cirrhosis will involve palpation and X-ray of the abdomen, which
often reveal an enlarged liver. A liver biopsy is required to confirm the diagnosis. Other laboratory tests may reveal anemia or hyperbilirubinemia and
liver function tests (LFTs) determine increases in the activities of a number of
enzymes (see below). There are no drugs that can arrest or reverse the fibrotic
process in cirrhosis and treatment is aimed at dealing with the underlying
cause, for example alcohol abuse or biliary obstruction and by treating any
complications.
A number of plasma enzyme activities are used to assess liver function,
including those of aspartate transaminase (AST), alanine transaminase (ALT),
alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and F-glutamyltranspeptidase (GGT). Alanine
transaminase is present in both the cytosol and mitochondria of hepatocytes
whereas ALT is found only in the cytosol. Liver cell damage releases these
enzymes increasing their levels in the plasma. Alanine transaminase is specific
for the liver whereas AST is also found in pancreatic and skeletal and cardiac
muscle tissues. In hepatocellular damage, levels of AST and ALT may increase
tenfold but in obstructions of the bile duct or cholestasis, the increases may be
relatively slight, usually no more than two to three times their normal levels.
Alanine transaminase and AST measurements are useful in monitoring the
progress of hepatocellular damage where falling levels suggest an improvement in the disease. Alkaline phosphatase is found on the surface of hepatocytes and in the microvilli of bile ducts but is not specific for liver. Its activity is
increased in cholestasis. In hepatocellular disease, ALP levels may be normal or
slightly raised. Falling plasma levels of ALP suggest a correction of cholestasis
and may be useful for monitoring this defect. Plasma GGT levels are raised in
both hepatocellular disease and cholestasis. Although the test for this enzyme
is sensitive, it is not specific for liver disease as its activity is increased by some
drug therapies and by alcohol. The blood protein albumin is synthesized in
the liver and its concentration in plasma reflects the functional capacity of the
liver. Plasma albumin concentration is low in chronic liver disease but tends
to be normal in the early stages of acute hepatitis.

DISORDERS OF THE STOMACH
Gastritis is the most common disorder affecting the stomach and is characterized by inflammation and erosion of the gastric mucosa. Gastritis is idiopathic

(%'

W^dad\nd[Y^hZVhZ

DISORDERS OF THE GIT AND ACCESSORY ORGANS

in many cases but it can be caused by irritating foods, beverages, ingested
poisons, aspirin and staphylococcal exotoxin (Chapter 2). Gastritis may
present acutely where the patient suffers from GIT bleeding, epigastric pain,
that is pain on or over the stomach area, anorexia and hematemesis or vomiting of blood. Patients with chronic gastritis may have no symptoms except
for epigastric pain. The possibility of exposure to irritating substances must
be determined when assessing the patient‚Äôs clinical history. Gastroscopy, in
which a tube with a camera on its end is passed into the stomach allowing a
direct visualization of its wall, can be used to confirm the diagnosis by revealing inflamed portions of the lining of the stomach. Relief from the symptoms
of gastritis occurs following removal of the irritant substance or treatment of
the underlying cause(s).
Atrophic gastritis is a degenerative stomach disorder characterized by chronic
inflammation of the stomach with atrophy of its mucous membrane lining
(Figure 11.26). This results in loss of gastric glandular cells and their eventual
replacement by nonsecretory and fibrous tissues. Secretions of hydrochloric
acid, pepsin and intrinsic factor are impaired, leading to digestive problems,
vitamin B12 deficiency and megaloblastic anemia. Atrophic gastritis is the
result of long-term damage to the gastric mucosa and is usually detected late
in life. It can be caused by persistent infection with the bacterium Helicobacter
pylori but it can also have an autoimmune origin.
Helicobacter pylori is able to bind to the stomach lining where the bacteria
release urease, which hydrolyzes urea, releasing ammonia that neutralizes the
stomach acid. This allows the bacterium to penetrate into the mucosal layer.
The release of bacterial and inflammatory toxic products by Helicobacter pylori
over time results in increasing gastric mucosal atrophy. Some glandular units
develop an intestinal-type epithelium; others are simply replaced by fibrous
tissue. The loss of gastric mucosa decreases the amount of acid secretion that
increases the gastric pH and leads to a reduced ability to kill bacteria. Ingested
bacteria can survive and reside in the stomach and the upper part of the small
intestine. Infection is usually acquired during childhood and, if left untreated,
progresses over the lifespan of the individual in one of two main ways that
have different pathological consequences. The first is a gastritis that mainly
affects the antrum of the stomach (Figure 11.9). This is the most frequently
observed pattern in Western countries and individuals with peptic ulcers (see
below) usually develop this pattern of gastritis. The second pattern is a more
widespread atrophic gastritis affecting, for example, the corpus, fundus and
antrum with the loss of gastric glands and their partial replacement by an
intestinal-type epithelium. This pattern is observed more often in developing
countries and Asian individuals who develop gastric carcinoma and gastric
ulcers usually present with this pattern of gastritis.

Atrophic gastritis

Figure 11.26 Schematic showing the effects of
atrophic gastritis on the stomach lining.

Autoimmune gastritis is associated with serum anti-intrinsic factor antibodies
that reduce the amount of functioning intrinsic factor. This, in turn, decreases
the availability of vitamin B12 and eventually leads to pernicious anemia
(Chapter 13) in some patients. Cell-mediated immunity also contributes to
the disease because T cell lymphocytes infiltrate the gastric mucosa and contribute to the epithelial cell destruction and resulting gastric atrophy.
Specific data on the incidence of atrophic gastritis are scarse. However, its
prevalence mimics that of its two main causes. In both types, atrophic gastritis develops over many years and is detected later in life. Helicobacter pylori
(Figure 11.27) infects approximately 20% of people younger than 40 years and
50% of those older than 60 years in the developed world. Infection is highly
prevalent in Asia and in developing countries and it is estimated that 50% of
the world‚Äôs population is infected. Thus chronic gastritis is probably extremely
common. In contrast, autoimmune gastritis is a relatively rare condition,
which is most frequently observed in patients of northern European descent

and in African Americans. The prevalence of pernicious anemia resulting from
autoimmune gastritis is estimated to be 127 in 100 000 in the UK.
Chronic gastritis frequently is asymptomatic but can present as nonspecific
abdominal pain. Since gastritis often occurs in severely ill, hospitalized people, its symptoms may be eclipsed by other, more severe symptoms.
Atrophic gastritis cannot be reliably diagnosed by gastroscopy but requires a
microscopic examination of biopsy specimens. Helicobacter pylori infections
are normally diagnosed using serological tests, breath tests or antigen tests
of the feces. Pernicious anemia resulting from autoimmune atrophic gastritis
usually presents in patients approximately 60 years of age.

Treatment of atrophic gastritis is directed at eliminating the causative agent,
to correct complications of the disease and attempt to revert the atrophic
process. When Helicobacter pylori is the causative agent, it can be eradicated using a combination of antimicrobial agents and antisecretory agents
with a success rate of about 90%. Lack of patient compliance and antimicrobial resistance are the most important factors influencing poor outcome.
However, treatment of Helicobacter pylori infection may not lead to a reversal
of existing damage unless started early but may block further progression of
the disease. Some evidence suggests that A-carotene and/or vitamins C and
E may reverse or reduce the risk of atrophic gastritis and/or gastric cancer.
The major complication in patients with autoimmune atrophic gastritis is the
development of pernicious anemia. This requires vitamin B12 replacement
therapy.
Ulcers are perforations of the GIT wall (Figure 11.28), particularly erosions of
the mucosal layer related to cancer, that is, malignant ulcers, or to stomach
acid, that is, peptic ulcers. Ulcers may also be named from their location, for
example esophageal, gastric or stomach and duodenal ulcers. Esophageal
ulcers are usually associated with hiatus hernias (see below) caused by acid
splashing from the stomach into the lower esophagus. Gastric ulcers are relatively rare because the mucosal lining of the stomach is protected from the
acid by a layer of alkaline mucus. They generally occur in patients older than
50 years of age. Duodenal ulcers are five times more common than gastric
ulcers and generally occur in a younger population. More than 90% of ulcers
occur in the duodenal wall, usually after it has been weakened by infection
with Helicobacter pylori. It used to be thought that ulcers were caused by
stress and excessive accumulation of HCl. However, it is now accepted that
their commonest cause is infection with Helicobacter pylori (Figure 11.27)
which can colonize and destroy the mucosal layer.
Peptic ulcers are linked to an increased production of acid and pepsin in
gastric juice or to a reduced protection of the mucosa against gastric juice.
Figure 11.29 illustrates diagrammatically the development of a peptic ulcer.
Lesions that do not extend through the mucosal lining are referred to as erosions. Acute and chronic ulcers penetrate this layer and, in serious cases, may
penetrate the stomach wall. In some patients, blood vessels in the GIT wall
ulcerate and lead to heavy, and in some cases fatal, bleeding. Chronic ulcers
have an associated basal scarring.
Patients with peptic ulcers present with epigastric pain but their diagnosis
is made on clinical grounds, supported by endoscopy, laboratory tests for
assessing acid and pepsin secretion and identification of Helicobacter pylori
infection. Treatment is aimed at eradication of the Helicobacter pylori infection and reducing acid output. Antibiotics (Chapter 3) that effectively suppress symptoms include amoxycillin, clarithromycin, metronidazole and
tetracycline, and they often cure the patient. Bismuth chelate and sucralphate
may also be administered to decrease the synthesis of prostaglandins that
stimulate inflammation. The resulting decrease in acid production by parietal

W^dad\nd[Y^hZVhZ

DISORDERS OF THE GIT AND ACCESSORY ORGANS

cells and the increase in hydrogen carbonate production by mucus secreting
epithelial cells have cytoprotective effects.
Zollinger-Ellison syndrome is a rare disorder that causes massive, multiple
and recurrent peptic ulcers due to the excessive secretion of gastric juice
from tumors affecting the pancreas or duodenum. Approximately 60% of the
tumors are malignant. They are called gastrinomas because they secrete large
amounts of gastrin, hence patients have an increased plasma gastrin concentration and rates of gastric acid secretion greater than 100 compared with normal rates of less than 5 mmol h‚Äì1.
A diagnosis of Zollinger-Ellison syndrome usually requires demonstrating an
increase in the concentration of gastrin in the patient‚Äôs serum, combined with
an increased release of acid in the stomach. However, in about 30% of cases
the plasma gastrin concentration is normal or only slightly above normal. The
pentagastrin test is used to assess the acid output of the stomach. Pentagastrin
is an analog of gastrin that stimulates the release of stomach acid. Acid output
is assessed before and after intramuscular injection of pentagastrin. Patients
with Zollinger-Ellison syndrome have a high basal acid output and pentagastrin causes little further increase. Treatment of Zollinger-Ellison syndrome is
by surgical removal of the gastrinoma.
A hernia is the protrusion of an organ or tissue out of the body cavity in which
it is normally found. A hiatus hernia occurs when the upper part of the stomach is dislocated through the hole, called a hiatus, in the diaphragm, into the
chest. Sliding hiatus hernias occur when the esophagus and stomach both
move upwards so that the top end of the stomach protrudes through the gap
in the diaphragm normally occupied by the esophagus (Figure 11.30 (A)) and
these constitute 90% of cases. The remaining 10% are rolling hiatus hernias
where a portion of the stomach curls upwards adjacent to the esophagus
so that both it and an upper part of the stomach protrude through the gap
(Figure 11.30 (B)). The causes of hiatus hernias are unknown but they may be
due to intra-abdominal pressure or weakening of the gastroesophageal junction caused by trauma or loss of muscle tone. Over 50% of individuals with
hiatus hernia are asymptomatic, but when symptoms do occur, they include
heartburn, which is aggravated by reclining, chest pain, dysphagia, belching,
pain on swallowing hot fluids and a feeling of food sticking in the esophagus.
Although hiatus hernia is not usually serious, it can cause inflammation of
the lower end of the esophagus leading to a back flow of gastric juices; this
is called reflux esophagitis, and it may cause bleeding (perhaps anemia) or a
stricture. Cancer in a hiatus hernia is very rare, but there is a slight increased
risk of it developing in the inflamed area.

DISORDERS OF THE GASTROINTESTINAL TRACT, PANCREAS, LIVER AND GALL BLADDER

Data on the incidence of hiatus hernia are few but the condition increases
with age and is particularly common in overweight middle-aged women
and can also occur during pregnancy. The contents of the GIT are often not
clearly visible by X-rays and diagnosis requires confirmation with a barium
meal. This consists of barium sulfate mixed with liquid and is usually flavored.
The barium in the meal lines the inside of the GIT wall and is visible because
barium is opaque to X-rays making this a useful method for detecting
structural abnormalities of the GIT. The presence of a hiatus hernia can also
be investigated by gastroscopy.
The aim of treatment is to alleviate the symptoms. Losing weight, reducing smoking and coffee and alcohol intakes all help to relieve symptoms.
The patient may be advised to avoid tight or restrictive clothing. Avoiding
food intake before sleep and elevating the head of the bed help in reducing
acid reflux. Medication such as antacids may be prescribed. Surgery is only
used when there is strangulation of the hernia or the symptoms cannot be
controlled.

DISORDERS OF THE SMALL INTESTINE
Lactose intolerance is a condition arising from an inability to express lactase.
It is divided into three categories: congenital alactasia, primary acquired and
secondary acquired lactose intolerance. Congenital alactasia or hypolactasia
is an extremely rare condition and affected babies do not gain weight, are
dehydrated and extremely unwell. Human milk is unsuitable for the baby and
breastfeeding is precluded, which can also cause emotional distress in some
mothers. These babies must be fed dairy-based but lactose-free or lactose-free
soya formulae to survive. Primary acquired lactose intolerance usually occurs
following weaning and before the age of six years and is the normal condition for approximately 70% of the world‚Äôs population, the major exception
being northern Europeans. It is particularly common in Asian communities
and amongst blacks of African origin. Secondary acquired lactose intolerance
occurs as a result of damage to the small intestinal mucosa, for example due
to gastroenteritis, cows milk protein intolerance or celiac disease (see below).
Patients who ingest milk suffer from serious indigestion, nausea and gas,
cramps, bloating and diarrhea because of the action of GIT bacteria on
ingested lactose, the severity varying with the amount of lactose consumed
and the tolerance level of the individual. These rather diffuse symptoms
are often associated with other conditions of the GIT, such as infections
with parasitic helminths (Chapter 2) and the protozoan Giardia (Chapter 3),
inflammatory conditions, for example ulcerative colitis (see below), hormonal
complaints, such as hypo- and hyperthyroidism (Chapter 7) and cancer of the
colon and rectum (Chapter 17). Lactose intolerant patients are able to ingest a
variety of milk products such as cheese, where the lactose has been removed
in the whey, and yoghurt, where it has been fermented to lactate.

Lactase deficiency can be assessed by the hydrogen breath, stool acidity
and lactose tolerance tests. An assay for lactase activity on a tissue sample
following a biopsy of the intestinal mucosa would confirm any diagnosis.
The hydrogen breath test requires the patient to drink a solution containing
50 g of lactose. If lactase is deficient, the sugar is fermented by colonic bacteria
which subsequently produce dihydrogen, some of which will enter the blood
and be excreted at the lung surface. Regular analyses of the breath will show
the increasing amounts of hydrogen (Figure 11.31) in lactose intolerance.
Using the appropriate sugars allows both these tests to be used in diagnosing
other disaccharide intolerances, although genetic intolerances to these are
rather rare. The principle of the stool acidity test is simple: undigested lactose
fermented by bacteria in the colon produces lactate and fatty acids, which
can then be detected in a stool sample. The lactose tolerance test is still per-

DISORDERS OF THE GIT AND ACCESSORY ORGANS

formed but only when other tests are inconclusive since it is more invasive.
The patient is required to fast overnight, then drink a solution containing 50 g
lactose. Several blood samples are taken over a 2-h period and their glucose
concentrations determined. The amount of blood glucose indicates how well
the patient is able to digest lactose. The test must be controlled by repeating
the procedure using 25 g each of glucose and galactose, the constituent monosaccharides of lactose.
The medical history, age, degree of intolerance and overall health of the
patient determine treatment for lactose intolerance. In general, it can be
controlled with an appropriate diet. Adding proprietary products containing
lactase (Figure 11.32) isolated from microorganisms to dairy products prior to
ingestion can also help overcome the problem.
Celiac disease is a genetically determined chronic inflammatory condition
affecting the small intestine and is induced by the ingestion of wheat protein, specifically gluten, and its products. A portion of the gluten molecule
forms an autoimmune complex in the GIT mucosa which stimulates T cells
to aggregate and release toxins that promote lysis of enterocytes (Chapters
4 and 5). This leads to a progressive atrophy and characteristic flattening of
the mucosal villi and microvilli in the upper part of the small intestine (Figure
11.33 (A) and (B)). Celiac disease is a relatively common disorder with a
worldwide prevalence of 1 in 200‚Äì300. The mucosa improves morphologically
when the patient is placed on a gluten-free diet but relapses occur if gluten
is reintroduced in the diet. Celiac disease is accompanied by malabsorption
of nutrients due to a decreased surface area over which absorption can take
place. The signs and symptoms of celiac disease are surprisingly diverse and
include abdominal pain, chronic diarrhea, weight loss, bone pain, fatigue and
anemia. Celiac disease is diagnosed by demonstrating villous atrophy in a
small intestine biopsy (Figure 11.34 (A) and (B)) and by improvements in clinical symptoms or histological tests following restriction to a gluten-free diet.
Gluten-free foods are now readily available in supermarkets and health food
stores. The management of celiac disease involves adherence to a gluten-free
diet, which in most cases helps relieve the symptoms and allows the existing
mucosal damage to heal as well as preventing further damage.

Malabsorption is a reduction in the absorption of one or more nutrients by the
small intestine. It occurs as a result of a wide range of disorders that affect the
GIT, pancreas, liver and gall bladder. Its causes include enzyme deficiencies,
such as in lactose intolerance, chronic pancreatitis, bile salt deficiency, as in
biliary obstruction or hepatitis, and intestinal diseases such as celiac disease
and Crohn‚Äôs disease (see below). The clinical features of malabsorption (Figure
11.35) arise because of deficiency of one or more nutrients and include anemia
due to iron, folate and vitamin B12 deficiencies, osteomalacia due to vitamin D
deficiency, edema due to hypoalbuminemia, the tendency to bleeding when
vitamin K is suboptimal and generalized weight loss. Malabsorption results in
retention of nutrients in the GIT lumen causing diarrhea and abdominal discomfort due to the action of GIT bacteria. Malabsorption of fats leads to their
losses in amounts greater than 5 g daily and causes steatorrhea. The feces are
greasy, with a pale color and have an offensive smell.
A diseased liver may be unable to synthesize bile which is required for digestion of fats and if absent can lead to malabsorption. Liver function tests can
indicate the presence of liver disease and a number of blood tests are also useful in assessing liver function. These include determining the concentration
of albumin in the plasma and hematological investigations such as full blood
count, iron, vitamin B12 and folate and can indicate the type of malabsorption.
Investigations of malabsorption also include microbiological examination of
feces to identify any pathogens present. The pentose sugar xylose is absorbed
in the small intestine but is not metabolized and is excreted unchanged in

the urine. This property is exploited in the xylose absorption test to assess
the malabsorption of carbohydrates. The patient fasts overnight, empties the
bladder and drinks a 500 cm3 solution containing 5 g xylose. In normal individuals, the serum xylose concentration increases above 1.3 mmol dm‚Äì3 one
hour after the test. After 5 h, the concentration of xylose in the urine increases
to more than 7.0 mmol dm‚Äì3. Significantly lower concentrations of xylose
occur in the serum of patients with carbohydrate malabsorption. However,
care must be exercised since some bacteria colonizing the small intestine are
capable of metabolizing xylose and a number of renal diseases can also lead
to reduced concentrations.
Malabsorption of fat can occur in a number of pancreatic and intestinal disorders. Bacteria colonizing the small intestine may break down bile acids,
reducing their effective concentration and causing malabsorption. A fecal
fat test can assess fat malabsorption. The test involves collecting feces over
a period of three days after which their fat content is assessed chemically.
Normally, up to 5 g of fat is lost in the feces each day but more is lost during
malabsorption giving rise to steatorrhea.

The diagnosis of food allergy involves taking a clinical history
from the patient, focusing on past allergic reactions and considering seasonal or environmental cues. This is followed by a
clinical examination to detect characteristic signs and symptoms
affecting the eyes, skin and nose. Skin prick testing is often performed. The procedure introduces a small amount of allergen
into the skin and is generally safe. A tiny puncture is made with
a lancet through a drop of allergen placed on the skin usually
of the forearm. A positive reaction to the allergen usually means
the patient is allergic and is indicated by itching within a few
minutes; the affected site becoming red, swollen and having a
raised weal in its center. The weal enlarges to a maximum size
within 15 to 20 min and is measured and recorded. A negative

Food intolerance refers to the less well-deÔ¨Åned condition occurring in some people when they eat certain foods and is characterized by headaches, muscle and joint aches and pains, and
tiredness. The less well-deÔ¨Åned symptoms make the condition harder to diagnose compared with classical food allergy.
Examples of food intolerance include celiac disease and lactose
intolerance.

A food allergy is a reaction of the immune system to food components that are allergens (Chapter 5). Foods commonly associated with allergies include milk, eggs, peanuts, tree nuts, soy,
wheat, Ô¨Åsh and shellÔ¨Åsh, which are protein rich, and account
for over 90% of all food allergies. The antibodies responsible
for food allergies are IgE molecules that react with allergens
to trigger the release of histamine (Figure 11.36). Histamine is
largely responsible for the symptoms but these differ between
patients and can differ in the same individual when exposed to
different allergens. Symptoms include skin irritations, for example rashes and eczema, itchy nose and eyes, sneezing, excessive nasal mucus, coughing and shortness of breath, nausea,
vomiting and diarrhea. Skin rashes, such as nettle rash (also
called urticaria or hives), can appear but tend to last only a few
days. Occasionally, patients present with long-lasting, chronic
skin reactions such as scaly patches. Food allergies are relatively
common and affect 1‚Äì2% of adults and up to 8% of children
in the UK. Some individuals may experience the severe reaction
called anaphylaxis described in Chapter 5. This is triggered by a
small amount of food and is a rare but potentially fatal condition
in which several different parts of the body experience allergic
reactions including skin rashes, swollen throat and difÔ¨Åculties in
breathing, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, hypotension and unconsciousness. Symptoms usually appear within minutes of exposure to the allergen and can last several hours. An unusual form
of anaphylaxis occurs following the consumption of allergens
within a few hours of exercising and is referred to as exerciseinduced anaphylaxis.

response indicates that the patient is insensitive to the allergen
under test. Blood tests, such as the radioallergosorbent (RAST)
test, to detect the presence of IgE antibodies may be used but
can only indicate an allergy if the speciÔ¨Åc IgE is present in the
blood. However, there is no clear relationship between the level
of blood IgE and the severity of the allergy. Occasionally, a challenge test may be performed where the suspected food is given
to the patient Ô¨Årst by touch and then by ingestion in increasing
amounts and the response monitored. Challenge tests should
always be performed under supervised conditions in a hospital
or clinical setting, so that any clinically serious reactions can be
detected and managed.
Food allergy is usually treated by avoiding the offending food.
In some cases, complete elimination of the food for one to two
years results in a loss of clinical symptoms although certain
allergies, for example those associated with the intake of Ô¨Åsh
or peanuts, may persist for life. It is vital that consumers are
provided with clear information on the composition of foods
they purchase. Food avoidance may have serious nutritional consequences, particularly when a key nutrient is removed from the
diet. Immediate medical attention is necessary when anaphylaxis
occurs and usually involves an injection of adrenaline to dilate
airways and blood vessels by relaxing smooth muscle tissues.

DISORDERS OF THE GASTROINTESTINAL TRACT, PANCREAS, LIVER AND GALL BLADDER

BOX 11.6 Diarrhea
Diarrhea is the frequent passage of feces that are larger in volume
and more Ô¨Çuid than normal. It is not a disease but a symptom of some other underlying conditions that result in abrupt
increases in intestinal movements. The accelerated movement
of the contents through the GIT leaves insufÔ¨Åcient time for Ô¨Çuid
reabsorption and produces watery stools. A two-way Ô¨Çow of
water and electrolytes occurs between the GIT lumen and the
basolateral extracellular Ô¨Çuid (ECF). Water enters the GIT in food
and drinks and in various secretions. In the small intestine, the
secretion of water and electrolytes normally occurs in the crypts
of Lieberkuhn. Sodium chloride is transported from ECF into
epithelial cells across their basolateral membranes. Secretory
stimuli increase the permeability of luminal membranes of the
crypt cells allowing chloride ions to move into the GIT lumen.
Sodium ions, however, are returned to the ECF by the action of
the Na+/K+-ATPase of the basolateral membranes. The movements of these ions generate an osmotic gradient and water
Ô¨Çows passively from the ECF into the lumen through intercellular
channels. Water reabsorption is also driven by osmotic gradients,
which are formed when solutes, particularly sodium ions, actively
enter enterocytes. Absorption of sodium ions may occur by direct
transport as the ion, or be exchanged for hydrogen ions or linked
to the absorption of glucose, amino acids or chloride ions.
Following absorption, sodium is transported out of enterocytes
across the basolateral membrane into the ECF by the Na+/K+ATPase. This increases the osmolality of the ECF and water moves
passively into it from the GIT lumen. These processes maintain an
osmotic balance between GIT contents and ECF in the intestinal
tissue. However, since Ô¨Çuid absorption normally exceeds secretion, the net result is Ô¨Çuid absorption. More than 90% of the Ô¨Çuid
entering the small intestine is absorbed, with only about one dm3
of it reaching the large intestine. Here further absorption occurs
and only 100 to 200 cm3 of water is lost in the feces daily.
Diarrhea arises when water and electrolyte transport becomes
disordered, for example by increased secretion, decreased
absorption or both, and an increased volume of Ô¨Çuid enters the
large intestine. When this exceeds the absorptive capacity of the
large intestine it results in diarrhea.
Diarrhea may result from one of two principal mechanisms, secretion and osmotic imbalance. These mechanisms are not exclusive; intestinal infections can cause both types and, indeed, both
may occur in a single individual. Secretory diarrhea is the more
common of the two and is caused by an abnormal secretion of
water and salts into the small intestine. This occurs when the reabsorption of sodium ions is impaired but the secretion of chloride ions in the crypts of Lieberkuhn is maintained or increased.
This produces a net secretion of Ô¨Çuid resulting in the loss of water

(&%

and salts from the body in watery stools; this causes dehydration.
Infectious diarrhea may result from the actions of bacterial
toxins or viruses on the GIT mucosa (Chapter 2). Osmotic diarrhea
results when a poorly absorbed, osmotically active substance is
ingested, causing water and salts to move rapidly across the
GIT lining to maintain the osmotic balance. The effects depend
upon the osmolarity of the solution. If the substance is taken
as an iso-osmotic solution, water and solute will pass through
the GIT, with no net absorption causing diarrhea. If taken as a
hyperosmotic solution, water and some electrolytes will move
from the ECF into the GIT lumen increasing the volume of the
feces and causing dehydration. Furthermore, because the loss of
body water is proportionally greater than the loss of sodium and
chloride ions, hypernatremia also develops (Chapter 8).
Diarrhea results in losses of large amounts of sodium, chloride,
potassium and hydrogen carbonate ions. Acute effects result
from the loss of water and electrolytes, leading to dehydration,
metabolic acidosis, because of the loss of hydrogen carbonate
and potassium depletion (Figure 11.37). The dehydration is the
most dangerous in the short term because a decreased blood
volume (hypovolemia) can result in cardiovascular collapse and
death if not treated promptly (Chapter 8). The aim of managing
diarrhea is to correct dehydration and electrolyte deÔ¨Åcits. Fluids
can be replaced either orally or intravenously.

CASE STUDIES

Crohn‚Äôs disease is a chronic inflammation, usually of the ileum, although
it can affect any part of the GIT. The inflammation tends to be patchy but
extends throughout the layers of the intestinal wall thickening the wall and
narrowing the lumen. The cause of Crohn‚Äôs disease is unclear although viruses
and bacteria have been implicated. Patients with Crohn‚Äôs disease suffer from
lack of appetite, abdominal pain, diarrhea and weight loss. A biopsy of the GIT
is used to detect the characteristic changes associated with Crohn‚Äôs disease.
Treatment involves using anti-inflammatory drugs, such as 5-aminosalicylic
acid, although surgery may be required in severe cases.

DISORDERS OF THE LARGE INTESTINE
Ulcerative colitis is characterized by chronic inflammation and ulceration of
the colon that is distinctive, in that it affects only its mucosal lining. The lining
is also affected by numerous hemorrhagic ulcerations. The cause of ulcerative
colitis is not entirely clear but is believed to be autoimmune in origin (Chapter
5). Patients with ulcerative colitis suffer from abdominal pain, fever, weight
loss and bloody diarrhea. Diagnosis of ulcerative colitis is made following
colonoscopy where a biopsy from the colon is taken to detect the characteristic histological changes. Ulcerative colitis is treated with anti-inflammatory
drugs, such as 5-aminosalicylic acid, although surgical removal of the affected
region may be necessary in severe cases.

11.9 SUMMARY
The GIT and its associated organs are necessary for the digestion of food and
the absorption of nutrients derived from food. Digestion takes place in the
mouth, esophagus, stomach and small intestine, with the bulk of ingested
water being absorbed in the latter. The pancreas provides enzymes for digestion in the small intestine while the liver secretes bile, containing detergents
that aid in the digestion of fats. Most nutrients from digestion are carried to
the liver in the hepatic portal vein.
The GIT also contributes to nutrient homeostasis, through metabolic reactions that take place in GIT enterocytes, delivering metabolic products such
as lactate to the liver. The GIT also produces a number of hormones that help
in coordinating its activities.
Disorders of the pancreas, such as acute and chronic pancreatitis, are serious
conditions that may be fatal. Disorders of the liver may be caused by drugs,
poisons, viruses, and alcohol or by blockage of the bile duct, as in cholestasis.
Liver disorders may be diagnosed by assaying several enzymes, together with
an X-ray examination and palpation to detect a swollen liver. Jaundice is a frequent complication of liver disease. Disorders of the GIT include gastritis and
ulcers that are associated with infection of Helicobacter pylori, intolerance to
certain nutrients, such as lactose, celiac disease and malabsorption.

12.1 INTRODUCTION
The human body must be prepared for a daily onslaught of thousands of
chemicals. Some will be food materials (Chapter 10) that are absorbed and
metabolized because cells have membrane channels and enzymes to recognize
and deal with these compounds. Other compounds may or may not enter the
cells of the body. If they do, then the body can recognize such compounds
and must deal with them appropriately to prevent deleterious effects. It is not
always successful in this aim and many xenobiotics cause diseases and may
be fatal if a threshold dose is exceeded.
Toxicology is the study of the adverse effects of chemicals on organisms, that
is the study of poisons, where a poison can be defined as any substance that
causes injury, illness or death. Toxicology covers the study of the adverse effects
of chemicals including drugs, chemicals acquired from the environment and
toxins, which are defined here as harmful substances produced by other
organisms, often derived from microorganisms, for example the bacterial
toxins described in Chapter 2.
Xenobiotics, literally meaning ‚Äòstranger to life‚Äô, are substances that do not
originate in the body but are pharmacologically, endocrinologically or
toxicologically active. Thus, they might be drugs or synthetic chemicals or a
substance produced in one organism and introduced into another where they

(&*

Margin Note 12.1 A lethal
bacterial toxin

i

The bacterium Clostridium
botulinum is an organism that can
cause a fatal type of food poisoning.
The organism produces several
toxins when growing on food in
anaerobic conditions. In addition, its
spores are resistant to heat, hence
food that has not been adequately
sterilized and then stored in an
anaerobic environment, such as
bottled or canned foods, can give
rise to food poisoning. These toxins
inhibit the release of acetylcholine
at neuromuscular junctions, leading
to a Ô¨Çaccid paralysis in tissues served
by susceptible neuromuscular and
peripheral nerves (Chapter 2). The
lethal dose of botulinum toxin for
humans is not known with certainty
but estimates from studies with other
primates suggest that approximately
0.1 Mg given intravenously or
intramuscularly and about 1Mg if
inhaled would kill a 70 kg human.
Surprisingly, given their extreme
toxicity, toxins from Clostridium
botulinum are used cosmetically and
therapeutically. Injections of ‚ÄòBotox‚Äô,
the A toxin, into the skin of the face
is used to relax the face muscles
reducing the wrinkled appearance
of aging (Chapter 18). The injections
must be repeated every few months,
as the effect is temporary. Botulinum
toxin is also used in clinical practice
to control conditions associated
with inappropriate secretions of
acetylcholine, for example the
muscular spasms associated with the
neurological disorder, dystonia.

TOXICOLOGY

would not normally occur. An example would be a compound produced by
a plant and ingested as food. Equally, it might be a compound that has been
completely synthesized chemically and have harmful effects, for example a
poison or a carcinogen, or it could be beneficial, such as a medicinal drug.
Drugs are xenobiotics that are used to achieve certain effects. For example,
paracetamol alleviates headaches and aspirin controls inflammatory
responses. Alternatively, a drug may also be a compound with pharmacological
activity used for ‚Äòrecreational‚Äô purposes or taken by an addict. The body has
to deal with these drugs and eventually get rid of them. An overdose may
exceed the body‚Äôs capacity to detoxify these compounds, with potentially
disastrous effects. However, if the body inactivates the drug too quickly, then
its effects will be short-lived. These are all considerations that pharmaceutical
companies need to address when developing a new drug.

12.2 DRUG ACTION, METABOLISM, DISTRIBUTION AND
EXCRETION
Drugs are xenobiotics and may be defined as any substance, other than food,
that affects a living process. Pharmacology is the study of the effects of drugs
in the prevention, diagnosis, and treatment or cure of disease. Such drugs are
often referred to as medicines, which distinguishes them from other drugs
that are used for pleasure, such as some narcotics. Pharmacotherapeutics is
that branch of pharmacology concerned with the administration of drugs for
prevention and treatment of disease.
Drugs can be classified according to their chemical structure but, more often,
in terms of their pharmacological effects. For example, they can be divided into
three groups: chemotherapeutic drugs, for example the antibiotics described
in Chapter 3, which are used to treat infectious diseases; pharmacodynamic
drugs, such as sedatives that are used in the treatment of noninfectious
diseases; and a number of miscellaneous agents including narcotics and
analgesics.
Any single drug may have a chemical, brand and a generic name. The chemical
name is given according to the rules of chemical nomenclature, whereas the
brand name is given by the manufacturer. The generic name is a common,
established name given to a drug irrespective of that of its manufacturer.
Most drugs act on cells to alter a biological function. This pharmacological
effect occurs as a consequence of the drug reacting with a receptor that
controls a particular function, or because the drug alters a physiological
mechanism which affects that function. For many drugs, the extent and
duration of the pharmacological effect are proportional to the concentration
of the drug at the receptor. The site at which the drug acts to produce a
pharmacological effect is called its site of action. The mechanism of action of
the drug is the biochemical or physiological process occurring at the site of
action to produce the pharmacological effect. Drug receptors include enzymes
and structural or transport proteins. However, some receptors are nonprotein
that bind to the drug to form a complex which alters the permeability of the
membranes or the transcription of DNA. Some drugs have a structure similar
to endogenous molecules and compete with them for binding sites. Drugs
may also act by preventing the formation, release, uptake or transport of key
substances in the body or by forming complexes with molecules that can
then activate receptors.
The binding of a drug to its receptor usually depends on relatively weak
forces, such as van der Waals forces and hydrogen and ionic bonds and
thus the formation of the drug‚Äìreceptor complex that elicits the response is
normally freely reversible. Hence the response to any drug is not permanent.

(&+

W^dad\nd[Y^hZVhZ

However, the response is dose dependent and, indeed, a dose‚Äìresponse
relationship exists between the concentration of drug in the serum and
the pharmacological effect. This response eventually reaches a maximum
effect because the receptor becomes saturated with the drug (Figure 12.1).
The therapeutic range is the concentrations of drug in the serum that is
appropriate for therapy. The dosage of any drug is planned to give a serum
concentration within its therapeutic range. Therapeutic drug monitoring is
often necessary to determine which given doses of a drug result in serum
concentrations within the therapeutic range. The serum concentration of
the drug must not fall below its minimum effective concentration (MEC)
otherwise it will be ineffective. However, neither should it rise above its
minimum toxic concentration (MTC) because of the danger of metabolic or
structural damage. The time required for the concentration of a drug in the
blood to decline to half its original value is referred to as its half-life (t1/2).

It is essential that a number of properties relating to a medicinal drug, for
example its pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics, are first ascertained.
Pharmacodynamics describes how the drug interacts with its target site and
the biochemical and physiological processes that result in any therapeutic or
toxic effects. Pharmacokinetics relates to the uptake, distribution, metabolism
and excretion from the body.
Most drugs are given orally for convenience, although they can be
administered intravenously, intramuscularly or subcutaneously. When given
orally, the absorption of the drug depends on its ability to disassociate from
its dosing form, dissolve in gastrointestinal fluids and diffuse across the gut
wall into the blood. The rate and extent of drug absorption varies with the
nature of the drug, the matrix in which it is dissolved and the region of the
gastrointestinal tract (GIT) where it is absorbed. The proportion of the drug
absorbed into the circulation is referred to as its bioavailability. For an orally
delivered drug, this should generally be greater than 70% to be of therapeutic
use. However, when the site of action is the GIT lumen itself, for example
treating a GIT infection, then a low bioavailability would be advantageous.
A number of drugs undergo what is referred to as first pass metabolism.
They are absorbed rapidly and completely by the GIT but, nevertheless,
have low bioavailability because they are transported to the liver in the
hepatic portal vein and metabolized (Section 12.3) and have not entered the
systemic circulation. Drugs with delayed absorption are sometimes required
and special slow or sustained release formulations have been developed for
these cases. Such drugs can be taken orally at less frequent intervals. Certain
diseases that affect the GIT and the interaction of some drugs and foods in
the GIT can delay their absorption.
Following absorption, drug distribution occurs when the compound enters
the vascular system. The physical, chemical and molecular properties
of the drug can influence its distribution. Its distribution may also be
influenced by its binding to blood components and receptors and its ability
to dissolve in lipids and pass through biological membranes. Many drugs
bind to plasma proteins and often an equilibrium is established between
protein-bound and free drug. Only the free fraction is able to interact
with receptors or cross cellular membranes. Any factor that changes drug‚Äì
protein interactions may alter the distribution, pharmacological effects and
excretion of the drug.
Drugs are excreted from the body by the biliary, GIT, pulmonary and/
or renal routes. Most drugs are excreted through the renal system, and
therefore, alterations in renal function may influence the half-life and serum
concentration of the drug. A decline in renal function causes an increase in
the serum drug concentration with an associated increased pharmacological
effect.

TOXICOLOGY

12.3 PHYSIOLOGICAL DETOXIFICATION MECHANISMS
Xenobiotics, whether drugs or toxins, are normally absorbed through the lungs,
GIT or the skin. In addition, drugs may be injected through intramuscular,
intraperitoneal, subcutaneous or intravenous routes. Following absorption, the
xenobiotics are distributed around the body and a proportion will be absorbed
by cells, while some may be directly excreted from the kidneys. Humans also
have a number of physiological mechanisms devoted to detoxifying ingested
xenobiotics, which largely involve enzyme activities in the liver and kidneys.
Many of the biochemical detoxification mechanisms convert the xenobiotic
to more water-soluble compounds that are more easily excreted. These
mechanisms can sometimes prove inadequate. Also, in some unfortunate cases,
the detoxification mechanisms form compounds that are even more toxic or
carcinogenic than the original compound.
Treatment for poisoning involves administering an antidote to the toxin or
drug when one is available. For many common poisons this is not the case
and therapy involves general supportive measures, such as decreasing their
absorption from the GIT, increasing the rate of elimination from the body or
altering the distribution within the body to protect susceptible tissues. An
optimal therapeutic concentration of a drug can only be maintained in the
plasma if the patient fully complies with the prescribed dose. Unfortunately,
the most common reason for emergency admissions to hospitals is because
of an excessive intake of a drug prescribed for medication. Other causes of
poisoning may be accidental, suicidal or homicidal in intent.
Many poisons are lipophilic and are only sparingly soluble in water and so
cannot easily be excreted by the kidneys. Thus a major aim of detoxification in
the liver is to convert them to compounds that have increased water solubility
and are more readily removed by the kidneys. Detoxification reactions in the
liver are favored by its microstructure, which consists of lobules with a central
vein and peripheral branches of the hepatic artery and the hepatic portal
vein. Blood leaves branches of the hepatic artery and hepatic portal vein and
percolates from the periphery of the lobule through sinusoids, bathing the
hepatocytes of the lobule as it flows (Figure 12.2). While it is unusual for blood
to come into such close contact with tissue cells, this arrangement allows
poisons to be removed as the blood flows through the lobule to be collected by
branches of the hepatic vein. Also, mitotic divisions within the organ replace
those liver cells that are irreparably damaged. It goes without saying that a
disease of the liver can compromise its ability to deal with toxic substances,
which can lead to significant clinical consequences.
Detoxification is achieved in two phases. In Phase I, the xenobiotic is
oxidized and/or hydroxylated by mixed function oxidase (MFO) activities
of monooxygenase systems. There are two such systems, a flavincontaining monooxygenase (FMO) system used in oxidation reactions of
drug metabolism and a cytochrome P-450 monooxygenase system that
oxidizes carbon atoms. Both systems require NADPH as a coenzyme and
dioxygen and are localized in the smooth endoplasmic reticulum. In Phase
II, the oxidized xenobiotic product is linked to a polar compound, such as
a glucuronate or sulfate group forming water-soluble conjugates in further
enzyme-catalyzed reactions. The enzymes that catalyze both the Phase I
and II reactions have broad specificities and are therefore able to detoxify a
wide range of organic toxins and drugs. This is essential since the range of
xenobiotics to which the body may be exposed is enormous, and individual
enzyme systems could not be available to deal with each one separately. At
least 50 different members of the cytochrome P-450 enzyme family are found
in the smooth endoplasmic reticulum of hepatocytes (Figure 12.3). They
catalyze the hydroxylation of a wide variety of substances by incorporating
one of the oxygen atoms into the xenobiotic to form the hydroxyl group,

The actions of these enzymes form hydroxyl groups that increase the water

which use UDP-glucuronate and 3a-phosphoadenosyl 5a-phosphosulfate
(PAPS) as the respective donor substrates:

The increased water solubility of the products facilitates their excretion by the
kidneys, although small amounts are also lost in bile to the feces.
It is unfortunately the case that a number of poisons are rendered more toxic
by oxidation by the P-450 system. Indeed, a number of fat-soluble compounds
that are relatively harmless because they would normally accumulate in
adipose tissue are converted into potentially lethal materials because of the
increase in water solubility. Thus, a number of indirectly acting carcinogens,
for example, benzo[a]pyrene, found in cigarette smoke and the toxin aflatoxin
B1 from Aspergillus flavus, are converted to highly carcinogenic products
(Figure 12.4 (A) and (B)).

COMMON POISONS

12.4 SYMPTOMATIC POISONING
In the symptomatic patient, the diagnosis of poisoning is usually made on
the basis of clinical findings. However, in all cases of suspected poisoning,
a number of biochemical investigations should be made as shown in Table
12.1. The roles of the clinical laboratory in chemical toxicology in identifying
a suspected poison in blood or urine and in monitoring vital functions cannot
be overestimated.

Table 12.1 Biochemical investigations of suspected poisoning

The clinical management of patients is directed towards supporting their vital
functions and attempting to remove the poison from the body as rapidly as
possible. Unfortunately, few of the signs or symptoms that patients present
with are specific for any one type of drug or poison. Also, patients may well
present in a coma and so be unable to give relevant information. A drug screen
on a urine specimen may be carried out but this will only indicate that a drug
has been ingested and may give no indication of the severity of the overdose.

12.5 COMMON POISONS
Humans are exposed to numerous xenobiotics, including drugs, pesticides,
environmental pollutants, industrial chemicals and food additives. Any of
these are potentially capable of perturbing the biochemistry and physiology
of the body either directly or after being metabolically transformed. However,
the most frequent poisons encountered in emergency toxicology include
paracetamol (acetaminophen), aspirin, alcohols (ethanol, methanol, ethylene
glycol), barbiturates (though this is now mainly historical), carbon monoxide,
paraquat and several metals. The chapter will concentrate only on those most
likely to be encountered in clinical practice.

PARACETAMOL
Paracetamol (Figure 12.5) is used as an analgesic, that is, to relieve fever and
pain. It is safe when taken at recommended doses but is toxic if overdosed. It
is the commonest cause of admissions to hospital due to its wide availability.
In the UK, overdoses cause approximately 150 deaths annually.
Paracetamol is rapidly absorbed from the stomach and upper GIT. The
majority of ingested paracetamol is metabolized by conjugation with sulfate
(~30%) or glucuronide (~60%) in the liver as described in Section 12.3 to
form nontoxic metabolites. However, approximately 10% is metabolized
by cytochrome P-450 to produce a highly reactive intermediate called
N-acetyl-p-benzoquinoneimine (NABQI). It is possible for NABQI to be

TOXICOLOGY

metabolized by conjugation with glutathione in hepatocytes to produce
a nontoxic mercapturic acid. Glutathione is a tripeptide consisting of
G glutamate, cysteine and glycine residues, which will be further mentioned
in Chapters 13 and 18. It functions as a coenzyme in several oxidation‚Äì
reduction reactions (Figure 12.6). When an overdose of paracetamol is
ingested, liver detoxification systems may become saturated and the large
amount of NABQI produced exhausts the limited stores of glutathione. As
a consequence, NABQI binds to sulfhydryl groups of hepatocyte proteins,
forming irreversible complexes that result in acute hepatic necrosis, that
is, cell death (Figure 12.7). Paracetamol is also metabolized in cells of
renal tubules and, in an overdose, renal tubular necrosis may also occur.
In the presence of hepatic damage there is usually only a small amount of
renal damage but occasionally this may be the major presenting feature
of paracetamol poisoning. Alcohol in chronic alcoholics and the drugs
phenobarbitone and phenytoin, used to treat epilepsy, may induce the
synthesis of cytochrome P-450 enzymes and cause increased production of
NABQI. As a consequence, hepatotoxicity may occur following a relatively
small overdose of paracetamol in such patients. Severe toxicity is also more
likely in people whose intracellular stores of glutathione are depleted as a
result of starvation or protein malnutrition (Chapter 10).
Substances, such as cimetidine, that inhibit the cytochrome P-450 system
without interfering with glucuronidation or sulfation could potentially reduce
paracetamol hepatotoxicity.

Toxic doses
A dose of 15 g for adults and 4 g for children is normally sufficient to cause
hepatotoxicity. It has been suggested that this amount of paracetamol
depletes liver glutathione concentrations by 70% in a 70 kg man. However,
there is wide variation in the metabolic handling of paracetamol by the
body and large overdoses of over 50 g have been known to have little effect
in some patients. The incidence of hepatotoxicity in children is significantly
lower at concentrations of paracetamol in blood that would be potentially
toxic in adults. Animal studies have suggested that turnover of glutathione
is age dependent, hence younger animals can tolerate higher doses of
paracetamol.
Often estimates of the amount of paracetamol ingested, for example by a
potential suicide, are unreliable. Thus, predictions of hepatotoxicity should be
made only on the basis of serum concentrations. In general, concentrations
of paracetamol greater than 300 mg dm‚Äì3 cause serious liver damage 4 h after
ingestion whereas values below 120 mg dm‚Äì3 show no toxicity.

Clinical features of paracetamol poisoning
The signs and symptoms of paracetamol overdose are insidious, especially in
the earlier stages. The clinical features can be divided into three phases, with
a fourth occurring if the person survives toxicity and are described in Table
12.2.

Estimating the concentration of paracetamol in plasma is useful for assessing
the probability of patients developing hepatotoxicity. A nomogram (Figure
12.8) is available for paracetamol poisoning but should only be used when
the size of the overdose and the approximate time of ingestion are known.
Blood samples for paracetamol determination should be drawn at least 4 h
postdose to allow for its complete absorption and the serum concentration
to peak. The concentration of paracetamol in plasma can be used as a guide
to patient management. Other tests that may be useful are determining the

activities of liver transaminases and measuring serum bilirubin to monitor
liver functions (Chapter 11) and determining serum creatinine concentrations
to assess renal function (Chapter 8). Paracetamol poisoning causes an
increased prothrombin time (Chapter 13) which is the time taken for blood
clotting to occur in a sample of blood to which calcium and thromboplastin
have been added.

Management of paracetamol poisoning
Antidotes to paracetamol poisoning include methionine and N-acetylcysteine.
Both promote the synthesis of glutathione in the liver, increasing its capacity
to detoxify the active metabolite. Methionine may be given orally at 2.5 g
every 4 h for 12 h in early or uncomplicated cases, while N-acetylcysteine is
administered parenterally and is more appropriate for patients who present
late, or are comatose or vomiting. N-acetylcysteine can act as a glutathione
substitute and enhances conjugation with sulfate (see earlier). It also limits
liver damage by reducing inflammation and improving the microcirculation
in the liver. Treatment gives maximal benefit if started within 10 h of ingestion
although it may still be beneficial for up to 24‚Äì30 h. General procedures, such
as administration of activated charcoal, can reduce gastrointestinal absorption
of paracetamol if given in the first hour of an overdose. Gastric lavage may be
used in patients who have ingested large amounts of paracetamol and present
within an hour of ingestion.
Margin Note 12.2 Glycogenolysis

ASPIRIN
Aspirin (acetylsalicylic acid) is hydrolyzed in the body to salicylate, the
active form of the drug (Figure 12.9), which has analgesic, antipyretic and
anti-inflammatory properties. Salicylate is eliminated from the body by
conjugation with glycine to form salicyluric acid and, to a lesser extent,
with glucuronide to form phenol and acylglucuronides. A small amount is
hydroxylated to gentisic acid. In an overdose, these pathways may become
saturated and a large proportion of salicylate may be excreted unchanged in
urine.
Like paracetamol, aspirin is widely and easily available and poisoning by
aspirin overdose is therefore relatively common. Salicylate toxicity is due to a
number of effects (Figure 12.10). An increase in the concentration of salicylate
in the brain stimulates the respiratory center leading to hyperventilation,
which can result in dehydration. In addition, hyperventilation causes a
decline in the PCO2 and a rise in pH, that is, respiratory alkalosis (Chapter 9).
As PCO2 declines, the pH rises and less H2CO3 is formed. The kidneys
+
compensate by excreting more hydrogen carbonate (HCO¬Ø)
3 and K whilst
retaining H+. These activities, rather than helping correct the respiratory
alkalosis, contribute towards a latent metabolic acidosis. Salicylate also
uncouples oxidative phosphorylation, decreasing ATP formation and
increasing heat production, with sweating and hyperpyrexia, which further
contributes to the dehydration and fluid loss. The decline in the amount of
ATP stimulates glycolysis, and therefore pyruvate and lactate accumulate. An
increase in glycogenolysis (Margin Note 12.2) provides the required glucose
for this increase. Eventually there may be depletion of glycogen giving rise to

hypoglycemia and the catabolism of lipids producing ketone bodies

accumulation of oxoglutarate and oxaloacetate, and of amino acid metabolism,
causing an increase in amino acids that accentuates the metabolic acidosis.
Fluid and electrolyte losses are increased by the nausea and vomiting.

Toxic dose
Common therapeutic levels of salicylate are 50 mg dm‚Äì3 although they can
be as high as 250 mg dm‚Äì3 in the serum of patients with rheumatoid arthritis
(Chapter 5). The potentially lethal dose of aspirin in adults is 24 to 30 g but

('+

W^dad\nd[Y^hZVhZ

COMMON POISONS

death can occur in children under 18 months from as little as 300 mg. Signs of
salicylate toxicity occur when concentrations are greater than 300 mg dm‚Äì3. In
severe cases of aspirin poisoning, the concentrations in serum can be as high
as 1000 mg dm‚Äì3.

Clinical features of aspirin poisoning
Numerous symptoms are associated with aspirin poisoning, including
nausea, vomiting, sweating, hyperventilation, tinnitus (buzzing noise in ear),
confusion and/or unconsciousness and a severe loss of fluid.

Laboratory investigations of aspirin poisoning
The concentration of salicylate in plasma should be measured on presentation
and every 4 to 6 h until it has fallen below the toxic range. This is necessary as
salicylates precipitate in acid conditions and may therefore deposit in large
amounts in the stomach. The consequence is delayed absorption and this
means that the concentration in plasma may continue to rise for many hours
following a severe overdose.

Management of aspirin poisoning
A variety of measures can be taken to alleviate salicylate poisoning, which
are aimed at decreasing the absorption of salicylate, increasing its rate of
elimination and correcting the acid‚Äìbase and electrolyte disturbances. These
measures include gastric lavage for up to 24 h after ingestion as salicylate
may remain unabsorbed in the GIT for long periods. Patients may also be
given 50 g of activated charcoal followed by 25 g every 4 h. The charcoal binds
salicylate and prevents its absorption. The ionization state of salicylate affects
its reabsorption by the kidneys. If the provisional urine is acidic, salicylate is
not ionized and is filtered at the glomerulus but reabsorbed from tubules
(Chapter 8); if the urine is alkaline the salicylate is ionized and its tubular
reabsorption is reduced and more salicylate is lost from body. Hence patients
are infused with sodium hydrogen carbonate to increase the pH of urine and
promote loss of salicylate. Fluid replacement and corrections of acid‚Äìbase,
electrolyte imbalance, especially the hypokalemia, and hypoglycemia are all
required.
Hemodialysis may be necessary in severe cases of poisoning, such as
when plasma concentrations of salicylate exceed 800 mg dm‚Äì3. As well
as removing the salicylate, hemodialysis also corrects the acid‚Äìbase and
electrolyte imbalances. The technique requires a dialyzer (Figure 12.11).
Blood from a patient‚Äôs artery is circulated through the dialyzer on one side
of a semipermeable membrane while a solution of normal electrolytic
composition circulates on the other side. Waste products, poisons, including
salicylate, and small molecules cross the membrane and the dialyzed blood
is returned to the body via a vein.

ETHANOL
Ethanol is an addictive drug and its abuse can lead to dependency and
alcoholism. Its abuse is increasingly common in the developed world. The
toxic effects of chronic alcohol abuse on the liver, brain and GIT are widely
known. Ethanol can also modify the effects of other drugs, for example it
inhibits the hydroxylation of barbiturates by the P-450 system preventing their
ready excretion by the kidneys.
The metabolism of ethanol occurs mainly in the liver by one of two
mechanisms. Normally only small amounts are degraded by the P-450 system
(Figure 12.12), although this oxidation can become of major importance
because the P-450 system is induced by chronic alcohol consumption. The

Much of the acetate made from ethanol escapes into the blood and can
result in acidosis (Chapter 9). The effect of both enzymes is to increase the
NADH/NAD+ ratio, that is, alcohol consumption leads to the accumulation of
NADH with consequent severe effects. The increased NADH inhibits fatty acid
oxidation and stimulates the synthesis of triacylglycerols in the liver producing
a fatty liver. The oxidation of lactate to pyruvate is also inhibited, slowing
gluconeogenesis (Margin Note 12.3). The increased lactate exacerbates the
acidosis and the decreased gluconeogenesis may cause hypoglycemia.
The capacity of liver mitochondria to oxidize acetate to CO2 is limited because
the activation of acetate to acetyl CoA requires ATP:
Acetate + Coenzyme A + ATP

acetyl CoA + AMP + PPi

Figure 12.14

Adenosine triphosphate is now in short supply because glycolysis, which
requires free NAD, is slowed and because the processing of acetyl CoA by the
TCA cycle is blocked since NADH inhibits the regulatory enzymes isocitrate
dehydrogenase and 2-oxoglutarate dehydrogenase. Acetyl CoA is converted
to ketone bodies (Chapter 7) that are released into the blood, intensifying the
acidosis caused by acetate and lactate. Acetaldehyde also accumulates and
this extremely reactive compound can bind to liver proteins, impairing their
functions and causing severe damage to liver cells, leading to their death.
Acetaldehyde can also escape from the liver and react with blood proteins to
form stable adducts. These can provide useful markers of the past drinking
activity of an individual.
Liver damage from excessive alcohol consumption occurs in three stages. The
first stage is the formation of the fatty liver described above. This condition,
in the absence of other complications, is readily reversible within four to six
weeks if alcohol is avoided. The second stage is the occurrence of alcoholic
hepatitis when groups of liver cells die. This leads to inflammation and can
be fatal. In the third stage, the patient may develop cirrhosis, a condition seen
in 10% to 15% of alcoholics (Figure 12.15 (A) and (B)). Approximately half of
all cases of cirrhosis are due to alcoholic liver disease. Cirrhosis occurs when
fibrous structures and scar tissue are produced around the dead cells. This
impairs many of the biochemical functions of the liver, for example, cirrhotic
liver cannot convert ammonia to urea and the concentration of ammonia in
the blood rises. Ammonia is toxic to the nervous system and can cause coma

and death. Ethanol also directly affects the central nervous system (CNS). For
example, it enhances the inhibitory affects of F aminobutyric acid (GABA) at
the GABAA receptor and the functions of some 5-hydroxytryptamine receptors,
in addition to numerous other membrane proteins. The resulting depressive
effects of these activities are well known.
Chronic liver damage invariably results in malnutrition, partly due to
malabsorption and partly because the metabolism of nutrients by the liver
is defective. However, many alcoholics are malnourished because of dietary
inadequacies. While ethanol supplies most of their energy needs they may be
ingesting insufficient amounts of other nutrients, particularly proteins and
vitamins (Chapter 10). In addition, chronic alcohol ingestion can damage
the mucosal lining of the GIT and pancreas as well as the liver (Chapter 11).
Alcoholics require increased amounts of vitamins and some trace elements
because of the metabolic load experienced and their increased excretion.
For example, niacin, although not strictly a vitamin since it can be formed,
albeit very inefficiently, from tryptophan (Chapter 10), is necessary to form
the coenzymes, NAD+ and NADP+. A borderline deficiency of niacin leads
to glossitis (redness) of the tongue while a pronounced deficiency leads to
pellagra, with dermatitis, diarrhea and dementia. In developed countries,
pellagra is rarely encountered other than in alcoholics, given their severe
malabsorption problems, hence dietary supplies of niacin and tryptophan
are required. A severe zinc deficiency (Chapter 10) also occurs primarily in
alcoholics, especially those suffering from cirrhosis. Heavy drinkers frequently
suffer from GIT varicose veins (Chapter 14) and diarrhea caused by a variety
of factors, including ethanol-exacerbated lactase deficiency and interference
with normal peristalsis. Steatorrhea is also common, due to deficiencies in
folic acid and bile salts in the GIT (Chapter 11).
The obvious treatment for alcoholic liver disease and cirrhosis is abstinence.
Given the addictive nature of ethanol, this may be difficult to maintain.
Unfortunately, patients presenting with severe alcoholic hepatitis have a
high mortality even when abstinence is successful. Although a number of
pharmacological treatments have been attempted as therapies, none has
been successful. However, supportive nutritional management in cases of
acute and chronic liver disease is essential to achieve electrolyte, vitamin and
protein replenishments. The only treatment for advanced cirrhosis is a liver
transplant (Chapter 6).

COMMON POISONS

The major enzyme involved in ethanol metabolism, alcohol dehydrogenase,
has a broad specificity and can catalyze the oxidation of a range of alcohols.
This allows ethanol to be used as a competitive inhibitor of the enzyme in
the treatment of poisoning by other alcohols, such as methanol and ethylene
glycol.

METHANOL
Methanol is widely used as a solvent and as antifreeze. It is a potent poison
with as little as 10 cm3 causing blindness and 30 cm3 can cause death. Toxicity
can come from ingestion, inhalation and skin exposure. Mass poisonings
have occurred from drinking alcoholic beverages made with contaminated
ethanol and from accidental exposure. The major cause of methanol toxicity
is its initial oxidation to formaldehyde, which is then converted to formate.
The first step in the pathway is catalyzed by alcohol dehydrogenase and the
production of formate is the result of several enzyme activities.
While both formaldehyde and formate are toxic, formaldehyde has a short
metabolic half-life, whereas formate accumulates since its metabolism to CO2
is slow in humans. This leads to metabolic acidosis. The symptoms of methanol
poisoning are an initial mild inebriation and drowsiness. Visual disturbances,
such as blurred vision, diminished visual acuity, dilated pupils occur after
about 6 h. Within 8‚Äì36 h nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, headaches and
possibly coma occur. Treatment for methanol poisoning is, first, to administer
ethanol. This blocks metabolism since alcohol dehydrogenase has a greater
affinity for ethanol than methanol. Second, sodium hydrogen carbonate is
given intravenously to correct the metabolic acidosis.

ETHYLENE GLYCOL
The alcohol ethylene glycol is a commonly used component of antifreeze,
paints, polishes and cosmetics. It is a poison with a minimum lethal dose of
approximately 100 cm3. The toxicity of ethylene glycol is due to its oxidation
to oxalate, which humans cannot rapidly excrete. The oxidative steps produce
excessive NADH resulting in lactate production (Figure 12.16). The oxalate
and lactate can result in metabolic acidosis, while the organic acids produced
by the breakdown of ethylene glycol inhibit a number of metabolic processes

including oxidative phosphorylation. The production of oxalate also results
in its deposition as insoluble calcium oxalate in renal tubules and the brain.
These biochemical events reduce the concentrations of hydrogen carbonate
and Ca2+, but increase that of K+ in plasma. Crystals, blood and protein may
all leak into the urine, giving rise to three distinct clinical phases. Within 30
min to 12 h, intoxication, nausea, vomiting, coma, convulsions, nystagmus,
papilloedema, depressed reflexes, myclonic jerks, tetanic contractions and
permanent optic atrophy may occur. In 12 to 23 h tachypnea, tachycardia,
hypertension, pulmonary edema and congestive cardiac failure may all
present. In the following 24 to 72 h kidney damage with pain and acute renal
tubular necrosis may feature. Death may occur within 24 h due to damage to
the CNS, or between eight to 12 days due to renal failure.

A)
H

Treatment of ethylene glycol poisoning is to apply gastric lavage to reduce its
absorption, combined with supportive therapies for the shock and respiratory
distress. Administration of ethanol is standard since it competes effectively
for the active site on alcohol dehydrogenase, inhibiting the metabolism of
the absorbed ethylene glycol. Sodium hydrogen carbonate, administered
intravenously, and calcium gluconate are used to correct the acidosis and
hypocalcemia respectively. Dialysis is also used to remove ethylene glycol.

Barbiturates are a group of drugs based on the parent compound, barbituric
acid (Figure 12.17 (A)). All are sedatives, that is, they depress certain activities
of the CNS. Although they have well-established therapeutic uses, barbiturates
can be toxic if taken as an overdose, indeed, they are one of the commonest
methods for attempting suicide. They were once used as recreational drugs, for
example in purple hearts, and this too led to accidental overdoses. Barbiturates
have now largely been replaced by benzodiazepines and barbiturate overdose
is less likely to be encountered today.

Barbiturates induce drug dependence and this involves three distinct and
independent components: tolerance, physical dependence and compulsive
abuse or psychic craving. Barbiturate dependence stimulates all three
components to such an extent that they produce major problems for the
individual user as well as for society at large. Once barbiturate dependence
has developed, abrupt withdrawal from the drug induces a particularly
unpleasant withdrawal syndrome. This is characterized by weakness, tremors,
anxiety, increased respiratory and pulse rates with a corresponding increased
blood pressure, vomiting, insomnia, loss of weight, convulsions of the grand
mal type and a psychosis resembling alcoholic delirium tremens. Thus during
withdrawal, it is appropriate to reduce the dosage gradually over an extended
period.
The length of time barbiturates act in vivo varies. Some, for example
thiobarbitone (Figure 12.17 (B)), are short acting, others, such as
pentobarbitone (Figure 12.17 (C)), act in the medium term, while the group
including the best known barbiturate, phenobarbitone (Figure 12.17 (D)),
induce long-lasting effects. Barbiturates act by enhancing the effects of GABA
by binding to a different site on the receptors on target neurons of the CNS
to those for GABA itself. The blood‚Äìbrain barrier (Figure 3.4) prevents the
easy entry of many substances into the brain compared with their uptake
into other tissues. However, lipid-soluble substances, such as the barbiturate
thiopentone, enter the brain quickly by passive diffusion. This rapid uptake
allows thiopentone to exert its anesthetic effects extremely quickly. In
contrast, other barbiturates, such as phenobarbitone, are weak acids and so
may be ionized. This slows their entry into the CNS but produces a longer
lasting effect. The life-threatening effects of barbiturate poisoning include
depression of the centers in the CNS that control respiration and blood

COMMON POISONS

circulation. Some barbiturates, for example phenobarbitone, can also induce
the synthesis of monooxygenase enzymes and so, by altering the rate or route
of metabolism of other drugs, can alter their toxicities.
There is no antidote for barbiturate poisoning. Primary care is to maintain
a free airway, administer artificial respiration if required and forced alkaline
diuresis. The pH dependence of ionization of many common barbiturates
is exploited by infusions of large volumes of sodium hydrogen carbonate
containing the osmotic diuretics urea or mannitol. This increases the pH
of plasma relative to the cytoplasm of cells and increases the proportion
of ionized barbiturate in the plasma causing more of the un-ionized drug
to diffuse out of the tissues, including the brain, into the plasma. This can
promote a diuresis as large as 12 dm3 in 24 h. The ionized form is also excreted
more rapidly since the alkalinity of the provisional urine ensures it remains
ionized and cannot cross the tubule wall back into the plasma.

CARBON MONOXIDE
Carbon monoxide (CO) is a poisonous gas. However it is not an irritant
and is odorless. Hence it is insidious and concentrations can build up with
the victim being unaware of any danger. Carbon monoxide is no longer
present in domestic gas in the UK but is still a major cause of poisoning,
both accidental and intentional and results in the deaths of several hundred
people in the UK each year. Sources of CO include domestic fires, ovens
and boilers, coal gas, furnace gas, cigarette smoke, burning plastic and car
exhausts, although catalytic converters have reduced the CO output from
car petrol engines. Thus traffic policemen, firemen, those trapped in fires
and some factory workers are all potentially at a greater risk. In the UK, the
major cause of poisoning results from exposure to inefficient oxidation in
engines and poorly maintained gas fires, ovens and boilers, especially where
ventilation is inadequate.
The mechanism of CO poisoning is well understood at the biochemical level.
The gas is absorbed rapidly through the lungs and binds to the iron atom
of hemoglobin at same site as dioxygen, but about 240 times more strongly.
This prevents the efficient distribution of oxygen to the tissues. The product
of CO binding is carboxyhemoglobin. Carbon monoxide is potentially
extremely poisonous at low concentrations. Given that air contains 21% O2,
approximately 0.1% CO will saturate 50% of the hemoglobin. Concentrations
of 60% carboxyhemoglobin in the blood are usually fatal, even if maintained
for only a few minutes. A concentration of 20% carboxyhemoglobin may not
present obvious symptoms but the ability to perform tasks can be impaired.
At 20‚Äì30%, the victim may have a headache, with raised pulse, dulling of
the senses and feelings of weariness. Concentrations of 30‚Äì40% accentuate
these symptoms and decrease the blood pressure so that exertions may lead
to faintness. At 40‚Äì60% and above, the victim becomes unconscious and will
suffer convulsions. Other clinical features include pink skin, nausea, vomiting,
loss of hearing, hyperpyrexia, hyperventilation, a decrease in light sensitivity,
renal failure and acidosis.
The main target organs of CO poisoning are the heart and brain. These
organs extensively utilize aerobic metabolic pathways and so their abilities
to sustain an oxygen debt are relatively poor. Death is due to brain tissue
hypoxia although cardiac arrythmias and heart and respiratory failures may
also occur. The duration of exposure is also a factor since hypoxic cell death
is not instantaneous. Also, some individuals, for example those with anemia
(Chapter 13), are more sensitive to CO poisoning than healthy people.
The treatment of CO poisoning involves removing its source and supplying
the victim with fresh air or oxygen. The use of 100% oxygen at 2.5 s 105 Pa
pressure, that is hyperbaric oxygen, increases the rate of dissociation of

carboxyhemoglobin and reduces its plasma half-life from 250 min in a patient
breathing air to 23 min. Adding carbon dioxide can be useful as this reduces
the half-life to 12 min at normal pressure.

PARAQUAT
Paraquat (Figure 12.18) is used widely as a weed killer, hence is often found in
the home. Unfortunately paraquat has caused many hundreds of deaths both
by accidental and deliberate poisoning, the latter including both suicide and
homicide.
Paraquat is a local skin irritant, causing inflammation, although poisoning
usually follows oral ingestion. The toxic effects are dose related and with
small amounts there may be minimal damage that is reversible. Fatal doses
cause a painful death within several days or weeks, with extreme abdominal
pain, vomiting and diarrhea. The major target organs are the lungs with
larger doses causing alveolar edema, resulting in destruction of lung
tissues and fibrosis, if the patient survives beyond a few days. Pulmonary
fibrosis and respiratory failure can, however, develop up to six weeks after
ingestion. The kidneys, heart and liver may also be damaged but the lungs
are particularly susceptible in paraquat poisoning because alveolar epithelial
cells actively accumulate paraquat to toxic concentrations. Furthermore, the
presence of large concentrations of oxygen in the organs exacerbates the
morbid effects. Paraquat in alveolar epithelial cells is reduced by electron
donors, such as NADH, to a stable reduced form (Figure 12.19). Given the

However, the actions of SOD and catalase are likely to be overwhelmed in

These lead to a variety of toxic effects, such as lipid peroxidation (Figure 12.20).
The resulting lipid peroxides may give rise to lipid radicals and membrane
damage leading to tissue damage and fibrosis. Lipid peroxides will also oxidize
glutathione (Figure 12.6) and its reoxidation further reduces the depleted
amount of NADPH. This reduces the ability of the alveolar cells to carry out
essential functions, such as biosynthetic repairs.
There is no antidote for paraquat poisoning and once it has accumulated
in the lungs little can be done to prevent its toxic effects. Treatment largely
consists of trying to prevent absorption by the gut by gastric lavage and by
using Fullers Earth as an adsorbent. Hemoperfusion may also be used to
reduce the concentration of any paraquat already absorbed.

METALS
The presence of certain metals in high concentrations may be toxic to humans.
To diagnose metal toxicity, three features have to be identified, namely, a source
of the toxic metal, the presence of signs and symptoms typical of toxicity by
that metal and increased concentrations of the metal in the body tissues.
Metals that are commonly screened for toxicity include lithium, aluminum
and the heavy metals lead, arsenic, cadmium and mercury. Lithium is widely
used therapeutically to treat patients with certain psychiatric disorders.
However, plasma concentrations of lithium in excess of 1.5 mmol dm‚Äì3 should
be avoided and regular measurements of serum lithium concentrations are
important in monitoring therapy. Lithium toxicity is associated with tremors,
drowsiness, tinnitus, blurred vision, polyuria, hypothyroidism and, in severe
cases, renal failure and coma.
Acute poisoning with aluminum is extremely rare. Indeed, aluminum
compounds are used for their antacid properties. The dietary intake of
aluminum is 5 to 10 mg day‚Äì1 and this amount is removed completely by
the kidneys. Unfortunately, patients with renal failure are susceptible to
aluminum toxicity. They cannot remove the aluminum and, as the water
used in dialysis may contain aluminum that can enter the body through
the dialysis membrane, the metal can build up to toxic concentrations and
cause osteodystrophy and encephalopathy. Aluminum toxicity is diagnosed
by determining its concentration in plasma. Chronic toxicity occurs at
concentrations above only 3 Mmol dm‚Äì3 whereas 10 Mmol dm‚Äì3 can cause
acute poisoning. The treatment is aimed mainly at prevention. When
aluminum poisoning does occur, then its excretion may be enhanced using
chelating agents such as desferrioxamine.

TOXICOLOGY

BOX 12.1 Aluminum poisoning and Camelford, Cornwall
If aluminum sulfate, Al2(SO4)3.18H2O (Figure 12.21 (A)) is
dissolved in water it hydrolyzes to form sulfuric acid and a
gelatinous precipitate of aluminum hydroxide:
Al2(SO4 )3 + 6H2O m 3H2SO4 + 2Al(OH)3
An 8% solution of aluminum sulfate is commonly used in sewage
treatment and water puriÔ¨Åcation (Figure 12.21 (B)) because it is
a highly effective coagulant that reacts with suspended organic
matter to form Ô¨Çocs of large size. These rapidly settle, reducing
the load of suspended solids and the turbidity of the water or
sewage so improving their quality and lengthening the effective
life of water and sewage Ô¨Ålters.
The discharge of aluminum sulfate into aquatic environments
should be minimized as it can clog the gills of marine organisms.
With regard to handling, it is regarded as a weak acid and should
be treated accordingly: contact with eyes, skin and clothing and
repeated and prolonged exposure should be avoided. However,
tests have shown it to be a minimal irritant and a nonirritant
to rabbit eyes and skin respectively. Its LD50 dose in rabbits is
greater than 5 g kg‚Äì1 so, in general, its ingestion is thought to
be relatively harmless.
Unfortunately, in 1988 a contractor accidentally dumped

Lead is a heavy metal found in the environment. Common sources include
paints, old water pipes, petrol fumes, industrial pollution and medication
and cosmetics from the Indian subcontinent. Poisoning by lead can be acute,
which is rare, or, more commonly, chronic. It results from inhalation, dermal
absorption or ingestion, where it is actively absorbed by the GIT through the
calcium transport system. All tissues are affected by lead poisoning although
organ pathology is associated primarily with the nervous system and the
blood. In the blood, lead is concentrated in the erythrocytes where it inhibits
the activities of aminolevulinic acid (ALA) dehydratase and ferrochelatase,
enzymes involved in the synthesis of heme (Figure 12.22). Inhibition of ALA
dehydratase is the most sensitive measure of lead poisoning. Concentrations
of lead in the blood in excess of 0.49 Mmol dm‚Äì3 are associated with illness in
children. If the concentration of lead increases above 3.4 Mmol dm‚Äì3,individuals

treatment plant that supplied the 2500 residents of the
small town of Camelford in Cornwall, UK, with domestic
water. The mistake was later attributed to the contractor
being a relief driver who was not familiar with the layout of
the plant, itself an unmanned installation and so on site
advice was not available. The contaminated water entered
the town‚Äôs supplies. Its pH was as low as 3.9 and contained
concentrations of aluminum and sulfate of 620 and 4500
mg dm‚Äì3 respectively. Within two days, many residents of
Camelford complained about the poor taste of the water, skin
irritation and corrosive effects of the water on plumbing and
Ô¨Åxtures. Although the cause of the problem with the water
was not solved for two days, the responsible water authority
assured the towns people that the water, while tasting slightly
acidic, was safe to drink. Once the cause of the problem was
determined, a program of Ô¨Çushing the water supplies rapidly
reduced the concentration of aluminum to 1 mg dm‚Äì3.
After several months, over 400 complaints had been made
relating to skin rashes, sore throats, painful joints, memory
losses and exhaustion. Following the incident, the water
authority responsible was prosecuted for causing a public
nuisance and Ô¨Åned ¬£10 000 with additional legal costs of
¬£25 000.

Reports were published in 1989 and 1991 following investigations
by a UK government appointed Lowermoor Incident Health
Advisory Group into complaints of long-standing ill health in
residents of Camelford. Both studies concluded that there
was no evidence of any increase in ill health in the community
related to any toxic effects of the aluminum contamination of
the water. Rather, the symptoms suffered by affected individuals
were largely attributed to anxiety. However, these Ô¨Åndings are
inconsistent with those of a scientiÔ¨Åc study conducted in 1991,
but not published until 1999 for legal reasons, which showed
that there was an association between the contamination and
reduced cerebral functions in affected residents. Criticisms have
been aimed at this study. The incident is still surrounded with
considerable controversy, with multiple claims for damages, and
a more in-depth third inquiry into possible delayed or persistent
health effects was established by the UK government in 2001.
This inquiry reported in 2005 and concluded that although it
was unlikely that any of the chemicals involved in the water
contamination were responsible for any long-term effects, it did
recommend further studies on the effects of the contaminants
on neurological health, on diseased joints in the area and on
the development of children below the age of 12 months at the
time of the aluminum sulfate discharge.

Clinical features of lead poisoning include lethargy, abdominal discomfort,
anemia, constipation, encephalopathy and motor peripheral neuropathy.
The management of patients with lead poisoning involves identifying
the lead source and removing the patients from it. Patients are placed on
chelating agents, such as EDTA (Figure 12.23) that is effective in both acute
and chronic lead poisoning, but has to be given intravenously. Another
chelating agent, dimercaptosuccinic acid is less efficient as a chelator but
can be given orally.
Chronic arsenic poisoning is associated with well water contaminated with
arsenical pesticides or, classically, with murder! Arsenic occurs in a number of
different forms, most of which are toxic although arsenite (AsO2‚Äì) is much more

so than arsenate (HAsO4‚Äì). Arsenate substitutes for Pi in biological systems,
hence less ATP is produced. Arsenite toxicity is associated with the formation
of a stable complex with enzyme-bound lipoic acids (Figure 12.24). Indeed,
arsenic poisoning can be explained by its ability to inhibit enzymes, such as
pyruvate dehydrogenase, 2-oxoglutarate dehydrogenase and branched chain
A-oxoacid dehydrogenase, that require lipoic acid as a coenzyme. Chronic
poisoning with arsenic is usually associated with diarrhea, polyneuropathy
and dermatitis whereas acute poisoning with arsenic gives rise to severe
gastrointestinal pain, vomiting and shock. Poisoning can be diagnosed by
determining the concentration of arsenic in the hair or fingernails of the
victim. Values larger than 0.5 ¬µg g‚Äì1 of hair indicate a significant exposure to
arsenic. The hair of a person chronically exposed to arsenic could have 1000
times as much as this. Treatment of arsenic poisoning is aimed at enhancing
its excretion using chelating agents.
Chronic cadmium toxicity may occur in workers exposed to fumes in cadmiumrelated industries, although concentrations of cadmium are twice as high in
tobacco smokers compared with nonsmokers. Concentrations in the serum
greater than 90 nmol dm‚Äì3 are associated with toxicity. Cadmium poisoning
causes influenza-like symptoms, such as chills, fever, muscular aches, nausea,
vomiting, abdominal pain, and diarrhea. However, these symptoms may
resolve after a week provided there is no respiratory damage. More severe
exposures can cause bronchitis and pulmonary edema and occasionally
cardiovascular collapse. Long-term exposure may lead to nephrotoxicity with
proteinuria, bone disease and hepatotoxicity. The treatment of cadmium

BOX 12.2 The death of Napoleon: arsenic and wallpaper
Following his defeat at the Battle of Waterloo in 1815, Napoleon
Bonaparte was exiled on St Helena. This is a volcanic island only
about 6 by 8 miles in size in a remote region of the south Atlantic.
During most of his exile, Napoleon lived in Longwood House
with a retinue of about 20. Napoleon never left St Helena and he
died in 1821 (Figure 12.25). A postmortem of the body showed
an enlarged liver and stomach lesions. It was concluded he had
died of a perforated stomach ulcer that had turned cancerous.
Napoleon was initially buried on St Helena but his body was
removed 20 years later and reburied at Les Invalides on the banks
of the Seine in Paris, as had been his wish.
In 1952, Forshufvud read an account of Napoleon‚Äôs death and,
given his symptoms, concluded that Napoleon may have been
murdered by arsenic poisoning. White arsenic or arsenic oxide is
extremely poisonous and its symptoms, stomach pains, diarrhea,
shivering and swollen limbs, can be confused with other illnesses.
Indeed, a few days prior to his death, Napoleon had requested
that his doctor make a full examination, particularly of his
stomach and some of his symptoms did correspond to those of
arsenic poisoning.
It is possible to poison a person by slow exposure to small
quantities of arsenic over an extended period. A number of

Napoleon‚Äôs staff had kept locks of his hair, which were
subsequently passed down the generations. Hair is largely
composed of keratin, a protein that contains sulfur. If arsenic is
ingested, some of it will bind to the sulfur atoms and since hair
is constantly growing it can even show how the concentrations
of arsenic in the body change with time. Hair is resistant to
degradation and some of the samples of Napoleon‚Äôs hair
could still be analyzed in the 1960s using neutron activation

COMMON POISONS

poisoning usually involves removal from exposure. Treatment with chelating
agents is not effective because the soluble form of cadmium damages the
kidney.
Mercury poisoning can be acute or chronic. It occurs following exposure to
mercury vapor, inorganic salts or organic compounds of mercury. Mercury
poisoning is primarily occupational but can be caused by contaminated
food. The clinical features of acute mercury poisoning include coughing,
bronchiolitis, pulmonary edema, pneumonitis, peripheral neuropathy
and neuropsychiatric problems. Chronic mercury poisoning causes
anorexia, sweating, insomnia, impaired memory, paresthesiae of the lips
and extremities and renal tubular damage. Mercury poisoning is usually
diagnosed by determining the concentration of mercury in serum and urine.
Urine mercury/creatinine ratios are often used to assess exposure. Ratios of
40 to 100 nmol mmol‚Äì1 require monitoring and further investigation, while
values of greater than 100 nmol mmol‚Äì1 require the patient to be removed
from the source of mercury.
Acute mercury poisoning is treated with chelating agents such as dimercaprol,
to increase its excretion into bile and urine. Methylmercury is an organic form
of mercury that has been used to preserve seed grain. Methylmercury poisoning
can be caused by eating meat from animals which have been fed treated
seedgrain. An outbreak of mercury poisoning began in the 1950s in Minamata
bay in Japan and affected over 3000 villagers who ate fish contaminated with
methylmercury.

techniques. A number of hairs were found to contain abnormal
amounts of arsenic. Naturally this led to speculation that
Napoleon had been murdered. However, other possible sources
of arsenic poisoning are paints and wallpapers. The pigment,
Scheele‚Äôs Green contains copper arsenite and has been used
in fabrics and wallpapers since about 1770. Unfortunately
throughout the nineteenth century many people were made
ill or killed by this wallpaper. In 1893, Gosio determined the
pathological mechanism: if wallpapers containing Scheele‚Äôs
Green become damp and contaminated with molds, such
as Scopulariopsis brevicaulis, the molds can metabolize the
arsenic salts to volatile poisonous compounds, for example
trimethyl arsine, which are released in a vaporous form into
the atmosphere. Following a public appeal in 1980 for help
in making a radio program, a small piece of wallpaper from
the wall of the drawing room of Longwood House was located
(Figure 12.26). The sample of paper showed a single star and
its main colors are green and brown. Gold and green were the
Imperial colors but it is possible that the brown was originally
gold in color. More signiÔ¨Åcantly, X-ray Ô¨Çuorescence spectroscopy
analysis showed the wallpaper to contain appreciable quantities
of arsenic. Longwood House was notoriously damp, and
the paper would have degraded to release volatile arsenic

compounds. Further, many of its inhabitants other than
Napoleon had apparently also become ill and complained of the
‚Äòbad air‚Äô, so it is possible that he might have been a victim of
British wallpaper makers rather than a deliberate murder plot.
However, the amount of arsenic released could not have been
large, and apparently was insufÔ¨Åcient to have killed Napoleon
although once he did become ill with a stomach ulcer, the
arsenic could have exacerbated his condition.

12.6 SUMMARY
The body is exposed daily to many chemicals, some of which have the
potential for harm. These chemicals may be ingested with food and drink,
they may be therapeutic or recreational drugs or they may be toxins from
microorganisms or the abiotic environment. Xenobiotics may be detoxified
in the liver, by conversion to more water-soluble compounds, which are then
excreted through the kidneys. Sometimes this process results in more harmful
compounds being produced, as is the case with paracetamol poisoning.
Clinical investigations of suspected poisoning include liver function tests,
analysis of blood gases and determination of acid‚Äìbase status.
The commonest cases of poisoning involve accidental or deliberate overdose
with common analgesics such as paracetamol or aspirin but abuse of alcohol
is an increasing problem in developed countries, leading to liver damage in
the patient. In addition, carbon monoxide poisoning may be insidious and
fatal, in badly ventilated houses warmed by faulty gas heaters. Treatment of
poisoning first involves identification and removal of the poison; thereafter
treatment depends on the nature of the poison involved. Unfortunately, some
poisons, such as paraquat, are invariably fatal.

13.1 INTRODUCTION
Blood is a protein-rich fluid called plasma in which erythrocytes and
leukocytes, sometimes called red and white blood cells respectively, and
platelets are suspended (Figure 13.1). The cells constitute about 40‚Äì45% of
the volume of the blood. The blood is pumped around the body by the heart
through the arteries that supply the capillaries and is returned to the heart
in the veins (Chapter 14). The main functions of the blood are to distribute
oxygen, nutrients and hormones and other signaling molecules between
tissues and to remove carbon dioxide and other waste products. Plasma
contains the proteins of the clotting system and of the immune systems
(Chapters 4 and 5).
Plasma is blood from which the cells have been removed. It contains a range
of plasma proteins in addition to the clotting and immune system proteins
mentioned above, nutrients, such as glucose, waste materials, for example
urea, and a range of electrolytes in solution. If it is allowed to clot, the clear

In a text of this size it is not, of course, possible to discuss each type of blood
disorder and attention will focus only on the major types of diseases likely to
be normally encountered.

13.2 BLOOD CELLS AND PLATELETS
Figure 13.1 (A) Shows the appearance of a
normal blood smear when examined with a
microscope. The erythrocytes predominate with
the occasional leukocyte being visible. (B) The
erythrocytes are biconcave in shape and their
centers appear lighter in color.

()+

All of the cells of the blood originate from pluripotent stem cells in the bone
marrow (Figure 13.2). Chemical signals, such as cytokines (Chapter 4), direct
primordial stem cells to develop in different ways to produce erythrocytes,
leukocytes of various types, and megakaryocytes, which are the precursors
of platelets.
Normoblasts are erythroid cells that arise from divisions of pluripotent stem
cells. Eventually these lose their nuclei giving rise to reticulocytes, which
contain mRNAs for globins and are still able to synthesize hemoglobin (Hb),
and which are the precursors of the erythrocytes. The reticulocytes circulate in
the blood for 1 2 days before maturing to erythrocytes, and normally constitute
1 2% of the circulating red cells. Erythrocytes are the most numerous cells
in the blood. Adult males and females have erythrocyte counts of about 5.5
and 4.8 s 1012 dm‚Äì3, respectively. The number of cells in a given volume of
blood can be determined using a hemocytometer (Figure 13.3). About 2 s 1011
mature erythrocytes are formed daily. They have no nuclei or other organelles
and are biconcave in shape (Figure 13.1). Erythrocytes circulate for about 120
days and are then removed from circulation and destroyed by macrophages in
the liver and spleen. Hemoglobin is the red protein found in the erythrocytes
that carries dioxygen (O2) and which also plays an important role in buffering,
maintaining the pH at 7.4 p 0.1 (Chapter 9). The iron-containing heme
is removed from the Hb of defunct erythrocytes and its porphyrin ring is
converted to bilirubin, which is excreted in the bile. The iron is conserved
and recycled (Box 13.1). Iron circulates in the blood attached to a transport

protein called transferrin and stored in the liver and spleen cells in a storage
protein called ferritin (Figure 13.4 (A) and (B)). Excessive breakdown of Hb
produces more bilirubin than can be excreted and this accumulates in the
tissues causing jaundice (Chapter 11).

done for erythrocytes and leukocytes. In hospital
laboratories cells counts are done automatically
using instruments called cell counters.

DISORDERS OF THE BLOOD

BOX 13.1 Iron metabolism
Only about 10% of the average daily intake of iron, approximately
20 mg in the UK, is absorbed, mostly by the duodenum and
jejunum (Chapter 11), although more is absorbed in pregnancy
and in iron deÔ¨Åciency anemia (Section 13.5). There are obviously
increased demands for iron in growth periods and menstruation,
when about 0.7 mg iron is lost daily, and in pregnancy (Chapter
7). Heme iron from Hb and myoglobin in red meats is better
absorbed than nonheme iron. Absorption is controlled by the
mucosal cells of the small intestine and the iron is to some extent
stored in these cells before being passed to the hepatic portal
blood. Stored iron may be lost when these cells are shed. The
iron is bound to the iron binding protein transferrin (Figure 13.4
(A)) during its transport in the blood. Transferrin can carry two
atoms of iron per molecule but is only about one-third saturated
on average. The iron is detached from the transferrin in the bone
marrow when the protein interacts with speciÔ¨Åc receptors on
erythroblasts and reticulocytes supplying the iron needed for
Hb synthesis. Although 60 70% of the body‚Äôs iron is found in
circulation as Hb, with more in the cytochromes and other iron
proteins; some is stored in the protein, ferritin (Figure 13.4 (B)).
This protein is found in most cells, but particularly in those of
the liver and spleen.
The body does not have an excretory route for iron, but this is
normally a problem only when repeated transfusions are given,
such as in the cases of patients with sickle cell anemia and
thalassemia. As the transfused erythrocytes are broken down
the iron accumulates and may form deposits of hemosiderin in
the liver and spleen.

hold more than 2000 iron atoms as hydrated ferric hydroxide.

There are several types of leukocytes or white cells in the blood, each with
its own function. The total white cell count in an adult is between 4 and 11
x 109 dm‚Äì3 but there is considerable variation. White cells were originally
classified on the basis of which microscopic stain they took up, whether they
had a granular cytoplasm, and whether the nucleus was lobed. The three main
types of leukocyte are called polymorphonucleocytes (PMN, but sometimes
referred to as polymorphs), lymphocytes and monocytes (Chapter 4).
Polymorphonucleocytes are further subdivided into neutrophils (57% of the
total white cell population) that contain neutral staining granules, eosinophils
(3.5%) which contain acid-staining granules, and basophils (0.5%) which
contain basic staining granules (Figure 13.2). Polymorphonucleocytes release
chemokines some of which are mediators of inflammation as described in
Chapter 4. Neutrophils can migrate to areas of infection and phagocytose
bacteria. Eosinophils seem to be more concerned with dealing with larger
parasites and their number also increases in allergic diseases. Basophils and
the similar mast cells (Chapter 4), which are found mostly in the skin, can
release histamine from their granules and this also contributes to some types
of allergic responses.

Lymphocytes are key components of the immune system. Monocytes circulate
in the blood for about 72 h and then enter the tissues and transform into
macrophages, which play a key role in inflammation and defense (Chapter 4).
Platelets are vesicle-like structures about 3 Mm in diameter with a volume of
7 fdm3 (femtodecimeters3 or femtoliters). They are formed by the fragmentation
of large precursor cells called megakaryocytes and, like erythrocytes, are not
complete cells although they contain numerous granules, some organelles and
a tubular system (Figure 13.5). Their lifespan is 10 12 days and they function
in blood clotting or hemostasis (Section 13.4).

Hemoglobin is the red-colored, oxygen-transporting protein in erythrocytes.
Its Mr is about 64 000 and it is made up of four subunits, each containing an
iron-containing heme group (Figure 13.6). Each molecule can carry up to four
O2 molecules. Oxygen is taken up as the blood passes through the lungs and
is transported to all parts of the body allowing respiration, the oxidation of
fuels, to occur in the mitochondria. The iron in the heme group of Hb remains
in the ferrous (Fe(II)) state throughout. Should the iron become oxidized to
Fe(III), methemoglobin is formed, which is incapable of carrying oxygen. This
oxidation happens to a small extent continuously, so that normal blood always
contains a few percent of methemoglobin. However, methemoglobin reductase,
present in erythrocytes, constantly catalyzes its reduction back to Hb. The rare
individuals with a genetic deficiency of this enzyme have severe problems and
tend to be cyanosed unless they are treated with a reducing agent.
Hemoglobin was one of the first proteins to have its complete structure
determined. Indeed, because Hb is so important medically, it is fair to say
that more is probably known about Hb than any other protein. It is vital to life
because the low solubility of oxygen in water means that insufficient amounts
can be carried by blood in solution. The binding of O2 to Hb in erythrocytes

inadequate oxygen intake in the
lungs or from many other reasons,
for example the stagnation of blood
in the circulation during heart failure.

increases the oxygen carrying capacity several thousand-fold. Furthermore,
the body has a limited capacity to work anaerobically and so O2 is vital. Even
a small reduction in the amount of Hb in the blood leads to anemia, which
causes serious clinical problems (Section 13.5). Anemia can result from there
being too few erythrocytes or from each erythrocyte having too little or a
defective Hb and this may be a consequence of a lack of iron. In all cases,
medical treatment is usually necessary.

hemoglobin. PDB code 1GZX. Note how the four
subunits interact closely with each other. The
bound O2 are shown in red.

Tissues

When an O2 binds to one subunit, it induces a small change in the shape of the
protein making the binding of the next O2 slightly easier, that is, the strength
of binding changes with each successive addition. The consequence is that
the graph of oxygen bound against oxygen concentration, the oxygen binding
curve (Figure 13.7), is S-shaped or sigmoidal. This means that in the lungs
the HbA molecule can become nearly 100% saturated with oxygen but in the
tissues can release almost all of it.

Lungs

Hemoglobin molecules are roughly spherical with the four subunits fitting
tightly together. The subunits of Hb are all similar and are in identical pairs.
Thus, for example, adult Hb, referred to as HbA, can be described as A2B2.
Embryonic and fetal Hbs also occur. The heme groups are hydrophobic and
sit inside hydrophobic clefts in the protein. The iron atom within each heme
binds one O2 molecule and so Hb can successively bind four O2. The strength
of this binding, that is the oxygen affinity, can be measured. In the lungs, where
there is abundant oxygen, Hb should bind its maximum of four molecules and
become saturated. In the tissues, the oxygen must ‚Äòunbind‚Äô and be released.
The strength of binding is critical; too weak and Hb would be ineffective as a
carrier, too tight and the tissues would not be supplied with oxygen because
the oxyhemoglobin would not release its oxygen.

tension is high, the hemoglobin becomes almost
saturated with oxygen. In the tissues, where the
oxygen tension is low, the hemoglobin is able to
give up almost all of its oxygen.

BOX 13.2 Nomenclature of mutant hemoglobins
Two nomenclature systems are in use, which may be a little
confusing. Originally, normal adult Hb was called hemoglobin
A (HbA, A for adult, A2B2). Fetal Hb was hemoglobin F (HbF,
A2G2), sickle cell Hb was HbS and so on. However, as more Hb
mutations were identiÔ¨Åed, and hundreds are known, it was
realized that the number of mutations known exceeded the
number of letters in the alphabet. Subsequently, Hbs began
to be named after the geographic location where they were
Ô¨Årst discovered, for example Hb Dakar, Hb Lepore, Hb Sydney.
An additional complication occurs when newly discovered
Hbs have the same characteristics as a ‚Äòletter‚Äô Hb and both

(*%

nomenclatures may be combined, as in, for instance, HbJCapetown. It is appreciated that this nomenclature is not
perfect but it is too difÔ¨Åcult to change now.
The precise mutation can of course be described in terms of the
base change(s) when as is usual the gene sequence is known,
but this is a little cumbersome for everyday use. Thus Hb Sydney
is caused by a GTG to GGG mutation at position 67 in the gene
for B globin, causing an amino acid residue change from valine
to alanine. This results in unstable Hb with poor heme-binding
properties, resulting in mild hemolysis. Table 13.2 gives some
examples of mutant Hbs.

EMBRYONIC AND FETAL HEMOGLOBINS
The embryonic and the fetal forms of Hb differ slightly from HbA. There are
several types of embryonic Hb present early in embryonic life but at about
6 weeks there is a switch to fetal Hb (HbF). Fetal Hb has two A subunits, as
in the adult, but two G subunits, (A2G2, and there are actually two types of G
subunit). The embryo and fetus obtain their oxygen from the mother‚Äôs blood
in the placenta. Thus their Hbs need to become saturated with oxygen at lower
oxygen tensions than maternal HbA so they can obtain it from the mother
(Figure 13.8). This is possible because embryonic and fetal Hbs have a greater
affinity for O2 than HbA. Adult Hb production starts shortly before birth and
by 30 weeks of age it should have replaced all the HbF (Figure 13.9).

In hereditary persistence of fetal

a failure of the switching mechanism

DISORDERS OF THE BLOOD

13.4 HEMOSTASIS AND BLOOD CLOTTING

Fibrinogen

The circulatory system is self-sealing. Hemostasis rapidly stops all but the
most catastrophic bleeding in normal individuals. If the lining of a blood vessel
is damaged, eventually a platelet plug is formed that prevents further blood
loss. Blood clotting is then initiated leading to the deposition of fibrin and the
formation of a clot to seal the wound. Wound healing can then begin.

Blood clotting occurs in one of two pathways, the so-called intrinsic and
extrinsic pathways. These pathways each have a number of unique reactions
but, in the end, both pathways activate the final clotting stage, which is the
formation of fibrin. The clotting pathways involve a group of plasma proteins
that act in sequence, each activating the next in line. The end result is the
conversion of soluble fibrinogen to the insoluble fibrin, which polymerizes to
form a clot at the site of the damage and critically not elsewhere (Figure 13.10).
About 20 plasma proteins or plasma clotting factors are produced by the liver
and circulate in the blood as inactive proteins. They were called factors long
before anything was known of their chemical nature. They are identified by
Roman numerals although some of them also have common names (Table
13.3). However, their numbering is unfortunately not in a logical order with

Fibrinogen has a Mr about 340 000 and consists
of two units, each containing three polypeptides
(A, B, G joined together at their N-terminal ends
by a number of disulÔ¨Åde bonds. Short lengths of
the amino terminal regions of the two A and two
B polypeptides project outwards and cleavage
of these by thrombin, as indicated, allows the
resulting Ô¨Åbrin molecules to aggregate to form a
‚Äòsoft clot‚Äô. This is subsequently strengthened by
the cross-linking action of Factor XIIIa which is a
transglutaminase.

reference to the clotting process. Their activated forms are distinguished by
a lower case ‚Äòa‚Äô; thus the activation of Factor VIII produces Factor VIIIa. Many
of them become proteases when activated but, as each factor catalytically
activates the next one in sequence, a small amount of the first factor produces
a very large reaction at the end of the pathway. Thus the cascade of clotting
reactions is an amplification of an initial small stimulus and leads to the
production of large amounts of fibrin forming a clot.
It is convenient to divide clotting factors into four groups based on what
they do in the clotting process. The first group consists of zymogens, which
become active proteases when subjected to specific proteolytic cleavage. The
second group contains cofactor proteins that bind to zymogens and their
protease products, increasing the specificity and speed of the activation.
The third group of factors contains protease inhibitors, which inactivate the
proteases after their roles in the clotting process are complete. The fourth
group is a miscellaneous group. It includes fibrinogen, which is cleaved to
form fibrin, Factor XIII/XIIIa, a transglutaminase that catalyzes the formation
of covalent cross-links between fibrin molecules, which stabilizes the clot,
and von Willebrand factor which can anchor platelets to the endothelium of
blood vessels and which also carries Factor VIII in the plasma.

THE INTRINSIC PATHWAY
The intrinsic pathway is a sequence of reactions that are catalyzed by
enzymes, which become activated when tissue is injured (Figure 13.11).
This pathway can take several minutes for completion. Damage to the wall
of a blood vessel or to the endothelium that lines it (Chapter 14) results in
the exposure of collagen to which platelets stick and become activated.
The platelets degranulate, releasing a range of highly active substances,
including serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine or 5-HT) and ADP, as well as
certain growth factors, such as platelet derived growth factor (PDGF), which
has a role in subsequent wound healing. Serotonin (Figure 7.5) is a powerful
vasoconstrictor and causes the blood vessel to constrict, temporarily limiting
the blood supply to the damaged area until clotting takes place. This is a
temporary effect, and a clot must form soon. The period before blood flow
stops is called the bleeding time and is normally two to six min. Platelet
aggregation occurs as the released ADP activates other platelets and these
in turn activate others to extend pseudopodia and become sticky and clump
with those already adhering to the damaged area. This forms a plug that
prevents further blood loss. Fibrin is then deposited in the loose platelet
plug, which traps more platelets as well as blood cells, strengthening the clot.
The clotting time is usually six to 12 min.
A complex cascade of reactions is required to produce fibrin. These are initiated
by the binding of Factor XII (Hageman factor) to tissue collagen and anionic
surfaces that somehow changes its conformation to Factor VIIa allowing it to
convert prekallikrein to kallikrein. Kallikreins are serine endopeptidases that
are widely distributed in mammalian tissues and body fluids. Plasma kallikrein,
also known as kininogenin or Fletcher Factor, cleaves bonds in kininogen to
produce a varied group of polypeptides, which include angiotensin, bradykinin,
substance P and secretin. Kallikrein also activates the bound Factor XII to form
Factor XIIa, in a reaction that also requires high Mr kininogen as a cofactor.
Factor XIIa and high Mr kininogen activate Factor XI (plasma thromboplastin
antecedent) to Factor XIa. Factor XIa also binds to the exposed surfaces of the
tissue where injury has occurred. Here it catalyzes the conversion of Factor
IX (Christmas factor) to Factor IXa in a reaction that requires Ca2+. The final
reaction, unique to the intrinsic pathway, involves the conversion of Factor X
(Stuart factor) to Factor Xa, the final product, and is catalyzed by Factor IXa.
This reaction also requires Factor VIII, the antihemolytic factor found on the
surface of aggregated platelets and Ca2+.

DISORDERS OF THE BLOOD

THE EXTRINSIC PATHWAY
The extrinsic pathway is so called because it requires the nonplasma protein,
thromboplastin to initiate the cascade (Figure 13.11). Thromboplastin is an
integral membrane protein found in many tissues but especially the walls of
blood vessels, brain, lung and placenta. The initial reaction is the conversion
of Factor VII (proconvertin) to Factor VIIa in a reaction that requires Ca2+
and phospholipids released from the injured tissue or from the surface of
aggregated platelets. Damaged tissues also release thromboplastin which,
in combination with Factor VIIa and Factor IXa from the intrinsic pathway,
directly activates Factor X to Xa. The final result of this part of the pathway is
the production of Factor Xa. Thus the final product of the extrinsic pathway,
like the intrinsic, is the production of Factor Xa. Despite this, deficiencies in
either pathway result in prolonged bleeding times.

HEMOSTASIS AND BLOOD CLOTTING

COMMON FINAL PATHWAY
Factor Xa from the intrinsic and extrinsic pathways catalyzes the hydrolysis
of Factor II, or prothrombin to thrombin (Figure 13.11). There is an
intermediate stage as prothrombin is first converted into prethrombin,
which is slowly converted to thrombin. Factor Xa by itself is a relatively
slow prothrombin activator, but its activity is enhanced about 20 000-fold
by Ca2+, Factor V (proaccelerin) and negatively charged phospholipids, for
example phosphatidylserine, from damaged cell membranes. These types
of phospholipids occur almost exclusively on the cytosolic sides of cell
membranes, which, of course, are not usually in contact with the blood. Hence
clotting reactions take place on the surface of the platelets so that the clotting
action is confined to the sites of injuries.

Fibrinogen

Thrombin
Fibrinopeptides

Fibrin

Thrombin is a serine protease that catalyzes the hydrolysis of fibrinogen to
fibrin, the final reaction of the clotting cascade. Fibrinogen forms 2 3% of the
plasma proteins. It consists of three pairs of polypeptides and two pairs of
oligosaccharides (Figure 13.12).
Thrombin cleaves four peptide bonds in the fibrinogen molecule, releasing two
A and two B fibrin peptides from the amino terminal ends of the fibrinogen
polypeptides changing the net charge from positive to negative. In the
presence of Factor XIIIa and Ca2+, the fibrin monomers polymerize producing
a stable clot. The clots formed are strengthened by cross-links formed by the
transaminase, Factor XIIIa, which is also activated by thrombin. Within the
clot, the platelets contract, reducing the clot to less than half its original size
and one that is tougher and more elastic. The process also draws the edges of
the wound together.

PREVENTION OF CLOTTING
It is clearly important that clots do not form in the absence of injury. There
are several systems to prevent this occurring. The protein factors constantly
circulate in the blood but, of course, require specific activation before clotting
can take place; in addition, the liver removes activated factors. However,
this is a slow preventative measure. A more rapid mechanism is effected by
antithrombin III, which is a natural clotting inhibitor that binds to all of the
serine proteases of the clotting cascade, especially thrombin, and inhibits
their proteolytic activities. Heparin (Figure 13.13), a sulfated polysaccharide
found in the circulation, activates antithrombin III. In addition, the plasma
protein, A2-macroglobulin also inhibits the clotting cascade. Patients with
antithrombin III deficiency have an increased risk of thrombosis and resistance
to the action of heparin.

DISORDERS OF THE BLOOD

DISSOLUTION OF CLOTS
Clots on the skin surface eventually scab and are largely removed by abrasion.
However, internal clots are eventually destroyed by a process called fibrinolysis.
Again, a cascade of reactions is involved. Fibrin activates plasminogen
activator, a protein that as its name implies, converts plasminogen to plasmin.
Plasmin is a hydrolytic enzyme that catalyzes the digestion of fibrin and
dissolves the clot. Plasminogen activator has a high affinity for fibrin clots and
it and a tissue-type plasminogen activator (t-PA), bind to the clot and activate
plasminogen.
In some instances, such as prolonged bleeding, shock and some types of
cancer, plasminogen activator can be activated in the absence of fibrin. In
these cases, plasminogen activators, such as streptokinase or t-PA are given
to patients to dissolve blood clots to try to reduce the damage caused by
myocardial infarction (Chapter 14).

13.5 ANEMIAS

Margin Note 13.5 Hematological
indices

i

The measured erythrocyte values for
Hb concentration, packed cell volume
(PCV) and erythrocyte count (RBC)
allows four hematological indices
to be calculated. These are the
packed cell volume (PCV), mean cell
volume (MCV), mean cell Hb (MCH)
and mean cell Hb concentration
(MCHC). The PCV can be measured
using a hematocrit (Figure 13.14) or
an automated cell counter (Figure
13.15). It can also be derived as
the product of the MCV and RBC.
The MCV is obtained by dividing
the PCV by the RBC. The MCH can
be calculated by dividing the Hb
concentration of whole blood by
RBC. The MCHC can be obtained by
dividing the Hb concentration by
the PCV. The normal values for these
indices are given in Table 13.4.

(*+

Anemia develops when the amount of Hb in the blood falls below the reference
levels for an individual‚Äôs age and sex (Table 13.4) and there is insufficient
iron for Hb synthesis. Anemia may be caused by major blood loss, or as a
consequence of defects with Hb, the hemoglobinopathies, and by deficiencies
of, for example, iron or some vitamins (Section 13.6). The characteristic signs
of anemia are pallor, tachycardia, a fast heart rate, cardiac failure (Chapter 14)
and epithelial changes including brittle nails, spoon-shaped nails, atrophy of
the tongue papillae, angular stomatitis and brittle hair. Other signs specific
to the type of anemia may also be present. However, anemic patients may be
asymptomatic, even when the anemia is quite severe, or may present with
various nonspecific symptoms, such as fatigue, headache, breathlessness,
angina on effort or palpitations (Chapter 14). Rapid onset of anemia tends
to cause more symptoms than slow onset, and the elderly tolerate anemia
less well than the young when the normal compensation of increased cardiac
output is impaired. The body responds to anemia with a variety of physiological
responses. For example, the heart responds with an increased stroke volume
and tachycardia to increase its output (Chapter 14). The oxygen binding curve
of Hb can be modified by the production of 2,3 bisphosphoglycerate (BPG),
which increases the release of O2 from oxyhemoglobin to the tissues. In iron
deficiency anemia, the concentration of BPG can increase by 40‚Äì75%.

ANEMIAS

The reduced amount of Hb in anemia is usually accompanied by a reduction in
the erythrocyte count and the packed cell volume that are usually determined
in hospital laboratories using an automated blood analysis system (Figure
13.15). These types of systems can determine all hematological indices, for
example the Hb concentration, packed cell volume (PCV) and the erythrocyte
count (RBC), for numerous samples rapidly and efficiently. The mean cell
volume (MCV), mean cell Hb (MCH) and mean cell Hb concentration
(MCHC) can be derived from these measured values (Margin Note 13.5). The
investigation of anemia should also consider the reticulocyte, white cell and
platelet counts and any abnormal morphology as seen in a blood and/or
marrow when examined with a microscope.
The three major types of anemias are the normocytic, microcytic and
macrocytic, which are classified largely in terms of erythrocyte indices,
especially their MCVs. Normocytic anemias, that is with normal sized
erythrocytes, are associated with acute blood loss and a variety of disease
states. However, the microcytic and macrocytic anemias are associated with
observable changes to the sizes of erythrocytes in the blood sample and
distinctive changes to the bone marrow appearance (Table 13.5). Thus the
classification of anemias starts from routine hematological investigations.
Their diagnosis involves taking a medical history and a clinical investigation
of the patient, especially, of course, blood and marrow examinations to
determine any changes in erythrocyte size.

The major causes of microcytic anemias are iron deficiency, thalassemias
(Section 13.6), sideroblastic anemia and the anemia of chronic disease. Iron
is difficult to absorb because of problems connected with the low solubility of
its salts, its oxidation state, and interaction with other components of the diet.
Loss of iron also occurs in hemorrhage and menstruation (Box 13.1).
Iron deficiency anemia, the commonest cause of anemia worldwide, shows
a number of characteristic features. The erythrocytes (Figure 13.16) are
microcytic, with an MCV of less than 80 fdm3, and hypochromic, the MCH
being less than 27 pg. There is variation in, cell sizes, anisocytosis and
poikilocytosis, that is abnormal shapes, and a reduced reticulocyte count.
There are also changes in the bone marrow, for example erythroid hypoplasia
and decreased iron deposits. The serum iron decreases while the serum
iron binding capacity increases compared with their normal concentration

to its total iron binding capacity, falls below 19%, compared with a more
usual 30% or so. The concentration of serum ferritin resulting from cellular
degradation is regarded as the most reliable measurement of anemia. Patients
may also show an impaired ability to maintain body temperature, depressed
muscle function and abnormal thyroid hormone metabolism.

The underlying cause of the iron deficiency should be identified by the
appropriate tests and taking a careful history of the patient. To counteract
the deficiency, 600 mg of ferrous sulfate is given orally each day. If there are
side effects, such as nausea, diarrhea or constipation, then ferrous gluconate
may be substituted. Failure to respond to the treatment may be due to lack
of patient compliance, continuing hemorrhage, severe malabsorption, or
another cause for the anemia. It may be necessary to give iron parentally if
absorption is defective, as for example in patients with ulcerative colitis or
Crohn‚Äôs disease (Chapter 11).

ANEMIAS

MACROCYTIC ANEMIA
Macrocytic anemias are characterized by the presence of anemia and
erythrocytes of variable shapes but with diameters in excess of 9 Lm and
MCVs characteristically greater than 96 fdm3 (Table 13.4). The condition may
be caused by certain liver diseases, including alcoholism, that produces large
rounded cells or by megaloblastic anemia, which is associated with enlarged
oval cells. The latter is also indicated by the presence of the erythrocyte
precursors, erythroblasts (megaloblasts) in blood. The increased proportion
of immature forms of all cell lines reflects the premature death of cells in the
process of development (Figure 13.17). The cells are large, although there is a
substantial variation in size, and they have large, immature nuclei. The basis of
the problem is the inability to synthesize deoxythymidine monophosphate from
methylated deoxyuridine monophosphate. The methyl group is supplied by
the folate coenzyme, methylene tetrahydrofolate polyglutamate and deficiency
of folate reduces its supply. A deficiency of vitamin B12 (Figure 13.18(A)) also
reduces its supply by slowing the demethylation of methyl tetrahydrofolate.
Thus deficiencies of vitamins B12 or folate (Chapter 10) or other defects, for
example genetic ones, that affect DNA biosynthesis in the bone marrow,
produce an asynchrony between nuclear and cytoplasmic development and a
delayed maturation of blood cells and result in megaloblastic anemia.
Vitamin B12, also called cobalamin, is found in animal products and is produced
by certain microorganisms but not by plants. It is liberated from protein
complexes by gastric enzymes and binds to a glycoprotein called intrinsic
factor (Chapters 10 and 11). This is secreted by the gastric parietal cells along
with H+ and carries vitamin B12 to specific receptors on the mucosal surface
of the ileum. Although the vitamin enters the ileal enterocytes, the intrinsic
factor remains in the lumen of the gut. Transport in the blood is by another
protein, transcobalamin. Atrophy of the gastric mucosa and consequent failure
to produce intrinsic factor leads to the malabsorption of the vitamin, whose
deficiency results in pernicious anemia. Cytotoxic IgG antibodies directed
against gastric parietal cells and/or against intrinsic factor are found in the
serum in about 90% of individuals with pernicious anemia. In a majority of
these individuals the antibodies are also present in the gastric juice and either
prevent the binding of vitamin B12 to intrinsic factor or inhibit the absorption
of the vitamin B12: intrinsic factor complex.

Figure 13.17 A photomicrograph of a marrow
smear from a patient with megaloblastic anemia.
The MCV is over 95 fdm3 and the macrocytes
are typically oval in shape. The bone marrow
is usually hypercellular and the normoblasts
(erythroblasts ) are large and show failure
of nuclear maturation with an open, Ô¨Åne,
primitive (stippled) chromatin pattern. Giant and
abnormally shaped cells called myelocytes are
present.

The onset of the disease is insidious with progressively increasing symptoms
of anemia. Patients show achlorhydria, a low or absence of gastric acid
secretion, and lack of secreted intrinsic factor. There may be jaundice because
of excessive breakdown of Hb and because erythropoiesis in the bone marrow
is deficient. The serum bilirubin may be increased and the serum vitamin
B12 concentration is usually considerably below its physiological value of
approximately 160 ng dm‚Äì3. However, the polyneuropathogical symptoms
make it important that treatment is not delayed as they can become
irreversible; patients present with symmetrical paraesthesia in the fingers
and toes, an early loss of vibration sense and ataxia. Paraplegia may be the
result. Pernicious anemia is predominantly a disease of the elderly with one
in 8000 of the over 60 population being affected in the UK. It also seems to be
associated with certain autoimmune diseases, such as thyroid and Addison‚Äôs
diseases (Chapter 7).
The causes of folate (Figure 13.18 (B)) deficiency are nutritional, for
example a poor intake of green vegetables, such as broccoli and spinach
and offal, alcohol excess, cancer, or excessive utilization in pregnancy and
lactation and the use of antifolate drugs, such as methotrexate, phenytoin
and pyrimethamine. The clinical manifestations of folate deficiency are
megaloblastic anemia with a serum folate concentration that is lower than
the reference value of 4 to 18 Mg dm 3.

The deoxyuridine suppression test for megaloblastic anemia is performed by
adding tritiated thymidine (3H-thymidine) to a sample of bone marrow. Bone
marrow samples may be obtained by aspiration or by trephine. Aspiration,
using a specialized needle, is usually carried out at the iliac crest with a local
anesthetic. In normal marrow less than 5% of the 3H-thymidine is usually
taken up, but in megaloblastic marrow up to 50% of it may be used. The
microscopic picture of the bone marrow can be investigated by using the
aspirate to make a smear on a microscopy slide. If a larger sample of bone
marrow is required, the posterior iliac crest is used but a longer and wider
needle is used to obtain a ‚Äòcore‚Äô of bone. This core is fixed and decalcified
over several days and then stained for microscopy.
It is important to distinguish pernicious anemia from other causes of
megaloblastic anemia, such as folate deficiency, because this will affect
treatment. However, this is usually clear from the blood concentrations of
these two vitamins. Also, the ability to absorb vitamin B12 can be measured
using the Schilling test in which patients are given vitamin B12 radioactivelylabeled with 58Co. The urine is collected over a period of 24 h and the amount
of radioactivity measured.
Vitamin B12 deficiency is treated by intramuscular injection of 1 mg of
the pure vitamin, to a total of 6 mg over a period of three weeks. Oral
administration is obviously unsuccessful in pernicious anemia because of the
lack of intrinsic factor. A maintenance dose of 1 mg every three months is
then given for the rest of the patient‚Äôs life. Clinical improvement may occur
within a few days (provided that the neuropathy has not been long-standing)
and a reticulocytosis is observed a few days later. Folate deficiency can be
corrected by giving 5 mg of folic acid daily, and this usually produces a rapid
hematological response. Prophylactic folate is recommended for all women
during pregnancy and especially for women who have had a previous child
with a neural tube defect.

HEMOGLOBINOPATHIES

13.6 HEMOGLOBINOPATHIES
Hemoglobinopathies are clinical conditions that result from mutations that
change the sequences of bases in DNA of the genes for globins (Chapter 15).
If the bases in the DNA are changed even by a single one, then a modified
protein may be produced (or no protein at all). The consequences can be
negligible, severe or fatal. Mutations are inherited and, if the disease is not
fatal, then the disease symptoms will be inherited too. The severity of the
disease may depend on whether one or both copies of the gene in question
carry the mutation, in other words, whether the individual is homozygous
or a heterozygote. The mutations involved in hemoglobinopathies include
point mutations, the largest group, that substitute one amino acid residue for
another, insertions or deletion of one or more residues, drastic changes caused
by frameshift mutations (Margin Note 13.6) and alterations in the lengths of
the polypeptide chains by mutations that produce or destroy stop codons.
In normal adult humans, there are two A- and one B-globin genes, coding for
polypeptides of 141 and 146 amino acid residues respectively, which go to
form HbA, A2B2. In a diploid cell there are actually four A and two B genes. Each
of these genes has two introns (Margin Note 13.7). The A genes are located on
chromosome 16 and the B genes on chromosome 11. If there is a mutation, it
may have been inherited from one or both parents giving a heterozygous or
homozygous condition respectively. A mutation in an A gene tends to have
less serious consequences than one in a B gene because there may still be
nonmutated copies of the A gene present. Nevertheless, even small changes
in the structure of the Hb protein can sometimes result in disastrous clinical
effects. Over 750 Hb mutations are known. They usually only affect one type
of subunit because there are separate genes for the A- and the B-globins (Table
13.2).
Originally, many of the different mutant Hbs were identified by their
mobilities in electrophoresis (Figure 13.19) and peptide mapping (Box 13.3)
but now, of course, the DNA can be analyzed directly. A major technical
advance has been the ability to make DNA probes that are specific for Aor B-chains. This means it is possible to identify which mRNAs are being
produced and identify any mutations present. Thus the different clinical
variants can be understood at the molecular level. For example, in so-called
‚Äòhemoglobin H disease‚Äô it has been shown that there is only one of the four
possible A-globin genes present and functioning, so that only 25% of the
normal amount of A-chain mRNA is produced. The mutation causing this
situation is a deletion not a point mutation.
The majority of mutations are harmless and therefore do not produce a
hemoglobinopathy because they do not cause disease. For example, mutations

Margin Note 13.6 Frameshift
mutations

i

In the genetic code, sequences of
three bases or codons code for each
amino acid residue. A change in one
base may cause the incorporation of
a different (or ‚Äòwrong‚Äô) residue, such
as occurs in HbS. However, if one or
more bases is lost or added then the
reading frame of the code is shifted.
Instead of a single amino acid being
changed, a totally new sequence may
be produced, which may result in the
production of a different protein or
often no protein at all, depending
upon where in the sequence the
frameshift occurs.

Margin Note 13.7 Introns and
exons

i

The majority of genes in eukaryotic
cells are not continuous but are
arranged in sections along the DNA
of the chromosome. The coding
sequences are called exons, and
the noncoding portions in between
are called intervening sequences
or introns. In order to make
the messenger RNA that can be
translated to produce a polypeptide,
an RNA transcript of the DNA is
made, that is one with introns and
exons transcribed, and then the
intron coded sections are cut out and
the exposed ends joined together
in a process called splicing. This
is a normal part of the processes
that produce a mRNA that can be
translated to produce a polypeptide
in eukaryotic cells.

Margin Note 13.8 Heinz bodies

i

Heinz bodies or Heinz-Ehrlich
bodies were Ô¨Årst reported in 1890
by the German physician Heinz
(1865‚Äì1924) as inclusions in the
erythrocytes of some patients with
hemolytic anemia. They are known
to be aggregates of denatured,
precipitated Hb, which associate
with the erythrocyte membrane
(Figure 13.20). This causes the
erythrocyte to become misshaped
and leads to anemia. The bodies are
best seen when the blood is stained
with crystal violet. Heinz bodies
are associated with certain type of
hereditary hemolytic anemia, for
example hemolytic anemia of infancy.
Oxidative damage to Hb by a
number of toxic chemicals, including
nitrobenzene, diphenylamine,
naphthalene and hydroxylamine and
a number of its derivatives can also
result in Heinz body formation. They
also have iatrogenic causes and may
result from sensitivity to some drugs,
for example primaquine especially in
glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase
deÔ¨Åciency (Section 13.7) and
sulfonamides and can appear after a
splenectomy.

DISORDERS OF THE BLOOD

distant from the heme binding cleft, or from the regions of subunit contact
may have little effect on the properties of the Hb. However, mutations may
change the shape of the globin subunit(s), the binding of the heme groups
or even prevent globin synthesis, all with severe clinical consequences. To
function properly, the four subunits in the Hb molecule must fit together
tightly but still produce a molecule that is flexible. The regions of contact
have been conserved in evolution and are essential for normal functions,
such as the cooperative binding of O2 (Figure 13.7). Thus mutations can upset
the delicate balance of interactions between the amino acid side chains with
several consequences. The molecule may dissociate upon deoxygenation and,
in some cases, the monomers may precipitate in the erythrocytes reducing O2
affinity. Microscopically, the denatured and precipitated Hb can be seen as
Heinz bodies (Margin Note 13.8 and Figure 13.20). A deletion of one or more
amino acid residues or substitution mutations can produce this effect, as in Hb
Leiden and Hb Philly respectively. There may also be cell membrane damage,
with intravascular hemolysis, anemia, reticulocytosis and splenomegaly as
consequences. In other cases, a small change in the regions that bind the
heme groups may make the pockets slightly less hydrophobic so that it does
not bind appropriately, and again, the denatured Hb can precipitate to form
Heinz bodies. Thus only two of the four subunits may have heme groups. In
other cases, the change in the pocket allows the iron to become oxidized to the
Fe3+(III) state (methemoglobin), which will not bind O2. The resulting condition
is referred to as methemoglobinemia and patients become cyanosed because
they lack oxygen (Margin Note 13.2).
This chapter will concentrate on two hemoglobinopathies, sickle cell
anemia, which arises from a point mutation, and a group of diseases called
the thalassemias that seem to originate from point mutations or very small
deletions.

SICKLE CELL ANEMIA
Sickle cell anemia was first described in a black patient in the USA in 1904, a
time when little was known of the structures of proteins. The patient presented
with severe pain and a microscopic examination of a blood sample showed
sickle shaped erythrocytes (Figure 13.21). The gene for sickle cell Hb (HbS)
differs from that for HbA by a single point mutation in the B-globin gene at the
codon responsible for the amino acid residue at position 6. This substitutes a
thymine for an adenine base. Given that one B-globin gene is inherited from
each parent, the condition may be homozygous (HbSHbS) or heterozygous
(HbAHbS).

HEMOGLOBINOPATHIES

BOX 13.3 Sickle cell anemia: a molecular disease
The identiÔ¨Åcation of the precise mutation in sickle cell disease
was a signiÔ¨Åcant step in the understanding of molecular diseases.
The use of peptide mapping in two dimensions on large sheets
of chromatography paper enabled the differences between the
HbA and HbS to be identiÔ¨Åed. The change from a glutamate
to a valine residue means the B-globin molecule has lost one
negative charge and become more hydrophobic leading to sickle
cell anemia, as described in the main text:
Hemoglobin A

‚Ä¶Pro-Glu‚Ä¶

Hemoglobin S

‚Ä¶Pro-Val‚Ä¶

PEPTIDE MAPPING
The sequence of amino acids in a protein may be determined by
hydrolyzing the polypeptide into small fragments, for example
by digestion with trypsin, and then separating the fragments
and determining the sequence of each. It is relatively easy to
determine the amino acid sequence of short peptides. The
sequences of these then have to be aligned to give the sequence
for the complete polypeptide.

A)

The traditional way to separate many short peptides was twodimensional separation on a large sheet of Ô¨Ålter paper. The
separation was usually by electrophoresis in one dimension,
followed by chromatography in the second to produce a
peptide map, sometimes called a Ô¨Ångerprint. The colorless
peptides were located on the paper by staining them with
ninhydrin. When a point mutation has occurred, it is often
possible to observe that just one peptide has changed its
position provided that the mutation has produced a change
in charge, as is the case with HbS (Figure 13.22), or that the
substitute amino acid residue is substantially different in Mr to
the original. The stained ‚Äòspots‚Äô can then be cut out and the
peptide eluted from the paper and its sequence determined.
This method is no longer used. Typically HPLC is now used to
separate and purify the small peptides and the use of mass
spectrometry can give the sequence quickly.
The identiÔ¨Åcation of the precise defect in the mutant Hb in sickle
cell patients as an adenine to thymine mutation in codon 6 of the
B-globin gene was a major step in the understanding of genetic
diseases. The condition was the Ô¨Årst one to be referred to as a
molecular disease.

Hemoglobin A

Hemoglobin S

difference, highlighted in red, between (A)
normal and (B) sickle cell hemoglobins. See text
for details.

The mutation means that an acidic, hydrophilic glutamate residue is replaced
by a hydrophobic valine. The presence of the valine residue means that
the Hb molecule is a little more hydrophobic or ‚Äòsticky‚Äô in two places on its
surface because there are two B-chains present. The sticky patches are more
exposed in the deoxygenated state when the conformation of HbS changes as
the molecule releases its oxygen in the tissues. The HbS molecules therefore
aggregate forming stiff fibrils that cause the sickling of the erythrocytes
although, even after years of study, it is still not completely understood
how these changes occur. The deformed erythrocytes are less flexible than
normal ones and cannot squeeze through the capillaries in the tissues and
block them. This leads to hemostasis, anoxia and severe pain and, because
the sickling occurs as a result of changes occurring in deoxyhemoglobin,
the effects are exacerbated and more cells become sickle-shaped. The life of
a typical erythrocyte is reduced from 120 to about 10 12 days in sickle cell
patients: the abnormal cells are destroyed in the spleen and consequently
anemia ensues.

DISORDERS OF THE BLOOD

At low concentrations, HbS shows a normal oxygen binding curve, but at high
concentrations, as would occur in the erythrocytes of a homozygote for sickle
cell anemia, the oxygen affinity is decreased. Again, the reasons for this are
not fully understood, although the resulting shift in the oxygen dissociation
curve to the right means a greater proportion of the oxygen is released and
ameliorates the effects of the anemia. Indeed, the amino acid substitution that
causes the condition does not affect the structure of the oxygen binding site or
the ability of the molecule to bind and carry oxygen.
Patients who are homozygous for sickle cell anemia present with crises of
intense pain that can occur anywhere in the body caused by blockage of
capillaries. Crises tend to occur when the circulation is slow or when there
is hypoxia; about 15 s of low oxygen tension are required to produce sickling
so when the circulation is reasonably rapid there is insufficient time for this
to happen. Clinical complications of sickle cell disease are highly variable,
and the clinical consequences may include megaloblastic erythropoiesis,
aplastic crises, stroke, bone pain crises, proneness to infection, especially
by Pneumococcus, Salmonella and Haemophilus due to hyposplenism, and
acute chest syndrome. Acute chest syndrome is a common form of crisis in
children with sickle cell disease and is sometimes fatal. It occurs in about 40%
of all people with sickle cell disease. It is characterized by severe chest pain
and difficulty in breathing. It is probably caused either by a chest infection
or by blocked pulmonary capillaries resulting from a blood clot. In developed
countries the mortality in sickle cell disease is relatively low but this is not the
case in developing countries. In general, there seems to be an approximate 10%
mortality in the first few years of life but, again, this depends on the treatment
available, namely whether the infant has ‚ÄòWestern-style‚Äô medical care. The
probability of surviving to 29 years is about 84% but there are few data on
longevity. Infections seem to be the commonest cause of death at all ages.

Consequently, different sized fragments of DNA
are produced from normal compared with sickle
cell hemoglobin genes. Gel electrophoresis
separates the fragments, which may be detected
with a probe for the B-globin gene to reveal
the fragments of different sizes. This technique
can also be applied to the prenatal diagnosis of
sickle cell disease.

(+)

A diagnosis of sickle cell anemia may now be carried out on the DNA (Figure
13.23) of the embryo obtained by chorionic villus sampling or amniocentesis.
The parents may then make an informed decision whether or not to continue
with the pregnancy. Treatment includes analgesia for the pain during crises and
antibiotics and vaccination against the likely life-threatening infections. The
pain is often so acute as to require morphine. Sometimes inhalation of nitric
oxide can help by producing a vasodilation but this treatment is only dealing
with the symptoms. Blood transfusions are also possible but they can lead to
iron overload, as well as other complications, as the transfused erythrocytes
are removed from the circulation. Chelating agents such as desferrioxamine
may be used. In was observed that the severity of sickle cell disease in some
populations was reduced by the presence of high concentrations of HbF. Fetal
Hb is almost as good as HbA in transporting oxygen and, of course, does not
sickle. Hydroxyurea and butyrate are used as therapeutic agents to try to
induce higher levels of HbF in sickle cell patients. Hydroxyurea is thought to kill
selectively precursor cells in the bone marrow whilst sparing the erythroblasts
that produce HbF. However, this compound is an antineoplastic agent and
its long-term effects are unknown. Butyrate seems to activate transcription
of the G-globin gene so that HbF is produced in the adult. Both agents have
met with reasonable success in treating sickle cell patients and, in some cases,
may be used synergistically to increase HbF up to 20% with a marked clinical
improvement.
The mutation that causes HbS production is not the only one that leads
to sickling of erythrocytes but the many other variants are rather rare. The
second commonest of these in black Americans occurs in HbC, in which a
lysine residue replaces glutamate at position 6 in the B chain. Hemoglobin C is
rather insoluble and crystals of it can sometimes be seen in peripheral blood
smears. Heterozygotes for HbC are asymptomatic but homozygotes have a
mild hemolytic anemia.

HEMOGLOBINOPATHIES

BOX 13.4 Sickle cell trait and malaria
Heterozygotes, those with genes for HbA and HbS, have sickle cell
trait. Individuals typically have about 30% HbS and life expectancy
is about the same as for normal persons. The condition causes
relatively few problems except at high altitudes and when Ô¨Çying
in nonpressurized aircraft. Sickle cell disease, the homozygous
condition, is present in approximately 8% of American blacks
and may be as high as 45% in some African populations. It
is thought to cause 60 000 80 000 deaths in African children
annually. It may be asked why such a deleterious gene should
have persisted. The answer is probably that the possession of

a single HbS gene, that is sickle cell trait, increases resistance
to malaria caused by Plasmodium spp (Chapter 2). Malaria is
typically endemic in areas where the sickle cell trait reaches high
levels (Figure 13.24). The same may also be true of thalassemia
(see below). The reason for resistance seems to be that as
Plasmodium parasites grow in the erythrocytes, they lower the
intracellular pH and generate hydrogen peroxide. The lower pH
promotes sickling of the erythrocytes and the hydrogen peroxide
damages cell membranes, which become more permeable to K+.
The resulting intracellular decrease in K+ kills the parasites.

Thalassemia

Figure 13.24 Areas of the world where sickle cell disease and thalassemia are

As a result of the coincident distribution of the genes for HbS and HbC,
heterozygotes for both Hbs are not uncommon producing HbSC disease. This
is milder than true sickle cell disease but patients can show practically all
the same complications. Furthermore, it is symptomatic in the heterozygous
state. There can also be co-inheritance of the sickle cell and thalassemia
genes, which generates a wide spectrum of clinical symptoms whose severity
depends on the type of thalassemia mutation (see below).

THE THALASSEMIAS
Thalassemia, from ‚Äòthalassa‚Äô, which is Greek for ‚Äòthe sea‚Äô, are a group
of hemoglobinopathies originally discovered in people living near the

Mediterranean sea. However, the thalassemias are also relatively common in
southeastern Asia, the Philippines, China and worldwide and is perhaps the
most common group of hereditary diseases. Cooley first accurately described
them clinically in 1925 and the disease used to be called Cooley‚Äôs anemia, a
term now reserved for B-thalassemia.
In the late 1930s, thalassemia was shown to be an inherited disorder. However,
it was not until protein analytical techniques improved in the 1960s that the
disease was shown to be the result of an imbalance in the amounts of A- and
B-globins synthesized. The severe anemias associated with some thalassemias
stimulate the production of erythrocyte precursors. As a result, bone marrow
is able to expand to all areas of the skeleton leading to skeletal deformities.
If this occurs within the spine and compresses the spinal cord it can cause
intense pain. Some forms of the disease are fatal causing death in utero, while
others require copious blood transfusions for the anemia. A-Thalassemia, for
example, is caused by a complete or partial failure to produce A-globin. It is fatal
in its severe form when A-chains are not produced. In B-thalassemia, a partial
or complete failure to produce B-globin means that patients require lifelong
blood transfusions.
There are a number of forms of the disease because there is more than one
gene for the globin polypeptides and a mutation may not affect all of them.
Consequently there may not be complete absence of a given globin chain
and the disease will be less severe. Thalassemias are classified according to
which globin chains are reduced in amount, are mutated or are absent. The
more copies of the gene are missing or inactive, the greater the severity of
the disease. The anemia is caused by an ineffective erythropoiesis and from
precipitation of excess free globin within the erythrocytes. The cells have a
shortened life span and the spleen removes the abnormal erythrocytes leading
to splenomegaly.
A-Thalassemias can vary from a condition in which only one A-globin chain
is missing, producing a ‚Äòsilent‚Äô mutation that is practically a symptom-free,
carrier state, to other forms where two, three or all four genes are absent
or inactive (Table 13.6). The presence of a single functional A-globin gene
is usually sufficient to preclude serious morbidity. A decreased synthesis of
A-globin leads to the formation of two abnormal Hb tetramers. Hemoglobin
Barts is found in umbilical cord blood and arises because of a lack of A-chains
but normal production of the fetal G-chains; thus Hb Barts is G4. If the infant
survives, B-chain synthesis begins and B4 (HbH) tetramers form. Unfortunately,
neither G4 nor B4 can take up cooperatively O2 but bind it so tightly it cannot
be delivered to the tissues. Hemoglobin H precipitates in older erythrocytes

and under oxidant stress, such as when the patient is treated for malaria with
primaquine. A total absence of a A-globin gene results in the lethal in utero
condition, hydrops fetalis.
Some mutations that produce thalassemia are referred to as nondeletion
mutations. The mutation occurs in the STOP codon for the A-chain,
consequently translation continues beyond the normal end point to the next
STOP codon, extending the polypeptide by 31 residues. An example of this
produces Hb Constant Spring, the incidence of which is fairly common in
southeastern Asian populations where the usual STOP codon UAA is mutated
to CAA. It appears that the extended mRNA for the A-chain is unstable and
leads to a reduced rate of Hb synthesis. If this mutation is present together
with a lack of one of the A-globin genes, then HbH disease results. However, in
heterozygotes only about 1% of the A-globin produced is the Constant Spring
mutant type.
B-Thalassemias result from mutations in the B-globin genes. In some ways,
it would be more appropriate to call them ‚Äòthalassemias of the B-globin gene
family‚Äô because the genes for D-, and G-globins and the single B-globin are
all grouped together on chromosome 11. In B-thalassemia there is reduced
synthesis of B-globin with or without a reduced synthesis of D- or G-globins.
B-Thalassemia is not a single disease. The molecular defects in this and
related disorders are highly heterogeneous, with about 200 mutations having
been identified to date. These include many single nucleotide substitutions
that affect the expression of B-globin genes. Examples include nonsense and
frameshift mutations in the exons, point mutations in the intron‚Äìexon splice
junctions and mutations in the 5_ region and the 3_-polyadenylation sites. The
latter are extended sequences of adenine nucleotides at the 3_ end of mRNA
molecules that stabilize the mRNA molecules and help in their transport from
the nucleus to the cytoplasm. A number of heterozygous states are also known
but these usually only give rise to mild clinical symptoms. In some forms of
B-thalassemia, abnormal D-B fusion polypeptides may be formed. For example,
in Hb Lepore there is a fusion gene caused by nonhomologous crossing over
between the D-gene on one chromosome and the B-gene on the other. Thus
normal B- and D-genes are absent.
B-Globin chains are not required until after birth (Figure 13.9) and
B-thalassemia infants are usually born normally at term. Clinical problems
begin two to six months later, when G-globin synthesis, and therefore the
amount of HbF, has declined. Consequently B-thalassemia is a crippling
disease of childhood, characterized by the precipitation of excess A-globin
chains, destruction of erythrocytes in the bone marrow and circulation,
and deficiency of functional Hb tetramers. In B-thalassemia major, formerly
Cooley‚Äôs anemia, B-globin synthesis is strongly depressed or absent causing
massive erythroid proliferation and skeletal deformities.
Thalassemias can be diagnosed from their general clinical symptoms and the
anemia, including the precipitation of excess free globin chains. Hypochromic
erythrocytes with a clear center and a darker rim containing the Hb are
visible in blood smears as are poikilocytes, which are abnormally shaped cells
produced by the spleen when it removes target cells. There is also splenomegaly.
Electrophoresis of hemolyzed erythrocytes will provide information about the
relative proportions of A, A2 and F globins. In HbH disease, the Hb (tetramer
of B-globin) is detected as a rapidly moving band at pH 8.4.
The treatment for thalassemias, as with sickle cell disease, is to give repeated
blood transfusions combined with chelation therapy to remove the iron with,
for example, desferrioxamine. The latter is necessary because the body has
no real excretion route for iron, and an iron overload may be fatal due to
deposition cardiomyopathy by the second decade of life. Transfusions may
also put the patient at risk from hepatitis and AIDS, especially in developing

countries. Other treatments, such as giving hydroxyurea to augment HbF
synthesis, are also used (see above) and local irradiation may bring immediate
relief when expansion of bone marrow has happened.
In general, B-thalassemias are more severe, cause more patient suffering and
are more expensive to treat because more medical intervention is required,
than is the case with A-thalassemias.

13.7 GLUCOSE 6-PHOSPHATE DEHYDROGENASE DEFICIENCY
(G6PD)
Glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase is the first enzyme of the pentose
phosphate pathway (PPP), sometimes called the hexose monophosphate
shunt, of glucose metabolism. It catalyzes the reaction:
Glucose 6-phosphate + NADP+ m 6-phosphogluconate + NADPH + H+
The PPP offers an alternative route from glycolysis and the TCA cycle for
the complete oxidation of glucose. Erythrocytes can carry out glycolysis and
generate ATP but have no mitochondria and so cannot use the TCA cycle.
Their pentose phosphate pathway is also necessary to produce the NADPH,
a form of reducing power essential for a number of metabolic activities. The
gene for glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase is on the X chromosome and
G6PD is therefore a sex-linked condition affecting males (Chapter 15). It is,
however, carried by females who have half the normal level of the enzyme.
Female carriers, like sickle cell patients, are more resistant to the malarial
parasite, presumably because the host cells provide a less suitable habitat
for the malarial parasite and/or because the cells lyse before the parasite
can mature. However, the presence of G6PD in males, who only have one
X chromosome, or in homozygous females, has little antimalarial effect for
reasons that are not clear.

Genetic deficiency of glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) is common
in Africa, the Middle East, South East Asia and the Mediterranean region. It
is estimated that about 400 million people are affected making it the most
common inherited disease. Many hundreds of different mutations are known
but the commonest is the African or A type present in about 11% of blacks.
The degree of deficiency is mild with enzyme activity being about 10% of usual
levels and erythrocytes can manufacture sufficient NADPH under normal
circumstances.
Several hundred different mutant variants of the enzyme are known that are
unstable or have abnormal kinetics resulting in a reduced enzyme activity.
Erythrocytes are most severely affected in G6PD because they have a long life
in circulation and cannot carry out protein synthesis to replace the defective
enzyme. However, most patients can make enough NADPH under normal
conditions and the defect may only become apparent when the person takes a
drug, such as the antimalarial, primaquine (Table 13.7), that greatly increases
the demand for NADPH. Many different drugs besides antimalarials, that
require NADPH for their detoxification, can bring on a crisis. In individuals
with a severe form of the disease, oxidative stress may lead to severe hemolytic
anemia with a loss of 30‚Äì50% of the erythrocytes. Heinz bodies (Margin Note
13.8 and Figure 13.20) may be present. The urine may turn black because of
the high concentrations of Hb and its degradation products, and a high urine
flow must be maintained to prevent renal damage.
The requirement for NADPH relates to the need for glutathione (GSH) a sulfur
containing tripeptide that was met in Chapter 12, also 18. Glutathione contains
a thiol (‚ÄìSH) group that is readily oxidized (Figure 13.25). A major function of
glutathione in erythrocytes is to eliminate hydrogen peroxide, H2O2, which is

a toxic product of a number of reactions. Hydrogen peroxide can react with
unsaturated fatty acids in the erythrocyte membrane forming hydroperoxides,
damaging the membrane (Chapter 12) and leading to premature cell lysis.
The peroxides are eliminated by the action of glutathione peroxidase, which
requires glutathione as a reducing agent:

There is only a limited amount of glutathione in the cell and the reduced

catalyzed by glutathione reductase:
Glutathione reductase
GSSG + NADPH + H+

2GSH + NADP+

Consequently a steady supply of NADPH is required for erythrocyte integrity.
Glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase activity is highest in the immature
erythrocytes or reticulocytes and declines as the mature erythrocytes age. In
a hemolytic crisis, the older erythrocytes are destroyed first, leaving behind
reticulocytes and so giving a higher reticulocyte count. Consequently,
measuring the G6PDH activity in the erythrocytes following a crisis can
lead to spuriously high values. If the patient survives the crisis, with or
without transfusions, recovery will usually occur quite rapidly as the
reticulocyte count increases even if the individual continues to take the
antimalarial, because the reticulocytes can synthesize glucose 6-phosphate
dehydrogenase.

FAVISM
Favism is a hemolytic crisis brought on by the consumption of fava or broad
beans (Vicia fava) by some, but not all, individuals with G6PD. Infants
are especially susceptible. It is not understood why only some patients are
susceptible but it has been suggested that another mutation must also be
present for favism to be shown. Broad beans contain small quantities of toxic
glycosides, which, like the antimalarials, increase the demand for NADPH.

DISORDERS OF THE BLOOD

They are a popular item in the diet in the Mediterranean, an area where
G6PD is endemic. Favism is frequently fatal unless a large volume of blood is
transfused promptly.

13.8 CLINICAL ASPECTS OF CLOTTING
Clinical problems occur if the blood fails to clot as, for example, in hemophilia
(Box 13.5), or if it clots too easily or inappropriately, as in a coronary
thrombosis (Chapter 14). Thus analytical methods to clinically investigate
the clotting abilities of blood samples are necessary. These blood samples
require the addition of Ca2+ chelating agents, such as oxalate, citrate, EDTA
or heparin to prevent them clotting and centrifugation to remove blood cells.
The addition of excess Ca2+ or the removal of the chelating agents to the
remaining plasma allows it to clot. Thus, the clotting of blood from patients
can be studied in the pathology laboratory and any defects identified to
help with the diagnosis and monitoring of treatment. For example, the
prothrombin time, a measure of the activity of the extrinsic pathway, can be
estimated. Thromboplastin is added to blood from the patient into a tube
containing citrate to chelate the Ca2+ and the time taken for a fibrin clot to
form noted. The thrombin time is a measure of the activity of thrombin. It is
determined by adding thrombin to plasma and waiting for the clot to form. It
is also possible to measure the activity of the intrinsic pathway by estimating
the partial thromboplastin time. Calcium ions and phospholipids are added
to plasma which is then exposed to a surface to activate Factor XII and the
time taken for a clot to form is noted.

VITAMIN K AND ANTICOAGULANTS
Like most of the other blood clotting proteins, prothrombin is synthesized in
the liver in a process that requires vitamin K, one of the fat-soluble vitamins
(Chapter 10). A lack of vitamin K leads to the production of abnormal
prothrombin that is activated by Factor X at only about 1% of the normal
rate. Normal prothrombin contains 10 G-carboxyglutamate residues. Vitamin
K (Figure 13.26 (A)) is a cofactor required for the enzymic conversion of the
relevant glutamates in the protein to the G-carboxyglutamate residues (Figure
13.26 (B)). Dicoumarol and warfarin (Figure 13.27 (A) and (B)) are competitive

inhibitors of this process. Dicoumarol was first discovered in spoiled sweet
clover because it causes fatal hemorrhages in cattle, and warfarin was originally
developed as rat poison. Agents such as warfarin are used for anticoagulant
therapy. They are slow to produce effects but they have long plasma half-lives
and so can be active for days (Chapter 14).

HEMOPHILIA
The bleeding disease, hemophilia, is caused by a genetic lack of clotting
factors. In these disorders, the bleeding time is normal but the clotting (or
coagulation) time prolonged. The symptoms are a tendency for hemorrhages,
that is blood loss, either spontaneous or from even small injuries. Some
patients with hemophilia A may have a normal prothrombin time because
their concentration of tissue factor is high. The commonest of the hemophilias
is hemophilia A, in which Factor VIII is deficient. In north America, about 80%
of the cases are hemophilia A. This deficiency is sex-linked to males, with a
frequency of about one in 5000 to 10 000. The plasma levels of Factor VIII in
patients with severe hemophilia A are less than 5% of normal. Hemophilia
B, the second commonest form of hemophilia, is due to a lack of Factor IX.
Factor IX is also called Christmas Factor because it was first found to be
missing in a patient named Stephen Christmas.
In the past, hemophilias were treated by blood transfusion. However, repeated
transfusion brings the possibility of infection with HIV or hepatitis, as well
as the possibility of immune reactions and iron overload. Initial treatments
involved purifying the factor from human plasma obtained from pooled blood.
Modern treatment involves injections of Factor VIII prepared by recombinant
DNA technology. This eliminates any chance of infection but is expensive. The
same treatments are applicable to hemophilia B.

DISORDERS OF THE BLOOD

BOX 13.5 Hemophilia and Queen Victoria
Hemophilia, the inability of blood to clot properly, results from
deÔ¨Åciency in one of the clotting factor proteins of the clotting
cascade. If untreated it is accompanied by internal bleeding into
the joints and muscles as well as there being a risk of uncontrolled
bleeding in the case of injury or surgical operation. Treatment
involves injections of the puriÔ¨Åed clotting factor that is absent.
The commonest form of the disease, hemophilia A, is caused
by a recessive gene carried on the X chromosome leading to a
deÔ¨Åciency of Factor VIII. Factor VIII has a half-life of 12 h, so it
needs to be administered twice daily to maintain the required
therapeutic concentrations in the plasma, such as after an injury
or before an operation.
The incidence of type A hemophilia varies from one in 5000
to 10 000 of the male population. In males, the presence of
the defective allele on their sole X chromosome means that
they will show the disease, because the Y chromosome does
not carry an allele of the gene. Females can have the recessive
gene on one X chromosome and a normal gene on their other
X chromosome and in this case their blood will clot normally.
Such females are carriers. Given hemophilia affects only about
0.02%, or less, of males in the population, so the frequency
of X chromosomes carrying the allele for hemophilia is about
0.0002 among human males. Therefore among human females
the occurrence cannot exceed (0.0002)2; so female hemophiliacs
are very uncommon. Thus hemophilia affects mainly the males
and is normally transmitted by a female carrier who shows no
symptoms. The following genotypes are seen in:
females

XHXH (normal)

XHXh (carrier)

males

XHY (normal)

XhY (hemophiliac)

in the X chromosome. It is subjected to various genetic defects,
including deletions, point mutations and insertions. Spontaneous
mutations in the Factor VIII gene are fairly common.
Hemophilia is associated with members of the royal families of
Europe. Queen Victoria (Figure 13.28) appears to have received
a mutant allele from one of her parents and, as shown in Figure
13.29, this was passed on. Prince Albert could not have been
responsible because male-to-male inheritance is impossible. One
of Victoria‚Äôs sons, Leopold, Duke of Albany, died of hemophilia
at the age of 31 and at least two of Victoria‚Äôs daughters were
carriers. Through various intermarriages the disease spread from
throne to throne across Europe, including the son of the last
Tsar of Russia.

XhXh (hemophiliac)

The human gene for Factor VIII was cloned in 1984. It is an
enormous gene of 186 kilobases forming about 0.1% of the DNA

Figure 13.28 Queen Victoria.

13.9 THROMBOCYTOPENIA AND THROMBOCYTOSIS
In thrombocytopenia there is reduced platelet production. The clotting
time may be only slightly prolonged but the clot formed is soft and does not
retract. The condition can result from many diseases where bone marrow
does not produce enough platelets, or where they become entrapped in an
enlarged spleen and destroyed, or is caused by some drugs. The symptoms
of thrombocytopenia include bleeding in the skin, pinpoint bruises, bleeding
gums and it can be life threatening. Suspected thrombocytopenia can be
investigated by platelet counts, assessing the size of the spleen and by bone
marrow biopsy. Treatments would be cessation of drugs, if that is the cause,
and by transfusions of platelets.
In thrombocytosis, in contrast, there is a high platelet count and an increased
chance of thrombosis. The condition can be primary, myeloproliferative
disease, or secondary, for example following splenectomy or some other
operations, bleeding following extreme exercise or by inflammatory diseases.
Clinically patients present with bleeding disorders. The usual treatments are
to give antiplatelet agents, such as aspirin or dipyridamole.

SUMMARY

13.10 SUMMARY
The blood system has many components, erythrocytes, leukocytes and
platelets suspended in the complex protein rich plasma. Hemoglobin
transports oxygen from the lungs to the tissues. Anemia results when the
Hb level decreases and this is usually accompanied with a reduction in the
erythrocyte count. Anemias may be associated with normal sized erythrocytes
or ones that are microcytic or macrocytic, depending upon the cause.
Many hundreds of mutations are known that affect Hb giving rise to
hemoglobinopathies. These range from relatively mild conditions to ones
that are severe and life-threatening. In sickle cell anemia, the molecules of
deoxyhemoglobin aggregate to form fibrils, which distort the erythrocytes,
making them less flexible when passing through the capillaries. This leads
to a lack of oxygen in the tissues, severe pain and hemolysis. It is due to a
point mutation in the gene for B-globin. Thalassemias are a group of relatively
common hemoglobinopathies, caused by the defective synthesis of the A- or
B-globins. Thalassemias, again, vary from the relatively mild to very severe,
depending upon the precise defect.
The commonest blood disease is glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase
deficiency. Typically this is asymptomatic until the patient takes a particular
drug that produces an excessive demand for glutathione in the erythrocytes
and this leads to a severe hemolytic anemia.
Many defects of the blood clotting system are known. The commonest is
hemophilia A, which is caused by lack of Factor VIII, one of the protein factors
active in the clotting mechanism.

14.1 INTRODUCTION
The cardiovascular system comprises the heart, with its covering pericardium,
and blood vessels, that is, arteries, arterioles, capillaries, venules and veins,
which enclose and distribute blood to the tissues.
The heart is a muscular pump weighing about 500 g in an adult and is the
strongest muscle in the body. It can contract for over a hundred years nonstop,
beating about 100 000 times a day at a rate of about 70 beats min‚Äì1, to pump
blood (Chapter 13)) around the body. This supplies, for example, oxygen and
nutrients to the tissues and removes their waste products. However, in such a
complicated system many things can go wrong. In the developed countries,
heart disease is responsible for about half of the annual deaths. Much of
this is due to lifestyle, for example smoking, poor diets and excess weight. In
developing countries rheumatic heart disease is more of a problem but this
has decreased in the developed countries.

DISORDERS OF THE CARDIOVASCULAR SYSTEM

14.2 THE HEART AND CIRCULATORY SYSTEMS
The heart (Figure 14.1 (A) and (B)) is a hollow, four-chambered, muscular
organ situated approximately in the center of the chest. A smooth layer called
the endocardium lines the inside of the chambers. The wall of the heart or
myocardium is rich in cardiac muscle tissue arranged into three layers. The
inner layer is circular and thicker in the wall of the left ventricle than in the
right. The outer layers of muscle spiral around the ventricles and extend to the
fibrous attachments of the four valve rings. On contraction they tend to pull
the chamber of the ventricle towards the valve rings. The exterior of the heart
is a tough, fibrous layer that is partly covered by fat. The heart is enclosed by a
double membrane system called the pericardium.
Internally, the heart is centrally divided by a septum that prevents oxygenated
and deoxygenated blood from mixing. Each side is subdivided into an upper
chamber or atrium, which collects blood and passes it to a lower chamber or
ventricle that ejects blood. Each of the heart‚Äôs ventricles has a one-way inlet
valve and a one-way outlet valve (Figure 14.1 (B)). The tricuspid valve opens
from the right atrium to the right ventricle and the pulmonary valve opens
from this ventricle into the pulmonary arteries. The mitral valve separates the
left atrium and ventricle and the aortic valve opens from the ventricle into the
aorta. All these valves ensure that blood flows only in one direction.

THE HEART AND CIRCULATORY SYSTEMS

The flow of blood through the pulmonary and systemic circulations is
illustrated in Figure 14.2. Oxygen-depleted blood from the body flows
through the two largest veins, the venae cavae, into the right atrium. When
this chamber is full it propels the blood into the right ventricle and when
this is full it pumps blood through the pulmonary valve into the pulmonary
artery, which takes it to the lungs. As the blood flows through the network
of capillaries that surround the lung alveoli it absorbs oxygen and gives up
its carbon dioxide (Chapter 9). The resulting oxygen-enriched blood flows
through the pulmonary veins into the left atrium of the heart. The complete
circuit between the right side of the heart, the lungs and the left atrium is
called the pulmonary circulation. When the left atrium is full, it sends the
oxygen-rich blood into the left ventricle, which, in turn, propels the blood
into the aorta, which is the largest artery in the body. From there it flows to
all the tissues of the body, with the exception of the lungs, in the systemic
circulation. The major arteries to the head, neck and arms branch off from
the aorta (Section 14.3) and there are also smaller vessels, the coronary
arteries that supply the heart itself with blood. The aorta arches over the

Listening to the heart with a
stethoscope (‚Äòausculation‚Äô) reveals
the distinctive sounds caused by the
opening and closing of the heart‚Äôs
valves and the Ô¨Çow of blood. If there
are abnormalities of the valves and
heart structures then these may cause
turbulent Ô¨Çow of the blood that
creates characteristic sounds called
murmurs. Typically the murmur is
caused by blood Ô¨Çowing through
narrowed or leaking valves. However,
not all heart diseases cause murmurs
and not all murmurs indicate heart
disease. For example, pregnant
women usually have heart murmurs
because of the increase in blood
Ô¨Çow. In infants and young children,
harmless murmurs are commonly
caused by the rapid Ô¨Çow of blood
through the smaller sized heart
structures.

heart and then goes downwards carrying blood to the abdomen and legs.
In the capillaries of the tissues, oxygen is exchanged for carbon dioxide and
nutrients and hormones, for example, supplied to the tissues. The blood then
returns to the heart through the veins (Figure 14.2).
To work efficiently, the four chambers of the heart must beat in a coordinated
way, with the atria and then the ventricles contracting simultaneously (Figure
14.3). A given chamber of the heart contracts when an electrical impulse moves
across it. Each signal originates in a small bundle of specialized cells in the
right atrium called the sinoatrial or SA node (Figure 14.4). This is the natural
pacemaker that ensures the heart beats regularly by generating impulses
at a given rate. Although it produces a natural rate, this can be modified by
emotional and physical reactions and by hormones, especially adrenaline
and noradrenaline (Chapter 7), which speed up the heart rate, enabling it
to respond to varying demands. The electrical impulses generated by the SA
node travel throughout the right and left atria causing the heart muscle to
contract (Figure 14.4) and arrive at the atrioventricular or AV node situated
between the atria and the ventricles. This node delays the transmission of the
impulse to allow the atria to contract completely and the ventricles to fill with
as much blood as possible. The phase of relaxation of the ventricles is called
diastole. After passing through the AV node, the impulse travels through
the bundle of His. This is a group of modified cardiac muscle fibers, called
Purkinje fibers, that divides into two branches that serves the left and right
ventricles respectively (Figure 14.4). The fibers spread over the surface of the
ventricles in an orderly arrangement and thus initiate systole or ventricular

contraction. Both ventricles contract together in a wringing fashion so that
blood is squeezed out from their bases, pumping blood from the heart.
These coordinated actions keep the four chambers of the heart working in
the appropriate sequence. When things go wrong people may have to have
artificial pacemakers fitted.
The part of the nervous system that regulates the heart rate automatically
is, not surprisingly, the autonomic nervous system and consists of the
sympathetic and the parasympathetic fibers of the vagus nerve (Figure 14.4).
The sympathetic system increases the heart rate and the parasympathetic
system slows it down.
The pericardium is a thin, flexible, two-layered bag that surrounds the heart.
It contains just sufficient lubricating fluid between the two layers so that they
slide easily over each other as the heart beats. It keeps the heart in position
and prevents it overfilling with blood.

14.3 BLOOD VESSELS
The blood vessels comprise arteries, arterioles, capillaries, venules and veins
(Figures 14.5 and 14.6). Arteries are strong and flexible and carry blood away
from the heart. They are subjected to the highest pressure (Section 14.4), and
their resilience helps to maintain blood pressure while the heart is in between

beats. The smaller arteries and arterioles have muscular walls and their
diameters can be adjusted to regulate blood flow to a particular region of the
body. Capillaries are thin-walled vessels that allow oxygen, nutrients and other
materials, for example hormones, to diffuse from the blood to the tissues and
waste products to pass from the tissues into the blood. The capillaries are links
between the arteries and arterioles and the venules and veins. Veins are, in
general, larger in diameter than arteries but have much thinner walls. They
transport blood back to the heart but at much lower pressures and speeds
than is found in arteries.

ARTERIES
Arteries are elastic tubes with circular cross-sections (Figures 14.7 (A) and
(B)). They are built up from three layers called tunics. The tunica intima is

the layer of endothelial cells that provides a smooth, low friction innermost
surface. This layer is in direct contact with the blood, and damage to it leads
to serious clinical problems. The tunica media is a relatively thick middle
layer composed of smooth muscle and elastic fibers, which are arranged both
lengthways and circumferentially. The amount of elastic material varies with
the vessel. Closer to the heart, the aorta and large branches contain larger
amounts because they have to accommodate the stroke volume. In contrast,
the pulmonary artery has rather thin walls. The smooth muscle is under
autonomic nervous control that regulates the diameter of the vessel. The
fibrous components limit the amount of stretch under a surge of pressure.
The tunica adventitia is the outer covering fibrous layer composed of tough
collagenous material.
Arteries branch repeatedly in order to supply all parts of the body. The diameter
of the aorta is about 25 mm, and that of a medium-sized artery about 4 mm.

DISORDERS OF THE CARDIOVASCULAR SYSTEM

When their diameter is less than 0.1 mm, they are called arterioles. Junctions
between the branches are called anastomoses and these may occur between
arteries and arterioles.
The pulmonary arteries distribute the output of the right ventricle to the lungs.
They are shorter, have thinner walls and contain blood at a lower pressure than
systemic arteries. Arteries also have a storage function since the output of the
ventricles is discontinuous as the heart beats. For example, the aorta stores up
blood during systole and its elastic recoil propels it on during diastole. This
means that the discontinuous blood flow from the heart is converted to a more
continuous flow through the peripheral circulation, conserving energy and
reducing the pressure that the smaller arteries have to withstand.

VEINS
The veins form a blood collecting system that returns blood from the periphery
to the heart. In general, veins have the same pattern of distribution as the
arteries and frequently run alongside them (Figure 14.6). The blood collected
from the systemic circuit is eventually delivered to the right atrium of the
heart. However, the venous drainage from the stomach, spleen and intestine
is carried by the hepatic portal vein to the liver (Chapter 11). Blood from the
liver is then returned to the heart in the hepatic vein.
Veins, like arteries, have walls composed of three layers but they contain
considerably less muscle and elastic tissues and their walls are much thinner
(Figure 14.7 (A) and (C)). The internal lining is the same endothelium as in
the arteries. Veins are much more easily distended than arteries and are also
more easily collapsed because they are less able to withstand high pressures.
At intervals, especially along the lengths of long veins, the endothelial lining
forms cup-shaped valves, rather similar to the semilunar valves in the heart.
These allow blood to flow in only one direction, which is back towards
the heart, and also prevent its back flow under gravity. In addition, during
muscular activity especially in the legs, the compression and relaxation of the
muscular tissue surrounding the veins forms a ‚Äòmuscle pump‚Äô that expedites
the transport of blood back to the heart. In general, the blood flow through
veins is less discontinuous than it is in arteries.

CAPILLARIES
The arterioles supply beds of capillaries found deep in the tissues and these
eventually deliver their blood to the venules, and hence to the veins for
return to the heart. Capillaries have internal diameters about the same as
that of erythrocytes, about 7 Lm.Their walls are composed of a single layer of
endothelial cells on a basement membrane (Figure 14.8) and so they lack muscle
and elastic tissues. The capillary network is the site where gases are exchanged,
nutrients and other biomolecules are delivered and waste products removed.
The flow of blood through capillaries is relatively slow compared with that in
arteries and veins and this allows adequate exchanges to take place.

14.4 BLOOD PRESSURE
The blood pressure is the hydrostatic force that the blood exerts against the
wall of a blood vessel and that propels blood around the body. It is determined
partly by cardiac output and partly by the peripheral resistance. As already
stated, it is greater in arteries than in veins and is highest in the arteries when
the heart contracts (systole). This is called the systolic pressure. When the
heart contracts blood enters the arteries faster than it can leave through the
capillaries so the vessels stretch under the pressure. This bulging of the arteries
is the pulse that can be felt at a number of sites in the body. During diastole,

the artery walls snap back, but the heart contracts again before enough blood
has flowed into the capillary bed to relieve the pressure. This is the peripheral
resistance. As a result, there is still a substantial blood pressure even during
diastole, the diastolic pressure, and so blood flows into the arterioles more or
less continuously.
Typically, at rest the systolic pressure is about 120 mmHg and the diastolic
pressure approximately 70 mmHg. Blood pressure can be measured using
a manual sphygmomanometer combined with a stethoscope (Figure 14.9
(A) and Box 14.1) or with an automatic electronic one (Figure 14.9 (B)).
Blood pressure is not constant because as demands on the circulatory
system change, regulatory mechanisms ensure that adequate blood flow
is maintained. Thus, during heavy exercise the arterioles in the working
muscles dilate to allow increased delivery of oxygen to the muscles. This of
course decreases the peripheral resistance, which, by itself, would cause a fall
in blood pressure. However, the cardiac output is increased to counteract this
effect.

DISORDERS OF THE CARDIOVASCULAR SYSTEM

BOX 14.1 Measuring blood pressure
Traditionally, blood pressure is measured using a manual
sphygmomanometer and stethoscope (Greek, sphygmos,
pulse), as illustrated in Figure 14.10 (A)‚Äì(D). There are also
electronic instruments that can be used (Figure 14.9 (B)). With a
sphygmomanometer, an inÔ¨Çatable cuff connected to a pressure
gauge, in this case a mercury manometer, is placed around the
upper arm over the brachial artery and inÔ¨Çated (Figure 14.10 (B)).
A stethoscope is placed on the skin above the brachial artery so
that blood sounds may be heard. When the pressure in the cuff is

greater than the systolic pressure the arteries are compressed and
no brachial pulse can be heard. The cuff pressure is then slowly
reduced and when it falls to that of the systolic pressure, clear
sounds (Korotkoff sounds) can be heard due to the turbulence
generated as the blood Ô¨Çows through the partially occluded artery
(Figure 14.10 (B)‚Äì(C)). As the pressure further reduces the sounds
become suddenly mufÔ¨Çed and then disappear completely. The
pressure at this point is generally taken as the diastolic pressure
(Figure 14.10 (D)).

INVESTIGATING CARDIAC FUNCTION IN HEALTH AND DISEASE

14.5 INVESTIGATING CARDIAC FUNCTION IN HEALTH AND
DISEASE
Clinicians need to be able to diagnose cardiovascular problems and to monitor
their treatment. Obviously, noninvasive methods are to be preferred as far as
possible for the comfort of the patient.

THE ELECTROCARDIOGRAM (ECG)
The spread of depolarization and repolarization through the muscle mass
of the heart is accompanied by measurable electrical potentials, which may
be recorded through electrodes placed on the skin. The record of these
potentials is called an electrocardiogram (ECG) and represents the aggregate
or resultant electrical activity associated with the action potentials of millions
of individual cells, each of which has an amplitude and direction. Recording
a patient‚Äôs ECG is a way of investigating the electrical activity of the heart and
when the pattern is abnormal it is invaluable in diagnosing a variety of heart
complaints. The test is quick, simple and painless, and provides information
on the heart rhythm and underlying cardiac morphology.
An ECG is recorded by placing electrodes, these days usually disposable,
self-adhesive ones, on the chest and limbs. In practice the ECG is recorded
simultaneously from six electrodes connected to the limbs and six to the chest
that measure the direction and flow of electric currents during each heartbeat.
The results are recorded (Figure 14.11 (A)), with each trace representing a
particular ‚Äòview‚Äô of the heart‚Äôs electrical activity; these views are referred to
as leads. The spikes and troughs on the graph correspond to specific events
in the cycle of a heartbeat and these are lettered alphabetically (Figure 14.11
(B)). Modern ECG instruments have a built-in computer that analyzes the
recordings and produces a printout of the analysis.
In the normal ECG waveform, the first deflection is caused by atrial
depolarization and is a low-amplitude slow deflection called a P wave. The
following QRS complex results from ventricular depolarization, and as can be
seen in Figure 14.11 (B), it is sharper and larger in amplitude than the P wave.
The T wave is another slow, low-amplitude wave resulting from ventricular
repolarization. Atrial repolarization is not usually seen because it is low voltage
and is hidden by the QRS complex. The PR interval is the time from the start
of the P wave to the start of the QRS complex and represents the time taken
for activation to pass from the SA node, through the atrium to the AV node.
The QRS complex is a measure of the time associated with impulses passing
through the His-Purkinje system and the subsequent contractions of the
ventricles. The QT interval begins at the start of the QRS complex and finishes
at the end of the T wave and this represents the time taken to depolarize and
repolarize the ventricular myocardium. The ST segment is the time between
the end of the QRS complex and the start of the T wave. At this point all the
cells of the normal heart are depolarized.
The print out from an ECG examination can help the cardiologist to identify
a number of heart problems including abnormal rhythms, inadequate blood
supply to the heart and excessive thickening of the heart muscle (hypertrophy).
For example, a heightened P wave indicates an enlarged atrium; a deeper
than normal Q wave may indicate a myocardial infarction (Section 14.14)
and a heightened R wave usually indicates a thickening of the ventricular
wall. If the ST segment is raised above the horizontal it may indicate acute
myocardial infarction or, if it is below the horizontal, it can imply high blood
K+ concentrations (Chapter 8) or cardiac ischemia (Section 14.9). Any deviation
from the normal rate or sequence of the ECG is referred to as a cardiac
arrhythmia. If the sinoatrial (SA) node is damaged the heart rate may slow to
40‚Äì50 beats per min and if damage occurs to both the SA and AV nodes it may
fall to 20‚Äì40 beats per min and the patient will require a pacemaker.

INVESTIGATING CARDIAC FUNCTION IN HEALTH AND DISEASE

In addition to the basic technique, the cardiac response may be recorded
during exercise as the patient walks or runs on a treadmill and this can give
further clinical information. In other situations, the ECG may be recorded
over 24 h using a portable ECG machine to monitor intermittent arrhythmias
(Section 14.7).

ECHOCARDIOGRAPHY
Echocardiography uses high-frequency ultrasound to map the heart and
study its various functions. It is one of the most widely used diagnostic
techniques, is painless and does not use X-rays and can indicate the extent of
cardiac damage. Ultrasound waves from a probe at wavelengths of 1 mm or
less (corresponding to frequencies of around 2 MHz) are generated in short
bursts of a few microseconds. When the probe is pressed against the body
the emitted pulses encounter the interfaces between the various body tissues.
In crossing each interface some sound energy is reflected and is detected by
a transducer in the probe and recorded as an echo. The time delays for the
echoes to return are analyzed by a computer to produce a video picture on
a screen with a moving image of the heart and blood vessels (Figure 14.12).
This allows the cardiologist to see if the heart valves are functioning properly,
for example whether they leak when closed and if blood is flowing normally.
Abnormal connections between blood vessels of heart chambers are also
revealed, as well as contractibility of muscle walls.

Figure 14.12 Echocardiography uses ultrasound
waves that are reÔ¨Çected from the interfaces
between the various tissues and analyzed to
produce the type of image shown.

CARDIAC CATHETERIZATION (ANGIOGRAPHY)
Cardiac catheterization is a further method for investigating heart function
and abnormalities. However, it is an invasive technique and involves a certain
amount of discomfort for the patient. Under local anesthetic, a thin plastic
tube is inserted into a vein or artery in an arm or leg (groin) and advanced into
the major vessels and heart chambers. The catheter can be used to measure
pressure, take a view of the inside of the heart or to take blood samples to
measure oxygen and lactate concentrations. Dyes which are X-ray opaque can
be injected into the catheter allowing moving X-ray pictures to be made that
can show up anatomical abnormalities or abnormal blood flow. The coronary
arteries can also be investigated by catheterization to check for coronary
artery disease.

ANGIOGRAPHY AND RADIOGRAPHIC VISUALIZATION
A chest X-ray taken from the back also enables the size of the heart in relation
to the lungs and the major blood vessels to be assessed. It may also reveal
areas of calcium deposition, which are a sign of tissue damage and death.

EXERCISE STRESS TEST
The exercise stress test measures oxygen uptake, CO2 production, heart rate
and lung ventilation during progressively more strenuous treadmill or cycle
ergometer exercises. It can detect lung and heart diseases in their early stage
and also be used to assess fitness. Patients with lung disease stop exercising
before achieving their maximal predicted heart rate. Also, their levels of
ventilation are disproportionately high for a given oxygen uptake. Thus the
more expensive and complicated equipment can differentiate breathlessness
due to lung or to heart disease. For patients who cannot physically exercise,
stress test measurements can be obtained using the dobutamine stress test.
Dobutamine is an inotropic drug that increases the heart rate, hence giving
increasing doses makes the heart work harder.

DISORDERS OF THE CARDIOVASCULAR SYSTEM

14.6 ENDOCARDITIS
Endocarditis is an inflammation of the endocardium, the interior lining of the
heart and its valves. It most often results from bacterial infection that may
originate from bacteria in the blood or as a result of heart surgery. The bacteria
in the blood may enter from a skin wound or even from small injuries occurring
when chewing food or brushing the teeth. Injecting drug users and patients
with prolonged catheter use are also at risk. Abnormal or damaged valves are
more susceptible than normal ones, and people with artificial valves are at
risk. Bacteria and blood clots can accumulate on the valves (called vegetation)
and can then break loose and block vessels elsewhere in the body causing
strokes, heart attacks (Section 14.14) pulmonary embolisms or infecting the
area where they lodge.
Acute infective endocarditis has a rapid onset and can be life threatening,
unlike subacute infective endocarditis which develops slowly over weeks
and months. In the acute form, the symptoms are usually the sudden onset
of a high fever, a fast heart rate and tiredness. There can be extensive valve
damage as well as the blood clot damage elsewhere in the body. Individuals
may go into shock and be subject to renal failure. Prompt diagnosis and
hospitalization are vital. The subacute form is associated with mild fever,
tiredness, weight loss, sweating and a low erythrocyte count. However,
because the symptoms of the subacute form are more vague, damage may
occur before the condition is recognized; it is just as life threatening as the
acute form.
Patients with heart valve abnormalities or artificial valves are more susceptible
to endocarditis, as mentioned above. If they are about to undergo medical or
dental procedures, they must inform their surgeon or dentist and be given
antibiotics prior to invasive treatments. If endocarditis occurs and is identified,
the treatment usually consists of at least two weeks of high-dose, intravenous
antibiotics. However, heart surgery may also be necessary to repair or replace
damaged valves.

14.7 ABNORMAL HEART RHYTHMS
The normal heart rate is between 60 and 100 beats per min but much lower
rates may be encountered and are quite normal in young adults who are
physically fit. As has been mentioned, the rate also responds to exercise or
inactivity and also to pain and anger. An inappropriately fast heartbeat is called
tachycardia and an abnormally low rate bradycardia. Abnormal rhythms are
frequently encountered and can be regular or irregular. The contractions of
the heart muscle fibers and therefore heartbeat is controlled by electrical
discharges that flow through the heart along distinct pathways at controlled
speeds (Section 14.2 and Figure 14.4). If disturbances occur with the flow of
the electrical discharge then arrhythmias in these contractions can occur.
These range from the harmless to the life threatening. For example, minor
arrhythmias can be caused by excessive alcohol consumption, smoking, stress
or exercise. Thyroid hormones also affect the heart rate and an over- or underactive thyroid gland (Chapter 7) may affect the rate and rhythm of the heart.
Some of the drugs used to treat lung disease or high blood pressure can have
similar effects.
The commonest causes of arrhythmia are heart disease, especially coronary
heart disease, heart failure or abnormal valve function. In many cases patients
are aware of an abnormal heartbeat and this is referred to as palpitations.
This awareness may be disturbing but there are many possible causes of
arrhythmias and they are often not the result of an underlying disease.

ABNORMAL HEART RHYTHMS

However, when they are, it is the nature and severity of the disease that is
more important than the arrhythmia itself. If brought to the attention of
a clinician, he or she will want to know if they are fast or slow, regular or
irregular, whether they make the person feel dizzy, light-headed or even lose
consciousness, whether they occur at rest or during exercise and are they
accompanied by a shortness of breath or chest pain.
An ECG is, of course, helpful in diagnosis but the arrhythmias may only
occur over a short period. Consequently a portable monitor may be placed
on the patient to record them over 24 h. The prognosis and treatment will
depend on whether the arrhythmias start in the pacemaker, the atria or
the ventricles. Most arrhythmias are harmless and do not interfere with
the heart‚Äôs pumping action. However, antiarrhythmic drugs are available
if the patient is anxious or if the arrhythmias cause intolerable symptoms
or pose a risk. Sometimes it is necessary to fit the patient with an artificial
pacemaker that is programmed to replace the heart‚Äôs own pacemaker. These
are usually implanted surgically under the skin of the chest and are wired to
the heart. Most commonly they are used to correct abnormally slow heart
rates. Sometimes an externally applied electric shock to the heart, called
cardioversion, electroversion, or defibrillation, can correct an abnormal
arrhythmia. Arrhythmias caused by coronary artery disease may be
controlled by drugs, pacemakers or by surgery (see below). After a coronary
infarction, some people have life-threatening episodes of ventricular
tachycardia that may be triggered in an injured area of heart muscle that
may have to be removed during open heart surgery.

ATRIAL FIBRILLATION AND FLUTTER
Atrial fibrillation and flutter are rapid electrical discharges which make the
atria contract rapidly but each contraction may not conduct to the ventricles.
This causes the ventricles to contract less efficiently and irregularly, producing
a condition that may be sporadic or persistent. During the fibrillation or
flutter, the atrial walls simply quiver and blood is not pumped into the
ventricles properly. The consequence is that inadequate amounts of blood are
pumped from the heart, blood pressure falls and heart failure may occur. The
diminished pumping ability may make the patient feel weak, faint and short
of breath. Sometimes, especially with elderly patients, there is chest pain and
heart failure. If the atria do not contract completely, blood may stagnate in the
atria and clot. If pieces of clot or emboli break off they may move and block an
artery elsewhere in the body. If this is in the brain it may cause an embolism
or stroke (Section 14.16).
The treatment for atrial fibrillation is to correct the disorder that causes the
abnormal rhythm, restoring it to normal, and to slow the rate at which the
ventricles contract so as to improve the pumping efficiency. The latter can
often be achieved with digoxin but a A-blocker, such as propanolol, or other
drugs may also be required. Frequently a normal rhythm has to be restored
by antiarrhythmic drugs or cardioversion. In these conditions blood can pool
in the ventricles and clot, hence anticoagulant drugs may be used when atrial
fibrillation is present.

VENTRICULAR TACHYCARDIA
Sustained ventricular tachycardia, with a ventricular rate of at least 120 beats
per min, occurs in various heart diseases that damage the ventricles. Most
often it occurs over weeks or months after a heart attack (Margin Note 14.2). It
is characterized by palpitations and will usually require emergency treatment
because the blood pressure falls and heart failure may follow. Cardioversion is
needed immediately.

Margin Note 14.2 Heart attack or
myocardial infarction

i

A heart attack is a myocardial
infarction. It is a severe medical
emergency during which some
or all of the blood supply to the
heart muscle through the coronary
arteries is cut off. If this continues
for more than a few minutes the
heart tissue dies with serious clinical
consequences or death of the
individual. The term heart attack is
sometimes used loosely for other
heart conditions: strictly it should
only be applied to myocardial
infarctions.

DISORDERS OF THE CARDIOVASCULAR SYSTEM

VENTRICULAR FIBRILLATION
Ventricular fibrillation is a form of cardiac arrest. It is similar to atrial
fibrillation, but the prognosis is very serious and potentially fatal if not
treated immediately. It is the product of an uncoordinated series of rapid but
ineffective contractions throughout the ventricles. These, in turn, arise from
multiple chaotic electrical impulses. Its commonest cause is an insufficient
flow of blood to the heart muscle because of coronary heart disease or
a heart attack. Given that blood is not pumped from the heart, it can lead
to unconsciousness in seconds and, if untreated, the patient usually has
convulsions and develops irreversible brain damage because of oxygen
starvation. Ventricular fibrillation needs to be treated as a medical emergency.
Cardiopulmonary resuscitation must be started within the minimum time
possible, usually three minutes. This should be followed by cardioversion also
as soon as possible. Subsequently drugs are needed to restore and maintain
the normal heart rhythm.

HEART BLOCK
Heart block describes a delay in electrical conduction through the AV node.
There are various degrees of seriousness; the least may not require treatment
but the most serious may require the fitting of an artificial pacemaker. Firstdegree heart block is common in well-trained athletes, teenagers, and young
adults, but it may also be caused by rheumatic fever (Box 14.2) or by certain
drugs. At the other extreme in third-degree heart block, electrical impulses
from the atria to the ventricles are completely blocked. The ventricles beat
very slowly and the pumping ability of the heart is compromized. Fainting,
dizziness and sudden heart failure are common.

BOX 14.2 Rheumatic fever
Rheumatic fever occurs mostly in children and young adults and
is caused by infection with group A Streptococci. It is now much
less common in the developed countries than was previously the
case: for example 10% of children in the 1920s compared with
about 0.01% now. This is mainly due to the use of antibiotics
(Chapter 3). Rheumatic fever is thought to result from an
autoimmune reaction triggered by the bacteria rather than any
bacterial toxin. The skin, joints and the central nervous system
and all the layers of the heart may be affected. The disease
presents with fever, joint pains, malaise, loss of appetite and
a characteristic Ô¨Çeeting polyarthritis affecting the larger joints,
such as knee, elbows, ankles, which become swollen, red and
tender. Effects on the heart include new or changed murmurs,
cardiac enlargement or failure and pericardial effusion.

INVESTIGATION

protein (Chapter 13), both of which may be elevated. Throat
swabs should be cultured for group A Streptococcus and there
may be serological changes indicative of a recent streptococcal
infection.

TREATMENT
If patients have fever, active arthritis or active carditis, they should
be completely bed rested. Residual streptococcal infection should
be eradicated with a single intramuscular injection of benzathine
penicillin or four daily oral doses of phenoxymethyl penicillin for
a week. Salicylate and steroids may also be given if carditis is
present. Recurrence is common. More than half of those with
acute rheumatic fever with carditis, a general inÔ¨Çammation of
the heart, will develop conditions after 10‚Äì20 years that affect
the mitral and aortic valves.

There will usually be nonspeciÔ¨Åc indicators of inÔ¨Çammation,
such as the erythrocyte sedimentation rate and C-reactive

CARDIAC FAILURE

14.8 CARDIAC FAILURE
Cardiac failure is the inability of the heart to maintain an adequate cardiac
output, that is pump a volume of blood per minute sufficient to meet the
demands of the body. The heart does not stop beating as is often thought,
but its diminished ability imposes severe demands. It is a serious condition
but commoner in older people. The incidence is about one in a hundred for
individuals over 65 years, and irrespective of the cause, the prognosis is poor.
Approximately 50% of patients will die within two years, although new drug
treatments are improving mortality and morbidity.
There are many possible causes of heart failure and, indeed, any disease
that affects the heart and circulatory system can lead to heart failure. The
commonest of these is coronary artery disease that limits the flow of blood,
and hence oxygen and nutrients to the heart muscle and can lead to heart
attack. Bacterial and viral infections (Chapter 2) can also damage the heart
muscle, as can diabetes, an overactive thyroid (Chapter 7) and obesity (Chapter
10). Obstruction of the heart valves or heart valves that leak increases its
workload and this eventually weakens the contractions. Similarly, a narrowed
aortic valve means that the heart has to work harder because it has to force
blood through a smaller exit, again imposing an extra metabolic burden.
High blood pressure (Section 14.17) also means that the heart has to work
too hard. Diseases that affect electrical conduction in the heart can result in
an abnormal heartbeat that reduces the pumping efficiency. Other causes are
also known. Although the increased workload initially results in enlargement,
or hypertrophy, of the heart muscle so that it can contract with greater force,
eventually the heart malfunctions making the heart failure worse.
Heart failure results in tiredness and weakness during physical activities
because the skeletal muscles are starved of blood. The disease may be on one
side of the heart or the other, but the condition usually affects the whole heart.
Nevertheless, there are characteristic symptoms depending on which side is
affected. Thus right-sided disease tends to cause a build-up of blood flowing
into the right side of the heart, which leads to swelling of the feet, ankles, legs
and liver. In contrast, left-sided disease increases fluid in the lungs (pulmonary
edema) causing, in turn, shortness of breath. At first this is only experienced
during exertion but it gradually increases in severity so that the breathlessness
occurs even at rest. If this happens at night, the patient may wake up gasping
for breath and may find it better to sleep in a sitting position. Cardiac failure
gradually worsens with time if the underlying disease is not treated, although
patients may continue to live for many years.

INVESTIGATION
The symptoms described above are usually sufficient for an initial diagnosis
of heart failure, which would be confirmed by a weak and rapid pulse, lowered
blood pressure and abnormal heart sounds. However, its underlying cause
must also be identified. In many cases taking a clinical history and examining
the patients will be sufficient. General diagnostic tests include chest X-ray
to demonstrate an enlarged heart and fluid accumulation in the lungs, ECG,
echocardiography, blood tests, for example full blood count, liver function,
urea and electrolytes (Chapters 8, 11 and 13), and analysis of cardiac enzymes
in acute heart failure to diagnose myocardial infarction (Box 14.4) will then
usually be carried out. Functional tests may also be performed, including
exercise testing, ECG monitoring and angiography at rest and under stress.

TREATMENT
The treatment for heart failure is focused on relieving the symptoms,
retarding the progression of the disease and aiming to improve the chances

Margin Note 14.3 ACE inhibitors

i

Angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE)
inhibitors are used to treat chronic
heart failure and high blood pressure.
The drugs block the conversion of
angiotensin I to angiotensin II which
is both a vasoconstrictor and the
most important stimulus for the
release of aldosterone (Chapter 8)
from the adrenal cortex. Angiotensin
converting enzyme inhibitors are
therefore effective antihypertensives.
Their effect is to lower the systemic
vascular resistance, venous pressure
and reduce levels of circulating
catecholamines, thus improving
myocardial performance. The Ô¨Årst
ACE inhibitor used was captopril but
a number of other drugs are now
available. The way in which they
work is well understood. If the Ô¨Çow
of blood through the kidneys is low
they release renin which converts
angiotensinogen to angiotensin I.
Subsequently ACE converts
angiotensin I into angiotensin II.
Among its other effects on blood
vessels, angiotensin II causes the
division of heart muscle cells and
Ô¨Åbrosis that can make heart failure
more serious in the long run. Giving
ACE inhibitors reduces or eliminates
these effects. Angiotensin converting
enzyme inhibitors are used routinely
postmyocardial infarction, to
maintain good cardiac action and
prevent heart failure.

DISORDERS OF THE CARDIOVASCULAR SYSTEM

of survival. This means that any factor aggravating the failure should be
identified and treated. The precise cause of failure should be identified and
if possible corrected. Patients should be nursed in a comfortable, upright
position.

CHRONIC HEART FAILURE
In chronic heart failure, the circulation at rest is adequate but there is an
inadequate reserve to pursue daily activities. Its treatment depends upon the
underlying disease to be dealt with. For example, heart surgery can correct
narrowed or leaking heart valves, and bypass surgery can correct blocked
coronary arteries. If the disease is caused by an infection the condition may
be improved by antibiotics without surgery. Additionally, there are many
things a patient can be advised to do to help the condition, including giving
up smoking, eating less salt, reducing excessive weight and controlling alcohol
consumption.
The best treatment for heart failure is to prevent it happening in the first
place or by reversing its underlying cause as soon as possible. Nevertheless,
there is still much that can be done. For example, if reducing the salt intake
does not lower fluid retention then diuretics may be prescribed. A reduction
in the amount of body fluid reduces the volume of blood to be pumped
and so alleviates the strain on the heart. Digoxin may be given to increase
the power of each heart contraction and will slow a rate that is too rapid.
Vasodilatory drugs may be prescribed to expand blood vessels, lowering the
blood pressure. Some of the older drugs dilate arteries more than veins or
vice versa. However, the ACE inhibitors (angiotensin converting enzyme
inhibitors (Margin Note 14.3)) dilate both arteries and veins are, perhaps, the
most commonly used. These improve the symptoms and prolong life. A heart
transplant is perhaps the ultimate possibility but there are never enough
good hearts to go round!

ACUTE HEART FAILURE
In acute heart failure, the hemodynamic derangement is so severe that it
results in symptoms even at rest. If fluid suddenly accumulates in the lungs
the condition is known as acute pulmonary edema and the person has to
gasp for breath and emergency treatment is required. Oxygen is given by a
facemask and together with intravenous diuretics may result in a rapid and
dramatic improvement. Glyceryltrinitrate may be given intravenously or
placed under the tongue and this leads to dilation of the veins, reducing the
amount of blood flowing through the lungs. It may be necessary to insert a
tube into the patient‚Äôs airway to help breathing. The treatment for acute heart
failure is essentially as for the chronic condition described above.

14.9 ISCHEMIC HEART DISEASE
Myocardial ischemia, meaning a lack of oxygen to the myocardium, is the
result of an imbalance between the demand of the myocardium for oxygen

(.+

W^dad\nd[Y^hZVhZ

CARDIOMYOPATHIES

and the amount supplied. There are several possible causes of this condition.
Firstly, the blood flow through the coronary arteries may be reduced because
of mechanical blockages, such as atheroma (plaque), thrombosis (a clot),
spasm, ostial stenosis, arteritis or any sort of blockage (an embolism) due
to, for example, tumor cells or an air bubble. Secondly, a decreased flow
of oxygenated blood to the myocardium because of anemia (Chapter 13),
hypotension (low blood pressure) or carbon monoxide poisoning (Chapter
12). Thirdly, an increased demand for oxygen caused by exercise or myocardial
hypertrophy that requires an increase in cardiac output. Note that in the last
two scenarios, the coronary arteries may be healthy. The commonest cause
of ischemic heart disease is coronary atheroma, which obstructs the flow of
blood through the coronary arteries.

14.10 CARDIOMYOPATHIES
Cardiomyopathy is a progressive disorder that impairs the function of the
ventricular muscle walls. It may come about as a result of a number of diseases
or may have no identifiable cause.

DILATED CONGESTIVE CARDIOMYOPATHY
Dilated congestive cardiomyopathy is not a single condition but a group of
heart disorders in which the ventricles have enlarged but are still not able to
pump enough blood to meet the needs of the body. Heart failure may result.
The commonest cause of the defect in developed countries is widespread
coronary artery disease, which leads to an inadequate blood supply to the
heart muscle. This causes damage and the undamaged muscle then stretches in
compensation. If this is inadequate to meet body needs, then dilated congestive
cardiomyopathy develops. Its symptoms are shortness of breath on exertion
and a rapid onset of tiredness due to the weakening of the heart‚Äôs pumping
action. The heart rate speeds up so blood pressure is normal or low, but fluid is
retained in the legs, abdomen and lungs. Enlargement of the heart can mean
that the valves do not close properly, leading to leakage, and this improper
closing may be heard as murmurs using a stethoscope. The stretching may
also increase the potential for arrhythmias. Electrocardiography or magnetic
resonance imaging (MRI, see Chapter 18) may be used to confirm the initial
diagnosis.
About 70% of people with the condition die within five years from the onset
of symptoms and the prognosis declines as the heart walls become thinner
with reduced contractibility. Men tend to survive only half as long as women
and blacks half as long as whites. In about half of the cases there is sudden
death. Treating the underlying cause, for example reducing alcohol abuse
can prolong life. When there is coronary artery disease there may be angina
(Section 14.13), which is treated with glyceryltrinitrate, A-blockers or calcium
channel blockers. There may also be pooling of blood in the swollen heart
that can cause clots to form and therefore the patient is given anticoagulants
(Chapter 13 and Box 14.3).

DISORDERS OF THE CARDIOVASCULAR SYSTEM

BOX 14.3 Anticoagulant therapy
Venous thromboembolism is a common problem after surgery,
especially in patients who are elderly, have malignancies or have
a previous history of thrombosis. There is also a high incidence
in patients conÔ¨Åned to bed after trauma or a variety of heart
diseases. Its prevention and treatment includes the use of
anticoagulants, such as heparin, warfarin and aspirin.

HEPARIN
Heparin is a mixture of polysaccharides prepared from pig
gastric mucosa. It potentiates the formation of irreversible
complexes between antithrombin III (AT-III), a potent inhibitor
of coagulation and several coagulation factors, for example

thrombin, and factors XIIa, XIa, Xa, IXa and VIIa (Chapter 13).
Its injection has an immediate effect on blood coagulation,
but its action is quite short-lived. Bleeding complications of
heparin treatment occasionally occur and are treated by giving
the positively charged protein, protamine. Low Mr heparins,
produced by chemical degradation of standard heparin, have
somewhat different properties. They have a longer half-life
than heparin and so can be given as a once or twice daily
subcutaneous injection (preferred) or as a continuous infusion
or six-hourly injection, as is required with regular heparin. They
also seem to cause less inhibition of platelet function and thus
there is a reduced risk of causing bleeding.

Myocarditis, which is an acute inflammation of the heart muscle, occurs as a
result of a viral infection, most often coxsackie virus B, hence it is sometimes
called viral cardiomyopathy. It may weaken the heart muscle, producing a
condition similar to dilated congestive cardiomyopathy. A number of chronic
hormonal disorders (Chapter 7) including diabetes and thyroid disease can
also produce cardiomyopathy, as can prolonged alcohol abuse (Chapter 12).

HYPERTROPHIC CARDIOMYOPATHY
Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is a group of conditions in which the ventricular
walls thicken. It may occur as a birth defect, in adults with acromegaly or in
people with pheochromocytoma, a tumor of the adrenal gland (Chapter 7).
The heart becomes thicker and stiffer than normal and more resistant to
filling with blood from the lungs, leading to a backpressure on the lung veins
causing a pulmonary edema. The patient therefore becomes chronically short
of breath, with symptoms that include faintness, chest pains and palpitations
brought on by irregular heartbeats; the heart sounds through a stethoscope are
usually characteristic. Younger patients tended to die suddenly of hypertrophic
cardiomyopathy but with better and earlier diagnosis and drug therapies this
is now less of a problem.
Margin Note 14.4 Amyloidosis

i

There are several forms of this disease
in which amyloid, an unusual form of
protein that is not normally present
in the body, accumulates in various
tissues. One type of amyloidosis
affects the heart and is associated
with normal aging, but what causes
the build up of the amyloid protein
is not known with any certainty. The
condition may not need treatment
and, in any case, treatments are not
usually very successful. A patient
with heart problems may be given a
heart transplant, but the transplanted
organ itself may be affected later.

(.-

The main treatments are administering A-blockers and calcium channel
blockers. Surgery to remove some of the heart muscle may improve the
outflow of blood but this is only undertaken when the patient is incapacitated
despite drug therapy.

RESTRICTIVE CARDIOMYOPATHY
Restrictive cardiomyopathy is the least common of the cardiomyopathies.
It has many features in common with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. The
replacement of heart muscle tissue with scar tissue or its infiltration with
abnormal material, such as white blood cells, amyloidosis and sarcoidosis
(Margin Notes 14.4 and 14.5) can all lead to the condition, although its cause
is frequently unknown. The major symptoms are shortness of breath and an
edematous swelling of the tissues. About 70% of individuals with the disease
die within about five years of the symptoms commencing. In most cases
therapy is unsatisfactory. The use of diuretics, which are normally given to
treat heart failure and reduce the amount of fluid accumulating in the tissues,
may actually reduce the amount of blood entering the heart and worsen the
condition.

W^dad\nd[Y^hZVhZ

HEART TUMORS

ORAL ANTICOAGULANTS

ASPIRIN

Oral anticoagulants work by interfering with vitamin K
metabolism (Chapters 10 and 13). Vitamin K is a cofactor
required for the formation of F-carboxyglutamate residues in
prothrombin. The coumarin anticoagulant, warfarin, is most
frequently used because of its low incidence of side effects
other than promoting bleeding. However, many drugs interact
with warfarin. Tricyclic antidepressants, cloÔ¨Åbrate, aspirin, and
alcohol increase the anticoagulant effect of warfarin, while other
drugs such as rifampicin and barbiturates decrease this effect.
Contraindications include pregnancy, peptic ulcers, severe liver
and renal disease and preexisting hemostatic disease.

Low doses of aspirin inhibits platelet aggregation by blocking
cyclooxygenase activity irreversibly thus altering the balance
between the complex fatty acids, prostacyclin and thromboxane
A2 which is required for platelet activation. Clinical trials have
conÔ¨Årmed that long-term treatment with aspirin greatly reduces
the risk of myocardial infarction (and death) in patients with
angina.

14.11 HEART VALVE DISORDERS
Major problems encountered with heart valves include an improper closing
of the valves leading to leakage (regurgitation) or failure to open fully
(stenosis). These conditions interfere with the heart‚Äôs capacity to pump
blood. If the mitral valve leaks, then regurgitation occurs each time the
ventricle contracts. As blood is pumped into the aorta some leaks back into
the left atrium increasing the volume and the pressure in that compartment.
This, in turn, increases the blood pressure in the vessels leading from the
lungs to the heart resulting in a pulmonary edema. Rheumatic fever was
once the commonest cause of mitral valve regurgitation (Box 14.2) and heart
attacks that damage the structures supporting the valve is its commonest
cause. However, in countries where there is poor preventive medicine,
rheumatic fever is still common. Repair or replacement of the valve is
required if the regurgitation is severe.
The aortic valve may also become leaky, and the most common causes
were rheumatic fever and syphilis but this is now rare because of the use
of antibiotics. In contrast, aortic valve stenosis is mainly a disease of the
elderly (over 60 years) and is the result of the valve becoming calcified. The
left ventricle wall thickens as the heart strains to pump sufficient blood
through the narrow opening and the enlarged heart muscle requires extra
oxygen and nutrients from the coronary arteries. Eventually the output of
blood from the heart becomes insufficient for the body's needs and the
resulting heart failure causes shortness of breath and fatigue. The treatment
is to replace the aortic valve, preferably before the left ventricle becomes
irreparably damaged.

Margin Note 14.5 Sarcoidosis

i

In sarcoidosis, abnormal collections
of inÔ¨Çammatory cells called
granulomas, commonly appear in
lymph nodes, lungs, liver, eyes and
skin, but can also occur in the spleen,
bones, joints, skeletal muscles, heart
and nervous system. The cause of
the disease is unknown but seems
to result from an abnormal response
of the immune system. In some
instances there are no symptoms,
while in others there can be fever,
weight loss and aching joints. Often
the condition clears up spontaneously
and the granulomas may eventually
disappear or become scar tissue. In
other cases, there may be permanent
damage, such as lung scarring.
Most people do not need treatment
but corticosteroids may be used to
suppress severe symptoms, such as
shortness of breath or severe skin
lesions.

Problems can also occur with the tricuspid valve. However, regurgitation
usually requires little treatment. Stenosis of the tricuspid valve is rare, again,
because the damage was mainly associated with rheumatic fever.

14.12 HEART TUMORS
Heart tumors (Chapter 17) may be asymptomatic or precipitate lifethreatening crises, such as sudden heart failure, sudden onset of irregular
heartbeat or a sudden drop in blood pressure caused by bleeding into the
pericardium. They are relatively uncommon and are difficult to diagnose.

DISORDERS OF THE CARDIOVASCULAR SYSTEM

14.13 ATHEROSCLEROSIS OR ARTERIOSCLEROSIS
Atherosclerosis or arteriosclerosis refers to the simultaneous development
of an atheroma in an artery and the sclerosis of its wall. An atheroma (from
the Greek word for porridge) is a hard yellow plaque that gradually builds
up on the inside of medium-sized arteries. The plaque consists of a necrotic
(dead) core rich in cholesterol, surrounded by fibrous tissue. Sclerosis (from
the Greek word for hard) means an abnormal hardening or fibrosis, which
is the formation of excess fibrous material within a tissue. Sufferers may
experience a sudden heart attack or stroke, but this belies the fact that in
most cases the arteries of the victims have gradually become blocked by
atherosclerosis.
Initially atheromatous plaques start at the site in an artery where the smooth
muscle layer has thickened and been infiltrated with fibrous connective tissue
(fibrosis) when cholesterol and other lipids have been deposited, and may
become calcified. This condition is commonly referred to as hardening of the
arteries. During the course of the disease, the affected artery expands as the
plaque becomes larger so as to allow a more or less normal flow of blood.
However, as the plaque increases in size this becomes less possible and the
lumen of the artery becomes narrower and a ballooning of the arterial wall
causes it to weaken. Also, there is more likelihood of an embolus becoming
trapped in the narrowed artery making the blockage worse. Healthy arteries
are lined with endothelial cells, but the rough lining of a plaque-damaged
artery seems to encourage the adhesion of platelets which means they are
common sites for the formation of a clot (thrombus).
The progresses of atheromatous disease means the arteries become
increasingly occluded and the threat of a heart attack or stroke increases.
Some patients may receive warning in the form of chest pains if, for example,
a coronary artery is partially blocked. The condition known as angina pectoris
(see below) is a signal that the heart is not receiving sufficient oxygen. This
is most likely to occur when the heart is working hard because of physical
or emotional stress. However, for many people there are no symptoms and
they are completely unaware of their condition until the catastrophic event
occurs. Some individuals have an inherited tendency to develop hypertension
(Section 14.17), which promotes atherosclerosis and increases the risk of heart
attack or stroke and can cause chronic damage to the endothelium lining the
arteries promoting atherosclerosis.

ANGINA
Angina pectoris is caused by myocardial ischemia. It presents as a crushing
or squeezing pain in the chest and the discomfort may radiate into the neck,
jaw, arms (especially the left) and sometimes into the back. There may also
be shortness of breath, abdominal pain, nausea and dizziness. Myocardial
oxygen demand relates to the heart rate, left ventricular contractility
and systolic wall stress. The demand for oxygen is increased by exercise,
hypertension (Section 14.17) and left ventricular dilation, which may happen
in chronic heart failure.
Several types of angina are recognized. Stable angina occurs when
atherosclerotic plaques block one or more of the coronary arteries. Under
resting conditions, cardiac oxygen demand is quite low and is satisfied even
by the diminished blood flow. However, when exertion or emotional stresses
increase this oxygen demand, ischemia develops on the inner part of the
myocardial wall. However, the response to exercise is variable: some patients
may have excellent exercise tolerance one day and then develop angina with
minimal exertion the next. In addition to causing pain, the ischemia causes a
decline in the output of ATP and creatine phosphate and hence contractility is

impaired. Stable angina is normally relieved by a short rest or by administering
glyceryltrinitrate. The latter dilates the arteries, increasing blood, and therefore
oxygen, supplies to the muscle leading to less pain.
Variant angina is an intensely painful, transient spasm caused by a blockage of
one of the coronary arteries. It is relatively uncommon, but can occur at rest.
It is exacerbated by smoking and by cocaine use. About one-third of patients
show no evidence of atherosclerotic lesions.
Ischemic heart disease and stable angina can be distinguished from other
conditions that cause chest pain on the basis of their characteristic symptoms
and by a number of types of diagnostic tests, for example the ECG, exercise
stress test and by using coronary angiography to obtain a direct radiographic
visualization, as described earlier.
The management of angina is designed to control the symptoms and reduce
any underlying risk factors. The drugs used include the nitrovasodilators,
for example glyceryltrinitrate, A-adrenoceptor blockers, calcium channel
antagonists, as well as drugs that inhibit platelet aggregation and thrombosis
(Margin Note 14.6 and Chapter 13). In the case of stable angina, mortality is
2 to 4% a year if only one coronary artery is diseased but increases with the
number of diseased arteries.
The other main variant of angina is the so-called unstable angina, which is
a dangerous condition, often heralding an impending myocardial infarction
(Section 14.14). In general, the symptoms resemble those of stable angina
but are more intense and persistent, often lasting 30 min, and the pain is
often resistant to glyceryltrinitrate treatment. The attacks may be frequent,
becoming progressively more severe and prolonged, may be brought on
by minimal exertion (or even during sleep) or may occur several days after
a myocardial infarction. The episodes are preceded by a fall in coronary
blood flow, which is thought to be the result of the periodic development of
coronary thrombosis and vasoconstriction. These are triggered by coronary
arterial disease. The thrombosis may be promoted by the turbulent blood
flow associated with atherosclerotic plaques: there may also be damage to
the endothelial lining of the blood vessels.
An ECG is taken to help in the diagnosis but, in addition, serum levels
of C-reactive protein and amyloid-A protein may be increased; these are
classic markers of inflammation. Unstable angina is a medical emergency
and treatment usually begins with aggressive drug therapy to control the
symptoms and prevent further episodes, and to try to reverse coronary
vasospasm. Platelet glycoproteins IIIA and IIb (Tirofiban and ReoPro) are now
used in unstable angina to stabilize the clot in the narrowed coronary artery,
which is causing the pain, prior to angiography and possibly angioplasty and
stenting. Angioplasty is a procedure similar to angiography (Section 14.5)
but the catheter delivers a small inflatable balloon to the narrowed portion
of the coronary artery. When the balloon is inflated it opens the restricted
section of the artery. Stents are very small, coated spring-like structures
that are deployed, by cardiac catheters into the narrowed section following
angioplasty. They act like miniature struts to maintain the opening of the
vessel.

Margin Note 14.6 Thrombolysis

i

Thrombolysis is the dissolution of
a blood clot blocking an artery.
Fibrinolysis occurs when the inactive
zymogen, plasminogen, is converted
to the Ô¨Åbrin-dissolving active enzyme
plasmin by endothelium-derived
tissue plasminogen activator (t-PA).
Plasmin also inactivates Ô¨Åbrinogen
and coagulation factors V and VIII
(Chapter 13).
Streptokinase is a bacterial
protein that binds to a molecule
of plasminogen. The resulting
complex cleaves other molecules
of plasminogen to produce more
plasmin, which dissolves the
Ô¨Åbrin. It can cause hemorrhage
and also it can only be used once
since it may cause the patient
to produce antibodies with the
danger of an allergic reaction.
Tissue plasminogen activator is
now produced commercially by
recombinant DNA methods and
marketed as tenecteplase and
alteplase. Tenecteplase is now the
thrombolytic of choice. It binds to
Ô¨Åbrin and this has a greater effect
on clot-associated plasminogen than
on plasma plasminogen. It has the
advantage that it is cleared from
the plasma in a few minutes and is
nonantigenic. Urokinase (u-PA) is
another endogenous plasminogen
activator with properties similar to
those of t-PA.

Urgent revascularization needs to be considered for patients at high risk,
or unsuitable for angioplasty/stenting due to significant coronary arterial
disease. In a coronary artery bypass grafting a length of healthy ‚Äòsurplus‚Äô blood
vessel, such as the saphenous vein from the leg (Figure 14.13), is obtained and
pieces of it are inserted between the aorta and the coronary arteries distal to
any stenosis (narrowing). The left internal mammary artery may also be used.
A bypass improves survival in patients with severe atherosclerotic disease in
all the major coronary arteries.

Aside from any inherited tendency to develop hypertension (Section 14.17),
there are a number of nongenetic factors that correlate with an increased
risk of cardiovascular disease. These include smoking, lack of exercise, a
diet containing too much and inappropriate fat types (Chapter 10); all lead
to an abnormal concentration of cholesterol in the blood. Homocysteine is
known to be raised in certain genetic conditions and coronary heart disease
and is suspected to have a role in increasing cholesterol levels. Homocysteine
concentrations can be lowered by treatments with folate and vitamin B12 with
a subsequent reduction in blood cholesterol.
Cholesterol is essential because it forms part of the plasma membrane of cells
and is used in the biosynthesis of bile salts and steroid hormones. However,
atherosclerosis is largely due to problems with cholesterol. The body can
synthesize it but it is also obtained from the diet. Cholesterol is practically
insoluble in plasma and, like triacylglycerols, is transported in the blood
in lipoprotein particles. It is an imbalance between the different types of
lipoprotein particles that leads to clinical problems.
Plasma lipoprotein particles consist of a core of triacylglycerols and cholesterol
esters surrounded by phospholipids, proteins and free cholesterol (Figure
14.14). They are classified by their densities, the greater the proportion of
triacylglycerol the lower the density (Table 14.1). There are several different
types of lipoproteins in lipoprotein particles, called apolipoprotein-A and ‚ÄìB,
-C, -D and -E, usually abbreviated to apoA, apoB, apoC, apoD and apoE.
The transport of cholesterol round the body is a complicated process (Figure
14.15). There is some cholesterol in the chylomicrons derived from the diet,
but the liver exports the cholesterol obtained from the diet or synthesized,
together with triacylglycerols it synthesized from dietary carbohydrate,

in the form of very low density lipoproteins (VLDL). These contain the
apolipoprotein, B-100, but the major lipids are triacylglycerols, with less
than 20% free cholesterol and cholesteryl esters (Table 14.1). A primary
determinant of the amount of VLDL secreted is the amount of free fatty
acids entering the liver. Further, if saturated fatty acids predominate, the
VLDL particles are smaller but more numerous than if polyunsaturated fatty
acids are in excess. A high carbohydrate diet also substantially increases
the concentration of plasma VLDL particles. Newly secreted VLDL particles
undergo a series of changes in the plasma. They acquire apoC and apoE
proteins from high density lipoproteins (HDL, see below). The catalyzed
hydrolysis of triacylglycerols by lipoprotein lipase of the endothelial cells
of capillaries allows the fatty acids and glycerol to be taken up by tissues.
The reduced triacylglycerol content increases the density of the VLDL so
that they become low density lipoproteins (LDL), and these particles are
the principal carriers of cholesterol in the plasma. Low density lipoprotein
particles serve as the major source of cholesterol for most of the tissues.
Although most cells can synthesize cholesterol, the bulk of synthesis occurs
in the liver and intestinal enterocytes.
The concentration of LDL in the plasma correlates positively with the
incidence of coronary heart disease. Hence LDL is often referred to as ‚Äòbad‚Äô
cholesterol. However, it is only ‚Äòbad‚Äô in excess, and when combined with
other risk factors. High density lipoproteins are secreted by the liver, but they
are also formed by modifications to chylomicrons and VLDL. High density
lipoproteins (Table 14.1) can pick up cholesterol from tissues, essentially the
opposite function to that of LDL. The particles probably acquire cholesterol
from the cell surface membranes and convert it enzymatically to cholesteryl
esters. Consequently HDL may be considered ‚Äògood‚Äô cholesterol.

Margin Note 14.7 Tangier disease

i

The removal of cholesterol from
cells uses a transporter protein that
hydrolyzes ATP in an active transport
process. The rare autosomal recessive
disease called Tangier disease is
associated with mutations in the
gene encoding this transporter,
and leads to an accumulation of
cholesterol esters in the tissues
and an almost complete absence
of cholesterol in HDL particles. The
name ‚ÄòTangier‚Äô comes from an island
off the coast of Virginia, USA, where
inbreeding amongst the families
that lived there in isolation made
it relatively common. The outlook
for sufferers of this mutation is
premature coronary heart disease.

Measuring serum cholesterol
It is necessary to know the concentration of LDL cholesterol in serum (Table
14.2) to assess risks to a person, diagnose an ailment and monitor the progress
of a patient. However, until recently this could only be determined by a rather
complicated laboratory technique not available for routine clinical use. An
empirical formula (the Friedewald Formula) was used to derive the LDL
cholesterol concentration from the HDL cholesterol and the triacylglycerol
levels. However, this formula is inaccurate and sometime fails completely,
such as when serum triacylglycerol concentrations are high. A newer test is
the LDL Direct method that isolates LDL cholesterol using an immunological
assay. It is more accurate, does not require the patient to fast and is not
affected by high concentrations of triacylglycerols in the serum.

Familial hypercholesterolemia
The circulating LDL particles are recognized by protein receptors on the
surfaces of liver cells and removed from the plasma by endocytosis into the
cells. Here their various components are metabolized, stored or recycled.
The disease, familial hypercholesterolemia, is an autosomal dominant
condition that affects heterozygotes, with a frequency of one in 500. It is
associated with a defective receptor on the liver cells. This disease has been
intensively investigated and a great deal is known about it. For the sufferers,
the problems are whitish-yellow deposits largely of cholesterol on the tendons
called xanthomas, and opaque fatty deposits around the periphery of the
cornea called corneal arcuses and an onset of coronary heart disease before
the age of 10 years in homozygotes. The blood cholesterol concentrations
in homozygotes are between 15 and 30 mmol dm‚Äì3 compared with normal
values of about 5.0.

14.14 MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION
An infarction is the death of a section of tissue because its blood supply has
been cut off; an infarct is the segment of tissue affected. In general, if one
artery is blocked neighboring arteries with communicating branches can
compensate and tissue death is limited. Infarction occurs in places where
small arteries do not communicate with one another, such as in the kidney,
or where all the arteries together supply only enough blood for the whole
organ, such as in the brain; or where alternative arteries are also blocked and
cannot take over. The latter is what happens to the coronary vessels in many
middle-aged hearts, particularly in the developed world. Thus myocardial
infarction almost always occurs in patients with atheroma in the coronary
arteries resulting from sudden coronary thrombosis, usually at the site of a
fissure or rupture of the surface of an atheromatous plaque. There may be
hemorrhage into the plaque with local coronary spasms. Irreparable damage
can begin after only 20 min of occlusion. After about six h, the site of infarction
of the myocardium is pale and swollen and after 24 h necrotic tissue appears

MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION

deep red owing to the hemorrhage. Subsequently an inflammatory reaction
develops and the infarcted tissue turns gray in color.
Myocardial infarction is the commonest cause of death in the UK but
surprisingly was hardly known before 1910. Patients present with severe
intermittent chest pain that is similar in character to the angina that can
occur on exertion, but usually occurring at rest and lasting several hours.
Sometimes, however, the pain is less severe and may be mistaken for
indigestion. The episodes of pain may become more frequent, but about 20%
of patients have no pain. If there is pain, the onset is usually, but not always,
sudden. The patient may feel restless and there is often sweating, nausea
and vomiting. The most recognizable pain is in the middle of the chest that
may spread to the back, jaw or left arm. The condition, once recognized, is a
medical emergency. Half of the deaths occur in the first three to four h after
the symptoms begin, so the sooner treatment begins the better the chances
of survival.

PLASMA ENZYMES IN MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION
The diagnosis of myocardial infarction is usually made on the basis of the
clinical symptoms and ECG findings, and is confirmed by the characteristic
changes in plasma enzyme activities (Box 14.4). The enzyme activities that are
of the greatest value are creatine kinase (CK), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and
aspartate transaminase (AST, previously known as GOT, glutamate oxaloacetate
transaminase). Plasma enzyme activities are increased in about 95% of cases
of myocardial infarction and sometimes increase to high levels. The degree
of increase gives a rough estimation of the size of the infarct but is of little
prognostic value. A second and subsequent rise after their return to normal
may indicate extension of the damage. All tend to show normal serum activities
until at least four h after the onset of chest pain due to the infarction and so
blood samples should not be taken until after this time. If the initial serum CK
activity is approximately normal, a second blood sample should be taken four
to six h later. An increase in plasma CK activity supports the diagnosis of an
infarction. The sequence of changes in plasma AST activity after a myocardial
infarction are similar to those for CK but the increases are significantly less.

TREATMENT
Usually the patient is given an aspirin to chew, which should improve the
chances of survival by reducing the clot in a coronary artery. A A-blocker may
also be given to slow the heart rate and reduce its workload. Oxygen may be
given through a facemask to deliver more oxygen to the heart. Blood clots in
an artery can often be cleared by intravenous thrombolytic therapy (Box 14.3
and Margin Note 14.6). The indication for thrombolytic treatment is usually
based on the clinical presentation and the ECG picture rather than on the
activities of plasma enzymes. Treatment must be given within 6 h of the start
of the heart attack to be effective. After 6 h it is likely that some of the damage
will be permanent and the patient could be compromized and some may die.
Most patients who survive for a few days after the attack can expect a full
recovery but about 10% will die within a year. The majority of deaths occur
in the next three to four months in patients who continue to have angina,
arrhythmias and subsequent heart failure.

CORONARY BYPASS SURGERY
In individuals who have angina and coronary arterial disease that is not too
widespread, coronary bypass surgery is a possible treatment that improves
exercise tolerance, reduces symptoms and decreases the number of drugs that
are needed. Bypass surgery involves grafting arteries or veins taken from the
leg to take blood from the aorta past the obstructed region, replacing the role
of the coronary arteries in supplying blood to the heart muscle. Such a graft
often works well for up to 10 years or more.

DISORDERS OF THE CARDIOVASCULAR SYSTEM

BOX 14.4 Diagnostic value of various plasma markers in heart disease

Aspartate transaminase (AST, formerly glutamate oxaloacetate
transaminase, GOT) is present in high concentrations in cardiac
and skeletal muscle tissues, liver, kidney and erythrocytes.
Damage to any of these tissues will increase the plasma level.
In myocardial infarction there may be a 10- to 100-fold increase
on the upper reference limit. The level will also increase after
cardiac surgery.
Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) is widely distributed in the tissues
of the body and is a relatively nonspeciÔ¨Åc marker of tissue
damage. The plasma activity may increase some Ô¨Åve-fold above
the upper reference limit in myocardial infarction. There are Ô¨Åve
isoenzymes of LDH (LDH1‚ÄìLDH5) and estimation of the relative
levels of their activities may help to identify which tissue is
damaged. Thus increase in the activities of LDH1 and LDH2 occurs
predominantly after myocardial infarction, although the levels
of all the isoenzymes may be increased. In contrast the level of
LDH5 is characteristically elevated after damage to liver or muscle
tissue.
Creatine kinase (CK) is abundant in the cells of cardiac and
skeletal muscle and in brain. Consequently, a marked rise in its
plasma activity occurs after myocardial infarction but, since the
enzyme is present in so many tissues, this by itself may not be
all that helpful. However, the enzyme consists of combinations
of two distinct subunits called M and B respectively, which
combine to form dimers characteristic of the tissue in which
they are found. Thus the isoenzyme, MM is predominant in

AST

Relative enzyme activities

The activities of a number of enzymes in blood samples are
used in diagnosing and monitoring some types of heart damage
and some other diseases (Figure 14.16). The activities of these
enzymes in a patient depend on the rate of their release into the
plasma from damaged cells and on the extent of cell damage.
Other factors that need to be considered include the rate of
cell proliferation and the rate of clearance of enzymes from
the circulation. The rate at which damage is occurring is also
important. Thus acute cell damage in viral hepatitis may lead
to high activities in plasma but these will fall as the condition
resolves. In contrast, in advanced cirrhosis of the liver, the rate of
cell damage may be low and consequently the plasma enzyme
levels may only be a little above normal.

cardiac and skeletal muscle, whereas the BB isoenzyme is
characteristic of brain and smooth muscle. The third isoenzyme,
MB, accounts for about 35% of the cardiac muscle activity
but less than 5% of that in skeletal muscle. The concentration
of this isoenzyme in plasma is always high after myocardial
infarction.
The triple marker blood test more easily distinguishes between
cardiac and skeletal or other muscle damage. The triple marker
consists of three components, which are myoglobin, troponin I
and CKMB. All three are cardiac speciÔ¨Åc and therefore more
reliable. Myoglobin is released from damaged cardiac muscle
and peaks by six h. Troponin I is evident after six h and peaks
at 12 to 16 h and remains in the system for two to four weeks.
Creatine kinase MB is evident after 12 h and is the cardiac isoform
of CK and therefore more accurate than total CK activity. The
triple marker blood test is especially valuable when there are no
or nonspeciÔ¨Åc ECG changes and can assist in clinical decision
making.

14.15 PERICARDIAL DISEASES
The pericardium can become inflamed producing acute or chronic
pericarditis. However, the pericardium is not absolutely essential to life and
can be removed without significantly affecting the functioning of the heart.
Acute pericarditis has a sudden and often painful onset. There are also
characteristic heart sounds. Symptoms include fever and chest pain that

DISORDERS OF ARTERIES AND VEINS

typically extends to the left shoulder and down the left arm. The inflammation
causes fluid and blood components, such as fibrin, erythrocytes and
leukocytes, to pour into the pericardial space. The inflammation may be
caused by a viral infection, in which case the condition may be painful but
short-lived and have no lasting effects, or result from a number of other
causes, for example cancer, heart attack, AIDS, kidney failure, heart surgery
and the side effects of certain drugs, some of which are life-threatening. The
treatment for acute pericarditis is to hospitalize the patient and treat with
antiinflammatory drugs, such as aspirin or ibuprofen that also reduce the
pain. Further treatment depends on the underlying cause. Individuals with
cancer that has invaded the pericardium rarely survive longer than 12‚Äì18
months.
The chronic form of the disease develops gradually and is long-lasting. Usually
the cause is unknown, but cancer and a reduced thyroid function have been
implicated.

14.16 DISORDERS OF ARTERIES AND VEINS
A number of clinical disorders are associated with arteries and veins. These
include peripheral arterial disease, arterial aneurysms and dissections, strokes,
varicose veins and deep vein thromboses.

PERIPHERAL ARTERIAL DISEASE
Peripheral arterial disease can affect the abdominal aorta and its major
branches including the arteries to the legs. Obstruction can be sudden or
gradual. Most patients with peripheral arterial disease have atherosclerosis
that gradually narrows the arteries. Partial occlusion can also result from a
blood clot resulting in a sudden decrease in the oxygen supply. A sudden,
complete obstruction normally results from a clot lodging in a narrowed
artery. Emergency surgery or the use of thrombolytic drugs may be needed to
remove the obstruction.

ANEURYSMS
An aneurysm is a round or tube-like bulge that usually develops in weak
areas of an arterial wall. There are many reasons for the development of
aneurysms, but high blood pressure and cigarette smoking increase the
risks. Also, a blood clot may form in the aneurysm. If an aneurysm occurs
in the aorta, an aortic aneurysm, rupture, hemorrhage and separation of
the layers of the wall (called dissection, see below) can occur with disastrous
results. Such conditions can be immediately fatal although most take years
to develop. Aortic aneurysm can develop anywhere along its length but
over 70% of them occur in the segment that run through the abdomen.
An individual with abdominal aortic aneurysm usually becomes aware of
a pulsing sensation in the abdomen, with a deep penetrating pain mainly
in the back. The aneurysm may rupture, with severe internal bleeding, and
the patient will typically go into severe shock (Section 14.17). Aortic rupture
is frequently fatal. The treatment of ruptured aneurysms involves surgical
repair, which is extremely risky. However, many patients are diagnosed early
during a routine examination, and then surgery to insert a synthetic graft can
be used to repair the aneurysm with a good chance of success.

AORTIC DISSECTION
In an aortic dissection the inner lining of the vessel wall tears allowing blood to
surge through the tear, splitting the middle layer and creating a new channel.
The condition usually results from a deterioration of the arterial wall caused,

in most cases, by high blood pressure, but it can also be a consequence of
certain hereditary conditions. The clinical picture includes stroke, heart
attack, sudden abdominal pain, nerve damage and an inability to move a limb.
Treatment in intensive care is required. Drugs are given to reduce the heart
rate and lower the blood pressure. Thereafter a decision needs to be taken
as to whether to carry out surgery to replace the portion of damaged blood
vessel with a synthetic graft. Untreated, about 75% of patients die within two
weeks, but following treatment several years of life are possible in the majority
of cases even though the death rate from surgery is 15% or more.

STROKE
If the blood supply to the brain is disrupted for any length of time the brain
cells can be permanently damaged or die due to the lack of oxygen and this
is called a cerebrovascular accident (CVA) or stroke (Figure 14.17). Brain cells
are also damaged if bleeding into the brain occurs. Therefore strokes can be
either ischemic or hemorrhagic. In ischemic stroke the blood supply to part
of the brain is cut off either because of atherosclerosis or a clot blocking a
blood vessel. In hemorrhagic stroke, a blood vessel bursts, preventing normal
flow of blood and allowing it to leak into an area of the brain and destroy it.
In the developed world, strokes are the most common cause of disabling
neurological damage resulting, typically, in a loss of speech and/or loss of motor
function on one side of the body. High blood pressure and atherosclerosis
are the major risk factors. The incidence is falling because the importance
of controlling high blood pressure and dealing with inappropriate blood
cholesterol levels has been recognized. Clinicians can usually diagnose a stroke
from the clinical history of events and a physical examination. Computerized
tomography scans and MRI (Chapter 18) are used for differential diagnoses.
Many people who have had a stroke recover some or all of their normal
functions but others may be mentally and physically devastated, unable to
speak or move normally. About 20% of people who have had a stroke die
in hospital and the older the patient the greater the risk of this happening.
Since each area of the brain is served by specific blood vessels, the area
where the cerebrovascular accident occurs decides which part of the body
becomes disabled. The loss of function is greatest just after the stroke and
some function may return subsequently. This is because although some brain
cells die, others may recover and take over a given function at least partially.
The immediate treatment is to give oxygen to try to prevent further damage.
Anticoagulants may be given if the stroke is ischemic but these are of little use

once the stroke is completed. Surgery is not normally of much use since the
brain cells are already dead. For the survivors, a long period of rehabilitation
may be required.

VARICOSE VEINS
Varicose veins are enlarged superficial veins, which occur particularly in the
legs (Figure 14.18). The cause(s) of this condition is(are) not precisely known,
but is probably due to a weakness in the walls of the veins which may be
inherited. Over time, the veins lose their elasticity and they stretch and become
wider. They may take on a tortuous, snake-like appearance, and cause bulges
in the skin over them. The widening causes the valve cusps to separate (Figure
14.19) and as a result the veins fill with blood when the person stands and the
veins bulge even more. As well as being unsightly, the legs feel tired and the
veins ache, and after removing socks or stockings the legs may itch. There may
be other complications and minor injuries may cause an ulcer that fails to
heal. Varicose veins are common during pregnancy but these usually improve
during the two to three weeks following delivery. Hypertension and obesity
may have parts to play in the propensity for varicose veins.

Treatment for varicose veins
Varicose veins cannot be cured, but the symptoms may be relieved in
various ways. Elevating the legs on a stool when sitting down and wearing
elasticated stockings compress the veins and prevent them hurting, but
these are not cures. They may be treated surgically by either stripping or by
injection therapy. Stripping involves removing as many of the varicose veins
as possible. The superficial veins play a less important role than the deep
veins in returning blood to the heart and their removal does not impair the
circulation significantly. Two incisions are made; one in the groin and one at
the ankle while the patient is under general anesthetic. The saphenous vein
(Figure 14.13) is then removed by threading a flexible wire through the vein,
which is pulled to remove the entire vein. However, surgery does not remove
the tendency to develop new varicose veins. Injection therapy involves sealing
the veins by injecting an irritant solution that causes a thrombus to form so
that no blood flows. Healing of the thrombus causes scar tissue, which can
block the vein. However, the thrombus may dissolve allowing the vein to reopen. Injection therapy was popular but has fallen into disrepute, probably
because of poor techniques with resulting complications. The more modern
techniques, if carried out carefully, seem to be successful.

DEEP VEIN THROMBOSIS
Deep vein thrombosis is blood clotting in the deep veins. Like varicose veins,
they primarily affect the legs. They are potentially dangerous. All or part of
the clot or thrombus can break loose and lodge in a narrow artery in the lung
obstructing blood flow, causing a pulmonary embolism. In serious cases this
can result in blockage of all or nearly all of the blood travelling from the right
side of the heart to the lungs rapidly causing death. Such serious consequences
are not common but it is impossible to predict what will happen once a
thrombus has formed. It is believed that the possible causes of this condition
are an increased tendency of the blood to clot, which can happen with some
cancers (Chapter 17) and very occasionally with oral contraceptives; slowing of
the blood movement in the veins, as may also occur in prolonged bed rest or,
sitting on a long flight and some types of injury or major surgery. The condition
is difficult to diagnose until the thrombus moves. Deep vein thrombosis may
be prevented to some extent by flexing and extending the ankles from time
to time and by wearing elastic stockings. Anticoagulant therapy may also be
appropriate in some cases.

DISORDERS OF THE CARDIOVASCULAR SYSTEM

14.17 CLINICAL PROBLEMS ASSOCIATED WITH BLOOD
PRESSURE
The blood pressure of any individual varies with their age, sex, physical
activity and emotional state. For example, the normal upper limits at age
20 are 150/90 mmHg, which can increase to 160/95 and 170/95 at 40 and
60 years of age. If these pressures are found consistently then they are
abnormally high. Blood pressure also varies with ethnic origin. American
blacks, for example, are much more likely to have high blood pressure than
whites.
The three major factors that determine the blood pressure are the amount
of blood pumped by the heart, the volume of blood in the blood vessels
and the elasticity of the blood vessels. Thus the more blood pumped
by the heart, the higher the pressure. If the heart beats more slowly or its
contractions are weakened, such as may happen after myocardial infarction
(Section 14.14), then less blood will be pumped. Equally, a rapid heartbeat
can result in inefficient pumping. The greater the volume of blood in
circulation, the more likely the blood pressure is to be high. Conversely, a
loss of blood by bleeding or as a result of dehydration will have the opposite
effect. The smaller the capacity of the blood vessels, the higher will be the
resulting blood pressure. Consequently, a dilation of the blood vessels will
lower the blood pressure.
Sensors in the neck and chest continually monitor the blood pressure and
trigger physiological changes if the blood pressure changes (Chapter 8). The
actions taken might be to modify and strengthen the heartbeat, to regulate
the kidneys to alter the amount of water excreted which, in turn, changes the
volume of blood circulating or to constrict or dilate the blood vessels. However,
these compensatory mechanisms have limits, for example if too much blood
is lost as a result of bleeding there is little that can be done. Action must be
taken to stop the bleeding and to transfuse blood or fluid to make up the
volume. Furthermore, these compensatory mechanisms may themselves fail
in certain conditions.

LOW BLOOD PRESSURE (HYPOTENSION)
Clearly the heart must pump hard enough so that the blood pressure is
maintained. Pressures below 100/60 mmHg at any age are abnormally low. If
an individual‚Äôs blood pressure is too low it can lead to dizziness and fainting.
Fainting or syncope is the result of a temporary inadequacy of oxygen and
nutrients and is usually associated with a temporary decrease in blood flow.
This can happen in people with an abnormal heart rhythm when they suddenly
begin to exercise or the heart rate is too slow. However, there are many other
possible causes of fainting including anemia, hypoglycemia, hypocapnia
(a lower than usual concentration of CO2 in the blood) or hyperventilation.
The latter may be caused by anxiety. Usually lying flat is all that is needed
for the individual to regain consciousness but checks should be performed to
eliminate more serious conditions and this may mean, for example, an ECG
examination.

SHOCK
If the blood pressure falls too low to sustain life, the body is said to have gone
into shock. This is more severe and prolonged than in fainting, since if body
cells are deprived of oxygen and nutrients for any length of time then they
quickly become irreversibly damaged and die. Shock may result from low
blood volume, inadequate pumping by the heart or excessive vasodilation as
can occur in extreme allergic reactions (Chapter 5). Low blood volume may

)&%

W^dad\nd[Y^hZVhZ

CLINICAL PROBLEMS ASSOCIATED WITH BLOOD PRESSURE

be the result of bleeding following serious trauma. Inadequate pumping by
the heart may be the result of a heart attack, pulmonary embolism, the failure
of a heart valve or an irregular heartbeat or drug toxicity. Head injuries, liver
failure, poisoning, severe bacterial infections or drug reactions may all lead to
excessive blood vessel dilation.
Unless treated promptly, shock is usually fatal. When shock results from a
sudden loss of blood for example in an accident or a hemorrhage the first
person on the scene should aim to stop the bleeding, keep the victim warm and
raise the legs slightly to improve the return of blood to the heart. Emergency
personnel may provide mechanically assisted breathing, if it has stopped, and
fluid or blood to increase the blood volume. Other treatments will depend on
the cause of the shock.

HIGH BLOOD PRESSURE (HYPERTENSION)
Hypertension refers simply to the condition where a person has a blood
pressure that is higher than that which is regarded as normal, regardless of
its cause. High blood pressure is defined as a systolic pressure at rest of 140
mmHg or greater and a diastolic pressure of 90 mmHg or greater, or both of
these. In fact both are usually elevated in hypertension. It does not usually
cause symptoms, at least for many years, and often tends to go undetected
unless the person‚Äôs blood pressure happens to be measured for some other
reason. Nevertheless, it is sometimes referred to as the ‚Äòsilent killer‚Äô because
there tend to be no symptoms until some vital organ is damaged. Mortality
and morbidity rise continuously with increasing blood pressure. However, the
risk is not linear and rises more steeply at higher pressures.
Initially an abnormal heart sound indicating hypertension may be detected
using a stethoscope. A diagnosis of hypertension can be made on the basis of
an elevated blood pressure reading of 140/90 mmHg or more when measured
several times. A single reading on a given day is unreliable. Obviously the higher
the values, the more serious the condition must be considered. It is possible to
judge the seriousness of the condition by examining the arterioles at the back
of the eye to determine the degree of damage to the retina, as hypertension
is known to cause retinopathy. In addition, ECG and echocardiography can
detect an enlargement of the heart brought on by the increased workload.
Kidney damage may be detected by urine analyses.
The cause of hypertension can be identified in less than 10% of patients.
These are usually kidney disease, a hormonal disorder or the use of oral
contraceptives. Thus in most cases the primary cause cannot be identified and
this form is referred to as essential hypertension. Many factors are probably
responsible. For example, in older people the larger arteries lose their flexibility
and become stiffer. Consequently when the heart pumps blood they cannot
expand and the pressure increases. If the kidneys malfunction such that the
urinary output is decreased, more fluid will be added to the system. Obesity,
stress, a sedentary lifestyle, excessive amounts of alcohol and too much salt in
the diet can also contribute.
Untreated hypertension increases the chances of a person developing heart
diseases, such as cardiac failure or myocardial infarction (Section 14.14),
kidney failure (Chapter 8), or a stroke (see above). Stopping smoking, reducing
weight, salt intake and cholesterol levels reduces the risk. In general, patients
do not have to restrict their activities as long as their blood pressure is
controlled. Various drugs are available as part of a treatment program. These
include diuretics to help the kidneys eliminate water and salt, adrenergic
blockers to block the effects of the sympathetic nervous system and ACE
inhibitors (Margin Note 14.3) which lower the blood pressure by stimulating
arterial dilation.

14.18 SUMMARY
The cardiovascular system comprises the heart and the blood vessels that
supply the organs and tissues of the body with, for example oxygen and
nutrients, and remove CO2 and other wastes. The heart pumps blood through
the pulmonary circulation that oxygenates the blood, and the systemic
circulation around the rest of the body. The heart pumps nonstop for millions
of beats during a person‚Äôs lifetime. However, there are a number of conditions
that can cause serious clinical problems. These can be investigated by listening
to the heart sounds using a stethoscope, by measuring its electrical activities
by an ECG, as well as studying its function by echocardiography. The rhythm
of the heart beat may be faulty and this may require correction, including the
insertion of an artificial pacemaker. The valves may function inappropriately
due to calcification or other diseases and may need to be replaced. Clinical
problems are also associated with blood vessels. These may become partially
or completely blocked because of atherosclerosis. When this happens to the
coronary arteries, bypass surgery with a grafted blood vessel may be required.
Atherosclerosis, caused by high levels of cholesterol in the blood, leads to

inappropriate changes in the plasma lipoproteins. A change of diet and drugs
may help this condition. The blood pressure may be excessively high in some
individuals. This can be dangerous and lead to heart failure and stroke. Here
again, drugs may be used to alleviate the condition. Heart failure needs to
be treated promptly otherwise permanent disability or death may occur. The
peripheral blood vessels can also become diseased. For example, the veins
returning blood to the heart may develop faulty valves leading to varicose
veins.

15.1 INTRODUCTION
Genes are the fundamental units of heredity and encode specific functional
products, such as RNA molecules and polypeptides. They are encoded by
sequences of bases in DNA molecules and are found at particular positions
in chromosomes in the nucleus and also in the relatively small circular DNA
molecules in the mitochondria. Only 37 of the approximately 22 000 human
genes occur in mitochondria although mutations of these may become
clinically significant as described in Chapter 16. The genes constitute the
blueprint or the set of instructions which affects hereditary characteristics, for
example hair and eye color, height and the susceptibility to certain diseases.
When a cell divides the genetic information needs to be replicated accurately
so that these instructions pass on to the daughter cells. When changes occur
in the base sequence of DNA, either as a result of incorrect replication or from
random changes caused by physical or chemical agents, then the instructions
become corrupted. This is a mutation, and may eventually lead to disease
because the cell is unable to make, for example, a particular enzyme, hormone,
transporter or structural protein.
Chromosomes have a complex structure (Figure 15.1). Each is comprised of
a single double-stranded DNA molecule associated with numerous proteins.

GENETIC DISEASES

In general, chromosomes occur in matching or homologous pairs, with each
member of a pair containing alleles or different forms of the same gene,
which are found at the same loci (singular locus) in each member of the pairs.
Normal human somatic (body) cells contain 23 pairs of chromosomes and
are said to be diploid (2N). The 46 chromosomes in diploid cells comprise
22 homologous pairs of autosomes (nonsex chromosomes) and one pair of
sex chromosomes; XX in females and XY in males (Figure 15.2; see also Figure
1.13). Oocytes and spermatozoa have half the diploid number and are said to
be haploid (N); oocytes can only contain an X chromosome but sperm can
have an X or a Y chromosome.

15.2 GENETICS AND DNA
Genetics, from the Greek genno meaning ‚Äòto give birth‚Äô, is that branch of biology
concerned with heredity, genes and DNA (Figure 15.3), the genetic material.
It is also the scientific study of the variations in inherited characteristics,
often called traits, and how these are transmitted from one generation to the
next. Inherited characteristics include a number of clinical conditions and
diseases that are described in other chapters, for example sickle-cell anemia
and hemophilia (Chapter 13), the muscular dystrophies and cystic fibrosis
(Chapter 16). Others, such as phenylketonuria and Down syndrome, will be
described in this chapter. Genomics is the study of the full complement of
bases in the DNA of an organism.
Genes are the stretches of bases in DNA that carry the code for making
RNA or proteins. The code is contained in sequences of the four nucleotide
bases, adenine, cytosine, guanine and thymine (A, C, G and T, respectively).
DNA normally occurs as the famous double helical molecule (Figure 15.3
(A)) that consists of two long polymers of alternating phosphates and
deoxyribose sugars, linked together by hydrogen bonds between pairs of
complementary bases across the center of the double helix, rather like the
steps of a spiral staircase. Adenine always pairs with T and C always pairs
with G (Figure 15.3 (B)).

DNA REPLICATION AND THE CELL CYCLE

For a gene to be expressed, the nucleotide base code in a gene in the DNA
must be copied or transcribed to form an RNA molecule. The strands of the
double helical DNA separate and one of them, ‚Äòthe gene‚Äô, acts as a template for
the synthesis of a complementary new strand (Figure 15.4 (A)). However, the
new strand is an RNA molecule not DNA. The base pairing rules are similar to
the complementary base pairing in DNA but uridine (U) is used in RNA, not
T and the sugar ribose, not deoxyribose. A number of RNA molecules may be
transcribed from one gene. In some cases, the formation of an RNA molecule
is the major event in gene expression. However, in the vast majority of cases,
the expression of a gene results in the formation of a protein (Figure 15.4 (B)).
In these cases, the RNA formed by transcription is a messenger RNA or mRNA
molecule. However, DNA is transcribed in the nucleus but the synthesis of
proteins takes place in the cytosol. Thus the mRNA molecules are transported
out of the nucleus (Chapter 16) and go to the ribosomes in the cytosol where
their message is translated into a linear sequence of amino acids to make a
protein. Each sequence of three bases in the mRNA codes for the addition
of one specific amino acid to the growing polypeptide chain of the protein;
for example AUG codes for the amino acid methionine, UUU codes for
phenylalanine and so on. Each mRNA molecule may be translated numerous
times so that many molecules of protein are produced.

15.3 DNA REPLICATION AND THE CELL CYCLE
When a cell divides the genetic information must be passed on to the two
daughter cells. The series of biochemical and morphological events that occur
in a population of reproducing cells is called the cell cycle. This results in the
replication of the genetic material (DNA molecules) and division of the cell
into two daughter cells. The replication of DNA involves separating the two
DNA strands of the double helix and aligning new bases according to the usual
pairing rules; A with T and G with C. The new nucleotides are linked together
to form two new strands, each of which is complementary to one of the
original (parental) strands. This action forms two new double-stranded DNA
molecules, each of which consists of one parental strand and one daughter
strand (Figure 15.5) and, for this reason, is often called semiconservative
replication. This is a very simplified account of an extremely complex process,
which is catalyzed by a range of enzymes. This replication is very accurate; it
needs to be because the genetic instructions must be retained from generation
to generation. Most of the few errors that inevitably occur are corrected by
error-detecting enzyme systems in the cell.

i

The timed sequence of events in the
cell cycle is a highly regulated process
controlled by numerous different
proteins. Mutations in the genes
encoding these proteins can perturb
the regulation of the cell cycle and
cells can die or their growth can
become uncontrolled depending on
the nature of mutation. The latter
may lead to malignancies (Chapter
17). A number of chemotherapeutic
drugs act by interfering with the
cell cycle. For example, some
immunosuppressive drugs, such as
aminopterin and cyclophosphamide,
disrupt the synthesis of DNA
during the S phase. Taxol (Figure
15.8 (A) and (B)) is a drug that
interferes with mitosis by preventing
depolymerization of the microtubules
that make up the spindle.

#

The cell cycle is an orderly sequence of events consisting of interphase, the
period between cell divisions, and mitosis (or meiosis if gamete producing
cells are concerned) when the cell divides. Thus interphase, which lasts about
24 h, prepares the cell for division by building up large energy stores and
synthesizing new organelles for the daughter cells; a high metabolic rate is
typical of cells about to undergo division. The cell cycle can be divided into
four main, but continuous, phases that are often drawn as a circle (Figure
15.6). The phases are called G1, S, G2 and M. The G1 (for gap) phase lasts about
8 h during which the cell makes a commitment to divide. It is characterized
by the synthesis of RNA and protein. In the S phase, S for synthesis, the
DNA is replicated in a process lasting approximately 6 h. The G2 phase is a
relatively quiescent period, which typically lasts 4 h, during which organelles
are replicated. Mitosis (or meiosis) occurs in the M phase. Following mitosis,
the cells enter interphase, which lasts until the S phase of the next cycle. Cells
that divide only rarely, for example neurons, are said to be in a stage called
the G0 phase. It is only when they become committed to divide that they are
described as being in the G1 phase of the cycle. Two different types of cell
division are recognized, mitosis and meiosis.

MITOSIS AND MEIOSIS
Mitosis is the type of division that occurs during growth and the renewal of
tissues. The daughter cells produced have the same diploid complement of
chromosomes as the parental cell. Mitosis is a continuous process that lasts
about 1 h. For convenience it is divided into four stages; prophase, metaphase,
anaphase and telophase (Figure 15.7). In interphase the chromosomes occur
as dispersed, thread-like material called chromatin, which cannot be seen
with a light microscope. In prophase the chromosomes begin to condense
to form distinct chromosomes that are visible with microscopy. Since their
DNA has been replicated, each chromosome is present as an identical pair
of chromosomes, although at this stage each member of the pair is referred
to as a sister chromatid, which are joined together by centromeres (Section
15.7). The centrioles, normally located just outside the nuclear envelope,
undergo replication and migrate to opposite poles of the cell. This leads to the
microtubules of the cytoskeleton rearranging to form the spindle, which spans
the cell from one end to the other. The ends of the spindle are known as poles
whereas its middle region is called an equator. During prophase, the cell‚Äôs
nucleolus disappears and prophase concludes with dissipation of the nuclear
envelope. In metaphase, the chromosomes migrate to the center of the cell
and are arranged around the equator of the spindle, where the centromere of
each chromosome (paired chromatids) becomes attached to spindle fibers.
The chromatids are drawn apart at the centromere region towards opposite

poles of the spindle. During anaphase, the chromatids of each chromosome
are pulled apart and each chromatid moves towards the poles of the spindles
reaching the ends by telophase. In telophase, the cell undergoes division to
two daughter cells by the plasma membrane constricting and cutting across
the spindle equator. The spindle breaks down and nuclear envelopes form
around each separated grouped of chromatids, now called chromosomes. The
nucleoli also become apparent in the new nuclei and the chromosomes return
to the nonvisible forms typical of cells in interphase. Hence the parental cell
has divided to form two daughter cells that are genetically identical to the
parent.

Telophase

Meiosis occurs prior to reproduction during the formation of gametes
(Chapter 7). The parental cell has a diploid number of chromosomes, whereas
the daughter cells are now gametes with the corresponding haploid number
of chromosomes. During meiosis, the number of chromosomes is halved and
the daughter cells receive only one of each type of chromosome and, for this
reason, meiosis is sometimes called reduction division.
Meiosis may be thought of as consisting of two separate divisions (Figure
15.9). In the first meiotic division (prophase I through to telophase I) the
parent cell divides into two cells each of which receives one of each pair of
homologous chromosomes. Each of these chromosomes consists of two
chromatids. The second meiotic division (prophase II through to telophase II)
results in each chromosome being separated into chromatids, with the result
that four daughter cells each with a haploid chromosome complement are
formed. In prophase I, the chromosomes contract and the nucleolus shrinks
in size. Homologous chromosomes lie side by side in pairs, a situation called
synapsis. Each member of the pair is bivalent. It is at this stage that genetic
recombination or crossing over occurs. While they are paired, the nonsister
chromatids, that is one maternal and one paternal chromatid, of a homologous
pair are broken at equivalent positions and exchange homologous pieces of
material (Figure 15.9). The crossed strands of the chromatids formed during
recombination are called chiasmata (singular chiasma). Recombination

results in each chromatid acquiring genes or parts of genes from the other
and the process leads to the formation of new combinations of genes or
parts of genes in chromosomes. Eventually recombinant gametes are formed
that differ from their paternal cells in their gene content. Thus crossing over
promotes genetic variation.
During metaphase I, the homologous chromosomes or bivalents move to
the equator of the spindle. The sister chromatids orientate towards the same
pole whereas the homologous chromosomes orientate themselves towards
opposite poles. During anaphase I, the homologous chromosomes, each of
course consisting of a pair of chromatids, migrate towards opposite poles
of the cell. During telophase I, the cell divides as in mitosis to give rise to
two daughter cells whose chromosomes each consist of paired chromatids.
Following a brief interphase, these cells enter the second meiotic division.
In prophase II, the two daughter cells essentially prepare for the second
division with formation of a new spindle. In metaphase II, the chromosomes
move to the equator of the spindle and the chromatids arrange themselves
towards opposite poles and in anaphase II, the chromatids separate from
each other and move to opposite poles of the cell. Finally, in telophase II, each
cell divides into two daughter cells but these have only the haploid number
of chromosomes. Thus the diploid parental cell has produced four haploid
daughter cells (sperm or ova (Chapter 7)).
Failure of chromosomes to separate at metaphase in mitosis or either of the
metaphases in meiosis is called nondisjunction. Nondisjunction can have
serious clinical consequences as explained in Section 15.9.

15.4 GENOTYPE AND PHENOTYPE
The genetic or hereditary constitution of an individual, which is the whole
complement of genes present, forms the genotype. The term can also be
applied to any particular pair of alleles that an individual possesses at a
specific locus on a chromosome. In contrast, the visible or measurable
characteristics of an individual constitute the phenotype. A phenotype
includes biochemical, physiological, morphological and behavioral
characteristics or, indeed, any observable biological trait that is apparent
throughout life, such as the total physical appearance and constitution
of an individual or any specific trait, such as size, weight or eye color and,
of course, includes characteristics of clinical importance and the presence
of a disease. Some phenotypic traits, for example eye color, are directly
observable but others, such as the blood group of a patient (Chapter 6),
may only become apparent following specific tests. Phenotypic traits do
not necessarily occur merely following the expression of the genotype of
an individual; some, such as the blood groups, are completely determined
by heredity but many others, for example weight and height, result from
interactions between the genotype and the environment.

15.5 INHERITANCE AND MUTATIONS
Genes occur as paired alleles. Each corresponding allele is carried by one of a
pair of homologous chromosomes. If the two alleles are identical, the individual
is homozygous for that gene and, if they differ, the individual is said to be
heterozygous. In the heterozygous state, one allele may be dominant over
the other which is therefore recessive. In this situation, only the characteristic
encoded by the dominant trait will be expressed, as would also be the case if
the individual was homozygous for both dominant alleles. The recessive trait
will only become apparent in a homozygous recessive individual.

Dominant genes are conventionally written as an upper case italic letter, for
example G, while its recessive counterpart is given the lower case form, g.
Figure15.10 (A) illustrates the normal inheritance pattern first established by
Mendel (1822‚Äì1884). If one parent is homozygous for an autosomal dominant
gene (GG) and the other parent is homozygous for the recessive form (gg),
then all the offspring will be genetically heterozygous (Gg) and phenotypically
will express the dominant trait. If both parents are heterozygotes (Figure
15.10 (B)), then 25% of offspring will be homozygous for the dominant gene
(GG), 25% homozygous for the recessive gene (gg) and the remaining 50% of
offspring will be heterozygous (Gg).

Margin Note 15.2 The human
genome

i

The genome is the complete sequence
of bases in the DNA molecules,
which is all of the hereditary material
possessed by an individual. The
human haploid genome contains
about 3 000 000 000 pairs of
nucleotides. The total length of this
DNA is about a meter and is divided
into 23 individual molecules; 22 of
which are found in the autosomes
and one in the sex chromosome.
Mitochondrial DNA contains 37
genes.

Mutations are changes that occur in the genome and can give rise to clinical
disorders (Margin Note 15.2). Mutations include changes within single genes
and changes to whole chromosomes. They may be simple substitutions of one
nucleotide for another (point mutations), involve the insertion or deletion
of one or more nucleotides within the normal sequence of DNA within a
chromosome or even alter the structures of individual chromosomes or the
number of chromosomes present. When considering the effects of mutations,
it is important to distinguish between a genetic change which occurs in somatic
cells and one occurring in gametes. Mutations arising in somatic cells will not
be transmitted to future generations although they may represent the first step
in the development of cancer (Chapter 17). In somatic cells, mutations that
produce a recessive autosomal allele are unlikely to have clinical consequences
because their expression is masked by the corresponding dominant allele.
However, somatic mutations that are dominant or X-linked (see below) can
have a greater impact because they are likely to be expressed. Similarly, their
impact is greater if they arise early in development before undifferentiated
cells give rise to differentiated tissues or organs. In adult tissues, the activities
of many nonmutant cells often mask mutations in a few other cells. Mutations
in gametes or gamete forming tissues are part of the germ line (Chapter 17)
and are of greater clinical concern because as well as affecting that individual,
they will also be transmitted to offspring.
Dominant autosomal mutations M will be expressed phenotypically in both the
homozygous and heterozygous condition. However, if the mutation is recessive
(m) then it is not likely to affect an individual unless both chromosomes carry

INHERITANCE AND MUTATIONS

the same mutation. The inheritance patterns shown by dominant/recessive
alleles that are associated with a clinical condition follow the Mendelian rules
explained above. If only a single member of a homologous pair of chromosomes
carries the mutation, it can, however, be passed on to the next generation and
the parent is described as a carrier (Figure 15.11 (A) and (B)). If one parent is
homozygous for the normal gene (MM) and the other parent heterozygous for
the mutated allele (Mm) then 50% of the offspring will be homozygous for the
normal gene (MM) and the other 50% heterozygous (Mm) and carriers. None
of the children will be affected. If both parents are heterozygotes (Mm) then
25% of offspring will be dominant homozygotes (MM), 50% of offspring will
be heterozygotes and carriers (Mm) but the remaining 25% will be recessive
homozygotes (mm) and express the condition (Figure 15.11 (B)).

Figure 15.11 The inheritance patterns shown for a recessive allele of a gene between (A) dominant homozygous
and heterozygous parents and (B) two heterozygous parents.

Heterozygosity means that autosomal recessive mutations, even one resulting
in a lethal allele, may go unnoticed and be maintained in the population for
many generations, until the resultant allele has become widespread in the
population. The new allele will become evident only when a chance mating
brings two copies of it together in the homozygous condition.

SEX-LINKED GENETIC DISEASES
A number of genetic diseases are caused by defective alleles of genes of the
sex (X and Y) chromosomes. The X chromosome contains many more genes
than the Y, although they do have some genes in common, thus any defective
(mutated) gene on the X chromosome is likely to be expressed in males
(XY) but be masked in females (XX). Genetic diseases associated with the
X chromosome are commonest and they are often referred to as X- or sexlinked genetic conditions. X-linked diseases can be recessive or dominant,
although the former, for example hemophilia described in Chapter 13, are
the better known (Table 15.1). Given that females have two X chromosomes
but males only one together with a Y chromosome, then the expression of
sex-linked genes differs between females and males because many genes
on the Y chromosome lack a corresponding allele on the X chromosome.
Thus X-linked recessive genes are only expressed in females if there are two
copies of the gene; one on each of the X chromosomes. However, for males,

there only needs to be one copy of a defective (mutated) X-linked recessive
gene for the disorder to be expressed. For example, if a woman carried a
mutated recessive gene on one of the X chromosomes (Figure 15.12) then
statistically, 50% of her sons would inherit the defective gene and show the
disorder; however, 50% of her sons would not receive the gene and would
not express the condition. Similarly, half of her daughters would not receive
the gene and therefore would be unable to pass it to future generations. The
other half would receive the defective gene and be able to transmit it to the
next generation. Like their mother, they are asymptomatic carriers of the
disorder.
A common recessive X-linked condition only expressed in males is red‚Äì
green color blindness. This is an inability to distinguish between red and
green colors although visual acuity (keenness of vision) is normal. It is not
associated with any serious complications but affected individuals may not
be considered for some occupations that involve transport or the armed
forces, where the ability to distinguish colors is essential. The defective gene
is located on the X chromosome and males are 16 times more likely to be
affected than females. Its prevalence in males is about 10%.

15.6 INHERITED GENE DISORDERS
Most inherited diseases are due to mutations in genes in the nuclear
chromosomes although they can also occur as a result of mutations in
mitochondrial genes as described in Chapter 16. The mutation of a single
gene may lead to the absence or modification of a specific protein, for
example, the abnormal hemoglobin in sickle cell anemia (Chapter 13). In
some cases, the inherited disorder may result in defective receptor synthesis,
such as in familial hypercholesterolemia (Chapter 14) where there is a defect
in low density lipoprotein (LDL) receptors, or in defective carrier proteins,
such as in cystinuria where renal reabsorption of cystine (formed by the
oxidation of two cysteines) is impaired. If the defective or absent protein
is an enzyme the result is a metabolic disorder. Most inherited metabolic
disorders are autosomal recessive diseases, that is, symptoms are only seen
in the homozygous condition and heterozygotes are phenotypically normal
because sufficient amounts of the protein are produced. Nevertheless
a number of these conditions have an autosomal dominant mode of
inheritance and consequently heterozygotes are affected. Examples of
these include porphyrias (Chapter 13) and familial hypercholesterolemia
(Chapter 14).

BOX 15.1 Spongiform encephalopathies or prion diseases
The spongiform encephalopathies (SEs) or prion diseases (Table
15.2) are a rather peculiar group of diseases that can be inherited
although this is not their usual method of transmission. It was
noted in Chapter 2 that these are infectious diseases but also
have a low sporadic occurrence of about one in a million for CJD.
However, they are unusual in that they can also be familial, that
is they are also inherited (genetic) diseases. Irrespective of cause,
these diseases generally develop slowly over 10 to 20 years in
older individuals and are characterized by the presence of holes
or plaques in brain tissue that can only be observed postmortem,
giving it a spongy appearance (Figure 15.13), hence the name
spongiform. There are no cures for these diseases and all are
fatal. Variant CJD, which Ô¨Årst appeared in the UK in the 1980s,
differs from ‚Äòconventional‚Äô CJD in that it occurs in younger people
Name of disease

and death occurs relatively rapidly within about 2 years following
the Ô¨Årst appearance of symptoms.
Prions are proteins that are normally found in a predominantly A
helical conformation, the native form. However, these molecules
can change shape to a form with an increased B sheet content
that is a pathological conformation (Figure 15.14). In a poorly
understood manner, the B sheet-rich prion protein somehow
induces conformational changes in native A helical-rich
molecules to change them to the B type conformation. These
newly misfolded molecules can, in turn, stimulate conformational
changes in other molecules in a chain reaction that deposits
aggregates of prions in the brain leading to the destruction of
neurons and Ô¨Ånally the lethal spongiform condition. Thus SEs are
a subdivision of a group of diseases called protein conformational
diseases.
The sporadic forms of these diseases occur in individuals with
point mutations in the gene that encodes the prion protein.
These mutations alter the sequence of amino acid residues in the
prion protein molecules and predispose them to misfold to the
B sheet-rich, pathological form. Different mutations in the gene
are associated with different SEs (Table 15.3). The mutations
are, of course, heritable but since the symptoms of the diseases
usually only become apparent after reproductive life is over, they
can run in families producing the familial forms of the disease.

clinical features are a consequence of the enzyme deficiency. Figure 15.15
shows how this may occur. Symptoms arise from a lack of product D if this is
an essential substance and alternative pathways for its synthesis do not exist.
Moreover, an accumulation of precursor C will occur if the enzyme is absent
and may produce clinical features if the substrate is toxic when it accumulates.
Intermediates of the pathway may also accumulate especially since there will
be no negative feedback effect as the final product of the pathway is absent
and cannot inhibit the first enzyme of the pathway. Finally, accumulation of a
product of a minor pathway, E, may occur and if this is toxic in excess it may
produce clinical features.
The treatment of inherited metabolic disorders aims at trying to prevent
the accumulation of precursor(s) and provide the necessary product of the
pathway. The removal of toxic products of any minor pathways may also be
necessary. Future strategies are aimed at replacing the deficient enzyme or
correcting the defective gene by gene therapy. Many inherited metabolic
disorders caused by a deficiency of an enzyme are known (Table 15.4); one of
the most thoroughly documented is phenylketonuria.

Phenylketonuria (PKU) is the commonest disorder of amino acid metabolism.
It has an autosomal recessive mode of inheritance, which leads to a deficiency,
mostly in the liver, of phenylalanine hydroxylase (Figure 15.16), which catalyzes
the hydroxylation of phenylalanine to tyrosine (Figure 15.17). Tyrosine is
required for the synthesis of proteins, the pigment melanin, thyroxine and the
catecholamine hormones (Chapter 7). However, if the enzyme is absent, then
phenylalanine and its metabolites accumulate and are toxic to the developing
brain. The manner in which damage occurs is not completely understood but
it is believed that hyperphenylalaninemia interferes with brain amino acid
metabolism and inhibits the release of neurotransmitters. There is also an
increase in the level of phenylpyruvic acid, a phenylketone, which is normally
a minor metabolite of phenylalanine (Figure 15.17). Excess phenylpyruvic
acid is excreted in urine, hence the name phenylketonuria. The incidence of
PKU is one in 10 000 in the UK; in other countries it varies from one in 5000 to
one in 20 000 births.
The clinical features of PKU are absent at birth but develop within a few days
if the newborn is untreated. These signs include a characteristic mousy odor,
irritability, poor feeding, vomiting, eczema, mental retardation, as well as a
pale skin, fair hair and blue eyes due to decreased melanin synthesis. The most
serious of these features is irreversible mental retardation which develops
within three to six months following birth. A diagnosis of PKU is made on the

demonstration of a concentration of phenylalanine in the serum in excess of
0.7 mmol dm‚Äì3, compared with the reference range value of less than 0.1 mmol
dm‚Äì3. Clinical determinations are performed a few days following birth since
it is vital to begin any treatments as soon as possible. The management of
PKU involves restricting the dietary intake of phenylalanine so that the serum
phenylalanine concentration does not exceed the limits shown in Table 15.5.
In the early stages of life, when the brain is developing rapidly, strict control
of phenylalanine concentrations must be imposed to prevent brain damage.
Commercially prepared diets with a low phenylalanine content are available.
The concentration of this amino acid is low but cannot be zero since
phenylalanine is an essential amino acid (Chapter 10) and some must be
provided in the diet to support protein synthesis. Tyrosine is not an essential
amino acid unless phenylalanine intake is limited. Therefore adequate
quantities of tyrosine must also be provided in the diet of PKU patients.
Regular monitoring of treatment is advisable. Blood is collected as a dried spot
or as liquid plasma for laboratory analysis. The diet can become somewhat
less rigorous after the age of 10, although many clinicians now believe that
dietary restriction should be continued throughout life.

Children who have been diagnosed shortly after birth and properly treated
by dietary management develop normally. Early treatment is crucial because
the IQ of an affected individual rarely exceeds 70 and brain damage caused by
untreated PKU is irreversible. Strict dietary control is also necessary in pregnant
women who have PKU, since maternal hyperphenylalaninemia can affect the
fetus in utero, even if the fetus itself does not have PKU. Mental retardation and
congenital abnormalities can occur in a large proportion of these infants.

GENETIC DISEASES

NATIONAL SCREENING PROGRAMS FOR INHERITED DISEASES
A number of factors need to be considered before a screening program
(Chapter 1) for any inherited disease is instituted. These include:
N

does the disease have a relatively high incidence;

N

can the disease be detected within days of birth;

N

can the disease be identified by a biochemical marker that is easily measured;

N

will there be a failure in diagnosing the disease early and would this cause
irreversible damage to the baby;

N

can the disease be treated and will the result of any screening test be
available before irreversible damage to the baby occurs?

Thus, for example, neonatal screening programs for PKU are well established
in practically all the countries of the developed world, including the UK.
Any screening program has to be cost effective. Screening for PKU involves
collecting a specimen of capillary blood from the baby at 6 to 10 days
after birth, which allows for sufficient time for feeding and protein intake
to become established. The test involves determining the concentration
of phenylalanine in the plasma. If the result is indicative of PKU, further
definitive tests are performed. The plasma phenylalanine concentration used
to be determined by the Guthrie test, which involves determining the ability
of plasma to support the growth of the bacterium Bacillus subtilis, which can
only grow if phenylalanine is present in the medium. Nowadays, however,
most laboratories use chromatographic, fluorimetric or mass spectrometric
methods for the estimation of phenylalanine.

15.7 CHROMOSOMES AND THE HUMAN KARYOTYPE
Interphase chromosomes are present as extended structures and cannot be
seen with the light microscope. At the onset of cell division, both mitotic and
meiotic, the chromosomes condense to form compact structures, referred
to as mitotic figures. All chromosomes have a narrowed region called the
centromere that divides the chromosome into two portions and allows them
to be classified as metacentric, submetacentric, acrocentric or telocentric as
shown in Figure 15.18. When the chromosome is divided into two unequal
lengths, the shorter is called the p arm and the longer the q arm. When
stained with Giemsa stain (Figure 15.19), most arms are divided into two
or more regions by prominent bands and each region is further subdivided
into subbands that can be numbered unambiguously. For example, band
Xp21.2 is to be found on the p arm of the X chromosome in region 2, band 1,
subband 2.

CHROMOSOMES AND THE HUMAN KARYOTYPE

A karyotype is the characteristic number, size and shape of chromosomes of a
species. A karyogram is a photographic representation of these chromosomes
stained and arranged in order, as for example in Figures 15.2 and 15.20. An
idiogram is a diagrammatic representation or interpretive drawing of the
chromosomes based on the physical features seen in the karyogram. The
karyotype of normal humans is 46. Human autosomal chromosomes are
divided into seven groups (Table 15.6) on the basis of their sizes and the
positions of their centromeres.

Cytogenetics is the microscopic study of chromosomes. Small lymphocytes
isolated from a blood sample or cells obtained by amniocentesis or chorionic
villus sampling (Section 15.10) are stimulated to divide by treatment with
the plant lectin, phytohemagglutinin (PHA) and mitosis is then arrested at
metaphase by an inhibitor such as colchicine. Metaphase chromosomes are
visible by microscopy when stained in one of several different ways to allow
their accurate identification when examined by microscopy. For routine
karyotyping, Giemsa (G) staining is usually the preferred procedure since
this produces a pattern of alternating dark and light bands characteristic for
each pair of chromosomes. These patterns reflect differences in the detailed

structure of each chromosome. Karyotyping can be performed on white cells
from whole blood as described above or from amniotic fluid, which contains
cells from the developing fetus. When a patient‚Äôs chromosomes are examined
using a microscope, it is possible to identify aberrations in chromosome
number and structure.
The phenotype of a patient with a chromosomal disorder depends on the
nature of their chromosomal defect. The first human chromosomal disorder
was discovered in 1959 when three copies of chromosome 21 were found
to be associated with Down syndrome (Section 15.9). The development of
chromosomal banding in 1970 has markedly increased the ability to resolve
small chromosomal aberrations.

FRAGILE SITES
When human cells are grown in culture, some of the chromosomes in cells
derived from certain individuals fail to stain in particular regions, giving the
appearance of a gap. These sites are known as fragile sites, since they are
susceptible to breakage when the cells are cultured in the absence of certain
chemicals such as folic acid, which is normally present in the culture medium.
More than 80 such sites have been identified since they were first discovered
in 1965. The cause of the fragility at these sites is not known with certainty
but they may represent regions where the DNA has been incompletely
replicated.

Figure 15.21 Schematic of a human X
chromosome with a fragile site (arrowed).

Almost all studies on fragile sites have been carried out in vitro on cells halted
in mitosis. Initially they were not considered to be clinically relevant and,
indeed, most fragile sites do not appear to be associated with any clinical
syndrome. However, a strong association has been shown to exist between
a form of mental retardation called fragile X or Martin-Bell syndrome and a
fragile site on the X chromosome at position Xq27.3 (Figure 15.21) associated
with the FMR1 gene. It is a dominant trait but fortunately fails to be fully
expressed (incomplete penetrance) in many individuals. However, it is the
commonest cause of mental retardation and has been estimated to affect one
in about 4100 males in the UK. Most suffer mental retardation to the point
that they are unable to live an independent life, and have a distinct physical
appearance, including long, narrow faces with protruding chins, enlarged
ears, and increased testicular size particularly after puberty. The syndrome
also affects about one in 8000 females, who tend to suffer milder forms of
retardation. Most humans carry a stable version of FMR1 which has about 30
CGG repeats (Box 15.2). Individuals who have genes with about 45 to about
55 CGG repeats are in a gray zone; they do not have fragile X syndrome and,
while they are likely to pass on a stable gene to their children, they have an
increased chance of having children with a larger number of CGG repeats.
People with about 55 to about 200 are said to have a premutation since
although they generally have few or lack symptoms of fragile X syndrome, they
can have children with more than 200 CGG repeats. This is the full mutation
that initiates inappropriate methylation of cytosine bases and unfortunately
can lead to the full blown syndrome.
The FMR1 gene is carried on the X chromosome and shows Mendelian
patterns of inheritance for X-linked disorders (Figure 15.12), although if it
reaches the premutation stage it has a high probability of mutating (by repeat
amplification) from one generation to the next. However, amplification of
the CGG repeats can only occur in females, not males. Thus although there
may be no family history of fragile X syndrome, it can suddenly appear in a
number of offspring. The patterns of inheritance of fragile X syndrome are
also somewhat complicated compared with a disorder like phenylketonuria,
described in Section 15.6. Given that FMR1 is on the X chromosome, a father
cannot pass on any form of it to male offspring. However, daughters generally

CHROMOSOMES AND THE HUMAN KARYOTYPE

BOX 15.2 Dynamic mutations and DNA methylation
In the early 1990s types of mutation called dynamic or expansion
mutations were identiÔ¨Åed that were associated with a number
of genetic disorders that increased in severity, or had an earlier
onset over several generations. These disorders are referred to as
trinucleotide repeat disorders. Repeating combinations of three
nucleotides occur commonly in DNA molecules. All combinations of triplets, such as CGG, CAG, AGG and ACC, are found
but the Ô¨Årst two are commonest. Such sequences seem to be a
normal part of the DNA and are thought to have regulatory roles
in gene expression. However, if the number of repeats becomes
too large, clinical problems that result in an identiÔ¨Åable disease
are triggered. Fragile X syndrome is one such disease and is associated with an increase in the number of CGG repeats that are
normally found in the FMR1 (fragile X mental retardation 1) gene
at the Xq27.3 fragile site. One consequence of the expansion in
the number of CGG repeats is that methylation of the regulatory
region of the gene occurs and prevents the cell from expressing FMR1 and synthesizing fragile X mental retardation protein
(fmrp), an RNA binding protein that is expressed in the brain. The
lack of fmrp leads to fragile X syndrome. Methylation of DNA is
the addition of methyl (‚ÄìCH3) groups (Chapter 10) to some of its
bases from the donor molecule, S-adenosylmethionine (SAM).
Only a few percent of A and C nucleotides are methylated and
in vertebrate eukaryotic cells only the formation of 5-methylcytosine (Me5C) occurs (Figure 15.22). Methylation at particular
CpG sequences may inhibit transcription and have a role in gene
regulation by switching off the expression of that gene, although
the mechanism by which this occurs is unclear. However, the

methyl group is known to project into the DNA molecule and
interfere with the attachment of DNA binding proteins. The
patterns of methylation are inherited, that is they are repeated
from generation to generation. In general, FMR1 is copied by the
DNA polymerase during DNA replication with high Ô¨Ådelity and
this stable version is almost always inherited. However, in some
circumstances ampliÔ¨Åcation occurs that increases the number
of CGG repeats in the daughter chromosome. This is possible
because repeats containing G and C nucleotides can base pair
with themselves to form hairpin structures (Figure 15.23), which
increases the risk of slipped mispairing occurring during DNA
replication leading to an increase in the number of triplet repeats.
The number of CGG repeats in the FMR1 is the major factor that
determines the presence or absence of fragile X syndrome. In
fragile X syndrome, the mutant FMR1 gene is nonmethylated in
asymptomatic males, methylated in the inactive X chromosome
of females and totally methylated in most fragile X males, which
prevents its expression.

GENETIC DISEASES

receive the paternal type. For example, almost all males with the stable
version generally have daughters with the stable version. However, males with
premutations, who are generally phenotypically normal and called normal
transmitting males, have premutation type daughters. This inheritance can
have severe consequences for any male grandchild as explained below. Most
full mutation males do not have children. Those few who do would give the
full mutated version to their daughters but surprisingly the daughters only
express the premutation. Hence the father is passing on a reduced number of
CGG repeats presumably because there are protected cells in the testes that
never expand to the full mutation or a reduction in the repeat number occurs
in some male reproductive cells. This means that all females who do have
the full mutation must have received it from their mothers since they cannot
receive it from their fathers.
Females have two X chromosomes and every child, male or female, has an
equal, random chance of receiving one or the other of them. A female who
has a copy of the premutation from her normal transmitting father can pass
it on to her children. Most daughters who receive the premutation will show
an increase in repeat number compared with their mother and, while most
will show only the premutation, others will express the full mutation. Sons
who inherit an X chromosome from a mother carrying a premutation are
the principal group affected by fragile X syndrome since they are much more
likely than females to have amplification to the full mutation. The probability
of the full mutation is dependent upon the mother; those at the lower end of
the premutation range, about 56‚Äì70 repeats, are less likely to have a son with
the full mutation than those at the higher end with more than 100 repeats.
All males with the full mutation will experience significant symptoms. Some
females with the full mutation will have symptoms of fragile X but, in general,
the severity is less. Finally, there are individuals who cannot be assigned to
these categories but have cells that vary regarding repeat size or the extent
of methylation (Box 15.2). The severity of their symptoms depends on the
proportion of cells affected and the tissues involved.
The phenomenon of trinucleotide repeats is seen in several other human
disorders. For example, a fragile site on chromosome 3 containing the gene
FHIT (fragile histidine triad) is often altered in cells from tumors of patients
with lung cancer (Chapter 17). Huntington disease, myotonic dystrophy and
spinobulbar muscular atrophy or Kennedy disease are also associated with
trinucleotide amplifications, although they differ from fragile X syndrome
in that the amplification can occur in both sexes at each generation and is
not associated with chromosome fragility. However, they are similar in that
a threshold number of triplet repeats must be exceeded before symptoms of
the disease appear.

15.8 CHROMOSOMAL MUTATIONS OR ABERRATIONS
Chromosomal mutations include structural changes within a single
chromosome or changes in the number of chromosomes present. Structural
mutations occur when chromosomes break and, although in general repair
mechanisms rejoin the two ends to restore rapidly the original structure, if
more than one break occurs, the repair mechanisms are unable to distinguish
between the broken ends and portions of different chromosomes may be
joined together. This can lead to one of four major types of chromosomal
structural aberration or mutation. In deletions, a section of the DNA is lost;
in duplications, one or more extra copies of a segment of DNA occur in a
chromosome; in inversions, there is a reversal of direction of a portion of the
DNA in the chromosome and in translocations, segments of the DNA are

)('

CHROMOSOMAL MUTATIONS OR ABERRATIONS

moved to a different chromosome. Deletions and duplications change the
amount of DNA in a chromosome. Inversions and translocations change the
arrangement of bases in a length of DNA but do not change the amount of
DNA present in the chromosome.
If the exchange of chromosomal material during a translocation and inversion
does not involve breaks within a gene or alter the amount of DNA, then the
individual will be clinically normal and is said to have a balanced translocation.
However, if the structural alteration occurs in the gonads, even a balanced
translocation has clinical significance for future generations since it may lead
to offspring who are chromosomally unbalanced, that is, who have lost DNA
(Figure 15.24). Since most fetuses with unbalanced translocations tend to be
spontaneously aborted, people with balanced translocations may only attract
clinical attention if they and their partner are investigated because of a history
of miscarriages. Infants with unbalanced translocations that do survive are
mentally retarded and show multiple dysmorphic features, that is alterations
(abnormalities) to the accepted appearance. Specific disorders can also occur
when discrete genes are damaged at the translocation fractures, the resulting
disorder being dependent on which genes are damaged.

recombination did not occur during meiosis. See text for details.

DELETIONS
Deletion of part of a chromosome can arise between two breakpoints as a
result of unequal crossing over during meiosis (Section 15.3) or as a result of
a parental translocation. Several clinical disorders are caused by deletions. In
many cases, the abnormalities only occur in individuals who are heterozygous
since the homozygous condition is lethal, especially if the deleted portion
of the chromosome is large. However, any chromosomal deletion that can

be observed microscopically almost invariably produces a phenotype with
multiple abnormal features and mental retardation because of the absence
of expression of the deleted genes. For example, cri-du-chat syndrome is a
heterozygous condition that occurs in about one in 50 000 births. Infants with
this syndrome show anatomical malformations including gastrointestinal and
cardiac complications and are often mentally retarded. The glottis and larynx
also develop abnormally giving the characteristic cry, similar to the meowing
of a cat, which names the syndrome. Cri-du-chat syndrome is caused by a
deletion of part of the short arm of chromosome 5 (46,5p-, Figure 15.25). The
length of the deleted portion varies; the longer the deletion the more defective
the syndrome in surviving children. The effects of the syndrome are severe,
although individuals who receive good home care and early special schooling
can walk and communicate verbally and develop self-care skills.
Prader-Willi syndrome (frequency one in 10 000 to 25 000) and Angelman
syndrome (exact frequency unknown) both result from the ‚Äòmicrodeletion‚Äô
of the band 15q11‚Äì13 although they have different phenotypes depending
upon the parental origin of the deletion. In Prader-Willi syndrome the
deletion occurs invariably on the chromosome 15 inherited from the father
whereas in Angelman syndrome the deletion occurs almost exclusively on
the chromosome 15 from the mother. Hence inheritance of paternal and
maternal copies of this region of chromosome 15 is important for normal
development, a phenomenon known as genetic imprinting. People with
Prader-Willi syndrome are mentally retarded, have small external genitalia and
characteristic facial features. Babies with Prader-Willi syndrome have a poor
sucking reflex hence feeding is difficult and results in weakness and stunted
growth. Strangely, children with Prader-Willi syndrome become compulsive
eaters at five to six years of age and suffer obesity and its related health problems
(Chapter 10). If untreated, afflicted individuals may feed themselves to death.
Angelman syndrome is characterized by developmental delay, absence
of speech, jerky movements, paroxysms of inappropriate laughter and
characteristic facial features which differ from those of Prader-Willi
syndrome.
Many other portions of the genome are also subject to genetic imprinting
although the precise mechanisms controlling whether the paternal or
maternal copies of a gene are expressed are not fully understood.

DUPLICATIONS

Normal Tandem Reverse Terminal

possible types of chromosomal duplications.

)()

Chromosomal mutations that result in the doubling of a part of a chromosome
are called duplications. The size of the duplicated segment varies enormously
and duplicated segments may occur in a tandem configuration, that is,
adjacent to each other or in different locations in the genome (Figure 15.26).
Duplications can result in gene redundancy and may produce phenotypic
variation, since there are now two copies of the gene and one copy may
mutate independently of the other. This is thought to be a significant source
of genetic variability during evolution. For example, gene duplications have
been essential in the evolution of multigene families. These are groups of
several genes whose products are similar in structure or functions. The genes
for globins are a particularly well studied multigene family. Hemoglobins are
tetrameric proteins consisting of two pairs of differing polypeptides each
with an attached heme group able to bind and release a dioxygen molecule.
Human individuals produce different hemoglobins at different stages during
their lives as described in Chapter 13. Each of the globin polypeptides has
slightly different primary structures, but consist of the A types that are found
as a cluster on chromosome 16 and the B types clustered on chromosome
11. It is thought that each group of genes evolved from one original ancestral
gene that underwent duplications and subsequent sequence divergence.

CHROMOSOMAL MUTATIONS OR ABERRATIONS

A)

INVERSIONS
Figure 15.27 illustrates how inversions might arise. A chromosomal loop
forms before fractures occur at two places on the chromosome. The insertion
of the inverted segment at the newly created sticky ends and their subsequent
joining within the chromosome completes the inversion. There are two types
of inversions: paracentric inversions do not include the centromeres whereas
pericentric inversions do. Genetic material is not lost during inversions
although there can be clinical problems when fractures occur within genes or
within regions that control gene expression. The meiotic consequences of a
chromosomal inversion depend on the type of inversion encountered and the
resulting gametes may be nonviable leading to reduced fertility.

B)

TRANSLOCATIONS
Numerous translocations occur in the human population. The simplest
kinds are intrachromosomal translocations that move part of a chromosome
to a different position within the same chromosome. Interchromosomal
translocations transfer part of a chromosome to a nonhomologous
chromosome (Figure 15.28 and Box 15.3). Reciprocal translocation involves an
interchromosomal translocation between two nonhomologous chromosomes.
The least complex way for this event to occur is for two nonhomologous
chromosome arms to come close to each other so that an exchange is
facilitated.

Homologues that are heterozygous for a reciprocal translocation undergo
unorthodox synapsis during meiosis and pairing results in mitotic figures
with a cross-like configuration. These chromosomes produce genetically
unbalanced gametes and often result in reduced fertility. As few as 50% of
the progeny of parents that are heterozygous for a reciprocal translocation
survive, a condition known as semisterility. In humans, translocation can
result in variations from the normal diploid number of chromosomes leading
to a variety of birth defects. Translocations may transfer a gene to a region
of a chromosome that is more transcriptionally active. This can lead to the
development of some forms of cancer (Chapter 17).
A common type of translocation involves breaks at the extreme ends of the
short arms of two nonhomologous acrocentric chromosomes (Figures 15.29
and 15.34). The small fragments produced are lost but the larger ones fuse
together at their centromeric regions. This type of translocation produces a
new, large submetacentric or metacentric chromosome and is often called
a Robertsonian translocation.

GENETIC DISEASES

BOX 15.3 Acute promyelocytic leukemia
The biological functions of vitamin A are varied. In its aldehyde
form, retinal, it participates in vision and, as the acid, retinoic
acid, it controls embryonic development and the development
of skin and other organs, by regulating cell proliferation and differentiation. The naturally occurring and many synthetic forms
of vitamin A produced by pharmaceutical companies are called
retinoids. The main natural retinoids are all-trans-retinoic acid
(ATRA) and its isomer, 9-cis-retinoic acid. They act in similar ways
to steroid hormones (Chapter 7). Retinoids penetrate the plasma
membrane of target cells and interact with intracellular receptor
proteins. The retinoid‚Äìreceptor complexes are translocated to
the nucleus where they interact with speciÔ¨Åc sections of DNA,
leading to changes in gene expression, in other words, genes
are turned on or off (Figure 15.30 (A) and (B)). There are two
types of intracellular receptors for retinoids. One is called RAR,
for retinoic acid receptor, and interacts with ATRA. The other
receptor is called RXR because originally the retinoid which it
recognized was unknown. However, it was subsequently found
to interact with the 9-cis isomer. These receptors must be present
in the cytosol of the cell if retinoids are to exert their inÔ¨Çuence
on gene transcription.
Leukemia is a tumor that originates in the bone marrow and
results in the overproduction of immature leukocytes (Chapter
17). Several types of leukemia have been linked with chromosomal disorders, including acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL).
In APL there are abnormal hypergranular promyelocytes or immature granulocytes (Chapter 13) and the bleeding disorder called

disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), which is thought
to be linked to procoagulant phospholipids present in the leukemic cells. Patients may present with severe bleeding and this
tends to worsen when treatment is started as the leukemic cells
break down and consume large amounts of clotting factors and
platelets. Eventually it was discovered that the defect in APL was
a chromosomal translocation between parts of the long arms
of chromosomes 15 and 17. The translocation is balanced and
reciprocal and results is one abnormally long chromosome 15
(15q+) and one abnormally short chromosome 17 (17q‚Äì). This
is clinically signiÔ¨Åcant because of effects on the PML gene located
on chromosome 15 that encodes the so-called PML protein and
the RAR gene located on chromosome 17. The net result of the
translocation is that a PML-RAR fusion protein is formed. This
protein interferes with the normal function of PML as a growth
suppressor and with that of RAR which is involved in myeloid
differentiation to produce different types of blood cells from progenitor cells in the bone marrow.
In the early 1990s it was found that ATRA treatment was
beneÔ¨Åcial to patients with APL, although at the time the
reason for this was not understood. It is now known that ATRA
inÔ¨Çuences the genes affected by the chromosomal translocation
involving chromosomes 15 and 17 as described above. Treatment
with ATRA produces remission of the leukemia by promoting
the conversion of leukemic blast cells into mature leukocytes.
Unfortunately the remission does not usually last and normally
needs to be consolidated with conventional chemotherapy.

VARIATIONS IN CHROMOSOME NUMBERS

15.9 VARIATIONS IN CHROMOSOME NUMBERS
Eukaryotic organisms are normally diploid and produce haploid gametes
(Section 15.3). However, chromosomal mutations with numerical aberrations
in the number of chromosomes present occur. These can be divided into two
major types. Aneuploidy occurs when the number of chromosomes differs
in having more or fewer than an exact multiple of the haploid number of
chromosomes. Table 15.7 lists a number of human aneuploid abnormalities
of autosomes and sex chromosomes. In contrast, euploidy is the presence of
an exact multiple of the haploid number of chromosomes.

ANEUPLOIDY
Aneuploidy is usually caused by the nondisjunction of paired chromosomes
at meiosis I or of sister chromatids at meiosis II or by delayed movement of a
chromosome at anaphase. Nondisjunction is caused by the failure of pairs of
homologues to separate or disjoin during segregation. Figure 15.31 (A) and (B)
illustrates the consequences of nondisjunction during first meiosis and second
meiosis for a single chromosome. Thus gametes are formed that either lack
the chromosome or contain two copies of it. If these are fertilized by a normal
haploid gamete, then zygotes are produced with one or three chromosomes.
Thus nondisjunction can lead to a variety of aneuploid conditions.
The loss of a single chromosome from an otherwise diploid genome is
called monosomy (2N ‚Äì 1). Nullisomy results from the loss of one pair of
homologous chromosomes (2N ‚Äì 2). The gain of one chromosome results in
trisomy (2N + 1). Tetrasomy describes the presence of four copies of a specific
chromosome rather than the normal two (2N + 2). Aneuploidy can also involve
the loss or the addition of more than one particular chromosome or pair of
chromosomes. Thus a double monosomy involves the loss of two separate
nonhomologous chromosomes (2N ‚Äì 1 ‚Äì 1), while a double tetrasomy would
describe the presence of four copies of two chromosomes (2N + 2 + 2). Both

GENETIC DISEASES

Monosomy results in two types of haploid gametes, N and N ‚Äì 1. Also, the
single unpaired chromosome in the 2N ‚Äì 1 cell is easily lost during meiosis
resulting in the formation of two gametes with N ‚Äì 1 chromosomes. Other
types of aneuploidy also have serious, often lethal consequences in humans.
Approximately 90% of all chromosomal aberrations lead to a termination of
pregnancy in a spontaneous abortion.
Autosomal monosomy is rare since monosomic embryos do not develop
significantly and are usually lost early in pregnancy although the abnormalities
can be detected in aborted fetuses. The extra chromosome in trisomy
produces individuals who are likely to have more chance of being viable
provided that the chromosome involved is relatively small. The addition of a
large autosomal chromosome has severe effects and is usually lethal during
development. Autosomal trisomies are found in about half of the chromosomal
abnormalities that lead to fetal death.
Trisomy-13 (47,13+) produces Patau syndrome (Figure 15.32 (A)) and affects
about one in 5000 live births. The syndrome is characterized by many
abnormalities including mental and physical retardation, cardiac anomalies,
polydactyly, that is extra fingers or toes, cleft lip and palate and small eyes.
Most such babies die before they are three months old.
Trisomy-18 (47,18+) is associated with Edwards syndrome (Figure 15.32 (B))
and occurs in about one in 4000 live births. About 80% of cases of Edwards
syndrome are female. Sufferers are small at birth and have multiple congenital
malformations that affect almost all body systems. Among the many
abnormalities associated with the syndrome are mental and developmental
retardation, elongated skull, low-set malformed ears and clenched fists.
Ninety percent of infants with trisomy-18 die within six months, often from
cardiac problems.
Trisomy-21 (Figure 15.32 (C)) leads to Down syndrome, the only human
autosomal trisomy in which significant numbers of individuals survive more
than a year following birth. It was named after its ‚Äòdiscoverer‚Äô, a doctor called
(Langdon) Down (1828‚Äì1896), in 1866. Affected individuals have common
physical features and affectionate, loving natures. They generally have flat
faces with epicanthic folds over the eyes, round heads with a protruding
furrowed tongue that causes the mouth to remain partially open. They are
below average height and have short, broad hands. Their physical and mental
development is retarded and muscle tone and motor skills are poor. Down
patients are prone to respiratory disease, 50% of them have heart problems
and their incidence of leukemia is approximately 15 times higher than that of
the normal population. Not surprisingly, life expectancy is reduced and few
survive to 50 years of age. Many die of Alzheimer‚Äôs disease (Chapter 18).
Down syndrome affects, on average, one in every 700 live births. However, the
incidence increases with the age of the mother but not that of the father. Figure
15.33 illustrates the relationship between the incidence of Down syndrome
and maternal age, although in terms of gross numbers, most affected children
are born to women under 35 years old since the majority of pregnancies occur
below this age.
The relationship between the age of the mother and the incidence of Down
syndrome is explainable in terms of the production of oocytes (Chapter 7).
Females have a full complement of primary oocytes that developed in the
ovary of the developing female fetus. These oocytes have commenced meiosis
but are arrested at the prophase I before birth. In an adult fertile female, the
nucleus of a secondary oocyte begins the second meiotic division at each
monthly ovulation but progresses only to metaphase II, when division again

W^dad\nd[Y^hZVhZ

stops. The second meiotic division is not completed unless a sperm penetrates
the secondary oocyte. Thus the succeeding ovum has been arrested in meiosis
for about a month longer than the preceding one. Thus older ovulating women
produce ova that are significantly older and have been arrested in meiosis
longer than those of younger women. It is possible that the probability of
nondisjunction increases with the length of time the primary oocyte spends
in the ovary but whether ovum age is the specific cause of the increased
nondisjunction leading to Down syndrome is not yet known.
Over 95% of all cases of Down syndrome are caused by trisomy 21 (Figure
15.32 (C)) following a nondisjunction event during meiosis in one parent,
nearly always the mother. Thus, most people with Down syndrome have 47
chromosomes in all their cells. Approximately 3‚Äì4 % have the normal number
(46) but have a type of Down syndrome that runs in families called familial
Down syndrome, which is the result of a Robertsonian translocation (Section
15.8) that produces three copies of the long arm of chromosome 21 by joining
the long arm of chromosome 21 with the long arm of chromosome 14 or
sometimes 15 (Figure 15.34). The heterozygous carrier is normal because
there are two copies of all major chromosome arms and hence two copies
of all essential genes (Figure 15.34). However, meiosis will result in a 25%
of the gametes formed having two copies of chromosome 21; one normal
chromosome 21 and a copy attached to chromosome 14. When this gamete
is fertilized by a normal haploid gamete, it forms a zygote with the normal 46
chromosomes but with three copies of chromosome 21 (Figure 15.34). These
individuals exhibit Down syndrome.

GENETIC DISEASES

Aneuploidy involving sex chromosomes
Aneuploidy involving sex chromosomes gives rise to a number of well defined
syndromes. These include Turner, Klinefelter and XYY syndromes. A female
born with a single X chromosome (45X0) shows Turner syndrome (Table 15.7).
The incidence is one per 5000 female births although the vast majority of
45X0 aneuploids are spontaneously aborted. The condition may arise from
nondisjunction in either parent but in 75% of cases of Turner syndrome only
the maternal X chromosome is present, implying that the problem originates
in spermatogenesis in the father. Females with Turner syndrome are short in
stature and rarely undergo secondary sexual development and so are mostly
infertile, although their intelligence and life span are normal. A male born with
one or more extra X chromosomes (Table 15.7) exhibits Klinefelter syndrome.
The incidence of 47XXY is one for every 1000 boys born although the risk
increases with an increase in the age of the mother. The extra chromosome
is donated from the mother in 60% and from the father in 40% of cases and
arises by nondisjunction during both maternal and paternal meiotic division.
Affected males have underdeveloped testes and are infertile, are often above
average height and have mild mental retardation. Approximately one in 1000
male children exhibit XYY syndrome, which arises from a nondisjunction of
the Y chromosome. Males with XYY syndrome are above average in height and
may be less fertile.

EUPLOIDY
In monoploidy only a single set of chromosomes (23 in humans) is present,
rather than the normal diploid two (46). Monoploid fetuses do not reach full
term presumably because the recessive lethal mutations, which are usually
counteracted by dominant alleles in heterozygous individuals, are expressed.

Haslam and K.P. O‚ÄôCraft, Tameside General Hospital,
Ashton under Lyne, UK.

In polyploidy, the chromosome number is an exact multiple of the haploid
number but exceeds the diploid number. Organisms with three sets of
chromosomes are triploid (Figure 15.35), those with four sets are tetraploid
and so on. Polyploidy usually arises from fertilization of the egg by two
spermatozoa, which increases the total number of chromosomes to 69, or
from a failure at one of the maturation divisions of the egg or spermatozoon
so that a diploid gamete is produced. Thus if nondisjunction occurs at meiosis
I, 50% of the gametes lack chromosomes and the other 50% have two sets of
chromosomes (Figure 15.36). If nondisjunction occurs at meiosis II, 50% of
the gametes possess the normal single set of chromosomes, 25% have two
sets of chromosomes and 25% lack chromosomes (Figure 15.36). Fusion of a
gamete with two chromosome sets with a normal gamete produces a zygote
with a triploid set of chromosomes (3N). Similarly, fusion of two gametes, each
with two chromosome sets, produces a tetraploid (4N) zygote. Polyploidy of
somatic cells can also occur following the mitotic nondisjunction of complete
chromosome sets.
Polyploidy normally causes an early spontaneous abortion and survival of
the fetus to full term is rare. The commonest type of polyploidy in humans
is triploidy. However, polyploids with an odd number of chromosome sets
always possess an unpaired chromosome for each type, hence the probability
of producing a balanced gamete is low. Indeed, triploidy in humans is always
lethal and is seen in 15‚Äì20% of spontaneous abortions and in only about
one in 10 000 births, where death invariably occurs within a month. Triploid
babies show many abnormalities, including a characteristically enlarged
head. Polyploids with even numbers of sets of chromosomes generally have a
better chance of being at least partially fertile because there is the potential for
homologous chromosomes to be segregated equally during meiosis. However,
tetraploidy is also always lethal in humans and is seen in approximately 5% of
spontaneous abortions. Very rarely, tetraploid humans are born although they
only survive for a short time.

15.10 DETECTING, DIAGNOSING AND SCREENING HUMAN
GENETIC DISEASES
Identifying the genetic basis for a human disorder usually requires an analysis
of the family history as far back as possible. If this shows that the trait is
inherited, it is possible to predict whether the mutant allele is dominant
or recessive and whether it is X- or autosomal-linked. Obviously, dominant
mutations are the simplest to detect. If they are X-linked, then affected fathers
will pass the trait to all their daughters. However, if autosomal, then dominant
mutations would be expected to occur in approximately 50% of the children
of an affected heterozygous individual.
In many cases, the diagnosis of a genetic disease can be made prenatally. The
most widely used methods for this are amniocentesis and chorionic villus
sampling (CVS). In the former, a needle is used to withdraw amniotic fluid
(Figure 15.37 (A)) containing cells genetically identical to those of the fetus. In
CVS, a catheter is inserted into the uterus and a small tissue sample of the fetal
chorion removed (Figure 15.37 (B)). In both cases, a variety of cytogenetic and
biochemical tests can then be performed on the cells and tissue to identify
any single gene disorders or chromosomal abnormalities.
People in whom a genetic defect has been detected will be advised to seek
genetic counseling, especially if they wish to have children. The advice they
are given is based on analyses of the risks that they may produce a child with a
genetic abnormality or that they themselves may develop a late onset genetic
disease. A broad range of information is required and genetic counselors
require training to provide this information with appropriate consideration.

DETECTION OF HEREDITARY DISEASES
Tests based on recombinant DNA technology have increased in recent years
because of their high sensitivity and accuracy in detecting genetic disorders
at the prenatal stage. The detection of hereditary diseases in a given genome
was traditionally a long and laborious task. However, modern techniques of
chromosome and DNA analyses have resulted in a dramatic increase in the
number of tests for genetic diseases with a considerable improvement in
the time required for analysis. For example, using PCR, polymerase chain
reaction (Chapter 3), virtually any portion of a gene or even whole genes
can be amplified for analysis by electrophoretic techniques or sequenced to
detect mutations. This not only allows for diagnosing patients with inherited
disorders but also the detection of mutations in carriers, even though
they do not express any symptom of the disorder. It is also a direct way of
distinguishing different mutations within a single gene, each of which can
lead to disorders, for example muscular dystrophies which are described
in Chapter 16. It is hoped that eventually predictive tests for disorders that
have only some genetic component, such as heart disease and cancers,
will eventually be developed. Indeed, PCR analysis of cells lost in feces has
demonstrated premalignant changes in the gastrointestinal tract and allowed
patients at risk of developing colon cancer to be identified. This is of clinical
importance since the earlier treatments of malignant conditions are started,
the more favorable the prognosis.
Cloned DNA sequences have expanded the range of prenatal testing because
they allow the fetal genotype to be examined directly, rather than relying
on secondary tests for the products of the normal or mutant genes. Thus,
mutations in DNA can be detected in those cases where an aberrant product
cannot be detected prior to birth, even though a test is available. A test for
sickle cell anemia using a restriction enzyme has been described in Chapter
13. However, RFLP analysis requires that the mutation in the gene alters the
restriction sites recognized by restriction endonucleases and this is not always
the case. In contrast, allele-specific oligonucleotides (ASOs) are synthetic
nucleotide probes, which bind only to their complementary DNA. They
will not hybridize to other sequences and, in appropriate highly stringent
conditions, differentially bind to and distinguish between alleles that differ
by as little as one nucleotide. They can thus distinguish between the native
and mutant forms of a gene with excellent resolution and potential versatility.

DETECTING, DIAGNOSING AND SCREENING HUMAN GENETIC DISEASES

BOX 15.4 Prenatal diagnosis for Down syndrome
The Quadruple Test for Down syndrome calculates the risk of
having a Down fetus taking into account the maternal age
at term and four markers, A-fetoprotein (AFP), unconjugated
estriol, total human chorionic gonadotropin, hCG (or more
usually its free B subunit) and inhibin-A at 14 22 weeks, in the
maternal serum. There have been several variations on this test.
In Down syndrome, the A-fetoprotein tends to be low compared with the normal (while in neural tube defects, for example spina biÔ¨Åda, it is high). However, concentrations of hCG
are increased. A screening protocol was proposed in 1998 that
combined maternal serum AFP, the urinary B-core fragment of
hCG (a breakdown product of hCG) and total urine estradiol.
This test is said to be superior to the 75% sensitivity at the 5%
false-positive rate compared with when B-core/estradiol and
maternal age alone are used.
Maternal age is important since birth prevalence of Down syndrome increases 100-fold between the maternal ages of 15 and
50 years. Statistics that relate the risk of bearing a Down syndrome child to the age of the mother (Figure 15.33) raise serious
issues for women who become pregnant later in life. Genetic
counseling may also be useful in informing the parents about
the probability that their child will be affected and in educating
them about Down syndrome. It is important that older pregnant
women consider tests to determine whether the fetus has a normal complement of chromosomes. Amniocentesis or chorionic
villus sampling and the culture of fetal cells will allow its karyotype to be determined.
The deÔ¨Ånitive test for Down syndrome is prenatal cytogenetic
screening, that is karyotyping (Section 15.7), and in the

developed countries this is routinely offered to pregnant women.
It requires either amniocentesis or chorionic villus sampling.
Karyotyping detects a range of numerical and structural
abnormalities in the chromosomes in addition to Down
and other common autosomal trisomies. However, the cells
obtained from amniocentesis or chorionic villus sampling must
be cultured to provided sufÔ¨Åcient biological material and so full
cytogenetic analysis involves a delay of 14 days or longer before
a result can be given. Obviously the earlier a deÔ¨Ånitive positive
result is obtained, the sooner the prospective parents can make
clinically relevant decisions. Therefore ‚Äòmolecular methods‚Äô have
been investigated since these have the potential to give a result
much more rapidly. Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) is a
technique in which Ô¨Çuorescently-labeled DNA probes that will
hybridize to relevant regions of the chromosomes are applied
to cell preparations (Chapter 6). When the preparations are
examined with a Ô¨Çuorescent microscope the presence or absence
of the target regions are revealed. Alternatively, PCR (Chapter 3)
can be used to amplify these regions and the results can be
seen on electrophoresis gels. Both methods can potentially
give a result in 24‚Äì48 h. These molecular methods have been
shown to be accurate since they would have failed to detect
an abnormal karyotype in only about one in 100 amniocentesis
samples. Obviously such tests will only give information about
regions of the chromosomes for which DNA probes are applied.
Many laboratories in the UK now offer FISH or PCR along with
karyotyping, mostly to target pregnancies which are considered
to be at high risk after screening by the Quadruple test. If the
fetus is diagnosed as having Down syndrome, a therapeutic
abortion is an option the parents may consider.

Tests based on ASOs are now available to screen for mutations associated with
cystic fibrosis (Chapter 16) and glaucoma.
Allele-specific oligonucleotides are being increasingly combined with DNA
microarrays, or chips. These are small glass slides or nylon membranes divided
into squares, called fields, each of which contains a specific probe about 20
oligonucleotides long bound to the slide. DNA microarrays can be produced
containing thousands of probes and can thus be used to analyze many
different genes simultaneously. DNA is extracted from the cells and digested
with one or more restriction endonucleases to produce small sized fragments
that are labeled with a fluorescent dye. These are heated to separate the DNA
into single strands which are then added to the microarray. Fragments whose
sequence is complementary to a probe will hybridize with it and bind to the
microarray; others will be washed off even if their complementary sequence
differs from the probe by as little as one base. A laser based device is used
to scan the array and determine where the binding has occurred to identify
specific mutations (Figure 15.38). DNA chips are in development that will
contain probes for all of the approximately 22 000 human genes to allow the
simultaneous analysis of the DNA from a single person for hundreds of genetic
diseases or genetic predispositions. The generation of such data has profound
social, ethical and legal implications.

15.11 SUMMARY
The sequence of nucleotides of the genes in the DNA forms the genetic
blueprint of cells, controlling all the cell‚Äôs activities. This DNA sequence
is transmitted to offspring in the gametes. Alterations in the sequence of
nucleotides or to the chromosomal content of cells, that is, mutations,
can lead to disease and/or death. Mutations may result in absence or
abnormality of a protein, perhaps an enzyme. Chromosomal aberrations
involve structural changes to individual chromosomes, such as deletions,

DISORDERS
OBJECTIVES
After studying this chapter you should be able to:
N

list some clinical conditions that arise from speciÔ¨Åc defects in membranes,
organelles and the cytoskeleton;

N

relate the symptoms of some of these disorders of membranes, organelles
and cytoskeletons to speciÔ¨Åc defects in their structures and activities;

N

discuss the management and treatment of some membrane, organelle and
cytoskeletal disorders.

16.1 INTRODUCTION
Membranes are essential for biological activities. A plasma membrane
surrounds all eukaryotic cells. Individual organelles are also surrounded
by a single and, in some cases, a double membrane or envelope. All these
membranes share a common basic structure but differ in their individual
compositions that are characteristically adapted to the functions of the cell
or organelles in question. Defects in their compositions or structures lead
to clinical problems that in many cases are extremely severe or fatal. The
recent successes of genome sequencing projects have indicated that as many
as 25% of all protein-coding genes may specify the structures of membrane
proteins. The shapes and locomotion of cells depend on a highly organized
arrangement of fibrous proteins called the cytoskeleton. This is also
responsible for the active transport of some materials around the cytoplasm.
This chapter will describe a selected number of diseases or disorders
associated with membranes, organelles and the cytoskeleton. These will
include diseases associated with defects in nucleocytoplasmic transport;
the plasma membrane disorder, cystic fibrosis, and diseases linked to
mitochondria, lysosomes, peroxisomes and some cytoskeletal disorders.
Many other membrane and organelle associated diseases are not included
owing to a lack of space.

MEMBRANE, ORGANELLE AND CYTOSKELETAL DISORDERS

16.2 NUCLEUS AND NUCLEOCYTOPLASMIC TRANSPORT
The nucleus contains the genome of the cell stored as sequences of nucleotide bases in DNA molecules most of which are contained in chromosomes
(Chapter 15). Other than a few mitochondrial genes (Section 10.4), all the
human genes are found here. Surprisingly, it seems that less than 5% of the
three billion pairs of nucleotides constitute the less than 30 000 genes of
humans. The rest of the DNA is found interspersed as introns (Chapter 13) in
between individual genes and as repetitive sequences. The function of these
short sequences is unknown, although telomeres (Chapter 18) stabilize the
ends of chromosomes and centromeres (Chapter 15) allow the spindle to
attach to the chromosomes during cell division.
All cells, with the exception of mature mammalian erythrocytes, possess a
nucleus that contains the chromosomes. The nucleus is separated from the
cytoplasm by a nuclear envelope consisting of outer and inner nuclear membranes (Figure 16.1). Nuclear pores in the envelope (Figure 16.1 (B) and (C))
allow the transport of proteins into the nucleus and the export of ribosomal
subunits, transfer RNA and messenger RNA molecules to the cytoplasm. This
movement between the nucleus and cytoplasm is called nucleocytoplasmic
transport. Nuclear pores have elaborate structures called nuclear pore complexes (NPCs) that regulate nucleocytoplasmic transport. The best studied
NPCs are those from amphibians, such as the toad Xenopus laevis. Each NPC
consists of around 100 proteins and has a Mr of approximately 125 x 106. These
complexes are cylindrical with a ring-like structure of eightfold symmetry containing a central core. Fibrils, 50 to 100 nm long, extend from the cylinder into
the cytoplasm while the inner surface has a basket-like attachment extending into the nucleoplasm. The 5600 pores of a typical mammalian nucleus
are held in place by attachments to the nuclear envelope and to a scaffold of
fibrous proteins called the lamina that lines and supports the inner face of the
nucleus (Figure 16.1(A)).
Nucleocytoplasmic transport is a rather complicated process and only a simplified view of protein import is given here (Figure 16.2). Generally, proteins
with a Mr larger than 30 000 cannot enter the nucleus by free diffusion but they
can enter by active transport if they have a nuclear locating signal (NLS). This
also requires the participation of a number of soluble import factors. The best
known NLSs are rich in basic amino acid residues, such as that of the large T
antigen of the simian virus 40 which has a sequence: Pro-Lys-Lys-Lys-Arg-LysVal. A protein with a NLS is called a cargo. An adapter protein recognizes the
NLS signal of the cargo and binds to it. This complex then binds to an import
receptor (Figure 16.2). Importin @ and importin A are the best characterized
adapter and import receptors respectively. This tripartite complex then passes
through a NPC into the nucleus where it binds to a small protein called Ran.
Ran is a GTPase, which can bind and then hydrolyze GTP to GDP. The conformation of Ran depends upon whether it has a bound GTP or GDP. The
binding of Ran-GTP to the complex releases the cargo-adaptor in the nucleus
and allows the import receptor-Ran-GTP to be shuttled to the cytoplasm. The
adapter now releases its cargo within the nucleoplasm. Within the cytoplasm,
yet another protein, GTPase-accelerating protein (Ran-Gap, not shown in
Figure 16.2 for the sake of clarity) stimulates Ran to hydrolyze its bound GTP.
The conformation of Ran-GDP has only a low affinity for the import receptor,
which is then released and can participate in a new cycle of nuclear import.
The Ran-GDP is returned to the nucleus where it releases its GDP and binds a
fresh GTP under the influence of a specific guanine nucleotide-exchange factor (Ran-GEF). The adapter in the nucleus binds to a nuclear export receptor
that allows it to be returned to the cytoplasm.

PLASMA MEMBRANE DISORDERS

The export of proteins, transfer RNA molecules and ribosomal subunits from
the nucleus to the cytoplasm appears to operate by similar mechanisms to
that described above for nuclear import. The export of mRNA molecules, however, seems to involve an mRNA exporter protein that directs their passage
through the NPCs.

CLINICAL ASPECTS OF NUCLEOCYTOPLASMIC TRANSPORT
Given that NPCs are the pivotal junctions between the cytoplasm and
the nucleus, they are closely involved in the pathology of viral infections
(Chapter 2). Virus particles fuse with the plasma membrane or are taken up
into the cells by endocytosis. However, they must leave the cytoplasm and
enter the nucleus. For example, the hepatitis B virus (HBV) has a capsid of
diameter 32‚Äì36 nm and is small enough to cross the NPC directly. In vivo,
phosphorylation of HBV capsids makes their NLSs accessible to the nuclear
transport machinery. Following their transport through the central pore of
the NPC, capsid protein and DNA from mature viruses are released into the
nucleoplasm. In contrast, adenovirus particles and herpes simplex virus
(HSV) have capsids with diameters of 90 nm and 125 nm respectively that
are too large to traverse the NPC. These virus particles dock at the cytoplasmic side of the NPC in an importin dependent manner. The HSV then
releases its DNA through the NPC into the nucleoplasm. Adenovirus particles, however, first trap a variety of transport factors that are necessary for
the subsequent disassembly of the capsid before the translocation of the
viral DNA into the nucleus is possible.
Malfunctions of nucleocytoplasmic transport are associated with a number of
diseases including Huntington‚Äôs disease (Chapter 15). In Huntington‚Äôs disease,
a single gene is mutated and the corresponding protein, huntingtin, accumulates in the nucleus rather than in the cytoplasm. Nuclear pore complexes
have also been implicated in several autoimmune diseases (Chapter 5) that
are caused by autoantibodies recognizing proteins of the NPCs. This contributes to a number of diverse illnesses, such as systemic lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis and primary biliary cirrhosis. Nucleoporins have
been implicated in several types of cancers (Chapter 17). In some cases, these
are associated with the overexpression of NPC proteins, but in most other
cases tumorigenesis stems from chromosomal rearrangements that result in
oncogenic fusion proteins. Examples include tumors such as acute myeloid
leukemia, adenocarcinoma, chronic myeloid leukemia, inflammatory myofibroblastic tumor, myeloblastic leukemia, osteosarcoma and papillary thyroid carcinomas, which affect a variety of tissues. At least 11 chromosomal
rearrangements in acute leukemia involve genes that encode nuclear pore
proteins; nine of these involve a single protein called nucleoporin 98. Some
studies have suggested that the density of NPCs in aneuploid bladder tumors
that have cells with abnormal numbers of chromosomes is significantly higher
than in normal cells.

16.3 PLASMA MEMBRANE DISORDERS
Numerous clinical conditions are associated with defective receptors of the
plasma membrane and/or subsequent defective signal transduction or defective transport of materials across the membrane. Defects of receptor proteins
and signal transduction can result in the development of cancerous states
(Chapter 17), while cases of type 2 diabetes are associated with an ineffective insulin receptor (Chapter 7). Familial hypercholesterolemia, which was
described in Chapter 14, arises from defective receptors for LDL particles.
The rare Tangier disease mentioned in Chapter 14 is caused by mutations
in the gene for cholesterol transport protein of the plasma membrane. This

protein is one of a group of transporters called ATP-binding cassette (ABC)
proteins. These are multidomain structures: all have two cytosolic ATP-binding domains or cassettes and two transmembrane domains each consisting
of several helices. However, the most studied of the ABC transporters is the
transmembrane conductance regulator protein, which regulates a chloride
channel. Unlike Tangier disease, which is extremely rare, defects with this
transporter lead to the much more common condition, cystic fibrosis.

CYSTIC FIBROSIS
Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a multisystem, inherited disorder characterized by the
secretion of very viscous mucus secretions in the lungs, digestive tract and
associated organs, and epididymis. This results in chronic respiratory disease,
malabsorption, cirrhosis and electrolyte disturbances. The clinical features of
CF are shown in Table 16.1.

Cystic fibrosis is the commonest fatal, homozygous recessive disorder of the
Caucasian population affecting about one in 2000 people in the UK, with
one in 20 Caucasians carrying one copy of the mutated gene. The prevalence
of CF varies throughout the world with certain populations reporting higher
incidences. The onset may be at birth or later in childhood. Cystic fibrosis
is characterized by decreased permeability of the apical membrane of epithelial tissues lining the lungs and other organs to chloride ions (Cl‚Äì) that
results from mutations (Chapter 15) in the CFTR gene that encodes the cystic
fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (Figure 16.3). This protein is a

cyclic AMP-regulated chloride channel and has been identified, cloned and
sequenced and most of its mutations are known. The decreased permeability
results in many exocrine secretions with altered ion and reduced water contents and high viscosities. The appropriate viscosity is essential for normal
functions of lubrication, digestion and protection by proteins secreted at
epithelial surfaces. The highly viscous secretions can cause obstructions in
ducts and lead to an accumulation of mucus and colonization by bacteria.
Considering that CF is essentially a fatal disease, one may wonder why the
mutated genes persist in the population. One theory is that mutations in
CFTR increase resistance to cholera (Chapters 2 and 3). The toxin of Vibrio
cholerae (Figure 16.4) binds to surface receptors on the plasma membranes
of gut enterocytes, leading to a voluminous secretion of fluid and Cl‚Äì resulting in a secretory diarrhea that can be fatal if untreated. Cystic fibrosis mice
that do not express cftr do not secrete fluid in response to cholera toxin.
Heterozygous CF mice that express half the normal amount of cftr protein
secrete about half the normal fluid and Cl‚Äì in response to cholera toxin.
Thus CF heterozygotes might have a selective advantage in being resistant
to cholera.

Diagnosis and treatment of cystic Ô¨Åbrosis
A diagnosis of CF can be confirmed by demonstrating a concentration of Cl‚Äì
in sweat higher than 70 mmol dm‚Äì3. Pilocarpine is first applied topically to
patients to stimulate the flow of sweat, samples of which are then collected
and analyzed for Cl‚Äì.
A number of screening tests for CF are now available based on the effects of
CF on pancreatic function. The most popular of these relies on measurement
of immunoreactive trypsin (IRT) in dried blood spots, similar to those collected for PKU (Chapter 15). Immunoreactive trypsin is greatly increased in
infants with CF in the first month of life compared with that of healthy infants.
However, the test cannot be used after the first few weeks of life since IRT
levels fall as pancreatic insufficiency develops.

The identification of mutations in the CFTR of a cystic fibrosis patient
will confirm the diagnosis and it can also assist with carrier testing of the
relatives of the patient. It is also used to give an accurate and rapid prenatal
diagnosis of CF once the parental genotypes have been confirmed. Currently
there are over 1300 mutations listed in the CFTR mutation database with
the largest number (500) being attributed to missense mutations. When it
is not possible to detect mutant CFTR alleles, then the sweat test remains
the definitive test for diagnosis of CF but, unfortunately, the sweat test is
not always reliable in the first six weeks of life or in adulthood. Furthermore,
some patients with CF, including a number with severe lung disease, give a
normal sweat test.
The techniques for genetic analysis of CF are based on the detection of an
alteration in the DNA sequence of the CTFR gene. In principle, any method
capable of detecting a change in the DNA sequence can be used in mutation
detection. Current techniques rely in one way or another on the hybridization
of two single strands of DNA and on the ability of changes in the sequences
of DNA to alter the kinetics of hybridization. These techniques depend on
the polymerase chain reaction or PCR (Chapter 3) and this, in turn, requires
that the normal sequence of the gene, including its intron‚Äìexon boundaries
(described in Chapter 13) be known, as is the case for CF. Polymerase chain
reaction primers are designed that will bind to adjacent regions of the gene
of interest and allow it to be amplified. In most cases, whole exons are amplified together with a short region of their neighboring intron sequences to give
a PCR product 300 to 500 base pairs long. These products are then analyzed
for specific point mutations or for generalized, nonspecific evidence of a

sequence change. The testing strategy may use both approaches depending
on the purpose of the analysis.
The commonest CF mutation is called $F508. This is the deletion of a codon,
in exon 10 of the CFTR gene, that codes for a phenylalanine (F) residue at
position 508 in the amino acid sequence of the encoded protein. The simplest
way to detect this mutation (Figure 16.5) is by amplifying that part of the gene

portions of normal and mutated genes and a

and looking for differences in the sizes of the PCR products. Polyacrylamide
gel electrophoresis (PAGE) can be used to separate the products of PCR of
the small fragment of exon 10 of the CFTR gene and these may be visualized
with ethidium bromide or silver staining. The primers most often used are
called C16B and C16D and generate a 98bp product of exon 10. However, if
the $F508 mutation is present, the PCR product is only 95bp long. This is a
relatively small difference but careful PAGE can easily separate them. This
test is not absolutely specific for $F508 given that other 3bp deletions in this
region would produce the same difference in size. Thus the mutation $I507,
the second identified CF mutation, also gives a 95bp PCR product. Mutations
other than $F508, however, can be identified in many cases because they
produce differing banding patterns following PAGE.
The treatment for cystic fibrosis is aimed at preventing respiratory infections
by regular physiotherapy to try to remove the mucus, along with the use of antibiotics to counter bacterial infections (Chapter 3). Pancreatic enzymes, in tablet
form, are given with food to counter the effects of pancreatic insufficiency.
Mice with deletions of cftr, that is gene knockout mice, have been bred to
use as experimental models to test possible therapies. However, such mice
do not develop lung disease in the same manner as humans and therefore
do not provide an effective animal model. This has hampered experimental
gene therapy studies that have tried to insert the normal gene into the lung
epithelial cells of CF patients by using DNA-containing liposomes. To date,
none of these therapies have been successful. Cystic fibrosis used to be fatal
by the age of about 20 years but improvements in treatment mean that many
sufferers now live to be 30 years and over. However, although the prognosis for
CF has improved, many patients still die in early adult life.

16.4 MITOCHONDRIAL DISORDERS
Mitochondria are organelles found in almost all eukaryotic cells although
numbers vary from one to several hundred per cell. They are bounded by
a mitochondrial envelope that consists of outer and inner mitochondrial
membranes with infoldings called cristae, and encloses a central region called
the mitochondrial matrix (Figure 16.6). The inner mitochondrial membrane

W^dad\nd[Y^hZVhZ

MITOCHONDRIAL DISORDERS

contains five protein complexes (Table 16.2) that together with cytochrome
c perform the energy transduction reactions with the formation of ATP by
oxidative phosphorylation. The matrix contains enzymes that catabolize fuel
molecules to yield the reduced coenzymes NADH and FADH2 necessary for
oxidative phosphorylation, and produces small organic molecules that are
the precursors in biosynthetic metabolism. The mitochondria also help in
maintaining the intracellular homeostasis of many metabolites and ions,
including Ca2+ and H+.

Mitochondria are also involved in cellular responses to environmental toxins that can stimulate them to release a potent mixture of enzymes and other
proteins that eventually bring about the death of the cell. This is one form of
apoptosis or cell suicide. These apoptotic mechanisms are, of course, under
strict regulation, but defects in these controls cause some neurodegenerative
and autoimmune diseases and some cancers.
Mitochondria are unusual organelles, in that the matrix also contains
molecules of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) containing mitochondrial genes,
in addition to mitochondrial ribosomes and mitochondrial transfer RNA
molecules. Mitochondrial ribosomes differ in size and structure from those
present in the cytosol.
Human mitochondrial DNA is a circular double-stranded molecule of 16 569
base pairs present in multiple copies in each mitochondrion. Human mtDNA
has been completely sequenced and contains only 37 genes (Figure 16.7).
Twenty-eight genes are encoded on one of the strands of the DNA and nine
genes on the other. These genes encode 22 transfer RNAs, the 12S and 16S
mitochondrial ribosomal RNAs, and 13 mitochondrial polypeptides that are
involved in oxidative phosphorylation. Thus, mitochondria have the genetic
information and machinery to synthesize proteins. Mitochondria contain
approximately 1000 different proteins, that is about 3% of all cellular proteins.
It follows that the majority of mitochondrial proteins are encoded by nuclear
genes and are synthesized on ribosomes in the cytosol. These proteins require
transportation across one or both of the mitochondrial membranes to reach
their sites of activity.

CAUSES OF MITOCHONDRIAL DISORDERS
Mitochondrial disorders are a heterogeneous group of disorders resulting
from impairment of the mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation system.

They are associated not only with numerous mutations of the mtDNA
but also mutations in nuclear genes that affect processes such as the
assembly of protein subunits and the import of proteins from the cytosol
into the mitochondrion. Such mutations can affect the morphology of the
mitochondrion (Figure 16.8).
Mitochondria replicate by simple divisions that are independent of mitosis
and meiosis. The mitochondrial chromosomes are copied prior to replication.
However, the replicating enzyme, mtDNA-dependent DNA polymerase or
DNA polymerase F, replicates DNA with much poorer fidelity than the nuclear
DNA polymerases. Thus the mutation rates of mitochondrial genes are estimated to be about 10 times greater than those of nuclear genes. This may
contribute to the aging process (Chapter 18). Furthermore, the mitochondrial
genome resembles that of bacteria in that the genes lack introns and repeated
DNA sequences so that about 93% of the DNA is transcribed as opposed to
the 5% or less for the nuclear genome. Thus, despite its relatively small size,
a relatively large number of mutations are associated with mtDNA and these
mutations are significant contributors to human disease.

Mitochondrial disorders are caused by similar types of mutations to those
that cause diseases associated with the nuclear genome, that is, point mutations, deletions, and duplications (Chapter 15). However, the inheritance
of these diseases differs strikingly to that of the nuclear genetic diseases. In
zygote formation, a spermatozoon contributes its nuclear genome but not its
mitochondrial genome to the egg cell. The resulting fertilized zygote contains
only the mitochondria that were present in the unfertilized egg and are therefore entirely maternal in origin. Thus all children, male and female, inherit
their mitochondria only from their mother, and males cannot transmit their
mitochondria to subsequent generations (Figure 16.9). Thus a typical disease
resulting from a mutation in mtDNA is an inherited condition that can affect
both sexes but can only be passed on by affected mothers.
The first disease to be directly linked to mutations in mtDNA was Leber
hereditary optic neuropathy (LHON), an inherited neuropathology. This

disease presents in midlife with a rapid bilateral loss of central vision due
to atrophy of the optic nerve leading to blindness. Early studies of LHON
showed a puzzling maternal pattern of inheritance, with more males than
females affected. In 1988 it was demonstrated that LHON was caused by
mutations in the mtDNA. Three main mutations are present in at least 90%
of families with the disease and all cause substitutions of highly conserved
amino acid residues in the affected mitochondrial proteins. Thus the mtDNA
mutations explain the maternal transmission of LHON although the reason
why a higher proportion of males than females are affected is not known. It
has been suggested that the expression of the disease could also require the
coinheritance of an X-linked recessive mutation; the development of LHON
could be hormonally influenced by androgens or by environmental factors,
such as heavy tobacco smoking, may also contribute to the progression of the
condition.
More than 100 pathogenic point mutations and innumerable rearrangements
of mtDNA are known that lead to general, multisystem disorders (Table 16.3),
which, like LHON, are often neuromuscular in nature. Perhaps not surprisingly, most mitochondrial disorders tend to affect the most energy demanding tissues, such as the central nervous system, heart and skeletal muscles,
kidneys and secretory tissues, although this is not always the case since
mutant proteins may interfere with mitochondrial functions in addition to
ATP formation. The diseases also vary in severity in patients with the same
mtDNA mutation. The term homoplasmy refers to the condition in which
every mtDNA molecule has the same causative mutation. In contrast, heteroplasmy occurs when the cell has a mixed population of normal and mutant
mitochondria. If heteroplasmy occurs, the severity and symptoms of the disease may depend on the proportion of abnormal mtDNA in some critical tissue. The proportion can also differ between mother and child because of the
random segregation of mtDNA molecules at cell division.
Mitochondrial disorders are far more common than was previously thought
and a substantial increase in the number of genetic defects have been

The most common cause of acquired
mitochondrial DNA defects occurs in
HIV-1 sufferers treated with highly
active antiretroviral therapy (HAART).
Highly active antiretroviral therapy
for HIV-1 is a combination therapy
(Chapter 3) which uses inhibitors
of the viral reverse transcriptase
and the HIV protease. The Ô¨Årst
inhibitor of reverse transcriptase to
be used clinically was the nucleoside
analog Zidovudine or AZT (Figure
3.32). An unwanted effect of this
drug is to inhibit the replication
of mtDNA and this depletes the
amount of mtDNA and leads to side
effects that mimic the symptoms of
inherited mitochondrial disorders.
Unfortunately such effects are
common to most nucleoside analog
inhibitors of reverse transcriptase. It
is now routine practice to monitor
mitochondrial functions in patients
treated with HAART.

occur with a frequency of about seven in 100 000.

DIAGNOSIS AND TREATMENT OF MITOCHONDRIAL DISORDERS
Considerable advances have been made in our understanding of the pathology of mitochondrial disorders. However, the diagnosis and detection of
mtDNA mutations is problematic because of the varied etiology and clinical
features of these diseases (Table 16.3). Similarly, predictors of disease progression are also highly unsatisfactory. The concentrations of lactate in plasma,
cerebrospinal fluid and urine may, individually or collectively, be increased
relative to normal, although these changes are also seen in numerous other
clinical conditions. However, a plasma lactate : pyruvate ratio of greater than
40 is usually considered a significant indicator of mitochondrial dysfunction in adults. Other indicators may be the presence of organic acids and
myoglobin in the urine, ketoacidosis (Chapter 7), and impaired renal, liver
and glandular functions.

PEROXISOMAL DISORDERS

It would appear that several different approaches to treating and managing
mitochondrial disorders will be necessary. Most current treatments of
mitochondrial disorders are unsatisfactory and concentrate merely on
relieving symptoms. For example, administration of hydrogen carbonate and
dialysis may be used to relieve lactate acidosis. Exercise may decrease the
proportion of mutant mtDNA in muscle. Treatment with standard vitamins
and ubiquinone supplements has been tried but any benefits have yet to be
established.
Gene therapy using allotopic expression may offer a permanent cure in the
future. The strategy behind this technique is to insert a mitochondrial gene
into the nucleus where it is transcribed. The resulting messenger RNA is translated in the cytosol and the protein product is then imported into the mitochondria where it alleviates the effects of the mtDNA mutation.
Families affected by mitochondrial disorders should be offered counseling
on prognosis, risk of recurrence and prevention but even this is complex,
because the degree of mutant mtDNA can change dramatically during each
transmission of mitochondria from a mother to a child. The advice to affected
families on potential reproductive options may therefore be unsatisfactory.
Consequently, the clinical management of patients with mitochondrial
disorders is largely supportive.

16.5 PEROXISOMAL DISORDERS
Peroxisomes (Figure 16.10) are organelles surrounded by a single membrane,
that carry out certain oxidation reactions, particularly those involved in the
partial degradation of long chain fatty acids. Unlike mitochondria, these
oxidations are not coupled to the formation of ATP. Peroxisomal proteins
are synthesized in the cytosol and imported into the organelles by a complex process that relies upon the relevant protein possessing a peroxisomal
targeting signal (PTS). The major signal (PTS1) consists of the carboxyl terminal three amino acid residues being the consensus sequence ‚ÄìSer-LysLeu-COO‚Äì.

0.4 ¬µm
P

Defects in peroxisomes produce a variety of lethal human diseases. The most
common of these are adrenoleukodystrophy (ALD), Zellweger syndrome
and Refsum‚Äôs disease. These diseases are caused by defects in individual
peroxisomal enzymes or faults in the transport system necessary to convey
proteins from their site of synthesis in the cytosol to the peroxisome. All are
rare, occurring in approximately one in 50 000 live births.
Adrenoleukodystrophy is an X-linked disease (Chapter 15) caused by mutations in a gene encoding an integral peroxisome membrane protein that acts
as an active carrier across the peroxisomal membrane. The disease is characterized by increased concentrations of very long chain fatty acids (VLCFAs)
in the plasma and general tissues and progressive adrenal cortex dysfunction. Several types of ALD occur, the most severe affecting males of four to
eight years of age. The major symptoms are learning disabilities, seizures,
deafness, dysarthria, dysphagia, poor muscular coordination, vomiting,
increased pigmentation of the skin, progressive dementia and poor behavior, such as aggression and hyperactivity. The adult form normally presents
at 20 to 36 years. Symptoms include stiffness and a progressive paraparesis
or weakness of the legs and ataxia, an inability to control muscular movements. Progress of the adult form is slower than childhood ALD, but may
also result in loss of brain function and may be confused with multiple sclerosis. Occasionally, women carriers can show mild symptoms of ALD.
Zellweger syndrome is caused by defects in the general ability to import proteins into peroxisomes. The peroxisomal enzymes remain in the cytosol and

Lorenzo‚Äôs oil gained considerable
publicity due to the 1992 Ô¨Ålm
of the same name. The Ô¨Ålm is
based on the story of Augusto
and Michaela Odone‚Äôs efforts to
save the life of their son, Lorenzo,
who was diagnosed with incurable
adrenoleukodystrophy (ALD) in 1984.
His parents were, however, unwilling
to give up the struggle to save him
and after participating in several
failed therapies, began to investigate
the disease themselves. This resulted
in the treatment of Lorenzo with
a mixture glyceryltrioleate (C18:1)
and glyceryltrierucate (C22:1) hence
‚ÄòLorenzo‚Äôs oil‚Äô, in the hope it would
reduce the concentration of longer
chain fatty acids in the body and also
reduce demyelination and clinical
progression.
It would appear that Lorenzo‚Äôs oil
rapidly reduces very long chain fatty
acids in plasma to normal or near
normal levels. Unfortunately, in
patients with neurological symptoms,
its use does not alleviate symptoms
nor delay the progression of the
disease. Postmortem studies show
that very long chain fatty acids in
brain are apparently unaffected.

are rapidly degraded leading to a severe peroxisomal deficiency. Individuals
have severe abnormalities in their brain, liver and kidneys and die soon
after birth. Refsum‚Äôs disease or hereditary motor sensory neuropathy type IV,
heredopathia atactica polyneuritiformis, was first recognized in the 1940s by
Refsum, who observed markedly increased concentrations of phytanic acid,
a major constituent of dairy foods, in certain patients. The clinical features
include the accumulation of phytanic acid in plasma and lipid-containing tissues, retinitis pigmentosa, blindness, anosmia (loss of sense of smell), deafness, sensory neuropathy and ataxia.
Refsum‚Äôs disease is an autosomal recessive disorder that affects the A-oxidation
of phytanic acid. In contrast to Zellweger syndrome, Refsum‚Äôs disease is due
to a reduced enzyme activity. Two enzymes, @-phytanoyl-CoA hydroxylase
(PAHX) and A-hydroxyphytanoyl-CoA lyase, found in peroxisomes, are
necessary for the oxidation of phytanic acid (Figure 16.11). Mutant forms of
PAHX have been shown to be responsible for some cases of Refsum‚Äôs disease.
An infantile form of Refsum‚Äôs disease also leads to an accumulation of phytanic
acid but resembles Zellweger syndrome in that it is due to general defects in
the transport of appropriate peroxisomal enzymes into the organelle. It is
relatively less severe than Zellweger syndrome because the enzymes in the
cytosol are thought to have a longer half-life.

DIAGNOSIS AND TREATMENT OF PEROXISOMAL DISORDERS
The diagnosis of peroxisomal disorders usually involves biochemical
tests, such as determining the concentrations of VLCFAs in the plasma.
Observations of deficient secretions of aldosterone and cortisol (Chapter 7)
by the adrenal cortex can imply ALD. Prenatal diagnoses are available using
cultured amniocytes and chorionic villus cells (Chapter 15).
The treatment of patients with peroxisomal defects is problematic since many,
especially those with Zellweger syndrome, have significant brain damage at
birth so a full recovery is not possible even with postnatal therapy. Patients
with some of the relatively milder conditions can live into their second decade.

W^dad\nd[Y^hZVhZ

LYSOSOMAL DISORDERS

Treatment largely involves supportive care and symptomatic therapy. Patients
with ALD may be given Lorenzo‚Äôs oil (glyceroyl trioleate and trierucate oils)
and a strict dietary regimen that returns VLCFAs to normal concentrations
but does not prevent neurological degeneration. A bone marrow transplant
usually has a successful outcome but only if diagnosis is early and the donor
is a perfect HLA match (Chapter 6). The treatment of Zellweger syndrome is
limited. The most beneficial is the administration of the essential long chain
fatty acid, docosahexaenoic acid (Chapter 10). Sufferers of Refsum‚Äôs disease
are given a dietary regimen free of phytanic acid.

16.6 LYSOSOMAL DISORDERS
Lysosomes are organelles bounded by a single, impermeable membrane. They
contain about 60 different hydrolytic enzymes (hydrolases) that are active at
acid pH and are able to degrade all biological materials (Figure 16.12). Other
membrane-bound vesicles, endosomes and phagosomes, fuse with lysosomes
and deliver materials taken up by the cell by endocytosis or phagocytosis for
degradation by these enzymes.
Lysosomal enzymes are synthesized by the ribosomes of the rough endoplasmic
reticulum and enzymes within the Golgi apparatus. In the Golgi apparatus,
synthetic enzymes recognize sites on the surface of the prolysosomal enzymes
and tag them with mannose 6-phosphate residues that act as molecular
addresses, ensuring that they are integrated into vesicles that eventually
become lysosomes.
Lysosomal storage diseases (LSDs) are caused by mutations in genes encoding
lysosomal hydrolases leading to an accumulation of the substrate for the
inactive enzyme within the lysosome (Figure 16.13). Eventually the cell dies,
impairing the functions of major organs such as the brain and liver. More
than 40 lysosomal storage diseases are known (Table 16.4). All are relatively
uncommon in the general population although several are more prevalent
among Ashkenazi Jews.

MEMBRANE, ORGANELLE AND CYTOSKELETAL DISORDERS

Lysosomal storage diseases are congenital disorders that seriously reduce
the quality of life and life expectancy. For example, Tay-Sachs disease leads
to blindness, paralysis, dementia and death, usually by two years of age. In
most cases LSDs are caused by the deficiency of a single enzyme. The diseases
can be subdivided according to which pathway is affected. For example,
enzyme deficiencies in the pathway for degrading glycosaminoglycans
cause mucopolysaccharidoses, deficiencies affecting glycopeptides cause
glycoproteinosis and glycolipid storage diseases result from deficiencies in
enzymes involved in the degradation of sphingolipids.
The commonest lysosomal storage disease is Gaucher‚Äôs disease with an incidence of one in 30 000 to one in 50 000 although it is about 30 times more
common in Ashkenazi Jews. The disease is characterized by the presence of
histiocytes, cells belonging either to the macrophage or Langerhans cell lineage (Chapter 4), enlarged with accumulated lipid. These cells are known as
Gaucher‚Äôs cells (Figure 16.14) and are found in the bone marrow, reticuloendothelial system, parts of the circulation and other organs. The disease is an
autosomal inherited recessive condition leading to a deficiency of lysosomal
A-glucocerebrosidase and the accumulation of glucosylceramide within lysosomes. The pathogenic mechanisms are poorly understood but three forms
are recognized: type 1 or adult, type 2 or infantile and type 3 or juvenile; the
differences presumably arise from different mutations in the gene encoding
the enzyme.

Nucleus

Figure 16.14 Schematic of a Gaucher‚Äôs cell
based on several light micrographs. Note how
the stored material (glucosylceramide, see
Table 16.4) gives the cytoplasm a characteristic
‚Äòwrinkled‚Äô appearance.

Adult, type 1, Gaucher‚Äôs disease may present from infancy to adulthood.
Although some sufferers may die at a young age due to pulmonary
infections, most survive to late adult life. Type 1 disease is characterized by
hepatosplenomegaly, the enlargement of the liver typically occurring after
that of the spleen. The abdomen can also enlarge due to distention of the
colon. Most of these visceral features arise from macrophage dysfunction.
The skin bruises very easily and becomes pale yellow in color. Febrile
episodes with generalized pain in the body and limbs occur. Painful bones,
joints, degeneration of vertebral bodies and arthritic hip joints are common.
Pathological fractures may also occur. Mild anemia and recurrent pulmonary
infections are characteristic. Some patients show neurological abnormalities,
decreased intelligence, with ataxia and fits.
Infantile, type 2, Gaucher‚Äôs disease is much more severe with death occurring by the age of two years following progressive psychomotor regression.
The earliest symptoms include a protuberant abdomen usually due to hepatosplenomegaly and a general failure to thrive. Indeed, after six months developmental arrest and neurological regression are obvious characteristics. Fits
may occur. The patient becomes spastic, with laryngeal spasms causing difficulties in swallowing, and strabismus (a squint or abnormal alignment of
the eyes). Deterioration is rapid, leading to recurrent pulmonary infections
and death.
Juvenile, type 3, Gaucher‚Äôs disease is the rarest of the three. Although it presents
later than type 2 and has a slower progression it also has a characteristic
neurological deterioration. The major features are hepatosplenomegaly,
convulsions and psychomotor retardation. Ataxia, spasticity and strabismus
may also occur.
Inclusion cell (I-cell) disease or mucolipidosis II is rare, with an incidence of
about one in 640 000. All lysosomal hydrolases are actually produced but a lack
of N-acetylglucosylaminyl-1-phosphotransferase activity means they fail to be
tagged with mannose 6-phosphate residues, with the result that they are not
delivered to lysosomes but are secreted from the cell. The disease is named
from the densely staining intracytoplasmic regions present in the fibroblasts
of sufferers (Figure 16.15). Overt symptoms are present at birth or appear
within the first few years of life. There is psychomotor developmental delay

and generally failure to thrive. Hernias, hepatomegaly, joint limitation and hip
dislocations are common. Patients experience frequent upper respiratory tract
infections with recurrent attacks of pneumonia, bronchitis and otitis media
(Chapter 3). Cardiac murmurs from pathologies of heart valves are common
and survival beyond the age of five years is unusual.

Inclusion

DIAGNOSIS AND TREATMENT OF LYSOSOMAL STORAGE DISORDERS
Experienced laboratory practitioners using relatively simple methods can
accurately diagnose patients exhibiting the typical traits of LSDs. However,
atypical patients usually require more detailed investigations. An early
diagnosis is important to prevent serious damage to the nervous and skeletal
systems. Almost all lysosomal storage diseases can be diagnosed using samples
of leukocytes or plasma. Diagnosis is based upon assays that determine the
reduced activities of lysosomal enzymes or an increase in substrate in skin
fibroblasts, plasma or urine. For example, Gaucher‚Äôs and I-cell diseases can
be confirmed by demonstrating deficiencies in B-glucocerebrosidase and
N-acetylglucosylaminyl-1-phosphotransferase activities in leukocytes or
fibroblasts respectively.
The prognosis for adult Gaucher‚Äôs disease patients is relatively good. The
hypersplenism is usually relieved by splenectomy although this may hasten bone deterioration. Symptomatic treatment includes analgesics for the
bone pains, blood transfusions to relieve the anemia and orthopedic relief
for fractures and degeneration of the hip joints. Enzyme replacement therapy,
involving intravenous administration of purified A-glucocerebrosidase, is now
common. Receptors on the surfaces of macrophages selectively bind mannose residues on the enzyme and allow it to be absorbed by the cells. Within
the macrophages, the enzyme is delivered to the lysosomes where it catalyzes the breakdown of the accumulated glucosylceramide. In the majority of
cases this is an effective and safe treatment, reducing the sizes of the liver and
spleen and allowing them and the bone marrow to function effectively. Again,
bone marrow transplants (Chapter 6) may be useful. Gene therapy, in which
a functional gene for A-glucocerebrosidase is inserted into stem cells in the
bone marrow, may in the future provide a complete cure.

Figure 16.15 Schematic of an I cell based on
several light and electron micrographs. Note the
numerous vesicles (inclusion bodies) containing
undigested material that has accumulated
because of deÔ¨Åciencies in lysosomal enzyme
activities.

Treatment for I-cell disease is limited. Bone marrow transplants can potentially
replace the defective hemopoietic system with stem cells from a healthy donor,
providing a replacement for the defective enzymes. In a limited number of
cases, bone marrow transplants have normalized lysosomal enzyme activities,
but the preexisting clinical damage from the disease is usually so extensive by
this stage that this option is of questionable long-term benefit. In addition,
bone marrow transplants can fail and the problems of finding compatible
donors are immense.
Genetic counseling and prenatal diagnosis (Chapter 15) have roles in relation
to LSDs. In cases where the likelihood of a lysosomal storage disease being
present in a fetus is high, prenatal diagnosis is possible and a therapeutic
abortion can be offered. Methods for screening all newborns without a family
history of such conditions have been proposed but such screening programs
would require a large amount of effort for comparatively little gain.

16.7 CYTOSKELETAL DISORDERS
The cytoplasm of nucleated cells is supported by a cytoskeleton consisting
of three types of fibers and a number of associated proteins. The functions
of the fibers are to resist forces that would deform the cell, to allow the cell
to change shape and move and some types of intracellular transport. The
three types of fibers are microfilaments (MF), intermediate filaments (IF)

)+*

X]VeiZg&+/

MEMBRANE, ORGANELLE AND CYTOSKELETAL DISORDERS

and microtubules (MT). Although the lengths of the fibers are indeterminate
as they are actively extended and shortened during cellular activities, their
diameters are fairly uniform between cell types. Microfilaments and MTs have
diameters of approximately 7 and 25 nm respectively. As their name implies,
IFs have diameters between these values of 8‚Äì11 nm.
Microfilaments are made of the protein actin. They are relatively flexible
filaments but, cross-linked into bundles, they can withstand compression.
Microtubules are composed of tubulin proteins arranged into hollow rods that
are rigid and can resist both compression and tension. Intermediate filaments
are built up from a number of types of proteins that are tissue specific, keratins
in epidermal cells, desmin in muscles, for example. They form flexible cables
whose high tensile strength allows the cell to resist excessive stretching.
Microfilaments and MTs form defined tracks within the cell for the transport
of macromolecules and membranous structures. The two most common
methods for this involves the movements of motor proteins along the
filaments that are driven by the hydrolysis of ATP. The motor proteins of the
MTs are dyneins and kinesins; those of the MFs are the myosins. Actin‚Äìmyosin
complexes are probably best known as the contractile apparatus of skeletal
muscle tissues. Skeletal muscle tissue shows a multinuclear organization or
syncitium arranged into fibers, which are surrounded by a basal lamina of
extracellular matrix proteins, which forms a supporting sheath. Each fiber
contains sarcoplasm (cytoplasm) that houses the contractile fibers of actin
and myosin and is surrounded by a sarcolemma (plasma membrane). A
network of elongated protein molecules about 150 nm long of the protein
dystrophin is found within the sarcoplasm The dystrophin links actin
filaments to a transmembrane complex of proteins that, in turn, is linked to
components of the basal lamina (Figure 16.16). This complex arrangement

of proteins provides mechanical support to the sarcolemma during muscle
contraction.
The blood contains about 5 q 1012 erythrocytes per dm3 (Chapter 13). Their
major function is to carry dioxygen from the lungs to the general body tissues.
The unique biconcave shape of erythrocytes is maintained by a cytoskeleton
composed of five major proteins that form a network lining the inner surface of their plasma membranes (Figure 16.17). The spectrin‚Äìactin complex
is thought to act in a manner that resembles that of the dystrophin‚Äìactin
complex of skeletal muscle and provides mechanical support to the plasma
membrane preventing its lysis during circulation. The network of proteins
also allows erythrocytes to deform and spring back into shape as they are
pumped through the narrow capillaries of the vascular system. The numbers
of erythrocytes are maintained by a constant production in the bone marrow
and the destruction of worn out or misshapen erythrocytes by the spleen. This
destruction releases bilirubin, which is converted to bile salts in the liver and
released into the gastrointestinal tract in bile (Chapter 11). The iron from the
hemoglobin is largely retained and reused by the body.

disorders called muscular dystrophies (MDs). Defects in these proteins
compromise the mechanical strength of the muscle fibers leading to their
rupture and death during years of contraction, hence MDs are characterized
by a progressive wasting of the muscle tissues (Table 16.5). The two best
described MDs are Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD also called
pseudohypertrophic muscular dystrophy), which was first described by the
French neurologist Duchenne (1806‚Äì1875) in the 1860s, and Becker‚Äôs muscular
dystrophy (BMD, or benign pseudohypertrophic muscular dystrophy), named
after the German doctor, Becker (1908‚Äì2000), who described this variant of
DMD in the 1950s.

The incidences of MDs vary depending on the specific type. Duchenne MD is
the commonest with an incidence of three in 10 000 live-born males. Becker‚Äôs
MD is the second most common form, at one per 30 000 live male births.
Other types of MD are rare. For example, limb-girdle dystrophy occurs in only
about 1% of patients with MDs.
Duchenne and Becker‚Äôs MDs are caused by different mutations in the gene for
dystrophin. Mutations that produce STOP codons or deletions of even relatively small portions that change the reading frame lead to DMD. Surprisingly,
BMD is the result of much larger deletion mutations but the reading frame of
the rest of the gene is unaltered, leading to the production of defective dystrophin. This, apparently, is sufficient to protect the muscles from degenerating as badly or as quickly as is the case with DMD. The gene for dystrophin is
located at Xp21 (Chapter 15). Thus both DMD and BMD are inherited in an
X-linked recessive manner although up to 30% of cases of DMD are the result
of a de novo mutation. Like all X-linked recessive characters, the presence of
the gene in a male will lead to the development of symptoms because of the
absence of a homologous, normal gene on the Y chromosome. Heterozygous
females will be carriers and generally symptomless, although a number do
show mild symptoms. Only in the unlikely event of a female being a homozygote, with two X chromosomes carrying a mutated gene, will females present
with the disease.
Duchenne MD is a rapidly progressive disease characterized by loss of muscle functions that are associated with the muscle tissue wasting. This begins
in the legs and pelvis and progresses to the shoulders and neck followed by
the respiratory muscles. The course of DMD is fairly predictable, in that it
follows an aggressive and progressive course. Symptoms usually appear in
male children aged one to six years. Boys with the disorder are often late in
learning to walk. In toddlers, it may present with enlarged calf muscles and
a clumsy, unsteady gait. The initial enlarged muscle mass of the calf muscles

)+-

W^dad\nd[Y^hZVhZ

CYTOSKELETAL DISORDERS

is a compensation for loss of muscle strength. However, the enlarged muscle
tissue is eventually replaced by fat and connective tissue (pseudohypertrophy). Muscle contractures occur in the legs, rendering the muscles unusable
as muscle fibers shorten and fibrosis occurs in connective tissue. Intellectual
impairment may also occur although it is not inevitable and does not worsen
as the disorder progresses. At school age, there is trouble climbing stairs and
the child may walk on his toes or the balls of his feet and can easily fall over.
Characteristically, the belly is stuck out and shoulders held back to maintain
balance. Nearly all children with DMD lose the ability to walk between seven
and 12 years and, by 10, braces may be required for walking. Bones develop
abnormally leading to skeletal deformities of the spine and other areas. In the
early teens, or earlier, the heart and respiratory muscles may also be affected.
Cardiomyopathy is commonly present, but signs of congestive heart failure
or arrhythmias (Chapter 14) are rare. The muscular weakness and skeletal
deformities frequently lead to breathing disorders, including pneumonia. The
aspiration of food or fluid into the lungs is common during the later stages.
Death usually occurs by age 25, typically from these respiratory disorders.
The symptoms of BMD are considerably milder than those of DMD. They
usually begin about the age of 12 or in early adulthood. The pattern of
development resembles that of DMD although the course is slower and far
less predictable. Generally, muscle wasting begins in the legs and pelvis
and then progresses to the muscles of the shoulders and neck, followed
by loss of arm muscles and respiratory muscles. Calf muscle enlargement
(pseudohypertrophy) is again apparent. The rate of muscle tissue degeneration
in BMD varies greatly. Some men require wheelchairs by their thirties, others
manage for many years with minor aids, such as walking sticks, and, indeed,
the ability to walk may continue to the age of 40 or over. Cardiomyopathy
is less common than with DMD. If it does occur, then, like DMD, congestive
heart failure or arrhythmias are rare. Death usually occurs in the fifth decade
but some patients live to an advanced age.

Diagnosis and treatment of muscular dystrophies
A diagnosis of MDs begins with a family history and physical examination.
The pattern of weakness can be particularly helpful and usually the source
of weakness, whether in motor neurons or muscle tissue, can be identified
by a physical examination. Nerve conduction studies can indicate whether
the underlying problem is in the muscles or the nerves. However, an
electromyography (EMG) measures the electrical activity of the muscles and
can show if the weakness is caused by destruction of muscle tissue. Another
early diagnostic test would be to measure creatine kinase (CK) activity of the
blood to assess any leakage of the enzyme from damaged muscle. An increase in
CK levels is seen in MDs but also in other conditions, such as an inflammation.
A magnetic resonance (MR) scan can be useful in visualizing intramuscular
activity. Genetic testing and a muscle biopsy can confirm a diagnosis and both
are essential since other diseases, such as limb-girdle MD and spinal muscular
atrophy, present with some of the same symptoms. Biopsy material can also
distinguish MDs from inflammatory and other disorders as well as identify the
type of dystrophy present. Diagnostic tests using DNA of blood or muscle cells
can give precise clinical information, and their use is expanding. A diagnosis
of BMD is often not made until adolescence or even adulthood, when physical
activities become difficult.
There are no known cures for DMD or BMD. In both diseases, the goal of
treatment is to control the symptoms to promote the quality of life. Inactivity,
such as prolonged bed rest, generally worsens muscle disease and so physical
activity is encouraged. Physiotherapy may be helpful in maintaining muscle
strength and coordination. Orthopedic appliances, for example leg braces,
walking sticks and wheelchairs, may improve mobility and the ability for self-

care. However, associated stress means that a support group where members
pool common experiences and problems can be of use. Genetic counseling
is advisable, especially if there is a family history of the disorders. Note that
sons of a man with BMD (or DMD) will not develop the disease but daughters
can be carriers. An amniocentesis and appropriate genetic studies means that
DMD is detectable with an approximately 95% accuracy during pregnancy.

HEREDITARY ELLIPTOCYTOSIS AND SPHEROCYTOSIS
Two relatively common disorders associated with the erythrocyte cytoskeleton
are hereditary elliptocytosis (HE) and spherocytosis (HS). Their incidences
are variable. For example, in the USA, HS is the commonest of the hereditary
hemolytic anemias (Chapter 13) among people of Northern European descent,
with an incidence of approximately one in 5000, although many regard this
as an underestimation. The prevalence of HE is thought to be one in 2000 to
4000. Like sickle cell anemia, which was described in Chapter 13, the condition shows a much higher incidence in areas endemic for malaria, in equatorial Africa, for instance the incidence is approximately six per 1000.
Patients with HE or HS synthesize lower amounts of cytoskeletal proteins
than normal, or the proteins themselves are defective. Most cases of hereditary spherocytosis are caused by mutations in the ANK1, SPTB, SLC4A1,
EPB42 and SPTA1 genes that encode ankyrin, spectrin P-chain, band 3, protein 4.2 and @-spectrin respectively (Figure 16.17). The mutations responsible for hereditary elliptocytosis occur in the SPTB and SPTA1 and the EPB41
gene encoding protein 4.1. These mutations mean that the erythrocytes are
misshapen (Figure 16.18) and less deformable and so become trapped in
the spleen where they are prematurely degraded. The consequent excessive
release of bilirubin leads to jaundice and gallstones (Chapter 11). The anemia
caused by reduced numbers of circulating erythrocytes results in the release
of immature erythrocytes from the bone marrow.

Diagnosis and treatment of hereditary elliptocytosis and spherocytosis
The simplest way to test for HE and HS is the microscopic examination of
peripheral blood smears to observe the misshapen erythrocytes (Figure
16.18). Other tests include demonstration of the increased resistance of the
erythrocytes to osmotic shock using the osmotic fragility test, observation
of reduced fluorescence following staining with eosin-5-maliemide and
determination of the amounts of cytoskeletal proteins present following their
separation by electrophoresis.

SUMMARY

General treatments include daily ingestion of folate when hemolysis is
significant, and blood transfusions. The symptoms of HE and HS are alleviated
by surgical removal of the spleen (Table 16.6). This increases the time the
defective erythrocytes stay in the circulation to about 80% of that of a normal
erythrocyte.

Defects in the plasma membrane or those that surround organelles and
in the cytoskeleton cause a variety of disorders, some of which have been
outlined. Disorders of nucleocytoplasmic transport have been implicated
in a number of diseases, including some cancers. Cystic fibrosis, which is

characterized by alterations in the permeability of epithelial cell membranes
to CL‚Äì, is a very common inherited disorder, with a prevalence of one in 2000
in the UK. Mitochondrial diseases are associated largely with defects in the
oxidative phosphorylation system, leading to a variety of neurological and
neuromuscular disorders. Disorders of peroxisomes result in number of
fatal diseases that are characterized by the accumulation of very long chain
fatty acids in tissues. Lysosomal storage disorders, of which more than 40 are
known, are rare and often fatal, though the adult form of Gaucher‚Äôs disease
is usually associated with a longer life span. Diseases associated with defects
of the cytoskeleton of muscle fibers are Duchenne and Becker‚Äôs muscular
dystrophies. Mutation in genes for proteins of the cytoskeleton of erythrocytes
can lead to them being deformed and to their premature removal by the
spleen, with accompanying anemia.

17.1 INTRODUCTION
In multicellular organisms, the growth of cells by division is under tight
control (Chapter 15). Cells divide when stimulated with the requisite internal
and external signals (Figure 17.1). This strict control of cell division ensures
that division occurs at a rate appropriate to the structure of the tissue or
organ. In some tissues, for example bone marrow, skin and gastrointestinal
(GIT) endothelium, cells divide constantly, replacing ones that have died.
However, in other tissues, such as nervous tissue, mitosis is rare and lost cells
are not replaced. In yet other tissues, cells can commence dividing when
required as, for example, in the regeneration of liver or during the healing of
wounds in the skin. The term cancer covers a number of diseases in which the
growth of cells becomes uncontrolled. Cancer cells fail to respond to the usual
controling signals and their growth becomes unregulated. Indeed, the name
cancer comes from a Latin word meaning ‚Äòa crab‚Äô, and describes the manner in
which the pattern of penetration into normal tissues by the abnormal growth
bears a superficial resemblance to a crab‚Äôs claw. These abnormal cells may

invade nearby tissues and may enter the blood and lymph systems and spread
to remoter areas.
Today, the term cancer is used popularly to describe what is known as a
malignant tumor. Oncology, derived from the Greek word oncos, a lump, is
the branch of medicine involved with the study of the development of tumors,
their epidemiology, diagnosis and treatment. A tumor is an abnormal mass of
cells that may be benign or malignant. Benign tumors generally grow slowly
and do not spread to other tissues, though they may continue to grow in situ.
Such tumors are only harmful if they interfere with the normal function of a
tissue, or if they cause pressure by growing within a confined space, such as
in the brain. A malignant tumor is one that spreads from its initial site, where
it is known as the primary tumor, through the blood and lymph to establish
secondary tumors in other organs. Such movement from the primary tumor
and the formation of secondary tumors is known as metastasis. A term that is
often used in the context of cancer is neoplasm. This means, literally, a new
tumor or new mass, but is generally used to describe a cancer.
The causes of cancer are complex and varied. Some arise from environmental
agents called carcinogens, others are brought about by oncogenic, that is
cancer-inducing, viruses. Most cancers arise, ultimately, from mutations in
DNA. These mutations may be caused by environmental agents, or may be
inherited in the germ line, making individuals more susceptible to cancer.
Margin Note 17.1 The germ line

i

Germline DNA refers to the DNA
which is present in the cells that give
rise to the gametes, that is, the sperm
and eggs (Chapter 7). The egg and
sperm fuse to form a zygote, and, as
further divisions occur, that DNA is
passed to all the cells in the developing embryo. Mutations which occur
in germline DNA are present in the
gametes and in all the cells of the
individuals to which they give rise.

Cancers can arise from any tissue in the body; indeed, they have been
detected in over 200 different sites. Some sites are more susceptible than
others, the commonest being the lungs, breasts, prostate, GIT and skin. While
most cancers occur more frequently in the old than in the young, with cancer
generally being regarded as a disease of aging (Chapter 18), certain cancers
occur typically in children. In the UK it has been estimated that one in three
individuals will develop a cancer at some time in their life and that cancer
causes one in four deaths. Treatment of cancer represents 6% of all NHS
hospital expenditure. Similar incidence rates are seen in the USA.
This chapter will review the biology of cancer and its consequences to the
individual. The causes of cancer, including genetic aspects, environmental
insults and viruses will be examined. The involvement of the pathology
laboratory in the screening, diagnosis and treatment of cancers will also be
discussed.

17.2 CLASSIFICATION OF CANCER TYPES
Cancers are often classified according to their tissue of origin. Thus, a
carcinoma is derived from epithelial tissue, whereas a sarcoma is derived
from tissue of mesodermal origin such as muscle, bone or cartilage. The term
leukemia refers to tumors of the bone marrow that result in excess cells of
a single type appearing in the blood. Lymphoma refers to a tumor which
arises from lymphoid tissue, such as a lymph node. There is also a group of
highly malignant tumors that occur in childhood, which all have the suffix
‚Äòblastoma‚Äô. These include neuroblastomas, which arise in the neuroblasts of
the adrenal medulla, retinoblastoma, which originates in the retina of the eye,
and nephroblastoma, derived from the embryonic cells of the kidney.

17.3 EPIDEMIOLOGY OF CANCER
In England in 2002 there were 276 700 new cases of malignant cancer
registered, approximately evenly divided amongst men and women. However,
individual cancers are often unevenly distributed between the sexes and,

EPIDEMIOLOGY OF CANCER

clearly, some cancers occur only in men or women. Obvious examples of
the latter are cancer of the cervix uteri or ‚Äòcervical cancer‚Äô in women and
testicular and prostate cancer in men. Contrary to common belief, men
can develop breast cancer, although the incidence is much lower than in
women. Moreover, the incidence of breast cancer in both sexes appears to be
increasing. A study in the USA showed increases in male and female breast
cancer of 26% and 52% respectively between two separate studies in 1973‚Äì
1978 and 1994‚Äì1998. The commonest forms of cancer in men, women and
children in the USA are shown in Table 17.1.

The annual incidence of different forms of cancer is shown in Figure 17.2. With
the exception of the childhood cancers, the incidence of cancer increases with
age, as shown in Figure 17.3. This increasing incidence is due to a number
of factors including increased length of exposure to environmental agents
associated with cancer, and an accumulation within cells of mutations in
the DNA (Chapter 18), coupled with decreased efficiency of the cellular DNA
repair mechanisms. In addition the immune system, which may play a role
in eliminating early cancerous cells, also decreases in efficiency with age and
this may lead to a failure to eliminate malignant cells as they arise.

In 1914, Boveri (1862‚Äì1915) suggested that a malignant tumor arose from a
cell that had acquired chromosomal abnormalities. In other words, cancer
was caused by mutations in the DNA of cells. The multistep theory of cancer
suggests that between five and seven successive mutations may have to occur
before a cancer can develop (Figure 17.4). Each successive mutation gives
the cell a selective growth advantage over the normal cells which surround
it. For example, one mutation may confer the ability to grow at a faster rate
than normal cells. The cell would then proliferate to form a tissue which is
said to be hyperplastic. One of the daughter cells may then undergo another
mutation, which allows uncontrolled division of the progeny, to form a mass
of cells which have abnormal morphology. At this stage the tumor is known as
a carcinoma in situ. Accumulation of further mutations within the clone may
mean that the cells can detach from the tumor and invade surrounding tissue,
that is, they metastasize.
In 2004, a census of published scientific literature showed that 291 genes,
representing approximately 1% of the total number of human genes, are
associated with cancers. For 90% of these genes, somatic mutations were
detected in the cancer cells but not in normal tissue. Approximately 20% of
‚Äòcancer genes‚Äô show mutations in the germline DNA, which predispose an
individual to cancer, while 10% have been associated with mutations in both
germline and somatic DNA.
Genes that are associated with cancer include those that control the cell cycle,
including cell division and differentiation or molecules involved in signal
transduction and associated growth factors, as well as those that control
the process of programmed cell death that results in apoptosis (Chapter 16).
Mutations in some of these genes may lead to increased proliferation and
failures in apoptosis. Two major groups of genes linked to cancers are the
oncogenes and the tumor suppressor genes.

ONCOGENES
Oncogenes are mutated forms of normal genes, called proto-oncogenes,
which stimulate the increased proliferation of abnormal cells by encoding
factors including growth factors and receptors, as well as proteins involved
in signal transduction (Chapter 7). Examples include MYC, FOS and the RAS

W^dad\nd[Y^hZVhZ

MOLECULAR BIOLOGY OF CANCER

family of oncogenes. The mutation of a proto-oncogene to form an oncogene
usually results in the production of a protein that has increased activity, or in
the synthesis of greater than normal amounts of the protein, as, for example,
when the gene is continually active. Such mutations are otherwise known
as ‚Äògain-of-function‚Äô mutations. Oncogenes were first discovered in certain
viruses that cause cancer (Section 17.5). Some viruses which cause cancer
have a gene that is the equivalent of a cellular proto-oncogene. These genes
are thought to have been derived initially from host DNA into which the viral
DNA was integrated and to have undergone mutation during viral passage.
When DNA derived from the virus becomes inserted into the host genome,
the viral oncogene may provide the additional signal for cellular proliferation,
or may override the normal cellular controls, resulting in the unregulated
division of infected cells. The viral and cellular forms of the oncogene are
usually distinguished by the prefix ‚Äòv‚Äô and ‚Äòc‚Äô respectively as in, for example,
v-MYC and c-MYC.
Some examples of oncogenes and associated tumors are shown in Table 17.2.

TUMOR SUPPRESSOR GENES
Tumor suppressor genes, in contrast to proto-oncogenes, encode proteins
that inhibit the proliferation of cells that contain deleterious mutations.
Mutations in the tumor suppressor genes themselves may then lead to a
loss of this inhibition that is, they are ‚Äòloss of function‚Äô mutations. Some
examples of tumor suppressor genes are the TP53 gene, the retinoblastoma
susceptibility gene, RB, and the Wilms‚Äô tumor gene, WT1. The TP53 gene is

Margin Note 17.2 Gene E2F3

i

The gene E2F3, which is associated
with the development of prostate
cancer (Section 17.8), was discovered
in 2004. The gene encodes a protein
that controls cell division. It is
produced in appropriate amounts in
healthy prostate cells but is
overexpressed in prostate cancer
cells, leading to their excessive
proliferation. The discovery is useful
because this protein can be used as a
marker for the more aggressive forms
of prostate cancer, allowing treatment
to be tailored and monitored
appropriately.

Margin Note 17.3 EMSY and
breast cancer

i

EMSY is a gene involved in regulating
the expression of other genes involved
in the repair of DNA. It appears to
have a role in the development of
breast cancer. In 2003, an analysis of
more than 500 breast cancers and
over 300 ovarian cancers showed
that multiple copies of this gene were
present in 13% of breast cancers
and 17% of ovarian cancers. Women
whose tumors carried multiple copies of the gene survived on average
for six years after diagnosis whereas
those with normal amounts of the
gene had a mean survival time of 14
years. Thus, the presence of multiple
copies is associated with an aggressive form of breast cancer and a poor
prognosis.

found on the short arm of chromosome 17 and encodes a phosphoprotein,
called tumor suppressor protein p53 (Figure 17.5) which has been called the
‚Äòguardian of the genome‚Äô. The gene becomes activated in cells where DNA
has become damaged, leading to the production of p53 protein. The protein
can bind to DNA, blocking division of damaged cells and inducing apoptosis,
thus preventing replication of potential tumors. Mutations in TP53 can lead
to the production of a defective p53 which cannot recognize binding sites on
DNA. Thus the replication of the cell is not inhibited, leading to a failure to
remove damaged and potentially malignant cells.

17.5 CAUSES OF CANCER
The mutations that lead to cancerous states are caused by or associated with
a number of factors. These include mutations caused by errors in replicating
DNA or failures in repairing damaged DNA, or they may be induced by a
variety of environmental agents, including chemical carcinogens and ionizing
radiation or by the action of some viruses. Mutations in cancer associated
germ-line genes may also mean that offspring carrying the gene are more
susceptible to developing cancer.

INHERITED CANCERS

binding of the p53 protein to DNA (red), this
inhibits the division of damaged cells that are
potentially cancerous. PDB Ô¨Åle 1TUP.

The association between the inheritance of a mutated gene and the
development of cancer genes may be direct or indirect. For a direct
association, the offspring must inherit a mutated gene which confers increased
susceptibility to a specific type of cancer. With an indirect association, the
inherited gene is associated with defective mechanisms for the repair of DNA
that, in turn, leads to a greater likelihood of cancer. An example of the latter
occurs in people with the disease xeroderma pigmentosum in whom a failure
to repair ultraviolet light-induced mutations in the DNA of skin cells leads to
the development of multiple skin cancers.
Examples of cancer associated genes with a direct effect include the genes
BRCA1 and BRCA2. Mutations in these genes, which are associated with an
increased susceptibility to cancer of the breast and ovaries, account for less
than 2% of all breast cancers. However, patients with a defective BRCA gene
have a much greater risk of developing breast cancer than those who do not.
BRCA1 was mapped to chromosome 17q21 in 1990 and at least 100 mutations
have been identified in the gene. Women who inherit a mutated BRCA1 gene
have a 60‚Äì83% chance of contracting breast cancer at some stage and a 20‚Äì
40% chance of developing ovarian cancer. This gene has now been sequenced
and its product identified. It encodes a transcription factor (Figure 17.6) that
regulates the expression of, amongst others, the tumor suppressor gene TP53.
Thus the presence of a mutated gene encoding a defective transcription factor
leads to a failure to eliminate damaged cells. Women carrying a mutated
form of BRCA1 may be offered a prophylactic bilateral mastectomy, that is
the removal of the apparently healthy breasts to prevent the development of
breast cancer.
The BRCA2 gene has been mapped to chromosome 13q12. Mutations in this
gene confer a 40‚Äì60% chance of developing breast cancer and a 10‚Äì20% risk
of ovarian cancer at some stage in their lives. A mutated BRCA2 gene also
increases the risk for male breast cancer.

Another gene associated with breast cancer is CHK2, which encodes a protein
kinase, called the checkpoint kinase. This enzyme is involved in the control of
the cell cycle (Chapter 15). Inheriting the abnormal variant of CHK2 doubles
the risk of a woman developing breast cancer, in that the variant form is
present in 1.9% of women with breast cancer and 0.7% of healthy women.

CAUSES OF CANCER

BOX 17.1 Li-Fraumeni syndrome
Li-Fraumeni syndrome (LFS) is a rare autosomal dominant
syndrome that is inherited in typical Mendelian fashion
(Figure 17.7 and Chapter 15) which predisposes the patient to
cancer. Li-Fraumeni syndrome has been linked to mutations in
TP53. More than 60% of members of LFS families have inherited
mutations in one of the two copies of this gene. Mutations can
occur spontaneously in germ cells of one parent or may occur
early in the development of the embryo. Some LFS families have
a mutation in the CHK2 gene rather than that encoding TP53.
Li-Fraumeni syndrome was Ô¨Årst described in 1968, and fewer
than 400 families had been identiÔ¨Åed worldwide by 2006. In
LFS families, affected individuals develop cancer at an early age
and a wide range of cancers is seen amongst family members.
These include cancers of the breast, brain soft tissue, bone and
adrenal cortex as well as leukemias, and these are diagnostic.
Patients also present with multiple primary tumors at these sites.
However, patients within LFS families have also been found to
develop tumors at other sites in addition to those used in diagnosis. Children who survive an initial cancer have a high risk of
developing a second one.
To diagnose familial LFS, patients must have a number of family members diagnosed with childhood cancer, sarcoma, brain
tumor or adrenal cortical carcinoma before the age of 45 years,
a close relative (parents, siblings, Ô¨Årst cousins) with any LFS associated cancer diagnosed at any age, and another close relative
with any cancer diagnosed before the age of 60 years. The age at
which patients present with an initial primary tumor is signiÔ¨Åcant
since more than half of patients with LFS present before the age
of 45, compared with 10% of the general population.
The commonest cancer in females with LFS is breast cancer.
Regular mammography, which is an X-ray examination of

the breast, will detect a tumor as a shadow on the X-ray Ô¨Ålm
or ‚Äòbreast mammogram‚Äô and has been advocated for women
in affected families. However, regular X-ray screening is controversial since ionizing radiation itself may increase the risk of
cancer in these patients. Prophylactic bilateral mastectomy has
also been proposed, though, again, this is controversial since
the women remain at risk of developing a cancer at a different
location. Genetic counseling of individuals in affected families is
essential to inform patients of the potential risks of cancer and
to help them develop strategies to avoid at-risk behaviors, such
as exposure to radiation.

CHROMOSOMES AND CANCER
Chromosomal abnormalities are found in some cancers. For example,
about 95% of patients with chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) have a
translocation (Chapter 15) involving chromosomes 9 and 22, that is, t(9:22).
The translocation results in the production of a longer chromosome 9 and a
shorter chromosome 22, commonly called the Philadelphia or Ph chromosome
(Figure 17.8). The translocation results in the BCR gene on chromosome
22 becoming fused with part of the ABL gene on chromosome 9. The fused
BCR-ABL encodes a tyrosine kinase that is continuously expressed, leading to
continuous stimulation of proliferation and the development of CML (Figure
17.9). The Philadelphia chromosome is also found in 25‚Äì30% of adults with
acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL; Section 17.8). In patients, the translocation
originally occured in a single bone marrow cell. However, clonal expansion
of the cell results in the blood becoming populated with cells bearing the
Philadelphia chromosome. During active disease additional chromosomal
abnormalities appear and these are indicative of a poor prognosis.
Other chromosome abnormalities have been associated with a wide range
of cancers, including breast cancer, prostate cancer and neuroblastoma,

In 1775 Potts (1714‚Äì1788), an English surgeon, noted the high incidence of
scrotal cancer amongst chimney sweeps in London and suggested that this may
be related to the accumulation of soot in their clothes. As a result of legislation
introduced to ensure that chimney sweeps were able to bathe and to change
their clothing regularly, scrotal cancer was eliminated in this profession. In
1918, the Japanese scientists, Yamagiwa and Ichikawa showed that they could
induce tumors experimentally by painting coal tar on to the skin of rabbits.
This ability of certain compounds to induce tumors experimentally (Figure
17.10) led to the identification of many carcinogenic chemicals, including
those listed in Table 17.4.
The chemical induction of cancers is assumed to be a multistep process,
probably involving mutations in several genes, possibly on different
chromosomes. Carcinogenic compounds interact with DNA usually by one
of a limited number of reactions. For example, alkylating agents such as
dialkylnitrosamines and aflatoxin B1 lead to the addition of an alkyl group
to electron-rich sites in DNA, as shown for aflatoxin B1 in Figure 12.4 (B).
Aromatic amines and amides form highly electrophilic aryl nitrenium ions
which also interact with DNA. Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons transfer an
alkyl group to DNA.
At its simplest, the process of chemical carcinogenesis can be thought to occur
in three phases namely: tumor initiation, promotion and progression. During
tumor initiation, the carcinogen, or a metabolite of the carcinogen, produces
a mutation in the DNA. The cell may repair the damage but misrepair may
lead to heritable changes. A cell that has undergone initiation, however, is not
yet cancerous because the cell has to ‚Äòescape‚Äô from normal growth control
and become autonomous. Tumor promoters stimulate clonal proliferation of
an initiated cell. An example of a promoter is tetradecanoyl phorbol acetate,
a constituent of croton oil. Croton oil will promote the development of
carcinomas in the skin of mice that have been treated with a single dose of
benzo[a]pyrene. Tumor progression involves the additional changes that lead
to malignancy and the ability to form metastases.

Table 17.4 Some carcinogenic chemicals

The targets for chemical carcinogens are the proto-oncogenes and the
tumor suppressor genes described in Section 17.4. Mutations in TP53 have
been found in more than 500 types of human tumor. The mutations occur at
vulnerable sites known as ‚Äòhotspots‚Äô, though the position of the hotspot is not
the same for all carcinogens. For example, the metabolite of benzo[a]pyrene
preferentially forms adducts with guanine bases (Figure 12.4 (A)) at codons
157, 248 and 273 of TP53, which are the same mutational hotspots found in
human lung cancers. This therefore supports the link between smoking and
lung cancer that was established in the 1950s (Box 17.2). Some chemical
carcinogens may work by promoting the generation of reactive oxygen
intermediates which themselves attack DNA. Thus health food shops promote
the sale of supplements which are known to remove or ‚Äòscavenge‚Äô these free
radicals. Alternatively some carcinogens may interfere more directly with the
regulation of cell proliferation or receptor-mediated cell signaling processes.

The commonest test for the ability of chemicals to cause mutations in DNA
is the Ames test which uses a mutant of Salmonella typhimurium that is
unable to grow on growth media in the absence of the amino acid histidine
(Figure 17.11). The test involves exposing the bacterium to the chemical in
question, usually in the presence of an extract of mammalian liver to provide
enzymes that may activate any procarcinogens present. Mutations caused by
the potential carcinogen may result in the reversion of the mutant bacterium
into one that can synthesize histidine and thus grow on the histidine
deficient medium.
Mutagenicity can also be tested by determining the ability of the chemical
in question to cause cytogenetic changes in the bone marrow of rodents.
Traditional tests for carcinogenicity have ultimately relied on the use of
laboratory animals, though this has obvious ethical implications. Some
chemicals result in the induction of tumors in the majority of experimental
animals after a single dose. The required time for a tumor to develop is
known as the latency period and this may be shortened by administering
several doses of the carcinogen.

In the 21st century the link between smoking and cancer is
well known. In the USA, smoking accounts for about 30% of
all deaths from cancer. As well as being an established cause
of lung cancer, smoking is also implicated in the development
of cancers of the mouth, esophagus, bladder and pancreas.
Other associations link smoking to increased risk of cancer of
the stomach, liver and kidney and in the development of CML.
The link between smoking and lung cancer was Ô¨Årst established
by the renowned scientist and epidemiologist, Doll (1912‚Äì2005).
Doll qualiÔ¨Åed in medicine in 1937 and, after World War II, began
work on a project to determine the causes of a sharp increase
in the number of deaths from lung cancer over the previous 30
years. He embarked on a study in which he gave questionnaires to
lung cancer patients about their habits. Originally, he thought the
increase might be due to exhaust fumes from cars. From a relatively small scale study to one which involved questionnaires sent
to over 60 000 doctors, he and his colleague, Hill (1897‚Äì1991),
were able to show that the risk of lung cancer was proportional
to the number of cigarettes smoked by the patient (Figure 17.12)
and that long-time smokers had three times the mortality rate of
nonsmokers. In addition, he established the link between cigarette smoking and a number of other serious diseases such as
coronary thrombosis (Chapter 14) and chronic bronchitis.

cancer has led to fewer people smoking in the developed world
although the number of younger women who smoke is still
increasing, as it is in parts of the developing world.

Cigarette smoking accounts for nearly 90% of deaths from lung
cancer and contributes to deaths from other forms of cancer
including those of the larynx, mouth and esophagus; smokers
are twice as likely to develop bladder cancer as nonsmokers.
Fortunately, knowledge of the link between smoking and

Doll used epidemiological studies to establish other links between
social habits and clinical conditions. For example, he showed
that imbibing alcohol during pregnancy can have undesirable
effects on the unborn baby and that exposure to relatively small
amounts of ionizing radiation increases the risk of leukemia.

It has been estimated by bodies such as the World Cancer Research Fund that
between 30 and 40% of cancers could be prevented by eating a healthy diet,
and by maintaining a healthy body weight, (Chapter 10) and participating
in adequate physical activity. Conversely, prospective studies, in which
researchers analyzed the diet and activity of a group of individuals, then
monitored the frequency of cancer deaths in that group, have indicated that
being overweight or obese contributes to 14% and 20% of deaths in men and
women respectively. In addition, obesity has been strongly linked to a variety
of cancers, including those of the GIT, liver, prostate, breast, uterus, cervix
and ovary. There is also evidence to suggest a link between the consumption
of foods with a high glycemic index (Chapter 10) and an increased incidence
of cancer.
The consumption of low fiber, highly processed foods has a well-established
association with the incidence of colorectal cancer (Section 17.8) though the
link may be more complex than was originally thought. Indeed, an increased
consumption of fiber-rich foods, such as fresh fruit and vegetables, has been
correlated with a reduced incidence of several types of cancer, including those
of the mouth, esophagus, lung and stomach in addition to those of the colon
and rectum. Such associations have led to the recommendation by the UK
Department of Health that individuals should consume at least five portions of
fruit and vegetables a day. Cruciferous vegetables such as cabbage, cauliflower,
broccoli and brussel sprouts contain sulfurophane (Figure 17.13), a chemical

W^dad\nd[Y^hZVhZ

with anticancer properties. Increased consumption of such vegetables is
inversely related to the incidence of breast and bladder cancers.

H3 C

A number of nutritional interventions appear to offer some protection
against cancer. These include decreasing the consumption of red meat
and processed red meat, the intake of which is significantly linked
to colorectal cancer. Increasing the consumption of W-3 fats such as
A-linolenic acid, (ALA), eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic
acid (DHA) and decreasing that of W-6 fats such as linoleic acid (Chapter
10) is also recommended. Flax seeds, which are a good source both of
dietary fiber and ALA, have been shown to reduce the development of
carcinogen-induced tumors and to reduce the rates of metastasis in
animal models. Numerous studies have indicated that a sufficient vitamin
D (Chapter 10) status offers protection against a variety of cancer types,
and that improvements in its intake by, for example supplementation,
could reduce the incidence of cancer and the associated mortality.
Consumption of selenium, which is present in the active sites of several
enzymes including the antioxidant enzyme glutathione peroxidase
(Chapter 10), has been associated with a decreased risk of prostate
cancer in men. Other studies have suggested that antioxidants, such as
those found in green tea, are protective against cancer, although this is
controversial. In addition a high consumption of lycopene (Figure 17.14),
a carotenoid found in tomatoes, has been shown in several studies to be
associated with a decreased incidence of prostate cancer.

RADIATION AND CANCER
Ionizing radiation can promote the production of tumors in vivo, and the
transformation of cultured cells in vitro from a normal to a malignant
phenotype. Some of the evidence for radiation-induced carcinogenesis
comes from studies of Japanese people irradiated during the atomic bomb
explosions in Hiroshima (Figure 17.15) and Nagasaki, and from populations
irradiated in nuclear accidents such as that which occurred in Chernobyl
in 1986. Long-term studies of Japanese atom bomb survivors showed an
increase in the incidence of leukemias in the first 5‚Äì10 years following
exposure. The risk of solid tumors in these people was also increased
significantly. Studies by Doll (Box 17.2) showed that infants previously
subjected to X-irradiation in utero had an increased risk of developing
leukemias and solid tumors.

The condition xeroderma pigmentosum also provides evidence for
radiation-induced carcinogenesis. These patients suffer multiple skin
cancers caused by the failure of their cells to repair ultraviolet light-induced
damage to DNA. In addition, normal cells in culture may be transformed by
irradiation into cells with a cancerous phenotype. Such studies have been
used to analyze the nature of radiation-induced carcinogenesis.
DNA is also the target of ionizing radiation in radiation-induced carcinogenesis
and the damage caused includes deletions, inversions and translocations
(Chapter 15). Irradiation is also known to induce gene amplification and to
increase chromosomal instability and these, in turn, increase the likelihood of
mutations occurring. Ultimately, mutation events involving proto-oncogenes
and/or tumor suppressor genes are the most likely causes of radiationinduced carcinogenesis.
With some exceptions, cells are more susceptible to radiation-induced damage
when dividing and this fact has been utilized in the use of radiation to treat
cancer (Section 17.7).

CANCER

VIRUSES AND CANCER
Viruses were first implicated in the development of some types of cancer
when it was shown by Rous (1879‚Äì1970) in 1911 that leukemia in chickens was
caused by a ‚Äòfilterable agent‚Äô. This virus, which causes sarcomas in chickens, is
now called the Rous sarcoma virus and has been used extensively in research
into oncogenic, or cancer-inducing, viruses.

Figure 17.16 Schematic showing an Epstein-Barr
virus. The particle is approximately 100 nm in
diameter.

Today, viruses are associated with between 10 and 20% of all human cancers. In
the 1960s, Burkitt‚Äôs lymphoma, which is a tumor found in the jaws of children
in certain regions of Africa, was found to be induced by a virus later identified
as the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV; Figure 17.16) or human herpesvirus 4 (Table
3.1) which also causes glandular fever, or infectious mononucleosis. The
EBV infects epithelial cells and B lymphocytes, causing their transformation.
This virus is associated with a number of cancers, including nasopharyngeal
carcinoma and Hodgkin‚Äôs lymphoma, in addition to Burkitt‚Äôs lymphoma.
Cancer associated viruses belong to several groups, including the retroviruses
(retroviridae), the papillomaviruses (papillomaviridae), the hepadnaviruses
(hepadnaviridae), the flaviviridae and the herpesviridae (Table 17.5).

Retroviruses are RNA containing viruses that have reverse transcriptase
activity. When they infect a cell, the reverse transcriptase transcribes their
RNA into DNA which may become incorporated into the host genome. Not
all retroviruses cause cancer but those which do are called ‚Äòtransforming
retroviruses‚Äô. The human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is a retrovirus that is
also associated with cancer, although in this case the association is indirect.
People with HIV who develop full-blown acquired immunodeficiency
syndrome (AIDS; Chapter 3) have an increased incidence of tumors, such as
lymphoma and Kaposi‚Äôs sarcoma, which are associated with EBV and Kaposi‚Äôs
sarcoma virus (KSV). It is likely that the immunosuppression caused by HIV
allows latent viruses such as EBV to escape immunological control. Kaposi‚Äôs
sarcoma virus is also associated with nonHodgkin‚Äôs lymphoma and oral
squamous cell carcinoma.

The most widely recognized association between viruses and cancer occurs
with certain strains of human papilloma virus (HPV; Figure 17.17) that are
linked to the development of cervical cancer. More than 70 papilloma viruses
have been found in humans. The genomes of these viruses all have a similar
structure and contain at least seven ‚Äòearly‚Äô genes (E1‚ÄìE7) and two ‚Äòlate‚Äô genes,
L1 and L2 (Figure 17.18). Some HPV subtypes invade epithelial cells of the skin,
causing warts while others infect the genital tract and cause benign warts, with
low risk of cancer. Others, such as HPV 16, 18, 31, 33 and 45, are associated with
the development of cervical cancer in women and are regarded as ‚Äòhigh risk‚Äô for
inducing cancer. DNA from at least one of these ‚Äòhigh-risk‚Äô types is detected in
approximately 90% of human cervical cancers. The HPV E6 and E7 genes are

viral oncogenes and the proteins they encode inactivate certain regulators of
cell division, such as the tumor suppressor protein p53 (Section 17.4). Cervical
cancers develop from precursor ‚Äòlesions‚Äô that are graded high to low according
to how much disruption of epithelial cell differentiation has occurred (Figure
17.19). In cervical carcinomas, viral DNA becomes integrated into the host
genome. However, many benign lesions also contain these strains of HPV, so
the presence of the virus alone is insufficient to cause cancer. It seems that
long-term infection with HPV predisposes the individual to cervical cancer
and that other agents, for example the carcinogens in cigarette smoke, are
required to allow the tumor to progress to full malignancy.

17.6 GENERAL DIAGNOSIS OF CANCER
The symptoms of cancer at presentation depend on the location and extent
of the tumor. Depending on the cancer, symptoms may develop when the
cancer is relatively small as, for example, when even a small tumor of the
brain causes pressure to develop. Other tumors, such as those developing in
the ovary may not produce symptoms until it is relatively large.

smear showing lightly stained squamous cells
from the superÔ¨Åcial layer of the cervix and more
darkly stained cells from the layer of the cervical
wall immediately below that of the squamous
cells. Note that these cells are abnormal in
having comparatively large nuclei and show
that the patient is at risk of developing cancer
of the cervix. See also Figure 1.15. Courtesy of H.

A number of general signs may alert an individual to the presence of an
undiagnosed tumor, for example, an unexplained weight loss of about 5 kg
or more. Weight loss that occurs as a result of cancers is due to the release
of cytokines from cells of the immune system. In end-stage cancer, this
weight loss is known as cachexia (Box 17.3). Fever, which is also induced by
cytokines, is often found in patients with advanced cancer, although this
may also be an early warning of certain types of cancer. An example of this is
Hodgkin‚Äôs lymphoma, which is characterized by fever, often during sleep, and
is accompanied by drenching night sweats. Fatigue may also be a symptom,
particularly where the cancer causes a loss of blood with concomitant anemia,
as may occur, for example, with stomach cancer. Other signs and symptoms
include the presence of a lump, as for example in the breast or testicles, or
unusual bleeding or discharges.

CLINICAL TESTS FOR CANCER
Clinical tests for cancer are used to screen for cancer in an ‚Äòat-risk‚Äô population,
to detect cancer in a patient presenting indicative symptoms, to monitor the
success of treatment or to detect recurrence in a patient who has been in
remission. These tests fall into a number of categories. They may involve the
detection and/or quantification of tumor associated molecules, the detection
and localization of tumors within the body, and the histological examination
of biopsies from suspect tissue to determine the nature of the tumor and/or
to detect precancerous conditions.

CANCER

BOX 17.3 Cachexia
Cachexia (derived from the Greek words kakos meaning bad
and hexis, condition) is characterized by a severe loss of weight,
largely of skeletal muscle mass, in someone who is not actively
trying to lose weight. It is marked by fatigue, weakness, ill health
and decreased appetite. It is usually a sign of various underlying
disorders and is associated with chronic disease such as cancer,
AIDS (Chapter 3), chronic infectious diseases, such as tuberculosis (Chapter 4) or severe malnutrition (Chapter 10). About half
of all cancer patients lose weight although the extent varies with
the type of cancer. At diagnosis, 80% of patients with upper GIT
cancers and 60% with lung cancer are already suffering cachexia,
although patients with hematological malignancies and breast
cancer usually avoid such a substantial loss of weight. Most
other solid tumors are associated with a higher frequency of
cachexia.
Cachexia is commoner in children and elderly patients and
becomes more pronounced as the disease progresses. Its prevalence increases from 50% to over 80% before death. In addition
to compromizing a patient‚Äôs quality of life, it is correlated with
poor outcomes. Indeed, cachexia is the main cause of death in
over 20% of patients, often due to degeneration of the respiratory muscles.
Cachexia also occurs secondarily because of an inability to ingest
or use nutrients, for example from obstruction in the GIT or clinical malabsorption. In cancer, it is often associated with a disordered metabolism, and both tumor and host factors appear to
play a major role in its development, although surgery or treatment-related disorders, as in the nausea and vomiting associated
with chemotherapy or radiation therapy may also be involved.
Patients tend to be insulin resistant and have high basal metabolic rates. Furthermore, the patient‚Äôs response is analogous to
that of a chronic infection (Chapter 4) and the immune system
secretes Interleukins 1 and 6 (IL-1, 6) and tumor necrosis factor
A (TNF-A) also called cachectin (Figure 17.20), which stimulate
fever, protein and lipid breakdown and the production of acute
phase proteins by the liver. Protein and lipid catabolism are also

stimulated by the release of proteolysis-inducing factor and a
lipid-mobilizing factor called zinc A2-glycoprotein (ZAG) from
tumor cells which lead to the degeneration of skeletal muscle
and adipose tissues respectively, resulting in cancer cachexia,
while supplying the tumor with fuels such as glucose (Figure
17.21). This can be detected in a patient by evaluating his or her
nutritional status, usually with a combination of clinical assessment and anthropometric tests as described in Chapter 10. Body
weight, with reference to the normal adult weight, is the usual
measure of nutritional status.
Obviously the best way to treat cancer cachexia would be to cure
the cancer. Unfortunately, in adult patients with advanced solid
tumors this is often not possible. Treatment should therefore be
aimed at improving the quality of life and, for many patients,
this means improving appetite and food intake and trying to
inhibit muscle and fat wasting. Unfortunately, treatment is limited. Hypercaloric feeding, either enteral or parenteral, does not
generally increase lean mass. Glucocorticoids are widely used
as palliatives because they inhibit the synthesis and/or release
of proinÔ¨Çammatory cytokines such as TNF-A and IL-1, which
decrease food intake directly, or through other anorexigenic
mediators, such as leptin (Chapter 10), corticotrophin releasing factor (CRF) and serotonin and have some limited effect in
improving appetite and food intake. Corticosteroids have signiÔ¨Åcant antinausea effects and improve asthenia (weakness) and
pain control. However, studies have not shown any beneÔ¨Åcial
effect on body weight. Indeed, prolonged treatment can lead
to weakness, delirium, osteoporosis and immunosuppression, all
of which are signiÔ¨Åcant problems initially in advanced cancer
patients. The synthetic derivatives of progesterone, megestrol
acetate (MA) and medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA) taken
orally have some effect in improving appetite, energy intake
and nutritional status. One novel approach under investigation
is to use supplements, such as W-3 fatty acids (Chapter 10) that
reduce IL-1 and TNF-A production and which may improve the
efÔ¨Åcacy of nutritional support.

Detection and estimation of tumor-associated molecules
Some types of tumor are associated with increases in tumor associated
molecules in the blood. These ‚Äòtumor associated antigens‚Äô are detected
and quantified by using monoclonal antibodies specific for the antigen in
question. The antibody may be used in an enzyme-linked immunosorbent
assay (ELISA) or in radioimmunoassay (RIA) as described in Chapter 4.
Examples of tumor associated antigens include prostate-specific antigen
(PSA; Section 17.8) which is elevated in the blood of patients with cancer of
the prostate, and CA 125 antigen, which is found in the blood of women with
ovarian cancer. Carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) is a glycoprotein that is
overproduced in most colon carcinomas and in carcinoma of the lung and
breast. Serum concentrations are measured and used to monitor treatment
and to predict prognosis.
Unfortunately, increases in tumor associated antigens are not exclusive
to cancer so that the tests can only give an indication of cancer. Increased

concentrations should therefore always be followed by further tests, including
physical examination and diagnostic imaging.

Detection and localization of tumors within the body
Patients who present with symptoms indicative of cancer may be examined
using diagnostic imaging procedures in order to localize the potential tumor
or to determine the extent of metastasis. Diagnostic imaging may involve
the use of X-rays, computed tomography (CT) also known as computed axial
tomography (CAT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), positron emission
tomography (PET) and ultrasound, all of which are undertaken by clinical
radiologists.
The routine screening for breast cancer by mammography is offered to
women in the UK over the age of 50 years. A tumor will show up as a shadow on
a breast mammogram. Patients who have lung cancer may have X-rays taken
of their bones, in order to determine whether the tumor has spread to them.

CANCER

Computed axial tomography scanners were introduced into hospitals in the
UK in 1975. The technique uses X-rays to take sequential pictures of the body
from different directions. In practice, the patient may be required to drink a
contrast solution, or this may be administered intravenously, to enhance the
tissue contrast. The patient then lies still on a table that passes through the Xray machine, which rotates around the patient taking pictures of thin ‚Äòslices‚Äô
of tissue. Computers then combine the images to produce three-dimensional
images or computed tomograms. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and
positron emission tomography (PET), outlined in Chapter 18, may also be
used to visualize abnormal growths within the body and for determining the
extent of tumor growth. Ultrasound (Chapter 14) may be used to locate tumors
within the abdomen, including tumors of the liver and ovaries. However, in
order to determine whether the abnormal growth represents a cancer or a
benign lesion, it is essential to examine biopsies of the growth.

Biopsies and histology
Biopsy material may be obtained from a variety of sources in one of several
ways. Samples from solid tumors may be obtained by endoscopy, or during
surgical procedures involving local or general anesthesia. An endoscope is a
long thin flexible tube with a camera and light on the end. Depending on the
tumor, the endoscope is inserted into a body cavity and allows internal tissues
such as the GIT and the lungs to be viewed. Endoscopes also enable samples of
the suspect tissue to be removed without the need for surgery. One example of
the use of endoscopy is in bronchoscopy, which is used to obtain biopsies
of lung tissue in suspected cases of lung cancer (Figure 17.22; Section 17.8).
Needle biopsy allows small amounts of tissue to be obtained from a variety
of solid tissues. Samples of blood and bone marrow may be examined
to detect leukemias. Some solid tumors may cause the build up of fluid
containing cancer cells within the peritoneal cavity (Chapter 10), where
it is known as ascites fluid, or in the thorax, where a pleural effusion may
develop (Chapter 14). These fluids contain tumor cells in suspension and may
be examined histologically to confirm the presence of cancer cells. Finally,
some precancerous lesions may be detected by taking smears of tissue and
examining them histologically, as for example in the preparation of cervical
smears in order to detect precancerous lesions as outlined below.

GENERAL DIAGNOSIS OF CANCER

Solid tissue obtained for histological examination must be processed in
order to obtain thin sections for microscopic examination. The material is
first preserved by fixation in, for example, formalin, and then dehydrated
and embedded in paraffin wax to support the tissue. This allows sections
between 2 and 7 Mm thick to be cut using a microtome. The sections are then
mounted on slides, dewaxed with xylene, rehydrated and then stained in the
manner appropriate to the investigation. The commonest stains for tissue
sections are hematoxylin and eosin. Hematoxylin stains the nucleus purple/
black depending on the formulation, while the eosin stains the cytoplasmic
contents pink. Hematoxylin and eosin allow good differentiation within the
tissue (Figure 17.23). Smears of blood and bone marrow are most frequently
stained with May-Grunwald-Giemsa, which stains the nuclei blue, while the
cytoplasmic contents stain differentially depending on the cell type. This
stain therefore allows differentiation between different types of leukocytes.
The stain commonly used to detect precancerous cells in cervical smears
is the Papanicolaou stain, or Pap stain as it is more frequently known. This
formulation contains five different stains: hematoxylin, which stains the
nucleus, Orange G (OG-6) and EA, which contains light green, eosin Y and
Bismarck brown Y. Orange G and EA are counterstains. The Pap stain is often
used to stain buccal and sputum smears as well as those obtained from the
cervix.
The preparation of material from solid tissues for histological examination is
a long process. Sometimes a more rapid examination may be required as, for
example, when the result of a biopsy is needed during an operation in order to
determine the extent of surgery required. In such cases, the biopsy is rapidly
frozen to ‚Äì176¬∞C by immersion in liquid nitrogen. This process hardens
the material and allows it to be cut into 5‚Äì10 Mm sections using a freezing
microtome or cryostat. Once the sections have been prepared they can be
stained with hematoxylin and eosin without the long procedures required with
paraffin sections, often within minutes of removal from the body. Examination
will then, hopefully, ensure the appropriate surgical procedure.
It is possible to stain cancer cells more specifically if they bear a tumorspecific marker, such as CEA (see above). Cryostat sections are often
used for this process, because fixation, wax embedding and clearing
can destroy some antigenic sites on the tumor. The sections are stained
by immunohistochemistry (Chapter 4). In this process, the sections are
incubated with a monoclonal antibody to a tumor associated antigen. This
specific binding is visualized by incubation with an enzyme-labeled antiimmunoglobulin, followed by a further incubation with the appropriate
substrate. For enzyme immunohistochemistry, a colorless substrate is chosen
that produces a colored insoluble product. It is now possible to use paraffin
embedded sections for immunohistochemistry because the antigenic sites
that were destroyed during the preparation process, can be ‚Äòretrieved‚Äô by
microwaving the sections in water, subjecting them to heat at pressure using
a pressure cooker or by allowing the sections to be partially digested with a
proteolytic enzyme. The length of time required to retrieve the antigenic sites
has to be determined by trial and error, using positive and negative control
slides.

Molecular diagnosis
The histological diagnosis of potentially cancerous cells is increasingly
being supported by molecular diagnostic techniques and it is probable that
molecular methods will be used more frequently across a greater range of
tumors once the genetic basis for the development of these tumors has been
established. The determination of the genetic profile of a patient‚Äôs primary
tumor will no doubt become routine and this will inform treatment and be
a predictor of prognosis. One way in which tumors have been investigated

is to extract DNA using a fine needle biopsy, to amplify the DNA by using
the polymerase chain reaction (PCR; Chapter 3), and to analyze the DNA
obtained for mutations known to be implicated in cancer. Fluorescence in situ
hybridization technique (FISH; Chapter 4) is also applied to diagnosis. Thin
sections of the tumor are treated to separate the DNA strands which are then
hybridized in situ with fluorochrome labeled probes for relevant mutated,
cancer associated genes (Figure 17.24). The slides are then examined using
a fluorescence microscope. The presence of the mutation is indicated by
fluorescent spots in the nucleus.

17.7 GENERAL TREATMENT OF CANCER
The traditional treatment for primary tumors that have not metastasized to
other locations in the body has been surgical excision of the tumor, followed
by chemotherapy or radiation therapy (radiotherapy). Chemotherapy involves
the use of drugs to kill cancer cells while radiotherapy uses ionizing radiation.
However, where a tumor has been diagnosed in an advanced state with
metastases in other parts of the body, palliative care only may be given, to
ease pain and discomfort.
‚ÄòStaging‚Äô of the cancer is essential as it determines the treatment that the
patient receives. Staging of a cancer involves looking at the extent of the
cancer within the body. Though staging varies between different types of
tumor, a simple system classifies the tumor into one of four stages as shown
in Table 17.6. Other staging systems include the TNM classification, where T
records how far the primary tumor has grown in its original location, N defines
whether the tumor has spread to local lymph nodes and M describes whether
the tumor has metastasized. The staging of cancers will be discussed further
in Section 17.8.
The aims of chemotherapy and radiotherapy are to stop the cancer cells from
dividing. Other treatments which have been attempted, with varying success
include immunotherapy, where the objective is to stimulate the body‚Äôs
immune system to eliminate the cancer, as well as a number of ‚Äòalternative‚Äô
therapies all of which are controversial.

CHEMOTHERAPY
More than 100 different drugs are used to treat different cancers. They are
usually given in combination (Chapter 3) and with radiation therapy and/or
surgery. Most of the chemicals used in the treatment of cancer are, traditionally,
those that kill cells, that is they are cytotoxic. Most are active on cells that are
dividing, that is they are cycle-dependent. Drugs which kill cells that are not
dividing are noncycle-dependent. There is also some evidence that at least
some cytotoxic drugs act by inducing terminal differentiation or apoptosis in
cancer cells. Many different types of chemicals target cell division in various
ways. For example, several categories of drug interfere with DNA synthesis.
These include folic acid antagonists, alkylating agents and purine and
pyrimidine analogs and the topoisomerase inhibitors (Chapter 3). Other drugs
inhibit cell division by disrupting the polymerization or depolymerization of
microtubules, thus interfering with the separation of chromosomes during
mitosis. Unfortunately, drugs that work by preventing cell division do not
discriminate between dividing cancer cells and dividing healthy cells. Thus,
these drugs have considerable toxicity, particularly towards bone marrow and
the epithelial cells of the skin and GIT. Thus, chemotherapy is associated with
anemia, nausea and damage to the actively dividing cells of the hair follicles,
leading to considerable, but usually reversible, hair loss. A role of the hospital
pharmacist is to advise on treatment to minimize the discomfort caused by
this therapy. In the treatment of some cancers, aggressive chemotherapy may
destroy bone marrow, such that patients require a bone marrow transplant
(Chapter 6).
The route of administration of chemotherapeutic agents depends on the
drug. Many drugs are administered intravenously by infusion. Others are
administered intrathecally, that is, by injection into the innermost membrane
surrounding the central nervous system. This is usually achieved by lumbar
puncture. Administration of chemotherapy in hospitals requires the hospital
pharmacist to work alongside the physician so that the most appropriate dose
is administered in the most suitable manner. Some of the drugs used to treat
cancer are discussed below, although this list is by no means exhaustive. It is
worth noting that a natural selection process often takes place within tumors
treated with chemotherapy, in that some of the tumor cells may develop
resistance to the drug. In cases of drug resistance it is necessary to change the
chemotherapeutic agent.
Dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) is active in the synthesis of tetrahydrofolate,
which is required for the synthesis of purines and pyrimidines, themselves
required for the synthesis of nucleotides and DNA. Folic acid antagonists
inhibit the DHFR and some, such as methotrexate, which is cytotoxic in
concentrations between 10‚Äì7 and 10‚Äì8 mol dm‚Äì3 are used in the treatment
of cancer. Methotrexate closely resembles the substrate for dihydrofolate
reductase and can bind to it, inhibiting its action (Figure 17.25).

Alkylating agents that have two reactive groups are bifunctional and can
cross-link two biomolecules. Cross-linking the two strands of DNA is the
major cause of toxicity of these drugs since this prevents the separation of the
strands which is required for the synthesis of new DNA. Examples of alkylating
agents include the nitrogen mustards, such as cyclophosphamide, melphalan,
ifosfamide and chlorambucil, and the nitrosoureas, for example bis-chloroethyl nitrosourea (BCNU; carmustine) and cyclohexyl-chloroethyl nitrosourea (CCNU; lomustine). Some examples of their use is shown in Table 17.7.
Purine and pyrimidine analogs are drugs that resemble one of the bases
found in DNA and/or RNA. When present during nucleic acid synthesis, they
interfere with the synthesis of DNA, though the site at which they exert their
effects depends on the drug itself. Pyrimidine analogs include 5-fluorouracil or
5-FU (Figure 17.26) and cytidine arabinoside (ara-C). Purine analogs include
6-mercaptopurine (6-MP) and 6-thioguanine. Table 17.8 lists some of their
uses in cancer treatment.
Microtubules form the mitotic spindle, which is essential for the process
of chromosome separation during mitosis and meiosis. The formation of a
spindle requires microtubules to polymerize from tubulin subunits, whereas
separation of chromosomes requires depolymerization. Any drug which
interferes with either of these processes will interfere with cell division. The
first drug shown to prevent polymerization was colchicine, originally obtained
from the autumn crocus, Colchicum officinale, though this is too toxic for

therapeutic use. The vinca alkaloids vincristine, vinblastine and vinorelbine
(Figure 17.27), all derived originally from the periwinkle plant Vinca rosea,
work in a similar manner to colchicine. Vinblastine is used in combination
with other drugs to treat testicular cancer, while vincristine is used in treating
leukemias. Vinorelbine is used in lung and breast cancer therapy. Paclitaxel,
otherwise known as taxol, and docetaxel or Taxotere (Figure 17.28) are derived
from the bark and needles of the Pacific yew tree, Taxus brevifolia (Figure 15.8
(B)). These drugs also target microtubules but in this case they prevent their depolymerization. Both drugs are used in the treatment of ovarian, breast and
lung cancer.
Topoisomerase inhibitors form a complex with DNA topoisomerase II
and inhibit DNA replication. Examples of this class of drugs include VP16, or etoposide, and VP-26, or teniposide, both of which are derivatives of
podophyllotoxin, which is derived from the mandrake plant, Madragora.
VP-16 is used in the treatment of small cell lung cancer (Section 17.8), testicular
cancer and lymphomas and VM-26 is used to treat childhood leukemia.

Cisplatin (cis-diamminedichloroplatinum) was first discovered in experiments
that showed that the growth of bacteria was inhibited by an electric current
delivered by platinum electrodes. This drug is now used in combination
therapy to treat testicular cancer. It is also used in treating lung cancer. Other
platinum-based drugs include carboplatin and oxaliplatin and all function
by binding to DNA, cross-linking the strands and distorting its double helical
shape (Figure 17.29 (A) and (B)). This facilitates the binding of other proteins
to the DNA molecule that mediate toxicity of the drug.
Tumor-specific molecules, on the surfaces of cancer cells may be targeted
with monoclonal antibodies (Chapter 4). In this way treatment should be
more directed at the tumor and general toxicity reduced. Over the years,
several approaches have been made to producing targeted therapy using these

W^dad\nd[Y^hZVhZ

GENERAL TREATMENT OF CANCER

antibodies. For example, antibodies have been used to target cytotoxic drugs
and toxins such as ricin directly at tumor cells, the so-called ‚ÄòMagic bullet‚Äô
therapy. However, since monoclonal antibodies are mouse immunoglobulin
they stimulate an immune response in humans. Hence, antibodies have been
engineered to contain mouse binding sites but which are carried on human
constant regions (Chapter 4). Examples of monoclonal antibodies currently
in use are trastuzumab (Herceptin), which is licensed for the treatment of
secondary breast cancer and which is directed at growth factor receptors on
the tumor cells (Section 17.8), and rituximab (Rituxan) which is used in the
treatment of nonHodgkin‚Äôs lymphoma.

RADIATION THERAPY
Radiation therapy, which involves the use of high energy electromagnetic
waves, is used to treat between 50‚Äì60% of cancers. The treatment is based on
the fact that most cells are susceptible to radiation when they are dividing.
The common side effects of radiation therapy are fatigue, nausea and some
external burns to the skin, therefore the dose of radiation needs to be carefully
calculated in order to give the optimum antitumor dose with minimal side
effects.
Radiation treatment is delivered in one of two ways. With external beam
therapy, the area is irradiated with X-rays from an external source. The dose
of X-rays is given in short, fractionated daily doses over a period of time, a
regimen known as continuous hyperfractionated radiotherapy ‚ÄòCHART‚Äô, to
allow normal cells to recover. Treatment regimens depend on the size and
location of the tumor and the purpose of the treatment, that is, whether it
is intended to cure, to shrink the tumor prior to surgery or chemotherapy
or to palliate an incurable tumor. With internal therapy the radioisotope
is placed near or inside the tumor for a short period of time, a process
known as brachytherapy. For example, intracavitary radiotherapy involves
the insertion of 137Cesium into a body cavity in an applicator. This form of
treatment is used for cancer of the vagina, cervix or uterus. Alternatively, thin
radioactive wires may be inserted directly into the tumor, as, for example, in
the treatment of prostate cancer. Internal therapy may also involve giving
the patient a radioactive liquid either orally or intravenously. For example,
a drink of radioactive iodine may be given to treat thyroid cancer. Since the
thyroid preferentially takes up iodine (Chapter 7), the radioactivity becomes
concentrated at the site where it is required. Intravenous radioactive liquids
are used to treat metastatic bone cancer.

IMMUNOTHERAPY
The term immunotherapy in relation to cancer refers to processes that
manipulate the immune system to improve the body‚Äôs response against a tumor.
Immunotherapy has a long history and began in the era before the advent
of cytotoxic drugs when cancer patients were treated with Coley‚Äôs toxin. This
contained a mixture of killed Streptococcus pyogenes and Serratia marcescens
bacteria that stimulated the immune system nonspecifically (Chapter 4). The
BCG vaccine, which contains killed mycobacteria, was used in the 1960s and
1970s, to treat malignant melanoma and has since been used to treat bladder
cancer. Mycobacteria are potent stimulators of the immune response and
increase the production of several cytokines, including interferon G (IFN-G)
and tumor necrosis factor A (TNF-A). Nowadays, recombinant cytokines may
be given directly to enhance the immune response. For example, interferon A
(IFN-A) has been used successfully to treat multiple myeloma, CML, hairy
cell leukemia (Section 17.8) and malignant melanoma. Interleukin 2 (IL-2)
appears to exert an anticancer effect through the prolonged stimulation
of Natural Killer cells; it has been used to treat renal cancer and malignant
melanoma (Chapter 4).

CANCER

An exciting development in immunotherapy has been the production and
clinical trials of a number of anticancer vaccines based on tumor associated
antigens. Examples include vaccines based on peptides derived from
carcinoembryonic antigens, and the BiovaxID‚Ñ¢ vaccine for the treatment
of follicular lymphoma, a type of nonHodgkin‚Äôs lymphoma involving B
lymphocytes.

17.8 SPECIFIC TYPES OF CANCERS
Cancer patients, naturally, may present with a variety of symptoms depending
on the origin and extent of the tumor. The treatment administered for any
cancer patient therefore depends to a large extent upon the type of cancer
present, its location, the stage of the disease and the age and health of the
patient. Major concerns in the developed world include lung, breast, prostate
and colorectal cancers and these are discussed below. The leukemias will also
be discussed as examples of tumors arising from bone marrow stem cells.

LUNG CANCER
Almost 29 000 deaths were attributed to lung cancer (Figure 17.30) in England
and Wales in 2002 and around 37 000 new cases are diagnosed annually. In
the USA lung cancer is, again, the second most common malignancy after
prostate cancer in men and breast cancer in women, with over 160 000 new
cases occurring each year. Worldwide, about one million new cases occur
annually, with an incidence of 37.5 new cases per million population amongst
men, and 10.8 cases per million amongst women.

diagnosis. These figures are higher in the USA, where the five-year survival
figure stands at about 14%. Overall, lung cancer is the most frequent cause of
death from cancer in men, who make up around 60% of all lung cancer cases.
In women, lung cancer is the second commonest cause of cancer death after
breast cancer. The risk of lung cancer increases with age with approximately
75% of deaths occurring after the age of 65.
A link between smoking and cancer is indisputable and smoking and passive
smoking are the cause of 90% of lung cancers. The carcinogens in cigarette
smoke include benzo[a]pyrene, a polycyclic hydrocarbon and N-nitrosamines,
both of which are metabolized by the cytochrome P-450 enzymes in the
liver to carcinogens that form adducts with DNA as described in Chapter
12. Radon, a naturally occurring radioactive gas produced from the decay of

of, and on, granite, is also responsible for a small but statistically significant
number of cases each year. People who work in uranium mines are also at
risk of radon-induced lung cancer. Exposure to the mineral asbestos is also
strongly associated with the development of lung cancer and increases the
risk of developing lung cancer fivefold.

ClassiÔ¨Åcation of lung cancer
Lung cancer is classified into two main groups namely small cell lung
carcinoma (SCLC) and nonsmall cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC). Small cell
lung carcinoma accounts for about 20% of all lung cancers. The cancer
cells are small with a high nucleus to cytoplasm ratio. Nonsmall cell lung
carcinomas are comprised of three types, namely squamous cell carcinoma,
adenocarcinoma and large cell carcinoma. Squamous cell carcinomas
develops from the epithelial cells lining the respiratory tract; they form 35%
of all lung cancers. Adenocarcinomas develop from the mucus-secreting cells
in the lining of the respiratory tract and account for 27% of lung cancers.
Finally, large cell carcinoma, so called because the cells are relatively large
and rounded compared with the other forms, accounts for 10% of total lung
cancers.

Signs, symptoms, diagnosis and staging of lung cancer
Lung cancer does not generally cause symptoms in the early stages and by
the time these occur the disease is generally in an advanced state. Some
patients are asymptomatic and may only be diagnosed following a routine
chest X-ray. Symptoms at presentation include a persistent and nagging
cough, shortness of breath, recurrent chest infections such as pneumonia and
bronchitis, coughing up blood-containing sputum or hemoptysis, chest pain
when breathing or coughing, and an unexplained loss of weight. A patient
showing these symptoms should be referred urgently for a chest X-ray and/or
a CT scan. If these indicate cancer, the tumor should be staged by scanning
patients using positron emission tomography (PET). Other tests include
examination of the chest by inserting an endoscope through a small cut at the
base of the neck. In addition, biopsy may be taken using a fine needle inserted
into the lungs, guided by a CT scanner or X-ray machine.
Staging of the disease is required to determine treatment. The TNM staging
system, mentioned in Section 17.7, for NSCLC classifies the primary tumor
from T1 to T4, where T1 represents a tumor less than 3 cm diameter with
no invasion of the main bronchus. Tumors greater than 3 cm that may also
involve the main bronchus are classified as T2, while T3 represents a tumor
of any size which has invaded the chest wall, diaphragm, mediastinal pleura,
parietal pericardium or main bronchus. A T4 stage tumor is one of any size that
has invaded any of a range of tissues, such as the heart, trachea or esophagus.
The regional lymph nodes are staged as N0 to N3, where N0 represents no
regional lymph node metastasis, N1 and N2 represents increasing metastasis
to lymph nodes on the same side or opposite side to the tumor respectively.
Where distant metastasis has occurred, this is classified as M1. The TNM is
further classified into subsets as shown in Figure 17.31.
The staging for SCLC is somewhat different with patients being classified as
having limited stage disease or extensive stage disease. Limited stage disease
is used if the tumor is restricted to one hemithorax and may include patients
with lymph node metastasis. Extensive disease is defined as disease at sites
beyond the definition of limited disease.

Treatment of lung cancer
For NSCLC, surgery is used to remove the tumor, as directed by the staging. How
much of the lung is removed depends on the stage of disease and the health

of the patient. During surgery, lymph nodes are sampled to aid more accurate
staging of disease. Radiotherapy is recommended for patients with stage I, II or
III disease. Patients with Stage III or IV may be offered chemotherapy although
NSCLC is only moderately sensitive to chemotherapy. Chemotherapy for
advanced NSCLC uses a combination of drugs such as paclitaxel or docetaxel,
together with a platinum drug such as cisplatin. Patients with SCLC are
treated with a platinum drug and multidrug regimens. The drug regimen may
be given in cycles to patients who respond to treatment. Patients with limited
stage SCLC are given radiotherapy concurrently with chemotherapy. Those
who have inoperable lung cancer should be given palliative treatments to
ease their symptoms. This may include radiotherapy to relieve breathlessness
and chest pain, opioids to ease the cough, and procedures to alleviate large
airway obstruction.

BREAST CANCER
Breast cancer (Figure 17.32) is the commonest cancer in women in both the
UK and the USA, and the second leading cause of cancer deaths in women.
The incidence of new cases in the UK is about 41 000 per year and in the USA
it is just over 210 000, while the annual incidence worldwide is approximately
1.2 million. It is estimated that about one in nine women will develop breast
cancer during their lifetime. Breast cancer also occurs in men, though with
a much lower incidence. In the UK, around 250 men are diagnosed with the
disease each year and approximately 70 die annually of the disease.
Risk factors for the development of breast cancer include increased age,
childlessness, early menarche or late menopause, hormone replacement
therapy, being overweight or obese, use of the contraceptive pill and regular
consumption of alcohol over a long period of time. Breastfeeding reduces the
risk of contracting the disease. Familial breast cancer accounts for 5% of all
breast cancers and is related to the inheritance of mutated forms of genes
such as the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes as described in Section 17.4.

Signs, symptoms, diagnosis and staging of breast cancer
Breast cancer develops either in the milk-producing glands or in the ducts that
deliver milk to the nipple. Symptoms of breast cancer include a new painless
lump occurring in a breast, changes in the size or shape of the breast or in
the position of the nipple, a discharge from the nipple, an eczematous rash

around the nipple or a thickening behind the nipple, puckering or dimpling of
the skin of the breast or a swelling or lump in the armpit.
Mammography uses X-rays to locate the position of the potential tumor.
Mammography is also used to screen for cancer and, in the UK, this is
offered every three years to all women over the age of 50 years. The lump
may also be examined by ultrasound or by Color Doppler ultrasound,
which gives a picture of the blood supply to the lump. Microscopic
examination of cells from a fine needle aspirate of the lump may also be
helpful. Alternatively, the lump may be excised under a general anesthetic
for pathological examination.
The staging system for breast cancer describes two stages of noninvasive
and four stages of invasive breast cancer. Noninvasive stages include ductal
carcinoma in situ (DCIS) in which cancer cells are contained within the ducts.
If diagnosed at this stage, the disease is almost completely curable. Lobular
carcinoma in situ occurs when cancer cells are restricted to the lining of the
breast lobules. Stage 1 invasive cancer describes a tumor measuring less than
2 cm diameter, with no spread to the lymph nodes. In Stage 2 invasive cancer
the tumor measures between 2 and 5 cm and/or there are affected lymph
nodes. In Stage 3 invasive cancer the tumor is larger than 5 cm diameter and
may be attached to muscle or skin. The lymph nodes at this stage are usually
affected. Stage 4 invasive cancer describes a tumor of any size, the lymph
nodes are usually affected and the cancer has metastasized.
A microscopic examination of cancer cells allows their appearance to be graded.
Low grade or Grade 1 cancer cells have the appearance of differentiated normal
cells, whereas high grade (Grade 3) tumor cells have an abnormal appearance
and are characteristic of fast growing and aggressive cancers. The tumor cells
may also be examined immunohistochemically or by FISH (Section 17.6) to
detect expression of estrogen receptors or HER2 proteins on their surface.
Knowledge of the presence of either of these molecules allows the treatment
regimen to be determined more appropriately. Cells with estrogen receptors
may be stimulated to divide by naturally occurring estrogen, and hormone
therapy is indicated. The HER2 protein is a receptor for the human epidermal

CANCER

growth factor (hEGF). Breast cancers that are positive for HER2 proteins are
stimulated to divide by naturally occurring hEGF and some treatments prevent
this stimulation and reduce the growth of the cells. In the UK all women with
early stage breast cancer are tested for HER2 status of the tumor.

Treatment of breast cancer
The first line of treatment for breast cancer is to remove the tumor. This may
involve excision of the lump and some of the surrounding tissue or it may
mean mastectomy. Chemotherapy or hormonal therapy may be given to
reduce the size of the tumor prior to excision. During surgery, lymph nodes
are also removed from the armpit and used for accurate staging of the tumor.
Two to four weeks after excision or mastectomy, radiation therapy is used to
destroy any remaining cancer cells. Chemotherapy, using a combination of
drugs, may be used before and after surgery. If the tumor cells express estrogen
receptors hormone therapy, using drugs such as tamoxifen, is given to block
the estrogen receptors or to lower the amount of estrogen in the blood. Tumors
that are HER2 positive may be treated with trastuzumab otherwise known as
Herceptin which was described in Section 17.7.

PROSTATE CANCER
The prostate is a small gland, surrounding part of the urethra, which produces
semen that mixes with the sperm produced by the testes as described in
Chapter 7 (Figure 17.33 (A)). Prostate cancer is a disease that principally
affects men over the age of 50 years. Many prostate cancers go undiagnosed
because the tumor remains latent for long periods of time. The annual
incidence of prostate cancer in the UK is about 30 000 men and around one
in 12 men will develop the condition. In the USA the incidence is half that of
the UK. Its incidence has increased in recent years, although this may reflect
the increasing age of the population. While most prostate cancers are slow
growing, a small proportion of tumors grow and metastasize more quickly.
The risk of a man contracting prostate cancer are increased if close relatives
have had the disease, or if female family members have had breast cancer,
especially if they were diagnosed at an early age. Men of Afro-Caribbean and
African‚ÄìAmerican origin are at greater risk of getting the disease while Asian
men have the lowest risk. A diet high in animal fat and dairy products and low
in fresh fruit and vegetables increases the risk. Consumption of the carotenoid,
lycopene (Figure 17.14), which is abundant in tomatoes and tomato products,
reduces the risk of contracting prostate cancer. Lycopene has been shown to
lower the amount insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1; Chapter 7), which may
otherwise stimulate the growth of cancer cells.

Signs, symptoms, diagnosis and staging of prostate cancer
The symptoms of prostate cancer are not usually present when the tumor is
small. However, as the tumor grows there is difficulty and pain on passing
urine, coupled with a more frequent need to urinate, particularly at night.
There may also be blood in the urine. If cancer cells have spread to the bone
there may be pain in the back and pelvis.
A patient presenting with symptoms of prostate cancer will be given a digital
rectal examination (DRE; Figure 17.33 (B)). During this examination a gloved
finger is inserted into the rectum, from where the prostate can be felt. An
enlarged prostate that feels round and smooth is most likely a benign prostate
hyperplasia. In contrast, a prostate tumor will make the gland feel hard and
lumpy. Blood samples are also taken for a PSA test (Section 17.6). The PSA
test measures the level of prostate specific antigen. The normal level of PSA
is approximately 2.8 ng cm‚Äì3 in men of 50 and 5.3 ng cm‚Äì3 in men of 70 years
of age. Men with levels of 10 ng cm‚Äì3 or above require referral for further

tests because above normal levels of PSA are found in conditions other than
cancer, for example in urinary infections. Following referral, additional tests
undertaken to determine the extent of the problem include an isotopic scan of
bones and an MRI or CT scan. Biopsies of the prostate are obtained by passing
a needle through the rectum into the prostate, aided by an ultrasound scan.
Prostate cancers are commonly graded using the Gleason system which scores
the cancer according to the growth pattern and the arrangement of the cancer
cells within the prostate. The higher the score, the more likely the tumor is to
spread. The tumors are staged as shown in Table 17.9 and Figure 17.34.

Treatment for prostate cancer
The treatment for prostate cancer is determined by the grade and stage of
the tumor, including metastasis, the age and health of the patient and the
concentration of PSA in the blood. The range of treatments for early prostate
cancer includes surgical removal of the prostate gland or prostatectomy,
radiation therapy, hormonal therapy, or combinations of any or all of these.
Chemotherapy is rarely used to treat prostate cancer. Depending on the age
of the patient, an early stage cancer may not require treatment, but may be
actively monitored until treatment is needed. Prostate cancers often grow
slowly and the treatments, which have considerable side effects, should

be restricted to the more aggressive forms of the disease. Prostatectomy is
the removal of the whole prostate gland and may result in impotence and
incontinence.
External radiation therapy may be given following surgery to ensure that any
remaining cancer cells are destroyed. Radiation therapy is also used as a first
line of treatment and is an equally effective alternative to surgery. Therapeutic
approaches include external beam and brachytherapy (Section 17.6). A form
of external radiotherapy, known as conformational radiotherapy (CRT), allows
the radiation beams to be shaped to match the shape of the prostate itself,
which lowers the side effects caused by irradiation of the surrounding healthy
tissue. Brachytherapy is delivered by the implantation of radioactive iodine
‚Äòseeds‚Äô or iridium wires in the prostate itself. If the cancer has spread to bone,
radiation therapy using 89Strontium, which is preferentially taken up by bone
tissue, is given by intravenous injection.

W^dad\nd[Y^hZVhZ

SPECIFIC TYPES OF CANCERS

Prostate cancer cells have receptors for the active form of testosterone and their
growth requires a supply of testosterone from the testes. The aim of hormone
therapy is to lower testosterone levels. Some of the drugs used are analogs
of gonadotrophin releasing hormone (GnRH), examples being goserelin,
leuprorelin and triptorelin. Goserelin is administered as a subcutaneous pellet
while the others are injected subcutaneously or intramuscularly in liquid form.
Other drugs used are antiandrogens, which block the interactions of hormone
and receptor. The side effects of hormonal therapy include sexual impotence,
flushes and sweating which may be reduced by intermittently stopping and
starting the therapy.
The prognosis for men with prostate cancer is generally good, since this type
of cancer usually occurs in older men and grows slowly.

COLORECTAL CANCER
Colorectal cancer, otherwise known as bowel cancer, is one of the three most
common cancers in men and women, both in the UK and in the USA. In the
UK there are about 35 000 new cases each year, with a slight majority occurring
in men. Approximately 60% of new cases are cancers of the colon while the
remainder have cancers of the rectum. In the USA there are roughly 135 000
cases each year, about 70% being colon cancers. The five-year survival rate
for colorectal cancer is 50‚Äì60%. The vast majority of colorectal cancers are
adenocarcinomas and this section will concentrate on these. The remainder
fall into several groups as shown in Table 17.10.

Colorectal cancer

Description

Adenocarcinoma

95% of colorectal tumors, they arise from mucus-secreting cells
in epithelium of GIT lining. Most produce mucin. Between 1 and
2% are signet-ring tumors where the intracellular mucus pushing
nucleus to one side.

Squamous cell carcinoma

arise from epithelial cells of GIT lining.

Carcinoid tumor

rare, slow growing tumor of neuroendocrine origin.

Sarcoma

majority are leiomyosarcomas arising from smooth muscle in GIT
wall.

Lymphomas

1% of colorectal cancers arising from lymphoid cells in GIT wall.

Table 17.10 Types of colorectal cancer

The risk factors for colorectal cancer include increasing age, a diet rich in fat
and low in fiber, a history of inflammatory bowel disease and a hereditary
predisposition. More than 80% are diagnosed in those aged over 60 years. A
familial history of bowel cancer is also a strong risk factor as is the presence
of polyps. A polyp is a benign tumor that arises from the epithelium of the
GIT. Polyps range in size from a small bump to a lesion measuring 3 cm in
diameter; most are asymptomatic.
Adenocarcinomas are known to originate from pre-existing polyps and the
sequence of their development into a cancer is well documented. Individuals
with familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP), a rare condition responsible for
1% of colorectal cancers, have a mutated form of the adenomatous polyposis
coli (APC) gene. This gene encodes a protein that degrades B-catenin, which
activates growth-promoting oncogenes such as c-MYC. Mutations in APC lead
to the production of inactive B-catenin, hence oncogenes are continuously
activated. Patients with FAP are almost certain to develop colorectal cancer
in middle age and they are recommended to have their colon removed by

CANCER

the age of 25 years. The development of colorectal cancer is also associated
with both hypomethylation and hypermethylation of DNA and this has been
detected at the polyp stage. Methylation of DNA is involved in switching
genes off, hence hypomethylation can result in activation of oncogenes,
whereas hypermethylation could lead to inactivation of tumor suppressor
genes. Deletions in the long arm of chromosome 18 and in the short arm of
chromosome 17 are also seen in colorectal cancers. Mutations in the RAS gene
have been detected in cells in the feces of patients with colorectal cancer and
it is possible that this may be used as the basis for a noninvasive diagnostic
procedure.
The condition, hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer (HNPCC) is
associated with inherited mutations in a number of genes involved in
DNA repair that also predispose an individual to colon cancer. Hereditary
nonpolyposis colorectal cancer is estimated to cause between 2 and 5% of
colorectal cancers and is linked to 40% of cases of colorectal cancer occurring
in people below the age of 30 years. Other risk factors for colorectal cancer
include being diabetic (Chapter 7) and being of Ashkenazi Jewish origin.
This group also have a higher incidence of mutated BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes
(Section 17.5) and are therefore also more likely to develop breast cancer. The
genetic link to colorectal cancer has not been fully elucidated.

Patients with colorectal cancer may present with symptoms that include
loss of weight, bleeding from the rectum and/or blood in the feces, anemia
resulting in fatigue and breathlessness, changes in bowel habits, including
increased diarrhea, and pain in the abdomen. The tumor may cause a bowel
obstruction and if this occurs the patient suffers abdominal pain, nausea
and constipation. An initial detection of a lump in the abdomen or rectum
means that the patient must be referred for further specialist examination.
Colonoscopy is used to examine the whole colon and to obtain a biopsy for
further investigation. An alternative to colonoscopy is flexible sigmoidoscopy,
an endoscopic technique which examines only the lower part of the colon
and the rectum. The concentration of CEA (Section 17.6) in the blood can be
measured although increased values are not entirely specific for cancer and
a poorly differentiated tumor may not produce CEA. This measurement may,
however, be useful for monitoring disease progress and treatment. Abdominal
CT scans are helpful in diagnosis of metastatic spread to the lymph nodes and
liver, and chest X-rays are routinely used to detect metastases in the lungs.
Prognosis is poor for patients with metastatic spread to these two organs.
Several staging systems have been used for colorectal cancer. The Dukes system
is shown in Table 17.11 which also documents the proportion of patients who
present at this stage, together with the survival rates at five or two years.
The TNM staging system is also used increasingly for colorectal cancers
(Figure 17.35). T1, T2 and T4 are equivalent to Dukes A, B and D respectively.
T3 describes the situation if the tumor has broken the outermost membrane
of the GIT. The lymph nodes are classified as N0 if there are none containing
cancer cells, N1 where between one and three nearby lymph nodes are
involved, and N3, where there are cancer cells in four or more lymph nodes
that are more than 3 cm from the main tumor, or where there are cancer cells
in lymph nodes connected to the main blood vessels around the GIT.

Treatment of colorectal cancer

stages (TNM) of colorectal cancer.

The usual treatment for colorectal cancer is surgery. Various procedures may
be used but, if possible, a resection, in which the length of GIT containing the
tumor is excised and the two cut ends are stapled together to reinstate the
integrity of the GIT, will be performed. The advantage of resection is that

the patient does not require a colostomy bag. Patients with rectal cancer may
be given radiation treatment after surgery to reduce the risk of the tumor
recurring locally. Radiation therapy may also be used in the palliative care of
late stage metastatic cancer. Chemotherapy, 5-FU and leucovorin is sometimes
offered postsurgery to patients with a Dukes B, and usually to those with
Dukes C cancer. Chemotherapy of metastatic colorectal cancer uses 5-FU,
leucovorin and irinotecan (CPT11). Combined oxaliplatin and 5FU treatment
may also be used. Patients successfully treated for colorectal cancer should
be regularly checked for several years after surgery to detect any recurrence
of the tumor.

LEUKEMIAS
Leukemias are tumors of bone marrow cells that give rise to the blood cells
and platelets (Chapter 13). Leukemias were historically classified according
to the speed of onset and progression, with those of sudden onset and rapid
progression termed acute leukemias, while those that develop slowly over
months and years are called chronic leukemias. The current classification
is based on specific typing of the blood cells, although the terms acute and
chronic are still used. The main types of leukemias encountered clinically
are acute myeloblastic and chronic myelogenous leukemias and acute
lymphoblastic and chronic lymphocytic leukemias. Another rarer leukemia is
hairy cell leukemia named according to the microscopic ‚Äòhair-like‚Äô appearance
of the plasma membrane.

B)

Most leukemias are characterized by symptoms such as excessive bleeding
of the gums and nose, bruising, fatigue, breathlessness and increased
susceptibility to infections. These are due to inadequate production of
erythrocytes, platelets and lymphocytes owing to the abnormal proliferation
of leukemic cells in the bone marrow. Blood and bone marrow films may show
immature blast cells (Figures 17.36). Treatments for leukemia may involve
chemotherapy, radiation therapy and stem cell transplantation (Chapter 6).

Chronic myelogenous leukemia
Chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) is a rare disorder that affects
approximately 500 people annually in the UK and accounts for between
7 and 15% of all leukemias. Patients are usually adults between the ages
of 40 and 60 years. The disease is caused by malignant transformation of a
myeloid stem cell which would normally give rise to the polymorphonuclear
leukocytes, monocytes, basophils, erythrocytes and megakaryocytes. The
clonal proliferation of a myeloid stem cell results in the accumulation of

CANCER

immature and mature myeloid cells within the bone marrow and spleen.
Chronic myelogenous leukemia usually follows a clinical pattern in which
there is a benign chronic phase, an accelerated phase and a blastic or blast
crisis phase. During the chronic phase there are few signs and symptoms and
many patients are asymptomatic. Patients may present with fatigue, anorexia
and weight loss, and splenomegaly, with the condition being revealed by a
routine blood count during the investigation of these symptoms. The blood
count shows a leukocytosis, that is, an increased number of leukocytes, ranging
from 10 q 109 to more than 500 q 109 cells dm‚Äì3. A blood smear also shows
large numbers of neutrophils and immature myelocytes. The Philadelphia
chromosome is present in 95% of cases (Section 17.4). Splenomegaly may
be present on examination. The presence of myeloblasts within a peripheral
blood smear indicates a worsening of the disease and progression into the
accelerated phase and the rapidly fatal blast crisis. This may take between
three and five years from diagnosis.
Two major treatments are available for CML. The first is stem cell
transplantation following radiation therapy to destroy the patient‚Äôs own
bone marrow (Chapter 6). The second is to use imanitib mesylate (Glivec)
together with IFN-A. Imanitib mesylate is an inhibitor of tyrosine kinase
that is administered orally. It is directed against the bcr-abl protein (Section
17.5) and is successful in inducing disease remission in approximately
90% of patients. However, the remainder are resistant, while up to 25% of
patients also develop resistance during treatment. Chemotherapy with
hydroxyurea may also be used. This is a temporary measure that reduces
the leukocyte count by suppressing the division of the malignant cells. The
effectiveness of treatment can be monitored by detecting the proportion of
cells with the Philadelphia translocation.

Acute myeloid (myeloblastic) leukemia
Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a rare disease that affects approximately
2000 adults, mostly over the age of 60 years, and 100 children annually in
the UK. The disease is characterized by the presence of immature myeloid
cells, or myeloblasts, in the blood, due to clonal proliferation of an aberrant
cell in the bone marrow. The cause of AML is unknown, though it has been
linked to exposure to industrial solvents. There is no genetic link and cases
are sporadic.
Acute myeloid leukemias are classified according to the type of cell which
is involved, using the FAB (French‚ÄìAmerican‚ÄìBritish) classification (Table
17.12).

SPECIFIC TYPES OF CANCERS

Patients present with anemia and bruising due to inadequate production
of erythrocytes and platelets respectively. Poor platelet production is also
associated with bleeding from the gums and nose. An inadequate production
of appropriate leukocytes means that patients suffer repeated infections.
Acute myeloid leukemia requires rapid diagnosis and immediate treatment.
Chemotherapy is effective in bringing many patients into remission
although high dose chemotherapy followed by a stem cell transplant may be
required in some cases. Patients may require platelet transfusions before and
during their treatment and erythropoietin may be given to treat the anemia.
The use of the monoclonal antibody, gemtuzumab ozogamicin, directed at
CD33 proteins present on the surfaces of the leukemic cells may be of some
efficacy.
The prognosis for AML depends on the age at diagnosis. For adults under the
age of 55 years, the five-year survival rate is between 40 and 60%, for those
over 55 years it is unfortunately only 20%.

Chronic lymphocytic leukemia
Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is the most common form of leukemia,
affecting mostly those aged over 60 years. It is characterized by the clonal
proliferation of lymphoid stem cells. However, the disease is slow growing
and many patients are asymptomatic in the early stages. Signs and symptoms
include frequent infections, anemia, bleeding and bruising. The spleen and
the lymph nodes in the neck, axillae and groin may be swollen due to the
accumulation of abnormal cells. The cause of CLL is unknown although
in a minority of cases the disease may be familial. A diagnosis of CLL is by
examination of blood and bone marrow. A lymph node biopsy may also be
taken for histological examination. The disease is described as Stage A, B or
C according to the degree of lymph node involvement. Stage C patients have
enlarged lymph nodes in three or more areas and a low erythrocyte and/or
platelet count. Patients with Stage A, with little or no lymph node enlargement
may not need treatment. Patients with Stages B and C may be brought into
remission with chemotherapy. Treatment is usually successful in maintaining
remissions for several years.
Hairy cell leukemia is a rare form of CLL which occurs in people between 40
and 60 years of age. It constitutes 2‚Äì5% of leukemias. The leukemic cell is a B
lymphocyte and is characterized by cells with outgrowths or projections which
give the disorder its name (Figure 17.37) although the cause of the pathology
is not known. Patients present with symptoms of breathlessness, weakness,
weight loss and infections. There may also be splenomegaly. Diagnosis is
by examination of blood smears and demonstration of splenomegaly on
examination. Histological examination of a bone marrow specimen is also
undertaken.
Treatment of hairy cell leukemia is by chemotherapy, using cytotoxic drugs.
Interferon A has also been used to treat this disorder. The prognosis for hairy
cell leukemia is good. The leukemia is slow growing and chemotherapy may
only be needed after regular monitoring of cell counts reveals the count of
abnormal cells is rising and if the patient presents with symptoms.

Acute lymphoblastic leukemia
Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is a rare disorder that occurs most
frequently in children under the age of 15 years although it does affect around
600 adults annually in the UK, mostly between the ages of 15 and 25 and those
over 75 years of age. The cause of ALL is unknown. The disease is characterized
by a clonal proliferation of a lymphoid stem cell, leading to increased numbers
of lymphoblasts in the blood. As with other leukemias, patients may present
with unusual bleeding of the gums and nose, bruising, anemia, aching

joints and bones and a general feeling of malaise. Diagnosis is achieved by
microscopic examination of bone marrow taken from the pelvis or sternum.
A lumbar puncture may be used to obtain a sample of cerebrospinal fluid, to
detect the presence of leukemic cells.
Acute lymphoblastic leukemia is classified into three types according to the
FAB classification. These are L1ALL, in which the lymphoblasts resemble
mature lymphocytes, with L2ALL and L3ALL showing increasingly immature
forms of lymphoblasts. The disease may also be classified according to
whether the leukemic cells are T cells or B cells, or pre-B cells, which are
immature forms. A diagnosis of these forms involves histological examination
and immunofluorescence testing of cell surface characteristics, with analysis
by flow cytometry (Box 6.1 and Chapter 4). A proportion of ALL patients also
have the Philadelphia chromosome, which can be shown by karyotyping.
The treatment for ALL involves chemotherapy and this achieves remission
in 80% of patients. Chemotherapy may also require intrathecal injection
of chemotherapeutic agents (Section 17.7) to destroy leukemic cells in the
cerebrospinal fluid. Steroids, such as dexamethasone, may be combined
with cytotoxic drugs and imanitib may also be used. Radiation therapy to the
brain and the testes in men may also be required to prevent recurrence. When
patients are at high risk of relapse, a stem cell transplant may be required.
The survival rates for ALL depend on the age at which it is diagnosed. Children
with ALL have a five-year survival rate of between 65 and 75%, while for adults
it is only 20‚Äì35%.

17.9 SUMMARY
Cancer is a group of diseases in which cells escape from the usual regulatory
factors controlling cell division and proliferate to form tumors. Cells from
tumors may break free and move through the blood and lymph to establish
tumors at distant sites. Cancer is ultimately caused by successive mutations
in the DNA that confer a selective advantage to the cancer cells. Examples of
genes which, when mutated, may give rise to cancers include cellular protooncogenes and tumor suppressor genes. Mutations may be caused by chemical
carcinogens or radiation, by oncogenic viruses or by intrinsic failures of DNA
repair mechanisms. Some gene mutations that predispose to cancer are
inherited. Examples include mutated forms of the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes
which predispose women to cancers of the breast and/or ovaries.
Diagnosis of cancer depends on the location and symptoms produced by the
tumor. A whole battery of diagnostic procedures may be used, including tumor
imaging, histological examination of tumor biopsies and immunoassays for
tumor associated markers. Treatments for cancer include chemotherapy,
radiation therapy and immunotherapy. In addition, hormone therapy may be
useful for cancers of the prostate and breast.

AGING AND DISEASE

OBJECTIVES
After studying this chapter you should be able to:
N

describe some of the effects of aging on cells, tissues, organs and systems;

N

list the possible causes of the effects of aging;

N

describe a number of age-related clinical conditions;

N

discuss how some of the clinical and social problems of aging may be managed.

18.1 INTRODUCTION
Aging is difficult to define but is perhaps most widely understood to be a
decrease in the ability to survive. As people age (Figure 18.1), they are less able
to perform strenuous physical activities which were relatively easy when they
were younger. With aging comes a decline in the function of most organs in the
body, making elderly people more susceptible to disease. Indeed, most major
diseases of the developed world, such as coronary heart disease (Chapter 14),
cancer (Chapter 17), and diabetes type 2 (Chapter 7) are age-related. With
aging comes senescence, that is, a decline in functions of almost all parts
of the body and at all levels of organization, from cells to organ systems.
Senescence changes may be responsible for some disease of old age or may
increase susceptibility to certain diseases. Thus elderly people make up a large
proportion of patients in hospitals and in most countries a high proportion of
the health budget is devoted to the care and treatment of the elderly.
The average length of life of individuals in a population is known as the life
expectancy. Life expectancy has increased over the past 100 years in the
UK from 46 years in 1893 to 78 years in 2004. This increase has been due to
developments in modern medicine, as well as to improvements in public health
care, nutrition and housing. The increase in life expectancy has resulted in an
enormous expansion of the elderly population in all industrialized countries,
though this is less marked in developing countries. However, although the life

AGING AND DISEASE

expectancy has increased over the last 100 years, the human life span, that is,
the maximum age that can be attained by members of a particular species,
has not. Humans can live up to the age of about 120 years, but such longevity
is exceptional. Humans live longer than other mammals: an elephant, for
example has a life span of 70 years, while that of a mouse is a mere three years.
While the life span of species is inherent, humans are able, to a certain extent,
to increase their life expectancy by controlling their environment.

18.2 AGING OF CELLS, TISSUES, ORGANS AND SYSTEMS
The deleterious effects of the aging processes are numerous and diverse. They
affect cells, tissues, organs and systems.

CELLS
Cellular functions decline in efficiency with advancing age. For example, the
abilities of mitochondria to survive a hypoxic insult and perform oxidative
phosphorylation, the synthesis of structural, enzyme and receptor proteins,
the abilities of cells to take up nutrients and repair chromosomal damage
all decline with age. Aged cells also have irregular and abnormally shaped
organelles, particularly nuclei, Golgi apparatus and endoplasmic reticulum
and accumulate waste products.

TISSUES
All tissues are affected with age. For example, muscle mass is subject to
a condition known as muscle atrophy due to a reduction in size of muscle
groups and to losses of individual muscle fibers. This results in a decreased
capacity for work. Other factors, such as cardiovascular, respiratory and
joint functions, also influence muscle strength. If the elderly are disabled by
disease, for example, arthritis, mobility may also be restricted and muscles
will atrophy unless specific exercises are undertaken.

ORGANS
Age-related changes to organs include a decrease in the size and activity of
several major organs. There is a decrease, for example, both in the size and
elasticity of the lungs, resulting in a reduced gas exchange capacity. In general,
the function of the lungs is still sufficient for most activities although the
capacity for strenuous activity will be reduced due to a decline in cardiovascular
function (Chapter 14).
The weight and volume of kidneys may decrease between 20‚Äì30% with age as
nephrons are lost and replaced by scar tissue. This results in a decrease in the
rate of filtration and hence the excretory capacity (Chapter 8). Older people
are thus more at risk of developing renal disease.
The liver also shrinks in size due to loss of cells. There is a concomitant decline
in some liver functions especially in the metabolism and detoxification of
drugs and xenobiotics (Chapter 12). This is clinically significant because it
means that many medications are metabolized and cleared from the body
more slowly, a fact that must be taken into account when prescribing drugs
for the elderly.
Loss in the function of sense organs occurs with age. A decline in the ability
of the lens to change shape makes focusing on near objects more difficult

and wearing of spectacles becomes a necessity. Changes also occur in the
lens proteins, the crystallins, causing them to become more cross-linked and
browner in color. This results in more scattering and absorption of light, with
less light reaching the retina. With age there is also a general physiological
deterioration of the auditory system.
The brain loses weight with age, reducing from a typical mass of 1.4 kg at 20
years of age to about 1.3 kg at the age of 60. The loss is due to changes in
composition that include an enlargement of the ventricles and a widening
of the surface channels. Nerve cells are also lost and amyloid protein may
be deposited. An accumulation of the pigment lipofuscin (Section 18.3) also
occurs in certain neurons. These changes are believed to be responsible for
a lengthening in reaction times, a decline in problem-solving and learning
abilities and an impairment of memory.

SYSTEMS
Changes to the skin are among the most easily recognized effects of aging
(Figure 18.2). Indeed, many people use the appearance of skin and hair to
assess the age of an individual. These changes include wrinkling, changes in
skin pigmentation and graying and loss of hair. Skin wrinkling is caused by
changes to collagen, with increased cross-linking and a reduction in elasticity.
The follicles producing gray hair lack the pigment-forming melanocytes. There
is a large variation in hair loss that is not surprising given the many genetic
and hormonal influences involved.

Figure 18.2 Wrinkled skin on the hand of an
elderly person.

Skin wounds heal more slowly in older individuals. Studies have compared
healing of ischemic (reduced blood flow) and fully vascularized wounds in
young and old rats. The fully vascularized wounds healed equally well in both
populations whereas ischemic wounds took significantly longer to heal in
older animals. It may be that impaired wound healing in older people may
be related to diseases, such as atherosclerosis, or hardening of the arteries,
which contributes to ischemia of the wounded tissue (Chapter 14).
There is evidence to suggest that endocrine function declines with age because
of a reduction both of hormone production and of the numbers of hormone
receptors on target cells. For example, there is an age-related decline in the
functions of the reproductive organs, altered thyroid hormone status and an
increase in the risk of developing diabetes (Chapter 7).
Immune function also declines with age. The thymus atrophies and there is
a progressive decline in the function of T lymphocytes (Chapter 4). There is
a concomitant decrease in the production of antibodies, possibly due to loss
of regulatory T cell function together with an increase in the development of
autoimmune reactions, leading to an increased susceptibility to infections in
the elderly coupled with autoimmune injury to cells and tissues.
Numerous well-documented defects may occur in the cardiovascular system
as it ages. Connective tissues, which are essential components of blood
vessel walls, lose elasticity and this increases the rigidity of the vessels. Blood
vessels are also prone to calcification and hardening of the arteries leading
to atherosclerosis (Chapter 14). The narrowing of the lumen of blood vessels
by arteriosclerosis leads to an increase in blood pressure in the elderly. With
age, the heart muscle also becomes less efficient and the heart enlarges due
to accumulation of fibrotic tissue, leading to a decline in cardiac output. A
consequence of these changes is a reduced delivery of blood to peripheral
tissues and to the heart itself.

AGING AND DISEASE

BOX 18.1 Sunlight and skin
Type I collagen is the major collagen (Figure 18.3A, B and C) in
the dermis of the skin. Its destruction, along with damage to
other structural components of the skin occurs over decades and
is thought to underlie the characteristic alterations in appearance of aged skin (Figure 18.2).
Ultraviolet light (UV) from the sun is a major factor contributing to the premature aging of skin. This effect is called photoaging. The clinical features of photoaging include Ô¨Åne and
coarse wrinkling, blotchy pigmentation and rough skin texture,
often described as ‚Äòleathery‚Äô. These sun-induced changes are
additional to intrinsic aging processes. For this reason, people
who spend long periods in the open air, either through occupation or choice, are strongly advised to use protective UVblocking creams. The healthiest skin is found on areas usually
well covered, such as that of the genitalia and buttocks.

The mechanisms underlying collagen degradation in photoaging
are not fully understood but are at least in part due to the action
of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) released from keratinocytes
and Ô¨Åbroblasts. The levels of these collagen-degrading proteases
in skin increase as a function of age and are also transiently
increased in response to the action of UV light. In addition, the
synthesis of new collagen decreases as aging takes place. All
these effects mean there is a progressive damage and loss of
function of the collagen in the dermis. The difference between
young and old skin is, in part, a reÔ¨Çection of an intrinsic reduction in the capacity of old Ô¨Åbroblasts to synthesize collagen.
Overexposure of the skin to UV light, from the sun and from
tanning beds, is also associated with an increase in skin cancer
especially malignant melanoma, a particularly aggressive form
of cancer (Chapter 17) which can also occur in the pigmented
retina of the eye.

A number of theories have been proposed to explain cellular aging. These

and tear‚Äô and those that propose a genetic basis.

‚ÄôWEAR AND TEAR‚Äô THEORIES
‚ÄòWear and tear‚Äô theories suggest that aging processes in cells are due to a
continual exposure to harmful agents from both inside and outside the cell
throughout life. These agents include: free radicals, glycated proteins, waste
products and products of erroneous biosynthesis, the error-catastrophe
theory.

Free radicals
Free radicals are molecules that have an unpaired electron. This makes them
highly reactive although they can be stabilized by the donation of electrons to,
or removal from, other molecules. As a result of this process new radicals are
produced and a chain reaction can be propagated. Free radicals are produced
in phagocytic cells in processes aimed at destroying pathogens. They may also
be produced during endogenous enzymatic reactions, especially oxidation‚Äì
reduction reactions associated with hyperglycemia or following exposure to
tobacco smoke or ionizing radiation.

forms of glutathione. See also Figures 12.6 and
13.25.

The most studied free radical in vivo is the highly reactive hydroxyl radical
‚Äì
(OH‚Ä¢) formed by the action of ionizing radiation and from some intermediates
‚Äì
in biochemical processes. The superoxide radical (O2‚Ä¢) is less toxic and is
produced, for example, by metabolic reactions of the electron transport chain
where oxygen is normally reduced to water by accepting electrons. During this
process, a small proportion of this oxygen can be released as the superoxide
radical after having accepted only one electron:
O2 + e‚Äì

‚Äì

O2‚Ä¢

While phagocytes routinely produce the superoxide radical as part of their
antibacterial defence, it has been estimated that each cell in the body is exposed
to attack by around 10 000 free radicals per day. This sustained exposure is
thought to cause progressive damage to cells. The damaging chain reactions
cease when two radicals meet and form a covalent bond, or when they react
with a molecule that acts as a free radical trap. The latter includes vitamin
E which acts as a free radical scavenger and, by virtue of its lipid solubility,
may help to prevent damage to biological membranes. Glutathione (GSH), a
tripeptide present in most cells, contains a thiol (‚ÄìSH) group that is readily
oxidized (Figure 18.4). Glutathione is usually maintained in a reduced state
in the cytosol of cells and protects against free radical damage. The enzyme
superoxide dismutase (Figure 18.5) removes superoxide radicals by converting
them into hydrogen peroxide and dioxygen. The hydrogen peroxide is then
oxidized to water by the catalase (Figure 18.6):

There is evidence that dietary antioxidants, such as vitamins E and C
(Chapter 10) may delay the aging process and increase life expectancy in rats,
mice and some nonmammalian species but it is not known whether they act
solely by reducing free radical damage.

Both intra- and extracellular proteins are subject to posttranslational changes
during aging. For example, proteins exposed to reducing sugars may undergo
glycation. This occurs as a nonenzymatic reaction between free carbonyl
groups of reducing sugars in their acyclic form and amino groups of the
protein to form a Schiff base in a freely reversible reaction (Figure 18.7). The
Schiff base is unstable and rearranges to a more stable Amadori product, the

The extent of glycation in vivo depends on the degree and duration of
hyperglycemia. Glycated proteins may undergo further reactions to form
cross-linked fluorescent structures called advanced glycation end products
(AGEs). Advanced glycation end products accumulate with age, particularly
on structural proteins, such as collagen which has a long half-life, and they
can cause increased cross-linking of individual proteins. Such changes have
deleterious effects since excessive cross-linking decreases the elasticity and
permeability of the extracellular matrix and impairs the flow of nutrients
into and waste products out of cells. Since a high proportion of the elderly
population have diabetes or impaired glucose tolerance (Chapter 7), their
proteins are more likely to be glycated.

During aging, increasing amounts of waste material accumulate in the
cytoplasm of cells. Many of these are waste products of normal cellular
metabolism. For example, lipofuscins are yellow-brown pigments produced
by degeneration of cell membranes and organelles, probably by the free
radical peroxidation of membrane lipids. Lipofuscins accumulate with age in
many types of cells, particularly nondividing cells such as those of muscle.
Lipofuscins are chemically inert, strongly cross-linked molecules that are
stored in lysosome-like structures (Figure 18.8). They are not susceptible
to enzymatic digestion by the lysosomal enzymes (Chapter 16). It has been
suggested that a gradual accumulation of substances like lipofuscins within
cells interferes with their normal function, though there is no conclusive
evidence for this. Furthermore, there is no correlation between the amount of
lipofuscin accumulated and the reduction in cell function and survival.

The error-catastrophe theory suggests that cellular dysfunction and,
ultimately, cell death arises due to an accumulation of abnormal proteins.
Protein synthesis involves transcription of DNA to give mRNA, which
is transported to the cytoplasm and is translated to form polypeptides.
Random errors in transcription and/or translation will lead to formation of
abnormal proteins whose accumulation might impair cellular function. If the
protein in question is an enzyme, such an error may lead to a malfunctioning
enzyme and cellular dysfunction. Although enzyme activity is known to
decline with aging, it has not always been possible to demonstrate any
changes in enzyme structure with age. It seems that proteins are synthesized
appropriately in older cells and most subsequent changes to their structures
occur posttranslationally.
Some studies have indicated that certain enzymes have a changed conformation in an older cell. This suggests that enzyme molecules retained inside the
cell for long periods are slowly denatured and consequently lose their biological
activity. In younger cells, the original shapes of proteins can be restored by
cycles of denaturation followed by renaturation. Weak interactions that confer
shape to the denatured form of protein molecules are broken, allowing them to
fold back to their original shape. This process therefore corrects the defective
shape of denatured enzymes and produces molecules that are as efficient as a

newly synthesized enzyme. Unfortunately, such repair mechanisms lose their
efficacy as the cell ages.

GENOME-BASED THEORIES
There is evidence to suggest that aging is under genetic control. A number
of genetic based theories have emerged, including those that suggest
programmed aging and those that propose gene mutations.

Programmed aging
The theory of programmed aging suggests that each species has an in-built
biological clock and that aging involves a genetically programmed series of
events. In the 1960s, Hayflick demonstrated that cells are restricted in the
number of times they can enter the cell cycle by an in-built genetic program
of senescence. He showed that cultured fibroblast cells derived from human
embryos could undergo 50 cell divisions, whereas those from adults were
limited to about 20. In culture, the number of divisions is constant for each
type of cell. This is referred to as the Hayflick limit. Furthermore, the factors
that control the number of divisions are intrinsic to the cell and are not
influenced by their environment. For example, if the nucleus of an old cell
is transplanted into a young cell from which the original nucleus has been
removed, the resulting cell has a lifespan that reflects that of the transplanted
nucleus.

a macrophage containing lipofuscin inclusions

Research Laboratory, Virginia-Maryland Regional
College of Veterinary Medicine, USA.

When cells grown in culture are frozen and then recultured, they appear
to retain the memory of the number of times they have already divided in
the original culture. Hence they only complete the ‚Äòunused‚Äô number of
cell divisions. It therefore appears that there is a biological clock within all
cells. This biological clock, at least in part, resides in the telomeres, which
are extensions of DNA found at the ends of chromosomes (Figure 18.9).
Telomeric DNA protects the ends of the DNA molecule from damage. When
DNA is replicated prior to cell division, telomeric DNA does not replicate.
After each cell division the telomere becomes shorter in length. Once the
telomeres shorten to a particular length, the cell can no longer divide and
dies. The activity of telomerase can prevent the shortening of telomeres and
enable the cell to divide continuously. Most somatic cells contain an inactive
form of telomerase although a number of cell types, such as hemopoietic cells
and cancer cells, have a permanent telomerase activity. These cells can divide
indefinitely and are therefore potentially immortal.
The suggestion that aging is genetically programmed has received some
criticism. For example, the number of divisions occurring in vitro may be
different from those that occur in vivo. Furthermore, some cells, such as cardiac
muscle cells and neurons, do not divide after birth, and so programmed aging
may not apply to these cells.

Gene mutations
It is well known that mutations occur in genes during the lives of cells and
that these mutations can alter the activities of the cells (Chapter 15). The gene
mutation theory suggests that accumulation of mutations during the course of
life leads ultimately to tissue and organ malfunctions and eventually death.
Genes are composed of DNA. The cell has several mechanisms to repair
damaged, that is, mutated, DNA. Enzymes within the cell excise the damaged
region of the gene and add back a new set of nucleotides using the undamaged
DNA strand as a template. The gene mutation theory suggests that, with time,
these DNA repair mechanisms become less efficient and some mutations are
not repaired leading to functional changes.
In support of this theory, DNA obtained from liver cells of older mice has been
found to have a greater number of mutations compared with similar cells

from younger mice. In addition, liver cells obtained from strains of mice with
a short lifespan show a higher incidence of mutations compared with similar
cells from a strain of mice with longer lifespan. Radiation is known to cause
mutations and shorten the lifespan of cells. It has been suggested that natural
radiation might accelerate the aging process.

18.4 AGE-RELATED DISEASES
Factors that may contribute to causing disease in the elderly include the
physiological and biochemical changes associated with normal aging, the
cumulative exposure to harmful agents, and an increased sensitivity to agents
or the environment. A number of diseases in particular show an increased
incidence in older people. These include cancer, cardiovascular disease, type
2 diabetes, cataracts, arthritis, Parkinson‚Äôs disease and Alzheimer disease.
The latter, and Hutchinson-Gilford syndrome, which affects children, are
described in Box 18.2.

CANCER
In general, the incidence of most cancers increases with age (Figure 18.10)
with more than half of all cancers occurring in people over the age of 65 years.
Two main hypotheses have been proposed to explain the link between cancer
and age. First, an age-related accumulation of carcinogenic substances may
increase the incidence of cancers in the elderly. This process is independent
of the senescence changes described above that occur in the aging body.
The second hypothesis proposes that age-related changes may make cells
more vulnerable to becoming cancerous. Changes in immune, nutritional,
metabolic and endocrine status occur with age and may create a more
favorable environment for the induction of cancer. Such physiological changes
may affect a number of cell processes such as the detoxification of mutagenic
agents and the repair of damaged DNA (Chapter 17).

CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASE
Many of the changes in the cardiovascular system may be caused by disease
rather than old age per se. The concentration of cholesterol in the plasma
increases with age. Elevated levels over the years are thought to contribute to

AGE-RELATED DISEASES

the high incidence of mortality from coronary heart disease especially if other
risk factors are present. This risk may be decreased by changes to lifestyle,
since eating an inappropriate diet, smoking and lack of exercise are known to
be associated with atherosclerosis.

DIABETES MELLITUS TYPE 2
Many older people have some degree of impaired glucose tolerance that can
be severe enough to be classified as type 2 diabetes mellitus. The main reason
for high concentrations of blood sugar in the elderly is increased resistance
to the effects of insulin in peripheral tissues that is associated with increased
insulin levels after a meal. Diabetes in older people is strongly influenced by
diet and exercise.

CATARACTS
A cataract is a partial or complete opacity of the lens of the eye that causes
blurred vision. This affects the passage of light through the lens causing
blindness. There are many different types of cataracts but one of the most
common is senile cataract. Another risk factor for cataract is diabetes.
Cataracts are treated by removal of the opaque lens and its replacement with
a plastic lens.

ARTHRITIS
Arthritis is inflammation of the joints producing swelling, pain and restricted
movement. Osteoarthritis affects the joint cartilage and underlying bone. It is
particularly associated with increasing age, although it can occur in younger
individuals who excessively use their joints in work or athletic activities.
Osteoarthritis affects fingers, hip joints and knees (Figure 18.11(A)) but, unlike
rheumatoid arthritis, does not always cause pain and inflammation. X-raying
of joints usually shows some degree of osteoarthritis in nearly all elderly
patients although few present with any symptoms. In severe cases, the joints
of the fingers often show overgrowth referred to as Heberden‚Äôs nodes (Figure
18.11(B)) although these tend not to be painful. Osteoarthritis cannot be cured
although mild exercise can improve joint mobility.
Rheumatoid arthritis is characterized by a chronic inflammation of the joints
that usually arises from an autoimmune reaction (Chapter 5). It is also more
common in the elderly, although its onset can occur in any age group. The
result is severe pain and disability. What initiates rheumatoid arthritis is
not clear although a variety of bacteria, especially mycobacteria, have been
implicated. The treatment of rheumatoid arthritis involves using nonsteroidal
anti-inflammatory drugs. The surgical replacement of hip or knee joints may
also be required in patients who become severely disabled.

PARKINSON‚ÄôS DISEASE
Parkinson‚Äôs disease affects between 1 and 2% of individuals over the age of
70. The major defect in Parkinson‚Äôs disease is degeneration of dopaminesecreting nerve cells although other neurons and neurotransmitters may
also be affected. Patients have severe attacks of tremors that affect one
hand and then spread to the leg on the same side and then to other limbs.
The average survival time is eight to 10 years after diagnosis. Parkinson‚Äôs is
distinct from Alzheimer‚Äôs disease (Box 18.2) in that different nerve cells are
affected and there is loss of motor function, which is usually unaffected in
Alzheimer‚Äôs disease. A further feature of Parkinson‚Äôs disease is the presence
of cytoplasmic inclusions called Lewy bodies in some of the surviving
neurons. Some researchers believe that an excess of free radicals causes the
degeneration of these neurons.

AGING AND DISEASE

BOX 18.2 The young and old of aging: Hutchinson-Gilford syndrome (progeria) and Alzheimer‚Äôs disease
Hutchinson-Gilford syndrome or progeria is a disorder that
causes premature aging. The name progeria comes from the
Latin and Greek words pro and geraios that mean early and old
age respectively. The syndrome was described by two British
doctors in 1886 (Hutchinson) and 1904 (Gilford). Children with
progeria age about 10 times faster than normal; thus a child
of eight to ten will look like an 80-year-old (Figure 18.12). The
development and appearance is seemingly normal in the Ô¨Årst
two years of life after which the characteristic aging changes
take place with a rapidity that can be shocking. The appearance
of children with progeria is remarkably similar. Clinical features
include thinning and wrinkling of skin, prominent scalp veins,
loss of subcutaneous fat, alopecia (loss of hair), beak-like nose,
short stature, thin limbs with stiff swollen joints, severe arthritis,
osteoporosis, high-pitched (squeaky) voice and normal or high
intelligence. Some features of aging are absent and these children often present with delayed development of teeth, delayed
sexual maturity but no increase in incidence of cancers, diabetes
or cataracts. The life expectancy is approximately 13 years with
a range of 7‚Äì27 years. Death usually occurs from a heart attack
or cerebrovascular disease (Chapter 14).
The diagnosis of progeria is made on clinical grounds and can
be difÔ¨Åcult due to the rarity of the condition and its insidious
onset in the early stages. Given its rarity, children with progeria
often think they are the only ones with this disorder. At school
these children perform very well and usually have a cheerful and
open nature. However, because of their appearance, they are
usually stared at by strangers and must learn to cope with such
social problems from an early age. No treatment is available for
progeria. Patients may be placed on low-dose aspirin therapy to
delay symptoms of atherosclerosis.
Progeria is a rare condition affecting one in 10 million people
and about 100 cases have been identiÔ¨Åed to date. In 2005,
Europe had about 10 cases, with approximately 30 known cases
worldwide. The disease is not restricted to any particular race or

geographical area but males are affected one and a half times
more frequently than females. Although originally classiÔ¨Åed
as an autosomal recessive condition (Chapter 15), the precise
mode of inheritance is still unclear. More recent studies have
suggested a sporadic dominant mutation. This mutation results
in the production of a truncated form of lamin A, a protein
necessary to maintain the structure of the nucleus and control
the movement of materials between the nucleus and cytoplasm
(Chapter 16). Indeed, a single base change in the lamin A gene
(LMNA) on chromosome 1 can cause the syndrome. The identiÔ¨Åcation of the mutation has enabled a diagnostic genetic test to
be developed that should allow an earlier identiÔ¨Åcation or elimination of progeria in symptomatic children. In most cases, the
mutation is probably ‚Äòfresh‚Äô and has occurred only by chance in
the child and is not found in either parent.
Fibroblasts isolated from patients with progeria and grown in
tissue culture have a shorter life span than Ô¨Åbroblasts from normal individuals of a similar age. This is due to the chromosomes
of progeria sufferers having short telomeres (Figure 18.9),
which results in cells having a lower HayÔ¨Çick limit. Furthermore,
some studies have shown a decrease in the ability of cells from
patients with progeria to repair damaged DNA, although this
Ô¨Ånding has not been supported by other studies.
Alzheimer‚Äôs disease (AD) is a degenerative condition of the brain
in which some nerve cells lose function and die. Late-onset
AD is the most common cause of dementia in the elderly and
accounts for about half of such cases of dementia. In the UK,
about 5 to 10% of the population over the age of 65 develop
AD and this increases to over 20% of those over the age of 80
(Figure 18.13).
Alzheimer‚Äôs disease is characterized by the presence of extracellular plaques in the brain (Figure 18.14), usually in the hippocampus, temporal and parietal regions. The patches are resistant
to enzymatic or chemical digestion and remain in the brain

tissue even after neuron death. They consist mainly of a core of
B-amyloid peptides (AB) consisting of 40‚Äì42 amino acid residues (Figure 18.15) entangled with tau protein and surround
degenerating nerve terminals. The AB peptides are formed by
two speciÔ¨Åc hydrolytic cleavages of a B-amyloid precursor protein (APP) and catalyzed by B-secretase and G-secretase respectively (Figure 18.16). The function of APP is unclear, although
it shows some resemblance to certain cell-surface membrane
receptors.
Approximately 5 to 10% of AD cases are familial, that is inherited forms of the condition. However, most cases are sporadic
or senile AD and the risk of developing the disease increases
with age. Familial or early-onset AD is associated with mutations in two presenilin (PS) genes, PS1 and PS2. The pathological mechanisms by which these mutations cause AD is unclear.
Mutations in PS1 are more common and appear to cause more
aggressive forms of AD, in some cases with onset occurring
before the age of 30 years, although 45 to 60 would be more
likely for early-onset AD. Sporadic cases of AD are more likely to
occur in people with the gene for the variant apolipoprotein E

(Chapter 14), called apoED4, especially if they are homozygous.
A number of environmental risk factors, including exposure to
aluminum, head injuries and viral infections are also associated
with AD. Alzheimer‚Äôs disease is also associated with a decline in
choline acetyltransferase, an enzyme required for the synthesis
of acetylcholine. Indeed, there is a correlation between a reduction of choline acetyltransferase activity, the number of plaques
and severity of dementia.
The clinical features of AD can be divided into three stages.
The Ô¨Årst stage may last two to four years and is associated with
memory loss, personality changes and disorientation to time and
date. The memory loss in this Ô¨Årst stage is difÔ¨Åcult to distinguish
from the normal forgetfulness that occurs in the elderly. The
second stage may last for several years and includes confusion,
depression, inappropriate social behavior, agitation and inability to carry out the activities of daily living. The memory lapses
become more frequent and the patients often forget what they
were doing only a few minutes previously. During this stage,
personal hygiene is often neglected and vocal communication
becomes impaired as the patient has difÔ¨Åculty in remembering
words. The Ô¨Ånal stage lasts for one to two years although it
can last for as long as 10 years. During this stage the affected
individual fails to recognize their family, suffers from urinary
and fecal incontinence and cannot communicate. The affected
individuals are usually institutionalized at this stage.

BOX 18.2 The young and old of aging: Hutchinson-Gilford syndrome (progeria) and Alzheimer‚Äôs disease ‚Äì continued
The onset of AD is insidious, starting with periods of forgetfulness, leading to a confused state and eventually frank dementia.
Once severe dementia develops, life expectancy is about two or
three years. The clinical course is about eight years and patients
often die due to infections such as pneumonia, accidents and
occasionally respiratory arrest.
There is no simple and completely accurate test to diagnose
AD, although the need for one was identiÔ¨Åed in the USA (The
Surgeon General‚Äôs Report on Mental Health, 1999). A Ô¨Årm diagnosis of AD can only be given by a histological examination of
brain tissue after death. However, brain imaging techniques are
proving increasingly useful in diagnosis. Two particular imaging
techniques have been developed that allow the structure and
activities of the body, including the brains of AD patients, to be
assessed. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) allows the structure of the brain to be studied in a noninvasive manner. The
technique is based on the principle of nuclear magnetic resonance and uses powerful magnetic Ô¨Åelds to obtain chemical
and physical information about the molecules within the brain.
A computer then uses this information to generate an image of
the internal structure of the brain. Physical lesions to the brains

of AD patients are clearly visible using MRI (Figure 18.17(A)
and (B)). Positron emission tomography (PET) is also an imaging
technique but one that allows the activities in different parts of
the brain to be estimated. This is achieved by adding labeled
glucose or water to the blood and then monitoring the Ô¨Çow
of blood through the brain or the rate of glucose metabolism
in the different parts of the brain. Again, a computer is able to
analyze this information to produce digital images that highlight differences in the activities of the brains of normal and AD
patients (Figure 18.18(A) and (B)).
Given the difÔ¨Åculty in diagnosis, cases of AD are under reported.
Early diagnosis is of considerable beneÔ¨Åt since it would allow
all concerned to make informed, early social, legal and medical decisions about treatment and care for a patient. An early
diagnosis would allow drug treatment and care that could delay
institutionalization and substantially reduce costs. Conversely, an
early test that indicated an absence of AD in suspected cases
would alleviate the uncertainty and anxiety faced by the patients
and their families. However, even if a quick diagnosis were possible, there is no effective treatment for AD. Sufferers may be
placed on medication to alleviate symptoms such as depression
and anxiety. Drugs that inhibit the degradation of acetylcholine
within synapses, such as acetylcholinesterase inhibitors, are used
in treatment. These drugs can delay the impairment of cognition,
behavior and functional abilities. Vitamin E treatment has also
been used, although some studies have suggested it is of little
beneÔ¨Åt.

INVESTIGATIONS AND MANAGEMENT OF THE ELDERLY

18.5 CALORIE RESTRICTION AND AGING
A reduced energy intake (‚Äòcalorie restriction‚Äô) is known to slow down the rate of
aging and onset of age-related disorders, such as cancer (breast, lymphomas,
prostate), nephropathy, cataract, diabetes, hypertension, hyperlipidemia and
autoimmune diseases. This has been demonstrated in a variety of species
including chickens and rodents and is also believed to be true for humans. The
effects of calorie restriction were demonstrated in the 1930s using laboratory
rats. Rats were divided into two groups. One group was allowed to feed freely
while the other was fed on a diet containing 30% of the calories of the first
group, although they were provided with sufficient protein, fats, vitamins and
minerals to maintain normal health. The calorie-restricted rats lived for four
years compared with three years for those allowed to feed freely. In addition,
the calorie-restricted rats developed fewer age-related diseases.
Studies on calorie restriction have been performed in primates with
encouraging results. Long-term studies on rhesus monkeys showed that calorie
restriction reduced the incidence of heart disease, diabetes and hypertension
and was associated with a decreased concentration of blood cholesterol.
Calorie restriction may, however, be difficult to apply to humans because
many people may be unable to reduce their calorie intakes by an appreciable
amount for the extended period of time required. However, it may be possible
to motivate people to do this, especially those with family histories of agerelated diseases such as cancer and neurodegenerative disorders.
The mechanism by which calorie restriction increases the life span is unclear
but studies have shown that it is associated with a reduction in age-associated
mutations when compared with normal diets. This was demonstrated by
examining mutations in lymphocytes at four weeks, six months and one year
of age.
A high calorie diet may increase free radical-mediated damage as the
increased availability of nutrients to mitochondria increases the production
of the superoxide radical. Thus, a calorie-restricted diet appears to reduce
free radical damage to lipids, protein and DNA and improves the antioxidant
status. Calorie restriction in animals has also been shown to reduce levels of
tissue AGEs. The benefits of calorie restriction, however, depend on preventing
malnutrition and reducing overall calorie intake rather than a particular
nutrient.

18.6 INVESTIGATIONS AND MANAGEMENT OF THE ELDERLY
Investigation and management of illness in the elderly poses a number of
problems. Many conditions are more common in the elderly and often the
presentation of some of these diseases may differ from that in younger people.
For example, diabetes mellitus in the elderly often presents as a complication
of, for example, renal failure or impaired healing of wounds, instead of
the classical signs of polydipsia or polyuria (Chapters 7 and 8) first seen in
younger patients. Elderly people, particularly those with poor mobility, may
also suffer from poor nutrition. Furthermore, they are often on multiple
medications that may affect test results. The high incidence of many diseases
in the elderly population justifies screening programs for such conditions to
increase the chances of detecting disease at a more treatable stage. Clinicians,
hospitals and geriatric clinics can all carry out screening. Some of the common
investigations are listed in Table 18.1.

18.7 SUMMARY
The deleterious effects of aging processes are numerous and diverse.
They affect cells, tissues, organs and systems. Aging may be caused by a
combination of ‚Äòwear and tear‚Äô with the accumulation of harmful metabolic
products, damaged proteins, genetic mutations and the in-built aging process
that can be demonstrated in cultured cells. Calorie restricted diets have been
shown to increase life span in animals. A number of diseases are associated
with increasing age. These include cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes,
Alzheimer‚Äôs and Parkinson‚Äôs disease. There is some evidence that antioxidants
in the diet may delay the onset of the aging process. Ideally, elderly patients
should be routinely screened for diseases associated with old age.

CASE STUDY DISCUSSIONS

CHAPTER 1
DISCUSSION OF CASE STUDY 1.1
The result is most likely to be a transcription error (a ‚Äòblunder‚Äô) since the result
obtained is not compatible with life. Perhaps the true result was 3.5mmol
dm‚Äì3 and not 35mmol dm‚Äì3. In any case, a second K+ determination is
required.

DISCUSSION OF CASE STUDY 1.2
Sensitivity = (95/95 + 5) q 100 = 95%
Specificity = (95/95 + 5) q 100 = 95%
This means that the test will be positive in 95% of patients with prostate
cancer and negative in 95% of people without the disease. That is, 5% of
people with prostate cancer will be missed. An ideal diagnostic test will have
100% sensitivity and specificity but this is rarely achieved.

CHAPTER 2
DISCUSSION OF CASE STUDY 2.1
Brian is most likely in the early stages of a malarial infection. The disease
is caused by several species of Plasmodium. This could be confirmed by a
microscopic examination of a blood smear to show the presence of the
parasite. Brian had traveled to an area where malaria is endemic and he
should have taken appropriate prophylatic drugs.

CHAPTER 3
DISCUSSION OF CASE STUDY 3.1
The infection probably began as folliculitis that became inflamed and
developed into an abscess. The most likely cause consistent with the
appearances of the cultured microorganism is Staphylococcus aureus.
The formation of an abscess restricts the flow of blood to the center of
the infection, reducing the effectiveness of antibiotics, hence the need for
excision and drainage.

*(&

CASE STUDY DISCUSSIONS

DISCUSSION OF CASE STUDY 3.2
Chris had pharyngitis, most likely caused by Streptococcus pyogenes or one
of a number of viruses. Taking throat swabs and culturing the bacterium
can confirm this. Antibiotic treatment is desirable to effect a rapid
cure and prevent the poststreptococcal sequelae, rheumatic fever and
glomerulonephritis.

DISCUSSION OF CASE STUDY 3.3
All the symptoms are typical of whooping cough caused by Bordetella
pertussis.

CHAPTER 4
DISCUSSION OF CASE STUDY 4.1
Immunoglobulin M is always first to be produced in an immune response
and is the predominant antibody of the primary response. The fact that
Maria had only IgM indicates that she has been exposed to this virus for the
first time and is likely to be infected. Such an infection may harm the baby,
particularly as Maria is in the first three months of gestation. Rubella infection
of an early fetus may cause fetal death or the development of congenital
rubella syndrome (CRS), which can cause mental retardation and impaired
sight and hearing. If IgG antibodies had been detected instead of IgM, this
would have indicated that Maria was immune to the virus and that the baby
is unlikely to be exposed to this microorganism. Maria should be counseled
as to the possible harm to her baby. The possibility of a therapeutic abortion
should be discussed.

DISCUSSION OF CASE STUDY 4.2
Electrophoresis of the patient‚Äôs serum, followed by staining of the
electrophorogram, would show a thick band, referred to as a paraprotein, in
the F globulin region (Figure. 1.9). This would indicate myeloma, although
other tests would be needed to confirm the class of antibody being produced.
If this were an IgG myeloma, levels of IgG in the blood would be high, and a
highly sensitive assay would not be required. Radial immunodiffusion using
an antibody to IgG incorporated into the agar could be used to measure IgG
levels. Nephelometry would be quicker and could confirm the IgG secreting
nature of the myeloma.

CHAPTER 5
DISCUSSION OF CASE STUDY 5.1
Repeated bacterial infections suggest a defect in humoral immunity. This
could be transient hypogammaglobulinemia, caused by a delay in the
production of antibodies. However, his small tonsils suggest the more
serious disorder, X-linked agammaglobulinemia (XLA). George needs to
have a full blood count and an assessment of his B lymphocyte count. His
immunoglobulin levels should also be measured to confirm a humoral
deficit. If B cell numbers are greatly reduced, then it is likely that he has XLA.
Molecular biological techniques would confirm mutations of the BTK gene.
If XLA is confirmed, George will need immunological replacement therapy
and antibiotics to control any bacterial infections.

CHAPTER 7

DISCUSSION OF CASE STUDY 5.2
Peter has most likely had an anaphylactic shock reaction to the wasp sting.
It is possible that he has been stung previously, but the speed of the collapse
and the symptoms look likely to be due to a severe Type I hypersensitivity.
Peter should be treated as a medical emergency. Signs of cardiac arrest need
to be checked and Peter needs to be given intramuscular adrenaline. He
would be advised to carry an adrenaline ‚Äògun‚Äô in future.

DISCUSSION OF CASE STUDY 5.3
The tiredness, cold intolerance, weight gain and goiter all point towards an
autoimmune disease of the thyroid. Tests to confirm this diagnosis would
include an indirect immunofluorescence test on her serum, to demonstrate
autoantibodies to thyroid antigens. ELISA tests would demonstrate antibodies
to thyroglobulin, and a biopsy of her thyroid would show infiltration of the
tissue with small lymphocytes. If confirmed, Jane should be treated with
thyroxine to replace the deficiency caused by her autoimmune thyroiditis.

CHAPTER 6
DISCUSSION OF CASE STUDY 6.1
Given Maria is blood group O, she has anti-A antibodies in her plasma.
These will destroy any fetal erythrocytes that enter her circulation. Thus
she is unlikely to become sensitized and there is little chance of her baby
developing hemolytic disease of the newborn. As Marie has never become
sensitized despite several pregnancies, it is likely that each previous fetus
was O negative, A negative or A positive. An O negative fetus would not
sensitize Marie as the Rh group is identical to hers. If a fetus was A negative,
Marie would not become sensitized, and any A cells would be destroyed
immediately by the Anti-A in her plasma. Similarly, any A positive cells would
be destroyed before Marie could be sensitized to the Rh antigen. Marie is
only likely to become sensitized, following the birth of the present fetus, if
that fetus is O positive.

DISCUSSION OF CASE STUDY 6.2
There are two approaches that could be made. First, John should be
tissue typed and a search made on any available bone marrow registries.
Alternatively, John could have an autologous transplant, with tumor cells
eliminated from the bone marrow prior to reinfusion. John would avoid any
likelihood of GVHD with this procedure.

DISCUSSION OF CASE STUDY 6.3
Michael has probably suffered a transfusion related acute lung injury (TRALI),
possibly caused by antileukocyte antibodies in the transfused plasma. This
should not be confused with an anaphylactic reaction (Chapter 5), which
would also cause respiratory distress, but where pulmonary edema would
not be expected.

CHAPTER 7
DISCUSSION OF CASE STUDY 7.1
Sarah could be suffering from some form of diabetes. However, her symptoms
of frequent thirst and urination are not due to diabetes mellitus because of
absence of glycosuria. The clinical features together with a finding of a raised
plasma osmolality combined with a dilute urine, suggests diabetes insipidus.

CZhhVg6]bZY!BVjgZZc9Vlhdc!8]g^hHb^i]:YLddY

*((

CASE STUDY DISCUSSIONS

She was investigated for diabetes insipidus with a fluid deprivation test. At
the end of the test, her plasma osmolality was still high with a low urine
osmolality suggesting diabetes insipidus as she has failed to conserve water
during water deprivation. However, she responded to desmopressin by
producing a more concentrated urine, suggesting a deficiency of ADH rather
than renal insensitivity to ADH. It is most likely that Sarah is suffering from
cranial diabetes insipidus.

DISCUSSION OF CASE STUDY 7.2
Ian has subclinical or compensated hypothyroidism, that is, he is at a
higher risk of developing clinical hypothyroidism. Indeed, some patients
with subclinical or compensated hypothyroidism show clinical features
of hypothyroidism. An increased release of TSH is required to stimulate
the release of thyroid hormones from a deteriorating thyroid gland. Ian‚Äôs
condition should be reviewed every few months and antibodies against his
thyroid gland should be measured to detect whether there is an autoimmune
cause.

DISCUSSION OF CASE STUDY 7.3
Amelia has hyponatremia with hyperkalemia. This indicates deficiency of
mineralocorticoids that is typical of Addison‚Äôs disease. The clinical features
are also consistent with Addison‚Äôs disease and Amelia has presented with an
adrenal crisis. Amelia is dehydrated and this explains the high serum urea
caused by a low glomerular filtration rate. She should be treated by correcting
her fluid balance and then placing her on a steroid regimen that includes
hydrocortisone and fludrocortisone.

DISCUSSION OF CASE STUDY 7.4
Jaclyn is a type 1 diabetic and presented with diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), a
medical emergency. This has probably occurred because Jaclyn has failed to
take her insulin therapy although it may be that it has been precipitated by
infections or even excessive stress. An overview of DKA is provided in Figure
7.25. The patient should be treated immediately. This will include infusions
of isotonic saline to restore blood volume, insulin infusions to reduce
hyperglycemia, K+ supplements to replace lost K+ and possibly hydrogen
carbonate infusions to alleviate the severe acidosis present in this case.

DISCUSSION OF CASE STUDY 7.5
Rachel‚Äôs symptoms indicate a possible PCOS. The moderate increase in
testosterone combined with a raised LH and typical clinical findings are
strongly supportive of this diagnosis. The pathogenesis of this condition is
unknown. Normal ovaries synthesize androgens, such as testosterone and
androstenedione. In PCOS their secretion increases and in the liver and
adipose tissue they are converted to estrogens that inhibit release of FSH
and prevent ovulation. Luteinizing hormone release is stimulated and in turn
stimulates further release of androgens leading to hirsutism.

CHAPTER 8
DISCUSSION OF CASE STUDY 8.1
Ted has acute renal failure as a result of his accident. This acute renal failure
may have been caused by release of myoglobin from crushed muscles together
with loss of blood. This explains the high serum concentration of urea and its
osmolality. The hyperkalemia is a result of renal failure but possibly also due

*()

W^dad\nd[Y^hZVhZ

CHAPTER 10

to release of K+ from damaged tissues. The low HCO3‚Äì reflects the metabolic
acidosis that is a feature of acute renal failure.

DISCUSSION OF CASE STUDY 8.2
Arnie suffers from hypomagnesemia. The low serum K+ may reflect its loss in
diarrhea. Arnold presents with symptoms typical of hypocalcemia even though
his total serum Ca2+ is normal. Patients with symptoms of hypocalcemia, but
normal serum Ca 2+, should be investigated for hypomagnesemia. Arnold was
treated with magnesium supplements given parenterally rather than orally
because of his diarrhea and his symptoms resolved.

DISCUSSION OF CASE STUDY 8.3
John presents with nocturnal, acute, severe pain in the large toe together
with signs of inflammation: all classical features of gout. The finding of
hyperuricemia supports this diagnosis. However, some patients with gout
have a normal serum urate concentration. The toe joint should be aspirated
and examined for urate crystals. The aspirate should also be examined in
a microbiology laboratory to exclude the possibility of an infection. John
should be treated with indomethacin until his symptoms resolve. He should
be advised to reduce his dietary intake of protein and alcohol.

CHAPTER 9
DISCUSSION OF CASE STUDY 9.1
John is suffering from a partially compensated metabolic alkalosis. The
low blood H+ concentration indicates an alkalosis while the high HCO3‚Äì is
indicative of metabolic alkalosis. This alkalosis is associated with a loss of
acid from the stomach by vomiting, hence the dyspepsia. John will have
involuntarily reduced his ventilation rate to correct the alkalosis by increasing
blood PCO2 and so there has been a partial respiratory compensation.

DISCUSSION OF CASE STUDY 9.2
Tom‚Äôs low [H+] indicates alkalosis. Given the low PCO2, this is a respiratory
alkalosis probably caused by his asthmatic attack. The HCO3‚Äì is still within
the reference range so the condition is uncompensated. This is consistent
with the slow nature of renal compensation.

DISCUSSION OF CASE STUDY 9.3
Terry has a high H+ which is indicative of an acidosis. The patient has a low
HCO3‚Äì which is indicative of a metabolic acidosis. His body has attempted to
correct the acidosis by respiratory compensation causing hyperventilation
leading to a reduced PCO2. Thus Terry has a partially compensated metabolic
acidosis.

CHAPTER 10
DISCUSSION OF CASE STUDY 10.1
Andrew is obese with a BMI of 31.72 kg m‚Äì2. Health risks of obesity include
heart disease, hypertension and type 2 diabetes (Figure 10.25 and Table
10.7). His total cholesterol concentration is acceptable but not desirable. The
triacylglycerol concentration is increased while the HDL concentration is
low, increasing the risk of heart disease. His blood pressure is also relatively
high. Since Andrew has a family history of heart disease, he would be strongly

CZhhVg6]bZY!BVjgZZc9Vlhdc!8]g^hHb^i]:YLddY

*(*

CASE STUDY DISCUSSIONS

advised to eat a more appropriate diet including oily fish and vitamin rich
food, exercise regularly and stop smoking.

DISCUSSION OF CASE STUDY 10.2
Emily‚Äôs ideal weight for her height is 120 pounds, so she is only approximately
8% below this value. Her blood glucose is only slightly reduced but the
ketone body content, indicative of a switch to fat metabolism (Chapter 7),
is increased although not excessively. However, given her dieting, exercising
and the evidence of a preoccupation with her weight, it is possible that
Emily is starting to suffer from AN, although she should be examined to
eliminate any other possible clinical causes, such as a neoplasm. She should
receive specialized counseling, especially in nutrition and for any emotional
problems perhaps related to academic issues that have led to her anorexic
behavior. Her family should be involved whenever possible.

DISCUSSION OF CASE STUDY 10.3
Erythrocyte transketolase activity depends upon the thiamin derived
coenzyme, TPP. The activation coefficient of transketolase activity in John‚Äôs
sample was about 23% which is evidence for a moderate to approaching
severe deficiency. John should be placed on thiamin, and probably other
vitamin, supplements. Appropriate nutritional advice should also be given to
the nursing home.

CHAPTER 11
DISCUSSION OF CASE STUDY 11.1
Alice has celiac disease where the degree of malabsorption depends on
the severity of the disease. Malabsorption of fat, protein and iron gave rise
to her steatorrhea, hypoalbuminemia and anemia respectively. The xylose
absorption test indicates defective carbohydrate absorption. The jejunal
biopsy confirms diagnosis of celiac disease. Alice should be placed on a
gluten-free diet and her symptoms should, hopefully, improve within three
weeks.

DISCUSSION OF CASE STUDY 11.2
The urine bilirubin is negative and this means that the excess bilirubin in
serum must be unconjugated otherwise it would be in a water-soluble form
and lost in the urine. Normal AST and ALP activities suggest an absence
of hepatocellular damage. Hemolysis cannot be the cause of the raised
bilirubin as the hemoglobin concentration and reticulocyte count are both
within their reference ranges. It is likely that Sadaf is suffering from Gilbert‚Äôs
syndrome where there is reduced activity of UDP-glucuronyltransferase and
often decreased uptake of unconjugated bilirubin by liver cells. Gilbert‚Äôs
disease is characterized by mild jaundice, which is consistent with the
clinical findings.

DISCUSSION OF CASE STUDY 11.3
The very high amylase activity suggests acute pancreatitis and this is
consistent with the clinical findings. Hyperglycemia occurs quite often in
acute pancreatitis but is transient in nature. Mark has a high serum urea
concentration. This is due to shock where the reduced blood flow to the
kidneys gives a reduced GFR and a resultant high serum urea concentration.

CHAPTER 12
DISCUSSION OF CASE STUDY 12.1
Helen has taken an overdose of aspirin. She has a metabolic acidosis being
compensated by the hyperventilation. Initially, such patients present with
a respiratory alkalosis and this is followed by a metabolic acidosis. The
prothrombin time (Chapter 13) is prolonged due to decreased hepatic
activation of clotting factors. Helen‚Äôs treatment will be supportive and may
include gastric lavage for up to 24 h after ingestion, possibly oral activated
charcoal and infusions of sodium hydrogen carbonate to promote excretion
of salicylate. Hemodialysis is not required, given the concentration of
salicylate in Helen‚Äôs plasma.

DISCUSSION OF CASE STUDY 12.2
Olga had taken a paracetamol overdose with vodka. Liver function tests were
not abnormal on admission. The transient elevation of the plasma alanine
aminotransferase suggests that some mild degree of liver damage had taken
place. The time of the paracetamol overdose was not known accurately.
Olga was treated with intravenous N-acetylcysteine. She should also receive
counseling regarding the problems that led to the attempted suicide.

DISCUSSION OF CASE STUDY 12.3
Edward‚Äôs abnormal clotting time and high bilirubin and alkaline phosphatase
levels indicate a serious derangement of liver function. He probably has
advanced cirrhosis of the liver. Extensive fibrosis of the liver has distorted
the intraheptic bilary tree increasing the bilirubin and alkaline phosphatase
levels (whose synthesis is induced by alcohol). F-glutamyltransferase activity
is frequently used as a marker for excessive alcohol consumption since its
synthesis is also induced by alcohol. However, the test is not specific since
F-glutamyltransferase can also be induced by a number of drugs including
some antiepileptics and oral contraceptives. Hyperbilirubinemia is not always
a feature of chronic liver disease and can occur in other disease states.
Maureen would seem to have moderate alcoholic liver disease but she
shows a somewhat different pattern in the liver function tests. Her GGT
level is clearly increased and the transaminases are also abnormal but her
bilirubin and alkaline phosphatase levels are only slightly above normal.
Even relatively moderate levels of alcohol can produce structural changes in
the liver cells including accumulation of fatty droplets, proliferation of the
endoplasmic reticulum and enlargement of the mitochondria.

DISCUSSION OF CASE STUDY 12.4
The high [H+] and low HCO3‚Äì indicate a metabolic acidosis (Chapter 9) due
to increased production of lactate from poisoning with carbon monoxide.
Carbon monoxide binds more avidly to hemoglobin than oxygen and
decreases the ability of hemoglobin to transport oxygen. John was
unconscious because of reduced delivery of oxygen to his brain. John can be
treated with hyperbaric oxygen. The high PO2 causes displacement of carbon
monoxide from hemoglobin.

CHAPTER 13
DISCUSSION OF CASE STUDY 13.1
Daniel clearly has sickle cell anemia and is homozygous for the condition.
Both parents are heterozygotes and carry the sickle cell trait. Sickle cell
individuals experience severe pain and need to be given strong painkillers.

CASE STUDY DISCUSSIONS

Blood transfusions can help but these will lead to iron overload unless other
means, such as iron chelating drugs, are used to reduce the iron load. Other
treatments are available which aim to increase the amount of HbF in the
blood. The chance of a further child having the homozygous condition is one
in four, and the chance of their being a heterozygote one in two.

DISCUSSION OF CASE STUDY 13.2
The MCV is 100 fdm3 (reference 76‚Äì96 fdm3) therefore high; MCH is 22.2 pg
cell‚Äì1 (26‚Äì33 pg cell‚Äì1) and low; the MCHC is 222 g dm‚Äì3 cells (310‚Äì350 g
dm‚Äì3 cells) and also low. The high MCV and low primary indices indicate
a macrocytic anemia. The presence of basophilic megaloblasts suggests
pernicious anemia from lack of vitamin B12 or folate. This is probably due
to atrophy of the gastric mucosa resulting in a lack of the glycoprotein,
intrinsic factor, which enables vitamin B12 to be absorbed and also protects
the vitamin from destruction in the gastrointestinal system. Hence Bill is
vitamin B12 deficient and cannot therefore make DNA and consequently new
erythrocytes (failure of erythropoiesis). The sore tongue, difficulties with
swallowing, and epigastric pain are possibly related to an abnormality in the
upper gastrointestinal system. A course of injections of vitamin B12 should
lead a to complete remission of the condition and restoration of a normal
blood picture.

DISCUSSION OF CASE STUDY 13.3
DNA analysis could be carried out (Figure 13.23). The chances of any of
their children being homozygous for HbS would be 25%, and 50% for the
heterozygous state.

CHAPTER 14
DISCUSSION OF CASE STUDY 14.1
Jim has hypercholesterolemia. This is due to hypothyroidism as indicated
by the high TSH concentration (Chapter 7). The hypercholesterolemia is
corrected by treatment of the underlying hypothyroidism.

DISCUSSION OF CASE STUDY 14.2
The modest rise in CK was probably due to the heavy fall, resulting in
bruising and damage to muscle tissues, which then fell sharply. In myocardial
infarctions, AST normally peaks 10 to 100-fold after 20‚Äì30 h and then declines
to normal levels within two to six days, but this did not occur here. There is
therefore no evidence for a myocardial infarction.

DISCUSSION OF CASE STUDY 14.3
Roger has high LDL cholesterol and together with clinical features of corneal
arcus and xanthomata, which are diagnostic of familial hypercholesterolemia.
Roger should be treated with lipid lowering drugs as well as a modified diet.

CHAPTER 15
DISCUSSION OF CASE STUDY 15.1
Christine is suffering from PKU hence the high serum concentration
of phenylalanine. She should be placed on a diet low in phenylalanine.
However, this diet must contain adequate amounts of tyrosine. Phenylalanine
is broken down into several metabolites and these are lost in the urine and
produce the characteristic odor. If Christine is not treated immediately, she

*(-

W^dad\nd[Y^hZVhZ

CHAPTER 17

may suffer irreversible brain damage resulting in a very low IQ. In addition,
she will develop other clinical features characteristic of PKU, such as, a pale
skin, blonde hair and blue eyes.

DISCUSSION OF CASE STUDY 15.2
The karyogram shows trisomy 21, the commonest cause of Down syndrome
(Box 15.4). Its frequency increases substantially in the fetuses of older women.
It is essential to obtain a karyogram of the child to determine whether the
cause is a Robertsonian translocation to aid genetic counseling, because it
tends to run in families, that is it is hereditable, while trisomy 21 is sporadic
in occurrence. The advice to Jane would be that her son is not a familial
Down syndrome child. However, if she wishes to have another child, she has
a greater risk of carrying a Down syndrome child than younger mothers and
so she should have cytogenetic testing of the baby during pregnancy.

CHAPTER 16
DISCUSSION OF CASE STUDY 16.1
A diagnosis of cystic fibrosis is usually made following a sweat test where
there is a high concentration of chloride, since 99% of cystic fibrosis patients
have concentrations of Cl‚Äì in their sweat exceeding 70 mmol dm‚Äì3. This test
could be performed on the siblings but cannot detect heterozygous carriers.
DNA diagnosis would detect children with cystic fibrosis and those who are
heterozygous carriers.

DISCUSSION OF CASE STUDY 16.2
Janice is suffering from adult, type 1, Gaucher‚Äôs disease. If untreated she will
become anemic, her hepatosplenomegaly will increase and bouts of severe
generalized pain in the body and limbs will occur with more intensity and
frequency. Degeneration of vertebral bodies and hip joints are common
leading to distortion of the spine and the need for hip replacement surgery.
She can expect bouts of anemia and recurrent pulmonary infections.
Treatment should consist of counseling to explain the nature of the disease,
analgesics for the bone pains, blood transfusions to relieve the anemia and
physiotherapy to keep the body mobile. Regular exercise, such as walking
and swimming, should be encouraged. The major treatment should be
intravenous enzyme therapy using A glucocerebrosidase to prevent the
visceral complications. With appropriate treatment, Janice can expect a life
of reasonable quality and length.

CHAPTER 17
DISCUSSION OF CASE STUDY 17.1
It is unlikely that Chris has cancer but rather benign prostate hyperplasia, as
indicated by the rectal examination. The PSA is slightly elevated. It would be
useful to monitor the level over a period of time as increasing concentrations
would require further investigation to ensure that the condition was not
becoming cancerous. If the benign hyperplasia begins to cause too much
discomfort, it may be necessary to hospitalize Chris for treatment.

DISCUSSION OF CASE STUDY 17.2
From Rebecca‚Äôs history, her consultant might be expecting to see a shadow
on the lung indicative of carcinoma. The hemoptysis is a strong indicator,
though some infectious diseases, such as tuberculosis, might also have this
effect. Rebecca has smoked for 30 years and although she stopped smoking

CASE STUDY DISCUSSIONS

two years ago she still has a higher risk of lung cancer than somebody
who has not smoked. Since she gave up smoking she would still have been
passively inhaling smoke from her husband‚Äôs cigarettes.

DISCUSSION OF CASE STUDY 17.3
Fatigue and lethargy in an adolescent boy is not in itself unusual but the
leukocytosis might indicate an infectious disease such as glandular fever.
The bruising and anemia are more worrying signs, especially as blast cells
were seen, and may well indicate that Giles has developed a leukemia. Acute
lymphoblastic leukemia is more common in children than adults and could
be confirmed by microscopic examination of a sample of his bone marrow.
Further tests include immunohistochemical staining of leukocytes in order
to ascertain whether ALL is present and if it is a B or a T cell leukemia.

CHAPTER 18
DISCUSSION OF CASE STUDY 18.1
The high random plasma glucose is diagnostic of diabetes mellitus type 2.
The classic symptoms of polyuria and polydipsia of diabetes are not always
present in the elderly where the renal threshold for glucose is often elevated
due to a decline in the glomerular filtration rate. This may be due to declining
renal function with age, but can be made worse by the presence of renal
failure, which is a chronic complication of diabetes.

DISCUSSION OF CASE STUDY 18.2
Harry is possibly (probably?) suffering from early stage Alzheimer‚Äôs disease.
He and his family should be advised of this and its consequences. He could
be treated with acetylcholinesterase inhibitor therapy but this will only delay
the progress of the symptoms.

Endotoxins

Exotoxins

Produced by Gram negative
bacteria only.

exotoxins are proteins secreted by both
Gram positive and negative bacteria.

Consist of portions of
lipopolysaccharides embedded
in the outer wall membrane.

three groups:
1) damage membranes, causing the cell to lose water and
ions and disrupt ion gradients across the membrane;
2) those with speciÔ¨Åc host targets ‚Äì wide variety of types;
3) superantigens synthesized by Gram-positive pathogens
stimulate the immune system by binding MHC class II
molecules and TH cell receptors.

Damage caused varies with the
susceptibility of the host.
Endotoxins stimulate host cells
to release pyrogens therefore
fever is a common outcome.
Endotoxic shock can result.

Congenital hypothyroidism is common with an incidence of one in
3500 newborns in the UK. Clinical evidence at birth that the child is
abnormal is often absent. If the condition is not detected and treated,
then the affected children suffer from cretinism which is characterized
by irreversible brain damage, short stature, deafness and neurological
signs.

After a couple of days the kidneys adapt to decreased water intake
and conserve water and electrolytes. However, insensible loss of
some water does occur and both ECF and ICF values decline. As
a consequence Robin will have hypernatremia. The decline in ECF
volume will reach a critical level and will be unable to maintain blood
circulation resulting in death. It is not a good idea to drink seawater
as this contains high concentrations of salt (450 mmol dm‚Äì3) and Mg2+
(50 mmol dm‚Äì3) that aggravate the hypernatremia. The high salt can
induce vomiting whereas the high Mg2+ may cause diarrhea and so
further Ô¨Çuid loss.

Hypercalcemia commonly occurs in tumors that metastasize to the
bones, such as those of the lung, breast and kidneys. Hypercalcemia

W^dad\nd[Y^hZVhZ

and prostaglandin synthesis. Also, tumors such as squamous cell
carcinomas of the lungs, may produce PTHrp that has PTH like activity
leading to hypercalcemia.

The most likely diagnosis is secondary acquired lactose
intolerance following damage to the intestinal mucosa by the
viral attack.
Tests include a lactose-free diet, hydrogen breath test, the stool
acidity test and lactose tolerance test. A biopsy of the mucosa
could be taken and tested for lactase activity if necessary. Since
the symptoms are common to numerous other GIT conditions,
care must be taken with the diagnosis.
Qiuyu‚Äôs treatment should be a lactose-free diet that should
quickly relieve her symptoms.

4.

Aldehyde will build up in hepatocytes and blood following the
oxidation of ethanol. This will produce a range of unpleasant
symptoms in the patient (headaches, nausea, vomiting etc.) that
will eventually be associated with the use of alcoholic drinks and so
produce a deterrent effect.

5.

Many actions of ethanol may be attributed to its effects in disordering
membranes, and changes in membrane Ô¨Çuidity can affect membranebound enzymes such as the Na+/K+-ATPase and adenylate cyclase. It

W^dad\nd[Y^hZVhZ

CHAPTER 13

also affects several neurotransmitter systems in the brain including
dopamine, GABA, glutamate, serotonin, adenosine, noradrenaline
and opioid peptides. Many drugs are metabolized, in part, by the
P-450 system and consequently there may be competition between
ethanol and other drugs, such as barbiturates, whose hydroxylation
at the smooth endoplasmic reticulum is inhibited. This increases and
prolongs their action.
6.

Many cosmetics obtained outside the UK contain lead and this is
true for surma. Children using such cosmetics often develop lead
poisoning. Investigations should include determining the levels of lead
in whole blood and precursors of heme in erythrocytes.

The production of erythrocyte cell precursors has been stimulated by
Elsa‚Äôs severe anemia. As a result, the bone marrow spaces expanded
in all areas of the skeleton leading to the deformities. It is these within
the spine that caused compression of the spinal cord itself and the
pain. Local irradiation may bring immediate relief. In addition, blood
transfusions must be given to keep the Hb at near normal levels.

7.

When the lining of a blood vessel is damaged, collagen Ô¨Åbers are
exposed and circulating platelets stick to them. This causes them to
degranulate releasing serotonin and ADP and other active biological
molecules. Serotonin causes blood vessels to constrict restricting
blood Ô¨Çow until clotting takes place. Clumping of platelets is triggered
by ADP and the clump prevents further blood loss. The blood clotting
cascade is then initiated.

It is likely that Barry has had a myocardial infarction. However,
his chest pain has only lasted for 30 min so he will not show any

7.

Lowering the amount of carbohydrate in the diet may decrease
triacylglycerol and cholesterol levels, because the triacylglycerols in
the VLDL particles are synthesized by the liver mainly from dietary
carbohydrate. The VLDL particle secreted into the blood will, of
course, carry cholesterol.

The children have equal chances of receiving the stable or mutant
gene. Fifty percent of female children will be affected. Most of the

5.

In autosomal dominant syndromes an affected father would pass it on
to an average of 50% of his sons and daughters. X-linked dominant
syndromes do not show male-to-male transmission but all the
daughters of an affected father would show the syndrome. If many
families were studied, the ratios of affected males to females for an
autosomal dominant would be 1:1, but 1:2 for X-linked dominant
syndromes since males have only half the chance of inheriting a
defective X chromosome.

Proteins become glycated on exposure to reducing sugars. These
glycated proteins undergo further reaction forming Ô¨Çuorescent, crosslinked structures called advanced glycation end products (AGEs).
These are formed irreversibly and accumulate on long-lived proteins,
for example, collagen and as the body ages such proteins in particular
become cross-linked. This is believed to contribute towards the aging
process.
