1.3 Compounds And Molecules
A molecule is formed when two or more atoms join together. A compound is formed
when two or than two diﬀerent elements combine in a ﬁxed ratio by mass. Note that some
atoms are never found alone. For example oxygen is always found as molecules of 2 oxygen
atoms (represented as O2 ).
The table below gives some common compounds.

1.4 Chemical Reactions
Reactions occur when atoms combine or separate from other atoms. In the process new
products with diﬀerent chemical properties are formed.
Chemical reactions can be represented by chemical equations . The starting atoms or
compounds are usually put on the left-hand side of the equation and the products on the
right-hand side.
For example
• H2 O + CO2 gives H2 CO3
• Water + Carbon dioxide gives Carbonic acid

1.5 Ionization
When some atoms dissolve in water they become charged particles called ions . Some
become positively charged ions and others negatively charged. Ions may have one, two or
sometimes three charges.

Positive and negative ions attract one another to hold compounds together.
Ions are important in cells because they conduct electricity when dissolved in water. Substances that ionise in this way are known as electrolytes .
The molecules in an animal’s body fall into two groups: inorganic compounds and
organic compounds . The diﬀerence between these is that the ﬁrst type does not contain
carbon and the second type does.

1.6 Organic And Inorganic Compounds
Inorganic compounds include water, sodium chloride, potassium hydroxide and calcium
phosphate.
Water is the most abundant inorganic compound, making up over 60% of the volume of
cells and over 90% of body ﬂuids like blood. Many substances dissolve in water and all
the chemical reactions that take place in the body do so when dissolved in water. Other
inorganic molecules help keep the acid/base balance ( pH ) and concentration of the
blood and other body ﬂuids stable (see Chapter 8).
Organic compounds include carbohydrates, proteins and fats . All organic molecules
contain carbon atoms and they tend to be larger and more complex molecules than inorganic
ones. This is largely because each carbon atom can link with four other atoms. Organic
compounds can therefore consist of from one to many thousands of carbon atoms joined to
form chains, branched chains and rings (see diagram below). All organic compounds also
contain hydrogen and they may also contain other elements.
Figure 2

1.7 Carbohydrates
The name “carbohydrate” tells you something about the composition of these “hydrated carbon” compounds. They contain carbon, hydrogen and oxygen and like water (H2 O), there

5

Chemicals
are always twice as many hydrogen atoms as oxygen atoms in each molecule. Carbohydrates are a large and diverse group that includes sugars, starches, glycogen and cellulose.
Carbohydrates in the diet supply an animal with much of its energy and in the animal’s
body, they transport and store energy.
Carbohydrates are divided into three major groups based on size: monosaccharides (single
sugars), disaccharides (double sugars) and polysaccharides (multi sugars).
Monosaccharides are the smallest carbohydrate molecules. The most important monosaccharide is glucose which supplies much of the energy in the cell. It consists of a ring of 6
carbon atoms with oxygen and hydrogen atoms attached.
Disaccharides are formed when 2 monosaccharides join together. Sucrose (table sugar),
maltose, and lactose (milk sugar), are three important disaccharides. They are broken down
to monosaccharides by digestive enzymes in the gut.
Polysaccharides like starch, glycogen and cellulose are formed by tens or hundreds of
monosaccharides linking together. Unlike mono- and di-saccharides, polysaccharides are
not sweet to taste and most do not dissolve in water.

• Starch is the main molecule in which plants store the energy gained from the sun. It is
found in grains like barley and roots like potatoes.
• Glycogen , the polysaccharide used by animals to store energy, is found in the liver
and the muscles that move the skeleton.
• Cellulose forms the rigid cell walls of plants. Its structure is similar to glycogen, but
it can’t be digested by mammals. Cows and horses can eat cellulose with the help of
bacteria which live in specialised parts of their gut.

Fats

1.8 Fats
Fats or lipids are important in the plasma membrane around cells and form the insulating
fat layer under the skin. They are also a highly concentrated source of energy, and when
eaten in the diet provide more than twice as much energy per gram as either carbohydrates
or proteins.
Like carbohydrates fats contain carbon, hydrogen and oxygen, but unlike them, there is no
particular relationship between the number of hydrogen and oxygen atoms.
The fats and oils animals eat in their diets are called triglycerides orneutral fats .
The building blocks of triglycerides are 3 fatty acids attached to a backbone of glycerol
(glycerine ). When fats are eaten the digestive enzymes break down the molecules into
separate fatty acids and glycerol again.
Fatty acids are divided into two kinds: saturated and unsaturated fatty acids depending on how much hydrogen they contain. The fat found in animals bodies and in dairy
products contains mainly saturated fatty acids and tends to be solid at room temperature.
Fish and poultry fats and plant oils contain mostly unsaturated fatty acids and are more
liquid at room temperature.
Phospholipids are lipids that contain a phosphate group. They are important in the
plasma membrane of the cell.

1.9 Proteins
Proteins are the third main group of organic compounds in the cell - in fact if you dried
out a cell you would ﬁnd that about 2/3 of the dry dust you were left with would consist of
protein. Like carbohydrates and fats, proteins contain C, H and O but they all also contain
nitrogen . Many also contain sulphur and phosphorus.
In the cell, proteins are an important part of the plasma membrane of the cell, but their
most essential role is as enzymes . These are molecules that act as biological catalysts and

8

Proteins
are necessary for biochemical reactions to proceed. Protein is also found as keratin in the
skin, feathers and hair, in muscles, as well as in antibodies and some hormones.
Proteins are built up of long chains of smaller molecules called amino acids . There are
20 common types of amino acid and diﬀerent numbers of these arranged in diﬀerent orders
create the multitude of individual proteins that exist in an animal’s body.
Long chains of amino acids often link with other amino acid chains and the resulting protein
molecule may twist, spiral and fold up to make a complex 3-dimensional shape. As an
example, see the diagram of the protein lysozyme below. Believe it or not, this is a small
and relatively simple protein.

Figure 6

Chemicals
It is this shape that determines how proteins behave in cells, particularly when they are
acting as enzymes. If for any reason this shape is altered, the protein stops working. This
is what happens if proteins are heated or put in a solution that is too acidic or alkaline.
Think what happens to the “white’ ” of an egg when it is cooked. The “white” contains
the protein albumin, which is changed or “denatured ” permanently by cooking. The
catastrophic eﬀect that heat has on enzymes is one of the reasons animals die if exposed to
high temperatures.
In the animal’s diet, proteins are found in meat (muscle), dairy products, seeds, nuts and
legumes like soya. When the enzymes in the gut digest proteins they break them down into
the separate amino acids, which are small enough to be absorbed into the blood.

1.10 Summary
• Ions are charged particles, and electrolytes are solutions of ions in water.
• Carbohydrates are made of carbon with hydrogen and oxygen (in the same ratio as
water) linked together. The cell mainly uses carbohydrates for energy.
• Fats are also made of carbon, hydrogen and oxygen. They are a powerful energy source,
and are also used for insulation.
• Proteins are the building materials of the body, and as enzymes make cell reactions
happen. They contain nitrogen as well as carbon, hydrogen and oxygen.

Classiﬁcation

2.1 Objectives
After completing this section, you should know:
• how to write the scientiﬁc name of animals correctly
• know that animals belong to the Animal kingdom and that this is divided into phyla,
classes, orders, families
• know the deﬁnition of a species
• know the phylum and class of the more common animals dealt with in this course
Classiﬁcation is the process used by scientists to make sense of the 1.5 million or so
diﬀerent kinds of living organisms on the planet. It does this by describing, naming and
placing them in diﬀerent groups. As veterinary nurses you are mainly concerned with
the Animal Kingdom but don’t forget that animals rely on the Plant Kingdom for food
to survive. Also many diseases that animals are aﬀected by are members of the other
Kingdoms -- fungi, bacteria and single celled animals.

2.2 Naming And Classifying Animals
There are more than 1.5 million diﬀerent kinds of living organism on Earth ranging from
small and simple bacteria to large, complex mammals. From the earliest time that humans
have studied the natural world they have named these living organisms and placed them in
diﬀerent groups on the basis of their similarities and diﬀerences.

2.3 Naming Animals
Of course we know what a cat, a dog and a whale are but, in some situations using the
common names for animals can be confusing. Problems arise because people in diﬀerent
countries, and even sometimes in the same country, have diﬀerent common names for the
same animals. For example a cat can be a chat, a Katze, gato, katt, or a moggie, depending
on which language you use. To add to the confusion sometimes the same name is used
for diﬀerent animals. For example, the name ‘gopher’ is used for ground squirrels, rodents
(pocket gophers), for moles and in the south-eastern United States for a turtle. This is
the reason why all animals have been given an oﬃcial scientiﬁc or binomial name .
Unfortunately these names are always in Latin. For example:
•
•
•
•

Common rat: Rattus rattus
Human: Homo sapiens
Domestic cat: Felis domesticus
Domestic dog: Canis familiaris

As you can see from the above there are certain rules about writing scientiﬁc names:
•
•
•
•

14

They always have 2 parts to them.
The ﬁrst part is the genus name and is always written with a capital ﬁrst letter.
The second name is the species name and is always written in lower case .
The name is always underlined or printed in italics .

Classiﬁcation Of Living Organisms
The ﬁrst time you refer to an organism you should write the whole name in full. If you need
to keep referring to the same organism you can then abbreviate the genus name to just the
initial. Thus “Canis familiaris ” becomes “C. familiaris ” the second and subsequent times
you refer to it.

2.4 Classiﬁcation Of Living Organisms
To make some sense of the multitude of living organisms they have been placed in diﬀerent
groups. The method that has been agreed by biologists for doing this is called the classiﬁcation system . The system is based on the assumption that the process of evolution
has, over the millennia, brought about slow changes that have converted simple one-celled
organisms to complex multi-celled ones and generated the earth’s incredible diversity of life
forms. The classiﬁcation system attempts to reﬂect the evolutionary relationships between
organisms.
Initially this classiﬁcation was based only on the appearance of the organism. However, the
development of new techniques has advanced our scientiﬁc knowledge. The light microscope
and later the electron microscope have enabled us to view the smallest structures, and now
techniques for comparing DNA have begun to clarify still further the relationships between
organisms. In the light of the advances in knowledge the classiﬁcation has undergone
numerous revisions over time.
At present most biologists divide the living world into 5 kingdoms, namely:
•
•
•
•
•

bacteria
protists
fungi
plants
animal

We are concerned here almost entirely with the Animal Kingdom . However, we must
not forget that bacteria, protists, and fungi cause many of the serious diseases that affect animals, and all animals rely either directly or indirectly on the plant world for their
nourishment.

2.5 The Animal Kingdom
So what are animals? If we were suddenly confronted with an animal we had never seen in
our lives before, how would we know it was not a plant or even a fungus? We all intuitively
know part of the answer to this.
Animals:
•
•
•
•

eat organic material (plants or other animals)
move to ﬁnd food
take the food into their bodies and then digest it
and most reproduce by fertilizing eggs by sperm

15

Classiﬁcation
If you were tempted to add that animals are furry, run around on four legs and give birth to
young that they feed on milk you were thinking only of mammals and forgetting temporarily
that frogs, snakes and crocodiles, birds as well as ﬁsh, are also animals.
These are all members of the group called the vertebrates (or animals with a backbone)
and mammals make up only about 8% of this group. The diagram on the next page shows
the percentage of the diﬀerent kinds of vertebrates.

Figure 8

However, the term animal includes much more than just the Vertebrates. In fact this group
makes up only a very small portion of all animals. Take a look at the diagram below, which
shows the size of the diﬀerent groups of animals in the Animal Kingdom as proportions of the
total number of diﬀerent animal species. Notice the small size of the segment representing

16

The Classiﬁcation Of Vertebrates
vertebrates! All the other animals in the Animal Kingdom are animals with no backbone,
or invertebrates . This includes the worms, sea anemones, starﬁsh, snails, crabs, spiders
and insects. As more than 90% of the invertebrates are insects, no wonder people worry
that insects may take over the world one day!

Figure 9

2.6 The Classiﬁcation Of Vertebrates
As we have seen above the Vertebrates are divided into 5 groups or classes namely:
•
•
•
•
•

Fish
Amphibia (frogs and toads)
Reptiles (snakes and crocodiles)
Birds
Mammals

These classes are all based on similarities. For instance all mammals have a similar skeleton,
hair on their bodies, are warm bodied and suckle their young.
The class Mammalia (the mammals) contains 3 subclasses :
• Duck billed platypus and the spiny anteater
• Marsupials (animals like the kangaroo with pouches)
• True mammals (with a placenta)
Within the subclass containing the true mammals, there are groupings called orders that
contain mammals that are more closely similar or related, than others. Examples of six
mammalian orders are given below:
•
•
•
•
•
•

Rodents (Rodentia) (rats and mice)
Carnivores (Carnivora) (cats, dogs, bears and seals)
Even-toed grazers (Artiodactyla) (pigs, sheep, cattle, antelopes)
Odd-toed grazers (Perissodactyla) (horses, donkeys, zebras)
Marine mammals (Cetacea) (whales, sea cows)
Primates (monkeys, apes, humans)

17

Classiﬁcation
Within each order there are various families . For example within the carnivore mammals
are the families:
• Canidae (dog-like carnivores)
• Felidae (cat-like carnivores)
Even at this point it is possible to ﬁnd groupings that are more closely related than others.
These groups are called genera (singular genus). For instance within the cat family Felidae
is the genus Felis containing the cats, as well as genera containing panthers, lynxes, and
sabre toothed tigers!
The ﬁnal groups within the system are the species . The deﬁnition of a species is a group
of animals that can mate successfully and produce fertile oﬀspring . This means
that all domestic cats belong to the species Felis domesticus , because all breeds of cat
whether Siamese, Manx or ordinary House hold cat can cross breed. However, domestic
cats can not mate successfully with lions, tigers or jaguars, so these are placed in separate
species, e.g. Felis leo, Felis tigris and Felis onca .
Even within the same species, there can be animals with quite wide variations in appearance
that still breed successfully. We call these diﬀerent breeds, races or varieties . For
example there are many diﬀerent breeds of dogs from Dalmatian to Chihuahua and of
cats, from Siamese to Manx and domestic short-hairs, but all can cross breed. Often these
breeds have been produced byselective breeding but varieties can arise in the wild when
groups of animals are separated by a mountain range or sea and have developed diﬀerent
characteristics over long periods of time.
To summarise, the classiﬁcation system consists of:
The A nimal K ingdom which is divided into
P hyla which are divided into
C lasses which are divided into
O rders which are divided into
F amilies which are divided into
G enera which are divided into
S pecies.
“Kings Play Cricket On Flat Green Surfaces ” OR “Kindly Professors Cannot
Often Fail Good Students ” are just two of the phrases students use to remind themselves
of the order of these categories - on the other hand you might like to invent your own.

2.7 Summary
• The scientiﬁc name of an animal has two parts, the genus and the species , and must
be written in italics or underlined .
• Animals are divided into vertebrates and invertebrates .
• The classiﬁcation system has groupings called phyla , classes , orders , families ,
genera and species .

sperm are formed

3.2 The Cell

Figure 11

Diagram 3.1 : A variety of animal cells

The cell is the basic building block of living organisms. Bacteria and the parasite that
causes malaria consist of single cells, while plants and animals are made up of trillions of
cells. Most cells are spherical or cube shaped but some are a range of diﬀerent shapes (see
diagram 3.1).

22

The Cell
Most cells are so small that a microscope is needed to see them, although a few cells, e.g.
the ostrich’s egg, are so large that they could make a meal for several people.
A normal cell is about 0.02 of a millimetre (0.02mm) in diameter. (Small distances like this
are normally expressed in micrometres or microns (μm). Note there are 1000 μms in every
mm).

Figure 12

Diagram 3.2 : An animal cell

When you look at a typical animal cell with a light microscope it seems quite simple with
only a few structures visible (see diagram 3.2).
Three main parts can be seen:
• an outer cell membrane (plasma membrane),
• an inner region called the cytoplasm and
• the nucleus

23

The Cell

Figure 13

Diagram 3.3 : An animal cell as seen with an electron microscope

However, when you use an electron microscope to increase the magniﬁcation many thousands of times you see that these seemingly simple structures are incredibly complex, each
with its own specialized function. For example the plasma membrane is seen to be a double layer and the cytoplasm contains many special structures called organelles (meaning
little organs) which are described below. A drawing of the cell as seen with an electron
microscope is shown in diagram 3.3.

24

The Plasma Membrane

3.3 The Plasma Membrane

Figure 14

Diagram 3.4 : The structure of the plasma membrane

The thin plasma membrane surrounds the cell, separating its contents from the surroundings
and controlling what enters and leaves the cell. The plasma membrane is composed of
two main molecules,phospholipids(fats) and proteins. The phospholipids are arranged in a
double layer with the large protein molecules dotted about in the membrane (see diagram
3.4). Some of the protein molecules form tiny channels in the membrane while others help
transport substances from one side of the membrane to the other.

3.3.1 How substances move across the Plasma Membrane
Substances need to pass through the membrane to enter or leave the cell and they do so in
a number of ways. Some of these processes require no energy i.e. they are passive, while
others require energy i.e. they are active .
Passive processes include: a) diﬀusion and b) osmosis, while active processes include: c)
active transport, d) phagocytosis, e) pinocytosis and f) exocytosis. These will be described
below.

25

The Cell

Figure 15

Diagram 3.5 : Diﬀusion in a liquid

a) Diﬀusion
Although you may not know it, you are already familiar with the process of diﬀusion. It is
diﬀusion that causes a smell (expensive perfume or smelly socks) in one part of the room
to gradually move through the room so it can be smelt on the other side. Diﬀusion occurs
in the air and in liquids.
Diagram 3.5 shows what happens when a few crystals of a dark purple dye called potassium
permanganate are dropped into a beaker of water. The dye molecules diﬀuse into the water
moving from high to low concentrations so they become evenly distributed throughout the
beaker.
In the body, diﬀusion causes molecules that are in a high concentration on one side of the
cell membrane to move across the membrane until they are present in equal concentrations
on both sides. It takes place because all molecules have an in-built vibration that causes
them to move and collide until they are evenly distributed. It is an absolutely natural
process that requires no added energy.
Small molecules like oxygen, carbon dioxide, water and ammonia as well as fats, diﬀuse
directly through the double fat layer of the membrane. The small molecules named above
as well as a variety of charged particles (ions) also diﬀuse through the protein-lined channels.
Larger molecules like glucose attach to a carrier molecule that aids their diﬀusion through
the membrane. This is called facilitated diﬀusion .

26

The Plasma Membrane
In the animal’s body diﬀusion is important for moving oxygen and carbon dioxide between
the lungs and the blood, for moving digested food molecules from the gut into the blood
and for the removal of waste products from the cell.

Figure 16

Diagram 3.6 : Osmosis

b) Osmosis
Although the word may be unfamiliar, you are almost certainly acquainted with the eﬀects
of osmosis. It is osmosis that plumps out dried fruit when you soak it before making a
fruit cake or makes that wizened old carrot look almost like new when you soak it in water.
Osmosis is in fact the diﬀusion of water across a membrane that allows water across but
not larger molecules. This kind of membrane is called a semi-permeable membrane .
Take a look at side A of diagram 3.6. It shows a container divided into two parts by
an artiﬁcial semi-permeable membrane. Water is poured into one part while a solution
containing salt is poured into the other part. Water can cross the membrane but the salt
cannot. The water crosses the semi-permeable membrane by diﬀusion until there is an equal
amount of water on both sides of the membrane. The eﬀect of this would be to make the
salt solution more diluted and cause the level of the liquid in the right-hand side of the
container to rise so it looked like side B of diagram 3.6. This movement of water across the
semi-permeable membrane is called osmosis. It is a completely natural process that requires
no outside energy.
Although it would be diﬃcult to do in practice, imagine that you could now take a plunger
and push down on the ﬂuid in the right-hand side of container B so that it ﬂowed back
across the semi-permeable membrane until the level of ﬂuid on both sides was equal again.
If you could measure the pressure required to do this, this would be equal to the osmotic

27

The Cell
pressure of the salt solution. (This is a rather advanced concept at this stage but you will
meet this term again when you study ﬂuid balance later in the course).

Figure 17

Diagram 3.7 : Osmosis in red cells placed in a hypotonic solution

The plasma membrane of cells acts as a semi-permeable membrane. If red blood cells, for
example, are placed in water, the water crosses the membrane to make the amount of water
on both sides of it equal (see diagram 3.7). This means that the water moves into the cell
causing it to swell. This can occur to such an extent that the cell actually bursts to release
its contents. This bursting of red blood cells is called haemolysis . In a situation such as
this when the solution on one side of a semi-permeable membrane has a lower concentration
than that on the other side, the ﬁrst solution is said to be hypotonic to the second.
Figure 18

Diagram 3.8 : Osmosis in red cells placed in a hypertonic solution

Now think what would happen if red blood cells were placed in a salt solution that has
a higher salt concentration than the solution within the cells (see diagram 3.8). Such a
bathing solution is called a hypertonic solution. In this situation the “concentration” of
water within the cells would be higher than that outside the cells. Osmosis (diﬀusion of
water) would then occur from the inside of the cells to the outside solution, causing the
cells to shrink.

28

The Plasma Membrane

Figure 19

Diagram 3.9 : Red cells placed in an isotonic solution

A solution that contains 0.9% salt has the same concentration as body ﬂuids and the solution
within red cells. Cells placed in such a solution would neither swell nor shrink (see diagram
3.9). This solution is called an isotonic solution. This strength of salt solution is often
called normal saline and is used when replacing an animal’s body ﬂuids or when cells like
red blood cells have to be suspended in ﬂuid.
Remember - osmosis is a special kind of diﬀusion. It is the diﬀusion of water molecules
across a semi-permeable membrane. It is a completely passive process and requires no
energy.
Sometimes it is diﬃcult to remember which way the water molecules move. Although it
is not strictly true in a biological sense, many students use the phrase “SALT SUCKS”
to help them remember which way water moves across the membrane when there are two
solutions of diﬀerent salt concentrations on either side.
As we have seen water moves in and out of the cell by osmosis. All water movement from
the intestine into the blood system and between the blood capillaries and the ﬂuid around
the cells (tissue or extra cellular ﬂuid) takes place by osmosis. Osmosis is also important in
the production of concentrated urine by the kidney.
c) Active transport

29

The Cell
When a substance is transported from a low concentration to a high concentration i.e. uphill
against the concentration gradient, energy has to be used. This is called active transport
.
Active transport is important in maintaining diﬀerent concentrations of the ions sodium
and potassium on either side of the nerve cell membrane. It is also important for removing
valuable molecules such as glucose, amino acids and sodium ions from the urine.

Figure 20

Diagram 3.10 : Phagocytosis

d) Phagocytosis
Phagocytosis is sometimes called “cell eating”. It is a process that requires energy and is
used by cells to move solid particles like bacteria across the plasma membrane. Finger-like
projections from the plasma membrane surround the bacteria and engulf them as shown
in diagram 3.10. Once within the cell, enzymes produced by the lysosomes of the cell
(described later) destroy the bacteria.
The destruction of bacteria and other foreign substance by white blood cells by the process
of phagocytosis is a vital part of the defense mechanisms of the body.
e) Pinocytosis
Pinocytosis or “cell drinking” is a very similar process to phagocytosis but is used by cells
to move ﬂuids across the plasma membrane. Most cells carry out pinocytosis (note the
pinocytotic vesicle in diagram 3.3).
f ) Exocytosis

30

The Cytoplasm
Exocytosis is the process by means of which substances formed in the cell are moved through
the plasma membrane into the ﬂuid outside the cell (or extra-cellular ﬂuid). It occurs in
all cells but is most important in secretory cells (e.g. cells that produce digestive enzymes)
and nerve cells.

3.4 The Cytoplasm
Within the plasma membrane is the cytoplasm . It consists of a clear jelly-like ﬂuid called
the a) cytosol or intracellular ﬂuid in which b) cell inclusions , c) organelles and d)
microﬁlaments and microtubules are found.

3.4.1 a) Cytosol
The cytosol consists mainly of water in which various molecules are dissolved or suspended.
These molecules include proteins, fats and carbohydrates as well as sodium, potassium,
calcium and chloride ions. Many of the reactions that take place in the cell occur in the
cytosol.

3.4.2 b) Cell inclusions
These are large particles of fat, glycogen and melanin that have been produced by the cell.
They are often large enough to be seen with the light microscope. For example the cells of
adipose tissue (as in the insulating fat layer under the skin) contain fat that takes up most
of the cell.

3.4.3 c) Organelles
Organelles are the “little organs” of the cell - like the heart, kidney and liver are the organs
of the body. They are structures with characteristic appearances and speciﬁc “jobs” in the
cell. Most can not be seen with the light microscope and so it was only when the electron
microscope was developed that they were discovered. The main organelles in the cell are the
ribosomes, endoplasmic reticulum, mitochondrion, Golgi complex and lysosomes
. A cell containing these organelles as seen with the electron microscope is shown in diagram
3.3.
Ribosomes
Figure 21

Diagram 3.11 : Rough endoplasmic reticulum

Ribosomes are tiny spherical organelles that make proteins by joining amino acids together. Many ribosomes are found free in the cytosol, while others are attached to the
rough endoplasmic reticulum.

31

The Cell
Endoplasmic reticulum
The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is a network of membranes that form channels
throughout the cytoplasm from the nucleus to the plasma membrane. Various molecules
are made in the ER and transported around the cell in its channels. There are two types
of ER: smooth ER and rough ER.
Smooth ER is where the fats in the cell are made and in some cells, where chemicals
like alcohol, pesticides and carcinogenic molecules are inactivated.
The Rough ER has ribosomes attached to its surface. The function of the Rough ER is
therefore to make proteins that are modiﬁed stored and transported by the ER (Diagram
3.11).
Mitochondria

Figure 22

Diagram 3.12 : A mitochondrion

Mitochondria (singular mitochondrion) are oval or rod shaped organelles scattered
throughout the cytoplasm. They consist of two membranes, the inner one of which is
folded to increase its surface area. (Diagram 3.12)
Mitochondria are the “power stations” of the cell. They make energy by “burning” food
molecules like glucose. This process is called cellular respiration . The reaction requires
oxygen and produces carbon dioxide which is a waste product. The process is very complex and takes place in a large number of steps but the overall word equation for cellular
respiration isGlucose + oxygen = carbon dioxide + water + energy
Note that cellular respiration is diﬀerent from respiration or breathing. Breathing is the
means by which air is drawn into and expelled from the lungs. Breathing is necessary to
supply the cells with the oxygen required by the mitochondria and to remove the carbon
dioxide produced as a waste product of cellular respiration.
Active cells like muscle, liver, kidney and sperm cells have large numbers of mitochondria.
Golgi Apparatus
Figure 23

32

Diagram 3.13 : A Golgi body

The Nucleus
The Golgi bodies in a cell together make up the Golgi apparatus . Golgi bodies are
found near the nucleus and consist of ﬂattened membranes stacked on top of each other
rather like a pile of plates (see diagram 3.13). The Golgi apparatus modiﬁes and sorts the
proteins and fats made by the ER, then surrounds them in a membrane as vesicles so they
can be moved to other parts of the cell.
Lysosomes
Lysosomes are large vesicles that contain digestive enzymes. These break down bacteria
and other substances that are brought into the cell by phagocytosis or pinocytosis. They
also digest worn-out or damaged organelles, the components of which can then be recycled
by the cell to make new structures.

3.4.4 d) Microﬁlaments And Microtubules
Some cells can move and change shape and organelles and chemicals are moved around the
cell. Threadlike structures called microﬁlaments and microtubules that can contract
are responsible for this movement.
These structures also form the projections from the plasma membrane known as ﬂagella
(singular ﬂagellum) as in the sperm tail, and cilia found lining the respiratory tract and
used to remove mucus that has trapped dust particles (see chapter 4).
Microtubules also form the pair of cylindrical structures called centrioles found near the
nucleus. These help organise the spindle used in cell division.

3.5 The Nucleus
Figure 24

Diagram 3.14 : A cell with an enlarged chromosome

33

The Cell

Figure 25

Diagram 3.15 : A full set of human chromosomes

The nucleus is the largest structure in a cell and can be seen with the light microscope.
It is a spherical or oval body that contains the chromosomes . The nucleus controls the
development and activity of the cell. Most cells contain a nucleus although mature red
blood cells have lost theirs during development and some muscle cells have several nuclei.
A double membrane similar in structure to the plasma membrane surrounds the nucleus
(now called the nuclear envelope). Pores in this nuclear membrane allow communication
between the nucleus and the cytoplasm.
Within the nucleus one or more spherical bodies of darker material can be seen, even with
the light microscope. These are called nucleoli and are made of RNA. Their role is to make
new ribosomes.

34

Cell Division

3.5.1 Chromosomes
Inside the nucleus are the chromosomes which:
•
•
•
•

contain DNA;
control the activity of the cell;
are transmitted from cell to cell when cells divide;
are passed to a new individual when sex cells fuse together in sexual reproduction.

In cells that are not dividing the chromosomes are very long and thin and appear as dark
grainy material. They become visible just before a cell divides when they shorten and
thicken and can then be counted (see diagram 3.14).
The number of chromosomes in the cells of diﬀerent species varies but is constant in the
cells of any one species (e.g. horses have 64 chromosomes, cats have 38 and humans 46).
Chromosomes occur in pairs (i.e. 32 pairs in the horse nucleus and 19 in that of the cat).
Members of each pair are identical in length and shape and if you look carefully at diagram
3.15, you may be able to see some of the pairs in the human set of chromosomes.

3.6 Cell Division

Figure 26 Diagram 3.16 : Division by mitosis results in 2 new cells identical to each
other and to parent cell

35

The Cell

Figure 27 Diagram 3.17 : Division by meiosis results in 4 new cells that are
genetically diﬀerent to each other

Cells divide when an animal grows, when its body repairs an injury and when it produces
sperm and eggs (or ova). There are two types of cell division: Mitosis and meiosis .
Mitosis . This is the cell division that occurs when an animal grows and when tissues
are repaired or replaced. It produces two new cells (daughter cells) each with a full set of
chromosomes that are identical to each other and to the parent cell. All the cells of an
animal’s body therefore contain identical DNA.
Meiosis. This is the cell division that produces the ova and sperm necessary for sexual
reproduction. It only occurs in the ovary and testis.
The most important function of meiosis it to halve the number of chromosomes so that
when the sperm fertilises the ovum the normal number is regained. Body cells with the full
set of chromosomes are called diploid cells, while gametes (sperm and ova) with half the
chromosomes are called haploid cells.
Meiosis is a more complex process than mitosis as it involves two divisions one after the
other and the four cells produced are all genetically diﬀerent from each other and from the
parent cell.
This fact that the cells formed by meiosis are all genetically diﬀerent from each other and
from the parent cell can be seen in litters of kittens where all the members of the litter are

36

The Cell As A Factory
diﬀerent from each other as well as being diﬀerent from the parents although they display
characteristics of both.

3.7 The Cell As A Factory
To make the function of the parts of the cell easier to understand and remember you can
compare them to a factory. For example:
• The nucleus (1) is the managing director of the factory consulting the blueprint (the
chromosomes) (2);
• The mitochondria (3) supply the power
• The ribosomes (4) make the products;
• The chloroplasts of plant cells (5) supply the fuel (food)
• The Golgi apparatus (6) packages the products ready for dispatch;
• The ER (7) modiﬁes, stores and transports the products around the factory;
• The plasma membrane is the factory wall and the gates (8);
• The lysosomes dispose of the waste and worn-out machinery.
The cell compared to a factory1

3.8 Summary
• Cells consist of three parts: the plasma membrane, cytoplasm and nucleus .
• Substances pass through the plasma membrane by diﬀusion (gases, lipids), osmosis
(water), active transport (glucose, ions), phagocytosis (particles), pinocytosis (ﬂuids) and exocytosis (particles and ﬂuids).
• Osmosis is the diﬀusion of water through a semipermeable membrane . Water
diﬀuses from high water ”concentration” to low water ”concentration”.
• The cytoplasm consists of cytosol in which are suspended cell inclusions and organelles .
• organelles include ribosomes, endoplasmic reticulum, mitochondria, Golgi bodies and lysosomes .
• The nucleus controls the activity of the cell. It contains the chromosomes that are
composed of DNA .
• The cell divides by mitosis and meiosis

Body Organisation
In this chapter, the way the cells of the body are organised into diﬀerent tissues is described.
You will ﬁnd out how these tissues are arranged into organs, and how the organs form
systems such as the digestive system and the reproductive system. Also in this chapter, the
important concept of homeostasis is deﬁned. You are also introduced to those pesky things
-- directional terms.

4.1 Objectives

the “Mrs Gren” characteristics of living organisms
what a tissue is
four basic types of tissues, their general function and where they are found in the body
the basic organisation of the body of vertebrates including the main body cavities and
the location of the following major organs: thorax, heart, lungs, thymus, abdomen, liver,
stomach, spleen, intestines, kidneys, sperm ducts, ovaries, uterus, cervix, vagina, urinary
bladder
• the 11 body systems
• what homeostasis is
• directional terms including dorsal, ventral, caudal, cranial, medial, lateral, proximal,
distal, rostral, palmar and plantar. Plus transverse and longitudinal sections

4.2 The Organisation Of Animal Bodies
Living organisms move, feed, respire (burn food to make energy), grow, sense their environment, excrete and reproduce. These seven characteristics are sometimes summarized by
the words “MRS GREN”. functions of:
M ovement
R espiration
S ensitivity
G rowth
R eproduction
E xcretion
N utrition
Living organisms are made from cells which are organised into tissues and these are themselves combined to form organs and systems.
Skin cells, muscle cells, skeleton cells and nerve cells, for example. These diﬀerent types
of cells are not just scattered around randomly but similar cells that perform the same
function are arranged in groups. These collections of similar cells are known as tissues .
There are four main types of tissues in animals. These are:

44

The Organisation Of Animal Bodies
•
•
•
•

Epithelial tissues that form linings, coverings and glands,
Connective tissues for transport and support
Muscle tissues for movement and
Nervous tissues for carrying messages.

4.2.1 Epithelial Tissues
Epithelium (plural epithelia) is tissue that covers and lines. It covers an organ or lines a
tube or space in the body. There are several diﬀerent types of epithelium, distinguished by
the diﬀerent shapes of the cells and whether they consist of only a single layer of cells or
several layers of cells.
Simple Epithelia - with a single layer of cells

Figure 29

Diagram 4.1 : Squamous epithelium

Squamous epithelium
Squamous epithelium consists of a single layer of ﬂattened cells that are shaped rather like
‘crazy paving’. It is found lining the heart, blood vessels, lung alveoli and body cavities
(see diagram 4.1). Its thinness allows molecules to diﬀuse across readily.

45

Body Organisation

Figure 30

Diagram 4.2 : Cuboidal epithelium

Cuboidal epithelium
Cuboidal epithelium consists of a single layer of cube shaped cells. It is rare in the body
but is found lining kidney tubules (see diagram 4.2). Molecules pass across it by diﬀusion,
osmosis and active transport.

46

The Organisation Of Animal Bodies

Figure 31

Diagram 4.3 : Columnar epithelium

Columnar epithelium
Columnar epithelium consists of column shaped cells. It is found lining the gut from the
stomach to the anus (see diagram 4.3). Digested food products move across it into the
blood stream.
Figure 32

Diagram 4.4 : Columnar epithelium with cilia

Columnar epithelium with cilia
Columnar epithelium with cilia on the free surface (also known as the apical side of the
cell) lines the respiratory tract, fallopian tubes and uterus (see diagram 4.4). The cilia beat
rhythmically to transport particles.

Figure 33

Diagram 4.5 : Transitional epithelium

Transitional epithelium - with a variable number of layers
The cells in transitional epithelium can move over one another allowing it to stretch. It is
found in the wall of the bladder (see diagram 4.5).
Stratiﬁed epithelia - with several layers of cells
Figure 34

Diagram 4.6 : Stratiﬁed squamous epithelium

Epithelia with several layers of cells are found where toughness and resistance to abrasion
are needed.
Stratiﬁed squamous epithelium
Stratiﬁed squamous epithelium has many layers of ﬂattened cells. It is found lining the
mouth, cervix and vagina. Cells at the base divide and push up the cells above them and
cells at the top are worn or pushed oﬀ the surface (see diagram 4.6). This type of epithelium
protects underlying layers and repairs itself rapidly if damaged.
Keratinised stratiﬁed squamous epithelium
Keratinised stratiﬁed squamous epithelium has a tough waterproof protein called keratin

deposited in the cells. It forms the skin found covering the outer surface of mammals. (Skin
will be described in more detail in Chapter 5).

4.2.2 Connective Tissues
Blood, bone, tendons, cartilage, ﬁbrous connective tissue and fat (adipose) tissue are all
classed as connective tissues. They are tissues that are used for supporting the body or
transporting substances around the body. They also consist of three parts: they all have
cells suspended in a ground substance or matrix and most have ﬁbres running through it.
Blood
Blood consists of a matrix - plasma, with several types of cells and cell fragments suspended
in it. The ﬁbres are only evident in blood that has clotted. Blood will be described in detail
in chapter 8.
Lymph
Lymph is similar in composition to blood plasma with various types of white blood cell
ﬂoating in it. It ﬂows in lymphatic vessels.
Connective tissue ‘proper’
Figure 35

Diagram 4.7 : Loose connective tissue

Connective tissue ’proper’ consists of a jelly-like matrix with a dense network of collagen
and elastic ﬁbres and various cells embedded in it. There are various diﬀerent forms of
‘proper’ connective tissue (see 1, 2 and 3 below).
Loose connective tissue
Loose connective tissue is a sticky whitish substance that ﬁlls the spaces between organs.
It is found in the dermis of the skin (see diagram 4.7).
Dense connective tissue
Dense connective tissue contains lots of thick ﬁbres and is very strong. It forms tendons,
ligaments and heart valves and covers bones and organs like the kidney and liver.
Adipose tissue
Adipose tissue consists of cells ﬁlled with fat. It forms the fatty layer under the dermis of
the skin, around the kidneys and heart and the yellow marrow of the bones.
Figure 36

Diagram 4.8 : Cartilage

49

Body Organisation
Cartilage
Cartilage is the ‘gristle’ of the meat. It consists of a tough jelly-like matrix with cells
suspended in it. It may contain collagen and elastic ﬁbres. It is a ﬂexible but tough tissue
and is found at the ends of bones, in the nose, ear and trachea and between the vertebrae
(see diagram 4.8).
Bone
Bone consists of a solid matrix made of calcium salts that give it its hardness. Collagen
ﬁbres running through it give it its strength. Bone cells are found in spaces in the matrix.
Two types of bone are found in the skeleton namely spongy and compact bone . They
diﬀer in the way the cells and matrix are arranged. (See Chapter 6 for more details of
bone).

4.2.3 Muscle Tissues
Muscle tissue is composed of cells that contract and move the body. There are three types
of muscle tissue:

Figure 37

50

Diagram 4.9 : Smooth muscle ﬁbres

The Organisation Of Animal Bodies
Smooth muscle
Smooth muscle consists of long and slender cells with a central nucleus (see diagram 4.9).
It is found in the walls of blood vessels, airways to the lungs and the gut. It changes the
size of the blood vessels and helps move food and ﬂuid along. Contraction of smooth muscle
ﬁbres occurs without the conscious control of the animal.

Figure 38

Diagram 4.10 : Skeletal muscle ﬁbres

Skeletal muscle
Skeletal muscle (sometimes called striated , striped or voluntary muscle ) has striped
ﬁbres with alternating light and dark bands. It is attached to bones and is under the
voluntary control of the animal (see diagram 4.10).

Figure 39

Diagram 4.11 : Cardiac muscle ﬁbres

51

Body Organisation
Cardiac muscle
Cardiac muscle is found only in the walls of the heart where it produces the ‘heart beat’.
Cardiac muscle cells are branched cylinders with central nuclei and faint stripes (see diagram
4.11). Each ﬁbre contracts automatically but the heart beat as a whole is controlled by the
pacemaker and the involuntary autonomic nervous system .
Figure 40

Diagram 4.12 : A motor neuron

4.2.4 Nervous Tissues
Nervous tissue forms the nerves, spinal cord and brain. Nerve cells or neurons consist of a
cell body and a long thread or axon that carries the nerve impulse. An insulating sheath of
fatty material (myelin ) usually surrounds the axon. Diagram 4.12 shows a typical motor
neuron that sends messages to muscles to contract.

4.3 Vertebrate Bodies
We are so familiar with animals with backbones (i.e. vertebrates) that it seems rather
unnecessary to point out that the body is divided into three sections. There is a welldeﬁned head that contains the brain, the major sense organs and the mouth, a trunk
that contains the other organs and a well-developed tail . Other features of vertebrates
may be less apparent. For instance, vertebrates that live on the land have developed a
ﬂexible neck that is absent in ﬁsh where it would be in the way of the gills and interfere
with streamlining. Mammals but not other vertebrates have a sheet of muscle called the
diaphragm that divides the trunk into the chest region or thorax and the abdomen .

52

Body Cavities

4.4 Body Cavities

Figure 41

Diagram 4.13 : The body cavities

In contrast to many primitive animals, vertebrates have spaces or body cavities that
contain the body organs. Most vertebrates have a single body cavity but in mammals the
diaphragm divides the main cavity into a thoracic and an abdominal cavity . In the
thoracic cavity the heart and lungs are surrounded by their own membranes so that cavities
are created around the heart - the pericardial cavity , and around the lungs – the pleural
cavity (see diagram 4.13).

4.5 Organs
Figure 42

Diagram 4.14 : Cells, tissues and organs forming the digestive system

Just as the various parts of the cell work together to perform the cell’s functions and a
large number of similar cells make up a tissue, so many diﬀerent tissues can “cooperate”
to form an organ that performs a particular function. For example, connective tissues,
epithelial tissues, muscle tissue and nervous tissue combine to make the organ that we call

53

Body Organisation
the stomach. In turn the stomach combines with other organs like the intestines, liver and
pancreas to form the digestive system (see diagram 4.14).

4.6 Generalised Plan Of The Mammalian Body

Figure 43

Diagram 4.15 : The main organs of the vertebrate body

At this point it would be a good idea to make yourself familiar with the major organs and
their positions in the body of a mammal like the rabbit. Diagram 4.15 shows the main body
organs.

54

Body Systems

4.7 Body Systems
Organs do not work in isolation but function in cooperation with other organs and body
structures to bring about the MRS GREN functions necessary to keep an animal alive. For
example the stomach can only work in conjunction with the mouth and oesophagus (gullet).
These provide it with the food it breaks down and digests. It then needs to pass the food
on to the intestines etc. for further digestion and absorption. The organs involved with the
taking of food into the body, the digestion and absorption of the food and elimination of
waste products are collectively known as the digestive system.

4.7.1 The 11 body systems
1. Skin
The skin covering the body consists of two layers, the epidermis and dermis .
Associated with these layers are hairs, feathers, claws, hoofs, glands and sense organs
of the skin.
2. Skeletal System
This can be divided into the bones of the skeleton and the joints where the bones
move over each other.
3. Muscular System
The muscles, in conjunction with the skeleton and joints, give the body the ability
to move.
4. Cardiovascular System
This is also known as the circulatory system. It consists of the heart, the blood
vessels and the blood. It transports substances around the body.
5. Lymphatic System
This system is responsible for collecting and “cleaning” the ﬂuid that leaks out of
the blood vessels. This ﬂuid is then returned to the blood system. The lymphatic
system also makes antibodies that protect the body from invasion by bacteria etc.
It consists of lymphatic vessels, lymph nodes, the spleen and thymus glands.
6. Respiratory System
This is the system involved with bringing oxygen in the air into the body and getting
rid of carbon dioxide, which is a waste product of processes that occur in the cell. It
is made up of the trachea, bronchi, bronchioles, lungs, diaphragm, ribs and muscles
that move the ribs in breathing.
7. Digestive System
This is also known as the gastrointestinal system , alimentary system or gut .
It consists of the digestive tube and glands like the liver and pancreas that produce
digestive secretions. It is concerned with breaking down the large molecules in foods
into smaller ones that can be absorbed into the blood and lymph. Waste material is
also eliminated by the digestive system.
8. Urinary System
This is also known as the renal system . It removes waste products from the blood
and is made up of the kidneys, ureters and bladder.
9. Reproductive System

55

Body Organisation
This is the system that keeps the species going by making new individuals. It is
made up of the ovaries, uterus, vagina and fallopian tubes in the female and the
testes with associated glands and ducts in the male.
10. Nervous System
This system coordinates the activities of the body and responses to the environment.
It consists of the sense organs (eye, ear, semicircular canals, and organs of taste and
smell), the nerves, brain and spinal cord.
11. Endocrine System
This is the system that produces chemical messengers or hormones. It consists of
various endocrine glands (ductless glands) that include the pituitary, adrenal,
thyroid and pineal glands as well as the testes and ovary.

4.8 Homeostasis
All the body systems, except the reproductive system, are involved with keeping the conditions inside the animal more or less stable. This is called homeostasis . These constant
conditions are essential for the survival and proper functioning of the cells, tissues and organs of the body. The skin, for example, has an important role in keeping the temperature
of the body constant. The kidneys keep the concentration of salts in the blood within limits
and the islets of Langerhans in the pancreas maintain the correct level of glucose in the
blood through the hormone insulin. As long as the various body processes remain within
normal limits, the body functions properly and is healthy. Once homeostasis is disturbed
disease or death may result. (See Chapters 12 and16 for more on homeostasis).

Diagram 4.17 : Transverse and longitudinal sections of a mouse

In the following chapters the systems of the body in the list above will be covered one by
one. For each one the structure of the organs involved will be described and the way they
function will be explained.
In order to describe structures in the body of an animal it is necessary to have a system for
describing the position of parts of the body in relation to other parts. For example it may
be necessary to describe the position of the liver in relation to the diaphragm, or the heart
in relation to the lungs. Certainly if you work further with animals, in a veterinary clinic
for example, it will be necessary to be able to accurately describe the position of an injury.
The terms used for this are called directional terms .

58

Directional Terms
The most common directional terms are right and left . However, even these are not
completely straightforward especially when looking at diagrams of animals. The convention
is to show the left side of the animal or organ on the right side of the page. This is the
view you would get looking down on an animal lying on its back during surgery or in a
post-mortem. Sometimes it is useful to imagine ‘getting inside’ the animal (so to speak) to
check which side is which. The other common and useful directional terms are listed below
and shown in diagram 4.16.
Term
Dorsal
Ventral
Cranial (or anterior)
Caudal (or posterior)
Proximal

Deﬁnition
Nearer the back of the animal
than
Nearer the belly of the animal
than
Nearer to the skull than
Nearer to the tail than

Medial

Closer to the body than (only
used for structures on limbs)
Further from the body than
(only used for structures on
limbs)
Nearer to the midline than

Lateral

Further from the midline than

Rostral

Towards the muzzle

Distal

Palmar
Plantar

The ”walking” surface of the
front paw
The ”walking” surface of the
hind paw

Example
The backbone is dorsal to the
belly
The breastbone is ventral to
the heart
The diaphragm is cranial to
the stomach
The ribs are caudal to the
neck
The shoulder is proximal to
the elbow
The ankle is distal to the
knee
The bladder is medial to the
hips
The ribs are lateral to the
lungs
There are more grey hairs in
the rostral part of the head
There is a small cut on the
left palmar surface
The pads are on the plantar
side of the foot

Note that we don’t use the terms superior and inferior for animals. They are only used
to describe the position of structures in the human body (and possibly apes) where the
upright posture means some structures are above or superior to others.
In order to look at the structure of some of the parts or organs of the body it may be
necessary to cut them open or even make thin slices of them that they can be examined
under the microscope. The direction and position of slices or sections through an animal’s
body have their own terminology.
If an animal or organ is sliced lengthwise this section is called a longitudinal or sagittal
section . This is sometimes abbreviated to LS.
If the section is sliced crosswise it is called a transverse or cross section . This is
sometimes abbreviated to TS or XS (see diagram 4.17).

5 The Skin
Figure 46

original image by Fran-cis-caa cc by

http://flickr.com/photos/alosojos/318955761/

The skin is the ﬁrst of the eleven body systems to be described. Each chapter from now on
will cover one body system.
The skin, sometimes known as the Integumentary System is, in fact, the largest organ of
the body. It has a complex structure, being composed of many diﬀerent tissues. It performs
many functions that are important in maintaining homeostasis in the body. Probably the
most important of these functions is the control of body temperature. The skin also protects
the body from physical damage and bacterial invasion. The skin has an array of sense organs
which sense the external environment, and also cells which can make vitamin D in sunlight.
The skin is one of the ﬁrst systems aﬀected when an animal becomes sick so it is important
for anyone working with animals to have a sound knowledge of the structure and functioning
of the skin so they can quickly recognise signs of disease.

5.1 Objectives
After completing this section, you should know:
• the general structure of the skin
• the function of the keratin deposited in the epidermis
• the structure and function of keratin skin structures including calluses, scales, nails, claws,
hoofs and horns
• that antlers are not made either of keratin or in the epidermis
• the structure of hairs
• the structure of the diﬀerent types of feathers and the function of preening
• the general structure and function of sweat, scent, preen and mammary glands
• the basic functions of the skin in sensing stimuli, temperature control and production of
vitamin D
• the mechanisms by which the skin regulates body temperature

5.2 The Skin
Skin comes in all kinds of textures and forms. There is the dry warty skin of toads and
crocodiles, the wet slimy skin of ﬁsh and frogs, the hard shell of tortoises and the soft

63

The Skin
supple skin of snakes and humans. Mammalian skin is covered with hair, that of birds with
feathers, and ﬁsh and reptiles have scales. Pigment in the skin, hairs or feathers can make
the outer surface almost any colour of the rainbow.
Skin is one of the largest organs of the body, making up 6-8% of the total
body weight. It consists of two distinct layers. The top layer is called the epidermis
and under that is the dermis’

The epidermis is the layer that bubbles up when we have a blister and as we know from this
experience, it has no blood or nerves in it. The cells at the base of the epidermis continually
divide and push the cells above them upwards. As these cells move up they die and become
the dry ﬂaky scales that fall oﬀ the skin surface. The cells in the epidermis die because
a special protein called keratin is deposited in them. Keratin is an extremely important
substance for it makes the skin waterproof. Without it land vertebrates like reptiles, birds
and mammals would, like frogs, be able to survive only in damp places.

5.3 Skin Structures Made Of Keratin
5.3.1 Claws, Nails and Hoofs
Reptiles, birds and mammals all have nails or claws on the ends of their toes. They protect
the end of the toe and may be used for grasping, grooming, digging or in defense. They
are continually worn away and grow continuously from a growth layer at their base (see
diagram 5.2).

Figure 47

Diagram 5.2 - A carnivore’s claw

64

Skin Structures Made Of Keratin
Hoofs are found in sheep, cows, horses etc. otherwise known as ungulate mammals .
These are animals that have lost toes in the process of evolution and walk on the “nails” of
the remaining toes. The hoof is a cylinder of horny material that surrounds and protects
the tip of the toe (see diagram 5.3).
Figure 48

Diagram 5.3 - A horse’s hoof

5.3.2 Horns And Antlers
True horns are made of keratin and are found in sheep, goats and cattle. They are never
branched and, once grown, are never shed. They consist of a core of bone arising in the
dermis of the skin and are fused with the skull. The horn itself forms as a hollow cone-shaped
sheath around the bone (see diagram 5.4).

65

The Skin

Figure 49

Diagram 5.4 - A horn
The antlers of male deer have quite a diﬀerent structure. They are not formed in the
epidermis and do not consist of keratin but are entirely of bone. They are shed each year
and are often branched, especially in older animals. When growing they are covered in skin
called velvet that forms the bone. Later the velvet is shed to leave the bony antler. The
velvet is often removed artiﬁcially to be sold in Asia as a traditional medicine (see diagram
5.5).

66

Skin Structures Made Of Keratin

Figure 50

Diagram 5.5 - A deer antler
Other animals have projections on their heads that are not true horns either. The horns
on the head of giraﬀes are made of bone covered with skin and hair, and the ‘horn’ of a
rhinoceros is made of modiﬁed and fused hair-like structures.

5.3.3 Hair
Hair is also made of keratin and develops in the epidermis. It covers the body of most
mammals where it acts as an insulator and helps to regulate the temperature of the body
(see below). The colour in hairs is formed from the same pigment, melanin that colours the
skin. Coat colour may help camouﬂage animals and sometimes acts to attract the opposite
sex.

Diagram 5.6 - A hair
Hairs lie in a follicle and grow from a root that is well supplied with blood vessels. The
hair itself consists of layers of dead keratin - containing cells and usually lies at a slant in
the skin. A small bundle of smooth muscle ﬁbres (the hair erector muscle ) is attached
to the side of each hair and when this contracts the hair stands on end. This increases the
insulating power of the coat and is also used by some animals to make them seem larger
when confronted by a foe or a competitor(see diagram 5.6).
The whiskers of cats and the spines of hedgehogs are examples of special types of hairs.

5.3.4 Feathers
The lightness and stiﬀness of keratin is also a key to bird ﬂight. In the form of feathers it
provides the large airfoils necessary for ﬂapping and gliding ﬂight. In another form, the light
ﬂuﬀy down feathers,also made of keratin, are some of the best natural insulators known.
This superior insulation is necessary to help maintain the high body temperatures of birds.

Diagram 5.7 - A Contour Feather
Countour feathers are large feathers that cover the body, wings and tail. They have an
expanded vane that provides the smooth, continuous surface that is required for eﬀective
ﬂight. This surface is formed by barbs that extend out from the central shaft. If you look
carefully at a feather you can see that on either side of each barb are thousands of barbules
that lock together by a complex system of hooks and notches. if this arrangement becomes
disrupted, the bird uses its beak to draw the barbs and barbules together again in an action
known as preening (see diagram 5.7).

Diagram 5.9 - A Pin Feather
Down feathers are the only feathers covering a chick and form the main insulation layer
under the contour feathers of the adult. They have no shaft but consist of a spray of simple,
slender branches (see diagram 5.8).
Pin feathers have a slender hair-like shaft often with a tiny tuft of barbs on the end. They
are found between the other feathers and help tell a bird how its feathers are lying (see
diagram 5.9).

5.4 Skin Glands
Glands are organs that produce and secrete ﬂuids. They are usually divided into two groups
depending upon whether or not they have channels or ducts to carry their products away.
Glands with ducts are called exocrine glands and include the glands found in the skin as
well as the glands that produce digestive enzymes in the gut. Endocrine glands have no

71

The Skin
ducts and release their products (hormones) directly into the blood stream. The pituitary
and adrenal glands are examples of endocrine glands.
Most vertebrates have exocrine glands in the skin that produce a variety of secretions. The
slime on the skin of ﬁsh and frogs is mucus produced by skin glands and some ﬁsh and frogs
also produce poison from modiﬁed glands. In fact the skin glands of some frogs produce
the most poisonous chemicals known. Reptiles and birds have a dry skin with few glands.
The preen gland , situated near the base of the bird’s tail, produces oil to help keep the
feathers in good condition. Mammals have an array of diﬀerent skin glands. These include
the wax producing, sweat, sebaceous and mammary glands.
Wax producing glands are found in the ears.
Sebaceous glands secrete an oily secretion into the hair follicle. This secretion, known as
sebum , keeps the hair supple and helps prevent the growth of bacteria (see diagram 5.6).
Sweat glands consist of a coiled tube and a duct leading onto the skin surface. Their
appearance when examined under the microscope inspired one of the ﬁrst scientists to
observe them to call them “fairies’ intestines” (see diagram 5.1). Sweat contains salt and
waste products like urea and the evaporation of sweat on the skin surface is one of the major
mechanisms for cooling the body of many mammals. Horses can sweat up to 30 litres of
ﬂuid a day during active exercise, but cats and dogs have few sweat glands and must cool
themselves by panting. Scent in the sweat of many animals is used to mark territory or
attract the opposite sex.
Mammary glands are only present in mammals. They are thought to be modiﬁed sebaceous glands and are present in both sexes but are rarely active in males (see diagram
5.10). The number of glands varies from species to species. They open to the surface in
well-developed nipples. Milk contains proteins, sugars, fats and salts, although the exact
composition varies from one species to another.

72

The Skin And Sun

Figure 55

Diagram 5.10 - A Mammary Gland

5.5 The Skin And Sun
A moderate amount of UV in sunlight is necessary for the skin to form vitamin D . This
vitamin prevents bone disorders like rickets to which animals reared indoors are susceptible.
Excessive exposure to the UV in sunlight can be damaging and the pigment melanin ,
deposited in cells at the base of the epidermis, helps to protect the underlying layers of
the skin from this damage. Melanin also colours the skin and variations in the amount of
melanin produces colours from pale yellow to black.

5.5.1 Sunburn And Skin Cancer
Excess exposure to the sun can cause sunburn. This is common in humans, but light skinned
animals like cats and pigs can also be sunburned, especially on the ears. Skin cancer can
also result from excessive exposure to the sun. As holes in the ozone layer increase exposure
to the sun’s UV rays, so too does the rate of skin cancer in humans and animals.

73

The Skin

5.6 The Dermis
The underlying layer of the skin, known as the dermis, is much thicker but much more
uniform in structure than the epidermis (see diagram 5.1). It is composed of loose connective
tissue with a felted mass of collagen and elastic ﬁbres . It is this part of the skin of cattle
and pigs etc. that becomes commercial leather when treated,. The dermis is well supplied
with blood vessels, so cuts and burns that penetrate down into the dermis will bleed or
cause serious ﬂuid loss. There are also numerous nerve endings and touch receptors in the
dermis because, of course, the skin is sensitive to touch, pain and temperature.
When looking at a section of the skin under the microscope you can see hair follicles, sweat
and sebaceous glands dipping down into the dermis. However, these structures do not
originate in the dermis but are derived from the epidermis.
In the lower levels of the dermis is a layer of fat or adipose tissue (see diagram 5.1). This
acts as an energy store and is an excellent insulator especially in mammals like whales with
little hair.

5.7 The Skin And Temperature Regulation
Vertebrates can be divided into two groups depending on whether or not they control
their internal temperature. Amphibia (frogs) and reptiles are said to be”cold blooded
” (poikilothermic ) because their body temperature approximately follows that of the
environment. Birds and mammals are said to be warm blooded (homoiothermic )
because they can maintain a roughly constant body temperature despite changes in the
temperature of the environment.
Heat is produced by the biochemical reactions of the body (especially in the liver) and by
muscle contraction. Most of the heat loss from the body occurs via the skin. It is therefore
not surprising that many of the mechanisms for controlling the temperature of the body
operate here.

5.7.1 Reduction Of Heat Loss
When an animal is in a cold environment and needs to reduce heat loss the erector muscles
contract causing the hair or feathers to rise up and increase the layer of insulating air
trapped by them (see diagram 5.11a).
Figure 56

Diagram 5.11a) Hair muscle relaxed...............Diagram 5.11b) Hair muscle contracted
Heat loss from the skin surface can also be reduced by the contraction of the abundant
blood vessels that lie in the dermis. This takes blood ﬂow to deeper levels, so reducing heat
loss and causing pale skin (see diagram 5.12a).

74

The Skin And Temperature Regulation

Figure 57

Diagram 5.12a) Reduction of heat loss by skin
Shivering caused by twitching muscles produces heat that also helps raise the body temperature.

5.7.2 Increase Of Heat Loss
There are two main mechanisms used by animals to increase the amount of heat lost from
the skin when they are in a hot environment or high levels of activity are increasing internal
heat production. The ﬁrst is the expansion of the blood vessels in the dermis so blood ﬂows
near the skin surface and heat loss to the environment can take place. The second is by the
production of sweat from the sweat glands (see diagram 5.12b). The evaporation of this
liquid on the skin surface produces a cooling eﬀect.
The mechanisms for regulating body temperature are under the control of a small region of
the brain called the hypothalamus . This acts like a thermostat.

75

The Skin

Figure 58

Diagram 5.12b) - Increase of heat loss by skin

5.7.3 Heat Loss And Body Size
The amount of heat that can be lost from the surface of the body is related to the area of
skin an animal has in relation to the total volume of its body.
Small animals like mice have a very large skin area compared to their total volume. This
means they tend to loose large amounts of heat and have diﬃculty keeping warm in cold
weather. They may need to keep active just to maintain their body temperature or may
hibernate to avoid the problem.
Large animals like elephants have the opposite problem. They have only a relatively small
skin area in relation to their total volume and may have trouble keeping cool. This is one
reason that these large animals tend to have sparse coverings of hair.

5.8 Summary
• Skin consists of two layers: the thin epidermis and under it the thicker dermis.
• The Epidermis is formed by the division of base cells that push those above them towards
the surface where they die and are shed.
• Keratin , a protein, is deposited in the epidermal cells. It makes skin waterproof.
• Various skin structures formed in the epidermis are made of keratin. These include:
claws, nails, hoofs, horn, hair and feathers.
• Various Exocrine Glands (with ducts) formed in the epidermis include sweat, sebaceous,
and mammary glands.

76

Worksheet
• Melanin deposited in cells at the base of the epidermis protects deeper cells from the
harmful eﬀects of the sun.

The Skeleton

6.1 Objectives
After completing this section, you should know:
•
•
•
•
•

the functions of the skeleton
the basic structure of a vertebrae and the regions of the vertebral column
the general structure of the skull
the diﬀerence between ‘true ribs’ and ‘ﬂoating ribs
the main bones of the fore and hind limbs, and their girdles and be able to identify them
in a live cat, dog, or rabbit

Fish, frogs, reptiles, birds and mammals are called vertebrates , a name that comes from
the bony column of vertebrae (the spine) that supports the body and head. The rest of the
skeleton of all these animals (except the ﬁsh) also has the same basic design with a skull
that houses and protects the brain and sense organs and ribs that protect the heart and
lungs and, in mammals, make breathing possible. Each of the four limbs is made to the
same basic pattern. It is joined to the spine by means of a ﬂat, broad bone called a girdle
and consists of one long upper bone, two long lower bones, several smaller bones in the
wrist or ankle and ﬁve digits (see diagrams 6.1 18,19 and 20).

Figure 60

Diagram 6.1 - The mammalian skeleton

80

The Vertebral Column

6.2 The Vertebral Column
The vertebral column consists of a series of bones called vertebrae linked together to form
a ﬂexible column with the skull at one end and the tail at the other. Each vertebra consists
of a ring of bone with spines (spinous process) protruding dorsally from it. The spinal cord
passes through the hole in the middle and muscles attach to the spines making movement
of the body possible (see diagram 6.2).

Figure 61

Diagram 6.2 - Cross section of a lumbar vertebre
The shape and size of the vertebrae of mammals vary from the neck to the tail. In the neck
there are cervical vertebrae with the two top ones, the atlas and axis , being specialised
to support the head and allow it to nod “Yes” and shake “No”. Thoracic vertebrae in the
chest region have special surfaces against which the ribs move during breathing. Grazing
animals like cows and giraﬀes that have to support weighty heads on long necks have extra
large spines on their cervical and thoracic vertebrae for muscles to attach to. Lumbar
vertebrae in the loin region are usually large strong vertebrae with prominent spines for
the attachment of the large muscles of the lower back. The sacral vertebrae are usually
fused into one solid bone called the sacrum that sits within the pelvic girdle . Finally
there are a variable number of small bones in the tail called the coccygeal vertebrae (see
diagram 6.3).

81

The Skeleton

Figure 62

Diagram 6.3 - The regions of the vertebral column dik

6.3 The Skull
The skull of mammals consists of 30 separate bones that grow together during development
to form a solid case protecting the brain and sense organs. The “box “enclosing and protecting the brain is called the cranium (see diagram 6.4). The bony wall of the cranium
encloses the middle and inner ears, protects the organs of smell in the nasal cavity and the
eyes in sockets known as orbits . The teeth are inserted into the upper and lower jaws (see
Chapter 5 for more on teeth) The lower jaw is known as the mandible . It forms a joint
with the skull moved by strong muscles that allow an animal to chew. At the front of the
skull is the nasal cavity, separated from the mouth by a plate of bone called the palate .
Behind the nasal cavity and connecting with it are the sinuses . These are air spaces in the
bones of the skull which help keep the skull as light as possible. At the base of the cranium
is the foramen magnum , translated as “big hole”, through which the spinal cord passes.
On either side of this are two small, smooth rounded knobs or condyles that articulate
(move against) the ﬁrst or Atlas vertebra.

82

The Rib

Figure 63

Diagram 6.4 - A dog’s skull

6.4 The Rib
Paired ribs are attached to each thoracic vertebra against which they move in breathing.
Each rib is attached ventrally either to the sternum or to the rib in front by cartilage
to form the rib cage that protects the heart and lungs. In dogs one pair of ribs is not
attached ventrally at all. They are called ﬂoating ribs (see diagram 6.5). Birds have a
large expanded sternum called the keel to which the ﬂight muscles (the ‘breast” meat of a
roast chicken) are attached.

83

The Skeleton

Figure 64

Diagram 6.5 - The rib

6.5 The Forelimb
The forelimb consists of: Humerus, radius and ulna, carpals, metacarpals, digits or
phalanges (see diagram 6.6). The top of the humerus moves against (articulates with)
the scapula at the shoulder joint. By changing the number, size and shape of the various
bones, fore limbs have evolved to ﬁt diﬀerent ways of life. They have become wings for ﬂying
in birds and bats, ﬂippers for swimming in whales, seals and porpoises, fast and eﬃcient
limbs for running in horses and arms and hands for holding and manipulating in primates
(see diagram 6.8).

Diagram 6.7. Hindlimb of a dog

6.6 The Hind Limb
The hind limbs have a similar basic pattern to the forelimb. They consist of: femur, tibia
and ﬁbula, tarsals, metatarsals, digits or phalanges (see diagram 6.7). The top of the
femur moves against (articulates with) the pelvis at the hip joint.

86

The Girdles

Figure 67

Diagram 6.8 - Various vertebrate limbs
Figure 68

Diagram 6.9 - Forelimb of a horse
This diagram is wrong. The Long pastern or proximal phalanx is P1, not P3. The distal
phalanx or coﬃn bone (called hoof there) is the 3rd phalanges. The patella or kneecap is
embedded in a large tendon in front of the knee. It seems to smooth the movements of the
knee. The legs of the horse are highly adapted to give it great galloping speed over long
distances. The bones of the leg, wrist and foot are greatly elongated and the hooves are
actually the tips of the third ﬁngers and toes, the other digits having been lost or reduced
(see diagram 6.9).

6.7 The Girdles
The girdles pass on the “push” produced by the limbs to the body. The shoulder girdle or
scapula is a triangle of bone surrounded by the muscles of the back but not connected

87

The Skeleton
directly to the spine (see diagram 6.1). This arrangement helps it to cushion the body
when landing after a leap and gives the forelimbs the ﬂexibility to manipulate food or
strike at prey. Animals that use their forelimbs for grasping, burrowing or climbing have a
well-developed clavicle or collar bone. This connects the shoulder girdle to the sternum.
Animals like sheep, horses and cows that use their forelimbs only for supporting the body
and locomotion have no clavicle. The pelvic girdle or hipbone attaches the sacrum and
the hind legs. It transmits the force of the leg-thrust in walking or jumping directly to the
spine (see diagram 6.10).

Figure 69

Diagram 6.10 - The pelvic girdle

6.8 Categories Of Bones
People who study skeletons place the diﬀerent bones of the skeleton into groups according
to their shape or the way in which they develop. Thus we have long bones like the femur,
radius and ﬁnger bones, short bones like the ones of the wrist and ankle, irregular bones

88

Bird Skeletons
like the vertebrae and ﬂat bones like the shoulder blade and bones of the skull. Finally
there are bones that develop in tissue separated from the main skeleton. These include
sesamoid bones which include bones like the patella or kneecap that develop in tendons
and visceral bones that develop in the soft tissue of the penis of the dog and the cow’s
heart.

6.9 Bird Skeletons
Although the skeleton of birds is made up of the same bones as that of mammals, many are
highly adapted for ﬂight. The most noticeable diﬀerence is that the bones of the forelimbs
are elongated to act as wings. The large ﬂight muscles make up as much as 1/5th of the body
weight and are attached to an extension of the sternum called the keel . The vertebrae of
the lower back are fused to provide the rigidity needed to produce ﬂying movements. There
are also many adaptations to reduce the weight of the skeleton. For instance birds have a
beak rather than teeth and many of the bones are hollow (see diagram 6.11).

Figure 70

Diagram 6.11 - A bird’s skeleton

89

The Skeleton

6.10 The Structure Of Long Bones
A long bone consists of a central portion or shaft and two ends called epiphyses (see
diagram 6.12). Long bones move against or articulate with other bones at joints and their
ends have ﬂattened surfaces and rounded protuberances (condyles) to make this possible. If
you carefully examine a long bone you may also see raised or rough surfaces. This is where
the muscles that move the bones are attached. You will also see holes (a hole is called a
foramen ) in the bone. Blood vessels and nerves pass into the bone through these. You
may also be able to see a ﬁne line at each end of the bone. This is called the growth plate
or epiphyseal line and marks the place where increase in length of the bone occurred (see
diagram 6.16).

Figure 71

90

The Structure Of Long Bones
Diagram 6.12 - A femur

Figure 72

6.13 - A longitudinal section through a long bone
If you cut a long bone lengthways you will see it consists of a hollow cylinder (see diagram
6.13). The outer shell is covered by a tough ﬁbrous sheath to which the tendons are attached.
Under this is a layer of hard, dense compact bone (see below). This gives the bone its
strength. The central cavity contains fatty yellow marrow , an important energy store for
the body, and the ends are made from honeycomb-like bony material called spongy bone
(see box below). Spongy bone contains red marrow where red blood cells are made.

91

The Skeleton

6.11 Compact Bone
Compact bone is not the lifeless material it may appear at ﬁrst glance. It is a living dynamic
tissue with blood vessels, nerves and living cells that continually rebuild and reshape the
bone structure as a result of the stresses, bends and breaks it experiences. Compact bone is
composed of microscopic hollow cylinders that run parallel to each other along the length of
the bone. Each of these cylinders is called a Haversian system . Blood vessels and nerves
run along the central canal of each Haversian system. Each system consists of concentric
rings of bone material (the matrix ) with minute spaces in it that hold the bone cells. The
hard matrix contains crystals of calcium phosphate, calcium carbonate and magnesium
salts with collagen ﬁbres that make the bone stronger and somewhat ﬂexible. Tiny canals
connect the cells with each other and their blood supply (see diagram 6.14).

Figure 73

92

Spongy Bone
Diagram 6.14 - Haversian systems of compact bone

6.12 Spongy Bone
Spongy bone gives bones lightness with strength. It consists of an irregular lattice that looks
just like an old fashioned loofah sponge (see diagram 6.15). It is found on the ends of long
bones and makes up most of the bone tissue of the limb girdles, ribs, sternum, vertebrae
and skull. The spaces contain red marrow, which is where red blood cells are made and
stored.
Figure 74

Diagram 6.15 - Spongy bone

6.13 Bone Growth
The skeleton starts oﬀ in the foetus as either cartilage or ﬁbrous connective tissue. Before
birth and, sometimes for years after it, the cartilage is gradually replaced by bone. The long
bones increase in length at the ends at an area known as the epiphyseal plate where new
cartilage is laid down and then gradually converted to bone. When an animal is mature,
bone growth ceases and the epiphyseal plate converts into a ﬁne epiphyseal line (see
diagram 6.16).

Figure 75

93

The Skeleton
Diagram 6.16 - A growing bone

6.14 Broken Bones
A fracture or break dramatically demonstrates the dynamic nature of bone. Soon after the
break occurs blood pours into the site and cartilage is deposited. This starts to connect the
broken ends together. Later spongy bone replaces the cartilage, which is itself replaced by
compact bone. Partial healing to the point where some weight can be put on the bone can
take place in 6 weeks but complete healing may take 3-4 months.

6.15 Joints
Joints are the structures in the skeleton where 2 or more bones meet. There are several
diﬀerent types of joints. Some are immovable once the animal has reached maturity.
Examples of these are those between the bones of the skull and the midline joint of the
pelvic girdle. Some are slightly moveable like the joints between the vertebrae but most
joints allow free movement and have a typical structure with a ﬂuid ﬁlled cavity separating
the articulating surfaces (surfaces that move against each other) of the two bones. This
kind of joint is called a synovial joint (see diagram 6.17). The joint is held together by
bundles of white ﬁbrous tissue called ligaments and a ﬁbrous capsule encloses the joint.
The inner layers of this capsule secrete the synovial ﬂuid that acts as a lubricant. The
articulating surfaces of the bones are covered with cartilage that also reduces friction and
some joints, e.g. the knee, have a pad of cartilage between the surfaces that articulate with
each other.
The shape of the articulating bones in a joint and the arrangement of ligaments determine
the kind of movement made by the joint. Some joints only allow a to and from gliding
movement e.g. between the ankle and wrist bones; the joints at the elbow, knee and ﬁngers
are hinge joints and allow movement in two dimensions and the axis vertebra pivots on
the atlas vertebra. Ball and socket joints , like those at the shoulder and hip, allow the
greatest range of movement.

94

Common Names Of Joints

Figure 76

Diagram 6.17 - A synovial joint

6.16 Common Names Of Joints
Some joints in animals are given common names that tend to be confusing. For example:
1. The joint between the femur and the tibia on the hind leg is our knee but the stiﬂe
in animals.
2. Our ankle joint (between the tarsals and metatarsals) is the hock in animals
3. Our knuckle joint (between the metacarpals or metatarsals and the phalanges) is the
fetlock in the horse.
4. The “knee” on the horse is equivalent to our wrist (ie on the front limb between the
radius and metacarpals) see diagrams 6.6, 6.7, 6.8, 6.17 and 6.18.

Locomotion

6.17 Locomotion
Diﬀerent animals place diﬀerent parts of the foot or forelimb on the ground when walking
or running.
Humans and bears put the whole surface of the foot on the ground when they walk. This is
known as plantigrade locomotion . Dogs and cats walk on their toes (digitigrade locomotion ) while horses and pigs walk on their “toenails” or hoofs. This is called unguligrade
locomotion (see diagram 6.20).
1. Plantigrade locomotion (on the “palms of the hand) as in humans and bears
2. Digitigrade locomotion (on the “ﬁngers”) as in cats and dogs
3. Unguligrade locomotion (on the “ﬁngernails”) as in horses

Diagram 6.20 - Locomotion

6.18 Summary
• The skeleton maintains the shape of the body, protects internal organs and makes locomotion possible.
• The vertebrae support the body and protect the spinal cord. They consist of: cervical
vertebrae in the neck, thoracic vertebrae in the chest region which articulate with
the ribs, lumbar vertebrae in the loin region, sacral vertebrae fused to the pelvis to
form the sacrum and tail or coccygeal vertebrae .
• The skull protects the brain and sense organs. The cranium forms a solid box enclosing
the brain. The mandible forms the jaw.
• The forelimb consists of the humerus, radius, ulna, carpals, metacarpals and phalanges . It moves against or articulates with the scapula at the shoulder joint.
• The hindlimb consists of the femur, patella, tibia, ﬁbula, tarsals, metatarsals and
digits . It moves against or articulates with the pelvis at the hip joint.
• Bones articulate against each other at joints .
• Compact bone in the shaft of long bones gives them their strength. Spongy bone at
the ends reduces weight. Bone growth occurs at the growth plate .

bone and the growth of bone is quite good although still much above the level required.

Muscles

7.1 Objectives
After completing this section, you should know:
•
•
•
•
•

The structure of smooth, cardiac and skeletal muscle and where they are found.
What the insertion and origin of a muscle is.
What ﬂexion and extension of a muscle means.
That muscles usually operate as antagonistic pairs.
What tendons attach muscles to bones.

7.2 Muscles
Muscles make up the bulk of an animal’s body and account for about half its weight. The
meat on the chop or roast is muscle and is composed mainly of protein. The cells that make
up muscle tissue are elongated and able to contract to a half or even a third of their length
when at rest. There are three diﬀerent kinds of muscle based on appearance and function:
smooth, cardiac and skeletal muscle.

7.2.1 Types of Muscle
• Smooth muscle
Smooth or Involuntary muscle carries out the unconscious routine tasks of the body such
as moving food down the digestive system, keeping the eyes in focus and adjusting the
diameter of blood vessels. The individual cells are spindle-shaped, being fatter in the
middle and tapering oﬀ towards the ends with a nucleus in the centre of the cell. They
are usually found in sheets and are stimulated by the non-conscious or autonomic nervous
system as well as by hormones (see Chapter 3).
• Cardiac muscle
Cardiac muscle is only found in the wall of the heart. It is composed of branching ﬁbres
that form a three-dimensional network. When examined under the microscope, a central
nucleus and faint stripes or striations can be seen in the cells. Cardiac muscle cells contract
spontaneously and rhythmically without outside stimulation, but the sinoatrial node (natural pacemaker) coordinates the heart beat. Nerves and hormones modify this rhythm (see
Chapter 3).
• Skeletal muscle
Skeletal muscle is the muscle that is attached to and moves the skeleton, and is under
voluntary control. It is composed of elongated cells or ﬁbres lying parallel to each other.
Each cell is unusual in that it has several nuclei and when examined under the microscope
appears striped or striated. This appearance gives the muscle its names of striped or striated
muscle. Each cell of striated muscle contains hundreds, or even thousands, of microscopic
ﬁbres each one with its own striped appearance. The stripes are formed by two diﬀerent
sorts of protein that slide over each other making the cell contract (see diagram 7.1).

102

Muscles

Figure 83

Diagram 7.1 - A striped muscle cell

7.2.2 Muscle contraction
Muscle contraction requires energy and muscle cells have numerous mitochondria. However,
only about 15% of the energy released by the mitochondria is used to fuel muscle contraction.
The rest is released as heat. This is why exercise increases body temperature and makes
animals sweat or pant to rid themselves of this heat.
What we refer to as a muscle is made up of groups of muscle ﬁbres surrounded by connective
tissue. The connective tissue sheaths join together at the ends of the muscle to form tough
white bands of ﬁbre called tendons . These attach the muscles to the bones. Tendons
are similar in structure to the ligaments that attach bones together across a joint (see
diagrams 7.2a and b).

103

Muscles

Figure 84

Diagram 7.2 a and b - The structure of a muscle
Remember:
Tendons Tie muscles to bones
and
Ligaments Link bones at joints

7.2.3 Structure of a muscle
A single muscle is fat in the middle and tapers towards the ends. The middle part, which
gets fatter when the muscle contracts, is called the belly of the muscle. If you contract
your biceps muscle in your upper arm you may feel it getting fatter in the middle. You
may also notice that the biceps is attached at its top end to bones in your shoulder while
at the bottom it is attached to bones in your lower arm. Notice that the bones at only one
end move when you contract the biceps. This end of the muscle is called the insertion .
The other end of the muscle, the origin , is attached to the bone that moves the least (see
diagram 7.3).

104

Muscles

Figure 85

Diagram 7.3 - Antagonistic muscles, ﬂexion and extension

7.2.4 Antagonistic muscles
Skeletal muscles usually work in pairs. When one contracts the other relaxes and vice versa.
Pairs of muscles that work like this are called antagonistic muscles . For example the
muscles in the upper forearm are the biceps and triceps (see diagram 7.3). Together they
bend the elbow. When the biceps contracts (and the triceps relaxes) the lower forearm
is raised and the angle of the joint is reduced. This kind of movement is called ﬂexion .
When the triceps is contracted (and the biceps relaxes), the angle of the elbow increases.
The term for this movement is extension .
When you or animals contract skeletal muscle it is a voluntary action. For example, you
make a conscious decision to walk across the room, raise the spoon to your mouth or smile.
There is however, another way in which contraction of muscles attached to the skeleton
happens that is not under voluntary control. This is during a reﬂex action , such as
jerking your hand away from the hot stove you have touched by accident. This is called a
reﬂex arc and will be described in detail in chapter 14-15.

Respiratory System

9.2 Overview

Figure 88

Diagram 9.1 : Alveoli with blood supply

Animals require a supply of energy to survive. This energy is needed to build large molecules
like proteins and glycogen, make the structures in cells, move chemicals through membranes
and around cells, contract muscles, transmit nerve impulses and keep the body warm.
Animals get their energy from the large molecules that they eat as food. Glucose is often
the energy source but it may also come from other carbohydrates, as well as fats and protein.
The energy is made by the biochemical process known as cellular respiration that takes
place in the mitochondria inside every living cell.
The overall reaction can be summarised by the word equation given below.
Charbohydrate Food (glucose) + Oxygen = Carbon Dioxide + Water + energy
As you can see from this equation, the cells need to be supplied with oxygen and glucose
and the waste product, carbon dioxide , which is poisonous to cells, needs to be removed.
The way the digestive system provides the glucose for cellular respiration will be described
in Chapter 11 (”The Gut and Digestion”), but here we are only concerned with the two
gases, oxygen and carbon dioxide, that are involved in cellular respiration. These gases are
carried in the blood to and from the tissues where they are required or produced.
Oxygen enters the body from the air (or water in ﬁsh)and carbon dioxide is usually eliminated from the same part of the body. This process is called gas exchange . In ﬁsh gas
exchange occurs in the gills, in land dwelling vertebrates lungs are the gas exchange organs
and frogs use gills when they are tadpoles and lungs, the mouth and the skin when adults.
Mammals (and birds) are active and have relatively high body temperatures so they require
large amounts of oxygen to provide suﬃcient energy through cellular respiration. In order

112

Diﬀusion And Transport Of Oxygen
to take in enough oxygen and release all the carbon dioxide produced they need a very large
surface area over which gas exchange can take place. The many minute air sacs or alveoli
of the lungs provide this. When you look at these under the microscope they appear rather
like bunches of grapes covered with a dense network of ﬁne capillaries (see diagram 9.1).
A thin layer of water covers the inner surface of each alveolus. There is only a very small
distance -just 2 layers of thin cells - between the air in the alveoli and the blood in the
capillaries. The gases pass across this gap by diﬀusion .

9.3 Diﬀusion And Transport Of Oxygen

Figure 89

Diagram 9.2 : Cross section of an alveolus

The air in the alveoli is rich in oxygen while the blood in the capillaries around the alveoli
is deoxygenated. This is because the haemoglobin in the red blood cells has released all the
oxygen it has been carrying to the cells of the body. Oxygen diﬀuses from high concentration
to low concentration. It therefore crosses the narrow barrier between the alveoli and the
capillaries to enter the blood and combine with the haemoglobin in the red blood cells to
form oxyhaemoglobin .
The narrow diameter of the capillaries around the alveoli means that the blood ﬂow is
slowed down and that the red cells are squeezed against the capillary walls. Both of these
factors help the oxygen diﬀuse into the blood (see diagram 9.2).
When the blood reaches the capillaries of the tissues the oxygen splits from the haemoglobin
molecule. It then diﬀuses into the tissue ﬂuid and then into the cells.

9.4 Diﬀusion And Transport Of Carbon Dioxide
Blood entering the lung capillaries is full of carbon dioxide that it has collected from the
tissues. Most of the carbon dioxide is dissolved in the plasma either in the form of sodium
bicarbonate or carbonic acid . A little is transported by the red blood cells. As the
blood enters the lungs the carbon dioxide gas diﬀuses through the capillary and alveoli walls
into the water ﬁlm and then into the alveoli. Finally it is removed from the lungs during

113

Respiratory System
breathing out (see diagram 9.2). (See chapter 8 for more information about how oxygen
and carbon dioxide are carried in the blood).

9.5 The Air Passages
When air is breathed in it passes from the nose to the alveoli of the lungs down a series of
tubes (see diagram 9.3). After entering the nose the air passes through the nasal cavity
, which is lined with a moist membrane that adds warmth and moisture to the air as it
passes. The air then ﬂows through the pharynx or throat, a passage that carries both
food and air, to the larynx where the voice-box is located. Here the passages for food and
air separate again. Food must pass into the oesophagus and the air into the windpipe or
trachea . To prevent food entering this, a small ﬂap of tissue called the epiglottis closes
the opening during swallowing (see chapter 11). A reﬂex that inhibits breathing during
swallowing also (usually) prevents choking on food.
The trachea is the tube that ducts the air down the throat. Incomplete rings of cartilage
in its walls help keep it open even when the neck is bent and head turned. The fact that
acrobats and people that tie themselves in knots doing yoga still keep breathing during the
most contorted manoeuvres shows how eﬀective this arrangement is. The air passage now
divides into the two bronchi that take the air to the right and left lungs before dividing
into smaller and smaller bronchioles that spread throughout the lungs to carry air to the
alveoli. Smooth muscles in the walls of the bronchi and bronchioles adjust the diameter of
the air passages.
The tissue lining the respiratory passages producesmucus and is covered with minute hairs
or cilia. Any dust that is breathed into the respiratory system immediately gets entangled
in the mucous and the cilia move it towards the mouth or nose where it can be coughed up
or blown out.

9.6 The Lungs And The Pleural Cavities
Figure 90

Diagram 9.3 : The respiratory system

The lungs ﬁll most of the chest or thoracic cavity , which is completely separated from the
abdominal cavity by the diaphragm . The lungs and the spaces in which they lie (called
the pleural cavities) are covered with membranes called the pleura . There is a thin ﬁlm
of ﬂuid between the two membranes. This lubricates them as they move over each other
during breathing movements.

9.6.1 Collapsed Lungs
The pleural cavities are completely airtight with no connection with the outside and if
they are punctured by accident (a broken rib will often do this), air rushes in and the
lung collapses. Separating the two lungs is a region of tissue that contains the oesophagus,

114

Breathing
trachea, aorta, vena cava and lymph nodes. This is called the mediastinum . In humans
and sheep it separates the cavity completely so that puncturing one pleural cavity leads to
the collapse of only one lung. In dogs, however, this separation is incomplete so a puncture
results in a complete collapse of both lungs.

9.7 Breathing

Figure 91

Diagram 9.4a : Inspiration; Diagram 9.4b : Expiration

The process of breathing moves air in and out of the lungs. Sometimes this process is
called respiration but it is important not to confuse it with the chemical process, cellular
respiration , that takes place in the mitochondria of cells. Breathing is brought about by
the movement of the diaphragm and the ribs.

9.7.1 Inspiration
The diaphragm is a thin sheet of muscle that completely separates the abdominal and
thoracic cavities. When at rest it domes up into the thoracic cavity but during breathing
in or inspiration it ﬂattens. At the same time special muscles in the chest wall move the
ribs forwards and outwards. These movements of both the diaphragm and the ribs cause
the volume of the thorax to increase. Because the pleural cavities are airtight, the lungs
expand to ﬁll this increased space and air is drawn down the trachea into the lungs (see
diagram 9.4a).

9.7.2 Expiration
Expiration or breathing out consists of the opposite movements. The ribs move down
and in and the diaphragm resumes its domed shape so the air is expelled (see diagram
9.4b). Expiration is usually passive and no energy is required (unless you are blowing up a
balloon).

115

Respiratory System

9.7.3 Lung Volumes

Figure 92

Diagram 9.5 : Lung volumes

As you sit here reading this just pay attention to your breathing. Notice that your in and out
breaths are really quite small and gentle (unless you have just rushed here from somewhere
else!). Only a small amount of the total volume that your lungs hold is breathed in and
out with each breath. This kind of gentle “at rest” breathing is called tidal breathing
and the volume breathed in or out (they should be the same) is the tidal volume (see
diagram 9.5). Sometimes people want to measure the volume of air inspired or expired
during a minute of this normal breathing. This is called the minute volume . It could be
estimated by measuring the volume of one tidal breath and then multiplying that by the
number of breaths in a minute. Of course it is possible to take a deep breath and breathe
in as far as you can and then expire as far as possible. The volume of the air expired when
a maximum expiration follows a maximum inspiration is called the vital capacity (see
diagram 9.5).

9.7.4 Composition Of Air
The air animals breathe in consists of 21% oxygen and 0.04% carbon dioxide. Expelled air
consists of 16% oxygen and 4.4% carbon dioxide. This means that the lungs remove only
a quarter of the oxygen contained in the air. This is why it is possible to give someone (or
an animal) artiﬁcial respiration by blowing expired air into their mouth.
Breathing is usually an unconscious activity that takes place whether you are awake or
asleep, although, humans at least, can also control it consciously. Two regions in the
hindbrain called the medulla oblongata and pons control the rate of breathing. These
are called respiratory centres . They respond to the concentration of carbon dioxide

116

Summary
in the blood. When this concentration rises during a bout of activity, for example, nerve
impulses are automatically sent to the diaphragm and rib muscles that increase the rate
and the depth of breathing. Increasing the rate of breathing also increases the amount of
oxygen in the blood to meet the needs of this increased activity.

9.7.5 The Acidity Of The Blood And Breathing
The degree of acidity of the blood (the acid-base balance) is critical for normal functioning
of cells and the body as a whole. For example, blood that is too acidic or alkaline can
seriously aﬀect nerve function causing a coma, muscle spasms, convulsions and even death.
Carbon dioxide carried in the blood makes the blood acidic and the higher the concentration
of carbon dioxide the more acidic it is. This is obviously dangerous so there are various
mechanisms in the body that bring the acid-base balance back within the normal range.
Breathing is one of these homeostatic mechanisms. By increasing the rate of breathing the
animal increases the amount of dissolved carbon dioxide that is expelled from the blood.
This reduces the acidity of the blood.

9.7.6 Breathing In Birds
Birds have a unique respiratory system that enables them to respire at the very high rates
necessary for ﬂight. The lungs are relatively solid structures that do not change shape and
size in the same way as mammalian lungs do. Tubes run through them and connect with
a series of air sacs situated in the thoracic and abdominal body cavities and some of the
bones. Movements of the ribs and breastbone or sternum expand and compress these air
sacs so they act rather like bellows and pump air through the lungs. The evolution of this
extremely eﬃcient system of breathing has enabled birds to migrate vast distances and ﬂy
at altitudes higher than the summit of Everest.

9.8 Summary
• Animals need to breathe to supply the cells with oxygen and remove the waste product
carbon dioxide .
• The lungs are situated in the pleural cavities of the thorax .
• Gas exchange occurs in the alveoli of the lungs that provide a large surface area. Here
oxygen diﬀuses from the alveoli into the red blood cells in the capillaries that surround
the alveoli. Carbon dioxide, at high concentration in the blood, diﬀuses into the alveoli
to be breathed out.
• Inspiration occurs when muscle contraction causes the ribs to move up and out and the
diaphragm to ﬂatten. These movements increase the volume of the pleural cavity and
draw air down the respiratory system into the lungs.
• The air enters the nasal cavity and passes to the pharynx and larynx where the epiglottis closes the opening to the lungs during swallowing. the air passes down the trachea
kept open by rings of cartilage to the bronchi and bronchioles and then to the alveoli.
• Expiration is a passive process requiring no energy as it relies on the relaxation of the
muscles and recoil of the elastic tissue of the lungs.

117

Respiratory System
• The rate of breathing is determined by the concentration of carbon dioxide in the blood.
As carbon dioxide makes blood acidic, the rate of breathing helps control the acid/base
balance of the blood.
• The cells lining the respiratory passages produce mucus which traps dust particles, which
are wafted into the nose by cilia.

10.1 Objectives
After completing this section, you should know:
•
•
•
•

the function of the lymphatic system
what the terms tissue ﬂuid, lymph, lymphocyte and lymphatic mean
how lymph is formed and what is in it
the basic structure and function of a lymph node and the position of some important
lymph nodes in the body
• the route by which lymph circulates in the body and is returned to the blood system
• the location and function of the spleen, thymus and lacteals

10.2 Lymphatic System
When tissue ﬂuid enters the small blind-ended lymphatic capillaries that form a network between the cells it becomes lymph . Lymph is a clear watery ﬂuid that is very similar
to blood plasma except that it contains large numbers of white blood cells, mostly lymphocytes . It also contains protein, cellular debris, foreign particles and bacteria. Lymph that
comes from the intestines also contains many fat globules following the absorption of fat
from the digested food into the lymphatics (lacteals ) of the villi (see chapter 11 for more
on these). From the lymph capillaries the lymph ﬂows into larger tubes called lymphatic
vessels. These carry the lymph back to join the blood circulation (see diagrams 10.1 and
10.2).
Figure 94

Diagram 10.1 - A capillary bed with lymphatic capillaries

121

Lymphatic System

10.2.1 Lymphatic vessels
Lymphatic vessels have several similarities to veins. Both are thin walled and return ﬂuid
to the right hand side of the heart. The movement of the ﬂuid in both is brought about
by the contraction of the muscles that surround them and both have valves to prevent
backﬂow. One important diﬀerence is that lymph passes through at least one lymph node
or gland before it reaches the blood system (see diagram 10.2). These ﬁlter out used cell
parts, cancer cells and bacteria and help defend the body from infection.
Lymph nodes are of various sizes and shapes and found throughout the body and the
more important ones are shown in diagram 10.3. They consist of lymph tissue surrounded
by a ﬁbrous sheath. Lymph ﬂows into them through a number of incoming vessels. It
then trickles through small channels where white cells called macrophages (derived from
monocytes ) remove the bacteria and debris by engulﬁng and digesting them (see diagram
10.4). The lymph then leaves the lymph nodes through outgoing vessels to continue its
journey towards the heart where it rejoins the blood circulation (see diagrams 10.2 and
10.3).

Figure 95

Figure 96

Diagram 10.3 - The circulation of lymph with major lymph nodes

122

Lymphatic System

Figure 97

Diagram 10.4 - A lymph node
As well as ﬁltering the lymph, lymph nodes produce the white cells known as lymphocytes
. Lymphocytes are also produced by the thymus , spleen and bone marrow . There are
two kinds of lymphocyte. The ﬁrst attach invading micro organisms directly while others
produce antibodies that circulate in the blood and attack them.
The function of the lymphatic system can therefore be summarized as transport and defense. It is important for returning the ﬂuid and proteins that have escaped from the blood
capillaries to the blood system and is also responsible for picking up the products of fat
digestion in the small intestine. Its other essential function is as part of the immune system,
defending the body against infection.

10.2.2 Problems with lymph nodes and the lymphatic system
During infection of the body the lymph nodes often become swollen and tender because
of their increased activity. This is what causes the swollen ‘glands’ in your neck during
throat infections, mumps and tonsillitis. Sometimes the bacteria multiply in the lymph
node and cause inﬂammation. Cancer cells may also be carried to the lymph nodes and
then transported to other parts of the body where they may multiply to form a secondary
growth or metastasis . The lymphatic system may therefore contribute to the spread of
cancer. Inactivity of the muscles surrounding the lymphatic vessels or blockage of these
vessels causes tissue ﬂuid to ‘back up’ in the tissues resulting in swelling or oedema .

123

Lymphatic System

10.3 Other Organs Of The Lymphatic System
The spleen is an important part of the lymphatic system. It is a deep red organ situated
in the abdomen caudal to the stomach (see diagram 10.3). It is composed of two diﬀerent
types of tissue. The ﬁrst type makes and stores lymphocytes, the cells of the immune
system. The second type of tissue destroys worn out red blood cells, breaking down the
haemoglobin into iron, which is recycled, and waste products that are excreted. The spleen
also stores red blood cells. When severe blood loss occurs, it contracts and releases them
into the circulation.
The thymus is a large pink organ lying just under the sternum (breastbone) just cranial
to the heart (see diagram 10.1). It has an important function processing lymphocytes so
they are capable of recognising and attacking foreign invaders like bacteria.
Other lymph organs are the bone marrow of the long bones where lymphocytes are produced and lymph nodules , which are like tiny lymph nodes. Large clusters of these are
found in the wall of the small intestine (called Peyer’s Patches) and in the tonsils.

10.4 Summary
• Fluid leaks out of the thin walled capillaries as they pass through the tissues. This is
called tissue ﬂuid .
• Much of tissue ﬂuid passes back into the capillaries. Some enters the blind-ended lymphatic capillaries that form a network between the cells of the tissues. This ﬂuid is called
lymph .
• Lymph ﬂows from the lymphatic capillaries to lymph vessels , passing through
lymph nodes and along the thoracic duct to join the blood system.
• Lymph nodes ﬁlter the lymph and produce lymphocytes .
• Other organs of the lymphatic system are the spleen, thymus, bone marrow , and
lymph nodules .

The Gut and Digestion

11.1 Objectives
After completing this section, you should know:
• what is meant by the terms: ingestion, digestion, absorption, assimilation, egestion,
peristalsis and chyme
• the characteristics, advantages and disadvantages of a herbivorous, carnivorous and omnivorous diet
• the 4 main functions of the gut
• the parts of the gut in the order in which the food passes down it

11.2 The Gut And Digestion
Plant cells are made of organic molecules using energy from the sun. This process is called
photosynthesis . Animals rely on these ready-made organic molecules to supply them with
their food. Some animals (herbivores) eat plants; some (carnivores) eat the herbivores.

11.3 Herbivores
Herbivoreseat plant material. While no animal produces the digestive enzymes to break
down the large cellulose molecules in the plant cell walls, micro-organisms’ like bacteria,
on the other hand, can break them down. Therefore herbivores employ micro-organisms to
do the job for them.
There are three types of herbivore:
The ﬁrst, ruminants like cattle, sheep and goats, house these bacteria in a special compartment in the enlarged stomach called the rumen .
The second group has an enlarged large intestine and caecum, called a functional caecum
, occupied
by cellulose digesting micro-organisms. These non-ruminant herbivores include the horse,
rabbit and rat.
Humans also have a cecum and can be classiﬁed as the third type of herbivorous class, along
with orangutans and gorillas.
Plants are a primary pure and good source of nutrients, however they are digested very
easily and therefore herbivores have to eat large quantities of food to obtain all they require.
Herbivores like cows, horses and rabbits typically spend much of their day feeding. To give
the micro- organisms access to the cellulose molecules, the plant cell walls need to be broken
down. This is why herbivores have teeth that are adapted to crush and grind. Their guts
also tend to be lengthy and the food takes a long time to pass through it.
Eating plants have other advantages. Plants are immobile so herbivores normally have to
spend little energy collecting them. This contrasts with another main group of animals the carnivores that often have to chase their prey.

128

Carnivores

11.4 Carnivores
Carnivorous animals like those in the cat and dog families, polar bears, seals, crocodiles
and birds of prey catch and eat other animals. They often have to use large amounts of
energy ﬁnding, stalking, catching and killing their prey. However, they are rewarded by
the fact that meat provides a very concentrated source of nutrients. Carnivores in the wild
therefore tend to eat distinct meals often with long and irregular intervals between them.
Time after feeding is spent digesting and absorbing the food.
The guts of carnivores are usually shorter and less complex than those of herbivores because meat is easier to digest than plant material. Carnivores usually have teeth that are
specialised for dealing with ﬂesh, gristle and bone. They have sleek bodies, strong, sharp
claws and keen senses of smell, hearing and sight. They are also often cunning, alert and
have an aggressive nature.

11.5 Omnivores
Many animals feed on both animal and vegetable material – they are omnivorous. Most
primates, including humans, are herbivorous but a few, such as chimpanzees belong to this
category as do pigs and rats. Their food is diverse, ranging from plant material to animals
they have either killed themselves or scavenged from other carnivores. Omnivores lack the
specialised teeth and guts of carnivores and herbivores but are often highly intelligent and
adaptable reﬂecting their varied diet.

11.6 Treatment Of Food
Whether an animal eats plants or ﬂesh, the carbohydrates , fats and proteins in the
food it eats are generally giant molecules (see chapter 1). These need to be split up into
smaller ones before they can pass into the blood and enter the cells to be used for energy
or to make new cell constituents.
For example:
Carbohydrates like cellulose, starch, and glycogen need to be split into glucose and
other monosaccharides ;
Proteins need to be split into amino acids ;
Fats or lipids need to be split into fatty acids and glycerol .

11.7 The Gut
The digestive tract, alimentary canal or gut is a hollow tube stretching from the mouth
to the anus. It is the organ system concerned with the treatment of foods.

129

The Gut and Digestion
At the mouth the large food molecules are taken into the gut - this is called ingestion .
They must then be broken down into smaller ones by digestive enzymes - digestion , before
they can be taken from the gut into the blood stream - absorption . The cells of the body
can then use these small molecules - assimilation . The indigestible waste products are
eliminated from the body by the act of egestion (see diagram 11.1).
Figure 99

Diagram 11.1 - From ingestion to egestion
The 4 major functions of the gut are:
1. Transporting the food;
2. Processing the food physically by breaking it up (chewing), mixing, adding ﬂuid etc.
3. Processing the food chemically by adding digestive enzymes to split large food molecules
into smaller ones.
4. Absorbing these small molecules into the blood stream so the body can use them.
The regions of a typical mammals gut (for example a cat or dog) are shown in diagram
11.2.

130

The Gut

Figure 100

Diagram 11.2 - A typical mammalian gut
The food that enters the mouth passes to the oesophagus , then to the stomach , small
intestine , cecum , large intestine , rectum and ﬁnally undigested material exits at
the anus . The liver and pancreas produce secretions that aid digestion and the gall
bladder stores bile . Herbivores have an appendix which they use for the digestion of
cellulose. Carnivores have an appendix but is not of any function anymore due to the fact
that their diet is not based on cellulose anymore.

131

The Gut and Digestion

11.8 Mouth
The mouth takes food into the body. The lips hold the food inside the mouth during
chewing and allow the baby animal to suck on its mother’s teat. In elephants the lips (and
nose) have developed into the trunk which is the main food collecting tool. Some mammals,
e.g. hamsters, have stretchy cheek pouches that they use to carry food or material to make
their nests.
The sight or smell of food and its presence in the mouth stimulates the salivary glands
to secrete saliva . There are four pairs of these glands in cats and dogs (see diagram 11.3).
The ﬂuid they produce moistens and softens the food making it easier to swallow. It also
contains the enzyme, salivary amylase , which starts the digestion of starch.
The tongue moves food around the mouth and rolls it into a ball for swallowing. Taste
buds are located on the tongue and in dogs and cats it is covered with spiny projections
used for grooming and lapping. The cow’s tongue is prehensile and wraps around grass to
graze it.
Swallowing is a complex reﬂex involving 25 diﬀerent muscles. It pushes food into the
oesophagus and at the same time a small ﬂap of tissue called the epiglottis closes oﬀ the
windpipe so food doesn’t go ‘down the wrong way’ and choke the animal (see diagram 11.4).

Figure 101

Diagram 11.3 - Salivary glands

132

Teeth

Figure 102

Diagram 11.4 - Section through the head of a dog

11.9 Teeth
Teeth seize, tear and grind food. They are inserted into sockets in the bone and consist of
a crown above the gum and root below. The crown is covered with a layer of enamel , the
hardest substance in the body. Below this is the dentine , a softer but tough and shock
resistant material. At the centre of the tooth is a space ﬁlled with pulp which contains
blood vessels and nerves. The tooth is cemented into the socket and in most teeth the
tip of the root is quite narrow with a small opening for the blood vessels and nerves (see
diagram 11.5).
In teeth that grow continuously, like the incisors of rodents, the opening remains large and
these teeth are called open rooted teeth . Mammals have 2 distinct sets of teeth. The
ﬁrst the milk teeth are replaced by the permanent teeth .

133

The Gut and Digestion

Figure 103

Diagram 11.5 - Structure of a tooth

11.9.1 Types Of Teeth
All the teeth of ﬁsh and reptiles are similar but mammals usually have four diﬀerent types
of teeth.
The incisors are the chisel-shaped ‘biting oﬀ’ teeth at the front of the mouth. In rodents
and rabbits the incisors never stop growing (open-rooted teeth). They must be worn or
ground down continuously by gnawing. They have hard enamel on one surface only so they
wear unevenly and maintain their sharp cutting edge.
The largest incisors in the animal kingdom are found in elephants, for tusks are actually
giant incisors. Sloths have no incisors at all, and sheep have no incisors in the upper jaw
(see diagram 11.6). Instead there is a horny pad against which the bottom incisors cut.
The canines or ‘wolf-teeth’ are long, cone-shaped teeth situated just behind the incisors.
They are particularly well developed in the dog and cat families where they are used to
hold, stab and kill the prey (see diagram 11.7).
The tusks of boars and walruses are large canines while rodents and herbivores like sheep
have no (or reduced) canines. In these animals the space where the canines would normally
be is called the diastema . In rodents like the rat and beaver it allows the debris from
gnawing to be expelled easily.

134

Teeth
The cheek teeth or premolars and molars crush and grind the food. They are particularly
well developed in herbivores where they have complex ridges that form broad grinding
surfaces (see diagram 11.6). These are created from alternating bands of hard enamel and
softer dentine that wear at diﬀerent rates.
In carnivores the premolars and molars slice against each other like scissors and are called
carnassial teeth see diagram 11.7). They are used for shearing ﬂesh and bone.

11.9.2 Dental Formula
The numbers of the diﬀerent kinds of teeth can be expressed in a dental formula . This
gives the numbers of incisors, canines, premolars and molars in one half of the mouth. The
numbers of these four types of teeth in the left or right half of the upper jaw are written
above a horizontal line and the four types of teeth in the right or left half of the lower
jaw are written below it.
Thus the dental formula for the sheep is:
0.0.3.3
3.1.3.3
It indicates that in the upper right (or left) half of the jaw there are no incisors or canines
(i.e. there is a diastema ), three premolars and three molars. In the lower right (or left)
half of the jaw are three incisors, one canine, three premolars and three molars (see diagram
11.6).

135

The Gut and Digestion

Figure 104

Diagram 11.6 - A sheep’s skull
The dental formula for a dog is:
3.1.4.2
3.1.4.3
The formula indicates that in the right (or left) half of the upper jaw there are three incisors,
one canine, four premolars and two molars. In the right (or left) half of the lower jaw there
are three incisors, one canine, four premolars and three molars (see diagram 11.7).

136

Oesophagus

Figure 105

Diagram 11.7 - A dog’s skull

11.10 Oesophagus
The oesophagus transports food to the stomach. Food is moved along the oesophagus,
as it is along the small and large intestines, by contraction of the smooth muscles in the
walls that push the food along rather like toothpaste along a tube. This movement is called
peristalsis (see diagram 11.8).

Figure 106

Diagram 11.8 - Peristalsis

137

The Gut and Digestion

11.11 Stomach
The stomach stores and mixes the food. Glands in the wall secrete gastric juice that
contains enzymes to digest protein and fats as well as hydrochloric acid to make the
contents very acidic. The walls of the stomach are very muscular and churn and mix the
food with the gastric juice to form a watery mixture called chyme (pronounced kime).
Rings of muscle called sphincters at the entrance and exit to the stomach control the
movement of food into and out of it (see diagram 11.9).

Figure 107

Diagram 11.9 - The stomach

11.12 Small Intestine
Most of the breakdown of the large food molecules and absorption of the smaller molecules
take place in the long and narrow small intestine. The total length varies but it is about
6.5 metres in humans, 21 metres in the horse, 40 metres in the ox and over 150 metres in
the blue whale.
It is divided into 3 sections: the duodenum (after the stomach), jejunum and ileum. The
duodenum receives 3 diﬀerent secretions:
1) Bile from the liver;
2) Pancreatic juice from the pancreas and
3) Intestinal juice from glands in the intestinal wall.

138

The Rumen
These complete the digestion of starch, fats and protein. The products of digestion are
absorbed into the blood and lymphatic system through the wall of the intestine, which is
lined with tiny ﬁnger-like projections called villi that increase the surface area for more
eﬃcient absorption (see diagram 11.10).

Figure 108

Diagram 11.10 - The wall of the small intestine showing villi

11.13 The Rumen
In ruminant herbivores like cows, sheep and antelopes the stomach is highly modiﬁed to
act as a “fermentation vat”. It is divided into four parts. The largest part is called the
rumen . In the cow it occupies the entire left half of the abdominal cavity and can hold
up to 270 litres. The reticulum is much smaller and has a honeycomb of raised folds on
its inner surface. In the camel the reticulum is further modiﬁed to store water. The next
part is called the omasum with a folded inner surface. Camels have no omasum. The ﬁnal
compartment is called the abomasum . This is the ‘true’ stomach where muscular walls
churn the food and gastric juice is secreted (see diagram 11.11).

139

The Gut and Digestion

Figure 109

Diagram 11.11 - The rumen
Ruminants swallow the grass they graze almost without chewing and it passes down the
oesophagus to the rumen and reticulum. Here liquid is added and the muscular walls churn
the food. These chambers provide the main fermentation vat of the ruminant stomach.
Here bacteria and single-celled animals start to act on the cellulose plant cell walls. These
organisms break down the cellulose to smaller molecules that are absorbed to provide the cow
or sheep with energy. In the process, the gases methane and carbon dioxide are produced.
These cause the “burps” you may hear cows and sheep making.
Not only do the micro-organisms break down the cellulose but they also produce the vitamins E, B and K for use by the animal. Their digested bodies provide the ruminant with
the majority of its protein requirements.
In the wild grazing is a dangerous activity as it exposes the herbivore to predators. They
crop the grass as quickly as possible and then when the animal is in a safer place the food
in the rumen can be regurgitated to be chewed at the animal’s leisure. This is ‘chewing the
cud’ or rumination . The ﬁnely ground food may be returned to the rumen for further
work by the microorganisms or, if the particles are small enough, it will pass down a special
groove in the wall of the oesophagus straight into the omasum. Here the contents are
kneaded and water is absorbed before they pass to the abomasum. The abomasum acts as
a “proper” stomach and gastric juice is secreted to digest the protein.

11.14 Large Intestine
The large intestine consists of the caecum , colon and rectum . The chyme from the
small intestine that enters the colon consists mainly of water and undigested material such
as cellulose (ﬁbre or roughage). In omnivores like the pig and humans the main function of

140

Functional Caecum
the colon is absorption of water to give solid faeces. Bacteria in this part of the gut produce
vitamins B and K.
The caecum, which forms a dead-end pouch where the small intestine joins the large intestine, is small in pigs and humans and helps water absorption. However, in rabbits, rodents
and horses, the caecum is very large and called the functional caecum . It is here that
cellulose is digested by micro-organisms. The appendix , a narrow dead end tube at the
end of the caecum, is particularly large in primates but seems to have no digestive function.

11.15 Functional Caecum
The caecum in the rabbit, rat and guinea pig is greatly enlarged to provide a “fermentation
vat” for micro-organisms to break down the cellulose plant cell walls. This is called a
functional caecum (see diagram 11.12). In the horse both the caecum and the colon
are enlarged. As in the rumen, the large cellulose molecules are broken down to smaller
molecules that can be absorbed. However, the position of the functional caecum after the
main areas of digestion and absorption, means it is potentially less eﬀective than the rumen.
This means that the small molecules that are produced there can not be absorbed by the
gut but pass out in the faeces. The rabbit and rodents (and foals) solve this problem by
eating their own faeces so that they pass through the gut a second time and the products
of cellulose digestion can be absorbed in the small intestine. Rabbits produce two kinds of
faeces. Softer night-time faeces are eaten directly from the anus and the harder pellets you
are probably familiar with, that have passed through the gut twice.

The Gut and Digestion
Diagram 11.12 - The gut of a rabbit

11.16 The Gut Of Birds
Birds’ guts have important diﬀerences from mammals’ guts. Most obviously, birds have a
beak instead of teeth. Beaks are much lighter than teeth and are an adaptation for ﬂight.
Imagine a bird trying to take oﬀ and ﬂy with a whole set of teeth in its head! At the base of
the oesophagus birds have a bag-like structure called a crop . In many birds the crop stores
food before it enters the stomach, while in pigeons and doves glands in the crop secretes
a special ﬂuid called crop-milk which parent birds regurgitate to feed their young. The
stomach is also modiﬁed and consists of two compartments. The ﬁrst is the true stomach
with muscular walls and enzyme secreting glands. The second compartment is the gizzard
. In seed eating birds this has very muscular walls and contains pebbles swallowed by the
bird to help grind the food. This is the reason why you must always supply a caged bird
with grit. In birds of prey like the falcon the walls of the gizzard are much thinner and
expand to accommodate large meals (see diagram 11.13).

Figure 111

Diagram 11.13 - The stomach and small intestine of a hen

11.17 Digestion
During digestion the large food molecules are broken down into smaller molecules by enzymes . The three most important groups of enzymes secreted into the gut are:
1. Amylases that split carbohydrates like starch and glycogen into monosaccharides
like glucose.

142

Pancreatic juice
2. Proteases that split proteins into amino acids.
3. Lipases that split lipids or fats into fatty acids and glycerol.
Glands produce various secretions which mix with the food as it passes along the gut.
These secretions include:
1. Saliva secreted into the mouth from several pairs of salivary glands (see diagram
11.3). Saliva consists mainly of water but contains salts, mucous and salivary amylase. The function of saliva is to lubricate food as it is chewed and swallowed and
salivary amylase begins the digestion of starch.
2. Gastric juice secreted into the stomach from glands in its walls. Gastric juice
contains pepsin that breaks down protein and hydrochloric acid to produce the
acidic conditions under which this enzyme works best. In baby animals rennin to
digest milk is also produced in the stomach.
3. Bile produced by the liver. It is stored in the gall bladder and secreted into the
duodenum via the bile duct (see diagram 11.14). (Note that the horse, deer, parrot
and rat have no gall bladder). Bile is not a digestive enzyme. Its function is to break
up large globules of fat into smaller ones so the fat splitting enzymes can gain access
the fat molecules.

Figure 112

Diagram 11.14 - The liver, gall bladder and pancreas

11.18 Pancreatic juice
The pancreas is a gland located near the beginning of the duodenum (see diagram 11.14).
In most animals it is large and easily seen but in rodents and rabbits it lies within the
membrane linking the loops of the intestine (the mesentery ) and is quite diﬃcult to ﬁnd.
Pancreatic juice is produced in the pancreas. It ﬂows into the duodenum and contains
amylase for digesting starch, lipase for digesting fats and protease for digesting proteins.

143

The Gut and Digestion

11.19 Intestinal juice
Intestinal juice is produced by glands in the lining of the small intestine. It contains
enzymes for digesting disaccharides and proteins as well as mucus and salts to make the
contents of the small intestine more alkaline so the enzymes can work.

11.20 Absorption
The small molecules produced by digestion are absorbed into the villi of the wall of the
small intestine . The tiny ﬁnger-like projections of the villi increase the surface area for
absorption. Glucose and amino acids pass directly through the wall into the blood stream
by diﬀusion or active transport. Fatty acids and glycerol enter vessels of the lymphatic
system (lacteals ) that run up the centre of each villus.

11.21 The Liver
The liver is situated in the abdominal cavity adjacent to the diaphragm (see diagrams 2
and 14). It is the largest single organ of the body and has over 100 known functions. Its
most important digestive functions are:
1. the production of bile to help the digestion of fats (described above) and
2. the control of blood sugar levels
Glucose is absorbed into the capillaries of the villi of the intestine. The blood stream takes
it directly to the liver via a blood vessel known as the hepatic portal vessel or vein (see
diagram 11.15).
The liver converts this glucose into glycogen which it stores. When glucose levels are low
the liver can convert the glycogen back into glucose. It releases this back into the blood to
keep the level of glucose constant. The hormone insulin , produced by special cells in the
pancreas , controls this process.

144

The Liver

Figure 113

Diagram 11.15 - The control of blood glucose by the liver
Other functions of the liver include:
3. making vitamin A ,
4. making the proteins that are found in the blood plasma (albumin, globulin and
ﬁbrinogen ),
5. storing iron ,
6. removing toxic substances like alcohol and poisons from the blood and converting
them to safer substances,
7. producing heat to help maintain the temperature of the body.

Figure 114

Diagram 11.16 - Summary of the main functions of the diﬀerent regions of the gut

11.22 Summary
• The gut breaks down plant and animal materials into nutrients that can be used by
animals’ bodies.
• Plant material is more diﬃcult to break down than animal tissue. The gut of herbivores
is therefore longer and more complex than that of carnivores . Herbivores usually have
a compartment (the rumen or functional caecum ) housing micro-organisms to break
down the cellulose wall of plants.

146

Worksheet
• Chewing by the teeth begins the food processing. There are 4 main types of teeth:
incisors, canines, premolars and molars . In dogs and cats the premolars and molars
are adapted to slice against each other and are called carnassial teeth.
• Saliva is secreted in the mouth. It lubricates the food for swallowing and contains an
enzyme to break down starch.
• Chewed food is swallowed and passes down the oesophagus by waves of contraction of
the wall called peristalsis. The food passes to the stomach where it is churned and
mixed with acidic gastric juice that begins the digestion of protein.
• The resulting chyme passes down the small intestine where enzymes that digest fats,
proteins and carbohydrates are secreted. Bile produced by the liver is also secreted here.
It helps in the breakdown of fats. Villi provide the large surface area necessary for the
absorption of the products of digestion.
• In the colon and caecum water is absorbed and micro organisms produce some vitamin
B and K . In rabbits, horses and rodents the caecum is enlarged as a functional caecum
and micro-organisms break down cellulose cell walls to simpler carbohydrates. Waste
products exit the body via the rectum and anus .
• The pancreas produces pancreatic juice that contains many of the enzymes secreted
into the small intestine.
• In addition to producing bile the liver regulates blood sugar levels by converting glucose
absorbed by the villi into glycogen and storing it. The liver also removes toxic substances
from the blood, stores iron, makes vitamin A and produces heat.

the parts of the urinary system
the structure and function of a kidney
the structure and function of a kidney tubule or nephron
the processes of ﬁltration, reabsorption, secretion and concentration that convert blood
to urine in the kidney tubule
the function of antidiuretic hormone in producing concentrated urine
the composition, storage and voiding of normal urine
abnormal constituents of urine and their signiﬁcance
the functions of the kidney in excreting nitrogenous waste, controlling water levels and
regulating salt concentrations and acid-base balance
that birds do not have a bladder

12.2 Homeostasis
The cells of an animal can only remain healthy if the conditions are just right. The processes
that take place in them are upset if the temperature is too high or too low, or if the ﬂuid
around or inside them is too acid or alkaline. Homeostasis is the name given to the
processes that help keep the internal conditions constant even when external conditions
change. The word means, “staying the same”.
There are a number of organs in the body that play a part in maintaining homeostasis. For
example, the skin helps keep the internal temperature of bird and mammals bodies within
a narrow range even when the outside temperatures change (see Chapters 5 and 16); the
lungs control the amount of carbon dioxide in the blood (see Chapters 8 and 16); the liver
and pancreas work together to keep the amount of glucose in the blood within narrow limits
(see Chapter 5) and the kidneys regulate the acidity and the concentration of water and
salt in the blood (also see Chapter 16). How the kidneys do this will be described later in
this chapter.
Hormones are chemicals that carry messages around the body in the blood and are central
to many of the homeostatic processes mentioned above. Their role will be described in more
detail in Chapter 16.

12.3 Water In The Body
Water is essential for living things to survive because all the chemical reactions within a
body take place in a solution of water. An animal’s body consists of up to 80% water. The
exact proportion depends on the type of animal, its age, sex, health and whether or not it
has had suﬃcient to drink. Generally animals do not survive a loss of more than 15% of
their body water.

150

Maintaining Water Balance
In vertebrates almost 2/3rd of this water is in the cells (intracellular ﬂuid ). The rest
is outside the cells (extracellular ﬂuid ) where it is found in the spaces around the cells
(tissue ﬂuid ), as well as in the blood and lymph.

Figure 116

Diagram 12.1 - Water in the body

12.4 Maintaining Water Balance
Animals lose water through their skin and lungs, in the faeces and urine. These losses
must be made up by water in food and drink and from the water that is a by-product of
chemical reactions. If the animal does not manage to compensate for water loss the dissolved
substances in the blood may become so concentrated they become lethal. To prevent this
happening various mechanisms come into play as soon as the concentration of the blood
increases. A part of the brain called the hypothalamus is in charge of these homeostatic
processes. The most important is the feeling of thirst that is triggered by an increase in
blood concentration. This stimulates an animal to ﬁnd water and drink it.
The kidneys are also involved in maintaining water balance as various hormones instruct
them to produce more concentrated urine and so retain some of the water that would
otherwise be lost (see later in this Chapter and Chapter 16).

151

Urinary System

12.4.1 Desert Animals
Coping with water loss is a particular problem for animals that live in dry conditions. Some,
like the camel, have developed great tolerance for dehydration. For example, under some
conditions, camels can withstand the loss of one third of their body mass as water. They
can also survive wide daily changes in temperature. This means they do not have to use
large quantities of water in sweat to cool the body by evaporation.
Smaller animals are more able than large ones to avoid extremes of temperature or dry
conditions by resting in sheltered more humid situations during the day and being active
only at night.
The kangaroo rat is able to survive without access to any drinking water at all because it
does not sweat and produces extremely concentrated urine. Water from its food and from
chemical processes is suﬃcient to supply all its requirements.

12.5 Excretion
Animals need to excrete because they take in substances that are excess to the body’s
requirements and many of the chemical reactions in the body produce waste products. If
these substances were not removed they would poison cells or slow down metabolism. All
animals therefore have some means of getting rid of these wastes.
The major waste products in mammals are carbon dioxide that is removed by the lungs,
and urea that is produced when excess amino acids (from proteins) are broken down. Urea
is ﬁltered from the blood by the kidneys.

12.6 The Kidneys And Urinary System
The kidneys in mammals are bean-shaped organs that lie in the abdominal cavity attached
to the dorsal wall on either side of the spine (see diagram 12.2). An artery from the dorsal
aorta called the renal artery supplies blood to them and the renal vein drains them.

153

Urinary System

Figure 118

Diagram 12.3 - The urinary system
To the naked eye kidneys seem simple enough organs. They are covered by a ﬁbrous coat
or capsule and if cut in half lengthways (longitudinally) two distinct regions can be seen an inner region or medulla and the outer cortex . A cavity within the kidney called the
pelvis collects the urine and carries it to the ureter , which connects with the bladder
where the urine is stored temporarily. Rings of muscle (sphincters ) control the release of
urine from the bladder and the urine leaves the body through the urethra (see diagrams
12.3 and 12.4).

12.7 Kidney Tubules Or Nephrons
It is only when you examine kidneys under the microscope that you ﬁnd that their structure
is not simple at all. The cortex and medulla are seen to be composed of masses of tiny tubes.
These are called kidney tubules or nephrons (see diagrams 12.5 and 12.6). A human
kidney consists of over a million of them.

155

Urinary System

Figure 120

Diagram 12.5 - Several kidney tubules or nephrons

Figure 121

Diagram 12.6 - A kidney tubule or nephron
At one end of each nephron, in the cortex of the kidney, is a cup shaped structure called the
(Bowman’s or renal ) capsule . It surrounds a tuft of capillaries called the glomerulus
that carries high-pressure blood. Together the glomerulus and capsule act as a blood-

156

Kidney Tubules Or Nephrons
ﬁltering device (see diagram 12.7). The holes in the ﬁlter allow most of the contents of
the blood through except the red and white cells and large protein molecules. The ﬂuid
ﬂowing from the capsule into the rest of the kidney tubule is therefore very similar to blood
plasma and contains many useful substances like water, glucose, salt and amino acids. It
also contains waste products like urea .

12.7.1 Processes Occurring In The Nephron
After entering the glomerulus the ﬁltered ﬂuid ﬂows along a coiled part of the tubule (the
proximal convoluted tubule ) to a looped portion (the Loop of Henle ) and then to
the collecting tube via a second length of coiled tube (the distal convoluted tubule
) (see diagram 12.6). From the collecting ducts the urine ﬂows into the renal pelvis and
enters the ureter .
Note that the glomerulus, capsule and both coiled parts of the tubule are all situated in
the cortex of the kidney while the loops of Henle and collecting ducts make up the medulla
(see diagram 12.5).
As the ﬂuid ﬂows along the proximal convoluted tubule useful substances like glucose, water,
salts, potassium ions, calcium ions and amino acids are reabsorbed into the blood capillaries that form a network around the tubules. Many of these substances are transported
by active transport and energy is required.

Figure 122

Diagram 12.7 - Filtration in the glomerulus and capsule

157

Urinary System
In a separate process, some substances, particularly potassium, ammonium and hydrogen
ions, and drugs like penicillin, are actively secreted into the distal convoluted tubule.
By the time the ﬂuid has reached the collecting ducts these processes of absorption and
secretion have changed the ﬂuid originally ﬁltered into the Bowman’s capsule into urine.
The main function of the collecting ducts is then to remove more water from the urine if
necessary. These processes are summarised in diagram 12.8.
Normal urine consists of water, in which waste products such as urea and salts such as
sodium chloride are dissolved. Pigments from the breakdown of red blood cells give urine
its yellow colour.

12.7.2 The Production Of Concentrated Urine
Because of the high pressure of the blood in the glomerulus and the large size of the pores in
the glomerulus/capsule-ﬁltering device, an enormous volume of ﬂuid passes into the kidney
tubules. If this ﬂuid were left as it is, the animal’s body would be drained dry in 30 minutes.
In fact, as the ﬂuid ﬂows down the tubule, over 90% of the water in it is reabsorbed. The
main part of this reabsorption takes place in the collecting tubes.
The amount of water removed from the collecting ducts is controlled by a hormone called
antidiuretic hormone (ADH) produced by the pituitary gland , situated at the base
of the brain. When the blood becomes more concentrated, as happens when an animal is
deprived of water, ADH is secreted and causes more water to be absorbed from the collecting
ducts so that concentrated urine is produced. When the animal has drunk plenty of water
and the blood is dilute, no ADH is secreted and no or little water is absorbed from the
collecting ducts, so dilute urine is produced. In this way the concentration of the blood is
controlled precisely.

158

Water Balance In Fish And Marine Animals

Figure 123

Diagram 12.8 - Summary of the processes involved in the formation of urine

12.8 Water Balance In Fish And Marine Animals
12.8.1 Fresh Water Fish
Although the skin of ﬁsh is more or less waterproof, the gills are very porous. The body
ﬂuids of ﬁsh that live in fresh water have a higher concentration of dissolved substances
than the water in which they swim. In other words the body ﬂuids of fresh water ﬁsh are
hypertonic to the water (see chapter 3). Water therefore ﬂows into the body by osmosis
. To stop the body ﬂuids being constantly diluted fresh water ﬁsh produce large quantities
of dilute urine.

12.8.2 Marine Fish
Marine ﬁsh like the sharks and dogﬁsh have body ﬂuids that have the same concentration
of dissolved substances as the water (isotonic ) have little problem with water balance.
However, marine bony ﬁsh like red cod, snapper and sole, have body ﬂuids with a lower

159

Urinary System
concentration of dissolved substances than seawater (they are hypotonic to seawater). This
means that water tends to ﬂow out of their bodies by osmosis. To make up this ﬂuid loss
they drink seawater and get rid of the excess salt by excreting it from the gills.

12.8.3 Marine Birds
Marine birds that eat marine ﬁsh take in large quantities of salt and some only have access
to seawater for drinking. Bird’s kidneys are unable to produce very concentrated urine, so
they have developed a salt gland. This excretes a concentrated salt solution into the nose
to get rid of the excess salt.

12.9 Diabetes And The Kidney
There are two types of diabetes. The most common is called sugar diabetes or diabetes
mellitus and is common in cats and dogs especially if they are overweight. It is caused
by the pancreas secreting insuﬃcient insulin , the hormone that controls the amount of
glucose in the blood. If insulin secretion is inadequate, the concentration of glucose in the
blood increases. Any increase in the glucose in the blood automatically leads to an increase
in glucose in the ﬂuid ﬁltered into the kidney tubule. Normally the kidney removes all the
glucose ﬁltered into it, but these high concentrations swamp this removal mechanism and
urine containing glucose is produced. The main symptoms of this type of diabetes are the
production of large amounts of dilute urine containing glucose, and excessive thirst.
The second type of diabetes is called diabetes insipidus . The name comes from the main
symptom, which is the production of large amounts of very dilute and “tasteless” urine. It
occurs when the pituitary gland produces insuﬃcient ADH, the hormone that stimulates
water re-absorption from the kidney tubule. When this hormone is lacking, water is not
absorbed and large amounts of dilute urine are produced. Because so much water is lost in
the urine, animals with this form of diabetes can die if deprived of water for only a day or
so.

12.10 Other Functions Of The Kidney
The excretion of urea from the body and the maintenance of water balance, as described
above, are the main functions of the kidney. However, the kidneys have other roles in
keeping conditions in the body stable i.e. in maintaining homeostasis. These include:
• controlling the concentration of salt ions (Na+, K+, Cl-) in the blood by adjusting how
much is excreted or retained;
• maintaining the correct acidity of the blood. Excess acid is constantly being produced
by the normal chemical reactions in the body and the kidney eliminates this.

160

Normal Urine

12.11 Normal Urine
Normal urine consists of water (95%), urea, salts (mostly sodium chloride) and pigments
(mostly from bile) that give it its characteristic colour.

12.12 Abnormal Ingredients Of Urine
If the body is not working properly, small amounts of substances not normally present may
be found in the urine or substances normally present may appear in abnormal amounts.
• The presence of glucose may indicate diabetes (see above).
• Urine with red blood cells in it is called haematuria , and may indicate inﬂammation
of the kidney,or urinary tract, cancer or a blow to the kidneys.
• Sometimes free haemoglobin is found in the urine. This indicates that the red
blood cells in the blood have haemolysed (the membrane has broken down) and the
haemoglobin has passed into the kidney tubules.
• The presence of white blood cells in the urine indicates there is an infection in the
kidney or urinary tract.
• Protein molecules are usually too large to pass into the kidney tubule so no or only
small amounts of proteins like albumin is normally found in urine. Large quantities of
albumin indicate that the kidney tubules have been injured or the kidney has become
diseased. High blood pressure also pushes proteins from the blood into the tubules.
• Casts are tiny cylinders of material that have been shed from the lining of the tubules
and ﬂushed out into the urine.
• Mucus is not usually found in the urine of healthy animals but is a normal constituent
of horses’ urine, giving it a characteristic cloudy appearance.
Tests can be carried out to identify any abnormal ingredients of urine. These tests are
normally done by “stix ”, which are small plastic strips with absorbent ends impregnated
with various chemicals. A colour change occurs in the presence of an abnormal ingredient.

12.13 Excretion In Birds
Birds’ high body temperature and level of activity means that they need to conserve water.
Birds therefore do not have a bladder and instead of excreting urea, which needs to be
dissolved in large amounts of water, birds produce uric acid that can be discharged as a
thick paste along with the feces. This is the white chalky part of the bird droppings that
land on you or your car.

12.14 Summary
• The excretory system consists of paired kidneys and associated blood supply. Ureters
transport urine from the kidneys to the bladder and the urethra with associated sphincter
muscles controls the release of urine.

161

Urinary System
• The kidneys have an important role in maintaining homeostasis in the body. They
excrete the waste product urea, control the concentrations of water and salt in the body
ﬂuids, and regulate the acidity of the blood.
• A kidney consists of an outer region or cortex, inner medulla and a cavity called the
pelvis that collects the urine and carries it to the ureter.
• The tissue of a kidney is composed of masses of tiny tubes called kidney tubules or
nephrons . These are the structures that make the urine.
• High-pressure blood is supplied to the nephron via a tuft of capillaries called the glomerulus . Most of the contents of the blood except the cells and large protein molecules ﬁlter
from the glomerulus into the (Bowmans) capsule. This ﬂuid ﬂows down a coiled part of
the tubule (proximal convoluted tubule ) where useful substances like glucose, amino
acids and various ions are reabsorbed. The ﬂuid ﬂows to a looped portion of the tubule
called the Loop of Henle where water is reabsorbed and then to another coiled part of
the tubule (distal convoluted tubule ) where more reabsorbtion and secretion takes
place. Finally the ﬂuid passes down the collecting duct where water is reabsorbed to
form concentrated urine.

13.2 Reproductive System
In biological terms sexual reproduction involves the union of gametes - the sperm and the
ovum - produced by two parents. Each gamete is formed by meiosis (see Chapter 3). This
means each contains only half the chromosomes of the body cells (haploid ). Fertilization
results in the joining of the male and female gametes to form a zygote which contains the
full number of chromosomes (diploid ). The zygote then starts to divide by mitosis (see
Chapter 3) to form a new animal with all its body cells containing chromosomes that are
identical to those of the original zygote (see diagram 13.1).
Diagram 13.1 - Sexual reproduction
The oﬀspring formed by sexual reproduction contain genes from both parents and show
considerable variation. For example, kittens in a litter are all diﬀerent although they (usually) have the same mother and father. In the wild this variation is important because
it means that when the environment changes some individuals may be better adapted to
survive than others. These survivors pass their “superior” genes on to their oﬀspring. In
this way the characteristics of a group of animals can gradually change over time to keep
pace with the changing environment. This “survival of the ﬁttest” or “natural selection ”
is the mechanism behind the theory of evolution .

13.3 Fertilization
In most ﬁsh and amphibia (frogs and toads) fertilisation of the egg cells takes place outside
the body. The female lays the eggs and then the male deposits his sperm on or at least
near them.

168

Sexual Reproduction In Mammals
In reptiles and birds, eggs are fertilized inside the body when the male deposits the sperm
inside the egg duct of the female. The egg is then surrounded by a resistant shell, “laid”
by the female and the embryo completes its development inside the egg.
In mammals the sperm are placed in the body of the female and the eggs are fertilized
internally. They then develop to quite an advanced stage inside the body of the female.
When they are born they are fed on milk excreted from the mammary glands and protected
by their parents until they become independent.

13.4 Sexual Reproduction In Mammals
The reproductive organs of mammals produce the gametes (sperm and egg cells), help
them fertilize and then support the developing embryo.

13.5 The Male Reproductive System
The male reproductive system consists of a pair of testes that produce sperm
(orspermatozoa ), ducts that transport the sperm to the penis and glands that add secretions to the sperm to make semen (see diagram 13.2).
The various parts of the male reproductive system with a summary of their functions are
shown in diagram 13.3.

169

Reproductive System

Figure 126

Diagram 13.2. The reproductive organs of a male dog
Figure 127

Diagram 13.3 - Diagram summarizing the functions of the male reproductive organs

13.5.1 The Testes
Sperm need temperatures between 2 to 10 degrees Centigrade lower and then the body
temperature to develop. This is the reason why the testes are located in a bag of skin called
the scrotal sacs (or scrotum ) that hangs below the body and where the evaporation
of secretions from special glands can further reduce the temperature. In many animals
(including humans) the testes descend into the scrotal sacs at birth but in some animals they
do not descend until sexual maturity and in others they only descend temporarily during
the breeding season. A mature animal in which one or both testes have not descended is
called a cryptorchid and is usually infertile.

170

The Male Reproductive System
The problem of keeping sperm at a low enough temperature is even greater in birds that
have a higher body temperature than mammals. For this reason bird’s sperm are usually
produced at night when the body temperature is lower and the sperm themselves are more
resistant to heat.
The testes consist of a mass of coiled tubes (the seminiferous orsperm producing
tubules ) in which the sperm are formed by meiosis (see diagram 13.4). Cells lying between
the seminiferous tubules produce the male sex hormone testosterone .
When the sperm are mature they accumulate in the collecting ducts and then pass to the
epididymis before moving to the sperm duct or vas deferens . The two sperm ducts
join the urethra just below the bladder, which passes through the penis and transports
both sperm and urine.
Ejaculation discharges the semen from the erect penis. It is brought about by the contraction of the epididymis, vas deferens, prostate gland and urethra.

Figure 128

171

Reproductive System
Diagram 13.4 - The testis and a magniﬁed seminiferous tubule

13.5.2 Semen
Semen consists of 10% sperm and 90% ﬂuid and as sperm pass down the ducts from testis
to penis, (accessory) glands add various secretion...

13.5.3 Accessory Glands
Three diﬀerent glands may be involved in producing the secretions in which sperm are
suspended, although the number and type of glands varies from species to species.
Seminal vesicles are important in rats, bulls, boars and stallions but are absent in cats
and dogs. When present they produce secretions that make up much of the volume of the
semen, and transport and provide nutrients for the sperm.
The prostate gland is important in dogs and humans. It produces an alkaline secretion
that neutralizes the acidity of the male urethra and female vagina.
Cowper’s glands (bulbourethral glands) have various functions in diﬀerent species. The
secretions may lubricate, ﬂush out urine or form a gelatinous plug that traps the semen
in the female reproductive system after copulation and prevents other males of the same
species fertilizing an already mated female. Cowper’s glands are absent in bears and aquatic
mammals.

13.5.4 The Penis
The penis consists of connective tissue with numerous small blood spaces in it. These ﬁll
with blood during sexual excitement causing erection.
Penis Form And Shape
Dogs, bears, seals, bats and rodents have a special bone in the penis which helps maintain
the erection (see diagram 13.2). In some animals (e.g. the bull, ram and boar) the penis has
an “S” shaped bend that allows it to fold up when not in use. In many animals the shape
of the penis is adapted to match that of the vagina. For example, the boar has a corkscrew
shaped penis, there is a pronounced twist in bulls’ and it is forked in marsupials like the
opossum. Some have spines, warts or hooks on them to help keep them in the vagina and
copulation may be extended to help retain the semen in the female system. Mating can
last up to three hours in minks, and dogs may “knot” or “tie” during mating and can not
separate until the erection has subsided.

172

The Male Reproductive System

13.5.5 Sperm
Sperm are made up of three parts: a head consisting mainly of the nucleus, a midpiece
containing many mitochondria to provide the energy and a tail that provides propulsion
(see diagram 13.5).

Figure 129

Diagram 13.5 - A sperm
A single ejaculation may contain 2-3 hundred million sperm but even in normal semen as
many as 10% of these sperm may be abnormal and infertile. Some may be dead while others
are inactive or deformed with double, giant or small heads or tails that are coiled or absent
altogether.
When there are too many abnormal sperm or when the sperm concentration is low, the
semen may not be able to fertilize an egg and the animal is infertile. Make sure you don’t
confuse infertility with impotence, which is the inability to copulate successfully.
Sperm do not live forever. They have a deﬁnite life span that varies from species to species.
They survive for between 20 days (guinea pig) to 60 days (bull) in the epididymis but once
ejaculated into the female tract they only live from 12 to 48 hours. When semen is used for
artiﬁcial insemination, storage under the right conditions can extend the life span of some
species.

13.5.6 Artiﬁcial Insemination
In many species the male can be artiﬁcially stimulated to ejaculate and the semen collected.
It can then be diluted, stored and used to inseminate females. For example bull semen can
be diluted and stored for up to 3 weeks at room temperature. If mixed with an antifreeze
solution and stored in “straws” in liquid nitrogen at minus 79o C it will keep for much longer.
Unfortunately the semen of chickens, stallions and boars can only be stored for up to 2
days.
Dilution of the semen means that one male can be used to fertilise many more females than
would occur under natural conditions. There are also advantages in the male and female
not having to make physical contact. It means that owners of females do not have to buy

173

Reproductive System
expensive males and the possibility of transmitting sexually transmitted diseases is reduced.
Routine examination of the semen for sperm concentration, quality and activity allows only
the highest quality semen to be used so a high success rate is ensured.
Since the lifespan of sperm in the female tract is so short and ova only survive from 8 to
10 hours the timing of the artiﬁcial insemination is critical. Successful conception depends
upon detecting the time that the animal is “on heat” and when ovulation occurs.

13.6 The Female Reproductive Organs
The female reproductive system consists of a pair of ovaries that produce egg cells or ova
and fallopian tubes where fertilisation occurs and which carry the fertilised ovum to the
uterus . Growth of the foetus takes place here. The cervix separates the uterus from the
vagina or birth canal, where the sperm are deposited (see diagram 13.6).

Figure 130

Diagram 13.6. - The reproductive system of a female rabbit
Note that primates like humans have a uterus with a single compartment but in most
mammals the uterus is divided into two separate parts or horns as shown in diagram 13.6.

174

The Female Reproductive Organs

13.6.1 The Ovaries
Ovaries are small oval organs situated in the abdominal cavity just ventral to the kidneys.
Most animals have a pair of ovaries but in birds only the left one is functional to reduce
weight (see below).
The ovary consists of an inner region (medulla ) and an outer region (cortex ) containing
egg cells or ova. These are formed in large numbers around the time of birth and start
to develop after the animal becomes sexually mature. A cluster of cells called the follicle
surrounds and nourishes each ovum.

13.6.2 The Ovarian Cycle
The ovarian cycle refers to the series of changes in the ovary during which the follicle
matures, the ovum is shed and the corpus luteum develops (see diagram 13.7).
Numerous undeveloped ovarian follicles are present at birth but they start to mature after
sexual maturity. In animals that normally have only one baby at a time only one ovum will
mature at once but in litter animals several will. The mature follicle consists of outer cells
that provide nourishment. Inside this is a ﬂuid-ﬁlled space that contains the ovum.
A mature follicle can be quite large, ranging from a few millimetres in small mammals to
the size of a golf ball in large animals. It bulges out from the surface of the ovary before
eventually rupturing to release the ovum into the abdominal cavity. Once the ovum has
been shed, a blood clot forms in the empty follicle. This develops into a tissue called
the corpus luteum that produces the hormone progesterone (see diagram 13.9). If
the animal becomes pregnant the corpus luteum persists, but if there is no pregnancy it
degenerates and a new ovarian cycle usually.

Diagram 13.7 - The ovarian cycle showing from the top left clockwise: the maturation of
the ovum over time, followed by ovulation and the development of the corpus luteum in the

175

Reproductive System

13.6.3 The Ovum
When the ovum is shed the nucleus is in the ﬁnal stages of meiosis (cell division). It is
surrounded by few layers of follicle cells and a tough membrane called the zona pelluc ida
(see diagram 13.8).

Figure 132

Diagram 13.8 - An ovum

13.6.4 The Oestrous Cycle
The oestrous cycle is the sequence of hormonal changes that occurs through the ovarian
cycle . These changes inﬂuence the behaviour and body changes of the female (see diagram
13.9).

Figure 133

Diagram 13.9 - The oestrous cycle
The ﬁrst hormone involved in the oestrous cycle is follicle stimulating hormone
(F.S.H.), secreted by the anterior pituitary gland (see chapter 16). It stimulates the

176

The Female Reproductive Organs
follicle to develop. As the follicle matures the outer cells begin to secrete the hormone oestrogen and this stimulates the mammary glands to develop. It also prepares the lining of
the uterus to receive a fertilised egg. Ovulation is initiated by a surge of another hormone
from the anterior pituitary, luteinising hormone (L.H.). This hormone also inﬂuences
the development of the corpus luteum, which produces progesterone , a hormone that
prepares the lining of the uterus for the fertilised ovum and readies the mammary glands
for milk production. If no pregnancy takes place the corpus luteum shrinks and the production of progesterone decreases. This causes FSH to be produced again and a new oestrous
cycle begins.
For fertilisation of the ovum by the sperm to occur, the female must be receptive to the
male at around the time of ovulation. This is when the hormones turn on the signs of “heat
”, and she is “in season ” or “in oestrous ”. These signs are turned oﬀ again at the end of
the oestrous cycle.
During the oestrous cycle the lining of the uterus (endometrium ) thickens ready for the
fertilised ovum to be implanted. If no pregnancy occurs this thickened tissue is absorbed
and the next cycle starts. In humans and other higher primates, however, the endometrium
is shed as a ﬂow of blood and instead of an oestrous cycle there is a menstrual cycle .
The length of the oestrous cycle varies from species to species. In rats the cycle only lasts
4-5 days and they are sexually receptive for about 14 hours. Dogs have a cycle that lasts
60-70 days and heat lasts 7-9 days and horses have a 21-day cycle and heat lasts an average
of 6 days.
Ovulation is spontaneous in most animals but in some, e.g. the cat, and the rabbit,
ovulation is stimulated by mating. This is called induced ovulation .

13.6.5 Signs Of Oestrous Or Heat
• When on heat a bitch has a blood stained discharge from the vulva that changes a little
later to a straw coloured one that attracts all the dogs in the neighbourhood.
• Female cats “call” at night, roll and tread the carpet and are generally restless but will
“stand” ﬁrm when pressure is placed on the pelvic region (this is the lordosis response).
• A female rat shows the lordosis response when on heat. It will “mount” other females
and be more active than normal.
• A cow mounts other cows (bulling), bellows, is restless and has a discharge from the
vulva.

13.6.6 Breeding Seasons And Breeding Cycles
Only a few animals breed throughout the year. This includes the higher primates (humans,
gorillas and chimpanzees etc.), pigs, mice and rabbits. These are known as continuous
breeders .
Most other animals restrict reproduction to one or two seasons in the year-seasonal breeders (see diagram 13.10). There are several reasons for this. It means the young can be born
at the time (usually spring) when feed is most abundant and temperatures are favourable.
It is also sensible to restrict the breeding season because courtship, mating, gestation and

177

Reproductive System
the rearing of young can exhaust the energy resources of an animal as well as make them
more vulnerable to predators.

Figure 134

Diagram 13.10 - Breeding cycles
The timing of the breeding cycle is often determined by day length. For example the
shortening day length in autumn will bring sheep and cows into season so the foetus can
gestate through the winter and be born in spring. In cats the increasing day length after
the winter solstice (shortest day) stimulates breeding. The number of times an animal
comes into season during the year varies, as does the number of oestrous cycles during each
season. For example a dog usually has 2-3 seasons per year, each usually consisting of just
one oestrous cycle. In contrast ewes usually restrict breeding to one season and can continue
to cycle as many as 20 times if they fail to become pregnant.

13.7 Fertilisation and Implantation
13.7.1 Fertilisation
The opening of the fallopian tube lies close to the ovary and after ovulation the ovum is
swept into its funnel-like opening and is moved along it by the action of cilia and wave-like
contractions of the wall.
Copulation deposits several hundred million sperm in the vagina. They swim through the
cervix and uterus to the fallopian tubes moved along by whip-like movements of their tails
and contractions of the uterus. During this journey the sperm undergo their ﬁnal phase of
maturation so they are ready to fertilise the ovum by the time they reach it in the upper
fallopian tube.

178

Pregnancy
High mortality means only a small proportion of those deposited actually reach the ovum.
The sperm attach to the outer zona pellucida and enzymes secreted from a gland in the
head of the sperm dissolve this membrane so it can enter. Once one sperm has entered,
changes in the zona pellucida prevent further sperm from penetrating. The sperm loses
its tail and the two nuclei fuse to form a zygote with the full set of paired chromosomes
restored.

13.7.2 Development Of The Morula And Blastocyst
As the fertilised egg travels down the fallopian tube it starts to divide by mitosis. First
two cells are formed and then four, eight, sixteen, etc. until there is a solid ball of cells.
This is called a morula . As division continues a hollow ball of cells develops. This is a
blastocyst (see diagram 13.11).

13.7.3 Implantation
Implantation involves the blastocyst attaching to, and in some species, completely sinking
into the wall of the uterus.

13.8 Pregnancy
13.8.1 The Placenta And Foetal Membranes
As the embryo increases in size, the placenta , umbilical cord and foetal membranes
(often known collectively as the placenta ) develop to provide it with nutrients and remove
waste products (see diagram 13.12). In later stages of development the embryo becomes
known as a foetus .
The placenta is the organ that attaches the foetus to the wall of the uterus. In it the blood
of the foetus and mother ﬂow close to each other but never mix (see diagram 13.13). The
closeness of the maternal and foetal blood systems allows diﬀusion between them. Oxygen
and nutrients diﬀuse from the mother’s blood into that of the foetus and carbon dioxide
and excretory products diﬀuse in the other direction. Most maternal hormones (except
adrenaline), antibodies, almost all drugs (including alcohol), lead and DDT also pass across
the placenta. However, it protects the foetus from infection with bacteria and most viruses.

Diagram 13.12. The foetus and placenta
The foetus is attached to the placenta by the umbilical cord . It contains arteries that
carry blood to the placenta and a vein that returns blood to the foetus. The developing
foetus becomes surrounded by membranes. These enclose the amniotic ﬂuid that protects
the foetus from knocks and other trauma (see diagram 13.12).

180

Pregnancy

Figure 137

Diagram 13.13 - Maternal and foetal blood ﬂow in the placenta

13.8.2 Hormones During Pregnancy
The corpus luteum continues to secrete progesterone and oestrogen during pregnancy. These
maintain the lining of the uterus and prepare the mammary glands for milk secretion. Later
in the pregnancy the placenta itself takes over the secretion of these hormones.
Chorionic gonadotrophin is another hormone secreted by the placenta and placental
membranes. It prevents uterine contractions before labour and prepares the mammary
glands for lactation. Towards the end of pregnancy the placenta and ovaries secrete relaxin
, a hormone that eases the joint between the two parts of the pelvis and helps dilate the
cervix ready for birth.

13.8.3 Pregnancy Testing
The easiest method of pregnancy detection is ultrasound which is noninvasive and very
reliable Later in gestation pregnancy can be detected by taking x-rays.
In dogs and cats a blood test can be used to detect the hormone relaxin .
In mares and cows palpation of the uterus via the rectum is the classic way to determine
pregnancy. It can also be done by detecting the hormones progesterone or equine chorionic gonagotrophin (eCG ) in the urine. A new sensitive test measures the amount of
the hormone, oestrone sulphate , present in a sample of faeces. The hormone is produced
by the foal and placenta, and is only present when there is a living foal.
In most animals, once pregnancy is advanced, there is a window of time during which an
experienced veterinarian can determine pregnancy by feeling the abdomen.

181

Reproductive System

13.8.4 Gestation Period
The young of many animals (e.g. pigs, horses and elephants) are born at an advanced state
of development, able to stand and even run to escape predators soon after they are born.
These animals have a relatively long gestation period that varies with their size e.g. from
114 days in the pig to 640 days in the elephant.
In contrast, cats, dogs, mice, rabbits and higher primates are relatively immature when
born and totally dependent on their parents for survival. Their gestation period is shorter
and varies from 25 days in the mouse to 31 days in rabbits and 258 days in the gorilla.
The babies of marsupials are born at an extremely immature stage and migrate to the pouch
where they attach to a teat to complete their development. Kangaroo joeys, for example,
are born 33 days after conception and opossums after only 8 days.

13.9 Birth
13.9.1 Signs Of Imminent Birth
As the pregnancy continues, the mammary glands enlarge and may secrete a milky substance
a few days before birth occurs. The vulva may swell and produce thick mucus and there is
sometimes a visible change in the position of the foetus. Just before birth the mother often
becomes restless, lying down and getting up frequently. Many animals seek a secluded place
where they may build a nest in which to give birth.

13.9.2 Labour
Labour involves waves of uterine contractions that press the foetus against the cervix causing
it to dilate. The foetus is then pushed through the cervix and along the vagina before being
delivered. In the ﬁnal stage of labour the placenta or “afterbirth” is expelled.

13.9.3 Adaptations Of The Foetus To Life Outside The Uterus
The foetus grows in the watery, protected environment of the uterus where the mother supplies oxygen and nutrients, and waste products pass to her blood circulation for excretion.
Once the baby animal is born it must start to breathe for itself, digest food and excrete
its own waste. To allow these functions to occur blood is re-routed to the lungs and the
glands associated with the gut start to secrete. Note that newborn animals can not control
their own body temperature. They need to be kept warm by the mother, littermates and
insulating nest materials.

13.10 Milk Production
Cows, manatees and primates have two mammary glands but animals like pigs that give
birth to large litters may have as many as 12 pairs. Ducts from the gland lead to a nipple

182

Reproduction In Birds
or teat and there may be a sinus where the milk collects before being suckled (see diagram
13.14).

Figure 138

Diagram 13.14 - A mammary gland
The hormones oestrogen and progesterone stimulate the mammary glands to develop
and prolactin promotes the secretion of the milk. Oxytocin from the pituitary gland
releases the milk when the baby suckles. The ﬁrst milk is called colostrum . It is a rich
in nutrients and contains protective antibodies from the mother. Milk contains fat, protein
and milk sugar as well as vitamins and most minerals although it contains little iron. Its
actual composition varies widely from species to species. For example whale’s and seal’s
milk has twelve times more fat and four times more protein than cow’s milk. Cow’s milk
has far less protein in it than cat’s or dog’s milk. This is why orphan kittens and puppies
cannot be fed cow’s milk.

13.11 Reproduction In Birds
Male birds have testes and sperm ducts and male swans, ducks, geese and ostriches have
a penis. However, most birds make do with a small amount of erectile tissue known as a
papilla . To reduce weight for ﬂight most female birds only have one ovary - usually the
left, which produces extremely yolky eggs. The eggs are fertilised in the upper part of the
oviduct (equivalent to the fallopian tube and uterus of mammals) and as they pass down
it albumin (the white of the egg), the membrane beneath the shell and the shell are laid
down over the yolk. Finally the egg is covered in a layer of mucus to help the bird lay it
(see diagram 13.15).

183

Reproductive System
Most birds lay their eggs in a nest and the hen sits on them until they hatch. Ducklings
and chicks are relatively well developed when they hatch and able to forage for their own
food. Most other nestlings need their parents to keep them warm, clean and fed. Young
birds grow rapidly and have voracious appetites that may involve the parents making up to
1000 trips a day to supply their need for food.

13.12 Summary
• Haploid gametes (sperm and ova) are produced by meiosis in the gonads (testes and
ovaries).
• Fertilisation involves the fusing of the gametes to form a diploid zygote .
• The male reproductive system consists of a pair of testes that produce sperm (or spermatozoa ), ducts that transport the sperm to the penis and glands that add secretions
to the sperm to make semen.

184

Worksheet
• Sperm are produced in the seminiferous tubules , are stored in the epididymis and
travel via the vas deferens or sperm duct to the junction of the bladder and the
urethra where various accessory glands add secretions. The ﬂuid is now called semen
and is ejaculated into the female system down the urethra that runs down the centre of
the penis.
• Sperm consist of a head, a midpiece and a tail.
• Infertility is the inability of sperm to fertilize an egg while impotence is the inability
to copulate successfully.
• The female reproductive system consists of a pair of ovaries that produce ova and
fallopian tubes where fertilisation occurs and which carry the fertilised ovum to the
uterus . Growth of the foetus takes place here. The cervix separates the uterus from
the vagina , the birth canal and where the sperm are deposited.
• The ovarian cycle refers to the series of changes in the ovary during which the follicle
matures, the ovum is shed and the corpus luteum develops.
• The oestrous cycle is the sequence of hormonal changes that occurs through the ovarian cycle. It is initiated by the secretion of follicle stimulating hormone (F.S.H.),
by the anterior pituitary gland which stimulates the follicle to develop. The follicle
secretes oestrogen which stimulates mammary gland development. luteinising hormone (L.H.) from the anterior pituitary initiates ovulation and stimulates the corpus
luteum to develop. The corpus luteum produces progesterone that prepares the lining
of the uterus for the fertilised ovum.
• Signs of oestrous or heat diﬀer. A bitch has a blood stained discharge, female cats and
rats are restless and show the lordosis response, while cows mount other cows, bellow and
have a discharge from the vulva.
• After fertilisation in the fallopian tube the zygote divides over and over by mitosis to
become a ball of cells called a morula . Division continues to form a hollow ball of cells
called the blastocyst . This is the stage that implants in the uterus.
• The placenta, umbilical cord and foetal membranes (known as the placenta )
protect and provide the developing foetus with nutrients and remove waste products.

14.1 Objectives
After completing this section, you should know:

•
•
•
•
•

the role of the nervous system in coordinating an animal’s response to the environment
that the nervous system gathers, sorts and stores information and initiates movement
the basic structure and function of a neuron
the structure and function of a synapse and neurotransmitter chemicals
the nervous pathway known as a reﬂex with examples
that training can develop conditioned reﬂexes in animals
that the nervous system can be divided into the central and peripheral nervous systems
that the brain is surrounded by membranes called meninges
the basic parts of the brain and the function of the cerebral hemispheres, hypothalamus,
pituitary, cerebellum and medulla oblongata
• the structure and function of the spinal cord
• that the peripheral nervous system consists of cranial and spinal nerves and the autonomic
nervous system
• that the autonomic nervous system consists of sympathetic and parasympathetic parts
with diﬀerent functions

14.2 Coordination
Animals must be able to sense and respond to the environment in which they live if they
are to survive. They need to be able to sense the temperature of their surroundings, for
example, so they can avoid the hot sun. They must also be able to identify food and escape
predators.
The various systems and organs in the body must also be linked so they work together.
For example, once a predator has identiﬁed suitable prey it has to catch it. This involves
coordinating the contraction of the muscle so the predator can run, there must then be an
increased blood supply to the muscles to provide them with oxygen and nutrients. At the
same time the respiration rate must increase to supply the oxygen and remove the carbon
dioxide produced as a result of this increased activity. Once the prey has been caught and
eaten, the digestive system must be activated to digest it.
The adjustment of an animal’s response to changes in the environment and the complex linking of the various processes in the body that this response involves are called co-ordination
. Two systems are involved in co-ordination in animals. These are the nervous and endocrine systems . The ﬁrst operates via electrical impulses along nerve ﬁbres and the
second by releasing special chemicals or hormones into the bloodstream from glands.

14.3 Functions of the Nervous System
The nervous system has three basic functions:
1. Sensory function - to sense changes (known as stimuli) both outside and within the
body. For example the eyes sense changes in light and the ear responds to sound waves.

190

The Neuron
Inside the body, stretch receptors in the stomach indicate when it is full and chemical
receptors in the blood vessels monitor the acidity of the blood.
2. Integrative function - processing the information received from the sense organs.
The impulses from these organs are analysed and stored as memory. The many diﬀerent
impulses from diﬀerent sources are sorted, synchronised and co-ordinated and the appropriate response initiated. The power to integrate, remember and apply experience gives
higher animals much of their superiority.
3. Motor function - The third function is the response to the stimuli that causes muscles
to contract or glands to secrete.
All nervous tissue is made up of nerve cells or neurons. These transmit high-speed signals
called nerve impulses . Nerve impulses can be thought of as being similar to an electric
current.

14.4 The Neuron
Neurons are cells that have been adapted to carry nerve impulses. A typical neuron has a
cell body containing a nucleus, one or more branching ﬁlaments called dendrites which
conduct nerve impulses towards the cell body and one long ﬁbre, an axon , that carries
the impulses away from it. Many axons have a sheath of fatty material called myelin
surrounding them. This speeds up the rate at which the nerve impulses travel along the
nerve (see diagram 14.1).

Figure 141

Diagram 14.1 - A motor neuron
The cell body of neurons is usually located in the brain or spinal cord while the axon extends
the whole distance to the organ that it supplies. The neuron carrying impulses from the

191

Nervous System
spinal cord to the hind leg or tail of a horse, for example, can be several feet long. A nerve
is a bundle of axons.
A sensory neuron is a nerve cell that transmits impulses from a sense receptor such as
those in the eye or ear to the brain or spinal cord. A motor neuron is a nerve cell that
transmits impulses from the brain or spinal cord to a muscle or gland. A relay neuron
connects sensory and motor neurons and is found in the brain or spinal cord (see diagrams
14.1 and 14.2).

Figure 142

Diagram 14.2 - The relationship between sensory, relay and motor neurons

14.4.1 Connections Between Neurons
The connection between adjacent neurons is called a synapse . The two nerve cells do
not actually touch here for there is a microscopic space between them. The electrical
impulse in the neurone before the synapse stimulates the production of chemicals called
neurotransmitters (such as acetylcholine ), which are secreted into the gap.
The neurotransmitter chemicals diﬀuse across the gap and when they contact the membrane
of the next nerve cell they stimulate a new nervous impulse (see diagram 14.3). After the
impulse has passed the chemical is destroyed and the synapse is ready to receive the next
nerve impulse.

192

Reﬂexes

Figure 143

Diagram 14.3 - A nerve and magniﬁcation of a synapse

14.5 Reﬂexes
A reﬂex is a rapid automatic response to a stimulus. When you accidentally touch a hot
object and automatically jerk your hand away, this is a reﬂex action. It happens without
you having to think about it. Animals automatically blink when an object approaches the
eye and cats twist their bodies in the air when falling so they land on their paws. (Please
don’t test this one at home with your pet cat!).
Swallowing, sneezing, and the constriction of the pupil of the eye in bright light are also all
reﬂex actions.
The path taken by the nerve impulses in a reﬂex is called a reﬂex arc . Most reﬂex arcs
involve only three neurons (see diagram 14.4). The stimulus (a pin in the paw) stimulates
the pain receptors of the skin, which initiate an impulse in a sensory neuron. This travels
to the spinal cord where it passes, by means of a synapse, to a connecting neuron called the
relay neuron situated in the spinal cord. The relay neuron in turn makes a synapse with one
or more motor neurons that transmit the impulse to the muscles of the limb causing them to
contract and remove the paw from the sharp object. Reﬂexes do not require involvement of
the brain although you are aware of what is happening and can, in some instances, prevent
them happening. Animals are born with their reﬂexes. You can think of them as being
wired in.

193

Nervous System

Figure 144

Diagram 14.4 - A reﬂex arc

14.5.1 Conditioned Reﬂexes
In most reﬂexes the stimulus and response are related. For example the presence of food
in the mouth causes the salivary glands to release saliva. However, it is possible to train
animals (and humans) to respond to diﬀerent and often quite irrelevant stimuli. This is
called a conditioned reﬂex .
A Russian biologist called Pavlov carried out the classic experiment to demonstrate such
a reﬂex when he conditioned dogs to salivate at the sound of a bell ringing. Almost every
pet owner can identify reﬂexes they have conditioned in their animals. Perhaps you have
trained your cat to associate food with the opening of the fridge door or accustomed your
dog to the routines you go through before taking them for a walk.

14.6 Parts of the Nervous System
When we describe the nervous system of vertebrates we usually divide it into two parts (see
diagram 14.5).
1. The central nervous system (CNS ) which consists of the brain and spinal cord.
2. The peripheral nervous system (PNS ) which consists of the nerves that connect
to the brain and spinal cord (cranial and spinal nerves) as well as the autonomic (or
involuntary) nervous system.

194

Parts of the Nervous System

Figure 145

Diagram 14.5 - The nervous system of a horse

14.6.1 The Central Nervous System
The central nervous system consists of the brain and spinal cord. It acts as a kind of
‘telephone exchange’ where a vast number of cross connections are made.
When you look at the brain or spinal cord some regions appear creamy white (white
matter ) and others appear grey (grey matter ). White matter consists of masses of
nerve axons and the grey matter consists of the nerve cells. In the brain the grey matter is
on the outside and in the spinal cord it is on the inside (see diagram 14.2).
The Brain
The major part of the brain lies protected within the sturdy “box” of skull called the cranium . Surrounding the fragile brain tissue (and spinal cord) are protective membranes
called the meninges (see diagram 14.6), and a crystal-clear ﬂuid called cerebrospinal
ﬂuid , which protects and nourishes the brain tissue. This ﬂuid also ﬁlls four cavities or
ventricles that lie within the brain.
Brain tissue is extremely active and, even when an animal is resting, it uses up to 20% of
the oxygen taken into the body by the lungs. The carotid artery , a branch oﬀ the dorsal
aorta, supplies it with the oxygen and nutrients it requires. Brain damage occurs if brain
tissue is deprived of oxygen for only 4-8 minutes.

195

Nervous System
The brain consists of three major regions:
1. the fore brain which includes the cerebral hemispheres , hypothalamus and
pituitary gland ;
2. the hind brain or brain stem , contains the medulla oblongata and pons and
3. the cerebellum or “little brain” (see diagram 14.6).

Figure 146

Diagram 14.6 - Longitudinal section through the brain of a dog
Mapping the brain
In humans and some animals the functions of the diﬀerent regions of the cerebral cortex
have been mapped (see diagram 14.7).
Diagram 14.7 - The functions of the regions of the human cerebral cortex

196

Parts of the Nervous System
The Forebrain
The cerebral hemispheres are the masses of brain tissue that sit on the top of the brain.
The surface is folded into ridges and furrows called sulci (singular sulcus). They make
this part of the brain look rather like a very large walnut kernel. The two hemispheres are
separated by a deep groove although they are connected internally by a thick bundle of
nerve ﬁbres. The outer layer of each hemisphere is called the cerebral cortex and this is
where the main functions of the cerebral hemispheres are carried out.
The cerebral cortex is large and convoluted in mammals compared to other vertebrates and
largest of all in humans because this is where the so-called “higher centres” concerned with
memory, learning, reasoning and intelligence are situated.
Nerves from the eyes, ears, nose and skin bring sensory impulses to the cortex where they
are interpreted. Appropriate voluntary movements are initiated here in the light of the
memories of past events.
Diﬀerent regions of the cortex are responsible for particular sensory and motor functions,
e.g. vision, hearing, taste, smell, or moving the fore-limbs, hind-limbs or tail. For example,
when a dog sniﬀs a scent, sensory impulses from the organ of smell in the nose pass via the
olfactory (smelling) nerve to the olfactory centres of the cerebral hemispheres where the
impulses are interpreted and co-ordinated.
In humans and some animals the functions of the diﬀerent regions of the cerebral cortex
have been mapped (see diagram 14.8).

Figure 147

Diagram 14.8 - The functions of the regions of the cerebral cortex
The hypothalamus is situated at the base of the brain and is connected by a “stalk”
to the pituitary gland , the “master” hormone-producing gland (see chapter 16). The
hypothalamus can be thought of as the bridge between the nervous and endocrine (hormone

197

Nervous System
producing) systems. It produces some of the hormones that are released from the pituitary
gland and controls the release of others from it.
It is also an important centre for controlling the internal environment of the animal and
therefore maintaining homeostasis. For example, it helps regulate the movement of food
through the gut and the temperature, blood pressure and concentration of the blood. It is
also responsible for the feeling of being hungry or thirsty and it controls sleep patterns and
sex drive.
The Hindbrain
The medulla oblongata is at the base of the brain and is a continuation of the spinal
cord. It carries all signals between the spinal cord and the brain and contains centres that
control vital body functions like the basic rhythm of breathing, the rate of the heartbeat
and the activities of the gut. The medulla oblongata also co-ordinates swallowing, vomiting,
coughing and sneezing.
The Cerebellum
The cerebellum (little brain) looks rather like a smaller version of the cerebral hemispheres
attached to the back of the brain. It receives impulses from the organ of balance (vestibular
organ) in the inner ear and from stretch receptors in the muscles and tendons. By coordinating these it regulates muscle contraction during walking and running and helps
maintain the posture and balance of the animal. When the cerebellum malfunctions it
causes a tremor and uncoordinated movement.
The Spinal Cord
The spinal cord is a cable of nerve tissue that passes down the channel in the vertebrae
from the hindbrain to the end of the tail. It becomes progressively smaller as paired spinal
nerves pass out of the cord to parts of the body. Protective membranes or meninges cover
the cord and these enclose cerebral spinal ﬂuid (see diagram 14.9).

198

Parts of the Nervous System

Figure 148

Diagram 14.9 - The spinal cord
If you cut across the spinal cord you can see that it consists of white matter on the outside
and grey matter in the shape of an H or butterﬂy on the inside.

14.6.2 The Peripheral Nervous System
The peripheral nervous system consists of nerves that are connected to the brain (cranial nerves ), and nerves that are connected to the spinal cord (spinal nerves ). The
autonomic nervous systemis also part of the peripheral nervous system.
Cranial Nerves
There are twelve pairs of cranial nerves that come from the brain. Each passes through
a hole in the cranium (brain case). The most important of these are the olfactory, optic,
acoustic and vagus nerves.
The olfactory nerves - (smell) carry impulses from the olfactory organ of the nose to the
brain.
The optic nerves - (sight) carry impulses from the retina of the eye to the brain.
The auditory (acoustic) nerves - (hearing) carry impulses from the cochlear of the inner
ear to the brain.
The vagus nerve - controls the muscles that bring about swallowing. It also controls the
muscles of the heart, airways, lungs, stomach and intestines (see diagram 14.5).

199

Nervous System
Spinal Nerves
Spinal nerves connect the spinal cord to sense organs, muscles and glands in the body.
Pairs of spinal nerves leave the spinal cord and emerge between each pair of adjacent vertebrae (see diagram 14.9).
The sciatic nerve is the largest spinal nerve in the body (see diagram 14.5). It leaves the
spinal cord as several nerves that join to form a ﬂat band of nervous tissue. It passes down
the thigh towards the hind leg where it gives oﬀ branches to the various muscles of this
limb.
The Autonomic Nervous System
The autonomic nervous system controls internal body functions that are not under
conscious control. For example when a prey animal is chased by a predator the autonomic
nervous system automatically increases the rate of breathing and the heartbeat. It dilates
the blood vessels that carry blood to the muscles, releases glucose from the liver, and
makes other adjustments to provide for the sudden increase in activity. When the animal
has escaped and is safe once again the nervous system slows down all these processes and
resumes all the normal body activities like the digestion of food.
The nerves of the autonomic nervous system originate in the spinal cord and pass out between the vertebrae to serve the various organs (see diagram 14.10).There are two main parts
to the autonomic nervous system -- the sympathetic system and the parasympathetic
system .
The sympathetic system stimulates the “ﬂight, fright, ﬁght” response that allows an
animal to face up to an attacker or make a rapid departure. It increases the heart and
respiratory rates, as well as the amount of blood ﬂowing to the skeletal muscles while blood
ﬂow to less critical regions like the gut and skin is reduced. It also causes the pupils of the
eyes to dilate. Note that the eﬀects of the sympathetic system are similar to the eﬀects of
the hormone adrenaline (see Chapter 16).
The parasympathetic system does the opposite to the sympathetic system. It maintains
the normal functions of the relaxed body. These are sometimes known as the “housekeeping” functions. It promotes eﬀective digestion, stimulates defaecation and urination and
maintains a regular heartbeat and rate of breathing.

14.7 Summary
• The neuron is the basic unit of the nervous system. It consists of a cell body with
a nucleus, ﬁlaments known as dendrites and a long ﬁbre known as the axon often
surrounded by a myelin sheath .
• A nerve is a bundle of axons.

201

Nervous System
• Grey matter in the brain and spinal cord consists mainly of brain cells while white
matte r consists of masses of axons.
• Nerve Impulses travel along axons.
• Adjacent neurons connect with each other at synapses .
• Reﬂexes are automatic responses to stimuli. The path taken by nerve impulses involved
in reﬂexes is a reﬂex arc . Most reﬂex arcs involve 3 neurons - a sensory neuron , a
relay neuron and a motor neuron . A stimulus, a pin in the paw for example, initiates
an impulse in the sensory neuron that passes via a synapse to the relay neuron situated
in the spinal cord and then via another synapse to the motor neurone. This transmits
the impulse to the muscle causing it to contract and remove the paw from the pin.
• The nervous system is divided into 2 parts: the central nervous system , consisting
of the brain and spinal cord and the peripheral nervous system consisting of nerves
connected to the brain and spinal cord. The autonomic nervous system is considered
to be part of the peripheral nervous system.
• The brain consists of three major regions: 1. the fore brain which includes the cerebral hemispheres (or cerebrum ), hypothalamus and pituitary gland ; 2. the
hindbrain or brain stem containing the medulla oblongata and 3. the cerebellum
.
• Protective membranes known as the meninges surround the brain and spinal cord.
• There are 12 pairs of cranial nerves that include the optic, olfactory, acoustic and vagus
nerves.
• The spinal cord is a cable of nerve tissue surrounded by meninges passing from the brain
to the end of the tail. Spinal nerves emerge by a ventral and dorsal root between
each vertebra and connect the spinal cord with organs and muscles.
• The autonomic nervous system controls internal body functions not under conscious
control. It is divided into 2 parts with 2 diﬀerent functions: the sympathetic nervous
system that is involved in the ﬂight and ﬁght response including increased heart rate,
bronchial dilation, dilation of the pupil and decreased gut activity. The parasympathetic nervous system is associated with decreased heart rate, pupil constriction and
increased gut activity.

The Senses

15.1 Objectives
After completing this section, you should know:
• that the general senses of touch, pressure, pain etc. are situated in the dermis of the skin
and in the body
• that the special senses include those of smell, taste, sight, hearing, and balance
• the main structures of the eye and their functions
• the route taken by light through the eye to the retina
• the role of the rods and cones in the retina
• the advantages of binocular vision
• the main structures of the ear and their functions
• the route taken by sound waves through the ear to the cochlea
• the role of the vestibular organ (semicircular canals and otolith organ) in maintaining
balance and posture

15.2 The Sense Organs
Sense organs allow animals to sense changes in the environment around them and in their
bodies so that they can respond appropriately. They enable animals to avoid hostile environments, sense the presence of predators and ﬁnd food.
Animals can sense a wide range of stimuli that includes, touch, pressure, pain, temperature,
chemicals, light, sound, movement and position of the body. Some animals can sense electric
and magnetic ﬁelds. All sense organs respond to stimuli by producing nerve impulses that
travel to the brain via a sensory nerve. The impulses are then processed and interpreted in
the brain as pain, sight, sound, taste etc.
The senses are often divided into two groups:
1. The general senses of touch, pressure, pain and temperature that are distributed
fairly evenly through the skin. Some are found in muscles and within joints.
2. The special senses which include the senses of smell, taste, sight, hearing and balance.
The special sense organs may be quite complex in structure.

15.3 Touch And Pressure
Within the dermis of the skin are numerous modiﬁed nerve endings that are sensitive to
touch and pressure. The roots of hairs may also be well supplied with sensory receptors
that inform the animal that it is in contact with an object (see diagram 15.1). Whiskers
are specially modiﬁed hairs.

206

Pain

15.4 Pain
Receptors that sense pain are found in almost every tissue of the body. They tell the animal
that tissues are dangerously hot, cold, compressed or stretched or that there is not enough
blood ﬂowing in them. The animal may then be able to respond and protect itself from
further damage

Figure 153

Diagram 15.1 - The general senses in the skin

15.5 Temperature
Nerve endings in the skin respond to hot and cold stimuli (See diagram 15.1).

15.6 Awareness Of Limb Position
There are sense organs in the muscles, tendons and joints that send continuous impulses to
the brain that tell it where each limb is. This information allows the animal to place its
limbs accurately and know their exact position without having to watch them.

15.7 Smell
Animals use the sense of smell to locate food, mark territory, identify their own oﬀspring
and the presence and sexual condition of a potential mate. The organ of smell (olfactory
organ ) is located in the nose and responds to chemicals in the air. It consists of modiﬁed
nerve cells that have several tiny hairs on the surface. These emerge from the epithelium on

207

The Senses
the roof of the nose cavity into the mucus that lines it. As the animal breathes, chemicals
in the air dissolve in the mucus. When the sense cell responds to a particular molecule, it
ﬁres an impulse that travels along the olfactory nerve to the brain where it is interpreted
as an odour (see diagram 15.2).

Figure 154

Diagram 15.2 - The olfactory organ - the sense of smell
The olfactory sense in humans is rudimentary compared to that of many animals. Carnivores
that hunt have a very highly developed sensitivity to scents. For example a polar bear can
smell out a dead seal 20 km away and a bloodhound can distinguish between the trails
of diﬀerent people although it may sometimes be confused by the criss-crossing trail of
identical twins.
Snakes and lizards detect odours by means of Jacobson’s organ . This is situated on the
roof of the mouth and consists of pits containing sensory cells. When snakes ﬂick out their
forked tongues they are smelling the air by carrying the molecules in it to the Jacobson’s
organ.

15.8 Taste
The sense of taste allows animals to detect and identify dissolved chemicals. In reptiles,
birds, and mammals the taste receptors (taste buds ) are found mainly to the upper
surface of the tongue. They consist of pits containing sensory cells arranged rather like the
segments of an orange (see diagram 15.3). Each receptor cell has a tiny “hair” that projects
into the saliva to sense the chemicals dissolved in it.

208

Sight

Figure 155

Diagram 15.3. Taste buds on the tongue
The sense of taste is quite restricted. Humans can only distinguish four diﬀerent tastes
(sweet, sour, bitter and salt) and what we normally think of as taste is mainly the sense of
smell. Food is quite tasteless when the nose is blocked and cats often refuse to eat when
this happens.

15.9 Sight
The eyes are the organs of sight. They consist of spherical eyeballs situated in deep
depressions in the skull called the orbits . They are attached to the wall of the orbit by
six muscles, which move the eyeball. Upper and lower eyelids cover the eyes during sleep
and protect them from foreign objects or too much light, and spread the tears over their
surface.
The nictitating membrane or haw is a transparent sheet that moves sideways across the
eye from the inner corner, cleansing and moistening the cornea without shutting out the
light. It is found in birds, crocodiles, frogs and ﬁsh as well as marsupials like the kangaroo.
It is rare in mammals but can be seen in cats and dogs by gently opening the eye when it
is asleep. Eyelashes also protect the eyes from the sun and foreign objects.

15.9.1 Structure of the Eye
Lining the eyelids and covering the front of the eyeball is a thin epithelium called the
conjunctiva . Conjunctivitis is inﬂammation of this membrane. Tear glands that open
just under the top eyelid secrete a salty solution that keeps the exposed part of the eye
moist, washes away dust and contains an enzyme that destroys bacteria.

209

The Senses
The wall of the eyeball is composed of three layers (see diagram 15.4). From the outside
these are the sclera , the choroid and the retina .

Figure 156

Diagram 15.4 - The structure of the eye
The sclera is a tough ﬁbrous layer that protects the eyeball and gives it rigidity. At the
front of the eye the sclera is visible as the “white ” of the eye, which is modiﬁed as the
transparent cornea through which the light rays have to pass to enter the eye. The cornea
helps focus light that enters the eye.
The choroid lies beneath the sclera. It contains a network of blood vessels that supply
the eye with oxygen and nutrients. Its inner surface is highly pigmented and absorbs stray
light rays. In nocturnal animals like the cat and possum this highly pigmented layer reﬂects
light as a means of conserving light. This is what makes them shine when caught in car
headlights.
At the front of the eye the choroid becomes the iris . This is the coloured part of the eye
that controls the amount of light entering the pupil of the eye. In dim light the pupil is
wide open so as much light as possible enters while in bright light the pupils contract to
protect the retina from damage by excess light.
The pupil in most animals is circular but in many nocturnal animals it is a slit that can
close completely. This helps protect the extra-sensitive light sensing tissues of animals like
the cat and possum from bright sunlight.
The inner layer lining the inside of the eye is the retina . This contains the light sensing
cells called rods and cones (see diagram 15.5).
The rod cells are long and fat and are sensitive to dim light but cannot detect colour. They
contain large amounts of a pigment that changes when exposed to light. This pigment comes

210

Sight
from vitamin A found in carrots etc. A deﬁciency of this vitamin causes night blindness.
So your mother was right when she told you to eat your carrots as they would help you see
in the dark!
The cone cells provide colour vision and allow animals to see details. Most are found in
the centre of the retina and they are most densely concentrated in a small area called the
fovea . This is the area of sharpest vision, where the words you are reading at this moment
are focussed on your retina.

Figure 157

Diagram 15.5 - A rod and cone from the retina

211

The Senses
The nerve ﬁbres from the cells of the retina join and leave the eye via the optic nerve .
There are no rods or cones here and it is a blind spot . The optic nerve passes through
the back of the orbit and enters the brain.
The lens is situated just behind the pupil and the iris. It is a crystalline structure with
no blood vessels and is held in position by a ligament. This is attached to a muscle, which
changes the shape of the lens so both near and distant objects can be focussed by the eye.
This ability to change the focus of the lens is called accommodation . In many mammals
the muscles that bring about accommodation are poorly developed, Rats, cows and dogs,
for example, are thought to be unable to focus clearly on near objects.
In old age and certain diseases the lens may become cloudy resulting in blurred vision. This
is called a cataract . Within the eyeball are two cavities, the anterior and posterior
chambers , separated by the lens. They contain ﬂuids the aqueous and vitreous humours respectively, that maintain the shape of the eyeball and help press the retina ﬁrmly
against the choroid so clear images are seen.

15.9.2 How The Eye Sees
Eyes work quite like a camera. Light rays from an object enter the eye and are focused on
the retina (the “ﬁlm”) at the back of the eye. The cornea, the lens and the ﬂuid within the
eye all help to focus the light. They do this by bending the light rays so that light from the
object falls on the retina. This bending of light is called refraction . The light stimulates
the light sensitive cells of the retina and nerve impulses are produced that pass down the
optic nerve to the brain (see diagram 15.6).

Figure 158

Diagram 15.6 - How the light travels from the object to the retina of the eye

212

Sight

15.9.3 Colour Vision In Animals
As mentioned before, the retina has two diﬀerent kinds of cells that are stimulated by light
- rods and cones . In humans and higher primates like baboons and gorillas the rods
function in dim light and do not perceive colour, while the cones are stimulated by bright
light and perceive details and colour.
Other mammals have very few cones in their retinas and it is believed that they see no or
only a limited range of colour. It is, of course, diﬃcult to ﬁnd out exactly what animals
do see. It is thought that deer, rats, and rabbits and nocturnal animals like the cat are
colour-blind, and dogs probably see green and blue. Some ﬁsh and most birds seem to have
better colour vision than humans and they use colour, often very vivid ones, for recognizing
each other as well as for courtship and protection.

15.9.4 Binocular Vision
Animals like cats that hunt have eyes placed on the front of the head in such a way that
both eyes see the same wide area but from slightly diﬀerent angles (see diagram 15.7). This
is called binocular vision. Its main advantage is that it enables the animals to
estimate the distance to the prey so they can chase it and pounce accurately.

Figure 159

Diagram 15.7 - Well developed binocular vision in predator animals like the cat
In contrast plant-eating prey animals like the rabbit and deer need to have a wide panoramic
view so they can see predators approaching. They therefore have eyes placed on the side of
the head, each with its own ﬁeld of vision (see diagram 15.8). They have only a very small
area of binocular vision in front of the head but are extremely sensitive to movement.

213

The Senses

Figure 160

Diagram 15.8 - Panoramic monocular vision in prey animals like the rabbit

15.10 Hearing
Animals use the sense of hearing for many diﬀerent purposes. It is used to sense danger
and enemies, to detect prey, to identify prospective mates and to communicate within social
groups. Some animals (e.g. most bats and dolphins) use sound to “see” by echolocation. By
sending out a cry and interpreting the echo, they sense obstacles or potential prey.

15.10.1 Structure of the Ear
Most of the ear, the organ of hearing, is hidden from view within the boney skull. It consists
of three main regions: the outer ear, the middle ear and the inner ear (see diagram
15.9).

214

Hearing

Figure 161

Diagram 15.9 - The ear
The outer ear consists of an ear canal leading inwards to a thin membrane known as
the eardrum or tympanic membrane that stretches across the canal. Many animals
have an external ear ﬂap or pinna to collect and funnel the sound into the ear canal. The
pinnae (plural of pinna) usually face forwards on the head but many animals can swivel
them towards the source of the sound.
In dogs the ear canal is long and bent and often traps wax or provides an ideal habitat for
mites, yeast and bacteria.
The middle ear consists of a cavity in the skull that is connected to the pharynx (throat)
by a long narrow tube called the Eustachian tube . This links the middle ear to the
outside air so that the air pressure on both sides of the eardrum can be kept the same.
Everyone knows the uncomfortable feeling (and aﬀected hearing) that occurs when you
drive down a steep hill and the unequal air pressures on the two sides of the eardrum cause
it to distort. The discomfort is relieved when you swallow because the Eustachian tubes
open and the pressure on either side equalises.
Within the cavity of the middle ear are three of the smallest bones in the body, the auditory
ossicles . They are known as the hammer, the anvil and the stirrup because of their
resemblance to the shape of these objects. These tiny bones articulate (move against) each
other and transfer the vibrations of the eardrum to the membrane covering the opening to
the inner ear.
The inner ear is a complicated series of ﬂuid-ﬁlled tubes imbedded in the bone of the skull.
It consists of two main parts. These are the cochlea where sound waves are converted to
nerve impulses and the vestibular organ that is associated with the sense of balance and
has no role in hearing (see later).

215

The Senses
The cochlea looks rather like a coiled up snail shell. Within it there are specialised cells
with ﬁne hairs on their surface that respond to the movement of the ﬂuid within the cochlea
by producing nervous impulses that travel to the brain along the auditory nerve .

15.10.2 How The Ear Hears
Sound waves can be thought of as vibrations in the air. They are collected by the ear pinna
and pass down the ear canal where they cause the eardrum to vibrate. (An interesting fact
is that when you are listening to someone speaking your eardrum vibrates at exactly the
same rate as the vocal cords of the person speaking to you).
The vibration of the eardrum sets the three tiny bones in the middle ear moving against
each other so that the vibration is transferred to the membrane covering the opening to
the inner ear. As well as transferring the vibration, the tiny ear bones also amplify it. The
three tiny bones are called the stirrup, anvil, and hammer. They were called such of their
form. In the human ear this ampliﬁcation is about 20 times while in desert-dwelling animals
like the kangaroo rat it is 100 times. This acute hearing warns them of the approach of
predators like owls and snakes, even in the dark.
The vibration causes waves in the ﬂuid in the inner ear that pass down the cochlea. These
waves stimulate the tiny hair cells to produce nerve impulses that travel via the auditory
nerve to the cerebral cortex of the brain where they are interpreted as sound.
To summarise: The route sound waves take as they pass through the ear is: External ear
| tympanic membrane | ear ossicles | inner ear |cochlear | hair cells
The hair cells generate a nerve impulse that travels down the auditory nerve to the brain.
Remember that sound waves do not pass along the Eustachian tube. Its function is to
equalise the air pressure on either side of the tympanic membrane.

15.11 Balance
The vestibular organ of the inner ear helps an animal maintain its posture and keep
balanced by monitoring the movement and position of the head. It consists of two structures
- the semicircular canals and the otolith organs .
The semicircular canals (see diagram 15.10) respond to movement of the body. They
tell an animal whether it is moving up or down, left or right. They consist of three canals
set in three diﬀerent planes at right angles to each other so that movement in any direction
can be registered. The canals contain ﬂuid and sense cells with ﬁne hairs that project into
the ﬂuid. When the head moves the ﬂuid swirls in the canals and stimulates the hair cells.
These send nerve impulses along the vestibular nerve to the cerebellum .
Note that the semicircular canals register acceleration and deceleration as well as changes
in direction but do not respond to movement that is at a constant speed.
The otolith organs are sometimes known as gravity receptors. They tell you if your head
is tilted or if you are standing on your head. They consist of bulges at the base of the
semi circular canals that contain hair cells that are covered by a mass of jelly containing

216

Summary
tiny pieces of chalk called otoliths (see diagram 15.10). When the head is tilted, or moved
suddenly, the otoliths pull on the hair cells, which produce a nerve impulse. This travels
down the vestibular nerve to the cerebellum . By coordinating the nerve impulses from
the semicircular canals and otolith organs the cerebellum helps the animal keep its balance.

Figure 162

Diagram 15.10 - Otolith Organs

15.12 Summary
• Receptors for touch, pressure, pain and temperature are found in the skin. Receptors in
the muscles, tendons and joints inform the brain of limb position.
• The olfactory organ in the nose responds to chemicals in the air i.e. smell.
• Taste buds on the tongue respond to a limited range of chemicals dissolved in saliva.
• The eyes are the organs of sight. Spherical eyeballs situated in orbits in the skull have
walls composed of 3 layers.
• The tough outer sclera protects and holds the shape of the eyeball. At the front it
becomes visible as the white of the eye and the transparent cornea that allows light to
enter the eye.
• The middle layer is the choroid . It most animals it absorbs stray light rays but in
nocturnal animal it is reﬂective to conserve light. At the front of the eye it becomes the
iris with muscles to control the size of the pupil and hence the amount of light entering
the eye.
• The inner layer is the retina containing the light receptor cells: the rods for black and
white vision in dim light and the cones for colour and detailed vision. Nerve impulses
generated by these cells leave the eye for the brain via the optic nerve .
• The lens (with the cornea) helps focus the light rays on the retina. Muscles alter the
shape of the lens to allow near and far objects to be focussed.

217

The Senses
• Aqueous humour ﬁlls the space immediately behind the cornea and keeps it in shape
and vitreous humour , a transparent jelly-like substance, ﬁlls the space behind the lens
allowing light rays to pass through to the retina.
• The ear is the organ of hearing and balance.
• The external pinna helps funnel sound waves into the ear and locate the direction of the
sound. The sound waves travel down the external ear canal to the eardrum or tympanic membrane causing it to vibrate. This vibration is transferred to the auditory
ossicles of the middle ear which themselves transfer it to the inner ear. Here receptors
in the cochlea respond by generating nerve impulses that travel to the brain via the
auditory (acoustic) nerve.
• The Eustachian tube connects the middle ear with the pharynx to equalise air pressure
on either side of the tympanic membrane.
• The vestibular organ of the inner ear is concerned with maintaining balance and posture. It consists of the semicircular canals and the otolith organs .

Endocrine System

16.1 Objectives
After completing this section, you should know:
•
•
•
•

The characteristics of endocrine glands and hormones
The position of the main endocrine glands in the body
The relationship between the pituitary gland and the hypothalamus
The main hormones produced by the two parts of the pituitary gland and their eﬀects on
the body
• The main hormones produced by the pineal, thyroid, parathyroid and adrenal glands, the
pancreas, ovary and testis and their eﬀects on the body
• What is meant by homeostasis and feedback control
• The homeostatic mechanisms that allow an animal to control its body temperature, water
balance, blood volume and acid/base balance

16.2 The Endocrine System
In order to survive, animals must constantly adapt to changes in the environment. The
nervous and endocrine systems both work together to bring about this adaptation. In
general the nervous system responds rapidly to short-term changes by sending electrical
impulses along nerves and the endocrine system brings about longer-term adaptations by
sending out chemical messengers called hormones into the blood stream.
For example, think about what happens when a male and female cat meet under your
bedroom window at night. The initial response of both cats may include spitting, ﬁghting
and spine tingling yowling - all brought about by the nervous system. Fear and stress then
activates the adrenal glands to secrete the hormone adrenaline which increases the heart
and respiratory rates. If mating occurs, other hormones stimulate the release of ova from
the ovary of the female and a range of diﬀerent hormones maintains pregnancy, delivery of
the kittens and lactation.

16.3 Endocrine Glands And Hormones
Hormones are chemicals that are secreted by endocrine glands . Unlike exocrine glands
(see chapter 5), endocrine glands have no ducts, but release their secretions directly into
the blood system, which carries them throughout the body. However, hormones only aﬀect
the speciﬁc target organs that recognize them. For example, although it is carried to
virtually every cell in the body, follicle stimulating hormone (FSH), released from the
anterior pituitary gland , only acts on the follicle cells of the ovaries causing them to
develop.
A nerve impulse travels rapidly and produces an almost instantaneous response but one
that lasts only brieﬂy. In contrast, hormones act more slowly and their eﬀects may be long
lasting. Target cells respond to minute quantities of hormones and the concentration in
the blood is always extremely low. However, target cells are sensitive to subtle changes in

222

The Pituitary Gland And Hypothalamus
hormone concentration and the endocrine system regulates processes by changing the rate
of hormone secretion.
The main endocrine glands in the body are the pituitary, pineal, thyroid, parathyroid
, and adrenal glands , the pancreas, ovaries and testes . Their positions in the body
are shown in diagram 16.1.

16.4 The Pituitary Gland And Hypothalamus
The pituitary gland is a pea-sized structure that is attached by a stalk to the underside
of the cerebrum of the brain (see diagram 16.2). It is often called the “master” endocrine
gland because it controls many of the other endocrine glands in the body. However, we
now know that the pituitary gland is itself controlled by the hypothalamus . This small
but vital region of the brain lies just above the pituitary and provides the link between the
nervous and endocrine systems. It controls the autonomic nervous system , produces a
range of hormones and regulates the secretion of many others from the pituitary gland (see
Chapter 7 for more information on the hypothalamus).
The pituitary gland is divided into two parts with diﬀerent functions - the anterior and
posterior pituitary (see diagram 16.3).

Diagram 16.3 - The anterior and posterior pituitary
The anterior pituitary gland secretes hormones that regulate a wide range of activities
in the body. These include:
1. Growth hormone that stimulates body growth.
2. Prolactin that initiates milk production.
3. Follicle stimulating hormone (FSH ) that stimulates the development of the follicles of the ovaries. These then secrete oestrogen (see chapter 6).
4. melanocyte stimulating hormone (MSH ) that causes darkening of skin by producing melanin
5. lutenizing hormone (LH ) that stimulates ovulation and production of progesterone
and testosterone

224

The Pineal Gland

16.5 The Pineal Gland
The pineal gland is found deep within the brain (see diagram 16.4). It is sometimes known
as the ‘third eye” as it responds to light and day length. It produces the hormone melatonin
, which inﬂuences the development of sexual maturity and the seasonality of breeding and
hibernation. bright light inhibits melatonin secretion low level of melatonin in bright
light makes one feel good and these increases fertility High level of melatonin in deam light
makes an animal tired and depressed therefore low fertility in animals

Figure 168

Diagram 16.4 - The pineal gland

16.6 The Thyroid Gland
The thyroid gland is situated in the neck, just in front of the windpipe or trachea (see
diagram 16.5). It produces the hormone thyroxine , which inﬂuences the rate of growth
and development of young animals. In mature animals it increases the rate of chemical
reactions in the body.
Thyroxine consists of 60% iodine and too little in the diet can cause goitre , an enlargement
of the thyroid gland. Many inland soils in New Zealand contain almost no iodine so goitre
can be common in stock when iodine supplements are not given. To add to the problem,
chemicals called goitrogens that occur naturally in plants like kale that belong to the
cabbage family , can also cause goitre even when there is adequate iodine available.

Diagram 16.5 - The thyroid and parathyroid glands

16.7 The Parathyroid Glands
The parathyroid glands are also found in the neck just behind the thyroid glands (see
diagram 16.5). They produce the hormone parathormone that regulates the amount of
calcium in the blood and inﬂuences the excretion of phosphates in the urine.

16.8 The Adrenal Gland
The adrenal glands are situated on the cranial surface of the kidneys (see diagram 16.6).
There are two parts to this endocrine gland, an outer cortex and an inner medulla .

226

The Pancreas

Figure 170

Diagram 16.6 - The adrenal glands
The adrenal cortex produces several hormones. These include:
1. Aldosterone that regulates the concentration of sodium and potassium in the blood
by controlling the amounts that are secreted or reabsorbed in the kidney tubules.
2. Cortisone and hydrocortisone (cortisol) that have complex eﬀects on glucose, protein
and fat metabolism. In general they increase metabolism. They are also often administered
to animals to counteract allergies and for treating arthritic and rheumatic conditions.
However, prolonged use should be avoided if possible as they can increase weight and
reduce the ability to heal.
3. Male and female sex hormones similar to those secreted by the ovaries and testes.
The hormones secreted by the adrenal cortex also play a part in “general adaptation
syndrome ” which occurs in situations of prolonged stress.
The adrenal medulla secretes adrenalin (also called epinephrine ). Adrenalin is responsible for the so-called ﬂight ﬁght, fright response that prepares the animal for emergencies.
Faced with a perilous situation the animal needs to either ﬁght or make a rapid escape. To
do either requires instant energy, particularly in the skeletal muscles. Adrenaline increases
the amount of blood reaching them by causing their blood vessels to dilate and the heart
to beat faster. An increased rate of breathing increases the amount of oxygen in the blood
and glucose is released from the liver to provide the fuel for energy production. Sweating
increases to keep the muscles cool and the pupils of the eye dilate so the animal has a
wide ﬁeld of view. Functions like digestion and urine production that are not critical to
immediate survival slow down as blood vessels to these parts constrict.
Note that the eﬀects of adrenalin are similar to those of the sympathetic nervous system.

16.9 The Pancreas
In most animals the pancreas is an oblong, pinkish organ that lies in the ﬁrst bend of
the small intestine (see diagram 16.7). In rodents and rabbits, however, it is spread thinly
through the mesentery and is sometimes diﬃcult to see.

227

Endocrine System

Figure 171

Diagram 16.7 - The pancreas
Most of the pancreas acts as an exocrine gland producing digestive enzymes that are
secreted into the small intestine. The endocrine part of the organ consists of small clusters
of cells (called Islets of Langerhans ) that secrete the hormone insulin . This hormone
regulates the amount of glucose in the blood by increasing the rate at which glucose is
converted to glycogen in the liver and the movement of glucose from the blood into cells.
In diabetes mellitus the pancreas produces insuﬃcient insulin and glucose levels in the
blood can increase to a dangerous level. A major symptom of this condition is glucose in
the urine.

16.10 The Ovaries
The ovaries, located in the lower abdomen, produce two important sex hormones.
1. The follicle cells , under the inﬂuence of FSH (see the pituitary gland above), produce oestrogen , which stimulates the development of female sexual characteristics - the
mammary glands, generally smaller build of female animals etc. It also stimulates the
thickening of the lining of the uterus in preparation for pregnancy (see chapter 13).
2. Progesterone is produced by the corpus luteum , the endocrine gland that develops
in the empty follicle following ovulation (see chapter 13). It promotes the further preparation of the uterine lining for pregnancy and prevents the uterus contracting until the baby
is born.

228

The Testes

16.11 The Testes
Cells around the sperm producing ducts of the testis produce the hormone testosterone
. This stimulates the development of the male reproductive system and the male sexual
characteristics - generally larger body of male animals, mane in lions, tusks in boars, etc

16.12 Summary
• Hormones are chemicals that are released into the blood by endocrine glands i.e.
Glands with no ducts. Hormones act on speciﬁc target organs that recognize them.
• The main endocrine glands in the body are the hypothalamus, pituitary, pineal,
thyroid, parathyroid and adrenal glands, the pancreas, ovaries and testes .
• The hypothalamus is situated under the cerebrum of the brain. It produces or controls
many of the hormones released by the pituitary gland lying adjacent to it.
• The pituitary gland is divided into two parts: the anterior pituitary and the posterior pituitary .
• The anterior pituitary produces:
•
•
•
•
•

Growth hormone that stimulates body growth
Prolactin that initiates milk production
Follicle stimulating hormone (FSH ) that stimulates the development of ova
Luteinising hormone (LH ) that stimulates the development of the corpus luteum
Plus several other hormones

• The posterior pituitary releases:
• Antidiuretic hormone (ADH) that regulates water loss and raises blood pressure
• Oxytocin that stimulates milk “let down”.
• The pineal gland in the brain produces melatonin that inﬂuences sexual development and breeding cycles .
• The thyroid gland located in the neck, produces thyroxine, which inﬂuences the rate
of growth and development of young animals. Thyroxine consists of 60% iodine .
Lack of iodine leads to goitre .
• The parathyroid glands situated adjacent to the thyroid glands in the neck produce
parathormone that regulates blood calcium levels and the excretion of phosphates .
• The adrenal gland located adjacent to the kidneys is divided into the outer cortex and
the inner medulla .
• The adrenal cortex produces:
• Aldosterone that regulates the blood concentration of sodium and potassium
• Cortisone and hydrocortisone that aﬀect glucose, protein and fat metabolism
• Male and female sex hormones
• The adrenal medulla produces adrenalin responsible for the ﬂight, fright, ﬁght
response that prepares animals for emergencies.
• The pancreas that lies in the ﬁrst bend of the small intestine producesinsulin that
regulates blood glucose levels.
• The ovaries are located in the lower abdomen produce 2 important sex hormones:

229

Endocrine System
• The follicle cells of the developing ova produce oestrogen , which controls the development of the mammary glands and prepares the uterus for pregnancy.
• The corpus luteum that develops in the empty follicle after ovulation produces progesterone . This hormone further prepares the uterus for pregnancy and maintains
the pregnancy.
• The testes produce testosterone that stimulates the development of the male reproductive system and sexual characteristics .

16.13 Homeostasis and Feedback Control
Animals can only survive if the environment within their bodies and their cells is kept
constant and independent of the changing conditions in the external environment. As
mentioned in module 1.6, the process by which this stability is maintained is called homeostasis. The body achieves this stability by constantly monitoring the internal conditions
and if they deviate from the norm initiating processes that bring them back to it. This
mechanism is called feedback control. For example, to maintain a constant body temperature the hypothalamus monitors the blood temperature and initiates processes that increase
or decrease heat production by the body and loss from the skin so the optimum temperature
is always maintained. The processes involved in the control of body temperature, water
balance, blood loss and acid/base balance are summarized below.

16.14 Summary of Homeostatic Mechanisms
16.14.1 1. Temperature control
The biochemical and physiological processes in the cell are sensitive to temperature. The
optimum body temperature is about 37�C [99�F] for mammals, and about 40�C [104�F]
for birds. Biochemical processes in the cells, particularly in muscles and the liver, produce
heat. The heat is distributed through the body by the blood and is lost mainly through the
skin surface. The production of this heat and its loss through the skin is controlled by the
hypothalamus in the brain which acts rather like a thermostat on an electric heater. .
(a) When the body temperature rises above the optimum, a decrease in temperature is
achieved by:
• Sweating and panting to increase heat loss by evaporation.
• Expansion of the blood vessels near the skin surface so heat is lost to the air.
• Reducing muscle exertion to the minimum.
(b) When the body temperature falls below the optimum, an increase in temperature can
be achieved by:
• Moving to a heat source e.g. in the sun, out of the wind.
• Increasing muscular activity

230

Summary of Homeostatic Mechanisms
• Shivering
• Making the hair stand on end by contraction of the hair erector muscles or ﬂuﬃng of the
feathers so there is an insulating layer of air around the body
• Constricting the blood vessels near the skin surface so heat loss to the air is decreased

16.14.2 2. Water balance
The concentration of the body ﬂuids remains relatively constant irrespective of the diet or
the quantity of water taken into the body by the animal. Water is lost from the body by
many routes (see module 1.6) but the kidney is the main organ that inﬂuences the quantity
that is lost. Again it is the hypothalamus that monitors the concentration of the blood
and initiates the release of hormones from the posterior pituitary gland. These act on the
kidney tubules to inﬂuence the amount of water (and sodium ions) absorbed from the ﬂuid
ﬂowing along them.
(a) When the body ﬂuids become too concentrated and the osmotic pressure too high, water
retention in the kidney tubules can be achieved by:
• An increased production of antidiuretic hormone (ADH) from the posterior pituitary
gland, which causes more water to be reabsorbed from the kidney tubules.
• A decreased blood pressure in the glomerulus of the kidney results in less ﬂuid ﬁltering
through into the kidney tubules so less urine is produced.
(b) When the body ﬂuids become too dilute and the osmotic pressure too low, water loss
in the urine can be achieved by:
• A decrease in the secretion of ADH, so less water is reabsorbed from the kidney tubules
and more diluted urine is produced.
• An increase in the blood pressure in the glomerulus so more ﬂuid ﬁlters into the kidney
tubule and more urine is produced.
• An increase in sweating or panting that also increases the amount of water lost.
Another hormone, aldosterone, secreted by the cortex of the adrenal gland, also aﬀects water
balance indirectly. It does this by increasing the absorption of sodium ions (Na-) from the
kidney tubules. This increases water retention since it increases the osmotic pressure of the
ﬂuids around the tubules and water therefore ﬂows out of them by osmosis.

16.14.3 3. Maintenance of blood volume after moderate blood loss
Loss of blood or body ﬂuids leads to decreased blood volume and hence decreased blood
pressure. The result is that the blood system fails to deliver enough oxygen and nutrients
to the cells, which stop functioning properly and may die. Cells of the brain are particularly
vulnerable. This condition is known as shock.
If blood loss is not extreme, various mechanisms come into play to compensate and ensure
permanent tissue damage does not occur. These mechanisms include:

231

Endocrine System
• Increased thirst and drinking increases blood volume.
• Blood vessels in the skin and kidneys constrict to reduce the total volume of the blood
system and hence retain blood pressure.
• Heart rate increases. This also increases blood pressure.
• Antidiuretic hormone (ADH) is released by the posterior pituitary gland. This increases
water re-absorption in the collecting ducts of the kidney tubules so concentrated urine is
produced and water loss is reduced. This helps maintain blood volume.
• Loss of ﬂuid causes an increase in osmotic pressure of the blood. Proteins, mainly albumin,
released into the blood by the liver further increase the osmotic pressure causing ﬂuid
from the tissues to be drawn into the blood by osmosis. This increases blood volume.
• Aldosterone, secreted by the adrenal cortex, increases the absorption of sodium ions (Na-)
and water from the kidney tubules. This increases urine concentration and helps retain
blood volume.
If blood or ﬂuid loss is extreme and the blood volume falls by more than 15-25%, the
above mechanisms are unable to compensate and the condition of the animal progressively
deteriorates. The animal will die unless a vet administers ﬂuid or blood.

16.14.4 4. Acid/ base balance
Biochemical reactions within the body are very sensitive to even small changes in acidity
or alkalinity (i.e. pH) and any departure from the narrow limits disrupts the functioning of
the cells. It is therefore important that the blood contains balanced quantities of acids and
bases.
The normal pH of blood is in the range 7.35 to 7.45 and there are a number of mechanisms
that operate to maintain the pH in this range. Breathing is one of these mechanisms.
Much of the carbon dioxide produced by respiration in cells is carried in the blood as
carbonic acid. As the amount of carbon dioxide in the blood increases the blood becomes
more acidic and the pH decreases. This is called acidosis and when severe can cause coma
and death. On the other hand, alkalosis (blood that is too alkaline) causes over stimulation
of the nervous system and when severe can lead to convulsions and death.
(a) When vigorous activity generating large quantities of carbon dioxide causes the blood
to becomes too acidic it can be counteracted in two ways:
• By the rapid removal of carbon dioxide from the blood by deep, panting breaths
By the secretion of hydrogen ions (H+) into the urine by the kidney tubules.
(b) When over breathing or hyperventilation results in low levels of carbon dioxide in the
blood and the blood is too alkaline, various mechanisms come into play to bring the pH
back to within the normal range. These include:
• A slower rate of breathing
• A reduction in the amount of hydrogen ions (H+) secreted into the urine.

18 Licenses
18.1 GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
Version 3, 29 June 2007
Copyright © 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <http://fsf.org/>
Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this
license document, but changing it is not allowed. Preamble
The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for software
and other kinds of works.
The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed
to take away your freedom to share and change the works. By contrast, the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your
freedom to share and change all versions of a program–to make sure
it remains free software for all its users. We, the Free Software Foundation, use the GNU General Public License for most of our software;
it applies also to any other work released this way by its authors. You
can apply it to your programs, too.
When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price.
Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have
the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for them
if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you want
it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new free
programs, and that you know you can do these things.
To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you
these rights or asking you to surrender the rights. Therefore, you have
certain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if you
modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.
For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis
or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same freedoms that
you received. You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get
the source code. And you must show them these terms so they know
their rights.
Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps:
(1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) oﬀer you this License
giving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.
For the developers’ and authors’ protection, the GPL clearly explains
that there is no warranty for this free software. For both users’ and
authors’ sake, the GPL requires that modiﬁed versions be marked as
changed, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to
authors of previous versions.
Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run modiﬁed versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer
can do so. This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of protecting users’ freedom to change the software. The systematic pattern of
such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to use, which
is precisely where it is most unacceptable. Therefore, we have designed
this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those products. If
such problems arise substantially in other domains, we stand ready to
extend this provision to those domains in future versions of the GPL,
as needed to protect the freedom of users.
Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents.
States should not allow patents to restrict development and use of software on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to
avoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program could
make it eﬀectively proprietary. To prevent this, the GPL assures that
patents cannot be used to render the program non-free.
The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modiﬁcation follow. TERMS AND CONDITIONS 0. Deﬁnitions.
“This License” refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.
“Copyright” also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds
of works, such as semiconductor masks.
“The Program” refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this License. Each licensee is addressed as “you”. “Licensees” and “recipients”
may be individuals or organizations.
To “modify” a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work
in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of
an exact copy. The resulting work is called a “modiﬁed version” of the
earlier work or a work “based on” the earlier work.
A “covered work” means either the unmodiﬁed Program or a work
based on the Program.
To “propagate” a work means to do anything with it that, without permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for infringement
under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a computer or
modifying a private copy. Propagation includes copying, distribution
(with or without modiﬁcation), making available to the public, and in
some countries other activities as well.
To “convey” a work means any kind of propagation that enables other
parties to make or receive copies. Mere interaction with a user through
a computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.
An interactive user interface displays “Appropriate Legal Notices” to
the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible feature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2) tells the
user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the extent that
warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the work under
this License, and how to view a copy of this License. If the interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a menu, a
prominent item in the list meets this criterion. 1. Source Code.
The “source code” for a work means the preferred form of the work for
making modiﬁcations to it. “Object code” means any non-source form
of a work.
A “Standard Interface” means an interface that either is an oﬃcial
standard deﬁned by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of
interfaces speciﬁed for a particular programming language, one that is
widely used among developers working in that language.
The “System Libraries” of an executable work include anything, other
than the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of
packaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major
Component, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that
Major Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an
implementation is available to the public in source code form. A “Major Component”, in this context, means a major essential component
(kernel, window system, and so on) of the speciﬁc operating system (if
any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to produce
the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.

The “Corresponding Source” for a work in object code form means all
the source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable
work) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts
to control those activities. However, it does not include the work’s
System Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free
programs which are used unmodiﬁed in performing those activities but
which are not part of the work. For example, Corresponding Source
includes interface deﬁnition ﬁles associated with source ﬁles for the
work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically linked
subprograms that the work is speciﬁcally designed to require, such as
by intimate data communication or control ﬂow between those subprograms and other parts of the work.
The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users can regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding Source.
The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that same
work. 2. Basic Permissions.
All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of copyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated conditions are met. This License explicitly aﬃrms your unlimited permission to run the unmodiﬁed Program. The output from running a
covered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its
content, constitutes a covered work. This License acknowledges your
rights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.
You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not convey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains in
force. You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose
of having them make modiﬁcations exclusively for you, or provide you
with facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with
the terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do not
control copyright. Those thus making or running the covered works
for you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction
and control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of
your copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.
Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under
the conditions stated below. Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10
makes it unnecessary. 3. Protecting Users’ Legal Rights From AntiCircumvention Law.
No covered work shall be deemed part of an eﬀective technological
measure under any applicable law fulﬁlling obligations under article
11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or
similar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such measures.
When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid
circumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention is eﬀected by exercising rights under this License with respect
to the covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or modiﬁcation of the work as a means of enforcing, against the
work’s users, your or third parties’ legal rights to forbid circumvention
of technological measures. 4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.
You may convey verbatim copies of the Program’s source code as you
receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice; keep intact all notices stating that this License and any non-permissive terms
added in accord with section 7 apply to the code; keep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all recipients a copy of
this License along with the Program.
You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey, and you may oﬀer support or warranty protection for a fee. 5.
Conveying Modiﬁed Source Versions.
You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modiﬁcations
to produce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the
terms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:
* a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modiﬁed
it, and giving a relevant date. * b) The work must carry prominent
notices stating that it is released under this License and any conditions
added under section 7. This requirement modiﬁes the requirement in
section 4 to “keep intact all notices”. * c) You must license the entire
work, as a whole, under this License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy. This License will therefore apply, along with any
applicable section 7 additional terms, to the whole of the work, and
all its parts, regardless of how they are packaged. This License gives
no permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not
invalidate such permission if you have separately received it. * d) If
the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display Appropriate
Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive interfaces that
do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your work need not make
them do so.
A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent
works, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work,
and which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program,
in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an
“aggregate” if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not used
to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation’s users beyond
what the individual works permit. Inclusion of a covered work in an
aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other parts of
the aggregate. 6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.
You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms of
sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the machine-readable
Corresponding Source under the terms of this License, in one of these
ways:
* a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the Corresponding Source ﬁxed on a durable physical medium customarily used
for software interchange. * b) Convey the object code in, or embodied
in, a physical product (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a written oﬀer, valid for at least three years and valid
for as long as you oﬀer spare parts or customer support for that product model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a
copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the product
that is covered by this License, on a durable physical medium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no more than your
reasonable cost of physically performing this conveying of source, or
(2) access to copy the Corresponding Source from a network server at
no charge. * c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a
copy of the written oﬀer to provide the Corresponding Source. This
alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and only
if you received the object code with such an oﬀer, in accord with subsection 6b. * d) Convey the object code by oﬀering access from a
designated place (gratis or for a charge), and oﬀer equivalent access to
the Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at
no further charge. You need not require recipients to copy the Corresponding Source along with the object code. If the place to copy the
object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source may be on a

diﬀerent server (operated by you or a third party) that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain clear directions next to
the object code saying where to ﬁnd the Corresponding Source. Regardless of what server hosts the Corresponding Source, you remain
obligated to ensure that it is available for as long as needed to satisfy
these requirements. * e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer
transmission, provided you inform other peers where the object code
and Corresponding Source of the work are being oﬀered to the general
public at no charge under subsection 6d.
A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded
from the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be included in conveying the object code work.
A “User Product” is either (1) a “consumer product”, which means any
tangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family,
or household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation into a dwelling. In determining whether a product is a consumer
product, doubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage. For a
particular product received by a particular user, “normally used” refers
to a typical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the
status of the particular user or of the way in which the particular
user actually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product. A
product is a consumer product regardless of whether the product has
substantial commercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such
uses represent the only signiﬁcant mode of use of the product.
“Installation Information” for a User Product means any methods, procedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install
and execute modiﬁed versions of a covered work in that User Product
from a modiﬁed version of its Corresponding Source. The information
must suﬃce to ensure that the continued functioning of the modiﬁed
object code is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because
modiﬁcation has been made.
If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or
speciﬁcally for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as
part of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the
User Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a ﬁxed
term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the Corresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied by
the Installation Information. But this requirement does not apply if
neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install modiﬁed object code on the User Product (for example, the work has been
installed in ROM).
The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include
a requirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates for a work that has been modiﬁed or installed by the recipient,
or for the User Product in which it has been modiﬁed or installed.
Access to a network may be denied when the modiﬁcation itself materially and adversely aﬀects the operation of the network or violates
the rules and protocols for communication across the network.
Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided, in accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly
documented (and with an implementation available to the public in
source code form), and must require no special password or key for
unpacking, reading or copying. 7. Additional Terms.
“Additional permissions” are terms that supplement the terms of this
License by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions. Additional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall be
treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent that
they are valid under applicable law. If additional permissions apply
only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately under
those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by this
License without regard to the additional permissions.
When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option
remove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part
of it. (Additional permissions may be written to require their own
removal in certain cases when you modify the work.) You may place
additional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work,
for which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.
Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you
add to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders
of that material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:
* a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability diﬀerently from the
terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or * b) Requiring preservation of speciﬁed reasonable legal notices or author attributions in
that material or in the Appropriate Legal Notices displayed by works
containing it; or * c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of
that material, or requiring that modiﬁed versions of such material be
marked in reasonable ways as diﬀerent from the original version; or *
d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or authors of the material; or * e) Declining to grant rights under trademark
law for use of some trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or *
f) Requiring indemniﬁcation of licensors and authors of that material
by anyone who conveys the material (or modiﬁed versions of it) with
contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for any liability
that these contractual assumptions directly impose on those licensors
and authors.
All other non-permissive additional terms are considered “further restrictions” within the meaning of section 10. If the Program as you
received it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is governed by this License along with a term that is a further restriction,
you may remove that term. If a license document contains a further
restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this License, you
may add to a covered work material governed by the terms of that license document, provided that the further restriction does not survive
such relicensing or conveying.
If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you
must place, in the relevant source ﬁles, a statement of the additional
terms that apply to those ﬁles, or a notice indicating where to ﬁnd the
applicable terms.
Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the
form of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions; the above
requirements apply either way. 8. Termination.
You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly
provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to propagate or
modify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under
this License (including any patent licenses granted under the third
paragraph of section 11).
However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your license
from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and ﬁnally terminates

your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright holder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means prior to 60 days
after the cessation.
Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated
permanently if the copyright holder notiﬁes you of the violation by
some reasonable means, this is the ﬁrst time you have received notice
of violation of this License (for any work) from that copyright holder,
and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after your receipt of the
notice.
Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the
licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under
this License. If your rights have been terminated and not permanently
reinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same
material under section 10. 9. Acceptance Not Required for Having
Copies.
You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or run
a copy of the Program. Ancillary propagation of a covered work occurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission to
receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance. However, nothing
other than this License grants you permission to propagate or modify
any covered work. These actions infringe copyright if you do not accept
this License. Therefore, by modifying or propagating a covered work,
you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so. 10. Automatic
Licensing of Downstream Recipients.
Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically receives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and propagate that work, subject to this License. You are not responsible for
enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.
An “entity transaction” is a transaction transferring control of an organization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an organization, or merging organizations. If propagation of a covered work
results from an entity transaction, each party to that transaction who
receives a copy of the work also receives whatever licenses to the work
the party’s predecessor in interest had or could give under the previous
paragraph, plus a right to possession of the Corresponding Source of
the work from the predecessor in interest, if the predecessor has it or
can get it with reasonable eﬀorts.
You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the
rights granted or aﬃrmed under this License. For example, you may
not impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of rights
granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that any
patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, oﬀering for sale, or
importing the Program or any portion of it. 11. Patents.
A “contributor” is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this
License of the Program or a work on which the Program is based. The
work thus licensed is called the contributor’s “contributor version”.
A contributor’s “essential patent claims” are all patent claims owned
or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or hereafter
acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted by this
License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version, but do
not include claims that would be infringed only as a consequence of
further modiﬁcation of the contributor version. For purposes of this
deﬁnition, “control” includes the right to grant patent sublicenses in a
manner consistent with the requirements of this License.
Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free
patent license under the contributor’s essential patent claims, to make,
use, sell, oﬀer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and propagate the contents of its contributor version.
In the following three paragraphs, a “patent license” is any express
agreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a
patent (such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant
not to sue for patent infringement). To “grant” such a patent license
to a party means to make such an agreement or commitment not to
enforce a patent against the party.
If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license,
and the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone
to copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through
a publicly available network server or other readily accessible means,
then you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so
available, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the beneﬁt of the patent
license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner consistent
with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent license to
downstream recipients. “Knowingly relying” means you have actual
knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the covered work in a country, or your recipient’s use of the covered work
in a country, would infringe one or more identiﬁable patents in that
country that you have reason to believe are valid.
If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or arrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a covered
work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties receiving the
covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify or convey a
speciﬁc copy of the covered work, then the patent license you grant is
automatically extended to all recipients of the covered work and works
based on it.
A patent license is “discriminatory” if it does not include within the
scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is conditioned on the
non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are speciﬁcally granted
under this License. You may not convey a covered work if you are
a party to an arrangement with a third party that is in the business
of distributing software, under which you make payment to the third
party based on the extent of your activity of conveying the work, and
under which the third party grants, to any of the parties who would
receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory patent license (a)
in connection with copies of the covered work conveyed by you (or
copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily for and in connection
with speciﬁc products or compilations that contain the covered work,
unless you entered into that arrangement, or that patent license was
granted, prior to 28 March 2007.
Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting any
implied license or other defenses to infringement that may otherwise
be available to you under applicable patent law. 12. No Surrender of
Others’ Freedom.
If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement
or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do
not excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot convey a covered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations
under this License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not convey it at all. For example, if you agree to
terms that obligate you to collect a royalty for further conveying from
those to whom you convey the Program, the only way you could satisfy

both those terms and this License would be to refrain entirely from
conveying the Program. 13. Use with the GNU Aﬀero General Public
License.
Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have permission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed under
version 3 of the GNU Aﬀero General Public License into a single combined work, and to convey the resulting work. The terms of this License will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work, but
the special requirements of the GNU Aﬀero General Public License,
section 13, concerning interaction through a network will apply to the
combination as such. 14. Revised Versions of this License.
The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the GNU General Public License from time to time. Such new
versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may diﬀer
in detail to address new problems or concerns.
Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program
speciﬁes that a certain numbered version of the GNU General Public License “or any later version” applies to it, you have the option of
following the terms and conditions either of that numbered version or
of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation. If
the Program does not specify a version number of the GNU General
Public License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free
Software Foundation.
If the Program speciﬁes that a proxy can decide which future versions
of the GNU General Public License can be used, that proxy’s public
statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you to
choose that version for the Program.

Later license versions may give you additional or diﬀerent permissions.
However, no additional obligations are imposed on any author or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a later version. 15.
Disclaimer of Warranty.

THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN
OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM
“AS IS” WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO,
THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND
FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK
AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION. 16. Limitation of Liability.

IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR
AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER,
OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS
THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU
FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF
THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING
BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR
THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER
OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY
OF SUCH DAMAGES. 17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.

If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided above
cannot be given local legal eﬀect according to their terms, reviewing
courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates an absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the Program, unless a
warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a copy of the Program
in return for a fee.

You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License
along with this program. If not, see <http://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.

END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS How to Apply These Terms
to Your New Programs

If the program does terminal interaction, make it output a short notice
like this when it starts in an interactive mode:

If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest
possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it
free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these
terms.

<program> Copyright (C) <year> <name of author> This program
comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type ‘show
w’. This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it under
certain conditions; type ‘show c’ for details.

To do so, attach the following notices to the program. It is safest to
attach them to the start of each source ﬁle to most eﬀectively state the
exclusion of warranty; and each ﬁle should have at least the “copyright”
line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.
<one line to give the program’s name and a brief idea of what it does.>
Copyright (C) <year> <name of author>
This program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify
it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by
the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or (at
your option) any later version.
This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but
WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty
of MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. See the GNU General Public License for more details.

Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper
mail.

The hypothetical commands ‘show w’ and ‘show c’ should show the
appropriate parts of the General Public License. Of course, your program’s commands might be diﬀerent; for a GUI interface, you would
use an “about box”.
You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or
school, if any, to sign a “copyright disclaimer” for the program, if necessary. For more information on this, and how to apply and follow the
GNU GPL, see <http://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.
The GNU General Public License does not permit incorporating your
program into proprietary programs. If your program is a subroutine
library, you may consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary
applications with the library. If this is what you want to do, use the
GNU Lesser General Public License instead of this License. But ﬁrst,
please read <http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/why-not-lgpl.html>.

18.2 GNU Free Documentation License
Version 1.3, 3 November 2008
Copyright © 2000, 2001, 2002, 2007, 2008 Free Software Foundation,
Inc. <http://fsf.org/>
Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this
license document, but changing it is not allowed. 0. PREAMBLE
The purpose of this License is to make a manual, textbook, or other
functional and useful document ”free” in the sense of freedom: to assure everyone the eﬀective freedom to copy and redistribute it, with or
without modifying it, either commercially or noncommercially. Secondarily, this License preserves for the author and publisher a way to
get credit for their work, while not being considered responsible for
modiﬁcations made by others.
This License is a kind of ”copyleft”, which means that derivative works
of the document must themselves be free in the same sense. It complements the GNU General Public License, which is a copyleft license
designed for free software.
We have designed this License in order to use it for manuals for free
software, because free software needs free documentation: a free program should come with manuals providing the same freedoms that the
software does. But this License is not limited to software manuals;
it can be used for any textual work, regardless of subject matter or
whether it is published as a printed book. We recommend this License principally for works whose purpose is instruction or reference.
1. APPLICABILITY AND DEFINITIONS
This License applies to any manual or other work, in any medium,
that contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it can
be distributed under the terms of this License. Such a notice grants a
world-wide, royalty-free license, unlimited in duration, to use that work
under the conditions stated herein. The ”Document”, below, refers to
any such manual or work. Any member of the public is a licensee, and
is addressed as ”you”. You accept the license if you copy, modify or
distribute the work in a way requiring permission under copyright law.
A ”Modiﬁed Version” of the Document means any work containing the
Document or a portion of it, either copied verbatim, or with modiﬁcations and/or translated into another language.
A ”Secondary Section” is a named appendix or a front-matter section of the Document that deals exclusively with the relationship of
the publishers or authors of the Document to the Document’s overall
subject (or to related matters) and contains nothing that could fall
directly within that overall subject. (Thus, if the Document is in part
a textbook of mathematics, a Secondary Section may not explain any
mathematics.) The relationship could be a matter of historical connection with the subject or with related matters, or of legal, commercial,
philosophical, ethical or political position regarding them.
The ”Invariant Sections” are certain Secondary Sections whose titles
are designated, as being those of Invariant Sections, in the notice that
says that the Document is released under this License. If a section does
not ﬁt the above deﬁnition of Secondary then it is not allowed to be
designated as Invariant. The Document may contain zero Invariant
Sections. If the Document does not identify any Invariant Sections
then there are none.
The ”Cover Texts” are certain short passages of text that are listed, as
Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts, in the notice that says that
the Document is released under this License. A Front-Cover Text may
be at most 5 words, and a Back-Cover Text may be at most 25 words.
A ”Transparent” copy of the Document means a machine-readable
copy, represented in a format whose speciﬁcation is available to the
general public, that is suitable for revising the document straightforwardly with generic text editors or (for images composed of pixels)
generic paint programs or (for drawings) some widely available drawing
editor, and that is suitable for input to text formatters or for automatic
translation to a variety of formats suitable for input to text formatters.
A copy made in an otherwise Transparent ﬁle format whose markup,
or absence of markup, has been arranged to thwart or discourage subsequent modiﬁcation by readers is not Transparent. An image format
is not Transparent if used for any substantial amount of text. A copy
that is not ”Transparent” is called ”Opaque”.
Examples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include plain
ASCII without markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input format, SGML or XML using a publicly available DTD, and standardconforming simple HTML, PostScript or PDF designed for human
modiﬁcation. Examples of transparent image formats include PNG,
XCF and JPG. Opaque formats include proprietary formats that can
be read and edited only by proprietary word processors, SGML or
XML for which the DTD and/or processing tools are not generally
available, and the machine-generated HTML, PostScript or PDF produced by some word processors for output purposes only.
The ”Title Page” means, for a printed book, the title page itself, plus
such following pages as are needed to hold, legibly, the material this
License requires to appear in the title page. For works in formats
which do not have any title page as such, ”Title Page” means the text
near the most prominent appearance of the work’s title, preceding the
beginning of the body of the text.
The ”publisher” means any person or entity that distributes copies of
the Document to the public.
A section ”Entitled XYZ” means a named subunit of the Document
whose title either is precisely XYZ or contains XYZ in parentheses

following text that translates XYZ in another language. (Here XYZ
stands for a speciﬁc section name mentioned below, such as ”Acknowledgements”, ”Dedications”, ”Endorsements”, or ”History”.) To ”Preserve
the Title” of such a section when you modify the Document means that
it remains a section ”Entitled XYZ” according to this deﬁnition.
The Document may include Warranty Disclaimers next to the notice
which states that this License applies to the Document. These Warranty Disclaimers are considered to be included by reference in this
License, but only as regards disclaiming warranties: any other implication that these Warranty Disclaimers may have is void and has no
eﬀect on the meaning of this License. 2. VERBATIM COPYING
You may copy and distribute the Document in any medium, either
commercially or noncommercially, provided that this License, the
copyright notices, and the license notice saying this License applies
to the Document are reproduced in all copies, and that you add no
other conditions whatsoever to those of this License. You may not use
technical measures to obstruct or control the reading or further copying of the copies you make or distribute. However, you may accept
compensation in exchange for copies. If you distribute a large enough
number of copies you must also follow the conditions in section 3.
You may also lend copies, under the same conditions stated above, and
you may publicly display copies. 3. COPYING IN QUANTITY
If you publish printed copies (or copies in media that commonly have
printed covers) of the Document, numbering more than 100, and the
Document’s license notice requires Cover Texts, you must enclose the
copies in covers that carry, clearly and legibly, all these Cover Texts:
Front-Cover Texts on the front cover, and Back-Cover Texts on the
back cover. Both covers must also clearly and legibly identify you as
the publisher of these copies. The front cover must present the full title
with all words of the title equally prominent and visible. You may add
other material on the covers in addition. Copying with changes limited
to the covers, as long as they preserve the title of the Document and
satisfy these conditions, can be treated as verbatim copying in other
respects.
If the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to ﬁt legibly,
you should put the ﬁrst ones listed (as many as ﬁt reasonably) on the
actual cover, and continue the rest onto adjacent pages.
If you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document numbering
more than 100, you must either include a machine-readable Transparent copy along with each Opaque copy, or state in or with each Opaque
copy a computer-network location from which the general networkusing public has access to download using public-standard network
protocols a complete Transparent copy of the Document, free of added
material. If you use the latter option, you must take reasonably prudent steps, when you begin distribution of Opaque copies in quantity,
to ensure that this Transparent copy will remain thus accessible at the
stated location until at least one year after the last time you distribute
an Opaque copy (directly or through your agents or retailers) of that
edition to the public.
It is requested, but not required, that you contact the authors of the
Document well before redistributing any large number of copies, to
give them a chance to provide you with an updated version of the
Document. 4. MODIFICATIONS
You may copy and distribute a Modiﬁed Version of the Document under the conditions of sections 2 and 3 above, provided that you release
the Modiﬁed Version under precisely this License, with the Modiﬁed
Version ﬁlling the role of the Document, thus licensing distribution
and modiﬁcation of the Modiﬁed Version to whoever possesses a copy
of it. In addition, you must do these things in the Modiﬁed Version:
* A. Use in the Title Page (and on the covers, if any) a title distinct from that of the Document, and from those of previous versions
(which should, if there were any, be listed in the History section of
the Document). You may use the same title as a previous version if
the original publisher of that version gives permission. * B. List on
the Title Page, as authors, one or more persons or entities responsible
for authorship of the modiﬁcations in the Modiﬁed Version, together
with at least ﬁve of the principal authors of the Document (all of its
principal authors, if it has fewer than ﬁve), unless they release you
from this requirement. * C. State on the Title page the name of the
publisher of the Modiﬁed Version, as the publisher. * D. Preserve
all the copyright notices of the Document. * E. Add an appropriate
copyright notice for your modiﬁcations adjacent to the other copyright
notices. * F. Include, immediately after the copyright notices, a license
notice giving the public permission to use the Modiﬁed Version under
the terms of this License, in the form shown in the Addendum below.
* G. Preserve in that license notice the full lists of Invariant Sections
and required Cover Texts given in the Document’s license notice. *
H. Include an unaltered copy of this License. * I. Preserve the section
Entitled ”History”, Preserve its Title, and add to it an item stating at
least the title, year, new authors, and publisher of the Modiﬁed Version as given on the Title Page. If there is no section Entitled ”History”
in the Document, create one stating the title, year, authors, and publisher of the Document as given on its Title Page, then add an item
describing the Modiﬁed Version as stated in the previous sentence. *
J. Preserve the network location, if any, given in the Document for
public access to a Transparent copy of the Document, and likewise the
network locations given in the Document for previous versions it was
based on. These may be placed in the ”History” section. You may omit
a network location for a work that was published at least four years
before the Document itself, or if the original publisher of the version it
refers to gives permission. * K. For any section Entitled ”Acknowledgements” or ”Dedications”, Preserve the Title of the section, and preserve
in the section all the substance and tone of each of the contributor acknowledgements and/or dedications given therein. * L. Preserve all
the Invariant Sections of the Document, unaltered in their text and

in their titles. Section numbers or the equivalent are not considered
part of the section titles. * M. Delete any section Entitled ”Endorsements”. Such a section may not be included in the Modiﬁed Version.
* N. Do not retitle any existing section to be Entitled ”Endorsements”
or to conﬂict in title with any Invariant Section. * O. Preserve any
Warranty Disclaimers.
If the Modiﬁed Version includes new front-matter sections or appendices that qualify as Secondary Sections and contain no material copied
from the Document, you may at your option designate some or all of
these sections as invariant. To do this, add their titles to the list of
Invariant Sections in the Modiﬁed Version’s license notice. These titles
must be distinct from any other section titles.
You may add a section Entitled ”Endorsements”, provided it contains nothing but endorsements of your Modiﬁed Version by various
parties—for example, statements of peer review or that the text has
been approved by an organization as the authoritative deﬁnition of a
standard.
You may add a passage of up to ﬁve words as a Front-Cover Text,
and a passage of up to 25 words as a Back-Cover Text, to the end
of the list of Cover Texts in the Modiﬁed Version. Only one passage
of Front-Cover Text and one of Back-Cover Text may be added by
(or through arrangements made by) any one entity. If the Document
already includes a cover text for the same cover, previously added by
you or by arrangement made by the same entity you are acting on
behalf of, you may not add another; but you may replace the old one,
on explicit permission from the previous publisher that added the old
one.
The author(s) and publisher(s) of the Document do not by this License give permission to use their names for publicity for or to assert or imply endorsement of any Modiﬁed Version. 5. COMBINING
DOCUMENTS
You may combine the Document with other documents released under
this License, under the terms deﬁned in section 4 above for modiﬁed
versions, provided that you include in the combination all of the Invariant Sections of all of the original documents, unmodiﬁed, and list
them all as Invariant Sections of your combined work in its license
notice, and that you preserve all their Warranty Disclaimers.
The combined work need only contain one copy of this License, and
multiple identical Invariant Sections may be replaced with a single
copy. If there are multiple Invariant Sections with the same name
but diﬀerent contents, make the title of each such section unique by
adding at the end of it, in parentheses, the name of the original author or publisher of that section if known, or else a unique number.
Make the same adjustment to the section titles in the list of Invariant
Sections in the license notice of the combined work.
In the combination, you must combine any sections Entitled ”History”
in the various original documents, forming one section Entitled ”History”; likewise combine any sections Entitled ”Acknowledgements”, and
any sections Entitled ”Dedications”. You must delete all sections Entitled ”Endorsements”. 6. COLLECTIONS OF DOCUMENTS
You may make a collection consisting of the Document and other documents released under this License, and replace the individual copies
of this License in the various documents with a single copy that is
included in the collection, provided that you follow the rules of this
License for verbatim copying of each of the documents in all other
respects.
You may extract a single document from such a collection, and distribute it individually under this License, provided you insert a copy
of this License into the extracted document, and follow this License
in all other respects regarding verbatim copying of that document. 7.
AGGREGATION WITH INDEPENDENT WORKS
A compilation of the Document or its derivatives with other separate
and independent documents or works, in or on a volume of a storage or
distribution medium, is called an ”aggregate” if the copyright resulting
from the compilation is not used to limit the legal rights of the compilation’s users beyond what the individual works permit. When the
Document is included in an aggregate, this License does not apply to
the other works in the aggregate which are not themselves derivative
works of the Document.
If the Cover Text requirement of section 3 is applicable to these copies
of the Document, then if the Document is less than one half of the
entire aggregate, the Document’s Cover Texts may be placed on covers that bracket the Document within the aggregate, or the electronic
equivalent of covers if the Document is in electronic form. Otherwise
they must appear on printed covers that bracket the whole aggregate.
8. TRANSLATION
Translation is considered a kind of modiﬁcation, so you may distribute
translations of the Document under the terms of section 4. Replacing
Invariant Sections with translations requires special permission from
their copyright holders, but you may include translations of some or all
Invariant Sections in addition to the original versions of these Invariant Sections. You may include a translation of this License, and all the
license notices in the Document, and any Warranty Disclaimers, provided that you also include the original English version of this License
and the original versions of those notices and disclaimers. In case of a
disagreement between the translation and the original version of this
License or a notice or disclaimer, the original version will prevail.
If a section in the Document is Entitled ”Acknowledgements”, ”Dedications”, or ”History”, the requirement (section 4) to Preserve its Title

(section 1) will typically require changing the actual title. 9. TERMINATION
You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Document
except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute it is void, and will
automatically terminate your rights under this License.
However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your license
from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and ﬁnally terminates
your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright holder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means prior to 60 days
after the cessation.
Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated
permanently if the copyright holder notiﬁes you of the violation by
some reasonable means, this is the ﬁrst time you have received notice
of violation of this License (for any work) from that copyright holder,
and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after your receipt of the
notice.
Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the
licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under
this License. If your rights have been terminated and not permanently
reinstated, receipt of a copy of some or all of the same material does
not give you any rights to use it. 10. FUTURE REVISIONS OF THIS
LICENSE
The Free Software Foundation may publish new, revised versions
of the GNU Free Documentation License from time to time. Such
new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but
may diﬀer in detail to address new problems or concerns. See
http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/.
Each version of the License is given a distinguishing version number.
If the Document speciﬁes that a particular numbered version of this
License ”or any later version” applies to it, you have the option of
following the terms and conditions either of that speciﬁed version or
of any later version that has been published (not as a draft) by the
Free Software Foundation. If the Document does not specify a version
number of this License, you may choose any version ever published
(not as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation. If the Document
speciﬁes that a proxy can decide which future versions of this License
can be used, that proxy’s public statement of acceptance of a version
permanently authorizes you to choose that version for the Document.
11. RELICENSING
”Massive Multiauthor Collaboration Site” (or ”MMC Site”) means any
World Wide Web server that publishes copyrightable works and also
provides prominent facilities for anybody to edit those works. A public
wiki that anybody can edit is an example of such a server. A ”Massive
Multiauthor Collaboration” (or ”MMC”) contained in the site means
any set of copyrightable works thus published on the MMC site.
”CC-BY-SA” means the Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike
3.0 license published by Creative Commons Corporation, a not-forproﬁt corporation with a principal place of business in San Francisco,
California, as well as future copyleft versions of that license published
by that same organization.
”Incorporate” means to publish or republish a Document, in whole or
in part, as part of another Document.
An MMC is ”eligible for relicensing” if it is licensed under this License,
and if all works that were ﬁrst published under this License somewhere
other than this MMC, and subsequently incorporated in whole or in
part into the MMC, (1) had no cover texts or invariant sections, and
(2) were thus incorporated prior to November 1, 2008.
The operator of an MMC Site may republish an MMC contained in
the site under CC-BY-SA on the same site at any time before August
1, 2009, provided the MMC is eligible for relicensing. ADDENDUM:
How to use this License for your documents
To use this License in a document you have written, include a copy
of the License in the document and put the following copyright and
license notices just after the title page:
Copyright (C) YEAR YOUR NAME. Permission is granted to copy,
distribute and/or modify this document under the terms of the GNU
Free Documentation License, Version 1.3 or any later version published by the Free Software Foundation; with no Invariant Sections,
no Front-Cover Texts, and no Back-Cover Texts. A copy of the license
is included in the section entitled ”GNU Free Documentation License”.
If you have Invariant Sections, Front-Cover Texts and Back-Cover
Texts, replace the ”with … Texts.” line with this:
with the Invariant Sections being LIST THEIR TITLES, with the
Front-Cover Texts being LIST, and with the Back-Cover Texts being
LIST.
If you have Invariant Sections without Cover Texts, or some other
combination of the three, merge those two alternatives to suit the situation.
If your document contains nontrivial examples of program code, we
recommend releasing these examples in parallel under your choice of
free software license, such as the GNU General Public License, to permit their use in free software.

18.3 GNU Lesser General Public License
GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
Version 3, 29 June 2007
Copyright © 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <http://fsf.org/>

The “Corresponding Application Code” for a Combined Work means
the object code and/or source code for the Application, including any
data and utility programs needed for reproducing the Combined Work
from the Application, but excluding the System Libraries of the Combined Work. 1. Exception to Section 3 of the GNU GPL.

Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this
license document, but changing it is not allowed.

You may convey a covered work under sections 3 and 4 of this License
without being bound by section 3 of the GNU GPL. 2. Conveying
Modiﬁed Versions.

This version of the GNU Lesser General Public License incorporates
the terms and conditions of version 3 of the GNU General Public License, supplemented by the additional permissions listed below. 0.
Additional Deﬁnitions.

If you modify a copy of the Library, and, in your modiﬁcations, a facility refers to a function or data to be supplied by an Application that
uses the facility (other than as an argument passed when the facility
is invoked), then you may convey a copy of the modiﬁed version:

As used herein, “this License” refers to version 3 of the GNU Lesser
General Public License, and the “GNU GPL” refers to version 3 of the
GNU General Public License.

* a) under this License, provided that you make a good faith eﬀort to
ensure that, in the event an Application does not supply the function
or data, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of its
purpose remains meaningful, or * b) under the GNU GPL, with none
of the additional permissions of this License applicable to that copy.

“The Library” refers to a covered work governed by this License, other
than an Application or a Combined Work as deﬁned below.

3. Object Code Incorporating Material from Library Header Files.
An “Application” is any work that makes use of an interface provided
by the Library, but which is not otherwise based on the Library. Deﬁning a subclass of a class deﬁned by the Library is deemed a mode of
using an interface provided by the Library.
A “Combined Work” is a work produced by combining or linking an
Application with the Library. The particular version of the Library
with which the Combined Work was made is also called the “Linked
Version”.
The “Minimal Corresponding Source” for a Combined Work means the
Corresponding Source for the Combined Work, excluding any source
code for portions of the Combined Work that, considered in isolation,
are based on the Application, and not on the Linked Version.

The object code form of an Application may incorporate material from
a header ﬁle that is part of the Library. You may convey such object
code under terms of your choice, provided that, if the incorporated material is not limited to numerical parameters, data structure layouts
and accessors, or small macros, inline functions and templates (ten or
fewer lines in length), you do both of the following:
* a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the object code that the
Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by
this License. * b) Accompany the object code with a copy of the GNU
GPL and this license document.
4. Combined Works.

You may convey a Combined Work under terms of your choice that,
taken together, eﬀectively do not restrict modiﬁcation of the portions
of the Library contained in the Combined Work and reverse engineering for debugging such modiﬁcations, if you also do each of the following:

You may place library facilities that are a work based on the Library
side by side in a single library together with other library facilities that
are not Applications and are not covered by this License, and convey
such a combined library under terms of your choice, if you do both of
the following:

* a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the Combined Work
that the Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are
covered by this License. * b) Accompany the Combined Work with a
copy of the GNU GPL and this license document. * c) For a Combined Work that displays copyright notices during execution, include
the copyright notice for the Library among these notices, as well as a
reference directing the user to the copies of the GNU GPL and this
license document. * d) Do one of the following: o 0) Convey the
Minimal Corresponding Source under the terms of this License, and
the Corresponding Application Code in a form suitable for, and under
terms that permit, the user to recombine or relink the Application
with a modiﬁed version of the Linked Version to produce a modiﬁed
Combined Work, in the manner speciﬁed by section 6 of the GNU
GPL for conveying Corresponding Source. o 1) Use a suitable shared
library mechanism for linking with the Library. A suitable mechanism
is one that (a) uses at run time a copy of the Library already present
on the user’s computer system, and (b) will operate properly with a
modiﬁed version of the Library that is interface-compatible with the
Linked Version. * e) Provide Installation Information, but only if you
would otherwise be required to provide such information under section
6 of the GNU GPL, and only to the extent that such information is
necessary to install and execute a modiﬁed version of the Combined
Work produced by recombining or relinking the Application with a
modiﬁed version of the Linked Version. (If you use option 4d0, the
Installation Information must accompany the Minimal Corresponding
Source and Corresponding Application Code. If you use option 4d1,
you must provide the Installation Information in the manner speciﬁed
by section 6 of the GNU GPL for conveying Corresponding Source.)

* a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work
based on the Library, uncombined with any other library facilities,
conveyed under the terms of this License. * b) Give prominent notice with the combined library that part of it is a work based on the
Library, and explaining where to ﬁnd the accompanying uncombined
form of the same work.

5. Combined Libraries.

6. Revised Versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License.
The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License from time to time.
Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but
may diﬀer in detail to address new problems or concerns.
Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Library
as you received it speciﬁes that a certain numbered version of the GNU
Lesser General Public License “or any later version” applies to it, you
have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that
published version or of any later version published by the Free Software
Foundation. If the Library as you received it does not specify a version
number of the GNU Lesser General Public License, you may choose
any version of the GNU Lesser General Public License ever published
by the Free Software Foundation.
If the Library as you received it speciﬁes that a proxy can decide
whether future versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License
shall apply, that proxy’s public statement of acceptance of any version is permanent authorization for you to choose that version for the
Library.
