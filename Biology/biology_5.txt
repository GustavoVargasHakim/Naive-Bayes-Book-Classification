characterization of sequences that foretell the appearance of specific diseases and particular physical attributes. One consequence will be the development of better means of diagnosing and treating diseases. Ultimately,
physicians will be able to devise plans for preventing or managing heart disease or cancer that take account of individual variations. Although the sequencing of the human genome is an enormous step toward a complete understanding of living systems, much work needs to be done. Where are the
functional genes within the sequence, and how do they interact with one another? How is the information in genes converted into the functional characteristics of an organism? Some of our goals in the study of biochemistry
are to learn the concepts, tools, and facts that will allow us to address these
questions. It is indeed an exciting time, the beginning of a new era in biochemistry.

the Genomic Revolution

1.1 DNA ILLUSTRATES THE RELATION BETWEEN
FORM AND FUNCTION
The structure of DNA, an abbreviation for deoxyribonucleic acid, illustrates
a basic principle common to all biomolecules: the intimate relation between
structure and function. The remarkable properties of this chemical substance allow it to function as a very efficient and robust vehicle for storing
information. We begin with an examination of the covalent structure of
DNA and its extension into three dimensions.
1.1.1 DNA Is Constructed from Four Building Blocks
DNA is a linear polymer made up of four different monomers. It has a fixed
backbone from which protrude variable substituents (Figure 1.1). The backbone is built of repeating sugar-phosphate units. The sugars are molecules
of deoxyribose from which DNA receives its name. Joined to each deoxyribose is one of four possible bases: adenine (A), cytosine (C), guanine (G),
and thymine (T).

All four bases are planar but differ significantly in other respects. Thus, the
monomers of DNA consist of a sugar-phosphate unit, with one of four bases
attached to the sugar. These bases can be arranged in any order along a strand
of DNA. The order of these bases is what is displayed in the sequence that
begins this chapter. For example, the first base in the sequence shown is G

(guanine), the second is A (adenine), and so on. The sequence of bases along
a DNA strand constitutes the genetic information—the instructions for assembling proteins, which themselves orchestrate the synthesis of a host of
other biomolecules that form cells and ultimately organisms.

DNA: Form and Function

1.1.2 Two Single Strands of DNA Combine
to Form a Double Helix
Most DNA molecules consist of not one but two strands
(Figure 1.2). How are these strands positioned with respect to one another? In 1953, James Watson and Francis
Crick deduced the arrangement of these strands and proposed a three-dimensional structure for DNA molecules.
This structure is a double helix composed of two intertwined strands arranged such that the sugar-phosphate
backbone lies on the outside and the bases on the inside. The key to this
structure is that the bases form specific base pairs (bp) held together by hydrogen bonds (Section 1.3.1): adenine pairs with thymine (A–T) and guanine
pairs with cytosine (G–C), as shown in Figure 1.3. Hydrogen bonds are much
weaker than covalent bonds such as the carbon–carbon or carbon–nitrogen
bonds that define the structures of the bases themselves. Such weak bonds
are crucial to biochemical systems; they are weak enough to be reversibly
broken in biochemical processes, yet they are strong enough, when many
form simultaneously, to help stabilize specific structures such as the double helix.

double-helical structure of DNA proposed

backbones of the two chains are shown in

The structure proposed by Watson and Crick has two properties of central importance to the role of DNA as the hereditary material. First, the
structure is compatible with any sequence of bases. The base pairs have essentially the same shape (Figure 1.4) and thus fit equally well into the center of the double-helical structure. Second, because of base-pairing, the sequence of bases along one strand completely determines the sequence along the
other strand. As Watson and Crick so coyly wrote: “It has not escaped our
notice that the specific pairing we have postulated immediately suggests a
possible copying mechanism for the genetic material.” Thus, if the DNA
double helix is separated into two single strands, each strand can act as a
template for the generation of its partner strand through specific base-pair
formation (Figure 1.5). The three-dimensional structure of DNA beautifully
illustrates the close connection between molecular form and function.

1.1.3 RNA Is an Intermediate in the Flow of Genetic
Information
An important nucleic acid in addition to DNA is ribonucleic acid (RNA).
Some viruses use RNA as the genetic material, and even those organisms
that employ DNA must first convert the genetic information into RNA for
the information to be accessible or functional. Structurally, RNA is quite
similar to DNA. It is a linear polymer made up of a limited number of repeating monomers, each composed of a sugar, a phosphate, and a base. The
sugar is ribose instead of deoxyribose (hence, RNA) and one of the bases is
uracil (U) instead of thymine (T). Unlike DNA, an RNA molecule usually
exists as a single strand, although significant segments within an RNA molecule may be double stranded, with G pairing primarily with C and A pairing with U. This intrastrand base-pairing generates RNA molecules with
complex structures and activities, including catalysis.
RNA has three basic roles in the cell. First, it serves as the intermediate
in the flow of information from DNA to protein, the primary functional
molecules of the cell. The DNA is copied, or transcribed, into messenger
RNA (mRNA), and the mRNA is translated into protein. Second, RNA
molecules serve as adaptors that translate the information in the nucleic acid
sequence of mRNA into information designating the sequence of constituents that make up a protein. Finally, RNA molecules are important
functional components of the molecular machinery, called ribosomes, that
carries out the translation process. As will be discussed in Chapter 2, the
unique position of RNA between the storage of genetic information in DNA
and the functional expression of this information as protein as well as its
potential to combine genetic and catalytic capabilities are indications that
RNA played an important role in the evolution of life.
1.1.4 Proteins, Encoded by Nucleic Acids, Perform Most Cell
Functions
A major role for many sequences of DNA is to encode the sequences of proteins, the workhorses within cells, participating in essentially all processes.
Some proteins are key structural components, whereas others are specific
catalysts (termed enzymes) that promote chemical reactions. Like DNA and
RNA, proteins are linear polymers. However, proteins are more complicated in that they are formed from a selection of 20 building blocks, called
amino acids, rather than 4.
The functional properties of proteins, like those of other biomolecules,
are determined by their three-dimensional structures. Proteins possess an
extremely important property: a protein spontaneously folds into a welldefined and elaborate three-dimensional structure that is dictated entirely
by the sequence of amino acids along its chain (Figure 1.6). The self-folding
nature of proteins constitutes the transition from the one-dimensional world of
sequence information to the three-dimensional world of biological function. This
marvelous ability of proteins to self assemble into complex structures is responsible for their dominant role in biochemistry.
How is the sequence of bases along DNA translated into a sequence of
amino acids along a protein chain? We will consider the details of this process
in later chapters, but the important finding is that three bases along a DNA
chain encode a single amino acid. The specific correspondence between a set
of three bases and 1 of the 20 amino acids is called the genetic code. Like the
use of DNA as the genetic material, the genetic code is essentially universal; the same sequences of three bases encode the same amino acids in all
life forms from simple microorganisms to complex, multicellular organisms
such as human beings.

Knowledge of the functional and structural properties of proteins is absolutely essential to understanding the significance of the human genome
sequence. For example, the sequence at the beginning of this chapter corresponds to a region of the genome that differs in people who have the genetic disorder cystic fibrosis. The most common mutation causing cystic fibrosis, the loss of three consecutive Ts from the gene sequence, leads to the
loss of a single amino acid within a protein chain of 1480 amino acids. This
seemingly slight difference—a loss of 1 amino acid of nearly 1500—creates
a life-threatening condition. What is the normal function of the protein encoded by this gene? What properties of the encoded protein are compromised by this subtle defect? Can this knowledge be used to develop new
treatments? These questions fall in the realm of biochemistry. Knowledge
of the human genome sequence will greatly accelerate the pace at which connections are made between DNA sequences and disease as well as other human characteristics. However, these connections will be nearly meaningless
without the knowledge of biochemistry necessary to interpret and exploit
them.

1.2 BIOCHEMICAL UNITY UNDERLIES
BIOLOGICAL DIVERSITY
The stunning variety of living systems (Figure 1.7) belies a striking similarity. The common use of DNA and the genetic code by all organisms underlies one of the most powerful discoveries of the past century—namely,
that organisms are remarkably uniform at the molecular level. All organisms
are built from similar molecular components distinguishable by relatively
minor variations. This uniformity reveals that all organisms on Earth have

Cystic fibrosis—
A disease that results from a decrease
in fluid and salt secretion by a transport protein referred to as the cystic
fibrosis transmembrane conductance
regulator (CFTR). As a result of this
defect, secretion from the pancreas is

accumulates in the lungs, leading to
chronic lung infections.

arisen from a common ancestor. A core of essential biochemical processes, common to all organisms, appeared
early in the evolution of life. The diversity of life in the
modern world has been generated by evolutionary
processes acting on these core processes through millions or even billions of years. As we will see repeatedly,
the generation of diversity has very often resulted from
the adaptation of existing biochemical components to
new roles rather than the development of fundamentally
new biochemical technology. The striking uniformity of
life at the molecular level affords the student of biochemistry a particularly clear view into the essence of
biological processes that applies to all organisms from
human beings to the simplest microorganisms.
On the basis of their biochemical characteristics, the
diverse organisms of the modern world can be divided
into three fundamental groups called domains: Eukarya
FIGURE 1.8 The tree of life. A possible evolutionary path from a

macroscopic organisms, including human beings as well
as many microscopic, unicellular organisms such as
yeast. The defining characteristic of eukaryotes is the presence of a well-defined nucleus within each cell. Unicellular organisms such as bacteria, which
lack a nucleus, are referred to as prokaryotes. The prokaryotes were reclassified as two separate domains in response to Carl Woese’s discovery in 1977
that certain bacteria-like organisms are biochemically quite distinct from
better-characterized bacterial species. These organisms, now recognized as
having diverged from bacteria early in evolution, are archaea. Evolutionary
paths from a common ancestor to modern organisms can be developed and
analyzed on the basis of biochemical information. One such path is shown
in Figure 1.8.
By examining biochemistry in the context of the tree of life, we can often understand how particular molecules or processes helped organisms
adapt to specific environments or life styles. We can ask not only what biochemical processes take place, but also why particular strategies appeared in
the course of evolution. In addition to being sources of historical insights,
the answers to such questions are often highly instructive with regard to the
biochemistry of contemporary organisms.

1.3 CHEMICAL BONDS IN BIOCHEMISTRY
The essence of biological processes—the basis of the uniformity of living systems—is in its most fundamental sense molecular interactions; in
other words, the chemistry that takes place between molecules. Biochemistry is the chemistry that takes place within living systems. To truly
understand biochemistry, we need to understand chemical bonding. We
review here the types of chemical bonds that are important for biochemicals and their transformations.
The strongest bonds that are present in biochemicals are covalent bonds,
such as the bonds that hold the atoms together within the individual bases
shown in Figure 1.3. A covalent bond is formed by the sharing of a pair of
electrons between adjacent atoms. A typical carbon–carbon (C–C) covalent
bond has a bond length of 1.54 Å and bond energy of 85 kcal mol1
(356 kJ mol1). Because this energy is relatively high, considerable energy
must be expended to break covalent bonds. More than one electron pair can

7552dc01_3-18

5/15/01

9:12 AM

Page 9

9

be shared between two atoms to form a multiple covalent bond. For example, three of the bases in Figure 1.4 include carbon–oxygen (C:O) double
bonds. These bonds are even stronger than C–C single bonds, with energies near 175 kcal mol1 (732 kJ mol1).
For some molecules, more than one pattern of covalent bonding can be
written. For example, benzene can be written in two equivalent ways called
resonance structures. Benzene’s true structure is a composite of its two resonance structures. A molecule that can be written as several resonance structures of approximately equal energies has greater stability than does a molecule without multiple resonance structures. Thus, because of its resonance
structures, benzene is unusually stable.
Chemical reactions entail the breaking and forming of covalent bonds.
The flow of electrons in the course of a reaction can be depicted by curved
arrows, a method of representation called “arrow pushing.” Each arrow represents an electron pair.

1.3.1 Reversible Interactions of Biomolecules Are Mediated by
Three Kinds of Noncovalent Bonds
Readily reversible, noncovalent molecular interactions are key steps in the
dance of life. Such weak, noncovalent forces play essential roles in the faithful
replication of DNA, the folding of proteins into intricate three-dimensional
forms, the specific recognition of substrates by enzymes, and the detection
of molecular signals. Indeed, all biological structures and processes depend
on the interplay of noncovalent interactions as well as covalent ones. The
three fundamental noncovalent bonds are electrostatic interactions, hydrogen
bonds, and van der Waals interactions. They differ in geometry, strength, and
specificity. Furthermore, these bonds are greatly affected in different ways by
the presence of water. Let us consider the characteristics of each:
1. Electrostatic interactions. An electrostatic interaction depends on the electric charges on atoms. The energy of an electrostatic interaction is given by
Coulomb’s law:
E  kq1q2Dr
where E is the energy, q1 and q2 are the charges on the two atoms (in units
of the electronic charge), r is the distance between the two atoms (in
angstroms), D is the dielectric constant (which accounts for the effects of
the intervening medium), and k is a proportionality constant (k  332, to
give energies in units of kilocalories per mole, or 1389, for energies in kilojoules per mole). Thus, the electrostatic interaction between two atoms bearing single opposite charges separated by 3 Å in water (which has a dielectric constant of 80) has an energy of 1.4 kcal mol1 (5.9 kJ mol1).
2. Hydrogen bonds. Hydrogen bonds are relatively weak interactions, which
nonetheless are crucial for biological macromolecules such as DNA and proteins. These interactions are also responsible for many of the properties of
water that make it such a special solvent. The hydrogen atom in a hydrogen bond is partly shared between two relatively electronegative atoms such
as nitrogen or oxygen. The hydrogen-bond donor is the group that includes
both the atom to which the hydrogen is more tightly linked and the hydrogen
atom itself, whereas the hydrogen-bond acceptor is the atom less tightly linked
to the hydrogen atom (Figure 1.9). Hydrogen bonds are fundamentally

electrostatic interactions. The relatively electronegative atom to which the
hydrogen atom is covalently bonded pulls electron density away from the
hydrogen atom so that it develops a partial positive charge (). Thus, it
can interact with an atom having a partial negative charge () through an
electrostatic interaction.
Hydrogen bonds are much weaker than covalent bonds. They have energies of 1–3 kcal mol1 (4–13 kJ mol1) compared with approximately
100 kcal mol1 (418 kJ mol1) for a carbon–hydrogen covalent bond.
Hydrogen bonds are also somewhat longer than are covalent bonds; their bond
distances (measured from the hydrogen atom) range from 1.5 to 2.6 Å;
hence, distances ranging from 2.4 to 3.5 Å separate the two nonhydrogen
atoms in a hydrogen bond. The strongest hydrogen bonds have a tendency
to be approximately straight, such that the hydrogen-bond donor, the hydrogen atom, and the hydrogen-bond acceptor lie along a straight line.
3. van der Waals interactions. The basis of a van der Waals interaction is
that the distribution of electronic charge around an atom changes with time.
At any instant, the charge distribution is not perfectly symmetric. This transient asymmetry in the electronic charge around an atom acts through electrostatic interactions to induce a complementary asymmetry in the electron
distribution around its neighboring atoms. The resulting attraction between
two atoms increases as they come closer to each other, until they are separated by the van der Waals contact distance (Figure 1.10). At a shorter distance, very strong repulsive forces become dominant because the outer electron clouds overlap.
Energies associated with van der Waals interactions are quite small; typical interactions contribute from 0.5 to 1.0 kcal mol1 (from 2 to 4 kJ mol1)
per atom pair. When the surfaces of two large molecules come together,
however, a large number of atoms are in van der Waals contact, and the net
effect, summed over many atom pairs, can be substantial.

Weak interactions are the key means by which molecules interact with one
another—enzymes with their substrates, hormones with their receptors, antibodies with their antigens. The strength and specificity of weak interactions are highly dependent on the medium in which they take place, and the
majority of biological interactions take place in water. Two
properties of water are especially important biologically:
1. Water is a polar molecule. The water molecule is bent, not
linear, and so the distribution of charge is asymmetric. The
oxygen nucleus draws electrons away from the hydrogen nuclei, which leaves the region around the hydrogen nuclei with
a net positive charge. The water molecule is thus an electrically polar structure.

FIGURE 1.11 Structure of ice. Hydrogen bonds (shown as
dashed lines) are formed between water molecules.

2. Water is highly cohesive. Water molecules interact strongly
with one another through hydrogen bonds. These interactions are apparent in the structure of ice (Figure 1.11). Networks of hydrogen bonds hold the structure together; similar interactions link molecules in liquid water and account for
the cohesion of liquid water, although, in the liquid state,
some of the hydrogen bonds are broken. The highly cohesive
nature of water dramatically affects the interactions between
molecules in aqueous solution.

7552dc01_3-18

Page 11

What is the effect of the properties of water on the weak interactions discussed in Section 1.3.1? The polarity and hydrogen-bonding capability of
water make it a highly interacting molecule. Water is an excellent solvent
for polar molecules. The reason is that water greatly weakens electrostatic
forces and hydrogen bonding between polar molecules by competing for
their attractions. For example, consider the effect of water on hydrogen
bonding between a carbonyl group and the NH group of an amide.

A hydrogen atom of water can replace the amide hydrogen atom as a
hydrogen-bond donor, whereas the oxygen atom of water can replace the
carbonyl oxygen atom as a hydrogen-bond acceptor. Hence, a strong hydrogen bond between a CO group and an NH group forms only if water is
excluded.
The dielectric constant of water is 80, so water diminishes the strength
of electrostatic attractions by a factor of 80 compared with the strength of
those same interactions in a vacuum. The dielectric constant of water is unusually high because of its polarity and capacity to form oriented solvent
shells around ions. These oriented solvent shells produce electric fields of
their own, which oppose the fields produced by the ions. Consequently, the
presence of water markedly weakens electrostatic interactions between ions.
The existence of life on Earth depends critically on the capacity of water to dissolve a remarkable array of polar molecules that serve as fuels,
building blocks, catalysts, and information carriers. High concentrations of
these polar molecules can coexist in water, where they are free to diffuse and
interact with one another. However, the excellence of water as a solvent
poses a problem, because it also weakens interactions between polar molecules. The presence of water-free microenvironments within biological systems largely circumvents this problem. We will see many examples of these
specially constructed niches in protein molecules. Moreover, the presence
of water with its polar nature permits another kind of weak interaction to
take place, one that drives the folding of proteins (Section 1.3.4) and the
formation of cell boundaries (Section 12.3).
The essence of these interactions, like that of all interactions in biochemistry, is energy. To understand much of biochemistry—bond formation, molecular structure, enzyme catalysis—we need to understand energy.
Thermodynamics provides a valuable tool for approaching this topic. We
will revisit this topic in more detail when we consider enzymes (Chapter 8)
and the basic concepts of metabolism (Chapter 14).
1.3.3 Entropy and the Laws of Thermodynamics
The highly structured, organized nature of living organisms is apparent
and astonishing. This organization extends from the organismal through
the cellular to the molecular level. Indeed, biological processes can seem
magical in that the well-ordered structures and patterns emerge from the
chaotic and disordered world of inanimate objects. However, the organization visible in a cell or a molecule arises from biological events that are
subject to the same physical laws that govern all processes—in particular,
the laws of thermodynamics.

CHAPTER 1 • Prelude: Biochemistry and
the Genomic Revolution

How can we understand the creation of order out of chaos? We begin by
noting that the laws of thermodynamics make a distinction between a system
and its surroundings. A system is defined as the matter within a defined region
of space. The matter in the rest of the universe is called the surroundings. The
First Law of Thermodynamics states that the total energy of a system and its surroundings is constant. In other words, the energy content of the universe is constant; energy can be neither created nor destroyed. Energy can take different
forms, however. Heat, for example, is one form of energy. Heat is a manifestation of the kinetic energy associated with the random motion of molecules.
Alternatively, energy can be present as potential energy, referring to the ability
of energy to be released on the occurrence of some process. Consider, for example, a ball held at the top of a tower. The ball has considerable potential energy because, when it is released, the ball will develop kinetic energy associated with its motion as it falls. Within chemical systems, potential energy is
related to the likelihood that atoms can react with one another. For instance, a
mixture of gasoline and oxygen has much potential energy because these molecules may react to form carbon dioxide and release energy as heat. The First
Law requires that any energy released in the formation of chemical bonds be
used to break other bonds, be released as heat, or be stored in some other form.
Another important thermodynamic concept is that of entropy. Entropy is
a measure of the level of randomness or disorder in a system. The Second Law
of Thermodynamics states that the total entropy of a system and its surroundings always increases for a spontaneous process. At first glance, this law appears
to contradict much common experience, particularly about biological systems. Many biological processes, such as the generation of a well-defined
structure such as a leaf from carbon dioxide gas and other nutrients, clearly
increase the level of order and hence decrease entropy. Entropy may be decreased locally in the formation of such ordered structures only if the entropy
of other parts of the universe is increased by an equal or greater amount.
An example may help clarify the application of the laws of thermodynamics to a chemical system. Consider a container with 2 moles of hydrogen gas on one side of a divider and 1 mole of oxygen gas on the other (Figure
1.12). If the divider is removed, the gases will intermingle spontaneously to
form a uniform mixture. The process of mixing increases entropy as an ordered arrangement is replaced by a randomly distributed mixture.
Other processes within this system can decrease the entropy locally while
increasing the entropy of the universe. A spark applied to the mixture initiates
a chemical reaction in which hydrogen and oxygen combine to form water:
2 H2  O2 88n 2 H2O
If the temperature of the system is held constant, the entropy of the system
decreases because 3 moles of two differing reactants have been combined to
form 2 moles of a single product. The gas now consists of a uniform set of
indistinguishable molecules. However, the reaction releases a significant
amount of heat into the surroundings, and this heat will increase the entropy of the surrounding molecules by increasing their random movement.

increase in entropy.

form water, the entropy of the system is reduced, but the entropy of the
universe is increased owing to the release of heat to the surroundings.

The entropy increase in the surroundings is enough to allow water to form
spontaneously from hydrogen and oxygen (Figure 1.13).
The change in the entropy of the surroundings will be proportional to
the amount of heat transferred from the system and inversely proportional
to the temperature of the surroundings, because an input of heat leads to a
greater increase in entropy at lower temperatures than at higher temperatures. In biological systems, T [in kelvin (K), absolute temperature] is assumed to be constant. If we define the heat content of a system as enthalpy
(H), then we can express the relation linking the entropy (S) of the surroundings to the transferred heat and temperature as a simple equation:
Ssurroundings  HsystemT

(1)

The total entropy change is given by the expression
Stotal  Ssystem  Ssurroundings

(2)

Substituting equation 1 into equation 2 yields
Stotal  Ssystem  HsystemT

(3)

Multiplying by T gives
TStotal  Hsystem  TSsystem

(4)

The function TS has units of energy and is referred to as free energy or
Gibbs free energy, after Josiah Willard Gibbs, who developed this function
in 1878:
G  Hsystem  TSsystem

(5)

The free-energy change, G, will be used throughout this book to describe
the energetics of biochemical reactions.
Recall that the Second Law of Thermodynamics states that, for a reaction to be spontaneous, the entropy of the universe must increase. Examination of equation 3 shows that the total entropy will increase if and only if
Ssystem  Hsystem /T

(6)

Rearranging gives TSsystem  H, or entropy will increase if and only if
G  Hsystem  TSsystem  0

(7)

In other words, the free-energy change must be negative for a reaction to be
spontaneous. A negative free-energy change occurs with an increase in the
overall entropy of the universe. Thus, we need to consider only one term,
the free energy of the system, to decide whether a reaction can occur spontaneously; any effects of the changes within the system on the rest of the
universe are automatically taken into account.

FIGURE 1.14 Protein folding. Protein
folding entails the transition from a
disordered mixture of unfolded molecules
to a relatively uniform solution of folded
protein molecules.

1.3.4 Protein Folding Can Be Understood in Terms
of Free-Energy Changes
The problem of protein folding illustrates the utility of the concept of free
energy. Consider a system consisting of a solution of unfolded protein molecules in aqueous solution (Figure 1.14). Each unfolded protein molecule
can adopt a unique conformation, so the system is quite disordered and the
entropy of the collection of molecules is relatively high. Yet, protein folding
proceeds spontaneously under appropriate conditions. Thus, entropy must
be increasing elsewhere in the system or in the surroundings. How can we
reconcile the apparent contradiction that proteins spontaneously assume an
ordered structure, and yet entropy increases? The entropy decrease in the
system on folding is not as large as it appears to be, because of the properties of water. Molecules in aqueous solution interact with water molecules
through the formation of hydrogen and ionic interactions. However, some
molecules (termed nonpolar molecules) cannot participate in hydrogen or ionic
interactions. The interactions of nonpolar molecules with water are not as favorable as are interactions between the water molecules themselves. The water molecules in contact with these nonpolar surfaces form “cages” around
the nonpolar molecule, becoming more well ordered (and, hence, lower in
entropy) than water molecules free in solution. As two such nonpolar molecules come together, some of the water molecules are released, and so they
can interact freely with bulk water (Figure 1.15). Hence, nonpolar molecules
have a tendency to aggregate in water because the entropy of the water is increased through the release of water molecules. This phenomenon, termed
the hydrophobic effect, helps promote many biochemical processes.
How does the hydrophobic effect favor protein folding? Some of the
amino acids that make up proteins have nonpolar groups. These nonpolar
amino acids have a strong tendency to associate with one another inside the
interior of the folded protein. The increased entropy of water resulting from
the interaction of these hydrophobic amino acids helps to compensate for
the entropy losses inherent in the folding process.
Hydrophobic interactions are not the only means of stabilizing protein
structure. Many weak bonds, including hydrogen bonds and van der Waals
interactions, are formed in the protein-folding process, and heat is released
into the surroundings as a consequence. Although these interactions replace
interactions with water that take place in the unfolded protein, the net result is the release of heat to the surroundings and thus a negative (favorable)
change in enthalpy for the system.
The folding process can occur when the combination of the entropy associated with the hydrophobic effect and the enthalpy change associated
with hydrogen bonds and van der Waals interactions makes the overall free
energy negative.

1.4 BIOCHEMISTRY AND HUMAN BIOLOGY
Our understanding of biochemistry has had and will continue to have extensive effects on many aspects of human endeavor. First, biochemistry is an
intrinsically beautiful and fascinating body of knowledge. We now know the
essence and many of the details of the most fundamental processes in biochemistry, such as how a single molecule of DNA replicates to generate two
identical copies of itself and how the sequence of bases in a DNA molecule
determines the sequence of amino acids in an encoded protein. Our ability
to describe these processes in detailed, mechanistic terms places a firm chemical foundation under other biological sciences. Moreover, the realization that
we can understand essential life processes, such as the transmission of hereditary information, as chemical structures and their reactions has significant
philosophical implications. What does it mean, biochemically, to be human?
What are the biochemical differences between a human being, a chimpanzee,
a mouse, and a fruit fly? Are we more similar than we are different?
Second, biochemistry is greatly influencing medicine and other fields. The
molecular lesions causing sickle-cell anemia, cystic fibrosis, hemophilia, and
many other genetic diseases have been elucidated at the biochemical level.
Some of the molecular events that contribute to cancer development have
been identified. An understanding of the underlying defects opens the door
to the discovery of effective therapies. Biochemistry makes possible the rational design of new drugs, including specific inhibitors of enzymes required
for the replication of viruses such as human immunodeficiency virus (HIV).
Genetically engineered bacteria or other organisms can be used as “factories” to produce valuable proteins such as insulin and stimulators of bloodcell development. Biochemistry is also contributing richly to clinical diagnostics. For example, elevated levels of telltale enzymes in the blood reveal
whether a patient has recently had a myocardial infarction (heart attack).
DNA probes are coming into play in the precise diagnosis of inherited disorders, infectious diseases, and cancers. Agriculture, too, is benefiting from
advances in biochemistry with the development of more effective, environmentally safer herbicides and pesticides and the creation of genetically engineered plants that are, for example, more resistant to insects. All of these
endeavors are being accelerated by the advances in genomic sequencing.
Third, advances in biochemistry are enabling researchers to tackle some of
the most exciting questions in biology and medicine. How does a fertilized egg
give rise to cells as different as those in muscle, brain, and liver? How do
the senses work? What are the molecular bases for mental disorders such as
Alzheimer disease and schizophrenia? How does the immune system distinguish between self and nonself? What are the molecular mechanisms of
short-term and long-term memory? The answers to such questions, which
once seemed remote, have been partly uncovered and are likely to be more
thoroughly revealed in the near future.
Because all living organisms on Earth are linked by a common origin,
evolution provides a powerful organizing theme for biochemistry. This book
is organized to emphasize the unifying principles revealed by evolutionary
considerations. We begin in the next chapter with a brief tour along a plausible evolutionary path from the formation of some of the chemicals that we
now associate with living organisms through the evolution of the processes
essential for the development of complex, multicellular organisms. The remainder of Part I of the book more fully introduces the most important
classes of biochemicals as well as catalysis and regulation. Part II, Transducing and Storing Energy, describes how energy from chemicals or from
sunlight is converted into usable forms and how this conversion is regulated.
As we will see, a small set of molecules such as adenosine triphosphate

(ATP) act as energy currencies that allow energy, however captured, to be
utilized in a variety of biochemical processes. This part of the text examines the important pathways for the conversion of environmental energy
into molecules such as ATP and uncovers many unifying principles. Part
III, Synthesizing the Molecules of Life, illustrates the use of the molecules
discussed in Part II to synthesize key molecular building blocks, such as the
bases of DNA and amino acids, and then shows how these precursors are
assembled into DNA, RNA, and proteins. In Parts II and III, we will highlight the relation between the reactions within each pathway and between
those in different pathways so as to suggest how these individual reactions
may have combined early in evolutionary history to produce the necessary
molecules. From the student’s perspective, the existence of features common to several pathways enables material mastered in one context to be
readily applied to new contexts. Part IV, Responding to Environmental
Changes, explores some of the mechanisms that cells and multicellular organisms have evolved to detect and respond to changes in the environment.
The topics range from general mechanisms, common to all organisms, for
regulating the expression of genes to the sensory systems used by human
beings and other complex organisms. In many cases, we can now see how
these elaborate systems evolved from pathways that existed earlier in evolutionary history. Many of the sections in Part IV link biochemistry with
other fields such as cell biology, immunology, and neuroscience. We are now
ready to begin our journey into biochemistry with events that took place
more than 3 billion years ago.

AP P E N D IX: D E P I CTI N G M O LEC U L AR STR U CTU R ES
The authors of a biochemistry text face the problem of trying to
present three-dimensional molecules in the two dimensions
available on the printed page. The interplay between the threedimensional structures of biomolecules and their biological
functions will be discussed extensively throughout this book.
Toward this end, we will frequently use representations that, although of necessity are rendered in two dimensions, emphasize
the three-dimensional structures of molecules.
Stereochemical Renderings
Most of the chemical formulas in this text are drawn to depict
the geometric arrangement of atoms, crucial to chemical bonding and reactivity, as accurately as possible. For example, the carbon atom of methane is sp3 hybridized and tetrahedral, with

To illustrate the correct stereochemistry about carbon atoms,

plane. A dashed wedge, with the broad end of the bond at the carbon represents a bond going away from the viewer into the plane
of the page. The remaining two bonds are depicted as straight lines.

In a Fischer projection, the bonds to the central carbon are
represented by horizontal and vertical lines from the substituent atoms to the carbon atom, which is assumed to be at
the center of the cross. By convention, the horizontal bonds are
assumed to project out of the page toward the viewer, whereas
the vertical bonds are assumed to project into the page away
from the viewer. Appendix xx at the back of the book is a structural glossary of the key molecules in biochemistry, presented
both as stereochemically accurate structures and as Fisher
projections.
For depicting molecular architecture in more detail, five
types of models will be used: space filling, ball and stick, skeletal, ribbon, and surface representations (Figure 1.16). The first
three types show structures at the atomic level.

1. Space-filling models. The space-filling models are the most
realistic. The size and position of an atom in a space-filling model
are determined by its bonding properties and van der Waals radius, or contact distance (Section 1.3.1). A van der Waals radius
describes how closely two atoms can approach each other when
they are not linked by a covalent bond. The colors of the model
are set by convention.

Oxygen, red

Hydrogen, white

Phosphorus, purple

alistic as space-filling models, because the atoms are depicted
as spheres of radii smaller than their van der Waals radii. However, the bonding arrangement is easier to see because the
bonds are explicitly represented as sticks. In an illustration, the
taper of a stick, representing parallax, tells which of a pair of
bonded atoms is closer to the reader. A ball-and-stick model
reveals a complex structure more clearly than a space-filling
model does.

3. Skeletal models. An even simpler image is achieved with a skeletal model, which shows only the molecular framework. In skeletal
models, atoms are not shown explicitly. Rather, their positions are
implied by the junctions and ends of bonds. Skeletal models are
frequently used to depict larger, more complex structures.
As biochemistry has advanced, more attention has been focused on the structures of biological macromolecules and their
complexes. These structures comprise thousands or even tens of
thousands of atoms. Although these structures can be depicted
at the atomic level, it is difficult to discern the relevant structural
features because of the large number of atoms. Thus, more
schematic representations—ribbon diagrams and surface representations—have been developed for the depiction of macromolecular structures in which atoms are not shown explicitly
(Figure 1.18).
4. Ribbon diagrams. These diagrams are highly schematic and
most commonly used to accent a few dramatic aspects of protein
structure, such as the  helix (a coiled ribbon), the  strand (a
broad arrow), and loops (simple lines), so as to provide simple
and clear views of the folding patterns of proteins.
5. Surface representations. Often, the interactions between
macromolecules take place exclusively at their surfaces. Surface
representations have been developed to better visualize macromolecular surfaces. These representations display the overall
shapes of macromolecules and can be shaded or colored to indicate particular features such as surface topography or the distribution of electric charges.

CHAPTER 2

Biochemical Evolution

Natural selection, one of the key forces powering evolution, opens an array of
improbable ecological niches to species that can adapt biochemically. (Left) Salt
pools, where the salt concentration can be greater than 1.5 M, would seem to be highly
inhospitable environments for life. Yet certain halophilic archaea, such as Haloferax
mediteranei (right), possess biochemical adaptations that enable them to thrive under these
harsh conditions. [(Left) Kaj R. Svensson/Science Photo Library/Photo Researchers; (right) Wanner/Eye
of Science/Photo Researchers.]

Earth is approximately 4.5 billion years old. Remarkably, there is convincing fossil evidence that organisms morphologically (and very probably biochemically) resembling certain modern bacteria were in existence 3.5 billion years ago. With the use of the results of directed studies and accidental
discoveries, it is now possible to construct a hypothetical yet plausible evolutionary path from the prebiotic world to the present. A number of uncertainties remain, particularly with regard to the earliest events. Nonetheless,
a consideration of the steps along this path and the biochemical problems
that had to be solved provides a useful perspective from which to regard the
processes found in modern organisms. These evolutionary connections make
many aspects of biochemistry easier to understand.
We can think of the path leading to modern living

other key substances from simpler molecules. With the development of
energy-conversion processes and biosynthetic pathways, a wide variety of
unicellular organisms evolved. The fourth stage was the evolution of mechanisms that allowed cells to adjust their biochemistry to different, and often changing, environments. Organisms with these capabilities could form
colonies comprising groups of interacting cells, and some eventually evolved
into complex multicellular organisms.
This chapter introduces key challenges posed in the evolution of life,
whose solutions are elaborated in later chapters. Exploring a possible evolutionary origin for these fundamental processes makes their use, in contrast with that of potential alternatives, more understandable.

Approximately 1 billion years after Earth’s formation, life appeared, as already mentioned. Before life could exist, though, another major process
needed to have taken place—the synthesis of the organic molecules required
for living systems from simpler molecules found in the environment. The
components of nucleic acids and proteins are relatively complex organic
molecules, and one might expect that only sophisticated synthetic routes
could produce them. However, this requirement appears not to have been
the case. How did the building blocks of life come to be?

organic compounds such as amino acids.

2.1.1 Many Components of Biochemical Macromolecules
Can Be Produced in Simple, Prebiotic Reactions
Among several competing theories about the conditions of the prebiotic
world, none is completely satisfactory or problem-free. One theory holds
that Earth’s early atmosphere was highly reduced, rich in methane (CH4),
ammonia (NH3), water (H2O), and hydrogen (H2), and that this atmosphere was subjected to large amounts of solar radiation and lightning.
For the sake of argument, we will assume that these conditions were indeed
those of prebiotic Earth. Can complex organic molecules be synthesized
under these conditions? In the 1950s, Stanley Miller and Harold Urey set
out to answer this question. An electric discharge, simulating lightning,
was passed through a mixture of methane, ammonia, water, and hydrogen
(Figure 2.1). Remarkably, these experiments yielded a highly nonrandom
mixture of organic compounds, including amino acids and other substances
fundamental to biochemistry. The procedure produces the amino acids
glycine and alanine in approximately 2% yield, depending on the amount of
carbon supplied as methane. More complex amino acids such as glutamic
acid and leucine are produced in smaller amounts (Figure 2.2). Hydrogen
cyanide (HCN), another likely component of the early atmosphere, will con–

dense on exposure to heat or light to produce adenine, one of the four nucleic acid bases (Figure 2.3). Other simple molecules combine to form the
remaining bases. A wide array of sugars, including ribose, can be formed
from formaldehyde under prebiotic conditions.
2.1.2 Uncertainties Obscure the Origins of Some
Key Biomolecules
The preceding observations suggest that many of the building blocks found
in biology are unusually easy to synthesize and that significant amounts
could have accumulated through the action of nonbiological processes.
However, it is important to keep in mind that there are many uncertainties.
For instance, ribose is just one of many sugars formed under prebiotic conditions. In addition, ribose is rather unstable under possible prebiotic conditions. Futhermore, ribose occurs in two mirror-image forms, only one of
which occurs in modern RNA. To circumvent those problems, the first nucleic acid-like molecules have been suggested to have been bases attached
to a different backbone and only later in evolutionary time was ribose incorporated to form nucleic acids as we know them today. Despite these uncertainties, an assortment of prebiotic molecules did arise in some fashion,
and from this assortment those with properties favorable for the processes that
we now associate with life began to interact and to form more complicated compounds. The processes through which modern organisms synthesize molecular building blocks will be discussed in Chapters 24, 25, and 26.

2.2 EVOLUTION REQUIRES REPRODUCTION, VARIATION,
AND SELECTIVE PRESSURE
Once the necessary building blocks were available, how did a living system
arise and evolve? Before the appearance of life, simple molecular systems
must have existed that subsequently evolved into the complex chemical systems that are characteristic of organisms. To address how this evolution occurred, we need to consider the process of evolution. There are several basic
principles common to evolving systems, whether they are simple collections
of molecules or competing populations of organisms. First, the most fundamental property of evolving systems is their ability to replicate or reproduce.
Without this ability of reproduction, each “species” of molecule that might
appear is doomed to extinction as soon as all its individual molecules degrade. For example, individual molecules of biological polymers such as ribonucleic acid are degraded by hydrolysis reactions and other processes.
However, molecules that can replicate will continue to be represented in the
population even if the lifetime of each individual molecule remains short.

CHAPTER 2 • Biochemical Evolution

Page 22

A second principle fundamental to evolution is variation. The replicating systems must undergo changes. After all, if a system always replicates
perfectly, the replicated molecule will always be the same as the parent molecule. Evolution cannot occur. The nature of these variations in living systems are considered in Section 2.2.5.
A third basic principle of evolution is competition. Replicating molecules
compete with one another for available resources such as chemical precursors, and the competition allows the process of evolution by natural selection
to occur. Variation will produce differing populations of molecules. Some
variant offspring may, by chance, be better suited for survival and replication under the prevailing conditions than are their parent molecules. The
prevailing conditions exert a selective pressure that gives an advantage to one
of the variants. Those molecules that are best able to survive and to replicate themselves will increase in relative concentration. Thus, new molecules
arise that are better able to replicate under the conditions of their environment. The same principles hold true for modern organisms. Organisms reproduce, show variation among individual organisms, and compete for resources; those variants with a selective advantage will reproduce more
successfully. The changes leading to variation still take place at the molecular level, but the selective advantage is manifest at the organismal level.
2.2.1 The Principles of Evolution Can Be Demonstrated in Vitro

Relative population

Is there any evidence that evolution can take place at the molecular level?
In 1967, Sol Spiegelman showed that replicating molecules could evolve new
forms in an experiment that allowed him to observe molecular evolution in
the test tube. He used as his evolving molecules RNA molecules derived
from a bacterial virus called bacteriophage Q. The genome of bacteriophage Q, a single RNA strand of approximately 3300 bases, depends for
its replication on the activity of a protein complex termed Q replicase.
Spiegelman mixed the replicase with a starting population of Q RNA molecules. Under conditions in which there are ample amounts of precursors,
no time constraints, and no other selective pressures, the composition of the
population does not change from that of the parent molecules on replication.
When selective pressures are applied, however, the composition of the population of molecules can change dramatically. For example, decreasing the
time available for replication from 20 minutes to 5 minutes yielded, incrementally over 75 generations, a population of molecules dominated by a single species comprising only 550 bases. This species is replicated 15 times as
rapidly as the parental Q RNA (Figure 2.4). Spiegelman applied other selective pressures by, for example, limiting the concentrations of precursors or adding compounds that inhibit the
replication process. In each case, new species appeared that
Qβ

replicated more effectively under the conditions imposed.
550 bases
The process of evolution demonstrated in these studies depended on the existence of machinery for the replication of RNA fragments in the form of the Q replicase.
As noted in Chapter 1, one of the most elegant characteristics of nucleic acids is that the mechanism for their
replication follows naturally from their molecular struc0

Requirements of Evolution

2.2.2 RNA Molecules Can Act As Catalysts
The development of capabilities beyond simple replication required the
generation of specific catalysts. A catalyst is a molecule that accelerates a
particular chemical reaction without itself being chemically altered in the
process. The properties of catalysts will be discussed in detail in Chapters
8 and 9. Some catalysts are highly specific; they promote certain reactions
without substantially affecting closely related processes. Such catalysts allow the reactions of specific pathways to take place in preference to those
of potential alternative pathways. Until the 1980s, all biological catalysts,
termed enzymes, were believed to be proteins. Then, Tom Cech and Sidney
Altman independently discovered that certain RNA molecules can be effective catalysts. These RNA catalysts have come to be known as ribozymes.
The discovery of ribozymes suggested the possibility that catalytic RNA
molecules could have played fundamental roles early in the evolution of life.
The catalytic ability of RNA molecules is related to their ability to adopt
specific yet complex structures. This principle is illustrated by a “hammerhead” ribozyme, an RNA structure first identified in plant viruses
(Figure 2.5). This RNA molecule promotes the cleavage of specific RNA
molecules at specific sites; this cleavage is necessary for certain aspects of
the viral life cycle. The ribozyme, which requires mg2+ ion or other ions for
the cleavage step to take place, forms a complex with its substrate RNA
molecule that can adopt a reactive conformation.
The existence of RNA molecules that possess specific binding and
catalytic properties makes plausible the idea of an early “RNA world”
inhabited by life forms dependent on RNA molecules to play all major roles,
including those important in heredity, the storage of information, and the
promotion of specific reactions—that is, biosynthesis and energy metabolism.

2.2.3 Amino Acids and Their Polymers Can Play Biosynthetic
and Catalytic Roles
In the early RNA world, the increasing populations of replicating RNA molecules would have consumed the building blocks of RNA that had been generated over long periods of time by prebiotic reactions. A shortage of these
compounds would have favored the evolution of alternative mechanisms

for their synthesis. A large number of pathways are possible. Examining the
biosynthetic routes utilized by modern organisms can be a source of insight
into which pathways survived. A striking observation is that simple amino
acids are used as building blocks for the RNA bases (Figure 2.6). For both
purines (adenine and guanine) and pyrimidines (uracil and cytosine), an
amino acid serves as a core onto which the remainder of the base is elaborated. In addition, nitrogen atoms are donated by the amino group of the
amino acid aspartic acid and by the amide group of the glutamine side chain.
Amino acids are chemically more versatile than nucleic acids because
their side chains carry a wider range of chemical functionality. Thus, amino
acids or short polymers of amino acids linked by peptide bonds, called
polypeptides (Figure 2.7), may have functioned as components of ribozymes
to provide a specific reactivity. Furthermore, longer polypeptides are capable of spontaneously folding to form well-defined three-dimensional structures, dictated by the sequence of amino acids along their polypeptide
chains. The ability of polypeptides to fold spontaneously into elaborate
structures, which permit highly specific chemical interactions with other
molecules, may have favored the expansion of their roles in the course of
evolution and is crucial to their dominant position in modern organisms.
Today, most biological catalysts (enzymes) are not nucleic acids but are instead large polypeptides called proteins.
2.2.4 RNA Template-Directed Polypeptide Synthesis Links the
RNA and Protein Worlds
Polypeptides would have played only a limited role early in the evolution
of life because their structures are not suited to self-replication in the way
that nucleic acid structures are. However, polypeptides could have been included in evolutionary processes indirectly. For example, if the properties
of a particular polypeptide favored the survival and replication of a class of
RNA molecules, then these RNA molecules could have evolved ribozyme
activities that promoted the synthesis of that polypeptide. This method of
producing polypeptides with specific amino acid sequences has several limitations. First, it seems likely that only relatively short specific polypeptides
could have been produced in this manner. Second, it would have been difficult to accurately link the particular amino acids in the polypeptide in a
reproducible manner. Finally, a different ribozyme would have been required for each polypeptide. A critical point in evolution was reached when

The growing polypeptide chain remains attached to an adaptor RNA until the completion

an apparatus for polypeptide synthesis developed that allowed the sequence
of bases in an RNA molecule to directly dictate the sequence of amino acids in
a polypeptide. A code evolved that established a relation between a specific
sequence of three bases in RNA and an amino acid. We now call this set of
three-base combinations, each encoding an amino acid, the genetic code. A
decoding, or translation, system exists today as the ribosome and associated
factors that are responsible for essentially all polypeptide synthesis from
RNA templates in modern organisms. The essence of this mode of polypeptide synthesis is illustrated in Figure 2.8.
An RNA molecule (messenger RNA, or mRNA), containing in its base
sequence the information that specifies a particular protein, acts as a template to direct the synthesis of the polypeptide. Each amino acid is brought
to the template attached to an adapter molecule specific to that amino acid.
These adapters are specialized RNA molecules (called transfer RNAs or
tRNAs). After initiation of the polypeptide chain, a tRNA molecule with
its associated amino acid binds to the template through specific WatsonCrick base-pairing interactions. Two such molecules bind to the ribosome
and peptide-bond formation is catalyzed by an RNA component (called
ribosomal RNA or rRNA) of the ribosome. The first RNA departs (with
neither the polypeptide chain nor an amino acid attached) and another
tRNA with its associated amino acid bonds to the ribosome. The growing
polypeptide chain is transferred to this newly bound amino acid with the
formation of a new peptide bond. This cycle then repeats itself. This scheme
allows the sequence of the RNA template to encode the sequence of the
polypeptide and thereby makes possible the production of long polypeptides with specified sequences. The mechanism of protein synthesis will be
discussed in Chapter 29. Importantly, the ribosome is composed largely of
RNA and is a highly sophisticated ribozyme, suggesting that it might be a
surviving relic of the RNA world.
2.2.5 The Genetic Code Elucidates the Mechanisms of Evolution
The sequence of bases that encodes a functional protein molecule is called
a gene. The genetic code—that is, the relation between the base sequence of
a gene and the amino acid sequence of the polypeptide whose synthesis the
gene directs—applies to all modern organisms with only very minor exceptions. This universality reveals that the genetic code was fixed early in the
course of evolution and has been maintained to the present day.
We can now examine the mechanisms of evolution. Earlier, we considered how variation is required for evolution. We can now see that such variations in living systems are changes that alter the meaning of the genetic
message. These variations are called mutations. A mutation can be as simple as a change in a single nucleotide (called a point mutation), such that a

sequence of bases that encoded a particular amino acid may now encode
another (Figure 2.9A). A mutation can also be the insertion or deletion of
several nucleotides.
Other types of alteration permit the more rapid evolution of new biochemical activities. For instance, entire sections of the coding material can
be duplicated, a process called gene duplication (Figure 2.9B). One of the
duplication products may accumulate mutations and eventually evolve into
a gene with a different, but related, function. Furthermore, parts of a gene
may be duplicated and added to parts of another to give rise to a completely
new gene, which encodes a protein with properties associated with each parent gene. Higher organisms contain many large families of enzymes and
other macromolecules that are clearly related to one another in the same
manner. Thus, gene duplication followed by specialization has been a
crucial process in evolution. It allows the generation of macromolecules
having particular functions without the need to start from scratch. The
accumulation of genes with subtle and large differences allows for the generation of more complex biochemical processes and pathways and thus
more complex organisms.

2.2.6 Transfer RNAs Illustrate Evolution by Gene Duplication
Transfer RNA molecules are the adaptors that associate an amino acid with
its correct base sequence. Transfer RNA molecules are structurally similar
to one another: each adopts a three-dimensional cloverleaf pattern of basepaired groups (Figure 2.10). Subtle differences in structure enable the
protein-synthesis machinery to distinguish transfer RNA molecules with
different amino acid specificities.
This family of related RNA molecules likely was generated by gene duplication followed by specialization. A nucleic acid sequence encoding one
member of the family was duplicated, and the two copies evolved independently to generate molecules with specificities for different amino acids.
This process was repeated, starting from one primordial transfer RNA gene
until the 20 (or more) distinct members of the transfer RNA family present in modern organisms arose.
2.2.7 DNA Is a Stable Storage Form for Genetic Information

FIGURE 2.10 Cloverleaf pattern of
tRNA. The pattern of base-pairing
interactions observed for all transfer RNA
molecules reveals that these molecules
had a common evolutionary origin.

It is plausible that RNA was utilized to store genetic information early in
the history of life. However, in modern organisms (with the exception of
some viruses), the RNA derivative DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid) performs
this function (Sections 1.1.1 and 1.1.3). The 2-hydroxyl group in the

ribose unit of the RNA backbone is replaced by a hydrogen atom in DNA
(Figure 2.11).
What is the selective advantage of DNA over RNA as the genetic material? The genetic material must be extremely stable so that sequence information can be passed on from generation to generation without degradation. RNA itself is a remarkably stable molecule; negative charges in the
sugar-phosphate backbone protect it from attack by hydroxide ions that
would lead to hydrolytic cleavage. However, the 2-hydroxyl group makes
the RNA susceptible to base-catalyzed hydrolysis. The removal of the 2hydroxyl group from the ribose decreases the rate of hydrolysis by approximately 100-fold under neutral conditions and perhaps even more under extreme conditions. Thus, the conversion of the genetic material from RNA
into DNA would have substantially increased its chemical stability.
The evolutionary transition from RNA to DNA is recapitulated in the
biosynthesis of DNA in modern organisms. In all cases, the building blocks
used in the synthesis of DNA are synthesized from the corresponding building blocks of RNA by the action of enzymes termed ribonucleotide reductases. These enzymes convert ribonucleotides (a base and phosphate groups
linked to a ribose sugar) into deoxyribonucleotides (a base and phosphates
linked to deoxyribose sugar).

RNA contains uracil, DNA contains a methylated uracil derivative termed

27, the methyl group present in thymine facilitates the repair of damaged
DNA, providing an additional selective advantage.
Although DNA replaced RNA in the role of storing the genetic information, RNA maintained many of its other functions. RNA still provides
the template that directs polypeptide synthesis, the adaptor molecules,
the catalytic activity of the ribosomes, and other functions. Thus, the genetic
message is transcribed from DNA into RNA and then translated into protein.

2.3 ENERGY TRANSFORMATIONS ARE NECESSARY TO
SUSTAIN LIVING SYSTEMS
Most of the reactions that lead to the biosynthesis of nucleic acids and other
biomolecules are not thermodynamically favorable under most conditions;
they require an input of energy to proceed. Thus, they can proceed only
if they are coupled to processes that release energy. How can energyrequiring and energy-releasing reactions be linked? How is energy from the
environment transformed into a form that living systems can use? Answering these questions fundamental to biochemistry is the objective of much
of this book.
2.3.1 ATP, a Common Currency for Biochemical Energy, Can Be
Generated Through the Breakdown of Organic Molecules
Just as most economies simplify trade by using currency rather than bartering, biochemical systems have evolved common currencies for the exchange of energy. The most important of these currencies are molecules related to adenosine triphosphate (ATP) that contain an array of three linked
phosphates (Figure 2.12). The bonds linking the phosphates persist in solution under a variety of conditions, but, when they are broken, an unusually large amount of energy is released that can be used to promote other
processes. The roles of ATP and its use in driving other processes will be
presented in detail in Chapter 14 and within many other chapters throughout this book.

ATP

ATP must be generated in appropriate quantities to be available for such
reactions. The energy necessary for the synthesis of ATP can be obtained
by the breakdown of other chemicals. Specific enzymes have evolved to couple these degradative processes to the phosphorylation of adenosine diphosphate (ADP) to yield ATP. Amino acids such as glycine, which were probably present in relatively large quantities in the prebiotic world and early in
evolution, were likely sources of energy for ATP generation. The degradation of glycine to acetic acid may be an ATP-generation system that functioned early in evolution (Figure 2.13). In this reaction, the carbon–
nitrogen bond in glycine is cleaved by reduction (the addition of electrons),
and the energy released from the cleavage of this bond drives the coupling
of ADP and orthophosphate (Pi) to produce ATP.
Amino acids are still broken down to produce ATP in modern organisms. However, sugars such as glucose are a more commonly utilized energy source because they are more readily metabolized and can be stored.
The most important process for the direct synthesis of ATP in modern organisms is glycolysis, a complex process that derives energy from glucose.

2.3.2 Cells Were Formed by the Inclusion of Nucleic Acids
Within Membranes
Modern organisms are made up of cells. A cell is composed of nucleic acids, proteins, and other biochemicals surrounded by a membrane built from lipids. These
membranes completely enclose their contents, and so cells have a defined
inside and outside. A typical membrane-forming lipid is phosphatidyl choline.

FIGURE 2.14 Schematic view of a lipid
bilayer. These structures define the
boundaries of cells.

The most important feature of membrane-forming molecules such as
phosphatidyl choline is that they are amphipathic—that is, they contain both
hydrophilic (water-loving) and hydrophobic (water-avoiding) components.
Membrane-forming molecules consist of fatty acids, whose long alkyl
groups are hydrophobic, connected to shorter hydrophilic “head groups.”
When such lipids are in contact with water, they spontaneously aggregate
to form specific structures such that the hydrophobic parts of the molecules
are packed together away from water, whereas the hydrophilic parts are exposed to the aqueous solution. The structure that is important for membrane formation is the lipid bilayer (Figure 2.14). A bilayer is formed from
two layers of lipids arranged such that the fatty acid tails of each layer interact with each other to form a hydrophobic interior while the hydrophilic
head groups interact with the aqueous solution on each side. Such bilayer
structures can fold onto themselves to form hollow spheres having interior
compartments filled with water. The hydrophobic interior of the bilayer
serves as a barrier between two aqueous phases. If such structures are
formed in the presence of other molecules such as nucleic acids and proteins, these molecules can become trapped inside, thus forming cell-like
structures. The structures of lipids and lipid bilayers will be considered in
detail in Chapter 12.
At some stage in evolution, sufficient quantities of appropriate amphipathic molecules must have accumulated from biosynthetic or other
processes to allow some nucleic acids to become entrapped and cell-like organisms to form. Such compartmentalization has many advantages. When
the components of a cell are enclosed in a membrane, the products of enzymatic reactions do not simply diffuse away into the environment but instead are contained where they can be used by the cell that produced them.
The containment is aided by the fact that nearly all biosynthetic intermediates and other biochemicals include one or more charged groups such as
phosphates or carboxylates. Unlike more nonpolar or neutral molecules,
charged molecules do not readily pass through lipid membranes.
2.3.3 Compartmentalization Required the Development
of Ion Pumps

Osmosis—
The movement of a solvent across a
membrane in the direction that tends
to equalize concentrations of solute on
the two sides of the membrane.

Despite its many advantages, the enclosure of nucleic acids and proteins
within membranes introduced several complications. Perhaps the most significant were the effects of osmosis. Membranes are somewhat permeable to
water and small nonpolar molecules, whereas they are impermeable to
macromolecules such as nucleic acids. When macromolecules are concentrated inside a compartment surrounded by such a semipermeable membrane, osmotic forces drive water through the membrane into the compartment. Without counterbalancing effects, the flow of water will burst the cell
(Figure 2.15).

FIGURE 2.15 The “osmotic crisis.”
H 2O

H 2O

Modern cells have two distinct mechanisms for resisting these osmotic
forces. One mechanism is to toughen the cell membrane by the introduction of an additional structure such as a cell wall. However, such a chemically elaborate structure may not have evolved quickly, especially because
it must completely surround a cell to be effective. The other mechanism is
the use of energy-dependent ion pumps. These pumps can lower the concentration of ions inside a cell relative to the outside, favoring the flow of water molecules from inside to outside. The resulting unequal distribution of
ions across an inherently impermeable membrane is called an ion gradient.
Appropriate ion gradients can balance the osmotic forces and maintain a
cell at a constant volume. Membrane proteins such as ion pumps will be
considered in Chapter 13.
Ion gradients can prevent osmotic crises, but they require energy to be
produced. Most likely, an ATP-driven proton pump was the first existing
component of the machinery for generating an ion gradient (Figure 2.16).
Such pumps, which are found in essentially all modern cells, hydrolyze ATP
to ADP and inorganic phosphate and utilize the energy released to transport
protons from the inside to the outside of a cell. The pump thus establishes a
proton gradient that, in turn, can be coupled to other membrane-transport
processes such as the removal of sodium ions from the cell. The proton gradient and other ion gradients generated from it act together to counteract osmotic effects and prevent the cell from swelling and bursting.

A cell consisting of macromolecules
surrounded by a semipermeable membrane
will take up water from outside the cell
and burst.

2.3.4 Proton Gradients Can Be Used to Drive the
Synthesis of ATP
Enzymes act to accelerate reactions, but they cannot alter the position of
chemical equilibria. An enzyme that accelerates a reaction in the forward
direction must also accelerate the reaction to the same extent in the reverse
direction. Thus, the existence of an enzyme that utilized the hydrolysis of
ATP to generate a proton gradient presented a tremendous opportunity for
the evolution of alternative systems for generating ATP. Such an enzyme
could synthesize ATP by reversing the process that produces the gradient.
Enzymes, now called ATP synthases, do in fact use proton gradients to drive
the bonding of ADP and Pi to form ATP (Figure 2.17). These proteins will
be considered in detail in Chapter 18.
Organisms have evolved a number of elaborate mechanisms for the generation of proton gradients across membranes. An example is photosynthesis, a process first used by bacteria and now also used by plants to harness
the light energy from the sun. The essence of photosynthesis is the lightdriven transfer of an electron across a membrane. The fundamental
processes are illustrated in Figure 2.18.

The photosynthetic apparatus, which is embedded in a membrane, contains pigments that efficiently absorb light from the sun. The absorbed light
provides the energy to promote an electron in the pigment molecule to an
excited state. The high-energy electron can then jump to an appropriate acceptor molecule located in the part of the membrane facing the inside of the
cell. The acceptor molecule, now reduced, binds a proton from a water molecule, generating an hydroxide ion inside the cell. The electronic “hole” left
in the pigment on the outside of the membrane can then be filled by the donation of an electron from a suitable reductant on the outside of the membrane. Because the generation of an hydroxide ion inside the cell is equivalent to the generation of a proton outside the cell, a proton gradient develops
across the membrane. Protons flow down this gradient through ATP synthases to generate ATP.
Photosynthesis is but one of a range of processes in different organisms
that lead to ATP synthesis through the action of proteins evolutionarily related to the primordial ATP-driven pumps. In animals, the degradation of
carbohydrates and other organic compounds is the source of the electron
flow across membranes that can be used to develop proton gradients. The
formation of ATP-generating proton gradients by fuel metabolism will be
considered in Chapter 18 and by light absorption in Chapter 19.
2.3.5 Molecular Oxygen, a Toxic By-Product of Some
Photosynthetic Processes, Can Be Utilized for Metabolic Purposes
As stated earlier, photosynthesis generates electronic “holes” in the photosynthetic apparatus on the outside of the membrane. These holes are powerful oxidizing agents; that is, they have very high affinities for electrons
and can pull electrons from many types of molecules. They can even oxidize water. Thus, for many photosynthetic organisms, the electron donor
that completes the photosynthetic cycle is water. The product of water oxidation is oxygen gas—that is, molecular oxygen (O2).
2 H2O 88n O2  4 e  4 H
The use of water as the electron donor significantly increases the efficiency
of photosynthetic ATP synthesis because the generation of one molecule of
oxygen is accompanied not only by the release of four electrons (e), but

7552dc02_19-40

5/18/01

11:53 AM

Page 33

33

also by the release of four protons on one side of the membrane. Thus, an
additional proton is released for each proton equivalent produced by the initial electron-transfer process, so twice as many protons are available to drive
ATP synthesis. Oxygen generation will be considered in Chapter 19.
Oxygen was present in only small amounts in the atmosphere before organisms evolved that could oxidize water. The “pollution” of the air with
oxygen produced by photosynthetic organisms greatly affected the course
of evolution. Oxygen is quite reactive and thus extremely toxic to many organisms. Many biochemical processes have evolved to protect cells from the
deleterious effects of oxygen and other reactive species that can be generated from this molecule. Subsequently, organisms evolved mechanisms for
taking advantage of the high reactivity of oxygen to promote favorable
processes. Most important among these mechanisms are those for the oxidation of organic compounds such as glucose. Through the action of oxygen, a glucose molecule can be completely converted into carbon dioxide
and water, releasing enough energy to synthesize approximately 30 molecules of ATP.

H

Glucose  6 O2 88n 6 CO2  6 H2O  energy
This number represents a 15-fold increase in ATP yield compared with the
yield from the breakdown of glucose in the absence of oxygen in the process
of glycolysis. This increased efficiency is apparent in everyday life; our muscles exhaust their fuel supply and tire quickly if they do not receive enough
oxygen and are forced to use glycolysis as the sole ATP source. The role of
oxygen in the extraction of energy from organic molecules will be considered in Chapter 18.

2.4 CELLS CAN RESPOND TO CHANGES
IN THEIR ENVIRONMENTS
The environments in which cells grow often change rapidly. For example,
cells may consume all of a particular food source and must utilize others.
To survive in a changing world, cells evolved mechanisms for adjusting their
biochemistry in response to signals indicating environmental change. The
adjustments can take many forms, including changes in the activities of preexisting enzyme molecules, changes in the rates of synthesis of new enzyme
molecules, and changes in membrane-transport processes.
Initially, the detection of environmental signals occurred inside cells.
Chemicals that could pass into cells, either by diffusion through the cell
membrane or by the action of transport proteins, and could bind directly to
proteins inside the cell and modulate their activities. An example is the use
of the sugar arabinose by the bacterium Escherichia coli (Figure 2.19). E.
coli cells are normally unable to use arabinose efficiently as a source of

energy. However, if arabinose is their only source of carbon, E. coli cells
synthesize enzymes that catalyze the conversion of this sugar into useful
forms. This response is mediated by arabinose itself. If present in sufficient
quantity outside the cell, arabinose can enter the cell through transport proteins. Once inside the cell, arabinose binds to a protein called AraC. This
binding alters the structure of AraC so that it can now bind to specific sites
in the bacterial DNA and increase RNA transcription from genes encoding
enzymes that metabolize arabinose. The mechanisms of gene regulation will
be considered in Chapter 31.
Subsequently, mechanisms appeared for detecting signals at the cell surface. Cells could thus respond to signaling molecules even if those molecules did not pass into the cell. Receptor proteins evolved that, embedded
in the membrane, could bind chemicals present in the cellular environment.
Binding produced changes in the protein structure that could be detected
at the inside surface of the cell membrane. By this means, chemicals outside the cell could influence events inside the cell. Many of these signaltransduction pathways make use of substances such as cyclic adenosine
monophosphate (cAMP) and calcium ion as “second messengers” that can
diffuse throughout the cell, spreading the word of environmental change.

2.4.1 Filamentous Structures and Molecular Motors Enable
Intracellular and Cellular Movement

FIGURE 2.20 Bacteria with flagella.
A bacterium (Proteus mirabilis) swims
through the rotation of filamentous
structures called flagella. [Fred E. Hossler/
Visuals Unlimited.]

The development of the ability to move was another important stage in the
evolution of cells capable of adapting to a changing environment. Without
this ability, nonphotosynthetic cells might have starved after consuming the
nutrients available in their immediate vicinity.
Bacteria swim through the use of filamentous structures termed flagella
that extend from their cell membranes (Figure 2.20). Each bacterial cell has
several flagella, which, under appropriate conditions, form rotating bundles
that efficiently propel the cell through the water. These flagella are long
polymers consisting primarily of thousands of identical protein subunits.
At the base of each flagellum are assemblies of proteins that act as motors
to drive its rotation. The rotation of the flagellar motor is driven by the flow
of protons from outside to inside the cell. Thus, energy stored in the form
of a proton gradient is transduced into another form, rotatory motion.
Other mechanisms for motion, also depending on filamentous structures, evolved in other cells. The most important of these structures are microfilaments and microtubules. Microfilaments are polymers of the protein

7552dc02_19-40

Page 35

actin, and microtubules are polymers of two closely related proteins termed
- and -tubulin. Unlike a bacterial flagellum, these filamentous structures
are highly dynamic: they can rapidly increase or decrease in length through
the addition or subtraction of component protein molecules. Microfilaments and microtubules also serve as tracks on which other proteins move,
driven by the hydrolysis of ATP. Cells can change shape through the motion of molecular motor proteins along such filamentous structures that are
changing in shape as a result of dynamic polymerization (Figure 2.21). Coordinated shape changes can be a means of moving a cell across a surface
and are crucial to cell division. The motor proteins are also responsible for
the transport of organelles and other structures within eukaryotic cells. Molecular motors will be considered in Chapter 34.
2.4.2 Some Cells Can Interact to Form Colonies
with Specialized Functions
Early organisms lived exclusively as single cells. Such organisms interacted
with one another only indirectly by competing for resources in their environments. Certain of these organisms, however, developed the ability to
form colonies comprising many interacting cells. In such groups, the environment of a cell is dominated by the presence of surrounding cells, which
may be in direct contact with one another. These cells communicate with
one another by a variety of signaling mechanisms and may respond to signals by altering enzyme activity or levels of gene expression. One result may
be cell differentiation; differentiated cells are genetically identical but have
different properties because their genes are expressed differently.
Several modern organisms are able to switch back and forth from existence as independent single cells to existence as multicellular colonies of differentiated cells. One of the most well characterized is the slime mold Dictyostelium. In favorable environments, this organism lives as individual cells;
under conditions of starvation, however, the cells come together to form a
cell aggregate. This aggregate, sometimes called a slug, can move as a unit
to a potentially more favorable environment where it then forms a multicellular structure, termed a fruiting body, that rises substantially above the
surface on which the cells are growing. Wind may carry cells released from
the top of the fruiting body to sites where the food supply is more plentiful. On arriving in a well-stocked location, the cells grow, reproduce, and
live as individual cells until the food supply is again exhausted (Figure 2.22).
The transition from unicellular to multicellular growth is triggered by
cell–cell communication and reveals much about signaling processes between and within cells. Under starvation conditions, Dictyostelium cells release the signal molecule cyclic AMP. This molecule signals surrounding
cells by binding to a membrane-bound protein receptor on the cell surface.

Cell mobility can be achieved by changes
in cell shape.

mold Dictyostelium. Hundreds of thousands of single cells aggregate to form a

initiates the formation of aggregates in Dictyostelium.

The binding of cAMP molecules to these receptors triggers several responses, including movement in the direction of higher cAMP concentration, as well as the generation and release of additional cAMP molecules
(Figure 2.23).
The cells aggregate by following cAMP gradients. Once in contact, they
exchange additional signals and then differentiate into distinct cell types,
each of which expresses the set of genes appropriate for its eventual role in
forming the fruiting body (Figure 2.24). The life cycles of organisms such
as Dictyostelium foreshadow the evolution of organisms that are multicellular throughout their lifetimes. It is also interesting to note the cAMP signals starvation in many organisms, including human beings.

2.4.3 The Development of Multicellular Organisms Requires
the Orchestrated Differentiation of Cells
The fossil record indicates that macroscopic, multicellular organisms appeared approximately 600 million years ago. Most of the organisms familiar to us consist of many cells. For example, an adult human being contains
approximately 100,000,000,000,000 cells. The cells that make up different
organs are distinct and, even within one organ, many different cell types are
present. Nonetheless, the DNA sequence in each cell is identical. The differences between cell types are the result of differences in how these genes
are expressed.
Each multicellular organism begins as a single cell. For this cell to develop into a complex organism, the embryonic cells must follow an intricate
program of regulated gene expression, cell division, and cell movement. The
developmental program relies substantially on the responses of cells to the
environment created by neighboring cells. Cells in specific positions within
the developing embryo divide to form particular tissues, such as muscle.
Developmental pathways have been extensively studied in a number of organisms, including the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans (Figure 2.25), a
1-mm-long worm containing 959 cells. A detailed map describing the fate
of each cell in C. elegans from the fertilized egg to the adult is shown in
Figure 2.26. Interestingly, proper development requires not only cell division but also the death of specific cells at particular points in time through
a process called programmed cell death or apoptosis.
Investigations of genes and proteins that control development in a wide
range of organisms have revealed a great many common features. Many of
the molecules that control human development are evolutionarily related to
those in relatively simple organisms such as C. elegans. Thus, solutions to
the problem of controlling development in multicellular organisms arose
early in evolution and have been adapted many times in the course of evolution, generating the great diversity of complex organisms.

All organisms on Earth have a common origin (Figure 2.27). How could
complex organisms such as human beings have evolved from the simple organisms that existed at life’s start? The path outlined in this chapter reveals
that most of the fundamental processes of biochemistry were largely fixed
early in the history of life. The complexity of organisms such as human beings is manifest, at a biochemical level, in the interactions between overlapping and competing pathways, which lead to the generation of intricately
connected groups of specialized cells. The evolution of biochemical and
physiological complexity is made possible by the effects of gene duplication
followed by specialization. Paradoxically, the reliance on gene duplication
also makes this complexity easier to comprehend. Consider, for example,
the protein kinases—enzymes that transfer phosphoryl groups from ATP
to specific amino acids in proteins. These enzymes play essential roles in
many signal-transduction pathways and in the control of cell growth and
differentiation. The human genome encodes approximately 500 proteins of
this class; even a relatively simple, unicellular organism such as brewer’s
yeast has more than 100 protein kinases. Yet each of these enzymes is the
evolutionary descendant of a common ancestral enzyme. Thus, we can learn
much about the essential behavior of this large collection of proteins through
studies of a single family member. After the essential behavior is understood,
we can evaluate the specific adaptations that allow each family member to
perform its particular biological functions.
Most central processes in biology have been characterized first in relatively simple organisms, often through a combination of genetic, physiological, and biochemical studies. Many of the processes controlling early

embryonic development were elucidated by the results of studies of the fruit
fly. The events controlling DNA replication and the cell cycle were first deciphered in yeast. Investigators can now test the functions of particular proteins in mammals by disrupting the genes that encode these proteins in mice
and examining the effects. The investigations of organisms linked to us by
common evolutionary pathways are powerful tools for exploring all of biology and for developing new understanding of normal human function and
disease.

Key Organic Molecules Are Used by Living Systems

The evolution of life required a series of transitions, beginning with the
generation of organic molecules that could serve as the building blocks
for complex biomolecules. How these molecules arose is a matter of conjecture, but experiments have established that they could have formed
under hypothesized prebiotic conditions.

• Evolution Requires Reproduction, Variation, and Selective Pressure

The next major transition in the evolution of life was the formation of
replicating molecules. Replication, coupled with variation and selective
pressure, marked the beginning of evolution. Variation was introduced
by a number of means, from simple base substitutions to the duplication of entire genes. RNA appears to have been an early replicating molecule. Furthermore, some RNA molecules possess catalytic activity.
However, the range of reactions that RNA is capable of catalyzing is
limited. With time, the catalytic activity was transferred to proteins—
linear polymers of the chemically versatile amino acids. RNA directed
the synthesis of these proteins and still does in modern organisms
through the development of a genetic code, which relates base sequence
to amino acid sequence. Eventually, RNA lost its role as the gene to the
chemically similar but more stable nucleic acid DNA. In modern organisms, RNA still serves as the link between DNA and protein.

• Energy Transformations Are Necessary to Sustain Living Systems

Another major transition in evolution was the ability to transform environmental energy into forms capable of being used by living systems.
ATP serves as the cellular energy currency that links energy-yielding
reactions with energy-requiring reactions. ATP itself is a product of the
oxidation of fuel molecules, such as amino acids and sugars. With the
evolution of membranes—hydrophobic barriers that delineate the borders of cells—ion gradients were required to prevent osmotic crises.
These gradients were formed at the expense of ATP hydrolysis. Later,
ion gradients generated by light or the oxidation of fuel molecules were
used to synthesize ATP.

•

Cells Can Respond to Changes in Their Environments

The final transition was the evolution of sensing and signaling mechanisms that enabled a cell to respond to changes in its environment. These
signaling mechanisms eventually led to cell–cell communication, which
allowed the development of more-complex organisms. The record of
much of what has occurred since the formation of primitive organisms
is written in the genomes of extant organisms. Knowledge of these
genomes and the mechanisms of evolution will enhance our understanding of the history of life on Earth as well as our understanding of
existing organisms.

2. Following the populations. In an experiment analogous to the

molecules consists of 99 identical molecules, each of which
replicates once in 15 minutes, and 1 molecule that replicates
once in 5 minutes. Estimate the composition of the population
after 1, 10, and 25 “generations” if a generation is defined as 15
minutes of replication. Assume that all necessary components
are readily available.

3. Selective advantage. Suppose that a replicating RNA molecule has a mutation (genotypic change) and the phenotypic result is that it binds nucleotide monomers more tightly than do
other RNA molecules in its population. What might the selective advantage of this mutation be? Under what conditions
would you expect this selective advantage to be most important?
4. Opposite of randomness. Ion gradients prevent osmotic crises,
but they require energy to be produced. Why does the formation of a gradient require an energy input?
5. Coupled gradients. How could a proton gradient with a higher
concentration of protons inside a cell be used to pump ions out
of a cell?
6. Proton counting. Consider the reactions that take place across
a photosynthetic membrane. On one side of the membrane, the
following reaction takes place:
4 e  4 A  4 H2O 88n 4 AH  4 OH
Need extra help? Purchase chapters of the Student Companion with complete solutions online at www.whfreeman.com/
biochem5.

whereas, on the other side of the membrane, the reaction is:
2 H2O 88n O2  4 e  4 H
How many protons are made available to drive ATP synthesis
for each reaction cycle?
7. An alternative pathway. To respond to the availability of sugars such as arabinose, a cell must have at least two types of proteins: a transport protein to allow the arabinose to enter the cell
and a gene-control protein, which binds the arabinose and modifies gene expression. To respond to the availability of some very
hydrophobic molecules, a cell requires only one protein. Which
one and why?
8. How many divisions? In the development pathway of C. elegans, cell division is initially synchronous—that is, all cells divide at the same rate. Later in development, some cells divide
more frequently than do others. How many times does each cell
divide in the synchronous period? Refer to Figure 2.26.

assemble with other chains to form arrays such as the complex of six
insulin molecules shown at the far right (the quarternary structure).
These arrays can often be induced to form well-defined crystals (photo

1. Proteins are linear polymers built of monomer units called
amino acids. The construction of a vast array of macromolecules from a limited number of monomer building blocks
is a recurring theme in biochemistry. Does protein function depend on the linear sequence of amino acids? The
function of a protein is directly dependent on its threedimensional structure (Figure 3.1). Remarkably, proteins
spontaneously fold up into three-dimensional structures
that are determined by the sequence of amino acids in the
protein polymer. Thus, proteins are the embodiment of the
transition from the one-dimensional world of sequences to the
three-dimensional world of molecules capable of diverse
activities.

acids, carboxamides, and a variety of basic groups. When combined in various sequences, this array of functional groups accounts for the broad spectrum of protein function. For instance, the chemical reactivity associated with
these groups is essential to the function of enzymes, the proteins that catalyze
specific chemical reactions in biological systems (see Chapters 8–10).
3. Proteins can interact with one another and with other biological macromolecules to form complex assemblies. The proteins within these assemblies
can act synergistically to generate capabilities not afforded by the individual component proteins (Figure 3.2). These assemblies include macromolecular machines that carry out the accurate replication of DNA, the
transmission of signals within cells, and many other essential processes.

4. Some proteins are quite rigid, whereas others display limited flexibility.
Rigid units can function as structural elements in the cytoskeleton (the internal scaffolding within cells) or in connective tissue. Parts of proteins with
limited flexibility may act as hinges, springs, and levers that are crucial to
protein function, to the assembly of proteins with one another and with
other molecules into complex units, and to the transmission of information
within and between cells (Figure 3.3).

A Repertoire of 20 Amino Acids

Amino acids are the building blocks of proteins. An -amino acid consists
of a central carbon atom, called the  carbon, linked to an amino group, a
carboxylic acid group, a hydrogen atom, and a distinctive R group. The R
group is often referred to as the side chain. With four different groups connected to the tetrahedral -carbon atom, -amino acids are chiral; the two
mirror-image forms are called the L isomer and the D isomer (Figure 3.4).

Only L amino acids are constituents of proteins. For almost all amino acids,
the L isomer has S (rather than R) absolute configuration (Figure 3.5). Although considerable effort has gone into understanding why amino acids in
proteins have this absolute configuration, no satisfactory explanation has
been arrived at. It seems plausible that the selection of L over D was arbitrary but, once made, was fixed early in evolutionary history.
Amino acids in solution at neutral pH exist predominantly as dipolar
ions (also called zwitterions). In the dipolar form, the amino group is protonated (–NH3) and the carboxyl group is deprotonated (–COO). The ionization state of an amino acid varies with pH (Figure 3.6). In acid solution
(e.g., pH 1), the amino group is protonated (–NH3) and the carboxyl group
is not dissociated (–COOH). As the pH is raised, the carboxylic acid is the
first group to give up a proton, inasmuch as its pKa is near 2. The dipolar
form persists until the pH approaches 9, when the protonated amino group

Twenty kinds of side chains varying in size, shape, charge, hydrogenbonding capacity, hydrophobic character, and chemical reactivity are commonly found in proteins. Indeed, all proteins in all species—bacterial, archaeal, and eukaryotic—are constructed from the same set of 20 amino
acids. This fundamental alphabet of proteins is several billion years old. The
remarkable range of functions mediated by proteins results from the diversity and versatility of these 20 building blocks. Understanding how this alphabet is used to create the intricate three-dimensional structures that enable proteins to carry out so many biological processes is an exciting area of
biochemistry and one that we will return to in Section 3.6.
Let us look at this set of amino acids. The simplest one is glycine, which
has just a hydrogen atom as its side chain. With two hydrogen atoms
bonded to the -carbon atom, glycine is unique in being achiral. Alanine,
the next simplest amino acid, has a methyl group (–CH3) as its side chain
(Figure 3.7).
Larger hydrocarbon side chains are found in valine, leucine, and
isoleucine (Figure 3.8). Methionine contains a largely aliphatic side chain that
includes a thioether (–S–) group. The side chain of isoleucine includes an
additional chiral center; only the isomer shown in Figure 3.8 is found in
proteins. The larger aliphatic side chains are hydrophobic—that is, they tend
to cluster together rather than contact water. The three-dimensional structures of water-soluble proteins are stabilized by this tendency of hydrophobic groups to come together, called the hydrophobic effect (see Section 1.3.3). The different sizes and shapes of these hydrocarbon side chains
enable them to pack together to form compact structures with few holes.
Proline also has an aliphatic side chain, but it differs from other members
of the set of 20 in that its side chain is bonded to both the nitrogen and the
-carbon atoms (Figure 3.9). Proline markedly influences protein architecture because its ring structure makes it more conformationally restricted
than the other amino acids.

Three amino acids with relatively simple aromatic side chains are part of
the fundamental repertoire (Figure 3.10). Phenylalanine, as its name indicates, contains a phenyl ring attached in place of one of the hydrogens of
alanine. The aromatic ring of tyrosine contains a hydroxyl group. This hydroxyl group is reactive, in contrast with the rather inert side chains of the
other amino acids discussed thus far. Tryptophan has an indole ring joined
to a methylene (–CH2–) group; the indole group comprises two fused rings
and an NH group. Phenylalanine is purely hydrophobic, whereas tyrosine
and tryptophan are less so because of their hydroxyl and NH groups. The
aromatic rings of tryptophan and tyrosine contain delocalized  electrons
that strongly absorb ultraviolet light (Figure 3.11).
A compound’s extinction coefficient indicates its ability to absorb light.
Beer’s law gives the absorbance (A) of light at a given wavelength:

The side chain is joined to both the 
carbon and the amino group.

Two amino acids, serine and threonine, contain aliphatic hydroxyl groups
(Figure 3.12). Serine can be thought of as a hydroxylated version of alanine,
whereas threonine resembles valine with a hydroxyl group in place of one
of the valine methyl groups. The hydroxyl groups on serine and threonine
make them much more hydrophilic (water loving) and reactive than alanine
and valine. Threonine, like isoleucine, contains an additional asymmetric
center; again only one isomer is present in proteins.
Cysteine is structurally similar to serine but contains a sulfhydryl, or thiol
(–SH), group in place of the hydroxyl (–OH) group (Figure 3.13). The
sulfhydryl group is much more reactive. Pairs of sulfhydryl groups may
come together to form disulfide bonds, which are particularly important in
stabilizing some proteins, as will be discussed shortly.

We turn now to amino acids with very polar side chains that render them
highly hydrophilic. Lysine and arginine have relatively long side chains that
terminate with groups that are positively charged at neutral pH. Lysine is
capped by a primary amino group and arginine by a guanidinium group.
Histidine contains an imidazole group, an aromatic ring that also can be positively charged (Figure 3.14).

Imidazole

With a pKa value near 6, the imidazole group can be uncharged or positively charged near neutral pH, depending on its local environment (Figure
3.15). Indeed, histidine is often found in the active sites of enzymes, where
the imidazole ring can bind and release protons in the course of enzymatic
reactions.
The set of amino acids also contains two with acidic side chains: aspartic acid and glutamic acid (Figure 3.16). These amino acids are often called
aspartate and glutamate to emphasize that their side chains are usually negatively charged at physiological pH. Nonetheless, in some proteins these
side chains do accept protons, and this ability is often functionally important. In addition, the set includes uncharged derivatives of aspartate and

glutamate—asparagine and glutamine—each of which contains a terminal
carboxamide in place of a carboxylic acid (Figure 3.16).
Seven of the 20 amino acids have readily ionizable side chains. These
7 amino acids are able to donate or accept protons to facilitate reactions
as well as to form ionic bonds. Table 3.1 gives equilibria and typical pKa
values for ionization of the side chains of tyrosine, cysteine, arginine, lysine, histidine, and aspartic and glutamic acids in proteins. Two other
groups in proteins—the terminal -amino group and the terminal carboxyl group—can be ionized, and typical pKa values are also included
in Table 3.1.
Amino acids are often designated by either a three-letter abbreviation or
a one-letter symbol (Table 3.2). The abbreviations for amino acids are the
first three letters of their names, except for asparagine (Asn), glutamine
(Gln), isoleucine (Ile), and tryptophan (Trp). The symbols for many amino
acids are the first letters of their names (e.g., G for glycine and L for leucine);
the other symbols have been agreed on by convention. These abbreviations
and symbols are an integral part of the vocabulary of biochemists.
How did this particular set of amino acids become the building blocks
of proteins? First, as a set, they are diverse; their structural and chemical properties span a wide range, endowing proteins with the versatility to
assume many functional roles. Second, as noted in Section 2.1.1, many of
these amino acids were probably available from prebiotic reactions. Finally,
excessive intrinsic reactivity may have eliminated other possible amino

acids. For example, amino acids such as homoserine and homocysteine tend
to form five-membered cyclic forms that limit their use in proteins; the alternative amino acids that are found in proteins—serine and cysteine—do
not readily cyclize, because the rings in their cyclic forms are too small
(Figure 3.17).

3.2 PRIMARY STRUCTURE: AMINO ACIDS ARE LINKED
BY PEPTIDE BONDS TO FORM POLYPEPTIDE CHAINS
Proteins are linear polymers formed by linking the -carboxyl group of one
amino acid to the -amino group of another amino acid with a peptide bond
(also called an amide bond). The formation of a dipeptide from two amino acids
is accompanied by the loss of a water molecule (Figure 3.18). The equilibrium
of this reaction lies on the side of hydrolysis rather than synthesis. Hence,
the biosynthesis of peptide bonds requires an input of free energy. Nonetheless, peptide bonds are quite stable kinetically; the lifetime of a peptide bond
in aqueous solution in the absence of a catalyst approaches 1000 years.

Peptide bond

A series of amino acids joined by peptide bonds form a polypeptide chain,
and each amino acid unit in a polypeptide is called a residue. A polypeptide
chain has polarity because its ends are different, with an -amino group at
one end and an -carboxyl group at the other. By convention, the amino end
is taken to be the beginning of a polypeptide chain, and so the sequence of
amino acids in a polypeptide chain is written starting with the aminoterminal residue. Thus, in the pentapeptide Tyr-Gly-Gly-Phe-Leu (YGGFL),
phenylalanine is the amino-terminal (N-terminal) residue and leucine is the
carboxyl-terminal (C-terminal) residue (Figure 3.19). Leu-Phe-Gly-Gly-Tyr
(LFGGY) is a different pentapeptide, with different chemical properties.
A polypeptide chain consists of a regularly repeating part, called the main
chain or backbone, and a variable part, comprising the distinctive side chains
(Figure 3.20). The polypeptide backbone is rich in hydrogen-bonding potential. Each residue contains a carbonyl group, which is a good hydrogenbond acceptor and, with the exception of proline, an NH group, which is a

good hydrogen-bond donor. These groups interact with each other and with
functional groups from side chains to stabilize particular structures, as will
be discussed in detail.
Most natural polypeptide chains contain between 50 and 2000 amino
acid residues and are commonly referred to as proteins. Peptides made of
small numbers of amino acids are called oligopeptides or simply peptides. The
mean molecular weight of an amino acid residue is about 110, and so the
molecular weights of most proteins are between 5500 and 220,000. We can
also refer to the mass of a protein, which is expressed in units of daltons;
one dalton is equal to one atomic mass unit. A protein with a molecular
weight of 50,000 has a mass of 50,000 daltons, or 50 kd (kilodaltons).
In some proteins, the linear polypeptide chain is cross-linked. The most
common cross-links are disulfide bonds, formed by the oxidation of a pair of
cysteine residues (Figure 3.21). The resulting unit of linked cysteines is

whereas intracellular proteins usually lack them. Rarely, nondisulfide crosslinks derived from other side chains are present in some proteins. For example, collagen fibers in connective tissue are strengthened in this way, as

Primary Structure

3.2.1 Proteins Have Unique Amino Acid Sequences
That Are Specified by Genes
In 1953, Frederick Sanger determined the amino acid sequence of insulin,
a protein hormone (Figure 3.22). This work is a landmark in biochemistry because it showed for the first time that a protein has a precisely defined amino
acid sequence. Moreover, it demonstrated that insulin consists only of L
amino acids linked by peptide bonds between -amino and -carboxyl
groups. This accomplishment stimulated other scientists to carry out sequence studies of a wide variety of proteins. Indeed, the complete amino
acid sequences of more than 100,000 proteins are now known. The striking
fact is that each protein has a unique, precisely defined amino acid sequence.
The amino acid sequence of a protein is often referred to as its primary
structure.
A series of incisive studies in the late 1950s and early 1960s revealed that
the amino acid sequences of proteins are genetically determined. The sequence of nucleotides in DNA, the molecule of heredity, specifies a complementary sequence of nucleotides in RNA, which in turn specifies the
amino acid sequence of a protein. In particular, each of the 20 amino acids
of the repertoire is encoded by one or more specific sequences of three nucleotides (Section 5.5).
Knowing amino acid sequences is important for several reasons. First,
knowledge of the sequence of a protein is usually essential to elucidating its
mechanism of action (e.g., the catalytic mechanism of an enzyme). Moreover, proteins with novel properties can be generated by varying the sequence of known proteins. Second, amino acid sequences determine the
three-dimensional structures of proteins. Amino acid sequence is the link
between the genetic message in DNA and the three-dimensional structure
that performs a protein’s biological function. Analyses of relations between
amino acid sequences and three-dimensional structures of proteins are uncovering the rules that govern the folding of polypeptide chains. Third, sequence determination is a component of molecular pathology, a rapidly
growing area of medicine. Alterations in amino acid sequence can produce
abnormal function and disease. Severe and sometimes fatal diseases, such
as sickle-cell anemia and cystic fibrosis, can result from a change in a single amino acid within a protein. Fourth, the sequence of a protein reveals
much about its evolutionary history (see Chapter 7). Proteins resemble one
another in amino acid sequence only if they have a common ancestor. Consequently, molecular events in evolution can be traced from amino acid sequences; molecular paleontology is a flourishing area of research.

3.2.2 Polypeptide Chains Are Flexible
Yet Conformationally Restricted

H

Examination of the geometry of the protein backbone reveals several important features. First, the peptide bond is
essentially planar (Figure 3.23). Thus, for a pair of amino
acids linked by a peptide bond, six atoms lie in the same
plane: the -carbon atom and CO group from the first
amino acid and the NH group and -carbon atom from
the second amino acid. The nature of the chemical bonding within a peptide explains this geometric preference.
The peptide bond has considerable double-bond character, which prevents rotation about this bond.

are on opposite sides of the peptide bond. In the cis configuration, these groups are on the same side of the peptide bond. Almost
all peptide bonds in proteins are trans. This preference for trans over cis can
be explained by the fact that steric clashes between groups attached to the
-carbon atoms hinder formation of the cis form but do not occur in the trans
configuration (Figure 3.25). By far the most common cis peptide bonds are
X–Pro linkages. Such bonds show less preference for the trans configuration
because the nitrogen of proline is bonded to two tetrahedral carbon atoms,
limiting the steric differences between the trans and cis forms (Figure 3.26).
In contrast with the peptide bond, the bonds between the amino group
and the -carbon atom and between the -carbon atom and the carbonyl
group are pure single bonds. The two adjacent rigid peptide units may rotate
about these bonds, taking on various orientations. This freedom of rotation

about two bonds of each amino acid allows proteins to fold in many different
ways. The rotations about these bonds can be specified by dihedral angles
(Figure 3.27). The angle of rotation about the bond between the nitrogen
and the -carbon atoms is called phi (). The angle of rotation about the
bond between the -carbon and the carbonyl carbon atoms is called psi ().
A clockwise rotation about either bond as viewed from the front of the back
group corresponds to a positive value. The  and  angles determine the
path of the polypeptide chain.
Are all combinations of  and  possible? G. N. Ramachandran recognized that many combinations are forbidden because of steric collisions between atoms. The allowed values can be visualized on a two-dimensional
plot called a Ramachandran diagram (Figure 3.28). Three-quarters of the
possible (, ) combinations are excluded simply by local steric clashes.
Steric exclusion, the fact that two atoms cannot be in the same place at the
same time, can be a powerful organizing principle.
The ability of biological polymers such as proteins to fold into welldefined structures is remarkable thermodynamically. Consider the equilibrium between an unfolded polymer that exists as a random coil—that is, as
a mixture of many possible conformations—and the folded form that adopts
a unique conformation. The favorable entropy associated with the large
number of conformations in the unfolded form opposes folding and must
be overcome by interactions favoring the folded form. Thus, highly flexible polymers with a large number of possible conformations do not fold into
unique structures. The rigidity of the peptide unit and the restricted set of allowed  and  angles limits the number of structures accessible to the unfolded
form sufficiently to allow protein folding to occur.

3.3 SECONDARY STRUCTURE: POLYPEPTIDE CHAINS
CAN FOLD INTO REGULAR STRUCTURES SUCH AS
THE ALPHA HELIX, THE BETA SHEET, AND TURNS
AND LOOPS
Can a polypeptide chain fold into a regularly repeating structure? In 1951,
Linus Pauling and Robert Corey proposed two periodic structures called
the  helix (alpha helix) and the  pleated sheet (beta pleated sheet). Subsequently, other structures such as the  turn and omega () loop were identified. Although not periodic, these common turn or loop structures are well
defined and contribute with  helices and  sheets to form the final protein
structure.

Screw sense—
Describes the direction in which a helical structure rotates with respect to its
axis. If, viewed down the axis of a helix, the chain turns in a clockwise direction, it has a right-handed screw sense.
If the turning is counterclockwise, the
screw sense is left-handed.

STRUCTURAL INSIGHTS, Elements of Protein Structure provides interactive
representations of some of the important elements of protein architecture described in
this chapter, including a summary of secondary structure motifs.

3.3.1 The Alpha Helix Is a Coiled Structure Stabilized
by Intrachain Hydrogen Bonds
In evaluating potential structures, Pauling and Corey considered which conformations of peptides were sterically allowed and which most fully exploited the hydrogen-bonding capacity of the backbone NH and CO
groups. The first of their proposed structures, the  helix, is a rodlike structure (Figure 3.29). A tightly coiled backbone forms the inner part of the rod
and the side chains extend outward in a helical array. The  helix is stabilized by hydrogen bonds between the NH and CO groups of the main chain.
In particular, the CO group of each amino acid forms a hydrogen bond with
the NH group of the amino acid that is situated four residues ahead in the
sequence (Figure 3.30). Thus, except for amino acids near the ends of an 
helix, all the main-chain CO and NH groups are hydrogen bonded. Each
residue is related to the next one by a rise of 1.5 Å along the helix axis and
a rotation of 100 degrees, which gives 3.6 amino acid residues per turn of
helix. Thus, amino acids spaced three and four apart in the sequence are
spatially quite close to one another in an  helix. In contrast, amino acids
two apart in the sequence are situated on opposite sides of the helix and so
are unlikely to make contact. The pitch of the  helix, which is equal to the
product of the translation (1.5 Å) and the number of residues per turn (3.6),
is 5.4 Å. The screw sense of a helix can be right-handed (clockwise) or lefthanded (counterclockwise). The Ramachandran diagram reveals that both

the right-handed and the left-handed helices are among allowed conformations (Figure 3.31). However, right-handed helices are energetically more
favorable because there is less steric clash between the side chains and the
backbone. Essentially all  helices found in proteins are right-handed. In
schematic diagrams of proteins,  helices are depicted as twisted ribbons or
rods (Figure 3.32).
Pauling and Corey predicted the structure of the  helix 6 years before
it was actually seen in the x-ray reconstruction of the structure of myoglobin. The elucidation of the structure of the  helix is a landmark in biochemistry because it demonstrated that the conformation of a polypeptide chain can
be predicted if the properties of its components are rigorously and precisely
known.
The -helical content of proteins ranges widely, from nearly none to almost 100%. For example, about 75% of the residues in ferritin, a protein that
helps store iron, are in  helices (Figure 3.33). Single  helices are usually
less than 45 Å long. However, two or more  helices can entwine to form a
very stable structure, which can have a length of 1000 Å (100 nm, or 0.1 m)

sterically allowed conformations of
extended, -strand-like structures.

Pauling and Corey discovered another periodic structural motif, which they
named the  pleated sheet ( because it was the second structure that they
elucidated, the  helix having been the first). The pleated sheet (or, more
simply, the sheet) differs markedly from the rodlike  helix. A polypeptide chain, called a  strand, in a sheet is almost fully extended rather than
being tightly coiled as in the  helix. A range of extended structures are sterically allowed (Figure 3.35).
The distance between adjacent amino acids along a strand is approximately 3.5 Å, in contrast with a distance of 1.5 Å along an  helix. The side
chains of adjacent amino acids point in opposite directions (Figure 3.36). A
sheet is formed by linking two or more strands by hydrogen bonds. Adjacent chains in a sheet can run in opposite directions (antiparallel sheet)
or in the same direction (parallel sheet). In the antiparallel arrangement, the
NH group and the CO group of each amino acid are respectively hydrogen
bonded to the CO group and the NH group of a partner on the adjacent chain
(Figure 3.37). In the parallel arrangement, the hydrogen-bonding scheme is
slightly more complicated. For each amino acid, the NH group is hydrogen

bonded to the CO group of one amino acid on the adjacent strand, whereas
the CO group is hydrogen bonded to the NH group on the amino acid two
residues farther along the chain (Figure 3.38). Many strands, typically 4 or 5
but as many as 10 or more, can come together in sheets. Such sheets can
be purely antiparallel, purely parallel, or mixed (Figure 3.39).
In schematic diagrams, strands are usually depicted by broad arrows
pointing in the direction of the carboxyl-terminal end to indicate the type
of sheet formed—parallel or antiparallel. More structurally diverse than
 helices, sheets can be relatively flat but most adopt a somewhat twisted
shape (Figure 3.40). The sheet is an important structural element in many
proteins. For example, fatty acid-binding proteins, important for lipid metabolism, are built almost entirely from sheets (Figure 3.41).

3.3.3 Polypeptide Chains Can Change Direction
by Making Reverse Turns and Loops
Most proteins have compact, globular shapes, requiring reversals in the direction of their polypeptide chains. Many of these reversals are accomplished by a common structural element called the reverse turn (also known
as the  turn or hairpin bend), illustrated in Figure 3.42. In many reverse
turns, the CO group of residue i of a polypeptide is hydrogen bonded to the
NH group of residue i  3. This interaction stabilizes abrupt changes in direction of the polypeptide chain. In other cases, more elaborate structures
are responsible for chain reversals. These structures are called loops or sometimes loops (omega loops) to suggest their overall shape. Unlike  helices
and strands, loops do not have regular, periodic structures. Nonetheless,
loop structures are often rigid and well defined (Figure 3.43). Turns and
loops invariably lie on the surfaces of proteins and thus often participate in

interactions between proteins and other molecules. The distribution of 
helices,  strands, and turns along a protein chain is often referred to as its
secondary structure.

3.4 TERTIARY STRUCTURE: WATER-SOLUBLE
PROTEINS FOLD INTO COMPACT STRUCTURES
WITH NONPOLAR CORES
Let us now examine how amino acids are grouped together in a complete
protein. X-ray crystallographic and nuclear magnetic resonance studies
(Section 4.5) have revealed the detailed three-dimensional structures of
thousands of proteins. We begin here with a preview of myoglobin, the first
protein to be seen in atomic detail.
Myoglobin, the oxygen carrier in muscle, is a single polypeptide chain of
153 amino acids (see also Chapters 7 and 10). The capacity of myoglobin to
bind oxygen depends on the presence of heme, a nonpolypeptide prosthetic
(helper) group consisting of protoporphyrin IX and a central iron atom. Myoglobin is an extremely compact molecule. Its overall dimensions are 45  35 
25 Å, an order of magnitude less than if it were fully stretched out (Figure 3.44).

CHAPTER 3 • Protein Structure and Function

FIGURE 3.45 Distribution of
amino acids in myoglobin. (A) A
space-filling model of myoglobin with
hydrophobic amino acids shown in yellow,
charged amino acids shown in blue, and
others shown in white. The surface of the
molecule has many charged amino acids,
as well as some hydrophobic amino acids.
(B) A cross-sectional view shows that
mostly hydrophobic amino acids are found
on the inside of the structure, whereas
the charged amino acids are found on the
protein surface.

About 70% of the main chain is folded into eight  helices, and much of the
rest of the chain forms turns and loops between helices.
The folding of the main chain of myoglobin, like that of most other proteins, is complex and devoid of symmetry. The overall course of the polypeptide chain of a protein is referred to as its tertiary structure. A unifying principle emerges from the distribution of side chains. The striking fact is that
the interior consists almost entirely of nonpolar residues such as leucine, valine, methionine, and phenylalanine (Figure 3.45). Charged residues such
as aspartate, glutamate, lysine, and arginine are absent from the inside of
myoglobin. The only polar residues inside are two histidine residues, which
play critical roles in binding iron and oxygen. The outside of myoglobin, on
the other hand, consists of both polar and nonpolar residues. The spacefilling model shows that there is very little empty space inside.
This contrasting distribution of polar and nonpolar residues reveals a
key facet of protein architecture. In an aqueous environment, protein folding is driven by the strong tendency of hydrophobic residues to be excluded
from water (see Section 1.3.3). Recall that a system is more thermodynamically stable when hydrophobic groups are clustered rather than extended
into the aqueous surroundings. The polypeptide chain therefore folds so that
its hydrophobic side chains are buried and its polar, charged chains are on the
surface. Many  helices and strands are amphipathic; that is, the  helix
or strand has a hydrophobic face, which points into the protein interior,
and a more polar face, which points into solution. The fate of the main chain
accompanying the hydrophobic side chains is important, too. An unpaired
peptide NH or CO group markedly prefers water to a nonpolar milieu. The
secret of burying a segment of main chain in a hydrophobic environment is
pairing all the NH and CO groups by hydrogen bonding. This pairing is
neatly accomplished in an  helix or sheet. Van der Waals interactions between tightly packed hydrocarbon side chains also contribute to the stability of proteins. We can now understand why the set of 20 amino acids contains several that differ subtly in size and shape. They provide a palette from
which to choose to fill the interior of a protein neatly and thereby maximize
van der Waals interactions, which require intimate contact.
Some proteins that span biological membranes are “the exceptions that
prove the rule” regarding the distribution of hydrophobic and hydrophilic
amino acids throughout three-dimensional structures. For example, consider porins, proteins found in the outer membranes of many bacteria
(Figure 3.46). The permeability barriers of membranes are built largely of
alkane chains that are quite hydrophobic (Section 12.2.1). Thus, porins are

covered on the outside largely with hydrophobic residues that interact with
the neighboring alkane chains. In contrast, the center of the protein contains many charged and polar amino acids that surround a water-filled
channel running through the middle of the protein. Thus, because porins
function in hydrophobic environments, they are “inside out” relative to proteins that function in aqueous solution.
Some polypeptide chains fold into two or more compact regions that may
be connected by a flexible segment of polypeptide chain, rather like pearls
on a string. These compact globular units, called domains, range in size from
about 30 to 400 amino acid residues. For example, the extracellular part of
CD4, the cell-surface protein on certain cells of the immune system to which
the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) attaches itself, comprises four
similar domains of approximately 100 amino acids each (Figure 3.47). Often, proteins are found to have domains in common even if their overall tertiary structures are different.

FIGURE 3.47 Protein domains.
The cell-surface protein CD4 consists of
four similar domains.

3.5 QUATERNARY STRUCTURE: POLYPEPTIDE CHAINS
CAN ASSEMBLE INTO MULTISUBUNIT STRUCTURES
Four levels of structure are frequently cited in discussions of protein architecture. So far, we have considered three of them. Primary structure is the
amino acid sequence. Secondary structure refers to the spatial arrangement
of amino acid residues that are nearby in the sequence. Some of these
arrangements are of a regular kind, giving rise to a periodic structure. The
 helix and strand are elements of secondary structure. Tertiary structure

refers to the spatial arrangement of amino acid residues that are far apart in
the sequence and to the pattern of disulfide bonds. We now turn to proteins
containing more than one polypeptide chain. Such proteins exhibit a fourth
level of structural organization. Each polypeptide chain in such a protein is
called a subunit. Quaternary structure refers to the spatial arrangement of
subunits and the nature of their interactions. The simplest sort of quaternary structure is a dimer, consisting of two identical subunits. This organization is present in the DNA-binding protein Cro found in a bacterial virus
called  (Figure 3.48). More complicated quaternary structures also are
common. More than one type of subunit can be present, often in variable
numbers. For example, human hemoglobin, the oxygen-carrying protein in
blood, consists of two subunits of one type (designated ) and two subunits
of another type (designated ), as illustrated in Figure 3.49. Thus, the hemoglobin molecule exists as an 22 tetramer. Subtle changes in the arrangement of subunits within the hemoglobin molecule allow it to carry oxygen
from the lungs to tissues with great efficiency (Section 10.4.2).
Viruses make the most of a limited amount of genetic information by
forming coats that use the same kind of subunit repetitively in a symmetric array. The coat of rhinovirus, the virus that causes the common cold, includes 60 copies each of four subunits (Figure 3.50). The subunits come together to form a nearly spherical shell that encloses the viral genome.

How is the elaborate three-dimensional structure of proteins attained, and
how is the three-dimensional structure related to the one-dimensional
amino acid sequence information? The classic work of Christian Anfinsen
in the 1950s on the enzyme ribonuclease revealed the relation between the
amino acid sequence of a protein and its conformation. Ribonuclease is a
single polypeptide chain consisting of 124 amino acid residues cross-linked
by four disulfide bonds (Figure 3.51). Anfinsen’s plan was to destroy the

three-dimensional structure of the enzyme and to then determine what conditions were required to restore the structure.
Agents such as urea or guanidinium chloride effectively disrupt the noncovalent bonds, although the mechanism of action of these agents is not
fully understood. The disulfide bonds can be cleaved reversibly by reducing them with a reagent such as -mercaptoethanol (Figure 3.52). In the presence of a large excess of -mercaptoethanol, a protein is produced in which
the disulfides (cystines) are fully converted into sulfhydryls (cysteines).
Most polypeptide chains devoid of cross-links assume a random-coil conformation in 8 M urea or 6 M guanidinium chloride, as evidenced by physical properties such as viscosity and optical activity. When ribonuclease was
treated with -mercaptoethanol in 8 M urea, the product was a fully reduced, randomly coiled polypeptide chain devoid of enzymatic activity. In
other words, ribonuclease was denatured by this treatment (Figure 3.53).
Anfinsen then made the critical observation that the denatured ribonuclease, freed of urea and -mercaptoethanol by dialysis, slowly regained enzymatic activity. He immediately perceived the significance of this chance
finding: the sulfhydryl groups of the denatured enzyme became oxidized
by air, and the enzyme spontaneously refolded into a catalytically active
form. Detailed studies then showed that nearly all the original enzymatic
activity was regained if the sulfhydryl groups were oxidized under suitable
conditions. All the measured physical and chemical properties of the refolded enzyme were virtually identical with those of the native enzyme.
These experiments showed that the information needed to specify the catalytically active structure of ribonuclease is contained in its amino acid sequence. Subsequent studies have established the generality of this central
principle of biochemistry: sequence specifies conformation. The dependence
of conformation on sequence is especially significant because of the intimate connection between conformation and function.

A quite different result was obtained when reduced ribonuclease was reoxidized while it was still in 8 M urea and the preparation was then dialyzed
to remove the urea. Ribonuclease reoxidized in this way had only 1% of the
enzymatic activity of the native protein. Why were the outcomes so different
when reduced ribonuclease was reoxidized in the presence and absence of urea?
The reason is that the wrong disulfides formed pairs in urea. There are 105
different ways of pairing eight cysteine molecules to form four disulfides; only
one of these combinations is enzymatically active. The 104 wrong pairings have
been picturesquely termed “scrambled” ribonuclease. Anfinsen found that
scrambled ribonuclease spontaneously converted into fully active, native ribonuclease when trace amounts of -mercaptoethanol were added to an aqueous solution of the protein (Figure 3.54). The added -mercaptoethanol catalyzed the rearrangement of disulfide pairings until the native structure was
regained in about 10 hours. This process was driven by the decrease in free energy as the scrambled conformations were converted into the stable, native conformation of the enzyme. The native disulfide pairings of ribonuclease thus contribute to the stabilization of the thermodynamically preferred structure.
Similar refolding experiments have been performed on many other proteins. In many cases, the native structure can be generated under suitable
conditions. For other proteins, however, refolding does not proceed efficiently. In these cases, the unfolding protein molecules usually become tangled up with one another to form aggregates. Inside cells, proteins called
chaperones block such illicit interactions (Sections 11.36 and 29.x.x).

3.6.1 Amino Acids Have Different Propensities for Forming
Alpha Helices, Beta Sheets, and Beta Turns
How does the amino acid sequence of a protein specify its three-dimensional
structure? How does an unfolded polypeptide chain acquire the form of the
native protein? These fundamental questions in biochemistry can be approached by first asking a simpler one: What determines whether a particular sequence in a protein forms an  helix, a strand, or a turn? Examining
the frequency of occurrence of particular amino acid residues in these secondary structures (Table 3.3) can be a source of insight into this determination. Residues such as alanine, glutamate, and leucine tend to be present in 
helices, whereas valine and isoleucine tend to be present in strands. Glycine,
asparagine, and proline have a propensity for being in turns.
The results of studies of proteins and synthetic peptides have revealed
some reasons for these preferences. The  helix can be regarded as the default conformation. Branching at the -carbon atom, as in valine, threonine,
and isoleucine, tends to destabilize  helices because of steric clashes. These
residues are readily accommodated in strands, in which their side chains
project out of the plane containing the main chain. Serine, aspartate, and
asparagine tend to disrupt  helices because their side chains contain
hydrogen-bond donors or acceptors in close proximity to the main chain,
where they compete for main-chain NH and CO groups. Proline tends to
disrupt both  helices and strands because it lacks an NH group and because its ring structure restricts its  value to near 60 degrees. Glycine
readily fits into all structures and for that reason does not favor helix formation in particular.
Can one predict the secondary structure of proteins by using this knowledge of the conformational preferences of amino acid residues? Predictions
of secondary structure adopted by a stretch of six or fewer residues have
proved to be about 60 to 70% accurate. What stands in the way of more accurate prediction? Note that the conformational preferences of amino acid
residues are not tipped all the way to one structure (see Table 3.3). For

Three-Dimensional Structure

Note: The amino acids are grouped according to their preference for  helices (top
group), sheets (second group), or turns (third group). Arginine shows no significant
preference for any of the structures.

example, glutamate, one of the strongest helix formers,
prefers  helix to strand by only a factor of two. The
preference ratios of most other residues are smaller. Indeed, some penta- and hexapeptide sequences have been
found to adopt one structure in one protein and an entirely different structure in another (Figure 3.55).
Hence, some amino acid sequences do not uniquely determine secondary structure. Tertiary interactions—interactions between residues that are far apart in the sequence—may be decisive in specifying the secondary
structure of some segments. The context is often crucial
in determining the conformational outcome. The conformation of a protein evolved to work in a particular environment or context.
Pathological conditions can result if a protein assumes an inappropriate conformation for the context. Striking examples are prion diseases, such as Creutzfeldt-Jacob disease, kuru, and mad cow disease. These
conditions result when a brain protein called a prion converts from its normal conformation (designated PrPC) to an altered one (PrPSC). This conversion is self-propagating, leading to large aggregates of PrPSC. The role
of these aggregates in the generation of the pathological conditions is not
yet understood.

FIGURE 3.57 Components of a
partially denatured protein solution.
In a half-unfolded protein solution, half
the molecules are fully folded and half
are fully unfolded.

As stated earlier, proteins can be denatured by heat or by chemical denaturants such as urea or guanidium chloride. For many proteins, a comparison of the degree of unfolding as the concentration of denaturant increases
has revealed a relatively sharp transition from the folded, or native, form to
the unfolded, or denatured, form, suggesting that only these two conformational states are present to any significant extent (Figure 3.56). A similar sharp transition is observed if one starts with unfolded proteins and removes the denaturants, allowing the proteins to fold.
Protein folding and unfolding is thus largely an “all or none” process that
results from a cooperative transition. For example, suppose that a protein is
placed in conditions under which some part of the protein structure is thermodynamically unstable. As this part of the folded structure is disrupted,
the interactions between it and the remainder of the protein will be lost. The
loss of these interactions, in turn, will destabilize the remainder of the structure. Thus, conditions that lead to the disruption of any part of a protein
structure are likely to unravel the protein completely. The structural properties of proteins provide a clear rationale for the cooperative transition.
The consequences of cooperative folding can be illustrated by considering the contents of a protein solution
under conditions corresponding to the middle of the transition between the folded and unfolded forms. Under
these conditions, the protein is “half folded.” Yet the solution will contain no half-folded molecules but, instead,
will be a 50/50 mixture of fully folded and fully unfolded
molecules (Figure 3.57). Structures that are partly intact
and partly disrupted are not thermodynamically stable
and exist only transiently. Cooperative folding ensures
that partly folded structures that might interfere with
processes within cells do not accumulate.
3.6.3 Proteins Fold by Progressive Stabilization
of Intermediates Rather Than by Random Search
The cooperative folding of proteins is a thermodynamic property; its occurrence reveals nothing about the kinetics and mechanism of protein folding. How does a protein make the transition from a diverse ensemble of unfolded structures into a unique conformation in the native form? One
possibility a priori would be that all possible conformations are tried out to
find the energetically most favorable one. How long would such a random
search take? Consider a small protein with 100 residues. Cyrus Levinthal
calculated that, if each residue can assume three different conformations,
the total number of structures would be 3100, which is equal to 5 1047. If
it takes 1013 s to convert one structure into another, the total search time
would be 5 1047 1013 s, which is equal to 5 1034 s, or 1.6 1027
years. Clearly, it would take much too long for even a small protein to fold
properly by randomly trying out all possible conformations. The enormous
difference between calculated and actual folding times is called Levinthal’s
paradox.
The way out of this dilemma is to recognize the power of cumulative selection. Richard Dawkins, in The Blind Watchmaker, asked how long it
would take a monkey poking randomly at a typewriter to reproduce Hamlet’s remark to Polonius, “Methinks it is like a weasel” (Figure 3.58). An astronomically large number of keystrokes, of the order of 1040, would be required. However, suppose that we preserved each correct character and

7552dc03_41-76

4/17/01

3:35 PM

Page 69

allowed the monkey to retype only the wrong ones. In this case, only a few
thousand keystrokes, on average, would be needed. The crucial difference
between these cases is that the first employs a completely random search,
whereas, in the second, partly correct intermediates are retained.
The essence of protein folding is the retention of partly correct intermediates. However, the protein-folding problem is much more difficult than the
one presented to our simian Shakespeare. First, the criterion of correctness
is not a residue-by-residue scrutiny of conformation by an omniscient
observer but rather the total free energy of the transient species. Second,
proteins are only marginally stable. The free-energy difference between
the folded and the unfolded states of a typical 100-residue protein is 10 kcal
mol 1 (42 kJ mol 1), and thus each residue contributes on average only
0.1 kcal mol 1 (0.42 kJ mol 1) of energy to maintain the folded state.
This amount is less than that of thermal energy, which is 0.6 kcal mol 1
(2.5 kJ mol 1) at room temperature. This meager stabilization energy means
that correct intermediates, especially those formed early in folding, can be
lost. The analogy is that the monkey would be somewhat free to undo its
correct keystrokes. Nonetheless, the interactions that lead to cooperative
folding can stabilize intermediates as structure builds up. Thus, local regions, which have significant structural preference, though not necessarily
stable on their own, will tend to adopt their favored structures and, as they
form, can interact with one other, leading to increasing stabilization.

Three-Dimensional Structure

3.6.4 Prediction of Three-Dimensional Structure
from Sequence Remains a Great Challenge
The amino acid sequence completely determines the three-dimensional
structure of a protein. However, the prediction of three-dimensional structure from sequence has proved to be extremely difficult. As we have seen,
the local sequence appears to determine only between 60% and 70% of the
secondary structure; long-range interactions are required to fix the full secondary structure and the tertiary structure.
Investigators are exploring two fundamentally different approaches to
predicting three-dimensional structure from amino acid sequence. The first
is ab initio prediction, which attempts to predict the folding of an amino acid
sequence without any direct reference to other known protein structures.
Computer-based calculations are employed that attempt to minimize the
free energy of a structure with a given amino acid sequence or to simulate
the folding process. The utility of these methods is limited by the vast number of possible conformations, the marginal stability of proteins, and the
subtle energetics of weak interactions in aqueous solution. The second approach takes advantage of our growing knowledge of the three-dimensional
structures of many proteins. In these knowledge-based methods, an amino
acid sequence of unknown structure is examined for compatibility with any
known protein structures. If a significant match is detected, the known
structure can be used as an initial model. Knowledge-based methods have
been a source of many insights into the three-dimensional conformation of
proteins of known sequence but unknown structure.
3.6.5 Protein Modification and Cleavage
Confer New Capabilities
Proteins are able to perform numerous functions relying solely on
the versatility of their 20 amino acids. However, many proteins are
covalently modifed, through the attachment of groups other than amino
acids, to augment their functions (Figure 3.59). For example, acetyl groups
are attached to the amino termini of many proteins, a modification that

simulations shown, the cumulative

makes these proteins more resistant to degradation. The addition of hydroxyl groups to many proline residues stabilizes fibers of newly synthesized
collagen, a fibrous protein found in connective tissue and bone. The biological significance of this modification is evident in the disease scurvy: a
deficiency of vitamin C results in insufficient hydroxylation of collagen and
the abnormal collagen fibers that result are unable to maintain normal tissue strength. Another specialized amino acid produced by a finishing touch
is -carboxyglutamate. In vitamin K deficiency, insufficient carboxylation
of glutamate in prothrombin, a clotting protein, can lead to hemorrhage.
Many proteins, especially those that are present on the surfaces of cells or
are secreted, acquire carbohydrate units on specific asparagine residues. The
addition of sugars makes the proteins more hydrophilic and able to participate in interactions with other proteins. Conversely, the addition of a fatty
acid to an -amino group or a cysteine sulfhydryl group produces a more
hydrophobic protein.
Many hormones, such as epinephrine (adrenaline), alter the activities of
enzymes by stimulating the phosphorylation of the hydroxyl amino acids
serine and threonine; phosphoserine and phosphothreonine are the most ubiquitous modified amino acids in proteins. Growth factors such as insulin act
by triggering the phosphorylation of the hydroxyl group of tyrosine residues
to form phosphotyrosine. The phosphoryl groups on these three modified
amino acids are readily removed; thus they are able to act as reversible
switches in regulating cellular processes. The roles of phosphorylation in
signal transduction will be discussed extensively in Chapter 15.
The preceding modifications consist of the addition of special groups to
amino acids. Other special groups are generated by chemical rearrangements of side chains and, sometimes, the peptide backbone. For example,
certain jellyfish produce a fluorescent green protein (Figure 3.60). The
source of the fluorescence is a group formed by the spontaneous rearrangement and oxidation of the sequence Ser-Tyr-Gly within the center of the
protein. This protein is of great utility to researchers as a marker within cells
(Section 4.3.5).
Finally, many proteins are cleaved and trimmed after synthesis. For example, digestive enzymes are synthesized as inactive precursors that can be
stored safely in the pancreas. After release into the intestine, these precursors become activated by peptide-bond cleavage. In blood clotting, peptidebond cleavage converts soluble fibrinogen into insoluble fibrin. A number
of polypeptide hormones, such as adrenocorticotropic hormone, arise from
the splitting of a single large precursor protein. Likewise, many virus proteins are produced by the cleavage of large polyprotein precursors. We shall
encounter many more examples of modification and cleavage as essential
features of protein formation and function. Indeed, these finishing touches
account for much of the versatility, precision, and elegance of protein action
and regulation.

• Proteins are the workhorses of biochemistry, participating in essentially

all cellular processes. Protein structure can be described at four levels.
The primary structure refers to the amino acid sequence. The secondary structure refers to the conformation adopted by local regions of the
polypeptide chain. Tertiary structure describes the overall folding of the
polypeptide chain. Finally, quaternary structure refers to the specific
association of multiple polypeptide chains to form multisubunit

Proteins Are Built from a Repertoire of 20 Amino Acids

Proteins are linear polymers of amino acids. Each amino acid consists
of a central tetrahedral carbon atom linked to an amino group, a carboxylic acid group, a distinctive side chain, and a hydrogen. These tetrahedral centers, with the exception of that of glycine, are chiral; only the
L isomer exists in natural proteins. All natural proteins are constructed
from the same set of 20 amino acids. The side chains of these 20 building blocks vary tremendously in size, shape, and the presence of functional groups. They can be grouped as follows: (1) aliphatic side
chains—glycine, alanine, valine, leucine, isoleucine, methionine, and
proline; (2) aromatic side chains—phenylalanine, tyrosine, and tryptophan; (3) hydroxyl-containing aliphatic side chains—serine and threonine; (4) sulfhydryl-containing cysteine; (5) basic side chains—lysine,
arginine, and histidine; (6) acidic side chains—aspartic acid and glutamic acid; and (7) carboxamide-containing side chains—asparagine
and glutamine. These groupings are somewhat arbitrary and many other
sensible groupings are possible.

CHAPTER 3 • Protein Structure and Function

Primary Structure: Amino Acids Are Linked by Peptide Bonds to Form
Polypeptide Chains

The amino acids in a polypeptide are linked by amide bonds formed between the carboxyl group of one amino acid and the amino group of the
next. This linkage, called a peptide bond, has several important properties. First, it is resistant to hydrolysis so that proteins are remarkably
stable kinetically. Second, the peptide group is planar because the C–N
bond has considerable double-bond character. Third, each peptide bond
has both a hydrogen-bond donor (the NH group) and a hydrogen-bond
acceptor (the CO group). Hydrogen bonding between these backbone
groups is a distinctive feature of protein structure. Finally, the peptide
bond is uncharged, which allows proteins to form tightly packed globular structures having significant amounts of the backbone buried
within the protein interior. Because they are linear polymers, proteins
can be described as sequences of amino acids. Such sequences are written from the amino to the carboxyl terminus.

•

Secondary Structure: Polypeptide Chains Can Fold into Regular Structures
Such as the Alpha Helix, the Beta Sheet, and Turns and Loops

Two major elements of secondary structure are the  helix and the
strand. In the  helix, the polypeptide chain twists into a tightly packed
rod. Within the helix, the CO group of each amino acid is hydrogen
bonded to the NH group of the amino acid four residues along the
polypeptide chain. In the strand, the polypeptide chain is nearly fully
extended. Two or more strands connected by NH-to-CO hydrogen
bonds come together to form sheets.

•

Tertiary Structure: Water-Soluble Proteins Fold into Compact Structures
with Nonpolar Cores

The compact, asymmetric structure that individual polypeptides attain
is called tertiary structure. The tertiary structures of water-soluble proteins have features in common: (1) an interior formed of amino acids with
hydrophobic side chains and (2) a surface formed largely of hydrophilic
amino acids that interact with the aqueous environment. The driving
force for the formation of the tertiary structure of water-soluble proteins
is the hydrophobic interactions between the interior residues. Some proteins that exist in a hydrophobic environment, in membranes, display
the inverse distribution of hydrophobic and hydrophilic amino acids. In
these proteins, the hydrophobic amino acids are on the surface to interact with the environment, whereas the hydrophilic groups are shielded
from the environment in the interior of the protein.

•

Quaternary Structure: Polypeptide Chains Can Assemble
into Multisubunit Structures

Proteins consisting of more than one polypeptide chain display quaternary structure, and each individual polypeptide chain is called a subunit. Quaternary structure can be as simple as two identical subunits or
as complex as dozens of different subunits. In most cases, the subunits
are held together by noncovalent bonds.

•

The Amino Acid Sequence of a Protein Determines Its
Three-Dimensional Structure

The amino acid sequence completely determines the three-dimensional
structure and, hence, all other properties of a protein. Some proteins can
be unfolded completely yet refold efficiently when placed under conditions in which the folded form of the protein is stable. The amino acid
sequence of a protein is determined by the sequences of bases in a DNA
molecule. This one-dimensional sequence information is extended into

the three-dimensional world by the ability of proteins to fold spontaneously. Protein folding is a highly cooperative process; structural intermediates between the unfolded and folded forms do not accumulate.
The versatility of proteins is further enhanced by covalent modifications. Such modifications can incorporate functional groups not present in the 20 amino acids. Other modifications are important to the regulation of protein activity. Through their structural stability, diversity,
and chemical reactivity, proteins make possible most of the key
processes associated with life.

The apparent equilibrium constant Ka for this ionization is

What is the relation between pH and the ratio of acid to base?
A useful expression can be derived from equation 4. Rearrangement of that equation gives

The pH of a solution can be calculated from equation 8 if
the molar proportion of A to HA and the pKa of HA are known.
Consider a solution of 0.1 M acetic acid and 0.2 M acetate ion.
The pKa of acetic acid is 4.8. Hence, the pH of the solution is

Buffers
An acid–base conjugate pair (such as acetic acid and acetate ion)
has an important property: it resists changes in the pH of a solution. In other words, it acts as a buffer. Consider the addition
of OH to a solution of acetic acid (HA):
HA  OH 34 A  H2O
A plot of the dependence of the pH of this solution on the
amount of OH added is called a titration curve (Figure 3.61).
Note that there is an inflection point in the curve at pH 4.8,
which is the pKa of acetic acid. In the vicinity of this pH, a relatively large amount of OH produces little change in pH. In
other words, the buffer maintains the value of pH near a given
value, despite the addition of other either protons or hydroxide

of the -COOH group is 2.4, whereas that of the -NH3

PROBLEMS
1. Shape and dimension. (a) Tropomyosin, a 70-kd muscle
protein, is a two-stranded -helical coiled coil. Estimate the
length of the molecule? (b) Suppose that a 40-residue segment
of a protein folds into a two-stranded antiparallel structure
with a 4-residue hairpin turn. What is the longest dimension
of this motif?
2. Contrasting isomers. Poly-L-leucine in an organic solvent
such as dioxane is  helical, whereas poly-L-isoleucine is not.
Why do these amino acids with the same number and kinds of
atoms have different helix-forming tendencies?
3. Active again. A mutation that changes an alanine residue in
the interior of a protein to valine is found to lead to a loss of activity. However, activity is regained when a second mutation at
a different position changes an isoleucine residue to glycine.
How might this second mutation lead to a restoration of activity?
4. Shuffle test. An enzyme that catalyzes disulfide–sulfhydryl
exchange reactions, called protein disulfide isomerase (PDI), has
been isolated. PDI rapidly converts inactive scrambled ribonuclease into enzymatically active ribonuclease. In contrast, insulin
is rapidly inactivated by PDI. What does this important observation imply about the relation between the amino acid sequence
of insulin and its three-dimensional structure?
5. Stretching a target. A protease is an enzyme that catalyzes
the hydrolysis of the peptide bonds of target proteins. How
might a protease bind a target protein so that its main chain be-

comes fully extended in the vicinity of the vulnerable peptide
bond?
6. Often irreplaceable. Glycine is a highly conserved amino acid
residue in the evolution of proteins. Why?
7. Potential partners. Identify the groups in a protein that can
form hydrogen bonds or electrostatic bonds with an arginine side
chain at pH 7.
8. Permanent waves. The shape of hair is determined in part by
the pattern of disulfide bonds in keratin, its major protein. How
can curls be induced?
9. Location is everything. Proteins that span biological membranes often contain  helices. Given that the insides of membranes are highly hydrophobic (Section 12.2.1), predict what
type of amino acids would be in such a helix. Why is an  helix
particularly suited to exist in the hydrophobic environment of
the interior of a membrane?
10. Issues of stability. Proteins are quite stable. The lifetime of
a peptide bond in aqueous solution is nearly 1000 years. However, the G° of hydrolysis of proteins is negative and quite
large. How can you account for the stability of the peptide bond
in light of the fact that hydrolysis releases much energy?
11. Minor species. For an amino acid such as alanine, the major
species in solution at pH 7 is the zwitterionic form. Assume a
pKa value of 8 for the amino group and a pKa value of 3 for the

carboxylic acid and estimate the ratio of the concentration of
neutral amino acid species (with the carboxylic acid protonated
and the amino group neutral) to that of the zwitterionic species
at pH 7.
12. A matter of convention. All L amino acids have an S absolute
configuration except L-cysteine, which has the R configuration.
Explain why L-cysteine is designated as the R absolute configuration.
13. Hidden message. Translate the following amino acid sequence into one-letter code: Ser-Ala-Val-Glu-Met-Glu-Ile-MetThr-Arg-Ala-Pro-Pro-Glu-Asp-Ile-Asn-Ala-Gly-Glu-AsnGlu. Note the message.
14. Who goes first? Would you expect Pro–X peptide bonds to
tend to have cis conformations like those of X–Pro bonds? Why
or why not?
15. Matching. For each of the amino acid derivatives shown below (A–E), find the matching set of  and  values (a–e).

In the preceding chapter, we saw that proteins play crucial roles in nearly all
biological processes—in catalysis, signal transmission, and structural support. This remarkable range of functions arises from the existence of thousands of proteins, each folded into a distinctive three-dimensional structure
that enables it to interact with one or more of a highly
diverse array of molecules. A major goal of biochemistry is
to determine how amino acid sequences specify the conforOUTLINE

synthesis of new drugs, functional protein fragments, and antigens for inducing the formation of specific antibodies. Nuclear magnetic resonance
(NMR) spectroscopy and x-ray crystallography are the principal techniques
for elucidating three-dimensional structure, the key determinant of function.
The exploration of proteins by this array of physical and chemical techniques has greatly enriched our understanding of the molecular basis of life
and makes it possible to tackle some of the most challenging questions of
biology in molecular terms.
4.0.1 The Proteome Is the Functional Representation
of the Genome
Many organisms are yielding their DNA base sequences to gene sequencers,
including several metazoans. The roundworm Caenorhabditis elegans has a
genome of 97 million bases and about 19,000 protein-encoding genes,
whereas that of the fruit fly Drosophilia melanogaster contains 180 million
bases and about 14,000 genes. The incredible progress being made in gene
sequencing has already culminated in the elucidation of the complete sequence of the human genome, all 3 billion bases with an estimated 40,000
genes. But this genomic knowledge is analogous to a list of parts for a car—
it does not explain how the parts work together. A new word has been
coined, the proteome, to signify a more complex level of information content, the level of functional information, which encompasses the type, functions, and interactions of proteins that yield a functional unit.
The term proteome is derived from proteins expressed by the genome.
Whereas the genome tells us what is possible, the proteome tells us what is
functionally present—for example, which proteins interact to form a signaltransduction pathway or an ion channel in a membrane. The proteome is
not a fixed characteristic of the cell. Rather, because it represents the functional expression of information, it varies with cell type, developmental
stage, and environmental conditions, such as the presence of hormones. The
proteome is much larger than the genome because of such factors as alternatively spliced RNA, the posttranslational modification of proteins, the
temporal regulation of protein synthesis, and varying protein–protein interactions. Unlike the genome, the proteome is not static.
An understanding of the proteome is acquired by investigating, characterizing, and cataloging proteins. An investigator often begins the process
by separating a particular protein from all other biomolecules in the cell.

4.1 THE PURIFICATION OF PROTEINS IS AN ESSENTIAL
FIRST STEP IN UNDERSTANDING THEIR FUNCTION
An adage of biochemistry is, Never waste pure thoughts on an impure protein. Starting from pure proteins, we can determine amino acid sequences
and evolutionary relationships between proteins in diverse organisms and
we can investigate a protein’s biochemical function. Moreover, crystals of
the protein may be grown from pure protein, and from such crystals we can
obtain x-ray data that will provide us with a picture of the protein’s tertiary
structure—the actual functional unit.
4.1.1 The Assay: How Do We Recognize the Protein That We
Are Looking For?
Purification should yield a sample of protein containing only one type of
molecule, the protein in which the biochemist is interested. This protein

7552dc04_77-116

4/25/01

12:40 PM

Page 79

sample may be only a fraction of 1% of the starting material, whether that
starting material consists of cells in culture or a particular organ from a plant
or animal. How is the biochemist able to isolate a particular protein from a
complex mixture of proteins?
The biochemist needs a test, called an assay, for some unique identifying property of the protein so that he or she can tell when the protein is present. Determining an effective assay is often difficult; but the more specific
the assay, the more effective the purification. For enzymes, which are protein catalysts (Chapter 8), the assay is usually based on the reaction that the
enzyme catalyzes in the cell. Consider the enzyme lactate dehydrogenase,
an important player in the anaerobic generation of energy from glucose as
well as in the synthesis of glucose from lactate. Lactate dehydrogenase carries out the following reaction:

Pyruvate

Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide [reduced (NADH); Section 14.3.1]
is distinguishable from the other components of the reaction by its ability
to absorb light at 340 nm. Consequently, we can follow the progress of the
reaction by examining how much light the reaction mixture absorbs at
340 nm in unit time—for instance, within 1 minute after the addition of the
enzyme. Our assay for enzyme activity during the purification of lactate
dehydrogenase is thus the increase in absorbance of light at 340 nm observed
in 1 minute.
To be certain that our purification scheme is working, we need one additional piece of information—the amount of protein present in the mixture
being assayed. There are various rapid and accurate means of determining
protein concentration. With these two experimentally determined numbers—enzyme activity and protein concentration—we then calculate the
specific activity, the ratio of enzyme activity to the amount of protein in the
enzyme assay. The specific activity will rise as the purification proceeds and
the protein mixture being assayed consists to a greater and greater extent of
lactate dehydrogenase. In essence, the point of the purification is to maximize the specific activity.
4.1.2 Proteins Must Be Released from the Cell to Be Purified
Having found an assay and chosen a source of protein, we must now fractionate the cell into components and determine which component is enriched in the protein of interest. Such fractionation schemes are developed
by trial and error, on the basis of previous experience. In the first step, a
homogenate is formed by disrupting the cell membrane, and the mixture is
fractionated by centrifugation, yielding a dense pellet of heavy material at
the bottom of the centrifuge tube and a lighter supernatant above (Figure
4.1). The supernatant is again centrifuged at a greater force to yield yet another pellet and supernatant. The procedure, called differential centrifugation, yields several fractions of decreasing density, each still containing hundreds of different proteins, which are subsequently assayed for the activity
being purified. Usually, one fraction will be enriched for such activity, and
it then serves as the source of material to which more discriminating purification techniques are applied.

4.1.3 Proteins Can Be Purified According to Solubility,
Size, Charge, and Binding Affinity
Several thousand proteins have been purified in active form on the basis of
such characteristics as solubility, size, charge, and specific binding affinity.
Usually, protein mixtures are subjected to a series of separations, each based
on a different property to yield a pure protein. At each step in the purification, the preparation is assayed and the protein concentration is determined.
Substantial quantities of purified proteins, of the order of many milligrams,
are needed to fully elucidate their three-dimensional structures and their
mechanisms of action. Thus, the overall yield is an important feature of a
purification scheme. A variety of purification techniques are available.
Salting Out. Most proteins are less soluble at high salt concentrations,
an effect called salting out. The salt concentration at which a protein precipitates differs from one protein to another. Hence, salting out can be used
to fractionate proteins. For example, 0.8 M ammonium sulfate precipitates
fibrinogen, a blood-clotting protein, whereas a concentration of 2.4 M is
needed to precipitate serum albumin. Salting out is also useful for concentrating dilute solutions of proteins, including active fractions obtained from
other purification steps. Dialysis can be used to remove the salt if necessary.
Dialysis. Proteins can be separated from small molecules by dialysis
through a semipermeable membrane, such as a cellulose membrane with

7552dc04_77-116

5/11/01

9:33 AM

Page 81

pores (Figure 4.2). Molecules having dimensions significantly greater than the pore diameter are retained inside
the dialysis bag, whereas smaller molecules and ions traverse the pores of such a membrane and emerge in the
dialysate outside the bag. This technique is useful for removing a salt or other small molecule, but it will not distinguish between proteins effectively.

Buffer
The sample is applied to the top of a column consisting
of porous beads made of an insoluble but highly hydrated
polymer such as dextran or agarose (which are carbohydrates) or polyacrylamide. Sephadex, Sepharose, and Biogel are commonly used commercial preparations of these
beads, which are typically 100 ␮m (0.1 mm) in diameter.
Small molecules can enter these beads, but large ones cannot. The result is that small molecules are distributed in the aqueous solution both inside the beads and between them, whereas large molecules are
located only in the solution between the beads. Large molecules flow more
rapidly through this column and emerge first because a smaller volume is accessible to them. Molecules that are of a size to occasionally enter a bead will
flow from the column at an intermediate position, and small molecules,
which take a longer, tortuous path, will exit last.

Affinity Chromatography. Affinity chromatography is another powerful and generally applicable means of purifying proteins. This technique
takes advantage of the high affinity of many proteins for specific chemical
groups. For example, the plant protein concanavalin A can be purified by
passing a crude extract through a column of beads containing covalently attached glucose residues. Concanavalin A binds to such a column because it
has affinity for glucose, whereas most other proteins do not. The bound concanavalin A can then be released from the column by adding a concentrated
solution of glucose. The glucose in solution displaces the column-attached
glucose residues from binding sites on concanavalin A (Figure 4.5). Affinity chromatography is a powerful means of isolating transcription factors,
proteins that regulate gene expression by binding to specific DNA sequences. A protein mixture is percolated through a column containing specific DNA sequences attached to a matrix; proteins with a high affinity for
the sequence will bind and be retained. In this instance, the transcription
factor is released by washing with a solution containing a high concentration of salt. In general, affinity chromatography can be effectively used to
isolate a protein that recognizes group X by (1) covalently attaching X or a
derivative of it to a column, (2) adding a mixture of proteins to this column,
which is then washed with buffer to remove unbound proteins, and (3) eluting the desired protein by adding a high concentration of a soluble form of
X or altering the conditions to decrease binding affinity. Affinity chromatography is most effective when the interaction of the protein and the
molecule that is used as the bait is highly specific.
High-Pressure Liquid Chromatography. The resolving power of all
of the column techniques can be improved substantially through the use of
a technique called high-pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC), which is an
enhanced version of the column techniques already discussed. The column
materials themselves are much more finely divided and, as a consequence,
there are more interaction sites and thus greater resolving power. Because
the column is made of finer material, pressure must be applied to the column to obtain adequate flow rates. The net result is high resolution as well
as rapid separation (Figure 4.6).

4.1.4 Proteins Can Be Separated by Gel Electrophoresis
and Displayed

Protein Purification

How can we tell whether a purification scheme is effective? One way is to
ascertain that the specific activity rises with each purification step. Another
is to visualize the effectiveness by displaying the proteins present at each
step. The technique of electrophoresis makes the latter method possible.

Electrophoretic separations are nearly always carried out in gels (or on solid
supports such as paper) because the gel serves as a molecular sieve that enhances separation (Figure 4.7). Molecules that are small compared with the
pores in the gel readily move through the gel, whereas molecules much larger
than the pores are almost immobile. Intermediate-size molecules move
through the gel with various degrees of facility. Electrophoresis is performed

Gel Electrophoresis. A molecule with a net charge will move in an
electric field. This phenomenon, termed electrophoresis, offers a powerful
means of separating proteins and other macromolecules, such as DNA and
RNA. The velocity of migration (v) of a protein (or any molecule) in an
electric field depends on the electric field strength (E), the net charge on
the protein (z), and the frictional coefficient (f).

in a thin, vertical slab of polyacrylamide. The direction of flow is from top
to bottom. Polyacrylamide gels, formed by the polymerization of acrylamide
and cross-linked by methylenebisacrylamide, are choice supporting media
for electrophoresis because they are chemically inert and are readily formed
(Figure 4.8). Electrophoresis is the opposite of gel filtration in that all of the
molecules, regardless of size, are forced to move through the same matrix.
The gel behaves as one bead of a gel-filtration column.
Proteins can be separated largely on the basis of mass by electrophoresis
in a polyacrylamide gel under denaturing conditions. The mixture of proteins is first dissolved in a solution of sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS), an anionic detergent that disrupts nearly all noncovalent interactions in native
proteins. Mercaptoethanol (2-thioethanol) or dithiothreitol also is added to
reduce disulfide bonds. Anions of SDS bind to main chains at a ratio of about
one SDS anion for every two amino acid residues. This complex of SDS with
a denatured protein has a large net negative charge that is roughly proportional to the mass of the protein. The negative charge acquired on binding
SDS is usually much greater than the charge on the native protein; this native charge is thus rendered insignificant. The SDS–protein complexes are
then subjected to electrophoresis. When the electrophoresis is complete, the
proteins in the gel can be visualized by staining them with silver or a dye such
as Coomassie blue, which reveals a series of bands (Figure 4.9). Radioactive

labels can be detected by placing a sheet of x-ray film over the gel, a procedure called autoradiography.
Small proteins move rapidly through the gel, whereas large proteins stay at
the top, near the point of application of the mixture. The mobility of most
polypeptide chains under these conditions is linearly proportional to the logarithm of their mass (Figure 4.10). Some carbohydrate-rich proteins and
membrane proteins do not obey this empirical relation, however. SDS–
polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) is rapid, sensitive, and
capable of a high degree of resolution. As little as 0.1 ␮g (⬃2 pmol) of a
protein gives a distinct band when stained with Coomassie blue, and even
less (⬃0.02 ␮g) can be detected with a silver stain. Proteins that differ in
mass by about 2% (e.g., 40 and 41 kd, arising from a difference of about 10
residues) can usually be distinguished.
We can examine the efficacy of our purification scheme by analyzing a
part of each fraction by SDS-PAGE. The initial fractions will display dozens
to hundreds of proteins. As the purification progresses, the number of bands
will diminish, and the prominence of one of the bands should increase. This
band will correspond to the protein of interest.
Isoelectric Focusing. Proteins can also be separated electrophoretically on the basis of their relative contents of acidic and basic residues. The
isoelectric point (pl) of a protein is the pH at which its net charge is zero.
At this pH, its electrophoretic mobility is zero because z in equation 1 is
equal to zero. For example, the pI of cytochrome c, a highly basic electrontransport protein, is 10.6, whereas that of serum albumin, an acidic protein
in blood, is 4.8. Suppose that a mixture of proteins undergoes electrophoresis in a pH gradient in a gel in the absence of SDS. Each protein
will move until it reaches a position in the gel at which the pH is equal to
the pI of the protein. This method of separating proteins according to their
isoelectric point is called isoelectric focusing. The pH gradient in the gel is
formed first by subjecting a mixture of polyampholytes (small multicharged
polymers) having many pI values to electrophoresis. Isoelectric focusing can
readily resolve proteins that differ in pI by as little as 0.01, which means
that proteins differing by one net charge can be separated (Figure 4.11).

Two-Dimensional Electrophoresis. Isoelectric focusing can be combined with SDS–PAGE to obtain very high resolution separations. A single sample is first subjected to isoelectric focusing. This single-lane gel is
then placed horizontally on top of an SDS–polyacrylamide slab. The proteins are thus spread across the top of the polyacrylamide gel according to
how far they migrated during isoelectric focusing. They then undergo electrophoresis again in a perpendicular direction (vertically) to yield a twodimensional pattern of spots. In such a gel, proteins have been separated in
the horizontal direction on the basis of isoelectric point and in the vertical
direction on the basis of mass. It is remarkable that more than a thousand
different proteins in the bacterium Escherichia coli can be resolved in a single experiment by two-dimensional electrophoresis (Figure 4.12).

Proteins isolated from cells under different physiological conditions can
be subjected to two-dimensional electrophoresis, followed by an examination of the intensity of the signals. In this way, particular proteins can be
seen to increase or decrease in concentration in response to the physiological state. How can we tell what protein is being regulated? A former drawback to the power of the two-dimensional gel is that, although many proteins are displayed, they are not identified. It is now possible to identify
proteins by coupling two-dimensional gel electrophoresis with mass spectrometric techniques. We will consider these techniques when we examine
how the mass of a protein is determined (Section 4.1.6).
4.1.5 A Protein Purification Scheme Can
Be Quantitatively Evaluated
To determine the success of a protein purification scheme, we monitor the
procedure at each step by determining specific activity and by performing
an SDS-PAGE analysis. Consider the results for the purification of a fictitious protein, summarized in Table 4.1 and Figure 4.13. At each step, the
following parameters are measured:
Total protein. The quantity of protein present in a fraction is obtained by
determining the protein concentration of a part of each fraction and multiplying by the fraction’s total volume.
Total activity. The enzyme activity for the fraction is obtained by measuring the enzyme activity in the volume of fraction used in the assay and multiplying by the fraction’s total volume.

Protein Purification

FIGURE 4.13 Electrophoretic analysis
of a protein purification. The
purification scheme in Table 4.1 was
analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Each lane contained
50 ␮g of sample. The effectiveness of the
purification can be seen as the band for
the protein of interest becomes more
prominent relative to other bands.

Specific activity. This parameter is obtained by dividing total activity by
total protein.
Yield. This parameter is a measure of the activity retained after each
purification step as a percentage of the activity in the crude extract. The
amount of activity in the initial extract is taken to be 100%.
Purification level. This parameter is a measure of the increase in purity and
is obtained by dividing the specific activity, calculated after each purification step, by the specific activity of the initial extract.
As we see in Table 4.1, the first purification step, salt fractionation, leads
to an increase in purity of only 3-fold, but we recover nearly all the target
protein in the original extract, given that the yield is 92%. After dialysis to
lower the high concentration of salt remaining from the salt fractionation,
the fraction is passed through an ion-exchange column. The purification
now increases to 9-fold compared with the original extract, whereas the
yield falls to 77%. Molecular exclusion chromatography brings the level of
purification to 100-fold, but the yield is now at 50%. The final step is affinity chromatography with the use of a ligand specific for the target enzyme.
This step, the most powerful of these purification procedures, results in a
purification level of 3000-fold, while lowering the yield to 35%. The SDSPAGE in Figure 4.13 shows that, if we load a constant amount of protein
onto each lane after each step, the number of bands decreases in proportion
to the level of purification, and the amount of protein of interest increases
as a proportion of the total protein present.
A good purification scheme takes into account both purification levels
and yield. A high degree of purification and a poor yield leave little protein
with which to experiment. A high yield with low purification leaves many
contaminants (proteins other than the one of interest) in the fraction and
complicates the interpretation of experiments.

Biomolecules and Determining Their Masses

technique, we can determine such parameters as mass and density, learn
something about the shape of a molecule, and investigate the interactions
between molecules. To deduce these properties from the centrifugation data,
we need a mathematical description of how a particle behaves in a centrifugal force.
A particle will move through a liquid medium when subjected to a centrifugal force. A convenient means of quantifying the rate of movement is
to calculate the sedimentation coefficient, s, of a particle by using the following equation:
s ⫽ m(1 ⫺ 苶␯␳)/f
where m is the mass of the particle, ␯苶 is the partial specific volume (the reciprocal of the particle density), ␳ is the density of the medium and f is the
frictional coefficient (a measure of the shape of the particle). The (1 ⫺ 苶␯␳)
term is the buoyant force exerted by liquid medium.
Sedimentation coefficients are usually expressed in Svedberg units (S),
equal to 10⫺13 s. The smaller the S value, the slower a molecule moves in a
centrifugal field. The S values for a number of biomolecules and cellular
components are listed in Table 4.2 and Figure 4.14.
Several important conclusions can be drawn from the preceding equation:
2.1

1. The sedimentation velocity of a particle depends in
part on its mass. A more massive particle sediments more
rapidly than does a less massive particle of the same shape
and density.

2. Shape, too, influences the sedimentation velocity because it affects the viscous drag. The frictional coefficient
f of a compact particle is smaller than that of an extended
particle of the same mass. Hence, elongated particles sediment more slowly than do spherical ones of the same
mass.
3. A dense particle moves more rapidly than does a less
dense one because the opposing buoyant force (1 ⫺ 苶␯␳)
is smaller for the denser particle.
4. The sedimentation velocity also depends on the density of the solution. (␳). Particles sink when ␯苶␳ ⬍ 1, float

A technique called zonal, band, or most commonly gradient centrifugation can be used to separate proteins with different sedimentation coefficients. The first step is to form a density gradient in a centrifuge tube. Differing proportions of a low-density solution (such as 5% sucrose) and a
high-density solution (such as 20% sucrose) are mixed to create a linear gradient of sucrose concentration ranging from 20% at the bottom of the tube
to 5% at the top (Figure 4.15). The role of the gradient is to prevent connective flow. A small volume of a solution containing the mixture of proteins to be separated is placed on top of the density gradient. When the
rotor is spun, proteins move through the gradient and separate according to
their sedimentation coefficients. The time and speed of the centrifugation
is determined empirically. The separated bands, or zones, of protein can be
harvested by making a hole in the bottom of the tube and collecting drops.
The drops can be measured for protein content and catalytic activity or another functional property. This sedimentation-velocity technique readily
separates proteins differing in sedimentation coefficient by a factor of two
or more.
The mass of a protein can be directly determined by sedimentation equilibrium, in which a sample is centrifuged at relatively low speed so that sedimentation is counterbalanced by diffusion. The sedimentation-equilibrium
technique for determining mass is very accurate and can be applied under nondenaturing conditions in which the native quaternary structure of multimeric
proteins is preserved. In contrast, SDS–polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis
(Section 4.1.4) provides an estimate of the mass of dissociated polypeptide
chains under denaturing conditions. Note that, if we know the mass of the
dissociated components of a multimeric protein as determined by SDS–
polyacrylamide analysis and the mass of the intact multimeric protein as determined by sedimentation equilibrium analysis, we can determine how
many copies of each polypeptide chain is present in the multimeric protein.
4.1.7 The Mass of a Protein Can Be Precisely
Determined by Mass Spectrometry
Mass spectrometry has been an established analytical technique in organic
chemistry for many years. Until recently, however, the very low volatility
of proteins made mass spectrometry useless for the investigation of these
molecules. This difficulty has been circumvented by the introduction of
techniques for effectively dispersing proteins and other macromolecules
into the gas phase. These methods are called matrix-assisted laser desorption–ionization (MALDI) and electrospray spectrometry. We will focus on

MALDI spectrometry. In this technique, protein ions are generated and
then accelerated through an electrical field (Figure 4.16). They travel
through the flight tube, with the smallest traveling fastest and arriving at
the detector first. Thus, the time of flight (TOF) in the electrical field is a
measure of the mass (or, more precisely, the mass/charge ratio). Tiny
amounts of biomolecules, as small as a few picomoles (pmol) to femtomoles

for a mixture of the proteins insulin and ␤-lactoglobulin is shown in Figure
4.17. The masses determined by MALDI-TOF are 5733.9 and 18,364, respectively, compared with calculated values of 5733.5 and 18,388. MALDITOF is indeed an accurate means of determining protein mass.

Mass spectrometry has permitted the development of peptide mass fingerprinting. This technique for identifying peptides has greatly enhanced the
utility of two-dimensional gels. Two-dimensional electrophoresis is performed as described in Section 4.1.4. The sample of interest is extracted and
cleaved specifically by chemical or enzymatic means. The masses of the protein fragments are then determined with the use of mass spectrometry. Finally, the peptide masses, or fingerprint, are matched against the fingerprint
found in databases of proteins that have been “electronically cleaved” by a
computer simulating the same fragmentation technique used for the experimental sample. This technique has provided some outstanding results. For
example, of 150 yeast proteins analyzed with the use of two-dimensional
gels, peptide mass fingerprinting unambiguously identified 80%. Mass
spectrometry has provided name tags for many of the proteins in twodimensional gels.

Amino Acid Sequence Determination

4.2 AMINO ACID SEQUENCES CAN BE DETERMINED
BY AUTOMATED EDMAN DEGRADATION
The protein of interest having been purified and its mass determined, the
next analysis usually performed is to determine the protein’s amino acid sequence, or primary structure. As stated previously (Section 3.2.1), a wealth
of information about a protein’s function and evolutionary history can often be obtained from the primary structure. Let us examine first how we
can sequence a simple peptide, such as
Ala-Gly-Asp-Phe-Arg-Gly
The first step is to determine the amino acid composition of the peptide.
The peptide is hydrolyzed into its constituent amino acids by heating it in
6 N HCl at 110°C for 24 hours. Amino acids in hydrolysates can be separated by ion-exchange chromatography on columns of sulfonated polystyrene. The identity of the amino acid is revealed by its elution volume,
which is the volume of buffer used to remove the amino acid from the column (Figure 4.18), and quantified by reaction with ninhydrin. Amino acids
treated with ninhydrin give an intense blue color, except for proline, which
gives a yellow color because it contains a secondary amino group. The concentration of an amino acid in a solution, after heating with ninhydrin, is
proportional to the optical absorbance of the solution. This technique can
detect a microgram (10 nmol) of an amino acid, which is about the amount

in a peptide hydrolysate can be separated
by ion-exchange chromatography on a
sulfonated polystyrene resin (such as
Dowex-50). Buffers (in this case, sodium
citrate) of increasing pH are used to elute
the amino acids from the column. The
amount of each amino acid present is
determined from the absorbance.
Aspartate, which has an acidic side chain,
is first to emerge, whereas arginine, which
has a basic side chain, is the last. The
original peptide is revealed to be
composed of one aspartate, one alanine,
one phenylalanine, one arginine, and two
glycine residues.

present in a thumbprint. As little as a nanogram (10 pmol) of an amino acid
can be detected by replacing ninhydrin with fluorescamine, which reacts with
the ␣-amino group to form a highly fluorescent product (Figure 4.19). A
comparison of the chromatographic patterns of our sample hydrolysate with
that of a standard mixture of amino acids would show that the amino acid
composition of the peptide is
(Ala, Arg, Asp, Gly2, Phe)
The parentheses denote that this is the amino acid composition of the peptide, not its sequence.
The next step is often to identify the N-terminal amino acid by labeling
it with a compound that forms a stable covalent bond. Fluorodinitrobenzene
(FDNB) was first used for this purpose by Frederick Sanger. Dabsyl chloride is now commonly used because it forms fluorescent derivatives that can
be detected with high sensitivity. It reacts with an uncharged ␣-NH2 group
to form a sulfonamide derivative that is stable under conditions that hydrolyze peptide bonds (Figure 4.20). Hydrolysis of our sample dabsyl–
peptide in 6 N HCl would yield a dabsyl–amino acid, which could be identified as dabsyl–alanine by its chromatographic properties. Dansyl chloride,
too, is a valuable labeling reagent because it forms fluorescent sulfonamides.

Although the dabsyl method for determining the amino-terminal
residue is sensitive and powerful, it cannot be used repeatedly on the same
peptide, because the peptide is totally degraded in the acid-hydrolysis step
and thus all sequence information is lost. Pehr Edman devised a method for
labeling the amino-terminal residue and cleaving it from the peptide without disrupting the peptide bonds between the other amino acid residues.
The Edman degradation sequentially removes one residue at a time from the
amino end of a peptide (Figure 4.21). Phenyl isothiocyanate reacts with the
uncharged terminal amino group of the peptide to form a phenylthiocarbamoyl derivative. Then, under mildly acidic conditions, a cyclic derivative
of the terminal amino acid is liberated, which leaves an intact peptide shortened by one amino acid. The cyclic compound is a phenylthiohydantoin

(PTH)–amino acid, which can be identified by chromatographic procedures. The Edman procedure can then be repeated on the shortened peptide, yielding another PTH–amino acid, which can again be identified by
chromatography. Three more rounds of the Edman degradation will reveal
the complete sequence of the original peptide pentapeptide.
The development of automated sequencers has markedly decreased the
time required to determine protein sequences. One cycle of the Edman
degradation—the cleavage of an amino acid from a peptide and its identification—is carried out in less than 1 hour. By repeated degradations, the
amino acid sequence of some 50 residues in a protein can be determined.
High-pressure liquid chromatography provides a sensitive means of distinguishing the various amino acids (Figure 4.22). Gas-phase sequenators can
analyze picomole quantities of peptides and proteins. This high sensitivity
makes it feasible to analyze the sequence of a protein sample eluted from a
single band of an SDS–polyacrylamide gel.

4.2.1 Proteins Can Be Specifically Cleaved into Small Peptides
to Facilitate Analysis
In principle, it should be possible to sequence an entire protein by using the
Edman method. In practice, the peptides cannot be much longer than about
50 residues. This is so because the reactions of the Edman method, especially the release step, are not 100% efficient, and so not all peptides in the
reaction mixture release the amino acid derivative at each step. For instance,
if the efficiency of release for each round were 98%, the proportion of “correct” amino acid released after 60 rounds would be (0.9860), or 0.3—a hopelessly impure mix. This obstacle can be circumvented by cleaving the original protein at specific amino acids into smaller peptides that can be
sequenced. In essence, the strategy is to divide and conquer.
Specific cleavage can be achieved by chemical or enzymatic methods.
For example, cyanogen bromide (CNBr) splits polypeptide chains only on
the carboxyl side of methionine residues (Figure 4.23).

A protein that has 10 methionine residues will usually yield 11 peptides on

a proteolytic enzyme from pancreatic juice. Trypsin cleaves polypeptide
chains on the carboxyl side of arginine and lysine residues (Figure 4.24 and
Section 9.1.4). A protein that contains 9 lysine and 7 arginine residues will
usually yield 17 peptides on digestion with trypsin. Each of these tryptic

peptides, except for the carboxyl-terminal peptide of the protein, will end
with either arginine or lysine. Table 4.3 gives several other ways of specifically cleaving polypeptide chains.
The peptides obtained by specific chemical or enzymatic cleavage are
separated by some type of chromatography. The sequence of each purified
peptide is then determined by the Edman method. At this point, the amino
acid sequences of segments of the protein are known, but the order of these
segments is not yet defined. How can we order the peptides to obtain the
primary structure of the original protein? The necessary additional information is obtained from overlap peptides (Figure 4.25). A second enzyme is
used to split the polypeptide chain at different linkages. For example, chymotrypsin cleaves preferentially on the carboxyl side of aromatic and some
other bulky nonpolar residues (Section 9.1.3). Because these chymotryptic
peptides overlap two or more tryptic peptides, they can be used to establish
the order of the peptides. The entire amino acid sequence of the polypeptide chain is then known.

Additional steps are necessary if the initial protein sample is actually several polypeptide chains. SDS–gel electrophoresis under reducing conditions
should display the number of chains. Alternatively, the number of distinct

or more polypeptide chains held together by noncovalent bonds, denaturing agents, such as urea or guanidine hydrochloride, are used to dissociate

The peptide obtained by chymotrypic

the chains from one another. The dissociated chains must be separated from
one another before sequence determination of the individual chains can begin. Polypeptide chains linked by disulfide bonds are separated by reduction with thiols such as ␤-mercaptoethanol or dithiothreitol. To prevent the
cysteine residues from recombining, they are then alkylated with iodoacetate to form stable S-carboxymethyl derivatives (Figure 4.26). Sequencing
can then be performed as heretofore described.
To complete our understanding of the protein’s structure, we need to determine the positions of the original disulfide bonds. This information can
be obtained by using a diagonal electrophoresis technique to isolate the peptide sequences containing such bonds (Figure 4.27). First, the protein is
specifically cleaved into peptides under conditions in which the disulfides
remain intact. The mixture of peptides is applied to a corner of a sheet of
paper and subjected to electrophoresis in a single lane along one side. The
resulting sheet is exposed to vapors of performic acid, which cleaves disulfides and converts them into cysteic acid residues. Peptides originally linked
by disulfides are now independent and more acidic because of the formation of an SO3⫺ group.

This mixture is subjected to electrophoresis in the perpendicular direction
under the same conditions as those of the first electrophoresis. Peptides that
were devoid of disulfides will have the same mobility as before, and consequently all will be located on a single diagonal line. In contrast, the newly
formed peptides containing cysteic acid will usually migrate differently from
their parent disulfide-linked peptides and hence will lie off the diagonal.
These peptides can then be isolated and sequenced, and the location of the
disulfide bond can be established.

4.2.2 Amino Acid Sequences Are Sources
of Many Kinds of Insight
A protein’s amino acid sequence, once determined, is a valuable source of
insight into the protein’s function, structure, and history.
1. The sequence of a protein of interest can be compared with all other known
sequences to ascertain whether significant similarities exist. Does this protein
belong to one of the established families? A search for kinship between a newly
sequenced protein and the thousands of previously sequenced ones takes

7552dc04_77-116

4/23/01

8:07 AM

Page 97

97

only a few seconds on a personal computer (Section 7.2). If the newly isolated protein is a member of one of the established classes of protein, we can
begin to infer information about the protein’s function. For instance, chymotrypsin and trypsin are members of the serine protease family, a clan of
proteolytic enzymes that have a common catalytic mechanism based on a
reactive serine residue (Section 9.1.4). If the sequence of the newly isolated
protein shows sequence similarity with trypsin or chymotrypsin, the result
suggests that it may be a serine protease.
2. Comparison of sequences of the same protein in different species yields a
wealth of information about evolutionary pathways. Genealogical relations
between species can be inferred from sequence differences between their
proteins. We can even estimate the time at which two evolutionary lines diverged, thanks to the clocklike nature of random mutations. For example, a
comparison of serum albumins found in primates indicates that human beings and African apes diverged 5 million years ago, not 30 million years ago
as was once thought. Sequence analyses have opened a new perspective on
the fossil record and the pathway of human evolution.
3. Amino acid sequences can be searched for the presence of internal repeats.
Such internal repeats can reveal information about the history of an individual protein itself. Many proteins apparently have arisen by duplication
of a primordial gene followed by its diversification. For example, calmodulin, a ubiquitous calcium sensor in eukaryotes, contains four similar
calcium-binding modules that arose by gene duplication (Figure 4.28).
4. Many proteins contain amino acid sequences that serve as signals designating their destinations or controlling their processing. A protein destined for
export from a cell or for location in a membrane, for example, contains a
signal sequence, a stretch of about 20 hydrophobic residues near the amino
terminus that directs the protein to the appropriate membrane. Another
protein may contain a stretch of amino acids that functions as a nuclear localization signal, directing the protein to the nucleus.
5. Sequence data provide a basis for preparing antibodies specific for a protein of interest. Careful examination of the amino acid sequence of a protein
can reveal which sequences will be most likely to elicit an antibody when
injected into a mouse or rabbit. Peptides with these sequences can be synthesized and used to generate antibodies to the protein. These specific antibodies can be very useful in determining the amount of a protein present
in solution or in the blood, ascertaining its distribution within a cell, or
cloning its gene (Section 4.3.3).
6. Amino acid sequences are valuable for making DNA probes that are specific for the genes encoding the corresponding proteins (Section 6.1.4). Knowledge of a protein’s primary structure permits the use of reverse genetics.
DNA probes that correspond to a part of the amino acid sequence can be
constructed on the basis of the genetic code. These probes can be used to
isolate the gene of the protein so that the entire sequence of the protein can
be determined. The gene in turn can provide valuable information about
the physiological regulation of the protein. Protein sequencing is an integral part of molecular genetics, just as DNA cloning is central to the analysis of protein structure and function.
4.2.3 Recombinant DNA Technology Has Revolutionized
Protein Sequencing
Hundreds of proteins have been sequenced by Edman degradation of peptides derived from specific cleavages. Nevertheless, heroic effort is required
to elucidate the sequence of large proteins, those with more than 1000

residues. For sequencing such proteins, a complementary experimental approach based on recombinant DNA technology is often more efficient. As
will be discussed in Chapter 6, long stretches of DNA can be cloned and
sequenced, and the nucleotide sequence directly reveals the amino acid sequence of the protein encoded by the gene (Figure 4.29). Recombinant
DNA technology is producing a wealth of amino acid sequence information
at a remarkable rate.

FIGURE 4.29 DNA sequence yields the amino acid sequence. The complete nucleotide
sequence of HIV-1 (human immunodeficiency virus), the cause of AIDS (acquired immune
deficiency syndrome), was determined within a year after the isolation of the virus. A part
of the DNA sequence specified by the RNA genome of the virus is shown here with the
corresponding amino acid sequence (deduced from a knowledge of the genetic code).

Even with the use of the DNA base sequence to determine primary structure, there is still a need to work with isolated proteins. The amino acid
sequence deduced by reading the DNA sequence is that of the nascent protein, the direct product of the translational machinery. Many proteins are
modified after synthesis. Some have their ends trimmed, and others arise
by cleavage of a larger initial polypeptide chain. Cysteine residues in some
proteins are oxidized to form disulfide links, connecting either parts within
a chain or separate polypeptide chains. Specific side chains of some proteins
are altered. Amino acid sequences derived from DNA sequences are rich in
information, but they do not disclose such posttranslational modifications.
Chemical analyses of proteins in their final form are needed to delineate the
nature of these changes, which are critical for the biological activities of most
proteins. Thus, genomic and proteomic analyses are complementary approaches
to elucidating the structural basis of protein function.

4.3 IMMUNOLOGY PROVIDES IMPORTANT TECHNIQUES
WITH WHICH TO INVESTIGATE PROTEINS
Immunological methods have become important tools used to purify a protein, locate it in the cell, or quantify how much of the protein is present.
These methods are predicated on the exquisite specificity of antibodies for
their target proteins. Labeled antibodies provide a means to tag a specific
protein so that it can be isolated, quantified, or visualized.
4.3.1 Antibodies to Specific Proteins Can Be Generated
Immunological techniques begin with the generation of antibodies to a particular protein. An antibody (also called an immunoglobulin, Ig) is a protein
synthesized by an animal in response to the presence of a foreign substance,
called an antigen, and normally functions to protect the animal from infection (Chapter 33). Antibodies have specific and high affinity for the antigens that elicited their synthesis. Proteins, polysaccharides, and nucleic
acids can be effective antigens. An antibody recognizes a specific group or
cluster of amino acids on a large molecule called an antigenic determinant,
or epitope (Figures 4.30 and 4.31). Small foreign molecules, such as synthetic peptides, also can elicit antibodies, provided that the small molecule
contains a recognized epitope and is attached to a macromolecular carrier.
The small foreign molecule itself is called a hapten. Animals have a very

large repertoire of antibody-producing cells, each producing an antibody of
a single specificity. An antigen acts by stimulating the proliferation of the
small number of cells that were already forming an antibody capable of recognizing the antigen (Chapter 33).
Immunological techniques depend on our being able to generate antibodies to a specific antigen. To obtain antibodies that recognize a particular protein, a biochemist injects the protein into a rabbit twice, 3 weeks apart.

(A) IgG antibodies consist of four chains,
two heavy chains (blue) and two light
chains (red), linked by disulfide bonds.
The heavy and light chains come together
to form Fab domains, which have the
antigen-binding sites at the ends. The two
heavy chains form the Fc domain. The Fab
domains are linked to the Fc domain by
flexible linkers. (B) A more schematic

case lysozyme, binds to the end of an

Polyclonal Antibodies

Monoclonal Antibodies

The injected protein stimulates the reproduction of cells producing antibodies that recognize the foreign substance. Blood is drawn from the immunized rabbit several weeks later and centrifuged to separate blood cells
from the supernatant, or serum. The serum, called an antiserum, contains
antibodies to all antigens to which the rabbit has been exposed. Only some
of them will be antibodies to the injected protein. Moreover, antibodies of
a given specificity are not a single molecular species. For instance, 2,4dinitrophenol (DNP) has been used as a hapten to generate antibodies to
DNP. Analyses of anti-DNP antibodies revealed a wide range of binding
affinities—the dissociation constants ranged from about 0.1 nM to 1 ␮M.
Correspondingly, a large number of bands were evident when anti-DNP
antibody was subjected to isoelectric focusing. These results indicate that
cells are producing many different antibodies, each recognizing a different
surface feature of the same antigen. The antibodies are heterogeneous, or
polyclonal (Figure 4.32). This heterogeneity is a barrier, which can complicate the use of these antibodies.

4.3.2 Monoclonal Antibodies with Virtually Any Desired
Specificity Can Be Readily Prepared
FIGURE 4.32 Polyclonal and

have several epitopes. Polyclonal
antibodies are heterogeneous mixtures of
antibodies, each specific for one of the
various epitopes on an antigen.
Monoclonal antibodies are all identical,

epitope. [After R. A. Goldsby, T. J. Kindt, B. A.

The discovery of a means of producing monoclonal antibodies of virtually
any desired specificity was a major breakthrough that intensified the power
of immunological approaches. Just as working with impure proteins makes
it difficult to interpret data and understand function, so too does working
with an impure mixture of antibodies. The ideal would be to isolate a clone
of cells that produce only a single antibody. The problem is that antibodyproducing cells isolated from an organism die in a short time.
Immortal cell lines that produce monoclonal antibodies do exist. These
cell lines are derived from a type of cancer, multiple myeloma, a malignant
disorder of antibody-producing cells. In this cancer, a single transformed
plasma cell divides uncontrollably, generating a very large number of cells
of a single kind. They are a clone because they are descended from the same
cell and have identical properties. The identical cells of the myeloma secrete
large amounts of normal immunoglobulin of a single kind generation after
generation. A myeloma can be transplanted from one mouse to another,
where it continues to proliferate. These antibodies were useful for elucidating antibody structure, but nothing is known about their specificity and so
they are useless for the immunological methods described in the next pages.
Cesar Milstein and Georges Köhler discovered that large amounts of
homogeneous antibody of nearly any desired specificity could be obtained by
fusing a short-lived antibody-producing cell with an immortal myeloma cell.
An antigen is injected into a mouse, and its spleen is removed several weeks
later (Figure 4.33). A mixture of plasma cells from this spleen is fused in
vitro with myeloma cells. Each of the resulting hybrid cells, called hybridoma
cells, indefinitely produces homogeneous antibody specified by the parent
cell from the spleen. Hybridoma cells can then be screened, by using some
sort of assay for the antigen–antibody interaction, to determine which ones
produce antibody having the desired specificity. Collections of cells shown
to produce the desired antibody are subdivided and reassayed. This process
is repeated until a pure cell line, a clone producing a single antibody, is isolated. These positive cells can be grown in culture medium or injected into
mice to induce myelomas. Alternatively, the cells can be frozen and stored
for long periods.
The hybridoma method of producing monoclonal antibodies has opened
new vistas in biology and medicine. Large amounts of homogeneous antibod-

ies with tailor-made specificities can be readily prepared. They are sources of
insight into relations between antibody structure and specificity. Moreover,
monoclonal antibodies can serve as precise analytical and preparative reagents.
For example, a pure antibody can be obtained against an antigen that has
not yet been isolated (Section 4.4). Proteins that guide development have
been identified with the use of monoclonal antibodies as tags (Figure 4.34).
Monoclonal antibodies attached to solid supports can be used as affinity
columns to purify scarce proteins. This method has been used to purify interferon (an antiviral protein) 5000-fold from a crude mixture. Clinical laboratories are using monoclonal antibodies in many assays. For example, the
detection in blood of isozymes that are normally localized in the heart points
to a myocardial infarction (heart attack). Blood transfusions have been made
safer by antibody screening of donor blood for viruses that cause AIDS (acquired immune deficiency syndrome), hepatitis, and other infectious diseases. Monoclonal antibodies are also being evaluated for use as therapeutic agents, as in the treatment of cancer. Furthermore, the vast repertoire of
antibody specificity can be tapped to generate catalytic antibodies having
novel features not found in naturally occurring enzymes.

an Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay

immunosorbent assay (ELISA). In this method, an enzyme, which reacts with
a colorless substrate to produce a colored product, is covalently linked to a
specific antibody that recognizes a target antigen. If the antigen is present,
the antibody–enzyme complex will bind to it, and the enzyme component
of the antibody–enzyme complex will catalyze the reaction generating the
colored product. Thus, the presence of the colored product indicates the
presence of the antigen. Such an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay,
which is rapid and convenient, can detect less than a nanogram (10⫺9 g) of
a protein. ELISA can be performed with either polyclonal or monoclonal
antibodies, but the use of monoclonal antibodies yields more reliable results.
We will consider two among the several types of ELISA. The indirect ELISA is used to detect the presence of antibody and is the basis
of the test for HIV infection. In that test, viral core proteins (the antigen)
are absorbed to the bottom of a well. Antibodies from a patient are then
added to the coated well and allowed to bind to the antigen. Finally, enzyme-linked antibodies to human antibodies (for instance, goat antibodies
that recognize human antibodies) are allowed to react in the well and unbound antibodies are removed by washing. Substrate is then applied. An
enzyme reaction suggests that the enzyme-linked antibodies were bound to
human antibodies, which in turn implies that the patient had antibodies to
the viral antigen (Figure 4.35).
The sandwich ELISA allows both the detection and the quantitation of
antigen. Antibody to a particular antigen is first absorbed to the bottom of
a well. Next, the antigen (or blood or urine containing the antigen) is added
to the well and binds to the antibody. Finally, a second, different antibody
to the antigen is added. This antibody is enzyme linked and is processed as
described for indirect ELISA. In this case, the extent of reaction is directly
proportional to the amount of antigen present. Consequently, it permits the
measurement of small quantities of antigen (see Figure 4.35).

4.3.4 Western Blotting Permits the Detection of Proteins
Separated by Gel Electrophoresis
Often it is necessary to detect small quantities of a particular protein in the
presence of many other proteins, such as a viral protein in the blood. Very
small quantities of a protein of interest in a cell or in body fluid can be detected by an immunoassay technique called Western blotting (Figure 4.36).
A sample is subjected to electrophoresis on an SDS–polyacrylamide gel.
Blotting (or more typically electroblotting) transfers the resolved proteins
on the gel to the surface of a polymer sheet to make them more accessible
for reaction. An antibody that is specific for the protein of interest is added
to the sheet and reacts with the antigen. The antibody–antigen complex on
the sheet then can be detected by rinsing the sheet with a second antibody
specific for the first (e.g., goat antibody that recognizes mouse antibody).
A radioactive label on the second antibody produces a dark band on x-ray
film (an autoradiogram). Alternatively, an enzyme on the second antibody
generates a colored product, as in the ELISA method. Western blotting
makes it possible to find a protein in a complex mixture, the proverbial needle in a haystack. It is the basis for the test for infection by hepatitis C, where
it is used to detect a core protein of the virus. This technique is also very
useful in the cloning of genes.

4.3.5 Fluorescent Markers Make Possible the Visualization
of Proteins in the Cell
Biochemistry is often performed in test tubes or polyacrylamide gels. However, most proteins function in the context of a cell. Fluorescent markers
provide a powerful means of examining proteins in their biological context.
For instance, cells can be stained with fluorescence-labeled antibodies or
other fluorescent proteins and examined by fluorescence microscopy to reveal
the location of a protein of interest. Arrays of parallel bundles are evident
in cells stained with antibody specific for actin, a protein that polymerizes
into filaments (Figure 4.37). Actin filaments are constituents of the cytoskeleton, the internal scaffolding of cells that controls their shape and
movement. By tracking protein location, fluorescent markers also provide
clues to protein function. For instance, the glucocorticoid receptor protein
is a transcription factor that controls gene expression in response to the
steroid hormone cortisone. The receptor was linked to green fluorescent

protein (GPF), a naturally fluorescent protein isolated from the jellyfish
Aequorea victoria (Section 3.6.5). Fluorescence microscopy revealed that, in
the absence of the hormone, the receptor is located in the cytoplasm
(Figure 4.38A). On addition of the steroid, the receptor is translocated to
the nucleus, where it binds to DNA (Figure 4.38B).
The highest resolution of fluorescence microscopy is about 0.2 ␮m
(200 nm, or 2000 Å), the wavelength of visible light. Finer spatial resolution
can be achieved by electron microscopy by using antibodies tagged with
electron-dense markers. For example, ferritin conjugated to an antibody
can be readily visualized by electron microscopy because it contains an
electron-dense core rich in iron. Clusters of gold also can be conjugated to
antibodies to make them highly visible under the electron microscope.
Immunoelectron microscopy can define the position of antigens to a resolution of 10 nm (100 Å) or finer (Figure 4.39).

4.4 PEPTIDES CAN BE SYNTHESIZED BY AUTOMATED
SOLID-PHASE METHODS
The ability to synthesize peptides of defined sequence is a powerful technique for extending biochemical analysis for several reasons.
1. Synthetic peptides can serve as antigens to stimulate the formation of specific antibodies. For instance, as discussed earlier, it is often more efficient
to obtain a protein sequence from a nucleic acid sequence than by sequencing the protein itself (see also Chapter 6). Peptides can be synthesized
on the basis of the nucleic acid sequence, and antibodies can be raised that

7552dc04_77-116

Page 105

105

target these peptides. These antibodies can then be used to isolate the intact protein from the cell.
2. Synthetic peptides can be used to isolate receptors for many hormones and
other signal molecules. For example, white blood cells are attracted to bacteria by formylmethionyl (fMet) peptides released in the breakdown of
bacterial proteins. Synthetic formylmethionyl peptides have been useful in
identifying the cell-surface receptor for this class of peptide. Moreover,
synthetic peptides can be attached to agarose beads to prepare affinity
chromatography columns for the purification of receptor proteins that
specifically recognize the peptides.
3. Synthetic peptides can serve as drugs. Vasopressin is a peptide hormone that stimulates the reabsorption of water in the distal tubules
of the kidney, leading to the formation of more concentrated urine. Patients
with diabetes insipidus are deficient in vasopressin (also called antidiuretic
hormone), and so they excrete large volumes of urine (more than 5 liters per
day) and are continually thirsty. This defect can be treated by administering 1-desamino-8-D-arginine vasopressin, a synthetic analog of the missing
hormone (Figure 4.40). This synthetic peptide is degraded in vivo much
more slowly than vasopressin and, additionally, does not increase the blood
pressure.

4. Finally, studying synthetic peptides can help define the rules governing the
three-dimensional structure of proteins. We can ask whether a particular sequence by itself folds into an ␣ helix, ␤ strand, or hairpin turn or behaves
as a random coil.
How are these peptides constructed? The amino group of one amino acid
is linked to the carboxyl group of another. However, a unique product is
formed only if a single amino group and a single carboxyl group are available for reaction. Therefore, it is necessary to block some groups and to

activate others to prevent unwanted reactions. The ␣-amino group of the
first amino acid of the desired peptide is blocked with a tert-butyloxycarbonyl (t-Boc) group, yielding a t-Boc amino acid. The carboxyl group of this
same amino acid is activated by reacting it with a reagent such as dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (DCC), as illustrated in Figure 4.41. The free amino group of
the next amino acid to be linked attacks the activated carboxyl, leading to
the formation of a peptide bond and the release of dicyclohexylurea. The carboxyl group of the resulting dipeptide is activated with DCC and reacted
with the free amino group of the amino acid that will be the third residue

synthesis is: (1) anchoring of the C-terminal amino acid, (2) deprotection of the amino
terminus, and (3) coupling of the next residue. Steps 2 and 3 are repeated for each added
amino acid. Finally, in step 4, the completed peptide is released from the resin.

in the peptide. This process is repeated until the desired peptide is synthesized. Exposing the peptide to dilute acid removes the t-Boc protecting group
from the first amino acid while leaving peptide bonds intact.
Peptides containing more than 100 amino acids can be synthesized by
sequential repetition of the preceding reactions. Linking the growing peptide chain to an insoluble matrix, such as polystyrene beads, further enhances efficiency. A major advantage of this solid-phase method is that the
desired product at each stage is bound to beads that can be rapidly filtered
and washed, and so there is no need to purify intermediates. All reactions
are carried out in a single vessel, eliminating losses caused by repeated transfers of products. The carboxyl-terminal amino acid of the desired peptide
sequence is first anchored to the polystyrene beads (Figure 4.42). The t-Boc
protecting group of this amino acid is then removed. The next amino acid
(in the protected t-Boc form) and dicyclohexylcarbodiimide, the coupling
agent, are added together. After the peptide bond forms, excess reagents
and dicyclohexylurea are washed away, leaving the desired dipeptide product attached to the beads. Additional amino acids are linked by the same
sequence of reactions. At the end of the synthesis, the peptide is released
from the beads by adding hydrofluoric acid (HF), which cleaves the carboxyl ester anchor without disrupting peptide bonds. Protecting groups on
potentially reactive side chains, such as that of lysine, also are removed at
this time. This cycle of reactions can be readily automated, which makes it
feasible to routinely synthesize peptides containing about 50 residues in
good yield and purity. In fact, the solid-phase method has been used to synthesize interferons (155 residues) that have antiviral activity and ribonuclease (124 residues) that is catalytically active.

Determination of
Three-Dimensional Structure

4.5 THREE-DIMENSIONAL PROTEIN STRUCTURE
CAN BE DETERMINED BY NMR SPECTROSCOPY
AND X-RAY CRYSTALLOGRAPHY
A crucial question is, What does the three-dimensional structure of a specific protein look like? Protein structure determines function, given that the
specificity of active sites and binding sites depends on the precise threedimensional conformation. Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy and
x-ray crystallography are two of the most important techniques for elucidating the conformation of proteins.

TABLE 4.4 Biologically important
nuclei giving NMR signals

4.5.1 Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy Can Reveal
the Structures of Proteins in Solution
Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is unique in being able to
reveal the atomic structure of macromolecules in solution, provided that
highly concentrated solutions (⬃1 mM, or 15 mg ml⫺1 for a 15-kd protein)
can be obtained. This technique depends on the fact that certain atomic nuclei are intrinsically magnetic. Only a limited number of isotopes display
this property, called spin, and the ones most important to biochemistry are
listed in Table 4.4. The simplest example is the hydrogen nucleus (1H),
which is a proton. The spinning of a proton generates a magnetic moment.
This moment can take either of two orientations, or spin states (called ␣ and
␤), when an external magnetic field is applied (Figure 4.43). The energy difference between these states is proportional to the strength of the imposed
magnetic field. The ␣ state has a slightly lower energy and hence is slightly
more populated (by a factor of the order of 1.00001 in a typical experiment)
because it is aligned with the field. A spinning proton in an ␣ state can be

raised to an excited state (␤ state) by applying a pulse of electromagnetic
radiation (a radio-frequency, or RF, pulse), provided the frequency corresponds to the energy difference between the ␣ and the ␤ states. In these
circumstances, the spin will change from ␣ to ␤; in other words, resonance
will be obtained. A resonance spectrum for a molecule can be obtained by
varying the magnetic field at a constant frequency of electromagnetic
radiation or by keeping the magnetic field constant and varying electromagnetic radiation.
These properties can be used to examine the chemical surroundings of
the hydrogen nucleus. The flow of electrons around a magnetic nucleus generates a small local magnetic field that opposes the applied field. The degree of such shielding depends on the surrounding electron density. Consequently, nuclei in different environments will change states, or resonate,
at slightly different field strengths or radiation frequencies. The nuclei of
the perturbed sample absorb electromagnetic radiation at a frequency that
can be measured. The different frequencies, termed chemical shifts, are expressed in fractional units ␦ (parts per million, or ppm) relative to the shifts
of a standard compound, such as a water-soluble derivative of tetramethysilane, that is added with the sample. For example, a –CH3 proton
typically exhibits a chemical shift (␦) of 1 ppm, compared with a chemical shift
of 7 ppm for an aromatic proton. The chemical shifts of most protons in
protein molecules fall between 0 and 9 ppm (Figure 4.44). It is possible
to resolve most protons in many proteins by using this technique of onedimensional NMR. With this information, we can then deduce changes to
a particular chemical group under different conditions, such as the conformational change of a protein from a disordered structure to an ␣ helix
in response to a change in pH.
We can garner even more information by examining how the spins on
different protons affect their neighbors. By inducing a transient magnetization in a sample through the application a radio-frequency pulse, it is possible to alter the spin on one nucleus and examine the effect on the spin of
a neighboring nucleus. Especially revealing is a two-dimensional spectrum
obtained by nuclear Overhauser enhancement spectroscopy (NOESY), which
graphically displays pairs of protons that are in close proximity, even if they
are not close together in the primary structure. The basis for this technique
is the nuclear Overhauser effect (NOE), an interaction between nuclei that
is proportional to the inverse sixth power of the distance between them.
Magnetization is transferred from an excited nucleus to an unexcited one if
they are less than about 5 Å apart (Figure 4.45A). In other words, the effect provides a means of detecting the location of atoms relative to one another in the three-dimensional structure of the protein. The diagonal of a
NOESY spectrum corresponds to a one-dimensional spectrum. The offdiagonal peaks provide crucial new information: they identify pairs of protons

amino acids is shown in Figure 4.46. The large number
of off-diagonal peaks reveals short proton–proton distances. The three-dimensional structure of a protein can
be reconstructed with the use of such proximity relations.
Structures are calculated such that protons that must be
separated by less than 5 Å on the basis of NOESY spectra are close to one another in the three-dimensional
structure (Figure 4.47). If a sufficient number of distance
constraints are applied, the three-dimensional structure
can be determined nearly uniquely. A family of related
structures is generated for three reasons (Figure 4.48).
First, not enough constraints may be experimentally
accessible to fully specify the structure. Second, the distances obtained from analysis of the NOESY spectrum
are only approximate. Finally, the experimental observations are made not on single molecules but on a large
number of molecules in solution that may have slightly
different structures at any given moment. Thus, the family of structures generated from NMR structure analysis
indicates the range of conformations for the protein in solution. At present, NMR spectroscopy can determine the
structures of only relatively small proteins (⬍40 kd), but
its revolving power is certain to increase. The power of

NMR has been greatly enhanced by the ability to produce proteins labeled
uniformly or at specific sites with 13C, 15N, and 2H with the use of recombinant DNA technology (Chapter 6).
4.5.2 X-Ray Crystallography Reveals Three-Dimensional
Structure in Atomic Detail

FIGURE 4.48 A family of structures. A

domain from a zinc-finger-DNA-binding
protein. The red line traces the average
course of the protein backbone. Each of
these structures is consistent with
hundreds of constraints derived from NMR
experiments. The differences between the
individual structures are due to a
combination of imperfections in the
experimental data and the dynamic nature

X-ray crystallography provides the finest visualization of protein structure
currently available. This technique can reveal the precise three-dimensional
positions of most atoms in a protein molecule. The use of x-rays provides the
best resolution because the wavelength of x-rays is about the same length as
that of a covalent bond. The three components in an x-ray crystallographic
analysis are a protein crystal, a source of x-rays, and a detector (Figure 4.49).
The technique requires that all molecules be precisely oriented, so the first
step is to obtain crystals of the protein of interest. Slowly adding ammonium
sulfate or another salt to a concentrated solution of protein to reduce its solubility favors the formation of highly ordered crystals. This is the process of
salting out discussed in Section 4.1.3. For example, myoglobin crystallizes in
3 M ammonium sulfate (Figure 4.50). Some proteins crystallize readily,
whereas others do so only after much effort has been expended in identifying the right conditions. Crystallization is an art; the best practitioners have
great perseverance and patience. Increasingly large and complex proteins are
being crystallized. For example, poliovirus, an 8500-kd assembly of 240 protein subunits surrounding an RNA core, has been crystallized and its structure solved by x-ray methods. Crucially, protein crystals frequently display
their biological activity, indicating that the proteins have crystallized in their
biologically active configuration. For instance, enzyme crystals may display
catalytic activity if the crystals are suffused with substrate.
Next, a source of x-rays is required. A beam of x-rays of wavelength
1.54 Å is produced by accelerating electrons against a copper target. A narrow beam of x-rays strikes the protein crystal. Part of the beam goes straight
through the crystal; the rest is scattered in various directions. Finally, these
scattered, or diffracted, x-rays are detected by x-ray film, the blackening of
the emulsion being proportional to the intensity of the scattered x-ray beam,
or by a solid-state electronic detector. The scattering pattern provides abundant information about protein structure. The basic physical principles
underlying the technique are:
1. Electrons scatter x-rays. The amplitude of the wave scattered by an atom
is proportional to its number of electrons. Thus, a carbon atom scatters six
times as strongly as a hydrogen atom does.
2. The scattered waves recombine. Each atom contributes to each scattered
beam. The scattered waves reinforce one another at the film or detector if they
are in phase (in step) there, and they cancel one another if they are out of phase.

crystallographic experiment: an x-ray
beam, a crystal, and a detector.

3. The way in which the scattered waves recombine depends only on the atomic
arrangement.

The protein crystal is mounted and positioned in a precise orientation
with respect to the x-ray beam and the film. The crystal is rotated so that
the beam can strike the crystal from many directions. This rotational motion results in an x-ray photograph consisting of a regular array of spots
called reflections. The x-ray photograph shown in Figure 4.51 is a twodimensional section through a three-dimensional array of 25,000 spots. The
intensity of each spot is measured. These intensities and their positions are
the basic experimental data of an x-ray crystallographic analysis. The next
step is to reconstruct an image of the protein from the observed intensities.
In light microscopy or electron microscopy, the diffracted beams are focused
by lenses to directly form an image. However, appropriate lenses for focusing x-rays do not exist. Instead, the image is formed by applying a mathematical relation called a Fourier transform. For each spot, this operation
yields a wave of electron density whose amplitude is proportional to the
square root of the observed intensity of the spot. Each wave also has a
phase—that is, the timing of its crests and troughs relative to those of other
waves. The phase of each wave determines whether the wave reinforces or
cancels the waves contributed by the other spots. These phases can be deduced from the well-understood diffraction patterns produced by electrondense heavy-atom reference markers such as uranium or mercury at specific
sites in the protein.
The stage is then set for the calculation of an electron-density map, which
gives the density of electrons at a large number of regularly spaced points
in the crystal. This three-dimensional electron-density distribution is represented by a series of parallel sections stacked on top of one another. Each
section is a transparent plastic sheet (or, more recently, a layer in a computer image) on which the electron-density distribution is represented by
contour lines (Figure 4.52), like the contour lines used in geological survey
maps to depict altitude (Figure 4.53). The next step is to interpret the electron-density map. A critical factor is the resolution of the x-ray analysis,
which is determined by the number of scattered intensities used in the
Fourier synthesis. The fidelity of the image depends on the resolution of the

Fourier synthesis, as shown by the optical analogy in Figure 4.54. A resolution of 6 Å reveals the course of the polypeptide chain but few other structural details. The reason is that polypeptide chains pack together so that their
centers are between 5 Å and 10 Å apart. Maps at higher resolution are needed
to delineate groups of atoms, which lie between 2.8 Å and 4.0 Å apart, and
individual atoms, which are between 1.0 Å and 1.5 Å apart. The ultimate
resolution of an x-ray analysis is determined by the degree of perfection of
the crystal. For proteins, this limiting resolution is usually about 2 Å.
The structures of more than 10,000 proteins had been elucidated by
NMR and x-ray crystallography by mid-2000, and several new structures
are now determined each day. The coordinates are collected at the Protein
Data Bank (http://www.rcsb.org/pdb) and the structures can be accessed
for visualization and analysis. Knowledge of the detailed molecular architecture of proteins has been a source of insight into how proteins recognize
and bind other molecules, how they function as enzymes, how they fold,
and how they evolved. This extraordinarily rich harvest is continuing at a
rapid pace and is greatly influencing the entire field of biochemistry.

•

The rapid progress in gene sequencing has advanced another goal of biochemistry—elucidation of the proteome. The proteome is the complete
set of proteins expressed and includes information about how they are
modified, how they function, and how they interact with other molecules.

• The Purification of Proteins Is an Essential Step
in Understanding Their Function

Proteins can be separated from one another and from other molecules
on the basis of such characteristics as solubility, size, charge, and binding affinity. SDS–polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis separates the
polypeptide chains of proteins under denaturing conditions largely according to mass. Proteins can also be separated electrophoretically on
the basis of net charge by isoelectric focusing in a pH gradient. Ultracentrifugation and gel-filtration chromatography resolve proteins according to size, whereas ion-exchange chromatography separates them
mainly on the basis of net charge. The high affinity of many proteins
for specific chemical groups is exploited in affinity chromatography, in

7552dc04_77-116

which proteins bind to columns containing beads bearing covalently
linked substrates, inhibitors, or other specifically recognized groups.
The mass of a protein can be precisely determined by sedimentation
equilibrium measurements or by mass spectrometry.

• Amino Acid Sequences Can Be Determined
by Automated Edman Degradation

The amino acid composition of a protein can be ascertained by hydrolyzing it into its constituent amino acids in 6 N HCl at 110°C. The
amino acids can be separated by ion-exchange chromatography and
quantitated by reacting them with ninhydrin or fluorescamine. Amino
acid sequences can be determined by Edman degradation, which removes one amino acid at a time from the amino end of a peptide. Phenyl
isothiocyanate reacts with the terminal amino group to form a phenylthiocarbamoyl derivative, which cyclizes under mildly acidic conditions
to give a phenylthiohydantoin–amino acid and a peptide shortened by
one residue. Automated repeated Edman degradations by a sequenator
can analyze sequences of about 50 residues. Longer polypeptide chains
are broken into shorter ones for analysis by specifically cleaving them
with a reagent such as cyanogen bromide, which splits peptide bonds
on the carboxyl side of methionine residues. Enzymes such as trypsin,
which cleaves on the carboxyl side of lysine and arginine residues, also
are very useful in splitting proteins. Amino acid sequences are rich in
information concerning the kinship of proteins, their evolutionary relations, and diseases produced by mutations. Knowledge of a sequence
provides valuable clues to conformation and function.

• Immunology Provides Important Techniques with Which
to Investigate Proteins

Proteins can be detected and quantitated by highly specific antibodies;
monoclonal antibodies are especially useful because they are homogeneous. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays and Western blots of
SDS–polyacrylamide gels are used extensively. Proteins can also be
localized within cells by immunofluorescence microscopy and immunoelectron microscopy.

• Peptides Can Be Synthesized by Automated Solid-Phase Methods

Polypeptide chains can be synthesized by automated solid-phase methods in which the carboxyl end of the growing chain is linked to an insoluble support. The ␣-carboxyl group of the incoming amino acid is activated by dicyclohexylcarbodiimide and joined to the ␣-amino group of
the growing chain. Synthetic peptides can serve as drugs and as antigens
to stimulate the formation of specific antibodies. They can also be sources
of insight into relations between amino acid sequence and conformation.

• Three-Dimensional Protein Structure Can Be Determined
by NMR Spectroscopy and X-Ray Crystallography

Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy and x-ray crystallography
have greatly enriched our understanding of how proteins fold, recognize other molecules, and catalyze chemical reactions. Nuclear magnetic
resonance spectroscopy reveals the structure and dynamics of proteins
in solution. The chemical shift of nuclei depends on their local environment. Furthermore, the spins of neighboring nuclei interact with
each other in ways that provide definitive structural information.
X-ray crystallography is possible because electrons scatter x-rays;
the way in which the scattered waves recombine depends only on the
atomic arrangement. The three-dimensional structures of thousands of
proteins are now known in atomic detail.

5. A slow mover. Tropomyosin, a 93-kd muscle protein, sediments
more slowly than does hemoglobin (65 kd). Their sedimentation
coefficients are 2.6S and 4.31S, respectively. Which structural
feature of tropomyosin accounts for its slow sedimentation?

Performic acid

Chymotrypsin

Which one is the best suited for accomplishing each of the following tasks?
(a) Determination of the amino acid sequence of a small peptide.
(b) Identification of the amino-terminal residue of a peptide (of
which you have less than 0.1 ␮g).
(c) Reversible denaturation of a protein devoid of disulfide
bonds. Which additional reagent would you need if disulfide
bonds were present?
(d) Hydrolysis of peptide bonds on the carboxyl side of aromatic
residues.
(e) Cleavage of peptide bonds on the carboxyl side of methionines.
(f) Hydrolysis of peptide bonds on the carboxyl side of lysine

2. Finding an end. Anhydrous hydrazine (H2NONH2) has been
used to cleave peptide bonds in proteins. What are the reaction
products? How might this technique be used to identify the carboxyl-terminal amino acid?
3. Crafting a new breakpoint. Ethyleneimine reacts with cysteine
side chains in proteins to form S-aminoethyl derivatives. The
peptide bonds on the carboxyl side of these modified cysteine
residues are susceptible to hydrolysis by trypsin. Why?
4. Spectrometry. The absorbance A of a solution is defined as
A ⫽ log10 (I0/I)
in which I0 is the incident light intensity and I is the transmitted light intensity. The absorbance is related to the molar absorption coefficient (extinction coefficient) ⑀ (in M⫺1 cm⫺1),
concentration c (in M), and path length l (in cm) by

6. Sedimenting spheres. What is the dependence of the sedimentation coefficient S of a spherical protein on its mass? How much more
rapidly does an 80-kd protein sediment than does a 40-kd protein?
7. Size estimate. The relative electrophoretic mobilities of a
30-kd protein and a 92-kd protein used as standards on an
SDS–polyacrylamide gel are 0.80 and 0.41, respectively. What is the
apparent mass of a protein having a mobility of 0.62 on this gel?
8. A new partnership? The gene encoding a protein with a single disulfide bond undergoes a mutation that changes a serine
residue into a cysteine residue. You want to find out whether the
disulfide pairing in this mutant is the same as in the original protein. Propose an experiment to directly answer this question.
9. Sorting cells. Fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) is a
powerful technique for separating cells according to their content of particular molecules. For example, a fluorescence-labeled
antibody specific for a cell-surface protein can be used to detect
cells containing such a molecule. Suppose that you want to isolate cells that possess a receptor enabling them to detect bacterial degradation products. However, you do not yet have an
antibody directed against this receptor. Which fluorescencelabeled molecule would you prepare to identify such cells?
10. Column choice. (a) The octapeptide AVGWRVKS was digested with the enzyme trypsin. Would ion exchange or molecular exclusion be most appropriate for separating the products?
Explain. (b) Suppose that the peptide was digested with chymotrypsin. What would be the optimal separation technique?
Explain.
11. Making more enzyme? In the course of purifying an enzyme,
a researcher performs a purification step that results in an increase in the total activity to a value greater than that present in
the original crude extract. Explain how the amount of total activity might increase.

CHAPTER 5

DNA, RNA, and the Flow
of Genetic Information

Having genes in common accounts for the resemblance of a
mother and her daughters. Genes must be expressed to exert an
effect, and proteins regulate such expression. One such regulatory
protein, a zinc-finger protein (zinc ion is blue, protein is red), is
shown bound to a control or promoter region of DNA (black).

DNA and RNA are long linear polymers, called nucleic acids, that carry information in a form that can be passed from one generation to the next.
These macromolecules consist of a large number of linked nucleotides, each
composed of a sugar, a phosphate, and a base. Sugars linked by phosphates
form a common backbone, whereas the bases vary among
four kinds. Genetic information is stored in the sequence of

CHAPTER 5 • DNA, RNA, and the Flow
of Genetic Information

ribosomal RNA (rRNA), are part of the protein-synthesizing machinery. All
forms of cellular RNA are synthesized by RNA polymerases that take instructions from DNA templates. This process of transcription is followed by
translation, the synthesis of proteins according to instructions given by
mRNA templates. Thus, the flow of genetic information, or gene expression,
in normal cells is:
Transcription

Translation

DNA 8888888888n RNA 8888888888n Protein
This flow of information is dependent on the genetic code, which defines the relation between the sequence of bases in DNA (or its mRNA transcript) and the sequence of amino acids in a protein. The code is nearly the
same in all organisms: a sequence of three bases, called a codon, specifies an
amino acid. Codons in mRNA are read sequentially by tRNA molecules,
which serve as adaptors in protein synthesis. Protein synthesis takes place
on ribosomes, which are complex assemblies of rRNAs and more than 50
kinds of proteins.
The last theme to be considered is the interrupted character of most eukaryotic genes, which are mosaics of nucleic acid sequences called introns
and exons. Both are transcribed, but introns are cut out of newly synthesized RNA molecules, leaving mature RNA molecules with continuous exons. The existence of introns and exons has crucial implications for the evolution of proteins.

OF BASES LINKED TO A SUGAR-PHOSPHATE BACKBONE
The nucleic acids DNA and RNA are well suited to function as the carriers
of genetic information by virtue of their covalent structures. These macromolecules are linear polymers built up from similar units connected end to
end (Figure 5.1). Each monomer unit within the polymer consists of three
components: a sugar, a phosphate, and a base. The sequence of bases uniquely
characterizes a nucleic acid and represents a form of linear information.

The sugar in deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) is deoxyribose. The deoxy prefix

by phosphodiester bridges. Specifically, the 3⬘-hydroxyl (3⬘-OH) group of
the sugar moiety of one nucleotide is esterified to a phosphate group, which
is, in turn, joined to the 5⬘-hydroxyl group of the adjacent sugar. The chain
of sugars linked by phosphodiester bridges is referred to as the backbone of
the nucleic acid (Figure 5.3). Whereas the backbone is constant in DNA
and RNA, the bases vary from one monomer to the next. Two of the bases

are derivatives of purine—adenine (A) and guanine (G)—and two of pyrimidine—cytosine (C) and thymine (T, DNA only) or uracil (U, RNA only),
as shown in Figure 5.4.
RNA, like DNA, is a long unbranched polymer consisting of nucleotides
joined by 3⬘ n 5⬘ phosphodiester bonds (see Figure 5.3). The covalent
structure of RNA differs from that of DNA in two respects. As stated earlier and as indicated by its name, the sugar units in RNA are riboses rather
than deoxyriboses. Ribose contains a 2⬘-hydroxyl group not present in deoxyribose. As a consequence, in addition to the standard 3⬘ n 5⬘ linkage, a
2⬘ n 5⬘ linkage is possible for RNA. This later linkage is important in the
removal of introns and the joining of exons for the formation of mature RNA
(Section 28.x.x). The other difference, as already mentioned, is that one of
the four major bases in RNA is uracil (U) instead of thymine (T).
Note that each phosphodiester bridge has a negative charge. This negative charge repels nucleophilic species such as hydroxide ion; consequently,
phosphodiester linkages are much less susceptible to hydrolytic attack than
are other esters such as carboxylic acid esters. This resistance is crucial for
maintaining the integrity of information stored in nucleic acids. The absence of the 2⬘-hydroxyl group in DNA further increases its resistance to
hydrolysis. The greater stability of DNA probably accounts for its use rather
than RNA as the hereditary material in all modern cells and in many viruses.

5.1.2 Nucleotides Are the Monomeric Units of Nucleic Acids

CHAPTER 5 • DNA, RNA, and the Flow
of Genetic Information

STRUCTURAL INSIGHTS, Nucleic Acids offers a three-dimensional perspective on
nucleotide structure, base pairing, and other aspects of DNA and RNA structure.

A unit consisting of a base bonded to a sugar is referred to as a nucleoside.
The four nucleoside units in RNA are called adenosine, guanosine, cytidine,
and uridine, whereas those in DNA are called deoxyadenosine, deoxyguanosine, deoxycytidine, and thymidine. In each case, N-9 of a purine or N-1 of a
pyrimidine is attached to C-1 of the sugar (Figure 5.5). The base lies above
the plane of sugar when the structure is written in the standard orientation;
that is, the configuration of the N-glycosidic linkage is ␤. A nucleotide is a
nucleoside joined to one or more phosphate groups by an ester linkage. The
most common site of esterification in naturally occurring nucleotides is the
hydroxyl group attached to C-5 of the sugar. A compound formed by the
attachment of a phosphate group to the C-5 of a nucleoside sugar is called
a nucleoside 5-phosphate or a 5-nucleotide. For example, ATP is adenosine
5-triphosphate. Another nucleotide is deoxyguanosine 3-monophosphate
(3-dGMP; Figure 5.6). This nucleotide differs from ATP in that it contains guanine rather than adenine, contains deoxyribose rather than ribose
(indicated by the prefix “d”), contains one rather than three phosphates,
and has the phosphate esterified to the hydroxyl group in the 3 rather than
the 5 position. Nucleotides are the monomers that are linked to form RNA
and DNA. The four nucleotide units in DNA are called deoxyadenylate, deoxyguanylate, deoxycytidylate, and thymidylate. Note that thymidylate contains deoxyribose; by convention, the prefix deoxy is not added because
thymine-containing nucleotides are only rarely found in RNA.

The chain has a 5 end, which is usually
attached to a phosphate, and a 3 end,
which is usually a free hydroxyl group.

The abbreviated notations pApCpG or pACG denote a trinucleotide of
DNA consisting of the building blocks deoxyadenylate monophosphate, deoxycytidylate monophosphate, and deoxyguanylate monophosphate linked
by a phosphodiester bridge, where “p” denotes a phosphate group (Figure
5.7). The 5 end will often have a phosphate attached to the 5-OH group.
Note that, like a polypeptide (see Section 3.2), a DNA chain has polarity.
One end of the chain has a free 5-OH group (or a 5-OH group attached
to a phosphate), whereas the other end has a 3-OH group, neither of which
is linked to another nucleotide. By convention, the base sequence is written
in the 5-to-3 direction. Thus, the symbol ACG indicates that the unlinked
5-OH group is on deoxyadenylate, whereas the unlinked 3-OH group is
on deoxyguanylate. Because of this polarity, ACG and GCA correspond to
different compounds.

A striking characteristic of naturally occurring DNA molecules is their
length. A DNA molecule must comprise many nucleotides to carry the genetic information necessary for even the simplest organisms. For example,
the DNA of a virus such as polyoma, which can cause cancer in certain organisms, is 5100 nucleotides in length. We can quantify the information carrying capacity of nucleic acids in the following way. Each position can be
one of four bases, corresponding to two bits of information (22 ⫽ 4). Thus,
a chain of 5100 nucleotides corresponds to 2 ⫻ 5100 ⫽ 10,200 bits, or 1275
bytes (1 byte ⫽ 8 bits). The E. coli genome is a single DNA molecule consisting of two chains of 4.6 million nucleotides, corresponding to 9.2 million bits, or 1.15 megabytes, of information (Figure 5.8).
DNA molecules from higher organisms can be much larger. The human
genome comprises approximately 3 billion nucleotides, divided among 24
distinct DNA molecules (22 autosomes, x and y sex chromosomes) of different sizes. One of the largest known DNA molecules is found in the Indian muntjak, an Asiatic deer; its genome is nearly as large as the human
genome but is distributed on only 3 chromosomes (Figure 5.9). The largest
of these chromosomes has chains of more than 1 billion nucleotides. If such
a DNA molecule could be fully extended, it would stretch more than 1 foot
in length. Some plants contain even larger DNA molecules.

5.2 A PAIR OF NUCLEIC ACID CHAINS WITH
COMPLEMENTARY SEQUENCES CAN FORM A
DOUBLE-HELICAL STRUCTURE

3.4-Å spacing

The covalent structure of nucleic acids accounts for their ability to carry information in the form of a sequence of bases along a nucleic acid chain.
Other features of nucleic acid structure facilitate the process of replication—
that is, the generation of two copies of a nucleic acid from one. These features depend on the ability of the bases found in nucleic acids to form specific base pairs in such a way that a helical structure consisting of two strands
is formed. The double-helical structure of DNA facilitates the replication
of the genetic material (Section 5.2.2).
5.2.1 The Double Helix Is Stabilized by Hydrogen Bonds
and Hydrophobic Interactions
The existence of specific base-pairing interactions was discovered in the
course of studies directed at determining the three-dimensional structure of
DNA. Maurice Wilkins and Rosalind Franklin obtained x-ray diffraction
photographs of fibers of DNA (Figure 5.10). The characteristics of these
diffraction patterns indicated that DNA was formed of two chains that
wound in a regular helical structure. From these and other data, James Watson and Francis Crick inferred a structural model for DNA that accounted

The features of the Watson-Crick model of DNA deduced from the diffraction patterns are:

1. Two helical polynucleotide chains are coiled around a common axis. The
chains run in opposite directions.
2. The sugar-phosphate backbones are on the outside and, therefore, the
purine and pyrimidine bases lie on the inside of the helix.
3. The bases are nearly perpendicular to the helix axis, and adjacent bases
are separated by 3.4 Å. The helical structure repeats every 34 Å, so there
are 10 bases (⫽ 34 Å per repeat/3.4 Å per base) per turn of helix. There is
a rotation of 36 degrees per base (360 degrees per full turn/10 bases per
turn).

How is such a regular structure able to accommodate an arbitrary sequence of bases, given the different sizes and shapes of the purines and
pyrimidines? In attempting to answer this question, Watson and Crick discovered that guanine can be paired with cytosine and adenine with thymine
to form base pairs that have essentially the same shape (Figure 5.12). These
base pairs are held together by specific hydrogen bonds. This base-pairing
scheme was supported by earlier studies of the base composition of DNA
from different species. In 1950, Erwin Chargaff reported that the ratios of
adenine to thymine and of guanine to cytosine were nearly the same in all
species studied. Note in Table 5.1 that all the adenine:thymine and guanine:cytosine ratios are close to 1, whereas the adenine-to-guanine ratio
varies considerably. The meaning of these equivalences was not evident until the Watson-Crick model was proposed, when it became clear that they
represent an essential facet of DNA structure.
The spacing of approximately 3.4 Å between nearly parallel base pairs
is readily apparent in the DNA diffraction pattern (see Figure 5.10). The

stacking of bases one on top of another contributes to the stability of the
double helix in two ways (Figure 5.13). First, adjacent base pairs attract one
another through van der Waals forces (Section 1.3.1). Energies associated
with van der Waals interactions are quite small, such that typical interactions contribute from 0.5 to 1.0 kcal mol⫺1 per atom pair. In the double helix, however, a large number of atoms are in van der Waals contact, and the
net effect, summed over these atom pairs, is substantial. In addition, the
double helix is stabilized by the hydrophobic effect (Section 1.3.4): base
stacking, or hydrophobic interactions between the bases, results in the exposure of the more polar surfaces to the surrounding water. This arrangement is reminiscent of protein folding, where hydrophobic amino acids are
interior in the protein and hydrophilic are exterior (Section 3.4). Base stacking in DNA is also favored by the conformations of the relatively rigid fivemembered rings of the backbone sugars. The sugar rigidity affects both the
single-stranded and the double-helical forms.
5.2.2 The Double Helix Facilitates the Accurate Transmission
of Hereditary Information
The double-helical model of DNA and the presence of specific base pairs
immediately suggested how the genetic material might replicate. The sequence of bases of one strand of the double helix precisely determines the
sequence of the other strand; a guanine base on one strand is always paired
with a cytosine base on the other strand, and so on. Thus, separation of a
double helix into its two component chains would yield two single-stranded
templates onto which new double helices could be constructed, each of
which would have the same sequence of bases as the parent double helix.
Consequently, as DNA is replicated, one of the chains of each daughter
DNA molecule would be newly synthesized, whereas the other would be
passed unchanged from the parent DNA molecule. This distribution of
parental atoms is achieved by semiconservative replication.
Matthew Meselson and Franklin Stahl carried out a critical test of this
hypothesis in 1958. They labeled the parent DNA with 15N, a heavy isotope of nitrogen, to make it denser than ordinary DNA. The labeled DNA
was generated by growing E. coli for many generations in a medium that
contained 15NH4Cl as the sole nitrogen source. After the incorporation of
heavy nitrogen was complete, the bacteria were abruptly transferred to a
medium that contained 14N, the ordinary isotope of nitrogen. The question
asked was: What is the distribution of 14N and 15N in the DNA molecules
after successive rounds of replication?
The distribution of 14N and 15N was revealed by the technique of
density-gradient equilibrium sedimentation. A small amount of DNA was dissolved in a concentrated solution of cesium chloride having a density close to
that of the DNA (1.7 g cm⫺3). This solution was centrifuged until it was nearly
at equilibrium. The opposing processes of sedimentation and diffusion created
a gradient in the concentration of cesium chloride across the centrifuge cell.
The result was a stable density gradient, ranging from 1.66 to 1.76 g cm⫺3.
The DNA molecules in this density gradient were driven by centrifugal force
into the region where the solution’s density was equal to their own. The genomic DNA yielded a narrow band that was detected by its absorption of ultraviolet light. A mixture of 14N DNA and 15N DNA molecules gave clearly
separate bands because they differ in density by about 1% (Figure 5.14).
DNA was extracted from the bacteria at various times after they were
transferred from a 15N to a 14N medium and centrifuged. Analysis of these
samples showed that there was a single band of DNA after one generation.
The density of this band was precisely halfway between the densities of the

indicated that parental DNA was not preserved as an intact unit after replication. The absence of 14N DNA indicated that all the daughter DNA derived some of their atoms from the parent DNA. This proportion had to be
half because the density of the hybrid DNA band was halfway between the
densities of the 14N DNA and 15N DNA bands.
After two generations, there were equal amounts of two bands of DNA.
One was hybrid DNA, and the other was 14N DNA. Meselson and Stahl
concluded from these incisive experiments “that the nitrogen in a DNA molecule is divided equally between two physically continuous subunits; that
following duplication, each daughter molecule receives one of these; and that
the subunits are conserved through many duplications.” Their results agreed
perfectly with the Watson-Crick model for DNA replication (Figure 5.16).

During DNA replication and other processes, the two strands of the double helix must be separated from one another, at least in a local region. In
the laboratory, the double helix can be disrupted by heating a solution of
DNA. The heating disrupts the hydrogen bonds between base pairs and
thereby causes the strands to separate. The dissociation of the double helix
is often called melting because it occurs relatively abruptly at a certain temperature. The melting temperature (Tm) is defined as the temperature at
which half the helical structure is lost. Strands may also be separated by
adding acid or alkali to ionize the nucleotide bases and disrupt base pairing.
Stacked bases in nucleic acids absorb less ultraviolet light than do unstacked bases, an effect called hypochromism. Thus, the melting of nucleic

acids is easily followed by monitoring their absorption of light, which peaks
at a wavelength of 260 nm (Figure 5.17).
Separated complementary strands of nucleic acids spontaneously reassociate to form a double helix when the temperature is lowered below Tm.
This renaturation process is sometimes called annealing. The facility with
which double helices can be melted and then reassociated is crucial for the
biological functions of nucleic acids. Of course, inside cells, the double helix is not melted by the addition of heat. Instead, proteins called helicases
use chemical energy (from ATP) to disrupt the structure of double-stranded
nucleic acid molecules.
The ability to melt and reanneal DNA reversibly in the laboratory provides a powerful tool for investigating sequence similarity as well as gene
structure and expression. For instance, DNA molecules from two different
organisms can be melted and allowed to reanneal or hybridize in the presence of each other. If the sequences are similar, hybrid DNA duplexes, with
DNA from each organism contributing a strand of the double helix, can
form. Indeed, the degree of hybridization is an indication of the relatedness
of the genomes and hence the organisms. Similar hybridization experiments
with RNA and DNA can locate genes in a cell’s DNA that correspond to a
particular RNA. We will return to this important technique in Chapter 6.
5.2.4 Some DNA Molecules Are Circular and Supercoiled
The DNA molecules in human chromosomes are linear. However, electron
microscopic and other studies have shown that intact DNA molecules from
some other organisms are circular (Figure 5.18A). The term circular refers
to the continuity of the DNA chains, not to their geometrical form. DNA
molecules inside cells necessarily have a very compact shape. Note that the
E. coli chromosome, fully extended, would be about 1000 times as long as
the greatest diameter of the bacterium.
A new property appears in the conversion of a linear DNA molecule into
a closed circular molecule. The axis of the double helix can itself be twisted
into a superhelix (Figure 5.18B). A circular DNA molecule without any superhelical turns is known as a relaxed molecule. Supercoiling is biologically
important for two reasons. First, a supercoiled DNA molecule has a more
compact shape than does its relaxed counterpart. Second, supercoiling may hinder or favor the capacity of the double helix to unwind and thereby affects the
interactions between DNA and other molecules. These topological features of
DNA will be considered further in Section 27.x.x.

5.2.5 Single-Stranded Nucleic Acids Can Adopt
Elaborate Structures

CHAPTER 5 • DNA, RNA, and the Flow
of Genetic Information

Single-stranded nucleic acids often fold back on themselves to form well-defined structures. Early in evolutionary history, nucleic acids, particularly
RNA, may have adopted complex and diverse structures both to store genetic
information and to catalyze its transmission (Section 2.2.2). Such structures
are also important in all modern organisms in entities such as the ribosome,
a large complex of RNAs and proteins on which proteins are synthesized.

The simplest and most common structural motif formed is a stem-loop,
created when two complementary sequences within a single strand come together to form double-helical structures (Figure 5.19). In many cases, these
double helices are made up entirely of Watson-Crick base pairs. In other
cases, however, the structures include mismatched or unmatched (bulged)
bases. Such mismatches destabilize the local structure but introduce deviations from the standard double-helical structure that can be important for
higher-order folding and for function (Figure 5.20).

Single-stranded nucleic acids can adopt structures more complex than
simple stem-loops through the interaction of more widely separated bases.
Often, three or more bases may interact to stabilize these structures. In such
cases, hydrogen-bond donors and acceptors that do not participate in
Watson-Crick base pairs may participate in hydrogen bonds of nonstandard
pairings. Metal ions such as magnesium ion (Mg2⫹) often assist in the stabilization of these more elaborate structures.

DNA Replication

5.3 DNA IS REPLICATED BY POLYMERASES THAT
TAKE INSTRUCTIONS FROM TEMPLATES
We now turn to the molecular mechanism of DNA replication. The full
replication machinery in cells comprises more than 20 proteins engaged in
intricate and coordinated interplay. In 1958, Arthur Kornberg and his colleagues isolated the first known of the enzymes, called DNA polymerases,
that promote the formation of the bonds joining units of the DNA
backbone.
5.3.1 DNA Polymerase Catalyzes
Phosphodiester-Bond Formation
DNA polymerases catalyze the step-by-step addition of deoxyribonucleotide
units to a DNA chain (Figure 5.21). Importantly, the new DNA chain is assembled directly on a preexisting DNA template. The reaction catalyzed, in
its simplest form, is:
(DNA)n ⫹ dNTP 34 (DNA)n⫹1 ⫹ PPi
where dNTP stands for any deoxyribonucleotide and PPi is a pyrophosphate
molecule. The template can be a single strand of DNA or a double strand with
one of the chains broken at one or more sites. If single stranded, the template
DNA must be bound to a primer strand having a free 3⬘-hydroxyl group. The
reaction also requires all four activated precursors—that is, the deoxynucleoside 5⬘-triphosphates dATP, dGTP, TTP, and dCTP—as well as Mg2⫹ ion.

The chain-elongation reaction catalyzed by DNA polymerases is a nucleophilic attack by the 3⬘-hydroxyl group of the primer on the innermost
phosphorus atom of the deoxynucleoside triphosphate (Figure 5.22). A
phosphodiester bridge forms with the concomitant release of pyrophosphate. The subsequent hydrolysis of pyrophosphate by pyrophosphatase, a
ubiquitous enzyme, helps drive the polymerization forward. Elongation of
the DNA chain proceeds in the 5⬘-to-3⬘ direction.
DNA polymerases catalyze the formation of a phosphodiester bond efficiently only if the base on the incoming nucleoside triphosphate is complementary to the base on the template strand. Thus, DNA polymerase is

a template-directed enzyme that synthesizes a product with a base sequence
complementary to that of the template. Many DNA polymerases also have
a separate nuclease activity that allows them to correct mistakes in DNA by
using a different reaction to remove mismatched nucleotides. These properties of DNA polymerases contribute to the remarkably high fidelity of
DNA replication, which has an error rate of less than 10⫺8 per base pair.
5.3.2 The Genes of Some Viruses Are Made of RNA
Genes in all cellular organisms are made of DNA. The same is true for some
viruses, but for others the genetic material is RNA. Viruses are genetic elements enclosed in protein coats that can move from one cell to another but
are not capable of independent growth. One well-studied example of an
RNA virus is the tobacco mosaic virus, which infects the leaves of tobacco
plants. This virus consists of a single strand of RNA (6930 nucleotides) surrounded by a protein coat of 2130 identical subunits. An RNA-directed
RNA polymerase catalyzes the replication of this viral RNA.
Another important class of RNA virus comprises the retroviruses, so
called because the genetic information flows from RNA to DNA rather than
from DNA to RNA. This class includes human immunodeficiency virus 1
(HIV-1), the cause of AIDS, as well as a number of RNA viruses that produce tumors in susceptible animals. Retrovirus particles contain two copies
of a single-stranded RNA molecule. On entering the cell, the RNA is copied
into DNA through the action of a viral enzyme called reverse transcriptase
(Figure 5.23). The resulting double-helical DNA version of the viral

strand, the digestion of the RNA, and the
subsequent synthesis of the DNA strand.

genome can become incorporated into the chromosomal DNA of the host
and is replicated along with the normal cellular DNA. At a later time, the
integrated viral genome is expressed to form viral RNA and viral proteins,
which assemble into new virus particles.
Note that RNA viruses are not vestiges of the RNA world. Instead,
fragments of RNA in these viruses have evolved to encode their protein
coats and other structures needed for transferring from cell to cell and
replicating.

Gene Expression

5.4 GENE EXPRESSION IS THE TRANSFORMATION
OF DNA INFORMATION INTO FUNCTIONAL MOLECULES
The information stored as DNA becomes useful when it is expressed in the
production of RNA and proteins. This rich and complex topic is the subject of several chapters later in this book, but here we introduce the basics
of gene expression. DNA can be thought of as archival information, stored
and manipulated judiciously to minimize damage (mutations). It is expressed in two steps. First, an RNA copy is made. An RNA molecule that
encodes proteins can be thought of as a photocopy of the original information—it can be made in multiple copies, used, and then disposed of. Second, an RNA molecule can be further thought of as encoding directions for
protein synthesis that must be translated to be of use. The information in
messenger RNA is translated into a functional protein. Other types of RNA
molecules exist to facilitate this translation. We now examine the transcription of DNA information into RNA, the translation of RNA information into protein, and the genetic code that links nucleotide sequence with
amino acid sequence.
5.4.1 Several Kinds of RNA Play Key Roles in Gene Expression
Cells contain several kinds of RNA (Table 5.2).
1. Messenger RNA is the template for protein synthesis or translation. An
mRNA molecule may be produced for each gene or group of genes that is to
be expressed in E. coli, whereas a distinct mRNA is produced for each gene
in eukaryotes. Consequently, mRNA is a heterogeneous class of molecules. In
E. coli, the average length of an mRNA molecule is about 1.2 kilobases (kb).
2. Transfer RNA carries amino acids in an activated form to the ribosome
for peptide-bond formation, in a sequence dictated by the mRNA template.
There is at least one kind of tRNA for each of the 20 amino acids. Transfer
RNA consists of about 75 nucleotides (having a mass of about 25 kd), which
makes it one of the smallest of the RNA molecules.

TABLE 5.2

Kilobase (kb)—

3. Ribosomal RNA (rRNA), the major component of ribosomes, plays both
a catalytic and a structural role in protein synthesis (Section 29.x.x). In E.
coli, there are three kinds of rRNA, called 23S, 16S, and 5S RNA because
of their sedimentation behavior. One molecule of each of these species of
rRNA is present in each ribosome.

CHAPTER 5 • DNA, RNA, and the Flow
of Genetic Information

Ribosomal RNA is the most abundant of the three types of RNA. Transfer RNA comes next, followed by messenger RNA, which constitutes only
5% of the total RNA. Eukaryotic cells contain additional small RNA molecules. Small nuclear RNA (snRNA) molecules, for example, participate in
the splicing of RNA exons. A small RNA molecule in the cytosol plays a
role in the targeting of newly synthesized proteins to intracellular compartments and extracellular destinations.
5.4.2 All Cellular RNA Is Synthesized by RNA
Polymerases
The synthesis of RNA from a DNA template is called
transcription and is catalyzed by the enzyme RNA polymerase (Figure 5.24). RNA polymerase requires the following components:
1. A template. The preferred template is double-stranded
DNA. Single-stranded DNA also can serve as a template.
RNA, whether single or double stranded, is not an effective template; nor are RNA–DNA hybrids.
FIGURE 5.24 RNA polymerase. A large enzyme
comprising many subunits including ␤ (red) and ␤⬘ (yellow), which
form a “claw” that holds the DNA to be transcribed. The active
site includes a Mg2⫹ ion (red ball) at the center of the structure.

2. Activated precursors. All four ribonucleoside triphosphates—ATP, GTP, UTP, and CTP—are required.
3. A divalent metal ion. Mg2⫹ or Mn2⫹ are effective.

RNA polymerase catalyzes the initiation and elongation of RNA chains.
The reaction catalyzed by this enzyme is:

The synthesis of RNA is like that of DNA in several respects (Figure 5.25).
First, the direction of synthesis is 5⬘ n 3⬘. Second, the mechanism of elongation is similar: the 3⬘-OH group at the terminus of the growing chain

makes a nucleophilic attack on the innermost phosphate of the incoming
nucleoside triphosphate. Third, the synthesis is driven forward by the hydrolysis of pyrophosphate. In contrast with DNA polymerase, however,
RNA polymerase does not require a primer. In addition, RNA polymerase
lacks the nuclease capability used by DNA polymerase to excise mismatched nucleotides.
All three types of cellular RNA—mRNA, tRNA, and rRNA—are synthesized in E. coli by the same RNA polymerase according to instructions
given by a DNA template. In mammalian cells, there is a division of labor
among several different kinds of RNA polymerases. We shall return to these
RNA polymerases in Chapter 28.

also revealed that RNA synthesized by RNA polymerase is complementary to its DNA template. In these
experiments, DNA is melted and allowed to reassociate in the presence of
mRNA. RNA–DNA hybrids will form if the RNA and DNA have complementary sequences. The strongest evidence for the fidelity of transcription came from base-sequence studies showing that the RNA sequence is
the precise complement of the DNA template sequence (Figure 5.26).

enzymes that catalyze the synthesis of tryptophan. The other strand of DNA (black) is called
the coding strand because it has the same sequence as the RNA transcript except for
thymine (T) in place of uracil (U).

5.4.4 Transcription Begins near Promoter Sites and
Ends at Terminator Sites
RNA polymerase must detect and transcribe discrete genes from within
large stretches of DNA. What marks the beginning of a transcriptional unit?
DNA templates contain regions called promoter sites that specifically bind
RNA polymerase and determine where transcription begins. In bacteria,
two sequences on the 5⬘ (upstream) side of the first nucleotide to be transcribed function as promoter sites (Figure 5.27A). One of them, called the
Pribnow box, has the consensus sequence TATAAT and is centered at ⫺10
(10 nucleotides on the 5⬘ side of the first nucleotide transcribed, which is
denoted by ⫹ 1). The other, called the ⫺35 region, has the consensus sequence TTGACA. The first nucleotide transcribed is usually a purine.
Eukaryotic genes encoding proteins have promoter sites with a
TATAAA consensus sequence, called a TATA box or a Hogness box, centered at about ⫺25 (Figure 5.27B). Many eukaryotic promoters also have a

Consensus sequence—
The base sequences of promoter sites
are not all identical. However, they do
possess common features, which can
be represented by an idealized consensus sequence. Each base in the consensus sequence TATAAT is found in a
majority of prokaryotic promoters.
Nearly all promoter sequences differ
from this consensus sequence at only
one or two bases.

start site, on either its 5⬘ or its 3⬘ side.
RNA polymerase proceeds along the DNA template, transcribing one
of its strands until it reaches a terminator sequence. This sequence encodes
a termination signal, which in E. coli is a base-paired hairpin on the newly
synthesized RNA molecule (Figure 5.28). This hairpin is formed by base
pairing of self-complementary sequences that are rich in G and C. Nascent
RNA spontaneously dissociates from RNA polymerase when this hairpin
is followed by a string of U residues. Alternatively, RNA synthesis can be
terminated by the action of rho, a protein. Less is known about the termination of transcription in eukaryotes. A more detailed discussion of the initiation and termination of transcription will be given in Chapter 28. The
important point now is that discrete start and stop signals for transcription
are encoded in the DNA template.
In eukaryotes, the mRNA is modified after transcription (Figure 5.29).
A “cap” structure is attached to the 5⬘ end, and a sequence of adenylates,
the poly(A) tail, is added to the 3⬘ end. These modifications will be presented in detail in Section 28.x.x.

5.4.5 Transfer RNA Is the Adaptor Molecule
in Protein Synthesis
We have seen that mRNA is the template for protein synthesis. How then
does it direct amino acids to become joined in the correct sequence to form
a protein? In 1958, Francis Crick wrote:
RNA presents mainly a sequence of sites where hydrogen bonding could
occur. One would expect, therefore, that whatever went onto the template
in a specific way did so by forming hydrogen bonds. It is therefore a natural hypothesis that the amino acid is carried to the template by an adaptor molecule, and that the adaptor is the part that actually fits onto the
RNA. In its simplest form, one would require twenty adaptors, one for
each amino acid.

This highly innovative hypothesis soon became established as fact. The
adaptor in protein synthesis is transfer RNA. The structure and reactions of

7552dc05_117-142

4/28/01

1:06 PM

Page 133

these remarkable molecules will be considered in detail in Chapter 29.
For the moment, it suffices to note that tRNA contains an amino acidattachment site and a template-recognition site. A tRNA molecule carries a
specific amino acid in an activated form to the site of protein synthesis. The
carboxyl group of this amino acid is esterified to the 3⬘- or 2⬘-hydroxyl group
of the ribose unit at the 3⬘ end of the tRNA chain (Figure 5.30). The joining of an amino acid to a tRNA molecule to form an aminoacyl-tRNA is catalyzed by a specific enzyme called an aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase. This esterification reaction is driven by ATP cleavage. There is at least one specific
synthetase for each of the 20 amino acids. The template-recognition site on
tRNA is a sequence of three bases called an anticodon (Figure 5.31). The
anticodon on tRNA recognizes a complementary sequence of three bases,
called a codon, on mRNA.

The genetic code is the relation between the sequence of bases in DNA (or
its RNA transcripts) and the sequence of amino acids in proteins. Experiments by Francis Crick, Sydney Brenner, and others established the following features of the genetic code by 1961:
1. Three nucleotides encode an amino acid. Proteins are built from a basic set
of 20 amino acids, but there are only four bases. Simple calculations show
that a minimum of three bases is required to encode at least 20 amino acids.
Genetic experiments showed that an amino acid is in fact encoded by a group
of three bases, or codon.

2. The code is nonoverlapping. Consider a base sequence ABCDEF. In an
overlapping code, ABC specifies the first amino acid, BCD the next, CDE
the next, and so on. In a nonoverlapping code, ABC designates the first
amino acid, EFG the second, and so forth. Genetics experiments again established the code to be nonoverlapping.

serve as a “comma” between groups of three bases.

This is not the case. Rather, the sequence of bases is read sequentially from a

4. The genetic code is degenerate. Some amino acids are encoded by more
than one codon, inasmuch as there are 64 possible base triplets and only 20
amino acids. In fact, 61 of the 64 possible triplets specify particular amino
acids and 3 triplets (called stop codons) designate the termination of translation. Thus, for most amino acids, there is more than one code word.

CHAPTER 5 • DNA, RNA, and the Flow
of Genetic Information

Page 134

5.5.1 Major Features of the Genetic Code
All 64 codons have been deciphered (Table 5.4). Because the code is highly
degenerate, only tryptophan and methionine are encoded by just one triplet
each. The other 18 amino acids are each encoded by two or more. Indeed,
leucine, arginine, and serine are specified by six codons each. The number
of codons for a particular amino acid correlates with its frequency of occurrence in proteins.
Codons that specify the same amino acid are called synonyms. For example, CAU and CAC are synonyms for histidine. Note that synonyms are
not distributed haphazardly throughout the genetic code (depicted in Table
5.4). An amino acid specified by two or more synonyms occupies a single
box (unless it is specified by more than four synonyms). The amino acids
in a box are specified by codons that have the same first two bases but differ in the third base, as exemplified by GUU, GUC, GUA, and GUG.
Thus, most synonyms differ only in the last base of the triplet. Inspection of
the code shows that XYC and XYU always encode the same amino acid,
whereas XYG and XYA usually encode the same amino acid. The structural basis for these equivalences of codons will become evident when we
consider the nature of the anticodons of tRNA molecules (Section 29.x.x).
What is the biological significance of the extensive degeneracy of the genetic code? If the code were not degenerate, 20 codons would designate
amino acids and 44 would lead to chain termination. The probability of mutating to chain termination would therefore be much higher with a nondegenerate code. Chain-termination mutations usually lead to inactive proteins, whereas substitutions of one amino acid for another are usually rather

Note: This table identifies the amino acid encoded by each triplet. For example, the codon
5⬘ AUG 3⬘ on mRNA specifies methionine, whereas CAU specifies histidine. UAA,
UAG, and UGA are termination signals. AUG is part of the initiation signal, in addition
to coding for internal methionine residues.

harmless. Thus, degeneracy minimizes the deleterious effects of mutations. Degeneracy of the code may also be significant in permitting DNA base composition to vary over a wide range without altering the amino acid sequence
of the proteins encoded by the DNA. The G ⫹ C content of bacterial DNA
ranges from less than 30% to more than 70%. DNA molecules with quite
different G ⫹ C contents could encode the same proteins if different synonyms of the genetic code were consistently used.

The Genetic Code

5.5.2 Messenger RNA Contains Start and Stop Signals
for Protein Synthesis
Messenger RNA is translated into proteins on ribosomes, large molecular
complexes assembled from proteins and ribosomal RNA. How is mRNA interpreted by the translation apparatus? As already mentioned, UAA, UAG,
and UGA designate chain termination. These codons are read not by tRNA
molecules but rather by specific proteins called release factors (Section
29.x.x). Binding of the release factors to the ribosomes releases the newly
synthesized protein. The start signal for protein synthesis is more complex.
Polypeptide chains in bacteria start with a modified amino acid—namely,
formylmethionine (fMet). A specific tRNA, the initiator tRNA, carries
fMet. This fMet-tRNA recognizes the codon AUG or, less frequently,
GUG. However, AUG is also the codon for an internal methionine residue,
and GUG is the codon for an internal valine residue. Hence, the signal for
the first amino acid in a prokaryotic polypeptide chain must be more complex than that for all subsequent ones. AUG (or GUG) is only part of the initiation signal (Figure 5.32). In bacteria, the initiating AUG (or GUG) codon
is preceded several nucleotides away by a purine-rich sequence that basepairs with a complementary sequence in a ribosomal RNA molecule (Section 29.x.x). In eukaryotes, the AUG closest to the 5⬘ end of an mRNA molecule is usually the start signal for protein synthesis. This particular AUG is
read by an initiator tRNA conjugated to methionine. Once the initiator AUG
is located, the reading frame is established—groups of three nonoverlapping
nucleotides are defined, beginning with the initiator AUG codon.

5.5.3 The Genetic Code Is Nearly Universal
Is the genetic code the same in all organisms? The base sequences
of many wild-type and mutant genes are known, as are the amino acid
sequences of their encoded proteins. In each case, the nucleotide change in
the gene and the amino acid change in the protein are as predicted by the
genetic code. Furthermore, mRNAs can be correctly translated by the protein-synthesizing machinery of very different species. For example, human
hemoglobin mRNA is correctly translated by a wheat germ extract, and bacteria efficiently express recombinant DNA molecules encoding human

proteins such as insulin. These experimental findings strongly suggested
that the genetic code is universal.
A surprise was encountered when the sequence of human mitochondrial DNA became known. Human mitochondria read UGA as a codon for
tryptophan rather than as a stop signal (Table 5.5). Furthermore, AGA and
AGG are read as stop signals rather than as codons for arginine, and AUA
is read as a codon for methionine instead of isoleucine. Mitochondria of
other species, such as those of yeast, also have genetic codes that differ
slightly from the standard one. The genetic code of mitochondria can differ from that of the rest of the cell because mitochondrial DNA encodes a
distinct set of tRNAs. Do any cellular protein-synthesizing systems deviate from the standard genetic code? Ciliated protozoa differ from most organisms in reading UAA and UAG as codons for amino acids rather than
as stop signals; UGA is their sole termination signal. Thus, the genetic code
is nearly but not absolutely universal. Variations clearly exist in mitochondria
and in species, such as ciliates, that branched off very early in eukaryotic
evolution. It is interesting to note that two of the codon reassignments in
human mitochondria diminish the information content of the third base of
the triplet (e.g., both AUA and AUG specify methionine). Most variations
from the standard genetic code are in the direction of a simpler code.
Why has the code remained nearly invariant through billions of years of
evolution, from bacteria to human beings? A mutation that altered the reading of mRNA would change the amino acid sequence of most, if not all,
proteins synthesized by that particular organism. Many of these changes
would undoubtedly be deleterious, and so there would be strong selection
against a mutation with such pervasive consequences.

␤-Globin gene

In bacteria, polypeptide chains are encoded by a continuous array of triplet
codons in DNA. For many years, genes in higher organisms also were assumed
to be continuous. This view was unexpectedly shattered in 1977, when investigators in several laboratories discovered that several genes are discontinuous.
The mosaic nature of eukaryotic genes was revealed by electron microscopic
studies of hybrids formed between mRNA and a segment of DNA containing the corresponding gene (Figure 5.33). For example, the gene for the
␤ chain of hemoglobin is interrupted within its amino
acid-coding sequence by a long intervening sequence of
550
base pairs and a short one of 120 base pairs. Thus,
250 Base pairs
the ␤-globin gene is split into three coding sequences.

5.6.1 RNA Processing Generates Mature RNA
At what stage in gene expression are intervening sequences removed? Newly
synthesized RNA chains (pre-mRNA) isolated from nuclei are much larger
than the mRNA molecules derived from them; in the case of ␤-globin RNA,
the former sediment at 15S in zonal centrifugation experiments (Section
4.1.6) and the latter at 9S. In fact, the primary transcript of the ␤-globin
gene contains two regions that are not present in the mRNA. These intervening sequences in the 15S primary transcript are excised, and the coding sequences are simultaneously linked by a precise splicing enzyme to form the mature 9S mRNA (Figure 5.34). Regions that are removed from the primary
transcript are called introns (for intervening sequences), whereas those that
are retained in the mature RNA are called exons (for expressed regions). A
common feature in the expression of split genes is that their exons are ordered in the same sequence in mRNA as in DNA. Thus, split genes, like
continuous genes, are colinear with their polypeptide products.
Splicing is a facile complex operation that is carried out by spliceosomes,
which are assemblies of proteins and small RNA molecules (Section 28.x.x).
This enzymatic machinery recognizes signals in the nascent RNA that specify the splice sites. Introns nearly always begin with GU and end with an AG
that is preceded by a pyrimidine-rich tract (Figure 5.35). This consensus sequence is part of the signal for splicing.

5.6.2 Many Exons Encode Protein Domains
Most genes of higher eukaryotes, such as birds and mammals, are
split. Lower eukaryotes, such as yeast, have a much higher proportion of continuous genes. In prokaryotes, split genes are extremely rare.
Have introns been inserted into genes in the evolution of higher organisms?
Or have introns been removed from genes to form the streamlined genomes
of prokaryotes and simple eukaryotes? Comparisons of the DNA sequences
of genes encoding proteins that are highly conserved in evolution suggest
that introns were present in ancestral genes and were lost in the evolution of

organisms that have become optimized for very rapid growth,
such as prokaryotes. The positions of introns in some genes are
at least 1 billion years old. Furthermore, a common mechanism of splicing developed before the divergence of fungi,
plants, and vertebrates, as shown by the finding that mamRecombination
malian cell extracts can splice yeast RNA. Many exons encode
discrete structural and functional units of proteins. An attractive hypothesis is that new proteins arose in evolution by the
rearrangement of exons encoding discrete structural elements,
binding sites, and catalytic sites, a process called exon shuffling.
Because it preserves functional units but allows them to inFIGURE 5.36 Exon shuffling. Exons can be readily
teract in new ways, exon shuffling is a rapid and efficient
shuffled by recombination of DNA to expand the genetic
means of generating novel genes (Figure 5.36). Introns are exrepertoire.
tensive regions in which DNA can break and recombine with
no deleterious effect on encoded proteins. In contrast, the exchange of sequences between different exons usually leads to loss of function.
Another advantage conferred by split genes is the potentiality for generating a series of related proteins by splicing a nascent RNA transcript in different ways. For example, a precursor of an antibody-producing cell forms an
antibody that is anchored in the cell’s plasma membrane (Figure 5.37). Stimulation of such a cell by a specific foreign antigen that is recognized by the
attached antibody leads to cell differentiation and proliferation. The activated antibody-producing cells then splice their nascent RNA transcript in
an alternative manner to form soluble antibody molecules that are secreted

rather than retained on the cell surface. We see here a clear-cut example of
molecule
a benefit conferred by the complex arrangement of introns and exons in
higher organisms. Alternative splicing is a facile means of forming a set of
proteins that are variations of a basic motif according to a developmental program without requiring a gene for each protein.

DNA and RNA are linear polymers of a limited number of monomers.
In DNA, the repeating units are nucleotides with the sugar being a deoxyribose and the bases being adenine (A), thymine (T), guanine (G),
and cytosine (C). In RNA, the sugar is a ribose and the base uracil (U)
is used in place of thymine. DNA is the molecule of heredity in all

A Nucleic Acid Consists of Four Kinds of Bases Linked

•

A Pair of Nucleic Acid Chains with Complementary Sequences Can Form
a Double-Helical Structure

All cellular DNA consists of two very long, helical polynucleotide
chains coiled around a common axis. The sugar-phosphate backbone of
each strand is on the outside of the double helix, whereas the purine and
pyrimidine bases are on the inside. The two chains are held together by
hydrogen bonds between pairs of bases: adenine is always paired with
thymine, and guanine is always paired with cytosine. Hence, one strand
of a double helix is the complement of the other. The two strands of the
double helix run in opposite directions. Genetic information is encoded
in the precise sequence of bases along a strand. Most RNA molecules
are single stranded, but many contain extensive double-helical regions
that arise from the folding of the chain into hairpins.

Summary

• DNA Is Replicated by Polymerases That Take Instructions from Templates

In the replication of DNA, the two strands of a double helix unwind
and separate as new chains are synthesized. Each parent strand acts as
a template for the formation of a new complementary strand. Thus, the
replication of DNA is semiconservative—each daughter molecule receives one strand from the parent DNA molecule. The replication of
DNA is a complex process carried out by many proteins, including several DNA polymerases. The activated precursors in the synthesis of
DNA are the four deoxyribonucleoside 5⬘-triphosphates. The new
strand is synthesized in the 5⬘ n 3⬘ direction by a nucleophilic attack
by the 3⬘-hydroxyl terminus of the primer strand on the innermost
phosphorus atom of the incoming deoxyribonucleoside triphosphate.
Most important, DNA polymerases catalyze the formation of a phosphodiester bond only if the base on the incoming nucleotide is complementary to the base on the template strand. In other words, DNA polymerases are template-directed enzymes. The genes of some viruses, such
as tobacco mosaic virus, are made of single-stranded RNA. An RNAdirected RNA polymerase mediates the replication of this viral RNA.
Retroviruses, exemplified by HIV-1, have a single-stranded RNA
genome that is transcribed into double-stranded DNA by reverse transcriptase, an RNA-directed DNA polymerase.

•

Gene Expression Is the Transformation of DNA Information
into Functional Molecules

The flow of genetic information in normal cells is from DNA to RNA
to protein. The synthesis of RNA from a DNA template is called transcription, whereas the synthesis of a protein from an RNA template is
termed translation. Cells contain several kinds of RNA: messenger RNA
(mRNA), transfer RNA (tRNA), and ribosomal RNA (rRNA), which
vary in size from 75 to more than 5000 nucleotides. All cellular RNA is
synthesized by RNA polymerases according to instructions given by
DNA templates. The activated intermediates are ribonucleoside triphosphates and the direction of synthesis, like that of DNA, is 5⬘ n 3⬘. RNA
polymerase differs from DNA polymerase in not requiring a primer.

• Amino Acids Are Encoded by Groups of Three Bases Starting from a
Fixed Point

The genetic code is the relation between the sequence of bases in DNA
(or its RNA transcript) and the sequence of amino acids in proteins. Amino
acids are encoded by groups of three bases (called codons) starting from a
fixed point. Sixty-one of the 64 codons specify particular amino acids,
whereas the other 3 codons (UAA, UAG, and UGA) are signals for chain
termination. Thus, for most amino acids, there is more than one code word.
In other words, the code is degenerate. The genetic code is nearly the same
in all organisms. Natural mRNAs contain start and stop signals for translation, just as genes do for directing where transcription begins and ends.

•

Most Eukaryotic Genes Are Mosaics of Introns and Exons

Most genes in higher eukaryotes are discontinuous. Coding sequences
(exons) in these split genes are separated by intervening sequences (introns), which are removed in the conversion of the primary transcript
into mRNA and other functional mature RNA molecules. Split genes,
like continuous genes, are colinear with their polypeptide products. A
striking feature of many exons is that they encode functional domains
in proteins. New proteins probably arose in the course of evolution by
the shuffling of exons. Introns may have been present in primordial
genes but were lost in the evolution of such fast-growing organisms as
bacteria and yeast.

17. Two from one. Synthetic RNA molecules of defined sequence
were instrumental in deciphering the genetic code. Their synthesis first required the synthesis of DNA molecules to serve
as a template. H. Gobind Khorana synthesized, by organicchemical methods, two complementary deoxyribonucleotides,
each with nine residues: d(TAC)3 and d(GTA)3. Partly overlapping duplexes that formed on mixing these oligonucleotides
then served as templates for the synthesis by DNA polymerase
of long, repeating double-helical DNA chains. The next step was
to obtain long polyribonucleotide chains with a sequence complementary to only one of the two DNA strands. How did he
obtain only poly(UAC)? Only poly(GUA)?
18. Overlapping or not. In a nonoverlapping triplet code, each

ABC specifies the first amino acid, BCD the second, CDE the
third, and so forth. Assume that you can mutate an individual
nucleotide of a codon and detect the mutation in the amino acid
sequence. Design an experiment that would establish whether
the genetic code is overlapping or nonoverlapping.

favorable than usual. Look at the Media Problem section of the
Structural Insights module on nucleic acids and explain why
8-oxoguanine often mispairs with adenine.

thousands of genes can be monitored through the use of DNA arrays. At right, a

Recombinant DNA technology has revolutionized biochemistry since it
came into being in the 1970s. The genetic endowment of organisms can now
be precisely changed in designed ways. Recombinant DNA technology is a
fruit of several decades of basic research on DNA, RNA, and viruses. It depends, first, on having enzymes that can cut, join, and replicate DNA and
reverse transcribe RNA. Restriction enzymes cut very long DNA molecules
into specific fragments that can be manipulated; DNA ligases join the fragments together. The availability of many kinds of restriction enzymes and
DNA ligases makes it feasible to treat DNA sequences as modules that can
be moved at will from one DNA molecule to another. Thus, recombinant
DNA technology is based on nucleic acid enzymology.
A second foundation is the base-pairing language that

CHAPTER 6 • Exploring Genes

These new methods have wide-ranging benefits. Entire genomes, including the human genome, are being deciphered. New insights are emerging, for example, into the regulation of gene expression in cancer and development and the evolutionary history of proteins as well as organisms. New
proteins can be created by altering genes in specific ways to provide detailed
views into protein function. Clinically useful proteins, such as hormones, are
now synthesized by recombinant DNA techniques. Crops are being generated to resist pests and harsh conditions. The new opportunities opened by
recombinant DNA technology promise to have broad effects.

6.1 THE BASIC TOOLS OF GENE EXPLORATION
The rapid progress in biotechnology—indeed its very existence—is a result
of a relatively few techniques.
1. Restriction-enzyme analysis. Restriction enzymes are precise, molecular
scalpels that allow the investigator to manipulate DNA segments.
2. Blotting techniques. The Southern and Northern blots are used to separate and characterize DNA and RNA, respectively. The Western blot, which
uses antibodies to characterize proteins, was described in Section 4.3.4.
3. DNA sequencing. The precise nucleotide sequence of a molecule of DNA
can be determined. Sequencing has yielded a wealth of information concerning gene architecture, the control of gene expression, and protein structure.
4. Solid-phase synthesis of nucleic acids. Precise sequences of nucleic acids can
be synthesized de novo and used to identify or amplify other nucleic acids.
5. The polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The polymerase chain reaction
leads to a billionfold amplification of a segment of DNA. One molecule of
DNA can be amplified to quantities that permit characterization and manipulation. This powerful technique is being used to detect pathogens and
genetic diseases, to determine the source of a hair left at the scene of a crime,
and to resurrect genes from fossils.
A final tool, the use of which will be highlighted in the next chapter, is
the computer. Without the computer, it would be impossible to catalog, access, and characterize the abundant information, especially DNA sequence
information, that the techniques just outlined are rapidly generating.
6.1.1 Restriction Enzymes Split DNA into Specific Fragments

the same from right to left as it does

Radar
Madam, I’m Adam
Able was I ere I saw Elba
Roma tibi subito motibus ibit amor
Derived from the Greek palindromos,
“running back again.”

Restriction enzymes, also called restriction endonucleases, recognize specific
base sequences in double-helical DNA and cleave, at specific places, both
strands of a duplex containing the recognized sequences. To biochemists,
these exquisitely precise scalpels are marvelous gifts of nature. They are indispensable for analyzing chromosome structure, sequencing very long
DNA molecules, isolating genes, and creating new DNA molecules that can
be cloned. Werner Arber and Hamilton Smith discovered restriction enzymes, and Daniel Nathans pioneered their use in the late 1960s.
Restriction enzymes are found in a wide variety of prokaryotes. Their
biological role is to cleave foreign DNA molecules. The cell’s own DNA is
not degraded, because the sites recognized by its own restriction enzymes
are methylated. Many restriction enzymes recognize specific sequences of
four to eight base pairs and hydrolyze a phosphodiester bond in each strand
in this region. A striking characteristic of these cleavage sites is that they almost always possess twofold rotational symmetry. In other words, the recognized sequence is palindromic, or an inverted repeat, and the cleavage sites

are symmetrically positioned. For example, the sequence recognized by a

Symmetry axis

In each strand, the enzyme cleaves the C–G phosphodiester bond on the 3⬘
side of the symmetry axis. As we shall see in Chapter 9, this symmetry reflects that of structures of the restriction enzymes themselves.
More than 100 restriction enzymes have been purified and characterized. Their names consist of a three-letter abbreviation for the host organism (e.g., Eco for Escherichia coli, Hin for Haemophilus influenzae, Hae for
Haemophilus aegyptius) followed by a strain designation (if needed) and a
roman numeral (if more than one restriction enzyme from the same strain
has been identified). The specificities of several of these enzymes are shown
in Figure 6.1. Note that the cuts may be staggered or even.
Restriction enzymes are used to cleave DNA molecules into specific
fragments that are more readily analyzed and manipulated than the entire
parent molecule. For example, the 5.1-kb circular duplex DNA of the tumor-producing SV40 virus is cleaved at 1 site by EcoRI, 4 sites by HpaI,
and 11 sites by HindIII. A piece of DNA produced by the action of one restriction enzyme can be specifically cleaved into smaller fragments by another restriction enzyme. The pattern of such fragments can serve as a fingerprint of a DNA molecule, as will be discussed shortly. Indeed, complex
chromosomes containing hundreds of millions of base pairs can be mapped
by using a series of restriction enzymes.

cleavage sites are denoted by red arrows.
The abbreviated name of each restriction
enzyme is given at the right of the
sequence that it recognizes.

6.1.2 Restriction Fragments Can Be Separated
by Gel Electrophoresis and Visualized
Small differences between related DNA molecules can be readily detected
because their restriction fragments can be separated and displayed by gel
electrophoresis. In many types of gels, the electrophoretic mobility of a
DNA fragment is inversely proportional to the logarithm of the number of
base pairs, up to a certain limit. Polyacrylamide gels are used to separate
fragments containing about as many as 1000 base pairs, whereas more
porous agarose gels are used to resolve mixtures of larger fragments (about
as many as 20 kb). An important feature of these gels is their high resolving power. In certain kinds of gels, fragments differing in length by just one
nucleotide of several hundred can be distinguished. Moreover, entire chromosomes containing millions of nucleotides can be separated on agarose gels
by applying pulsed electric fields (pulsed-field gel electrophoresis, PFGE)
in different directions. This technique depends on the differential stretching and relaxing of large DNA molecules as an electric field is turned off
and on at short intervals. Bands or spots of radioactive DNA in gels can be
visualized by autoradiography (Section 4.1.4). Alternatively, a gel can be
stained with ethidium bromide, which fluoresces an intense orange when
bound to double-helical DNA molecule (Figure 6.2). A band containing
only 50 ng of DNA can be readily seen.

fragments produced by cleaving SV40 DNA with each of three restriction enzymes. These

Southern blotting can be used to
follow the inheritance of selected
genes. Mutations within restriction sites
change the sizes of restriction
fragments and hence the positions of
bands in Southern-blot analyses. The
existence of genetic diversity in a
population is termed polymorphism.
The detected mutation may itself cause
disease or it may be closely linked to
one that does. Genetic diseases such
as sickle-cell anemia, cystic fibrosis,
and Huntington chorea can be
detected by RFLP analyses.

A restriction fragment containing a specific base sequence can be identified by hybridizing it with a labeled complementary DNA strand (Figure
6.3). A mixture of restriction fragments is separated by electrophoresis
through an agarose gel, denatured to form single-stranded DNA, and transferred to a nitrocellulose sheet. The positions of the DNA fragments in the
gel are preserved on the nitrocellulose sheet, where they are exposed to a
32
P-labeled single-stranded DNA probe. The probe hybridizes with a restriction fragment having a complementary sequence, and autoradiography
then reveals the position of the restriction-fragment-probe duplex. A particular fragment in the midst of a million others can be readily identified in
this way, like finding a needle in a haystack. This powerful technique is
known as Southern blotting because it was devised by Edwin Southern.
Similarly, RNA molecules can be separated by gel electrophoresis, and
specific sequences can be identified by hybridization subsequent to their
transfer to nitrocellulose. This analogous technique for the analysis of RNA
has been whimsically termed Northern blotting. A further play on words accounts for the term Western blotting, which refers to a technique for detecting a particular protein by staining with specific antibody (Section 4.3.4).
Southern, Northern, and Western blots are also known respectively as DNA,
RNA, and protein blots.
6.1.3 DNA Is Usually Sequenced by Controlled Termination
of Replication (Sanger Dideoxy Method)
The analysis of DNA structure and its role in gene expression also have
been markedly facilitated by the development of powerful techniques for
the sequencing of DNA molecules. The key to DNA sequencing is the generation of DNA fragments whose length depends on the last base in the sequence. Collections of such fragments can be generated through the controlled interruption of enzymatic replication, a method developed by
Frederick Sanger and coworkers. This technique has superseded alternative
methods because of its simplicity. The same procedure is performed on four
reaction mixtures at the same time. In all these mixtures, a DNA polymerase
is used to make the complement of a particular sequence within a singlestranded DNA molecule. The synthesis is primed by a fragment, usually
obtained by chemical synthetic methods described in Section 6.1.4, that is
complementary to a part of the sequence known from other studies. In addition to the four deoxyribonucleoside triphosphates (radioactively labeled),
each reaction mixture contains a small amount of the 2⬘,3⬘-dideoxy analog
of one of the nucleotides, a different nucleotide for each reaction mixture.

The incorporation of this analog blocks further growth of the new chain because it lacks the 3⬘-hydroxyl terminus needed to form the next phosphodiester bond. The concentration of the dideoxy analog is low enough that
chain termination will take place only occasionally. The polymerase will
sometimes insert the correct nucleotide and other times the dideoxy analog,
stopping the reaction. For instance, if the dideoxy analog of dATP is present, fragments of various lengths are produced, but all will be terminated
by the dideoxy analog (Figure 6.4). Importantly, this dideoxy analog of
dATP will be inserted only where a T was located in the DNA being sequenced. Thus, the fragments of different length will correspond to the positions of T. Four such sets of chain-terminated fragments
(one for each dideoxy analog) then undergo electrophoresis, and the base sequence of the new DNA is read from the

the dideoxy analogs can be labeled, each with a specific fluSequence C A
orescent label. When this method is used, all four terminators can be placed in a single tube, and only one reaction is
necessary. Fluorescence detection is attractive because it
eliminates the use of radioactive reagents and can be readily automated.
Sanger and coworkers determined the complete sequence of the 5386 bases
in the DNA of the ␾X174 DNA virus in 1977, just a quarter century after
Sanger’s pioneering elucidation of the amino acid sequence of a protein. This
accomplishment is a landmark in molecular biology because it revealed the
total information content of a DNA genome. This tour de force was followed
several years later by the determination of the sequence of human mitochondrial DNA, a double-stranded circular DNA molecule containing 16,569 base
pairs. It encodes 2 ribosomal RNAs, 22 transfer RNAs, and 13 proteins. In

FIGURE 6.6 A complete genome. The diagram depicts the

free-living organism to be sequenced. The genome encodes more
than 1700 proteins and 70 RNA molecules. The likely function of
approximately one-half of the proteins was determined by
comparisons with sequences from proteins previously characterized
in other species. [From R. D. Fleischmann et al., Science 269(1995):496;

recent years, the complete genomes of free-living organisms have been sequenced. The first such sequence to be
completed was that of the bacterium Haemophilus influenzae. Its genome comprises 1,830,137 base pairs and
encodes approximately 1740 proteins (Figure 6.6).
Many other bacterial and archaeal genomes have
since been sequenced. The first eukaryotic genome to be
completely sequenced was that of baker’s yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, which comprises approximately 12
million base pairs, distributed on 16 chromosomes, and
encodes more than 6000 proteins. This achievement was
followed by the first complete sequencing of the genome
of a multicellular organism, the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans, which
contains nearly 100 million base pairs. The human genome is considerably
larger at more than 3 billion base pairs, but it has been essentially completely sequenced. The ability to determine complete genome sequences has
revolutionized biochemistry and biology.

by Automated Solid-Phase Methods

FIGURE 6.7 Solid-phase synthesis of a
DNA chain by the phosphite triester
method. The activated monomer added

DNA strands, like polypeptides (Section 4.4), can be synthesized by the sequential addition of activated monomers to a growing chain that is linked
to an insoluble support. The activated monomers are protonated deoxyribonucleoside 3⬘-phosphoramidites. In step 1, the 3⬘ phosphorus atom of this
incoming unit becomes joined to the 5⬘ oxygen atom of the growing chain
to form a phosphite triester (Figure 6.7). The 5⬘-OH group of the activated

chains are of diverse lengths—the desired chain is the longest one. The sample can be purified by high-pressure liquid chromatography or by electrophoresis on polyacrylamide gels. DNA chains of as many as 100 nucleotides can be readily synthesized by this automated method.

6.1.5 Selected DNA Sequences Can Be Greatly Amplified
by the Polymerase Chain Reaction
In 1984, Kary Mullis devised an ingenious method called the polymerase
chain reaction (PCR) for amplifying specific DNA sequences. Consider a
DNA duplex consisting of a target sequence surrounded by nontarget
DNA. Millions of the target sequences can be readily obtained by PCR if
the flanking sequences of the target are known. PCR is carried out by adding
the following components to a solution containing the target sequence: (1)
a pair of primers that hybridize with the flanking sequences of the target,
(2) all four deoxyribonucleoside triphosphates (dNTPs), and (3) a heat-stable DNA polymerase. A PCR cycle consists of three steps (Figure 6.8).
1. Strand separation. The two strands of the parent DNA molecule are separated by heating the solution to 95°C for 15 s.

the optimal temperature for Taq DNA polymerase. This
heat-stable polymerase comes from Thermus aquaticus, a
thermophilic bacterium that lives in hot springs. The
polymerase elongates both primers in the direction of the
target sequence because DNA synthesis is in the 5⬘-to3⬘ direction. DNA synthesis takes place on both strands
but extends beyond the target sequence.

These three steps—strand separation, hybridization
of primers, and DNA synthesis—constitute one cycle of
the PCR amplification and can be carried out repetitively
just by changing the temperature of the reaction mixture.

Several features of this remarkable method for ampliexponentially.
fying DNA are noteworthy. First, the sequence of the target need not be known. All that is required is knowledge
of the flanking sequences. Second, the target can be much
larger than the primers. Targets larger than 10 kb have
been amplified by PCR. Third, primers do not have to
be perfectly matched to flanking sequences to amplify
targets. With the use of primers derived from a gene of
known sequence, it is possible to search for variations on
the theme. In this way, families of genes are being discovered by PCR. Fourth, PCR is highly specific because
of the stringency of hybridization at high temperature
(54°C). Stringency is the required closeness of the match
between primer and target, which can be controlled by temperature and salt.
At high temperatures, the only DNA that is amplified is that situated be-

tween primers that have hybridized. A gene constituting less than a millionth
of the total DNA of a higher organism is accessible by PCR. Fifth, PCR is
exquisitely sensitive. A single DNA molecule can be amplified and detected.

Recombinant DNA Technology

6.1.6 PCR Is a Powerful Technique in Medical Diagnostics,
Forensics, and Molecular Evolution
PCR can provide valuable diagnostic information in medicine. Bacteria and
viruses can be readily detected with the use of specific primers. For example,
PCR can reveal the presence of human immunodeficiency virus in people who
have not mounted an immune response to this pathogen and would therefore
be missed with an antibody assay. Finding Mycobacterium tuberculosis bacilli
in tissue specimens is slow and laborious. With PCR, as few as 10 tubercle
bacilli per million human cells can be readily detected. PCR is a promising
method for the early detection of certain cancers. This technique can identify
mutations of certain growth-control genes, such as the ras genes (Section 15.x.x).
The capacity to greatly amplify selected regions of DNA can also be highly informative in monitoring cancer chemotherapy. Tests using PCR can detect
when cancerous cells have been eliminated and treatment can be stopped; they
can also detect a relapse and the need to immediately resume treatment. PCR
is ideal for detecting leukemias caused by chromosomal rearrangements.
PCR is also having an effect in forensics and legal medicine. An individual DNA profile is highly distinctive because many genetic loci are
highly variable within a population. For example, variations at a specific
one of these locations determines a person’s HLA type (human leukocyte
antigen type); organ transplants are rejected when the HLA types of the
donor and recipient are not sufficiently matched. PCR amplification of multiple genes is being used to establish biological parentage in disputed paternity and immigration cases. Analyses of blood stains and semen samples
by PCR have implicated guilt or innocence in numerous assault and rape
cases. The root of a single shed hair found at a crime scene contains enough
DNA for typing by PCR (Figure 6.10).
DNA is a remarkably stable molecule, particularly when relatively
shielded from air, light, and water. Under such circumstances, large fragments of DNA can remain intact for thousands of years or longer. PCR provides an ideal method for amplifying such ancient DNA molecules so that
they can be detected and characterized (Section 7.5.1). PCR can also be used
to amplify DNA from microorganisms that have not yet been isolated and
cultured. As will be discussed in the next chapter, sequences from these
PCR products can be sources of considerable insight into evolutionary relationships between organisms.

6.2 RECOMBINANT DNA TECHNOLOGY HAS
REVOLUTIONIZED ALL ASPECTS OF BIOLOGY
The pioneering work of Paul Berg, Herbert Boyer, and Stanley Cohen in
the early 1970s led to the development of recombinant DNA technology,
which has permitted biology to move from an exclusively analytical science
to a synthetic one. New combinations of unrelated genes can be constructed
in the laboratory by applying recombinant DNA techniques. These novel
combinations can be cloned—amplified manyfold—by introducing them
into suitable cells, where they are replicated by the DNA-synthesizing machinery of the host. The inserted genes are often transcribed and translated
in their new setting. What is most striking is that the genetic endowment
of the host can be permanently altered in a designed way.

CHAPTER 6 • Exploring Genes

6.2.1 Restriction Enzymes and DNA Ligase Are Key Tools
in Forming Recombinant DNA Molecules
Let us begin by seeing how novel DNA molecules can be constructed in the
laboratory. A DNA fragment of interest is covalently joined to a DNA vector. The essential feature of a vector is that it can replicate autonomously in
an appropriate host. Plasmids (naturally occurring circles of DNA that act
as accessory chromosomes in bacteria) and bacteriophage ␭, a virus, are
choice vectors for cloning in E. coli. The vector can be prepared for accepting a new DNA fragment by cleaving it at a single specific site with a restriction enzyme. For example, the plasmid pSC101, a 9.9-kb doublehelical circular DNA molecule, is split at a unique site by the EcoRI
restriction enzyme. The staggered cuts made by this enzyme produce complementary single-stranded ends, which have specific affinity for each other
and hence are known as cohesive or sticky ends. Any DNA fragment can be
inserted into this plasmid if it has the same cohesive ends. Such a fragment
can be prepared from a larger piece of DNA by using the same restriction
enzyme as was used to open the plasmid DNA (Figure 6.11).

The single-stranded ends of the fragment are then complementary to those
of the cut plasmid. The DNA fragment and the cut plasmid can be annealed
and then joined by DNA ligase, which catalyzes the formation of a phosphodiester bond at a break in a DNA chain. DNA ligase requires a free 3⬘hydroxyl group and a 5⬘-phosphoryl group. Furthermore, the chains joined
by ligase must be in a double helix. An energy source such as ATP or NAD⫹
is required for the joining reaction, as will be discussed in Chapter 27.
This cohesive-end method for joining DNA mole5⬘ P

6.2.2 Plasmids and Lambda Phage Are Choice Vectors
for DNA Cloning in Bacteria

Recombinant DNA Technology

Many plasmids and bacteriophages have been ingeniously modified to enhance the delivery of recombinant DNA molecules into bacteria and to facilitate the selection of bacteria harboring these vectors. Plasmids are circular duplex DNA molecules occurring naturally in some bacteria and
ranging in size from 2 to several hundred kilobases. They carry genes for
the inactivation of antibiotics, the production of toxins, and the breakdown
of natural products. These accessory chromosomes can replicate independently of the host chromosome. In contrast with the host genome, they are
dispensable under certain conditions. A bacterial cell may have no plasmids
at all or it may house as many as 20 copies of a plasmid.

Tetracycline

pBR322 Plasmid. One of the most useful plasmids for cloning is pBR322,
which contains genes for resistance to tetracycline and ampicillin (an antibiotic like penicillin). Different endonucleases can cleave this plasmid at
a variety of unique sites, at which DNA fragments can be inserted. Insertion of DNA at the EcoRI restriction site does not alter either of the genes
for antibiotic resistance (Figure 6.13). However, insertion at the HindIII,
SalI, or BamHI restriction site inactivates the gene for tetracycline resistance, an effect called insertional inactivation. Cells containing pBR322 with
a DNA insert at one of these restriction sites are resistant to ampicillin but
sensitive to tetracycline, and so they can be readily selected. Cells that failed
to take up the vector are sensitive to both antibiotics, whereas cells containing pBR322 without a DNA insert are resistant to both.

Lambda (␭) Phage. Another widely used vector, ␭ phage, enjoys a choice
of life styles: this bacteriophage can destroy its host or it can become part
of its host (Figure 6.14). In the lytic pathway, viral functions are fully expressed: viral DNA and proteins are quickly produced and packaged into
virus particles, leading to the lysis (destruction) of the host cell and the sudden appearance of about 100 progeny virus particles, or virions. In the lysogenic pathway, the phage DNA becomes inserted into the host-cell genome
and can be replicated together with host-cell DNA for many generations,
remaining inactive. Certain environmental changes can trigger the expression of this dormant viral DNA, which leads to the formation of progeny
virus and lysis of the host. Large segments of the 48-kb DNA of l phage
are not essential for productive infection and can be replaced by foreign
DNA, thus making ␭ phage an ideal vector.

selects DNA molecules that contain an

Mutant ␭ phages designed for cloning have been constructed. An especially useful one called ␭gt-␭␤ contains only two EcoRI cleavage sites instead of the five normally present (Figure 6.15). After cleavage, the middle
segment of this ␭ DNA molecule can be removed. The two remaining pieces
of DNA (called arms) have a combined length equal to 72% of a normal
genome length. This amount of DNA is too little to be packaged into a ␭
particle, because only DNA measuring from 75% to 105% of a normal
genome in length can be readily packaged. However, a suitably long DNA
insert (such as 10 kb) between the two ends of ␭ DNA enables such a recombinant DNA molecule (93% of normal length) to be packaged. Nearly all infective l particles formed in this way will contain an inserted piece of foreign DNA. Another advantage of using these modified viruses as vectors is
that they enter bacteria much more easily than do plasmids. Among the variety of ␭ mutants that have been constructed for use as cloning vectors, one
of them, called a cosmid, is essentially a hybrid of ␭ phage and a plasmid
that can serve as a vector for large DNA inserts (as large as 45 kb).

FIGURE 6.16 Electron micrograph of
M13 filamentous phage. [Courtesy of Dr.
Robley Williams.]

M13 Phage. Another very useful vector for cloning DNA, M13 phage is especially useful for sequencing the inserted DNA. This filamentous virus is
900 nm long and only 9 nm wide (Figure 6.16). Its 6.4-kb single-stranded circle of DNA is protected by a coat of 2710 identical protein subunits. M13 enters E. coli through the bacterial sex pilus, a protein appendage that permits
the transfer of DNA between bacteria. The single-stranded DNA in the virus
particle [called the ( ⫹ ) strand] is replicated through an intermediate circular double-stranded replicative form (RF) containing ( ⫹ ) and ( ⫺ ) strands.
Only the ( ⫹ ) strand is packaged into new virus particles. About a thousand
progeny M13 are produced per generation. A striking feature of M13 is that
it does not kill its bacterial host. Consequently, large quantities of M13 can
be grown and easily harvested (1 gram from 10 liters of culture fluid).
An M13 vector is prepared for cloning by cutting its circular RF DNA
at a single site with a restriction enzyme. The cut is made in a polylinker region that contains a series of closely spaced recognition sites for restriction
enzymes; only one of each such sites is present in the vector. A doublestranded foreign DNA fragment produced by cleavage with the same restriction enzyme is then ligated to the cut vector (Figure 6.17). The foreign
DNA can be inserted in two different orientations because the ends of both

Page 155

DNA molecules are the same. Hence, half the new ( ⫹ ) strands packaged
into virus particles will contain one of the strands of the foreign DNA, and
half will contain the other strand. Infection of E. coli by a single virus particle will yield a large amount of single-stranded M13 DNA containing the
same strand of the foreign DNA. DNA cloned into M13 can be easily sequenced. An oligonucleotide that hybridizes adjacent to the polylinker region is used as a primer for sequencing the insert. This oligomer is called a
universal sequencing primer because it can be used to sequence any insert. M13
is ideal for sequencing but not for long-term propagation of recombinant
DNA, because inserts longer than about 1 kb are not stably maintained.

6.2.3 Specific Genes Can Be Cloned from Digests
of Genomic DNA
Ingenious cloning and selection methods have made feasible the isolation of
a specific DNA segment several kilobases long out of a genome containing
more than 3 ⫻ 106 kb. Let us see how a gene that is present just once in a human genome can be cloned. A sample containing many molecules of total genomic DNA is first mechanically sheared or partly digested by restriction enzymes into large fragments (Figure 6.18). This nearly random population of
overlapping DNA fragments is then separated by gel electrophoresis to isolate a set about 15 kb long. Synthetic linkers are attached to the ends of these
fragments, cohesive ends are formed, and the fragments are then inserted into
a vector, such as ␭ phage DNA, prepared with the same cohesive ends. E. coli
bacteria are then infected with these recombinant phages. The resulting lysate
contains fragments of human DNA housed in a sufficiently large number of
virus particles to ensure that nearly the entire genome is represented. These
phages constitute a genomic library. Phages can be propagated indefinitely,
and so the library can be used repeatedly over long periods.
This genomic library is then screened to find the very small portion of
phages harboring the gene of interest. For the human genome, a calculation
shows that a 99% probability of success requires screening about 500,000
clones; hence, a very rapid and efficient screening process is essential. Rapid
screening can be accomplished by DNA hybridization.

FIGURE 6.19 Screening a genomic
library for a specific gene. Here, a
plate is tested from plaques containing
gene a of Figure 6.18.

A dilute suspension of the recombinant phages is first plated on a lawn
of bacteria (Figure 6.19). Where each phage particle has landed and infected
a bacterium, a plaque containing identical phages develops on the plate. A
replica of this master plate is then made by applying a sheet of nitrocellulose. Infected bacteria and phage DNA released from lysed cells adhere to
the sheet in a pattern of spots corresponding to the plaques. Intact bacteria
on this sheet are lysed with NaOH, which also serves to denature the DNA
so that it becomes accessible for hybridization with a 32P-labeled probe. The
presence of a specific DNA sequence in a single spot on the replica can be detected by using a radioactive complementary DNA or RNA molecule as a probe.
Autoradiography then reveals the positions of spots harboring recombinant
DNA. The corresponding plaques are picked out of the intact master plate
and grown. A single investigator can readily screen a million clones in a day.
This method makes it possible to isolate virtually any gene, provided that
a probe is available. How does one obtain a specific probe? One approach
is to start with the corresponding mRNA from cells in which it is abundant.
For example, precursors of red blood cells contain large amounts of mRNA
for hemoglobin, and plasma cells are rich in mRNAs for antibody molecules. The mRNAs from these cells can be fractionated by size to enrich for
the one of interest. As will be described shortly, a DNA complementary to
this mRNA can be synthesized in vitro and cloned to produce a highly specific probe.
Alternatively, a probe for a gene can be prepared if part of the amino acid
sequence of the protein encoded by the gene is known. A problem arises because a given peptide sequence can be encoded by a number of oligonucleotides (Figure 6.20). Thus, for this purpose, peptide sequences containing tryptophan and methionine are preferred, because these amino acids are
specified by a single codon, whereas other amino acid residues have between
two and six codons (Section 5.5.1).

FIGURE 6.20 Probes generated from a protein sequence. A probe can be generated
by synthesizing all possible oligonucleotides encoding a particular sequence of amino acids.
Because of the degeneracy of the genetic code, 256 distinct oligonucleotides must be
synthesized to ensure that the probe matching the sequence of seven amino acids is present.

All the DNA sequences (or their complements) that encode the selected
peptide sequence are synthesized by the solid-phase method and made radioactive by phosphorylating their 5⬘ ends with 32P from [32P]-ATP. The
replica plate is exposed to a mixture containing all these probes and autoradiographed to identify clones with a complementary DNA sequence.
Positive clones are then sequenced to determine which ones have a sequence
matching that of the protein of interest. Some of them may contain the desired gene or a significant segment of it.
6.2.4 Long Stretches of DNA Can Be Efficiently
Analyzed by Chromosome Walking
A typical genomic DNA library housed in ␭ phage vectors consists of DNA
fragments about 15 kb long. However, many eukaryotic genes are much
longer—for example, the dystrophin gene, which is mutated in Duchenne
muscular dystrophy, is 2000 kb long. How can such long stretches of DNA
be analyzed? The development of cosmids helped because these chimeras

7552dc06_143-170

5/4/01

4:51 PM

Page 157

of plasmids and ␭ phages can house 45-kb inserts. Much larger pieces of
DNA can now be propagated in bacterial artificial chromosomes (BACs) or
yeast artificial chromosomes (YACs). YACs contain a centromere, an autonomous replication sequence (ARS, where replication begins), a pair of telomeres (normal ends of eukaryotic chromosomes), selectable marker genes, and
a cloning site (Figure 6.21). Genomic DNA is partly digested by a restriction endonuclease that cuts, on the average, at distant sites. The fragments
are then separated by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis, and the large ones ( ⬃
450 kb) are eluted and ligated into YACs. Artificial chromosomes bearing
inserts ranging from 100 to 1000 kb are efficiently replicated in yeast cells.
Equally important in analyzing large genes is the capacity to scan long
regions of DNA. The principle technique for this purpose makes use of
overlaps in the library fragments. The fragments in a cosmid or YAC library
are produced by random cleavage of many DNA molecules, and so some of
the fragments overlap one another. Suppose that a fragment containing region A selected by hybridization with a complementary probe A⬘ also contains region B (Figure 6.22). A new probe B⬘ can be prepared by cleaving
this fragment between regions A and B and subcloning region B. If the library is screened again with probe B⬘, new fragments containing region B
will be found. Some will contain a previously unknown region C. Hence,
we now have information about a segment of DNA encompassing regions
A, B, and C. This process of subcloning and rescreening is called chromosome walking. Long stretches of DNA can be analyzed in this way, provided
that each of the new probes is complementary to a unique region.

6.3 MANIPULATING THE GENES OF EUKARYOTES
Eukaryotic genes, in a simplified form, can be introduced into bacteria, and
the bacteria can be used as factories to produce a desired protein product.
It is also possible to introduce DNA into higher organisms. In regard to animals, this ability provides a valuable tool for examining gene action, and it
will be the basis of gene therapy. In regard to plants, introduced genes may
make a plant resistant to pests or capable of growing in harsh conditions or
able to carry greater quantities of essential nutrients. The manipulation of
eukaryotic genes holds much promise for medical and agricultural benefits,
but it is also the source of controversy.

interrupted genes cannot be expressed by bacteria, which lack the machinery to splice introns out of the primary transcript. However, this difficulty
can be circumvented by causing bacteria to take up recombinant DNA that
is complementary to mRNA. For example, proinsulin, a precursor of insulin, is synthesized by bacteria harboring plasmids that contain DNA complementary to mRNA for proinsulin (Figure 6.23). Indeed, bacteria produce much of the insulin used today by millions of diabetics.
The key to forming complementary DNA (cDNA) is the enzyme reverse
transcriptase. As discussed in Section 5.3.1, a retrovirus uses this enzyme to
form a DNA–RNA hybrid in replicating its genomic RNA. Reverse transcriptase synthesizes a DNA strand complementary to an RNA template if
it is provided with a DNA primer that is base-paired to the RNA and contains a free 3⬘-OH group. We can use a simple sequence of linked thymidine [oligo(T)] residues as the primer. This oligo(T) sequence pairs with
the poly(A) sequence at the 3⬘ end of most eukaryotic mRNA molecules
(Section 5.4.4), as shown in Figure 6.24. The reverse transcriptase then synthesizes the rest of the cDNA strand in the presence of the four deoxyribonucleoside triphosphates. The RNA strand of this RNA–DNA hybrid is
subsequently hydrolyzed by raising the pH. Unlike RNA, DNA is resistant to alkaline hydrolysis. The single-stranded DNA is converted into
double-stranded DNA by creating another primer site. The enzyme terminal transferase adds nucleotides—for instance, several residues of dG—to
the 3⬘ end of DNA. Oligo(dC) can bind to dG residues and prime the synthesis of the second DNA strand. Synthetic linkers can be added to this
double-helical DNA for ligation to a suitable vector. Complementary DNA
for all mRNA that a cell contains can be made, inserted into vectors, and
then inserted into bacteria. Such a collection is called a cDNA library.

Complementary DNA molecules can be inserted into vectors that favor
their efficient expression in hosts such as E. coli. Such plasmids or phages are
called expression vectors. To maximize transcription, the cDNA is inserted into
the vector in the correct reading frame near a strong bacterial promoter site.
In addition, these vectors ensure efficient translation by encoding a ribosomebinding site on the mRNA near the initiation codon. Clones of cDNA can be
screened on the basis of their capacity to direct the synthesis of a foreign protein in bacteria. A radioactive antibody specific for the protein of interest can
be used to identify colonies of bacteria that harbor the corresponding cDNA
vector (Figure 6.25). As described in Section 6.2.3, spots of bacteria on a
replica plate are lysed to release proteins, which bind to an applied nitrocellulose filter. A 125I-labeled antibody specific for the protein of interest is
added, and autoradiography reveals the location of the desired colonies on the
master plate. This immunochemical screening approach can be used whenever a protein is expressed and corresponding antibody is available.
6.3.2 Gene-Expression Levels Can Be Comprehensively
Examined
Most genes are present in the same quantity in every cell—namely, one copy
per haploid cell or two copies per diploid cell. However, the level at which a
gene is expressed, as indicated by mRNA quantities, can vary widely, ranging from no expression to hundreds of mRNA copies per cell. Gene-expression patterns vary from cell type to cell type, distinguishing, for example, a
muscle cell from a nerve cell. Even within the same cell, gene-expression levels may vary as the cell responds to changes in physiological circumstances.
Using our knowledge of complete genome sequences, it is now possible
to analyze the pattern and level of expression of all genes in a particular cell
or tissue. One of the most powerful methods developed to date for this purpose is based on hybridization. High-density arrays of oligonucleotides, called
DNA microarrays or gene chips, can be constructed either through lightdirected chemical synthesis carried out with photolithographic microfabrication techniques used in the semiconductor industry or by placing very small
dots of oligonucleotides or cDNAs on a solid support such as a microscope slide.
Fluorescently labeled cDNA is hybridized to the chip to reveal the expression
level for each gene, identifiable by its known location on the chip. (Figure 6.26).

FIGURE 6.26 Gene expression

expression levels of thousands of genes
can be simultaneously analyzed using DNA
microarrays (gene chips). Here, analysis of
1733 genes in 84 breast tumor samples

into distinct classes based on their gene
expression patterns. Red corresponds to
gene induction and green corresponds to

The intensity of the fluorescent spot on the chip reveals the extent of transcription of a particular gene. DNA chips have been prepared that contain
oligonucleotides complementary to all known open reading frames, 6200
in number, within the yeast genome (Figure 6.27). An analysis of mRNA
pools with the use of these chips revealed, for example, that approximately
50% of all yeast genes are expressed at steady-state levels of between 0.1
and 1.0 mRNA copy per cell. This method readily detected variations in
expression levels displayed by specific genes under different growth conditions. These tools will continue to grow in power as genome sequencing
efforts continue.
6.3.3 New Genes Inserted into Eukaryotic Cells
Can Be Efficiently Expressed

Bacteria are ideal hosts for the amplification of DNA molecules. They can
also serve as factories for the production of a wide range of prokaryotic and
eukaryotic proteins. However, bacteria lack the necessary enzymes to carry
out posttranslational modifications such as the specific cleavage of polypeptides and the attachment of carbohydrate units. Thus, many eukaryotic
genes can be correctly expressed only in eukaryotic host cells. The introduction of recombinant DNA molecules into cells of higher organisms can
also be a source of insight into how their genes are organized and expressed.
How are genes turned on and off in embryological development? How does
a fertilized egg give rise to an organism with highly differentiated cells that
are organized in space and time? These central questions of biology can now
be fruitfully approached by expressing foreign genes in mammalian cells.
Recombinant DNA molecules can be introduced into animal cells in several ways. In one method, foreign DNA molecules precipitated by calcium
phosphate are taken up by animal cells. A small fraction of the imported
DNA becomes stably integrated into the chromosomal DNA. The efficiency of incorporation is low, but the method is useful because it is easy to
apply. In another method, DNA is microinjected into cells. A fine-tipped
(0.1-␮m-diameter) glass micropipet containing a solution of foreign DNA
is inserted into a nucleus (Figure 6.28). A skilled investigator can inject hundreds of cells per hour. About 2% of injected mouse cells are viable and contain the new gene. In a third method, viruses are used to bring new genes
into animal cells. The most effective vectors are retroviruses. As discussed
in Section 5.3.1, retroviruses replicate through DNA intermediates, the reverse of the normal flow of information. A striking feature
of the life cycle of a retrovirus is that the double-helical DNA
form of its genome, produced by the action of reverse tranFertilized
mouse egg
scriptase, becomes randomly incorporated into host chromosomal DNA. This DNA version of the viral genome,
called proviral DNA, can be efficiently expressed by the host
cell and replicated along with normal cellular DNA. Retroviruses do not usually kill their hosts. Foreign genes have
been efficiently introduced into mammalian cells by infecting them with vectors derived from Moloney murine leukemia
virus, which can accept inserts as long as 6 kb. Some genes

can serve as efficient protein factories. Vectors based on these large-genome
viruses have been engineered to express DNA inserts efficiently.
6.3.4 Transgenic Animals Harbor and Express Genes
That Were Introduced into Their Germ Lines
Genetically engineered giant mice illustrate the expression of foreign genes
in mammalian cells (Figure 6.29). Giant mice were produced by introducing the gene for rat growth hormone into a fertilized mouse egg. Growth hormone (somatotropin), a 21-kd protein, is normally synthesized by the pituitary gland. A deficiency of this hormone produces dwarfism, and an excess
leads to gigantism. The gene for rat growth hormone was placed on a plasmid next to the mouse metallothionein promoter (Figure 6.30). This promoter site is normally located on a chromosome, where it controls the transcription of metallothionein, a cysteine-rich protein that has high affinity for
heavy metals. Metallothionein binds to and sequesters heavy metals, many
of which are toxic for metabolic processes (Section 17.3.2). The synthesis of
this protective protein by the liver is induced by heavy-metal ions such as
cadmium. Hence, if mice contain the new gene, its expression can be initiated by the addition of cadmium to the drinking water.

gene for rat growth hormone (shown in

activated by the addition of heavy metals,
such as cadmium ion.

Several hundred copies of the plasmid containing the promoter and
growth-hormone gene were microinjected into the male pronucleus of a fertilized mouse egg, which was then inserted into the uterus of a foster mother
mouse. A number of mice that developed from such microinjected eggs contained the gene for rat growth hormone, as shown by Southern blots of their
DNA. These transgenic mice, containing multiple copies ( ⬃ 30 per cell) of
the rat growth-hormone gene, grew much more rapidly than did control
mice. In the presence of cadmium, the level of growth hormone in these
mice was 500 times as high as in normal mice, and their body weight at maturity was twice normal. The foreign DNA had been transcribed and its five
introns correctly spliced out to form functional mRNA. These experiments
strikingly demonstrate that a foreign gene under the control of a new promoter
site can be integrated and efficiently expressed in mammalian cells.

6.3.5 Gene Disruption Provides Clues to Gene Function
A gene’s function can also be probed by inactivating the gene and looking
for resulting abnormalities. Powerful methods have been developed for accomplishing gene disruption (also called gene knockout) in organisms such as
yeast and mice. These methods rely on the process of homologous recombination. Through this process, regions of strong sequence similarity exchange
segments of DNA. Foreign DNA inserted into a cell thus can disrupt any
gene that is at least in part homologous by exchanging segments (Figure
6.31). Specific genes can be targeted if their nucleotide sequences are known.
For example, the gene knockout approach has been applied to the genes
encoding gene regulatory proteins (also called transcription factors) that
control the differentiation of muscle cells. When both copies of the gene for
the regulatory protein myogenin are disrupted, an animal dies at birth because it lacks functional skeletal muscle. Microscopic inspection reveals that
the tissues from which muscle normally forms contain precursor cells that
have failed to differentiate fully (Figure 6.32). Heterozygous mice containing one normal myogenin gene and one disrupted gene appear normal, indicating that the level of gene expression is not essential for its function.
Analogous studies have probed the function of many other genes to generate animal models for known human genetic diseases.

6.3.6 Tumor-Inducing Plasmids Can Be Used
to Introduce New Genes into Plant Cells
The common soil bacterium Agrobacterium tumefaciens infects plants and
introduces foreign genes into plants cells (Figure 6.33). A lump of tumor
tissue called a crown gall grows at the site of infection. Crown galls synthesize opines, a group of amino acid derivatives that are metabolized by the
infecting bacteria. In essence, the metabolism of the plant cell is diverted to
satisfy the highly distinctive appetite of the intruder. Tumor-inducing plasmids (Ti plasmids) that are carried by Agrobacterium carry instructions for
the switch to the tumor state and the synthesis of opines. A small part of
the Ti plasmid becomes integrated into the genome of infected plant cells;
this 20-kb segment is called T-DNA (transferred DNA; Figure 6.34).

Ti plasmid derivatives can be used as vectors to deliver foreign genes
into plant cells. First, a segment of foreign DNA is inserted into the T-DNA
region of a small plasmid through the use of restriction enzymes and ligases. This synthetic plasmid is added to Agrobacterium colonies harboring
naturally occurring Ti plasmids. By recombination, Ti plasmids containing
the foreign gene are formed. These Ti vectors hold great promise as tools
for exploring the genomes of plant cells and modifying plants to improve
their agricultural value and crop yield. However, they are not suitable for
transforming all types of plants. Ti-plasmid transfer is effective with dicots
(broad-leaved plants such as grapes) and a few kinds of monocots but not
with economically important cereal monocots.
Foreign DNA can be introduced into cereal monocots as well as dicots
by applying intense electric fields, a technique called electroporation (Figure
6.35). First, the cellulose wall surrounding plant cells is removed by adding
cellulase; this treatment produces protoplasts, plant cells with exposed
plasma membranes. Electric pulses are then applied to a suspension of protoplasts and plasmid DNA. Because high electric fields make membranes
transiently permeable to large molecules, plasmid DNA molecules enter the
cells. The cell wall is then allowed to reform, and the plant cells are again
viable. Maize cells and carrot cells have been stably transformed in this way
with the use of plasmid DNA that includes genes for resistance to antibiotics. Moreover, the transformed cells efficiently express the plasmid DNA.
Electroporation is also an effective means of delivering foreign DNA into
animal cells.
The most effective means of transforming plant cells is through the use
of “gene guns,” or bombardment-mediated transformation. DNA is coated
onto 1-␮m-diameter tungsten pellets, and these microprojectiles are fired

at the target cells with a velocity greater than 400 m s⫺1. Despite its apparent crudeness, this technique is proving to be the most effective way of transforming plants, especially important crop species such as soybean, corn,
wheat, and rice. The gene-gun technique affords an opportunity to develop
genetically modified organisms (GMOs) with beneficial characteristics.
Such characteristics could include the ability to grow in poor soils, resistance to natural climatic variation, resistance to pests, and nutritional fortification. These crops might be most useful in developing countries. The use
of genetically modified organisms is highly controversial at this point because of fears of unexpected side effects.
The first GMO to come to market was a tomato characterized by delayed ripening, rendering it ideal for shipment. Pectin is a polysaccharide
that gives tomatoes their firmness and is naturally destroyed by the enzyme polygalacturonase. As pectin is destroyed, the tomatoes soften, making shipment difficult. DNA was introduced that disrupts the polygalacturonase gene. Less of the enzyme was produced, and the tomatoes
stayed fresh longer. However, the tomato’s poor taste hindered its commercial success.

6.4 NOVEL PROTEINS CAN BE ENGINEERED
BY SITE-SPECIFIC MUTAGENESIS
Much has been learned about genes and proteins by analyzing mutated
genes selected from the repertoire offered by nature. In the classic genetic
approach, mutations are generated randomly throughout the genome, and
those exhibiting a particular phenotype are selected. Analysis of these mutants then reveals which genes are altered, and DNA sequencing identifies
the precise nature of the changes. Recombinant DNA technology now makes
it feasible to create specific mutations in vitro.
6.4.1 Proteins with New Functions Can Be Created
Through Directed Changes in DNA
We can construct new genes with designed properties by making three kinds
of directed changes: deletions, insertions, and substitutions.
Deletions. A specific deletion can be produced by cleaving a plasmid at
two sites with a restriction enzyme and ligating to form a smaller circle. This
simple approach usually removes a large block of DNA. A smaller deletion
can be made by cutting a plasmid at a single site. The ends of the linear
DNA are then digested with an exonuclease that removes nucleotides from
both strands. The shortened piece of DNA is then ligated to form a circle
that is missing a short length of DNA about the restriction site.

Page 165

Substitutions: Oligonucleotide-Directed Mutagenesis. Mutant proteins with single amino acid substitutions can be readily produced by
oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis (Figure 6.36). Suppose that we want to
replace a particular serine residue with cysteine. This mutation can be made
if (1) we have a plasmid containing the gene or cDNA for the protein and
(2) we know the base sequence around the site to be altered. If the serine of
interest is encoded by TCT, we need to change the C to a G to get cysteine,
which is encoded by TGT. This type of mutation is called a point mutation
because only one base is altered. The key to this mutation is to prepare an
oligonucleotide primer that is complementary to this region of the gene except that it contains TGT instead of TCT. The two strands of the plasmid
are separated, and the primer is then annealed to the complementary strand.
The mismatch of 1 base pair of 15 is tolerable if the annealing is carried out
at an appropriate temperature. After annealing to the complementary
strand, the primer is elongated by DNA polymerase, and the doublestranded circle is closed by adding DNA ligase. Subsequent replication of
this duplex yields two kinds of progeny plasmid, half with the original TCT
sequence and half with the mutant TGT sequence. Expression of the plasmid containing the new TGT sequence will produce a protein with the desired substitution of serine for cysteine at a unique site. We will encounter
many examples of the use of oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis to precisely alter regulatory regions of genes and to produce proteins with tailormade features.
Insertions: Cassette Mutagenesis. In another valuable approach, cassette
mutagenesis, plasmid DNA is cut with a pair of restriction enzymes to remove a short segment (Figure 6.37). A synthetic double-stranded oligonucleotide (the cassette) with cohesive ends that are complementary to the ends
of the cut plasmid is then added and ligated. Each plasmid now contains
the desired mutation. It is convenient to introduce into the plasmid unique
restriction sites spaced about 40 nucleotides apart so that mutations can be
readily made anywhere in the sequence.
Designer Genes. Novel proteins can also be created by splicing together
gene segments that encode domains that are not associated in nature. For
example, a gene for an antibody can be joined to a gene for a toxin to produce a chimeric protein that kills cells that are recognized by the antibody.
These immunotoxins are being evaluated as anticancer agents. Entirely new
genes can be synthesized de novo by the solid-phase method. Furthermore,
noninfectious coat proteins of viruses can be produced in large amounts by
recombinant DNA methods. They can serve as synthetic vaccines that are
safer than conventional vaccines prepared by inactivating pathogenic
viruses. A subunit of the hepatitis B virus produced in yeast is proving to
be an effective vaccine against this debilitating viral disease.
6.4.2 Recombinant DNA Technology Has Opened New Vistas
Recombinant DNA technology has revolutionized the analysis of the molecular basis of life. Complex chromosomes are being rapidly mapped and
dissected into units that can be manipulated and deciphered. The amplification of genes by cloning has provided abundant quantities of DNA for
sequencing. Genes are now open books that can be read. New insights are
emerging, as exemplified by the discovery of introns in eukaryotic genes.
Central questions of biology, such as the molecular basis of development,
are now being fruitfully explored. DNA and RNA sequences provide a
wealth of information about evolution. Biochemists now move back and
forth between gene and protein and feel at home in both areas of inquiry.

Gene or cDNA

Analyses of genes and cDNA can reveal the existence of previously unknown proteins, which can be isolated and purified (Figure 6.38A). Conversely,
purification of a protein can be the starting point for the isolation and cloning
of its gene or cDNA (Figure 6.39B). Very small amounts of protein or nucleic
acid suffice because of the sensitivity of recently developed microchemical
techniques and the amplification afforded by gene cloning and the polymerase
chain reaction. The powerful techniques of protein chemistry, nucleic acid
chemistry, immunology, and molecular genetics are highly synergistic.
New kinds of proteins can be created by altering genes in specific ways.
Site-specific mutagenesis opens the door to understanding how proteins
fold, recognize other molecules, catalyze reactions, and process information.
Large amounts of protein can be obtained by expressing cloned genes or
cDNAs in bacteria or eukaryotic cells. Hormones, such as insulin, and antiviral agents, such as interferon, are being produced by bacteria. Tissue plasminogen activator, which is administered to a patient after a heart attack, is
made in large quantities in mammalian cells. A new pharmacology, using proteins produced by recombinant DNA technology as drugs, is beginning to
significantly alter the practice of medicine. Recombinant DNA technology is
also providing highly specific diagnostic reagents, such as DNA probes for
the detection of genetic diseases, infections, and cancers. Human gene therapy has been successfully initiated. White blood cells deficient in adenosine
deaminase, an essential enzyme, are taken from patients and returned after
being transformed in vitro to correct the genetic error. Agriculture, too, is
benefiting from genetic engineering. Transgenic crops with increased resistance to insects, herbicides, and drought have been produced.

The Basic Tools of Gene Exploration

The recombinant DNA revolution in biology is rooted in the repertoire
of enzymes that act on nucleic acids. Restriction enzymes are a key group
among them. These endonucleases recognize specific base sequences in
double-helical DNA and cleave both strands of the duplex, forming specific fragments of DNA. These restriction fragments can be separated

and displayed by gel electrophoresis. The pattern that they form on the
gel is a fingerprint of a DNA molecule. A DNA fragment containing a
particular sequence can be identified by hybridizing it with a labeled
single-stranded DNA probe (Southern blotting).
Rapid sequencing techniques have been developed to further the
analysis of DNA molecules. DNA can be sequenced by controlled interruption of replication (Sanger dideoxy method). The fragments produced
are separated by gel electrophoresis and visualized by autoradiography of
a 32P label at the 5⬘ end or by fluorescent tags. The recent sequencing of
many complete genomes demonstrates the power of these techniques.
DNA probes for hybridization reactions, as well as new genes, can be
synthesized by the automated solid-phase method. The technique is to
add deoxyribonucleoside 3⬘-phosphoramidites to one another to form a
growing chain that is linked to an insoluble support. DNA chains a hundred nucleotides long can be readily synthesized by this automated solidphase method. The polymerase chain reaction makes it possible to greatly
amplify specific segments of DNA in vitro. The region amplified is determined by the placement of a pair of primers that are added to the target DNA along with a thermostable DNA polymerase and deoxyribonucleoside triphosphates. The exquisite sensitivity of PCR makes it a choice
technique in detecting pathogens and cancer markers, in genotyping, and
in reading DNA from fossils that are many thousands of years old.

Novel Proteins Can Be Engineered by Site-Specific Mutagenesis

New genes can be constructed in the laboratory, introduced into host cells,
and expressed. Novel DNA molecules are made by joining fragments
that have complementary cohesive ends produced by the action
of a restriction enzyme. DNA ligase seals breaks in DNA chains. Vectors for propagating the DNA include plasmids, ␭ phage, and yeast artificial chromosomes. Specific genes can be cloned from a genomic library
using a DNA or RNA probe. Foreign DNA can be expressed after insertion into prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells by the appropriate vector.
The production of giant mice by injecting the gene for rat growth hormone into fertilized mouse eggs vividly shows that mammalian cells can
be genetically altered in a designed way. New DNA can be brought into
plant cells by the soil bacterium Agrobacterium tumefaciens, which harbors Ti (tumor-inducing) plasmids. DNA can also be introduced into
plant cells by applying intense electric fields, which render them transiently permeable to very large molecules, or by bombarding them with
DNA-coated microparticles. Gene-expression levels can be examined
through the hybridization of cellular mRNA to arrays of oligonucleotides synthesized on solid supports (gene chips). The functions of
particular genes can also be investigated by disruption.
Specific mutations can be generated in vitro to engineer novel proteins.
A mutant protein with a single amino acid substitution can be produced
by priming DNA replication with an oligonucleotide encoding the new
amino acid. Plasmids can be engineered to permit the facile insertion of
a DNA cassette containing any desired mutation. The techniques of
protein and nucleic acid chemistry are highly synergistic. Investigators
now move back and forth between gene and protein with great facility.
Recombinant DNA technology is beginning to significantly alter the
practice of medicine by providing new diagnostic and therapeutic agents
and revealing molecular mechanisms of disease.

1. Reading sequences. An autoradiogram of a sequencing gel containing
four lanes of DNA fragments is
shown in the adjoining illustration.
(a) What is the sequence of the DNA
fragment? (b) Suppose that the

the template strand sequence is

2. The right template. Ovalbumin is the major protein of egg
white. The chicken ovalbumin gene contains eight exons separated by seven introns. Should one use ovalbumin cDNA or
ovalbumin genomic DNA to form the protein in E. coli? Why?
3. Cleavage frequency. The restriction enzyme AluI cleaves at the
sequence 5⬘-AGCT-3⬘, and NotI cleaves at 5⬘-GCGGCCGC3⬘. What would be the average distance between cleavage sites
for each enzyme on digestion of double-stranded DNA?
4. The right cuts. Suppose that a human genomic library is prepared by exhaustive digestion of human DNA with the EcoRI
restriction enzyme. Fragments averaging about 4 kb in length
would be generated.
(a) Is this procedure suitable for cloning large genes? Why?
(b) Is this procedure suitable for mapping extensive stretches of
the genome by chromosome walking? Why?
5. A revealing cleavage. Sickle-cell anemia arises from a mutation in the gene for the ␤ chain of human hemoglobin. The
change from GAG to GTG in the mutant eliminates a cleavage
site for the restriction enzyme MstII, which recognizes the target sequence CCTGAGG. These findings form the basis of a
diagnostic test for the sickle-cell gene. Propose a rapid procedure
for distinguishing between the normal and the mutant gene.
Would a positive result prove that the mutant contains GTG in
place of GAG?
6. Many melodies from one cassette. Suppose that you have isolated an enzyme that digests paper pulp and have obtained its
cDNA. The goal is to produce a mutant that is effective at high
temperature. You have engineered a pair of unique restriction sites

in the cDNA that flank a 30-bp coding region. Propose a rapid
technique for generating many different mutations in this region.
7. A blessing and a curse. The power of PCR can also create problems. Suppose someone claims to have isolated dinosaur DNA
by using PCR. What questions might you ask to determine if it
is indeed dinosaur DNA?
8. Questions of accuracy. The stringency (Section 6.1.5) of PCR
amplification can be controlled by altering the temperature at
which the hybridization of the primers to the target DNA occurs.
How would altering the temperature of hybridization effect the
amplification? Suppose that you have a particular yeast gene A,
and you wish to see if it has a counterpart in humans. How would
controlling the stringency of the hybridization help you?
9. Terra incognita. PCR is typically used to amplify DNA that
lies between two known sequences. Suppose that you want to explore DNA on both sides of a single known sequence. Devise a
variation of the usual PCR protocol that would enable you to
amplify entirely new genomic terrain.
10. A puzzling ladder. A gel pattern displaying PCR products
shows four strong bands. The four pieces of DNA have lengths
that are approximately in the ratio of 1:2:3:4. The largest band
is cut out of the gel, and PCR is repeated with the same primers.
Again, a ladder of four bands is evident in the gel. What does
this result reveal about the structure of the encoded protein?
11. Landmarks in the genome. Many laboratories throughout the
world are mapping the human genome. It is essential that the results be merged at an early stage to provide a working physical
map of each chromosome. In particular, it is necessary to know
whether a YAC studied in one laboratory overlaps a YAC studied in another when only a small proportion of each (less than
5%) has been sequenced. Propose a simple test for overlap based
on the transfer of information but not of materials between the
two laboratories.
Chapter Integration Problem
12. Designing primers. A successful PCR experiment often depends on designing the correct primers. In particular, the Tm for
each primer should be approximately the same. What is the basis of this requirement?

control, person B is asymptomatic but some of his children have
the metabolic problem, and persons C through F display the

analysis was performed on the DNA after digestion with the restriction enzyme HindIII. Northern analysis of mRNA also was
done. In both types of analysis, the gels were probed with labeled X cDNA. Finally, a Western blot with an enzyme-linked
monoclonal antibody was used to test for the presence of protein
Y. The results are shown here. Why is person B without symptoms? Suggest possible defects in the other people.

Like members of a human family, members of molecular families often have
features in common. Such family resemblance is most easily detected by
comparing three-dimensional structure, the aspect of a molecule most
closely linked to function. Consider, for example, ribonuclease from cows,
which was introduced in our consideration of protein folding (Section 3.6).
Comparing structures reveals that the three-dimensional structure of this
protein and that of a human ribonuclease are quite similar
(Figure 7.1). Although this similarity is not unexpected,

positions are identical. Is this level sufficiently high to ensure an evolutionary relationship? If not, what level is required? In this chapter, we shall
examine the methods that are used to compare amino acid sequences and
to deduce such evolutionary relationships.
Sequence-comparison methods have become a powerful tool in modern biochemistry. Sequence databases can be probed for matches to a newly elucidated
sequence in order to identify related molecules. This information can often be
a source of considerable insight into the function and mechanism of the newly
sequenced molecule. When three-dimensional structures are available, they
may be compared to confirm relationships suggested by sequence comparisons
and to reveal others that are not readily detected at the level of sequence alone.
By examining the footprints present in modern protein sequences, the
biochemist can become a molecular archeologist able to learn about events
in the evolutionary past. Sequences comparisons can often reveal both
pathways of evolutionary descent and estimated dates of specific evolutionary landmarks. This information can be used to construct evolutionary
trees that trace the evolution of a particular protein or nucleic acid in many
cases from Archaea and Bacteria through Eukarya, including human beings. Molecular evolution can also be studied experimentally. In some cases,
DNA from fossils can be amplified by PCR methods (Section 6.1.5) and
sequenced, giving a direct view into the past. In addition, investigators can
observe molecular evolution taking place in the laboratory, through experiments based on nucleic acid replication. The results of such studies are revealing more about how evolution proceeds.

Analysis of Sequence Alignments

The exploration of biochemical evolution consists largely of an attempt to
determine how proteins, other molecules, and biochemical pathways have
been transformed through time. The most fundamental relationship between two entities is homology; two molecules are said to be homologous if
they have been derived from a common ancestor. Homologous molecules,
or homologs, can be divided into two classes (Figure 7.3). Paralogs are homologs that are present within one species. Paralogs often differ in their detailed biochemical functions. Orthologs are homologs that are present within
different species and have very similar or identical functions. Understanding the homology between molecules can reveal the evolutionary history of
the molecules as well as information about their function; if a newly sequenced protein is homologous to an already characterized protein, we have
a strong indication of the new protein’s biochemical function.
How can we tell whether two human proteins are paralogs or whether a
yeast protein is the ortholog of a human protein? As will be discussed in Section
7.2, homology is often manifested by significant similarity in nucleotide or amino
acid sequence and almost always manifested in three-dimensional structure.

7.2 STATISTICAL ANALYSIS OF SEQUENCE ALIGNMENTS
CAN DETECT HOMOLOGY
CONCEPTUAL INSIGHTS, Sequence Analysis, provides opportunities to
interactively explore issues involved in sequence alignment.

A significant sequence similarity between two molecules implies that they
are likely to have the same evolutionary origin and, therefore, the same
three-dimensional structure, function, and mechanism. Although both nucleic acid and protein sequences can be compared to detect homology, a
comparison of protein sequences is much more effective for several reasons,
most notably that proteins are built from 20 different building blocks,
whereas RNA and DNA are synthesized from only 4 building blocks.
To illustrate sequence-comparison methods, let us consider a class of
proteins called the globins. Myoglobin is a protein that binds oxygen in muscle, whereas hemoglobin is the oxygen-carrying protein in blood (Section
10.2). Both proteins cradle a heme group, an iron-containing organic molecule that binds the oxygen. Each human hemoglobin molecule is composed
of four heme-containing polypeptide chains, two identical  chains and two
identical  chains. Here, we consider only the  chain. We wish to examine the similarity between the amino acid sequence of the human  chain
and that of human myoglobin (Figure 7.4). To detect such similarity, methods have been developed for sequence alignment.

FIGURE 7.5 Comparing the amino acid sequences of hemoglobin  and
myoglobin. (A) A comparison is made by sliding the sequences of the two proteins past
one another, one amino acid at a time, and counting the number of amino acid identities
between the proteins. (B) The two alignments with the largest number of matches are
shown above the graph, which plots the matches as a function of alignment.

How can we tell where to align the two sequences? The simplest approach is to compare all possible juxtapositions of one protein sequence with
another, in each case recording the number of identical residues that are
aligned with one another. This comparison can be accomplished by simply
sliding one sequence past the other, one amino acid at a time, and counting
the number of matched residues (Figure 7.5).
For hemoglobin  and myoglobin, the best alignment reveals 23 sequence identities, spread throughout the central parts of the sequences.
However, a nearby alignment showing 22 identities is nearly as good. In
this alignment, the identities are concentrated toward the amino-terminal
end of the sequences. The sequences can be aligned to capture most of the
identities in both alignments by introducing a gap into one of the sequences
(Figure 7.6). Such gaps must often be inserted to compensate for the insertions or deletions of nucleotides that may have taken place in the gene for
one molecule but not the other in the course of evolution.

Analysis of Sequence Alignments

FIGURE 7.6 Alignment with gap
insertion. The alignment of hemoglobin
 and myoglobin after a gap has been
inserted into the hemoglobin  sequence.

The use of gaps substantially increases the complexity of sequence
alignment because, in principle, the insertion of gaps of arbitrary sizes must
be considered throughout each sequence. However, methods have been developed for the insertion of gaps in the automatic alignment of sequences.
These methods use scoring systems to compare different alignments, and
they include penalties for gaps to prevent the insertion of an unreasonable
number of them. Here is an example of such a scoring system: each identity between aligned sequences results in 10 points, whereas each gap introduced, regardless of size, results in 25 points. For the alignment shown
in Figure 7.6, there are 38 identities and 1 gap, producing a score of (38 
10  1  25  355). Overall, there are 38 matched amino acids in an average length of 147 residues; so the sequences are 25.9% identical. The next
step is to ask, Is this precentage of identity significant?
7.2.1 The Statistical Significance of Alignments Can Be
Estimated by Shuffling
The similarities in sequence in Figure 7.5 appear striking, yet there remains
the possibility that a grouping of sequence identities has occurred by chance
alone. How can we estimate the probability that a specific series of identities is a chance occurrence? To make such an estimate, the amino acid sequence in one of the proteins is “shuffled”—that is, randomly rearranged—
and the alignment procedure is repeated (Figure 7.7). This process is
repeated to build up a distribution showing, for each possible score, the
number of shuffled sequences that received that score.
When this procedure is applied to the sequences of myoglobin and hemoglobin , the authentic alignment clearly stands out (Figure 7.8). Its score
is far above the mean for the alignment scores based on shuffled sequences.
The odds of such a deviation occurring owing due to chance alone are

and the number of sequences generating

alignment score for hemoglobin  and
myoglobin (shown in red) is substantially
greater than any of these scores, strongly
suggesting that the sequence similarity is
significant.

approximately 1 in 1020. Thus, we can comfortably conclude that the two
sequences are genuinely similar; the simplest explanation for this similarity
is that these sequences are homologous—that is, that the two molecules have
descended by divergence from a common ancestor.

FIGURE 7.9 A graphic view of the Blosum-62 substitution matrix. This scoring scheme
was derived by examining substitutions that occur within aligned sequence blocks in related
proteins. Amino acids are classified into four groups (charged, red; polar, green; large and
hydrophobic, blue; other, black). Substitutions that require the change of only a single
nucleotide are shaded. To find the score for a substitution of, for instance, a Y for an H, you
find the Y in the column having H (boxed) at the top and check the number at the left. In this
case, the resulting score is 3.

7.2.2 Distant Evolutionary Relationships Can Be Detected
Through the Use of Substitution Matrices

177
Analysis of Sequence Alignments

The scoring scheme in Section 7.2.1 assigns points only to positions occupied by identical amino acids in the two sequences being compared. No
credit is given for any pairing that is not an identity. However, not all substitutions are equivalent. Some are structurally conservative substitutions, replacing one amino acid with another that is similar in size and chemical
properties. Such conservative amino acid substitutions may have relatively
minor effects on protein structure and can thus be tolerated without compromising function. In other substitutions, an amino acid replaces one that
is dissimilar. Furthermore, some amino acid substitutions result from the
replacement of only a single nucleotide in the gene sequence; whereas others require two or three replacements. Conservative and single-nucleotide
substitutions are likely to be more common than are substitutions with more
radical effects. How can we account for the type of substitution when
comparing sequences? We can approach this problem by first examining
the substitutions that have actually taken place in evolutionarily related
proteins.
From the examination of appropriately aligned sequences, substitution
matrices can be deduced. In these matrices, a large positive score corresponds to a substitution that occurs relatively frequently, whereas a large
negative score corresponds to a substitution that occurs only rarely. The
Blosum-62 substitution matrix illustrated in Figure 7.9 is an example. The
highest scores in this substitution matrix indicate that amino acids such as
cysteine (C) and tryptophan (W) tend to be conserved more than those
such as serine (S) and alanine (A). Furthermore, structurally conservative
substitutions such as lysine (K) for arginine (R) and isoleucine (I) for valine (V) have relatively high scores. When two sequences are compared,
each substitution is assigned a score based on the matrix. In addition, a gap
penalty is often assigned according to the size of the gap. For example, the
introduction of a gap lowers the alignment score by 12 points and the extension of an existing gap costs 2 points per residue. Using this scoring system, the alignment shown in Figure 7.6 receives a score of 115. In many
regions, most substitutions are conservative (defined as those substitutions
with scores greater than 0) and relatively few are strongly disfavored types
(Figure 7.10).
This scoring system detects homology between less obviously related
sequences with greater sensitivity than would a comparison of identities
only. Consider, for example, the protein leghemoglobin, an oxygen-binding
protein found in the roots of some plants. The amino acid sequence of leghemoglobin from the herb lupine can be aligned with that of human myoglobin and scored by using either the simple scoring scheme based on identities only or the Blosum-62 scoring matrix (see Figure 7.9). Repeated

shuffling and scoring provides a distribution of alignment scores (Figure
7.11). Scoring based on identities only indicates that the odds of the alignment between myoglobin and leghemoglobin occurring by chance alone are
1 in 20. Thus, although the level of similarity suggests a relationship, there
is a 5% chance that the similarity is accidental on the basis of this analysis.
In contrast, users of the substitution matrix are able to incorporate the effects of conservative substitutions. From such an analysis, the odds of the
alignment occurring by chance are calculated to be approximately 1 in 300.
Thus, an analysis performed by using the substitution matrix reaches a
much firmer conclusion about the evolutionary relationship between these
proteins (Figure 7.12).

FIGURE 7.12 Alignment of human myoglobin and lupine leghemoglobin. The use of
the Blosum-62 substitution matrix yields the alignment shown between human myoglobin
and lupine leghemoglobin, illustrating identities (orange) and conservative substitutions
(yellow). These sequences are 23% identical.

Experience with sequence analysis has led to the development of simpler
rules of thumb. For sequences longer than 100 amino acids, sequence identities greater than 25% are almost certainly not the result of chance alone;
such sequences are probably homologous. In contrast, if two sequences are
less than 15% identical, pairwise comparison alone is unlikely to indicate statistically significant similarity. For sequences that are between 15% and 25%
identical, further analysis is necessary to determine the statistical significance
of the alignment. It must be emphasized that the lack of a statistically significant degree of sequence similarity does not rule out homology. The sequences
of many proteins that have descended from common ancestors have diverged
to such an extent that the relationship between the proteins can no longer be
detected from their sequences alone. As we will see, such homologous proteins can often be detected by examining three-dimensional structures.
7.2.3 Databases Can Be Searched to Identify
Homologous Sequences
When the sequence of a protein is first determined, comparing it with all
previously characterized sequences can be a source of tremendous insight
into its evolutionary relatives and, hence, its structure and function. Indeed,

7552dc07_171-188

6/12/01

7:28 PM

Page 179

an extensive sequence comparison is almost always the first analysis performed
on a newly elucidated sequence. The sequence alignment methods heretofore
described are used to compare an individual sequence with all members of
a database of known sequences.
In 1995, investigators reported the first complete sequence of the genome
of a free-living organism, the bacterium Haemophilus influenzae. Of 1743
identified open reading frames (Section 6.3.2), 1007 (58%) could be linked by
sequence-comparison methods to some protein of known function that had
been previously characterized in another organism. An additional 347 open
reading frames could be linked to sequences in the database for which no function had yet been assigned (“hypothetical proteins”). The remaining 389 sequences did not match any sequence present in the database at the time at
which the Haemophilus influenzae sequence was completed. Thus, investigators were able to identify likely functions for more than half the proteins within
this organism solely through the use of sequence-comparison methods.

Examination of Three-Dimensional Structure

7.3 EXAMINATION OF THREE-DIMENSIONAL
STRUCTURE ENHANCES OUR UNDERSTANDING
OF EVOLUTIONARY RELATIONSHIPS
Sequence comparison is a powerful tool for extending our knowledge of protein function and kinship. However, biomolecules generally function as intricate three-dimensional structures rather than as linear polymers. Mutations occur at the level of sequence, but the effects of the mutations are at
the level of function, and function is directly related to tertiary structure.
Consequently, to gain a deeper understanding of evolutionary relationships
between proteins, we must examine three-dimensional structures, especially
in conjunction with sequence information. The techniques of structural determination are presented in Chapter 4.
7.3.1 Tertiary Structure Is More Conserved Than
Primary Structure
Because three-dimensional structure is much more closely associated with
function than is sequence, tertiary structure is more evolutionarily conserved than is primary structure. This conservation is apparent in the tertiary structures of the globins (Figure 7.13), which are extremely similar
even though the similarity between human myoglobin and lupine leghemoglobin is just barely detectable at the sequence level and that between
human hemoglobin ( chain) and lupine leghemoglobin is not statistically

significant (15.6% identity). This structural similarity firmly establishes
that the framework that binds the heme group and facilitates the reversible
binding of oxygen has been conserved over a long evolutionary period.
Anyone aware of the similar biochemical functions of hemoglobin, myoglobin, and leghemoglobin could expect the structural similarities. In a growing number of other cases, however, a comparison of three-dimensional structures has revealed striking similarities between proteins that were not
expected to be related. A case in point is the protein actin, a major component of the cytoskeleton, and heat shock protein 70 (Hsp-70), which assists
protein folding inside cells. These two proteins were found to be noticeably
similar in structure despite only 15.6% sequence identity (Figure 7.14). On
the basis of their three-dimensional structures, actin and Hsp-70 are paralogs.
The level of structural similarity strongly suggests that, despite their different biological roles in modern organisms, these proteins descended from a
common ancestor. As the three-dimensional structures of more proteins are
determined, such unexpected kinships are being discovered with increasing
frequency. The search for such kinships relies ever more frequently on computer-based search procedures that allow the three-dimensional structure of
any protein to be compared with all other known structures.
7.3.2 Knowledge of Three-Dimensional Structures Can Aid
in the Evaluation of Sequence Alignments
The sequence-comparison methods described thus far treat all positions
within a sequence equally. However, examination of families of homologous
proteins for which at least one three-dimensional structure is known has revealed that regions and residues critical to protein function are more strongly
conserved than are other residues. For example, each type of globin contains a bound heme group with an iron atom at its center. A histidine residue
that interacts directly with this iron (residue 64 in human myoglobin) is conserved in all globins. After we have identified key residues or highly conserved sequences within a family of proteins, we can sometimes identify
other family members even when the overall level of sequence similarity is
below statistical significance. Thus, the generation of sequence templates—
conserved residues that are structurally and functionally important and are
characteristic of particular families of proteins—can be useful for recognizing new family members that might be undetectable by other means. A variety of other methods for sequence classification that take advantage of
known three-dimensional structures also are being developed. Still other

7552dc07_171-188

6/12/01

7:28 PM

Page 181

methods are able to identify relatively conserved residues
within a family of homologous proteins, even without a
known three-dimensional structure. These methods are
proving to be powerful in identifying distant evolutionary
relationships.
7.3.3 Repeated Motifs Can Be Detected
by Aligning Sequences with Themselves
More than 10% of all proteins contain sets of two or more
domains that are similar to one another. The aforedescribed sequence search methods can often detect internally repeated sequences that have been characterized in
other proteins. Where repeated units do not correspond to
previously identified domains, their presence can be detected by attempting to align a given sequence with itself.
This alignment is most easily visualized with the use of a
self-diagonal plot. Here, the protein sequence is displayed
on both the vertical and the horizontal axes, running from
amino to carboxyl terminus; a dot is placed at each point
in the space defined by the axes at which the amino acid
FIGURE 7.15 A self-diagonal plot for the TATA-box-binding

of gene transcription (Section 28.x.x).
The statistical significance of such repeats can be tested by aligning the
regions in question as if these regions were sequences from separate proteins. For the TATA-box-binding protein, the alignment is highly significant: 30% of the amino acids are identical over 90 residues (Figure 7.16A).
The estimated probability of such an alignment occurring by chance is 1 in
1013. The determination of the three-dimensional structure of the TATAbox-binding protein confirmed the presence of repeated structures; the protein is formed of two nearly identical domains (Figure 7.16B). The evidence
is convincing that the gene encoding this protein evolved by duplication of
a gene encoding a single domain.

7.3.4 Convergent Evolution: Common Solutions
to Biochemical Challenges
Thus far, we have been exploring proteins derived from common ancestors—
that is, through divergent evolution. In other cases, clear examples have been
found of proteins that are structurally similar in important ways but are not
descended from a common ancestor. How might two unrelated proteins come
to resemble each other structurally? Two proteins evolving independently may
have converged on a similar structure in order to perform a similar biochemical activity. Perhaps that structure was an especially effective solution to a biochemical problem that organisms face. The process by which very different
evolutionary pathways lead to the same solution is called convergent evolution.
One example of convergent evolution is found among the serine proteases. These enzymes, to be discussed in more detail in Chapter 9, cleave
peptide bonds by hydrolysis. Figure 7.17 shows for two such enzymes the
structure of the active sites—that is, the sites on the proteins at which the
hydrolysis reaction takes place. These active-site structures are remarkably
similar. In each case, a serine residue, a histidine residue, and an aspartic
acid residue are positioned in space in nearly identical arrangements. As we
will see, this is the case because chymotrypsin and subtilisin use the same
mechanistic solution to the problem of peptide hydrolysis. At first glance,
this similarity might suggest that these proteins are homologous. However,
striking differences in the overall structures of these proteins make an evolutionary relationship extremely unlikely (Figure 7.18). Whereas chymotrypsin consists almost entirely of  sheets, subtilisin contains extensive
-helical structure. Moreover, the key serine, histidine, and aspartic acid
residues do not occupy similar positions or even appear in the same order
within the two sequences. It is extremely unlikely that two proteins evolving from a common ancestor could have retained similar active-site structures while other aspects of the structure changed so dramatically.

7.3.5 Comparison of RNA Sequences Can Be a Source
of Insight into Secondary Structures
A comparison of homologous RNA sequences can be a source of important
insights into evolutionary relationships in a manner similar to that already
described. In addition, such comparisons provide clues to the threedimensional structure of the RNA itself. As noted in Chapter 5, singlestranded nucleic acid molecules fold back on themselves to form elaborate
structures held together by Watson-Crick base-pairing and other interactions. In a family of sequences that form such base-paired structures, base
sequences may vary, but base-pairing ability is conserved. Consider, for
example, a region from a large RNA molecule present in the ribosomes of

7552dc07_171-188

all organisms (Figures 7.19). In the region shown, the E. coli sequence has a
guanine (G) residue in position 9 and a cytosine (C) residue in position 22,
whereas the human sequence has uracil (U) in position 9 and adenine (A) in
position 22. Examination of the six sequences shown in Figure 7.20 (and
many others) reveals that the bases in positions 9 and 22 retain the ability to
form a Watson-Crick base pair even though the identities of the bases in these
positions vary. Base-pairing ability is also conserved in neighboring positions; we can deduce that two segments with such compensating mutations
are likely to form a double helix. Where sequences are known for several
homologous RNA molecules, this type of sequence analysis can often suggest complete secondary structures as well as some additional interactions.

ON THE BASIS OF SEQUENCE INFORMATION
CONCEPTUAL INSIGHTS, Sequence Analysis, offers insights into evolutionary
trees through interactive analysis of simulated evoluntionary histories.

Time (millions of years)

The observation that homology is often manifested as sequence similarity
suggests that the evolutionary pathway relating the members of a family of
proteins may be deduced by examination of sequence similarity. This approach is based on the notion that sequences that are more similar to one
another have had less evolutionary time to diverge from

This method can be illustrated by using the three globin
sequences in Figures 7.10 and 7.12, as well as the se200
quence for the human hemoglobin  chain. These sequences can be aligned with the additional constraint that
400
gaps, if present, should be at the same positions in all of
the proteins. These aligned sequences can be used to con600
struct an evolutionary tree in which the length of the
branch connecting each pair of proteins is proportional
to the number of amino acid differences between the se800
quences (Figure 7.20).
Such comparisons reveal only the relative divergence
times—for example, that myoglobin diverged from hemoFIGURE 7.20 An evolutionary tree for globins. The branching

trees can be calibrated by comparing the deduced branch points with divergence times determined from the fossil record. For example, the duplication
leading to the two chains of hemoglobin appears to have occurred 350 million
years ago. This estimate is supported by the observation that jawless fish such
as the lamprey, which diverged from bony fish approximately 400 million
years ago, contain hemoglobins built from a single type of subunit (Figure 7.21).
These methods can be applied to both relatively modern and very ancient molecules, such as the ribosomal RNAs that are found in all organisms. Indeed, it was such an RNA sequence analysis that led to the suggestion that Archaea are a distinct group of organisms that diverged from
Bacteria very early in evolutionary history.

7.5 MODERN TECHNIQUES MAKE THE EXPERIMENTAL
EXPLORATION OF EVOLUTION POSSIBLE
Two techniques of biochemistry have made it possible to examine the course
of evolution more directly and not simply by inference. The polymerase
chain reaction (Section 6.1.5) allows the direct examination of ancient DNA
sequences, releasing us, at least in some cases, from the constraints of being able to examine existing genomes from living organisms only. Molecular evolution may be investigated through the use of combinatorial chemistry,
the process of producing large populations of molecules en masse and selecting for a biochemical property. This exciting process provides a glimpse
into the types of molecules that may have existed in the RNA world.
7.5.1 Ancient DNA Can Sometimes Be Amplified and Sequenced

Homo sapiens
Neanderthal

Chimpanzee

FIGURE 7.22 Placing Neanderthal on
an evolutionary tree. Comparison of
DNA sequences revealed that Neanderthal
is not on the line of direct descent leading
to Homo sapiens but, instead, branched
off earlier and then became extinct.

The tremendous chemical stability of DNA (Section 2.2.7) makes the molecule well suited to its role as the storage site of genetic information. So stable is the molecule that samples of DNA have survived for many thousands
of years under appropriate conditions. With the development of PCR methods, such ancient DNA can sometimes be amplified and sequenced. This
approach has been applied to mitochondrial DNA from a Neanderthal fossil estimated at between 30,000 and 100,000 years of age found near Düsseldorf, Germany, in 1856. Investigators managed to identify a total of 379
bases of sequence. Comparison with a number of the corresponding sequences from Homo sapiens revealed between 22 and 36 substitutions, considerably fewer than the average of 55 differences between human beings
and chimpanzees over the common bases in this region. Further analysis
suggested that the common ancestor of modern human beings and Neanderthals lived approximately 600 million years ago. An evolutionary tree
constructed by using these and other data revealed that the Neanderthal was
not an intermediate between chimpanzees and human beings but, instead,
was an evolutionary “dead end” that became extinct (Figure 7.22).
Note that earlier studies describing the sequencing of much more ancient DNA such as that found in insects trapped in amber appear to have
been flawed; contaminating modern DNA was responsible for the sequences determined. Successful sequencing of ancient DNA requires sufficient DNA for reliable amplification and the rigorous exclusion of all
sources of contamination.
7.5.2 Molecular Evolution Can Be Examined Experimentally
Evolution requires three processes: (1) the generation of a diverse population, (2) the selection of members based on some criterion of fitness, and
(3) reproduction to enrich the population in more fit members (Section 2.2).

7552dc07_171-188

5/29/01

8:25 AM

Page 185

Nucleic acid molecules are capable of undergoing all three processes in vitro
under appropriate conditions. The results of such studies enable us to glimpse
how evolutionary processes might have generated catalytic activities and specific binding abilities—important biochemical functions in all living systems.
A diverse population of nucleic acid molecules can be synthesized in the
laboratory by the process of combinatorial chemistry, which rapidly produces large populations of a particular type of molecule such as a nucleic
acid. A population of molecules of a given size can be generated randomly
so that many or all possible sequences are present in the mixture. When an
initial population has been generated, it is subjected to a selection process
that isolates specific molecules with desired binding or reactivity properties. Finally, molecules that have survived the selection process are allowed
to reproduce through the use of PCR; primers are directed toward specific
sequences included at the ends of each member of the population.
As an example of this approach, consider an experiment that set a goal
of creating an RNA molecule capable of binding adenosine triphosphate
and related nucleotides. Such ATP-bonding molecules are of interest because they might have been present in the RNA world. An initial population of RNA molecules 169 nucleotides long was created; 120 of the positions differed randomly, with equimolar mixtures of adenine, cytosine,
guanine, and uracil. The initial synthetic pool that was used contained approximately 1014 RNA molecules. Note that this number is a very small
fraction of the total possible pool of random 120-base sequences. From this
pool, those molecules that bound to ATP, which had been immobilized on
a column, were selected (Figure 7.23).

Selected RNA
molecules

A collection of RNA molecules of random
sequences is synthesized by combinatorial
chemistry. This collection is selected for
the ability to bind ATP by passing the RNA
through an ATP affinity column (Section
4.1.3). The ATP-binding RNA molecules are
released from the column by washing with
excess ATP, and replicated. The process of
selection and replication is then repeated
several times. The final RNA products with
significant ATP-binding ability are isolated
and characterized.

FIGURE 7.24 A conserved secondary
structure. The secondary structure shown
is common to RNA molecules selected for
ATP binding.

The collection of molecules that were bound well by the ATP affinity
column was allowed to reproduce by reverse transcription into DNA, amplification by PCR, and transcription back into RNA. This new population
was subjected to additional rounds of selection for ATP-binding activity.
After eight generations, members of the selected population were characterized by sequencing. Seventeen different sequences were obtained, 16 of
which could form the structure shown in Figure 7.24. Each of these molecules bound ATP with high affinity, as indicated by dissociation constants
less than 50 M.
The folded structure of the ATP-binding region from one of these RNAs
was determined by nuclear magnetic resonance (Section 4.5.1) methods
(Figure 7.25). As expected, this 40-nucleotide molecule is composed of two
Watson-Crick base-paired helical regions separated by an 11-nucleotide
loop. This loop folds back on itself in an intricate way to form a deep pocket
into which the adenine ring can fit. Thus, a structure was generated, or
evolved, that was capable of a specific interaction.

Protein and nucleic acid sequences are two of the primary languages of
biochemistry. Sequence-alignment methods are the most powerful tools
of the evolutionary detective. Sequences can be aligned to maximize
their similarity, and the significance of these alignments can be judged
by statistical tests. The detection of a statistically significant alignment
between two sequences strongly suggests that two sequences are related
by divergent evolution from a common ancestor. The use of substitution matrices makes the detection of more distant evolutionary relationships possible. Any sequence can be used to probe sequence databases to identify related sequences present in the same organism or in
other organisms.

The evolutionary kinship between proteins may be even more profoundly evident in the conserved three-dimensional structures. The
analysis of three-dimensional structure in combination with analysis of
especially conserved sequences has made it possible to determine evolutionary relationships that are not possible to detect by other means.
Sequence-comparison methods can also be used to detect imperfectly repeated sequences within a protein, indicative of linked similar domains.

FIGURE 7.25 RNA molecule binds ATP.

Exploring evolution biochemically often means searching for homology, or relatedness, between molecules, because homologous molecules,
or homologs, evolved from a common ancestor. Paralogs are homologous molecules that are found in one species and have acquired different functions through evolutionary time. Orthologs are homologous
molecules that are found in different species and have similar or identical functions.

Evolutionary Trees Can Be Constructed on the Basis of Sequence

Construction of an evolutionary tree based on sequence comparisons

myoglobin and hemoglobin as well as the  and  subunits of hemoglobin. Evolutionary trees based on sequences can be compared to those
based on fossil records.

Selected Readings

The exploration of evolution can also be a laboratory science. In favorable cases, PCR amplification of well-preserved samples allows the determination of the nucleotide sequences from extinct organisms. Sequences so determined can help authenticate aspects of an evolutionary
tree constructed by other means. Molecular evolutionary experiments
performed in the test tube can examine how molecules such as ligandbinding RNA molecules might have been generated.

PROBLEMS
1. What’s the score? Using the identity-based scoring system
(Section 7.2), calculate the score for the following alignment. Do
you think the score is statistically significant?

2. Sequence and structure. A comparison of the aligned amino
acid sequences of two proteins each consisting of 150 amino acids
reveals them to be only 8% identical. However, their threedimensional structures are very similar. Are these two proteins
related evolutionarily? Explain.

Generate a shuffled version of sequence 2 by randomly reordering these 10 amino acids. Align your shuffled sequence with sequence 1 without allowing gaps, and calculate the alignment
score between sequence 1 and your shuffled sequence.
8. Interpreting the score. Suppose that the sequences of two proteins each with 200 amino acids are aligned and that the percentage of identical residues has been calculated. How would you
interpret each of the following results in regard to the possible
divergence of the two proteins from a common ancestor?
(a) 80%, (b) 50%, (c) 20%, (d) 10%
9. A set of three. The sequences of three proteins (A, B, and C)
are compared with one another, yielding the following levels of
identity:

Which alignment has a higher score if the identity-based scoring system (Section 7.2) is used? Which alignment has a higher
score if the Blosum-62 substitution matrix (Figure 7.9) is used?

Assume that the sequence matches are distributed relatively uniformly along each aligned sequence pair. Would you expect protein A and protein C to have similar three-dimensional structures? Explain.

4. Discovering a new base pair. Examine the ribosomal RNA
sequences in Figure 7.19. In sequences that do not contain
Watson-Crick base pairs, what base tends to be paired with G?
Propose a structure for your new base pair.

10. RNA alignment. Sequences of an RNA fragment from five
species have been determined and aligned. Propose a likely secondary structure for these fragments.

5. Overwhelmed by numbers. Suppose that you wish to synthesize a pool of RNA molecules that contain all four bases at each
of 40 positions. How much RNA must you have in grams if the
pool is to have at least a single molecule of each sequence? The
average molecular weight of a nucleotide is 330 g mol1.
6. Form follows function. The three-dimensional structure of
biomolecules is more conserved evolutionarily than is sequence.
Why is this the case?
7. Shuffling. Using the identity-based scoring system (Section
7.2), calculate the alignment score for the alignment of the following two short sequences:

11. Evolutionary time machine. It has been suggested that ancestral protein sequences might be inferred from evolutionary
trees of sequences that exist today. The Conceptual Insights
module on sequence analysis allows you to try your hand at inferring ancestral sequences from model evolutionary trees. Based
on this experience, explain why you would not expect to be able
to successfully infer dinosaur sequences.

8.1 ENZYMES ARE POWERFUL AND HIGHLY
SPECIFIC CATALYSTS
Enzymes accelerate reactions by factors of as much as a million or more
(Table 8.1). Indeed, most reactions in biological systems do not take place
at perceptible rates in the absence of enzymes. Even a reaction as simple as
the hydration of carbon dioxide is catalyzed by an enzyme—namely, carbonic anhydrase (Section 9.2). The transfer of CO2 from the tissues into the
blood and then to the alveolar air would be less complete in the absence of
this enzyme. In fact, carbonic anhydrase is one of the fastest enzymes
known. Each enzyme molecule can hydrate 106 molecules of CO2 per second. This catalyzed reaction is 107 times as fast as the uncatalyzed one. We
will consider the mechanism of carbonic anhydrase catalysis in Chapter 9.
Enzymes are highly specific both in the reactions that they catalyze and in
their choice of reactants, which are called substrates. An enzyme usually catalyzes a single chemical reaction or a set of closely related reactions. Side reactions leading to the wasteful formation of by-products are rare in
enzyme-catalyzed reactions, in contrast with uncatalyzed ones.
Let us consider proteolytic enzymes as an example. In vivo, these enzymes
catalyze proteolysis, the hydrolysis of a peptide bond.

ing: it will cleave any peptide bond with little regard to the identity of the
adjacent side chains. Trypsin, a digestive enzyme, is quite specific and catalyzes the splitting of peptide bonds only on the carboxyl side of lysine and
arginine residues (Figure 8.1A). Thrombin, an enzyme that participates in
blood clotting, is even more specific than trypsin. It catalyzes the hydrolysis of Arg–Gly bonds in particular peptide sequences only (Figure 8.1B).
DNA polymerase I, a template-directed enzyme (Section 27.x.x), is another highly specific catalyst. It adds nucleotides to a DNA strand that is being synthesized, in a sequence determined by the sequence of nucleotides in
another DNA strand that serves as a template. DNA polymerase I is remarkably precise in carrying out the instructions given by the template. It inserts
the wrong nucleotide into a new DNA strand less than one in a million times.
The specificity of an enzyme is due to the precise interaction of the substrate
with the enzyme. This precision is a result of the intricate three-dimensional
structure of the enzyme protein.

8.1.1 Many Enzymes Require Cofactors for Activity
The catalytic activity of many enzymes depends on the presence of small
molecules termed cofactors, although the precise role varies with the cofactor and the enzyme. Such an enzyme without its cofactor is referred to as an
apoenzyme; the complete, catalytically active enzyme is called a holoenzyme.
Apoenzyme ⫹ cofactor ⫽ holoenzyme
Cofactors can be subdivided into two groups: metals and small organic molecules (Table 8.2). The enzyme carbonic anhydrase, for example, requires

CHAPTER 8 • Basic Concepts and Kinetics

Cofactors that are small organic molecules are called coenzymes. Often
derived from vitamins, coenzymes can be either tightly or loosely bound to
the enzyme. If tightly bound, they are called prosthetic groups. Loosely associated coenzymes are more like cosubstrates because they bind to and are
released from the enzyme just as substrates and products are. The use of the
same coenzyme by a variety of enzymes and their source in vitamins sets
coenzymes apart from normal substrates, however. Enzymes that use the
same coenzyme are usually mechanistically similar. In Chapter 9, we will
examine the mechanistic importance of cofactors to enzyme activity. A more
detailed discussion of coenzyme vitamins can be found in Section 8.6.
8.1.2 Enzymes May Transform Energy
from One Form into Another
In many biochemical reactions, the energy of the reactants
is converted with high efficiency into a different form. For example, in photosynthesis, light energy is converted into
chemical-bond energy through an ion gradient. In mitochondria, the free energy contained in small molecules derived from food is converted first into the free energy of an
ion gradient and then into a different currency, the free energy of adenosine triphosphate. Enzymes may then use the
chemical-bond energy of ATP in many ways. The enzyme
myosin converts the energy of ATP into the mechanical energy of contracting muscles. Pumps in the membranes of
cells and organelles, which can be thought of as enzymes
that move substrates rather than chemically altering them,
create chemical and electrical gradients by using the energy
of ATP to transport molecules and ions (Figure 8.2). The
molecular mechanisms of these energy-transducing enzymes are being unraveled. We will see in subsequent chapters how unidirectional cycles of discrete steps—binding,
chemical transformation, and release—lead to the conversion of one form of energy into another.

8.1.3 Enzymes Are Classified on the Basis
of the Types of Reactions That They Catalyze
FIGURE 8.2 An energy-transforming enzyme. Ca2⫹ ATPase

Many enzymes have common names that provide little
information about the reactions that they catalyze. For
example, a proteolytic enzyme secreted by the pancreas
is called trypsin. Most other enzymes are named for their substrates and
for the reactions that they catalyze, with the suffix “ase” added. Thus, an
ATPase is an enzyme that breaks down ATP, whereas ATP synthase is
an enzyme that synthesizes ATP.
To bring some consistency to the classification of enzymes, in 1964
the International Union of Biochemistry established an Enzyme Commission to develop a nomenclature for enzymes. Reactions were divided into
six major groups numbered 1 through 6 (Table 8.3). These groups were
subdivided and further subdivided, so that a four-digit number preceded
by the letters EC for Enzyme Commission could precisely identify all
enzymes.
Consider as an example nucleoside monophosphate (NMP) kinase, an
enzyme that we will examine in detail in the next chapter (Section 9.4). It
catalyzes the following reaction:

NMP kinase transfers a phosphoryl group from ATP to NMP to form a
nucleoside diphosphate (NDP) and ADP. Consequently, it is a transferase,
or member of group 2. Many groups in addition to phosphoryl groups, such
as sugars and carbon units, can be transferred. Transferases that shift a phosphoryl group are designated 2.7. Various functional groups can accept the
phosphoryl group. If a phosphate is the acceptor, the transferase is designated 2.7.4. The final number designates the acceptor more precisely. In regard to NMP kinase, a nucleoside monophosphate is the acceptor, and the
enzyme’s designation is EC 2.7.4.4. Although the common names are used
routinely, the classification number is used when the precise identity of the
enzyme might be ambiguous.

8.2 FREE ENERGY IS A USEFUL THERMODYNAMIC
FUNCTION FOR UNDERSTANDING ENZYMES
Some of the principles of thermodynamics were introduced in Chapter 1—
notably the idea of free energy (G). To fully understand how enzymes operate, we need to consider two thermodynamic properties of the reaction:
(1) the free-energy difference (⌬G) between the products and reactants
and (2) the energy required to initiate the conversion of reactants to products. The former determines whether the reaction will be spontaneous,
whereas the later determines the rate of the reaction. Enzymes affect only
the latter. First, we will consider the thermodynamics of reactions and then,
in Section 8.3, the rates of reactions.
8.2.1 The Free-Energy Change Provides Information About the
Spontaneity but Not the Rate of a Reaction
As stated in Section 1.3.3, the free-energy change of a reaction (⌬G) tells us
if the reaction can occur spontaneously:
1. A reaction can occur spontaneously only if ⌬G is negative. Such reactions
are said to be exergonic.
2. A system is at equilibrium and no net change can take place if ⌬G is zero.
3. A reaction cannot occur spontaneously if ⌬G is positive. An input of free
energy is required to drive such a reaction. These reactions are termed
endergonic.

CHAPTER 8 • Basic Concepts and Kinetics

Two additional points need to be emphasized. The ⌬G of a reaction depends only on the free energy of the products (the final state) minus the free
energy of the reactants (the initial state). The ⌬G of a reaction is independent of the path (or molecular mechanism) of the transformation. The mechanism of a reaction has no effect on ⌬G. For example, the ⌬G for the oxidation of glucose to CO2 and H2O is the same whether it occurs by combustion
in vitro or by a series of enzyme-catalyzed steps in a cell. The ⌬G provides
no information about the rate of a reaction. A negative ⌬G indicates that a
reaction can occur spontaneously, but it does not signify whether it will proceed at a perceptible rate. As will be discussed shortly (Section 8.3), the rate
of a reaction depends on the free energy of activation (⌬G‡), which is largely
unrelated to the ⌬G of the reaction.
8.2.2 The Standard Free-Energy Change of a Reaction Is
Related to the Equilibrium Constant
As for any reaction, we need to be able to determine ⌬G for an enzymecatalyzed reaction in order to know whether the reaction is spontaneous or
an input of energy is required. To determine this important thermodynamic
parameter, we need to take into account the nature of both the reactants and
the products as well as their concentrations.
Consider the reaction

in which ⌬G° is the standard free-energy change, R is the gas constant, T is
the absolute temperature, and [A], [B], [C], and [D] are the molar concentrations (more precisely, the activities) of the reactants. ⌬G° is the freeenergy change for this reaction under standard conditions—that is, when
each of the reactants A, B, C, and D is present at a concentration of 1.0 M
(for a gas, the standard state is usually chosen to be 1 atmosphere). Thus,
the ⌬G of a reaction depends on the nature of the reactants (expressed in the
⌬G° term of equation 1) and on their concentrations (expressed in the logarithmic term of equation 1).
A convention has been adopted to simplify free-energy calculations for
biochemical reactions. The standard state is defined as having a pH of 7.
Consequently, when H⫹ is a reactant, its activity has the value 1 (corresponding to a pH of 7) in equations 1 and 4 (below). The activity of water
also is taken to be 1 in these equations. The standard free-energy change at
pH 7, denoted by the symbol ⌬G°⬘ will be used throughout this book. The
kilocalorie (abbreviated kcal) and the kilojoule (kJ) will be used as the units
of energy. One kilocalorie is equivalent to 4.184 kilojoules.
The relation between the standard free energy and the equilibrium constant of a reaction can be readily derived. This equation is important because
it displays the energetic relation between products and reactants in terms of
their concentrations. At equilibrium, ⌬G ⫽ 0. Equation 1 then becomes

(8)
where ⌬G°⬘ is here expressed in kilocalories per mole because of the choice
of the units for R in equation 7. Thus, the standard free energy and the equilibrium constant of a reaction are related by a simple expression. For example, an equilibrium constant of 10 gives a standard free-energy change
of ⫺1.36 kcal mol⫺1 (⫺5.69 kJ mol⫺1) at 25°C (Table 8.4). Note that, for
each 10-fold change in the equilibrium constant, the ⌬G°⬘ changes by
1.36 kcal mol⫺1 (5.69 kJ mol⫺1).
As an example, let us calculate ⌬G°⬘ and ⌬G for the isomerization of
dihydroxyacetone phosphate (DHAP) to glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate
(GAP). This reaction takes place in glycolysis (Section 16.1.4). At equilibrium,
the ratio of GAP to DHAP is 0.0475 at 25°C (298 K) and pH 7. Hence,
K⬘eq ⫽ 0.0475. The standard free-energy change for this reaction is then
calculated from equation 6:
⌬G°⬘ ⫽ ⫺2.303RT log10 K⬘eq

⫽ ⫹1.80 kcal mol⫺1 (7.53 kJ mol⫺1 )
Under these conditions, the reaction is endergonic. DHAP will not spontaneously convert to GAP.
Now let us calculate ⌬G for this reaction when the initial concentration
of DHAP is 2 ⫻ 10⫺4 M and the initial concentration of GAP is 3 ⫻
10⫺6 M. Substituting these values into equation 1 gives
⌬G ⫽ 1.80 kcal mol⫺1 ⫹ 2.303RT log10

This negative value for the ⌬G indicates that the isomerization of DHAP
to GAP is exergonic and can occur spontaneously when these species are
present at the aforestated concentrations. Note that ⌬G for this reaction is
negative, although ⌬G°⬘ is positive. It is important to stress that whether the
⌬G for a reaction is larger, smaller, or the same as ⌬G°⬘ depends on the concentrations of the reactants and products. The criterion of spontaneity for a
reaction is ⌬G, not ⌬G°⬘. This point is important because reactions that are
not spontaneous based on ⌬G°⬘ can be made spontaneous by adjusting the
concentrations of reactants and products. This principle is the basis of the
coupling of reactions to form metabolic pathways (Chapter 14).

CHAPTER 8 • Basic Concepts and Kinetics

8.2.3 Enzymes Alter Only the Reaction Rate and Not the
Reaction Equilibrium
Because enzymes are such superb catalysts, it is tempting to ascribe to them
powers that they do not have. An enzyme cannot alter the laws of thermodynamics and consequently cannot alter the equilibrium of a chemical reaction. This inability means that an enzyme accelerates the forward and reverse reactions by precisely the same factor. Consider the interconversion
of A and B. Suppose that, in the absence of enzyme, the forward rate constant (kF) is 10⫺4 s⫺1 and the reverse rate constant (kR) is 10⫺6 s⫺1. The
equilibrium constant K is given by the ratio of these rate constants:

The equilibrium concentration of B is 100 times that of A, whether or not
enzyme is present. However, it might take considerable time to approach
this equilibrium without enzyme, whereas equilibrium would be attained
rapidly in the presence of a suitable enzyme. Enzymes accelerate the attainment of equilibria but do not shift their positions. The equilibrium position is
a function only of the free-energy difference between reactants and products.

8.3 ENZYMES ACCELERATE REACTIONS BY FACILITATING
THE FORMATION OF THE TRANSITION STATE
The free-energy difference between reactants and products accounts for the
equilibrium of the reaction, but enzymes accelerate how quickly this equilibrium is attained. How can we explain the rate enhancement in terms of
thermodynamics? To do so, we have to consider not the end points of the
reaction but the chemical pathway between the end points.
A chemical reaction of substrate S to form product P goes through a
transition state S‡ that has a higher free energy than does either S or P. The
double dagger denotes a thermodynamic property of the transition state.
The transition state is the most seldom occupied species along the reaction
pathway because it is the one with the highest free energy. The difference
in free energy between the transition state and the substrate is called the
Gibbs free energy of activation or simply the activation energy, symbolized
by ⌬G‡, as mentioned in Section 8.2.1 (Figure 8.3).

Note that the energy of activation, or ⌬G‡, does not enter into the final ⌬G
calculation for the reaction, because the energy input required to reach the
transition state is returned when the transition state forms the product. The
activation-energy barrier immediately suggests how enzymes enhance reaction rate without altering ⌬G of the reaction: enzymes function to lower
the activation energy, or, in other words, enzymes facilitate the formation of
the transition state.
One approach to understanding how enzymes achieve this facilitation is
to assume that the transition state (S‡) and the substrate (S) are in equilibrium.

The rate of the reaction is proportional to the concentration of S‡:

because only S‡ can be converted into product. The concentration of S‡ is
in turn related to the free energy difference between S‡ and S, because these
two chemical species are assumed to be in equilibrium; the greater the difference between these two states, the smaller the amount of S‡.
Because the reaction rate is proportional to the concentration of S‡, and
the concentration of S‡ depends on ⌬G‡, the rate of reaction V depends on
⌬G‡. Specifically,
‡

h

In this equation, k is Boltzmann’s constant, and h is Planck’s constant. The
value of kT/h at 25°C is 6.2 ⫻ 1012 s⫺1. Suppose that the free energy of activation is 6.82 kcal mol⫺1 (28.53 kJ mol⫺1). The ratio [S‡]/[S] is then 10⫺5
(see Table 8.4). If we assume for simplicity’s sake that [S] ⫽ 1M, then the
reaction rate V is 6.2 ⫻ 107 s⫺1. If ⌬G‡ were lowered by 1.36 kcal mol⫺1
(5.69 kJ mol⫺1), the ratio [S‡]/[S] is then 10⫺4, and the reaction rate would
be 6.2 ⫻ 108 s⫺1. As Table 8.4 shows, a decrease of 1.36 kcal mol⫺1 in ⌬G‡
yields a tenfold larger V. A relatively small decrease in ⌬G‡ (20% in this
particular reaction) results in a much greater increase in V.
Thus, we see the key to how enzymes operate: Enzymes accelerate reactions by decreasing ⌬G‡, the activation energy. The combination of substrate
and enzyme creates a new reaction pathway whose transition-state energy
is lower than that of the reaction in the absence of enzyme (see Figure 8.3).
The lower activation energy means that more molecules have the required
energy to reach the transition state. Decreasing the activation barrier is analogous to lowering the height of a high-jump bar; more athletes will be able
to clear the bar. The essence of catalysis is specific binding of the transition
state.

“I think that enzymes are molecules
that are complementary in structure to
the activated complexes of the reactions
that they catalyze, that is, to the
molecular configuration that is
intermediate between the reacting
substances and the products of
reaction for these catalyzed processes.
The attraction of the enzyme molecule
for the activated complex would thus
lead to a decrease in its energy and
hence to a decrease in the energy of
activation of the reaction and to an
increase in the rate of reaction.”

8.3.1 The Formation of an Enzyme–Substrate Complex Is the
First Step in Enzymatic Catalysis
Much of the catalytic power of enzymes comes from their bringing substrates together in favorable orientations to promote the formation of the
transition states in enzyme–substrate (ES) complexes. The substrates are
bound to a specific region of the enzyme called the active site. Most enzymes
are highly selective in the substrates that they bind. Indeed, the catalytic
specificity of enzymes depends in part on the specificity of binding.
What is the evidence for the existence of an enzyme–substrate complex?

2. X-ray crystallography has provided high-resolution images of substrates
and substrate analogs bound to the active sites of many enzymes (Figure 8.5).
In Chapter 9, we will take a close look at several of these complexes. X-ray
studies carried out at low temperatures (to slow reactions down) are providing revealing views of enzyme–substrate complexes and their subsequent

Reaction velocity

1. The first clue was the observation that, at a constant concentration of
enzyme, the reaction rate increases with increasing substrate concentration
until a maximal velocity is reached (Figure 8.4). In contrast, uncatalyzed reactions do not show this saturation effect. The fact that an enzyme-catalyzed
reaction has a maximal velocity suggests the formation of a discrete ES complex. At a sufficiently high substrate concentration, all the catalytic sites are
filled and so the reaction rate cannot increase. Although indirect, this is the
most general evidence for the existence of ES complexes.

reactions. A new technique, time-resolved crystallography, depends on cocrystallizing a photolabile substrate analog with the enzyme. The substrate
analog can be converted to substrate light, and images of the enzyme–
substrate complex are obtained in a fraction of a second by scanning the
crystal with intense, polychromatic x-rays from a synchrotron.
3. The spectroscopic characteristics of many enzymes and substrates change
on formation of an ES complex. These changes are particularly striking if
the enzyme contains a colored prosthetic group. Tryptophan synthetase, a
bacterial enzyme that contains a pyridoxal phosphate (PLP) prosthetic
group, provides a nice illustration. This enzyme catalyzes the synthesis of
L-tryptophan from L-serine and indole-derivative. The addition of L-serine
to the enzyme produces a marked increase in the fluorescence of the PLP
group (Figure 8.6). The subsequent addition of indole, the second substrate,
quenches this fluorescence to a level even lower than that of the enzyme
alone. Thus, fluorescence spectroscopy reveals the existence of an enzyme–serine complex and of an enzyme–serine–indole complex. Other
spectroscopic techniques, such as nuclear magnetic resonance and electron
spin resonance, also are highly informative about ES interactions.
8.3.2 The Active Sites of Enzymes Have Some Common Features
The active site of an enzyme is the region that binds the substrates (and the
cofactor, if any). It also contains the residues that directly participate in the
making and breaking of bonds. These residues are called the catalytic groups.
In essence, the interaction of the enzyme and substrate at the active site promotes the formation of the transition state. The active site is the region of the
enzyme that most directly lowers the ⌬G‡ of the reaction, which results in
the rate enhancement characteristic of enzyme action. Although enzymes
differ widely in structure, specificity, and mode of catalysis, a number of
generalizations concerning their active sites can be stated:
1. The active site is a three-dimensional cleft formed by groups that come
from different parts of the amino acid sequence—indeed, residues far apart
in the sequence may interact more strongly than adjacent residues in the
amino acid sequence. In lysozyme, an enzyme that degrades the cell walls
of some bacteria, the important groups in the active site are contributed by

residues numbered 35, 52, 62, 63, and 101 in the sequence of the 129 amino
acids (Figure 8.7).
2. The active site takes up a relatively small part of the total volume of an
enzyme. Most of the amino acid residues in an enzyme are not in contact
with the substrate, which raises the intriguing question of why enzymes are
so big. Nearly all enzymes are made up of more than 100 amino acid
residues, which gives them a mass greater than 10 kd and a diameter of more
than 25 Å. The “extra” amino acids serve as a scaffold to create the threedimensional active site from amino acids that are far apart in the primary
structure. Amino acids near to one another in the primary structure are often sterically constrained from adopting the structural relations necessary
to form the active site. In many proteins, the remaining amino acids also
constitute regulatory sites, sites of interaction with other proteins, or channels to bring the substrates to the active sites.
3. Active sites are clefts or crevices. In all enzymes of known structure, substrate molecules are bound to a cleft or crevice. Water is usually excluded
unless it is a reactant. The nonpolar character of much of the cleft enhances
the binding of substrate as well as catalysis. Nevertheless, the cleft may also
contain polar residues. In the nonpolar microenvironment of the active site,
certain of these polar residues acquire special properties essential for substrate binding or catalysis. The internal positions of these polar residues are
biologically crucial exceptions to the general rule that polar residues are exposed to water.
4. Substrates are bound to enzymes by multiple weak attractions. ES complexes usually have equilibrium constants that range from 10⫺2 to 10⫺8 M,
corresponding to free energies of interaction ranging from about ⫺3 to
⫺12 kcal mol⫺1 (from ⫺13 to ⫺50 kJ mol⫺1). The noncovalent interactions
in ES complexes are much weaker than covalent bonds, which have energies between ⫺50 and ⫺110 kcal mol⫺1 (between ⫺210 and ⫺460 kJ
mol⫺1). As discussed in Chapter 1 (Section 1.3.1), electrostatic interactions,
hydrogen bonds, van der Waals forces, and hydrophobic interactions mediate reversible interactions of biomolecules. Van der Waals forces become
significant in binding only when numerous substrate atoms simultaneously
come close to many enzyme atoms. Hence, the enzyme and substrate should
have complementary shapes. The directional character of hydrogen bonds
between enzyme and substrate often enforces a high degree of specificity,
as seen in the RNA-degrading enzyme ribonuclease (Figure 8.8).

5. The specificity of binding depends on the precisely defined arrangement of
atoms in an active site. Because the enzyme and the substrate interact by
means of short-range forces that require close contact, a substrate must have
a matching shape to fit into the site. Emil Fischer’s analogy of the lock and
key (Figure 8.9), expressed in 1890, has proved to be highly stimulating and
fruitful. However, we now know that enzymes are flexible and that the
shapes of the active sites can be markedly modified by the binding of substrate, as was postulated by Daniel E. Koshland, Jr., in 1958. The active site
of some enzymes assume a shape that is complementary to that of the transition state only after the substrate is bound. This process of dynamic recognition is called induced fit (Figure 8.10).

8.4 THE MICHAELIS-MENTEN MODEL ACCOUNTS
FOR THE KINETIC PROPERTIES OF MANY ENZYMES
The primary function of enzymes is to enhance rates of reactions so that
they are compatible with the needs of the organism. To understand how enzymes function, we need a kinetic description of their activity. For many enzymes, the rate of catalysis V0, which is defined as the number of moles of
product formed per second, varies with the substrate concentration [S] in a
manner shown in Figure 8.11. The rate of catalysis rises linearly as substrate
concentration increases and then begins to level off and approach a maximum at higher substrate concentrations. Before we can accurately interpret

7552dc08_189-226

this graph, we need to understand how it is generated. Consider an enzyme
that catalyzes the S to P by the following pathway:

The extent of product formation is determined as a function of time for a
series of substrate concentrations (Figure 8.12). As expected, in each case,
the amount of product formed increases with time, although eventually a
time is reached when there is no net change in the concentration of S or P.
The enzyme is still actively converting substrate into product and visa versa,
but the reaction equilibrium has been attained. Figure 8.13A illustrates the
changes in concentration observed in all of the reaction participants with
time until equilibrium has been reached.
Enzyme kinetics are more easily approached if we can ignore the back
reaction. We define V0 as the rate of increase in product with time when [P]
is low; that is, at times close to zero (hence, V0) (Figure 8.13B). Thus, for
the graph in Figure 8.11, V0 is determined for each substrate concentration
by measuring the rate of product formation at early times before P accumulates (see Figure 8.12).
We begin our kinetic examination of enzyme activity with the graph
shown in Figure 8.11. At a fixed concentration of enzyme, V0 is almost linearly proportional to [S] when [S] is small but is nearly independent of [S]
when [S] is large. In 1913, Leonor Michaelis and Maud Menten proposed
a simple model to account for these kinetic characteristics. The critical feature in their treatment is that a specific ES complex is a necessary intermediate in catalysis. The model proposed, which is the simplest one that accounts for the kinetic properties of many enzymes, is

An enzyme E combines with substrate S to form an ES complex, with a rate
constant k1. The ES complex has two possible fates. It can dissociate to E
and S, with a rate constant k⫺1, or it can proceed to form product P, with a
rate constant k2. Again, we assume that almost none of the product reverts
to the initial substrate, a condition that holds in the initial stage of a reaction before the concentration of product is appreciable.
We want an expression that relates the rate of catalysis to the concentrations of substrate and enzyme and the rates of the individual steps. Our

To simplify matters, we will work under the steady-state assumption. In a
steady state, the concentrations of intermediates, in this case [ES], stay the
same even if the concentrations of starting materials and products are
changing. This occurs when the rates of formation and breakdown of the
ES complex are equal. Setting the right-hand sides of equations 11 and 12
equal gives

By rearranging equation 13, we obtain

Equation 14 can be simplified by defining a new constant, KM, called the

Note that KM has the units of concentration. KM is an important characteristic of enzyme–substrate interactions and is independent of enzyme and

Now let us examine the numerator of equation 16. The concentration of
uncombined substrate [S] is very nearly equal to the total substrate concentration, provided that the concentration of enzyme is much lower than

to the total enzyme concentration [E]T minus the concentration of the ES

This equation accounts for the kinetic data given in Figure 8.11. At very

(Vmax/KM)/[S]; that is, the rate is directly proportional to the substrate concentration. At high substrate concentration, when [S] is much greater than
KM, V0 ⫽ Vmax; that is, the rate is maximal, independent of substrate
concentration.
The meaning of KM is evident from equation 23. When [S] ⫽ KM, then
V0 ⫽ Vmax/2. Thus, KM is equal to the substrate concentration at which the
reaction rate is half its maximal value. KM is an important characteristic of
an enzyme-catalyzed reaction and is significant for its biological function.
The physiological consequence of KM is illustrated by the sensitivity of
some individuals to ethanol. Such persons exhibit facial flushing and rapid
heart rate (tachycardia) after ingesting even small amounts of alcohol. In the
liver, alcohol dehydrogenase converts ethanol into acetaldehyde.

Most people have two forms of the acetaldehyde dehydrogenase, a low KM
mitochondrial form and a high KM cytosolic form. In susceptible persons, the
mitochondrial enzyme is less active due to the substitution of a single amino
acid, and acetaldehyde is processed only by the cytosolic enzyme. Because
this enzyme has a high KM, less acetaldehyde is converted into acetate; excess
acetaldehyde escapes into the blood and accounts for the physiological effects.

The Michaelis constant, KM, and the maximal rate, Vmax, can be readily

with the use of curve-fitting programs on a computer (see the appendix to
this chapter for alternative means of determining KM and Vmax). The KM
values of enzymes range widely (Table 8.5). For most enzymes, KM lies between 10⫺1 and 10⫺7 M. The KM value for an enzyme depends on the particular substrate and on environmental conditions such as pH, temperature,
and ionic strength. The Michaelis constant, KM, has two meanings. First,
KM is the concentration of substrate at which half the active sites are filled.
Thus, KM provides a measure of the substrate concentration required for
significant catalysis to occur. In fact, for many enzymes, experimental evidence suggests that KM provides an approximation of substrate concentration in vivo. When the KM is known, the fraction of sites filled, fES, at any
substrate concentration can be calculated from
fES ⫽

冤S冥

冤S冥 ⫹ KM

(24)

Second, KM is related to the rate constants of the individual steps in the
catalytic scheme given in equation 9. In equation 15, KM is defined as
(k⫺1 ⫹ k2)/k1. Consider a limiting case in which k⫺1 is much greater than
k2. Under such circumstances, the ES complex dissociates to E and S much
more rapidly than product is formed. Under these conditions (k⫺1 ⬎⬎ k2),

(25)

The dissociation constant of the ES complex is given by
KES ⫽

冤E冥冤S冥
冤ES冥

⫽

k⫺1

(26)

In other words, KM is equal to the dissociation constant of the ES complex if
k2 is much smaller than k⫺1. When this condition is met, KM is a measure
of the strength of the ES complex: a high KM indicates weak binding; a low
KM indicates strong binding. It must be stressed that KM indicates the affinity of the ES complex only when k⫺1 is much greater than k2.
The maximal rate, Vmax, reveals the turnover number of an enzyme, which
is the number of substrate molecules converted into product by an enzyme molecule in a unit time when the enzyme is fully saturated with substrate. It is equal
to the kinetic constant k2, which is also called kcat. The maximal rate, Vmax,
reveals the turnover number of an enzyme if the concentration of active sites

7552dc08_189-226

[E]T is known, because

TABLE 8.6 Maximum turnover

and thus
k2 ⫽ Vmax Ⲑ冤E 4 T

(27)

For example, a 10⫺6 M solution of carbonic anhydrase catalyzes the formation of 0.6 M H2CO3 per second when it is fully saturated with substrate. Hence, k2 is 6 ⫻ 105 s⫺1. This turnover number is one of the largest
known. Each catalyzed reaction takes place in a time equal to 1/k2, which
is 1.7 ␮s for carbonic anhydrase. The turnover numbers of most enzymes
with their physiological substrates fall in the range from 1 to 104 per second (Table 8.6).
8.4.2 Kinetic Perfection in Enzymatic Catalysis:
The kcat/KM Criterion
When the substrate concentration is much greater than KM, the rate of catalysis is equal to kcat, the turnover number, as described in Section 8.4.1.
However, most enzymes are not normally saturated with substrate. Under
physiological conditions, the [S]/KM ratio is typically between 0.01 and 1.0.
When [S] ⬍⬍ KM, the enzymatic rate is much less than kcat because most
of the active sites are unoccupied. Is there a number that characterizes the
kinetics of an enzyme under these more typical cellular conditions? Indeed
there is, as can be shown by combining equations 10 and 16 to give
V0 ⫽

kcat
冤E冥冤S冥

(28)

When [S] ⬍⬍ KM, the concentration of free enzyme, [E], is nearly equal to
the total concentration of enzyme [ET], so

(29)

Thus, when [S] ⬍⬍ KM, the enzymatic velocity depends on the values of
kcat/KM, [S], and [E]T. Under these conditions, kcat/KM is the rate constant
for the interaction of S and E and can be used as a measure of catalytic efficiency. For instance, by using kcat/KM values, one can compare an enzyme’s preference for different substrates. Table 8.7 shows the kcat/KM

side chains.
How efficient can an enzyme be? We can approach this question by determining whether there are any physical limits on the value of kcat/KM.
Note that this ratio depends on k1, k⫺1, and k2, as can be shown by substituting for KM.

(30)

Suppose that the rate of formation of product (kcat) is much faster than the
rate of dissociation of the ES complex (k⫺1). The value of kcat/KM then
approaches k1. Thus, the ultimate limit on the value of kcat/KM is set
by k1, the rate of formation of the ES complex. This rate cannot be faster
than the diffusion-controlled encounter of an enzyme and its substrate. Diffusion limits the value of k1 so that it cannot be higher than between 108 and
109 s⫺1 M⫺1. Hence, the upper limit on kcat/KM is between 108 and
109 s⫺1 M⫺1.
The kcat/KM ratios of the enzymes superoxide dismutase, acetylcholinesterase, and triosephosphate isomerase are between 108 and 109 s⫺1
M⫺1. Enzymes such as these that have kcat/KM ratios at the upper limits
have attained kinetic perfection. Their catalytic velocity is restricted only by
the rate at which they encounter substrate in the solution (Table 8.8). Any further gain in catalytic rate can come only by decreasing the time for diffusion. Remember that the active site is only a small part of the total enzyme
structure. Yet, for catalytically perfect enzymes, every encounter between
enzyme and substrate is productive. In these cases, there may be attractive
electrostatic forces on the enzyme that entice the substrate to the active site.
These forces are sometimes referred to poetically as Circe effects.
The limit imposed by the rate of diffusion in solution can also be partly
overcome by confining substrates and products in the limited volume of a
multienzyme complex. Indeed, some series of enzymes are associated into
organized assemblies (Section 17.1.9) so that the product of one enzyme is
very rapidly found by the next enzyme. In effect, products are channeled
from one enzyme to the next, much as in an assembly line.

8.4.3 Most Biochemical Reactions Include Multiple Substrates
Most reactions in biological systems usually include two substrates and two
products and can be represented by the bisubstrate reaction:
A ⫹ B 3:4 P ⫹ Q
The majority of such reactions entail the transfer of a functional group, such
as a phosphoryl or an ammonium group, from one substrate to the other.
In oxidation–reduction reactions, electrons are transferred between substrates. Multiple substrate reactions can be divided into two classes: sequential displacement and double displacement.
Sequential Displacement. In the sequential mechanism, all substrates
must bind to the enzyme before any product is released. Consequently, in
a bisubstrate reaction, a ternary complex of the enzyme and both substrates
forms. Sequential mechanisms are of two types: ordered, in which the substrates bind the enzyme in a defined sequence, and random.
Many enzymes that have NAD⫹ or NADH as a substrate exhibit the
sequential ordered mechanism. Consider lactate dehydrogenase, an important enzyme in glucose metabolism (Section 16.1.9). This enzyme reduces
pyruvate to lactate while oxidizing NADH to NAD⫹.

The enzyme exists as a ternary complex: first, consisting of the enzyme and

In the random sequential mechanism, the order of addition of substrates
and release of products is random. Sequential random reactions are illustrated by the formation of phosphocreatine and ADP from ATP and creatine, a reaction catalyzed by creatine kinase (Section 30.x.x).

Although the order of certain events is random, the reaction still passes
through the ternary complexes including, first, substrates and, then,
products.
Double-Displacement (Ping-Pong) Reactions. In double-displacement,
or Ping-Pong, reactions, one or more products are released before all substrates bind the enzyme. The defining feature of double-displacement reactions is the existence of a substituted enzyme intermediate, in which the enzyme is temporarily modified. Reactions that shuttle amino groups between
amino acids and ␣-keto acids are classic examples of double-displacement
mechanisms. The enzyme aspartate aminotransferase (Section 23.x.x) catalyzes the transfer of an amino group from aspartate to ␣-ketoglutarate.

After aspartate binds to the enzyme, the enzyme removes aspartate’s amino
group to form the substituted enzyme intermediate. The first product, oxaloacetate, subsequently departs. The second substrate, ␣-ketoglutarate,
binds to the enzyme, accepts the amino group from the modified enzyme,
and is then released as the final product, glutamate. In the Cleland notation, the substrates appear to bounce on and off the enzyme analogously to
a Ping-Pong ball bouncing on a table.

8.4.4 Allosteric Enzymes Do Not Obey Michaelis-Menten Kinetics

Substrate concentration, [S]

FIGURE 8.14 Kinetics for an allosteric
enzyme. Allosteric enzymes display a
sigmoidal dependence of reaction velocity
on substrate concentration.

The Michaelis-Menten model has greatly assisted the development of enzyme chemistry. Its virtues are simplicity and broad applicability. However,
the Michaelis-Menten model cannot account for the kinetic properties of
many enzymes. An important group of enzymes that do not obey MichaelisMenten kinetics comprises the allosteric enzymes. These enzymes consist of
multiple subunits and multiple active sites.
Allosteric enzymes often display sigmoidal plots (Figure 8.14) of the reaction velocity V0 versus substrate concentration [S], rather than the hyperbolic plots predicted by the Michaelis-Menten equation (equation 23). In allosteric enzymes, the binding of substrate to one active site can affect the
properties of other active sites in the same enzyme molecule. A possible outcome of this interaction between subunits is that the binding of substrate becomes cooperative; that is, the binding of substrate to one active site of the
enzyme facilitates substrate binding to the other active sites. As will be considered in Chapter 10, such cooperativity results in a sigmoidal plot of V0
versus [S]. In addition, the activity of an allosteric enzyme may be altered by
regulatory molecules that are reversibly bound to specific sites other than the
catalytic sites. The catalytic properties of allosteric enzymes can thus be adjusted to meet the immediate needs of a cell (Chapter 10). For this reason,
allosteric enzymes are key regulators of metabolic pathways in the cell.

8.5 ENZYMES CAN BE INHIBITED
BY SPECIFIC MOLECULES

Enzyme Inhibition

The activity of many enzymes can be inhibited by the binding of specific
small molecules and ions. This means of inhibiting enzyme activity serves
as a major control mechanism in biological systems. The regulation of allosteric enzymes typifies this type of control. In addition, many drugs and
toxic agents act by inhibiting enzymes. Inhibition by particular chemicals
can be a source of insight into the mechanism of enzyme action: specific inhibitors can often be used to identify residues critical for catalysis. The value
of transition-state analogs as potent inhibitors will be discussed shortly.
Enzyme inhibition can be either reversible or irreversible. An irreversible
inhibitor dissociates very slowly from its target enzyme because it has become tightly bound to the enzyme, either covalently or noncovalently. Some
irreversible inhibitors are important drugs. Penicillin acts by covalently
modifying the enzyme transpeptidase, thereby preventing the synthesis of
bacterial cell walls and thus killing the bacteria (Section 8.5.5). Aspirin acts
by covalently modifying the enzyme cyclooxygenase, reducing the synthesis of inflammatory signals.
Reversible inhibition, in contrast with irreversible inhibition, is characterized by a rapid dissociation of the enzyme–inhibitor complex. In competitive inhibition, an enzyme can bind substrate (forming an ES complex)
or inhibitor (EI) but not both (ESI). The competitive inhibitor resembles
the substrate and binds to the active site of the enzyme (Figure 8.15). The
substrate is thereby prevented from binding to the same active site. A competitive inhibitor diminishes the rate of catalysis by reducing the proportion of
enzyme molecules bound to a substrate. At any given inhibitor concentration,
competitive inhibition can be relieved by increasing the substrate concentration. Under these conditions, the substrate “outcompetes” the inhibitor
for the active site. Methotrexate is a structural analog of tetrahydrofolate,
a coenzyme for the enzyme dihydrofolate reductase, which plays a role in
the biosynthesis of purines and pyrimidines (Figure 8.16). It binds to dihydrofolate reductase 1000-fold more tightly than the natural substrate and
inhibits nucleotide base synthesis. It is used to treat cancer.

8.5.1 Competitive and Noncompetitive Inhibition
Are Kinetically Distinguishable
How can we determine whether a reversible inhibitor acts by competitive
or noncompetitive inhibition? Let us consider only enzymes that exhibit
Michaelis-Menten kinetics. Measurements of the rates of catalysis at different concentrations of substrate and inhibitor serve to distinguish the two
types of inhibition. In competitive inhibition, the inhibitor competes with the
substrate for the active site. The dissociation constant for the inhibitor is
given by
Ki ⫽ 冤E冥冤I冥Ⲑ冤EI冥

[I] = 5 Ki

E+I

In noncompetitive inhibition, which also is reversible, the inhibitor and
substrate can bind simultaneously to an enzyme molecule at different binding sites (see Figure 8.16). A noncompetitive inhibitor acts by decreasing
the turnover number rather than by diminishing the proportion of enzyme
molecules that are bound to substrate. Noncompetitive inhibition, in contrast with competitive inhibition, cannot be overcome by increasing the substrate concentration. A more complex pattern, called mixed inhibition, is produced when a single inhibitor both hinders the binding of substrate and
decreases the turnover number of the enzyme.

Because increasing the amount of substrate can overcome the inhibition,
Vmax can be attained in the presence of a competitive inhibitor (Figure
8.17). The hallmark of competitive inhibition is that it can be overcome by a
sufficiently high concentration of substrate. However, the apparent value of
KM is altered; the effect of a competitive inhibitor is to increase the
apparent value of KM. This new value of KM, called Kapp
M , is numerically
equal to
Kapp
M ⫽ KM (1 ⫹ 冤I冥 Ⲑ Ki )
where [I] is the concentration of inhibitor and Ki is the dissociation constant
for the enzyme–inhibitor complex. As the value of [I] increases, the value of
app
increases (see Figure 8.17). In the presence of a competitive inhibitor,
KM
an enzyme will have the same Vmax as in the absence of an inhibitor.
In noncompetitive inhibition (Figure 8.18), substrate can still bind to the
enzyme–inhibitor complex. However, the enzyme–inhibitor–substrate
complex does not proceed to form product. The value of Vmax is decreased
app
while the value of KM is unchanged. Why is Vmax
to a new value called V max
lowered while KM remains unchanged? In essence, the inhibitor simply lowers the concentration of functional enzyme. The remaining enzyme behaves
like a more dilute solution of enzyme; Vmax is lower, but KM is the same.
Noncompetitive inhibition cannot be overcome by increasing the substrate
concentration.

[Substrate]

FIGURE 8.18 Kinetics of a noncompetitive inhibitor. The reaction
pathway shows that the inhibitor binds
both to free enzyme and to enzyme
complex. Consequently, Vmax cannot
be attained, even at high substrate
concentrations.

In Chapter 9, we will examine the chemical details of how enzymes function. The first step in obtaining the chemical mechanism of an enzyme is to
determine what functional groups are required for enzyme activity. How
can we ascertain these functional groups? X-ray crystallography (Section
4.5.2) of the enzyme bound to its substrate provides one approach. Irreversible inhibitors that covalently bond to the enzyme provide an alternative and often complementary means for elucidating functional groups at
the enzyme active site because they modify the functional groups, which
can then be identified. Irreversible inhibitors can be divided into three categories: group-specific reagents, substrate analogs, and suicide inhibitors.

1 of the 27 serine residues in the proteolytic enzyme chymotrypsin, implying that this serine residue is especially reactive. As we will see in Chapter
9, it is indeed the case that this serine residue is at the active site. DIPF also
revealed a reactive serine residue in acetylcholinesterase, an enzyme important in the transmission of nerve impulses (see Figure 8.19). Thus, DIPF
and similar compounds that bind and inactivate acetylcholinesterase are potent nerve gases.

Affinity labels are molecules that are structurally similar to the substrate
for the enzyme that covalently modify active site residues. They are thus
more specific for the enzyme active site than are group-specific reagents.
Tosyl-L-phenylalanine chloromethyl ketone (TPCK) is a substrate analog
for chymotrypsin (Figure 8.21). TPCK binds at the active site; and then reacts irreversibly with a histidine residue at that site, inhibiting the enzyme.
The compound 3-bromoacetol is an affinity label for the enzyme triose
phosphate isomerase (TIM). It mimics the normal substrate, dihydroxyacetone phosphate, by binding at the active site; then it covalently modifies
the enzyme such that the enzyme is irreversibly inhibited (Figure 8.22).
Suicide inhibitors, or mechanism-based inhibitors are modified substrates
that provide the most specific means to modify an enzyme active site. The
inhibitor binds to the enzyme as a substrate and is initially processed by the
normal catalytic mechanism. The mechanism of catalysis then generates a
chemically reactive intermediate that inactivates the enzyme through covalent modification. The fact that the enzyme participates in its own irreversible inhibition strongly suggests that the covalently modified group on
the enzyme is catalytically vital. One example of such an inhibitor is N,Ndimethylpropargylamine. A flavin prosthetic group of monoamine oxidase

cysteine residue.

Enzyme Inhibition

8.5.3 Transition-State Analogs Are Potent Inhibitors of Enzymes
We turn now to compounds that provide the most intimate views of the catalytic process itself. Linus Pauling proposed in 1948 that compounds resembling the transition state of a catalyzed reaction should be very effective
inhibitors of enzymes. These mimics are called transition-state analogs. The
inhibition of proline racemase is an instructive example. The racemization
of proline proceeds through a transition state in which the tetrahedral ␣carbon atom has become trigonal by loss of a proton (Figure 8.24). In the trigonal form, all three bonds are in the same plane; C␣ also carries a net negative charge. This symmetric carbanion can be reprotonated on one side to
give the L isomer or on the other side to give the D isomer. This picture is
supported by the finding that the inhibitor pyrrole 2-carboxylate binds to
the racemase 160 times as tightly as does proline. The ␣-carbon atom of this
inhibitor, like that of the transition state, is trigonal. An analog that also carries a negative charge on C␣ would be expected to bind even more tightly.
In general, synthesizing compounds that more closely resemble the transition state than the substrate itself can produce highly potent and specific
inhibitors of enzymes. The inhibitory power of transition-state analogs underscores the essence of catalysis: selective binding of the transition state.

state in which the ␣ carbon is trigonal rather than tetrahedral. (B) Pyrrole 2-carboxylate, a
transition state analog because of its trigonal geometry, is a potent inhibitor of proline

8.5.4 Catalytic Antibodies Demonstrate the Importance
of Selective Binding of the Transition State to Enzymatic Activity
Antibodies that recognize transition states should function as catalysts, if
our understanding of the importance of the transition state to catalysis is
correct. The preparation of an antibody that catalyzes the insertion of a metal
ion into a porphyrin nicely illustrates the validity of this approach. Ferrochelatase, the final enzyme in the biosynthetic pathway for the production of heme, catalyzes the insertion of Fe2⫹ into protoporphyrin IX. The
nearly planar porphyrin must be bent for iron to enter. The recently determined crystal structure of the ferrochelatase bound to a substrate analog
confirms that the enzyme does indeed bend one of the pyrole rings, distorting it 36 degrees to insert the iron.

FIGURE 8.25 Use of transition-state
analogs to generate catalytic
antibodies. The insertion of a metal ion
into a porphyrin by ferrochelatase proceeds
through a transition state in which the
porphyrin is bent. N-Methylmesoporphyrin,
a bent porphyrin that resembles the
transition state of the ferrochelatasecatalyzed reaction, was used to generate
an antibody that also catalyzes the insertion
of a metal ion into a porphyrin ring.

The problem was to find a transition-state analog for this metallation
reaction that could be used as an antigen (immunogen) to generate an
antibody. The solution came from the results of studies showing that an
alkylated porphyrin, N-methylprotoporphyrin, is a potent inhibitor of
ferrochelatase. This compound resembles the transition state because
N-alkylation forces the porphyrin to be bent. Moreover, it was known that Nalkylporphyrins chelate metal ions 104 times as fast as their unalkylated
counterparts do. Bending increases the exposure of the pyrrole nitrogen lone
pairs of electrons to solvent, which facilitates metal in binding.
An antibody catalyst was produced with the use of an N-alkylporphyrin
as the immunogen. The resulting antibody presumably distorts a planar
porphyrin (Figure 8.25) to facilitate the entry of a metal. On average, an antibody molecule metallated 80 porphyrin molecules per hour, a rate only
10-fold less than that of ferrochelatase and 2500-fold faster than the uncatalyzed reaction. Catalytic antibodies (abzymes) can indeed be produced by using transition-state analogs as antigens. Antibodies catalyzing many other
kinds of chemical reactions—exemplified by ester and amide hydrolysis,
amide-bond formation, transesterification, photoinduced cleavage, photoinduced dimerization, decarboxylation, and oxidization—have been produced with the use of similar strategies. The results of studies with transition-state analogs provide strong evidence that enzymes can function
complementary in structure to the transition state. The power of transitionstate analogs is now evident: (1) they are sources of insight into catalytic mechanisms, (2) they can serve as potent and specific inhibitors of enzymes, and
(3) they can be used as immunogens to generate a wide range of novel catalysts.
8.5.5 Penicillin Irreversibly Inactivates a Key Enzyme
in Bacterial Cell-Wall Synthesis
Penicillin, the first antibiotic discovered, consists of a thiazolidine ring
fused to a ␤-lactam ring, to which a variable R group is attached by a
peptide bond (Figure 8.26A). In benzyl penicillin, for example, R is a benzyl
group (Figure 8.26B). This structure can undergo a variety of rearrangements,
and, in particular, the ␤-lactam ring is very labile. Indeed, this instability is
closely tied to the antibiotic action of penicillin, as will be evident shortly.
How does penicillin inhibit bacterial growth? In 1957, Joshua Lederberg
showed that bacteria ordinarily susceptible to penicillin could be grown in
its presence if a hypertonic medium were used. The organisms obtained in
this way, called protoplasts, are devoid of a cell wall and consequently lyse
when transferred to a normal medium. Hence, penicillin was inferred to interfere with the synthesis of the bacterial cell wall. The cell-wall macromolecule, called a peptidoglycan, consists of linear polysaccharide chains that

are cross-linked by short peptides (Figure 8.27). The enormous bag-shaped
peptidoglycan confers mechanical support and prevents bacteria from
bursting in response to their high internal osmotic pressure.
In 1965, James Park and Jack Strominger independently deduced that
penicillin blocks the last step in cell-wall synthesis—namely, the crosslinking of different peptidoglycan strands. In the formation of the cell wall
of Staphylococcus aureus, the amino group at one end of a pentaglycine chain
attacks the peptide bond between two D-alanine residues in another peptide
unit (Figure 8.28). A peptide bond is formed between glycine and one of
the D-alanine residues; the other D-alanine residue is released. This crosslinking reaction is catalyzed by glycopeptide transpeptidase. Bacterial cell
walls are unique in containing D amino acids, which form cross-links by a
mechanism different from that used to synthesize proteins.
Penicillin inhibits the cross-linking transpeptidase by the Trojan horse
stratagem. The transpeptidase normally forms an acyl intermediate with the
penultimate D-alanine residue of the D-Ala-D-Ala peptide (Figure 8.29).
This covalent acyl-enzyme intermediate then reacts with the amino group
of the terminal glycine in another peptide to form the cross-link. Penicillin
is welcomed into the active site of the transpeptidase because it mimics the
D-Ala-D-Ala moiety of the normal substrate (Figure 8.30). Bound penicillin
then forms a covalent bond with a serine residue at the active site of the enzyme. This penicilloyl-enzyme does not react further. Hence, the transpeptidase is irreversibly inhibited and cell-wall synthesis cannot take place.

Why is penicillin such an effective inhibitor of the transpeptidase? The
highly strained, four-membered ␤-lactam ring of penicillin makes it
especially reactive. On binding to the transpeptidase, the serine residue at
the active site attacks the carbonyl carbon atom of the lactam ring to form
the penicilloyl-serine derivative (Figure 8.31). Because the peptidase participates in its own inactivation, penicillin acts as a suicide inhibitor.

8.6 VITAMINS ARE OFTEN PRECURSORS TO COENZYMES
Earlier (Section 8.1.1), we considered the fact that many enzymes require cofactors to be catalytically active. One class of these cofactors,
termed coenzymes, consists of small organic molecules, many of which are
derived from vitamins. Vitamins themselves are organic molecules that are
needed in small amounts in the diets of some higher animals. These moleTABLE 8.9

cules serve the same roles in nearly all forms of life, but higher animals lost
the capacity to synthesize them in the course of evolution. For instance,
whereas E. coli can thrive on glucose and organic salts, human beings require at least 12 vitamins in the diet. The biosynthetic pathways for vitamins can be complex; thus, it is biologically more efficient to ingest vitamins than to synthesize the enzymes required to construct them from simple
molecules. This efficiency comes at the cost of dependence on other organisms for chemicals essential for life. Indeed, vitamin deficiency can generate diseases in all organisms requiring these molecules (Tables 8.9 and 8.10).
Vitamins can be grouped according to whether they are soluble in water or
in nonpolar solvents.
8.6.1 Water-Soluble Vitamins Function As Coenzymes
Table 8.9 lists the water-soluble vitamins—ascorbic acid (vitamin C)
and a series known as the vitamin B complex (Figure 8.32). Ascorbate, the ionized form of ascorbic acid, serves as a reducing agent (an antioxidant), as will be discussed shortly. The vitamin B series comprises components of coenzymes. Note that, in all cases except vitamin C, the vitamin
must be modified before it can serve its function.
Vitamin deficiencies are capable of causing a variety of pathological conditions (see Table 8.9). However, many of the same symptoms can result
from conditions other than lack of a vitamin. For this reason and because
vitamins are required in relatively small amounts, pathological conditions
resulting from vitamin deficiencies are often difficult to diagnose.
The requirement for vitamin C proved relatively straightforward to
demonstrate. This water-soluble vitamin is not used as a coenzyme but is

still required for the continued activity of proyl hydroxylase. This enzyme
synthesizes 4-hydroxyproline, an amino acid that is required in collagen,
the major connective tissue in vertebrates, but is rarely found anywhere else.
How is this unusual amino acid formed and what is its role? The results of
radioactive-labeling studies showed that proline residues on the amino side
of glycine residues in nascent collagen chains become hydroxylated. The
oxygen atom that becomes attached to C-4 of proline comes from molecular oxygen, O2. The other oxygen atom of O2 is taken up by ␣-ketoglutarate,
which is converted into succinate (Figure 8.33). This complex reaction is
catalyzed by prolyl hydroxylase, a dioxygenase. It is assisted by an Fe2⫹ ion,
which is tightly bound to it and needed to activate O2. The enzyme also
converts ␣-ketoglutarate into succinate without hydroxylating proline. In
this partial reaction, an oxidized iron complex is formed, which inactivates
the enzyme. How is the active enzyme regenerated? Ascorbate (vitamin C)
comes to the rescue by reducing the ferric ion of the inactivated enzyme. In
the recovery process, ascorbate is oxidized to dehydroascorbic acid (Figure
8.34). Thus, ascorbate serves here as a specific antioxidant.
Primates are unable to synthesize ascorbic acid and hence must acquire
it from their diets. The importance of ascorbate becomes strikingly evident
in scurvy. Jacques Cartier in 1536 gave a vivid description of this dietary deficiency disease, which afflicted his men as they were exploring the Saint
Lawrence River:
Some did lose all their strength, and could not stand on their feet. …
Others also had all their skins spotted with spots of blood of a purple
colour: then did it ascend up to their ankles, knees, thighs, shoulders, arms,
and necks. Their mouths became stinking, their gums so rotten, that all
the flesh did fall off, even to the roots of the teeth, which did also almost
all fall out.

James Lind, a Scottish physician, illuminated the means of preventing
scurvy in an article titled “A Treatise of the Scurvy” published in 1747. Lind
described a controlled study establishing that scurvy could be prevented by
including citrus fruits in the diet. The Royal Navy eventually began issuing lime rations to sailors, from which custom British sailors acquired the
nickname “limeys.” Lind’s research was inspired by the plight of an expedition commanded by Commodore George Anson. Anson left England in
1740 with a fleet of six ships and more than 1000 men and returned with
an enormous amount of treasure, but of his crew only 145 survived to reach
home. The remainder had died of scurvy.
Why does impaired hydroxylation have such devastating consequences?
Collagen synthesized in the absence of ascorbate is less stable than the normal
protein. Studies of the thermal stability of synthetic polypeptides have been

7552dc08_189-226

especially informative. Hydroxyproline stabilizes the collagen triple helix
by forming interstrand hydrogen bonds. The abnormal fibers formed by insufficiently hydroxylated collagen contribute to the skin lesions and bloodvessel fragility seen in scurvy.

Summary

8.6.2 Fat-Soluble Vitamins Participate in Diverse Processes
Such as Blood Clotting and Vision
Not all vitamins function as coenzymes. The fat-soluble vitamins,
which are designated by the letters A, D, E, and K (Figure 8.35, Table
8.10), have a diverse array of functions. Vitamin K, which is required for
normal blood clotting (K from the German koagulation), participates in the
carboxylation of glutamate residues to ␥-carboxyglutamate, which makes
modified glutamic acid a much stronger chelator of Ca2⫹ (Section 10.7.7).
Vitamin A (retinol) is the precursor of retinal, the light-sensitive group in
rhodopsin and other visual pigments (Section 32.3.1). A deficiency of this
vitamin leads to night blindness. In addition, young animals require vitamin A for growth. Retinoic acid, which contains a terminal carboxylate in
place of the alcohol terminus of retinol, serves as a signal molecule and
activates the transcription of specific genes that mediate growth and development (Section 31.x.x). A metabolite of vitamin D is a hormone that regulates the metabolism of calcium and phosphorus. A deficiency in vitamin
D impairs bone formation in growing animals. Infertility in rats is a consequence of vitamin E (␣-tocopherol) deficiency. This vitamin reacts with
and neutralizes reactive oxygen species such as hydroxyl, radicals before
they can oxidize unsaturated membrane lipids, damaging cell structures.

Enzymes are Powerful and Highly Specific Catalysts

The catalysts in biological systems are enzymes, and nearly all enzymes
are proteins. Enzymes are highly specific and have great catalytic power.
They can enhance reaction rates by factors of 106 or more. Many enzymes require cofactors for activity. Such cofactors can be metal ions or
small, vitamin-derived organic molecules called coenzymes.

CHAPTER 8 • Basic Concepts and Kinetics

• Free Energy Is a Useful Thermodynamic Function
for Understanding Enzymes

Free energy (G) is the most valuable thermodynamic function for determining whether a reaction can take place and for understanding the
energetics of catalysis. A reaction can occur spontaneously only if the
change in free energy (⌬G) is negative. The free-energy change of a reaction that takes place when reactants and products are at unit activity
is called the standard free-energy change (⌬G°). Biochemists usually
use ⌬G°⬘, the standard free-energy change at pH 7. Enzymes do not alter reaction equilibria; rather, they increase reaction rates.

• Enzymes Accelerate Reactions by Facilitating the Formation of the
Transition State

Enzymes serve as catalysts by decreasing the free energy of activation
of chemical reactions. Enzymes accelerate reactions by providing a reaction pathway in which the transition state (the highest-energy species)
has a lower free energy and hence is more rapidly formed than in the
uncatalyzed reaction.
The first step in catalysis is the formation of an enzyme–substrate
complex. Substrates are bound to enzymes at active-site clefts from
which water is largely excluded when the substrate is bound. The specificity of enzyme–substrate interactions arises mainly from hydrogen
bonding, which is directional, and the shape of the active site, which rejects molecules that do not have a sufficiently complementary shape.
The recognition of substrates by enzymes is accompanied by conformational changes at active sites, and such changes facilitate the formation of the transition state.

• The Michaelis-Menten Model Accounts for the Kinetic Properties
of Many Enzymes

The Michaelis-Menten model accounts for the kinetic properties of
some enzymes. In this model, an enzyme (E) combines with a substrate
(S) to form an enzyme–substrate (ES) complex, which can proceed to
form a product (P) or to dissociate into E and S.

The rate V0 of formation of product is given by the Michaelis-Menten
equation:

冤S冥
冤S冥 ⫹ KM

in which Vmax is the reaction rate when the enzyme is fully saturated
with substrate and KM, the Michaelis constant, is the substrate concentration at which the reaction rate is half maximal. The maximal rate,
Vmax, is equal to the product of k2 or kcat and the total concentration of
enzyme. The kinetic constant kcat, called the turnover number, is
the number of substrate molecules converted into product per unit time
at a single catalytic site when the enzyme is fully saturated with substrate. Turnover numbers for most enzymes are between 1 and 104 per
second. The ratio of kcat/KM provides a penetrating probe into enzyme
efficiency.
Allosteric enzymes constitute an important class of enzymes whose
catalytic activity can be regulated. These enzymes, which do not conform to Michaelis-Menton kinetics, have multiple active sites. These
active sites display cooperativity, as evidenced by a sigmoidal dependence of reaction velocity on substrate concentration.

Enzymes Can Be Inhibited by Specific Molecules

221

Specific small molecules or ions can inhibit even nonallosteric enzymes. In irreversible inhibition, the inhibitor is covalently linked to
the enzyme or bound so tightly that its dissociation from the enzyme
is very slow. Covalent inhibitors provide a means of mapping the enzyme’s active site. In contrast, reversible inhibition is characterized by
a rapid equilibrium between enzyme and inhibitor. A competitive inhibitor prevents the substrate from binding to the active site. It reduces the reaction velocity by diminishing the proportion of enzyme
molecules that are bound to substrate. In noncompetitive inhibition,
the inhibitor decreases the turnover number. Competitive inhibition
can be distinguished from noncompetitive inhibition by determining
whether the inhibition can be overcome by raising the substrate
concentration.
The essence of catalysis is selective stabilization of the transition
state. Hence, an enzyme binds the transition state more tightly than the
substrate. Transition-state analogs are stable compounds that mimic
key features of this highest-energy species. They are potent and specific
inhibitors of enzymes. Proof that transition-state stabilization is a key
aspect of enzyme activity comes from the generation of catalytic antibodies. Transition-state analogs are used as antigens, or immunogens,
in generating catalytic antibodies.

Appendix

Vitamins Are Often Precursors to Coenzymes

Vitamins are small biomolecules that are needed in small amounts in
the diets of higher animals. The water-soluble vitamins are vitamin C
(ascorbate, an antioxidant) and the vitamin B complex (components of
coenzymes). Ascorbate is required for the hydroxylation of proline
residues in collagen, a key protein of connective tissue. The fat-soluble
vitamins are vitamin A (a precursor of retinal), D (a regulator of calcium and phosphorus metabolism), E (an antioxidant in membranes),
and K (a participant in the carboxylation of glutamate).

A P P E N D I X : Vmax AND KM CAN BE DETERMINED
BY DOUBLE-RECIPROCAL PLOTS
Before the availability of computers, the determination of KM
and Vmax values required algebraic manipulation of the basic
Michaelis-Menten equation. Because Vmax is approached
asymptotically (see Figure 8.11), it is impossible to obtain a definitive value from a typical Michaelis-Menten plot. Because KM
is the concentration of substrate at Vmax/2, it is likewise
impossible to determine an accurate value of KM. However, Vmax
can be accurately determined if the Michaelis-Menten equation
is transformed into one that gives a straight-line plot. Taking the
reciprocal of both sides of equation 23 gives

A plot of 1/V0 versus 1/[S], called a Lineweaver-Burk or doublereciprocal plot, yields a straight line with an intercept of 1/Vmax
and a slope of KM/Vmax (Figure 8.36). The intercept on the yaxis is ⫺1/KM.

in the presence (

inhibitor shows that KM is unaltered and Vmax is decreased.

Double-reciprocal plots are especially useful for distinguishing between competitive and noncompetitive inhibitors. In competitive inhibition, the intercept on the y-axis of the plot of 1/V0
versus 1/[S] is the same in the presence and in the absence of inhibitor, although the slope is increased (Figure 8.37). That the
intercept is unchanged is because a competitive inhibitor does not
alter Vmax. At a sufficiently high concentration, virtually all the
active sites are filled by substrate, and the enzyme is fully operative. The increase in the slope of the 1/V0 versus 1/[S] plot indicates the strength of binding of competitive inhibitor. In the presence of a competitive inhibitor, equation 31 is replaced by

In other words, the slope of the plot is increased by the factor
(1 ⫹ [I]/Ki) in the presence of a competitive inhibitor. Consider
an enzyme with a KM of 10⫺4 M. In the absence of inhibitor, V0

of the competitive inhibitor thus cuts the reaction rate in half at
this substrate concentration.
In noncompetitive inhibition (Figure 8.38), the inhibitor
can combine with either the enzyme or the enzyme–substrate
complex. In pure noncompetitive inhibition, the values of the
dissociation constants of the inhibitor and enzyme and of the inhibitor and enzyme–substrate complex are equal (Section 8.5.1).

PROBLEMS
1. Hydrolytic driving force. The hydrolysis of pyrophosphate to
orthophosphate is important in driving forward biosynthetic reactions such as the synthesis of DNA. This hydrolytic reaction
is catalyzed in Escherichia coli by a pyrophosphatase that has a
mass of 120 kd and consists of six identical subunits. For this
enzyme, a unit of activity is defined as the amount of enzyme
that hydrolyzes 10 ␮mol of pyrophosphate in 15 minutes at 37°C
under standard assay conditions. The purified enzyme has a
Vmax of 2800 units per milligram of enzyme.
(a) How many moles of substrate are hydrolyzed per second per
milligram of enzyme when the substrate concentration is much
greater than KM?
(b) How many moles of active site are there in 1 mg of enzyme?
Assume that each subunit has one active site.
(c) What is the turnover number of the enzyme? Compare this
value with others mentioned in this chapter.
2. Destroying the Trojan horse. Penicillin is hydrolyzed and
thereby rendered inactive by penicillinase (also known as ␤-lac

tamase), an enzyme present in some resistant bacteria. The mass
of this enzyme in Staphylococcus aureus is 29.6 kd. The amount
of penicillin hydrolyzed in 1 minute in a 10-ml solution containing 10⫺9 g of purified penicillinase was measured as a function
of the concentration of penicillin. Assume that the concentration
of penicillin does not change appreciably during the assay.

Catalytic Strategies

Strategy and tactics. Chess and enzymes have in common the
use of strategy, consciously thought out in the game of chess and
selected by evolution for the action of an enzyme. The three amino
acid residues at the right, denoted by the white bonds, constitute a
catalytic triad found in the active site of a class of enzymes that
cleave peptide bonds. The substrate, represented by the molecule
with black bonds, is as hopelessly trapped as the king in the photograph of a chess match at the left and is sure to be cleaved.

What are the sources of the catalytic power and specificity of enzymes? This
chapter presents the catalytic strategies used by four classes of enzymes: the
serine proteases, carbonic anhydrases, restriction endonucleases, and nucleoside monophosphate (NMP) kinases. The first three classes of enzymes catalyze reactions that require the addition of water to a substrate. For the serine proteases, exemplified by chymotrypsin, the challenge is to promote a
reaction that is almost immeasurably slow at neutral pH in the absence of a
catalyst. For carbonic anhydrases, the challenge is to achieve a high absolute
rate of reaction, suitable for integration with other rapid physiological
processes. For restriction endonucleases such as EcoRV, the
challenge is to attain a very high level of specificity. Finally,
for NMP kinases, the challenge is to transfer a phosphoryl

systems. In addition, our knowledge of catalytic strategies has been used to
develop practical applications, including drugs that are potent and specific
enzyme inhibitors. Finally, although we shall not consider catalytic RNA molecules (Section 28.x.x) explicitly in this chapter, the principles apply to these
catalysts in addition to protein catalysts.
9.0.1 A Few Basic Catalytic Principles Are Used
by Many Enzymes
In Chapter 8, we learned that enzymatic catalysis begins with substrate
binding. The binding energy is the free energy released in the formation of
a large number of weak interactions between the enzyme and the substrate.
We can envision this binding energy as serving two purposes: it establishes
substrate specificity and increases catalytic efficiency. Only the correct substrate can participate in most or all of the interactions with the enzyme and
thus maximize binding energy, accounting for the exquisite substrate specificity exhibited by many enzymes. Furthermore, the full complement of
such interactions is formed only when the substrate is in the transition state.
Thus, interactions between the enzyme and the substrate not only favor substrate binding but stabilize the transition state, thereby lowering the activation energy. The binding energy can also promote structural changes in
both the enzyme and the substrate that facilitate catalysis, a process referred
to as induced fit.
Enzymes commonly employ one or more of the following strategies to
catalyze specific reactions:
1. Covalent catalysis. In covalent catalysis, the active site contains a reactive group, usually a powerful nucleophile that becomes temporarily covalently modified in the course of catalysis. The proteolytic enzyme chymotrypsin provides an excellent example of this mechanism (Section 9.1.2).
2. General acid–base catalysis. In general acid–base catalysis, a molecule
other than water plays the role of a proton donor or acceptor. Chymotrypsin
uses a histidine residue as a base catalyst to enhance the nucleophilic power
of serine (Section 9.1.3).
3. Metal ion catalysis. Metal ions can function catalytically in several ways.
For instance, a metal ion may serve as an electrophilic catalyst, stabilizing
a negative charge on a reaction intermediate. Alternatively, the metal ion
may generate a nucleophile by increasing the acidity of a nearby molecule,
such as water in the hydration of CO2 by carbonic anhydrase (Section 9.2.2).
Finally, the metal ion may bind to substrate, increasing the number of interactions with the enzyme and thus the binding energy. This strategy is
used by NMP kinases (Section 9.4.2).
4. Catalysis by approximation. Many reactions include two distinct substrates. In such cases, the reaction rate may be considerably enhanced by
bringing the two substrates together along a single binding surface on an
enzyme. NMP kinases bring two nucleotides together to facilitate the transfer of a phosphoryl group from one nucleotide to the other (Section 9.4.3).

9.1 PROTEASES: FACILITATING A DIFFICULT REACTION
Protein turnover is an important process in living systems (Chapter 23).
Proteins that have served their purpose must be degraded so that their constituent amino acids can be recycled for the synthesis of new proteins. Proteins ingested in the diet must be broken down into small peptides and

amino acids for absorption in the gut. Furthermore, as described in detail
in Chapter 10, proteolytic reactions are important in regulating the activity
of certain enzymes and other proteins.

Although the hydrolysis of peptide bonds is thermodynamically favored,
such hydrolysis reactions are extremely slow. In the absence of a catalyst,
the half-life for the hydrolysis of a typical peptide at neutral pH is estimated
to be between 10 and 1000 years. Yet, peptide bonds must be hydrolyzed
within milliseconds in some biochemical processes.
The chemical bonding in peptide bonds is responsible for their kinetic
stability. Specifically, the resonance structure that accounts for the planarity
of a peptide bond (Section 3.2.2) also makes such bonds resistant to hydrolysis. This resonance structure endows the peptide bond with partial
double-bond character:

The carbon–nitrogen bond is strengthened by its double-bond character, and
the carbonyl carbon atom is less electrophilic and less susceptible to nucleophilic attack than are the carbonyl carbon atoms in compounds such as carboxylate esters. Consequently, to promote peptide-bond cleavage, an enzyme
must facilitate nucleophilic attack at a normally unreactive carbonyl group.
9.1.1 Chymotrypsin Possesses a Highly Reactive Serine Residue
A number of proteolytic enzymes participate in the breakdown of proteins
in the digestive systems of mammals and other organisms. One such enzyme, chymotrypsin, cleaves peptide bonds selectively on the carboxylterminal side of the large hydrophobic amino acids such as tryptophan, tyrosine, phenylalanine, and methionine (Figure 9.1). Chymotrypsin is a good
example of the use of covalent modification as a catalytic strategy. The enzyme employs a powerful nucleophile to attack the unreactive carbonyl
group of the substrate. This nucleophile becomes covalently attached to the
substrate briefly in the course of catalysis.

What is the nucleophile that chymotrypsin employs to attack the substrate carbonyl group? A clue came from the fact that chymotrypsin contains an extraordinarily reactive serine residue. Treatment with organofluorophosphates such as diisopropylphosphofluoridate (DIPF); (Section 8.4.1)
was found to inactivate the enzyme irreversibly (Figure 9.2). Despite the
fact that the enzyme possesses 28 serine residues, only one, serine 195, was
modified, resulting in a total loss of enzyme activity. This chemical modification reaction suggested that this unusually reactive serine residue plays a
central role in the catalytic mechanism of chymotrypsin.

How can we elucidate the role of serine 195 in chymotrypsin action? A study
of the enzyme’s kinetics provided a second clue to chymotrypsin’s catalytic
mechanism and the role of serine 195. The kinetics of enzyme action are often easily monitored by having the enzyme act on a substrate analog that
forms a colored product. For chymotrypsin, such a chromogenic substrate is
N-acetyl-L-phenylalanine p-nitrophenyl ester. This substrate is an ester
rather than an amide, but many proteases will also hydrolyze esters. One of
the products formed by chymotrypsin’s cleavage of this substrate is pnitrophenolate, which has a yellow color (Figure 9.3). Measurements of the
absorbance of light revealed the amount of p-nitrophenolate being produced.
Under steady-state conditions, the cleavage of this substrate obeys
Michaelis-Menten kinetics with a KM of 20 M and a kcat of 77 s1. The
initial phase of the reaction was examined by using the stopped-flow
method. This technique permits the rapid mixing of enzyme and substrate
and allows almost instantaneous monitoring of the reaction. At the beginning of the reaction, this method revealed a “burst” phase during which the

colored product was produced rapidly (Figure 9.4). Product was then produced more slowly as the reaction reached the steady state. These results
suggest that hydrolysis proceeds in two steps. The burst is observed because, for this substrate, the first step is more rapid than the second step.
The two steps are explained by the reaction of the serine nucleophile
with the substrate to form the covalently bound enzyme–substrate intermediate (Figure 9.5). First, the highly reactive serine 195 hydroxyl group
attacks the carbonyl group of the substrate to form the acyl-enzyme intermediate, releasing the alcohol p-nitrophenol (or an amine if the substrate is
an amide rather than an ester). Second, the acyl-enzyme intermediate is hydrolyzed to release the carboxylic acid component of the substrate and regenerate the free enzyme. Thus, p-nitrophenolate is produced rapidly on
the addition of the substrate as the acyl-enzyme intermediate is formed, but
it takes longer for the enzyme to be “reset” by the hydrolysis of the acylenzyme intermediate.

9.1.3 Serine is Part of a Catalytic Triad That Also Includes
Histidine and Aspartic Acid
The determination of the three-dimensional structure of chymotrypsin by
David Blow in 1967 was a source of further insight into its mechanism of action. Overall, chymotrypsin is roughly spherical and comprises three polypeptide chains, linked by disulfide bonds. It is synthesized as a single polypeptide, termed chymotrypsinogen, which is activated by the
proteolytic cleavage of the polypeptide to yield the three
chains. The active site of chymotrypsin, marked by serine
195, lies in a cleft on the surface of the enzyme (Figure 9.6).
Serine 195
The structural analysis revealed the chemical basis of the
special reactivity of serine 195 (Figure 9.7). The side chain
of serine 195 is hydrogen bonded to the imidazole ring of
histidine 57. The –NH group of this imidazole ring is, in
turn, hydrogen bonded to the carboxylate group of aspartate 102. This constellation of residues is referred to as the
catalytic triad. How does this arrangement of residues lead
to the high reactivity of serine 195? The histidine residue
serves to position the serine side chain and to polarize its
hydroxyl group. In doing so, the residue acts as a general
FIGURE 9.6 Three-dimensional structure of
chymotrypsin. The three chains are shown in ribbon form in
orange, blue, and green. The side chains of the catalytic triad residues,
including serine 195, are shown as ball-and-stick representations, as
are two intrastrand and interstrand disulfide bonds.

base catalyst, a hydrogen ion acceptor, because the polarized hydroxyl group
of the serine residue is poised for deprotonation. The withdrawal of the proton from the hydroxyl group generates an alkoxide ion, which is a much more
powerful nucleophile than an alcohol is. The aspartate residue helps orient the
histidine residue and make it a better proton acceptor through electrostatic
effects.
These observations suggest a mechanism for peptide hydrolysis (Figure
9.8). After substrate binding (step 1), the reaction begins with the hydroxyl
group of serine 195 making a nucleophilic attack on the carbonyl carbon
atom of the substrate (step 2). The nucleophilic attack changes the geometry around this carbon atom from trigonal planar to tetrahedral. The inherently unstable tetrahedral intermediate formed bears a formal negative
charge on the oxygen atom derived from the carbonyl group. This charge
is stabilized by interactions with NH groups from the protein in a site

hydrolysis illustrates the principles of covalent and acid–base catalysis. The dashed

residue a more powerful base.

termed the oxyanion hole (Figure 9.9). These interactions also help stabilize
the transition state that precedes the formation of the tetrahedral intermediate. This tetrahedral intermediate then collapses to generate the acyl-enzyme (step 3). This step is facilitated by the transfer of a proton from the
positively charged histidine residue to the amino group formed by cleavage
of the peptide bond. The amine component is now free to depart from the
enzyme (step 4) and is replaced by a water molecule (step 5). The ester group
of the acyl-enzyme is now hydrolyzed by a process that is essentially a repeat of steps 2 through 4. The water molecule attacks the carbonyl group
while a proton is concomitantly removed by the histidine residue, which
now acts as a general acid catalyst, forming a tetrahedral intermediate (step
6). This structure breaks down to form the carboxylic acid product (step 7).
Finally, the release of the carboxylic acid product (step 8) readies the enzyme for another round of catalysis.
This mechanism accounts for all characteristics of chymotrypsin action
except the observed preference for cleaving the peptide bonds just past
residues with large, hydrophobic side chains. Examination of the threedimensional structure of chymotrypsin with substrate analogs and enzyme
inhibitors revealed the presence of a deep, relatively hydrophobic pocket,
called the S1 pocket, into which the long, uncharged side chains of residues
such as phenylalanine and tryptophan can fit. The binding of an appropriate side chain into this pocket positions the adjacent peptide bond into the active site for cleavage (Figure 9.10). The specificity of chymotrypsin depends
almost entirely on which amino acid is directly on the amino-terminal side
of the peptide bond to be cleaved. Other proteases have more-complex
specificity patterns, as illustrated in Figure 9.11. Such enzymes have additional pockets on their surfaces for the recognition of other residues in the
substrate. Residues on the amino-terminal side of the scissile bond (the bond

9.1.4 Catalytic Triads Are Found in Other Hydrolytic Enzymes

FIGURE 9.12 Structural
similarity of trypsin and chymotrypsin.
An overlay of the structure of chymotrypsin
(red) on that of trypsin (blue) shows the
high degree of similarity. Only -carbon
atom positions are shown. The mean
deviation in position between corresponding -carbon atoms is 1.7 Å.

Many other proteins have subsequently been found to contain catalytic triads similar to that discovered in chymotrypsin. Some, such
as trypsin and elastase, are obvious homologs of chymotrypsin. The sequences of these proteins are approximately 40% identical with that of chymotrypsin, and their overall structures are nearly the same (Figure 9.12).
These proteins operate by mechanisms identical with that of chymotrypsin.
However, they have very different substrate specificities. Trypsin cleaves at
the peptide bond after residues with long, positively charged side chains—
namely, arginine and lysine—whereas elastase cleaves at the peptide bond
after amino acids with small side chains—such as alanine and serine. Comparison of the S1 pockets of these enzymes reveals the basis of the specificity. In trypsin, an aspartate residue (Asp 189) is present at the bottom of
the S1 pocket in place of a serine residue in chymotrypsin. The aspartate
residue attracts and stabilizes a positively charged arginine or lysine residue
in the substrate. In elastase, two residues at the top of the pocket in chymotrypsin and trypsin are replaced with valine (Val 190 and Val 216). These
residues close off the mouth of the pocket so that only small side chains may
enter (Figure 9.13).
Other members of the chymotrypsin family include a collection of proteins that take part in blood clotting, to be discussed in Chapter 10. In addition, a wide range of proteases found in bacteria and viruses also belong
to this clan. Furthermore, other enzymes that are not homologs of chymotrypsin have been found to contain very similar active sites. As noted in
Chapter 7, the presence of very similar active sites in these different protein families is a consequence of convergent evolution. Subtilisin, a protease
in bacteria such as Bacillus amyloliquefaciens, is a particularly well characterized example. The active site of this enzyme includes both the catalytic
triad and the oxyanion hole. However, one of the NH groups that forms the
oxyanion hole comes from the side chain of an asparagine residue rather
than from the peptide backbone (Figure 9.14). Subtilisin is the founding
member of another large family of proteases that includes representatives
from Archaea, Eubacteria, and Eukarya.
Yet another example of the catalytic triad has been found in carboxypeptidase II from wheat. The structure of this enzyme is not significantly
similar to either chymotrypsin or subtilisin (Figure 9.15). This protein is a
member of an intriguing family of homologous proteins that includes esterases such as acetylcholine esterase and certain lipases. These enzymes all
make use of histidine-activated nucleophiles, but the nucleophiles may be
cysteine rather than serine. Finally, other proteases have been discovered that
contain an active-site serine or threonine residue that is activated not by a
histidine–aspartate pair but by a primary amino group from the side chain
of lysine or by the N-terminal amino group of the polypeptide chain.
Thus, the catalytic triad in proteases has emerged at least three times in
the course of evolution. We can conclude that this catalytic strategy must
be an especially effective approach to the hydrolysis of peptides and related
bonds.

The techniques of molecular biology discussed in Chapter
6 have permitted detailed examination of the catalytic triad.
In particular, site-directed mutagenesis has been used to
test the contribution of individual amino acid residues to
the catalytic power of an enzyme. Subtilisin has been exS221A

a model substrate has been examined (Figure 9.16). As expected, the conversion of active-site serine 221 into alanine
dramatically reduced catalytic power; the value of kcat fell
to less than one-millionth of its value for the wild-type enzyme. The value of KM was essentially unchanged: its increase by no more
than a factor of two indicated that substrate binding is not significantly affected. The mutation of histidine 64 to alanine had very similar effects. These
observations support the notion that the serine–histidine pair act together to
generate a nucleophile of sufficient power to attack the carbonyl group of a
peptide bond. The conversion of aspartate 32 into alanine had a smaller effect,
although the value of kcat still fell to less than 0.005% of its wild-type value.
The simultaneously conversion of all three catalytic triad residues into alanine
was no more deleterious than the conversion of serine or histidine alone. Despite the reduction in their catalytic power, the mutated enzymes still hydrolyze peptides a thousand times as rapidly as does buffer at pH 8.6.
Because the oxyanion hole of subtilisin includes a side-chain NH group
in addition to backbone NH groups, it is possible to probe the importance
of the oxyanion hole for catalysis by site-directed mutagenesis. The mutation of asparagine 155 to glycine reduced the value of kcat to 0.2% of its wildtype value but increased the value of KM by only a factor of two. These observations demonstrate that the NH group of the asparagine residue plays
a significant role in stabilizing the tetrahedral intermediate and the transition state leading to it.
9.1.6 Cysteine, Aspartyl, and Metalloproteases Are Other Major
Classes of Peptide-Cleaving Enzymes
Not all proteases utilize strategies based on activated serine residues.
Classes of proteins have been discovered that employ three alternative approaches to peptide-bond hydrolysis (Figure 9.17). These classes
are the (1) cysteine proteases, (2) aspartyl proteases, and (3) metalloproteases. In each case, the strategy generates a nucleophile that attacks the
peptide carbonyl group (Figure 9.18).
The strategy used by the cysteine proteases is most similar to that used by
the chymotrypsin family. In these enzymes, a cysteine residue, activated by
a histidine residue, plays the role of the nucleophile that attacks the peptide
bond (see Figure 9.18), in a manner quite analogous to that of the serine
residue in serine proteases. An ideal example of these proteins is papain, an
enzyme purified from the fruit of the papaya. Mammalian proteases homologous to papain have been discovered, most notably the cathepsins, proteins
having a role in the immune and other systems. The cysteine-based active
site arose independently at least twice in the course of evolution; the caspases,
enzymes that play a major role in apoptosis (Section 2.4.3), have active sites
similar to that of papain, but their overall structures are unrelated.

CHAPTER 9 • Catalytic Strategies

The second class comprises the aspartyl proteases. The central feature of
the active sites is a pair of aspartic acid residues that act together to allow a
water molecule to attack the peptide bond. One aspartic acid residue (in its
deprotonated form) activates the attacking water molecule by poising it for
deprotonation, whereas the other aspartic acid residue (in its protonated
form) polarizes the peptide carbonyl, increasing its susceptibility to attack
(see Figure 9.18). Members of this class include renin, an enzyme having a
role in the regulation of blood pressure, and the digestive enzyme pepsin.
These proteins possess approximate twofold symmetry, suggesting that the
two halves are evolutionarily related. A likely scenario is that two copies of
a gene for the ancestral enzyme fused to form a single gene that encoded a
single-chain enzyme. Each copy of the gene would have contributed an aspartate residue to the active site. The human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)
and other retroviruses contain an unfused dimeric aspartyl protease that is
similar to the fused protein, but the individual chains are not joined to make
a single chain (Figure 9-19). This observation is consistent with the idea
that the enzyme may have originally existed as separate subunits.
The metalloproteases constitute the final major class of peptide-cleaving
enzymes. The active site of such a protein contains a bound metal ion, almost always zinc, that activates a water molecule to act as a nucleophile to
attack the peptide carbonyl group. The bacterial enzyme thermolysin and
the digestive enzyme carboxypeptidase A are classic examples of the zinc
proteases. Thermolysin, but not carboxypeptidase A, is a member of a large
and diverse family of homologous zinc proteases that includes the matrix
metalloproteases, enzymes that catalyze the reactions in tissue remodeling
and degradation.
In each of these three classes of enzymes, the active site includes features
that allow for the activation of water or another nucleophile as well as for the
polarization of the peptide carbonyl group and subsequent stabilization of a
tetrahedral intermediate (see Figure 9.18).

Compounds that block or modulate the activities of proteases can
have dramatic biological effects. Most natural protease inhibitors are
similar in structure to the peptide substrates of the enzyme that each inhibits
(Section 10.7.4). Several important drugs are protease inhibitors. For example,
captopril, an inhibitor of the metalloprotease angiotensin-converting enzyme
(ACE), has been used to regulate blood pressure. Crixivan, an inhibitor of
the HIV protease, is used in the treatment of AIDS. This protease cleaves
multidomain viral proteins into their active forms; blocking this process completely prevents the virus from being infectious (see
Figure 9.19). To prevent unwanted side effects, protease
inhibitors used as drugs must be specific for one enzyme
without inhibiting other proteins within the body.
Let us examine the interaction of Crixivan with HIV
protease in more detail. Crixivan is constructed around
an alcohol that mimics the tetrahedral intermediate;
other groups are present to bind into the S2, S1, S1, and
S2 recognition sites on the enzyme (Figure 9.20). The
results of x-ray crystallographic studies revealed the
structure of the enzyme–Crixivan complex, showing that
Crixivan adopts a conformation that approximates the
twofold symmetry of the enzyme (Figure 9.21). The active site of HIV protease is covered by two apparently
flexible flaps that fold down on top of the bound in-

hibitor. The hydroxyl group of the central alcohol interacts with two aspartate residues of the active site, one in each subunit. In addition, two carbonyl groups of the inhibitor are hydrogen bonded to a water molecule (not
shown), which, in turn, is hydrogen bonded to a peptide NH group in each
of the flaps. This interaction of the inhibitor with water and the enzyme is
not possible with cellular aspartyl proteases such as renin and thus may contribute to the specificity of Crixivan and other inhibitors for HIV protease.

Even in the absence of a catalyst, this hydration reaction proceeds at a moderate pace. At 37°C near neutral pH, the second-order rate constant k1 is
0.0027 M1 s1. This corresponds to an effective first-order rate constant
of 0.15 s1 in water ([H2O]  55.5 M). Similarly, the reverse reaction, the
dehydration of bicarbonate, is relatively rapid, with a rate constant of
k1  50 s1. These rate constants correspond to an equilibrium constant
of K1  5.4  105 and a ratio of [CO2] to [H2CO3] of 340:1.
Despite the fact that CO2 hydration and HCO3dehydration occur
spontaneously at reasonable rates in the absence of catalysts, almost
all organisms contain enzymes, referred to as carbonic anhydrases, that catalyze these processes. Such enzymes are required because CO2 hydration and
HCO3 dehydration are often coupled to rapid processes, particularly transport processes. For example, HCO3 in the blood must be dehydrated to
form CO2 for exhalation as the blood passes through the lungs. Conversely,
CO2 must be converted into HCO3 for the generation of the aqueous humor of the eye and other secretions. Furthermore, both CO2 and HCO3
are substrates and products for a variety of enzymes, and the rapid interconversion of these species may be necessary to ensure appropriate substrate
levels. So important are these enzymes in human beings that mutations in
some carbonic anhydrases have been found to cause osteopetrosis (excessive
formation of dense bones accompanied by anemia) and mental retardation.
Carbonic anhydrases accelerate CO2 hydration dramatically. The most
active enzymes, typified by human carbonic anhydrase II, hydrate CO2 at
rates as high as kcat  106 s1, or a million times a second. Fundamental
physical processes such as diffusion and proton transfer ordinarily limit the
rate of hydration, and so special strategies are required to attain such prodigious rates.
9.2.1 Carbonic Anhydrase Contains a Bound Zinc Ion Essential
for Catalytic Activity
Less than 10 years after the discovery of carbonic anhydrase in 1932, this
enzyme was found to contain bound zinc, associated with catalytic activity.
This discovery, remarkable at the time, made carbonic anhydrase the first
known zinc-containing enzyme. At present, hundreds of enzymes are
known to contain zinc. In fact, more than one-third of all enzymes either
contain bound metal ions or require the addition of such ions for activity.
The chemical reactivity of metal ions—associated with their positive
charges, with their ability to form relatively strong yet kinetically labile
bonds, and, in some cases, with their capacity to be stable in more than one
oxidation state—explains why catalytic strategies that employ metal ions
have been adopted throughout evolution.
The results of x-ray crystallographic studies have supplied the most detailed and direct information about the zinc site in carbonic anhydrase. At
least seven carbonic anhydrases, each with its own gene, are present in human beings. They are all clearly homologous, as revealed by substantial
levels of sequence identity. Carbonic anhydrase II, present in relatively

high concentrations in red blood cells, has been the most extensively studied (Figure 9.22).
Zinc is found only in the  2 state in biological systems; so we need consider only this oxidation level as we examine the mechanism of carbonic anhydrase. A zinc atom is essentially always bound to four or more ligands;
in carbonic anhydrase, three coordination sites are occupied by the imidazole rings of three histidine residues and an additional coordination site is
occupied by a water molecule (or hydroxide ion, depending on pH). Because
all of the molecules occupying the coordination sites are neutral, the overall charge on the Zn(His)3 unit remains 2.

How does this zinc complex facilitate carbon dioxide hydration? A major
clue comes from the pH profile of enzymatically catalyzed carbon dioxide
hydration (Figure 9.23). At pH 8, the reaction proceeds near its maximal
rate. As the pH decreases, the rate of the reaction drops. The midpoint of
this transition is near pH 7, suggesting that a group with pKa  7 plays an
important role in the activity of carbonic anhydrase and that the deprotonated (high pH) form of this group participates more effectively in catalysis. Although some amino acids, notably histidine, have pKa values near 7,
a variety of evidence suggests that the group responsible for this transition is
not an amino acid but is the zinc-bound water molecule. Thus, the binding of
a water molecule to the positively charged zinc center reduces the pKa of
the water molecule from 15.7 to 7 (Figure 9.24). With the lowered pKa, a

substantial concentration of hydroxide ion (bound to zinc) is generated at
neutral pH. A zinc-bound hydroxide ion is sufficiently nucleophilic to attack carbon dioxide much more readily than water does. The importance of
the zinc-bound hydroxide ion suggests a simple mechanism for carbon dioxide hydration (Figure 9.25).
1. Zinc facilitates the release of a proton from a water molecule, which generates a hydroxide ion.
2. The carbon dioxide substrate binds to the enzyme’s active site and is positioned to react with the hydroxide ion.
3. The hydroxide ion attacks the carbon dioxide, converting it into bicarbonate ion.
4. The catalytic site is regenerated with the release of the bicarbonate ion
and the binding of another molecule of water.
Thus, the binding of water to zinc favors the formation of the transition
state, leading to bicarbonate formation by facilitating proton release and by
bringing the two reactants into close proximity. A range of studies supports
this mechanism. In particular, studies of a synthetic analog model system provide evidence for its plausibility. A simple synthetic ligand binds zinc
through four nitrogen atoms (compared with three histidine nitrogen atoms
in the enzyme), as shown in Figure 9.26. One water molecule remains bound
to the zinc ion in the complex. Direct measurements reveal that this water
molecule has a pKa value of 8.7, not as low as the value for the water molecule in carbonic anhydrase but substantially lower than the value for free
water. At pH 9.2, this complex accelerates the hydration of carbon dioxide
more than 100-fold. Although catalysis by this synthetic system is much
less efficient than catalysis by carbonic anhydrase, the model system
strongly suggests that the zinc-bound hydroxide mechanism is likely to be
correct. Carbonic anhydrases have evolved to utilize the reactivity intrinsic
to a zinc-bound hydroxide ion as a potent catalyst.

9.2.3 A Proton Shuttle Facilitates Rapid Regeneration of the
Active Form of the Enzyme
As noted earlier, some carbonic anhydrases can hydrate carbon dioxide at
rates as high as a million times a second (106 s1). The magnitude of this rate
can be understood from the following observations. At the conclusion of a carbon dioxide hydration reaction, the zinc-bound water molecule must lose a
proton to regenerate the active form of the enzyme (Figure 9.27). The rate of
the reverse reaction, the protonation of the zinc-bound hydroxide ion, is limited by the rate of proton diffusion. Protons diffuse very rapidly with second-

order rate constants near 1011 M1 s1. Thus, the backward rate constant
k1 must be less than 1011 M1 s1. Because the equilibrium constant K is
equal to k1/k1, the forward rate constant is given by k1  K  k1. Thus,
if k1  1011 M1 s1 and K  107 M (because pKa  7), then k1 must
be less than or equal to 104 s1. In other words, the rate of proton diffusion
limits the rate of proton release to less than 104 s1 for a group with pKa 7.
However, if carbon dioxide is hydrated at a rate of 106 s1, then every step
in the mechanism (see Figure 9.25) must take place at least this fast. How
can this apparent paradox be resolved?
The answer became clear with the realization that the highest rates of carbon dioxide hydration require the presence of buffer, suggesting that the buffer
components participate in the reaction. The buffer can bind or release protons.
The advantage is that, whereas the concentrations of protons and hydroxide
ions are limited to 107 M at neutral pH, the concentration of buffer components can be much higher, on the order of several millimolar. If the buffer
component BH has a pKa of 7 (matching that for the zinc-bound water),
then the equilibrium constant for the reaction in Figure 9.28 is 1. The rate
of proton abstraction is given by k1  [B]. The second-order rate constants
k1 and k1will be limited by buffer diffusion to values less than approximately 109 M1 s1. Thus, buffer concentrations greater than [B]  103
M (1 mM) may be high enough to support carbon dioxide hydration rates
of 106 M1 s1 because k1  [B]  (109 M1 s1)  (103 M)  106 s1.
This prediction is confirmed experimentally (Figure 9.29).
106
The molecular components of many buffers are too
large to reach the active site of carbonic anhydrase. Carbonic anhydrase II has evolved a proton shuttle to allow
buffer components to participate in the reaction from solution. The primary component of this shuttle is histidine
64. This residue transfers protons from the zinc-bound
water molecule to the protein surface and then to the
buffer (Figure 9.30). Thus, catalytic function has been enhanced through the evolution of an apparatus for controlling
proton transfer from and to the active site. Because protons
participate in many biochemical reactions, the manipulation of the proton inventory within active sites is crucial
to the function of many enzymes and explains the promi0

9.2.4 Convergent Evolution Has Generated Zinc-Based Active
Sites in Different Carbonic Anhydrases
Carbonic anhydrases homologous to the human enzymes, referred
to as -carbonic anhydrases, are common in animals and in some
bacteria and algae. In addition, two other families of carbonic anhydrases
have been discovered. The -carbonic anhydrases are found in higher
plants and in many bacterial species, including E. coli. These proteins contain the zinc required for catalytic activity but are not significantly similar in sequence to the -carbonic anhydrases. Furthermore, the -carbonic
anhydrases have only one conserved histidine residue, whereas the carbonic anhydrases have three. No three-dimensional structure is yet
available, but spectroscopic studies suggest that the zinc is bound by one
histidine residue, two cysteine residues (conserved among -carbonic anhydrases), and a water molecule. A third family, the -carbonic anhydrases,
also has been identified, initially in the archaeon Methanosarcina thermophila. The crystal structure of this enzyme reveals three zinc sites extremely similar to those in the -carbonic anhydrases. In this case, however, the three zinc sites lie at the interfaces between the three subunits of
a trimeric enzyme (Figure 9.31). The very striking left-handed -helix (a
 strand twisted into a left-handed helix) structure present in this enzyme
has also been found in enzymes that catalyze reactions unrelated to those
of carbonic anhydrase. Thus, convergent evolution has generated carbonic
anhydrases that rely on coordinated zinc ions at least three times. In each

case, the catalytic activity appears to be associated with zinc-bound water molecules.

9.3 RESTRICTION ENZYMES: PERFORMING HIGHLY
SPECIFIC DNA-CLEAVAGE REACTIONS
Let us next consider a hydrolytic reaction that results in the cleavage of
DNA. Bacteria and archaea have evolved mechanisms to protect themselves
from viral infections. Many viruses inject their DNA genomes into cells;
once inside, the viral DNA hijacks the cell’s machinery to drive the production of viral proteins and, eventually, of progeny virus. Often, a viral infection results in the death of the host. A major protective strategy for the
host is to use restriction endonucleases (restriction enzymes) to degrade the
viral DNA on its introduction into a cell. These enzymes recognize particular base sequences, called recognition sequences or recognition sites, in their
target DNA and cleave that DNA at defined positions. The most well studied class of restriction enzymes comprises the so-called type II restriction
enzymes, which cleave DNA within their recognition sequences. Other
types of restriction enzymes cleave DNA at positions somewhat distant
from their recognition sites.
Restriction endonucleases must show tremendous specificity at two levels. First, they must cleave only DNA molecules that contain recognition sites
(hereafter referred to as cognate DNA) without cleaving DNA molecules that
lack these sites. Suppose that a recognition sequence is six base pairs long.
Because there are 46, or 4096, sequences having six base pairs, the concentration of sites that must not be cleaved will be approximately 5000-fold as
high as the concentration of sites that should be cleaved. Thus, to keep from
damaging host-cell DNA, endonucleases must cleave cognate DNA molecules much more than 5000 times as efficiently as they cleave nonspecific
sites. Second, restriction enzymes must not degrade the host DNA. How do
these enzymes manage to degrade viral DNA while sparing their own?
The restriction endonuclease EcoRV (from E. coli) cleaves doublestranded viral DNA molecules that contain the sequence 5-GATATC-3
but leaves intact host DNA containing hundreds of such sequences. The
host DNA is protected by other enzymes called methylases, which methylate adenine bases within host recognition sequences (Figure 9.32). For
each restriction endonuclease, the host cell produces a corresponding
methylase that marks the host DNA and prevents its degradation. These
pairs of enzymes are referred to as restriction-modification systems. We shall
return to the mechanism used to achieve the necessary levels of specificity
after considering the chemistry of the cleavage process.

9.3.1 Cleavage Is by In-Line Displacement of 3 Oxygen
from Phosphorus by Magnesium-Activated Water

CHAPTER 9 • Catalytic Strategies

The fundamental reaction catalyzed by restriction endonucleases is the
hydrolysis of the phosphodiester backbone of DNA. Specifically, the bond
between the 3 oxygen atom and the phosphorus atom is broken. The products of this reaction are DNA strands with a free 3-hydroxyl group and a
5-phosphoryl group (Figure 9.33). This reaction proceeds by nucleophilic
attack at the phosphorus atom. We will consider two types of mechanism,
as suggested by analogy with the proteases. The restriction endonuclease
might cleave DNA in mechanism 1 through a covalent intermediate, employing a potent nucleophile (Nu), or in mechanism 2 by direct hydrolysis:

by replacing one oxygen atom with sulfur (called a phosphorothioate).
Let us consider EcoRV endonuclease. This enzyme cleaves the phosphodiester bond between the T and the A at the center of the recognition sequence 5-GATATC-3. The first step in monitoring the activity of the
enzyme is to synthesize an appropriate substrate for EcoRV containing
phosphorothioates at the sites of cleavage (Figure 9.34). The reaction is
then performed in water that has been greatly enriched in 18O to allow
the incoming oxygen atom to be marked. The location of the 18O label
with respect to the sulfur atom indicates whether the reaction proceeds with
inversion or retention of stereochemistry. The analysis revealed that the
stereochemical configuration at the phosphorus atom was inverted only once
with cleavage. This result is consistent with a direct attack of water at phosphorus and rules out the formation of any covalently bound intermediate
(Figure 9.35).

CHAPTER 9 • Catalytic Strategies

9.3.2 Restriction Enzymes Require Magnesium
for Catalytic Activity
Restriction endonucleases as well as many other enzymes that act on phosphate-containing substrates require Mg2 or some other similar divalent
cation for activity. What is the function of this metal?
It has been possible to examine the interactions of the magnesium ion
when it is bound to the enzyme. Crystals have been produced of EcoRV endonuclease bound to oligonucleotides that contain the appropriate recognition sequences. These crystals are grown in the absence of magnesium to
prevent cleavage; then, when produced, the crystals are soaked in solutions
containing the metal. No cleavage takes place, allowing the location of the
magnesium ion binding sites to be determined (Figure 9.36). The magnesium ion was found to be bound to six ligands: three are water molecules,
two are carboxylates of the enzyme’s aspartate residues, and one is an oxygen atom of the phosphoryl group at the site of cleavage. The magnesium
ion holds a water molecule in a position from which the water molecule can
attack the phosphoryl group and, in conjunction with the aspartate residues,
helps polarize the water molecule toward deprotonation. Because cleavage
does not take place within these crystals, the observed structure cannot be
the true catalytic conformation. Additional studies have revealed that a second magnesium ion must be present in an adjacent site for EcoRV endonuclease to cleave its substrate.

9.3.3 The Complete Catalytic Apparatus Is Assembled
Only Within Complexes of Cognate DNA Molecules,
Ensuring Specificity
We now return to the question of specificity, the defining feature of restriction enzymes. The recognition sequences for most restriction endonucleases are inverted repeats. This arrangement gives the three-dimensional
structure of the recognition site a twofold rotational symmetry (Figure 9.37).
The restriction enzymes display a corresponding symmetry to facilitate
recognition: they are dimers whose two subunits are related by twofold rotational symmetry. The matching symmetry of the recognition sequence and
the enzyme has been confirmed by the determination of the structure of the
complex between EcoRV endonuclease and DNA fragments containing its
recognition sequence (Figure 9.38). The enzyme surrounds the DNA in a
tight embrace. Examination of this structure reveals features that are highly
significant in determining specificity.

site, which is symmetric around the axis
of rotation designated in green. (B) The
inverted repeat within the recognition
sequence of EcoRV (and most other
restriction endonucleases) endows the
DNA site with twofold rotational symmetry.

A unique set of interactions occurs between the enzyme and a cognate
DNA sequence. Within the 5-GATATC-3 sequence, the G and A bases
at the 5 end of each strand and their Watson-Crick partners directly contact the enzyme by hydrogen bonding with residues that are located in two
loops, one projecting from the surface of each enzyme subunit (Figure 9.39).
The most striking feature of this complex is the distortion of the DNA, which
is substantially kinked in the center (Figure 9.40). The central two TA base
pairs in the recognition sequence play a key role in producing the kink. They
do not make contact with the enzyme but appear to be required because of
their ease of distortion. 5-TA-3 sequences are known to be among the most
easily deformed base pairs. The distortion of the DNA at this site has severe effects on the specificity of enzyme action.
Specificity is often determined by an enzyme’s binding affinity for substrates. In regard to EcoRV endonuclease, however, binding studies performed in the absence of magnesium have demonstrated that the enzyme
binds to all sequences, both cognate and noncognate, with approximately
equal affinity. However, the structures of complexes formed with noncognate DNA fragments are strikingly different from those formed with cognate DNA: the noncognate DNA conformation is not substantially distorted
(Figure 9.41). This lack of distortion has important consequences with regard
to catalysis. No phosphate is positioned sufficiently close to the active-site

aspartate residues to complete a magnesium ion binding site (see Figure 9.36).
Hence, the nonspecific complexes do not bind the magnesium ion and the
complete catalytic apparatus is never assembled. The distortion of the substrate and the subsequent binding of the magnesium ion account for the catalytic specificity of more than 1,000,000-fold that is observed for EcoRV endonuclease despite very little preference at the level of substrate binding.
We can now see the role of binding energy in this strategy for attaining
catalytic specificity. In binding to the enzyme, the DNA is distorted in such
a way that additional contacts are made between the enzyme and the
substrate, increasing the binding energy. However, this increase is canceled
by the energetic cost of distorting the DNA from its relaxed conformation
(Figure 9.42). Thus, for EcoRV endonuclease, there is little difference in
binding affinity for cognate and nonspecific DNA fragments. However,
the distortion in the cognate complex dramatically affects catalysis by

completing the magnesium ion binding site. This example illustrates how
enzymes can utilize available binding energy to deform substrates and poise them
for chemical transformation. Interactions that take place within the distorted
substrate complex stabilize the transition state leading to DNA hydrolysis.
The distortion in the DNA explains how methylation blocks catalysis
and protects host-cell DNA. When a methyl group is added to the amino
group of the adenine nucleotide at the 5 end of the recognition sequence,
the methyl group’s presence precludes the formation of a hydrogen bond between the amino group and the side-chain carbonyl group of asparagine 185
(Figure 9.43). This asparagine residue is closely linked to the other amino
acids that form specific contacts with the DNA. The absence of the hydrogen bond disrupts other interactions between the enzyme and the DNA
substrate, and the distortion necessary for cleavage will not take place.
9.3.4 Type II Restriction Enzymes Have a Catalytic Core
in Common and Are Probably Related by Horizontal
Gene Transfer
Type II restriction enzymes are prevalent in Archaea and Eubacteria. What can we tell of the evolutionary history of these enzymes?
Comparison of the amino acid sequences of a variety of type II restriction
endonucleases did not reveal significant sequence similarity between most
pairs of enzymes. However, a careful examination of three-dimensional
structures, taking into account the location of the active sites, revealed the
presence of a core structure conserved in the different enzymes. This structure includes  strands that contain the aspartate (or, in some cases, glutamate) residues forming the magnesium ion binding sites (Figure 9.44).
These observations indicate that many type II restriction enzymes are indeed evolutionary related. Analyses of the sequences in greater detail suggest that bacteria may have obtained genes encoding these enzymes from

other species by horizontal gene transfer, the passing between species of pieces
of DNA (such as plasmids) that provide a selective advantage in a particular environment. For example, EcoRI (from E. coli) and RsrI (from Rhodobacter sphaeroides) are 50% identical in sequence over 266 amino acids, clearly
indicative of a close evolutionary relationship. However, these species of bacteria are not closely related, as is known from sequence comparisons of other
genes and other evidence. Thus, it appears that these species obtained the gene
for this restriction endonuclease from a common source more recently than the
time of their evolutionary divergence. Moreover, the gene encoding EcoRI endonuclease uses particular codons to specify given amino acids that are strikingly different from the codons used by most E. coli genes, which suggests
that the gene did not originate in E. coli. Horizontal gene transfer may be a
relatively common event. For example, genes that inactivate antibiotics are
often transferred, leading to the transmission of antibiotic resistance from
one species to another. For restriction-modification systems, protection
against viral infections may have favored horizontal gene transfer.

9.4 NUCLEOSIDE MONOPHOSPHATE KINASES:
CATALYZING PHOSPHORYL GROUP EXCHANGE BETWEEN
NUCLEOTIDES WITHOUT PROMOTING HYDROLYSIS

BamHI

The final enzymes that we shall consider are the nucleoside monophosphate
kinases (NMP kinases), typified by adenylate kinase. These enzymes catalyze the transfer of the terminal phosphoryl group from a nucleoside
triphosphate (NTP), usually ATP, to the phosphoryl group on a nucleoside
monophosphate (Figure 9.45). The challenge for NMP kinases is to promote the transfer of the phosphoryl group from NTP to NMP without promoting the competing reaction—the transfer of a phosphoryl group from
NTP to water; that is, NTP hydrolysis. We shall see how the use of induced
fit by these enzymes is used to solve this problem. Moreover, these enzymes
employ metal ion catalysis; but, in this case, the metal forms a complex with
the substrate to enhance enzyme–substrate interaction.

P-Loop Structures

9-27

NMP Kinases

X-ray crystallographic methods have yielded the three-dimensional structures of a number of different NMP kinases, both free and bound to substrates or substrate analogs. Comparison of these structures reveals that these
enzymes form a family of homologous proteins (Figure 9.46). In particular,
such comparisons reveal the presence of a conserved NTP-binding domain.
This domain consists of a central  sheet, surrounded on both sides by  helices (Figure 9.47). A characteristic feature of this domain is a loop between
the first  strand and the first helix. This loop, which typically has an amino
acid sequence of the form Gly-X-X-X-X-Gly-Lys, is often referred to as the
P-loop because it interacts with phosphoryl groups on the bound nucleotide
(Figure 9.48). As described in Section 9.4.4, similar domains containing Ploops are present in a wide variety of important nucleotide-binding proteins.

9.4.2 Magnesium (or Manganese) Complexes of Nucleoside
Triphosphates Are the True Substrates for Essentially All
NTP-Dependent Enzymes

9-28

CHAPTER 9 • Catalytic Strategies

Kinetic studies of NMP kinases, as well as many other enzymes having ATP
or other nucleoside triphosphates as a substrate, reveal that these enzymes
are essentially inactive in the absence of divalent metal ions such as magnesium (Mg2) or manganese (Mn2), but acquire activity on the addition
of these ions. In contrast with the enzymes discussed so far, the metal is not
a component of the active site. Rather, nucleotides such as ATP bind these
ions, and it is the metal ion–nucleotide complex that is the true substrate for
the enzymes. The dissociation constant for the ATP–Mg2 complex is approximately 0.1 mM, and thus, given that intracellular Mg2 concentrations are typically in the millimolar range, essentially all nucleoside triphosphates are present as NTP–Mg2 complexes.
How does the binding of the magnesium ion to the nucleotide affect
catalysis? There are a number of related consequences, but all serve to enhance the specificity of the enzyme–substrate interactions by enhancing
binding energy. First, the magnesium ion neutralizes some of the negative
charges present on the polyphosphate chain, reducing nonspecific ionic interactions between the enzyme and the polyphosphate group of the nucleotide. Second, the interactions between the magnesium ion and the oxygen atoms in the phosphoryl group hold the nucleotide in well-defined
conformations that can be specifically bound by the enzyme (Figure 9.49).
Magnesium ions are typically coordinated to six groups in an octahedral
arrangement. Typically, two oxygen atoms are directly coordinated to a
magnesium ion, with the remaining coordination positions often occupied

by water molecules. Oxygen atoms of the  and ,  and , or  and  phosphoryl groups may contribute, depending on the particular enzyme. In addition, different stereoisomers are produced, depending on exactly which
oxygen atoms bind to the metal ion. Third, the magnesium ion provides additional points of interaction between the ATP–Mg2 complex and the enzyme, thus increasing the binding energy. In some cases, such as the DNA
polymerases (Section 27.x.x), side chains (often aspartate and glutamate
residues) of the enzyme can bind directly to the magnesium ion. In other
cases, the enzyme interacts indirectly with the magnesium ion through hydrogen bonds to the coordinated water molecules (Figure 9.50). Such interactions have been observed in adenylate kinases bound to ATP analogs.
9.4.3 ATP Binding Induces Large Conformational Changes
Comparison of the structure of adenylate kinase in the presence and absence
of an ATP analog reveals that substrate binding induces large structural
changes in the kinase, providing a classic example of the use of induced fit
(Figure 9.51). The P-loop closes down on top of the polyphosphate chain,
interacting most extensively with the  phosphoryl group. The movement
of the P-loop permits the top domain of the enzyme to move down to form
a lid over the bound nucleotide. This motion is favored by interactions between basic residues (conserved among the NMP kinases), the peptide backbone NH groups, and the nucleotide. With the ATP nucleotide held in this
position, its  phosphoryl group is positioned next to the binding site for
the second substrate, NMP. In sum, the direct interactions with the nucleotide substrate lead to local structural rearrangements (movement of the
P-loop) within the enzyme, which in turn allow more extensive changes (the
closing down of the top domain) to take place. The binding of the second
substrate, NMP, induces additional conformational changes. Both sets of
changes ensure that a catalytically competent conformation is formed only
when both the donor and the acceptor are bound, preventing wasteful transfer of the phosphoryl group to water. The enzyme holds its two substrates
close together and appropriately oriented to stabilize the transition state that
leads to the transfer of a phosphoryl group from the ATP to the NMP. This
is an example of catalysis by approximation. We will see such examples of a
catalytically competent active site being generated only on substrate binding many times in our study of biochemistry.
9.4.4 P-Loop NTPase Domains Are Present in a
Range of Important Proteins
Domains similar (and almost certainly homologous) to those found
in NMP kinases are present in a remarkably wide array of proteins,
many of which participate in essential biochemical processes. Examples include ATP synthase, the key enzyme responsible for ATP generation; molecular motor proteins such as myosin; signal-transduction proteins such as
transducin; proteins essential for translating mRNA into proteins, such as
elongation factor Tu; and DNA and RNA unwinding helicases. The wide
utility of P-loop NTPase domains is perhaps best explained by their ability to undergo substantial conformational changes on nucleoside triphosphate binding and hydrolysis. We shall encounter these domains (hereafter
referred to as P-loop NTPases) throughout the book and shall observe how
they function as springs, motors, and clocks. To allow easy recognition of
these domains, they, like the binding domains of the NMP kinases, will be
depicted with the inner surfaces of the ribbons in a ribbon diagram shown
in purple and the P-loop shown in green (Figure 9.52).

Enzymes adopt conformations that are structurally and chemically
complementary to the transition states of the reactions that they catalyze. Sets of interacting amino acid residues make up sites with the special structural and chemical properties necessary to stabilize the transition state. Enzymes use five basic strategies to form and stabilize the
transition state: (1) the use of binding energy, (2) covalent catalysis, (3)
general acid–base catalysis, (4) metal ion catalysis, and (5) catalysis by
approximation. Of the enzymes examined in this chapter, three groups
of enzymes catalyze the addition of water to their substrates but have
different requirements for catalytic speed and specificity, and a fourth
group of enzymes must prevent reaction with water.

• Proteases: Facilitating a Difficult Reaction

The cleavage of peptide bonds by chymotrypsin is initiated by the attack
of a serine residue on the peptide carbonyl group. The attacking hydroxyl
group is activated by interaction with the imidazole group of a histidine
residue, which is, in turn, linked to an aspartate residue. This Ser-HisAsp catalytic triad generates a powerful nucleophile. The product of this

7552dc09_001-034

3/26/01

12:54 PM

Page 9-31

initial reaction is a covalent intermediate formed by the enzyme and an
acyl group derived from the bound substrate. The hydrolysis of this acylenzyme intermediate completes the cleavage process. The tetrahedral intermediates for these reactions have a negative charge on the peptide carbonyl oxygen atom. This negative charge is stabilized by interactions with
peptide NH groups in a region on the enzyme termed the oxyanion hole.
Other proteases employ the same catalytic strategy. Some of these proteases, such as trypsin and elastase, are homologs of chymotrypsin. In other
proteases, such as subtilisin, a very similar catalytic triad has arisen by convergent evolution. Active-site structures that differ from the catalytic triad
are present in a number of other classes of proteases. These classes employ
a range of catalytic strategies but, in each case, a nucleophile is generated
that is sufficiently powerful to attack the peptide carbonyl group. In some
enzymes, the nucleophile is derived from a side chain; whereas, in others,
an activated water molecule attacks the peptide carbonyl directly.

• Carbonic Anhydrases: Making a Fast Reaction Faster

Carbonic anhydrases catalyze the reaction of water with carbon dioxide
to generate carbonic acid. The catalysis can be extremely fast: molecules
of some carbonic anhydrases hydrate carbon dioxide at rates as high as
1 million times per second. A tightly bound zinc ion is a crucial component of the active sites of these enzymes. Each zinc ion binds a water molecule and promotes its deprotonation to generate a hydroxide ion
at neutral pH. This hydroxide attacks carbon dioxide to form bicarbonate ion, HCO3. Because of the physiological roles of carbon dioxide and bicarbonate ions, speed is of the essence for this enzyme. To
overcome limitations imposed by the rate of proton transfer from the
zinc-bound water molecule, the most active carbonic anhydrases have
evolved a proton shuttle to transfer protons to a buffer.

• Restriction Enzymes: Performing Highly Specific DNA Cleavage Reactions

A high level of substrate specificity is often the key to biological function. Restriction endonucleases that cleave DNA at specific recognition
sequences discriminate between molecules that contain these recognition sequences and those that do not. Within the enzyme–substrate
complex, the DNA substrate is distorted in a manner that generates a
magnesium ion binding site between the enzyme and DNA. The magnesium ion binds and activates a water molecule, which attacks the
phosphodiester backbone.
Some enzymes discriminate between potential substrates by binding
them with different affinities. Others may bind many potential substrates
but promote chemical reactions efficiently only on specific molecules.
Restriction endonucleases such as EcoRV endonuclease employ the latter mechanism to achieve levels of discrimination as high as million-fold.
Structural studies reveal that these enzymes may bind nonspecific DNA
molecules, but such molecules are not distorted in a manner that allows
magnesium ion binding and, hence, catalysis. Restriction enzymes are
prevented from acting on the DNA of a host cell by the methylation of
key sites within their recognition sequences. The added methyl groups
block specific interactions between the enzymes and the DNA such that
the distortion necessary for cleavage does not take place.

between nucleotides rather than to a molecule of water. This class of

enzyme displays a structural motif called the P-loop NTPase domain that
is present in a wide array of nucleotide-binding proteins. The closing of
the P-loop over a bound nucleoside triphosphate substrate permits the
top domain of the enzyme to form a lid over the bound nucleotide, positioning the triphosphate near the monophosphate with which it will react, in an example of catalysis by approximation. These enzymes are dependent on metal ions, but the ions bind to substrate instead of directly
to the enzyme. The binding of the metal ion to the nucleoside triphosphate enhances the specificity of the enzyme–substrate interactions by
holding the nucleotide in a well-defined conformation and providing additional points of interaction, thus increasing binding energy.

CHAPTER 10

Regulatory Strategies: Enzymes
and Hemoglobin

CTP

Like motor traffic, metabolic pathways flow more efficiently
when regulated by signals. CTP, the final product of a multistep
pathway, controls flux through the pathway by inhibiting the committed step catalyzed by aspartate transcarbamoylase (ATCase).
[(Left) Richard Berenholtz/The Stock Market.]

The activity of proteins, including enzymes, often must be regulated so that
they function at the proper time and place. The biological activity of proteins is regulated in four principal ways:
1. Allosteric control. Allosteric proteins contain distinct regulatory sites and
multiple functional sites. Regulation by small signal molecules is a significant means of controlling the activity of many proteins. The
binding of these regulatory molecules at sites distinct from

2. Multiple forms of enzymes. Isozymes, or isoenzymes, provide an avenue
for varying regulation of the same reaction at distinct locations or times.
Isozymes are homologous enzymes within a single organism that catalyze
the same reaction but differ slightly in structure and more obviously in KM
and Vmax values, as well as regulatory properties. Often, isozymes are expressed in a distinct tissue or organelle or at a distinct stage of development.
3. Reversible covalent modification. The catalytic properties of many enzymes
are markedly altered by the covalent attachment of a modifying group, most
commonly a phosphoryl group. ATP serves as the phosphoryl donor in these
reactions, which are catalyzed by protein kinases. The removal of phosphoryl groups by hydrolysis is catalyzed by protein phosphatases. This chapter
considers the structure, specificity, and control of protein kinase A (PKA), a
ubiquitous eukaryotic enzyme that regulates diverse target proteins.
4. Proteolytic activation. The enzymes controlled by some of these mechanisms cycle between active and inactive states. A different regulatory motif is used to irreversibly convert an inactive enzyme into an active one. Many
enzymes are activated by the hydrolysis of a few or even one peptide bond
in inactive precursors called zymogens or proenzymes. This regulatory mechanism generates digestive enzymes such as chymotrypsin, trypsin, and
pepsin. Caspases, which are proteolytic enzymes that are the executioners
in programmed cell death, or apoptosis (Section 2.4.3), are proteolytically activated from the procaspase form. Blood clotting is due to a remarkable cascade of zymogen activations. Active digestive and clotting enzymes are
switched off by the irreversible binding of specific inhibitory proteins that
are irresistible lures to their molecular prey.
To begin, we will consider the principles of allostery by examining two
proteins: the enzyme aspartate transcarbamoylase and the oxygen-transporting protein hemoglobin.

ALLOSTERICALLY INHIBITED BY THE END
PRODUCT OF ITS PATHWAY
Aspartate transcarbamoylase catalyzes the first step in the biosynthesis of
pyrimidines, bases that are components of nucleic acids. The reaction catalyzed by this enzyme is the condensation of aspartate and carbamoyl phosphate to form N-carbamoylaspartate and orthophosphate (Figure 10.1).

ATCase catalyzes the committed step in the pathway that will ultimately
yield pyrimidine nucleotides such as cytidine triphosphate (CTP). How is
this enzyme regulated to generate precisely the amount of CTP needed by
the cell?
John Gerhart and Arthur Pardee found that ATCase is inhibited by
CTP, the final product of the ATCase-controlled pathway. The rate of the
reaction catalyzed by ATCase is fast in the absence of high concentrations
of CTP but decreases as the CTP concentration increases (Figure 10.2).
Thus, more molecules are sent along the pathway to make new pyrimidines
until sufficient quantities of CTP have accumulated. The effect of CTP on
the enzyme exemplifies the feedback, or end-product, inhibition mentioned
earlier. Despite the fact that end-product regulation makes considerable
physiological sense, the observation that ATCase is inhibited by CTP is remarkable because CTP is structurally quite different from the substrates of
the reaction (see Figure 10.1). Owing to this structural dissimilarity, CTP
must bind to a site distinct from the active site where substrate binds. Such
sites are called allosteric (from the Greek allos, “other,” and stereos, “structure”) or regulatory sites. CTP is an example of an allosteric inhibitor. In
ATCase (but not all allosterically regulated enzymes), the catalytic sites and
the regulatory sites are on separate polypeptide chains.

products.

10.1.1 ACTase Consists of Separable Catalytic
and Regulatory Subunits
What is the evidence that ATCase has distinct regulatory and catalytic sites?
ATCase can be literally separated into regulatory and catalytic subunits by
treatment with a mercurial compound such as p-hydroxymercuribenzoate,
which reacts with sulfhydryl groups (Figure 10.3). The results of ultracentrifugation studies carried out by Gerhart and Howard Schachman showed
that p-hydroxymercuribenzoate dissociates ATCase into two kinds of subunits (Figure 10.4). The sedimentation coefficient of the native enzyme is
11.6S, whereas those of the dissociated subunits are 2.8S and 5.8S, indicating subunits of different size. The subunits can be readily separated by ionexchange chromatography because they differ markedly in charge (Section
4.1.3) or by centrifugation in a sucrose density gradient because they differ
in size (Section 4.1.6). Furthermore, the attached p-mercuribenzoate groups
can be removed from the separated subunits by adding an excess of mercaptoethanol. The isolated subunits provide materials that can be used to
investigate and characterize the individual subunits and their interactions
with one another.
The larger subunit is called the catalytic (or c) subunit. This subunit displays catalytic activity, but it is not affected by CTP. The isolated smaller
subunit can bind CTP, but has no catalytic activity. Hence, that subunit is
called the regulatory (or r) subunit. The catalytic subunit, which consists of

consists of two chains (17 kd each), is referred to as r2. The catalytic and
regulatory subunits combine rapidly when they are mixed. The resulting
complex has the same structure, c6r6, as the native enzyme: two catalytic
trimers and three regulatory dimers.
2 c3  3 r2 88n c6r6
Furthermore, the reconstituted enzyme has the same allosteric properties
as the native enzyme. Thus, ATCase is composed of discrete catalytic and
regulatory subunits, which interact in the native enzyme to produce its allosteric behavior.
10.1.2 Allosteric Interactions in ATCase Are Mediated
by Large Changes in Quaternary Structure
How can the binding of CTP to a regulatory subunit influence reactions at
the active site of a catalytic subunit? Significant clues have been provided by
the determination of the three-dimensional structure of ATCase in various
forms by x-ray crystallography in the laboratory of William Lipscomb. The
structure of the enzyme without any ligands bound to it confirms the overall structure of the enzyme. Two catalytic trimers are stacked one on top of
the other, linked by three dimers of the regulatory chains (Figure 10.5). There
are significant contacts between the two catalytic trimers: each r chain within
a regulatory dimer interacts with a c chain within a catalytic trimer through
a structural domain stabilized by a zinc ion bound to four cysteine residues.

The ability of p-hydroxymercuribenzoate to dissociate the catalytic and regulatory subunits is related to the ability of mercury to bind strongly to the
cysteine residues, displacing the zinc and destabilizing this domain.
To understand the mechanism of allosteric regulation, it is crucial to locate each active site and each regulatory site in the three-dimensional structure. To locate the active sites, the enzyme was crystallized in the presence
of N-(phosphonacetyl)-L-aspartate (PALA), a bisubstrate analog (an analog of the two substrates) that resembles an intermediate along the pathway of catalysis (Figure 10.6). PALA is a potent competitive inhibitor of
ATCase; it binds to and blocks the active sites. The structure of the
ATCase–PALA complex reveals that PALA binds at sites lying at the
boundaries between pairs of c chains within a catalytic trimer (Figure 10.7).
Note that, though most of the residues belong to one subunit, several key
residues belong to a neighboring subunit. Thus, because the active sites are
at the subunit interface, each catalytic trimer contributes three active sites
to the complete enzyme. Suitable amino acid residues are available in the
active sites for recognizing all features of the bisubstrate analog, including
the phosphate and both carboxylate groups.

FIGURE 10.7 The active site of ATCase.
Some of the crucial active-site residues are
shown binding to the inhibitor PALA. The
active site is composed mainly of residues
from one subunit, but an adjacent subunit
also contributes important residues (boxed

Further examination of the ATCase–PALA complex reveals a remarkable
change in quaternary structure on binding of PALA. The two catalytic trimers
move 12 Å farther apart and rotate approximately 10 degrees about their common threefold axis of symmetry. Moreover, the regulatory dimers rotate approximately 15 degrees to accommodate this motion (Figure 10.8). The enzyme literally expands on PALA binding. In essence, ATCase has two
distinct quaternary forms: one that predominates in the absence of substrate
or substrate analogs and another that predominates when substrates or analogs
are bound. These forms will be referred to as the T (for tense) state and the
R (for relaxed) state, respectively. The T state has lower affinity for substrates
and, hence, lower catalytic activity than does the R state. In the presence of
any fixed concentration of aspartate and carbamoyl phosphate, the enzyme
exists in equilibrium between the T and the R forms. The position of the equilibrium depends on the number of active sites that are occupied by substrate.
Having located the active sites and seen that PALA binding results in
substantial structural changes in the entire ATCase molecule, we now turn
our attention to the effects of CTP. Where on the regulatory subunit does
CTP bind? Determination of the structure of ATCase in the presence of
CTP reveals a binding site for this nucleotide in each regulatory chain in a
domain that does not interact with the catalytic subunit (Figure 10.9). The
question naturally arises as to how CTP can inhibit the catalytic activity of
the enzyme when it does not interact with the catalytic chain. Each active
site is more than 50 Å from the nearest CTP binding site. The CTP-bound
form is in the T quaternary state in the absence of bound substrate.
The quaternary structural changes observed on substrate-analog binding suggest a mechanism for the allosteric regulation of ATCase by CTP
(Figure 10.10). The binding of the inhibitor CTP shifts the equilibrium
toward the T state, decreasing the net enzyme activity and reducing the rate
of N-carbamoylaspartate generation. This mechanism for allosteric regulation is referred to as the concerted mechanism because the change in the enT state

zyme is “all or none”; the entire enzyme is converted from T into R, affecting all of the catalytic sites equally. The concerted mechanism stands in
contrast with the sequential mechanism, which will be discussed shortly.
10.1.3 Allosterically Regulated Enzymes Do Not Follow
Michaelis-Menten Kinetics
Allosteric enzymes are distinguished by their response to substrate concentration in addition to their susceptibility to regulation by other molecules. Examining the rate of product formation as a function of substrate
concentration can be a source of further insights into the mechanism of regulation of ATCase (Figure 10.11). The curve differs from that expected for
an enzyme that follows Michaelis-Menten kinetics. The observed curve is
referred to as sigmoid because it resembles an “S.” How can we explain this
kinetic behavior in light of the structural observations? In the absence of
substrate, the enzyme exists almost entirely in the T state. However, the
binding of substrate molecules to the enzyme shifts the enzyme toward the
R state. A transition from T to R favored by substrate binding to one site
will increase the enzymatic activity of the remaining five sites, leading to an
overall increase in enzyme activity. This important property is called cooperativity because the subunits cooperate with one another. If one subunit
switches conformation, they all do. The sigmoid curve can be pictured as a
composite of two Michaelis-Menten curves, one corresponding to the T
state and the other to the R state. An increase in substrate concentration favors a transition from the T-state curve to the R-state curve (Figure 10.12).
The importance of the changes in quaternary structure in determining
the sigmoidal curve is illustrated nicely by studies of the isolated catalytic
trimer, freed by p-hydroxymercuribenzoate treatment. The catalytic subunit shows Michaelis-Menton kinetics with kinetic parameters that are indistinguishable from those deduced for the R state. Thus, the term tense is
apt: in the T state, the regulatory dimers hold the two catalytic trimers sufficiently close to one other that key loops on their surfaces collide and interfere with conformational adjustments necessary for high-affinity substrate binding and catalysis.

What is the effect of CTP on the kinetic profile of ATCase? CTP increases
the initial phase of the sigmoidal curve (Figure 10.13). As noted earlier, CTP
inhibits the activity of ATCase. In the presence of CTP, the enzyme becomes less responsive to the cooperative effects facilitated by substrate binding; more substrate is required to attain a given reaction rate. Interestingly,
ATP, too, is an allosteric effector of ATCase. However, the effect of ATP
is to increase the reaction rate at a given aspartate concentration (Figure
10.14). At high concentrations of ATP, the kinetic profile shows a lesspronounced sigmoidal behavior. Note that such sigmoidal behavior has an

that corresponds to the R state. As the
concentration of substrate is increased,
the equilibrium shifts from the T state to
the R state, which results in a steep rise
in activity with respect to substrate
concentration.

additional consequence: in the concentration range where the T-to-R transition is taking place, the curve depends quite steeply on the substrate concentration. The effects of substrates on allosteric enzymes are referred to as
homotropic effects (from the Greek homós, “same”). In contrast, the effects
of nonsubstrate molecules on allosteric enzymes (such as those of CTP and
ATP on ATCase) are referred to as heterotropic effects (from the Greek
héteros, “different”).
The increase in ATCase activity in response to increased ATP concentration has two potential physiological explanations. First, high ATP concentration signals a high concentration of purine nucleotides in the cell; the
increase in ATCase activity will tend to balance the purine and pyrimidine
pools. Second, a high concentration of ATP indicates that there is significant energy stored in the cell to promote mRNA synthesis and DNA
replication.
10.1.5 The Concerted Model Can Be Formulated
in Quantitative Terms
CONCEPTUAL INSIGHTS, Cooperative Binding and Kinetics. Interactive
graphing activities allow you to experiment with changes in the parameters and
conditions of the MWC model in order to increase your understanding of the model and
its implications for cooperative binding and kinetics.

The concerted model was first proposed by Jacques Monod, Jeffries
Wyman, and Jean-Pierre Changeux; hence, it is often referred to as the
MWC model. This model can be formulated in quantitative terms. Consider an enzyme with n identical active sites. Suppose that the enzyme exists in equilibrium between a T form with a low affinity for its substrate and
an R form with a high affinity for the substrate. We can define L as the equilibrium constant between the R and the T forms; c as the ratio of the affinities of the two forms for the substrate, S, measured as dissociation constants;
and  as the ratio of substrate concentration to the dissociation constant KR.

with L  200 and c  0.1. Thus, in the absence of bound substrate, the equilibrium favors the T form by a factor of 200 (i.e., only 1 in 200 molecules
is in the R form), and the affinity of the R form for substrate is approximately 10 times as high as that of the T form. As substrate binds to each
active site, the equilibrium shifts toward the R form. For example, with
these parameters, when half the active sites (three of six) are occupied by
substrate, the equilibrium has shifted so that the ratio of T to R is now 1 to
5; that is, nearly all the molecules are in the R form.
The effects of CTP and ATP can be modeled simply by changing the
value of L. For the CTP-saturated form, the value of L increases to 1250.
Thus, it takes more substrate to shift the equilibrium appreciably to the
R form. For the ATP saturated form, the value of L decreases to 70
(Figure 10.15).

10.1.6 Sequential Models Also Can Account for Allosteric Effects
In the concerted model, an allosteric enzyme can exist in one of only two
states, T and R; no intermediate states are allowed. An alternative, first proposed by Daniel Koshland, posits that sequential changes in structure take
place within an oligomeric enzyme as active sites are occupied. The binding of substrate to one site influences the substrate affinity of neighboring
active sites without necessarily inducing a transition encompassing the entire
enzyme (Figure 10.16). An important feature of sequential in contrast with
concerted models is that the former can account for negative cooperativity,
in which the binding of substrate to one active site decreases the affinity of
other sites for substrate. The results of studies of a number of allosteric proteins suggest that most behave according to some combination of the sequential and cooperative models.

Allostery is a property not limited to enzymes. The basic principles of allostery are also well illustrated by the oxygen-transport protein hemoglobin
(Section 7.2). The binding of oxygen to hemoglobin isolated from red blood
cells displays marked sigmoidal behavior (similar to that observed for the
activity of ATCase, as a function of substrate concentration), which is indicative of cooperation between subunits (Figure 10.17). What is the physiological significance of the cooperative binding of oxygen by hemoglobin?
Oxygen must be transported in the blood from the lungs, where the partial
pressure of oxygen (pO2) is relatively high (approximately 100 torr), to the
tissues, where the partial pressure of oxygen is much lower (typically 20 torr).
Let us consider how the cooperative behavior represented by the sigmoidal

curve leads to efficient oxygen transport. In the lungs, hemoglobin becomes
nearly saturated with oxygen such that 98% of the oxygen-binding sites are
occupied. When hemoglobin moves to the tissues, the saturation level drops
to 32%. Thus, a total of 98  32  66% of the potential oxygen-binding sites
contribute to oxygen transport. In comparison, for a hypothetical noncooperative transport protein, the most oxygen that can be transported from a
region in which pO2 is 100 torr to one in which it is 20 torr is 63  25  38%
(see Figure 10.17). Thus, the cooperative binding of oxygen by hemoglobin enables it to deliver 1.7 times as much oxygen as it would if the sites were independent. The homotropic regulation of hemoglobin by its ligand oxygen dramatically increases its physiological oxygen-carrying capacity.

The results of structural studies pioneered by Max Perutz revealed the
structure of hemoglobin in various forms. Human hemoglobin A, present
in adults, consists of four subunits: two  subunits and two  subunits. The
 and  subunits are homologous and have similar three-dimensional structures (Section 7.4). The capacity of hemoglobin to bind oxygen depends on
the presence of a bound prosthetic group called heme. The heme group is
responsible for the distinctive red color of blood. The heme group consists
of an organic component and a central iron atom. The organic component,
called protoporphyrin, is made up of four pyrrole rings linked by methene
bridges to form a tetrapyrrole ring. Four methyl groups, two vinyl groups,
and two propionate side chains are attached.
The iron atom lies in the center of the protoporphyrin, bonded to the
four pyrrole nitrogen atoms. Under normal conditions, the iron is in the ferrous (Fe2) oxidation state. The iron ion can form two additional bonds,
one on each side of the heme plane. These binding sites are called the fifth
and sixth coordination sites. In hemoglobin, the fifth coordination site is
occupied by the imidazole ring of a histidine residue from the protein. In
deoxyhemoglobin, the sixth coordination site remains unoccupied. The iron
ion lies approximately 0.4 Å outside the porphyrin plane because iron, in
this form, is slightly too large to fit into the well-defined hole within the
porphyrin ring (Figure 10.18).
The binding of the oxygen molecule at the sixth coordination site of the
iron ion substantially rearranges the electrons within the iron so that the ion
becomes effectively smaller, allowing it to move into the plane of the porphyrin (Figure 10.19). This change in electronic structure is paralleled by

changes in the magnetic properties of hemoglobin, which are the basis for
functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI; Section 32.1.3). Indeed, the
structural changes that take place on oxygen binding were anticipated by
Linus Pauling, based on magnetic measurements in 1936, nearly 25 years
before the three-dimensional structure of hemoglobin was elucidated.

10.2.2 Oxygen Binding Markedly Changes the Quaternary
Structure of Hemoglobin
The three-dimensional structure of hemoglobin is best described as a pair
of identical  dimers (11 and 22) that associate to form the hemoglobin tetramer (Figure 10.20). In deoxyhemoglobin, these  dimers are
linked by an extensive interface, which includes, among other regions, the
carboxyl terminus of each chain. The heme groups are well separated in the
tetramer with iron–iron distances ranging from 24 to 40 Å. The deoxy form
corresponds to the T state in the context of either the concerted or the sequential model for hemoglobin cooperativity. On oxygen binding, there are
substantial changes in quaternary structure that correspond to the T-to-R
state transition (Figure 10.21).

FIGURE 10.21 Transition from T to R state in hemoglobin. On oxygenation,
one pair of  subunits shifts with respect to the other by a rotation of 15 degrees.

The 11 and 22 dimers rotate approximately 15 degrees with respect to
one another. The dimers themselves are relatively unchanged, although localized conformational shifts do occur. Thus, the interface between the 11
and 22 dimers is most effected by this structural transition.
How does oxygen binding lead to the structural transition from the T
state to the R state? When the iron ion moves into the plane of the porphyrin, the histidine residue bound in the fifth coordination site moves with
it. This histidine residue is part of an  helix, which also moves (Figure
10.22). The carboxyl terminal end of this  helix lies in the interface between the two  dimers. Consequently, the structural transition at the iron
ion is directly transmitted to the other subunits. The rearrangement of the
dimer interface provides a pathway for communication between subunits,
enabling the cooperative binding of oxygen.
Is the cooperative binding of oxygen by hemoglobin best described
by the concerted or the sequential model? Neither model in its pure form
fully accounts for the behavior of hemoglobin. Instead, a combined model

is required. Hemoglobin behavior is concerted in that hemoglobin with
three sites occupied by oxygen is in the quaternary structure associated with
the R state. The remaining open binding site has an affinity for oxygen more
than 20-fold as great as that of fully deoxygenated hemoglobin binding its
first oxygen. However, the behavior is not fully concerted, because hemoglobin with oxygen bound to only one of four sites remains in the T-state
quaternary structure. Yet, this molecule binds oxygen 3 times as strongly as
does fully deoxygenated hemoglobin, an observation consistent only with a
sequential model. These results highlight the fact that the concerted and sequential models represent idealized limiting cases, which real systems may
approach but rarely attain.

2,3-Bisphosphoglycerate
(2,3-BPG)

Examination of the oxygen binding of hemoglobin fully purified from red
blood cells revealed that the oxygen affinity of purified hemoglobin is much
greater than that for hemoglobin within red blood cells. This dramatic difference is due to the presence within these cells of 2,3-bisphosphoglycerate
(2,3-BPG) (also known as 2,3-diphosphoglycerate or 2,3-DPG). This
highly anionic compound is present in red blood cells at approximately the
same concentration as that of hemoglobin ( 2 mM). Without 2,3-BPG,
hemoglobin would be an extremely inefficient oxygen transporter, releasing only 8% of its cargo in the tissues.
How does 2,3-BPG affect oxygen affinity so significantly? Examination
of the crystal structure of deoxyhemoglobin in the presence of 2,3-BPG reveals that a single molecule of 2,3-BPG binds in a pocket, present only in
the T form, in the center of the hemoglobin tetramer (Figure 10.23). On
T-to-R transition, this pocket collapses. Thus, 2,3-BPG binds preferentially
to deoxyhemoglobin and stabilizes it, effectively reducing the oxygen affinity. In order for the structural transition from T to R to take place, the bonds
between hemoglobin and 2,3-BPG must be broken and 2,3-BPG must be
expelled.

2,3-BPG binding to hemoglobin has other crucial physiological consequences. The globin gene expressed by fetuses differs from that
expressed by human adults; fetal hemoglobin tetramers include two 
chains and two  chains. The  chain, a result of another gene duplication,
is 72% identical in amino acid sequence with the  chain. One noteworthy
change is the substitution of a serine residue for His 143 in the  chain of
the 2,3-BPG-binding site. This change removes two positive charges
from the 2,3-BPG-binding site (one from each chain) and reduces the
affinity of 2,3-BPG for fetal hemoglobin, thereby increasing the oxygen-

binding affinity of fetal hemoglobin relative to that of maternal (adult) hemoglobin (Figure 10.24). This difference in oxygen affinity allows oxygen
to be effectively transferred from maternal to fetal red cells. We see again
an example of where gene duplication and specialization produced a ready
solution to a biological challenge—in this case, the transport of oxygen
from mother to fetus.
10.2.4 The Bohr Effect: Hydrogen Ions and Carbon Dioxide
Promote the Release of Oxygen
Rapidly metabolizing tissues, such as contracting muscle, have a high need
for oxygen and generate large amounts of hydrogen ions and carbon dioxide as well (Sections 16.1.9 and 17.1). Both of these species are heterotropic
effectors of hemoglobin that enhance oxygen release. The oxygen affinity
of hemoglobin decreases as pH decreases from the value of 7.4 found in the
lungs (Figure 10.25). Thus, as hemoglobin moves into a region of low pH,
its tendency to release oxygen increases. For example, transport from the
lungs, with pH 7.4 and an oxygen partial pressure of 100 torr, to active muscle, with a pH of 7.2 and an oxygen partial pressure of 20 torr, results in a
release of oxygen amounting to 77% of total carrying capacity. Recall that
only 66% of the oxygen would be released in the absence of any change in
pH. In addition, hemoglobin responds to carbon dioxide with a decrease in
oxygen affinity, thus facilitating the release of oxygen in tissues with a high
carbon dioxide concentration. In the presence of carbon dioxide at a partial
pressure of 40 torr, the amount of oxygen released approaches 90% of the
maximum carrying capacity. Thus, the heterotropic regulation of hemoglobin
by hydrogen ions and carbon dioxide further increases the oxygen-transporting
efficiency of this magnificent allosteric protein.
The regulation of oxygen binding by hydrogen ions and carbon dioxide
is called the Bohr effect after Christian Bohr, who described this phenomenon in 1904. The results of structural and chemical studies have revealed
much about the chemical basis of the Bohr effect. At least two sets of chemical groups are responsible for the effect of protons: the amino termini and
the side chains of histidines 146 and 122, which have pKa values near
pH 7. Consider histidine 146. In deoxyhemoglobin, the terminal carboxylate group of 146 forms a salt bridge with a lysine residue in the  subunit
of the other  dimer. This interaction locks the side chain of histidine 146
in a position where it can participate in a salt bridge with negatively charged
aspartate 94 in the same chain, provided that the imidazole group of the histidine residue is protonated (Figure 10.26). At high pH, the side chain of
histidine 146 is not protonated and the salt bridge does not form. As the
pH drops, however, the side chain of histidine 146 becomes protonated, the

here, three amino acid residues form two

structure. The formation of one of the
salt bridges depends on the presence
of an added proton on histidine 146.

salt bridge with aspartate 94 forms, and the quaternary structure characteristic of deoxyhemoglobin is stabilized, leading to a greater tendency for
oxygen to be released at actively metabolizing tissues. No significant change
takes place in oxyhemoglobin over the same pH range.
Carbon dioxide also stabilizes deoxyhemoglobin by reacting with the
terminal amino groups to form carbamate groups, which are negatively
charged, in contrast with the neutral or positive charges on the free amino
groups. The amino termini lie at the interface between the  dimers, and
these negatively charged carbamate groups participate in salt-bridge interactions, characteristic of the T-state structure, which stabilize deoxyhemoglobin’s structure and favor the release of oxygen.
Hemoglobin with bound carbon dioxide and hydrogen ions is carried in
the blood back to the lungs, where it releases the hydrogen ions and carbon
dioxide and rebinds oxygen. Thus, hemoglobin helps to transport hydrogen ions and carbon dioxide in addition to transporting oxygen. However,
transport by hemoglobin accounts for only about 14% of the total transport
of these species; both hydrogen ions and carbon dioxide are also transported
in the blood as bicarbonate (HCO3) formed spontaneously or through
the action of carbonic anhydrase (Section 9.2), an abundant enzyme in red
blood cells.

10.3 ISOZYMES PROVIDE A MEANS OF REGULATION
SPECIFIC TO DISTINCT TISSUES AND DEVELOPMENTAL
STAGES
Isozymes or isoenzymes, are enzymes that differ in amino acid sequence yet
catalyze the same reaction. Usually, these enzymes display different kinetic
parameters, such as KM, or different regulatory properties. They are encoded by different genetic loci, which usually arise through gene duplication and divergence (Section 2.2.5). Isozymes differ from allozymes, which
are enzymes that arise from allelic variation at one gene locus. Isozymes can
often be distinguished from one another by biochemical properties such as
electrophoretic mobility.
The existence of isozymes permits the fine-tuning of metabolism to meet the
particular needs of a given tissue or developmental stage. Consider the example of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), an enzyme that functions in anaerobic glucose metabolism and glucose synthesis. Human beings have two
isozymic polypeptide chains for this enzyme: the H isozyme highly expressed in heart and the M isozyme found in skeletal muscle. The amino
acid sequences are 75% identical. The functional enzyme is tetrameric, and
many different combinations of the two subunits are possible. The H4
isozyme, found in the heart, has a higher affinity for substrates than does
the M4 isozyme. The two isozymes also differ in that high levels of pyruvate allosterically inhibit the H4 but not the M4 isozyme. The other combinations, such as H3M, have intermediate properties depending on the ratio of the two kinds of chains. We will consider these isozymes in their
biological context in Chapter 16.
The M4 isozyme functions optimally in an anaerobic environment,
whereas the H4 isozyme does so in an aerobic environment. Indeed,
the proportions of these isozymes are altered in the course of development
of the rat heart as the tissue switches from an anaerobic environment to an
aerobic one (Figure 10.27A). Figure 10.27B shows the tissue-specific forms
of lactate dehydrogenase in adult rat tissues. The appearance of some

isozymes in the blood is indicative of tissue damage and can be used for
clinical diagnosis. For instance, an increase in serum levels of H4 relative
to H3M is an indication that a myocardial infarction, or heart attack, has
occurred.

10.4 COVALENT MODIFICATION IS A MEANS
OF REGULATING ENZYME ACTIVITY
The covalent attachment of another molecule can modify the activity of enzymes and many other proteins. In these instances, a donor molecule provides a functional moiety that modifies the properties of the enzyme. Most
modifications are reversible. Phosphorylation and dephosphorylation are
the most common but not the only means of covalent modification. Histones—proteins that assist in the packaging of DNA into chromosomes as
well as in gene regulation—are rapidly acetylated and deacetylated in vivo
(Section 31.X.X). More heavily acetylated histones are associated with genes
that are being actively transcribed. The acetyltransferase and deacetylase
enzymes are themselves regulated by phosphorylation, showing that the covalent modification of histones may be controlled by the covalent modification of the modifying enzymes.
Modification is not readily reversible in some cases. Some proteins in
signal-transduction pathways, such as Ras and Src (a protein tyrosine kinase), are localized to the cytoplasmic face of the plasma membrane by the
irreversible attachment of a lipid group (Section 12.5.3). Fixed in this location, the proteins are better able to receive and transmit information that is
being passed along their signaling pathways (Chapter 15). The attachment
of ubiquitin, a protein comprising 72 amino acids, is a signal that a protein
is to be destroyed, the ultimate means of regulation (Chapter 23). Cyclin,
an important protein in cell-cycle regulation, must be ubiquitinated and destroyed before a cell can enter anaphase and proceed through the cell cycle
(Table 10.1).
Virtually all the metabolic processes that we will examine are regulated
in part by covalent modification. Indeed, the allosteric properties of many
enzymes are modified by covalent modification. Table 10.1 lists some of the
common covalent modifications.

10.4.1 Phosphorylation Is a Highly Effective Means
of Regulating the Activities of Target Proteins
The activities of many enzymes, membrane channels, and other target proteins are regulated by phosphorylation, the most prevalent reversible covalent modification. Indeed, we will see this regulatory mechanism in virtually every metabolic process in eukaryotic cells. The enzymes catalyzing
phosphorylation reactions are called protein kinases, which constitute one of
the largest protein families known, with more than 100 homologous enzymes in yeast and more than 550 in human beings. This multiplicity of
enzymes allows regulation to be fine-tuned according to a specific tissue,
time, or substrate.
The terminal () phosphoryl group of ATP is transferred to specific
serine and threonine residues by one class of protein kinases and to specific
tyrosine residues by another.

The acceptors in protein phosphorylation reactions are located inside cells,
where the phosphoryl-group donor ATP is abundant. Proteins that are
entirely extracellular are not regulated by reversible phosphorylation. Table

Orthophosphate
(Pi)

The unmodified hydroxyl-containing side chain is regenerated and orthophosphate (Pi) is produced.
It is important to note that phosphorylation and dephosphorylation are
not the reverse of one another; each is essentially irreversible under physiological conditions. Furthermore, both reactions take place at negligible
rates in the absence of enzymes. Thus, phosphorylation of a protein substrate will take place only through the action of a specific protein kinase and
at the expense of ATP cleavage, and dephosphorylation will result only
through the action of a phosphatase. The rate of cycling between the phosphorylated and the dephosphorylated states depends on the relative activities of kinases and phosphatases. Note that the net outcome of the two reactions is the hydrolysis of ATP to ADP and Pi, which has a G of
12 kcal mol1 (50 kJ mol1) under cellular conditions (Section 14.1.2).
This highly favorable free-energy change ensures that target proteins cycle
unidirectionally between unphosphorylated and phosphorylated forms.
Phosphorylation is a highly effective means of controlling the activity of
proteins for structural, thermodynamic, kinetic, and regulatory reasons:
1. A phosphoryl group adds two negative charges to a modified protein.
Electrostatic interactions in the unmodified protein can be disrupted and
new electrostatic interactions can be formed. Such structural changes can
markedly alter substrate binding and catalytic activity.

2. A phosphate group can form three or more hydrogen bonds. The tetrahedral geometry of the phosphoryl group makes these hydrogen bonds
highly directional, allowing for specific interactions with hydrogen-bond
donors.
3. The free energy of phosphorylation is large. Of the 12 kcal mol1
(50 kJ mol1) provided by ATP, about half is consumed in making phosphorylation irreversible; the other half is conserved in the phosphorylated
protein. Recall that a free-energy change of 1.36 kcal mol1 (5.69 kJ mol1)
corresponds to a factor of 10 in an equilibrium constant (Section 14.1.3).
Hence, phosphorylation can change the conformational equilibrium between different functional states by a large factor, of the order of 104.
4. Phosphorylation and dephosphorylation can take place in less than a second or over a span of hours. The kinetics can be adjusted to meet the timing needs of a physiological process.
5. Phosphorylation often evokes highly amplified effects. A single activated
kinase can phosphorylate hundreds of target proteins in a short interval.
Further amplification can take place because the target proteins may be
enzymes, each of which can then transform a large number of substrate
molecules.
6. ATP is the cellular energy currency (Chapter 14). The use of this compound as a phosphoryl group donor links the energy status of the cell to the
regulation of metabolism.
Protein kinases vary in their degree of specificity. Dedicated protein kinases phosphorylate a single protein or several closely related ones. Multifunctional protein kinases modify many different targets; they have a wide
reach and can coordinate diverse processes. Comparisons of amino acid sequences of many phosphorylation sites show that a multifunctional kinase
recognizes related sequences. For example, the consensus sequence recognized by protein kinase A is Arg-Arg-X-Ser-Z or Arg-Arg-X-Thr-Z, in
which X is a small residue, Z is a large hydrophobic one, and Ser or Thr is
the site of phosphorylation. It should be noted that this sequence is not
absolutely required. Lysine, for example, can substitute for one of the
arginine residues but with some loss of affinity. Short synthetic peptides
containing a consensus motif are nearly always phosphorylated by serinethreonine protein kinases. Thus, the primary determinant of specificity is the
amino acid sequence surrounding the serine or threonine phosphorylation site.
However, distant residues can contribute to specificity. For instance,
changes in protein conformation may alter the accessibility of a possible
phosphorylation site.

Cyclic adenosine monophosphate
(cAMP)

Protein kinases modulate the activity of many proteins, but what leads to
the activation of a kinase? Activation is often a multistep process initiated
by hormones (Chapter 15). In some cases, the hormones trigger the formation of cyclic AMP, a molecule formed by cyclization of ATP. Cyclic AMP
serves as an intracellular messenger in mediating the physiological actions
of hormones, as will be discussed in Chapter 15. The striking finding is that
most effects of cAMP in eukaryotic cells are achieved through the activation by
cAMP of a single protein kinase. This key enzyme is called protein kinase A or
PKA. The kinase alters the activities of target proteins by phosphorylating
specific serine or threonine residues. As we shall see, PKA provides a clear
example of the integration of allosteric regulation and phosphorylation.

PKA is activated by cAMP concentrations of the order of 10 nM. The
activation mechanism is reminiscent of that of aspartate transcarbamoylase.
Like that enzyme, PKA in muscle consists of two kinds of subunits: a
49-kd regulatory (R) subunit, which has high affinity for cAMP, and a
38-kd catalytic (C) subunit. In the absence of cAMP, the regulatory and catalytic subunits form an R2C2 complex that is enzymatically inactive (Figure
10.28). The binding of two molecules of cAMP to each of the regulatory
subunits leads to the dissociation of R2C2 into an R2 subunit and two C subunits. These free catalytic subunits are then enzymatically active. Thus, the
binding of cAMP to the regulatory subunit relieves its inhibition of the catalytic
subunit. PKA and most other kinases exist in isozymic forms for finetuning regulation to meet the needs of a specific cell or developmental stage.
How does the binding of cAMP activate the kinase? Each R chain contains the sequence Arg-Arg-Gly-Ala-Ile, which matches the consensus sequence for phosphorylation except for the presence of alanine in place of
serine. In the R2C2 complex, this pseudosubstrate sequence of R occupies the
catalytic site of C, thereby preventing the entry of protein substrates (see
Figure 10.28). The binding of cAMP to the R chains allosterically moves
the pseudosubstrate sequences out of the catalytic sites. The released C
chains are then free to bind and phosphorylate substrate proteins.
10.4.3 ATP and the Target Protein Bind to a Deep Cleft in the
Catalytic Subunit of Protein Kinase A
The three-dimensional structure of the catalytic subunit of PKA
containing a bound 20-residue peptide inhibitor was determined by
x-ray crystallography. The 350-residue catalytic subunit has two lobes
(Figure 10.29). ATP and part of the inhibitor fill a deep cleft between

the lobes. The smaller lobe makes many contacts with
ATP–Mg2, whereas the larger lobe binds peptide
and contributes the key catalytic residues. Like other
kinases (Section 16.1.1), the two lobes move closer to
one another on substrate binding; mechanisms for restricting this domain closure provides a means for regulating protein kinase activity. The PKA structure has
broad significance because residues 40 to 280 constitute a
conserved catalytic core that is common to essentially all
known protein kinases. We see here an example of a successful biochemical solution to the problem of protein
phosphorylation being employed many times in the
course of evolution.
The bound peptide in this crystal occupies the active
site because it contains the pseudosubstrate sequence
Arg-Arg-Asn-Ala-Ile (Figure 10.30). The structure of
the complex reveals the basis for the consensus sequence. The guanidinium group of the first arginine
residue forms an ion pair with the carboxylate side chain
of a glutamate residue (Glu 127) of the enzyme. The second arginine likewise interacts with two other carboxylates. The nonpolar side chain of isoleucine, which
matches Z in the consensus sequence, fits snugly in a
hydrophobic groove formed by two leucine residues of
the enzyme.

10.5 MANY ENZYMES ARE ACTIVATED BY SPECIFIC
PROTEOLYTIC CLEAVAGE
We turn now to a different mechanism of enzyme regulation. Many enzymes acquire full enzymatic activity as they spontaneously fold into their
characteristic three-dimensional forms. In contrast, other enzymes are synthesized as inactive precursors that are subsequently activated by cleavage
of one or a few specific peptide bonds. The inactive precursor is called a
zymogen (or a proenzyme). A energy source (ATP) is not needed for cleavage. Therefore, in contrast with reversible regulation by phosphorylation,
even proteins located outside cells can be activated by this means. Another
noteworthy difference is that proteolytic activation, in contrast with allosteric control and reversible covalent modification, occurs just once in the
life of an enzyme molecule.
Specific proteolysis is a common means of activating enzymes and other
proteins in biological systems. For example:
1. The digestive enzymes that hydrolyze proteins are synthesized as zymogens in the stomach and pancreas (Table 10.3).

2. Blood clotting is mediated by a cascade of proteolytic activations that ensures a rapid and amplified response to trauma.

Activation by Proteolytic Cleavage

3. Some protein hormones are synthesized as inactive precursors. For example, insulin is derived from proinsulin by proteolytic removal of a peptide.
4. The fibrous protein collagen, the major constituent of skin and bone, is
derived from procollagen, a soluble precursor.
5. Many developmental processes are controlled by the activation of zymogens. For example, in the metamorphosis of a tadpole into a frog, large
amounts of collagen are resorbed from the tail in the course of a few days.
Likewise, much collagen is broken down in a mammalian uterus after delivery. The conversion of procollagenase into collagenase, the active protease,
is precisely timed in these remodeling processes.

6. Programmed cell death, or apoptosis, is mediated by proteolytic enzymes
called caspases, which are synthesized in precursor form as procaspases.
When activated by various signals, caspases function to cause cell death in
most organisms, ranging from C. elegans (Section 2.4.3) to human beings.
Apoptosis provides a means sculpting the shapes of body parts in the course
of development and a means of eliminating cells producing anti-self antibodies or infected with pathogens as well as cells containing large amounts
of damaged DNA.

Zymogen
granule

We next examine the activation and control of zymogens, using as examples several digestive enzymes as well as blood-clot formation.
10.5.1 Chymotrypsinogen Is Activated by Specific Cleavage
of a Single Peptide Bond
Chymotrypsin is a digestive enzyme that hydrolyzes proteins in the small
intestine. Its mechanism of action was discussed in detail in Chapter 9. Its
inactive precursor, chymotrypsinogen, is synthesized in the pancreas, as are
several other zymogens and digestive enzymes. Indeed, the pancreas is one
of the most active organs in synthesizing and secreting proteins. The enzymes and zymogens are synthesized in the acinar cells of the pancreas and
stored inside membrane-bounded granules (Figure 10.31). The zymogen
granules accumulate at the apex of the acinar cell; when the cell is stimulated by a hormonal signal or a nerve impulse, the contents of the granules
are released into a duct leading into the duodenum.
Chymotrypsinogen, a single polypeptide chain consisting of 245 amino
acid residues, is virtually devoid of enzymatic activity. It is converted into
a fully active enzyme when the peptide bond joining arginine 15 and
isoleucine 16 is cleaved by trypsin (Figure 10.32). The resulting active enzyme, called -chymotrypsin, then acts on other -chymotrypsin molecules. Two dipeptides are removed to yield -chymotrypsin, the stable form
of the enzyme. The three resulting chains in -chymotrypsin remain linked
to one another by two interchain disulfide bonds. The striking feature of
this activation process is that cleavage of a single specific peptide bond transforms the protein from a catalytically inactive form into one that is fully active.
10.5.2 Proteolytic Activation of Chymotrypsinogen Leads
to the Formation of a Substrate-Binding Site
How does cleavage of a single peptide bond activate the zymogen? Key conformational changes, which were revealed by the elucidation of the threedimensional structure of chymotrypsinogen, result from the cleavage of the
peptide bond between amino acids 15 and 16.

1. The newly formed amino-terminal group of isoleucine 16 turns inward and
forms an ionic bond with aspartate 194 in the interior of the chymotrypsin
molecule (Figure 10.33). Protonation of this amino group stabilizes the active form of chymotrypsin.

interaction between the carboxylate of
aspartate 194 and the -amino group of
isoleucine 16, essential for the structure
of active chymotrypsin, is possible only
in chymotrypsin.

2. This electrostatic interaction triggers a number of conformational
changes. Methionine 192 moves from a deeply buried position in the zymogen to the surface of the active enzyme, and residues 187 and 193 become more extended. These changes result in the formation of the substratespecificity site for aromatic and bulky nonpolar groups. One side of this site
is made up of residues 189 through 192. This cavity for binding part of the
substrate is not fully formed in the zymogen.
3. The tetrahedral transition state in catalysis by chymotrypsin is stabilized
by hydrogen bonds between the negatively charged carbonyl oxygen atom
of the substrate and two NH groups of the main chain of the enzyme (Section 9.1.3). One of these NH groups is not appropriately located in chymotrypsinogen, and so the oxyanion hole is incomplete in the zymogen.
4. The conformational changes elsewhere in the molecule are very small.
Thus, the switching on of enzymatic activity in a protein can be accomplished
by discrete, highly localized conformational changes that are triggered by the
hydrolysis of a single peptide bond.
10.5.3 The Generation of Trypsin from Tryspinogen Leads
to the Activation of Other Zymogens
The structural changes accompanying the activation of trypsinogen, the
precursor of the proteolytic enzyme trypsin, are somewhat different from
those in the activation of chymotrypsinogen. X-ray analyses have shown
that the conformation of four stretches of polypeptide, constituting about
15% of the molecule, changes markedly on activation. These regions, called
the activation domain, are very flexible in the zymogen, whereas they have a
well-defined conformation in trypsin. Furthermore, the oxyanion hole (Section 9.1.3) in trypsinogen is too far from histidine 57 to promote the formation of the tetrahedral transition state.
The digestion of proteins in the duodenum requires the concurrent action of several proteolytic enzymes, because each is specific for a limited
number of side chains. Thus, the zymogens must be switched on at the same

time. Coordinated control is achieved by the action of trypsin as the common activator of all the pancreatic zymogens—trypsinogen, chymotrypsinogen, proelastase, procarboxypeptidase, and prolipase, a lipid degrading enzyme. To produce active trypsin, the cells that line the duodenum secrete
an enzyme, enteropeptidase, that hydrolyzes a unique lysine–isoleucine peptide bond in trypsinogen as the zymogen enters the duodenum from the
pancreas. The small amount of trypsin produced in this way activates more
trypsinogen and the other zymogens (Figure 10.34). Thus, the formation of
trypsin by enteropeptidase is the master activation step.
10.5.4 Some Proteolytic Enzymes Have Specific Inhibitors
The conversion of a zymogen into a protease by cleavage of a single peptide
bond is a precise means of switching on enzymatic activity. However, this
activation step is irreversible, and so a different mechanism is needed to stop
proteolysis. Specific protease inhibitors accomplish this task. For example,
pancreatic trypsin inhibitor, a 6-kd protein, inhibits
trypsin by binding very tightly to its active site. The dissociation constant of the complex is 0.1 pM, which corresponds to a standard free energy of binding of about
18 kcal mol1 (75 kJ mol1). In contrast with nearly
all known protein assemblies, this complex is not dissociated into its constituent chains by treatment with denaturing agents such as 8 M urea or 6 M guanidine hyLys 15
drochloride.
The reason for the exceptional stability of the complex is that pancreatic trypsin inhibitor is a very effective
Asp 189
substrate analog. X-ray analyses showed that the inhibitor lies in the active site of the enzyme, positioned
such that the side chain of lysine 15 of this inhibitor interacts with the aspartate side chain in the specificity
pocket of trypsin. In addition, there are many hydrogen
bonds between the main chain of trypsin and that of its
inhibitor. Furthermore, the carbonyl group of lysine 15

peptide bond between lysine 15 and alanine 16 in pancreatic trypsin inhibitor is cleaved but at a very slow rate: the half-life of the trypsin–inhibitor
complex is several months. In essence, the inhibitor is a substrate, but its
intrinsic structure is so nicely complementary to the enzyme’s active site
that it binds very tightly and is turned over slowly.
Why does trypsin inhibitor exist? Indeed, the amount of trypsin is
much greater that that of the inhibitor. Under what circumstances is
it beneficial to inhibit trypsin? Recall that trypsin activates other zymogens.
Consequently, it is vital that even small amounts of trypsin be prevented
from initiating the cascade prematurely. Trypsin molecules activated in the
pancreas or pancreatic ducts could severely damage those tissues, leading
to acute pancreatitis. Tissue necrosis may result from the activation of proteolytic enzymes (as well as prolipases) by trypsin, and hemorrhaging may
result from its activation of elastase. We see here the physiological need for
the tight binding of the inhibitor to trypsin.
Pancreatic trypsin inhibitor is not the only important protease inhibitor.
1-Antitrypsin (also called 1-antiproteinase), a 53-kd plasma protein, protects tissues from digestion by elastase, a secretory product of neutrophils
(white blood cells that engulf bacteria). Antielastase would be a more accurate name for this inhibitor, because it blocks elastase much more effectively
than it blocks trypsin. Like pancreatic trypsin inhibitor, 1-antitrypsin
blocks the action of target enzymes by binding nearly irreversibly to their
active sites. Genetic disorders leading to a deficiency of 1-antitrypsin show
that this inhibitor is physiologically important. For example, the substitution of lysine for glutamate at residue 53 in the type Z mutant slows the secretion of this inhibitor from liver cells. Serum levels of the inhibitor are
about 15% of normal in people homozygous for this defect. The consequence
is that excess elastase destroys alveolar walls in the lungs by digesting elastic fibers and other connective-tissue proteins.
The resulting clinical condition is called emphysema (also known as destructive lung disease). People with emphysema must breathe much harder
than normal people to exchange the same volume of air, because their alveoli are much less resilient than normal. Cigarette smoking markedly increases the likelihood that even a type Z heterozygote will develop emphysema. The reason is that smoke oxidizes methionine 358 of the inhibitor
(Figure 10.36), a residue essential for binding elastase. Indeed, this methionine side chain is the bait that selectively traps elastase. The methionine
sulfoxide oxidation product, in contrast, does not lure elastase, a striking
consequence of the insertion of just one oxygen atom into a protein. We will
consider another protease inhibitor, antithrombin III, when we examine the
control of blood clotting.
10.5.5 Blood Clotting Is Accomplished by a Cascade
of Zymogen Activations
Enzymatic cascades are often employed in biochemical systems to achieve a
rapid response. In a cascade, an initial signal institutes a series of steps, each
of which is catalyzed by an enzyme. At each step, the signal is amplified.
For instance, if a signal molecule activates an enzyme that in turn activates
10 enzymes and each of the 10 enzymes in turn activates 10 additional enzymes, after four steps the original signal will have been amplified 10,000fold. Blood clots are formed by a cascade of zymogen activations: the activated form of one clotting factor catalyzes the activation of the next (Figure
10.37). Thus, very small amounts of the initial factors suffice to trigger the
cascade, ensuring a rapid response to trauma.

FIGURE 10.37 Blood-clotting cascade. A fibrin clot is formed by the interplay of the
intrinsic, extrinsic, and final common pathways. The intrinsic pathway begins with the
activation of factor XII (Hageman factor) by contact with abnormal surfaces produced by
injury. The extrinsic pathway is triggered by trauma, which activates factor VII and releases a
lipoprotein, called tissue factor, from blood vessels. Inactive forms of clotting factors are
shown in red; their activated counterparts (indicated by the subscript “a”) are in yellow.
Stimulatory proteins that are not themselves enzymes are shown in blue. A striking feature
of this process is that the activated form of one clotting factor catalyzes the activation of the
next factor.

There are two means of initiating clotting: the intrinsic and extrinsic
pathways. The intrinsic clotting pathway is activated by exposure of anionic
surfaces on rupture of the endothelial lining of the blood vessels. These
surfaces serve as binding sites for factors in the clotting cascade. Substances that are released from tissues as a consequence of trauma to them
trigger the extrinsic clotting pathway. The extrinsic and intrinsic pathways
converge on a common sequence of final steps to form a clot composed
of the protein fibrin. The two pathways interact with each other in vivo.
Indeed, both are needed for proper clotting, as evidenced by clotting disorders caused by a deficiency of a single protein in one of the pathways.
Note that the active forms of the clotting factors are designated with a subscript “a.”
10.5.6 Fibrinogen Is Converted by Thrombin into a Fibrin Clot
The best-characterized part of the clotting process is the final step in the
cascade: the conversion of fibrinogen into fibrin by thrombin, a proteolytic
enzyme. Fibrinogen is made up of three globular units connected by two

A, B, and . The rod regions are triple-stranded -helical coiled coils, a
recurring motif in proteins. Thrombin cleaves four arginine–glycine peptide
bonds in the central globular region of fibrinogen. On cleavage, an A peptide of 18 residues from each of the two A chains and a B peptide of 20
residues from each of the two B chains are released from the globular region. These A and B peptides are called fibrinopeptides. A fibrinogen molecule devoid of these fibrinopeptides is called a fibrin monomer and has the
subunit structure ()2.
Fibrin monomers spontaneously assemble into ordered fibrous arrays
called fibrin. Electron micrographs and low-angle x-ray patterns show that
fibrin has a periodic structure that repeats every 23 nm (Figure 10.39).

 chains, respectively, on thrombin cleavage. The knobs of the  subunits
fit into the holes on the  subunits of another monomer to form a protofibril. This protofibril is extended when the knobs of the  subunits fit into
holes of  subunits of other protofibrils. Thus, analogous to the activation
of chymotrypsinogen, peptide-bond cleavage exposes new amino termini
that can participate in specific interactions. The newly formed clot is stabilized by the formation of amide bonds between the side chains of lysine and
glutamine residues in different monomers.

12.5.7 Prothrombin Is Readied for Activation by a Vitamin
K-Dependent Modification
Thrombin is synthesized as a zymogen called prothrombin, which comprises
four major domains, with the serine protease domain at its carboxyl terminus. The first domain is called a gla domain, whereas domains 2 and 3 are
called kringle domains (Figure 10.41). These domains work in concert to keep
prothrombin in an inactive form and to target it to appropriate sites for its
activation by factor Xa (a serine protease) and factor Va (a stimulatory protein). Activation is accomplished by proteolytic cleavage of the bond between arginine 274 and threonine 275 to release a fragment containing the
first three domains and by cleavage of the bond between arginine 323 and
isoleucine 324 (analogous to the key bond in chymotrypsinogen) to yield active thrombin.

used clinically as an anticoagulant to prevent thromboses in patients prone
to clot formation. Dicoumarol and such related vitamin K antagonists as
warfarin also serve as effective rat poisons. Cows fed dicoumarol synthesize
an abnormal prothrombin that does not bind Ca2, in contrast with normal
prothrombin. This difference was puzzling for some time because abnormal prothrombin has the same number of amino acid residues and gives the
same amino acid analysis after acid hydrolysis as does normal prothrombin.
Nuclear magnetic resonance studies revealed that

thrombin are carboxylated to -carboxyglutamate
-Carboxyglutamate residue
by a vitamin K-dependent enzyme system (Figure
10.43). The vitamin K-dependent carboxylation reaction converts glutamate,
a weak chelator of Ca2, into -carboxyglutamate, a much stronger chelator.
Prothrombin is thus able to bind Ca2, but what is the effect of this binding? The binding of Ca2 by prothrombin anchors the zymogen to phospholipid membranes derived from blood platelets after injury. The binding
of prothrombin to phospholipid surfaces is crucial because it brings prothrombin into close proximity to two clotting proteins that catalyze its conversion into thrombin. The proteolytic activation of prothrombin removes
the calcium-binding domain and frees thrombin from the membrane so that
it can cleave fibrinogen and other targets.
10.5.8 Hemophilia Revealed an Early Step in Clotting

An account of a hemorrhagic
disposition existing in certain families—
“About seventy or eighty years ago, a
woman by the name of Smith settled
in the vicinity of Plymouth, New Hampshire, and transmitted the following
idiosyncrasy to her descendants. It is
one, she observed, to which her family
is unfortunately subject and has been
the source not only of great solicitude,
but frequently the cause of death. If
the least scratch is made on the skin of
some of them, as mortal a hemorrhage
will eventually ensue as if the largest
wound is inflicted…. It is a surprising
circumstance that the males only are
subject to this strange affection, and
that all of them are not liable to it….
Although the females are exempt, they
are still capable of transmitting it to
their male children.”
JOHN OTTO (1803)

Some important breakthroughs in the elucidation of clotting path
ways have come from studies of patients with bleeding disorders.
Classic hemophilia, or hemophilia A, the best-known clotting defect, is genetically transmitted as a sex-linked recessive characteristic. In classic hemophilia, factor VIII (antihemophilic factor) of the intrinsic pathway is missing or has markedly reduced activity. Although factor VIII is not itself a
protease, it markedly stimulates the activation of factor X, the final protease
of the intrinsic pathway, by factor IXa, a serine protease (Figure 10.44).
Thus, activation of the intrinsic pathway is severely impaired in hemophilia.
FIGURE 10.44 Action of antihemophilic factor.

Proteolysis

Xa

Antihemophilic factor (VIII) stimulates the activation of factor
X by factor IXa. It is interesting to note that the activity of
factor VIII is markedly increased by limited proteolysis by
thrombin and factor Xa. This positive feedback amplifies the
clotting signal and accelerates clot formation after a threshold
has been reached.

In the past, hemophiliacs were treated with transfusions of a concentrated plasma fraction containing factor VIII. This therapy carried the risk
of infection. Indeed, many hemophiliacs contracted hepatitis and AIDS. A
safer preparation of factor VIII was urgently needed. With the use of biochemical purification and recombinant DNA techniques, the gene for factor VIII was isolated and expressed in cells grown in culture. Recombinant
factor VIII purified from these cells has largely replaced plasma concentrates in treating hemophilia.

10.5.9 The Clotting Process Must Be Precisely Regulated
There is a fine line between hemorrhage and thrombosis. Clots must
form rapidly yet remain confined to the area of injury. What are the
mechanisms that normally limit clot formation to the site of injury? The lability of clotting factors contributes significantly to the control of clotting. Activated factors are short-lived because they are diluted by blood flow, removed
by the liver, and degraded by proteases. For example, the stimulatory proteins factors Va and VIIIa are digested by protein C, a protease that is switched
on by the action of thrombin. Thus, thrombin has a dual function: it catalyzes
the formation of fibrin and it initiates the deactivation of the clotting cascade.
Specific inhibitors of clotting factors are also critical in the termination
of clotting. The most important one is antithrombin III, a plasma protein
that inactivates thrombin by forming an irreversible complex with it. Antithrombin III resembles 1-antitrypsin except that it inhibits thrombin
much more strongly than it inhibits elastase. Antithrombin III also blocks
other serine proteases in the clotting cascade—namely, factors XIIa, XIa, IXa,
and Xa. The inhibitory action of antithrombin III is enhanced by heparin, a
negatively charged polysaccharide found in mast cells near the walls of blood
vessels and on the surfaces of endothelial cells (Figure 10.45). Heparin acts
as an anticoagulant by increasing the rate of formation of irreversible complexes between antithrombin III and the serine protease clotting factors. Antitrypsin and antithrombin are serpins, a family of serine protease inhibitors.
The importance of the ratio of thrombin to antithrombin is illustrated
in the case in which a 14-year-old boy died of a bleeding disorder because
of a mutation in his 1-antitrypsin, which normally inhibits elastase (Section
10.5.4). Methionine 358 in 1-antitrypsin’s binding pocket for elastase was
replaced by arginine, resulting in a change in specificity from an elastase inhibitor to a thrombin inhibitor. 1-Antitrypsin activity normally increases
markedly after injury to counteract excess elastase arising from stimulated
neutrophils. The mutant 1-antitrypsin caused the patient’s thrombin activity to drop to such a low level that hemorrhage ensued. We see here a
striking example of how a change of a single residue in a protein can dramatically alter specificity and an example of the critical importance of having the
right amount of a protease inhibitor.
Antithrombin limits the extent of clot formation, but what happens to the
clots themselves? Clots are not permanent structures but are designed to be
dissolved when the structural integrity of damaged areas is restored. Fibrin is
split by plasmin, a serine protease that hydrolyzes peptide bonds in the coiledcoil regions. Plasmin molecules can diffuse through aqueous channels in the
porous fibrin clot to cut the accessible connector rods. Plasmin is formed by
proteolytic activation of plasminogen, an inactive precursor that has a high
affinity for the fibrin clots. This conversion is carried out by tissue-type plasminogen activator (TPA), a 72-kd protein that has a domain structure closely
related to that of prothrombin (Figure 10.46).

However, a domain that targets TPA to fibrin clots replaces the membranetargeting gla domain of prothrombin. The TPA bound to fibrin clots swiftly
activates adhering plasminogen. In contrast, TPA activates free plasminogen
very slowly. The gene for TPA has been cloned and expressed in cultured mammalian cells. The results of clinical studies have shown that TPA administered
intravenously within an hour of the formation of a blood clot in a coronary artery markedly increases the likelihood of surviving a heart attack (Figure 10.47).

• Aspartate Transcarbamoylase Is Allosterically Inhibited by the End
Product of Its Pathway

Allosteric proteins constitute an important class of proteins whose biological activity can be regulated. Specific regulatory molecules can modulate the activity of allosteric proteins by binding to distinct regulatory
sites, separate from the functional site. These proteins have multiple
functional sites, which display cooperation as evidenced by a sigmoidal
dependence of function on substrate concentration. Aspartate transcarbamoylase (ATCase), one of the best-understood allosteric enzymes,
catalyzes the synthesis of N-carbamoylaspartate, the first intermediate
in the synthesis of pyrimidines. ATCase is feedback inhibited by cytidine triphosphate(CTP), the final product of the pathway. ATP reverses this inhibition. ATCase consists of separable catalytic (c3) subunits (which bind the substrates) and regulatory (r2) subunits (which
bind CTP and ATP). The inhibitory effect of CTP, the stimulatory action of ATP, and the cooperative binding of substrates are mediated by
large changes in quaternary structure. On binding substrates, the c3
subunits of the c6r6 enzyme move apart and reorient themselves. This
allosteric transition is highly concerted, as postulated by the MonodWyman-Changeux (MWC) model. All subunits of an ATCase molecule simultaneously interconvert from the T (low-affinity) to the R
(high-affinity) state.

•

Hemoglobin Transports Oxygen Efficiently by Binding Oxygen
Cooperatively

Hemoglobin, the oxygen carrier in the blood, is an allosteric protein.
Hemoglobin consists of four polypeptide chains, each with a heme
group—a substituted porphyrin with a central iron. Hemoglobin A, the
predominant hemoglobin in adults, has the subunit structure 22. Hemoglobin transports H and CO2 in addition to O2. Hemoglobin exhibits three kinds of allosteric effects. First, the oxygen-binding curve
of hemoglobin is sigmoidal, which indicates that the binding of oxygen
is cooperative. The binding of oxygen to one heme group facilitates the
binding of oxygen to the other heme groups in the same molecule. Second, the binding of H and CO2 promotes the release of O2 from hemoglobin, an effect that is physiologically important in enhancing the
release of O2 in metabolically active tissues such as muscle. These allosteric linkages between the binding of H, CO2, and O2 are known
as the Bohr effect. Third, the affinity of hemoglobin for O2 is further
regulated by 2,3-bisphosphoglycerate (2,3-BPG), a small molecule with
a very high density of negative charge. 2,3-Bisphosphoglycerate binds
tightly to deoxyhemoglobin but not to oxyhemoglobin. Hence, 2,3BPG lowers the oxygen affinity of hemoglobin. Fetal hemoglobin (22)
has a higher oxygen affinity than human adult hemoglobin because fetal hemoglobin binds 2,3-BPG less tightly. Neither the sequential nor
the concerted model completely describes the allosteric behavior of hemoglobin. Rather, the behavior of hemoglobin is best described by a
combined model that employs features of both models.

Isozymes Provide a Means of Regulation Specific to Distinct Tissues and
Developmental Stages

Isozymes differ in structural characteristics but catalyze the same reaction. They provide a means of fine-tuning metabolism to meet the needs
of a given tissue or developmental stage. The results of gene-duplication
events provide the means for subtle regulation of enzyme function.

• Covalent Modification Is a Means of Regulating Enzyme Activity

Covalent modification of proteins is a potent means of controlling the
activity of enzymes and other proteins. Phosphorylation is the most
common type of reversible covalent modification. Signals can be highly
amplified by phosphorylation because a single kinase can act on many
target molecules. The regulatory actions of protein kinases are reversed
by protein phosphatases, which catalyze the hydrolysis of attached
phosphoryl groups.
Cyclic AMP serves as an intracellular messenger in the transduction
of many hormonal and sensory stimuli. Cyclic AMP switches on protein kinase A (PKA), a major multifunctional kinase, by binding to the
regulatory subunit of the enzyme, thereby releasing the active catalytic
subunits of PKA. In the absence of cAMP, the catalytic sites of PKA
are occupied by pseudosubstrate sequences of the regulatory subunit.

Selected Readings

• Many Enzymes Are Activated by Specific Proteolytic Cleavage

The activation of an enzyme by proteolytic cleavage of one or a few peptide bonds is a recurring control mechanism seen in processes as diverse
as the activation of digestive enzymes and blood clotting. The inactive
precursor is called a zymogen (or a proenzyme). Trypsinogen is activated by enteropeptidase or trypsin, and trypsin then activates a host
of other zymogens, leading to the digestion of foodstuffs. For instance,
trypsin converts chymotrypsinogen, a zymogen, into active chymotrypsin by hydrolyzing a single peptide bond.
A striking feature of the clotting process is that it is accomplished
by a cascade of zymogen conversions, in which the activated form of
one clotting factor catalyzes the activation of the next precursor. Many
of the activated clotting factors are serine proteases. In the final step of
clot formation, fibrinogen, a highly soluble molecule in the plasma, is
converted by thrombin into fibrin by the hydrolysis of four arginine–glycine bonds. The resulting fibrin monomer spontaneously
forms long, insoluble fibers called fibrin. Zymogen activation is also essential in the lysis of clots. Plasminogen is converted into plasmin, a serine protease that cleaves fibrin, by tissue-type plasminogen activator
(TPA). Although zymogen activation is irreversible, specific inhibitors
of some proteases exert control. The irreversible protein inhibitor antithrombin III holds blood clotting in check in the clotting cascade.

PROBLEMS
1. Activity profile. A histidine residue in the active site of aspartate transcarbamoylase is thought to be important in stabilizing the transition state of the bound substrates. Predict the pH
dependence of the catalytic rate, assuming that this interaction
is essential and dominates the pH-activity profile of the enzyme.

6. R versus T. An allosteric enzyme that follows the concerted
mechanism has a T/R ratio of 300 in the absence of substrate.
Suppose that a mutation reversed the ratio. How would this mutation affect the relation between the rate of the reaction and substrate concentration?

2. Allosteric switching. A substrate binds 100 times as tightly
to the R state of an allosteric enzyme as to its T state. Assume
that the concerted (MWC) model applies to this enzyme.

7. Tuning oxygen affinity.What is the effect of each of the following treatments on the oxygen affinity of hemoglobin A in vitro?

(a) By what factor does the binding of one substrate molecule
per enzyme molecule alter the ratio of the concentrations of enzyme molecules in the R and T states?
(b) Suppose that L, the ratio of [T] to [R] in the absence of substrate, is 107 and that the enzyme contains four binding sites for
substrate. What is the ratio of enzyme molecules in the R state
to that in the T state in the presence of saturating amounts of
substrate, assuming that the concerted model is obeyed?
3. Allosteric transition. Consider an allosteric protein that obeys
the concerted model. Suppose that the ratio of T to R formed in
the absence of ligand is 105, KT  2 mM, and KR  5 M. The
protein contains four binding sites for ligand. What is the fraction
of molecules in the R form when 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 ligands are bound?
4. Negative cooperativity. You have isolated a dimeric enzyme
that contains two identical active sites. The binding of substrate
to one active site decreases the substrate affinity of the other active site. Which allosteric model best accounts for this negative
cooperativity?

Reaction rate
(percentage of maximal rate)

5. Paradoxical at first glance. Recall that phosphonacetyl-L-aspartate (PALA) is a potent inhibitor of ATCase because it mimics the two physiological substrates. However, low concentrations of this unreactive bisubstrate analog increase the reaction
velocity. On the addition of PALA, the reaction rate increases
until an average of three molecules of PALA are bound per molecule of enzyme. This maximal velocity is 17-fold as great as it
is in the absence of PALA. The reaction rate then decreases to
nearly zero on the addition of three more molecules of PALA
per molecule of enzyme. Why do low concentrations of PALA
activate ATCase?
100

8. Avian and reptilian counterparts. The erythrocytes of birds
and turtles contain a regulatory molecule different from 2,3BPG. This substance is also effective in reducing the oxygen
affinity of human hemoglobin stripped of 2,3-BPG. Which of
the following substances would you predict to be most effective
in this regard?
(a) Glucose 6-phosphate
(b) Inositol hexaphosphate
(c) HPO42

(d) Malonate
(e) Arginine
(f) Lactate

9. Tuning proton affinity. The pK of an acid depends partly on
its environment. Predict the effect of the following environmental changes on the pK of a glutamic acid side chain.
(a) A lysine side chain is brought into close proximity.
(b) The terminal carboxyl group of the protein is brought into
close proximity.
(c) The glutamic acid side chain is shifted from the outside of
the protein to a nonpolar site inside.
10. Zymogen activation. When very low concentrations of
pepsinogen are added to acidic media, how does the half-time
for activation depend on zymogen concentration?
11. A revealing assay. Suppose that you have just examined a
young boy with a bleeding disorder highly suggestive of classic
hemophilia (factor VIII deficiency). Because of the late hour, the
laboratory that carries out specialized coagulation assays is
closed. However, you happen to have a sample of blood from a
classic hemophiliac whom you admitted to the hospital an hour
earlier. What is the simplest and most rapid test that you can
perform to determine whether your present patient also is deficient in factor VIII activity?
12. Counterpoint. The synthesis of factor X, like that of prothrombin, requires vitamin K. Factor X also contains -carboxyglutamate residues in its amino-terminal region. However,
activated factor X, in contrast with thrombin, retains this region
of the molecule. What is a likely functional consequence of this
difference between the two activated species?

(a) Increase in pH from 7.2 to 7.4.
(b) Increase in pCO2 from 10 to 40 torr.

17. Reporting live from ATCase. ATCase was reacted with
nitromethane to form a colored nitrotyrosine group ( max 
430 nm) in each of its catalytic chains. The absorption by this
reporter group depends on its immediate environment. An essential lysine residue at each catalytic site also was modified to
block the binding of substrate. Catalytic trimers from this doubly modified enzyme were then combined with native trimers to
form a hybrid enzyme. The absorption by the nitrotyrosine group
was measured on addition of the substrate analog succinate.
What is the significance of the alteration in the absorbance at
430 nm?
Absorbance change (%)

18. Reporting live from ATCase 2. A different ATCase hybrid
was constructed to test the effects of allosteric activators and inhibitors. Normal regulatory subunits were combined with nitrotyrosine-containing catalytic subunits. The addition of ATP
in the absence of substrate increased the absorbance at 430 nm,
the same change elicited by the addition of succinate (see the
graph in Problem 17). Conversely, CTP in the absence of substrate decreased the absorbance at 430 nm. What is the significance of the changes in absorption of the reporter groups?.

this change. However, the valine side chain of hemoglobin S interacts with a complementary sticky patch (formed by phenylalanine 85 and leucine 88) on another hemoglobin molecule—a patch that is exposed in deoxygenated but not in
oxygenated hemoglobin. What is the chemical basis for the interaction between the hemoglobin molecules? What would be
the effect of this interaction?

enzyme from two different species and find that one is a tetramer
(n  4) and the other a hexamer (n  6). All other things being
equal, which would you expect would show the greater cooperativity? (b) To your surprise, both enzymes show similar cooperativity. Explain how differences in the MWC parameter c
could explain this. (Hint: Make sure you do the exercise in Section 4 of the Conceptual Insights module on cooperative binding and kinetics.)

CHAPTER 11

Carbohydrates

Carbohydrates in food are important sources of energy. Starch, found in plantderived food such as pasta, consists of chains of linked glucose molecules. These
chains are broken down into individual glucose molecules for eventual use in
generation of ATP and building blocks for other molecules. [(Left) Superstock.]

Let us take an overview of carbohydrates, one of the four major classes of
biomolecules along with proteins, nucleic acids, and lipids. Carbohydrates
are aldehyde or ketone compounds with multiple hydroxyl groups. They
make up most of the organic matter on Earth because of their extensive roles
in all forms of life. First, carbohydrates serve as energy stores, fuels, and
metabolic intermediates. Second, ribose and deoxyribose sugars form part of
the structural framework of RNA and DNA. Third, polysaccharides are
structural elements in the cell walls of bacteria and plants. In fact, cellulose,
the main constituent of plant cell walls, is one of the most
abundant organic compounds in the biosphere. Fourth,
carbohydrates are linked to many proteins and lipids, where

11.1 MONOSACCHARIDES ARE ALDEHYDES OR KETONES
WITH MULTIPLE HYDROXYL GROUPS
Monosaccharides, the simplest carbohydrates, are aldehydes or ketones that
have two or more hydroxyl groups; the empirical formula of many is
(C–H2O)n, literally a “carbon hydrate.” Monosaccharides are important
fuel molecules as well as building blocks for nucleic acids. The smallest monosaccharides, for which n ⫽ 3, are dihydroxyacetone and D- and
L-glyceraldehyde.

They are referred to as trioses (tri- for 3). Dihydroxyacetone is called a
ketose because it contains a keto group, whereas glyceraldehyde is called an
aldose because it contains an aldehyde group. Glyceraldehyde has a single asymmetric carbon and, thus, there are two stereoisomers of this sugar.
D-Glyceraldehyde and L-glyceraldehyde are enantiomers, or mirror images
of each other. As mentioned in Chapter 3, the prefixes D and L designate
the absolute configuration. Monosaccharides and other sugars will often be
represented in this book by Fischer projections (Figure 11.1). Recall that, in
a Fischer projection of a molecule, atoms joined to an asymmetric carbon
atom by horizontal bonds are in front of the plane of the page, and those
joined by vertical bonds are behind (see the Appendix in Chapter 1).
Fischer projections are useful for depicting carbohydrate structures because they provide clear and simple views of the stereochemistry at
each carbon center.

Simple monosaccharides with four, five, six, and seven carbon atoms are
called tetroses, pentoses, hexoses, and heptoses, respectively. Because these
molecules have multiple asymmetric carbons, they exist as diastereoisomers,
isomers that are not mirror images of each other, as well as enantiomers. In
regard to these monosaccharides, the symbols D and L designate the ab-

solute configuration of the asymmetric carbon farthest from the aldehyde
or keto group. Figure 11.2 shows the common D-aldose sugars. D-Ribose,
the carbohydrate component of RNA, is a five-carbon aldose. D-Glucose,
D-mannose, and D-galactose are abundant six-carbon aldoses. Note that
D-glucose and D-mannose differ in configuration only at C-2. Sugars differing in configuration at a single asymmetric center are called epimers.
Thus, D-glucose and D-mannose are epimeric at C-2; D-glucose and
D-galactose are epimeric at C-4.
Dihydroxyacetone is the simplest ketose. The stereochemical relation
between D-ketoses containing as many as six carbon atoms are shown in
Figure 11.3. Note that ketoses have one fewer asymmetric center than do
aldoses with the same number of carbons. D-Fructose is the most abundant
ketohexose.

The predominant forms of ribose, glucose, fructose, and many other sugars in solution are not open chains. Rather, the open-chain forms of these
sugars cyclize into rings. In general, an aldehyde can react with an alcohol

For an aldohexose such as glucose, the C-1 aldehyde in the open-chain form
of glucose reacts with the C-5 hydroxyl group to form an intramolecular

pyranose because of its similarity to pyran (Figure 11.4). Similarly, a ketone
can react with an alcohol to form a hemiketal.

The depictions of glucopyranose and fructofuranose shown in Figures
11.4 and 11.5 are Haworth projections. In such projections, the carbon atoms
in the ring are not explicitly shown. The approximate plane of the ring is
perpendicular to the plane of the paper, with the heavy line on the ring projecting toward the reader. Like Fischer projections, Haworth projections allow easy depiction of the stereochemistry of sugars. We will return to a more
structurally realistic view of the conformations of cyclic monosaccharides
shortly.
An additional asymmetric center is created when a cyclic hemiacetal is
formed. In glucose, C-1, the carbonyl carbon atom in the open-chain form,
becomes an asymmetric center. Thus, two ring structures can be formed:
-D-glucopyranose and -D-glucopyranose (see Figure 11.4). For D sugars
drawn as Haworth projections, the designation  means that the hydroxyl
group attached to C-1 is below the plane of the ring;  means that it is above
the plane of the ring. The C-1 carbon atom is called the anomeric carbon
atom, and the  and  forms are called anomers. An equilibrium mixture of
glucose contains approximately one-third  anomer, two-thirds  anomer,
and ⬍1% of the open-chain form.
The same nomenclature applies to the furanose ring form of fructose,
except that  and  refer to the hydroxyl groups attached to C-2, the
anomeric carbon atom (see Figure 11.5). Fructose forms both pyranose and
furanose rings. The pyranose form predominates in fructose free in solution, and the furanose form predominates in many fructose derivatives
(Figure 11.6). Pentoses such as D-ribose and 2-deoxy-D-ribose form furanose rings, as we have seen in the structure of these units in RNA and DNA.

11.1.2 Conformation of Pyranose and Furanose Rings
The six-membered pyranose ring is not planar, because of the tetrahedral
geometry of its saturated carbon atoms. Instead, pyranose rings adopt two
classes of conformations, termed chair and boat because of the resemblance
to these objects (Figure 11.7). In the chair form, the substituents on the ring
carbon atoms have two orientations: axial and equatorial. Axial bonds are
nearly perpendicular to the average plane of the ring, whereas equatorial
bonds are nearly parallel to this plane. Axial substituents sterically hinder
each other if they emerge on the same side of the ring (e.g., 1,3-diaxial
groups). In contrast, equatorial substituents are less crowded. The chair
form of -D-glucopyranose predominates because all axial positions are occupied by hydrogen atoms. The bulkier –OH and –CH2OH groups emerge at
the less-hindered periphery. The boat form of glucose is disfavored because
it is quite sterically hindered.

Furanose rings, like pyranose rings, are not planar. They can be puckered so that four atoms are nearly coplanar and the fifth is about 0.5 Å away
from this plane (Figure 11.8). This conformation is called an envelope form
because the structure resembles an opened envelope with the back flap
raised. In the ribose moiety of most biomolecules, either C-2 or C-3 is out
of the plane on the same side as C-5. These conformations are called C2endo and C3-endo, respectively.

11.1.3 Monosaccharides Are Joined to Alcohols and Amines
Through Glycosidic Bonds
Monosaccharides can be modified by reaction with alcohols and amines to
form adducts. For example, D-glucose will react with methanol in an acidcatalyzed process: the anomeric carbon atom reacts with the hydroxyl group

7552dc11_295-318

5/30/01

Page 301

of methanol to form two products, methyl -D-glucopyranoside and methyl
-D-glucopyranoside. These two glucopyranosides differ in the configuration at the anomeric carbon atom. The new bond formed between the
anomeric carbon atom of glucose and the hydroxyl oxygen atom of methanol
is called a glycosidic bond—specifically, an O-glycosidic bond. The anomeric
carbon atom of a sugar can be linked to the nitrogen atom of an amine to
form an N-glycosidic bond.
Indeed, we have previously encountered such reaction products; nucleosides are adducts between sugars such as ribose and amines such as adenine (Section 5.1.1). Some other important modified sugars are shown in
Figure 11.9. Compounds such as methyl glucopyranoside show differences
in reactivity from that of the parent monosaccharide. For example, unmodified glucose reacts with oxidizing agents such as cupric ion (Cu2⫹) because the open-chain form has a free aldehyde group that is readily oxidized.

that do not are called nonreducing sugars.

carbohydrates are often expressed on cell surfaces.

11.2 COMPLEX CARBOHYDRATES ARE FORMED
BY LINKAGE OF MONOSACCHARIDES
Because sugars contain many hydroxyl groups, glycosidic bonds can join one
monosaccharide to another. Oligosaccharides are built by the linkage of two
or more monosaccharides by O-glycosidic bonds (Figure 11.10). In maltose,
for example, two D-glucose residues are joined by a glycosidic linkage between
the -anomeric form of C-1 on one sugar and the hydroxyl oxygen atom on
C-4 of the adjacent sugar. Such a linkage is called an -1,4-glycosidic bond.
The fact that monosaccharides have multiple hydroxyl groups means that

11.2.1 Sucrose, Lactose, and Maltose Are the
Common Disaccharides
A disaccharide consists of two sugars joined by an O-glycosidic bond. Three
abundant disaccharides are sucrose, lactose, and maltose (Figure 11.11).
Sucrose (common table sugar) is obtained commercially from cane or beet.
The anomeric carbon atoms of a glucose unit and a fructose unit are joined
in this disaccharide; the configuration of this glycosidic linkage is  for glucose and  for fructose. Sucrose can be cleaved into its component monosaccharides by the enzyme sucrase.
Lactose, the disaccharide of milk, consists of galactose joined to glucose
by a -1,4-glycosidic linkage. Lactose is hydrolyzed to these monosaccharides by lactase in human beings (Section 16.1.12) and by -galactosidase in
bacteria. In maltose, two glucose units are joined by an -1,4 glycosidic linkage, as stated earlier. Maltose comes from the hydrolysis of starch and is in
turn hydrolyzed to glucose by maltase. Sucrase, lactase, and maltase are
located on the outer surfaces of epithelial cells lining the small intestine
(Figure 11.12).

11.2.2 Glycogen and Starch Are Mobilizable Stores of Glucose
Large polymeric oligosaccharides, formed by the linkage of multiple monosaccharides, are called polysaccharides. Polysaccharides play vital roles in energy storage and in maintaining the structural integrity of an organism. If all
of the monosaccharides are the same, these polymers are called homopolymers.
The most common homopolymer in animal cells is glycogen, the storage form

Two chains of glucose molecules joined by
-1,4-glycosidic bonds are linked by an
-1,6-glycosidic bond to create a branch
point. Such an -1,6-glycosidic bond forms
at approximately every 10 glucose units,
making glycogen a highly branched molecule.

of glucose. As will be considered in detail in Chapter 21, glycogen is a very
large, branched polymer of glucose residues. Most of the glucose units in glycogen are linked by -1,4-glycosidic bonds. The branches are formed by -1,6glycosidic bonds, present about once in 10 units (Figure 11.13).
The nutritional reservoir in plants is starch, of which there are two forms.
Amylose, the unbranched type of starch, consists of glucose residues in
-1,4 linkage. Amylopectin, the branched form, has about 1 -1,6 linkage
per 30 -1,4 linkages, in similar fashion to glycogen except for its lower degree of branching. More than half the carbohydrate ingested by human
beings is starch. Both amylopectin and amylose are rapidly hydrolyzed by
-amylase, an enzyme secreted by the salivary glands and the pancreas.
11.2.3 Cellulose, the Major Structural Polymer of Plants,
Consists of Linear Chains of Glucose Units
Cellulose, the other major polysaccharide of glucose found in plants, serves a
structural rather than a nutritional role. Cellulose is one of the most abundant
organic compounds in the biosphere. Some 1015 kg of cellulose is synthesized
and degraded on Earth each year. It is an unbranched polymer of glucose
residues joined by -1,4 linkages. The  configuration allows cellulose to form
very long, straight chains. Fibrils are formed by parallel chains that interact
with one another through hydrogen bonds. The -1,4 linkages in glycogen
and starch produce a very different molecular architecture from that of cellulose. A hollow helix is formed instead of a straight chain (Figure 11.14). These
differing consequences of the  and  linkages are biologically important. The
straight chain formed by  linkages is optimal for the construction of fibers
having a high tensile strength. In contrast, the open helix formed by  linkages is well suited to forming an accessible store of sugar. Mammals lack cellulases and therefore cannot digest wood and vegetable fibers.

11.2.4 Glycosaminoglycans Are Anionic Polysaccharide Chains
Made of Repeating Disaccharide Units

304
CHAPTER 11 • Carbohydrates

A different kind of repeating polysaccharide is present on the animal cell
surface and in the extracellular matrix. Many glycosaminoglycans are made
of disaccharide repeating units containing a derivative of an amino sugar, either glucosamine or galactosamine (Figure 11.15). At least one of the sugars in the repeating unit has a negatively charged carboxylate or sulfate group.
Chondroitin sulfate, keratan sulfate, heparin, heparan sulfate, dermatan sulfate, and hyaluronate are the major glycosaminoglycans.
Glycosaminoglycans are usually attached to proteins to form proteoglycans. Heparin is synthesized in a nonsulfated form, which is then deacetylated and sulfated. Incomplete modification leads to a mixture of variously sulfated sequences. Some of them act as anticoagulants by binding
specifically to antithrombin, which accelerates its sequestration of thrombin (Section 10.7.8). Heparan sulfate is like heparin except that it has fewer
N- and O-sulfate groups and more acetyl groups.
Proteoglycans resemble polysaccharides more than proteins in as much
as the carbohydrate makes up as much as 95% of the biomolecule by weight.
Proteoglycans function as lubricants and structural components in connective tissue, mediate adhesion of cells to the extracellular matrix, and bind
factors that stimulate cell proliferation.

11.2.5 Specific Enzymes Are Responsible for Oligosaccharide
Assembly
Oligosaccharides are synthesized through the action of specific enzymes,
glycosyltransferases, which catalyze the formation of glycosidic bonds. Each
enzyme must be specific, to a greater or lesser extent, to the sugars being
linked. Given the diversity of known glycosidic linkages, many different enzymes are required. Note that this mode of assembly stands in contrast with
those used for the other biological polymers heretofore discussed—that is,
polypeptides and oligonucleotides. As these polymers are assembled, information about monomer sequence is transferred from a template, and a
single catalytic apparatus is responsible for all bond formation.
The general form of the reaction catalyzed by a glycosyltransferase is
shown in Figure 11.16. The sugar to be added comes in the form of an activated sugar nucleotide. Sugar nucleotides are important intermediates in many
processes, and we will encounter these intermediates again in Chapters 16
and 21. Note that such reactions can proceed with either retention or

is formed; a given enzyme proceeds by one stereochemical path or the other.
The human ABO blood groups illustrate the effects of glycosyltransferases. Carbohydrates are attached to glycoproteins and glycolipids on the surfaces of red blood cells. For one type of blood group, one of
the three different structures, termed A, B, and O, may be present (Figure
11.17). These structures have in common an oligosaccharide foundation called
the O (or sometimes H) antigen. The A and B antigens
differ from the O antigen by the addition of one extra
monosaccharide, either N-acetylgalactosamine (for A) or
galactose (for B) through an -1,3 linkage to a galactose
moiety of the O antigen.
Specific glycosyltransferases add the extra monosaccharide to the O antigen. Each person inherits the gene
for one glycosyltransferase of this type from each parent.

Why are different blood types present in the human population?
Suppose that a pathogenic organism such as a parasite expresses on
its cell surface a carbohydrate antigen similar to one of the blood-group

antigens. This antigen may not be readily detected as foreign in a person
with the blood type that matches the parasite antigen, and the parasite will
flourish. However, other people with different blood types will be protected.
Hence, there will be selective pressure on human beings to vary blood type
to prevent parasitic mimicry and a corresponding selective pressure on parasites to enhance mimicry. The constant “arms race” between pathogenic
microorganisms and human beings drives the evolution of diversity of surface antigens within the human population.

11.3 CARBOHYDRATES CAN BE ATTACHED TO PROTEINS
TO FORM GLYCOPROTEINS
Carbohydrate groups are covalently attached to many different proteins to
form glycoproteins. Carbohydrates are a much smaller percentage of the
weight of glycoproteins than of proteoglycans. Many glycoproteins are components of cell membranes, where they play a variety of roles in processes
such as cell adhesion and the binding of sperm to eggs.
11.3.1 Carbohydrates May Be Linked to Proteins
Through Asparagine (N-Linked) or Through Serine
or Threonine (O-Linked) Residues
In glycoproteins, sugars are attached either to the amide nitrogen atom in
the side chain of asparagine (termed an N-linkage) or to the oxygen atom in
the side chain of serine or threonine (termed an O-linkage), as shown in
Figure 11.18. An asparagine residue can accept an oligosaccharide only if
the residue is part of an Asn-X-Ser or Asn-X-Thr sequence, in which X can
be any residue. Thus, potential glycosylation sites can be detected within amino
acid sequences. However, which of these potential sites is actually glycosylated depends on other aspects of the protein structure and on the cell type
in which the protein is expressed. All N-linked oligosaccharides have in
common a pentasaccharide core consisting of three mannose and two Nacetylglucosamine residues. Additional sugars are attached to this core to
form the great variety of oligosaccharide patterns found in glycoproteins
(Figure 11.19).

the oligosaccharide chains have substantial

Carbohydrates are linked to some soluble proteins as well as membrane
proteins. In particular, many of the proteins secreted from cells are glycosylated. Most proteins present in the serum component of blood are glycoproteins (Figure 11.20). Furthermore, N-acetylglucosamine residues are
O-linked to some intracellular proteins. The role of these carbohydrates,
which are dynamically added and removed, is under active investigation.

Protein glycosylation takes place inside the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and the Golgi complex, organelles that play central roles in protein trafficking (Figure 11.21). One such glycoprotein (depicted in Figure
11.20) is the proteolytic enzyme elastase (Section 9.1.4), which is secreted
by the pancreas as a zymogen (Section 10.7). This protein is synthesized by
ribosomes attached to the cytoplasmic face of the ER membrane, and the
peptide chain is inserted into the lumen of the ER as it grows, guided by a
signal sequence of 29 amino acids at the amino terminus. This signal sequence, which directs the protein through a channel in the ER membrane,
is cleaved from the protein in the transport process into the ER (Figure
11.22). After the protein has entered the ER, the glycosylation process begins. The N-linked glycosylation begins in the ER and continues in the
Golgi complex, whereas the O-linked glycosylation takes place exclusively
in the Golgi complex.

A large oligosaccharide destined for attachment to the asparagine residue of
a protein is assembled attached to dolichol phosphate, a specialized lipid molecule containing as many as 20 isoprene (C5) units (Section 26.x.x).

Dolichol phosphate

The terminal phosphate group is the site of attachment of the activated
oligosaccharide, which is subsequently transferred to the protein acceptor.
Dolichol phosphate resides in the ER membrane with its phosphate terminus on the cytoplasmic face.
The assembly process proceeds in three stages. First, 2 N-acetylglucosamine residues and 5 mannose residues are added to the dolichol phosphate through the action of a number of cytoplasmic enzymes that catalyze
monosaccharide transfer from sugar nucleotides. Then, in a remarkable
(and, as yet, not well understood) process, this large structure is “flipped”
through the ER membrane into the lumen of the ER. Finally, additional
sugars are added by enzymes in the ER lumen, this time with the use of
monosaccharides activated by attachment to dolichol phosphate. This
process ends with the formation of a 14-residue oligosaccharide attached to
dolichol phosphate (Figure 11.23).
The 14-sugar-residue precursor attached to this dolichol phosphate intermediate is then transferred en bloc to a specific asparagine residue of the
growing polypeptide chain. In regard to elastase, oligosaccharides are linked

to the asparagine residues in the recognition sequences Asn 109-Gly-Ser
and Asn 159-Val-Thr. Both the activated sugars and the complex enzyme
that is responsible for transferring the oligosaccharide to the protein are located on the lumenal side of the ER, accounting for the fact that proteins in
the cytosol are not glycosylated by this pathway. Before the glycoprotein
leaves the lumen of the ER, 3 glucose molecules are removed from the 14residue oligosaccharide. As we will see in Section 11.3.6, the sequential removal of these glucose molecules is a quality-control step that ensures that
only properly folded glycoproteins are further processed.

309
Glycoproteins

Dolichol pyrophosphate released in the transfer of the oligosaccharide
to the protein is recycled to dolichol phosphate by the action of a phosphatase. This hydrolysis is blocked by bacitracin, an antibiotic. Another interesting antibiotic inhibitor of N-glycosylation is tunicamycin, a hydrophobic analog of the sugar nucleotide uridine diphosphate–N-acetylglucosamine
(UDP-GlcNAc), the activated form of N-acetylglucosamine used as a substrate for the enzymes that synthesize the oligosaccharide unit on dolichol
phosphate. Tunicamycin blocks the addition of N-acetylglucosamine to
dolichol phosphate, the first step in the formation of the core oligosaccharide.
11.3.4 Transport Vesicles Carry Proteins from the Endoplasmic
Reticulum to the Golgi Complex for Further Glycosylation
and Sorting
Proteins in the lumen of the ER and in the ER membrane are transported to
the Golgi complex, which is a stack of flattened membranous sacs. The Golgi
complex has two principal roles. First, carbohydrate units of glycoproteins are
altered and elaborated in the Golgi complex. The O-linked sugar units are fashioned there, and the N-linked sugars, arriving from the ER as a component
of a glycoprotein, are modified in many different ways. Second, the Golgi
complex is the major sorting center of the cell. Proteins proceed from the Golgi
complex to lysosomes, secretory granules (as is the case for the elastase zymogen), or the plasma membrane, according to signals encoded within their
amino acid sequences and three-dimensional structures (Figure 11.24).

Mannose 6-phosphate residue

FIGURE 11.25 Formation of a
mannose 6-phosphate marker. A
glycoprotein destined for delivery to
lysosomes acquires a phosphate marker
in the cis Golgi compartment in a two-step
process. First, a phosphotransferase adds a
phospho-N-acetylglucosamine unit to the
6-OH group of a mannose, and then a
phosphodiesterase removes the added
sugar to generate a mannose 6-phosphate
residue in the core oligosaccharide.

The Golgi complex of a typical mammalian cell has 3 or 4 membranous
sacs (cisternae), and those of many plant cells have about 20. The Golgi
complex is differentiated into (1) a cis compartment, the receiving end,
which is closest to the ER; (2) medial compartments; and (3) a trans
compartment, which exports proteins to a variety of destinations. These
compartments contain different enzymes and mediate distinctive functions.
The N-linked carbohydrate units of glycoproteins are further modified
in each of the compartments of the Golgi complex. In the cis Golgi compartment, three mannose residues are removed from the oligosaccharide
chains of proteins destined for secretion or for insertion in the plasma
membrane. The carbohydrate units of glycoproteins targeted to the lumen
of lysosomes are further modified. In the medial Golgi compartments
of some cells, two more mannose residues are removed, and two Nacetylglucosamines residues and a fucose residue are added. Finally, in the trans
Golgi, another N-acetylglucosamine residue can be added, followed by
galactose and sialic acid, to form a complex oligosaccharide unit. The sequence of N-linked oligosaccharide units of a glycoprotein is determined
both by (1) the sequence and conformation of the protein undergoing glycosylation and by (2) the glycosyltransferases present in the Golgi compartment in which they are processed. Note that, despite all of this processing, N-glycosylated proteins have in common a pentasaccharide core (see
Figure 11.19). Carbohydrate processing in the Golgi complex is called terminal glycosylation to distinguish it from core glycosylation, which takes place
in the ER. Tremendous structural diversification can occur as a result of the
terminal glycosylation process.
11.3.5 Mannose 6-phosphate Targets Lysosomal Enzymes
to Their Destinations
A carbohydrate marker directs certain proteins from the Golgi complex to lysosomes. A clue to the identity of this marker came from
analyses of I-cell disease (also called mucolipidosis II), a lysosomal storage disease. Lysosomes are organelles that degrade and recycle damaged cellular components or material brought into the cell by endocytosis. Patients with I-cell
disease suffer severe psychomotor retardation and skeletal deformities. Their
lysosomes contain large inclusions of undigested glycosaminoglycans (Section
11.2.4) and glycolipids (Section 12.2.3)—hence the “I” in the name of the disease. These inclusions are present because at least eight acid hydrolases required for their degradation are missing from affected lysosomes. In contrast,
very high levels of the enzymes are present in the blood and urine. Thus, active enzymes are synthesized, but they are exported instead of being sequestered in lysosomes. In other words, a whole series of enzymes is mislocated
in I-cell disease. Normally, these enzymes contain a mannose 6-phosphate
residue, but, in I-cell disease, the attached mannose is unmodified (Figure
11.25). Mannose 6-phosphate is in fact the marker that normally directs many
hydrolytic enzymes from the Golgi complex to lysosomes. I-cell patients are deficient in the phosphotransferase catalyzing the first step in the addition of the
phosphoryl group; the consequence is the mistargeting of eight essential enzymes.
11.3.6 Glucose Residues Are Added and Trimmed to Aid
in Protein Folding
The oligosaccharide precursors added to proteins may play a role in protein
folding as well as in protein targeting. As we have seen, before a glycoprotein
leaves the ER, two glucosidases cleave the three glucose residues of the
oligosaccharide in a step-by-step fashion. If the protein is properly folded, it
moves to the Golgi complex for further processing (Section 11.3.3). However,

if the protein is sufficiently unfolded that the oligosaccharide can act as a
substrate for glucosyltransferase, another enzyme residing in the lumen of
the ER, a glucose residue will be reattached (Figure 11.26). This residue, in
turn, is bound by one of two chaperone proteins called calnexin and calreticulin. Calnexin, the more fully understood of the two proteins, is membrane
bound, whereas calreticulin is a soluble component of the ER lumen. Unfolded proteins held by these carbohydrate-binding proteins (lectins,
Section 11.4) cannot leave the ER, giving the unfolded proteins time to fold
properly. When a chaperone releases the bound protein, the glucose residue
will be cleaved by a glucosidase. If the folding is correct, the protein moves
to the Golgi complex. Otherwise, the protein will repeat another cycle of
glucose addition and binding until the glucose-free (and, hence, properly
folded) protein can be translocated to the Golgi complex. This qualitycontrol system reveals an important principle: carbohydrates carry information. Here, the availability of carbohydrates to specific glycosyltransferases
conveys information about the folding state of the protein. Moreover, we
see the reiteration of a theme in the control of protein folding: other chaperone proteins rely on the same essential mechanism of allowing misfolded
proteins multiple attempts to reach a folded state (Section 3.6), even though
carbohydrate modification is not a part of their reaction cycles.
11.3.7 Oligosaccharides Can Be “Sequenced”
Given the large diversity of oligosaccharide structures and the many possible points of attachment to most proteins, how is it possible to determine the
structure of a glycoprotein? Most approaches are based on the use of enzymes
that cleave oligosaccharides at specific types of linkages. For example, Nlinked oligosaccharides can be released from proteins by an enzyme such as
Peptide N-glycosidase F, which cleaves the N-glycosidic bonds linking the
oligosaccharide to the protein. The oligosaccharides can then be isolated and
analyzed. Through the use of MALDI-TOF or other mass spectrometric

FIGURE 11.26 Quality-control system
for protein folding in the ER. A properly
folded glycoprotein will move to the
Golgi complex after the removal of
glucose moieties (shown in red). An
unfolded or misfolded protein will receive
a glucose residue, through the action of
a glucosyltransferase. Such glucosylated
glycoproteins bind to calnexin (or the
related protein calreticulin), which serves
as a chaperone to allow multiple attempts
to attain correct folding. Properly folded
proteins are not reglucosylated.

techniques (Section 4.1.7), the mass of an oligosaccharide fragment can be
determined. However, given the large number of potential monosaccharide
combinations, many possible oligosaccharide structures are consistent with
a given mass. More complete information can be obtained by cleaving the
oligosaccharide with enzymes of varying specificities. For example, -1,4galactosidase cleaves -glycosidic bonds exclusively at galactose residues.
The products can again be analyzed by mass spectrometry (Figure 11.27).
The repetition of this process with the use of an array of enzymes of different specificity will eventually reveal the structure of the oligosaccharide.
The points of oligosaccharide attachment can be determined through the
use of proteases. Cleavage of a protein by applying specific proteases yields
a characteristic pattern of peptide fragments that can be analyzed chromatographically (Section 4.2.1). The chromatographic properties of peptides attached to oligosaccharides will change on glycosidase treatment.
Mass spectrometric analysis or direct peptide sequencing can reveal the
identity of the peptide in question and, with additional effort, the exact site
of oligosaccharide attachment.
Posttranslational modifications such as glycosylation greatly increase the
complexity of the proteome. A given protein with several potential glycosidation sites can have many different glycosylated forms (sometimes called
glycoforms), each of which may be generated only in a specific cell type or
developmental stage. Now that the sequencing of the human genome is essentially complete, the characterization of the much more complex proteome, including the biological roles of specifically modified proteins, can
begin in earnest.

11.4 LECTINS ARE SPECIFIC
CARBOHYDRATE-BINDING PROTEINS
The diverse carbohydrate structures displayed on cell surfaces are well
suited to serve as interaction sites between cells and their environments.
Proteins termed lectins (from the Latin legere, “to select”) are the partners

7552dc11_295-318

Page 313

that bind specific carbohydrate structures. Lectins are ubiquitous, being
found in animals, plants, and microorganisms. We have already seen that
some lectins, such as calnexin, function as chaperones in protein folding
(Section 11.3.6).
11.4.1 Lectins Promote Interactions Between Cells
The chief function of lectins in animals is to facilitate cell–cell contact. A
lectin usually contains two or more binding sites for carbohydrate units;
some lectins form oligomeric structures with multiple binding sites. The
binding sites of lectins on the surface of one cell interact with arrays of carbohydrates displayed on the surface of another cell. Lectins and carbohydrates are linked by a number of relatively weak interactions that ensure
specificity yet permit unlinking as needed. The interactions between one
cell surface with carbohydrates and another with lectins resemble the action
of Velcro; each interaction is relatively weak but the composite is strong.
The exact role of lectins in plants is unclear, although they can serve as
potent insecticides. Castor beans contain so much lectin that they are toxic
to most organisms. The binding specificities of lectins from plants have been
well characterized (Figure 11.28). Bacteria, too, contain lectins. Escherichia
coli bacteria are able to adhere to epithelial cells of the gastrointestinal tract
because lectins on the E. coli surface recognize oligosaccharide units on the
surfaces of target cells. These lectins are located on slender hairlike appendages called fimbriae (pili).

Lectins can be divided into classes on the basis of their amino acid sequences and biochemical properties. One large class is the C type (for calciumrequiring) found in animals. These proteins have in common a domain of 120
amino acids that is responsible for carbohydrate binding. The structure of one
such domain bound to a carbohydrate target is shown in Figure 11.29.

A calcium ion acts as a bridge between the protein and the sugar through
direct interactions with sugar hydroxyl groups. In addition, two glutamate
residues in the protein bind to both the calcium ion and the sugar, while
other protein side chains form hydrogen bonds with other hydroxyl groups
on the carbohydrate. Changes in the amino acid residues that interact
with the carbohydrate alter the carbohydrate-binding specificity of the
lectin.

cell–cell interactions. The scanning

Proteins termed selectins are members of the C-type family. Selectins
bind immune-system cells to the sites of injury in the inflammatory
response (Figure 11.30). The L, E, and P forms of selectins bind specifically to carbohydrates on lymph-node vessels, endothelium, or activated
blood platelets, respectively. New therapeutic agents that control inflammation may emerge from a deeper understanding of how selectins bind and
distinguish different carbohydrates.
11.4.2 Influenza Virus Binds to Sialic Acid Residues
The ability of viruses to infect specific cell types is dictated in part
by the ability of these viruses to bind to particular structures or receptors on the surfaces of cells. In some cases, these receptors are carbohydrates. For example, influenza virus recognizes sialic acid residues present
on cell-surface glycoproteins. The viral protein that binds to these sugars is
called hemagglutinin (Figure 11.31).
After these surface interactions have taken place and the virus has been
taken into the cell, another viral protein, neuramidase, cleaves the glycosidic bonds to the sialic acid residues, freeing the virus to infect the cell.
Inhibitors of this enzyme are showing some promise as anti-influenza
agents.

Summary

•

Monosaccharides Are Aldehydes or Ketones with Multiple
Hydroxyl Groups

An aldose is a carbohydrate with an aldehyde group (as in glyceraldehyde and glucose), whereas a ketose contains a keto group (as in dihydroxyacetone and fructose). A sugar belongs to the D series if the absolute configuration of its asymmetric carbon farthest from the aldehyde
or keto group is the same as that of D-glyceraldehyde. Most naturally
occurring sugars belong to the D series. The C-1 aldehyde in the openchain form of glucose reacts with the C-5 hydroxyl group to form a sixmembered pyranose ring. The C-2 keto group in the open-chain form
of fructose reacts with the C-5 hydroxyl group to form a five-membered
furanose ring. Pentoses such as ribose and deoxyribose also form furanose rings. An additional asymmetric center is formed at the anomeric
carbon atom (C-1 in aldoses and C-2 in ketoses) in these cyclizations.
The hydroxyl group attached to the anomeric carbon atom is below the
plane of the ring (viewed in the standard orientation) in the  anomer,
whereas it is above the ring in the  anomer. Not all the atoms in the
rings lie in the same plane. Rather, pyranose rings usually adopt the
chair conformation, and furanose rings usually adopt the envelope conformation. Sugars are joined to alcohols and amines by glycosidic
bonds from the anomeric carbon atom. For example, N-glycosidic
bonds link sugars to purines and pyrimidines in nucleotides, RNA,
and DNA.

• Complex Carbohydrates Are Formed by Linkage of Monosaccharides

Sugars are linked to one another in disaccharides and polysaccharides
by O-glycosidic bonds. Sucrose, lactose, and maltose are the common
disaccharides. Sucrose (common table sugar), obtained from cane or beet,
consists of -glucose and -fructose joined by a glycosidic linkage between their anomeric carbon atoms. Lactose (in milk) consists of galactose joined to glucose by a -1,4 linkage. Maltose (from starch) consists
of two glucoses joined by an -1,4 linkage. Starch is a polymeric form
of glucose in plants, and glycogen serves a similar role in animals. Most
of the glucose units in starch and glycogen are in -1,4 linkage. Glycogen has more branch points formed by -1,6 linkages than does starch,
which makes glycogen more soluble. Cellulose, the major structural
polymer of plant cell walls, consists of glucose units joined by -1,4
linkages. These  linkages give rise to long straight chains that form fibrils with high tensile strength. In contrast, the  linkages in starch and
glycogen lead to open helices, in keeping with their roles as mobilizable
energy stores. Cell surfaces and extracellular matrices of animals contain polymers of repeating disaccharides called glycosaminoglycans.
One of the units in each repeat is a derivative of glucosamine or galactosamine. These highly anionic carbohydrates have a high density of
carboxylate or sulfate groups. Proteins bearing covalently linked glycosaminoglycans are termed proteoglycans.

• Carbohydrates Can Attach to Proteins to Form Glycoproteins

Specific enzymes link the oligosaccharide units on proteins either to the
side-chain oxygen atom of a serine or threonine residue or to the sidechain amide nitrogen atom of an asparagine residue. Protein glycosylation takes place in the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum. The Nlinked oligosaccharides are synthesized on dolichol phosphate and
subsequently transferred to the protein acceptor. Additional sugars are
attached in the Golgi complex to form diverse patterns.

CHAPTER 11 • Carbohydrates

Lectins Are Specific Carbohydrate-Binding Proteins

Carbohydrates are recognized by proteins called lectins, which are
found in animals, plants, and microorganisms. In animals, the interplay
of lectins and their sugar targets guides cell–cell contact. The viral protein hemagglutinin on the surface of the influenza virus recognizes sialic
acid residues on the surfaces of the cells invaded by the virus. A small
number of carbohydrate residues can be joined in many different ways
to form highly diverse patterns that can be distinguished by the lectin
domains of protein receptors.

by linking one glucose, one mannose, and one galactose? Assume
that each sugar is in its pyranose form. Compare this number
with the number of tripeptides that can be made from three different amino acids.

4. Tollen’s test. Glucose and other aldoses are oxidized by an
aqueous solution of a silver–ammonia complex. What are the reaction products?
5. Mutarotation. The specific rotations of the  and  anomers
of D-glucose are ⫹112 degrees and ⫹18.7 degrees, respectively.
Specific rotation, []D, is defined as the observed rotation of
light of wavelength 589 nm (the D line of a sodium lamp) passing through 10 cm of a 1 g ml⫺1 solution of a sample. When a
crystalline sample of -D-glucopyranose is dissolved in water,
the specific rotation decreases from 112 degrees to an equilibrium value of 52.7 degrees. On the basis of this result, what are
the proportions of the  and  anomers at equilibrium? Assume
that the concentration of the open-chain form is negligible.
6. Telltale adduct. Glucose reacts slowly with hemoglobin and
other proteins to form covalent compounds. Why is glucose reactive? What is the nature of the adduct formed?
7. Periodate cleavage. Compounds containing hydroxyl
groups on adjacent carbon atoms undergo carbon–carbon
bond cleavage when treated with periodate ion (IO4⫺). How
can this reaction be used to distinguish between pyranosides
and furanosides?

Biological membranes serve several additional important functions indispensable for life, such as energy storage and information transduction,
that are dictated by the proteins associated with them. In this chapter, we
will examine the general properties of membrane proteins—how they can
exist in the hydrophobic environment of the membrane while connecting
two hydrophilic environments—and delay a discussion of the functions of
these proteins to the next and later chapters.

12.1 MANY COMMON FEATURES UNDERLIE THE
DIVERSITY OF BIOLOGICAL MEMBRANES

FIGURE 12.1 Red-blood-cell plasma

preparation of plasma membranes from
red blood cells showing the membranes
as seen “on edge,” in cross section.

Membranes are as diverse in structure as they are in function. However,
they do have in common a number of important attributes:
1. Membranes are sheetlike structures, only two molecules thick, that form
closed boundaries between different compartments. The thickness of most
membranes is between 60 Å (6 nm) and 100 Å (10 nm).
2. Membranes consist mainly of lipids and proteins. Their mass ratio ranges
from 1:4 to 4:1. Membranes also contain carbohydrates that are linked to
lipids and proteins.
3. Membrane lipids are relatively small molecules that have both hydrophilic
and hydrophobic moieties. These lipids spontaneously form closed bimolecular sheets in aqueous media. These lipid bilayers are barriers to the flow of
polar molecules.
4. Specific proteins mediate distinctive functions of membranes. Proteins serve
as pumps, channels, receptors, energy transducers, and enzymes. Membrane proteins are embedded in lipid bilayers, which create suitable environments for their action.
5. Membranes are noncovalent assemblies. The constituent protein and lipid
molecules are held together by many noncovalent interactions, which are
cooperative.
6. Membranes are asymmetric. The two faces of biological membranes always differ from each other.
7. Membranes are fluid structures. Lipid molecules diffuse rapidly in the
plane of the membrane, as do proteins, unless they are anchored by specific
interactions. In contrast, lipid molecules and proteins do not readily rotate
across the membrane. Membranes can be regarded as two-dimensional solutions of oriented proteins and lipids.
8. Most cell membranes are electrically polarized, such that the inside is
negative [typically ⫺ 60 millivolts (mV)]. Membrane potential plays a key
role in transport, energy conversion, and excitability (Chapter 13).

12.2 FATTY ACIDS ARE KEY CONSTITUENTS OF LIPIDS
Among the most biologically significant properties of lipids are their hydrophobic properties. These properties are mainly due to a particular component of lipids: fatty acids, or simply fats. Fatty acids also play important
roles in signal-transduction pathways (Sections 15.x. x and 22.x.x).
12.2.1 The Naming of Fatty Acids
Fatty acids are hydrocarbon chains of various lengths and degrees of unsaturation that terminate with carboxylic acid groups. The systematic name

Membrane Channels and Pumps

The flow of ions through a single membrane channel (channels are shown in red
in the illustration at the left) can be detected by the patch clamp technique,
which records current changes as the channel transits between the open and
closed states. [(Left) After E. Neher and B. Sakmann. The patch clamp technique. Copyright © 1992

The lipid bilayer of biological membranes, as discussed in Chapter 12, is
intrinsically impermeable to ions and polar molecules. Permeability is conferred by two classes of membrane proteins, pumps and channels. Pumps use
a source of free energy such as ATP or light to drive the
thermodynamically uphill transport of ions or molecules.

Pump action is an example of active transport. Channels, in
contrast, enable ions to flow rapidly through membranes in

acids. Palmitate is a 16-carbon, saturated
Oleate
(ionized form of oleic acid)

for a fatty acid is derived from the name of its parent hydrocarbon by the
substitution of oic for the final e. For example, the C18 saturated fatty acid
is called octadecanoic acid because the parent hydrocarbon is octadecane. A
C18 fatty acid with one double bond is called octadecenoic acid; with two
double bonds, octadecadienoic acid; and with three double bonds, octadecatrienoic acid. The notation 18:0 denotes a C18 fatty acid with no double
bonds, whereas 18:2 signifies that there are two double bonds. The structures of the ionized forms of two common fatty acids—palmitic acid (C16,
saturated) and oleic acid (C18, monounsaturated)—are shown in Figure 12.2.
Fatty acid carbon atoms are numbered starting at the carboxyl terminus,
as shown in the margin. Carbon atoms 2 and 3 are often referred to as ␣ and
␤, respectively. The methyl carbon atom at the distal end of the chain is called
the ␻-carbon atom. The position of a double bond is represented by the symbol ⌬ followed by a superscript number. For example, cis-⌬9 means that there
is a cis double bond between carbon atoms 9 and 10; trans-⌬2 means that
there is a trans double bond between carbon atoms 2 and 3. Alternatively,
the position of a double bond can be denoted by counting from the distal
end, with the ␻-carbon atom (the methyl carbon) as number 1. An ␻-3 fatty
acid, for example, has the structure shown in the margin. Fatty acids are ionized at physiological pH, and so it is appropriate to refer to them according
to their carboxylate form: for example, palmitate or hexadecanoate.

Fatty acids in biological systems usually contain an even number of carbon
atoms, typically between 14 and 24 (Table 12.1). The 16- and 18-carbon
fatty acids are most common. The hydrocarbon chain is almost invariably
unbranched in animal fatty acids. The alkyl chain may be saturated or it
may contain one or more double bonds. The configuration of the double
bonds in most unsaturated fatty acids is cis. The double bonds in polyunsaturated fatty acids are separated by at least one methylene group.
The properties of fatty acids and of lipids derived from them are
markedly dependent on chain length and degree of saturation. Unsaturated
fatty acids have lower melting points than saturated fatty acids of the same
length. For example, the melting point of stearic acid is 69.6°C, whereas
that of oleic acid (which contains one cis double bond) is 13.4°C. The melting points of polyunsaturated fatty acids of the C18 series are even lower.
Chain length also affects the melting point, as illustrated by the fact that
the melting temperature of palmitic acid (C16) is 6.5 degrees lower than that
of stearic acid (C18). Thus, short chain length and unsaturation enhance the
fluidity of fatty acids and of their derivatives.

12.3 THERE ARE THREE COMMON TYPES
OF MEMBRANE LIPIDS
Lipids differ markedly from the other groups of biomolecules considered
thus far. By definition, lipids are water-insoluble biomolecules that are highly
soluble in organic solvents such as chloroform. Lipids have a variety of biological roles: they serve as fuel molecules, highly concentrated energy stores,
signal molecules, and components of membranes. The first three roles of
lipids will be discussed in later chapters. Here, our focus is on lipids as membrane constituents. The three major kinds of membrane lipids are phospholipids, glycolipids, and cholesterol. We begin with lipids found in eukaryotes
and bacteria. The lipids in archaea are distinct, although they have many
features related to their membrane-forming function in common with lipids
of other organisms.

FIGURE 12.3 Schematic structure of a
phospholipid.

Phospholipids are abundant in all biological membranes. A phospholipid
molecule is constructed from four components: fatty acids, a platform to
which the fatty acids are attached, a phosphate, and an alcohol attached to
the phosphate (Figure 12.3). The fatty acid components provide a hydrophobic barrier, whereas the remainder of the molecule has hydrophilic
properties to enable interaction with the environment.
The platform on which phospholipids are built may be glycerol, a 3carbon alcohol, or sphingosine, a more complex alcohol. Phospholipids derived from glycerol are called phosphoglycerides. A phosphoglyceride consists
of a glycerol backbone to which two fatty acid chains (whose characteristics
were described in Section 12.2.2) and a phosphorylated alcohol are attached.
In phosphoglycerides, the hydroxyl groups at C-1 and C-2 of glycerol
are esterified to the carboxyl groups of the two fatty acid chains. The C-3
hydroxyl group of the glycerol backbone is esterified to phosphoric acid.
When no further additions are made, the resulting compound is phosphatidate (diacylglycerol 3-phosphate), the simplest phosphoglyceride. Only small

amounts of phosphatidate are present in membranes. However, the molecule is a key intermediate in the biosynthesis of the other phosphoglycerides
(Section 26.x.x). The absolute configuration of the glycerol 3-phosphate
moiety of membrane lipids is shown in Figure 12.4.
The major phosphoglycerides are derived from phosphatidate by the formation of an ester bond between the phosphate group of phosphatidate and
the hydroxyl group of one of several alcohols. The common alcohol moieties of phosphoglycerides are the amino acid serine, ethanolamine, choline,
glycerol, and the inositol.

H3C

The membranes of archaea differ in composition from those of eukaryotes
or bacteria in three important ways. Two of these differences clearly relate
to the hostile living conditions of many archaea (Figure 12.7). First, the nonpolar chains are joined to a glycerol backbone by ether rather than ester linkages. The ether linkage is more resistant to hydrolysis. Second, the alkyl
chains are branched rather than linear. They are built up from repeats of a
fully saturated five-carbon fragment. These branched, saturated hydrocarbons are more resistant to oxidation. The ability of archaeal lipids to resist
hydrolysis and oxidation may help these organisms to withstand the extreme
conditions, such as high temperature, low pH, or high salt concentration,
under which some of these archaea grow. Finally, the stereochemistry of the
central glycerol is inverted compared with that shown in Figure 12.4.

12.3.3 Membrane Lipids Can Also Include Carbohydrate Moieties
Glycolipids, as their name implies, are sugar-containing lipids. Like sphingomyelin, the glycolipids in animal cells are derived from sphingosine. The
amino group of the sphingosine backbone is acylated by a fatty acid, as in
sphingomyelin. Glycolipids differ from sphingomyelin in the identity of the
unit that is linked to the primary hydroxyl group of the sphingosine backbone. In glycolipids, one or more sugars (rather than phosphoryl choline)

A hydrocarbon tail is linked to the steroid at one end, and a hydroxyl group
is attached at the other end. In membranes, the molecule is oriented
parallel to the fatty acid chains of the phospholipids, and the hydroxyl
group interacts with the nearby phospholipid head groups. Cholesterol
is absent from prokaryotes but is found to varying degrees in virtually
all animal membranes. It constitutes almost 25% of the membrane
lipids in certain nerve cells but is essentially absent from some intracellular membranes.
12.3.5 A Membrane Lipid Is an Amphipathic Molecule
Containing a Hydrophilic and a Hydrophobic Moiety
The repertoire of membrane lipids is extensive, perhaps even bewildering,
at first sight. However, they possess a critical common structural theme:
membrane lipids are amphipathic molecules (amphiphilic molecules). A membrane lipid contains both a hydrophilic and a hydrophobic moiety.
Let us look at a model of a phosphoglyceride, such as phosphatidyl
choline. Its overall shape is roughly rectangular (Figure 12.8A). The two
hydrophobic fatty acid chains are approximately parallel to each other,
whereas the hydrophilic phosphoryl choline moiety points in the opposite
direction. Sphingomyelin has a similar conformation, as does the archaeal
lipid depicted. Therefore, the following shorthand has been adopted to represent these membrane lipids: the hydrophilic unit, also called the polar head
group, is represented by a circle, whereas the hydrocarbon tails are depicted
by straight or wavy lines (Figure 12.8B).

FORM BIMOLECULAR SHEETS IN AQUEOUS MEDIA

a micelle. Ionized fatty acids readily form
such structures, but most phospholipids
do not.

FIGURE 12.10 Diagram of a section of
a bilayer membrane.

What properties enable phospholipids to form membranes? Membrane formation is a consequence of the amphipathic nature of the molecules. Their polar head groups favor contact with water, whereas their hydrocarbon tails
interact with one another, in preference to water. How can molecules with
these preferences arrange themselves in aqueous solutions? One way is to
form a micelle, a globular structure in which polar head groups are surrounded by water and hydrocarbon tails are sequestered inside, interacting
with one another (Figure 12.9).
Alternatively, the strongly opposed preferences of the hydrophilic and
hydrophobic moieties of membrane lipids can be satisfied by forming a lipid
bilayer, composed of two lipid sheets (Figure 12.10). A lipid bilayer is also
called a bimolecular sheet. The hydrophobic tails of each individual sheet interact with one another, forming a hydrophobic interior that acts as a permeability barrier. The hydrophilic head groups interact with the aqueous
medium on each side of the bilayer. The two opposing sheets are called
leaflets.
The favored structure for most phospholipids and glycolipids in aqueous media is a bimolecular sheet rather than a micelle. The reason is that the two
fatty acyl chains of a phospholipid or a glycolipid are too bulky to fit into
the interior of a micelle. In contrast, salts of fatty acids (such as sodium
palmitate, a constituent of soap), which contain only one chain, readily form
micelles. The formation of bilayers instead of micelles by phospholipids is of
critical biological importance. A micelle is a limited structure, usually less
than 20 nm (200 Å) in diameter. In contrast, a bimolecular sheet can have
macroscopic dimensions, such as a millimeter (106 nm, or 107 Å). Phospholipids and related molecules are important membrane constituents because they readily form extensive bimolecular sheets (Figure 12.11).
The formation of lipid bilayers is a self-assembly process. In other words,
the structure of a bimolecular sheet is inherent in the structure of the constituent lipid molecules. The growth of lipid bilayers from phospholipids is
a rapid and spontaneous process in water. Hydrophobic interactions are the

7552dc12_319-344

7/30/01

Page 327

major driving force for the formation of lipid bilayers. Recall that hydrophobic interactions also play a dominant role in the folding of proteins (Sections
1.3.4 and 3.4) and in the stacking of bases in nucleic acids (Section 5.2.1).
Water molecules are released from the hydrocarbon tails of membrane lipids
as these tails become sequestered in the nonpolar interior of the bilayer. Furthermore, van der Waals attractive forces between the hydrocarbon tails favor
close packing of the tails. Finally, there are electrostatic and hydrogen-bonding attractions between the polar head groups and water molecules. Thus, lipid
bilayers are stabilized by the full array of forces that mediate molecular interactions in biological systems.
Because lipid bilayers are held together by many reinforcing, noncovalent interactions (predominantly hydrophobic), they are cooperative structures. These hydrophobic interactions have three significant biological
consequences: (1) lipid bilayers have an inherent tendency to be extensive;
(2) lipid bilayers will tend to close on themselves so that there are no edges
with exposed hydrocarbon chains, and so they form compartments; and
(3) lipid bilayers are self-sealing because a hole in a bilayer is energetically
unfavorable.

12.4.1 Lipid Vesicles Can Be Formed from Phospholipids
The propensity of phospholipids to form membranes has been used to create an important experimental and clinical tool. Lipid vesicles, or liposomes,
aqueous compartments enclosed by a lipid bilayer (Figure 12.12), can be
used to study membrane permeability or to deliver chemicals to cells. Liposomes are formed by suspending a suitable lipid, such as phosphatidyl
choline, in an aqueous medium, and then sonicating (i.e., agitating by highfrequency sound waves) to give a dispersion of closed vesicles that are quite
uniform in size. Vesicles formed by these methods are nearly spherical in
shape and have a diameter of about 50 nm (500 Å). Larger vesicles (of the
order of 1 ␮m, or 104 Å, in diameter) can be prepared by slowly evaporating the organic solvent from a suspension of phospholipid in a mixed solvent system.
Ions or molecules can be trapped in the aqueous compartments of
lipid vesicles by forming the vesicles in the presence of these substances
(Figure 12.13). For example, 50-nm-diameter vesicles formed in a 0.1 M

glycine solution will trap about 2000 molecules of glycine in each inner
aqueous compartment. These glycine-containing vesicles can be separated
from the surrounding solution of glycine by dialysis or by gel-filtration
chromatography (Section 4.1.3). The permeability of the bilayer membrane
to glycine can then be determined by measuring the rate of efflux of glycine
from the inner compartment of the vesicle to the ambient solution. Specific
membrane proteins can be solubilized in the presence of detergents and then
added to the phospholipids from which liposomes will be formed. Protein–
liposome complexes provide valuable experimental tools for examining a
range of membrane-protein functions.
Experiments are underway to develop clinical uses for liposomes. For
example, liposomes containing drugs or DNA for gene-therapy experiments can be injected into patients. These liposomes fuse with the
plasma membrane of many kinds of cells, introducing into the cells the molecules that they contain. Drug delivery with liposomes also alters the
distribution of a drug within the body and often lessens its toxicity. For
instance, less of the drug is distributed to normal tissues because longcirculating liposomes have been shown to concentrate in regions of increased
blood circulation, such as solid tumors and sites of inflammation. Moreover, the selective fusion of lipid vesicles with particular kinds of cells is a
promising means of controlling the delivery of drugs to target cells.
Another well-defined synthetic membrane is a planar bilayer membrane.
This structure can be formed across a 1-mm hole in a partition between two
aqueous compartments by dipping a fine paintbrush into a membraneforming solution, such as phosphatidyl choline in decane. The tip of the
brush is then stroked across a hole (1 mm in diameter) in a partition between two aqueous media. The lipid film across the hole thins spontaneously
into a lipid bilayer. The electrical conduction properties of this macroscopic
bilayer membrane are readily studied by inserting electrodes into each aqueous compartment (Figure 12.14). For example, its permeability to ions is
determined by measuring the current across the membrane as a function of
the applied voltage.
12.4.2 Lipid Bilayers Are Highly Impermeable to Ions
and Most Polar Molecules
The results of permeability studies of lipid vesicles and electrical-conductance measurements of planar bilayers have shown that lipid bilayer membranes have a very low permeability for ions and most polar molecules. Water
is a conspicuous exception to this generalization; it readily traverses such
membranes because of its small size, high concentration, and lack of a complete charge. The range of measured permeability coefficients is very wide
(Figure 12.15). For example, Na⫹ and K⫹ traverse these membranes 109

times as slowly as does H2O. Tryptophan, a zwitterion at pH 7, crosses the
membrane 103 times as slowly as does indole, a structurally related molecule that lacks ionic groups. In fact, the permeability coefficients of small molecules are correlated with their solubility in a nonpolar solvent relative to their
solubility in water. This relation suggests that a small molecule might traverse a lipid bilayer membrane in the following way: first, it sheds its solvation shell of water; then, it becomes dissolved in the hydrocarbon core of
the membrane; finally, it diffuses through this core to the other side of the
membrane, where it becomes resolvated by water. An ion such as Na⫹ traverses membranes very slowly because the replacement of its coordination
shell of polar water molecules by nonpolar interactions with the membrane
interior is highly unfavorable energetically.

Membrane Proteins

12.5 PROTEINS CARRY OUT MOST MEMBRANE
PROCESSES
We now turn to membrane proteins, which are responsible for most of the
dynamic processes carried out by membranes. Membrane lipids form a permeability barrier and thereby establish compartments, whereas specific proteins mediate nearly all other membrane functions. In particular, proteins
transport chemicals and information across a membrane. Membrane lipids
create the appropriate environment for the action of such proteins.
Membranes differ in their protein content. Myelin, a membrane that
serves as an insulator around certain nerve fibers, has a low content of protein (18%). Relatively pure lipids are well suited for insulation. In contrast,
the plasma membranes or exterior membranes of most other cells are much
more active. They contain many pumps, channels, receptors, and enzymes.
The protein content of these plasma membranes is typically 50%. Energytransduction membranes, such as the internal membranes of mitochondria
and chloroplasts, have the highest content of protein, typically 75%.
The protein components of a membrane can be readily visualized by
SDS–polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. As discussed earlier (Section 4.1.4),
the electrophoretic mobility of many proteins in SDS-containing gels depends on the mass rather than on the net charge of the protein. The gelelectrophoresis patterns of three membranes—the plasma membrane of erythrocytes, the photoreceptor membrane of retinal rod cells, and the
sarcoplasmic reticulum membrane of muscle—are shown in Figure 12.16.
It is evident that each of these three membranes contains many proteins but
has a distinct protein composition. In general, membranes performing different functions contain different repertoires of proteins.
12.5.1 Proteins Associate with the Lipid Bilayer in a
Variety of Ways
The ease with which a protein can be dissociated from a membrane indicates
how intimately it is associated with the membrane. Some membrane proteins
can be solubilized by relatively mild means, such as extraction by a solution
of high ionic strength (e.g., 1 M NaCl). Other membrane proteins are bound
much more tenaciously; they can be solubilized only by using a detergent or
an organic solvent. Membrane proteins can be classified as being either peripheral or integral on the basis of this difference in dissociability (Figure
12.17). Integral membrane proteins interact extensively with the hydrocarbon
chains of membrane lipids, and so only agents that compete for these nonpolar interactions can release them. In fact, most integral membrane proteins
span the lipid bilayer. In contrast, peripheral membrane proteins are bound to

membranes primarily by electrostatic and hydrogen-bond interactions with
the head groups of lipids. These polar interactions can be disrupted by adding
salts or by changing the pH. Many peripheral membrane proteins are bound
to the surfaces of integral proteins, on either the cytosolic or the extracellular side of the membrane. Others are anchored to the lipid bilayer by a covalently attached hydrophobic chain, such as a fatty acid.
12.5.2 Proteins Interact with Membranes in a Variety of Ways
Although membrane proteins are more difficult to purify and crystallize
than are water-soluble proteins, researchers using x-ray crystallographic or
electron microscopic methods have determined the three-dimensional
structures of more than 20 such proteins at sufficiently high resolution to
discern the molecular details. As noted in Chapter 3, the structures of membrane proteins differ from those of soluble proteins with regard to the distribution of hydrophobic and hydrophilic groups. We will consider the
structures of three membrane proteins in some detail.
Proteins Can Span the Membrane with Alpha Helices. The first
membrane protein that we consider is the archaeal protein bacteriorhodopsin,
shown in Figure 12.18. This protein acts in energy transduction by using
light energy to transport protons from inside the cell to outside. The proton gradient generated in this way is used to form ATP. Bacteriorhodopsin
is built almost entirely of ␣ helices; seven closely packed ␣ helices, arranged
almost perpendicularly to the plane of the membrane, span its 45-Å width.
Examination of the primary structure of bacteriorhodopsin reveals that most
of the amino acids in these membrane-spanning ␣ helices are nonpolar and
only a very few are charged (Figure 12.19). This distribution of nonpolar
amino acids is sensible because these residues are either in contact with the

will be discussed in Section 12.5.4, such regions can often be detected from
amino acid sequence information alone.

A Channel Protein Can Be Formed from Beta Strands. Porin, a
protein from the outer membranes of bacteria such as E. coli and Rhodobacter capsulatus, represents a class of membrane proteins with a completely
different type of structure. Structures of this type are built from ␤ strands
and contain essentially no ␣ helices (Figure 12.20).

Periplasm

The arrangement of ␤ strands is quite simple: each strand is hydrogen
bonded to its neighbor in an antiparallel arrangement, forming a single ␤
sheet. The ␤ sheet curls up to form a hollow cylinder that functions as the
active unit. As its name suggests, porin forms pores, or channels, in the
membranes. A pore runs through the center of each cylinder-like protein.
The outside surface of porin is appropriately nonpolar, given that it interacts with the hydrocarbon core of the membrane. In contrast, the inside of
the channel is quite hydrophilic and is filled with water. This arrangement
of nonpolar and polar surfaces is accomplished by the alternation of hydrophobic and hydrophilic amino acids along each ␤ strand (Figure 12.21).

Embedding Part of a Protein in a Membrane Can Link It to the
Membrane Surface. The structure of the membrane-bound enzyme prostaglandin H2 synthase-1 reveals a rather different role for ␣ helices in protein–
membrane associations. This enzyme catalyzes the conversion of arachidonic
acid into prostaglandin H2 in two steps: a cyclooxygenase reaction and a peroxidase reaction (Figure 12.22). Prostaglandin H2 promotes inflammation
and modulates gastric acid secretion. The enzyme that produces prostaglandin
H2 is a homodimer with a rather complicated structure consisting primarily
of ␣ helices. Unlike bacteriorhodopsin, this protein is not largely embedded
in the membrane but, instead, lies along the outer surface of the membrane
firmly bound by a set of ␣ helices with hydrophobic surfaces that extend from
the bottom of the protein into the membrane (Figure 12.23). This linkage is
sufficiently strong that only the action of detergents can release the protein
from the membrane. Thus, this enzyme is classified as an integral membrane
protein, although it is not a membrane-spanning protein.

The localization of prostaglandin H2 synthase-l in the membrane is
crucial to its function. The substrate for this enzyme, arachidonic acid,
is a hydrophobic molecule generated by the hydrolysis of membrane lipids.
Arachidonic acid reaches the active site of the enzyme from the membrane
without entering an aqueous environment by traveling through a hydrophobic channel in the protein (Figure 12.24). Indeed, nearly all of us have experienced the importance of this channel: drugs such as aspirin and ibuprofen block the channel and prevent prostaglandin synthesis by inhibiting the
cyclooxygenase activity of the synthase. In the case of aspirin, the drug acts
through the transfer of an acetyl group from the aspirin to a serine residue
(Ser 530) that lies along the path to the active site (Figure 12.25).

Two important features emerge from our examination of these three examples of membrane protein structure. First, the parts of the protein that
interact with the hydrophobic parts of the membrane are coated with nonpolar amino acid side chains, whereas those parts that interact with the aqueous environment are much more hydrophilic. Second, the structures positioned within the membrane are quite regular and, in particular, all
backbone hydrogen-bond donors and acceptors participate in hydrogen
bonds. Breaking a hydrogen bond within a membrane is quite unfavorable, because little or no water is present to compete for the polar groups.

Through Covalently Attached Hydrophobic Groups
The membrane proteins considered thus far associate with the membrane
through surfaces generated by hydrophobic amino acid side chains. However, even otherwise soluble proteins can associate with membranes if the
association is mediated by hydrophobic groups attached to the proteins.
Three such groups are shown in Figure 12.26: (1) a palmitoyl group attached
to a specific cysteine residue by a thioester bond, (2) a farnesyl group attached to a cysteine residue at the carboxyl terminus, and (3) a glycolipid
structure termed a glycosyl phosphatidyl inositol (GPI) anchor attached to
the carboxyl terminus. These modifications are attached by enzyme systems
that recognize specific signal sequences near the site of attachment.

12.5.4 Transmembrane Helices Can Be Accurately Predicted
from Amino Acid Sequences
Many membrane proteins, like bacteriorhodopsin, employ ␣ helices to span
the hydrophobic part of a membrane. As noted earlier, typically most of
the residues in these ␣ helices are nonpolar and almost none of them are
charged. Can we use this information to identify putative membrane-spanning
regions from sequence data alone? One approach to identifying transmembrane helices is to ask whether a postulated helical segment is likely to be
most stable in a hydrocarbon milieu or in water. Specifically, we want to estimate the free-energy change when a helical segment is transferred from
the interior of a membrane to water. Free-energy changes for the transfer
of individual amino acid residues from a hydrophobic to an aqueous environment are given in Table 12.2. For example, the transfer of a poly-L-arginine helix, a homopolymer of a positively charged amino acid, from the interior of a membrane to water would be highly favorable [⫺12.3 kcal mol⫺1
(⫺51.5 kJ mol⫺1) per arginine residue in the helix], whereas the transfer of

a poly-L-phenylalanine helix, a homopolymer of a hydrophobic amino acid,
would be unfavorable [⫹3.7 kcal mol⫺1 (⫹15.5 kJ mol⫺1) per phenylalanine residue in the helix].
The hydrocarbon core of a membrane is typically 30 Å wide, a length that
can be traversed by an ␣ helix consisting of 20 residues. We can take the
amino acid sequence of a protein and estimate the free-energy change that
takes place when a hypothetical ␣ helix formed of residues 1 through 20 is
transferred from the membrane interior to water. The same calculation can
be made for residues 2 through 21, 3 through 22, and so forth, until we reach
the end of the sequence. The span of 20 residues chosen for this calculation
is called a window. The free-energy change for each window is plotted against
the first amino acid at the window to create a hydropathy plot. Empirically, a
peak of ⫹20 kcal mol⫺1 (⫹84 kJ mol⫺1) or more in a hydropathy plot based
on a window of 20 residues indicates that a polypeptide segment could be a
membrane-spanning ␣ helix. For example, glycophorin, a protein found in
the membranes of red blood cells, is predicted by this criterion to have one
membrane-spanning helix, in agreement with experimental findings (Figure
12.27). It should be noted, however, that a peak in the hydropathy plot does
not prove that a segment is a transmembrane helix. Even soluble proteins
may have highly nonpolar regions. Conversely, some membrane proteins
contain transmembrane structural features (such as membrane-spanning ␤
strands) that escape detection by these plots (Figure 12.28).

12.6 LIPIDS AND MANY MEMBRANE PROTEINS
DIFFUSE RAPIDLY IN THE PLANE OF THE MEMBRANE
Biological membranes are not rigid, static structures. On the contrary, lipids
and many membrane proteins are constantly in lateral motion, a process
called lateral diffusion. The rapid lateral movement of membrane proteins has
been visualized by means of fluorescence microscopy through the use of the
technique of fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP; Figure 12.29).

CHAPTER 12 • Lipids and Cell Membranes

First, a cell-surface component is specifically labeled with a fluorescent
chromophore. A small region of the cell surface (⬃3 ␮m2) is viewed through
a fluorescence microscope. The fluorescent molecules in this region are then
destroyed (bleached) by a very intense light pulse from a laser. The fluorescence of this region is subsequently monitored as a function of time by
using a light level sufficiently low to prevent further bleaching. If the labeled component is mobile, bleached molecules leave and unbleached molecules enter the illuminated region, which results in an increase in the fluorescence intensity. The rate of recovery of fluorescence depends on the
lateral mobility of the fluorescence-labeled component, which can be expressed in terms of a diffusion coefficient, D. The average distance s traversed in time t depends on D according to the expression
s ⫽ (4Dt) 1Ⲑ2
The diffusion coefficient of lipids in a variety of membranes is about
1 ␮m2 s⫺1. Thus, a phospholipid molecule diffuses an average distance of
2 ␮m in 1 s. This rate means that a lipid molecule can travel from one end of
a bacterium to the other in a second. The magnitude of the observed diffusion coefficient indicates that the viscosity of the membrane is about 100
times that of water, rather like that of olive oil.
In contrast, proteins vary markedly in their lateral mobility. Some proteins are nearly as mobile as lipids, whereas others are virtually immobile. For
example, the photoreceptor protein rhodopsin (Section 32.3.1), a very mobile protein, has a diffusion coefficient of 0.4 ␮m2 s⫺1. The rapid movement of rhodopsin is essential for fast signaling. At the other extreme is fibronectin, a peripheral glycoprotein that interacts with the extracellular
matrix. For fibronectin, D is less than 10⫺4 ␮m2 s⫺1. Fibronectin has a very
low mobility because it is anchored to actin filaments on the inside of the
plasma membrane through integrin, a transmembrane protein that links the
extracellular matrix to the cytoskeleton.
12.6.1 The Fluid Mosaic Model Allows Lateral Movement but
Not Rotation Through the Membrane
On the basis of the dynamic properties of proteins in membranes, S.
Jonathan Singer and Garth Nicolson proposed the concept of a fluid mosaic
model for the overall organization of biological membranes in 1972 (Figure
12.30). The essence of their model is that membranes are two-dimensional solutions of oriented lipids and globular proteins. The lipid bilayer has a dual
role: it is both a solvent for integral membrane proteins and a permeability

barrier. Membrane proteins are free to diffuse laterally in the lipid matrix
unless restricted by special interactions.
Although the lateral diffusion of membrane components can be rapid,
the spontaneous rotation of lipids from one face of a membrane to the other
is a very slow process. The transition of a molecule from one membrane surface to the other is called transverse diffusion or flip-flop (Figure 12.31) The
flip-flop of phospholipid molecules in phosphatidyl choline vesicles has
been directly measured by electron spin resonance techniques, which show
that a phospholipid molecule flip-flops once in several hours. Thus, a phospholipid molecule takes about 109 times as long to flip-flop across a membrane as it takes to diffuse a distance of 50 Å in the lateral direction. The
free-energy barriers to flip-flopping are even larger for protein molecules
than for lipids because proteins have more extensive polar regions. In fact,
the flip-flop of a protein molecule has not been observed. Hence, membrane
asymmetry can be preserved for long periods.

Many membrane processes, such as transport or signal transduction, depend on the fluidity of the membrane lipids, which in turn depends on the
properties of fatty acid chains, which can exist in an ordered, rigid state or
in a relatively disordered, fluid state. The transition from the rigid to the
fluid state occurs rather abruptly as the temperature is raised above Tm, the
melting temperature (Figure 12.32). This transition temperature depends on
the length of the fatty acyl chains and on their degree of unsaturation (Table
12.3). The presence of saturated fatty acyl residues favors the rigid state because their straight hydrocarbon chains interact very favorably with each
other. On the other hand, a cis double bond produces a bend in the hydrocarbon chain. This bend interferes with a highly ordered packing of fatty acyl
chains, and so Tm is lowered (Figure 12.33). The length of the fatty acyl chain
also affects the transition temperature. Long hydrocarbon chains interact
more strongly than do short ones. Specifically, each additional –CH2– group
makes a favorable contribution of about ⫺0.5 kcal mol⫺1 (⫺2.1 kJ mol⫺1)
to the free energy of interaction of two adjacent hydrocarbon chains.
Bacteria regulate the fluidity of their membranes by varying the number of
double bonds and the length of their fatty acyl chains. For example, the ratio
of saturated to unsaturated fatty acyl chains in the E. coli membrane decreases from 1.6 to 1.0 as the growth temperature is lowered from 42°C to
27°C. This decrease in the proportion of saturated residues prevents the
membrane from becoming too rigid at the lower temperature.

In animals, cholesterol is the key regulator of membrane fluidity. Cholesterol contains a bulky steroid nucleus with a hydroxyl group at one end and
a flexible hydrocarbon tail at the other end. Cholesterol inserts into bilayers with its long axis perpendicular to the plane of the membrane. The
hydroxyl group of cholesterol forms a hydrogen bond with a carbonyl oxygen atom of a phospholipid head group, whereas the hydrocarbon tail of
cholesterol is located in the nonpolar core of the bilayer. The different shape
of cholesterol compared with phospholipids disrupts the regular interactions between fatty acyl chains. In addition, cholesterol appears to form specific complexes with some phospholipids. Such complexes may concentrate
in specific regions within membranes. One result of these interactions is the
moderation of membrane fluidity, making membranes less fluid but at the
same time less subject to phase transitions.

system pumps Na⫹ out of the cell and
K⫹ into the cell.

Membranes are structurally and functionally asymmetric. The outer and inner surfaces of all known biological membranes have different components and
different enzymatic activities. A clear-cut example is the pump that regulates
the concentration of Na⫹ and K⫹ ions in cells (Figure 12.34). This transport protein is located in the plasma membrane of nearly all cells in higher
organisms. The Na⫹-K⫹ pump is oriented so that it pumps Na⫹ out of the
cell and K⫹ into it. Furthermore, ATP must be on the inside of the cell to
drive the pump. Ouabain, a specific inhibitor of the pump, is effective only
if it is located outside.
Membrane proteins have a unique orientation because they are synthesized and inserted into the membrane in an asymmetric manner. This absolute asymmetry is preserved because membrane proteins do not rotate
from one side of the membrane to the other and because membranes are always synthesized by the growth of preexisting membranes. Lipids, too, are
asymmetrically distributed as a consequence of their mode of biosynthesis,
but this asymmetry is usually not absolute, except for glycolipids. In the
red-blood-cell membrane, sphingomyelin and phosphatidyl choline are
preferentially located in the outer leaflet of the bilayer, whereas phosphatidyl ethanolamine and phosphatidyl serine are located mainly in the inner leaflet. Large amounts of cholesterol are present in both leaflets.

12.7 EUKARYOTIC CELLS CONTAIN COMPARTMENTS
BOUNDED BY INTERNAL MEMBRANES
Thus far we have considered only the plasma membrane of cells. Many bacteria such as E. coli have two membranes separated by a cell wall (made of
proteins, peptides, and carbohydrates) lying in between (Figure 12.35). The
inner membrane acts as the permeability barrier, and the outer membrane and

Internal Compartments

the cell wall provide additional protection. The outer membrane is quite permeable to small molecules owing to the presence of porins. The region between the two membranes containing the cell wall is called the periplasm. Other
bacteria and archaea have only a single membrane surrounded by a cell wall.
Eukaryotic cells, with the exception of plant cells, do not have cell walls,
and their cell membranes consist of a single lipid bilayer. In plant cells, the
cell wall is on the outside of the plasma membrane. Eukaryotic cells are distinguished by the use of membranes inside the cell to form internal compartments (Figure 12.36). For example, peroxisomes, organelles that play a
major role in the oxidation of fatty acids for energy conversion, are defined
by a single membrane. Mitochondria, the organelles in which ATP is synthesized, are surrounded by two membranes. Much like the case for a bacterium, the outer membrane is quite permeable to small molecules, whereas
the inner membrane is not. Indeed, considerable evidence now indicates that
mitochondria evolved from bacteria by endosymbiosis (Section 18.12). A
double membrane also surrounds the nucleus. However, the nuclear envelope is not continuous but, instead, consists of a set of closed membranes
that come together at structures called nuclear pores. These pores regulate
transport into and out of the nucleus. The nuclear membranes are linked to
another membrane-defined structure, the endoplasmic reticulum, which
plays a host of cellular roles, including drug detoxification and the modification of proteins for secretion (Section 11.4.1). Thus, a eukaryotic cell comprises interacting compartments, and transport into and out of these compartments is essential to many biochemical processes.

12.7.1 Proteins Are Targeted to Specific Compartments
by Signal Sequences
The compartmentalization of eukaryotic cells makes possible many
processes that must be separated from the remainder of the cellular environment to function properly. Specific proteins are found in peroxisomes,
others in mitochondria, and still others in the nucleus. How do proteins end
up in the proper compartment? Even for bacteria, some targeting of proteins is required: some proteins are secreted from the cell, whereas others
remain in the cytosol.
Proteins include specific sequences that serve as address labels to direct
the molecules to the proper location. For example, most peroxisomal proteins end with a sequence, Ser-Lys-Leu-COO⫺ , that acts as an autonomous

resides in peroxisomes blocks its import into that organelle, whereas the addition of this sequence to a protein that normally resides in the cytosol can
direct that protein to peroxisomes. A protein destined to pass through both
mitochondrial membranes usually has a targeting sequence at its amino terminus (Figure 12.37). Unlike the peroxisomal targeting sequence, these
amino-terminal sequences are highly variable; no clear consensus exists.
They are typically from 15 to 35 residues long and rich in positively charged
residues and in serines and threonines. Proteins destined for the nucleus have
internal targeting sequences. A typical nuclear localization signal contains
five consecutive positively charged residues such as Lys-Lys-Lys-Arg-Lys.
The addition of such a sequence to a protein not found in the nucleus can
direct it to the nucleus (Figure 12.38). Other sequences can direct proteins
out of the nucleus. The known targeting sequences are given in Table 12.4.

Targeting sequences act by binding to specific proteins associated with
each organelle. The determination of the structure of a protein, ␣-karyopherin, that binds to the nuclear localization signal reveals how the protein
recognizes such a targeting sequence (Figure 12.39). A peptide containing
the appropriate sequence binds to a specific site on the protein. The target
peptide is held in an extended conformation through interactions between
the target peptide backbone and asparagine side chains of the ␣-karyopherin
while each of the basic residues lies in a deep pocket near the bottom, lined
with negatively charged residues. Proteins that bind to the other targeting
signal sequences presumably also have structures that allow recognition of

marked for different compartments. Later, we will consider the mechanisms
by which proteins actually cross membranes (Section 29.x.x).

Summary

12.7.2 Membrane Budding and Fusion Underlie Several
Important Biological Processes
Membranes must be able to separate or join together to take up, transport, and
release molecules. Many take up molecules through the process of receptormediated endocytosis (Figure 12.40). Here, a protein or larger complex initially
binds to a receptor on the cell surface. After the protein is
bound, specialized proteins act to cause the membrane in
the vicinity of the bound protein to invaginate. The inLDL
vaginated membrane eventually breaks off and fuses to
receptors

structures of the intermediates in the budding and fusing processes and the
detailed mechanisms remain active areas of investigation.

Many Common Features Underlie the Diversity of Biological Membranes

Biological membranes are sheetlike structures, typically from 60 to
100 Å thick, that are composed of protein and lipid molecules held together by noncovalent interactions. Membranes are highly selective permeability barriers. They create closed compartments, which may be entire cells or organelles within a cell. Proteins in membranes regulate the
molecular and ionic compositions of these compartments. Membranes
also control the flow of information between cells.

•

Fatty Acids Are Key Constituents of Lipids

Fatty acids are hydrocarbon chains of various lengths and degrees of unsaturation that terminate with a carboxylic acid group. The fatty acid
chains in membranes usually contain between 14 and 24 carbon atoms;
they may be saturated or unsaturated. Short chain length and unsaturation enhance the fluidity of fatty acids and their derivatives by lowering the melting temperature.

CHAPTER 12 • Lipids and Cell Membranes

• There Are Three Common Types of Membrane Lipids

The major classes of membrane lipids are phospholipids, glycolipids,
and cholesterol. Phosphoglycerides, a type of phospholipid, consist of a
glycerol backbone, two fatty acid chains, and a phosphorylated alcohol.
Phosphatidyl choline, phosphatidyl serine, and phosphatidyl ethanolamine are major phosphoglycerides. Sphingomyelin, a different type
of phospholipid, contains a sphingosine backbone instead of glycerol.
Glycolipids are sugar-containing lipids derived from sphingosine. Cholesterol, which modulates membrane fluidity, is constructed from a
steroid nucleus. A common feature of these membrane lipids is that they
are amphipathic molecules, having hydrophobic and hydrophilic ends.

• Phospholipids and Glycolipids Readily Form Bimolecular Sheets
in Aqueous Media

Membrane lipids spontaneously form extensive bimolecular sheets in
aqueous solutions. The driving force for membrane formation is the
hydrophobic interactions among the fatty acid tails of membrane lipids.
The hydrophilic head groups interact with the aqueous medium. Lipid
bilayers are cooperative structures, held together by many weak bonds.
These lipid bilayers are highly impermeable to ions and most polar molecules, yet they are quite fluid, which enables them to act as a solvent
for membrane proteins.

• Proteins Carry Out Most Membrane Processes
Specific proteins mediate distinctive membrane functions such as transport, communication, and energy transduction. Many integral membrane proteins span the lipid bilayer, whereas others are partly embedded in the membrane. Peripheral membrane proteins are bound to
membrane surfaces by electrostatic and hydrogen-bond interactions.
Membrane-spanning proteins have regular structures, including ␤
strands, although the ␣ helix is the most common membrane-spanning
domain. Indeed, sequences of 20 consecutive nonpolar amino acids can
be diagnostic of a membrane-spanning ␣-helical region of a protein.

• Lipids and Many Membrane Proteins Diffuse Rapidly in the Plane
of the Membrane

Membranes are structurally and functionally asymmetric, as exemplified by the restriction of sugar residues to the external surface of mammalian plasma membranes. Membranes are dynamic structures in which
proteins and lipids diffuse rapidly in the plane of the membrane (lateral
diffusion), unless restricted by special interactions. In contrast, the rotation of lipids from one face of a membrane to the other (transverse diffusion, or flip-flop) is usually very slow. Proteins do not rotate across bilayers; hence, membrane asymmetry can be preserved. The degree of
fluidity of a membrane partly depends on the chain length of its lipids
and the extent to which their constituent fatty acids are unsaturated. In
animals, cholesterol content also regulates membrane fluidity.

• Eukaryotic Cells Contain Compartments Bounded by Internal Membranes
An extensive array of internal membranes in eukaryotes creates compartments within a cell for distinct biochemical functions. For instance, a double membrane surrounds the nucleus, the location of most of the cell’s genetic material, and the mitochondria, the location of most ATP synthesis.
A single membrane defines the other internal compartments, such as the
endoplasmic reticulum. Some compartments can exchange material by the
process of membrane budding and fusion. As with all membranes, the
proteins associated with these membranes determine the specific biochemical function. Specific amino acid sequences in the proteins direct
these molecules to the appropriate compartment.

and release the ion on the other side. The conductance of a lipidbilayer membrane containing a carrier antibiotic decreased abruptly when the temperature was lowered from 40°C to 36°C. In contrast, there was little change in conductance of the same bilayer

Lipids and Cell Membranes

The surface of a soap bubble is a bilayer formed by detergent molecules. The polar
heads (red) pack together leaving the hydrophobic groups (green) in contact with air on
the inside and outside of the bubble. Other bilayer structures define the boundary of a cell.
[(Left) Photonica.]

The boundaries of cells are formed by biological membranes, the barriers that
define the inside and the outside of a cell (Figure 12.1). These barriers prevent
molecules generated inside the cell from leaking out and unwanted molecules from diffusing in; yet they also contain

gated channel in that the channel opens in response to the binding of acetylcholine (Figure 13.1). In contrast, the sodium and potassium channels,
which mediate action potentials in neuron axon membranes, are opened by
membrane depolarization rather than by the binding of an allosteric effector. These channels are voltage-gated. These channels are also of interest
because they swiftly and deftly distinguish between quite similar ions (e.g.,
Na and K). The flow of ions through a single channel in a membrane
can readily be detected by using the patch-clamp technique.
The chapter concludes with a view of a different kind of channel—the
cell-to-cell channel, or gap junction. These channels allow the transport of
ions and metabolites between cells.

13.1 THE TRANSPORT OF MOLECULES
ACROSS A MEMBRANE MAY BE ACTIVE OR PASSIVE
Before we consider the specifics of membrane-protein function, we will
consider some general principles of membrane transport. Two factors
determine whether a molecule will cross a membrane: (1) the permeability of the molecule in a lipid bilayer and (2) the availability of an energy
source.
13.1.1 Many Molecules Require Protein Transporters
to Cross Membranes
As discussed in Chapter 12, some molecules can pass through cell membranes because they dissolve in the lipid bilayer. Such molecules are called
lipophilic molecules. The steroid hormones provide a physiological example.
These cholesterol relatives can pass through a membrane in their path of
movement, but what determines the direction in which they will move? Such
molecules will pass through a membrane located down their concentration
gradient in a process called simple diffusion. In accord with the Second Law
of Thermodynamics, molecules spontaneously move from a region of higher
concentration to one of lower concentration. Thus, in this case, an entropy
increase powers transport across the membrane.
Matters become more complicated when the molecule is highly polar.
For example, sodium ions are present at 143 mM outside the cell and
14 mM inside the cell, yet sodium does not freely enter the cell because the
positively charged ion cannot pass through the hydrophobic membrane interior. In some circumstances, as during a nerve impulse (Section 13.5.3),
sodium ions must enter the cell. How are they able to do so? Sodium ions
pass through specific channels in the hydrophobic barrier formed by membrane proteins. This means of crossing the membrane is called facilitated
diffusion, because the diffusion across the membrane is facilitated by the
channel. It is also called passive transport, because the energy driving the
ion movement originates from the ion gradient itself, without any contribution by the transport system. Channels, like enzymes, display substrate
specificity.
How is the sodium gradient established in the first place? In this case,
sodium must move, or be pumped, against a concentration gradient. Because moving the ion from a low concentration to a higher concentration results in a decrease in entropy, it requires an input of free energy. Protein
transporters embedded in the membrane are capable of using an energy
source to move the molecule up a concentration gradient. Because an input
of energy from another source is required, this means of crossing the membrane is called active transport.

13.1.2 Free Energy Stored in Concentration Gradients
Can Be Quantified
An unequal distribution of molecules is an energy-rich condition because
free energy is minimized when all concentrations are equal. Consequently,
to attain such an unequal distribution of molecules, called a concentration
gradient, requires an input of free energy. In fact, the creation of a concentration gradient is the result of active transport. Can we quantify the amount
of energy required to generate a concentration gradient (Figure 13.2)? Consider an uncharged solute molecule. The free-energy change in transporting this species from side 1, where it is present at a concentration of c1, to
side 2, where it is present at concentration c2, is

in which Z is the electrical charge of the transported species, V is the potential in volts across the membrane, and F is the faraday [23.1 kcal V1

A transport process must be active when G is positive, whereas it can
be passive when G is negative. For example, consider the transport of an
uncharged molecule from c1  103 M to c2  101 M.

At 25°C (298 K), G is  2.7 kcal mol1 (11.3 kJ mol1), indicating
that this transport process requires an input of free energy. It could be
driven, for example, by the hydrolysis of ATP, which yields 12 kcal
mol1 (50.2 kJ mol1) under typical cellular conditions. If G is negative, the transport process can occur spontaneously without free-energy
input.
Ion gradients are important energy storage forms in all biological systems. For instance, bacteriorhodopsin (Section 12.4.2) generates a proton
gradient at the expense of light energy, an example of active transport. The
energy of the proton gradient in turn can be converted into chemical energy
in the form of ATP. This example illustrates the use of membranes and
membrane proteins to transform energy: from light energy into an ion gradient into chemical energy.

13.2 A FAMILY OF MEMBRANE PROTEINS USES ATP
HYDROLYSIS TO PUMP IONS ACROSS MEMBRANES
The extracellular fluid of animal cells has a salt concentration similar to that
of sea water. However, cells must control their intracellular salt concentrations to prevent unfavorable interactions with high concentrations of ions
such as calcium and to facilitate specific processes. For instance, most animal cells contain a high concentration of K and a low concentration of Na
relative to the external medium. These ionic gradients are generated by a
specific transport system, an enzyme that is called the Na-K pump or the

For a charged species, the unequal distribution across the membrane generates
an electrical potential that also must be considered because the ions will be repelled by the like charges. The sum of the concentration and electrical terms is
called the electrochemical potential. The free-energy change is then given by

Na-K ATPase. The hydrolysis of ATP by the pump provides the energy
needed for the active transport of Na out of the cell and K into the cell,
generating the gradient. The pump is called the Na-K ATPase because
the hydrolysis of ATP occurs only when Na and K are bound to the
pump. Moreover, this ATPase, like all such enzymes, requires Mg2 (Section 9.4.2). The active transport of Na and K is of great physiological significance. Indeed, more than a third of the ATP consumed by a resting animal is used to pump these ions. The Na-K gradient in animal cells
controls cell volume, renders neurons and muscle cells electrically excitable,
and drives the active transport of sugars and amino acids.
The subsequent purification of other ion pumps has revealed a large
family of evolutionarily related ion pumps including proteins from
bacteria, archaea, and all eukaryotes. These pumps are specific for an array
of ions. Of particular interest are the Ca2 ATPase, the enzyme that transports Ca2 out of the cytoplasm and into the sarcoplasmic reticulum of muscle cells, and the gastric H-K ATPase, the enzyme responsible for pumping sufficient protons into the stomach to lower the pH below 1.0. These
enzymes and the hundreds of known homologs, including the Na-K
ATPase, are referred to as P-type ATPases because they form a key phosphorylated intermediate. In the formation of this intermediate, a phosphoryl group obtained from the hydrolysis of ATP is linked to the side chain
of a specific conserved aspartate residue in the ATPase (Figure 13.3).
13.2.1 The Sarcoplasmic Reticulum Ca2 ATPase Is an
Integral Membrane Protein

FIGURE 13.4 Structure of SR
Ca2 ATPase. This enzyme, the calcium
pump of the sarcoplasmic reticulum,
comprises a membrane-spanning domain
of 10 helices and a cytoplasmic headpiece
consisting of three domains (N, P, and A).
Two calcium ions (green) bind within the
membrane-spanning region. The aspartate
residue characteristic of this protein family
is indicated.

We will consider the structural and mechanistic features of these enzymes
by examining the Ca2 ATPase found in the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR
Ca2 ATPase) of muscle cells. This enzyme, which constitutes 80% of the
sarcoplasmic reticulum membrane protein, plays an important role in muscle contraction, which is triggered by an abrupt rise in the cytosolic calcium
level. Muscle relaxation depends on the rapid removal of Ca2 from the
cytosol into the sarcoplasmic reticulum, a specialized compartment for calcium storage, by the SR Ca2 ATPase. This pump maintains a Ca2 concentration of approximately 0.1 M in the cytosol compared with 1.5 mM
in the sarcoplasmic reticulum.
The SR Ca2 ATPase is a single 110-kd polypeptide with a transmembrane domain consisting of 10 helices. A large cytoplasmic head piece
constitutes nearly half the molecular weight of the protein and consists of
three distinct domains (Figure 13.4). The three cytoplasmic domains of the
SR Ca2 ATPase have distinct functions. One domain (N) binds the ATP
nucleotide, another (P) accepts the phosphoryl group on its conserved aspartate residue, and the third (A) may serve as an actuator for the N domain. The relation between these three domains changes significantly on
ATP hydrolysis. The crystal structure in the absence of ATP shows the
likely nucleotide-binding site separated by more than 25 Å from the phosphorylation site, suggesting that the N and P domains move toward one another during the catalytic cycle. This closure is facilitated by ATP binding
and by the binding of Ca2 to the membrane-spanning helices.
The results of mechanistic studies of the SR Ca2 ATPase and other
P-type ATPases have revealed two common features. First, as we have seen,
each protein can be phosphorylated on a specific aspartate residue. For the SR
Ca2 ATPase, this reaction takes place at Asp 351 only in the presence of relatively high cytosolic concentrations of Ca2. Second, each pump can interconvert between at least two different conformations, denoted by E1 and E2.
Thus, at least four conformational states—E1, E1-P, E2-P, and E2—participate

in the transport process. From these four states, it is possible to construct a
plausible mechanism of action for these enzymes, although further studies are
necessary to confirm the mechanism and provide more details (Figure 13.5):
1. The postulated reaction cycle begins with the binding of ATP and two
Ca2 ions to the E1 state.
2. The enzyme cleaves ATP, transferring the -phosphoryl group to the
key aspartate residue. Calcium must be bound to the enzyme for the phosphorylation to take place. Phosphorylation shifts the conformational equilibrium of the ATPase toward E2.
3. The transition from the E1 to the E2 state causes the ion-binding sites to
“evert” so that the ions can dissociate only to the luminal side of the membrane.
4. In the E2-P state, the enzyme has low affinity for the Ca2 ions, so they
are released.
5. With the release of Ca2, the phosphoaspartate residue is hydrolyzed,
and the phosphate group is released.
6. The enzyme, devoid of a covalently attached phosphoryl group, is not
stable in the E2 form. It everts back to the E1 form, completing the cycle.
Essentially the same mechanism is employed by the Na-K ATPase.
The E1 state binds three Na ions and transports them across the membrane and out of the cell as a result of the protein’s phosphorylation and
transition to the E2 state. The three Na ions are released into the extracellular medium. The E2 state of this enzyme also binds ions—namely, two
K ions. These K ions are carried across the membrane in the opposite direction by eversion driven by the hydrolysis of the phosphoaspartate residue
and are released into the cytosol.
The change in free energy accompanying the transport of Na and K
can be calculated (Section 13.1.1). Suppose that the concentration of Na
outside and inside the cell is 143 and 14 mM, respectively, and that of
K is 4 and 157 mM. At a membrane potential of 50 mV and a temperature of 37 °C, the free-energy change in transporting 3 moles of Na out
of and 2 moles of K into the cell is 10.0 kcal (41.8 kJ mol1). The hydrolysis of a single ATP per transport cycle provides sufficient free energy,
about 12 kcal mol1 (50 kJ mol1) under cellular conditions, to drive
the uphill transport of these ions.

and the phosphorylation of the ATPase
(steps 1 and 2), illustrated here for the
Ca2 ATPase, lead to the eversion of the
binding sites (step 3) and the release of
Ca2 to the luminal side of the membrane
(step 4). Hydrolysis of phosphoaspartate
(step 5) and eversion (step 6) reset the
enzyme to its initial state.

Wide Range of Roles

Flippase

ATP + H2O

Analysis of the complete yeast genome revealed the presence of 16
proteins that clearly belong to the P-type ATPase family. More detailed sequence analysis suggests that 2 of these proteins transport H ions,
2 transport Ca2, 3 transport Na, and 2 transport metals such as Cu2.
In addition, 5 members of this family appear to participate in the transport
of phospholipids with amino acid head groups. These latter proteins assist
in the maintenance of membrane asymmetry by transporting lipids such as
phosphatidyl serine from the outer to the inner leaflet of the bilayer membrane (Figure 13.6). Such enzymes have been termed “flippases.”
All members of this protein family employ the same fundamental mechanism. The free energy of ATP hydrolysis drives membrane transport by
effecting conformational changes associated with the addition and removal
of a phosphoryl group at an analogous aspartate site in each protein.

Certain steroids derived from plants are potent inhibitors (Ki  10 nM) of
the Na-K pump. Digitoxigenin and ouabain are members of this class of
inhibitors, which are known as cardiotonic steroids because of their strong
effects on the heart (Figure 13.7). These compounds inhibit the dephosphorylation of the E2-P form of the ATPase when applied on the extracellular face of the membrane.

steroids such as digitoxigenin inhibit the NaK pump by blocking the dephosphorylation

Digitalis, a mixture of cardiotonic steroids derived from the dried
leaf of the foxglove plant (Digitalis purpurea), is of great clinical significance. Digitalis increases the force of contraction of heart muscle, which
makes it a choice drug in the treatment of congestive heart failure. Inhibition of the Na-K pump by digitalis leads to a higher level of Na inside
the cell. The diminished Na gradient results in slower extrusion of Ca2
by the sodium–calcium exchanger (Section 13.4). The subsequent increase
in the intracellular level of Ca2 enhances the contractility of cardiac muscle. It is interesting to note that digitalis was effectively used long before the
discovery of the Na-K ATPase. In 1785, William Withering, a British
physician, heard tales of an elderly woman, known as “the old woman of
Shropshire,” who cured people of “dropsy” (which today would be recognized as congestive heart failure) with an extract of foxglove. Withering conducted the first scientific study of the effects of foxglove on congestive heart
failure and documented its effectiveness.

13.3 MULTIDRUG RESISTANCE AND CYSTIC FIBROSIS
HIGHLIGHT A FAMILY OF MEMBRANE PROTEINS
WITH ATP-BINDING CASSETTE DOMAINS
Tumor cells in culture often become resistant to drugs that were
initially quite toxic to the cells. Remarkably, the development of resistance to one drug also makes the cells less sensitive to a range of other
compounds. This phenomenon is known as multidrug resistance. In a significant discovery, the onset of multidrug resistance was found to correlate
with the expression and activity of a membrane protein with an apparent
molecular mass of 170 kd. This protein acts as an ATP-dependent pump
that extrudes a wide range of small molecules from cells that express it.
The protein is called the multidrug resistance protein (MDR) or P-glycoprotein (“glyco” because it includes a carbohydrate moiety). Thus, when
cells are exposed to a drug, the MDR pumps the drug out of the cell before the drug can exert its effects. A related protein was discovered through
genetic studies of the hereditary disease cystic fibrosis (Section 1.1.4). In one
of the first studies leading to the identification of a specific genetic change
causing human disease, investigators performed a comparative genetic
analysis of many people having this disease and family members who did
not have the disease. The gene found to be mutated in the affected persons
encodes a protein, now called cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR). CFTR acts as an ATP-regulated chloride channel in the
plasma membranes of epithelial cells. As mentioned in Chapter 1, cystic
fibrosis results from a decrease in fluid and salt secretion by CFTR. As a
consequence of this defect, secretion from the pancreas is blocked and
heavy, dehydrated mucus accumulates in the lungs, leading to chronic lung
infections.
Analysis of the amino acid sequences of MDR, CFTR, and homologous proteins revealed a common architecture (Figure 13.8). Each
protein comprises four domains: two membrane-binding domains of unknown structure and two ATP-binding domains. The ATP-binding domains of these proteins are called ATP-binding cassettes (or ABCs) and are
homologous to domains in a large family of transport proteins of bacteria
and archaea. Indeed, with 79 members, the ABC proteins are the largest
single family identified in the E. coli genome. The ABC proteins are members of the P-loop NTPase superfamily (Section 9.4.4). Some ABC proteins,
particularly those of prokaryotes, are multisubunit proteins constructed
such that the membrane-spanning domains and the ABC domains are present on separate polypeptide chains. The consolidation of enzymatic activities of several polypeptide chains in prokaryotes to a single chain in
eukaryotes is a theme that we will see again (Section 22.4.4). For example,
the histidine permease of Salmonella typhimurium, which transports the
amino acid histidine into the bacterium, consists of (1) two different protein subunits with membrane-spanning domains (HisQ and HisM) and (2)
a homodimeric protein (HisP) with ABC domains (Figure 13.9). A soluble,
histidine-binding protein (HisJ) binds histidine after the amino acid enters
the cell.
Like other members of the P-loop NTPase superfamily, proteins with
ABC domains undergo conformational changes on ATP binding and hydrolysis. These structural changes are coupled within each dimeric transporter unit in a manner that allows these membrane proteins to drive the
uptake or efflux of specific compounds or to act as gates for open membrane
channels.

FIGURE 13.10 Secondary transporters.
These transporters employ the downhill
flow of one gradient to power the
formation of another gradient. In
antiporters, the chemical species move
in opposite directions. In symporters, the
two species move in the same direction.

13.4 SECONDARY TRANSPORTERS USE ONE
CONCENTRATION GRADIENT TO POWER THE
FORMATION OF ANOTHER
Many active-transport processes are not directly driven by the hydrolysis
of ATP. Instead, the thermodynamically uphill flow of one species of ion
or molecule is coupled to the downhill flow of a different species. Membrane proteins that pump ions or molecules uphill by this means are termed
secondary transporters or cotransporters. These proteins can be classified as
either antiporters or symporters. Antiporters couple the downhill flow of one
species to the uphill flow of another in the opposite direction across the membrane; symporters use the flow of one species to drive the flow of a different species in the same direction across the membrane (Figure 13.10).
The sodium–calcium exchanger in the plasma membrane of an animal cell
is an antiporter that uses the electrochemical gradient of Na to pump Ca2
out of the cell. Three Na ions enter the cell for each Ca2 ion that is extruded. The cost of transport by this exchanger is paid by the Na-KATPase pump, which generates the requisite sodium gradient. Because
Ca2 is a vital messenger inside the cell, its concentration must be tightly
controlled. The exchanger has lower affinity for Ca2 than does the
Ca2ATPase (Section 13.2.1), but its capacity to extrude Ca2 is greater.
The exchanger can lower the cytosolic Ca2 level to several micromolar;
submicromolar Ca2 levels are attained by the subsequent action of the
Ca2 ATPase. The exchanger can extrude about 2000 Ca2 ions per second, compared with only 30 ions per second for the Ca2-ATPase pump.
Glucose is pumped into some animal cells by a symporter powered by
the simultaneous entry of Na. The entry of Na provides a free-energy
input of 2.2 kcal mol1 (9.2 kJ mol1) under typical cellular conditions (external [Na]  143 mM, internal [Na]  14 mM, and membrane potential  50 mV). This free-energy input is sufficient to generate a 66-fold
concentration gradient of an uncharged molecule such as glucose.
Secondary transporters are ancient molecular machines, common
today in bacteria and archaea as well as in eukaryotes. For example,
approximately 160 (of approximately 4000) proteins encoded by the E. coli
genome appear to be secondary transporters. Sequence comparison and hydropathy analysis suggest that members of the largest family have 12 transmembrane helices that appear to have arisen by duplication and fusion of a
membrane protein with 6 transmembrane helices. Included in this family
is the lactose permease of E. coli. This symporter uses the H gradient across
the E. coli membrane generated by the oxidation of fuel molecules to drive
the uptake of lactose and other sugars against a concentration gradient. The
permease has a proton-binding site and a lactose-binding site (Figure 13.11).

A proton and a lactose molecule bind to sites facing the outside of the cell.
The permease, with both binding sites full, everts, releasing first the proton and then the lactose inside the bacterium. Another eversion places the
empty sites on the outside. Thus, the energetically uphill transfer of one lactose molecule is coupled to the downhill transport of one proton. Further
analysis of the three-dimensional structures is underway and should provide more information about their mechanisms of action as well as the evolutionary relationships within this large group of ancient proteins.
These observations reveal how different energy currencies are interconverted. A single energy currency, ATP, is used by P-type ATPases to generate gradients of a small number of types of ions, particularly Na and H,
across membranes. These gradients then serve as an energy source for the
large number of secondary transporters, which allow many different molecules to be taken up or transported out of cells (Figure 13.12).

13.5 SPECIFIC CHANNELS CAN RAPIDLY TRANSPORT
IONS ACROSS MEMBRANES
Pumps and secondary transporters can transport ions at rates approaching
several thousand ions per second. Other membrane proteins, ion channels,
which are passive transport systems, are capable of ion-transport rates that
are more than 1000 times as high. These rates of transport through ion channels are close to rates expected for ions diffusing freely through aqueous solution. Yet, ion channels are not simply tubes that span membranes through
which ions can rapidly flow. Instead, they are highly sophisticated molecular machines that respond to chemical and physical changes in their environments and undergo precisely timed conformational changes that facilitate their roles as essential components of the nervous and other systems.
Several key properties characterize ion channels:
1. Ion channels can be highly selective for particular ions. For example, some
channels allow the flow of K very effectively but do not allow appreciable
levels of Na to cross the membrane. Other channels transport positively
charged ions (cations), but block the flow of negatively charged ions (anions). The selectivities of some ion-channel proteins are shown in Table 13.1.
2. Ion channels exist in open and closed states. These channels undergo transitions from the closed state, incapable of supporting ion transport, to the
open state, through which ions can flow.
3. Transitions between the open and the closed states are regulated. Ion channels are divided into two classes: ligand-gated channels and voltage-gated

converts the free energy of phosphoryl
transfer into the free energy of a Na ion
gradient. The ion gradient can then be used
to pump materials into the cell, through
the action of a secondary transporter such
as the Na-glucose symporter.

channels. Ligand-gated channels open and close in response to the binding
of specific chemicals, whereas voltage-gated channels open and close in response to the electrical potential across the membrane in which they are
found.

FIGURE 13.13 Patch-clamp modes.
The patch-clamp technique for monitoring
channel activity is highly versatile. A highresistance seal (gigaseal) is formed
between the pipette and a small patch of
plasma membrane. This configuration is
called cell attached. The breaking of the
membrane patch by increased suction
produces a low-resistance pathway between
the pipette and interior of the cell. The
activity of the channels in the entire
plasma membrane can be monitored in
this whole-cell mode. To prepare a
membrane in the excised-patch mode, the
pipette is pulled away from the cell. A
piece of plasma membrane with its
cytosolic side now facing the medium is
monitored by the patch pipette.

4. Open states of channels often spontaneously convert into inactivated states.
Most ion channels do not remain in an open state indefinitely but, instead,
spontaneously transform into inactivated states that do not conduct ions.
The spontaneous transitions of ion channels from open to inactivated states
act as built-in timers that determine the duration of ion flow.
13.5.1 Patch-Clamp Conductance Measurements Reveal the
Activities of Single Channels
The study of ion channels has been revolutionized by the patch-clamp technique, which was introduced by Erwin Neher and Bert Sakmann in 1976
(Figure 13.13). This powerful technique enables the measurement of the activity of a single channel to be measured. A clean glass pipette with a tip diameter of about 1 m is pressed against an intact cell to form a seal. Slight
suction leads to the formation of a very tight seal so that the resistance between the inside of the pipette and the bathing solution is many gigaohms
(1 gigaohm is equal to 109 ohms). Thus, a gigaohm seal (called a gigaseal)

ensures that an electric current flowing through the pipette is identical with
the current flowing through the membrane covered by the pipette. The gigaseal makes possible high-resolution current measurements while a known
voltage is applied across the membrane. In fact, patch clamping increased
the precision of such measurements 100-fold. The flow of ions through a single channel and transitions between the open and closed states of a channel can
be monitored with a time resolution of microseconds. Furthermore, the activity of a channel in its native membrane environment, even in an intact cell,
can be directly observed. Patch-clamp methods provided one of the first
views of single biomolecules in action. Subsequently, other methods for observing single molecules were invented, opening new vistas on biochemistry
at its most fundamental level.

Ion Channels

13.5.2 Ion-Channel Proteins Are Built of Similar Units
How do ion channels, vital to a wide array of biological functions, operate
at a molecular level? We will examine three channels important in the propagation of nerve impulses: the ligand-gated channel; the acetylcholine receptor channel, which communicates the nerve impulse between certain
neurons; and the voltage-gated Na and K channels, which conduct the
nerve impulse down the axon of a neuron.
Nerve impulses are communicated across most synapses by small, diffusible molecules called neurotransmitters, of which one is acetylcholine, referred to as a cholinergic neurotransmitter because it is derived from
choline (Section 12.2.1). The presynaptic membrane of a synapse is separated from the postsynaptic membrane by a gap of about 50 nm, called the
synaptic cleft. The end of the presynaptic axon is filled with synaptic vesicles, each containing about 104 acetylcholine molecules (Figure 13.14).
The arrival of a nerve impulse leads to the synchronous export of the contents of some 300 vesicles, which raises the acetylcholine concentration in
the cleft from 10 nM to 500 M in less than a millisecond. The binding of
acetylcholine to the postsynaptic membrane markedly changes its ionic
permeabilities (Figure 13.15). The conductance of both Na and K increases greatly within 0.1 ms, leading to a large inward current of Na and
a smaller outward current of K. The inward Na current depolarizes the
postsynaptic membrane and triggers an action potential (Section 13.5.3).
Acetylcholine opens a single kind of cation channel, which is almost equally
permeable to Na and K. This change in ion permeability is mediated by
the acetylcholine receptor.
The acetylcholine receptor is the best-understood ligand-gated channel.
The activity of a single such channel is graphically displayed in patch-clamp

recordings of postsynaptic membranes of skeletal muscle (Figure 13.16).
The addition of acetylcholine is followed by transient openings of the channel. The current, i, flowing through an open channel is 4 pA (picoamperes)
when the membrane potential, V, is 100 mV. An ampere is the flow of
6.24  1018 charges per second. Hence, 2.5  107 ions per second flow
through an open channel.
The electric organ of Torpedo marmorata, an electric fish, is a choice
source of acetylcholine receptors for study because its electroplaxes (voltage-generating cells) are very rich in cholinergic postsynaptic membranes.
The receptor is very densely packed in these membranes (20,000/m2).
An exotic biological material has been invaluable in the isolation of acetylcholine receptors. Snake neurotoxins such as -bungarotoxin (from the
venom of a Formosan snake) and cobratoxin block the transmission of impulses between nerve and muscle. These small (7-kd) basic proteins bind
specifically and very tightly to acetylcholine receptors and hence can be used
as tags.
The acetylcholine receptor of the electric organ has been solubilized
by adding a nonionic detergent to a postsynaptic membrane preparation and purified by affinity chromatography on a column bearing covalently attached cobratoxin. With the use of techniques presented in Chapter 4, the 268-kd receptor was identified as a pentamer of four kinds of
membrane-spanning subunits— 2, , , and —arranged in the form of a
ring that creates a pore through the membrane (Figure 13.17). The cloning
and sequencing of the cDNAs for the four kinds of subunits (50–58 kd)
showed that they have clearly similar sequences; the genes for the , , ,
and  subunits arose by duplication and divergence of a common ancestral
gene. Each subunit has a large extracellular domain, followed at the carboxyl end by four predominantly hydrophobic segments that span the bilayer membrane. Acetylcholine binds at the – and – interfaces. Electron microscopic studies of purified acetylcholine receptors demonstrated
that the structure has approximately fivefold symmetry, in harmony with
the similarity of its five constituent subunits.
What is the basis of channel opening? A comparison of the structures of
the closed and open forms of the channel would be highly revealing, but such
comparisons have been difficult to obtain. Cryoelectron micrographs indicate
that the binding of acetylcholine to the extracellular domain causes a structural alteration, which initiates rotations of the -helical rods lining the
membrane-spanning pore. The amino acid sequences of these helices point
to the presence of alternating ridges of small polar or neutral residues (serine,
threonine, glycine) and large nonpolar ones (isoleucine, leucine, phenylalanine). In the closed state, the large residues may occlude the channel by forming a tight hydrophobic ring (Figure 13.18). Indeed, each subunit has a bulky

by small polar residues rather than by large hydrophobic ones. The wider,
more polar pore would then be open to the passage of Na and K ions.

We turn now from ligand-gated channels to voltage-gated channels, which
are responsible for the propagation of nerve impulses. A nerve impulse is an
electrical signal produced by the flow of ions across the plasma membrane
of a neuron and is the fundamental means of communication in the nervous system. The interior of a neuron, like that of most other cells, has a high
concentration of K and a low concentration of Na . These ionic gradients
are generated by an ATP-driven pump (Section 13.2.1). In the resting
state, the membrane potential is 60 mV. A nerve impulse, or action potential, is generated when the membrane potential is depolarized beyond
a critical threshold value (i.e., from 60 to 40 mV). The membrane potential becomes positive within about a millisecond and attains a value of
about 30 mV before turning negative again. This amplified depolarization is propagated along the nerve terminal (Figure 13.19)
Ingenious experiments carried out by Alan Hodgkin and Andrew Huxley revealed that action potentials arise from large, transient changes in the
permeability of the axon membrane to Na and K ions (see Figure 13.19A).
Two kinds of voltage-sensitive channels, one selectively permeable to Na
and the other to K , were defined. The conductance of the membrane to
Na changes first. Depolarization of the membrane beyond the threshold
level leads to an opening of Na channels. Sodium ions begin to flow into

the cell because of the large electrochemical gradient across the plasma
membrane. The entry of Na further depolarizes the membrane, and so
more gates for Na are opened. This positive feedback between depolarization and Na entry leads to a very rapid and large change in membrane
potential, from about 60 mV to 30 mV in a millisecond.
Sodium channels spontaneously close and potassium channels begin to
open at about this time (see Figure 13.19B). Consequently, potassium ions
flow outward, and so the membrane potential returns to a negative value.
The resting level of 60 mV is restored in a few milliseconds as the K conductance decreases to the value characteristic of the unstimulated state.
Only a very small proportion of the sodium and potassium ions in a nerve
cell, of the order of one in a million, flows across the plasma membrane during the action potential. Clearly, the action potential is a very efficient means
of signaling over large distances.

Tetrodotoxin

A puffer fish is regarded as a culinary
delicacy in Japan. [Fred Bavendam/
Peter Arnold.]

Like the acetylcholine receptor channel, the sodium channel also was purified on the basis of its ability to bind a specific neurotoxin. Tetrodotoxin,
an organic compound isolated from the puffer fish, binds to sodium channels with great avidity (Ki  1 nM). The lethal dose of this poison for an
adult human being is about 10 ng. The sodium channel was first purified
from the electric organ of electric eel, which is a rich source of the protein
forming this channel. The isolated protein is a single chain of 260 kd.
The availability of purified protein enabled Shosaku Numa and
coworkers to clone and sequence the cDNA for the sodium channel
from the electroplax cells of the eel electric organ and then from the rat. Subsequently, a large number of sodium channel cDNAs have been cloned from
other sources, and sequence comparisons have been made. The eel and rat
cDNA sequences are approximately 61% identical, which indicates that the
amino acid sequence of the sodium channel has been conserved over a long
evolutionary period. Most interesting, the channel contains four internal repeats, or homology units, having similar amino acid sequences, suggesting
that gene duplication and divergence have produced the gene for this channel. Hydrophobicity profiles indicate that each homology unit contains five
hydrophobic segments (S1, S2, S3, S5, and S6). Each repeat also contains a
highly positively charged S4 segment; arginine or lysine residues are present
at nearly every third residue. Numa proposed that segments S1 through S6 are
membrane-spanning  helices (Figure 13.20). The positively charged residues
in S4 segments act as the voltage sensors of the channel. The purification of
calcium channels and the subsequent cloning and sequencing of their cDNAs
revealed that these proteins are homologous to the sodium channels and have
quite similar architectures; each protein comprises four imperfectly repeated
units, each of which has regions corresponding to segments S1 through S6.

We can thus note similarities between ligand-gated and voltage-gated
channels. Like the acetylcholine receptor, the sodium channel is constructed
of similar units. The acetylcholine receptor has five units, whereas the
sodium channel has four units that have been fused into a single polypeptide chain. The acetylcholine receptor is composed of similar but noncovalently attached subunits.

13.5.5 Potassium Channels Are Homologous to the
Sodium Channel
The purification of potassium channels proved to be much more
difficult because of their low abundance and the lack of known highaffinity ligands comparable to tetrodotoxin. The breakthrough came in
studies of mutant fruit flies that shake violently when anesthetized with
ether. The mapping and cloning of the gene, termed shaker, responsible for
this defect revealed the amino acid sequence encoded by a potassiumchannel gene. The availability of this gene sequence has led to the cloning
of potassium-channel cDNAs from many other organisms. Shaker cDNA
encodes a 70-kd protein that has regions that correspond to one of the homology units of the sodium channel containing the membrane-spanning
segments S1 through S6. Thus, a potassium-channel subunit is homologous
to one of the repeated homology units of the sodium and calcium channels.
Consistent with this hypothesis, four potassium-channel subunits come together to form a functional channel. Subsequently, other potassium channels were discovered, including some from bacteria, which contain only the
two membrane-spanning regions corresponding to segments S5 and S6.
This and other information pointed to the region between S5 and S6 as a key
component of the ion-channel pore in the potassium channel and in the sodium
and calcium channels as well. The sequence relationships between these ion
channels are summarized in Figure 13.21.

13.5.6 The Structure of a Potassium Channel Reveals the Basis
of Rapid Ion Flow with Specificity
STRUCTURAL INSIGHTS, The Potassium Channel, examines the structural basis
of the potassium channel’s ion specificity and high conductivity in further detail.

Scientists were slowly discovering the likely structures of ion channels
through a combination of patch-clamp methods, site-directed mutagenesis,
and other methods. However, progress was limited by the lack of a highresolution three-dimensional structure. The need was met by the determination of the structure of a bacterial potassium channel by x-ray crystallography
in 1998. The resulting structural framework is a source of insight into many
aspects of ion-channel function, including specificity and rapidity of ion flow.
As expected, the potassium channel is a tetramer of identical subunits,
each of which includes two membrane-spanning  helices. The four subunits
come together to form a pore in the shape of a cone that runs through the center of the structure (Figure 13.22). Beginning from the inside of the cell, the
pore starts with a diameter of approximately 10 Å and then constricts

structurally similar regions of the sodium,
calcium, and potassium channels. These
channels exhibit approximate fourfold
symmetry.

to a smaller cavity with a diameter of 8 Å. Both the opening to the outside
and the central cavity of the pore are filled with water, and a K ion can fit
in the pore without losing its shell of bound water molecules. Approximately
two-thirds of the way through the membrane, the pore becomes more constricted (3-Å diameter). At that point, any K ions must give up their water molecules and interact directly with groups from the protein. The channel structure effectively reduces the thickness of the membrane from 34 Å
to 12 Å by allowing the solvated ions to penetrate into the membrane before the ions must directly interact with the channel (Figure 13.23).
For potassium ions to relinquish their water molecules, other polar interactions must replace those with water. The restricted part of the pore is built
from residues between the two transmembrane helices (which correspond to
segments S5 and S6 in the sodium channel). In particular, a five-amino-acid
stretch within this region functions as the selectivity filter that determines the
preference for K over other ions (Figure 13.24). The stretch has the sequence
Thr-Val-Gly-Tyr-Gly, which is nearly completely conserved in all K channels and had already been identified as a signature sequence useful for identifying potential K channels. This region lies in a relatively extended conformation and is oriented such that the peptide carbonyl groups are directed
into the channel, facilitating interaction with the potassium ions.
Potassium channels are 100-fold as permeable to K as to Na. How is
this high degree of selectivity achieved? The narrow diameter (3 Å) of the
selectivity filter of the potassium channel enables the filter to reject ions
having a radius larger than 1.5 Å. However, a bare Na is small enough
(Table 13.2) to pass through the pore. Indeed, the ionic radius of Na is
substantially smaller than that of K. How then is Na rejected?
We need to consider the free-energy cost of dehydrating the Na and K
ions, given that they cannot pass through this part of the channel bearing a
retinue of water molecules. The key point is that the free-energy costs of dehydrating these ions are considerable [Na, 72 kcal mol1 (301 kJ mol1),
and K, 55 kcal mol1 (203 kJ mol1)]. The channel pays the cost of dehydrating K by providing compensating interactions with the carbonyl oxygen
atoms lining the selectivity filter. However, these oxygen atoms are positioned
such that they do not interact very favorably with Na, because it is too small
(Figure 13.25). The higher cost of dehydrating Na would be unrecovered,
and so Na would be rejected. The ionic radii of oxygen, potassium, and
sodium are 1.4, 1.33, and 0.95 Å, respectively. Hence a ring of oxygen atoms
positioned so that the K–O distance is 2.73 Å (1.4  1.33 Å) would be optimal for interaction with K compared with the shorter Na–O bonds (0.95
 1.4  2.35 Å) optimal for interaction with Na. Thus, the potassium channel avoids closely embracing Na ions, which must stay hydrated and hence
are impermeant.

13.5.7 The Structure of the Potassium Channel Explains Its
Rapid Rates of Transport
In addition to selectivity, ion channels display rapid rates of ion transport.
A structural analysis provides an appealing explanation for this proficiency.
The results of such studies revealed the presence of two potassium-binding
sites in the constricted regions of the potassium channel that are crucial for
rapid ion flow. Consider the process of ion conductance. One K ion proceeds into the channel and through the relatively unrestricted part of the
channel. It then gives up most or all of its coordinated water molecules and
binds to the first site in the selectivity filter region, a favorable binding site.
It can then jump to the second site, which appears to have comparable binding energy. However, the binding energy of the second site presents a freeenergy barrier, or trap, preventing the ion from completing its journey; there
is no energetic reason to leave the second ion-binding site. However, if a
second ion moves through the channel into the first site, the electrostatic
repulsion between the two ions will destabilize the initially bound ion and
help push it into solution (Figure 13.26). This mechanism provides a solution to the apparent paradox of high ion selectivity (requiring tight binding
sites) and rapid flow.

The structure determined for K channels is a good start for
considering the amino acid sequence similarities, as well as the structural and functional relations, for Na and Ca2 channels because of their
homology to K channels. Sequence comparisons and the results of mutagenesis experiments have also implicated the region between segments S5
and S6 in ion selectivity in the Ca2 channels. In Ca2 channels, one glutamate residue of this region in each of the four units plays a major role in
determining ion selectivity. The Na channel’s selection of Na over K
depends on ionic radius; the diameter of the pore is sufficiently restricted
that small ions such as Na and Li can pass through the channel, but larger
ions such as K are significantly hindered (Figure 13.27).
FIGURE 13.27 Selectivity of the sodium
channel. The ionic selectivity of the
sodium channel partly depends on steric
factors. Sodium and lithium ions, together
with a water molecule, fit in the channel,
as do hydroxylamine and hydrazine. In
contrast, K with a water molecule is too
large. [After R. D. Keynes. Ion channels in the

Residues in the positions corresponding to the glutamate residues in
Ca2 channels are major components of the selectivity filter of the Na
channel. These residues are aspartate, glutamate, lysine, and alanine in units
1, 2, 3, and 4, respectively (the DEKA locus). Thus, the potential fourfold
symmetry of the channel is clearly broken in this region, providing one explanation of why Na channels comprise single large polypeptide chains
rather than a noncovalent assembly of four identical subunits.
13.5.8 A Channel Can Be Inactivated by Occlusion of the Pore:
The Ball-and-Chain Model
The potassium channel and the sodium channel undergo inactivation within
milliseconds of channel opening (Figure 13.28). A first clue to the mechanism of inactivation came from exposing the cytoplasmic side of either channel to trypsin; cleavage by trypsin produced a trimmed channel that stayed
persistently open after depolarization. A second clue was the finding that
alternatively spliced variants of the potassium channel have markedly different inactivation kinetics; these variants differed from one another only
near the amino terminus, which is on the cytoplasmic side of the channel.
A mutant Shaker channel lacking 42 amino acids near the amino terminus
opened in response to depolarization but did not inactivate (see Figure
13.28). Most revealing, inactivation was restored by adding a synthetic peptide corresponding to the first 20 residues of the native channel.
These experiments strongly support the ball-and-chain model for channel inactivation that had been proposed years earlier (Figure 13.29). According to this model, the first 20 residues of the potassium channel form a cytoplasmic unit (the ball) that is attached to a flexible segment of the polypeptide
(the chain). When the channel is closed, the ball rotates freely in the aqueous solution. When the channel opens, the ball quickly finds a complementary site in the pore and occludes it. Hence, the channel opens for only a brief
interval before it undergoes inactivation by occlusion. Shortening the chain
speeds inactivation because the ball finds its target more quickly. Conversely,
lengthening the chain slows inactivation. Thus, the duration of the open state
can be controlled by the length and flexibility of the tether.

13.6 GAP JUNCTIONS ALLOW IONS AND SMALL
MOLECULES TO FLOW BETWEEN COMMUNICATING
CELLS
The ion channels that we have considered thus far have narrow pores and
are moderately to highly selective in regard to which ions are permeant.
They are closed in the resting state and have short lifetimes in the open state,
typically a millisecond, that enable them to transmit highly frequent neural signals. We turn now to a channel with a very different role. Gap junctions, also known as cell-to-cell channels, serve as passageways between the

domain, or “ball” (red), is tethered to the
channel by a flexible “chain” (green). In
the closed state, the ball is located in the
cytosol. Depolarization opens the channel
and creates a negatively charged binding
site for the positively charged ball near the
mouth of the pore. Movement of the ball
into this site inactivates the channel by
occluding it. [After C. M. Armstrong and
F. Bezanilla. J. Gen. Physiol. 70(1977):567.]

interiors of contiguous cells. Gap junctions are clustered in discrete regions
of the plasma membranes of apposed cells. Electron micrographs of sheets
of gap junctions show them tightly packed in a regular hexagonal array
(Figure 13.30A). A 20-Å central hole, the lumen of the channel, is prominent in each gap junction. A tangential view (Figure 13.30B) shows that
these channels span the intervening space, or gap, between apposed cells
(hence, the name gap junction). The width of the gap between the cytosols
of the two cells is about 35 Å.
Small hydrophilic molecules as well as ions can pass through gap junctions. The pore size of the junctions was determined by microinjecting a
series of fluorescent molecules into cells and observing their passage into
adjoining cells. All polar molecules with a mass of less than about 1 kd can
readily pass through these cell-to-cell channels. Thus, inorganic ions and
most metabolites (e.g., sugars, amino acids, and nucleotides) can flow between
the interiors of cells joined by gap junctions. In contrast, proteins, nucleic
acids, and polysaccharides are too large to traverse these channels. Gap junctions are important for intercellular communication. Cells in some excitable
tissues, such as heart muscle, are coupled by the rapid flow of ions through
these junctions, which ensure a rapid and synchronous response to stimuli.
Gap junctions are also essential for the nourishment of cells that are distant
from blood vessels, as in lens and bone. Moreover, communicating channels are important in development and differentiation. For example, a
pregnant uterus is transformed from a quiescent protector of the fetus to a
forceful ejector at the onset of labor; the formation of functional gap junctions at that time creates a syncytium of muscle cells that contract in
synchrony.
A cell-to-cell channel is made of 12 molecules of connexin, one of a family of transmembrane proteins with molecular masses ranging from 30 to
42 kd. Each connexin molecule appears to have four membrane-spanning
helices. Six connexin molecules are hexagonally arrayed to form a half channel, called a connexon or hemichannel (Figure 13.31). Two connexons join end
to end in the intercellular space to form a functional channel between the
communicating cells. Cell-to-cell channels differ from other membrane
channels in three respects: (1) they traverse two membranes rather than one;
(2) they connect cytosol to cytosol, rather than to the extracellular space or
the lumen of an organelle; and (3) the connexons forming a channel are synthesized by different cells. Gap junctions form readily when cells are brought
together. A cell-to-cell channel, once formed, tends to stay open for seconds
to minutes. They are closed by high concentrations of calcium ion and by
low pH. The closing of gap junctions by Ca2 and H serves to seal normal
cells from traumatized or dying neighbors. Gap junctions are also controlled
by membrane potential and by hormone-induced phosphorylation.

Summary

The Transport of Molecules Across a Membrane May Be Active or Passive

For a net movement of molecules across a membrane, two features are
required: (1) the molecule must be able to cross a hydrophobic barrier
and (2) an energy source must power the movement. Lipophilic molecules can pass through a membrane’s hydrophobic interior by simple diffusion. These molecules will move down their concentration gradients.
Polar or charged molecules require proteins to form passages through
the hydrophobic barrier. Passive transport or facilitated diffusion occurs
when an ion or polar molecule moves down its concentration gradient.
If a molecule moves against a concentration gradient, an external energy
source is required; this movement is referred to as active transport and
results in the generation of concentration gradients. Concentration gradients are a commonly used form of energy in all organisms.

• A Family of Membrane Proteins Uses ATP Hydrolysis to Pump Ions
Across Membranes

Active transport is often carried out at the expense of ATP hydrolysis.
P-type ATPases pump ions against a concentration gradient and become transiently phosphorylated on an aspartic acid residue in the
process of transport. P-type ATPases, which include the sarcoplasmic
reticulum Ca2 ATPase and the Na-K ATPase, are integral membrane proteins with conserved structures and catalytic mechanisms.

• Multidrug Resistance and Cystic Fibrosis Highlight a Family of Membrane
Proteins with ATP-Binding Cassette Domains

The membrane proteins with ATP-binding cassette (ABC) domains are
complex ATP-dependent pumps. Each pump includes four major domains:
two domains span the membrane and two others contain ABC P-loop
ATPase structures. The multidrug resistance proteins confer resistance on
cancer cells by pumping chemotherapeutic drugs out of a cancer cell before the drugs can exert their effects. Another ABC domain protein is the
cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR), an ATPgated chloride channel. Mutations in CFTR can result in cystic fibrosis.

• Secondary Transporters Use One Concentration Gradient to Power the
Formation of Another

Many active-transport systems couple the uphill flow of one ion or molecule to the downhill flow of another. These membrane proteins, called
secondary transporters or cotransporters, can be classified as antiporters
or symporters. Antiporters couple the downhill flow of one type of ion
in one direction to the uphill flow of another in the opposite direction.
Symporters move both ions in the same direction.

• Specific Channels Can Rapidly Transport Ions Across Membranes

Ion channels allow the rapid movement of ions across the hydrophobic
barrier of the membrane. Such channels allow ions to flow down their
concentration gradients. The channels have several features in common:
(1) ion specificity, (2) the existence of open and closed states, (3) regulation by ligands or voltage. Ion channels are exemplified by the Na
and K channels responsible for nerve impulses.

• Gap Junctions Allow Ions and Small Molecules to Flow
Between Communicating Cells

In contrast with many channels, which connect the cell interior with the
environment, gap junctions, or cell-to-cell channels, serve to connect
the interiors of contiguous groups of cells. A cell-to-cell channel is composed of 12 molecules of connexin, which associate to form two 6-membered connexons.

of this family. Below are electrophysiological recordings of cells

CHAPTER 14

Metabolism: Basic Concepts and Design

Hummingbirds are capable of prodigious feats of
endurance. For instance, the tiny ruby-throated hummingbird
can store enough fuel to fly across the Gulf of Mexico, a
distance of some 500 miles, without resting. This achievement
is possible because of the ability to convert fuels into the
cellular energy currency, ATP, represented by the model at
the right. [(Left) K. D. McGraw/Rainbow.]

The concepts of conformation and dynamics developed in Part I—especially those dealing with the specificity and catalytic power of enzymes, the
regulation of their catalytic activity, and the transport of molecules and
ions across membranes—enable us to now ask questions fundamental
to biochemistry:
1. How does a cell extract energy and reducing power from its environment?
2. How does a cell synthesize the building blocks of its macromolecules and
then the macromolecules themselves?
These processes are carried out by a highly integrated network of chemical reactions that are collectively known as

metabolism.

Furthermore, although the number of reactions in metabolism is large, the number of kinds of reactions is small and
the mechanisms of these reactions are usually quite simple. Metabolic pathways are also regulated in common ways. The purpose of this chapter is to
introduce some general principles and motifs of metabolism to provide a
foundation for the more detailed studies to follow.

Living organisms require a continual input of free energy for three major
purposes: (1) the performance of mechanical work in muscle contraction and
other cellular movements, (2) the active transport of molecules and ions, and
(3) the synthesis of macromolecules and other biomolecules from simple precursors. The free energy used in these processes, which maintain an organism in a state that is far from equilibrium, is derived from the environment.
The First Law of Thermodynamics states that energy can be neither created nor destroyed. The amount of energy in the universe is constant. Nevertheless, energy can be converted from one form into another.
Photosynthetic organisms, or phototrophs, use the energy of sunlight to
convert simple energy-poor molecules into more-complex energy-rich molecules that serve as fuels. In other words, photosynthetic organisms transform light energy into chemical energy. Indeed, this transformation is ultimately the primary source of chemical energy for the vast majority of
organisms, human beings included. Chemotrophs, which include animals,
obtain chemical energy through the oxidation of foodstuffs generated by
phototrophs.
Chemical energy obtained from the oxidation of carbon compounds may
be transformed into the unequal distribution of ions across a membrane, resulting in an ion gradient. This gradient, in turn, is an energy source that
can be used to move molecules across membranes, that can be converted
into yet other types of chemical energy, or that can convey information in
the form of nerve impulses. In addition, chemical energy can be transduced
into mechanical energy. We convert the chemical energy of a fuel into structural alterations of contractile proteins that result in muscle contraction and
movement. Finally, chemical energy powers the reactions that result in the
synthesis of biomolecules.
At any given instant in a cell, thousands of energy transformations are
taking place. Energy is being extracted from fuels and used to power biosynthetic processes. These transformations are referred to as metabolism or
intermediary metabolism.

Glucose is metabolized to pyruvate in
10 linked reactions. Under anaerobic
conditions, pyruvate is metabolized to
lactate and, under aerobic conditions, to
acetyl CoA. The glucose-derived carbons
are subsequently oxidized to CO2.

Metabolism is essentially a linked series of chemical reactions that begins
with a particular molecule and converts it into some other molecule or molecules in a carefully defined fashion (Figure 14.1). There are many such defined pathways in the cell (Figure 14.2), and we will examine a few of them
in some detail later. These pathways are interdependent, and their activity
is coordinated by exquisitely sensitive means of communication in which
allosteric enzymes are predominant (Section 10.1). We will consider the
principles of this communication in Chapter 15.
We can divide metabolic pathways into two broad classes: (1) those that
convert energy into biologically useful forms and (2) those that require inputs of energy to proceed. Although this division is often imprecise, it is
nonetheless a useful distinction in an examination of metabolism. Those reactions that transform fuels into cellular energy are called catabolic reactions
or, more generally, catabolism.

Some pathways can be either anabolic or catabolic, depending on the energy conditions in the cell. They are referred to as amphibolic pathways.
14.1.1 A Thermodynamically Unfavorable Reaction Can Be
Driven by a Favorable Reaction
CONCEPTUAL INSIGHTS, Energetic Coupling, offers a graphical presentation of
how enzymatic coupling enables a favorable reaction to drive an unfavorable reaction.

How are specific pathways constructed from individual reactions? A pathway must satisfy minimally two criteria: (1) the individual reactions must
be specific and (2) the entire set of reactions that constitute the pathway must
be thermodynamically favored. A reaction that is specific will yield only one
particular product or set of products from its reactants. As discussed in
Chapter 8, a function of enzymes is to provide this specificity. The thermodynamics of metabolism is most readily approached in terms of free energy, which was discussed in Sections 1.3.3, 8.2.1, and 8.2.2. A reaction can
occur spontaneously only if G, the change in free energy, is negative. Recall that G for the formation of products C and D from substrates A and
B is given by
3 C4 3D 4
G  G°  RT ln
3 A4 3 B4
Thus, the G of a reaction depends on the nature of the reactant products
(expressed by the G° term, the standard free-energy change) and on their
concentrations (expressed by the second term).

CHAPTER 14 • Metabolism: Basic Concepts
and Design

An important thermodynamic fact is that the overall free-energy change
for a chemically coupled series of reactions is equal to the sum of the freeenergy changes of the individual steps. Consider the following reactions:
A 3:4 B  C
B 3:4 D

G°  5 kcal mol1 (21 kJ mol1 )
G°  8 kcal mol1 (34 kJ mol1 )

A 3:4 C  D

G°  3 kcal mol1 (13 kJ mol1 )

Under standard conditions, A cannot be spontaneously converted into
B and C, because G is positive. However, the conversion of B into D under standard conditions is thermodynamically feasible. Because freeenergy changes are additive, the conversion of A into C and D has a G° of
3 kcal mol1 (13 kJ mol1), which means that it can occur spontaneously under standard conditions. Thus, a thermodynamically unfavorable
reaction can be driven by a thermodynamically favorable reaction to which it
is coupled. In this example, the chemical intermediate B, common to both
reactions, couples the reactions. Thus, metabolic pathways are formed by
the coupling of enzyme-catalyzed reactions such that the overall free energy of the pathway is negative.
14.1.2 ATP Is the Universal Currency of Free Energy
in Biological Systems
Just as commerce is facilitated by the use of a common currency, the commerce of the cell—metabolism—is facilitated by the use of a common energy currency, adenosine triphosphate (ATP). Part of the free energy derived
from the oxidation of foodstuffs and from light is transformed into this
highly accessible molecule, which acts as the free-energy donor in most
energy-requiring processes such as motion, active transport, or biosynthesis.
ATP is a nucleotide consisting of an adenine, a ribose, and a triphosphate unit (Figure 14.3). The active form of ATP is usually a complex of
ATP with Mg2 or Mn2 (Section 9.4.2). In considering the role of ATP
as an energy carrier, we can focus on its triphosphate moiety. ATP is an
energy-rich molecule because its triphosphate unit contains two phosphoanhydride
bonds. A large amount of free energy is liberated when ATP is hydrolyzed to
adenosine diphosphate (ADP) and orthophosphate (Pi) or when ATP is hydrolyzed to adenosine monophosphate (AMP) and pyrophosphate (PPi).
ATP  H2O 3:4 ADP  Pi
G°  7.3 kcal mol1 (30.5 kJ mol1 )
ATP  H2O 3:4 AMP  PPi
G°  10.9 kcal mol1 (45.6 kJ mol1 )
The precise G° for these reactions depends on the ionic strength of the
medium and on the concentrations of Mg2 and other metal ions. Under
typical cellular concentrations, the actual G for these hydrolyses is
approximately 12 kcal mol1 (50 kJ mol1).
The free energy liberated in the hydrolysis of ATP is harnessed to drive
reactions that require an input of free energy, such as muscle contraction.
In turn, ATP is formed from ADP and Pi when fuel molecules are oxidized
in chemotrophs or when light is trapped by phototrophs. This ATP–ADP
cycle is the fundamental mode of energy exchange in biological systems.
Some biosynthetic reactions are driven by hydrolysis of nucleoside
triphosphates that are analogous to ATP—namely, guanosine triphosphate
(GTP), uridine triphosphate (UTP), and cytidine triphosphate (CTP). The
diphosphate forms of these nucleotides are denoted by GDP, UDP, and
CDP, and the monophosphate forms by GMP, UMP, and CMP. Enzymes

can catalyze the transfer of the terminal phosphoryl group from one nucleotide to another. The phosphorylation of nucleoside monophosphates is
catalyzed by a family of nucleoside monophosphate kinases, as discussed in
Section 9.4.1. The phosphorylation of nucleoside diphosphates is catalyzed
by nucleoside diphosphate kinase, an enzyme with broad specificity. It is
intriguing to note that, although all of the nucleotide triphosphates are energetically equivalent, ATP is nonetheless the primary cellular energy carrier. In addition, two important electron carriers, NAD and FAD, are derivatives of ATP. The role of ATP in energy metabolism is paramount.
14.1.3 ATP Hydrolysis Drives Metabolism by Shifting the
Equilibrium of Coupled Reactions
How does coupling to ATP hydrolysis make possible an otherwise unfavorable reaction? Consider a chemical reaction that is thermodynamically unfavorable without an input of free energy, a situation common to many
biosynthetic reactions. Suppose that the standard free energy of the conversion of compound A into compound B is 4.0 kcal mol1 (13 kJ mol1):
A 3:4 B

which means that the hydrolysis of ATP enables A to be converted into B
until the [B]/[A] ratio reaches a value of 1.34  105. This equilibrium ratio is strikingly different from the value of 1.15  103 for the reaction
A 8n B in the absence of ATP hydrolysis. In other words, coupling the
hydrolysis of ATP with the conversion of A into B has changed the equilibrium ratio of B to A by a factor of about 108.
We see here the thermodynamic essence of ATP’s action as an energycoupling agent. Cells maintain a high level of ATP by using oxidizable substrates or light as sources of free energy. The hydrolysis of an ATP molecule in a coupled reaction then changes the equilibrium ratio of products to
reactants by a very large factor, of the order of 108. More generally, the hydrolysis of n ATP molecules changes the equilibrium ratio of a coupled reaction (or sequence of reactions) by a factor of 108n. For example, the hydrolysis of three ATP molecules in a coupled reaction changes the
equilibrium ratio by a factor of 1024. Thus, a thermodynamically unfavorable
reaction sequence can be converted into a favorable one by coupling it to the
hydrolysis of a sufficient number of ATP molecules in a new reaction. It should
also be emphasized that A and B in the preceding coupled reaction may be
interpreted very generally, not only as different chemical species. For example, A and B may represent activated and unactivated conformations of
a protein; in this case, phosphorylation with ATP may be a means of conversion into an activated conformation. Such a conformation can store free
energy, which can then be used to drive a thermodynamically unfavorable
reaction. Through such changes in conformation, molecular motors such as
myosin, kinesin, and dynein convert the chemical energy of ATP into mechanical energy (Chapter 34). Indeed, this conversion is the basis of muscle contraction.
Alternatively, A and B may refer to the concentrations of an ion or molecule on the outside and inside of a cell, as in the active transport of a nutrient. The active transport of Na and K across membranes is driven by
the phosphorylation of the sodium–potassium pump by ATP and its subsequent dephosphorylation (Section 13.2.1).
14.1.4 Structural Basis of the High Phosphoryl Transfer
Potential of ATP
As illustrated by molecular motors (Chapter 34) and ion pumps (Section
13.2), phosphoryl transfer is a common means of energy coupling. Furthermore, as we shall see in Chapter 15, phosphoryl transfer is also widely
used in the intracellular transmission of information. What makes ATP a
particularly efficient phosphoryl-group donor? Let us compare the standard
free energy of hydrolysis of ATP with that of a phosphate ester, such as
glycerol 3-phosphate:

G°  2.2 kcal mol1 (9.2 kJ mol1 )

379
Coupled Reactions

The magnitude of G° for the hydrolysis of glycerol 3-phosphate is much
smaller than that of ATP, which means that ATP has a stronger tendency
to transfer its terminal phosphoryl group to water than does glycerol 3-phosphate. In other words, ATP has a higher phosphoryl transfer potential
(phosphoryl-group transfer potential) than does glycerol 3-phosphate.
What is the structural basis of the high phosphoryl transfer potential of
ATP? Because G° depends on the difference in free energies of the products and reactants, the structures of both ATP and its hydrolysis products,
ADP and Pi, must be examined to answer this question. Three factors are
important: resonance stabilization, electrostatic repulsion, and stabilization
due to hydration. ADP and, particularly, Pi, have greater resonance stabilization than does ATP. Orthophosphate has a number of resonance forms
of similar energy (Figure 14.4), whereas the -phosphoryl group of ATP
has a smaller number.

Forms like that shown in Figure 14.5 are unfavorable because a positively
charged oxygen atom is adjacent to a positively charged phosphorus atom,
an electrostatically unfavorable juxtaposition. Furthermore, at pH 7, the
triphosphate unit of ATP carries about four negative charges. These charges
repel one another because they are in close proximity. The repulsion between them is reduced when ATP is hydrolyzed. Finally, water can bind
more effectively to ADP and Pi than it can to the phosphoanhydride part
of ATP, stabilizing the ADP and Pi by hydration.
ATP is often called a high-energy phosphate compound, and its phosphoanhydride bonds are referred to as high-energy bonds. Indeed, a “squiggle”
(P) is often used to indicate such a bond. Nonetheless, there is nothing
special about the bonds themselves. They are high-energy bonds in the sense
that much free energy is released when they are hydrolyzed, for the aforegiven
reasons.

to the terminal part of ATP, because two
positive charges are placed adjacent to
each other.

14.1.5 Phosphoryl Transfer Potential Is an Important Form
of Cellular Energy Transformation
The standard free energies of hydrolysis provide a convenient means of comparing the phosphoryl transfer potential of phosphorylated compounds.
Such comparisons reveal that ATP is not the only compound with a high
phosphoryl transfer potential. In fact, some compounds in biological systems have a higher phosphoryl transfer potential than that of ATP. These
compounds include phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP), 1,3-bisphosphoglycerate
(1,3-BPG), and creatine phosphate (Figure 14.6). Thus, PEP can transfer
its phosphoryl group to ADP to form ATP. Indeed, this is one of the ways
in which ATP is generated in the breakdown of sugars (Sections 14.2.1,
16.1.6, and 16.1.7). It is significant that ATP has a phosphoryl transfer potential that is intermediate among the biologically important phosphorylated molecules (Table 14.1). This intermediate position enables ATP to function efficiently as a carrier of phosphoryl groups.

Creatine phosphate in vertebrate muscle serves as a reservoir of highpotential phosphoryl groups that can be readily transferred to ATP. Indeed,
we use creatine phosphate to regenerate ATP from ADP every time we exercise strenuously. This reaction is catalyzed by creatine kinase.

its high phosphoryl transfer potential relative to that of ATP make it a highly
effective phosphoryl buffer. Indeed, creatine phosphate is the major source
of phosphoryl groups for ATP regeneration for a runner during the first 4
seconds of a 100-meter sprint. After that, ATP must be generated through
metabolism (Figure 14.7).

14.2 THE OXIDATION OF CARBON FUELS IS AN
IMPORTANT SOURCE OF CELLULAR ENERGY
ATP serves as the principal immediate donor of free energy in biological systems rather than as a long-term storage form of free energy. In a typical cell,

7552dc14_373-394

7/30/01

Page 381

an ATP molecule is consumed within a minute of its formation. Although
the total quantity of ATP in the body is limited to approximately 100 g, the
turnover of this small quantity of ATP is very high. For example, a resting
human being consumes about 40 kg of ATP in 24 hours. During strenuous
exertion, the rate of utilization of ATP may be as high as 0.5 kg/minute.
For a 2-hour run, 60 kg (132 pounds) of ATP is utilized. Clearly, it is vital
to have mechanisms for regenerating ATP. Motion, active transport, signal
amplification, and biosynthesis can occur only if ATP is continually regenerated from ADP (Figure 14.8). The generation of ATP is one of the
primary roles of catabolism. The carbon in fuel molecules—such as glucose
and fats—is oxidized to CO2, and the energy released is used to regenerate
ATP from ADP and Pi.
In aerobic organisms, the ultimate electron acceptor in the oxidation of
carbon is O2 and the oxidation product is CO2. Consequently, the more reduced a carbon is to begin with, the more exergonic its oxidation will be.

Although fuel molecules are more complex (Figure 14.10) than the singlecarbon compounds depicted in Figure 14.9, when a fuel is oxidized, the
oxidation takes place one carbon at a time. The carbon oxidation energy is
used in some cases to create a compound with high phosphoryl transfer potential and in other cases to create an ion gradient. In either case, the end
point is the formation of ATP.

Couple Carbon Oxidation to ATP Synthesis
How is the energy released in the oxidation of a carbon compound converted
into ATP? As an example, consider glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate (shown in
the margin), which is a metabolite of glucose formed in the oxidation of that
sugar. The C-1 carbon (shown in red) is a component of an aldehyde and is
not in its most oxidized state. Oxidation of the aldehyde to an acid will release energy.

oxidation of fuels can power the formation
of proton gradients. These proton gradients
can in turn drive the synthesis of ATP.

The electrochemical potential of ion gradients across membranes, produced
by the oxidation of fuel molecules or by photosynthesis, ultimately powers
the synthesis of most of the ATP in cells. In general, ion gradients are versatile means of coupling thermodynamically unfavorable reactions to favorable
ones. Indeed, in animals, proton gradients generated by the oxidation of carbon fuels account for more than 90% of ATP generation (Figure 14.11). This
process is called oxidative phosphorylation (Chapter 18). ATP hydrolysis
can then be used to form ion gradients of different types and functions. The
electrochemical potential of a Na gradient, for example, can be tapped to
pump Ca2 out of cells (Section 13.4) or to transport nutrients such as sugars and amino acids into cells.
14.2.3 Stages in the Extraction of Energy from Foodstuffs
Let us take an overall view of the processes of energy conversion in higher
organisms before considering them in detail in subsequent chapters. Hans
Krebs described three stages in the generation of energy from the oxidation
of foodstuffs (Figure 14.12).
In the first stage, large molecules in food are broken down into smaller units.
Proteins are hydrolyzed to their 20 kinds of constituent amino acids, poly-

7552dc14_373-394

7/31/01

12:24 PM

Page 383

saccharides are hydrolyzed to simple sugars such as glucose,
and fats are hydrolyzed to glycerol and fatty acids. This stage
is strictly a preparation stage; no useful energy is captured in
this phase.
In the second stage, these numerous small molecules are degraded to a few simple units that play a central role in metabolism. In fact, most of them—sugars, fatty acids, glycerol, and
several amino acids—are converted into the acetyl unit of
acetyl CoA (Section 14.3.1). Some ATP is generated in this
stage, but the amount is small compared with that obtained
in the third stage.
In the third stage, ATP is produced from the complete oxidation of the acetyl unit of acetyl CoA. The third stage consists
of the citric acid cycle and oxidative phosphorylation, which
are the final common pathways in the oxidation of fuel molecules.
Acetyl CoA brings acetyl units into the citric acid cycle [also
called the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle or Krebs cycle],
where they are completely oxidized to CO2. Four pairs of electrons are transferred (three to NAD and one to FAD) for
each acetyl group that is oxidized. Then, a proton gradient is
generated as electrons flow from the reduced forms of these
carriers to O2, and this gradient is used to synthesize ATP.

14.3 METABOLIC PATHWAYS CONTAIN MANY
RECURRING MOTIFS
At first glance, metabolism appears intimidating because of the sheer number of reactants and reactions. Nevertheless, there are unifying themes that
make the comprehension of this complexity more manageable. These unifying themes include common metabolites, reactions, and regulatory schemes
that stem from a common evolutionary heritage.
Reactive site

14.3.1 Activated Carriers Exemplify the Modular Design and
Economy of Metabolism
We have seen that phosphoryl transfer can be used to drive otherwise endergonic reactions, alter the energy of conformation of a protein, or serve as
a signal to alter the activity of a protein. The phosphoryl-group donor in all
of these reactions is ATP. In other words, ATP is an activated carrier of
phosphoryl groups because phosphoryl transfer from ATP is an exergonic
process. The use of activated carriers is a recurring motif in biochemistry,
and we will consider several such carriers here.
1. Activated carriers of electrons for fuel oxidation. In aerobic organisms, the
ultimate electron acceptor in the oxidation of fuel molecules is O2. However, electrons are not transferred directly to O2. Instead, fuel molecules
transfer electrons to special carriers, which are either pyridine nucleotides
or flavins. The reduced forms of these carriers then transfer their highpotential electrons to O2.
Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide is a major electron carrier in the oxidation of fuel molecules (Figure 14.13). The reactive part of NAD is its
nicotinamide ring, a pyridine derivative synthesized from the vitamin
niacin. In the oxidation of a substrate, the nicotinamide ring of NAD accepts a hydrogen ion and two electrons, which are equivalent to a hydride ion.

In this dehydrogenation, one hydrogen atom of the substrate is directly

coenzyme flavin adenine dinucleotide (Figure 14.14). The abbreviations for
the oxidized and reduced forms of this carrier are FAD and FADH2, respectively. FAD is the electron acceptor in reactions of the type

The reactive part of FAD is its isoalloxazine ring, a derivative of the vitamin riboflavin (Figure 14.15). FAD, like NAD, can accept two electrons.
In doing so, FAD, unlike NAD, takes up two protons. These carriers of
high-potential electrons as well as flavin mononucleotide (FMN), an electron carrier related to FAD, will be considered further in Chapter 18.
2. An activated carrier of electrons for reductive biosynthesis. High-potential
electrons are required in most biosyntheses because the precursors are more

The electron donor in most reductive biosyntheses is NADPH, the reduced
form of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADP; see Figure
14.13). NADPH differs from NADH in that the 2-hydroxyl group of its
adenosine moiety is esterified with phosphate. NADPH carries electrons in
the same way as NADH. However, NADPH is used almost exclusively for
reductive biosyntheses, whereas NADH is used primarily for the generation of
ATP. The extra phosphoryl group on NADPH is a tag that enables enzymes
to distinguish between high-potential electrons to be used in anabolism and
those to be used in catabolism.
3. An activated carrier of two-carbon fragments. Coenzyme A, another central molecule in metabolism, is a carrier of acyl groups (Figure 14.16). Acyl
groups are important constituents both in catabolism, as in the oxidation of
fatty acids, and in anabolism, as in the synthesis of membrane lipids. The terminal sulfhydryl group in CoA is the reactive site. Acyl groups are linked to
CoA by thioester bonds. The resulting derivative is called an acyl CoA. An
acyl group often linked to CoA is the acetyl unit; this derivative is called acetyl
CoA. The G° for the hydrolysis of acetyl CoA has a large negative value:

The hydrolysis of a thioester is thermodynamically more favorable than that
of an oxygen ester because the electrons of the CUO bond cannot form resonance structures with the C–S bond that are as stable as those that they
can form with the C–O bond. Consequently, acetyl CoA has a high acetyl
potential (acetyl group-transfer potential) because transfer of the acetyl group
is exergonic. Acetyl CoA carries an activated acetyl group, just as ATP carries an activated phosphoryl group.
The use of activated carriers illustrates two key aspects of metabolism.
First, NADH, NADPH, and FADH2 react slowly with O2 in the absence
of a catalyst. Likewise, ATP and acetyl CoA are hydrolyzed slowly (in
times of many hours or even days) in the absence of a catalyst. These
molecules are kinetically quite stable in the face of a large thermodynamic
driving force for reaction with O2 (in regard to the electron carriers) and
H2O (in regard to ATP and acetyl CoA). The kinetic stability of these molecules in the absence of specific catalysts is essential for their biological function because it enables enzymes to control the flow of free energy and reducing power.

Note: Many of the activated carriers are coenzymes that are derived from water-soluble
vitamins (Section 8.6.1).

Second, most interchanges of activated groups in metabolism are accomplished by a rather small set of carriers (Table 14.2). The existence of a recurring set of activated carriers in all organisms is one of the unifying motifs of biochemistry. Furthermore, it illustrates the modular design of
metabolism. A small set of molecules carries out a very wide range of tasks.
Metabolism is readily comprehended because of the economy and elegance
of its underlying design.
14.3.2 Key Reactions Are Reiterated Throughout
Metabolism
Just as there is an economy of design in the use of activated carriers, so is
there an economy of design in biochemical reactions. The thousands of metabolic reactions, bewildering at first in their variety, can be subdivided into
just six types (Table 14.3). Specific reactions of each type appear repeatedly,
further reducing the number of reactions necessary for the student to learn.

These two oxidation–reduction reactions are components of the citric acid
cycle (Chapter 17), which completely oxidizes the activated two-carbon
fragment of acetyl CoA to two molecules of CO2. In reaction 1, FADH2
carries the electrons, whereas, in reaction 2, electrons are carried by NADH.
In biosynthetic oxidation–reduction reactions, NADPH is the reductant.
2. Ligation reactions form bonds by using free energy from ATP cleavage.
Reaction 3 illustrates the ATP-dependent formation of a carbon–carbon
bond, necessary to combine smaller molecules to form larger ones. Oxaloacetate is formed from pyruvate and CO2.

phosphoryl-group carrier, ATP, to glucose. This reaction traps glucose in
the cell so that further catabolism can take place.

5. Hydrolytic reactions cleave bonds by the addition of water. Hydrolysis is
a common means employed to break down large molecules, either to facilitate further metabolism or to reutilize some of the components for biosynthetic purposes. Proteins are digested by hydrolytic cleavage (Chapters 9
and 10). Reaction 6 illustrates the hydrolysis of a peptide to yield two smaller
peptides.

These six fundamental reaction types are the basis of metabolism. Remember that all six types can proceed in either direction, depending on the standard free energy for the specific reaction and the concentration of the reactants and products inside the cell. As an example of how simple themes are
reiterated, consider the reactions shown in Figure 14.17. The same sequence
of reactions is employed in the citric acid cycle, fatty acid degradation, the
degradation of the amino acid lysine, and (in reverse) the biosynthesis of
fatty acids. An effective way to learn is to look for commonalties in the diverse metabolic pathways that we will be studying. There is a chemical logic
that, when exposed, renders the complexity of the chemistry of living systems more manageable and reveals its elegance.

CHAPTER 14 • Metabolism: Basic Concepts
and Design

It is evident that the complex network of reactions constituting intermediary metabolism must be rigorously regulated. At the same time, metabolic
control must be flexible, because the external environments of cells are not
constant. Metabolism is regulated by controlling (1) the amounts of enzymes,
(2) their catalytic activities, and (3) the accessibility of substrates. The amount
of a particular enzyme depends on both its rate of synthesis and its rate of
degradation. The level of most enzymes is adjusted primarily by changing
the rate of transcription of the genes encoding them. In E. coli, the presence
of lactose, for example, induces within minutes a more than 50-fold increase
in the rate of synthesis of -galactosidase, an enzyme required for the breakdown of this disaccharide.
The catalytic activity of enzymes is controlled in several ways. Reversible
allosteric control is especially important. For example, the first reaction in
many biosynthetic pathways is allosterically inhibited by the ultimate product of the pathway. The inhibition of aspartate transcarbamoylase by cytidine triphosphate (Section 10.1) is a well-understood example of feedback
inhibition. This type of control can be almost instantaneous. Another recurring mechanism is reversible covalent modification. For example, glycogen phosphorylase, the enzyme catalyzing the breakdown of glycogen, a
storage form of sugar, is activated by phosphorylation of a particular serine
residue when glucose is scarce (Section 21.2.1).
Hormones coordinate metabolic relations between different tissues, often
by regulating the reversible modification of key enzymes. Hormones such
as epinephrine trigger signal transduction cascades that lead to highly amplified changes in metabolic patterns in target tissues such as the muscle
(Section 15.0.1). The hormone insulin promotes the entry of glucose into
many kinds of cells. As will be discussed again in Chapter 15, many hormones act through intracellular messengers, such as cyclic AMP and calcium ion, that coordinate the activities of many target proteins.
Controlling the flux of substrates also regulates metabolism. The transfer of substrates from one compartment of a cell to another (e.g., from the
cytosol to mitochondria) can serve as a control point.
An important general principle of metabolism is that biosynthetic and
degradative pathways are almost always distinct. This separation is necessary
for energetic reasons, as will be evident in subsequent chapters. It also facilitates the control of metabolism. In eukaryotes, metabolic regulation and
flexibility also are enhanced by compartmentalization. For example, fatty
acid oxidation takes place in mitochondria, whereas fatty acid synthesis
takes place in the cytosol. Compartmentalization segregates opposed reactions.
Many reactions in metabolism are controlled by the energy status of the
cell. One index of the energy status is the energy charge, which is proportional to the mole fraction of ATP plus half the mole fraction of ADP, given
that ATP contains two anhydride bonds, whereas ADP contains one.
Hence, the energy charge is defined as

The energy charge can have a value ranging from 0 (all AMP) to 1 (all ATP).
Daniel Atkinson showed that ATP-generating (catabolic) pathways are inhibited by an energy charge, whereas ATP-utilizing (anabolic) pathways are
stimulated by a high-energy charge. In plots of the reaction rates of such pathways versus the energy charge, the curves are steep near an energy charge of
0.9, where they usually intersect (Figure 14.18). It is evident that the control

7552dc14_373-394

of these pathways has evolved to maintain the energy charge within rather
narrow limits. In other words, the energy charge, like the pH of a cell, is
buffered. The energy charge of most cells ranges from 0.80 to 0.95. An alternative index of the energy status is the phosphorylation potential, which
is defined as

The phosphorylation potential, in contrast with the energy charge, depends
on the concentration of Pi and is directly related to the free energy-storage
available from ATP.

14.3.4 Evolution of Metabolic Pathways
How did the complex pathways that constitute metabolism evolve?
This question, a difficult one to address, was approached in Chapter 2. The current thinking is that RNA was an early biomolecule and that,
in an early RNA world, RNA served as catalysts and information-storage
molecules (Section 2.2.2).
Why do activated carriers such as ATP, NADH, FADH2, and coenzyme A contain adenosine diphosphate units (Figure 14.19)? A possible explanation is that these molecules evolved from the early RNA catalysts.
Non-RNA units such as the isoalloxazine ring may have been recruited
to serve as efficient carriers of activated electrons and chemical units, a
function not readily performed by RNA itself. We can picture the adenine
ring of FADH2 binding to a uracil unit in a niche of an RNA enzyme (ribozyme) by base-pairing, whereas the isoalloxazine ring protrudes and
functions as an electron carrier. When the more versatile proteins replaced
RNA as the major catalysts, the ribonucleotide coenzymes stayed essentially unchanged because they were already well suited to their metabolic
roles. The nicotin amide unit of NADH, for example, can readily transfer
electrons irrespective of whether the adenine unit interacts with a base in
an RNA enzyme or with amino acid residues in a protein enzyme. With the
advent of protein enzymes, these important cofactors evolved as free molecules without losing the adenosine diphosphate vestige of their RNAworld ancestry. That molecules and motifs of metabolism are common to
all forms of life testifies to their common origin and to the retention of functioning modules through billions of years of evolution. Our understanding
of metabolism, like that of other biological processes, is enriched by inquiry
into how these beautifully integrated patterns of reactions came into being.

All cells transform energy. They extract energy from their environment
and use this energy to convert simple molecules into cellular components.

• Metabolism Is Composed of Many Coupled, Interconnecting Reactions

The process of energy transduction takes place through a highly integrated network of chemical reactions called metabolism. Metabolism can
be subdivided into catabolism (reactions employed to extract energy
from fuels) and anabolism (reactions that use this energy for biosynthesis). The most valuable thermodynamic concept for understanding
bioenergetics is free energy. A reaction can occur spontaneously only if
the change in free energy (G) is negative. A thermodynamically unfavorable reaction can be driven by a thermodynamically favorable one,
which in many cases is the hydrolysis of ATP. The hydrolysis of ATP
shifts the equilibrium of a coupled reaction by a factor of about 108. ATP,

the universal currency of energy in biological systems, is an energy-rich
molecule because it contains two phosphoanhydride bonds.

• The Oxidation of Carbon Fuels Is an Important Source of Cellular Energy

ATP formation is coupled to the oxidation of carbon fuels, either directly or through the formation of ion gradients. Photosynthetic organisms can use light to generate such gradients. ATP is consumed in muscle contraction and other motions of cells, in active transport, in signal
transduction processes, and in biosyntheses. There are three stages in
the extraction of energy from foodstuffs by aerobic organisms. In the
first stage, large molecules are broken down into smaller ones, such as
amino acids, sugars, and fatty acids. In the second stage, these small
molecules are degraded to a few simple units that have a pervasive role
in metabolism. One of them is the acetyl unit of acetyl CoA, a carrier
of activated acyl groups. The third stage of metabolism is the citric acid
cycle and oxidative phosphorylation, in which ATP is generated as electrons flow to O2, the ultimate electron acceptor, and fuels are completely
oxidized to CO2.

• Metabolic Pathways Contain Many Recurring Motifs

Metabolism is characterized by common motifs. A small number of activated carriers, such as ATP, NADH, and acetyl CoA, are used in many
metabolic pathways. NADPH, which carries two electrons at a high potential, provides reducing power in the biosynthesis of cell components
from more-oxidized precursors. ATP and NADPH are continually generated and consumed. Most transfers of activated groups in metabolism
are mediated by a recurring set of carriers. Moreover, key reaction types
are used repeatedly in metabolic pathways.
Metabolism is regulated in a variety of ways. The amounts of some
critical enzymes are controlled by regulation of the rate of protein synthesis and degradation. In addition, the catalytic activities of many enzymes are regulated by allosteric interactions (as in feedback inhibition)
and by covalent modification. The movement of many substrates into
cells and subcellular compartments also is controlled. Distinct pathways
for biosynthesis and degradation contribute to metabolic regulation.
The energy charge, which depends on the relative amounts of ATP,
ADP, and AMP, plays a role in metabolic regulation. A high-energy
charge inhibits ATP-generating (catabolic) pathways, whereas it stimulates ATP-utilizing (anabolic) pathways.

supplementation?
10. Standard conditions versus real life. The enzyme aldolase catalyzes the following reaction in the glycolytic pathway:
Aldolase

Fructose 1, 6 bisphosphate 3::::4
dihydroxyacetone phosphate  glyceraldehyde 3–phosphate
The G° for the reaction is 5.7 kcal mol1, whereas the G
in the cell is 0.3 kcal mol1. Calculate the ratio of reactants to
products under equilibrium and intracellular conditions. Using
your results, explain how the reaction can be endergonic under
standard conditions and exergonic under intracellular conditions.
11. Not all alike. The concentrations of ATP, ADP, and Pi differ with cell type. Consequently, the release of free energy with
the hydrolysis of ATP will vary with cell type. Using the following table, calculate the G for the hydrolysis of ATP in muscle, liver, and brain cells. In which cell type is the free energy of
ATP hydrolysis greatest?

Liver
Muscle
Brain

12. Running downhill. Glycolysis is a series of 10 linked reactions that convert one molecule of glucose into two molecules of
pyruvate with the concomitant synthesis of two molecules of
ATP (Chapter 16). The G° for this set of reactions is 8.5

kcal mol1 (35.6 kJ mol1), whereas the G is 18.3 kcal
mol1 (76.6 kJ mol1). Explain why the free-energy release is
so much greater under intracellular conditions than under standard conditions.

13. Activated sulfate. Fibrinogen contains tyrosine-O-sulfate.
Propose an activated form of sulfate that could react in vivo with
the aromatic hydroxyl group of a tyrosine residue in a protein to
form tyrosine-O-sulfate.
Data Interpretation
14. Opposites attract. The following graph shows how the G
for the hydrolysis of ATP varies as a function of the Mg2 concentration (pMg  log 1/[Mg2]).

15. Coupled reactions. The most obvious role of enzymes is to
accelerate reactions, but a second critical role is to couple reactions that would ordinarily be unrelated. From what you have
learned from the text and the Conceptual Insights module on
energetic coupling, explain why the coupling of chemical reactions in a single enzyme is critical for life.
