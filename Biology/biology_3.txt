Biology For Dummies, 2nd Edition

Introduction

L

ife is all around you, from invisible microbes and green plants to the
other animals with whom you share the Earth. What’s more, these other
living things aren’t just around you — they’re intimately interconnected with
your life. Plants make your food and provide you with oxygen, microbes
break down dead matter and recycle materials that all living things need, and
insects pollinate the plants you rely on for food. Ultimately, all living beings
rely on other living beings for their survival.
What makes biology so great is that it allows you to explore the interconnectedness of the world’s organisms and really understand that living beings are
works of art and machines rolled into one. Organisms can be as delicate as a
mountain wildflower or as awe-inspiring as a majestic lion. And regardless of
whether they’re plants, animals, or microbes, all living things have numerous
working parts that contribute to the function of the whole being. They move,
obtain energy, use raw materials, and make waste, whether they’re as simple
as a single-celled organism or as complex as a human being.
Biology is the key you need to unlock the mysteries of life. Through it, you
discover that even single-celled organisms have their complexities, from
their unique structures to their diverse metabolisms. Biology also helps you
realize what a truly miraculous machine your body is, with its many different
systems that work together to move materials, support your structure, send
signals, defend you from invaders, and obtain the matter and energy you
need for growth.

About This Book
Biology For Dummies, 2nd Edition, takes a look at the characteristics all living
things share. It also provides an overview of the concepts and processes
that are fundamental to living things. We put an emphasis on looking at how
human beings meet their needs, but we also take a look at the diversity of life
on planet Earth.

Biology For Dummies, 2nd Edition

Conventions Used in This Book
To help you find your way through the subjects in this book, we use the following style conventions:
✓ Italics highlight new words or terms that are defined in the text. They
also point out words we want to emphasize.
✓ Boldface indicates key words in bulleted lists or the action parts of numbered steps.
✓ Monofont points out Web addresses so you can recognize them easily.
✓ Sidebars are gray-shaded boxes that contain text that’s interesting to
know but not necessarily critical to your understanding of the chapter
or section topic.
Also, whenever we introduce scientific terms, we try to break the words
down for you so that the terms become tied to their meanings, making them
easier to remember.

What You’re Not to Read
Throughout this book you’ll find paragraphs marked with a Technical Stuff
icon and sidebars (gray-shaded boxes). The Technical Stuff paragraphs
provide more in-depth explanation of a topic or concept, and the sidebars
include stories or information related to the main topic. They’re fun to read,
but they’re by no means necessary for a thorough understanding of biology.
So skip over them if you want to or read them to your heart’s content — the
choice is yours!

Foolish Assumptions
As we wrote this book, we tried to imagine who you are and what you need in
order to understand biology. Here’s what we came up with:
✓ You’re a high school student taking biology, possibly in preparation for
an advanced placement test or college entrance examination. If you’re
having trouble in biology class and your textbook isn’t making much
sense, try reading the relevant section of this book first to give yourself
a foundation and then go back to your textbook or notes.
✓ You’re a college student who isn’t a science major but is taking a biology
class to help fulfill your degree requirements. If you want help following
along in class, try reading the relevant sections in this book before you

Introduction
go to a lecture on a particular topic. If you need to fix a concept in your
brain, read the related section after class.
✓ You’re someone who just wants to know a little bit more about the
living world around you. Good news . . . this book is your oyster! Read
it at your leisure, starting with whatever topic fascinates you most. We
include several examples of how biology impacts everyday life to help
keep your interest piqued.

How This Book Is Organized
Biology For Dummies, 2nd Edition, is organized so that it mirrors the order
of topics covered in a typical biology class. Like all For Dummies books, each
chapter is self-contained, so you can pick up this book whenever you need it
and jump straight into the topic you’re working on.
Note: After we explain a subject, we use that information in later topics. If
you don’t read the book in order, you may occasionally have to refer back to
an earlier section for some background information. When that’s the case, we
refer you to the appropriate chapter.

Part I: Biology Basics
If biology is the study of life and life is so complex, then you may be wondering where to even begin in your study of biology. Never fear. This part breaks
down the all-encompassing field of biology into smaller, more palatable
chunks.
First, we take a look at the living world and then explain exactly how biology
is studied (hint: the scientific method is a huge part of it). Next, we give you
a review of the types of molecules that are important to a cell’s functioning
(yes, this means delving into some basic chemistry; sorry!). Then we spotlight the most basic unit of life — the cell. Every organism, whether it’s a
human, a dog, a flower, a strep throat bacterium, or an amoeba, has at least
one cell (most actually have millions). Finally, because cells need energy to
function, we explain just where that energy comes from.

Part II: Cell Reproduction and Genetics:
Let’s Talk about Sex, Baby
How do you get a multicellular human from a one-celled embryo? Cellular
reproduction, of course! Cells can make exact copies of themselves in order

3

4

Biology For Dummies, 2nd Edition
to repair, grow, or produce offspring that are genetically identical to the
parent cell. You find out all about that in this part, as well as how some
organisms mix things up by engaging in sexual reproduction, creating offspring that have combinations of genes that are different from those of their
parents.
Regardless of whether organisms reproduce asexually or sexually, the traits
of the parents are visible in the offspring because parents pass DNA on to
their offspring. As you discover in this part, DNA contains the blueprints for
proteins that do the work in cells and thus determine the characteristics of
the offspring.

Part III: It’s a Small, Interconnected World
All the amazingly diverse forms of life on Earth interact with each other (if
they didn’t, life on this planet would be in big trouble). This part allows you
to explore all the ways life on Earth is connected, as well as how biologists
classify organisms. You also get to discover how yesterday’s living beings are
connected to today’s living beings through biological evolution.

Part IV: Systems Galore! Animal
Structure and Function
Organisms respond to changes in their environment, trying to maintain their
internal conditions within a range that supports life. Animals have many different systems designed to support this struggle for balance. In this part of
the book, we present most of the systems that support the structure and
function of the human body, as well as those of other animals. These systems
coordinate many functions in animals, such as digestion, movement, circulation, gas exchange, and defense.

Part V: It’s Not Easy Being Green:
Plant Structure and Function
Plants, your green neighbors, often get overlooked in the hustle and bustle
of animal life. However, the importance of plants to life on Earth simply can’t
be overstated. After all, without them, you wouldn’t have any food. When you
take the time to study plants, you find that they’re actually pretty interesting.
Just like animals, they’re made of cells and have systems to transport materials around their bodies and exchange matter and energy with their environment, all of which you find out in this part.

Introduction

Part VI: The Part of Tens
No For Dummies book would be complete without The Part of Tens and its
chapters containing fun and interesting facts. When you venture to this part,
prepare to find out about ten great biology discoveries and ten ways biology
affects your life.

Icons Used in This Book
We use some of the familiar For Dummies icons to help guide you and give you
new insights as you read the material. Here’s the scoop on what each one means.
The information highlighted with this icon is stuff we think you should permanently store in your mental biology file. If you want a quick review of biology, scan
through the book reading only the paragraphs marked with Remember icons.
Next to these icons lie paragraphs that give you extra information but
aren’t necessary to understanding the material in the chapter. If you want
to take your understanding of biology to a higher level, or if you just want
to build your knowledge base of interesting facts, incorporate these paragraphs into your reading. If you just want the basics and don’t want to bother
with nonessential information, skip them.
This bull’s-eye symbol offers pointers that help you remember the facts presented in a particular section so you can better commit them to memory.

Where to Go from Here
Where you start reading is up to you. However, we do have a few suggestions:
✓ If you’re currently in a biology class and having trouble with a particular
topic, jump right to the chapter or section featuring the subject that’s
confusing you.
✓ If you’re using this book as a companion to a biology class that’s just
beginning, you can follow along with the topics being discussed in class
with one small exception. Many biology classes work from the smallest
to the largest, beginning with molecules and then moving on to cells. We
prefer to start with cells to give you an idea of where everything is happening before moving on to the molecules.
Whatever your situation, the table of contents and index can help you find
the information you need.

In this part . . .

iology is the study of living things — how they
reproduce, how they change and respond to the
environment, and how they obtain the energy and matter
they need to grow. One goal of this part is to immerse you
in the world of biology so you can understand how biologists go about studying living things and know what chemical components make up all forms of life.
Living things with many cells, like you, are made up of
organ systems, organs, tissues, and cells. Cells are the
smallest entities that show all the properties of life, so
that’s where we begin zeroing in on things. The other goal
of this part is to acquaint you with the structure of cells
and how they obtain the energy they need to function.

Chapter 1

Exploring the Living World
In This Chapter
▶ Seeing how cells are part of all living things
▶ Finding out the fundamentals of where babies come from and why you have the traits

you do
▶ Recognizing that all of Earth’s ecosystems are interconnected
▶ Surveying animal anatomy and physiology
▶ Exploring the similarities and differences between plants and people

B

iology is the study of life, as in the life that covers the surface of the
Earth like a living blanket, filling every nook and cranny from dark
caves and dry deserts to blue oceans and lush rain forests. Living things
interact with all of these environments and each other, forming complex,
interconnected webs of life. For many people, a hike in the forest or a trip
to the beach is a chance to reconnect with the natural world and enjoy the
beauty of life.
In this chapter, we give you an overview of the big concepts of biology. Our
goal is to show you how biology connects to your life and to give you a preview of the topics we explore in greater detail later in this book.

It All Starts with a Cell
Quick. What’s the smallest unit of life you can think of? (Here’s a hint: Try to
recall the basic properties of life; if you can’t, head to Chapter 2 to discover
what they are.) Your mind may automatically call up images of ants, amoebas, or bacteria, but that’s not quite the answer. The absolute smallest unit
of life is a single cell.
Everything an organism’s body does happens because its cells make those
actions happen, whether that organism is a single-celled E. coli bacteria or a
human being made up of approximately 10 trillion cells.

10

Part I: Biology Basics
Of course, the number of cells you have isn’t the only difference between
you and E. coli. The structure of your cells is a little bit different — your
cells have more specialized internal compartments, such as the nucleus that
houses your DNA (we cover cell structure in Chapter 4). Yet you have some
distinct similarities as well. Both you and E. coli are made up of the same raw
materials (flip to Chapter 3 to find out what those are) and have DNA as your
genetic material (more on DNA in Chapter 8). You also use food the same
way (see Chapter 5), and you build your proteins in the same manner (see
Chapter 8).

Life Begets Life: Reproduction
and Genetics
You began life as a single cell, when a sperm cell from your dad met an egg
cell from your mom. Your parents made these reproductive cells through
a special type of cell division called meiosis (we explain meiosis in detail in
Chapter 6). When their reproductive cells combined, your dad and mom each
donated half of your genetic information — 23 chromosomes from mom and
23 from dad — for a total of 46 chromosomes in each of your cells. The genes
on those 46 chromosomes determined your characteristics, from your physical appearance to much of your behavior. The science of genetics tracks the
inheritance of genes and studies how they determine traits (see Chapter 7).
Through genetics, you can understand why your skin is a certain color or
why some traits seem to run in your family.
Your genes are found in your DNA, which is in turn found in your chromosomes. Each chromosome consists of hundreds of different blueprints that
contain the instructions for your cells’ worker molecules (which are mostly
proteins). Each type of cell in your body uses the blueprints found in your
genes to build the proteins it needs to do its particular job. So what exactly
does all that mean? Here it is, plain and simple: DNA determines your traits
because it contains the instructions for the worker molecules (proteins) that
make your traits happen.
Scientists are discovering more and more about DNA; they’re also developing
tools to read and alter the DNA in cells (see Chapter 9). Chances are you’re
already experiencing the impacts of scientists’ work with DNA, even if you
don’t know it. Why? Because scientists use recombinant DNA technology to
alter organisms used in food and medicines. This technology allows them
to take genes from one organism and place them into the cells of another,
changing the characteristics of the receiving organism. For example, scientists alter the cells of bacteria with human genes, turning them into tiny living
factories that produce human proteins needed to treat diseases.

Chapter 1: Exploring the Living World

Making the Connection between
Ecosystems and Evolution
As you discover in Chapter 10, the amazing diversity of life on Earth helps ensure
that life continues in the face of environmental change. Each type of organism
plays a role in the environment, and each one is connected to the other. Green
organisms such as plants combine energy and matter to make the food on which
all life depends, predators hunt prey, and decomposers such as bacteria and
fungi recycle dead matter so it becomes available again to other living things. (For
more on the interconnectedness of all living things on Earth, head to Chapter 11.)
Humans are part of the natural world, and like all living things, we use
resources from the environment and produce wastes. However, the human
species is unusual in its ability to use technology to extend its reach, drawing heavily on the natural resources of the Earth and changing environments
to suit its needs. The human population has expanded to cover most of the
Earth, and the numbers just keep on growing.
Yet as humans draw more heavily upon the Earth’s resources, we’re putting
stress on many other species and possibly driving them to extinction. The
great lesson of biological evolution (a topic we cover in Chapter 12) is that
not only do populations change over time but they’re also capable of going
extinct. The challenge that humans face today is discovering ways to get
what we need but still live in balance with the Earth’s various ecosystems.

Getting Up Close and Personal with the
Anatomy and Physiology of Animals
All animals work hard to maintain homeostasis, or internal balance, as change
occurs in the environment around them (see Chapter 13 for more on homeostasis). In a complex, multicellular animal like you, all of your organ systems
must work together to maintain homeostasis.
Following is a rundown of all of your organ systems, including what they do
and what they consist of:
✓ Skeletal system: Provides support, helps with movement, and forms
blood cells. Made up of your bones (see Chapter 14).
✓ Muscular system: Enables movement. Consists of your skeletal and
smooth muscles (see Chapter 14).

11

12

Part I: Biology Basics
✓ Respiratory system: Brings in oxygen and expels carbon dioxide. Made
up of your lungs and airways (see Chapter 15).
✓ Circulatory system: Transports materials throughout the body. Consists
of your heart, blood, and blood vessels (see Chapter 15).
✓ Digestive system: Takes up nutrients and water and eliminates wastes.
Made up of your stomach, intestines, liver, and pancreas (see Chapter 16).
✓ Excretory system: Maintains the balance of water and electrolytes in
your body and removes wastes. Consists of your kidneys and bladder
(see Chapter 16).
✓ Integumentary system: Serves as your first line of defense against infection. Made up of your skin (see Chapter 17).
✓ Immune system: Defends against foreign invaders. Consists of your
thymus, spleen, and lymph nodes (see Chapter 17).
✓ Nervous system: Controls your body functions via electrical signals.
Made up of your brain, spinal cord, and nerves (see Chapter 18).
✓ Endocrine system: Produces hormones that control your body functions. Consists of your glands (see Chapter 18).
✓ Reproductive system: Is responsible for sexual reproduction. Made
up of ovaries, fallopian tubes, a uterus, a cervix, a vagina, and a vulva
if you’re female, and testes, a scrotum, vas deferens, a prostate gland,
seminal vesicles, and a penis if you’re male (see Chapter 19).

Comparing Plants to People
At first glance, plants seem pretty different from people, but actually humans
and plants occupy nearby branches on the tree of life. Both humans and
plants engage in sexual reproduction, meaning they produce new offspring
from the fusion of sperm and eggs that contain half the genetic material of
the parents (see Chapter 20 for more information on how plants reproduce).
Also like you, plants have systems for moving materials throughout their
bodies (flip to Chapter 21 for the scoop on this), and they even control their
functions with hormones.
Of course, plants also have major differences from humans. Most importantly, they make their own food using carbon dioxide, water, and energy
from the Sun, whereas humans have to eat other organisms to survive. As a
byproduct of their food production, plants give off oxygen as waste. Humans
gladly breathe oxygen in and return the favor by breathing out carbon dioxide that the plants can use to make food (see Chapter 5 for more on photosynthesis and respiration and how they lead to this gas exchange between
humans and plants).

Chapter 2

How Life Is Studied
In This Chapter
▶ Studying life
▶ Using observations to solve the world’s mysteries
▶ Recognizing science as an always-changing thing
▶ Discovering where to find scientists’ research and conclusions

B

iology wouldn’t have gotten very far as a science if biologists hadn’t
used structured processes to conduct their research and hadn’t communicated the results of that research with others. This chapter explores the
characteristics that distinguish living things from the nonliving materials in
the natural world. It also introduces you to the methods scientists (whether
they’re biologists, physicists, or chemists) use to investigate the world around
them and the tools they use to communicate what they’ve discovered.

Living Things: Why Biologists Study
Them and What Defines Them
Biologists seek to understand everything they can about living things,
including
✓ The structure and function of all the diverse living things on planet Earth
✓ The relationships between living things
✓ How living things grow, develop, and reproduce, including how these
processes are regulated by DNA, hormones, and nerve signals
✓ The connections between living things, as well as the connections
between living things and their environment
✓ How living things change over time
✓ How DNA changes, how it’s passed from one living thing to another, and
how it controls the structure and function of living things

14

Part I: Biology Basics
An individual living thing is called an organism. Organisms are part of the
natural world — they’re made of the same chemicals studied in chemistry
and geology, and they follow the same laws of the universe as those studied
in physics. What makes living things different from the nonliving things in the
natural world is that they’re alive. Granted, life is a little hard to define, but
biologists have found a way.
All organisms share eight specific characteristics that define the properties
of life:
✓ Living things are made of cells that contain DNA. A cell is the smallest
part of a living thing that retains all the properties of life. In other words,
it’s the smallest unit that’s alive. DNA, short for deoxyribonucleic acid, is the
genetic material, or instructions, for the structure and function of cells. (We
fill you in on cells, including the differences between plant and animal cells,
in Chapter 4, and we tell you all about the structure of DNA in Chapter 3.)
✓ Living things maintain order inside their cells and bodies. One law
of the universe is that everything tends to become random over time.
According to this law, if you build a sand castle, it’ll crumble back into
sand over time. You never see a castle of any kind suddenly spring up
and build itself or repair itself, organizing all the particles into a complicated castle structure. Living things, as long as they remain alive, don’t
crumble into little bits. They constantly use energy to rebuild and repair
themselves so that they stay intact. (To find out how living things obtain
the energy they need to maintain themselves, turn to Chapter 5.)
✓ Living things regulate their systems. Living things maintain their internal conditions in a way that supports life. Even when the environment
around them changes, organisms attempt to maintain their internal conditions. Think about what happens when you go outside on a cool day
without wearing a coat. Your body temperature starts to drop, and your
body responds by pulling blood away from your extremities to your
core in order to slow the transfer of heat to the air. It may also trigger
shivering, which gets you moving and generates more body heat. These
responses keep your internal body temperature in the right range for
your survival even though the outside temperature is low. (When living
things maintain their internal balance, that’s called homeostasis; you can
find out more about homeostasis in Chapter 13.)
✓ Living things respond to signals in the environment. If you pop up suddenly and say “Boo!” to a rock, it doesn’t do anything. Pop up and say
“Boo!” to a friend or a frog, and you’ll likely see him or it jump. That’s
because living things have systems to sense and respond to signals.
Many animals sense their environment through their five senses just like
you do, but even less familiar organisms, such as plants and bacteria,
can sense and respond. (Have you ever seen a houseplant bend and
grow toward sunlight? Then you’ve seen one of the responses triggered
by a plant cell detecting the presence of light.) Want to know more
about the systems that help plants and animals respond to signals? Flip

Chapter 2: How Life Is Studied
to Chapter 18 to read all about the human nervous system and Chapter
21 to discover the details about plant hormones.
✓ Living things transfer energy among themselves and between themselves and their environment. Living things need a constant supply
of energy to grow and maintain order. Organisms such as plants capture light energy from the Sun and use it to build food molecules that
contain chemical energy. Then the plants, and other organisms that
eat the plants, transfer the chemical energy from the food into cellular
processes. As cellular processes occur, they transfer energy back to the
environment as heat. (For more on how energy is transferred from one
living thing to another, check out Chapter 11.)
✓ Living things grow and develop. You started life as a single cell. That
cell divided to form new cells, which divided again. Now your body is
made of approximately 100 trillion cells. As your body grew, your cells
received signals that told them to change and become special types of
cells: skin cells, heart cells, liver cells, brain cells, and so on. Your body
developed along a plan, with a head at one end and a “tail” at the other.
The DNA in your cells controlled all of these changes as your body
developed. (For the scoop on the changes that occur in animal cells as
they grow and develop, see Chapter 19.)
✓ Living things reproduce. People make babies, hens make chicks, and
plasmodial slime molds make plasmodial slime molds. When organisms
reproduce, they pass copies of their DNA onto their offspring, ensuring
that the offspring have some of the traits of the parents. (Flip to Chapter 6
for full details on how cells reproduce and Chapter 19 for insight into how
animals, particularly humans, make more animals.)
✓ Living things have traits that evolved over time. Birds can fly, but most
of their closest relatives — the dinosaurs — couldn’t. The oldest feathers seen in the fossil record are found on a feathered dinosaur called
Archaeopteryx. No birds or feathers have been found in any fossils that
are older than those of Archaeopteryx. From observations like these, scientists can infer that having feathers is a trait that wasn’t always present
on Earth; rather, it’s a trait that developed at a certain point in time. So,
today’s birds have characteristics that developed through the evolution
of their ancestors. (Ready to dig into the nitty-gritty details of evolution?
See Chapter 12.)

Making Sense of the World
through Observations
The true heart of science isn’t a bunch of facts — it’s the method that scientists use to gather those facts. Science is about exploring the natural world,
making observations using the five senses, and attempting to make sense of

15

16

Part I: Biology Basics
those observations. Scientists, including biologists, use two main approaches
when trying to make sense of the natural world:
✓ Discovery science: When scientists seek out and observe living things,
they’re engaging in discovery science, studying the natural world and
looking for patterns that lead to new, tentative explanations of how
things work (these explanations are called hypotheses). If a biologist
doesn’t want to disturb an organism’s habitat, he or she may use observation to find out how a certain animal lives in its natural environment.
Making useful scientific observations involves writing detailed notes
about the routine of the animal for a long period of time (usually years)
to be sure that the observations are accurate.
Many of the animals and plants you’re familiar with were first identified
during a huge wave of discovery science that took place in the 1800s.
Scientists called naturalists traveled the world drawing and describing
every new living thing they could find. Discovery science continues
today as biologists attempt to identify all the tiniest residents of planet
Earth (bacteria and viruses) and explore the oceans to see the strange
and fabulous creatures that lurk in its depths.
✓ Hypothesis-based science: When scientists test their understanding of
the world through experimentation, they’re engaging in hypothesis-based
science, which usually calls for following some variation of a process
called the scientific method (see the next section for more on this).
Modern biologists are using hypothesis-based science to try and understand many things, including the causes and potential cures of human
diseases and how DNA controls the structure and function of living
things.
Hypothesis-based science can be a bit more complex than discovery science,
which is why we spend the next two sections introducing you to two important elements of hypothesis-based science: scientific method and experiment
design.

Introducing the scientific method
The scientific method is basically a plan that scientists follow while performing scientific experiments and writing up the results. It allows experiments to
be duplicated and results to be communicated uniformly. Here’s the general
process of the scientific method:
1. First, make observations and come up with questions.
The scientific method starts when scientists notice something and ask
questions like “What’s that?” or “How does it work?” just like a child
might when he sees something new.

Chapter 2: How Life Is Studied
2. Then form a hypothesis.
Much like Sherlock Holmes, scientists piece together clues to try and
come up with the most likely hypothesis (explanation) for a set of
observations. This hypothesis represents scientists’ thinking about possible answers to their questions. Say, for example, a marine biologist
is exploring some rocks along a beach and finds a new worm-shaped
creature he has never seen before. His hypothesis is therefore that the
creature is some kind of worm.
One important point about a scientific hypothesis is that it must be testable, or falsifiable. In other words, it has to be an idea that you can support or reject by exploring the situation further using your five senses.
3. Next, make predictions and design experiments to test the idea(s).
Predictions set up the framework for an experiment to test a hypothesis, and
they’re typically written as “if . . . then” statements. In the preceding worm
example, the marine biologist predicts that if the creature is a worm, then its
internal structures should look like those in other worms he has studied.
4. Test the idea(s) through experimentation.
Scientists must design their experiments carefully in order to test just one
idea at a time (we explain how to set up a good experiment in the later
“Designing experiments” section). As they conduct their experiments, scientists make observations using their five senses and record these observations as their results or data. Continuing with the worm example, the
marine biologist tests his hypothesis by dissecting the wormlike creature,
examining its internal parts carefully with the assistance of a microscope,
and making detailed drawings of its internal structures.

Discovery science of the 20th century
Although discovery science about the types
of plants and animals on Earth had its heyday
in the 1800s, discovery science about life on
a level that’s too small to see with the naked
eye is ongoing. One incredibly important project that employed modern discovery science is
the Human Genome Project, which set out to
map where each trait is found on the 46 human
chromosomes.
Instead of traveling across the oceans to
explore the world and catalog living things like
the discovery scientists of 200 years ago, scientists from all over the world set out to explore

the very tiny, but very complex, landscape of
the 46 human chromosomes that contain the
collection of all the genes found in humans.
Each of the 25,000 genes they located provides
information about inherited traits. The traits
range from little things, such as whether you
can curl your tongue or not, to truly important
things, such as whether you have a genetic risk
for developing breast cancer or cystic fibrosis.
By finding out where genes are located, scientists can turn their attention to using this newfound information to develop hypotheses about
cures and gene therapies.

5. Then make conclusions about the findings.
Scientists interpret the results of their experiments through deductive
reasoning, using their specific observations to test their general hypothesis. When making deductive conclusions, scientists consider their original hypothesis and ask whether it could still be true in light of the new
information gathered during the experiment. If so, the hypothesis can
remain as a possible explanation for how things work. If not, scientists
reject the hypothesis and try to come up with an alternate explanation
(a new hypothesis) that could explain what they’ve seen. In the earlier
worm example, the marine biologist discovers that the internal structures of the wormlike creature look very similar to another type of worm
he’s familiar with. He can therefore conclude that the new animal is
likely a relative of that other type of worm.
6. Finally, communicate the conclusions with other scientists.
Communication is a huge part of science. Without it, discoveries can’t be
passed on, and old conclusions can’t be tested with new experiments.
When scientists complete some work, they write a paper that explains
exactly what they did, what they saw, and what they concluded. Then
they submit that paper to a scientific journal in their field. Scientists
also present their work to other scientists at meetings, including those
sponsored by scientific societies. In addition to sponsoring meetings,
these societies support their respective disciplines by printing scientific
journals and providing assistance to teachers and students in the field.

Designing experiments
Any scientific experiment must have the ability to be duplicated because the
“answer” the scientist comes up with (whether it supports or refutes the original hypothesis) can’t become part of the scientific knowledge base unless other
scientists can perform the exact same experiment and achieve the same results.
When a scientist designs an experiment, he tries to develop a plan that
clearly shows the effect or importance of each factor tested by his experiment. Any factor that can be changed in an experiment is called a variable.
Three kinds of variables are especially important to consider when designing
experiments:
✓ Experimental variables: The factor you want to test is an experimental
variable (also called an independent variable).
✓ Responding variables: The factor you measure is the responding variable (also called a dependent variable).
✓ Controlled variables: Any factors that you want to remain the same
between the treatments in your experiment are controlled variables.

Chapter 2: How Life Is Studied
Scientific experiments help people answer questions about the natural world.
To design an experiment:
1. Make observations about something you’re interested in and use
inductive reasoning to come up with a hypothesis that seems like a
good explanation or answer to your question.
Inductive reasoning uses specific observations to generate general
principles.
2. Think about how to test your hypothesis, creating a prediction about
it using an “if . . . then” statement.
3. Decide on your experimental treatment, what you’ll measure, and
how often you’ll make measurements.
The condition you alter in your experiment is your experimental variable. The changes you measure are your responding variables.
4. Create two groups for your experiment: an experimental group and a
control group.
The experimental group receives the experimental treatment; in other
words, you vary one condition that might affect this group. The control
group should be as similar as possible to your experimental group, but
it shouldn’t receive the experimental treatment.
5. Set up your experiment, being careful to control all the variables
except the experimental variable.
6. Make your planned measurements and record the quantitative and
qualitative data in a notebook.
Quantitative data is numerical data, such as height, weight, and number of
individuals who showed a change. It can be analyzed with statistics and
presented in graphs. Qualitative data is descriptive data, such as color,
health, and happiness. It’s usually presented in paragraphs or tables.
Be sure to date all of your observations.
7. Analyze your data by comparing the differences between your experimental and control groups.
You can calculate the averages for numerical data and create graphs
that illustrate the differences, if any, between your two groups.
8. Use deductive reasoning to decide whether your experiment supports
or rejects your hypothesis and to compare your results with those of
other scientists.
9. Report your results, being sure to explain your original ideas and how
you conducted your experiment, and describe your conclusions.
As an example of how you design an experiment, imagine you’re a marathon
runner who trains with a group of friends. You wonder whether you and your

19

20

Part I: Biology Basics
friends will be able to run marathons faster when you eat pasta the night
before the race. To answer your question, follow the scientific method and
design an experiment.
1. Form your hypothesis.
Your hunch is that loading up on pasta will give you the energy you
need to run faster the next day. Translate that hunch into a proper
hypothesis, which looks something like this: The time it takes to run a
marathon is improved by consuming large quantities of carbohydrates
prerace.
2. Treat one group with your experimental variable.
In order to test your hypothesis, convince half of your friends to eat lots
of pasta the night before the race. Because the factor you want to test
is the effect of eating pasta, pasta consumption is your experimental
variable.
3. Create a control group that doesn’t receive the experimental variable.
You need a comparison group for your experiment, so you convince half
of your friends to eat a normal, nonpasta meal the night before the race.
For the best results in your experiment, this control group should be
as similar as possible to your experimental group so you can be pretty
sure that any effect you see is due to the pasta and not some other
factor. So, ideally, both groups of your friends are about the same age,
same gender, and same fitness level. They’re also eating about the same
thing before the race — with the sole exception being the pasta. All the
factors that could be different between your two groups (age, gender,
fitness, and diet) but that you try to control to keep them the same are
your controlled variables.
4. Measure your responding variable.
Race time is your responding variable because you determine the effect
of eating pasta by timing how long it takes each person in your group
to run the race. Because scientists carefully record exact measurements from their experiments and present that data in graphs, tables,
or charts, you average the race times for your friends in each of the two
groups and present the information in a small table.
5. Compare results from your two groups and make your conclusions.
If your pasta-eating friends ran the marathon an average of two minutes
faster than your friends who didn’t eat pasta, you may conclude that
your hypothesis is supported and that eating pasta does in fact help
marathon runners run faster races.

Chapter 2: How Life Is Studied

One man’s error is another man’s starting point
In the early 1900s, a Russian researcher named
A.I. Ignatowski fed rabbits a diet of milk and
eggs. He found that the rabbits’ aortas developed the same kind of plaques that form in
people with atherosclerosis. Ignatowski wasn’t
ignorant, but he assumed that the atherosclerosis was caused by the proteins in the milk and
eggs. He was wrong.
A younger researcher who was working in
the same pathology department at the time,
a Russian named Nikolai Anichkov, knew of
Ignatowski’s work. Anichkov and some of his
colleagues repeated Ignatowski’s study with
one small change: They split the rabbits into

three different groups. The first group was fed
a supplement of muscle fluid, the second group
was fed only egg whites, and the third group
was fed only egg yolks. Only the yolk-eating
rabbits developed plaques in their aortas. The
young researchers ran the experiment again;
this time they analyzed the atherosclerotic
plaques to look for any concentrated chemical substances. In 1913, Anichkov and his colleagues discovered that cholesterol in the egg
yolk was responsible for creating plaques in the
aorta. Their discovery may not have been possible if Ignatowski had never conducted his experiment (or if he’d beaten them to the punch!).

Before you can consider your research complete, you need to look at a few
more factors:
✓ Sample size: The number of individuals who receive each treatment
in an experiment is your sample size. To make any kind of scientific
research valid, the sample size has to be rather large. If you had only
four friends participate in your experiment, you’d have to conduct your
experiment again on much larger groups of runners before you could
proudly proclaim that consuming large quantities of carbohydrates prerace helps marathon runners improve their speed.
✓ Replicates: The number of times you repeat the entire experiment, or
the number of groups you have in each treatment category, are your
replicates. Suppose you have 60 marathon-running friends and you
break them into six groups of 10 runners each. Three groups eat pasta,
and three groups don’t, so you have three replicates of each treatment.
(Your total sample size is therefore 30 for each treatment.)
✓ Statistical significance: The mathematical measure of the validity of an
experiment is referred to as statistical significance. Scientists analyze
their data with statistics in order to determine whether the differences
between groups are significant. If an experiment is performed repeatedly
and the results are within a narrow margin, the results are said to be

21

22

Part I: Biology Basics
significant. In your experiment, if the race times for your friends were very
similar within each group, so that pretty much all of your pasta-eating
friends ran faster than your non-pasta-eating friends, then that twominute difference actually meant something. But what if some pastaeating friends ran slower than non-pasta-eating friends and one or two
really fast friends in the pasta group lowered that group’s overall average?
Then you might question whether the two minutes was really significant, or
whether your two fastest friends just got put in the pasta group randomly.
✓ Error: Science is done by people, and people make mistakes, which is
why scientists always include a statement of possible sources of error
when they report the results of their experiments. Consider the possible
errors in your experiment. What if you didn’t specify anything about the
content of the normal meals to your non-pasta-eating friends? After the
race, you might find out that some of your friends ate large amounts of
other sources of carbohydrates, such as rice or bread. Because your
hypothesis was about the effect of carbohydrate consumption on marathon running, a few non-pasta-eating friends eating rice or bread would
represent a source of error in your experiment.
Whether the scientist is right or wrong isn’t as important as whether he or she
sets up an experiment that can be repeated by other scientists who expect to
get the same result.

Seeing Science as the Constant
Sharing of New Ideas
The knowledge gathered by scientists continues to grow and change slightly
all the time. Scientists are continually poking and prodding at ideas, always
trying to get closer to “the truth.” They try to keep their minds open to new
ideas and remain willing to retest old ideas with new technology. Scientists
also encourage argument and debate over ideas because the discussion
pushes them to test their ideas and ultimately adds to the strength of scientific knowledge. Following are some of the facts about scientific ideas that
illustrate how science is ever-evolving:
✓ Today’s scientists are connected to scientists of the past because new scientific ideas are built upon the foundations of earlier work. For instance,
a scientist working in a particular area of biology reads all the scientific
publications he can that relate to his work to be sure he has the best understanding possible of what has already been done and what’s already known.

Chapter 2: How Life Is Studied
That way, he can plan research that will advance the understanding in his
field and add new knowledge to the scientific knowledge base.
✓ Some scientific ideas are very old but still applicable today.
Occasionally, new technology enables scientists to test old hypotheses
in new ways, leading to new perspectives and changes in ideas. Case
in point: Up until the 1970s, scientists looking through microscopes
thought only two main types of cells made up living things. When scientists of the ’70s used new technology to compare the genetic code of
cells, they realized that living things are actually made up of three main
types of cells — two of the types just happen to look the same under
a microscope. Of course, old ideas aren’t always proved completely
wrong — for example, scientists still recognize the two structural types
of cells — but big ideas can shift slightly in the face of new information.
✓ When many lines of research support a particular hypothesis, the
hypothesis becomes a scientific theory. A scientific theory is an idea
that’s supported by a great deal of evidence and hasn’t been proven
false despite repeated tests. Scientific theories don’t change as often as
scientific hypotheses due to the significant evidence backing them up,
but even scientific theories can shift in light of new evidence. Ideally, scientists always keep an open mind and look at new evidence objectively.

Conflicting reports mean science is working
Sure, it’s aggravating when the media reports
conflicting findings — such as margarine is
better for your cholesterol level but it also produces harmful fatty acids that contribute to
heart disease — but conflicting news reports
are a sign that science is alive and well. For
example, when scientists figured out that high
cholesterol levels contributed to heart disease,
they correctly determined that a product created from vegetable oil rather than animal
fat — in other words, margarine rather than
butter — was a healthier choice if you were
trying to lower your cholesterol level.
But scientists don’t just leave things alone.
They keep wondering, questioning, and

pondering. They’re curious guys and gals,
which is why they kept researching margarine.
Recently, they discovered that when margarine breaks down, it releases trans fatty acids,
which were found to be harmful to the heart
and blood vessels. So, margarine has bad
aspects that may outweigh the good. Yes, this
can make decisions at the grocery store more
confusing, but it can also lead to better health
for everyone. Case in point: After the information about trans fatty acids became known,
food companies started developing new ways
to make margarine and other foods so that they
don’t contain trans fatty acids.

23

24

Part I: Biology Basics

Tracking Down Scientific Information
Scientists publish their work in part because scientists in different areas of
the world may be trying to answer the same questions and could benefit from
seeing how someone else approached the problem. The other part is that if
scientists didn’t put their work out there, flaws and all, no one would ever
know the work was being done. The sections that follow provide an overview
of the different sources scientists use to communicate with each other (and
the rest of the world).

Journals: Not just for recording dreams
Hundreds of scientific journals cover every topic and niche imaginable in
the fields of biology, chemistry, physics, engineering, and so on. They’re
published by numerous organizations, including professional groups, universities or medical centers, and medical and scientific publishing companies.
Regardless of their subject matter or where they come from, all scientific
journals have one common characteristic: They’re all considered a primary
source of scientific information, meaning they contain a full description of the
original research written by the original researchers.
Anyone researching a topic, whether he’s a student or a scientist, consults
the journals first. They contain the original research papers, which means
you can always find the latest information in a specific field in a journal. The
research papers are written following the scientific style of an abstract (summary). First, there’s a statement of the hypothesis. Next come a description
of the materials used; a description of how the experiment was designed and
performed; and the results of the experiment, including raw data, graphs,
and tables. Finally, the paper notes the author’s conclusions and errors that
occurred during the experiment(s).
Scientific journals undergo a peer-review process to help ensure the reliability
of published scientific information. Here’s how the process works: The editor
of a scientific journal sends a research paper out to other scientists who work
in the same field as the scientist(s) who wrote the paper to examine and comment on the work. They’re tasked with making sure the science is thorough
and that the research adds to the scientific knowledge base. The editor then
decides whether or not to publish the paper based on the other scientists’
comments. If the reviewers’ and editor’s stringent criteria aren’t meant, the
research paper can’t be published in the journal.
Although many scientific journals are available online, you may not be able to
access the articles without paying a fee. However, if you’re a student at a college
or university, your school library may subscribe to various scientific journals.
Ask a member of the library staff whether the school subscribes to any scientific journals and, if so, how you can access them via the library’s computers.

Chapter 2: How Life Is Studied

Textbooks: A student’s go-to source
Textbooks. Whether you love ’em or hate ’em (or could care less about ’em),
textbooks are considered secondary sources of scientific information, meaning
they compile or discuss information taken from primary sources. Secondary
sources aren’t usually written by the original researchers. They present the
knowledge base of a specific topic or field at a certain point in time, which
makes them a good source to turn to for the history of a topic, basic facts
about a certain subject, and summaries of important research that has furthered the field.

The popular press: Not always accurate
The popular press — regular ol’ newspapers, magazines, and television
and radio programs, are considered tertiary sources (meaning they’re twice
removed from the original source of information). The popular press provides information, of course, but the validity of that information isn’t guaranteed. There’s always a chance that the journalist doing the reporting may
have misunderstood the scientist’s research or something he said. It’s like
that old childhood game where the information given to the first person is
usually changed by the time it gets relayed to the last person.
You’re always better off citing an article in a journal or textbook before one
from a major media outlet.

The Internet: A wealth of information,
not all of it good
Lots of scientific information is available on the Internet, and much of it is
available for free. The trick is distinguishing the good stuff from the bad. To
find good-quality scientific information:
✓ Visit government Web sites. These Web sites end in .gov. Some primary literature is available on government Web sites, but even the
secondary literature is usually of high quality. If you use the advanced
search feature on your web browser, you should be able to restrict your
searches to the types of domains you’re interested in.
✓ Surf university Web sites. These Web sites end in .edu. Some university scientists post copies of their papers, which are examples of primary literature, and others post good-quality lecture notes and articles.
(Better yet, if you’re a student at a college or university, access the
primary literature — scientific journals — through your school library’s
subscription service.)

25

26

Part I: Biology Basics
✓ Be careful when visiting organization Web sites. These Web sites
end in .org. Large organizations with good reputations, such as the
American Heart Association, usually have good-quality secondary information on their sites; they may even post links to primary sources.
However, smaller organizations that don’t have an established reputation aren’t good sources for scientific information.
Avoid commercial Web sites (those with .com endings) when you’re looking
for scientific information. People and organizations operating commercial
sites are trying to sell you something. They have an agenda of their own,
which means you can’t trust that they’re completely unbiased. The information they present may be one-sided or not accepted as reliable by the scientific community.

verything that has mass and takes up space, including you and the rest
of life on Earth, is made of matter. Atoms make up molecules, which
make up the substance of living things. Carbohydrates, proteins, nucleic
acids, and lipids are four kinds of molecules that are especially important to
the structure and function of organisms. In this chapter, we present a bit of
the basic chemistry that’s essential for understanding biology.

Exploring Why Matter Matters
Matter is the stuff of life — literally. Every living thing is made of matter. In
order to grow, living things must get more matter to build new structures.
When living things die, be they plants or animals, microbes such as bacteria
and fungi digest the dead matter and recycle it so that other living things
can use it again. In fact, pretty much all the matter on Earth has been here
since the planet formed 4.5 billion years ago; it has just been recycled since
then. So, the stuff that makes up your body may once have been part of
Tyrannosaurus rex, a butterfly, or even a bacterium.

28

Part I: Biology Basics

Invisible matter
What looks like nothing but is really something?
Air! Earth’s atmosphere may seem like nothing,
but it’s made of gases such as nitrogen, carbon
dioxide, and oxygen. These gases interact with
living things in many ways. Plants, for example,
take in carbon dioxide to make food and then
use that food to build their structures. It’s hard

to believe, but the tallest tree in the redwood
forest grows and grows from the result of invisible carbon dioxide gas being taken in and incorporated into the body of the tree. Obviously the
redwood tree takes up space and has mass,
but those invisible carbon dioxide molecules
are matter too.

Following are a few facts you should know about matter:
✓ Matter takes up space. Space is measured in volume, and volume is measured in liters (L).
✓ Matter has mass. Mass is the term for describing the amount of matter
that a substance has. It’s measured in grams (g). Earth’s gravity pulls on
your mass, so the more mass you have, the more you weigh.
✓ Matter can take several forms. The most familiar forms of matter are
solids, liquids, and gases. Solids have a definite shape and size, such as
a person or a brick. Liquids have a definite volume. They can fill a container, but they take the shape of the container that they fill. Gases are
easy to compress and expand to fill a container.
To understand the difference between mass and weight, compare your weight
on Earth versus your weight on the Moon. No matter where you are, your
body is made of the same amount of stuff, or matter. But the Moon is so much
smaller than Earth that it has a lot less gravity to pull on your mass. So, your
weight on the Moon would be just one-sixth of your weight on Earth, but your
mass would remain the same!

Recognizing the Differences between
Atoms, Elements, and Isotopes
All matter is composed of elements. When you break down matter into its smallest
components, you’re left with individual elements that themselves break down into
atoms consisting of even smaller pieces called subatomic particles. And sometimes the number of those subatomic particles within a particular atom differs,

Chapter 3: The Chemistry of Life
creating isotopes. Whew. That’s a lot to take in, which is why we break the concepts of atoms, elements, and isotopes down for you in the sections that follow.

“Bohr”ing you with atoms
An atom is the smallest whole, stable piece of an element that still has all the
properties of that element. It’s the smallest “piece” of matter that can be measured. Every atom actually contains even smaller pieces known collectively
as subatomic particles. These include protons, neutrons, and electrons (and
even quarks, mesons, leptons, and neutrinos). Subatomic particles can’t be
removed from an atom without destroying the atom.
Here’s the basic breakdown of an atom’s structure (see Figure 3-1):
✓ The core of an atom, called the nucleus, contains two kinds of subatomic
particles: protons and neutrons. Both have mass, but only one carries any
kind of charge. Protons carry a positive charge, but neutrons have no charge
(they’re neutral). Because the protons are positive and the neutrons have
no charge, the net charge of an atom’s nucleus is positive.
✓ Clouds of electrons surround the nucleus. Electrons carry a negative
charge but have no mass.
Atoms become ions when they gain or lose electrons. In other words, ions are
essentially charged atoms. Positive (+) ions have more protons than electrons;
negative (–) ions have more electrons than protons. Positive and negative
charges attract one another, allowing atoms to form bonds, as explained in the
later “Molecules, Compounds, and Bonds” section.

Elements of elements
An element is a substance made of atoms that have the same number of protons. Think of them as “pure” substances all made of the same thing. All the
known elements are organized into the periodic table of elements (shown in
Figure 3-2), which has the following properties:
✓ Each row of the table is called a period. Moving across the table horizontally, you go from metals to nonmetals, with heavy metals in the
middle.
✓ Each column is called a family or group. Elements within the same
family/group have similar properties. The size of the atom increases
from top to bottom within each column.

B. Sodium and chloride ions joining to form table salt. The sodium ion has a
positive charge because there’s one more proton than electrons, so the overall
charge is positive. The chloride ion is negative because after it accepts the electron
from sodium, it then has one more electron than protons (18 versus 17), so the
overall charge is negative. Together, though, NaCl is neutral because the "plus 1"
charge is balanced by the "minus 1" charge.

Notice in Figure 3-2 how each element has a number associated with it? That
number is the atomic number — the number of protons in the nucleus of an atom
of a particular element. For example, carbon (the letter C in the periodic table)
has six protons in the nucleus of one atom, so its atomic number is 6. Periodic law
states that the properties of elements are a periodic function of their atomic numbers. In other words, when elements are arranged by their atomic number, they
form groups with similar properties. The number of electrons in one atom of an
element is also equal to the atomic number because atoms are neutral (the positively charged particles are offset by the negatively charged particles one for one).
Of all the elements in the periodic table, living things use only a handful. The
four most common elements found in living things are hydrogen, carbon,
nitrogen, and oxygen, all of which are found in air, plants, and water. (Several
other elements exist in smaller amounts in organisms, including sodium, magnesium, phosphorus, sulfur, chlorine, potassium, and calcium.)
Most often, the elements sodium, magnesium, chlorine, potassium, and calcium
circulate in the body as electrolytes, substances that release ions (described in
the preceding section) when they break apart in water. For instance, when in the
“water” of the body, sodium chloride (NaCl) breaks apart into the ions Na+ and Cl–,
which are then used either in organs such as the heart or in cellular processes.

31

Part I: Biology Basics

I so dig isotopes
All atoms of an element have the same number of protons, but the number
of neutrons can change. If the number of neutrons is different between two
atoms of the same element, the atoms are called isotopes of the element.
For example, carbon-12 and carbon-14 are two isotopes of the element
carbon. Atoms of carbon-12 have 6 protons and 6 neutrons. These carbon
atoms have a mass number of 12 because their mass is equal to 12. Atoms of
carbon-14 still have 6 protons (because all carbon atoms have 6 protons), but
they have 8 neutrons, giving them a mass number of 14.
The atomic mass of an element is the average mass of all the isotopes of that
element, taking into account their relative abundance. If you look back at the
periodic table in Figure 3-2, you can see that the atomic mass of carbon (written underneath the letter C) is 12.01. This number tells you that if you took
the average of the mass of all the carbon atoms on Earth, they’d average out
to 12.01. The most stable isotope of carbon is carbon-12, so it’s more abundant than carbon-14. (When you average the mass of lots of atoms of carbon12 with some of carbon-14, you get a number slightly larger than 12.)

Molecules, Compounds, and Bonds
When you start putting elements together, you get more complex forms of
matter, such as molecules and compounds. Molecules are made of two or
more atoms, and compounds are molecules that contain at least two different
elements.
One way to sort out the differences between elements, molecules, and compounds is to think about making chocolate chip cookies. First, you need to mix
the wet ingredients: butter, sugar, eggs, and vanilla. Consider each of those
ingredients a separate element. You need two sticks of the element butter.
When you combine butter plus butter, you get a molecule of butter. Before
you add the element of eggs, you need to beat them. So, when you add egg
plus egg in a little dish, you get a molecule of eggs. When all the wet ingredients are mixed together, the molecule of butter is combined with the molecule
of eggs, and you get a compound called “wet.” Next, you need to mix together
the dry ingredients: flour, salt, and baking soda. Think of each of those ingredients as a separate element. When all the dry ingredients are mixed together,
you get a compound called “dry.” Only when the wet compound is mixed with
the dry compound is the reaction sufficiently ready for the most important
element: the chocolate chips.

Chapter 3: The Chemistry of Life
So what holds the elements of molecules and compounds together? Bonds, of
course. Two important types of bonds exist in living things:
✓ Ionic bonds hold ions joined together by their opposite electrical
charges. Ionic reactions occur when atoms combine and lose or gain
electrons. When sodium (Na) and chlorine (Cl) combine, for example,
sodium loses an electron to chlorine. Sodium becomes the positively
charged sodium ion (Na+), and chlorine becomes the negatively charged
chloride ion (Cl–). These two oppositely charged ions are attracted to
each other, forming an ionic bond.
✓ Covalent bonds are formed when atoms share electrons in a covalent
reaction. When two oxygen atoms join together to form oxygen gas,
they share two pairs of electrons with each other. Each shared pair of
electrons is one covalent bond, so the two pairs of shared electrons
in a molecule of oxygen gas have a double bond. Covalent bonds are
extremely important in biology because they hold together the backbones of all biological molecules.

Acids and Bases (Not a
Heavy Metal Band)
Some substances, such as lemon juice and vinegar, have a real edge when
you taste them. Others, such as battery acid and ammonia, are so caustic you
don’t even want to get them on your skin. These substances are acids and
bases, both of which have the potential to damage cells.
✓ Acids are molecules that can split apart in water and release hydrogen
ions (H+). A common example is hydrochloric acid (HCl). When HCl is
added to water, it splits apart into H+ and Cl–, increasing the number of
hydrogen ions in the water/HCl solution.
✓ Bases are molecules that can split apart in water and release hydroxide ions (OH–). The most common example is sodium hydroxide
(NaOH). When NaOH is added to water, it splits apart into Na+ and OH–.
Charged particles, like hydrogen and hydroxide ions, can interfere with the chemical bonds that hold molecules together. Because living things are made of molecules, strong acids and bases can release enough of these ions to cause damage.
Even water can split apart to create hydrogen and hydroxide ions. Each water
molecule (H2O) can separate into one hydrogen ion (H+) and one hydroxide
ion (OH–). These ions can easily recombine to reform water molecules and will

33

34

Part I: Biology Basics
keep shifting back and forth between their molecular and ionized forms. In
pure water, the number of hydrogen ions and hydroxide ions are balanced, so
they don’t do any damage to living things.
The relative concentration of hydrogen to hydroxide ions is represented by
the pH scale. The following sections explain the pH scale and how organisms
regulate themselves when their pH gets out of balance.

“Ph”iguring out the pH scale
In the early 1900s, scientists came up with the pH scale, a system of classifying how acidic or basic a solution is. The term pH symbolizes the hydrogen
ion concentration in a solution (for example, what proportion of a solution
contains hydrogen ions). The pH scale goes from 1 to 14. A pH of 7 is neutral,
meaning the amount of hydrogen ions and hydroxide ions in a solution with a
pH of 7 is equal, just like in pure water.
A solution that contains more hydrogen ions than hydroxide ions is acidic,
and the pH of the solution is less than 7. If a molecule releases hydrogen ions
in water, it’s an acid. The more hydrogen ions it releases, the stronger the
acid, and the lower the pH value.
A solution that contains more hydroxide ions than hydrogen ions is basic,
and its pH is higher than 7. Bases dissociate (break apart) into hydroxide ions
(OH–) and a positive ion. The hydroxide ions can combine with H+ to create
water. Because the hydrogen ions are used, the number of hydrogen ions in
the solution decreases, making the solution less acidic and therefore more
basic. So, the more hydroxide ions a molecule releases (or the more hydrogen ions it takes in), the more basic it is.
Table 3-1 shows you the pH of some common substances. Use it to help you
visually figure out the pH scale.

Buffing up on buffers
In organisms, blood or cytoplasm are the “solutions” in which the required
ions (for example, electrolytes) are floating. That’s why most substances in
the body hover around the neutral pH of 7. However, nothing’s perfect, so
the human body has a backup system in case things go awry. A system of buffers exists to help neutralize the blood if excess hydrogen or hydroxide ions
are produced.
Buffers keep solutions at a steady pH by combining with excess hydrogen (H+)
or hydroxide (OH–) ions. Think of them as sponges for hydrogen and hydroxide ions. If a substance releases these ions into a buffered solution, the buffers
will “soak up” the extra ions.
The most common buffers in the human body are bicarbonate ion (HCO3–)
and carbonic acid (H2CO3). Bicarbonate ion carries carbon dioxide through
the bloodstream to the lungs to be exhaled (see Chapter 15 for more on the
respiratory system), but it also acts as a buffer. Bicarbonate ion takes up
extra hydrogen ions, forming carbonic acid and preventing the pH of the
blood from going too low. If the opposite situation occurs and the pH of the
blood gets too high, carbonic acid breaks apart to release some hydrogen
ions, which brings the pH back into balance.
If something goes wrong with the buffer system and the pH drops too low, an
organism can develop acidosis (meaning the blood becomes too acidic). If the
reverse happens and the pH gets too high, an organism can develop alkalosis
(meaning the blood becomes too basic).

Carbon-Based Molecules:
The Basis for All Life
All living things rely pretty heavily on one particular type of molecule:
carbon. The little ol’ carbon atom, with its six protons and an outer shell of
four electrons, is the central focus of organic chemistry, which is the chemistry of living things. When carbon bonds to hydrogen (which happens
frequently in organic molecules), the carbon and hydrogen atoms share a
pair of electrons in a covalent bond. Molecules with lots of carbon-hydrogen
bonds are called hydrocarbons. Nitrogen, sulfur, and oxygen are also often
joined to carbon in organisms.
So where do the carbon-containing molecules come from? The answer’s
simple: food. Some living things, like people, need to eat other living things
to get their food, but some organisms, like plants, can make their own food.
Regardless of the food source, all living things use food as a supply of carboncontaining molecules.
Carbon atoms are central to all organisms because they’re found in carbohydrates, proteins, nucleic acids, and lipids — otherwise known as the structural materials of all living things. The sections that follow describe the roles
of these materials.

Providing energy: Carbohydrates
Carbohydrates, as the name implies, consist of carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen.
The basic formula for carbohydrates is CH2O, meaning the core structure of a
carbohydrate is one carbon atom, two hydrogen atoms, and one oxygen atom.
This formula can be multiplied; for example, glucose has the formula C6H12O6,
which is six times the ratio, but still the same basic formula.
But what is a carbohydrate? Well, carbohydrates are energy-packed compounds. Living creatures can break carbohydrates down quickly, making them
a source of near-immediate energy. However, the energy supplied by carbohydrates doesn’t last long. Therefore, reserves of carbohydrates in the body
must be replenished frequently, which is why you find yourself hungry every
four hours or so. Although carbohydrates are a source of energy, they also
serve as structural elements (such as cell walls in plants).
Carbohydrates come in the following forms:
✓ Monosaccharides: Simple sugars consisting of three to seven carbon
atoms are monosaccharides (see Figure 3-3a). In living things, monosaccharides form ring-shaped structures and can join together to form
longer sugars. The most common monosaccharide is glucose.

Chapter 3: The Chemistry of Life
✓ Disaccharides: Two monosaccharide molecules joined together form a
disaccharide (see Figure 3-3b). Common disaccharides include sucrose
(table sugar) and lactose (the sugar found in milk).
✓ Oligosaccharides: More than two but just a few monosaccharides joined
together are an oligosaccharide (see Figure 3-3c). Oligosaccharides are
important markers on the outsides of your cells (head to Chapter 4 for
more on cells), such as the oligosaccharides that determine whether
your blood type is A or B (people with type O blood don’t have any of
this particular oligosaccharide).
✓ Polysaccharides: Long chains of monosaccharide molecules linked
together form a polysaccharide (see Figure 3-3d). Some of these babies
are huge, and when we say huge, we mean some of them can have
thousands of monosaccharide molecules joined together. Starch and
glycogen, which serve as a means of storing carbohydrates in plants and
animals, respectively, are examples of polysaccharides.

Note that most of the names of carbohydrates end in -ose. Glucose, fructose,
ribose, sucrose, maltose — these are all sugars. A sugar is a carbohydrate
that dissolves in water, tastes sweet, and can form crystals. Just like, well, the
sugar in your sugar bowl.

37

38

Part I: Biology Basics

What’s the big deal about “natural” sugars?
Sugars are an important source of energy and
carbon for living things. Yet many people these
days have a love-hate relationship with sugar.
Overconsumption of sugars such as sucrose
can lead to obesity, diabetes, and tooth decay,
so sometimes people perceive sugar as harmful
to the body. This perception has spawned a huge
branch of the food industry dedicated to finding
alternatives to sucrose. Some products advertise
themselves as healthier because they contain
“natural” sugars such as fructose (the sugar in
fruit). However, fructose really isn’t that different
from sucrose — in fact, it’s one of the two monosaccharides that are part of sucrose. Fructose

is a six-carbon sugar molecule that digests a
little more slowly than glucose and is sweeter
to the taste. So, potentially less fructose can
be used to achieve the same effect as sucrose
or glucose. However, the sweetening power of
fructose depends on the food it’s used in. Often
there isn’t much nutritional difference between
foods sweetened with sucrose and those sweetened with fructose. Plus, much of the commercially available fructose is actually derived from
sucrose, not extracted from fruit. So although
“natural” fruit sugar may sound better, the differences between sugars may be so slight that they
don’t make much difference to the body at all.

The next sections explain how sugars interact with one another and how the
human body stores a particular carbohydrate known as glucose.

Making and breaking sugars
Monosaccharides join together in a process known as dehydration synthesis,
which involves two molecules bonding and losing a water molecule. Figure 3-3b
shows the dehydration synthesis of glucose and fructose to form sucrose.
The term dehydration synthesis may sound technical, but it’s not at all if you
really think about what the words mean. Dehydration, as we’re sure you know,
is what happens when you don’t drink enough water. You dry out because
water is removed (but not completely) from some cells, such as those in your
tongue, to make sure more important cells, like those in your heart or brain,
continue to function. Synthesis means making something. If you really think
about it, in dehydration synthesis, something must be made when water
is removed. That’s exactly what happens. When glucose and fructose get
together, a water molecule is removed from the monosaccharides and given
off as a byproduct of the reaction.
The opposite of dehydration synthesis is hydrolysis. A hydrolysis reaction
breaks down a larger sugar molecule into its original monosaccharides. When
something undergoes hydrolysis, a water molecule splits a compound (hydro
means “water”; lysis means “break apart”). When sucrose is added to water, it
splits apart into glucose and fructose.

Chapter 3: The Chemistry of Life
Converting glucose for storage purposes
Carbohydrates are found in nearly every food, not just bread and pasta. Fruits,
vegetables, and even meats also contain carbohydrates, although meats don’t
contain very many. Basically, any food that contains sugar has carbohydrates,
and most foods are converted to sugars when they’re digested.
When you digest your food, the carbohydrates from it break down into small
sugars such as glucose. Those glucose molecules are then absorbed from
your intestinal cells into your bloodstream, which carries the glucose molecules throughout your entire body. The glucose enters each of your body’s
cells and is used as a source of carbon and energy.
Because glucose provides a rapid source of energy, organisms often keep
some on hand. They store it in various polysaccharides that can be quickly
broken down when glucose is needed. Consider the following list your primer
on the things glucose can be stored as:
✓ Glycogen: Animals, including people, store a polysaccharide of glucose
called glycogen. It has a compact structure, so lots of it can be stored
in cells for later use. Your liver, in particular, keeps a large glycogen
reserve on hand for when you exercise.
✓ Starch: Plants store glucose as the polysaccharide starch. The leaves of
a plant produce sugar during the process of photosynthesis and then
store some of that sugar as starch. When the simple sugars need to be
retrieved for use, the starch is broken down into its smaller components.
Plants also make a polysaccharide of glucose called cellulose. Cellulose plays
a structural role for plants rather than a storage role by giving rigidity to the
plant cells. Most animals, including people, can’t digest cellulose because of
the type of bonds between the glucose molecules. Because cellulose passes
through your digestive tract virtually untouched, it helps maintain the health
of your intestines.

Making life possible: Proteins
Without proteins, living things wouldn’t exist. Many proteins provide structure to cells; others bind to and carry important molecules throughout the
body. Some proteins are involved in reactions in the body when they serve
as enzymes (see Chapter 4 for more on enzymes). Still others are involved
in muscle contraction or immune responses. Proteins are so diverse that we
can’t possibly tell you about all of them. What we can tell you about, however, are the basics of their structure and their most important functions.

39

40

Part I: Biology Basics
The building blocks of proteins
Amino acids, of which there are 20, are the foundation of all proteins. Think
of them as train cars that make up an entire train called a protein. Figure 3-4
shows what one amino acid looks like.
The genetic information in cells calls for amino acids to link together in a
certain order, forming chains called polypeptide chains. Amino acids link
together by dehydration synthesis, just like sugars do (as explained in the
earlier “Making and breaking sugars” section), and each polypeptide chain is
made up of a unique number and order of amino acids.

Proteins are amino acids joined together by peptide bonds. Specific proteins are
created based on the order of amino acids connected together. The order of amino
acids is determined by the genetic code.

The main functions of proteins
One or more polypeptide chains come together to form functional proteins.
Once formed, each protein does a specific job or makes up a specific tissue in
the body.
✓ Enzymes are proteins that speed up the rate of chemical reactions.
Metabolic processes don’t happen automatically; they require enzymes.
For the full scoop on enzymes, head to Chapter 4.
✓ Structural proteins reinforce cells and tissues. Collagen, a structural
protein found in connective tissue (the tissue that joins muscles to bones to
allow movement), is the most abundant protein in animals with a backbone. Connective tissue includes ligaments, tendons, cartilage, bone

Chapter 3: The Chemistry of Life
tissue, and even the cornea of the eye. It provides support in the body,
and it has a great capability to be flexible and resistant to stretching.
✓ Transport proteins move materials around cells and around the body.
Hemoglobin is a transport protein found in red blood cells that carries
oxygen around the body. A hemoglobin molecule is shaped kind of like a
three-dimensional four-leaf clover without a stem. Each leaf of the clover
is a separate polypeptide chain. In the center of the clover, but touching each polypeptide chain, is a heme group with an atom of iron at its
center. When gas exchange occurs between the lungs and a blood cell
(for more on respiration and circulation, see Chapter 15), the iron atom
attaches to the oxygen. Then, the iron-oxygen complex releases from the
hemoglobin molecule in the red blood cell so the oxygen can cross cell
membranes and get inside any cell of the body.

Drawing the cellular road map:
Nucleic acids
Until as recently as the 1940s, scientists thought that genetic information was
carried in the proteins of the body. They thought nucleic acids, a new discovery at the time, were too small to be significant. That all changed in 1953
when James Watson and Francis Crick figured out the structure of a nucleic
acid, proving things were the other way around: Nucleic acids created the
proteins!
Nucleic acids are large molecules that carry tons of small details, specifically
all the genetic information for an organism. Nucleic acids are found in every
living thing — plants, animals, bacteria, and fungi. Just think about that fact
for a moment. People may look different than fungi, and plants may behave
differently than bacteria, but deep down all living things contain the same
chemical “ingredients” making up very similar genetic material.
Nucleic acids are made up of strands of nucleotides. Each nucleotide has three
components of its own:
✓ A nitrogen-containing base called a nitrogenous base
✓ A sugar that contains five-carbon molecules
✓ A phosphate group
That’s it. Your entire genetic composition, personality, and maybe even
your intelligence hinge on molecules containing a nitrogen compound, some
sugar, and a phosphate. The following sections introduce you to the two
types of nucleic acids.

41

42

Part I: Biology Basics
Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA)
You may have heard DNA (short for deoxyribonucleic acid) referred to as
“the double helix.” That’s because DNA contains two strands of nucleotides
arranged in a way that makes it look like a twisted ladder. See for yourself in
Figure 3-5.

P = phosphate
S = sugar
A = adenine
T = thymine
C = cytosine
G = guanine

Figure 3-5:
The twistedladder
model of a
DNA double
helix.

The sides of the ladder are made up of sugar and phosphate molecules,
hence the nickname “sugar-phosphate backbone.” (The name of the sugar in
DNA is deoxyribose.) The “rungs” on the ladder of DNA are made from pairs
of nitrogenous bases from the two strands.
The nitrogenous bases that DNA builds its double helix upon are adenine (A),
guanine (G), cytosine (C), and thymine (T). The order of these chemical letters
spells out your genetic code. Oddly enough, the bases always pair in a certain
way: Adenine always goes with thymine (A-T), and guanine always links up
with cytosine (G-C). These particular base pairs line up just right chemically so
that hydrogen bonds can form between them.
Certain sections of nitrogenous bases along a strand of DNA form a gene. A
gene is a unit that contains the genetic information or codes for a particular

Chapter 3: The Chemistry of Life
protein and transmits hereditary information to the next generation. Whenever
a new cell is made in an organism, the genetic material is reproduced and put
into the new cell. (You can find details about this in Chapter 6.) The new cell
can then create proteins and also pass on the genetic information to the next
new cell.
But genes aren’t found only in reproductive cells. Every cell in an organism
contains DNA (and therefore genes) because every cell needs to make proteins. Proteins control function and provide structure. Therefore, the blueprints of life are stored in each and every cell.
The order of the nitrogenous bases on a strand of DNA (or in a section of the
DNA that makes up a gene) determines the order in which amino acids are
strung together to make a protein. Which protein is produced determines
which structural element is produced within your body (such as muscle
tissue, skin, or hair) or what function can be performed (such as the transportation of oxygen to all the cells).
Every cellular process and every aspect of metabolism is based on genetic
information stored in DNA and thus the production of the proper proteins. If
the wrong protein is produced (as in the case of cancer), then disease occurs.

Ribonucleic acid (RNA)
RNA, short for ribonucleic acid, is a chain of nucleotides that serves as an
important information molecule. It plays an important role in the creation of
new proteins (which we cover in Chapter 8). The structure of RNA is slightly
different from that of DNA.
✓ RNA molecules have only one strand of nucleotides.
✓ The nitrogenous bases used are adenine, guanine, cytosine, and uracil
(rather than thymine).
✓ The sugar in RNA is ribose (not deoxyribose).

Supplying structure, energy,
and more: Lipids
In addition to carbohydrates, proteins, and nucleic acids, your body needs
one more type of large molecule to survive. Yet, if you’re like most people,
you try to avoid too much of it in your diet. We’re talking about fats, which
can be both a blessing and a curse because of their incredible energy density
(the ability to store lots of calories in a small space). The energy density of
fats makes them a highly efficient way for living things to store energy — very
useful when food isn’t always available. But that same energy density makes
it really easy to pack in the calories when you eat fatty foods!

43

44

Part I: Biology Basics
Fats are an example of a type of molecule called lipids. Lipids are hydrophobic
molecules, meaning they don’t mix well with water. You’ve probably heard
the saying that “oil and water don’t mix.” Well, oil is a liquid lipid, so the old
saying is true; it really doesn’t mix with water. Butter and lard are examples
of solid lipids, as are waxes, which are valued for their water-repellent properties on snowboards, skis, and automobiles.
Three major types of lipid molecules exist:
✓ Phospholipids: These lipids, made up of two fatty acids and a phosphate
group, have an important structural function for living things because
they’re part of the membranes of cells (see Chapter 4 for more on cell
membranes). Phospholipids aren’t the type of lipid floating around the
bloodstream clogging arteries.
✓ Steroids: These lipid compounds, consisting of four connecting carbon
rings and a functional group that determines the steroid, generally
create hormones. Cholesterol is a steroid molecule used to make testosterone and estrogen; it’s also found in the membranes of cells. The
downside to cholesterol is that it’s transported around the body by
other lipids. If you have too much cholesterol floating in your bloodstream, then you have an excess of fats carrying it through your bloodstream. This situation is troubling because the fats and cholesterol
molecules can get stuck in your blood vessels, leading to blockages that
cause heart attacks or strokes.
✓ Triglycerides: These fats and oils, which are made up of three fatty acid
molecules and a glycerol molecule, are important for energy storage and
insulation. In people, fats form from an excess of glucose. After the liver
stores all the glucose it can as glycogen, whatever remains is turned into
triglycerides. (Both sugars and fats are made of carbon, hydrogen, and
oxygen, so your cells just rearrange the atoms to convert from one to
another.) The triglycerides float through your bloodstream on their way
to be deposited into adipose tissue — the soft, squishy fat you can see
on your body. Adipose tissue is made up of many, many molecules of fat.
The more fat molecules that are added to the adipose tissue, the bigger
the adipose tissue (and the place on your body that contains it) gets.
Whether a triglyceride is a fat or an oil depends on the bonds between
the carbon and hydrogen atoms.
• Fats contain lots of single bonds between their carbon atoms.
These saturated bonds pack tightly (see Figure 3-6), so fats are solid
at room temperature.
• Oils contain lots of double bonds between their carbon atoms.
These unsaturated bonds don’t pack tightly (see Figure 3-6), so oils
are liquid at room temperature.

Fat provides an energy reserve to your body. When you use up all of your
stored glucose (which doesn’t take long because sugars “burn” quickly in
aerobic conditions), your body starts breaking down glycogen, which is
stored primarily in the liver and muscle. Liver glycogen stores can typically
last 12 or more hours. After that, your body starts breaking down adipose
tissue to retrieve some stored energy. That’s why aerobic exercise, so long as
it’s enough to use up more calories than you took in that day, is the best way
to lose fat. (Notice we didn’t say “pounds” here. Pounds measure everything
in your body’s composition: fat tissue, muscle tissue, and bone, along with
water, your organs, skin, and some incidental stuff.)

E

very living thing has cells. The smallest creatures have only one, yet
they’re as alive as you are. What exactly is a cell? In plain and simple
terms, it’s the smallest living piece of an organism — including you. Without
cells, you’d be a disorganized blob of chemicals that’d just ooze out into the
environment. And that is why the cell is the fundamental unit of life.
You get to explore the purpose and structure of cells in this chapter. And
because cells rely on chemical reactions to make things happen, you also
find out all about enzymes, which are proteins that help speed up the pace of
chemical reactions.

An Overview of Cells
Cells are sacs of fluid that are reinforced by proteins and surrounded by
membranes. Inside the fluid float chemicals and organelles, structures inside
cells that are used during metabolic processes. (Yes, an organism contains
parts that are smaller than a cell, but these structures can’t perform all the
functions of life on their own, so they aren’t considered to be alive.)
A cell is the smallest part of an organism that retains characteristics of the
entire organism. For example, a cell can take in fuel, convert it to energy, and
eliminate wastes, just like the organism as a whole can. Because cells can perform all the functions of life (as shown in Figure 4-1), the cell is the smallest
unit of life.

Cells can be categorized in different ways, according to structure or function,
or in terms of their evolutionary relationships. In terms of structure, scientists categorize cells based on their internal organization:
✓ Prokaryotes don’t have a “true” nucleus in their cells. Nor do they have
organelles. Bacteria and archaea are all prokaryotes.
✓ Eukaryotes have a nucleus in their cells that houses their genetic material.
They also have organelles. Plants, animals, algae, and fungi are all eukaryotes.

Viruses versus bacteria
Viruses (like those that cause the flu, a cold, or
AIDS) aren’t made of cells. Although viruses
make you sick, just like bacteria do, viruses and
bacteria are actually quite different. Viruses
are simpler than bacteria and are made of just
a few molecules. In fact, viruses have so few

parts that they can’t even grow and divide by
themselves (so they’re not considered to be
alive). Viruses can only reproduce if they take
over a host cell and steal its energy and materials (head to Chapter 17 for the details of how
viruses attack cells).

Chapter 4: The Living Cell

Peeking at Prokaryotes
Prokaryotes include cells you’ve probably heard of, such as the bacteria E.
coli and Streptococcus (which causes strep throat), the blue-green algae that
occasionally cause lake closures, and the live cultures of bacteria in yogurt,
as well as some cells you may never have heard of, called archaeans (see
Chapter 10 for more on archaeans).
Whether you’ve heard of a specific prokaryote or not, you’re likely well aware
that bacteria have a pretty bad rap. They seem to make the papers only when
they’re causing problems, such as disease. Behind the scenes, though, bacteria are quietly performing many beneficial tasks for people and the rest of life
on planet Earth. Why, if bacteria could get some good headlines, those headlines might read a little something like this:
✓ Bacteria are used in human food production! Yogurt and cheese are
quite tasty, humans say.
✓ Bacteria can clean up our messes! Oil-eating bacteria help save
beaches, and other bacteria help clean up our sewage.
✓ Normal body bacteria help prevent disease! Bacteria living on the body
can prevent disease-causing bacteria from moving in.
✓ Bacteria are nature’s recyclers! Bacteria release nutrients from dead
matter during decomposition.
✓ Bacteria help plants grow! Nitrogen-fixing bacteria can pull nitrogen out
of the air and convert it to a form that plants can use.
The cells of prokaryotes are fairly simple in terms of structure because they
don’t have internal membranes or organelles like eukaryotic cells do (we
cover all the structures present in eukaryotic cells later in this chapter).
The majority of prokaryotic cells (like the one in Figure 4-2) share these
characteristics:
✓ A plasma membrane forms a barrier around the cell, and a rigid cell wall
outside the plasma membrane provides additional support to the cell.
✓ DNA, the genetic material of prokaryotes, is located in the cytoplasm, in
an area called the nucleoid.
✓ Ribosomes make proteins in the cytoplasm.
✓ Prokaryotes break down food using cellular respiration (which requires
oxygen, as explained in Chapter 5) and another type of metabolism
called fermentation (which doesn’t require oxygen).

Examining the Structure
of Eukaryotic Cells
The living things you’re probably most familiar with — humans, animals,
plants, mushrooms, and molds — are all eukaryotes, but they’re not the only
members of the eukaryote family. Eukaryotes also include many inhabitants
of the microbial world, such as algae, amoebas, and plankton.
Eukaryotes have the following characteristics (see Figures 4-3 and 4-4 for diagrams of eukaryotic cells):
✓ A nucleus that stores their genetic information.
✓ A plasma membrane that encloses the cell and separates it from its
environment.
✓ Internal membranes, such as the endoplasmic reticulum and the Golgi
apparatus, that create specialized compartments inside the cells.
✓ A cytoskeleton made of proteins that reinforces the cells and controls
cellular movements.

Chapter 4: The Living Cell
✓ Organelles called mitochondria that combine oxygen and food to transfer the energy from food to a form that cells can use.
✓ Organelles called chloroplasts, which use energy from sunlight plus
water and carbon dioxide to make food. (Chloroplasts are found only in
the cells of plants and algae.)
✓ A rigid cell wall outside of their plasma membrane. (This is found only in
the cells of plants, algae, and fungi; animal cells just have a plasma membrane, which is soft.)

Cells and the Organelles: Not a
Motown Doo-wop Group
Your body is made of organs, which are made of tissues, which are made of
cells. Just like you have organs that perform specific functions for your body,
cells have organelles that perform specific functions for the cell. Some organelles are responsible for metabolizing food; others are responsible for making
the structures the cell needs to function.
The sections that follow highlight the organelles found in eukaryotic cells and
get you acquainted with their specific functions.
Plant and animal cells are very similar, but they have a few significant differences in their organelles. Plant cells have chloroplasts, large central vacuoles,
and cell walls; animal cells don’t. What animal cells do have that plant cells
don’t are centrioles, small structures that are part of the cytoskeleton and
appear during animal cell division.

Chapter 4: The Living Cell

Holding it all together:
The plasma membrane
The membrane that encloses and defines all cells as separate from their environment is called the plasma membrane, or the cell membrane. The job of the
plasma membrane is to separate the chemical reactions occurring inside the
cell from the chemicals outside the cell.
Thinking of the plasma membrane as an international border controlling what
enters and leaves a particular country is a good way of remembering the
plasma membrane’s function.
The fluid inside a cell, called the cytoplasm, contains all the organelles and
is very different from the fluid found outside the cell. (Cyto means “cell,” and
plasm means “shape.” So, cytoplasm literally means “cell shape,” which is fitting because the plasma membrane is what defines cell shape.)
Animal cells are supported by a fluid protein-and-carbohydrate matrix called
the extracellular matrix. (Extra means “outside,” so extracellular literally
means “outside the cell.”) Plant cells are supported by a more solid structure, called a cell wall, that’s made of the carbohydrate cellulose.
The next sections explain the structure of the plasma membrane in detail and
describe how materials move through it in order to keep the cell healthy and
allow it to do its job.

Deciphering the fluid-mosaic model
Plasma membranes are made of several different components, much like a
mosaic work of art. Because membranes are a mosaic, and because they’re
flexible and fluid, scientists call the description of membrane structure the
fluid-mosaic model. We’ve drawn the model for you in Figure 4-5 to help you
visualize all the parts that make up a plasma membrane.
Moving from the left of Figure 4-5 to the right, notice the phospholipid
bilayer. This serves as the foundation of the plasma membrane. Phospholipids
are a special kind of lipid (see Chapter 3 for more on lipids); they have waterattracting and water-repelling parts. At body temperature, phospholipids
have the consistency of thick vegetable oil, which allows plasma membranes
to be flexible and fluid. Each phospholipid molecule has a hydrophilic head
that’s attracted to water and a hydrophobic tail that repels water. (Hydro

53

54

Part I: Biology Basics
means “water,” phile means “love,” and phobia means “fear,” so hydrophilic
literally means “water-loving” and hydrophobic literally means “water-fearing.”)

Figure 4-5:

Hydrophobic tail

In each cell, the hydrophilic heads point toward the watery environments
outside and inside the cell, sandwiching the hydrophobic tails between them
to form the phospholipid bilayer (see Figure 4-5). Because cells reside in a
watery solution (the extracellular matrix), and because they contain a watery
solution inside of them (cytoplasm), the plasma membrane forms a sphere
around each cell so that the water-attracting heads are in contact with the
fluid, and the water-repelling tails are protected on the inside.
In addition to phospholipids, proteins are a major component of plasma
membranes. The proteins are embedded in the phospholipid bilayer, but
they can drift in the membrane like ships sailing through an oily ocean.
Cholesterol and carbohydrates are minor components of plasma membranes,
but they play fairly significant roles.
✓ Cholesterol makes the membrane more stable and prevents it from
solidifying when your body temperature is low. (It keeps you from literally freezing when you’re “freezing.”)
✓ Carbohydrate chains attach to the outer surface of the plasma membrane on each cell. When carbohydrates attach to the phospholipids,
they form glycolipids (and when they attach to the proteins, they form
glycoproteins). Your DNA determines which specific carbohydrates
attach to your cells, affecting characteristics such as your blood type.

Chapter 4: The Living Cell
Transporting materials through the plasma membrane
Cells are busy places. They manufacture materials that need to be shipped
out, and they need to take up materials such as food and signals. These
important exchanges take place at the plasma membrane.
Whether or not a molecule can cross a plasma membrane depends upon its
structure and the cell. Small, hydrophobic molecules such as oxygen and
carbon dioxide are compatible with the hydrophobic tails of the phosopholipid bilayer, so they can easily scoot across membranes. Hydrophilic molecules such as ions can’t get through the tails by themselves, so they need
help to cross. Larger molecules (think food and hormones) also need help,
which comes in the form of transport proteins.
Some of these proteins help form openings called channels in the membrane.
Small molecules such as hormones and ions may be allowed to pass through
these channel proteins. Other proteins, called carrier proteins, pick up molecules on one side of a membrane and then drop them off on the other side.
Other proteins in the membrane act as receptors that detect the presence of
molecules the cell needs. When these molecules bind to receptors, the cell
allows the molecules to cross the plasma membrane with the help of transport proteins.
Because the plasma membrane is choosy about what substances can pass
through it, it’s said to be selectively permeable. (Permeability describes
the ease with which substances can pass through a border, such as a cell
membrane. Permeable means that most substances can easily pass through.
Impermeable means substances can’t pass through. Selectively permeable and
semipermeable mean that only certain substances are able to pass through.)
Materials can pass through the plasma membrane either passively or
actively, as you discover in the following sections.

Passively moving along
Passive transport requires no energy on the part of the cell. Molecules can
move passively across membranes in one of two ways. In both cases, the molecules are moving from where they’re more concentrated to where they’re
less concentrated. (In other words, they spread themselves out randomly until
they’re evenly distributed.) Here are the two methods of passive transport:
✓ Diffusion: The movement of molecules other than water from an area
where they’re highly concentrated to an area where they’re less concentrated is diffusion. To go from a high concentration to a low concentration, the molecules need only diffuse (spread themselves) across the
membrane, separating the areas of concentration.
✓ Osmosis: The diffusion of water across a membrane is osmosis. It works
the same way as diffusion, but it can be a little confusing because the
movement of water is affected by the concentration of substances called

55

56

Part I: Biology Basics
solutes that are dissolved in the water. Basically, water moves from
areas where it’s more concentrated (more pure) to areas where it’s less
concentrated (where it has more solutes).
Try thinking about osmosis in terms of the solutes: Water moves toward
the area with the greatest concentration of solutes. For example, the
blood in your body contains a certain amount of salt. If the concentration of salt in your blood suddenly rises, water moves out of the blood
cells, and your blood cells shrivel up. On the other hand, if too much
fluid is in the bloodstream, the blood cells have too many molecules
of salt in comparison, so they take in water. If they need to take in too
much water to bring everything back into balance, they can swell and
burst.
The relative concentration of solutes on either side of a membrane is compared in terms of the tonicity of the solutions. If a solution is isotonic, the concentrations of the substances (solutes) and water (solvent) on both sides of
the membrane are equal. If one solution is hypotonic, it has a lower concentration of substances (and more water) in it when compared to another solution.
If a solution is hypertonic, it has a higher concentration of substances in it (and
less water) when compared to another solution.

Actively helping molecules across
Active transport requires some energy from the cell to move molecules that
can’t cross the phospholipid bilayer on their own from where they’re less
concentrated to where they’re more concentrated. Carrier proteins, called
active transport proteins or pumps, use energy stored in the cell to concentrate molecules inside or outside of the cell.
Active transport is a little like having to pay to take the Staten Island Ferry.
The ferry is the carrier protein, and you’re the big molecule that needs
help getting from the bloodstream (New York Bay) to the inside of the cell
(New York City). The fee that you pay is equivalent to the energy molecules
expended by the cell.

Diffusion at work in your lungs
In the human body, one place that diffusion
occurs is in the lungs. You breathe in air, and
oxygen gets into the tiniest air sacs of the lungs,
called the alveoli. Surrounding the alveoli are
the tiniest blood vessels — the pulmonary capillaries. The pulmonary capillaries contain the
lowest concentration of oxygen in the body
because by the time blood gets to them, most

of the oxygen has been used up by other organs
and tissues. This means the alveoli have a
higher concentration of oxygen than the pulmonary capillaries. Oxygen from the alveoli of the
lungs diffuses across the membrane between
the air sac and the capillary, getting into the
bloodstream so it can travel around the body.

Chapter 4: The Living Cell

Supporting the cell: The cytoskeleton
Much like your skeleton reinforces the structure of your body, the cytoskeleton of a cell reinforces that cell’s structure. However, it provides that reinforcement in the form of protein cables rather than bones. The proteins of
the cytoskeleton reinforce the plasma membrane and the nuclear envelope
(covered in the next section). They also run through the cell like railroad
tracks, helping vesicles and organelles circulate around the cell.
Think of the cytoskeleton as a cell’s scaffolding and railroad tracks because it
reinforces the cell and allows things to move around within it.
Some cells have whiplike projections that help them swim or move fluids. If
the projections are short, like those shown in Figure 4-4, the structures are
called cilia. If the projections are long, they’re called flagella. Both cilia and
flagella contain cytoskeletal proteins. The proteins flex back and forth, making
the cilia and flagella beat like little whips. Cells with cilia exist in your respiratory tract, where they wiggle their cilia to move mucus so you can cough
it out; they’re also found in your digestive tract, where they help move food
along. Flagella are present on human sperm cells; they’re what allow sperm to
swim rapidly toward an egg during sexual reproduction.

Controlling the show: The nucleus
Every cell of every living thing contains genetic material called DNA (which
is short for deoxyribonucleic acid, as explained in Chapter 3). In eukaryotic
cells, DNA is contained within a chamber called a nucleus that’s separated
from the cytoplasm by a membrane called the nuclear envelope (also known
as the nuclear membrane). In the nucleus of cells that aren’t multiplying, the
DNA is wound around proteins and loosely spread out in the nucleus. When
DNA is in this form, it’s called chromatin. However, right before a cell divides,
the chromatin coils up tightly into chromosomes. Human cells have 46 chromosomes, each one of which is a separate piece of DNA.
DNA contains the instructions for building molecules, mostly proteins, that do
the work of the cell. Cell function depends upon the action of these proteins,
and organism function depends on cell function. So, ultimately, organism function depends upon the instructions in the DNA.
Consider the nucleus the library of the cell because it holds lots of information. The chromosomes are the library’s books, full of instructions for building
cells.
Proteins in the nucleus copy the instructions from the DNA into molecules
that get shipped out to the cytoplasm, where they direct the behavior of the
cell. For example, each nucleus has a round mass inside it called a nucleolus.

57

58

Part I: Biology Basics
The nucleolus produces ribosomes, which move out to the cytoplasm to
help make proteins. In experiments where scientists transplant the nucleus
from one cell into the cytoplasm of another cell, the cell behaves according
to the instructions in the nucleus. So, the nucleus is the true control center
of the cell.

Creating proteins: Ribosomes
Ribosomes are small structures found in the cytoplasm of cells. The instructions for proteins are copied from the DNA into a new molecule called
messenger RNA (mRNA). The mRNA leaves the nucleus and carries the
instructions to the ribosomes out in the cytoplasm of the cell. The ribosomes
then organize the mRNA and other molecules that are needed to build
proteins (for the full scoop on how proteins are made, flip to Chapter 8).
Thinking of ribosomes like workbenches where proteins are built is a good
way to remember their function.

Serving as the cell’s factory:
The endoplasmic reticulum
The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is a series of canals that connects the nucleus
to the cytoplasm of the cell. (Endo means “inside,” and reticulum refers to the
netlike appearance of the ER, so endoplasmic reticulum basically means “a
netlike shape inside the cytoplasm.”) As you can see in Figure 4-4, part of the
ER is covered in dots, which are actually ribosomes that attach to it during
the synthesis of certain proteins. This part is called the rough ER, or RER. The
part of the ER without ribosomes is called the smooth ER (SER).
Ribosomes on the RER make proteins that either get shipped out of the
cell or become part of the membrane. (Proteins that stay in the cell are put
together on ribosomes that float free in the cytoplasm.) The SER is involved
in the metabolism of lipids (fats). Proteins and lipids made at the ER get packaged up into little spheres of membrane called transport vesicles that carry
the molecules from the ER to the nearby Golgi apparatus.
To help you remember the ER’s purpose, think of the ER as the cell’s internal
manufacturing plant because it produces proteins and lipids and then ships
them out (to the Golgi apparatus).

Chapter 4: The Living Cell

Preparing products for distribution:
The Golgi apparatus
The Golgi apparatus, which is located very close to the ER (as you can see
in Figure 4-4), looks like a maze with water droplets splashing off of it. The
“water droplets” are transport vesicles bringing material from the ER to the
Golgi apparatus.
Inside the Golgi apparatus, products produced by the cell, such as hormones
or enzymes, are chemically tagged and packaged for export either to other
organelles or to the outside of the cell. After the Golgi apparatus has processed the molecules, it packages them back up into a vesicle and ships them
out again. If the molecules are to be shipped out of the cell, the vesicle finds
its way to the plasma membrane, where certain proteins allow a channel to
be produced so that the products inside the vesicle can be secreted to the
outside of the cell. Once outside the cell, the materials can enter the bloodstream and be transported through the body to where they’re needed.
If it helps you remember, you can consider the Golgi apparatus the cell’s post
office because it receives molecular packages and tags them for shipping to
their proper destination.

Cleaning up the trash: Lysosomes
Lysosomes are special vesicles formed by the Golgi apparatus to clean up the cell.
Lysosomes contain digestive enzymes, which are used to break down products
that may be harmful to the cell and “spit” them back out into the extracellular
fluid. (We fill you in on enzymes in the later “Presenting Enzymes, the JumpStarters” section.) Lysosomes also remove dead organelles by surrounding them,
breaking down their proteins, and releasing them to construct a new organelle.
Essentially, lysosomes are the waste collectors of the cell; they gather materials
the cell no longer needs and break them down so some parts can be recycled.

Destroying toxins: Peroxisomes
Peroxisomes are little sacs of enzymes that break down many different types
of molecules and help protect the cell from toxic products. Peroxisomes help
in the breakdown of lipids, making their energy available to the cell.

59

60

Part I: Biology Basics
Some of the reactions that occur in peroxisomes produce hydrogen peroxide,
which is a dangerous molecule to cells. Peroxisomes prevent your cells from
being damaged by hydrogen peroxide by converting the hydrogen peroxide
into plain old water plus an extra oxygen molecule, both of which are always
needed by the body and can be used in any cell.
Peroxisomes are a little bit like food processors. They’re involved in breaking things down, just like the blades of a food processor are used to chop up
larger pieces of food.

Providing energy, ATP-style: Mitochondria
Mitochondria supply cells with the energy they need to move and grow by
breaking down food molecules, extracting their energy, and transferring it to
an energy-storing molecule that cells can easily use. That energy-storing molecule is ATP, short for adenosine triphosphate.
Recall the role of mitochondria by thinking of them as the power plants of the
cell because they produce the energy the cell needs.
The process mitochondria use to transfer the energy in foods to ATP is called
cellular respiration. What occurs during cellular respiration is like what occurs
when a campfire burns, just on a much smaller scale. In a campfire, wood
burns, consuming oxygen and transferring energy (heat and light) and matter
(carbon dioxide and water) to the environment. In a mitochondrion, food
molecules break down, consuming oxygen and transferring energy to cells (to
be stored in ATP) and the environment (as heat). For more details on cellular
respiration, see Chapter 5.

Converting energy: Chloroplasts
Chloroplasts are organelles found solely in plants and algae. They specialize
in transferring energy from the Sun into the chemical energy in food. They
often have a distinctly green color because they contain chlorophyll, a green
pigment that can absorb sunlight. During photosynthesis, the energy from
sunlight is used to combine the atoms from carbon dioxide and water to produce sugars, from which all types of food molecules can be made. (Turn to
Chapter 5 for more on photosynthesis.)
Consider chloroplasts the plant equivalent of solar-powered kitchens because
they use energy from the Sun and “ingredients” from the environment (carbon
dioxide and water) to make food.

Chapter 4: The Living Cell
A very common misconception is that plants have chloroplasts rather than
mitochondria. The truth is, plants have both! Think about it — it wouldn’t
do plants much good to make food if they couldn’t also break it down. When
plants make food, they store matter and energy for later. When they need the
matter and energy, they use their mitochondria to break the food down into
usable energy.

Presenting Enzymes, the Jump-Starters
Chemical reactions occur whenever the molecules in cells change. They’re
usually part of a cycle or pathway that has separate reactions at each step.
Of course, because the pace of life in cells is so fast, cells can’t just wait
around for chemical reactions to happen — they have to make them happen
quickly. Fortunately, they have the perfect tool at their disposal in the form
of proteins called enzymes.
Each reaction of a pathway or cycle requires a specific enzyme to act as a
catalyst, something that speeds up the rate of chemical reactions. These proteins are folded in just the right way to do a specific job. Enzymes also have
pockets, called active sites, that they use to attach to certain molecules. The
molecule an enzyme binds to is called its substrate (see Figure 4-6).

62

Part I: Biology Basics
Without the specific enzyme necessary to catalyze a particular reaction, the
cycle or pathway can’t be completed. The result of an uncompleted cycle or
pathway is the lack of what that cycle or pathway is supposed to produce
(a product). Without a needed product, a function can’t be performed, which
negatively affects the organism. For example, if people don’t get enough
vitamin C, the enzymes needed to make collagen can’t function, resulting in
a disease called scurvy. The lack of collagen in people with scurvy causes
bleeding gums, loss of teeth, and abnormal bone development in children.
The sections that follow introduce you to how enzymes work, what they need
to get the job done, and how cells are able to keep them under control.

Staying the same . . .
Enzymes themselves are recycled. They’re the same at the end of a reaction as
they were at the beginning, and they can do their job again. For example, the
first enzymatic reaction discovered was the one that breaks down urea into
products that can be excreted from the body. The enzyme urease catalyzes
the reaction between the reactants urea and water, yielding the products
carbon dioxide and ammonia, which can be excreted easily by the body.
Urease
Urea + Water ↔ Carbon dioxide + Ammonia
In this reaction, the enzyme urease helps the reactants (molecules that enter
a chemical reaction), urea and water, combine with each other. The bonds
between the atoms in urea and water break and then reform between different combinations of atoms, forming the products carbon dioxide and ammonia. When the reaction is over, urease is unchanged and can catalyze another
reaction between urea and water.
If you find yourself struggling to figure out which proteins are enzymes and
which enzymes do what, here’s a helpful hint: The names of enzymes end with
-ase and usually have something to do with their function. For example, lipase
is an enzyme that helps break down lipids (fats), and lactase is an enzyme that
helps break down lactose.

. . . while lowering activation energy
Enzymes work by reducing the amount of activation energy needed to start a
reaction so reactions can occur more easily. On their own, reactants could
occasionally collide with each other the right way to start a reaction. But

Chapter 4: The Living Cell
they wouldn’t do it nearly often enough to keep up with the fast pace of life
in a cell. Without enzymes, your body wouldn’t be able to, say, clear urea out
of your body fast enough, leading to a toxic buildup of urea. That’s where the
enzyme urease comes into play. It binds the reactants in its active site and
brings them together in a way that requires less energy for them to react.
Because reactions can occur more easily with enzymes, they occur more
often. This increases the overall rate of the reaction in the body. One way to
understand how enzymes speed up reactions is to think about reactions in
terms of energy. In order for a reaction to occur, the reactants must collide
with enough energy to get the reaction going. In the urea and water example,
the reactants would need to collide with each other in just the right way for
them to exchange partners and form into carbon dioxide and ammonia.
Whatever you do, don’t fall for the idea that enzymes add energy to reactions
to make them happen. They don’t. In fact, they don’t add anything to a reaction; they just help the reactants get together in the right way, lowering the
“barrier” to the reaction. In other words, enzymes don’t add energy; they just
make it so the reactants have enough energy on their own.

Getting some help from cofactors
and coenzymes
Enzymes are proteins, but many need a nonprotein partner in order to do
their job. Inorganic partners, such as iron, potassium, magnesium, and zinc
ions, are called cofactors. Organic partners are called coenzymes; they’re
small molecules that can separate from the protein component of the enzyme
and participate directly in the chemical reaction. Examples of coenzymes
include many derivatives of vitamins. An important function of coenzymes
is that they transfer electrons, atoms, or molecules from one enzyme to
another.

Controlling enzymes through
feedback inhibition
Cells manage their activity by controlling their enzymes via feedback inhibition, a process in which a reaction pathway proceeds normally until the final
product is produced at too high of a level. The final product then binds to the
allosteric site of one of the initial enzymes in the pathway, shutting it down.
(An allosteric site is literally an “other shape” site. When molecules bind to
these “other” pockets, enzymes can be shut down.) By controlling enzymes,

63

64

Part I: Biology Basics
cells regulate their chemical reactions and, ultimately, the physiology of the
entire organism.
Feedback inhibition gets its name because it uses a feedback loop. The quantity of the final product provides feedback to the beginning of the pathway.
If the cell has plenty of the final product, then the cell can stop running the
pathway.
By inhibiting the activity of an initial enzyme, the entire pathway is stopped.
The process of feedback inhibition prevents cells not only from having to
use energy creating excess products but also from having to make room to
store the excess products. It’s like keeping yourself from spending money on
a huge quantity of food that you won’t eat and would just end up storing until
it rots.
Feedback inhibition is reversible because the binding of the final product to
the enzyme isn’t permanent. In fact, the final product is constantly binding,
letting go, and then binding again. When the cell uses up its stores of the final
product, the enzyme’s allosteric site is empty, and the enzyme becomes active
again.

ust like you need to put gas in your car’s engine so your car can move,
you need to put food in your body so it can function. And you’re not
alone. Every person, as well as every other living thing, needs to “fill its tank”
with matter and energy in the form of food. Food molecules are used to build
the molecules that make up cells and are broken down to release energy to
cells so they can grow and maintain themselves. Animals obtain their food by
eating plants and other animals, whereas plants make their own food. In this
chapter, we present some facts about the various types of energy and how
they’re transferred. We also demonstrate why cells need energy and take a
look at how cells obtain and then store energy and matter.

What’s Energy Got to Do with It?
Whether you realize it or not, you use energy every day to cook your food,
brighten your home, and run your appliances. Chances are, however, if
you were asked to state what energy is, you might have some trouble. Most
people have an idea of energy as something you need to do things, but they
don’t really know what energy is. The funny thing is that physicists, who
spend a lot of time studying energy, define energy in exactly the way most
people think about it: Energy is something that allows work to be done.

66

Part I: Biology Basics
You can probably think of many kinds of energy in your life — electricity,
heat, light, chemical (like gasoline). Although they may seem very different,
the kinds of energy you can think of represent the two main types of energy:
✓ Potential energy: This is the energy that’s stored in something because
of the way it’s arranged or structured. Energy in a battery, water behind
a dam, and a stretched rubber band that’s about to be released are all
examples of potential energy. Food and gasoline also contain potential
energy called chemical potential energy (energy that’s stored in the
bonds of molecules).
✓ Kinetic energy: This is the energy of motion. Light, heat, and moving
objects all contain kinetic energy.
The following sections get you acquainted with the rules surrounding energy.
They also explain how the cells of living things use and transfer energy, as
well as how they obtain it (here’s a hint: it’s all about food).

Looking at the rules regarding energy
Energy has three specific rules that are helpful to know so you can better
understand how organisms use it:
✓ Energy can’t be created or destroyed. The electricity that people get
from hydroelectric power (or coal-burning power plants, wind turbines,
or solar panels) isn’t created from nothing. It’s actually transferred from
some other kind of energy. And when people use, say, electricity, that
energy doesn’t disappear. Instead, it becomes other kinds of energy,
such as light or heat.
The idea that energy can’t be created or destroyed is known as the First
Law of Thermodynamics.
✓ Energy is transferred when it moves from one place to another. To
understand this rule, picture a flowing river that’s used as a source of
hydroelectric power. Energy from the moving river is transferred first to
a spinning turbine, then to flowing electrons in power lines, and finally
to the lights shining in customers’ homes.
✓ Energy is transformed when it changes from one form to another.
Again, think about a hydroelectric power plant. The potential energy
of the water behind the plant’s dam is transformed first into the kinetic
energy of moving water, then the kinetic energy of a spinning turbine,
and finally the kinetic energy of moving electrons.

Chapter 5: Acquiring Energy to Run the Motor

Metabolizing molecules
Organisms follow the rules of physics and chemistry, and the human body
is no exception. The First Law of Thermodynamics (explained in the preceding section) applies to your metabolism, which is all the chemical reactions
occurring in your cells at one time.
Two types of chemical reactions can occur as an organism metabolizes
molecules:
✓ Anabolic reactions: This type of reaction builds molecules. Specifically,
small molecules are combined into large molecules for repair, growth,
or storage.
✓ Catabolic reactions: This type of reaction breaks down molecules to
release their stored energy.
During chemical reactions, atoms receive new bonding partners, and energy
may be transferred. (For more on molecules, atoms, and chemical bonds, flip
to Chapter 3.)
Each type of food molecule you’re familiar with — carbohydrates, proteins,
and fats — are large molecules that can be broken down into smaller subunits.
Complex carbohydrates, also called polysaccharides, break down into simple
sugars called monosaccharides; proteins break down into amino acids; and fats
and oils break down into glycerol and fatty acids. After cells break large food
molecules down into their subunits, they can more easily reconnect the subunits and reform them into the specific molecules that they need.

Transferring energy with ATP
Cells transfer energy between anabolic and catabolic reactions by using an
energy middleman — adenosine triphosphate (or ATP for short). Energy from
catabolic reactions is transferred to ATP, which then provides energy for
anabolic reactions.
ATP has three phosphates attached to it (tri- means “three,” so triphosphate
means “three phosphates”). When ATP supplies energy to a process, one of
its phosphates gets transferred to another molecule, turning ATP into adenosine diphosphate (ADP). Cells re-create ATP by using energy from catabolic
reactions to reattach a phosphate group to ADP. Cells constantly build and
break down ATP, creating the ATP/ADP cycle shown in Figure 5-1.

Cells have large molecules that contain stored energy, but when they’re busy
doing work, they need a handy source of energy. That’s where ATP comes in.
Cells keep ATP on hand to supply energy for all the work that they do.
Think of ATP like cash in your pocket. You may have money deposited in the
bank, but that money isn’t always easy to get, which is why you keep some
cash in your pocket to quickly buy what you need. After you spend all of
your cash, you have to go back to the bank or an ATM to get more. For living
things, the energy stored in large molecules is like money in the bank. Cells
break down ATP just like you spend your cash. Then, when cells need more
ATP, they have to go back to the bank of large molecules and break some
more down.

Consuming food for matter and energy
Food molecules — in the form of proteins, carbohydrates, and fats — provide the matter and energy that every living thing needs to fuel anabolic and
catabolic reactions and create ATP (for more on matter and molecules, see
Chapter 3).
✓ Organisms need matter to build their cells so they can grow, repair
themselves, and reproduce. Imagine that you scrape your knee and
actually remove a fair amount of skin. Your body repairs the damage
by building new skin cells to cover the scraped area. Just like a person

Chapter 5: Acquiring Energy to Run the Motor
who builds a house needs wood or bricks, your body needs molecules to
build new cells (head to Chapter 4 for the full scoop on cells).
✓ Organisms need energy so they can move, build new materials, and
transport materials around their cells. These activities are all examples
of cellular work, the energy-requiring processes that occur in cells. When
you walk up stairs, the muscle cells in your legs contract, and each
contraction uses some energy. But the activities you decide to engage
in aren’t the only things that require energy. Your individual cells also
need energy to do their work.
Food is a handy package that contains two things every organism needs:
matter and energy.

Finding food versus producing your own
All organisms need food, but there’s one major difference in how they
approach this problem: Some organisms, such as plants, can make their own
food; other organisms, like you, have to eat other organisms to obtain their
food. Biologists have come up with two separate categories to highlight this
difference in how living things obtain their food:
✓ Autotrophs can make their own food. Auto means “self,” and troph
means “feed,” so autotrophs are self-feeders. Plants, algae, and green bacteria are all examples of autotrophs.
✓ Heterotrophs have to eat other organisms to get their food. Hetero
means “other,” so heterotrophs are quite literally other-feeders. Animals,
fungi, and most bacteria are examples of heterotrophs.
Although you may think that obtaining food is as easy as heading to the
supermarket, pulling up to a drive-through window, or meeting the delivery
guy at the front door, acquiring nutrients is actually a metabolic process.
More specifically, food is made through one process and broken down
through another. These processes are as follows:
✓ Photosynthesis: Only autotrophs such as plants, algae, and green bacteria engage in photosynthesis, a process that consists of using energy
from the Sun, carbon dioxide from the air, and water from the soil to
make sugars. (The carbon dioxide provides the matter plants need for
food building.) When plants remove hydrogen atoms from water to use
in the sugars, they release oxygen as waste.
✓ Cellular respiration: Both autotrophs and heterotrophs do cellular respiration, a process that uses oxygen to help break down food molecules
such as sugars. The energy stored in the bonds of the food molecules is
transferred to ATP. As the energy is transferred to the cells, the matter
from the food molecules is released as carbon dioxide and water.

69

70

Part I: Biology Basics
If you think about it, photosynthesis and cellular respiration are really the
opposites of each other. Photosynthesis consumes carbon dioxide and water,
producing food and oxygen. Cellular respiration consumes food and oxygen,
producing carbon dioxide and water. Scientists write the big picture view of
both processes as the following equations:
Photosynthesis:
6 CO2 + 6 H2O + Light Energy → C6H12O6 + 6 O2
Cellular respiration:
C6H12O6 + 6 O2 → 6 CO2 + 6 H2O + Usable Energy
Don’t fall for the idea that only heterotrophs such as animals engage in cellular respiration. Autotrophs such as plants do it too. Think of it like this:
Photosynthesis is a food-making pathway that autotrophs use to store matter
and energy for later. So, a plant doing photosynthesis is like you packing a
lunch for yourself. There wouldn’t be much point in packing the lunch if you
weren’t going to eat it later, right? The same is true for a plant. It does photosynthesis to store matter and energy. When it needs that matter and energy, it
uses cellular respiration to “unpack” its food.

Photosynthesis: Using Sunlight, Carbon
Dioxide, and Water to Make Food
Autotrophs such as plants combine matter and energy to make food in the
form of sugars. With those sugars, plus some nitrogen and minerals from
the soil, autotrophs can make all the types of molecules they need to build
their cells. The chemical formula for glucose, the most common type of sugar
found in cells, is C6H12O6. To build glucose, autotrophs need carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen atoms, plus energy to combine them into sugar.
✓ The carbon and oxygen for the sugars come from carbon dioxide in the
Earth’s atmosphere.
✓ The hydrogen for the sugars comes from water found in the soil.
✓ The energy to build the sugars comes from the Sun (but only in autotrophs that use photosynthesis).
A common misconception is that plants get the matter they need to grow from
the soil. This seems like a perfectly logical idea given that plants grow with their
roots stuck in the ground. However, some very careful scientific observations

Chapter 5: Acquiring Energy to Run the Motor
by a Belgian scientist named Jean Baptiste van Helmont showed that a tree
that gained 169 pounds in mass as it grew took only 2 ounces of dry material
from the soil (not counting water). This experiment proved that plants don’t
take lots of material from the soil. Instead, they get most of the matter they
need to grow from the carbon dioxide in the air. This idea may be more difficult to believe because air, including carbon dioxide, doesn’t seem like much
of anything, but scientists have proven that it’s correct. Plants collect a lot of
carbon dioxide molecules (CO2) and combine them with water molecules (H2O)
to build sugars such as glucose (C6H12O6). Plants get the water they need, plus
some small amounts of minerals such as nitrogen, from the soil.
Photosynthesis occurs in two main steps (Figure 5-2 depicts both in action):
✓ The light reactions of photosynthesis transform light energy into
chemical energy. The chemical energy is stored in the energy
carrier ATP.
✓ The light-independent reactions of photosynthesis produce food. ATP
from the light reactions supplies the energy needed to combine carbon
dioxide (CO2) and water (H2O) to make glucose (C6H12O6).
The next sections delve deeper into the process of photosynthesis.

Transforming energy from the
ultimate energy source
The Sun is a perfect energy source — a nuclear reactor positioned at a safe
distance from planet Earth. It contains all the energy you could ever need . . . if
only you could capture it. Well, green bacteria figured out how to do just that
more than 2.5 billion years ago, showing that photosynthetic autotrophs were
way ahead of humans on this one.
Plants, algae, and green bacteria use pigments to absorb light energy from
the Sun. You’re probably most familiar with the pigment chlorophyll, which
colors the leaves of plants green. The chloroplasts in plant cells contain
lots of chlorophyll in their membranes so they can absorb light energy (see
Chapter 4 for more on chloroplasts).
During the light reactions of photosynthesis, chloroplasts absorb light energy
from the Sun and then transform it into the chemical energy stored in ATP.
When the light energy is absorbed, it splits water molecules. The electrons
from the water molecules help with the energy transformation from light
energy to chemical energy in ATP. Plants release the oxygen from the water
molecules as waste, producing the oxygen (O2) that you breathe.

Putting matter and energy together
Plants use the energy in ATP (which is a product of the light reactions) to combine carbon dioxide molecules and water molecules to create glucose during the
light-independent reactions. To make glucose, plants first take carbon dioxide
out of the air through a process called carbon fixation (taking carbon dioxide and
attaching it to a molecule inside the cell). They then use the energy from the ATP
and the electrons that came from water to convert the carbon dioxide to sugar.
The light-independent reactions form a metabolic cycle that’s known as the
Calvin-Benson cycle (named after the scientists who discovered it).
As their name indicates, the light-independent reactions of photosynthesis don’t
need direct sunlight to occur. However, plants need the products of the light
reactions to run the light-independent reactions, so really, the light-independent
reactions can’t happen if the light reactions can’t happen.
When plants have made more glucose than they need, they store their excess
matter and energy by combining glucose molecules into larger carbohydrate molecules, such as starch. When necessary, plants can break down
the starch molecules to retrieve glucose for energy or to create other compounds, such as proteins and nucleic acids (with added nitrogen taken from
the soil) or fats (many plants, such as olives, corn, peanuts, and avocados,
store matter and energy in oils).

Chapter 5: Acquiring Energy to Run the Motor

Cellular Respiration: Using Oxygen
to Break Down Food for Energy
Autotrophs and heterotrophs do cellular respiration to break down food to
transfer the energy from food to ATP. The cells of animals, plants, and many
bacteria use oxygen to help with the energy transfer during cellular respiration; in these cells, the type of cellular respiration that occurs is aerobic respiration (aerobic means “with air”).
Three separate pathways combine to form the process of cellular respiration
(you can see them all in action in Figure 5-3). The first two, glycolysis and the
Krebs cycle, break down food molecules. The third pathway, oxidative phosphorylation, transfers the energy from the food molecules to ATP. Here are
the basics of how cellular respiration works:
✓ During glycolysis, which occurs in the cytoplasm of the cell, cells break
glucose down into pyruvate, a three-carbon compound. After glycolysis,
pyruvate is broken down into a two-carbon molecule called acetyl-coA.
✓ After pyruvate is converted to acetyl-coA, cells use the Krebs cycle
(which occurs in the matrix of the mitochondrion) to break down acetylcoA into carbon dioxide.
✓ During oxidative phosphorylation, which occurs in the inner membrane
or cristae of the mitochondrion), cells transfer energy from the breakdown of food to ATP.

74

Part I: Biology Basics
Cellular respiration is different from plain ol’ respiration. Respiration, which
is more commonly referred to as breathing, is the physical act of inhaling
and exhaling. Cellular respiration is what happens inside cells when they use
oxygen to transfer energy from food to ATP.

Breaking down food
After the large molecules in food are broken down into their smaller subunits,
the small molecules can be further broken down to transfer their energy to
ATP. During cellular respiration, enzymes slowly rearrange the atoms in food
molecules. Each rearrangement produces a new molecule in the pathway and
can also produce other useful molecules for the cell. Some reactions
✓ Release energy that can be transferred to ATP: Cells quickly use this
ATP for cellular work, such as building new molecules.
✓ Oxidize food molecules and transfer electrons and energy to coenzymes: Oxidation is the process that removes electrons from molecules;
reduction is the process that gives electrons to molecules. During cellular respiration, enzymes remove electrons from food molecules and
then transfer the electrons to the coenzymes nicotinamide adenine
dinucleotide (NAD+) and flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD). NAD+ and
FAD receive the electrons as part of hydrogen (H) atoms, which change
them to their reduced forms, NADH and FADH2. Next, NADH and FADH2
donate the electrons to the process of oxidative phosphorylation, which
transfers energy to ATP.
NAD+ and FAD act like electron shuttle buses for the cell. The empty
buses, NAD+ and FAD, drive up to oxidation reactions and collect electron passengers. When the electrons get on the bus, the driver puts up
the H sign to show that the bus is full. Then the full buses, NADH and
FADH2, drive over to reactions that need electrons and let the passengers off. The buses are now empty again, so they drive back to another
oxidation reaction to collect new passengers. During cellular respiration,
the electron shuttle buses drive a loop between the reactions of glycolysis and the Krebs cycle (where they pick up passengers) to the electron
transport chain (where they drop off passengers).
✓ Release carbon dioxide (CO2): Cells return CO2 to the environment as
waste, which is great for the autotrophs that require CO2 to produce the
food that heterotrophs eat. (See how it’s all connected?)
Different kinds of food molecules enter cellular respiration at different points
in the pathway. Cells break down simple sugars, such as glucose, in the first
pathway — glycolysis. Cells use the second pathway, the Krebs cycle, for
breaking down fatty acids and amino acids.

Chapter 5: Acquiring Energy to Run the Motor
Following is a summary of how different molecules break down in the first
two pathways of cellular respiration:
✓ During glycolysis, glucose breaks down into two molecules of pyruvate.
The backbone of glucose has six carbon atoms, whereas the backbone
of pyruvate has three carbon atoms. During glycolysis, energy transfers
result in a net gain of two ATP and two molecules of the reduced form of
the coenzyme NADH.
✓ Pyruvate is converted to acetyl-coA, which has two carbon atoms in
its backbone. One carbon atom from pyruvate is released from the cell
as CO2. For every glucose molecule broken down by glycolysis and the
Krebs cycle, six CO2 molecules leave the cell as waste. (The conversion
of pyruvate to acetyl-coA produces two molecules of carbon dioxide,
and the Krebs cycle produces four.)
✓ During the Krebs cycle, acetyl-coA breaks down into carbon dioxide (CO2).
The conversion of pyruvate to acetyl-coA produces two molecules of
NADH. Energy transfers during the Krebs cycle produce an additional six
molecules of NADH, two molecules of FADH2, and two molecules of ATP.

Transferring energy to ATP
In the inner membranes of the mitochondria in your cells, hundreds of little
cellular machines are busily working to transfer energy from food molecules
to ATP. The cellular machines are called electron transport chains, and they’re
made of a team of proteins that sits in the membranes transferring energy
and electrons throughout the machines.
The coenzymes NADH and FADH2 carry energy and electrons from glycolysis
and the Krebs cycle to the electron transport chain. The coenzymes transfer
the electrons to the proteins of the electron transport chain, which pass the
electrons down the chain. Oxygen collects the electrons at the end of the
chain. (If you didn’t have oxygen around at the end of the chain to collect the
electrons, no energy transfer could occur.) When oxygen accepts the electrons, it also picks up protons (H+) and becomes water (H2O).
The proteins of the electron transport chain are like a bucket brigade that
works by one person dumping a bucket full of water into the next person’s
bucket. The buckets are the proteins, or electron carriers, and the water
inside the buckets represents the electrons. The electrons get passed from
protein to protein until they reach the end of the chain.
While electrons are transferred along the electron transport chain, the proteins use energy to move protons (H+) across the inner membranes of the

75

76

Part I: Biology Basics
mitochondria. They pile the protons up like water behind the “dam” of the
inner membranes. These protons then flow back across the mitochondria’s
membranes through a protein called ATP synthase that transforms the kinetic
energy from the moving protons into chemical energy in ATP by capturing
the energy in chemical bonds as it adds phosphate molecules to ADP.
The entire process of how ATP is made at the electron transport chain is
called the chemiosmotic theory of oxidative phosphorylation and is illustrated
in Figure 5-4.
At the end of the entire process of cellular respiration, the energy transferred
from glucose is stored in 36 to 38 molecules of ATP, which are available to be
used for cellular work. (And boy do they get used quickly!)

Energy and Your Body
Your body takes in chemical potential energy when you eat food and then
transfers the energy from that food to your cells. As you use the energy to do
work, that energy is eventually transformed into heat energy that you transfer to your surroundings.
Energy can be measured in many different ways, but the energy in food is
measured in calories. Basically, a calorie is a unit of measurement for heat
energy. It takes 1 calorie to raise the temperature of 1 gram of water by 1
degree Celsius (not Fahrenheit). The calories that you count and see written
on food packages are really kilocalories. (Kilo means “1,000,” so a kilocalorie is equal to 1,000 calories.) Kilocalories are represented by a capital C,
whereas calories are represented by a lowercase c. From here on out, we use
the term Calorie (with a capital C) to represent the kilocalories you’re familiar with from nutrition facts labels.

Chapter 5: Acquiring Energy to Run the Motor
You can get an approximate measure of your basic energy needs by performing a simple calculation to determine your basal metabolic rate (BMR),
the approximate number of Calories you need just to maintain your body’s
minimum level of activity (breathing, blood pumping, digestion, and so on).
Here’s how to calculate BMR:
1. Multiply your weight in pounds by 10.
2. Multiply your height in inches by 6.25.
3. Add these two numbers together.
4. Multiply your age by 5 and then subtract this number from the one
you got in Step 3.
5. If you’re male, add 5 to the total you found in Step 4; if you’re female,
subtract 161 from the total you found in Step 4.
If you exercise, you need to consume additional Calories to supply your body
with the energy it needs for increased physical activity. Use the preceding
calculation and Table 5-1 to figure out how many Calories you need to consume to maintain your lifestyle.

In the past, humans had to work hard to find their food and sometimes came
up empty-handed. To survive, the human body developed a mechanism for
storing energy that can be used during times of low food intake. It packs
energy-rich fat onto your hips, thighs, abdomen, and buttocks. So if you take
in more Calories in a day than you need, the extra Calories are stored as fat
in your adipose tissue. Every 3,500 extra Calories equals 1 pound of fat. And
your body doesn’t give up extra potential energy easily! If you continue to
take in more Calories than you use, you will gain weight because it’s much
easier for your body to create fat than to use it.

In this part . . .

iving things grow and reproduce both sexually
(through meiosis) and asexually (through mitosis).
They also tend to pass their traits on to their offspring.
The blueprints for these traits are encoded in the structure of the most famous molecule of life: deoxyribonucleic
acid, or DNA. Scientists today know more about the mysteries of DNA than ever before. They’ve even figured out
ways to harness its power for medicine, agriculture, and
technology.
In this part, we explain the steps of cell division and how
DNA determines the characteristics of organisms.

A

ll living things can reproduce their cells for growth, repair, and reproduction. Asexual reproduction by mitosis creates cells that are genetically identical to the parent cell. Sexual reproduction requires a special type
of cell division called meiosis that produces cells containing half the genetic
information of the parent cell. Meiosis and sexual reproduction result in
greater genetic diversity in offspring and, consequently, in the populations
of living things. In this chapter, we explore the reasons why cells divide and
present the steps of each type of cell division. We also introduce you to the
ways sexual reproduction adds variety to species of all kinds.

Reproduction: Keep On Keepin’ On
Biology is, of course, all about life. And, when you think about it, life is really
all about continuation — living things keep on keepin’ on from one generation to the next, passing on critical genetic information. Certainly this is one
of the core differences between organisms and inanimate objects. After all,
have you ever seen a chair or table replicate itself? Only living things have
the ability to pass on genetic information and replicate themselves.
When cells replicate, they make copies of all of their parts, including their
DNA, and then divide themselves to make new cells. If a cell makes an exact
copy of itself, it’s engaging in asexual reproduction. Single-celled prokaryotes,
such as bacteria, reproduce asexually by binary fission; they’re able to divide
quickly and reproduce themselves in as little as 10 to 20 minutes. Some
single-celled eukaryotes and individual cells within a multicellular eukaryote

82

Part II: Cell Reproduction and Genetics: Let’s Talk about Sex, Baby
also reproduce asexually. However, they use a process called mitosis (which
we explain in the later “Mitosis: One for you, and one for you” section) to produce new generations. If a cell produces a new cell that contains only half of
its genetic information, that cell has engaged in sexual reproduction. A special
type of cell division known as meiosis (which we explain in the later “Meiosis:
It’s all about sex, baby” section) is responsible for all sexual reproduction.
Cells divide for the following important reasons:
✓ To make copies of cells for growth: You started out as a single cell after
mom’s egg met dad’s sperm, but today you have about 10 trillion cells
in your body. All of those cells were produced from that first cell and its
descendents by mitosis. When you watch plants grow taller or baby animals grow into adults, you’re seeing mitosis at work.
✓ To make copies of cells for repair: It’s a fact of life that cells wear out
and need to be replaced. For instance, you constantly shed skin cells
from your surface. If your body couldn’t replace these cells, you’d run
out of skin. And if an organism gets injured, its body uses mitosis to produce the cells necessary to repair the injury.
✓ To carry on the species: During asexual reproduction, organisms make
exact copies of themselves for the purpose of creating offspring. During
sexual reproduction, gametes (cells, specifically eggs and sperm, containing half the genetic information of their parent cells) get together
to make new individuals. When the genetic information of the gametes
joins together, the new individual has the correct total amount of DNA.

Welcome to DNA Replication 101
If one cell is going to divide to produce two new cells, the first cell must copy
all of its parts before it can split in half. The cell grows, makes more organelles
(see Chapter 4 for the full scoop on organelles), and copies its genetic information (the DNA) so that the new cells each have a copy of everything they need.
Cells use a process called DNA replication to copy their genetic material. In this
process, the original DNA strands serve as the template for the construction of
the new strands. It’s particularly important that each new cell receives an accurate copy of the genetic information because this copy, whether it’s accurate
or faulty, directs the structure and function of the new cells.
The basic steps of DNA replication are as follows:
✓ First, the two parental DNA strands separate so that the rungs of the
double helix ladder are split apart with one nucleotide on one side and
one nucleotide on the other (see Chapter 3 for a depiction of a DNA

Chapter 6: Dividing to Conquer: Cell Division
molecule). The entire DNA strand doesn’t unzip all at once, however.
Only part of the original DNA strand opens up at one time. The partly
open/partly closed area where the replication is actively happening is
called the replication fork (this is the Y-shaped area in Figure 6-1).
✓ The enzyme DNA polymerase reads the DNA code on the parental
strands and builds new partner strands that are complementary to the
original strands. To build complementary strands, DNA polymerase follows the base-pairing rules for the DNA nucleotides: A always pairs with
T, and C always pairs with G (see Chapter 3 for further details about
nucleotides). If, for example, the parental strand has an A at a particular
location, DNA polymerase puts a T in the new strand of complementary
DNA it’s building. When DNA polymerase is done creating complementary pairs, each parental strand has a brand-new partner strand.
DNA polymerase is considered semiconservative because each new DNA
molecule is half old (the parental strand) and half new (the complementary
strand).
Several enzymes help DNA polymerase with the process of DNA replication
(you can see them and DNA polymerase hard at work in Figure 6-1):
✓ Helicase separates the original parental strands to open the DNA.
✓ Primase puts down short pieces of RNA, called primers, that are complementary to the parental DNA. DNA polymerase needs these primers in
order to get started copying the DNA.
✓ DNA polymerase I removes the RNA primers and replaces them with
DNA, so it’s slightly different from the DNA polymerase that makes most
of the new DNA (that enzyme is officially called DNA polymerase III, but
we refer to it simply as DNA polymerase).
✓ DNA ligase forms covalent bonds in the backbone of the new DNA molecules to seal up the small breaks created by the starting and stopping
of new strands.
The parental strands of the double helix are oriented to each other in opposite polarity: Chemically, the ends of each strand of DNA are different from
each other, and the two strands of the double helix are flipped upside down
relative to one another. Note in Figure 6-1 the numbers 5' and 3' (read “5
prime” and “3 prime”). These numbers indicate the chemical differences of
the two ends. You can see that the 5' end of one strand lines up with the 3'
end of the other strand. The two strands of DNA have to be flipped relative
to each other in order for the bases that make up the rungs of the ladder to
fit together the right way for hydrogen bonds to form between them. Because
the two strands have opposite polarity, they’re antiparallel strands.

Chapter 6: Dividing to Conquer: Cell Division
The antiparallel strands of the parent DNA create some problems for DNA polymerase. One quirk of DNA polymerase is that it’s a one-way enzyme — it can only
make new strands of DNA by lining up the nucleotides a certain way. But DNA
polymerase needs to use the parent DNA strands as a pattern, and they’re going
in opposite directions. As a result, DNA polymerase makes the two new strands of
DNA a bit differently from each other, as you can see from the following:
✓ One new strand of DNA, called the leading strand, grows in a continuous piece. Refer to Figure 6-1. See how the new DNA on the left side of
the replication fork is growing smoothly? The 3' end of this new strand
points toward the replication fork, so after DNA polymerase starts building the new strand, it can just keep going.
✓ One new strand of DNA, called the lagging strand, grows in fragments.
Look at Figure 6-1 again. Notice how the right side of the replication fork
looks a little messier? That’s because the replication process doesn’t
occur smoothly over here. The 3' end of this new strand points away
from the fork. DNA polymerase starts making a piece of this new strand
but has to move away from the fork to do so (because it can only work
in one direction). DNA polymerase can’t go too far from the rest of the
enzymes that are working at the fork, however, so it has to keep backing
up toward the fork and starting over. As a result, the lagging strand is
made in lots of little pieces called Okazaki fragments. After DNA polymerase is done making the fragments, the enzyme DNA ligase comes
along and forms covalent bonds between all the pieces to make one continuous new strand of complementary DNA.

Cell Division: Out with the Old,
In with the New
Cell division is the process by which new cells are formed to replace dead
ones, repair damaged tissue, or allow organisms to grow and reproduce.
Cells that can divide spend some of their time functioning and some of their
time dividing. This alternation between not dividing and dividing is known as
the cell cycle, and it has specific parts:
✓ The nondividing part of the cell cycle is called interphase. During interphase, cells are going about their regular business. If the cell is a singlecelled organism, it’s probably busy finding food and growing. If the cell

85

86

Part II: Cell Reproduction and Genetics: Let’s Talk about Sex, Baby
is part of a multicellular organism, like a human, it’s busy doing its job.
Maybe it’s a skin cell protecting you from bacteria or a fat cell storing
energy for later.
✓ Cells that receive a signal to divide enter a division process, which is
either mitosis or meiosis.
• Cells that reproduce asexually, like a skin cell that needs to replace
some of your lost skin, divide by mitosis, a process that produces
cells that are identical to the parent cell.
• Cells that reproduce sexually enter a special process called meiosis that produces special cells called gametes (in animals) and
spores (in plants, fungi, and protists) that have half the genetic
information of the parent cell. In you, the only cells that reproduce
by meiosis are cells in your gonads. Depending on your gender, your
gonads are your testes or your ovaries. Cells in testes produce gametes called sperm, and cells in ovaries produce gametes called eggs.
Mitosis and meiosis have many similarities, but the differences are essential.
We cover both processes (as well as the interphase) in the sections that follow,
but Table 6-1 can help you sort out the important differences at a glance.

Mitosis

Meiosis

The function of mitosis is asexual
reproduction in some organisms. In
many organisms, mitosis functions as a
means of growth, replacement of dead
cells, and damage repair.

Meiosis creates gametes or spores, the
first step in the reproductive process
for sexually reproducing organisms,
including plants and animals.

Interphase: Getting organized
During interphase, cells engage in the metabolic functions that make them
unique. For instance, nerve cells send signals, glandular cells secrete hormones, and muscle cells contract. If cells get a signal to reproduce themselves,
they grow, copy all of their structures and molecules, and make the structures
they need to help cell division proceed in an organized fashion (inter- means
“between,” so interphase is literally the phase between cell divisions).
The nuclear membrane is intact throughout interphase, as you can see in
Figure 6-2. The DNA is loosely spread out, and you can’t see individual chromosomes. Cells that are going to divide copy their DNA during interphase.
Interphase has three subphases:
✓ G1 phase: During this phase, which is typically the longest one of the
entire cell cycle, the cell grows and produces cell components. Each
chromosome is made up of just a single double-stranded piece of DNA
(double-stranded is just another way of saying that the DNA is a double
helix).
Some cells actually never leave the G1 phase. They never divide; instead,
they just hang out and do their cellular thing. Human nerve cells are perfect examples of cells that never leave the G1 phase.
✓ S phase: This phase is when the cell gets ready to divide and puts the
pedal to the metal for DNA replication. Every DNA molecule is copied
exactly, forming two sister chromatids (a pair of identical DNA molecules) that stay attached to each other in each replicated chromosome.
You can see replicated chromosomes in Figure 6-2, in the cell labeled
Prophase. Each replicated chromosome looks like an X, and each X represents two identical sister chromatids held together at a location on
the chromosome called the centromere.
✓ G2 phase: During this phase, the cell is packing its bags and getting
ready to hit the road for cell division by making the cytoskeletal

87

88

Part II: Cell Reproduction and Genetics: Let’s Talk about Sex, Baby
proteins it needs to move the chromosomes around. When you look at
cells that are dividing, the cytoskeletal proteins look like thin threads,
hence their name — spindle fibers. A network of spindle fibers spreads
throughout the cell during mitosis to form the mitotic spindle, which is
represented by the thin curving lines drawn in the cells in Figure 6-2. The
mitotic spindle organizes and sorts the chromosomes during mitosis.

Mitosis: One for you, and one for you
After interphase is over (see the preceding section), cells that are going to
divide to create an exact replica of a parent cell enter mitosis. During mitosis,
the cell makes final preparations for its impending split. Processes during
mitosis ensure that genetic material is distributed equally so each new
daughter cell receives identical information (eukaryotic cells are model parents intent on avoiding bickering between their daughter cells).

Chapter 6: Dividing to Conquer: Cell Division
The process of mitosis occurs in four phases, with the fourth phase initiating
a final process called cytokinesis. We outline everything for you in the following sections.

Examining the four phases of mitosis
Although the cell cycle is a continuous process, with one stage flowing into
another, scientists divide the events of mitosis into four phases based on the
major events in each stage. The four phases of mitosis are
✓ Prophase: The chromosomes of the cell get ready to be moved around
by coiling themselves up into tight little packages. (During interphase,
the DNA is spread throughout the nucleus of the cell in long thin strands
that would be pretty hard to sort out.) As the chromosomes coil up, or
condense, they become visible to the eye when viewed through a microscope. During prophase:
• The chromosomes coil up and become visible.
• The nuclear membrane breaks down.
• The mitotic spindle forms and attaches to the chromosomes.
• The nucleoli break down and become invisible.
✓ Metaphase: The chromosomes are tugged by the mitotic spindle until
they’re all lined up in the middle of the cell. (Meta- means “middle,”
so it’s officially metaphase when the chromosomes are lined up in the
middle; see the cell labeled Metaphase in Figure 6-2.)
✓ Anaphase: The replicated chromosomes separate so that the two sister
chromatids (identical halves) from each replicated chromosome go to
opposite sides (see the cell labeled Anaphase in Figure 6-2). This way
each new cell has one copy of each DNA molecule from the parent cell
when cell division is over.
✓ Telophase: The cell gets ready to divide into two by forming new
nuclear membranes around the separated sets of chromosomes. The
two daughter nuclei each have a copy of every chromosome that was in
the parent cell, as you can see in Figure 6-2.
The events of telophase are essentially the reverse of prophase.
• New nuclear membranes form around the two sets of
chromosomes.
• The chromosomes uncoil and spread throughout the nucleus.
• The mitotic spindle breaks down.
• The nucleoli reform and become visible again.

89

90

Part II: Cell Reproduction and Genetics: Let’s Talk about Sex, Baby
Seeing how daughter nuceli go their own way with cytokinesis
The last order of cell-division business is to give the new daughter nuclei their
own cells through a process called cytokinesis. (Cyto- means “cell,” and kinesis
means “movement,” so cytokinesis literally means “moving cells.”) Cytokinesis
occurs differently in animal and plant cells, as you can see from the following
list and Figure 6-3:
✓ In animal cells, cytokinesis begins with an indentation, called a cleavage
furrow, in the center of the cell. Cytoskeletal proteins act like a belt around
the cell, contracting down and squeezing the cell in two (imagine squeezing a ball of dough at the center until it becomes two balls of dough).
✓ In plant cells, a new cell wall forms at the center of the cell. Because a
rigid cell wall is involved, the cell can’t be squeezed in two. Instead, vesicles deliver wall material to the center of the cell and then fuse together
to form the cell plate. The vesicles are basically little bags made of membrane that carry the wall material, so when they fuse together, their membranes form the plasma membranes of the new cells. The wall material
gets dumped between the new membranes, forming the plant’s cell walls.
After cytokinesis is complete, the new cells move immediately into the G1
stage of interphase. No one stops to applaud the great accomplishment of
successfully completing the mitosis process, which is really too bad because
it’s the root of renewal and regeneration.

Meiosis: It’s all about sex, baby
Meiosis is unique because the resulting cells have only half of their parent
cells’ chromosomes, or singular pieces of DNA. Human body cells have 46
chromosomes, 2 each of 23 different kinds. The 23 pairs of chromosomes can
be sorted by their physical similarities and lined up to form a chromosome
map called a karyotype (see Figure 6-4). The two matched chromosomes
in each pair are called homologous chromosomes (homo- means “same,” so
these are chromosomes that have the same kind of genetic information). In
each pair of your homologous chromosomes, one chromosome came from
mom, and one came from dad. For every gene that your mom gave you, your
dad also gave you a copy, so you have two copies of every gene (with the
exception of genes on the X and Y chromosomes if you’re male).
The pairs of homologous chromosomes have the same kind of genetic information. If one of the two has a gene that affects eye color, for example, the
other chromosome has the same gene in the same location. The messages in
each gene may be slightly different — for example, one gene could have a
message for light eyes whereas the other gene could have a message for dark
eyes — but both chromosomes have the same type of gene in each location.

Human gametes (sperm cells and egg cells) have just 23 chromosomes.
Through sexual reproduction (see Figure 6-5), a sperm and an egg join
together to create a new individual, returning the chromosome number to
46. If gametes didn’t have half the genetic information, then the cell they
form together, called a zygote, would have twice the normal genetic information for a human. And when gametes are produced, they can’t just get
any 23 chromosomes — they have to get one of each pair of chromosomes.
Otherwise, the zygote would have extras of some chromosomes and be missing others entirely. The resulting person wouldn’t have the correct genetic
information and probably wouldn’t survive.

Mitosis and
development

Meiosis is the type of cell division that separates chromosomes so gametes
receive one of each type of chromosome. In humans, meiosis separates the
23 pairs of chromosomes so that each cell receives just one of each pair.
Consequently, gametes have what’s known as a haploid number of chromosomes, or a single set. When the two gametes unite, they combine their chromosomes to reach the full complement of 46 chromosomes in a normal diploid
cell (one with a double set of chromosomes, or two of each type).

Chapter 6: Dividing to Conquer: Cell Division
Two cell divisions occur in meiosis, and the two halves of meiosis are called
meiosis I and meiosis II.
✓ During meiosis I, homologous chromosomes are paired up and then separated into two daughter cells. Each daughter cell receives one of each
chromosome pair, but the chromosomes are still replicated. (Remember
that meiosis follows interphase, so DNA replication produced a copy of
each chromosome. These two copies, called sister chromatids, are held
together, forming replicated chromosomes. You can see that the chromosomes still look like X’s after meiosis I in Figure 6-6b.)
✓ During meiosis II, the replicated chromosomes send one sister chromatid from each replicated chromosome to new daughter cells. After meiosis II, the four daughter cells each have one of each chromosome pair,
and the chromosomes are no longer replicated. (Notice how the four
daughter cells in Figure 6-6b don’t have sister chromatids?)

Part II: Cell Reproduction and Genetics: Let’s Talk about Sex, Baby
In human males, meiosis takes place after puberty, when the diploid cells in
the testes undergo meiosis to become haploid. In females, the process begins
a lot earlier — in the fetal stage. While a little girl is dog-paddling around her
mother’s womb, diploid cells complete the first part of meiosis and then migrate
to the ovaries, where they hang out and wait until puberty. With the onset of
puberty, the cells take turns entering meiosis II. (Just one per month; no pushing
or shoving, please!) Usually one single egg cell is produced per cycle, although
exceptions occur, which, if fertilized, lead to fraternal twins, or triplets, or
quadruplets . . . you get the idea. The other meiotic cells simply disintegrate.
When a human sperm cell and a human egg cell — each with 23 chromosomes —
unite in the process of fertilization, the diploid condition of the cell is restored.
Further divisions by mitosis result in a complete human being.
The phases of meiosis are very similar to the phases of mitosis; they even
have the same names, which can make distinguishing between the two rather
tough. Just remember that the key difference between the phases of mitosis
and meiosis is what’s happening to the number of chromosomes.
The next sections delve into the details of each phase of meiosis I and meiosis II.

Meiosis I
Meiosis I is the first step in sexual reproduction. The phases are as follows:
✓ Prophase I: During this phase, the cell’s nuclear membrane breaks
down, the chromatids coil to form visible chromosomes, the nucleoli
break down and disappear, and the spindles form and attach to the
chromosomes. But that’s not all. Prophase I is when something that’s
absolutely critical to the successful separation of homologous chromosomes occurs: synapsis.
Synapsis happens when the two chromosomes of each pair find each
other and stick together. The synapsis process begins when the homologous chromosomes move and lie next to each other. At this point, the
two homologous chromosomes can swap equal amounts of DNA in an
event called crossing-over (see Figure 6-6a). This swapping of materials
results in four completely unique chromatids. This new arrangement of
four chromatids is called a tetrad.
Crossing-over between homologous chromosomes during prophase I
increases the genetic variability among gametes produced by the same
organism. Every time meiosis occurs, crossing-over can happen a little
differently, shuffling the genetic deck as gametes are made. This is one
of the reasons that siblings can be so different from each other.

Chapter 6: Dividing to Conquer: Cell Division
✓ Metaphase I: This is when the pairs of homologous chromosomes line
up in the center of the cell. The difference between metaphase I of meiosis and metaphase of mitosis is that the homologous pairs line up in the
former, whereas individual chromosomes line up in the latter.
✓ Anaphase I: During this phase, the two members of each homologous
pair go to opposite sides of the cell, and the chromosome number is officially reduced from diploid to haploid.
✓ Telophase I: This is when the cell takes a step back (or forward, depending on your perspective) to an interphase-like condition by reversing the
events of prophase I. Specifically, the nuclear membrane reforms, the
chromosomes uncoil and spread throughout the nucleus, the nucleoli
reform, and the spindles break down.

Meiosis II
During meiosis II, both daughter cells produced by meiosis I continue their
dance of division so that — in most cases — four gametes are the end result.
The phases of meiosis II look very similar to the phases of meiosis I with one
big exception: The cells start out with half the number of chromosomes as
the original parent cell.
Meiosis II separates the sister chromatids of each replicated chromosome and
sends them to opposite sides of the cell. Cells going from meiosis I to meiosis
II don’t go through interphase again (after all, that would undo all the hard
work of meiosis I).
✓ Prophase II: As in mitosis’s prophase and meiosis’s prophase I, the
nuclear membrane disintegrates, the nucleoli disappear, and the spindles form and attach to the chromosomes.
✓ Metaphase II: Nothing too exciting here, folks. Just as in any old metaphase, the chromosomes line up at the equatorial plane. But remember
that the number of chromosomes that lines up is half the number of the
original parent cell (and half the number you’d see in mitosis).
✓ Anaphase II: The sister chromatids of each replicated chromosome
move away from each other to opposite sides of the cell.
✓ Telophase II: The nuclear membrane and nucleoli reappear, the chromosomes stretch out for the briefest of rests, and the spindles disappear.
After meiosis II, it’s time for cytokinesis, which creates four haploid cells
(which is impressive considering you had just one diploid cell at the beginning of meiosis).

95

Part II: Cell Reproduction and Genetics: Let’s Talk about Sex, Baby

How Sexual Reproduction
Creates Genetic Variation
Sexual reproduction increases genetic variation in offspring, which in turn
increases the genetic variability in species. You can see the effects of this
genetic variability if you look at the children in a large family and note how
each person is unique. Imagine this kind of variability expanded to include
all the families you know (not to mention all the families of all the sexually
reproducing organisms on Earth), and you begin to get a feel for the dramatic
genetic impact of sexual reproduction.
The sections that follow familiarize you with some of the specific causes of
genetic variation courtesy of meiosis and sexual reproduction.

Mutations
DNA polymerase occasionally makes uncorrected mistakes when copying a cell’s genetic information during DNA replication (which we walk you
through earlier in this chapter). These mistakes are called spontaneous mutations, and they introduce changes into the genetic code. In addition, exposure
of cells to mutagens (environmental agents, such as X-rays and certain chemicals, that cause changes in DNA) can increase the number of mutations that
occur in cells. When changes occur in a cell that produces gametes, future
generations are affected. (For more on the effect of mutations, see Chapter 8.)

Crossing-over
When homologous chromosomes come together during prophase I of meiosis,
they exchange bits of DNA with each other. This crossing-over (illustrated in
Figure 6-6a) results in new gene combinations and new chances for variety.
Crossing-over is one way of explaining how a person can have red hair from his
mother’s father and a prominent chin from his mother’s mother. After crossingover, these two genes from two different people wound up together on the same
chromosome in the person’s mother and got handed down together.

Independent assortment
Independent assortment occurs when homologous chromosomes separate
during anaphase I of meiosis. When the homologous pairs of chromosomes

Chapter 6: Dividing to Conquer: Cell Division
line up in metaphase I, each pair lines up independently from the other pairs.
So, the way the pairs are oriented during meiosis in one cell is different from
the way they’re oriented in another cell. When the homologous chromosomes separate, many different combinations of homologous chromosomes
can travel together toward the same side of the cell. How many different combinations of homologous chromosomes are possible in a human cell undergoing meiosis? Oh, just 223 — that’s 8,388,608 to be exact. Now you can begin to
see why even large families can have many unique children.

Fertilization
Fertilization presents yet another opportunity for genetic diversity. Imagine
millions of genetically different sperm swimming toward an egg. Fertilization
is random, so the sperm that wins the race in one fertilization event is going
to be different than the sperm that wins the next race. And, of course, each
egg is genetically different too. So, fertilization produces random combinations of genetically diverse sperm and eggs, creating virtually unlimited
possibilities for variation. That’s why every human being who has ever
been born — and ever will be born — is genetically unique. Well, almost.
Genetically identical twins can develop from the same fertilized egg, but even
they can have subtle differences due to development.

Nondisjunction
Nothing’s perfect, even in the cellular world, which is why sometimes meiosis doesn’t occur quite right. When chromosomes don’t separate the way
they’re supposed to, that’s called nondisjunction. The point of meiosis is to
reduce the number of chromosomes from diploid to haploid, something that
normally happens when homologous chromosomes separate from each other
during anaphase I. Occasionally, however, a pair of chromosomes finds it
just too hard to separate, and both members of the pair end up in the same
gamete (see Figure 6-6c).
What happens next isn’t pretty. Two of the final four cells resulting from the
meiotic process are missing a chromosome as well as the genes that chromosome carries. This condition usually means the cells are doomed to die. Each
of the other two cells has an additional chromosome, along with the genetic
material it carries. Well, that should be great for these cells, shouldn’t it?
It should mean they’ll have an increased chance for genetic variation, and
that’s a good thing, right?
Wrong! An extra chromosome is like an extra letter from the IRS. It’s not
something to hope for. Many times these overendowed cells simply die, and

97

98

Part II: Cell Reproduction and Genetics: Let’s Talk about Sex, Baby
that’s the end of the story. But sometimes they survive and go on to become
sperm or egg cells. The real tragedy, then, is when an abnormal cell goes on
to unite with a normal cell. When that happens, the resulting zygote (and
offspring) has three of one kind of chromosome rather than the normal two.
The term scientists use for this occurrence is trisomy.
Here’s the real problem with this scenario: All the cells that develop by mitosis to create the new individual will be trisomic (meaning they’ll have that
extra chromosome). One possible abnormality occurring from an extra chromosome is Down syndrome, a condition that often results in some mental and
developmental impairment and premature aging.
Scientists have now pinpointed the chromosome related to Down syndrome;
it’s Chromosome 21. If an egg with two number 21 chromosomes is fertilized
with a normal sperm cell with just one number 21, the resulting offspring has
47 chromosomes (24 + 23 = 47), and Down syndrome occurs.
You probably already know that the mother’s age is a factor in the creation
of genetic abnormalities such as Down syndrome, but do you know why? The
answer lies in the fact that meiosis I takes place in the fetal stage for females
and then the cells rest in the ovaries until puberty, when one per month
enters meiosis II in preparation for fertilization. If a cell has been waiting its
turn for 40 or 45 years, it’s pretty darned old — in cellular terms at least.
(Aging gametes aren’t such an issue for males because their sex cells don’t
actually enter meiosis until after puberty. Meiosis is a continuous process for
them, producing new cells all the time.)

Ever wish you could’ve been born the opposite sex so you wouldn’t have to
spend so much of your budget on makeup or shave your face every morning?
Sorry, but that was never really your decision to make. Like all other genetic
characteristics, gender is determined at a chromosomal level.
In many organisms — including humans and fruit flies — the gender of an
individual is determined by specific sex chromosomes, which scientists refer
to as the X and Y chromosomes. The 23 pairs of human chromosomes can be
divided into 22 pairs of autosomes, chromosomes that aren’t involved in the
determination of gender, and one pair of sex chromosomes. Men and women
have the same types of genes on the 22 autosomes and on the X chromosome. But only guys get a special gene, located on the Y chromosome, that
jump-starts the formation of testes in boy fetuses when they’re about 6 weeks
old. After the testes form, they produce testosterone, and it’s usually all boy
from then on out. The Y chromosome is smaller than all the other chromosomes, but it packs one powerful little gene!

Chapter 6: Dividing to Conquer: Cell Division

Monocultures, a threat to genetic diversity
Up until about the 1960s, most American farms
were smaller operations that planted diverse
crops and relied fairly heavily upon human labor
to get the crops in. As farms started shifting to
more mechanized processes, they grew larger
and looked for greater standardization in crop
plants. After all, machines work best at specialized, repetitive tasks. Farms started planting
huge stands of monocultures, crop plants that
are all genetically identical. This practice worries many scientists because they recognize
the power and value of genetic diversity.
If an insect pest or fungal pathogen can successfully attack a crop plant, it has the potential to wipe out an entire monoculture at once

and drastically impact the human food supply.
In addition, large industrial farms increasingly
rely upon artificial fertilizers and pesticides to
support their specialized monocultures, which
can upset the balance between the farm and
the natural ecology.
As people start to realize that monoculture
farming may have more dangers than benefits,
some people are bucking the trend. Small farms
are trying to make a comeback by producing
diverse, organic crops, and companies are
starting to collect older varieties of crop plants,
called heirloom varieties, and reintroduce them
into the human food supply.

G

enetics is the branch of biology that looks at how parents pass traits on
to their offspring. It all started more than 150 years ago when a monk
named Gregor Mendel conducted breeding experiments with pea plants that
led him to discover the fundamental rules of inheritance. Although Mendel
worked with peas, his ideas explain a lot about why you look and function the
way you do.
In this chapter, we show you one of Mendel’s experiments and present some
of the most important rules of inheritance.

Why You’re Unique: Heritable Traits
and the Factors Affecting Them
Dogs have puppies, hens have chicks, and your parents had you. What do all
three sets of parents have in common? They all passed their traits on to their
offspring. Traits that are inherited from one generation to the next are called
heritable traits.
When living things reproduce, they make copies of their DNA and pass some
of that DNA on to the next generation. The DNA is the genetic code for the
traits of the organism (see Chapter 3 for more on DNA), which means the

102

Part II: Cell Reproduction and Genetics: Let’s Talk about Sex, Baby
characteristics of the next generation are built from the parents’ blueprints.
Of course, in sexually reproducing species, offspring aren’t exactly like their
parents for several reasons:
✓ Offspring receive half of their genetic information from their father
and half from their mother. Parents divide their genetic information in
half through the process of meiosis (described in Chapter 6), producing sperm cells and egg cells that join to form a new individual. So each
offspring brings together a potentially new combination of its parents’
traits. Plus, each sperm and egg are a little bit different from the others
due to crossing-over and independent assortment (we cover these
causes of genetic variation in greater detail in Chapter 6), which shuffle
up the genetic information as it’s packaged into the sperm and eggs. The
result is that there really is only one you — even if you have siblings,
you’re all a little bit different.
✓ Even heritable characteristics can change slightly. DNA changes
slightly every time it’s copied due to mutation (see Chapters 6 and 8 for
the full scoop on mutation). If a mutation is passed from parent to offspring, the offspring may have a new trait. For instance, Queen Victoria
of England had children and grandchildren who suffered from hemophilia, a deadly disease in which your blood doesn’t clot properly, but
none of her ancestors had the disease. One possibility for why Queen
Victoria’s children acquired the disease is that a mutation occurred in
the DNA of one of Queen Victoria’s parents, who then passed that mutation on to her. Queen Victoria didn’t have the disease, but she passed
the mutation on to several of her children. Her sons who received the
mutation suffered from the disease, and her daughters passed the mutation on to their children.
✓ Some traits are acquired rather than inherited. Riding a bicycle, speaking French, and swimming are all acquired traits, abilities you aren’t born
with but that you gain during your lifetime. Even if your parents can do
these things, you still have to figure out how to do them on your own.
For example, you aren’t born with the natural ability to swim (unless of
course you’re a fish).
✓ Some inherited traits are affected by the environment. The basic color
of, say, your skin or hair is written in the code of your DNA, but if you
spend lots of time basking in sunlight, your skin will grow darker, and
your hair will become lighter. Even something like height can be affected
by your environment — your DNA controls your basic height, but nutrition plays a big role in whether you reach your full potential.

Chapter 7: Making Mendel Proud: Understanding Genetics

“Monk”ing Around with Peas:
Mendel’s Laws of Inheritance
People have probably always realized that parents pass traits on to their children. After all, as soon as a new baby is born, people start trying to decide
who the baby looks like. Yet the first person who really figured out the fundamentals of how traits are passed down was an Austrian monk named Gregor
Mendel.
Mendel lived in the mid-19th century. During his time, people believed in
blending inheritance, meaning they thought that the traits of a father blended
with the traits of a mother to produce children whose traits were supposed
to be the averages of the parents’ traits. So a tall father and a short mother
were expected to have average-size kids. (If the concept of blending inheritance were correct, no one could ever have a child that was taller than his or
her parents.)
Mendel, who was very interested in science and math, tested these ideas
about inheritance by breeding pea plants in the abbey garden. He studied
many of the heritable traits of peas, including flower color, pea color, plant
height, and pea shape. Although other people had bred plants and animals
for desirable characteristics before, Mendel was extremely careful in his
experiments and used math to look at inheritance in a new way, revealing
patterns that no one else had noticed. We walk you through the basics of
Mendel’s experiments and the results they produced in the next sections.

Pure breeding the parentals
Mendel used pure-breeding plants (plants that always reproduce the same
characteristics in their offspring) to ensure that he knew exactly what genetic
message he was starting with when he chose a particular plant for his experiments. In other words, if he chose a tall plant, he wanted to know for sure
that the plant had genetic messages for the tall trait only.
To make pure-breeding plants for his experiments, Mendel self-pollinated
plants that had the characteristic he wanted to study, weeding out any
offspring that were different until all the offspring always had his chosen
characteristic. (Pea flowers have both male and female parts, so they can
be self-pollinated to produce offspring.) For example, Mendel self-pollinated
tall pea plants, pulling out any short offspring until he had plants that would
produce only tall offspring. He did the same thing for short pea plants, selfpollinating them until they bred purely short offspring.

103

104

Part II: Cell Reproduction and Genetics: Let’s Talk about Sex, Baby
Pure-breeding organisms that are used as the parents in a genetic cross are
called parentals, or the P1 generation.

Analyzing the F1 and F2 generations
In one of his experiments, Mendel bred tall pea plants with short pea plants.
According to the idea of blending inheritance, all the offspring should have
been average in height. However, when Mendel mated his parentals and grew
the offspring, called the F1 generation, all the offspring were tall. It almost
seemed like the short characteristic had disappeared, but when Mendel
mated tall pea plants from this new F1 generation and grew their offspring,
he saw both tall and short pea plants, indicating that the short characteristic
had merely been hidden. The second generation, called the F2 generation,
had about three times as many tall pea plants as short pea plants.
The F1 and F2 generations get their names from the word filial, which means
“something that relates to a son or daughter.” Consequently, the F1 generation
is the first generation of “sons and daughters” from the parentals, and the F2
generation is the second generation.

Reviewing Mendel’s results
The results of Mendel’s pea plant experiments were very exciting because
they didn’t follow what was expected. In other words, they revealed something new about inheritance.
From his results, Mendel proposed several ideas that laid the foundation for
the science of genetics:
✓ Traits are determined by factors that are passed from parents to offspring. Today, people call these factors genes.
✓ Each organism has two copies of the genes that control every trait.
Parents pass one copy of each gene on to their offspring. The offspring
winds up with two copies of each gene because it gets one copy from
mom and one copy from dad.
✓ Some variations of genes can hide the effects of other variations.
Variations that are hidden are recessive, whereas variations that hide
other variations are dominant. In Mendel’s cross between tall and short
pea plants, the tall characteristic hid the short characteristic; therefore
the tall gene was the dominant one.
✓ The genes that control traits don’t blend with each other, nor do they
change from one generation to the next. Mendel knew this because the
short characteristic, which had disappeared in the F1 generation, reappeared in the F2 generation.

Chapter 7: Making Mendel Proud: Understanding Genetics
Sexually reproducing organisms have two copies of every gene, but they give
only one copy of each gene to their offspring. Mendel said that this is because
the two copies of genes segregate (separate from each other) when the organisms reproduce. Scientists now call this idea Mendel’s Law of Segregation.

Diving into the Pool of Genetic
Terminology
Mendel’s fundamental ideas have stood the test of time, but geneticists have
discovered a great deal more about inheritance since Mendel’s day. As the science of genetics grew and developed, so did the language used by geneticists.
A few key genetics terms are particularly useful when talking about
inheritance:
✓ Genes: Defined as factors that control traits, each gene is a section of
nucleotides along the chain of DNA in a chromosome (refer to Chapter
4 for more about chromosomes). Some genes are thousands of nucleotides long; others are less than a hundred. Your cells have about 25,000
different genes scattered among your 46 chromosomes. Each gene is the
blueprint for a worker molecule in your cells, usually a protein. Genes
determine protein shape and function, and the actions of proteins control your traits.
For example, the darkness of your skin, hair, and eyes is determined by
how much of the brown pigment melanin is deposited there. Proteins
called enzymes help make the melanin, and other proteins help deposit
the melanin in the right locations. If your genes contain the code for proteins that do these jobs well, your coloring is darker. If your genes code
proteins that don’t make as much melanin or don’t deposit it in your
skin, hair, or eyes, your coloring is lighter.
✓ Alleles: Different forms of a gene are called alleles; they explain why
Mendel saw both tall and short pea plants. Logically, the gene that controls pea plant height has two variations, or alleles — one for tallness
and one for shortness. Plants with two alleles for tallness are tall; plants
with two alleles for shortness are short. As Mendel saw, plants that have
one of each kind of allele are also tall, indicating that the tall allele can
hide the effects of the short allele. In other words, the allele for tall is
dominant to the allele for short in pea plants.
In people, alleles for dark coloring are usually dominant to alleles for
lighter coloring. So, for a gene that controls skin color, alleles for dark
color are dominant to alleles for light color. The color of any individual
person’s skin depends on his or her unique combination of light and
dark alleles.

105

106

Part II: Cell Reproduction and Genetics: Let’s Talk about Sex, Baby
✓ Loci: These are the locations on a chromosome where genes are found.
Each gene is located at a specific place, or locus, on its chromosome.
In organisms of the same species, the same gene is found at the same
locus in every organism. In humans, for example, each gene is found on
the same chromosome in all people. The gene for blood type A, B, or O
is always found on the same locus on Chromosome 9, and the gene for
cystic fibrosis is always found on the same locus on Chromosome 7.
Many human traits aren’t controlled by just one gene. Traits such as your
height, weight, and the color of your skin, hair, and eyes result from the interaction of several genes. These traits are called polygenic traits (poly means
“many,” and genic means “genes”). Polygenic traits usually show a wide range
of variety in the population. Pea plants, for example, are either short or tall
with nothing in between, whereas adult humans range over a wide variety of
heights. This difference is because human height is polygenic and pea height
is controlled by just one gene.

Bearing Genetic Crosses
Geneticists use their own unique shorthand when analyzing the results from
a genetic cross (a mating between two organisms with characteristics that scientists want to study). They use a letter to stand for each gene, capitalizing
the letter for dominant alleles (for a definition of alleles, see the preceding
section). The same letter of the alphabet is used for each allele to show that
they’re variations of the same gene.
For the cross Mendel did between tall and short pea plants, see the earlier
“‘Monk’ing Around with Peas: Mendel’s Laws of Inheritance” section for more
on this experiment, the letter T can be used to represent the gene for plant
height. In Figure 7-1, the dominant allele for tallness is shown as T, whereas
the recessive allele for shortness is shown as t.

Chapter 7: Making Mendel Proud: Understanding Genetics
Geneticists also have special terms for describing the organisms involved in
a genetic cross. Here they are:
✓ Genotype: The combination of alleles that an organism has is its genotype. The genotypes of the two parental plants shown in Figure 7-1 are
TT and tt.
✓ Phenotype: The appearance of an organism’s traits is its phenotype. The
phenotypes of the two parental plants shown in Figure 7-1 are tall and
short.
A tool called a Punnett square helps geneticists predict what kinds of offspring might result from a particular genetic cross. In Figure 7-1, a Punnett
square shows the cross between the peas of the F1 generation. The alleles
that each parent can contribute to the offspring are written along the sides of
the square where it says Sperm and Eggs. All possible combinations of alleles
that could result from the meeting of sperm and egg are drawn within the
square.
If Mendel had used modern genetic notation and terminology, he might have
analyzed his experiment like this (look to Figure 7-1 for reference if you need it):
1. The parental pea plants are purebred, so they have only one type of
allele, but each individual plant has two alleles for each gene. The tall
parent’s alleles are shown as TT, and the short parent’s alleles are
shown as tt. Because both of their alleles are the same, the parental pea
plants are homozygous for the plant height trait (homo- means “same,”
and zygous comes from a Greek root that means “together”).
2. Each parental pea plant gives one allele to each offspring. Because the
parentals are purebred, they can give only one type of allele. Tall pea
plant parents always give a copy of the tall allele (T) to offspring, and
short parents always give a copy of the short allele (t). Copies of these
alleles are packaged into gametes (sperm and egg cells) as the pea
plants reproduce.
3. The sperm and egg of the parents combine, giving their F1 offspring two
alleles for the height gene. All the F1 offspring have one copy of each
allele, so their alleles are written as Tt. Because their alleles are different, the F1 pea plants are heterozygous for the plant height trait (heteromeans “other”). Although the F1 plants are heterozygous, they should

107

108

Part II: Cell Reproduction and Genetics: Let’s Talk about Sex, Baby
all look tall because the tall allele is dominant to the short allele. This is
exactly what Mendel saw — the short trait from his parentals seemed to
disappear in the F1 generation.
4. When F1 plants are crossed, they can each make two kinds of gametes —
those that carry a dominant allele and those that carry a recessive allele.
To figure out all the possible combinations of offspring the F1 plants could
have, you use a Punnett square like the one shown in Figure 7-1.
5. The completed Punnett square in Figure 7-1 predicts that the F2 offspring will have three different genotypes: TT, Tt, and tt. For every one
TT offspring, there should be two Tt offspring and one tt offspring. In
other words, the genotypic ratio (the ratio of expected numbers of genotypes for the cross) predicted for the F2 generation is 1:2:1 for TT:Tt:tt.
6. The tall allele is dominant to the short allele, so F2 plants that are TT or
Tt will be tall, and only F2 plants that are tt will be short. So, the Punnett
square predicts that for every three tall plants, there’ll be just one
short plant. In other words, the phenotypic ratio (the ratio of expected
numbers of phenotypes for the cross) for the F2 generation is 3:1 for
tall:short. This is precisely what Mendel saw — for every one short plant
he saw in his F2 generation, he saw about three tall ones.
When two organisms that are heterozygous for one trait are crossed with each
other, that combination is called a monohybrid cross. (Mono- means “one,” and
hybrid means “something from two different sources,” so a monohybrid is an
organism that has two different alleles for one trait.) The cross between F1
pea plants in Figure 7-1 is an example of a monohybrid cross.

Studying Genetic Traits in Humans
One of the reasons plants make good subjects for genetic studies is because
you can control their mating. From a genetics standpoint, humans aren’t
nearly so cooperative. Also, humans don’t produce as many offspring as
plants do, and human children take a very long time to grow up so you can
evaluate the appearance of traits. Consequently, when geneticists want to
study human traits, they have to rely upon families that already exist.

Chapter 7: Making Mendel Proud: Understanding Genetics
The sections that follow show you how geneticists go about studying family
trees and how they test for different inheritance scenarios. You also find out
the conclusions geneticists have made about dominant and recessive traits
in humans.

Creating pedigree charts
The first steps in understanding the inheritance of a human trait are to gather
information on which people in a family have the trait and record that information in a geneticist’s version of a family tree, which is called a pedigree
chart. The symbols in a pedigree chart (see Figure 7-2a) represent information about the family and the trait being studied.
✓ Squares indicate males; circles indicate females.
✓ A line drawn between two symbols represents marriage.
✓ A line drawn down from a marriage indicates that the marriage produced a child. Children are arranged in birth order from left to right.
✓ A filled-in symbol indicates people whose traits are being studied; an
open symbol is used for people who don’t have those traits.
✓ A diagonal line through a symbol represents someone who is deceased.
✓ Roman numerals shown to the left of each row represent the different
generations. Each person in a generation is assigned an Arabic number so
that any person in a pedigree chart can be identified by the combination
of his or her generation number and individual number. The deceased
person in Figure 7-2c, for example, is identified as Individual VI-1.
By studying a pedigree chart, geneticists can often figure out whether a trait
is caused by a dominant or recessive allele. The trait shown in Figure 7-2c, for
example, must be caused by a recessive allele. The symbol of Individual VI-1
is shaded, which means this person had the trait being studied. However, neither of this person’s parents shows the trait. The parents must have carried
the allele because children get their alleles from their parents, but the allele
wasn’t visible in either parent. When an allele is present but not seen in a person’s phenotype, the trait must be recessive.

Testing different inheritance scenarios
One pedigree chart alone doesn’t always provide enough information to
determine the inheritance pattern of a trait. In order to test whether a particular type of inheritance works for a pedigree, follow these steps:
1. Decide which type of inheritance you want to test.
Say, for example, that you want to test the hypothesis that the trait in
Figure 7-2b is caused by a dominant allele.
2. Set up your notation for the alleles.
If you’re testing to see whether the trait is dominant, then you can propose that A should represent the dominant allele and a should represent
the recessive allele.
3. Assign genotypes to people whose genotype is certain.
Because you’re suggesting that the trait is dominant, then people who
don’t show the trait must have two copies of the recessive allele. (If they
had even just one copy of the dominant allele, then you’d see the trait,
and their symbols would be shaded.) In Figure 7-2b, all the individuals
with open symbols must be homozygous recessive, or aa. Write their
genotypes under their symbols.
4. Work from the individuals whose genotypes are certain to figure out
the genotypes of the other individuals.
Use the clues of parents and other children to figure things out. For
example, Individual I-2 has the trait, which means she must have at least
one copy of the dominant allele. Right away you know that her genotype
is A– (the dash represents her second, unknown allele). To figure out her
second allele, look at her children. If she was homozygous dominant, or
AA, then she could only ever give one type of allele to her kids — the A
allele. Because you’re testing whether this trait could be dominant, then
any kid who has even just one A is going to show the trait. However, two
of I-2’s children don’t have the trait. Consequently, she must be able to
give the little a allele too, which makes her genotype Aa.
If you can’t figure out someone’s complete genotype by looking at the
genotypes of people whose information is certain, you can leave a dash
in that person’s genotype to represent the uncertain allele.
5. If you find a place in the pedigree chart where the genotypes of parents and children have a conflict, you must reject your hypothesis
about the inheritance of the trait.
For example, if you proposed that the trait in Figure 7-2c was caused by
a dominant allele, then Individual VI-1 would have to have had at least

111

112

Part II: Cell Reproduction and Genetics: Let’s Talk about Sex, Baby
one dominant allele. This is impossible because neither of VI-1’s parents
shows the trait, and one of the parents would have to carry at least one
dominant allele in order to pass that on to VI-1. Because the proposed
genotypes are impossible, you must reject the hypothesis that this trait
could be carried by a dominant allele.
The trait shown in Figure 7-2b looks like it’s caused by a dominant allele
because someone in every generation has the trait. In other words, the trait
never hides like a recessive trait does. However, from just this one pedigree
chart, you can’t be absolutely sure. If you set up a hypothesis that the trait is
recessive and test your idea using the preceding steps, you can give everyone a genotype without encountering an impossible conflict. In situations
like this one, in which more than one type of inheritance is possible based on
one pedigree chart, geneticists gather more information from other families.
In fact, sometimes they have to study many pedigrees before they can prove
the inheritance of a particular trait.

Drawing conclusions about traits
In general, dominant and recessive inheritance show two distinct patterns in
a human pedigree:
✓ Traits carried by recessive alleles often skip generations. For example,
a red-headed child may have a red-headed grandparent but blondehaired parents. Any time parents who don’t show a certain trait have
children who do show the trait, that’s proof of a recessive trait.
✓ Traits carried by dominant alleles often show up in every generation. Brown-eyed parents who have more than one child usually have
some children with brown eyes. However, people showing the dominant
brown-eyed trait may have only one copy of the dominant allele, so they
could potentially pass on recessive alleles to their children. This fact is
why two brown-eyed people can produce some blue-eyed children. In
fact, whenever two parents who show a particular trait have kids who
don’t show the trait, then you know for sure that the trait is dominant.

W

ithout deoxyribonucleic acid, or DNA for short, your cells — and
all the cells of every other living thing on Earth — wouldn’t exist.
That’s because DNA controls the structure and function of organisms, largely
because it’s essential to the production of the proteins that determine your
traits. When changes occur in the DNA of one or more cells, the effects on the
organism made up of those cells can be disastrous.
We show you just how important DNA and proteins are to your everyday life
in this chapter. Get ready to discover how DNA and RNA (ribonucleic acid)
work together to produce proteins, the types of DNA mutations that occur
and how they affect you, and more.

Proteins Make Traits Happen,
and DNA Makes the Proteins
You probably know that DNA is your genetic blueprint and that it carries the
instructions for your traits. But what you may not know is exactly how your
DNA causes you to look and function a certain way. DNA contains the instructions for the construction of the molecules that carry out the functions of
your cells. These functional molecules are mostly proteins, and the instructions for creating these proteins are found in your genes, sections of DNA
that lie along your chromosomes.

114

Part II: Cell Reproduction and Genetics: Let’s Talk about Sex, Baby
Think of your cells as little factories that have to carry out certain functions. Each function relies upon the actions of the robot workers in the factory. DNA is the instructions for the construction of each type of robot. If
the robots are built correctly according to their instructions, they work the
way they’re supposed to. Based on how the robots work, the factory accomplishes specific tasks. Your cells don’t have little robots running around, but
they do have worker molecules that carry out the functions of the cell. If one
of these molecules isn’t working correctly, your cells will work differently
than they’re supposed to, which could affect your traits.
One gene equals one blueprint for a functional molecule. Because many of
the functional molecules in your cells are proteins, genes often contain the
instructions for building the polypeptide chains that make up proteins (for
more on protein structure, head to Chapter 3). So, one gene often equals one
polypeptide chain.
Sometimes it’s hard to imagine how one little protein can affect you in an
important way. After all, humans have about 25,000 genes, so you make a
lot of different proteins. How can just one faulty protein make a difference?
Well, if your skin cells couldn’t make the protein collagen, your skin would
fall off at the slightest touch. Also, if the cells in your pancreas couldn’t make
the protein insulin, you’d have diabetes. So you see, all the functions of your
body that you probably take for granted — the way it’s built, the way it looks,
and the way it functions — are controlled by the actions of proteins.

Moving from DNA to RNA to Protein: The
Central Dogma of Molecular Biology
The instructions in DNA determine the structure and function of all living
things, which makes DNA pretty darn important. Every time a cell reproduces, it must make a copy of these instructions for the new cell. When cells
need to build a functional molecule (usually a protein), they copy the information in the genes into an RNA molecule instead of using the DNA blueprint
directly (see Chapter 3 for more about RNA molecules). Here’s an outline of
the process:
✓ Cells use transcription to copy the information in DNA into RNA
molecules.
✓ The information to build proteins is copied into a special type of RNA
called messenger RNA (mRNA), which carries the blueprint for the protein from the nucleus to the cytoplasm where it can be used to build the
protein.
✓ Cells use translation to build proteins from the information carried in
mRNA molecules.

Chapter 8: Reading the Book of Life: DNA and Proteins
The idea that information is stored in DNA, copied into RNA, and then used to
build proteins is considered the central dogma of molecular biology.
Transcription and translation are two pretty similar sounding words for two
very different processes in cells. One way to remember which process is
which is to think about the English meanings of these words. When you transcribe something, you copy it. Transcription in cells takes the information in
DNA and uses it to make RNA. DNA and RNA are similar molecules, so it’s not
like you’re really changing anything — you’re just copying the information
down. When you translate something, on the other hand, you change it from
one language to another. Translation in cells takes the information in mRNA
and uses it to build a protein, which is a different type of molecule. So, translation changes the language of molecules from RNA to protein.
The sections that follow give you an in-depth look at transcription, RNA processing, and translation.

Rewriting DNA’s message: Transcription
DNA molecules are long chains made from four different building blocks
called nucleotides that biologists represent with the letters A, T, C, and G
(flip to Chapter 3 for the scoop on DNA structure). These chemical units are
joined together in different combinations that form the instructions for cells’
functional molecules, which are mostly proteins.
When your cells need to build a particular protein, the enzyme RNA polymerase locates the gene for that protein and makes an RNA copy of it. (RNA
polymerase is shown in Step 2 of Figure 8-1.) Because RNA and DNA are similar molecules, they can attach to each other just like the two strands of the
DNA double helix do. RNA polymerase slides along the gene, matching RNA
nucleotides to the DNA nucleotides in the gene.
The base-pairing rules for matching RNA and DNA nucleotides are almost the
same as those for matching DNA with DNA (see Chapter 3). The exception is
that RNA contains nucleotides with uracil (U) rather than thymine (T). During
transcription, RNA polymerase pairs C with G, G with C, A with T, and U with
A. (Figure 8-1 gives you the visual of this. Note that the new RNA strand CUAG
pairs up with the DNA sequence GATC in the gene.)

Transcription and RNA Processing
It may seem strange that your cells copy the information in your genes into a
sort of mirror image made of RNA, but it actually makes a lot of sense. Your
genes are extremely important and need to be protected, so they’re kept safe
in the nucleus at all times. Your cells make copies of any information they
need so the original DNA doesn’t get damaged.
You can think of your chromosomes like drawers in a file cabinet. When your
cells need information from the files, they open a drawer, take out a file (the
gene), and make a copy of the information (the RNA molecule) that can travel
out into the world (the cytoplasm). The original blueprint (the DNA) is kept
safely locked away in the file cabinet.

Chapter 8: Reading the Book of Life: DNA and Proteins
Of course, RNA polymerase and DNA aren’t the only things involved in transcription. The following sections introduce you to the other players and walk
you through the process of transcription step by step.

Finding out what else is involved
RNA polymerase locates the genes it needs to copy with the help of proteins
called transcription factors. These proteins look for certain sequences in the
DNA that mark the beginnings of genes; these sequences are called promoters.
Transcription factors find the genes for the proteins the cell needs to make
and bind to the promoters so RNA polymerase can attach and copy the gene.
Many promoters contain a particular sequence called the TATA box because
it contains alternating T and A nucleotides. Transcription factors bind to the
TATA box first, followed by RNA polymerase. (Step 1 in Figure 8-1 depicts a
gene’s promoter, along with its TATA box.)
The ends of genes are marked by a special sequence called the transcription
terminator. Transcription terminators can work in different ways, but they all
stop transcription. (Step 3 of Figure 8-1 shows a transcription terminator.)

Walking through the process
As you can see from the following, the process of transcription is pretty
straightforward:
1. RNA polymerase binds to the promoter with the help of transcription
factors.
By binding to the promoter, RNA polymerase gets set up on the DNA so
it’s pointed in the right direction to copy the gene.
2. RNA polymerase separates the two strands of the DNA double helix in
a small area.
By opening the DNA, RNA polymerase can use one of the DNA strands as
its pattern for building the new RNA molecule. (The strand of DNA that’s
being used as a pattern in Figure 8-1 is labeled as the DNA template. The
new RNA strand is shown as it’s being built against the template strand.)
As RNA polymerase slides along the DNA, it opens a new area, and the
DNA behind it closes back up.
3. RNA polymerase uses base-pairing rules to build an RNA strand that’s
complementary to the DNA in the template strand.
Because the base-pairing rules are specific, the new RNA molecule contains a mirror image of the code in the DNA.

117

118

Part II: Cell Reproduction and Genetics: Let’s Talk about Sex, Baby
4. RNA polymerase reaches the termination sequence and releases
the DNA.
Some terminators have a sequence that causes the new RNA to fold up
on itself at the end, making a little bump that causes RNA polymerase to
get knocked off of the DNA.
Your cells use transcription to make several types of RNA molecules. Some of
these RNA molecules are worker molecules for the cell, others are part of cellular structures, and one type — mRNA — carries the code for proteins to the
cytoplasm.

Putting on the finishing touches:
RNA processing
After RNA polymerase transcribes one of your genes and produces a molecule of mRNA, the mRNA isn’t quite ready to be translated into a protein. In
fact, when the mRNA is hot off the presses, it’s called a pre-mRNA or primary
transcript because it’s not quite finished.
Before the pre-mRNA can be translated, it has to undergo a few finishing
touches via RNA processing (see Steps 5 and 6 in Figure 8-1):
✓ The 5' cap, a protective cap, is added to the beginning of the mRNA.
The 5' cap (shown in Step 5 of Figure 8-1) tells the cell it should translate
this piece of RNA.
✓ The poly-A tail, an extra bit of sequence, is added to the end of the
mRNA. Like its name suggests, the poly-A tail (see Step 5 of Figure 8-1) is
a chain of repeating nucleotides that contain adenine (A). It protects the
finished mRNA from being broken down by the cell.
✓ The pre-mRNA is spliced to remove introns (noncoding sequences).
One kind of weird thing about your genes (and ours too) is that the
code for proteins is interrupted by sequences called introns. Your cells
remove the introns before shipping the mRNA out to the cytoplasm (see
Step 6 in Figure 8-1). The sections of the pre-mRNA that wind up getting
translated are called exons. When your cells cut the introns out of premRNA, the exons all come together to form the blueprint for the protein.
If you get confused about what introns and exons do, just remember
that introns interrupt and exons get to exit the nucleus.

Chapter 8: Reading the Book of Life: DNA and Proteins

Converting the code to the
right language: Translation
After a mature mRNA leaves the nucleus of a cell, it heads for a ribosome in
the cell’s cytoplasm where the code it contains can be translated to produce
a protein (for more on ribosomes, see Chapter 4). As the strand of mRNA
slides through the ribosome, the code is read three nucleotides at a time.
A group of three nucleotides in mRNA is called a codon. If you take the four
kinds of nucleotides in RNA — A, G, C, and U — and make all the possible
three-letter combinations you can, you’d come up with 64 possible codons.
Each codon specifies one amino acid in the polypeptide chain of a protein.
To figure out the amino acid a singular codon represents, follow the labels
on the edges of the table in Figure 8-2. So to find out what the codon CGU
represents:
1. Look first to the left side of the table and find the row marked by the
first letter in the codon.
The letter C is the second letter down, so the amino acid represented by
the C portion of the codon CGU is found in the second row of the table.
2. Then look to the top of the table and find the column marked by the
second letter in the codon.
The letter G is the last letter in the row, so the amino acid represented
by the G part of the codon CGU is found at the intersection of the second
row (which is marked by C) and the last column under the Second Letter
heading.
3. Look to the right side of the table and find the row marked by the
third letter in the codon.
The letter U is listed first, so the amino acid represented by the U portion of the codon CGU is the first one listed in the intersection of the
second row and the last column under the Second Letter heading. Put it
all together and you find that the amino acid represented by the codon
CGU is arginine.
To translate a molecule of mRNA, begin at the start codon closest to the 5’ cap
of the mRNA, divide the message up into codons, and look the codons up in a
table of the genetic code that shows the names of the 20 different amino acids
found in the proteins of living things. For example, 5’CCGCAUGCGAAAAUGA3’
translates into methionine-arginine-lysine.

The following sections get you acquainted with specialized codons and the
anticodons all codons need to pair up with for translation to occur. They also
help you understand the overall process of translation.

Making sense of codons and anticodons
The genetic code is amazingly similar for all the organisms on Earth, from
you to E. coli. To read it, you need to know about the unique features of some
of the codons:
✓ The codon AUG is called the start codon. AUG is called the start codon
because translation begins here. When one of your cells starts translating mRNA into a polypeptide, the first AUG closest to the 5' cap of the
mRNA is the first codon to be read. AUG also represents the amino acid
methionine, so methionine is the first amino acid added to the polypeptide chain.

Chapter 8: Reading the Book of Life: DNA and Proteins
✓ The codons UAA, UAG, and UGA are called stop codons. Translation
ends when a stop codon is read in the mRNA. A stop codon only indicates when translation should end; it doesn’t represent an amino acid.
When stop codons are read in the mRNA, translation stops without
adding any new amino acids to the polypeptide chain.
✓ Some amino acids are represented by more than one codon. For
instance, arginine is represented by more than one codon; CGU, CGC,
CGA, and CGG all represent arginine. Because of this situation, biologists
say that the genetic code is redundant (more than one codon represents
some amino acids).
In order for your cells to decode mRNA, they need the help of an important
worker: transfer RNA (tRNA). Transfer RNA decodes the message in the
mRNA. Like all RNA molecules, tRNA is made of nucleotides that can pair up
with other nucleotides according to base-pairing rules.
During translation, tRNA molecules pair up with the codons in mRNA to
figure out which amino acid should be added to the chain. Each tRNA has a
special group of three nucleotides, called an anticodon, that pairs up with the
codons in mRNA. Each tRNA also carries a specific amino acid. So, the tRNA
that has the right anticodon to pair with a specific codon adds its amino acid
to the growing polypeptide chain.
Because the pairing of anticodon to codon is specific, only one tRNA can pair
up with each codon. The specific relationship between tRNA anticodons and
mRNA codons ensures that each codon always specifies a particular amino
acid.

Breaking down the translation process
Although the process of translation is fairly complicated, it’s pretty easy to
understand when you break it down into three main steps: the beginning (initiation), the middle (elongation), and the end (termination). Follow along in
Figure 8-3 as we present these three steps:
1. During initiation, the ribosome and the first tRNA attach to the mRNA
(see #1 in Figure 8-3).
The small subunit of the ribosome binds to the mRNA. Then the first
tRNA, which carries the amino acid methionine, attaches to the start
codon. The start codon is AUG, so the first tRNA has the anticodon UAC
(see #2 in Figure 8-3). After the first tRNA is bound to the mRNA, the
large subunit of the ribosome attaches to form a complete ribosome.
2. During elongation, tRNAs enter the ribosome and donate their amino
acids to the growing polypeptide chain.

121

122

Part II: Cell Reproduction and Genetics: Let’s Talk about Sex, Baby
Each tRNA enters a pocket in the ribosome called the A site (see #3 in
Figure 8-3). An adjacent pocket, called the P site, holds a tRNA with the
growing polypeptide chain (see #4 in Figure 8-3). When a tRNA is parked
in the A site and the P site, the ribosome catalyzes the formation of a peptide bond between the growing polypeptide chain and the new amino acid.
In Figure 8-3, a bond is forming between the amino acids cysteine (cys)
and proline (pro) because they’re next to each other in the ribosome.
After the new amino acid is added to the growing chain, the ribosome
slides down the mRNA, moving a new codon into the A site. After a new
codon is in the A site, another tRNA can enter the ribosome, and the
process of elongation can continue.
3. During termination, a stop codon in the A site causes translation
to end.
The ribosome slides down the mRNA until a stop codon enters the A
site. When a stop codon is in the A site, an enzyme called a release factor
enters the ribosome and cuts the polypeptide chain free. Translation
stops, and the ribosome and mRNA separate from each other.
Following translation, polypeptide chains may be modified a bit before they
fold up and become functional proteins. Often, more than one polypeptide
chain combines with another chain to form the complete protein.

Growing wild: Cancer and aging
Cancer, a disease caused by uncontrolled
cell division, occurs much more frequently as
people age, and the reality is that the longer you
live, the more likely you are to develop cancer.
Why? Because throughout your life, tiny genetic
changes may occur that you don’t even realize
are happening — a tiny mutation caused by an
X-ray here or another tiny mutation caused by
breathing in polluted air there. Some mutations
are repaired; others just exist in your body’s
cells without much notice. Each individual mutation may be harmless, but after genetic changes
accumulate over time, the chance that some
mutation will occur to change the proteins that
control cell division grows greater.
If your proteins don’t do their jobs correctly, your
cells may be thrown into an uncontrolled cycle

of dividing and growing, causing a mass of cells
called a tumor to form. As even greater numbers
of mutations accumulate in the cells over time,
their characteristics change, and the tumor may
become malignant (more likely to spread and
cause death). The spread of cancer cells around
the body occurs through metastasis, when
malignant cells leave their tissue of origin and
enter the circulatory or lymphatic systems.
People living in the United States have a 1 in 3
chance of developing cancer during their lifetimes. That statistic is alarming, but you can do
your part to reduce your risk of cancer by making
good lifestyle choices — avoiding saturated fat,
cigarettes, and obesity will all lower your cancer
risk.

Mistakes Happen: The Consequences
of Mutation
If a mistake in a strand of DNA goes undetected or unrepaired, the mistake
becomes a mutation. A mutation is a change from the original DNA strand —
in other words, the nucleotides aren’t in the order that they should be.
Mutations in DNA lead to changes in RNA, which can lead to changes in proteins. When proteins change, the functions of cells, and the traits of organisms, can also change.
Mutations usually happen as the DNA is being copied during DNA replication
(see Chapter 6 for a description of DNA replication). Two main types of mutations occur:
✓ Spontaneous mutations: These result from uncorrected mistakes by
DNA polymerase, the enzyme that copies DNA. DNA polymerase is a very
accurate enzyme, but it’s not perfect. In general, DNA polymerase makes
one mistake for every billion base pairs of DNA it copies. One in a billion
isn’t bad . . . unless you’re talking about your DNA. Then, any change
can eventually cause problems. Cancer, for example, usually occurs as
people age because they’ve lived long enough to accumulate mutations
in certain genes that control cell division.
✓ Induced mutations: These result from environmental agents that
increase the error rate of DNA polymerase. Anything that increases the
error rate of DNA polymerase is a mutagen. The most common mutagens
are certain chemicals (such as formaldehyde and compounds in cigarette smoke) and radiation (like ultraviolet light and X-rays).
When mutations occur during DNA replication, some daughter cells formed
by mitosis or meiosis inherit the genetic change (we explain how cells divide
in Chapter 6). The types of mutations these cells inherit can be divided into
three major categories:
✓ Base substitutions: When the wrong nucleotides are paired together in
the parent DNA, a base substitution occurs. If the parent DNA molecule
has a nucleotide containing thymine (T), then DNA polymerase should
bring in a nucleotide containing adenine (A) for the new strand of DNA.
However, if DNA polymerase makes a mistake and brings in a nucleotide
with guanine (G) by mistake, that’s a base substitution. Because just one
nucleotide was changed, the mutation is called a point mutation. The
effect of point mutations ranges from nothing to severe.

Chapter 8: Reading the Book of Life: DNA and Proteins
• Silent mutations have no effect on the protein or organism. Because
the genetic code is redundant, changes in DNA may lead to
changes in mRNA that don’t cause changes in the protein (see the
earlier section “Making sense of codons and anticodons” for more
on the redundancy of the genetic code).
• Missense mutations change the amino acids in the protein. Changes
in DNA can change the codons in mRNA, leading to the addition of
different amino acids into a polypeptide chain. The severity of missense mutations depends on how different the original amino acid
is from the new amino acid and where in the protein the change
occurs.
• Nonsense mutations introduce a stop codon into the mRNA, preventing the protein from being made. If the DNA changes so that a
codon in the mRNA becomes a stop codon, then the polypeptide
chain gets cut short. Nonsense mutations usually have severe
effects and are the cause of many genetic diseases, including certain forms of cystic fibrosis, Duchenne’s muscular dystrophy, and
thalassemia (an inherited form of anemia).
✓ Deletions: When DNA polymerase fails to copy all the DNA in the parent
strand, that’s a deletion. If nucleotides in the parent DNA are read but
the complementary bases aren’t inserted, the new strand of DNA is missing nucleotides. If one or two nucleotides are deleted, then the codons
in the mRNA will be skewed from their proper threes, and the resulting
polypeptide chain will be very altered. Mutations that change the way in
which the codons are read are called frameshift mutations. Deletions of
three nucleotides result in the deletion of one amino acid. Serious diseases such as cystic fibrosis and Duchenne muscular dystrophy result
from deletions.
✓ Insertions: When DNA polymerase slips and copies nucleotides in the
parent DNA more than once, an insertion occurs. Just like deletions,
insertions of one or two nucleotides can cause frameshift mutations
that greatly alter the polypeptide chain. Huntington’s disease, an illness
that causes the nervous system to degenerate starting when a person
is in his 30s or 40s, is caused by insertions of the sequence CAG into
a normal gene up to 100 times. Although the sequence is a multiple of
three (so technically not a frameshift mutation), the abundance of these
insertions messes up the reading of the normal genetic code, causing
either abnormal protein production or a lack of protein production.

125

126

Part II: Cell Reproduction and Genetics: Let’s Talk about Sex, Baby

Fighting for breath
Cystic fibrosis (CF), a disease that clogs the
lungs and smaller passageways of the body
with mucus, is the most common genetic disease found among people of northern European
ancestry (about 30,000 people are living with CF
in the United States alone). The mucus in the
lungs makes it difficult to breathe and provides a
breeding ground for bacteria, causing repeated
lung infections. People with CF don’t usually live
past young adulthood because their lungs ultimately fail from all the damaging infections. CF
patients and their families struggle against this
disease daily, using therapies to break up the
mucus and fight the infections, trying to hold
back the effects of this dreadful disease.
All of this difficulty and pain is caused by a
mutation in one protein: the CFTR protein.
Normal CFTR protein is found in the plasma
membranes of people’s cells, where it helps
move chloride across the membrane. The
movement of chloride affects the movement
of water, which is why the mucus gets so thick
on the outside of cells in people who have the

disease. The most common mutation in CFTR is
a deletion of three nucleotides, resulting in the
loss of one amino acid. That doesn’t seem like a
very big change, but the loss of that one amino
acid alters the polypeptide chain so it doesn’t
fold up properly. Other proteins, acting as
quality-control proteins, see the abnormal folding and mark the mutated protein for destruction. So, in people with the most common form
of CF, the CFTR protein never even makes it to
the plasma membrane.
Scientists are currently searching for ways to
correct this problem. One new and very exciting development is the discovery of a drug
that helps mutant CFTR proteins make it to the
plasma membrane. In lung cells grown in the
laboratory, the mutant CFTR proteins were able
to transport some chloride, suggesting that the
drug may be able to reduce the severity of the
disease. The researchers who discovered this
effect are taking their discovery to the next level
by working on appropriate doses of the drug
and testing it on people who suffer from CF.

Giving Cells Some Control:
Gene Regulation
Even though your DNA is in control of the proteins your body makes, and
those proteins are in charge of determining your traits, your cells do have
some say in life. Because each one of your cells has a complete set of your
chromosomes, your cells are able to practice gene regulation, meaning they
can choose which genes to use (or not use) and when.
When a cell uses a gene to make a functional molecule, that gene is expressed
in the cell. Gene regulation is the process cells use to choose which genes to
express at any one time. (Scientists talk about gene regulation as cells turning
genes “on” or “off.”)

Chapter 8: Reading the Book of Life: DNA and Proteins
Genes are regulated by the action of proteins that bind to DNA and either
help or block RNA polymerase from accessing the genes. In your cells, proteins that help RNA polymerase bind to your genes are called transcription
factors. They bind to special sequences on the DNA near genes’ promoters
and make it possible for RNA polymerase to bind the promoter. Transcription
and translation occur, producing the protein in the cell.
Gene regulation allows your cells to do two things: adapt to environmental
changes and make it so that each cell type has a distinct role in the body. We
fill you in on both in the next sections.

Adapting to environmental changes
The world around you is always changing, which means you need to be able
to respond to environmental signals in order to maintain your physiological
balance. Gene regulation allows you to do just that. When your cells need to
respond to environmental changes, they turn genes on or off to make the proteins needed for the response.
Suppose you’re getting too much sunlight. To protect your skin, the cells on
the tip of your nose need to darken a bit by making more of the skin pigment
melanin. The extra sunlight on your skin triggers certain proteins to bind to
the genes needed for melanin production and help RNA polymerase access
the genes. RNA polymerase reads the genes, making mRNA that contains the
blueprints for the necessary proteins. The mRNA is translated, and the proteins are made. The proteins do their jobs, and the skin on your nose turns a
darker color. This example of how your skin gets darker illustrates how cells
can access genes when they need them in order to respond to signals from
the environment.

Becoming an expert through
differentiation
You have more than 200 different types of cells in your body, including skin
cells, muscle cells, and kidney cells. Each of these cells does a different job
for your body, and like any good craftsman, each of these cell types requires
the right tools for its job. To a cell, the right tool for the job is usually a specific protein. For instance, skin cells need lots of the protein keratin, muscle
cells needs lots of contractile proteins, and kidney cells need water-transport
proteins.
Cell differentiation is the process that makes cells specialized for certain tasks.
Your differentiated cells have all the blueprints for all the tools because they
each have a full set of your chromosomes; what makes them different from
one another is which blueprint they use.

127

128

Part II: Cell Reproduction and Genetics: Let’s Talk about Sex, Baby
Cells differentiate from one another due to gene regulation. For example,
when a sperm met an egg to form the cell that would become the future you,
that first cell had the ability to divide and form all the different cell types
your body needed. As that cell and its descendents divided, however, signals
caused different groups of cells to change their gene expression. Proteins in
these cells bound to the DNA molecules, activating some genes and silencing others. As you grew and developed in your mother’s uterus, your cells
became more and more distinct from each other. Some cells became part
of your nervous tissue, whereas others formed your digestive tract. Each of
these changes occurred as cells transcribed and translated the genes for the
proteins that they needed to do their particular job.
After a cell becomes differentiated, it usually can’t go back. It’s specialized
for a certain task and can’t access the genes for proteins that aren’t in its job
description.

Stem cells: An introduction and a moral dilemma
Stem cells are cells that have the potential to
become any type of cell in the body. When they
divide, their descendants can either remain
stem cells or become differentiated into a specialized cell type. Stem cells are also unique
because they’re immortal — unlike most human
cells, which stop dividing after about 40 or 50
cell divisions, stem cells can continue to produce new cells indefinitely. They’re therefore
extremely important to the body because they
can help replace cells and repair damage in
almost every kind of tissue. They also have
the potential to cure human diseases and save
lives.
For many years the best source of stem cells for
research was human embryos made by in vitro
fertilization but no longer wanted by the people
who donated the sperm and egg. Unwanted
embryos are usually destroyed, but some
people choose to donate their frozen embryos
to scientific research. Human embryonic stem
cells are special because they’re pluripotent,
meaning they have the potential to become
every type of human cell. Although adult
stem cells can be taken from fully developed
humans, these stem cells are usually only able
to become a limited number of cell types based

on their tissue of origin. For example, hematopoietic stem cells from the bone marrow have
the ability to divide and produce many different
types of blood cells, but they typically can’t produce nerve cells.
Because human embryonic stem cells are pluripotent, they’re more valuable for some types
of research. However, some people feel that
destroying human embryos is morally wrong,
no matter how early in development they are
(embryos frozen after in vitro fertilization typically have about five to eight cells). This belief
even led to a ban on federal funding for the
development of new stem cell lines derived
from human embryos. Those who support stem
cell research argue that the potential benefits
of stem cells for treating disease and saving
lives make it imperative that scientists continue
their research with embryonic stem cells.
Will this moral dilemma ever be solved? One
potential solution is to make adult stem cells
behave as if they’re embryonic stem cells. A
group of scientists has figured out a way to
make this happen, but additional research is
needed to determine whether these induced
pluripotent stem cells are truly equivalent to
embryonic stem cells.

G

regor Mendel’s pea plant experiments in the 1850s (which we fill you
in on in Chapter 7) began a scientific exploration into the mysteries
of heredity that continues to this day. After Mendel showed that traits were
controlled by hereditary factors that pass from one generation to the next,
scientists were determined to figure out the nature of these factors and
how they were transmitted. They discovered the presence of DNA in cells,
observed the movement of chromosomes during cell division, and conducted
experiments demonstrating that DNA is in fact the hereditary material.
Almost 100 years after Mendel, James Watson and Francis Crick figured out
that DNA was a double helix and proposed how it might be copied. Scientists
deciphered the genetic code and explored how to work with it in the lab.
During the last 40 years, scientists have developed an amazing array of tools
to read DNA, copy it, cut it, sort it, and put it together in new combinations.
The power of this DNA technology is so great that scientists have even
determined the sequence of all the chromosomes in human cells as part of
the Human Genome Project. A new world of human heredity is now open
for exploration as scientists seek to understand the meanings hidden within
human DNA — what they find out will likely change the way we see ourselves
and our place in the world.
In this chapter, we get you acquainted with all that’s involved in DNA technology and explore the ways scientists have mapped and manipulated the
human genome and the genomes of other species.

Understanding Just What’s
Involved in DNA Technology
For years the very structure of DNA made studying it rather challenging.
After all, DNA is incredibly long and very tiny. Fortunately, the advent of
DNA technology, the tools and techniques used for reading and manipulating
the DNA code, has made working with DNA much easier. Scientists can even
combine DNA from different organisms to artificially create materials such
as human proteins or to give crop plants new characteristics. They can also
compare different versions of the same gene to see exactly where diseasecausing variations occur.
The following sections break down the various aspects of DNA technology so
you can see how they all combine to provide a window into the very essence
of existence.

Cutting DNA with restriction enzymes
Scientists use restriction enzymes, essentially little molecular scissors, in
the lab to cut DNA into smaller pieces so they can analyze and manipulate it
more easily. Each restriction enzyme recognizes and can attach to a certain
sequence on DNA called a restriction site. The enzymes slide along the DNA,
and wherever they find their restriction site, they cut the DNA helix.
Figure 9-1 shows how a restriction enzyme can make a cut in a circular piece
of DNA and turn it into a linear piece.

Combining DNA from different sources
After DNA has been chopped into smaller, more workable bits (see the
preceding section), scientists can combine pieces of DNA to change the
characteristics of a cell. For example, they can put genes into crop plants to
make them resistant to pesticides or to increase their nutritional value. This
manipulation of a cell’s genetic material in order to change its characteristics
is called genetic engineering.
Because the DNA from all cells is essentially the same, scientists can even
combine DNA from very different sources. For example, human DNA can be
combined with bacterial DNA.
When a DNA molecule contains DNA from more than one source, it’s called
recombinant DNA.
If a recombinant DNA molecule containing bacterial and human genes is put
into bacterial cells, the bacteria read the human genes like their own and
begin producing human proteins that scientists can use in medicine and scientific research. Table 9-1 lists a few useful proteins that are made through
genetic engineering.

or stroke to dissolve the blockage that caused the

Here’s how scientists go about putting a human gene into a bacterial cell:
1. First, they choose a restriction enzyme that forms sticky ends when it
cuts DNA.
Sticky ends are pieces of single-stranded DNA that are complementary to
other pieces of single-stranded DNA. Because they’re complementary,
the pieces of single-stranded DNA can stick to each other by forming
hydrogen bonds (see Chapter 3 for more on bonds and DNA). For example, the sticky ends shown in Figure 9-1 have the sequences 5'AATT3'
and 3'TTAA5'. A and T are complementary base pairs, so these ends can
form hydrogen bonds and stick to each other.

131

132

Part II: Cell Reproduction and Genetics: Let’s Talk about Sex, Baby
2. Next, they cut the human DNA and bacterial DNA with the same
restriction enzyme.
When you cut bacterial DNA and human DNA with the same restriction
enzyme, all the DNA fragments have the same sticky ends.
3. Then they combine human DNA and bacterial DNA.
Because the two types of DNA have the same sticky ends, some of the
pieces stick together.
4. Finally, they use the enzyme DNA ligase to seal the sugar-phosphate
backbone between the bacterial and human DNA.
DNA ligase forms covalent bonds between the pieces of DNA, sealing
together any pieces that are combined.

Using gel electrophoresis to
separate molecules
Scientists separate molecules from cells such as DNA and proteins in order
to study them. If a scientist wants to study just one protein, for example, she
must separate that protein from the other proteins in the cell. When scientists want to separate DNA molecules from cells in order to look for relationships between DNA from two different sources, they use gel electrophoresis,
which separates molecules based on their size and electrical charge.
Scientists conduct gel electrophoresis by inserting DNA molecules (see
Figure 9-2a) into little pockets called wells within a slab of a gelatin-like
substance (see Figure 9-2b). They then place the gel in a box, called an electrophoresis chamber, that’s filled with a salty, electricity-conducting buffer
solution.
The DNA molecules, which have a negative charge, are attracted to the
gel box’s positive electrode. When the scientists run an electrical current
through the gel (see Figure 9-2c), the gel becomes like a racetrack for the
DNA molecules, only instead of trying to cross the finish line, the DNA is
trying to get to the positively charged end of the box.
When the power is turned off, all the DNA molecules stop where they are in the
gel, and the scientists stain them. The stain sticks to the DNA, creating stripes
called bands (see Figure 9-2d). Each band represents a collection of DNA molecules that are the same size and stopped in the same place in the gel.

Copying a gene with PCR
The polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is a process that can turn a single copy
of a gene into more than a billion copies in just a few hours. It gives medical
researchers the ability to make many copies of a gene whenever they want to
genetically engineer something (see the earlier “Combining DNA from different sources” section for more on genetic engineering).
PCR targets the gene to be copied with primers, single-stranded DNA
sequences that are complementary to sequences next to the gene to be
copied.
To begin PCR, the DNA sample that contains the gene to be copied is combined with thousands of copies of primers that frame the gene on both sides
(see Figure 9-3). DNA polymerase uses the primers to begin DNA replication and copy the gene (refer to Chapter 6 for more on DNA replication).
The basic steps of PCR are repeated over and over until you have billions of
copies of the DNA sequence between the two primers.

PCR works a little like chain e-mails. If you get a chain e-mail and send it on to
two friends, who each send it on to two of their friends, and so on, pretty soon
everyone has seen the same e-mail. In PCR, first a DNA molecule is copied,
then the copies are copied, and so on, until you have 30 billion copies in just a
few hours.

Chapter 9: Engineering the Code: DNA Technology

Reading a gene with DNA sequencing
DNA sequencing, which determines the order of nucleotides in a DNA strand,
allows scientists to read the genetic code so they can study the normal versions of genes. It also allows them to make comparisons between normal versions of a gene and disease-causing versions of a gene. After they know the
order of nucleotides in both versions, they can identify which changes in the
gene cause the disease.
As you can see in Figure 9-4, DNA sequencing uses a special kind of nucleotide, called ddNTP (short for dideoxyribonucleotide triphosphate). Regular
DNA nucleotides and ddNTPs are somewhat similar, but the ddNTPs are different enough that they stop DNA replication. When a ddNTP is added to a
growing chain of DNA, DNA polymerase can’t add any more nucleotides. DNA
sequencing uses this chain interruption to determine the order of nucleotides in a strand of DNA.
Most DNA sequencing done today is cycle sequencing, a process that creates
partial copies of a DNA sequence, all of which are stopped at different points.
After the partial copies are made, scientists load them into a machine that
uses gel electrophoresis to put the copies into order by size. As the partial
sequences pass through the machine, a laser reads a fluorescent tag on each
ddNTP, noting the DNA sequence.
Although both cycle sequencing and PCR copy DNA, the two processes are
quite different. Cycle sequencing uses both normal DNA nucleotides and
ddNTPs and makes only partial copies of DNA that are all slightly different.
PCR uses only normal DNA nucleotides and makes exact copies of a DNA
sequence.

Mapping the Genes of Humanity
The Human Genome Project (HGP) was a hugely ambitious task to determine
the nucleotide sequence of all the DNA in a human cell. To give you an idea
just how ambitious this project was, when it was first proposed in 1985, the
pace of DNA sequencing was so slow that it would’ve taken 1,000 years to
sequence the 24 unique human chromosomes (22 autosomes plus X and Y,
as explained in Chapter 6). Fortunately, scientists cooperated and technology
improved during the project, allowing the majority of the human genome to be
sequenced by 2003. (A genome is the total collection of genes in a species.)

And so on...

If you’re wondering why the HGP is a big deal, think of it this way. If you were
a researcher and you wanted to study a specific human gene, first you’d have
to know what chromosome it “lived” on. The map of nucleotide sequences
created by the HGP is a huge step forward in providing the “address” of each
human gene. Armed with a roadmap of where every gene is located, researchers can turn their attention toward making good use of that information, like
seeking out the genes that cause disease.

Chapter 9: Engineering the Code: DNA Technology
The HGP and the technological advances that came along with it resulted in
many other current and potential benefits to society, including
✓ Drugs designed to best treat an individual person with minimal side
effects
✓ Earlier detection of disease
✓ Exploration of microbial genomes for identification of species that can
be used to produce new biofuels or clean up pollution
✓ Comparison of DNA from crime scenes to that of suspects in order to
help determine likely guilt or innocence
✓ Study of the evolutionary relationships of life on Earth

Designer people?
As scientists delve deeper into the mysteries
of the human genome, complex issues about
the nature of humanity and the rights of individuals are generating fear and discussion. The
questions people are pondering include the
following:
✓ If a person’s genome can be read, should
insurance companies or employers be
allowed to know about increased risks for
disease?
✓ Should people be allowed to screen their
embryos to prevent diseased children from
being born or to select only the ones with
desired characteristics?
✓ Should only people with “good” genetic
stock be allowed to have children?
These questions may seem far-fetched, but
history shows that they aren’t. After the work
of Gregor Mendel became known and people
understood that genes determine human
traits, a group of people founded the eugenics
movement. People who joined the eugenics

movement believed that certain human characteristics were more desirable than others; they
wanted to control human breeding to “better”
the human race. These ideas were carried to
extremes by the Nazis during World War II,
leading to the extermination of whole groups
of people who were judged to be undesirable.
Many people are afraid that greater knowledge
about the human genome will again be used
to harm. The reality is that knowledge brings
power, and power can be used for good or
evil. Scientists seek knowledge, but they can’t
always control how that knowledge is used.
What they can do, however, is be part of the
conversation as people explore these complex
moral issues. In fact, one of the primary goals
of the Human Genome Project was to “address
the ethical, legal, and social issues that may
arise from the project.” That this statement was
included in the primary goals of the project is a
pretty big deal because scientific proposals are
usually just about the science.

Genetically Modifying Organisms
Genetically modified organisms (abbreviated as GMOs and sometimes called
genetically engineered organisms or transgenic organisms) contain genes from
other species that were introduced using recombinant DNA technology (see
the earlier “Combining DNA from different sources” section for more on this
type of DNA technology). GMOs are a hot topic these days due to the controversy surrounding genetically modified crop plants and farm animals. The
sections that follow take a look at both sides of the “Are GMOs good or bad?”
debate.

Why GMOs are beneficial
Genetic modification has its upsides. It not only makes growing crops easier
but it can also boost the profitability of those crops. And it may even help
improve human health. Here are some specific scenarios that illustrate how
GMOs can be beneficial:
✓ If crop plants are given genes to resist herbicides and pesticides, then
a farmer can spray the fields with those chemicals, killing only the
weeds and pests, not the crop plant. This is much easier and less timeconsuming than labor-intensive weeding. It can also increase crop yields
and profits for the farmer.
✓ If crop plants or farm animals raised for human consumption are
given genes to improve their nutrition, people could be healthier.
Improved nutrition in crop plants could be a huge benefit in poor
countries where malnutrition stunts the growth and development of
children, making them more susceptible to disease. One of the most
famous examples of improved nutrition through genetic engineering is
the creation of “golden rice” — rice that has been engineered to make
increased amounts of a nutrient that’s necessary for vitamin A production. According to the World Health Organization, vitamin A deficiencies
cause 250,000 to 500,000 children to go blind each year. The company
that produced golden rice is giving the rice to poor countries for free
so they can grow it for themselves and make it available to people who
need it.
✓ If farm animals raised for human consumption are given genes to
increase their yield of meat, eggs, and milk, then more food may be
available for the growing human population, and these greater yields
may also increase profits for farmers. Currently, many dairy cows are
given recombinant bovine growth hormone (rBGH) to increase their

Chapter 9: Engineering the Code: DNA Technology
milk production. BGH is a normal growth hormone found in cows; rBGH
is a slightly altered version that’s produced by genetically engineered
bacteria. When rBGH is given to cows, the animals’ milk production
increases by 10 to 15 percent.

Why GMOs cause concern
What make GMOs so controversial are the ethical concerns. The list of concerns surrounding genetic modification is long and so serious that some
countries in the European Union have banned the sale of foods containing
products from GMOs. The concerns expressed include the following:
✓ The use of GMOs in agriculture unfairly benefits big agricultural companies and pushes out smaller farmers. Companies that produce seeds
for genetically engineered crops retain patents on their products. The
prices on these seeds can be much higher than for traditional crops,
giving large agricultural companies an advantage in the marketplace.
This issue is particularly worrisome when large agricultural companies
from rich nations start competing in the global economy with smaller
farmers from poor countries.
✓ The use of GMOs in agriculture encourages unsound environmental
practices and discourages best farming practices. Farmers who plant
crops engineered for pesticide or herbicide resistance use chemicals
rather than manual labor to control weeds and pests. Not only do these
pesticides and herbicides affect the health of plants and animals living
in the area around farms but they can also get into the drinking water
and possibly affect human health. Also, large-scale plantings of just a
few species of plants decrease the genetic diversity in food species and
put the food supply at risk for large-scale catastrophes should one of the
crop species fail.
✓ Animals that are engineered to produce more milk, eggs, or meat
may be at greater risk for health problems. Cows treated with rBGH
to increase milk production get more infections in their milk ducts and
have to be treated with antibiotics more often. Overuse of antibiotics is
a human health concern because it reduces the effectiveness of antibiotics on bacteria that cause human infections.
✓ Cross-pollination between genetically engineered plants and wild
plants can spread resistant genes into wild plants. Farmers can put up
fences, but wind blows all over the place. If a crop plant that contains
a gene for herbicide resistance can pollinate a wild plant, then the wild
plant could pick up that gene, creating a weed species that can’t be
controlled.

139

140

Part II: Cell Reproduction and Genetics: Let’s Talk about Sex, Baby
✓ Increased levels of bovine hormones in dairy products may have
effects on humans who drink the milk. When rBGH is injected into
cows to pump up their milk production, the levels of IGF-1 (an insulinlike protein) in their bodies and milk increase. Human bodies also make
IGF-1, and increased levels of this hormone have been found in patients
with some types of cancer. People are worried that increased IGF-1
in milk from hormone-treated cows may put them at greater risk for
cancer, but no clear link has yet been found between IGF-1 in milk and
human cancer.
✓ Genetic modification of foods may introduce allergens into foods, and
labeling may not be sufficient to protect the consumer. People who
have food allergies have to be very careful about which foods they eat.
However, if foods contain products from GMOs, it’s possible that the
introduced genes produced a product that’s not indicated on the food
label.
✓ Fear of “unnatural” practices and new technologies makes people
afraid of GMOs and lowers their value in the marketplace. Some
people see humans as becoming out of balance with the rest of nature
and think we need to slow down and try to leave less of a footprint on
the world. For some, this belief includes rejecting technology that alters
organisms from their natural state.

DNA fingerprinting
Although the genomes of human beings are
extremely similar — 99.9 percent similar, to
be exact — people do have some unique
sequences that make them, well, unique. In
fact, all people have a DNA fingerprint, which is
their personal genetic profile. This DNA fingerprint is found in 13 areas of the human genome
that tend to be very different from person to
person. By looking at all 13 areas, not just 1 or
2 of them, scientists decrease the chances of
getting a random match between two samples.
DNA fingerprinting is very helpful in forensics,
the science that collects and interprets physical
evidence for legal purposes. However, solving
crimes isn’t the only use for DNA fingerprinting.
Some of its other interesting uses include

✓ Identifying the bodies of victims of disasters
or massacres when the bodies themselves
are unrecognizable
✓ Testing paternity, maternity, and other
familial relationships
✓ Examining foods for evidence of genetically
modified organisms (GMOs)
✓ Detecting harmful bacteria in food and
water
✓ Making genetic pedigrees of crop plants
and different breeds of animals
✓ Revealing the presence of endangered and
protected species among materials taken
from poachers

ife on Earth comes in all forms, shapes, and sizes. It

explored (and even some they haven’t), from the deep,
dark caves of the world’s oceans to the hot springs of

Biodiversity and Classification

A

s human beings, we’re deeply connected to the living world around us.
Yet as we transform the world in order to meet our needs, we’re changing it in ways that make it less hospitable to other species.
This chapter is designed to help you understand why biodiversity is so
important to the future of humanity on planet Earth. It’s your chance to get
acquainted with the diversity of life around you and discover how biologists
organize all of those diverse life-forms into a specific classification system.

Biodiversity: Recognizing How Our
Differences Make Us Stronger
The diversity of living things on Earth is referred to as biodiversity. Almost
everywhere biologists have looked on this planet — from the deepest, darkest caves to the lush Amazonian rain forests to the depths of the oceans —
they’ve found life. In the deepest, darkest caves where no light ever enters,
bacteria obtain energy from the metals in the rocks. In the Amazonian rain
forest, plants grow attached to the tops of trees, collecting water and forming little ponds in the sky that become home to insects and tree frogs. In the

144

Part III: It’s a Small, Interconnected World
deep oceans, blind fish and other animals live on the debris that drifts down
to them like snow from the lit world far above. Each of these environments
presents a unique set of resources and challenges, and life on Earth is incredibly diverse due to the ways in which organisms have responded to these
challenges over time.
The following sections not only clue you in to the reasons why biodiversity
is so important and how human actions are harming it but also how human
actions can protect biodiversity moving forward.

Valuing biodiversity
Most people choose to live with species that are a lot like them — other
people, dogs, cats, and farm animals, for example. Living things that are different, such as slugs, bugs, and bacteria, may seem annoying, gross, weird, or
even scary. On the other hand, some people are fascinated by the diversity of
life on Earth and make a habit of watching nature shows on television; visiting zoos, aquariums, and botanical preserves; or traveling to different places
on Earth to see unique organisms in their natural habitats.
Whether or not you appreciate the diversity of life on Earth, biodiversity is
important — and worth valuing — for the following reasons:
✓ The health of natural systems depends on biodiversity. Scientists who
study the interconnections between different types of living things and
their environments (see Chapter 11) believe that biodiversity is important for maintaining balance in natural systems. Each type of living thing
plays a role in its environment, and the loss of even one species can
have widespread effects.
✓ Many economies rely upon natural environments. A whole industry
called ecotourism has grown up around tour guides leading people on
trips through natural habitats and explaining the local biology along
the way.
✓ Human medicines come from other living things. For example, the anticancer drug taxol was originally obtained from the bark of the Pacific
yew, and the heart medicine digitalin comes from the foxglove plant.
✓ Biodiversity adds to the beauty of nature. Natural systems have an aesthetic value that’s pleasing to the eye and calming to the mind in today’s
technologically driven world.

Chapter 10: Biodiversity and Classification

Surveying the threats posed
by human actions
As the human population grows and uses more and more of the Earth’s
resources (head to Chapter 11 for the scoop on human population growth),
the populations of other species are declining as a direct result. Following are
the ways in which human actions pose major threats to biodiversity:
✓ Development is reducing the size of natural environments. People
need places to live and farms to raise food. In order to meet these needs,
they burn rain forests, drain wetlands, cut down forests, pave over valleys, and plow up grasslands. Whenever people convert land for their
own use, they destroy the habitats of other species, causing habitat loss.
Even if some natural habitat remains, those patches become small and
scattered. This habitat fragmentation has the biggest impact on large
animals, such as mountain gorillas and tigers, that need big habitats in
which to roam.
✓ Unnatural, human-produced wastes are polluting the air and water.
Automobiles and factories burn gasoline and coal, releasing pollution
into the air. Metals from mining and chemicals from factories, farms, and
homes get into groundwater. After pollution enters the air and water,
it travels around the globe and can hurt multiple species, including
humans.
✓ The overharvesting of species to provide food and other materials
for human consumption is driving some species to near extinction.
Because they can reproduce, living things such as trees and fish are
considered renewable resources. However, if people harvest these
resources faster than they can replace themselves, the numbers of individual trees and fish decline. If too few members of a species remain,
then survival of that species becomes very unlikely. Case in point: Many
important fisheries, like the Great Banks off the coast of Newfoundland,
have actually crashed, which means the population of fish declined to a
point that the area is no longer fishable and may never recover.
✓ Human movements around the globe sometimes carry species into
new environments. An introduced species is a foreign species that’s
brought into a new environment. Introduced species that are very
aggressive and take over habitats are called invasive species. Invasive
species often have a large environmental impact and cause the numbers
of native species (organisms belonging to a particular habitat) to decline;
they can also attack crop plants and cause human diseases. One example of an invasive species is water hyacinth, a plant that was introduced
into the American South during the 1884 exposition in New Orleans.
Water hyacinth spread throughout the waterways of the southeastern

145

146

Part III: It’s a Small, Interconnected World
United States where it choked rivers and lakes with huge masses of floating plants, slowing water flow, blocking the light for aquatic species,
and reducing biodiversity. Maintenance crews in modern-day Florida
work constantly to try and weed out water hyacinth in order to keep the
state’s rivers and lakes usable for recreation and other species.

Exploring the extinction of species
The combined effects of all the various human actions in Earth’s ecosystems are reducing the planet’s biodiversity. In fact, the rate of extinctions is
increasing along with the size of the human population. No one knows for
certain how extensive the loss of species due to human impacts will ultimately be, but there’s no question that human practices such as hunting and
farming have already caused numerous species to become extinct.
Many scientists believe Earth is experiencing its sixth mass extinction, a certain time period in geologic history that shows dramatic losses of many species. (The most famous mass extinction event is the one that occurred about
65 million years ago and included the extinction of the dinosaurs.) Scientists
theorize that most of the past mass extinctions were caused by major
changes in Earth’s climate and that the current extinctions (most recently
including black rhinos, Zanzibar leopards, and golden toads) began as a
result of human land use but may increase as a result of global warming.
The loss in biodiversity that’s currently happening on Earth could have
effects beyond just the loss of individual species. Living things are connected
to each other and their environment in how they obtain food and other
resources necessary for survival. If one species depends on another for food,
for example, then the loss of a prey species can cause a decline in the predator species.
The sections that follow introduce you to two classifications of species that
biologists are keeping an eye on when it comes to questions of extinction.

Keystone species
Some species are so connected with other organisms in their environment
that their extinction changes the entire composition of species in the area.
Species that have such great effects on the balance of other species in their
environment are called keystone species. As biodiversity decreases, keystone
species may die out, causing a ripple effect that leads to the loss of many
more species. If biodiversity gets too low, then the future of life itself becomes
threatened.

Chapter 10: Biodiversity and Classification
An example of a keystone species is the purple seastar, which lives on the
northwest Pacific coast of the United States. Purple seastars prey on mussels
in the intertidal zone. When the seastars are present, they keep the mussel
population in check, allowing a great diversity of other marine animals to live
in the intertidal zone. If the seastars are removed from the intertidal zone,
however, the mussels take over, and many species of marine animals disappear from the environment.

Indicator species
One way biologists can monitor the health of particular environments and
the organisms that live in them is by measuring the success of indicator species, species whose presence or absence in an environment gives information
about that environment.
In the Pacific Northwest region of the United States, the health of old-growth
forests is measured by the success of the northern spotted owl, a creature
that can only make its home and find food in mature forests that are hundreds of years old. As logging decreases the number and size of these old forests, the number of spotted owls has declined, thereby making the number of
spotted owls an indicator of the health, or even the existence, of old-growth
forests in the Pacific Northwest. Of course, old-growth forests aren’t just
home to spotted owls — they shelter a rich diversity of living things including plants, such as sitka spruce and Western hemlock, and animals, such as
elk, bald eagles, and flying squirrels. Old-growth forests also perform important environmental functions such as preventing erosion, floods, and landslides; improving water quality; and providing places for salmon to spawn. If
old-growth forests become extinct in the Pacific Northwest, the effects will be
far reaching and have many negative impacts on the people and other species in the area.

Protecting biodiversity
Biodiversity increases the chance that at least some living things will survive
in the face of large changes in the environment, which is why protecting it is
crucial. So what can people do to protect biodiversity and the health of the
environment in the face of the increasing demands of the human population?
No one has all the answers, but here are a few ideas worth trying:
✓ Keep wild habitats as large as possible and connect smaller ones with
wildlife corridors (stretches of land or water that wild animals travel as
they migrate or search for food) so organisms that need a big habitat to
thrive can move between smaller ones.

✓ Use existing technologies and develop new ones to decrease human pollution and clean up damaged habitats. Technologies that have minimal
effects on the environment are called clean or green technologies. Some
businesses are trying to use these technologies in order to reduce their
impact on the environment.
✓ Strive for sustainability in human practices including manufacturing,
fishing, logging, and agriculture. Something that’s sustainable meets current human needs without decreasing the ability of future generations to
meet their needs.
The Great Law of the Iroquois says that “people must consider the
impact of their actions not just on the current generation, but on future
generations that aren’t yet born.” This law is often quoted as: “In our
every deliberation, we must consider the impact of our decisions on
the next seven generations.” A generation spans roughly 25 years, so
if people follow the rule of the Iroquois, they must consider the effects
their actions will have 175 years from now.
✓ Regulate the transport of species around the world so that species
aren’t introduced into foreign habitats. This includes being careful about
the transport of not-so-obvious species. For example, ships traveling
from one port to another are often asked to empty their ballast water
offshore so they don’t accidentally release organisms from other waters
into their destination harbors.

Meet Your Neighbors: Looking
at Life on Earth
Life on Earth is incredibly diverse, beautiful, and complex. Heck, you could
spend a lifetime exploring the microbial universe alone. The deeper you
delve into the living world around you, the more you can appreciate the similarities between all life on Earth — and be fascinated by the differences. The
following sections give you a brief introduction to the major categories of life
on Earth; we encourage you to check them out for yourself.

Unsung heroes: Bacteria
Most people are familiar with disease-causing bacteria such as Streptococcus
pyogenes, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, and Staphylococcus aureus. Yet the
vast majority of bacteria on Earth don’t cause human diseases. Instead, they
play important roles in the environment and health of living things, including

Chapter 10: Biodiversity and Classification
humans. Photosynthetic bacteria make significant contributions to planetary
food and oxygen production (see Chapter 5 for more on photosynthesis), and
E. coli living in your intestines make vitamins that you need to stay healthy. So
when you get down to it, plants and animals couldn’t survive on Earth without
bacteria.
Generally speaking, bacteria range in size from 1 to 10 micrometers in length
and are invisible to the naked eye. Along with being nucleus-free, they have a
genome that’s a single circle of DNA. They reproduce asexually by a process
called binary fission. Some bacteria move about by secreting a slime that
glides over the cell’s surface, allowing it to slide through its environment.
Others have flagella (little whiplike appendages made of protein) that they
swish around to swim through their watery homes.
Bacteria have many ways of getting the energy they need for growth and various strategies for surviving in extreme environments. Their great metabolic
diversity has allowed them to colonize just about every environment on
Earth.

A bacteria impersonator: Archaeans
Archaeans are prokaryotes, just like bacteria. In fact, you can’t tell the difference between the two just by looking, even if you look very closely using an
electron microscope, because they’re about the same size and shape, have
similar cell structures, and divide by binary fission.
Until the 1970s, no one even knew that archaeans existed; up to that point, all
prokaryotic cells were assumed to be bacteria. Then, in the 1970s, a scientist
named Carl Woese started doing genetic comparisons between prokaryotes.
Woese startled the entire scientific world when he revealed that prokaryotes
actually separated into two distinct groups — bacteria and archaea — based
on sequences in their genetic material.
The first archaeans were discovered in extreme environments (think salt
lakes and hot springs), so they have a reputation for being extremophiles
(-phile means “love,” so extremophiles means “extreme-loving”). Since their
initial discovery, however, archaeans have been found everywhere scientists
have looked for them. They’re happily living in the dirt outside your home
right now, and they’re abundant in the ocean.
Because archaeans were discovered fairly recently, scientists are still learning about their role on planet Earth, but so far it looks like they’re as abundant and successful as bacteria.

Part III: It’s a Small, Interconnected World

A taste of the familiar: Eukaryotes
Unless you’re a closet biologist, you’re probably most familiar with life in
eukaryotic form because you encounter it every day. As soon as you step outside, you can find a wealth of plants and animals (and maybe even a mushroom or two if you look around a little).
On the most fundamental level, all eukaryotes are quite similar. They share a
common cell structure with nuclei and organelles (we cover eukaryotic cells
in greater detail in Chapter 4), use many of the same metabolic strategies
(explained in Chapter 5), and reproduce either asexually by mitosis or sexually by meiosis (both of which are covered in Chapter 6).
Despite these similarities, we bet you still feel that you’re pretty different
from a carrot. You’re right to feel that way. The differences between you and
a carrot are what separate you into two different kingdoms. In fact, enough
differences exist between eukaryotes to separate them into four different
kingdoms:
✓ Animalia: Animals are organisms that begin life as a cell called a zygote
that results from the fusion of a sperm and an egg and then divides to
form a hollow ball of cells called a blastula. If you’re wondering when the
fur, scales, and claws come into play, these familiar animal characteristics get factored in much later, at the point when animals get divided up
into phyla, families, and orders (see the “Organizing life into smaller and
smaller groups” section later in this chapter for more on these groupings). Although the animal kingdom contains familiar animals such as
dogs, cats, lizards, birds, and fish, the defining characteristic of animals
must be true for all members of the kingdom — including slugs, worms,
and sea sponges.
✓ Plantae: Plants are photosynthetic organisms that start life as embryos
supported by maternal tissue. This definition of plants includes all the
plants you’re familiar with: pine trees, flowering plants (including carrots), grasses, ferns, and mosses. All plants have cells with cell walls
made of cellulose. They reproduce asexually by mitosis (described in
Chapter 6), but they can also reproduce sexually. (Flip to Chapter 20 for
more on plant structures and life cycles.)
The definition of plants, which specifies a stage where an embryo is
supported by maternal tissue, excludes most of the algae, like seaweed,
found on Earth. Algae and plants are so closely related that many people

Chapter 10: Biodiversity and Classification
include algae in the plant kingdom, but many biologists draw the line at
including algae in the plant kingdom.
✓ Fungi: Fungi may look a bit like plants, but they aren’t photosynthetic.
They get their nutrition by breaking down and digesting dead matter.
Their cells have walls made of chitin (a strong, nitrogen-containing
polysaccharide), and they don’t produce swimming cells during their
life cycle. Kingdom Fungi includes mushrooms, molds that you see on
your bread and cheese, and many rusts that attack plants. Yeast is also
a member of kingdom Fungi even though it grows differently (most fungi
grow as filaments, but yeast grows as little oval cells).
✓ Protista: Kingdom Protista is defined as everything else that’s eukaryotic. Seriously. Biologists have studied animals, plants, and fungi for
a long time and defined them as distinct groups long ago. But many,
many, eukaryotes don’t fit into these three kingdoms. A whole world of
microscopic protists exists in a drop of pond water. The protists are
so diverse that some biologists think they should be separated into as
many as 11 kingdoms of their own. But so far no one has pushed to make
that happen, which is certainly good news for you because we bet you
don’t want to memorize the names of 15 kingdoms of eukaryotes.

What about viruses?
Here’s a riddle for you: What has genetic material, exists by the billions, functions like a living
parasite, but isn’t truly a living thing? A virus!
That’s right, those nasty little bugs that cause
diseases, ranging from the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and food poisoning to the
common cold and even some forms of cancer,
may be the world’s most efficient parasites.
But, in the strictest sense of the word, viruses
aren’t really alive because they can’t reproduce
outside of a host cell.
Unlike living things, viruses aren’t made of cells.
They’re just very tiny pieces of DNA or RNA
covered with protein as protection. Because
they’re so small — a fraction of the size of

bacteria — you can’t see them, even with the
aid of a light microscope.
No one really knows how viruses evolved. Some
biologists think they were originally intracellular
parasites that got so good at what they did —
being parasitic, that is — that they were able
to survive with nucleic acid alone. Others think
viruses are cellular escapees, genes that ran
away from home but can’t replicate until they
return to a specific kind of host cell. Still others
think viruses may represent an offshoot of life
from its very beginning, before cells evolved. For
the details on how viruses attack cells and reproduce, head to Chapter 17.

Climbing the Tree of Life: The
Classification System of Living Things
Much like you’d draw a family tree to show the relationships between your
parents, grandparents, and other members of your family, biologists use a
phylogenetic tree (a drawing that shows the relationships between a group of
organisms) to represent the relationships between living things. This “tree of
life” allows them to categorize all the diverse organisms that call planet Earth
home and organize them into manageable classifications.
Although you probably know how your family members are related to each
other, biologists have to use clues to figure out the relationships between
living things. The types of clues they use to figure out these relationships
include
✓ Physical structures: The structures that biologists use for comparison
may be large, like feathers, or very small, like a cell wall (flip to Chapter
4 for more on this and other parts of a cell’s structure). For example,
organisms with feathers are related to each other and are included in a
group called birds.
Biologists consider reproductive structures to be especially important
for determining relationships.
✓ Chemical components: Some organisms produce unique chemicals.
Bacteria, for example, are the only cells that make a hybrid sugarprotein molecule called peptidoglycan. If biologists encounter an organism that produces this molecule, they can safely group it in with other
bacteria.
✓ Genetic information: An organism’s genetic code determines its traits,
so by reading the genetic code in DNA, biologists can go right to the
source of differences between species. Even organisms that seem
incredibly different, like you and the bacteria E. coli, have some traits in
common. For example, all cells on Earth contain ribosomes for making
proteins, which means biologists can read a gene that has the code for
one of your ribosomal proteins and compare it to the gene that has the
code for one of E. coli’s ribosomal proteins.
The more characteristics two organisms have in common with each other, the
more closely related they are. Characteristics that organisms have in common
are called shared characteristics.
Based on structural, cellular, biochemical, and genetic characteristics, biologists can classify life on Earth into groups that reflect the evolutionary history of the planet. That history indicates that all life on Earth began from one

Chapter 10: Biodiversity and Classification
original universal ancestor after the Earth formed 4.5 billion years ago. All the
diversity of life that exists today is related because it’s descended from that
original ancestor.
The next sections break down the various classifications of living things and
explain how each one gets its own unique scientific name.

Mastering the domains
You can interpret the degree of relationship between two organisms by looking at their positions on a phylogenetic tree.
✓ Each organism or group being compared has a branch on the tree.
One branch represents all the animals, and another branch represents
all the plants.
✓ The smaller the distance between two groups, the closer the relationship between them. The distance between animals and plants is a great
deal less than the distance between animals and any of the bacteria, so
animals are much more closely related to plants than they are to bacteria.
✓ If two branches meet at a common point, then the groups represented
by those branches evolved from a common ancestor. Groups with
a common point that’s far away separated further back in time than
groups with a common point that’s near.
When biologists used genetic information to compare all life on Earth, they
discovered that living things fall into three main groups called domains. The
three domains of life are
✓ Bacteria: Consisting mostly of single-celled organisms, bacteria are
prokaryotic, meaning they lack a nuclear membrane around their DNA
(refer to Chapter 4 for the details on prokaryotic cells). Most bacteria
have a cell wall made of peptidoglycan.
✓ Archaea: These are single-celled, prokaryotic organisms. In addition to
their genetic differences from bacteria, archaeans have some chemical
differences, including the fact that their cell walls are never made of
peptidoglycan.
✓ Eukarya: Organisms in the Eukarya domain may be single-celled or
multicellular; either way, their cells are eukaryotic, meaning they have a
nuclear membrane around their DNA (see Chapter 4 for more on eukaryotic cells). This domain contains familiar organisms such as animals,
plants, mushrooms, and seaweed.

153

154

Part III: It’s a Small, Interconnected World

Organizing life into smaller
and smaller groups
Being able to categorize the three largest, and most distantly related, groups
of living things on Earth into domains (as explained in the preceding section)
is great, but biologists need smaller groups to work with in order to determine how similar different types of organisms are. Hence the creation of the
taxonomic hierarchy, a naming system that ranks organisms by their evolutionary relationships. Within this hierarchy, living things are organized into
the largest, most-inclusive group down to the smallest, least-inclusive group.
The taxonomic hierarchy is as follows, from largest to smallest. (Note that
organisms are placed into each category based on similarities within that
particular group of organisms. Whatever characteristics are used to define a
category must be shared by all organisms placed into that category.)
✓ Domain: Domains group organisms by fundamental characteristics
such as cell structure and chemistry. For example, organisms in domain
Eukarya are separated from those in the Bacteria and Archaea domains
based on whether their cells have a nucleus, the types of molecules
found in the cell wall and membrane, and how they go about protein
synthesis.
✓ Kingdom: Kingdoms group organisms based on developmental characteristics and nutritional strategy. For example, organisms in the animal
kingdom (Animalia) are separated from those in the plant kingdom
(Plantae) because of differences in the early development of these
organisms and the fact that plants make their own food by photosynthesis whereas animals ingest their food. (Kingdoms are most useful in
domain Eukarya because they’re not well defined for the prokaryotic
domains.)
✓ Phylum: Phyla separate organisms based on key characteristics that
define the major groups within the kingdom. For example, within kingdom Plantae, flowering plants (Angiophyta) are in a different phylum
than cone-bearing plants (Coniferophyta).
✓ Class: Classes separate organisms based on key characteristics that
define the major groups within the phylum. For example, within
phylum Angiophyta, plants that have two seed leaves (dicots, class
Magnoliopsida) are in a separate class than plants with one seed leaf
(monocots, class Liliopsida).
✓ Order: Orders separate organisms based on key characteristics that
define the major groups within the class. For example, within class

Chapter 10: Biodiversity and Classification
Magnoliopsida, nutmeg plants (Magnoliales) are put in a different order
than black pepper plants (Piperales) due to differences in their flower
and pollen structure.
✓ Family: Families separate organisms based on key characteristics that
define the major groups within the order. For example, within order
Magnoliales, buttercups (Ranunculaceae) are in a different family than
roses (Rosaceae) due to differences in their flower structure.
✓ Genus: Genera separate organisms based on key characteristics that
define the major groups within the family. For example, within family
Rosaceae, roses (Rosa) are in a different genus than cherries (Prunus)
thanks to differences in their flower structure.
✓ Species: Species separate eukaryotic organisms based on whether they
can successfully reproduce with each other. You can walk through a
rose garden and see many different colors of China roses (Rosa chinensis) that are all considered one species because they can reproduce with
each other.
Think of how biologists organize living things like how you might organize
your clothing. In your first round of organizing, you might make groups of
pants, shirts, socks, and shoes. From there, you might go into the shirt group
and organize your shirts into smaller groups, such as short-sleeved versus
long-sleeved shirts. Then perhaps you’d organize them by type of fabric, then
color, and so on. At some point, you’d have very small groups with very similar articles of clothing — perhaps a group of two short-sleeved, button-down,
blue shirts, for example. All of your clothing would be organized in a hierarchy, from the big category of clothing all the way down to the small category
of short-sleeved, button-down, blue shirts.
People have lots of funny sayings to help them remember the taxonomic hierarchy. Our favorite, because it’s so hard to forget, is Dumb Kids Playing Chase
On Freeways Get Squished. The first letter of each word in the sentence represents the first letter of a category in the taxonomic hierarchy. If you don’t like
this particular saying, just search the Internet for “taxonomic hierarchy mnemonic,” and you’ll find many more.
All life on Earth is related, but relative position within the taxonomic hierarchy demonstrates the degree of that relationship. For instance, you and
a carrot are both in domain Eukarya, so you definitely have some things in
common, but you have more characteristics in common with organisms that
are part of the animal kingdom.
Table 10-1 compares the classification, or taxonomy, of you, a dog, a carrot,
and E. coli.

Of the organisms listed in Table 10-1, you have the most in common with
a dog. You’re both animals possessing a central nervous chord (phylum
Chordata), and you’re both mammals (class Mammalia), which means you
have hair and the females of your species make milk. However, you also have
many differences, including the tooth structure that separates you into the
order Primates and a dog into the order Carnivora. If you compare yourself
to a plant, you can see that you have certain features of cell structure that
place you together in domain Eukarya, but little else in common.
Two organisms that belong to the same species are the most similar of all. For
most eukaryotic organisms, members of the same species can successfully
sexually reproduce together, producing live offspring that can also reproduce.
Bacteria and archaea don’t reproduce sexually, so their species are defined by
chemical and genetic similarities.

Playing the name game
When biologists discover a new organism, they give it a scientific name.
They’ve been doing this for hundreds of years according to a system developed by Swedish naturalist Carl Linnaeus in the 1750s. Linnaeus created a
classification system that included some of the categories, such as kingdom
and class, that are still used today in the taxonomic hierarchy. Linnaeus also
proposed the system of binomial nomenclature that modern biologists use to
give every type of living thing a unique name that has two parts.

Chapter 10: Biodiversity and Classification
In binomial nomenclature, the first part of an organism’s name is the genus,
and the second part is the species name, or specific epithet. The rules for
using binomial nomenclature are as follows:
✓ The genus is always capitalized.
✓ The species name is never written without the genus, although the
genus can be abbreviated by just the first letter.
✓ Both the genus and species should be italicized or underlined to indicate that the name is the official scientific name.
According to these rules, humans may be correctly identified as Homo sapiens or H. sapiens.

Observing How Organisms
Get Along
In This Chapter
▶ Discovering how organisms interact with each other and their environment
▶ Analyzing populations and their growth (or lack thereof)
▶ Tracing the path of energy and matter on planet Earth

O

ne of the amazing things about this planet is that even though different
parts of the world have different climates, the organisms living there
somehow manage to get what they need to survive from each other and the
world around them. This chapter explores Earth’s various ecosystems and
details how the interactions between organisms work to keep life on Earth in
balance. It also covers how scientists study groups of organisms to stay on
top of how their populations are growing (or declining).

Ecosystems Bring It All Together
Life thrives in every environment on Earth, and each of those environments
is its own ecosystem, a group of living and nonliving things that interact with
each other in a particular environment. An ecosystem is essentially a little
machine made up of living and nonliving parts. The living parts, called biotic
factors, are all the organisms that live in the area. The nonliving parts, called
abiotic factors, are the nonliving things in the area (think air, sunlight, and
soil).
Ecosystems exist in the world’s oceans, rivers, forests — they even exist in
your backyard and local park. They can be as huge as the Amazon rain forest
or as small as a rotting log. The catch is that the larger an ecosystem is, the
greater the number of smaller ecosystems existing within it. For example, the
ecosystem of the Amazon rain forest also consists of the soil ecosystem and
the cloud forest ecosystem (found at the tops of the trees).

160

Part III: It’s a Small, Interconnected World
A particular branch of science called ecology is devoted to the study of ecosystems, specifically how organisms interact with each other and their environment. Scientists who work in this branch are called ecologists, and they
look at the interactions between living things and their environment on many
different scales, from large to small.
The sections that follow explain how ecologists classify Earth’s various ecosystems and how they describe the interactions between the planet’s many
species. Before you check them out, take a look at Figure 11-1 to get an idea
of how living things are organized.

Biomes: Communities of life
All the living things together in an ecosystem form a community. For example,
a forest community may contain trees, shrubs, wildflowers, squirrels, birds,
bats, insects, mushrooms, bacteria, and much more. The different types of
communities found on Earth are called biomes. Six major types of biomes
exist:

Chapter 11: Observing How Organisms Get Along
✓ Freshwater biomes include ponds, rivers, streams, lakes, and wetlands.
Only about 3 percent of the Earth’s surface is made up of freshwater,
but freshwater biomes are home to many different species, including
plants, algae, fish, and insects. Wetlands, in particular, have the greatest
amount of diversity of any of the biomes.
✓ Marine biomes contain saltwater and include the oceans, coral reefs,
and estuaries. They cover 75 percent of the Earth’s surface and are very
important to the planet’s oxygen and food supply — more than half the
photosynthesis that occurs on Earth occurs in the ocean (we describe
the process of photosynthesis in Chapter 5). Marine biomes are home
to many marine creatures such as algae, fish, octopuses, dolphins, and
whales.
Estuaries are areas where saltwater mingles with freshwater. They
include familiar places such as bays, sounds, lagoons, salt marshes,
and beaches. Estuaries are an important habitat for many different species, including birds, fish, and shellfish. Because they provide a habitat
for young fish, estuaries are vital to the health of commercial fisheries.
Unfortunately, estuaries are typically found on the coast, which is also
prime real estate for people. As a result, estuaries are being heavily
impacted by human development.
✓ Desert biomes receive minimal amounts of rainfall and cover approximately 20 percent of the Earth’s surface. Plants and animals that live in
deserts have special adaptations, such as the ability to store water or
only grow during the rainy season, to help them survive in the low-water
environment. Some familiar desert inhabitants are cacti, reptiles, birds,
camels, rabbits, and dingoes.
✓ Forest biomes contain many trees or other woody vegetation; cover
about 30 percent of the Earth’s surface; and are home to many different plants and animals, including trees, skunks, squirrels, wolves,
bears, birds, and wildcats. They’re important for global carbon balance because they pull carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere through
the process of photosynthesis. Forests are being heavily impacted by
human development as humans seek additional land for homes and agriculture and cut down forests for their wood.
Rain forests are evergreen forests that receive lots of rainfall and are
incredibly rich in species diversity. As many as half the world’s animals
live in rain forests, including gorillas, tree frogs, butterflies, tigers, parrots, and boa constrictors.
✓ Grassland biomes are dominated by grasses, but they’re also home to
many other species, such as birds, zebras, giraffes, lions, buffaloes, termites, and hyenas. Grasslands cover about 30 percent of the Earth’s surface and are typically flat, have few trees, and possess rich soil. Because
of these features, people converted many natural grasslands for agricultural purposes.

161

162

Part III: It’s a Small, Interconnected World
✓ Tundra biomes are very cold and have very little liquid water. Tundras
cover about 15 percent of the planet’s surface and are found at the poles
of the Earth as well as at high elevations. Arctic tundras are home to
organisms such as arctic foxes, caribou, and polar bears, whereas mountain tundras are home to mountain goats, elk, and birds. In both types of
tundra, nutrients are typically scarce, and the growing seasons are quite
short.

Why can’t we be friends: Interactions
between species
Not all the organisms in a given community are the same. In fact, they’re
often members of different species (meaning they can’t sexually reproduce
together). Yet these organisms must interact with each other as they go
about their daily business of finding what they need to survive. Of course,
just like relationships between people, relationships between other species
can be good, bad, or just so-so.
Ecologists use a few specific terms to describe the types of interactions
between different species:
✓ Mutualism: Both organisms benefit in a mutualistic relationship. Case
in point: You give the bacteria in your small intestines a nice place to
live complete with lots of food, and they make vitamins for you. Another
example is when fungi in the soil form partnerships with plant roots. The
fungi, called mycorrhizae, grow on the plant roots and help the roots
absorb water and minerals from a wider area within the soil. In return,
the mycorrhizae get some sugar from the plant.
✓ Competition: Both organisms suffer in a competitive relationship. If
a resource such as food, space, or water, is in limited supply, species
struggle with each other to obtain enough to survive. Just think of a vegetable garden that’s overrun with weeds. In this scenario, the vegetable
plants can’t do well because they’re competing with the weeds for
water, minerals, and space. As a result, all the plants grow smaller and
weaker in the crowded space than they would if they were growing by
themselves.
✓ Predation and parasitism: One organism benefits at the expense of
the other in predatory and parasitic relationships. When a lion eats a
gazelle, the benefits are purely the lion’s. Likewise, when a dog gets
worms, the worms have a happy home and lots of food, but the dog
doesn’t get enough nutrition. The only real difference between these two
situations is the speed of the interaction. In predation, one organism
kills and eats the other right away; in parasitism, one organism slowly
feeds off the other.

Chapter 11: Observing How Organisms Get Along

Studying Populations Is
Popular in Ecology
Each group of organisms of the same species living in the same area forms
a population. For instance, the forests in the Pacific Northwest consist of
Douglas fir trees and Western red cedars. Because Doug firs and Western
red cedars are two different kinds of trees, ecologists consider two groups of
these trees in the same forest to be two different populations.
Population ecology is the branch of ecology that studies the structures of populations and how they change. (Population biology is a very similar field that
also includes the study of the genetics of populations.)
The following sections introduce you to some of the basic concepts of population ecology. They also help you understand the ways in which populations
grow and change, as well as how scientists measure and study their growth,
and give you some insight into the massive growth of the human population.

Reviewing the basic concepts
of population ecology
Like all ecologists, population ecologists are interested in the interactions
of organisms with each other and with their environment. The unique thing
about population ecologists, though, is that they study these relationships by
examining the properties of populations rather than individuals.
The next few sections walk you through some of the basic properties of populations and show you why they’re important.

Population density
One way of looking at the structure of a population is in terms of its population
density (how many organisms occupy a specific area).
Say you want to get an idea of how the human population is distributed in
the state of New York. About 19.5 million people live in the 47,214 square
miles that make up the state. If you divide the number of people by the area,
you get a population density of about 413 people per square mile. However,
the human population of New York isn’t evenly distributed. In order to really
understand how the human population is distributed in the state of New
York, you need to compare the population density of the state to the population density of New York City.

163

164

Part III: It’s a Small, Interconnected World
The New York City metropolitan area has 8,214,426 people living in just 303
square miles, creating a population density of 27,110 people per square mile.
If all the people in New York City were evenly distributed, each person would
have 11⁄2 acres of space all to herself (there are 640 acres in 1 square mile).
However, people living in New York City actually have only 3⁄10 of an acre,
which is only 1,300 square feet, to themselves.
All of these numbers just go to show that the human population in New York
is heavily concentrated in New York City and much less concentrated in
other areas of the state.

Dispersion
Population ecologists use the term dispersion to describe the distribution of
a population throughout a certain area. Populations disperse in three main
ways:
✓ Clumped dispersion: In this type of dispersion, most organisms are
clustered together with few organisms in between. Examples include
people in New York City, bees in a hive, and ants in a hill.
✓ Uniform dispersion: Uniformly dispersed organisms are spread evenly
throughout an area. Grapevines in a vineyard and rows of corn plants in
a field are examples of uniform dispersion.
✓ Random dispersion: In this type of dispersion, one place in the area is
as good as any other for finding the organism. (Note: Random dispersion
is rare in nature but may result when seeds or larvae are scattered by
wind or water.) Examples of random dispersion include barnacles scattered on the surfaces of rocks and plants with wind-blown seeds settling
down on bare ground.

Population dynamics
Population dynamics are changes in population density over time or in a particular area. Population ecologists typically use age-structure diagrams to
study these changes and note trends.
Age-structure diagrams, sometimes called population pyramids, show the numbers of people in each age group in a population at a particular time. The shape
of an age-structure diagram can tell you how fast a population is growing.
✓ A pyramid-shaped age-structure diagram indicates the population is
growing rapidly. Take a look at Figure 11-2a. In Mexico, more people
are below reproductive age than above reproductive age, giving the
age-structure diagram a wide base and a narrow top. The newest generations are larger than the generations before them, so the population size
is increasing.

Chapter 11: Observing How Organisms Get Along
✓ An evenly shaped age-structure diagram indicates the population is
relatively stable. According to Figure 11-2b, the number of people above
and below reproductive age in Iceland is about equal, with a decrease
in the population as the older group ages. The newest generations are
about the same size as the generations before them, so the population is
staying roughly the same size.
✓ An age-structure diagram that has a smaller base than middle portion
indicates the population is decreasing in size. When you refer to Figure
11-2c, you notice that more people are above reproductive age in Japan
than below it. The newest generations are smaller than the older generations, so the population is decreasing.

Survivorship
Scientists interested in demography — the study of birth, death, and movement rates that cause change in populations — noticed that different types
of organisms have distinct patterns in how long offspring survive after birth.
The scientists followed groups of organisms that were all born at the same
time and looked at their survivorship, which is the number of organisms in
the group that are still alive at different times after birth. They then plotted
out survivorship curves, graphs that plot survival after birth over time (like
the one in Figure 11-3), to depict how long individuals typically survive in a
population.
Three types of survivorship exist:
✓ Type I survivorship: Most offspring survive, and organisms live out
most of their life span, dying in old age. Humans have a Type I survivorship because most individuals survive to middle age (about 40 years)
and beyond.
✓ Type II survivorship: Death occurs randomly throughout the life span,
usually due to predation or disease. Mice have Type II survivorship —
they never know when the cat or mousetrap will strike.
✓ Type III survivorship: Most organisms die young, and few members of
the population survive to reproductive age. However, individuals that
do survive to reproductive age often live out the rest of their life span
and die in old age. In other words, Type III organisms die young. Species
such as frogs that produce offspring that must swim on their own as
larvae fit into this category. Other animals eat many of the larvae before
they reach the adult stage (which is when they can reproduce).

Discovering how populations grow
Populations have the potential to grow exponentially when organisms have
more than one offspring. Why? Because those offspring have offspring, and
the population gets even bigger.
For example, assume 1 organism has 3 offspring, creating a population of 4
organisms. Say each of the 3 original offspring has 3 offspring, adding 9 and
bringing the total population to 13 organisms. If the 9 newest offspring have
3 offspring each, that adds 27 new individuals and brings the total population
to 40. Although the rate of reproduction per individual, called the per capita
reproduction rate, remains the same, the population grows larger and larger.
The next sections fill you in on the factors that affect population growth, how
scientists track a population’s growth, and more.

Understanding biotic potential
The maximum growth rate of a population under ideal conditions is referred
to as biotic potential. Ideal conditions occur when species don’t have to compete for resources, such as food or water, and when no predators or diseases
affect the growth of the organisms. Other factors involved in determining
biotic potential include

167

168

Part III: It’s a Small, Interconnected World
✓ The age of the organisms when they’re able to reproduce
✓ The number of offspring typically produced from one successful mating
✓ How often the organisms reproduce
✓ How long a period of time they’re capable of reproducing
✓ The number of offspring that survive to adulthood
Bacteria, for example, have a very high biotic potential. Many bacteria can
reproduce in less than an hour, and their offspring are ready to begin reproduction as soon as they’re made. If one cell of E. coli could grow without
limits for just 48 hours, the population of bacteria produced would weigh the
same amount as the Earth!

Looking at the factors affecting population growth
Population growth can be limited by a number of environmental factors,
which population ecologists group into two categories:
✓ Density-dependent factors are more likely to limit growth as population
density increases. For example, large populations may not have enough
food, water, or nest sites, causing fewer organisms to survive and reproduce. This lower birth rate combines with a higher death rate to slow
population growth.
✓ Density-independent factors limit growth but aren’t affected by population density. Changes in weather patterns that cause droughts or natural
disasters such as earthquakes kill individuals in populations regardless
of that population’s size.
Some populations can remain very steady in the face of these factors,
whereas others fluctuate quite a bit.
✓ Populations that depend on limited resources fluctuate more than
populations that have ample resources. If a population depends heavily on one type of food, for example, and that food becomes unavailable,
the death rate will increase rapidly.
✓ Populations with low reproductive rates are more stable than populations with high reproductive rates. Organisms with high reproductive
rates may have sudden booms in population as conditions change.
Organisms with low reproductive rates don’t experience these booms;
their population growth rate is fairly steady.
✓ Populations may rise and fall because of interactions between predators and prey. When prey is abundant, predator populations grow until
the increased numbers of predators eat up all the prey. When that happens, the prey population crashes, followed by the predator population
as the predators starve. After the predator population crashes, the prey
has a chance to recover, and its numbers increase again, starting the
cycle anew.

Chapter 11: Observing How Organisms Get Along
Reaching carrying capacity
When a population hits carrying capacity, it has reached the maximum amount
of organisms of a single population that can survive in one habitat (the scientific name for a home).
As populations approach the carrying capacity of a particular environment,
density-dependent factors have a greater effect, and population growth slows
dramatically. If carrying capacity is exceeded even temporarily, the habitat
may be damaged, further reducing the amount of resources available and
leading to increased deaths. This situation decreases the population so that
the carrying capacity can be met once again. However, if the habitat is damaged, the carrying capacity may be lowered even further, necessitating even
more deaths to restore balance.

Graphing growth rates
Scientists often use graphs to make sense of population data. J-shaped
growth curves, like the one in Figure 11-4a, depict exponential growth. In other
words, they show that a population is increasing at a steady rate (the birth
and death rates are constant). In nature, populations may show exponential
growth for short periods of time, but then environmental factors act to limit
their growth rate.
S-shaped growth curves, like the one in Figure 11-4b, show logistic growth,
meaning the population size is affected by environmental factors. In logistic
growth, the growth rate is high when population density is low and then
slows as population density increases.

Painting with numbers: Using statistics to get a
picture of population growth
Population ecologists use statistics to model
the growth of populations. The natural growth
rate of a population (r) is equal to the per capita
birth rate (b) minus the per capita death rate (d).
In other words: r = b – d.
If migration is occurring, meaning organisms
are moving from one place to another, immigration is added to the birth rate, and emigration is
added to the death rate. When conditions are
optimal, the growth rate reaches its maximum
and is called the intrinsic rate of increase, or
rmax. Different species have characteristic

values for rmax. For example, even if conditions
are optimal, the rmax of elephants is never going
to be close to the rmax for E. coli.
The growth rate of any population at a particular time can be calculated by multiplying the
intrinsic rate of increase (rmax) by the number of
individuals in the population (N). In other words:
ΔN÷Δt = Nrmax.

Taking a closer look at the
human population
There’s no doubt about it: Humans are the dominant population on Earth,
and our numbers keep on rising. It’s important to have an understanding of
how our population is growing because of the impact humans have on the
planet and all the other species on it. The following sections provide some
insight into this and introduce you to the special tool population ecologists
have derived to study human population growth.

The human population explosion
Up until about a thousand years ago, human population growth was very
stable. Food wasn’t as readily available as it is now. Nor were there antibiotics to fend off invading bacteria, vaccines to fight against deadly diseases,
and sewage treatment plants to ensure that water was safe to drink. People
didn’t shower or wash their hands as often, so they spread diseases more
easily. All of these factors, and more, increased the death rate and decreased
the birth rate of the human population.
Yet in the last 100 to 200 years, the food supply has increased and hygiene
and medicines have reduced deaths due to common illnesses and diseases.
So not only are more people born, but more of these people are surviving
well past middle age. As you can see in Figure 11-5, the human population has
grown exponentially in relatively recent history.

If Figure 11-5 doesn’t impress you, here are a few statistics that might:
✓ The human population doubled in the 40 years between 1950 and 1990.
✓ Every second, about three new people are born.
✓ The global human population passed the 6 billion mark at the end of the
20th century.
At current growth rates, the human population is projected to reach 8 to 12
billion by the end of the 21st century. Imagine that for a minute. What would
your life be like if twice as many people lived on Earth as do today? There’d
be twice as many people dining at restaurants, driving around, going to the
movies, hiking in the woods . . . you get the idea.
What’s scary is that scientists question whether the Earth can even support
that many humans. The exact carrying capacity of the Earth for humans isn’t
known because, unlike other species, humans can use technology to increase
the Earth’s carrying capacity for the species. Currently, scientists estimate
that humans are using about 19 percent of the Earth’s primary productivity,
which is the ability of living things like plants to make food. Humans also use
about half of the world’s freshwater. If humans continue to use more and
more of the Earth’s resources, the increased competition will drive many

171

172

Part III: It’s a Small, Interconnected World
other species to extinction. (This pressure on other species from human
impacts is already being seen, endangering species such as gorillas, cheetahs, lions, tigers, sharks, and killer whales.)

The demographic transition model
Comprehending human population growth is a bit tougher than following
the population growth of other organisms. Technology, education, and other
factors affect how different human populations grow. Richer, industrialized
nations (such as European countries, the United States, and Iceland), have
reached a stage of zero population growth, meaning birth and death rates
are equal in these countries. On the other hand, poorer, less industrialized
nations (such as many countries in Africa) have very high birth rates relative
to their death rates and have rapidly growing populations.
The major difference between these groups of nations is fertility. In less industrialized nations, families that have more children gain an economic benefit
because the children are needed for labor-intensive tasks. In more industrialized nations, fewer children are needed to work for the family, and raising children becomes more expensive, so people choose to have fewer children.
Population ecologists have developed a special demographic transition model
to note the stages of development the human population goes through in any
given country on its way to stabilization. Based on human history over the
past century or so, the process to reach full demographic transition has four
stages (see Figure 11-6 for the visual):
✓ Stage 1: Birth and death rates are both high. Basic sanitation and
modern medicine aren’t yet available to lower the death rate and extend
the life span. Demographic transition has not yet occurred.
✓ Stage 2: Sanitation and medicine lower the death rate, but the economy
still encourages a high birth rate. Farming remains a large part of the
economy in Mexico, for example, so many people there still have large
families.
✓ Stage 3: Increased urbanization reduces the need for large families, and
the cost of raising and educating children encourages fewer births. The
birth rate drops and becomes close to that of the death rate. The population still grows, however, as earlier generations reach reproductive
age. As countries pass from Stage 2 to Stage 3, they make a partial demographic transition.
✓ Stage 4: The population becomes stable, and birth rates equal death
rates. When countries reach Stage 4, they’ve made a full demographic
transition.

Moving Energy and Matter
around within Ecosystems
Organisms interact with their environment and with other organisms to
acquire energy and matter for growth. The interactions between organisms
influence behavior and help the organisms establish complex relationships.
One of the most fundamental ways that organisms interact with each other
is eating each other. In fact, all the various organisms in an ecosystem can be
divided into four categories called trophic levels based on how they get their
food:
✓ Producers make their own food. Plants, algae, and green bacteria are all
producers that use energy from the Sun to combine carbon dioxide and
water and form carbohydrates via photosynthesis. Producers can also
be called autotrophs (see Chapter 5 for more on autotrophs and the process of photosynthesis).

173

174

Part III: It’s a Small, Interconnected World
✓ Primary consumers eat producers. Because producers are mainly
plants, primary consumers are also called herbivores (plant-eating
animals).
✓ Secondary consumers eat primary consumers. Because primary consumers are animals, secondary consumers are also called carnivores
(meat-eating animals).
✓ Tertiary consumers eat secondary consumers, so they’re also considered carnivores.
Organisms in the different trophic levels are linked together in a food chain,
a sequence of organisms in a community in which each organism feeds on
the one below it in the chain. Figure 11-7 shows a depiction of a simple food
chain.

Interactions in ecosystems go way beyond those shown in a simple food chain
because
✓ Some organisms eat at more than one trophic level. You, for example,
may eat a slice of pizza with pepperoni. The grain that made the crust

Chapter 11: Observing How Organisms Get Along
came from a plant, so when you eat the crust you’re acting as a primary
consumer. The pepperoni, however, came from an animal, so when you
eat the pepperoni, you’re acting as a secondary consumer.
✓ Some organisms eat more than one type of food. When you eat pepperoni pizza, you’re eating food from both plants and animals. Organisms
such as humans that eat both plants and animals are called omnivores.
Also, organisms that eat more than one type of food belong to more than
one food chain. When all the food chains from an ecosystem are put
together, they form an interconnected food web.
✓ Some organisms get their food by breaking down dead things.
Decomposers, like bacteria and fungi, release enzymes onto dead organisms, breaking them down into smaller components for absorption.
Detritivores, such as worms, small insects, crabs, and vultures, also eat
the dead.
The sections that follow delve into the details of how energy and matter
move from one organism to another in a never-ending cycle that’s essential
to the survival of life on this planet.

Going with the (energy) flow
The energy living things need to grow flows from one organism to another
through food. Sounds simple, we know, but that energy is governed by a few
key principles, perhaps most important of which is that an organism never
gets to use the full amount of energy it receives from the thing it’s “eating.”
In the sections that follow, we reveal the principles that govern energy as
well as the way in which scientists measure the flow of energy from organisms at different levels of the food chain.

Energy principles
Some really important energy principles form the foundation of organism
interactions in ecosystems:
✓ Energy can’t be created or destroyed. This statement represents a
fundamental law of the universe called the First Law of Thermodynamics.
The consequence of this law is that every living thing has to get its
energy from somewhere. No living thing can make the energy it needs
all by itself. Even producers, who make their own food, can’t make their
own energy — they capture energy from the environment and store it in
the food they make.

175

176

Part III: It’s a Small, Interconnected World
✓ When energy is moved from one place to another, it’s transferred.
When a primary consumer eats a producer, the energy that was stored
in the body of the producer is transferred to the primary consumer.
When describing energy transfers, be sure to say where the energy is
coming from and where it’s going to.
✓ When energy is changed from one form to another, it’s transformed.
When plants do photosynthesis, they absorb light energy from the Sun
and convert it into the chemical energy stored in carbohydrates. So,
during photosynthesis, light energy is transformed into chemical energy.
When describing energy transformations, be sure to state the form of
energy both before and after the transformation.
✓ When energy is transferred in living systems, some of the energy
is transformed into heat energy. This statement is one way of representing another law of the universe, called the Second Law of
Thermodynamics. The impact of this law on ecosystems is that no energy
transfer is 100 percent efficient. After energy is transferred to heat, it’s
no longer useful as a source of energy to living things. In fact, only about
10 percent of the energy available at one trophic level is usable to the
next trophic level.
The Second Law of Thermodynamics has many impacts on energy and
can be stated in several different ways. In biology, it’s usually stated
as “all chemical reactions spontaneously occur in the direction that
increases disorder (called entropy) in the universe.” What this means
is that any process that makes things more random — like breaking
down molecules or spreading molecules randomly over an area — can
occur without the input of energy. This tendency of the universe to
become more random also applies to the distribution of energy. Food
molecules represent a very concentrated form of energy — that’s why
living things like them so much. Heat, on the other hand, is a much more
dispersed, or random, form of energy. So, according to the Second Law
of Thermodynamics, if energy from food molecules is involved in an
energy transfer, some of that energy is going to become more randomly
dispersed, meaning it transforms into heat energy.
You may hear people, even scientists, say that “energy is lost” or “energy
is lost as heat.” These statements can be confusing because they make it
sound like energy disappears somehow. But you know from the First Law
of Thermodynamics that energy can’t be destroyed or disappear. The correct interpretation of statements like these is that useful energy is lost from
the system as it’s transformed into heat. In other words, after energy is
transformed into heat, organisms in an ecosystem can’t use it as a source of
energy for growth.

Chapter 11: Observing How Organisms Get Along
Never use the words lost, disappear, destroyed, or created when you’re talking
about energy. Use the words transfer and transformed instead, and you’ll avoid
a great deal of confusion.

The energy pyramid
Scientists use an energy pyramid (also called a trophic pyramid; see Figure
11-8) to illustrate the flow of energy from one trophic level to the next.
Energy pyramids show the amount of energy at each trophic level in proportion to the next trophic level — what ecologists refer to as ecological efficiency. To estimate ecological efficiency, ecologists use a rule of thumb called
the 10-percent rule, which says that only about 10 percent of the energy available to one trophic level gets transferred to the next trophic level.

1,095,000 kcal/m²/year

Following along in Figure 11-8, you see that energy travels to the Earth from
the Sun. About 1 percent of the energy available to producers is captured
and stored in food. Producers grow, transferring much of their stored energy
into ATP for cellular work (as explained in Chapter 5) and the molecules that
make up their bodies. As producers transfer energy for growth, some energy
is also transformed into heat that’s transferred to the environment.
About 10 percent of the energy that was originally stored in producers is
transferred to primary consumers when they eat the producers. Just like

177

178

Part III: It’s a Small, Interconnected World
producers, the primary consumers grow, transferring energy from food into
ATP for cellular work and into the molecules that make up their bodies. As
primary consumers transfer energy for growth, some energy is also transformed into heat that’s transferred to the environment. This process repeats
itself when secondary consumers eat primary consumers and when tertiary
consumers eat secondary consumers. Each level of consumer receives about
10 percent of the energy originally captured by the organism it consumed,
and as the consumer uses energy for growth, it transfers some of that energy
back to the environment as heat.
But the energy pyramid doesn’t end there. As organisms die, some of their
remains become part of the environment. Decomposers and detritivores use
this dead matter as their source of food, transferring energy from food into
ATP and molecules and giving off some energy as heat.
Note: Food chains and energy pyramids usually don’t go beyond tertiary consumers because the amount of energy available to each level is reduced as
you move up the pyramid. Past the tertiary consumer level, too much energy
has been depleted from the system.

Cycling matter through ecosystems
Not only does food provide energy to living things (as explained earlier in
this chapter) but it also provides the matter organisms need to grow, repair
themselves, and reproduce. For example, you eat food that contains proteins, carbohydrates, and fats, and your body is made of proteins, carbohydrates, and fats (see Chapter 3 for more on these molecules). When you eat
food, you break it down through digestion (covered in Chapter 16) and then
transfer small food molecules around your body via circulation (covered in
Chapter 15) so that all of your cells receive food. Your cells then have two
options:
✓ They can use the food for energy by breaking it down into carbon dioxide and water through cellular respiration (see Chapter 5).
✓ They can rebuild the small food molecules into the larger food molecules that make up your body.
Yes, that second option means you are what you eat — well, almost. You
don’t use food molecules directly to build your cells; you break them down
first and use the pieces to build what you need. In other words, your cells are
made of human molecules that are rebuilt from the parts of molecules taken
from the plants and animals you’ve eaten. So really you’re made of molecules
that you recycled from your food. (Likewise, the living things your food used
to be got their molecules by recycling them from somewhere else.)

Chapter 11: Observing How Organisms Get Along
Think about what all goes into a slice of pepperoni pizza. The crust came from
the grains of plants, and the pepperoni (for the sake of argument) came from a
pig. Plants make their own food from carbon dioxide and water and then use
that food to build their bodies, which means the plant that went into your
pizza crust got the parts it needed to build its body from carbon dioxide in the
air and water in the soil. Pigs get their molecules by eating whatever food the
farmer gives them, which is likely some type of plant. After you eat a slice of
pepperoni pizza, you can trace some of the atoms that make up your body
back to carbon dioxide from the air, water from the soil, and plants that were
fed to pigs.
One of the most fascinating facts about the Earth is that almost all the matter
on this planet today has been here since the Earth first formed. That means all
the carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, and other elements that make up the
molecules of living things have been recycled over and over throughout time.
Consequently, ecologists say that matter cycles through ecosystems.
Scientists track the recycling of atoms through cycles called biogeochemical cycles (bio because the recycling involves living things, geo because it
involves the Earth, and chemical because it involves chemical processes).
Four biogeochemical cycles that are particularly important to living things
are the hydrologic cycle, the carbon cycle, the phosphorous cycle, and the
nitrogen cycle.

The hydrologic cycle
The hydrologic cycle (also known as the water cycle) refers to plants obtaining
water by absorbing it from the soil and animals obtaining water by drinking
it or eating other animals that are made mostly of water. Water returns to
the environment when plants transpire (as explained in Chapter 21) and animals perspire. Water evaporates into the air and is carried around the Earth
by wind. As moist air rises and cools, water condenses again and returns to
the Earth’s surface as precipitation (think rain, snow, sleet, and hail). Water
moves over the Earth’s surface in bodies of water such as lakes, rivers,
oceans, and even glaciers; it also moves through the groundwater below
the soil.

The carbon cycle
The carbon cycle (depicted in Figure 11-9) may be the most important biogeochemical cycle to living things because the proteins, carbohydrates, and
fats that make up their bodies all have a carbon backbone (see Chapter 3 for
more on these molecules). In the carbon cycle, plants take in carbon dioxide
from the atmosphere, using it to build carbohydrates via photosynthesis
(covered in Chapter 5). Animals consume plants or other animals, incorporating the carbon that was in their food molecules into the molecules that make
up their own bodies. Decomposers break down dead material, incorporating
the carbon from the dead matter into their bodies.

All of these living things — producers, consumers, and decomposers — also
use food molecules as a source of energy, breaking the food molecules back
down into carbon dioxide and water in the process of cellular respiration
(see Chapter 5). Cellular respiration releases the carbon atoms back into the
environment as carbon dioxide, where it’s again available to producers for
photosynthesis.
Carbon storage in living things (in the form of proteins, carbohydrates, and
fats) is purely temporary. Carbon can actually be stored in the environment
for longer periods of time.
✓ Large forests represent significant storage of carbon, which can be suddenly released back to the environment as carbon dioxide when forests
are cut and wood is burned.
✓ Fossil fuels contain carbon that was stored in the bodies of living things
long ago and then trapped in a way that the proteins, carbohydrates, and
fats were converted to coal, oil, and natural gas deposits. As people burn
fossil fuels, this stored carbon is being rapidly released back into the
atmosphere as carbon dioxide, causing the concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere to rise to its highest levels in recorded history.
✓ Carbon is also stored in the world’s oceans, in the form of dissolved
carbon dioxide. Warm water holds less carbon dioxide than cold water,
so some of this carbon may be released back to the atmosphere if ocean
temperatures rise as a result of global warming.

Chapter 11: Observing How Organisms Get Along
The phosphorus cycle
Phosphorous is an important component of the molecules that make up
living things. It’s found in adenosine triphosphate (ATP), the energy-storing
molecule produced by every living thing, as well as the backbones of DNA
and RNA molecules. The phosphorous cycle involves plants obtaining phosphorous when they absorb inorganic phosphate and water from the soil
and animals obtaining phosphorous when they eat plants or other animals.
Phosphorus is excreted through the waste products created by animals, and
it’s released by decomposers back into the soil as they break down dead
materials. When phosphorus gets returned to the soil, it’s either absorbed
again by plants or it becomes part of the sediment layers that eventually
form rocks. As rocks erode by the action of water, phosphorus is returned to
water and soil.

The nitrogen cycle
Not only is nitrogen part of the amino acids that make up proteins but it’s
also found in DNA and RNA (see Chapter 3 for more on these molecules).
Nitrogen also exists in several inorganic forms in the environment, such as
nitrogen gas (in the atmosphere) and ammonia or nitrates (in the soil).
Because nitrogen exists in so many forms, the nitrogen cycle (shown in
Figure 11-10) is pretty complex.
✓ Nitrogen fixation occurs when atmospheric nitrogen is changed into
a form that’s usable by living things. Nitrogen gas in the atmosphere
can’t be incorporated into the molecules of living things, so all the
organisms on Earth depend upon the activity of bacteria that live in the
soil and in the roots of plants. These nitrogen-fixing bacteria convert
nitrogen gas (N2) into forms such as ammonium ion or nitrate (NH4+
or NO3–) that organisms can use. Plants obtain nitrogen by absorbing
ammonia and nitrate along with water from the soil; animals get their
nitrogen by eating plants or other animals.
Some nitrogen fixation also occurs via lightning strikes and processes in
factories that produce chemical fertilizers for plants. However, the nitrogen fixation that occurs from lightning strikes isn’t enough to supply
ecosystems with all the nitrogen they need, and industrial nitrogen fixation requires a lot of energy.
✓ Ammonification releases ammonia into the soil. As decomposers break
down the proteins in dead things, they may not need all the nitrogen
from those proteins for themselves. If the decomposers have excess
nitrogen, they release some of it into the soil as ammonia (NH3). In the
soil, ammonia converts into ammonium ion (NH4+). The waste products
of animals also contain nitrogen in the form of urea or uric acid that can
be converted to ammonia by bacteria living in the soil.

Part III: It’s a Small, Interconnected World
✓ Nitrification converts ammonia to nitrite and nitrate. Certain bacteria
get their energy by converting ammonia (NH3) into nitrite (NO2–). Other
bacteria get their energy by converting the NO2– into nitrate (NO3–).
✓ Denitrification converts nitrate to nitrite and nitrogen gas. Some
bacteria in the soil use nitrate (NO3–) rather than oxygen for cellular
respiration (see Chapter 5 for more on cellular respiration). When these
bacteria use nitrate, they convert it into nitrite that’s released into the
soil or nitrogen gas that’s released into the atmosphere.

f you’ve ever been to a museum, then you’ve probably seen fossilized
bones or tools from ancient ancestors. These objects are evidence of
how humans have changed and expanded their knowledge over the millenia.
In other words, they provide perspective on how the human species has
evolved. But what was the starting point of evolution, and from what did the
earliest humans evolve?
This chapter tells you about the beliefs people had regarding evolution; how
Charles Darwin came up with his theory of biological evolution; and what
the current thoughts are on the origin of species, how humans have evolved,
and how life on Earth began. Prepare to be amazed by the proof researchers
have found for biological evolution and find out some pretty fascinating facts
about how things used to be and how they’ve changed.

What People Used to Believe
From the time when ancient Greece was the world’s cultural hotspot until
the early 1800s, philosophers, scientists, and the general public believed that
plants and animals were specially created at one time and that new species

184

Part III: It’s a Small, Interconnected World
hadn’t been introduced since then. (You could call this way of thinking fundamentalism.) In this view, every living thing was created in its ideal form by
the hand of God for a special purpose. Aristotle classified all living things into
a “great chain of being” from simple to complex, placing human beings at the
top of the chain, just under the angels and very close to God.
People also thought the Earth and the universe it occupied were unchanging, or static, throughout time. They believed that God created the Earth, the
stars, and the other planets all at once and that nothing had changed since
the dawn of creation. These ideas held through much of human history,
extending virtually unquestioned through the Middle Ages, when people even
accepted that their place in society was unchanging and predestined by their
birth.
Beginning in the 15th century and continuing into the 18th century, explorers, scientists, and naturalists made new discoveries that challenged the old
ideas of a static universe.
✓ Various explorers fell upon the New World (the Western Hemisphere
of the Earth). The New World revealed many different species of living
things, including new races of people, that were previously unknown.
The New World and the people that lived there weren’t mentioned in
the Bible, causing Europeans to debate whether the New World was
created at the same time as the Old World and whether the people who
lived there were descendants of Adam. These puzzles raised questions
about a literal interpretation of the creation story in the Bible’s book of
Genesis.
✓ William Smith, a British surveyor, classified the types of ground material
in Britain in preparation for the excavation of a canal system across the
island. Smith discovered that the ground consisted of layers of different
material and that different types of fossils could be found in each layer.
He also found that the deeper he went into the layers, the more different
the fossils appeared from the plants and animals that lived in Britain at
the time. Smith used the fossils as a practical means of identifying the
different layers of sediments, but he also made estimates of the age of
the layers based on rates of erosion and the uplift of mountains.
✓ Georges Cuvier, a French anatomist, demonstrated that fossil bones
found in Europe, such as those of wooly mammoths, could be recognized as very similar to existing species, such as elephants, but were
clearly not from anything currently living.
✓ James Hutton, a Scottish geologist, proposed that the Earth was very
ancient and that its surface was constantly changing due to erosion, the
depositing of sediment, the uplift of mountains, and flooding. His idea,
called uniformitarianism, was that the processes he observed on the
Earth in the 1700s were the same processes that had occurred on the
Earth since its creation.

Chapter 12: Evolving Species in an Ever-Changing World

How Charles Darwin Challenged Age-Old
Beliefs about Life on Earth
Charles Darwin was a gentleman from the English countryside who set out
on a seafaring journey on the HMS Beagle in 1831 as the ship’s naturalist. He
was no less religious than others of his day, but he had a very active, curious
mind and was acquainted with much of the scientific thinking of the time.
That inquisitive mind combined with the scientific knowledge he’d gained
over his short 22 years led Darwin to notice something rather unique about
the finch population on the Galapagos Islands. These observations led to the
creation of two of the most important biology-related theories of all time: biological evolution and natural selection. We fill you in on these theories and
Darwin’s inspiration for them in the following sections.

Owing it all to the birds
While traveling on the HMS Beagle, Darwin visited the Galapagos Islands,
which lie nearly 600 miles off the western coast of South America. He was
amazed to find a variety of species that were similar to those in South
America yet different in ways that seemed to make them exactly suited
to the unique environment of the isolated islands.
Characteristics of organisms that make them suited to their environment are
called adaptations.
Darwin chose to focus his attention on the Galapagos Islands’ finches (a
type of bird). Each island had its own unique species of finch that was distinct from the other species and from the finches on the mainland. In South
America, finches ate only seeds. On the islands, some finches ate seeds,
others ate insects, and some even ate cactuses. The beak of each type of
finch seemed exactly suited to its food source.
Darwin thought that all the finches had a common ancestor from mainland South America that either flew or floated to the newly formed islands,
perhaps during occasional storms. The islands are far enough apart from
each other that finches can’t really travel between them, so the different
populations are geographically isolated from each other. Geographic isolation means they also can’t mate with each other and combine their genes
(sequences in DNA that control the traits of living things; see Chapter 8).
Darwin proposed that each type of island had unique conditions and that
these unique conditions favored certain traits over others. Birds whose traits
made them more successful at obtaining food were more likely to survive

185

186

Part III: It’s a Small, Interconnected World
and reproduce, passing their genes and traits on to their offspring. Over
time, the characteristics of the island birds shifted away from those of their
mainland ancestor toward characteristics that better suited their new home.
Eventually, the island birds became so different from their ancestors, and
from each other, that they were unique species.
What Darwin observed in the finch population in the Galapagos Islands is a
type of biological evolution referred to as adaptive radiation. Adaptive radiation happens when members of one species get into environmental niches and
have very little competition for resources at the outset. The lack of competition allows the species to become rooted in a new environment and increase
its population. As the population increases, competition for resources begins,
and the original species breaks off into several new species that adapt to different environmental conditions.

Darwin’s theory of biological evolution
Biological evolution refers to the change of living things over time (it’s not
the same as evolution, which simply means change). Darwin introduced the
world to this concept in his 1854 work, On the Origin of Species. In this book,
Darwin proposed that living things descend from their ancestors but that
they can change over time. In other words, Darwin believed in descent with
modification.
As changes occur in living things, species that don’t adapt to changing environmental conditions may become extinct, or disappear. Species that accumulate enough changes may become so different from related organisms that
they become a new species because they can no longer successfully mate with
related populations; this process is referred to as speciation.
If you’re ever interested in reading Darwin’s On the Origin of Species (or any of
his other works), check out darwin-online.org.uk.

The idea of natural selection
Darwin concluded that biological evolution occurred as a result of natural
selection, which is the theory that in any given generation, some individuals
are more likely to survive and reproduce than others. When a particular trait
improves the survivability of an organism, the environment is said to favor
that trait or naturally select for it. Natural selection therefore acts against
unfavorable traits.

Chapter 12: Evolving Species in an Ever-Changing World
The theory of natural selection is often referred to as “survival of the fittest.”
In biological terms, fitness doesn’t have anything to do with your BMI or how
often you work out. Biological fitness is basically your ability to produce offspring. So, survival of the fittest really refers to the passing on of those traits
that enable individuals to survive and successfully reproduce.
In the next sections, we help you understand the difference between natural
and artificial selection, why natural selection can occur in the first place, and
what the different types of natural selection are.

Comparing natural selection with artificial selection
Darwin compared his theory of natural selection with the artificial selection
that results from selective breeding in agriculture.
✓ Artificial selection occurs when people choose plants or animals and
breed them for certain desired characteristics. Farmers in Darwin’s day
bred the cows that gave the most milk, the chickens that laid the most
eggs, and the pigs that got the biggest, creating many different breeds of
each species. People’s preferences have dramatically shaped the breeds
of domestic animals and plants in a relatively short amount of time.
✓ Natural selection occurs when environmental factors “choose” which
plants or animals will survive and reproduce. If a visual predator, such
as an eagle, is cruising for its lunch, the individuals that it can see most
easily are likely to be eaten. If the eagle’s prey is mice, which can be
white or dark colored (see Figure 12-1a), and the mice live in the forest
against dark-colored soil, then the eagle is going to be able to see the
white mice more easily. Over time, if the eagles in the area keep eating
more white mice than dark mice (see Figure 12-1b), then more dark mice
are going to reproduce. Dark mice have genes that specify dark-colored
fur, so their offspring will also have dark fur. If the eagle continues to
prey upon mice in the area, the population of mice in the forest will
gradually begin to have more dark-colored individuals than white individuals (see Figure 12-1c).
In this example, the eagle is the selection pressure — an environmental
factor that causes some organisms to survive (the dark-colored mice)
and others not to survive (the white-colored mice). A selection pressure
gets its name from putting “pressure” or stress on the individuals of the
population.

Reviewing the conditions under which natural selection occurs
In order for natural selection to occur in a population, several conditions
must be met:
✓ Individuals in the population must produce more offspring than can
survive. Human beings are somewhat unique among living things in that
we can make conscious choices about how many offspring we have.
Most other organisms, however, produce as many offspring as they can.
✓ Those individuals must have different characteristics. During Darwin’s
time, no one knew where these differences came from. Now scientists
know that differences in organisms arise due to mutations in DNA combined with the mixing of genetic information during sexual reproduction
(for more information on genetic variation due to sexual reproduction,
see Chapter 6).
✓ Offspring must inherit some characteristics from their parents. During
Darwin’s time, the laws of inheritance were just beginning to be figured
out, so Darwin didn’t know exactly how parents passed on their traits.
Modern scientists know that traits are inherited when parents pass
genes on to their offspring (head to Chapter 7 for more on inheritance
and Chapter 8 for more on genes).
✓ Organisms with the best-suited characteristics for their environment
are more likely to survive and reproduce. This is the heart of natural
selection. If there’s competition for survival and not all the organisms
are the same, then the ones with the advantageous traits are more likely

Chapter 12: Evolving Species in an Ever-Changing World
to survive. If these traits can be inherited, then the next generation will
show more of these advantageous traits.
If these four conditions are met, then the new generation of individuals will
be different from the original generation in the frequency and distribution of
traits, which is pretty much the definition of biological evolution.

Checking out the four types of natural selection
Natural selection can cause several different types of changes in a population. How the population changes depends upon the particular selection
pressure the population is under and which traits are favored in that circumstance. Individuals within a population may evolve to be more similar to or
more different from each other depending on the specific circumstances and
selection pressures.
The four types of natural selection are as follows:
✓ Stabilizing selection: This type eliminates extreme or unusual traits.
Individuals with the most common traits are considered best adapted,
which maintains the frequency of common traits in the population. Over
time, nature selects against extreme variations of the trait. The size of
human babies, for example, remains within a certain range due to stabilizing selection. Extremely small or extremely large babies are less likely to
survive, so alleles that cause these extremes don’t last in the population.
✓ Directional selection: In this type, traits at one end of a spectrum of
traits are selected for, whereas traits at the other end of the spectrum
are selected against. Over generations, the selected traits become
common, and the other traits become more and more extreme until
they’re eventually phased out. The biological evolution of horses is a
good example of directional selection. Ancestral horse species were
built for moving through wooded areas and were much smaller than
modern day horses. Over time, as horses moved onto open grasslands,
they evolved into much larger, long-legged animals.
✓ Disruptive selection: In this type, the environment favors extreme or
unusual traits and selects against the common traits. One example is
the height of weeds in lawn grass compared with in the wild. In the wild,
natural state, tall weeds compete for the resource of light better than
short weeds. But in lawns, weeds have a better chance of surviving if
they remain short because grass is kept short.
✓ Sexual selection: Females increase the fitness of their offspring by choosing males with superior fitness; females are therefore concerned with
quality. Males contribute most to the fitness of a species by maximizing
the quantity of offspring they produce. Because males are concerned
with quantity, competition between males for opportunities to mate

189

190

Part III: It’s a Small, Interconnected World
exists in contests of strength. Therefore, structures and other traits that
give a male an advantage in a contest of strength have evolved, including antlers, horns, and larger muscles. Because females choose their
mates, males have also developed traits to attract females, such as certain
mating behaviors and bright coloring.
Biological evolution happens to populations, not individuals. Individuals live
or die and reproduce or don’t reproduce depending on their circumstances.
But individuals themselves can’t evolve in response to a selection pressure.
Imagine a giraffe whose neck isn’t quite long enough to reach the tastiest
leaves at the top of the tree. That individual giraffe can’t suddenly grow its
neck longer to reach the leaves. However, if another giraffe in the herd has
a longer neck, gets more leaves, grows better, and makes more calves that
inherit his long neck, then future generations of giraffes in that area may have
longer necks.

The Evidence of Biological Evolution
Since Darwin first proposed his ideas about biological evolution and natural
selection, many different lines of research from many different branches of
science have produced evidence supporting his belief that biological evolution occurs in part due to natural selection.
Because a great amount of data supports the idea of biological evolution
through natural selection, and because no scientific evidence has yet been
found to prove this idea false, this idea is considered a scientific theory. (For
more on the importance of theories in science, see Chapter 2.)
The following sections describe some of the evidence, both old and new,
that supports Darwin’s theory and the tools modern scientists have used to
obtain it.

Biochemistry
The fundamental biochemistry, the basic chemistry and processes that occur
in cells, of all living things on Earth is incredibly similar, showing that all of
Earth’s organisms share a common ancestry.
Case in point: All living things store their genetic material in DNA and build
proteins out of the same 20 amino acids. Regardless of whether the organisms are flowers taking in carbon dioxide from the air, water from the soil,
and light from the Sun; lions chomping down a wildebeest; or humans

Chapter 12: Evolving Species in an Ever-Changing World
consuming a gourmet meal cooked by Wolfgang Puck himself, all organisms
convert food sources to energy and store that energy in ATP. That stored
energy is then used to power cellular processes such as the production of
proteins, which is directed by the genes on strands of DNA.

Comparative anatomy
Comparative anatomy — which looks at the structures of different living
things to determine relationships — has revealed that the various species on
Earth evolved from common ancestors. Just like you have structural characteristics that are similar to those of your family members (think small ears,
a large nose, and so on), structural similarities also exist between more distantly related groups.
As you can see in Figure 12-2, the skeletons of humans, cats, whales, and
bats, for example, are amazingly similar even though these animals live
unique lifestyles in very different environments. From the outside, the arm
of a human, the front leg of a cat, the flipper of a whale, and the wing of a
bat seem very different, but when you look at the bones within them, you
see that they all contain the same ones — an upper “arm,” an elbow, a lower
“arm,” and five “fingers.” The only differences in these bones are their size
and shape. Scientists call similar structures such as these homologous structures (homo- means “same”). The best explanation for these homologous
structures is that all four mammals are descended from the same ancestor —
an idea that’s supported by the fossil record.
The homologous structures of mammals are particularly interesting in the
case of whales because they reveal whales’ close relationship to land-dwelling
animals. In fact, this evidence from comparative anatomy supports the idea
that whales evolved from land-dwelling mammals into sea creatures.

Geographic distribution of species
How populations of species are distributed around the globe helps solidify
Darwin’s theory of biological evolution. In fact, the science of biogeography,
the study of living things around the globe, allows scientists to make testable
predictions about biological evolution. Basically, if biological evolution is
real, then you’d expect groups of organisms that are related to each other to
be clustered near each other because related organisms come from the same
common ancestor. (An exception to this prediction is that migratory animals
could travel far from their relatives.) On the other hand, if biological evolution
isn’t real, then there’s no reason for related groups of organisms to be found

191

192

Part III: It’s a Small, Interconnected World
near each other. For example, a creator could scatter organisms randomly all
over the planet, or groups of organisms could arise independently of other
groups in whatever environments suited them best. When biogeographers
compare the distribution of organisms living today, they find that species are
distributed around the Earth in a pattern that reflects their genetic relationships to one another.
When Darwin compared the finches on the Galapagos Islands with those
on mainland South America, the unique types of finches on the Galapagos
Islands led him to hypothesize that the islands had been colonized by finches
from the mainland. This hypothesis was later supported when modern scientists performed a genetic analysis of the Galapagos Islands’ finches and were
able to demonstrate their relationship to each other and to their mainland
ancestors.

Since Darwin’s time, many other examples have been found that illustrate
how geographic distribution has influenced the biological evolution of organisms. The distribution of organisms on the Hawaiian Islands, for example,
tells a very similar story to that of the Galapagos. Hawaii has types of living
things that exist only on those islands but are related to living things found

Chapter 12: Evolving Species in an Ever-Changing World
on the North and South American continents. The best explanation for the
unusual life-forms found in Hawaii is that organisms arrived on the islands
due to unusual events such as storms and then evolved separately from their
mainland relatives.
Similarly, North and South America were separate continents before the
Isthmus of Panama formed. Distinct groups of mammals lived in each area.
Armadillos, porcupines, and opossums called South America home, whereas
mountain lions, raccoons, and sloths lived in North America. The fossil
record shows that these groups of mammals evolved separately until the
Isthmus of Panama joined the two continents and the mammals were able to
migrate back and forth.

Molecular biology
Molecular biology is the branch of biology that focuses on the structure and
function of the molecules that make up cells. With it, biochemists have been
able to compare the structures of proteins from many different species and
use the similarities to create phylogenetic trees (they’re essentially family
trees; see Chapter 10 for details) that show the proposed relationships
between organisms based on similarities between their proteins.
With the development of DNA technology that allows for reading of the
actual gene sequence in DNA (see Chapter 8 for more on DNA), modern
scientists have also been able to compare gene sequences among species.
Some proteins and gene sequences are similar between very distantly related
organisms, indicating that they haven’t changed in millions of years; these
sequences are called highly conserved sequences.
One of these highly conserved sequences produces a protein called cytochrome c, which is part of the electron transport chain that occurs in
mitochondria. Humans and chimpanzees have exactly the same amino acid
sequences in their cytochrome c proteins, which indicates that humans and
chimpanzees branched off the trunk of the evolutionary tree very recently
(“recently” in evolutionary terms is still quite a long time, about 6 million
years in this case). The cytochrome c protein in rhesus monkeys differs from
humans and chimpanzees by just 1 amino acid (out of a total of 104), indicating that rhesus monkeys are slightly more distantly related to humans.

Fossil record
The fossil record (all the fossils ever found and the information gained from
them) shows detailed evidence of the changes in living things over time.
During Darwin’s day, the science of paleontology, which studies prehistoric

193

194

Part III: It’s a Small, Interconnected World
life through fossil evidence, was just being born. Since Darwin’s time, paleontologists have been busy filling in gaps left in the fossil record in order to
explain the evolutionary history of organisms.
Hundreds of thousands of fossils have been found, showing the changing
forms of organisms. For some types of living things, such as fish, amphibians,
reptiles, and primates, the fossil record depiction of the changes from one
form of the organism to another is so complete that it’s hard to say where
one species ends and the next one begins.
Based on the fossil record, paleontologists have established a solid timeline of
the appearance of different types of living things, beginning with the appearance of prokaryotic cells (see Chapter 4) and continuing through modern
humans.

Observable data
Biological evolution can be measured by studying the results of scientific
experiments that measure evolutionary changes in the populations of organisms that are alive today. In fact, you need only look in the newspaper or
hop online to see evidence of biological evolution in action in the form of
antibiotic-resistant bacteria.
In the 1940s, when people first started using antibiotics to treat infections,
most strains of the bacterium Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) could be
killed by penicillin. By using antibiotics, people applied a strong selection
pressure to the populations of the S. aureus bacteria. The fittest S. aureus
bacteria were those that could best withstand the penicillin. The bacteria
that couldn’t withstand the penicillin died, and the resistant bacteria multiplied. Today, most populations of S. aureus are resistant to natural penicillin.
Another strain of S. aureus called MRSA has evolved that’s not only resistant
to natural penicillin but also to the semisynthetic methicillin, which used
to be a great weapon in a doctor’s staph-infection-fighting arsenal. For most
strains of MRSA, vancomycin is the last effective treatment, but for some
new, highly dangerous strains, vancomycin is beginning to fail. In the late
1990s, the first strains of VRSA — vancomycin-resistant S. aureus — were
reported. Doctors don’t currently have anything that can fight off VRSA; if a
person gets a dangerous VRSA infection, chances are he’ll die.
Using antibiotics is a double-edged sword. By using them to fight infection,
people get healthy but they also speed up the process of natural selection.
The potentially good news is that because doctors and scientists understand
biological evolution, they’re able to recognize what’s happening and can take
action to counteract these trends (such as prescribing fewer antibiotics).

Chapter 12: Evolving Species in an Ever-Changing World

Radioisotope dating
Radioisotope dating indicates that the Earth is 4.5 billion years old — that’s
plenty old enough to allow for the many changes in Earth’s species due to
biological evolution. Isotopes are different forms of the atoms that make up
matter on Earth (see Chapter 3 for more on isotopes). Some isotopes, called
radioactive isotopes, discard particles over time and change into other elements. Scientists know the rate at which this radioactive decay occurs, so
they can take rocks and analyze the elements within them. Using the known
rates of radioactive decay and the types of elements that were originally
present in the rocks, scientists can calculate how long the elements in a particular rock have been discarding particles — in other words, they can figure
out the age of the rock (including rocks with fossils).

Why So Controversial? Evolution
versus Creationism
Virtually all scientists today agree that biological evolution happens and
that it explains many important observations about living things, but many
nonscientists don’t believe in biological evolution and are often violently
opposed to it. They prefer to take the Bible’s creation story literally. These
wildly differing viewpoints have led to one of the great debates of all time:
Which is correct, evolution or creationism? (Creationism is the idea that
God created the world and all the life on it out of nothing. Most creationists
believe the creation story that’s told in the Bible’s book of Genesis.)
The idea of biological evolution has inspired so much controversy over the
years in large part because many people think it contradicts the Christian
view of humanity’s place in God’s design. According to the ancient Greek
philosopher Aristotle, no accidents occur in nature; therefore, everything in
nature is created for a purpose. A 17th-century thinker, William Paley, built on
this idea with his theory of intelligent design: Beautiful designs don’t arise by
chance; if a beautiful design exists, the designer must also exist.
At the root of the controversy about biological evolution, then, seems to be
this question: If living things developed in all their wonderful complexity due
to natural processes and without the direct involvement of God, what does
that do to man’s place in the world? Is mankind not “special” to God?
If you have strong religious beliefs and you think that accepting biological evolution as a fact would somehow make you less special to God, then it’s easy to
see how belief in biological evolution creates conflict. But are biological evolution and religious faith necessarily in conflict? Many religious figures and scientists don’t think so. In fact, many scientists have strong religious beliefs,

195

196

Part III: It’s a Small, Interconnected World
and many religious leaders have come forward to say that they believe in biological evolution.
Ultimately, each person’s beliefs are under his or her own control. But scientists stress the difference between beliefs, or faith, and science.
✓ Science is an attempt to explain the natural world based on observations made with the five senses. Scientific ideas, or hypotheses, must be
testable — able to be proven false — by observation and experimentation (see Chapter 2 for more on the nature of science).
✓ The existence of God isn’t within the scientific realm. God is widely
believed to be a supernatural being, outside the workings of the natural
world. Belief in the existence of God is therefore a matter of faith.
✓ Because intelligent design and creationism invoke the existence of a
supernatural designer or creator, they’re neither scientific ideas nor
scientific theories and can’t be tested or observed by scientific means.
People who support intelligent design often support their arguments
with observations of the natural world, but the explanations they propose for their observations aren’t based in the natural world, nor do
they conduct experiments of their ideas based in the natural world.
Creationism and intelligent design don’t follow the fundamental rules of science and can’t be considered scientific ideas.
Table 12-1 puts the scientific and creationist arguments about biological evolution side by side so you can compare them and come to your own conclusions about what you believe.

Table 12-1

Faith-Based versus Scientific Views on Evolution

What Creationists &
Believers in Intelligent
Design Say
Nature is beautiful and complex. Many living things are
perfectly suited to their role
in nature. These wonderful
designs couldn’t have arisen
by random chance; an intelligent designer must exist.

What Scientists Say

Biological evolution isn’t random. Change is
random, but biological evolution is based on
change and natural selection. Natural selection
causes populations to shift in particular directions,
specifically those that are best suited to environmental conditions. If particular organisms and
structures seem perfectly suited to their environment, that’s because natural selection has made
them that way.

Chapter 12: Evolving Species in an Ever-Changing World
What Creationists &
Believers in Intelligent
Design Say

What Scientists Say

The complexity of living things,
from the many metabolic reactions in the cell to the incredible vertebrate eye, couldn’t
have been suddenly created
through the accumulation of
random changes.

Complex processes and structures aren’t suddenly
created out of nothing. Biological evolution works
by adapting existing structures. By accumulating
several changes that remake existing structures,
new processes and structures are created.

The fossil record doesn’t support biological evolution — too
many gaps exist between
species. Also, the missing link
between humans and apes
has never been found.

The fossil record in Darwin’s time was incomplete, but today many evolutionary lines are well
documented, including that of primates. Two
particularly important fossils that show transitions
between species are those of Archaeopteryx, a
feathered reptile that appears to mark the transition between dinosaurs and birds, and Tiktaalik, an
animal that appears intermediate between fish and
four-legged animals. Tiktaalik had lungs and gills
and was able to support itself on four legs.

Biological evolution is controversial even among scientists,
and some scientists have
proven it wrong.

Virtually all scientists accept biological evolution
and recognize its importance in explaining life on
Earth. Scientists often argue and conduct experiments about the details of how biological evolution
occurs — after all, this behavior is at the heart of
scientific inquiry — but scientists don’t question
whether biological evolution is a fact. Darwin’s
central idea of biological evolution by natural
selection is still accepted and has been supported
by many lines of research.

How Humans Evolved
You’re a member of the Homo sapiens species. Humans are the only living
species of hominids (modern humans and their extinct relatives) on the
planet, but scientists have found fossils of other hominid species that give
clues to our evolutionary origins.

197

198

Part III: It’s a Small, Interconnected World
The closest living relatives to humans are other primates, such as apes and
chimpanzees. Primates are the order of mammals that includes monkeys, apes,
and humans. They have large brains, grasping hands, and three-dimensional
vision. (See Chapter 10 for the full scoop on the various categories in the taxonomic hierarchy.)
In the sections that follow, we tell you all about the tools scientists use to fill
in the blanks about how humans evolved as well as the discoveries and connections they’ve made over the years.

Fossil finds
Perhaps the best clue to understanding why you have the physical structure you do is the fossil record of hominids. Scientists use fossils to piece
together clues about where humans came from and what our relationship is
to other primates. Hominid fossils are rare and often incomplete, but when
new ones are found, they contribute new pieces of information to the story.
Scientific theories that are supported by lots of evidence from many lines of
research, like the theory of biological evolution, don’t usually change substantially in response to new evidence. Instead, new evidence helps refine the
theories and point out important details of how processes work.
Scientists’ ideas about the biological evolution of humans have developed
over time. Following is a rundown of the different hominid fossil discoveries
made since the late 17th century:
✓ In 1891, researcher Eugene Dubois discovered a few bones in Java,
Indonesia, a large island off the southeastern coast of Asia. Calling his
discovery Java Man, Dubois thought he’d found the link between ape
and man. What he found certainly was an ancestor to modern Homo
sapiens, but it wasn’t apelike. Dubois had actually found a member of the
species Homo erectus, one of the earliest walking hominids. Other Homo
erectus bones have been found in China and Africa.
✓ During the 1930s, a researcher named Raymond Dart examined a small
skull that was found in Taung, a town in South Africa. After studying the
bone structure and realizing that the skull contained a petrified brain,
Dart came to the conclusion that the skull belonged to a child who was
about 6 years old and a member of a human ancestral species. The
remnants were called Taung Child. Dart thought he had found a missing
link between apes and men, but others disagreed. Dart was ridiculed for

Chapter 12: Evolving Species in an Ever-Changing World
suggesting that a human ancestor was “out of Africa,” when the thinking
at that time was that the first human species came from Asia (due to the
hullabaloo surrounding Java Man). But Dart persevered, even though his
belief was unpopular at the time. He classified his skull as Homo habilis,
meaning handyman, because crude stone tools were found near the
bones.
✓ In the 1930s, Louis and Mary Leakey began excavating the Olduvai Gorge
in Tanzania, Africa. Three decades later, their son Richard noticed
the jaw of a saber-toothed tiger sticking out of the archaeological site.
Digging continued in the area, and eventually pieces of three skeletons
were unearthed. The skeletons were also classified as those of Homo
habilis and were dated at about 2 million years old. The Leakeys continued their work at Olduvai Gorge well into the 1980s, and in 1984, they
unearthed a spectacular find: the first (and still the only) full skeleton of
a Homo erectus, dated at 1.6 million years old.
✓ In 1994, Richard Leakey’s wife, Meave, headed upstream from Olduvai
Gorge to Kanapoi in northern Kenya and found a 4.2-million-year-old
hominid ancestor. The lower jaw was complete, and the teeth were surprisingly like those of a modern human. However, the shape of the jaw
was like that of a chimpanzee. Pieces of lower leg bone were also found,
indicating that the creature walked on two legs. Meave named her find
Australopithecus anamensis.
✓ In the years since Dart and the Leakeys, several more fossilized bones
have been discovered along the southeastern coast of Africa, giving
Africa the nickname “the cradle of civilization.” In particular, a 3.2million-year-old skeleton of the Australopithecus afarensis species was
found in Ethiopia (part of northern Africa) in 1974 by Don Johanson; the
skeleton was nicknamed Lucy.
✓ Bones from a 4.4-million-year-old skeleton found in Ethiopia are currently being studied. The skeleton is called Ardipithecus ramidus, and
because it’s the oldest known ancestral fossil, scientists are using it to
try and determine whether this organism was in fact a direct ancestor to
humans.
Scientists can use fossilized bones like those of early hominids such as Lucy
to understand how our ancestors’ more apelike features evolved into the
features of modern humans. Table 12-2 gives you an overview of the physical
changes that occurred as apes evolved into humans.

Table 12-2

Changing from Apes into Humans

Anatomic
Structure

Changes

Arms

Because apes walk on all four limbs, their front limbs don’t
straighten completely (if they did, the apes would suffer
dislocations). Consequently, apes don’t have elbows, which
allow the arm to straighten, but humans do.

Brains

Modern humans have prominent foreheads. The size and
shape of the skull has changed as the size and shape of the
brain has changed. Human brains are now larger and more
rounded than those of ancestral species. And the bony ridge
above the eyebrows of humans has shrunk significantly in
comparison with human predecessors.

Feet

Now that humans walk upright, the shape of the heel has
changed to absorb the impact of the foot hitting the ground
differently.

Hands

The hand of a human and a chimpanzee are amazingly similar. The anatomic structures are the same; the differences lie
solely in the fingerprints. Humans and other primates have
prehensile (grasping) thumbs, which allow the gripping of
objects. Prehensile thumbs appeared in human predecessors
about 18 million years ago.

Jaws

The human jaw and teeth have shrunk. Now that humans
cook food (instead of eating it raw), their teeth don’t have to
tear and grind as much. Instead, humans have developed
chins to help support the thinner jawbone. The changes in
the jaw and flattening of the face have allowed humans to
produce language.

Knees

Knees allow humans to walk upright. The ability to straighten
the leg supports the weight of the body, and because the
knee is positioned beneath the pelvic bones (rather than
in front of them), humans don’t waddle during movement.
Waddling slows a human down, and humans occasionally
need to run.

Tails

Apes don’t have tails, and humans no longer have them
either. This anatomic feature disappeared about 25 million
years ago. However, the remnants of a tail are evident in the
coccyx bone at the end of your spine.

Chapter 12: Evolving Species in an Ever-Changing World

Digging into DNA
The development of DNA technology has played a huge role in helping scientists read some of the human history encoded in DNA (we cover the complexities of DNA in Chapter 8). By simply comparing the DNA sequences of
hominids, scientists can discover several pieces of information, such as
✓ Which hominids are most closely related: Species that are closely
related have greater similarities in their DNA sequences than species
that are more distantly related. Humans are most closely related to
chimpanzees; our DNA sequences are about 97 percent identical. Today,
the current line of thinking is that there was an apelike species alive 10
to 20 million years ago that branched into a line of gorillas around 7 million years ago. That species then branched off into two lines about 5 to 6
million years ago. One of these branches on the family tree led to chimpanzees, and the other evolved into humans.
✓ How hominids migrated: By comparing the genetic relationships
between hominids, the age of certain fossils, and the geographic locations of these fossils, scientists can figure out where species originated
and where they traveled.
✓ When new species emerged: In animals, species are defined based on
their ability to interbreed successfully. Typically, two organisms that
can successfully produce offspring are considered to be in the same species, whereas organisms that can’t produce offspring together are considered to be unique species. With extinct species, scientists can’t make
direct observations of who could interbreed. However, scientists can
look at the DNA sequences from fossils to see who was mingling DNA.
Scientists have compared DNA sequences from humans and other living
primates, as well as those from fossilized hominids, including fossilized
Neanderthals.

Check out the big brain
on the Homo sapien
It’s one thing to know how Homo sapiens evolved into today’s modern
humans. It’s another thing entirely to understand why these changes happened. For example, why did the human brain become so much larger than
that of other hominids? The clues about why things happened the way they
did are pretty scarce, but they do exist in the form of tools found with a skeleton, evidence of burial of human remains, and evidence of the use of fire.
From these types of clues, scientists can put together hypotheses to explain

201

202

Part III: It’s a Small, Interconnected World
the evolutionary pathway of modern humans. Some of these hypotheses are
as follows:
✓ As human ancestors began to walk upright, they soon began to hunt.
Therefore, they went from being herbivores to carnivores. One factor
that led to this development was climate change. As the Earth began to
warm up, some of the forests disappeared and became open savannas.
In an open savanna, it’s much easier to see prey (especially if you’re
standing). So, human ancestors became successful hunters and ate
plenty of meat.
✓ Eating plenty of meat, with all the fats and proteins meat contains, made
hominid brains bigger, and bigger brains were selected for over time.
(However, scientists still don’t know why.)
✓ As the shape and size of brains changed and enlarged, ancestral females
had to give birth earlier so the offspring’s head could fit through the
pelvic bones. Because babies were born earlier, they were much more
dependent on their mothers for a longer period of time. This change
meant that the mother couldn’t contribute to hunting, but she still
needed adequate nutrition to make milk to breastfeed her baby. The
father and other members of the clan therefore had to help the mother
by bringing her food. The fact that the mother had to rely on others for
her survival and that of her baby led to the formation of close ties with
other members of the clan.

Animal Structure

In this part . . .

as anyone ever told you that you’re an animal? Well
you are — literally — because you’re a member of
the animal kingdom. The body plans of animals are very
diverse, but they all have certain things in common,
including the need for oxygen and food. Some animals,
such as humans, are made up of many complex organ systems that coordinate the structure and function of the
body.
In this part, we introduce the fundamentals of the many
organ systems in the human body. We also take a peek at
some of the different ways that other animals do things,
including how they obtain the nutrients they need from
food and how they send those nutrients throughout their
bodies.

Chapter 13

Pondering the Principles of
Physiology
In This Chapter
▶ Connecting structure with function
▶ Understanding important physiological concepts such as evolution and homeostasis

P

hysiology is the study of the function of all living things in their normal
state. The function of living things is closely tied to their structure and
begins at the cellular level. In order to survive, living things must be able
to regulate their functions and respond to changes in the environment. In
this chapter, we help you see how the study of physiology is applicable at
all levels of life and introduce you to some of the fundamental principles of
physiology that apply to all the organ systems of the human body.

Studying Function at All Levels of Life
To truly be able to understand a living being, you need to have a good mental
picture of its structure and the function of its body and cells. Enter anatomy
and physiology. Anatomy is the study of the structure of living things, and
physiology is the study of how these structures function. These two branches
of biology go hand in hand because the function of an organism is dependent
upon its structure.
For example, the function of the heart is to pump blood around the body. The
heart muscle contracts, putting pressure on the blood and squeezing it out
of the heart and into the arteries. In order for the heart to function properly,
flaps of tissue within the heart, called valves, must close off chambers within
the heart so that the blood doesn’t flow back into it. However, some people
are born with a defect in their valves that prevents the valves from closing
completely. In these people, the heart pumps the blood inefficiently because

206

Part IV: Systems Galore! Animal Structure and Function
some blood flows back into the heart instead of going out into the arteries.
A person with this type of heart defect may have poor circulation and tire
easily. Heart valve defects are just one example of how differences in the
structure of an organism can affect its function.
You can study anatomy and physiology at all levels of the organization of
living things — from the smallest units of life (cells) to organisms. Some scientists even study ecological physiology by looking at how the physiology of
organisms is interrelated with their environment. The complexity of anatomy
and physiology grows as you move up the levels of the organization of living
things, as you can see from the following:
✓ Tissues are made of cells, which are made of molecules. The foundation of physiology rests upon the function of cells, but to understand the
function of cells, or the details of a physiological process, you need to
be able to follow the interactions of molecules within the cell. (For more
on cells, see Chapter 4; for more on molecules, see Chapter 3.)
✓ Organisms are made of organ systems, which are made of organs,
which are made of tissues. In order to understand the function of an
organism, you need to understand the functions of the organ systems
and organs that make up the organism. And the functions of the organs
depend upon the function of their tissues, which are groups of similar
cells.
✓ Organisms multiply to form populations, which interact with other
populations to form communities, which interact with their environment to form ecosystems. An organism’s interaction with the living
and nonliving things in its environment can influence its physiology.
For example, environmental toxins such as polychlorinated biphenyls
(PCBs) have estrogen-like properties and can affect the reproductive
physiology of organisms. Likewise, interactions with pathogens can
cause disease, which has a negative impact on an organism’s physiology. (See Chapter 11 for the scoop on ecosystems and Chapter 17 for
details on pathogens.)
To understand the function of a structure at any level in the organization
of living things, you often need to know something about one of the lower
levels. However, knowing everything about the lower levels doesn’t necessarily tell you how the higher levels function. Sometimes the sum of all the parts
is greater than what you expect. For instance, you likely wouldn’t predict the
intellectual and emotional properties of the human brain just from studying
how individual neurons function.
The properties of an entire system that are greater than the functions of the
individual parts have a special name — emergent properties.

Chapter 13: Pondering the Principles of Physiology

Wrapping Your Head around
the Big Physiological Ideas
In the human body alone, ten different organ systems interact with each
other to regulate physiology (we introduce you to these systems in the rest
of Part IV). Each system has its own parts and processes and makes unique
contributions to the whole.
In the following sections, we present a few physiological concepts that are
central to the functioning of all of your organ systems. With these big ideas
in mind, you can more easily see the similarities in the different systems and
understand some of the fundamental processes that regulate their functions.

Evolving the perfect form
Biological evolution, the study of how populations change over time, explains
the relationship between structure and function that’s at the core of physiology. Scientists can look at the structures and functions of different kinds
of organisms and compare them to reveal how biological evolution creates
variations on a theme to improve the functioning of a part of an animal (be it
tissue, organ, or an entire organ system) so that the animal can better cope
in its environment.
For example, today’s scientists know that the function of the kidney is to
reabsorb water into the body (we cover the kidney in more detail in Chapter
16). Within the kidney, a special tube called the loop of Henle helps set up
conditions that allow mammals to reabsorb water from the fluid that enters
the kidney, concentrating the urine and conserving water for the organism.
Mammals that live in the desert are under strong selection pressure to conserve water (see Chapter 12 for more on biological evolution and selection
pressures). Many desert mammals have an extralong loop of Henle in their
kidneys that allows them to reabsorb most of their water. These mammals
produce very concentrated urine, conserving water in a way that helps them
survive in their desert environment. By comparing these desert mammals to
their non-desert-dwelling relatives, scientists can discover evidence of the
evolution of the loop of Henle’s function.

Part IV: Systems Galore! Animal Structure and Function

Balancing the body to maintain
homeostasis
More than 100 years ago, the French physiologist Claude Bernard noted that
two different environments are important to animals:
✓ The external environment: The external environment includes the Sun
and the atmosphere that surrounds the animal. It experiences fairly
large changes, such as temperature changes as the Sun rises and sets.
✓ The internal environment: The internal environment includes the fluids
that surround the cells in an animal’s tissues. It’s mainly affected by the
diet of the animal and the amount of water that the animal drinks.
If the internal environment of an animal changes too much, the conditions
may kill the animal’s cells. Animals therefore use control systems to respond
to and counteract changes in their external environment in order to keep their
internal environment within a certain range that allows them to survive. In
other words, animals (including you) are constantly trying to maintain homeostasis (balance) within their bodies.
Many different homeostatic processes maintain the balance of variables such
as pH level, glucose level, and body temperature in an animal’s body. In order
for homeostasis of a particular variable to be maintained, the animal must be
able to
✓ Measure the change of the variable in the body
✓ Respond by changing the behavior of components in the body that regulate that variable
Most homeostasis control relies upon negative feedback. In negative feedback, a change triggers a response that reverses the change. For instance,
after a meal, the amount of glucose in the blood increases. The body
responds by releasing insulin into the bloodstream, which signals the body
to transfer glucose from the blood into the cells and lowers the level of glucose in the bloodstream.
The range of values that an organism can tolerate for a particular variable act
like a set point for maintaining homeostasis. If changes occur in the internal
environment, the changes are measured and compared to the set point. The
difference between the state of the variable and the desired set point is used
to generate signals that trigger actions, like negative feedback, designed to
return the body to the set point. For example, blood glucose must stay within
a certain range or else a person will develop the disease diabetes. When blood
glucose rises after a meal, insulin triggers negative feedback that lowers the
levels back to the normal range.

Chapter 13: Pondering the Principles of Physiology
To help you understand how homeostasis works, think of the body like a heating and cooling system. You determine the desired set point by setting the
thermostat, and the thermostat measures the temperature of the room. If the
temperature of the room is higher than the desired set point, the thermostat
sends signals to turn on the cooling system. When the temperature of the
room reaches the set point, the thermostat sends signals to turn off the cooling system. Just like your body, the heating system has a mechanism for measuring the change in the variable (in this case, temperature) and then
responding to that change (by turning on the heating and cooling systems).
As you study the human body’s organ systems, you can expect to encounter
many examples of homeostatic control and negative feedback. Although the
details of each control system are different, they all have the same three
components:
✓ A receptor: The receptor measures changes in the variable, such as
blood pressure, body temperature, or heart rate, and sends information
to the control center.
✓ A control center: The control center can be a neuron or gland so long as
it processes the information, initiates a response to keep the variable
within its normal range, and sends the response to an effector.
✓ An effector: Often a muscle or a gland, an effector carries out the body’s
response.
Homeostasis doesn’t keep conditions in the body exactly the same all the
time. The set point for a variable can change depending on the situation the
organism is in. Your body temperature, for example, changes throughout the
day. It may drop low while you sleep, or it may be high when you exercise.
So you see, homeostasis keeps your internal environment within a particular
ideal range, but it doesn’t keep it rigidly fixed at one point.

Getting the message across
plasma membranes
Cells communicate with other cells, with tissues, and with organs. This
communication is vital to the integration of all the body systems and to the
maintenance of homeostasis (covered in the preceding section). The plasma
membranes of cells separate them from their environment, maintaining a
delicate balance between the outside and the inside of the cell (for more
on plasma membranes, see Chapter 4). In complex, multicellular organisms
such as humans, each cell has a specialized function (head to Chapter 19 for
details on how cells become specialized). The function of the entire organism
depends upon the coordinated functioning of all the cells within the body.

209

210

Part IV: Systems Galore! Animal Structure and Function
Signals are received by cells at the plasma membrane and then passed inside
the cell by a process called signal transduction. During signal transduction:
1. A signal arrives at the plasma membrane of a cell and binds to a
receptor in the plasma membrane.
Signaling molecules that bind to receptors are called ligands. Each ligand
binds specifically to its unique receptor, so cellular responses to each
signal are very specific.
2. The receptor in the plasma membrane changes in response to the
signal.
For example, the receptor may change shape.
3. The receptor interacts with a messenger molecule inside the cell that
receives the signal and changes in response.
4. The intracellular messenger interacts with a target protein that causes
a change in the behavior of the cell.
The change in behavior is often the result of changes in gene expression
(see Chapter 8 for more on this topic).

Recognizing that what comes
in, must go out
Organisms must take in matter and energy from their environment in order
to survive, but they can’t create (or destroy) either one. Instead, they must
transform matter and energy from one form to another. The reactions that
make this possible are the metabolism of an organism (see Chapter 5 for
more on metabolism).
The Law of Mass Balance says that if the amount of a substance in the body
is to remain constant, any input must be offset by an equal output. Simply
stated, ins must equal outs.
Mass balance is the fundamental principle underlying the regulation of several systems in the human body, including
✓ The concentration of oxygen and carbon dioxide in the respiratory
system
✓ The flow of blood through the heart
✓ The clearance of materials through the kidneys
✓ Water and electrolyte balance in the blood
In any of these systems, control mechanisms return the body to homeostasis
when mass balance is disrupted.

Moving and Shaking: Skeletal and
Muscular Systems
In This Chapter
▶ Seeing how animals move from one place to another
▶ Surveying the various skeletal systems
▶ Understanding what makes muscles so valuable

T

he coordinated efforts of muscles and skeletons are what make animal
movements possible. Muscles pull or push, and skeletons give the
muscles something to pull or push against. Prepare to find out all about how
animals move from place to place as you discover the different types of skeletons and the fundamentals of muscle function in this chapter.

Doing the Locomotion, Animal-Style
Fish swim, dogs run, frogs jump, worms crawl, and birds fly. Each of these
types of locomotion, movement from one place to another, requires animals
to use energy to overcome the forces of friction and gravity that would otherwise hold them to the Earth.
Each different animal is adapted for the environment it lives in and the type
of locomotion it performs.
✓ Swimming animals, such as fish and whales, have bodies that are shaped
to minimize resistance as they move through the water. They’re often
coated with water-resistant mucus and may have structures that make
them more buoyant.
✓ Birds have hollow bones and wings that are shaped like those of an airplane to create added lift during flight.
✓ Animals that walk or run on land, such as lions and elephants, have a
strong skeleton and muscles to support them against the force of gravity.

212

Part IV: Systems Galore! Animal Structure and Function
✓ Rabbits, kangaroos, and other animals that jump or hop have extralarge
leg muscles and strong tendons to help put some spring in their hop.
✓ Animals that slither or crawl, think worms and snakes, have smooth,
tubular bodies to lessen resistance due to friction as they move over or
through soil.

The Types of Skeletal Systems
Skeletons support animals, give their bodies shape, and protect their internal
organs, but not all animals have the same type of skeleton. Following are the
three different kinds of skeletons you may see in your study of biology:
✓ Hydrostatic skeletons: Found in creatures such as worms and jellies, hydrostatic skeletons are basically chambers filled with water. Animals with this
skeleton type move and change their shape by squeezing their water-filled
chambers — just like what happens when you squeeze a water balloon.
✓ Exoskeletons: These are exactly what they sound like — skeletons on
the outside of the body. You’re probably quite familiar with these hard
exterior coverings because they’re found on crabs, lobsters, and many
insects. Exoskeletons are rigid and can’t expand as animals grow, so animals must molt, or shed, their exoskeletons periodically. After an animal
molts, its new exoskeleton is soft — as in a soft-shelled crab.
✓ Endoskeletons: The most familiar of all skeleton types is the endoskeleton. After all, it’s the kind of skeleton you have. An endoskeleton exists
within an animal’s body. The human endoskeleton is hard because
it’s partially constructed of the mineral calcium. The endoskeletons of
other animals may be more flexible — for example, the endoskeleton of
a shark is made of cartilage, the same material that makes up the soft
parts of your nose.
Animals with hydrostatic skeletons and exoskeletons are considered invertebrates, meaning they don’t have a backbone. Animals with endoskeletons, like
you, are considered vertebrates because they have a backbone.
The following sections not only break down the parts of a vertebrate animal’s
skeleton but they also get you more familiar with the important components
of your skeleton — bones and joints.

Splitting apart vertebrate skeletons
All vertebrate skeletons— whether they belong to humans, snakes, bats, or
whales — developed from the same ancestral skeleton (which explains why
you may notice similarities between your skeleton and that of your pet dog

Chapter 14: Moving and Shaking: Skeletal and Muscular Systems
or cat). Today, these animals show their relationship to each other in part
due to homologous structures — structures that are equivalent to each other
in their origin (see Chapter 12 for more on homologous structures and their
importance to the study of evolution).
All vertebrates’ skeletons, whether yours (see Figure 14-1), a whale’s, or a
cat’s, have two main parts:
✓ The axial skeleton: This part supports the central column, or axis, of
the animal. The axial skeleton includes the skull, the backbone (also
called the vertebral column), and the rib cage. The skull protects the
brain, the backbone protects the spine, and the rib cage protects the
lungs and heart.
✓ The appendicular skeleton: This part extends from the axial skeleton
out into the arms and legs (which are also known as appendages). It
includes the shoulders, pelvis, and bones of the arms and legs.
In some vertebrates, such as snakes, the appendicular skeleton has
become extremely reduced or nonexistent.

Boning up on bones
If you’ve ever watched an old Western movie, you’ve probably seen images of
bones bleached white by the Sun and scattered alongside a pioneer trail. The
dry white bones of these images are very different from the living bones that
are in your body right now. Bone is actually a moist, living tissue that contains different layers and cell types.
✓ Fibrous connective tissue covers the exterior of bones and helps heal
breaks in an injured bone by forming new bone.
✓ Bone cells, which are embedded in a bone matrix, give cells their hard
nature. The cells actually make the matrix, which consists of collagen that
has been hardened by the attachment of calcium and phosphate crystals.
✓ Cartilage covers the ends of bones and protects them from damage as
they rub against each other.
The tissues found within living bone fall into two categories:
✓ Spongy bone tissues are filled with little holes, similar to those you see
in volcanic rocks. These holes are filled with red bone marrow, which is
the tissue that produces your blood cells.

213

214

✓ Compact bone tissues are hard and dense. A cavity within compact
bone is filled with yellow bone marrow, which is mostly stored fat. If the
body suddenly loses a large amount of blood, it converts the yellow
bone marrow to red bone marrow so that blood cell production can be
increased.

Got broken bones?
The number of broken bones in American
children is on the rise, and doctors think this
increase may be due to kids exercising less
and drinking less milk. Exercise is important
because it puts weight on your bones, which
encourages bone growth and helps keep bones
dense. Milk is important because the calcium
and vitamin D found within it are vital for the

development of healthy, strong bones. Doctors
recommend milk as an excellent source of concentrated calcium that’s easily absorbed by the
body. To get your daily dose, drink four 8-ounce
glasses per day, or take a calcium supplement
(with your doctor’s permission, of course).
(Note: Bone mass stops increasing after age
20, so get your calcium in before then!)

Joining the movement fun
Joints are structures where two bones are attached so that bones can move
relative to each other. Bones are held together at joints by ligaments, which
are strong, fibrous, connective tissues.
Three different types of joints enable the many movements of animals:
✓ Ball and socket joints consist of one bone, with a rounded, ball-like end,
that fits into another bone, which has a smooth, dishlike surface. Your
arms and legs fit into your skeleton with ball and socket joints, which is
why you’re able to rotate your arms and legs in all directions.
✓ Pivot joints allow you to swivel a bone. When you rotate your arm so
that your palm faces up, then down, then up again, you’re using a pivot
joint.
✓ Hinge joints allow you to bring two bones close together or move them
farther apart, much like you open and close a book. Your elbows and
knees have pivot joints that allow you to extend and contract your arms
and legs.

Why Muscles Are So Essential
Muscles are extremely important to your body — and not just because toned
ones make your body look better and grow stronger. Without muscles, you
couldn’t walk, run, or play sports. You couldn’t even obtain nutrients from
your food or send blood to all the organs and tissues throughout your body.

215

216

Part IV: Systems Galore! Animal Structure and Function
Following is a rundown of all the things muscles do for you:
✓ Muscles allow you to stand upright. The force of gravity is strong; without your muscles, it’d keep you pinned to the ground. Your muscles contract so you can push against the surface of the Earth and stand upright
and assume different positions.
✓ Muscles make it possible for you to move. Every little movement that
your body performs, including blinking and smiling (or frowning), is controlled by your muscles.
✓ Muscles allow you to digest. Muscles all along your digestive tract keep
food moving downward and outward. Peristalsis, the squeezing of food
down through the esophagus, stomach, and intestines, is due to the
contraction of these muscles. If they didn’t contract to squeeze food
throughout your digestive system, you’d never be able to obtain the
nutrients you need to survive.
✓ Muscles affect the rate of blood flow. Blood vessels contain muscle
tissue that allows them to dilate so blood can flow faster or to contract
so blood flow slows down. Muscle contraction is also responsible for
the movement of blood through your veins. (Not to mention that your
heart is actually a muscle; without it, your blood wouldn’t be flowing
anywhere, period!)
✓ Muscles help you maintain a normal body temperature. Muscles give
off heat when they contract, and your body uses that heat to maintain
your body temperature because you continually lose some heat through
your skin. This fact explains why you shiver when you’re cold; shivering
is your body’s way of trying to generate heat.
✓ Muscles hold your skeleton together. The ligaments and tendons at the
ends of your muscles wrap around joints, holding together the joints —
and therefore the bones of your skeleton.
Figure 14-2 gives you an up-close view of the human muscular system. To
find out about the specific types of muscle tissue in your body and how your
muscles contract, check out the next sections.

Muscle tissue and physiology
Muscle tissues are made up of muscle fibers, and muscle fibers contain many,
many myofibrils — the parts of the muscle fiber that contract. Myofibrils are
perfectly aligned, which makes muscles look striped, or striated. The repeating unit of these striations — containing light and dark bands — is called a
sarcomere.

218

Part IV: Systems Galore! Animal Structure and Function
Three types of muscle tissue exist within your body:
✓ Cardiac muscle is found in the heart. The fibers of cardiac muscle have
one nucleus (so they’re uninucleated), are striated (so they have light
and dark bands), and are cylindrical in shape and branched. The fibers
interlock so contractions can spread quickly through the heart. Between
contractions, cardiac fibers relax completely so the muscle doesn’t get
fatigued. Cardiac muscle contraction is totally involuntary, meaning it
occurs without nervous stimulation and doesn’t require conscious
control.
✓ Smooth muscle is found in the walls of internal organs that are hollow,
such as the stomach, bladder, intestines, or lungs. The fibers of smooth
muscle tissue are uninucleated, shaped like spindles, and arranged in
parallel lines; they form sheets of muscle tissue. Smooth muscle contraction occurs involuntarily and more slowly than skeletal muscle contraction, which means smooth muscle can stay contracted longer than
skeletal muscle and not fatigue as easily.
✓ Skeletal muscle is probably what you think of when you picture a
muscle. The fibers of skeletal muscle have many nuclei (so they’re multinucleated) and are both striated and cylindrical; they run the length of
the muscle. Skeletal muscle is controlled by the nervous system (which
we describe in Chapter 18). The movement and contraction of skeletal
muscle can be stimulated consciously, which means you consciously
decide that you’re going to stand up and walk across the room, an
action that requires the use of muscle. Therefore, skeletal muscle contraction is said to be voluntary.

Muscle contraction
Muscle contractions rely on the movements of the filaments that make up
myofibrils. Basically, the different filament types slide over each other to
cause a muscle contraction; this general theory is referred to as the slidingfilament theory.
The two filament types found in myofibrils are
✓ Actin (thin) filaments: An actin, or thin, filament is made up of two
strands of actin, which is a protein that’s wound in a double helix (just
like DNA). It has molecules of troponin and tropomyosin at binding sites
along its actin double helix.
✓ Myosin (thick) filaments: A myosin, or thick, filament contains groups of
myosin, a type of protein with a bulbous end. Multiple strands of myosin
are mixed together in opposite directions in muscle tissue, so it appears
that both ends of myosin filaments are bulbous.

Chapter 14: Moving and Shaking: Skeletal and Muscular Systems
The actin filaments are attached to something called a Z-line, and the myosin
filaments lie between the actin filaments, unattached to Z-lines. From Z-line to
Z-line is one sarcomere, which is a unit of contraction. You can see all of these
parts and more in Figure 14-3, which shows you how skeletal muscle is connected to the nervous system and how it contracts.

The other element necessary for muscle contractions is adenosine triphosphate, or ATP for short (we cover this energy-storing molecule in greater
detail in Chapter 5). A muscle fiber contains only enough ATP to sustain a
contraction for about one second. After muscle cells use up their available
ATP, they get more by
✓ Using energy from stored phosphocreatine molecules: Phosphocreatine,
which is made up of ATP and creatine, forms during periods of no
contraction. It’s quickly broken down to release more ATP as the low
amounts of ATP in a muscle cell are used up.
✓ Increasing the rate of cellular respiration: Muscle cells are loaded
with mitochondria, organelles that perform cellular respiration. During
cellular respiration, the mitochondria use oxygen to break down food
molecules and transfer their energy to ATP (described in Chapter 5). As
your muscle cells use up their ATP, you breathe harder to supply them
with more oxygen so they can do more cellular respiration.

219

220

Part IV: Systems Galore! Animal Structure and Function
✓ Recycling ADP molecules into ATP: Every time a muscle cell uses an
ATP molecule for energy, a phosphate is removed, producing adenosine
diphosphate, or ADP. Human muscle cells take every two molecules of
ADP produced during contraction and recombine them to make a new
ATP molecule plus a molecule of adenosine monophosphate, or AMP.
✓ Resorting to lactic acid fermentation: Lactic acid fermentation, which
produces a small amount of ATP through the partial breakdown of glucose, is a worst-case scenario for muscle cells. Cells make a lot more
ATP for each glucose molecule they break down by cellular respiration
than they do by lactic acid fermentation. So, cells resort to lactic acid
fermentation only when ATP can’t be obtained through cellular respiration, a situation that can occur when the body’s oxygen stores are
depleted.
According to the sliding-filament theory, muscle contraction occurs via the following process:
1. ATP binds to the bulbous end of a myosin filament and splits into a
molecule of ADP plus a molecule of inorganic phosphate (Pi ).
The ADP and Pi stay attached to the myosin.
2. Calcium binds to the troponin in the actin filament, which causes the
tropomyosin in the actin filament to move out of the way so the binding sites on the actin filament can open.
3. After the actin filament’s binding sites are exposed, myosin binds to
the actin, which causes myosin to release the ADP and Pi.
4. When myosin releases the ADP and Pi so it can link to actin, the shape
of the bulbous end of the myosin filament changes and the actin filament slides toward the middle of the sarcomere, pulling the Z-lines at
the end of the sarcomere closer together.
The result? A shortening, or contraction, of the muscle fiber.
5. The connection between the actin and myosin filaments breaks when
another ATP molecule attaches to the bulbous end of the myosin
filament.

E

very living thing needs to be able to exchange materials (think food,
oxygen, and waste products) with the environment and circulate these
materials around their bodies. Complex animals use respiratory systems to
exchange gases such as oxygen and carbon dioxide with their environment
and circulatory systems (often called cardiovascular systems when they’re in
animals with backbones) to move nutrients and gases around their bodies.
In this chapter, we present some of the different processes used by animals
to exchange and move important materials. In particular, we focus on the
details of the human respiratory and circulatory systems.

Passing Gas: How Animals “Breathe”
All animals, from worms and fish to insects and humans, must exchange
gases between themselves and their environment on a continual basis
throughout every moment of their lives. Simple animals exchange gases
throughout their entire body surfaces, whereas more complex animals have
respiratory systems that process the air from the environment. This latter
group relies on breathing to simultaneously move oxygen gas from the air
into the body and remove carbon dioxide from the body and return it to
the air. Ultimately, whichever way an animal does it, the actual exchange of
oxygen and carbon dioxide gases between the animal and its environment
occurs across a moist surface.

222

Part IV: Systems Galore! Animal Structure and Function
Respiration is the entire process of taking air in, exchanging needed gases for
unnecessary gases, using the needed gases, and releasing the waste form of
gases.
Animals use four types of gas-exchange systems, which we cover in detail in
the next sections:
✓ Integumentary exchange occurs through the outer surface of an animal.
Worms and amphibians employ this system.
✓ Gills are external structures that exchange gases in watery environments, which is why you find gills on many forms of marine life.
✓ Tracheal exchange systems rely on a network of tubes that end in holes
to move oxygen and carbon dioxide throughout the bodies of certain
types of insects.
✓ Lungs are internal structures that use diffusion to transport gases into
and out of the body. Land animals, including humans, and marine mammals, such as dolphins and whales, have lungs.

Integumentary exchange
To understand integumentary exchange, you first need to know what the
heck an integument is. The integument is the outer covering of an animal. In
worms, frogs, and salamanders — all of which respire through integumentary exchange — the integument is more of an outer membrane; in you, the
integument is your skin.
Small animals that constantly stay moist may “breathe” right through their
skin. Oxygen from the air diffuses through such an animal’s moist surface
and into the fluids in its body; at the same time, carbon dioxide diffuses out.
(Refer to Chapter 4 for a full explanation of diffusion.) Because oxygen and
carbon dioxide are swapped across the integument, this process is called
integumentary exchange.
Earthworms are a perfect example of integumentary exchange in action. They
have small blood vessels called capillaries right under their “skin.” As an
earthworm moves through the soil, it loosens the soil, creating air pockets.
The worm takes in oxygen from the air pockets and releases carbon dioxide
right through its outer surface.
You know how worms get flooded out of the ground when it rains and end up
all over your driveway and sidewalk? Well, they head right back into the soil
as soon as they can (and not just because they’re potential bird food). If they
lingered on your driveway, their outer surfaces would dry out, preventing
them from taking in oxygen and getting rid of carbon dioxide. When this

Chapter 15: Going with the Flow: Respiratory and Circulatory Systems
happens, they die. (This is also the reason why pouring salt on a slug stops
it in its slimy tracks. The salt dehydrates its outer surface, which prevents it
from exchanging gases.)

Gills
Animals that live in water, including lobsters and starfish, have gills, which
are extensions of their outer membranes. The membranes in gills are
very thin (usually just one cell thick), which allows for easy gas exchange.
Capillaries connect to the cells in the gills so that gases can be taken in from
the water and passed into the bloodstream of the aquatic animal. Also, gaseous waste can diffuse from the capillaries into the cells of the gills and pass
out into the watery environment.
The type of gill you’re probably most familiar with is that of a fish. In fish, the
gills are membranous filaments covered by a flap called an operculum, which
is the flap you can see opening and closing on the head of a fish. A fish opens
and closes the flap by opening and closing its mouth. After water enters the
mouth, it’s forced over the gills and then out the back of the operculum. As
the water passes over the gills in one direction, the blood inside the gills
moves in the opposite direction. Oxygen from the water diffuses into the
capillaries in the gills, and carbon dioxide diffuses out of the capillaries in the
gills. After the oxygen is in the capillaries, it can be transported throughout
the fish’s body so all the cells can get some of the needed gas.
Because the water outside the gill and blood inside the gill are moving in
opposite directions, the exchange of gases in a fish gill is referred to as countercurrent exchange. Countercurrent exchange improves the efficiency of gas
exchange.

Tracheal exchange systems
Tracheal exchange systems are made possible by a network of tubes called
a trachea. The holes at the ends of the tubes, which open to the outside surface, are called spiracles. You can find this system in insects.
The trachea found in insects is different from the trachea found in your body.
In insects, the trachea is the network of tubes that runs through the entire
body and opens to the air; in humans, the trachea is a tube that carries air
down into the lungs.

223

224

Part IV: Systems Galore! Animal Structure and Function
In a tracheal exchange system, oxygen diffuses directly into the trachea, and
carbon dioxide exits through the spiracles. The cells of the body exchange
air directly with the tracheal system, and the oxygen and carbon dioxide
don’t need to be carried through a circulatory system because the tracheal
system runs through all parts of the insect’s body.
Some insects, such as bees and grasshoppers, combine a breathing process
with a tracheal exchange system. They contract muscles to pump air in and
out of their tracheal systems. A grasshopper even has air sacs on some of the
air tubes in its tracheal system. The bags “pump” like fireplace bellows after
pressure from muscles is applied.

Lungs
Lungs are the opposite of gills (which we describe earlier in this chapter).
Gills extend out off of an organism, and lungs are internal growths of the
surface of the body. Animals’ lungs are housed inside their bodies in order
to keep them moist. They basically work by providing lots of moist surface
area for the diffusion of oxygen and carbon dioxide. Lungs may be different
shapes and sizes in various land animals, but they function essentially the
same as they do in humans. We use humans as the model for the mechanics
of the lungs in order to give you a better understanding of how your body
works.
Humans have a pair of lungs that lie in the chest cavity (as shown in Figure
15-1); one lung is on the left side of the trachea (the tube that connects the
nose and mouth to the lungs), and the other is on the right side of it. Inside the
lungs, the trachea branches off into bronchi (small passageways that move air
into the lungs), which then branch and rebranch off into smaller bronchioles
(smaller versions of bronchi). The bronchioles end in little clusters of sacs
called alveoli (tiny, moist sacs where gas exchange occurs in the lungs) that
look a little bit like raspberries. Each alveolus (that’s the singular word for
alveoli) is wrapped with capillaries so that gas exchange can occur between
the lungs and the blood. The muscle found underneath the lungs is called the
diaphragm, and it’s responsible for contracting and creating negative pressure
to draw air into the lungs. A pair of ribs surrounds the chest cavity to protect
the lungs (and heart) and to assist in the motions of breathing.
Because lungs are the most complex gas-exchange system employed by animals, we break down the details for you in the following sections.

Taking a peek at what happens when you breathe
When you breathe in, called inhalation or inspiration, the diaphragm muscle
contracts (meaning it becomes smaller and moves down), allowing your
rib cage to move upward and outward. Because the lungs have more room
when your chest is expanded, they open up, similar to how a balloon blows
up when it’s filled with air. The opening up of the lungs means there’s more
room in the lungs, so air rushes in to fill the space. When your diaphragm
relaxes, your rib cage moves back downward and inward, increasing air pressure inside your lungs and forcing air out. The process of breathing out is
called exhalation or expiration.
Following is a breakdown of how oxygen passes through all the branches of
your respiratory system when your lungs fill up:
1. Oxygen enters through your nostrils and flows through the top part of
your throat.
Inside your nasal cavity, hair, cilia, and mucus trap dust and dirt particles, purifying the air that enters your lungs. Occasionally, you must
cough and either spit or swallow to move the trapped particles out of
your throat. (Don’t worry about swallowing dirt; it enters your stomach
where it’s digested and excreted.)

225

226

Part IV: Systems Galore! Animal Structure and Function
2. Oxygen then moves into the middle part of your throat and through
the space around your vocal cords.
When you eat, food passes through your throat (or pharynx) on its way
to your stomach. When you breathe, air passes through your pharynx
on its way to the lungs. So, both your mouth and your nose connect to
the pharynx. The place where your mouth connects is called the oropharynx; the place where your nose connects is called the nasopharynx.
3. Next, oxygen enters your trachea, flows through the bronchi and
bronchioles, and then flows into the alveoli.
Capillaries surround the alveoli, ready to accept oxygen and give up
carbon dioxide (see Figure 15-2). Oxygen and carbon dioxide diffuse
across the membranes of the alveoli, and the capillaries move the
freshly oxygenated blood into your circulatory system.
Gas exchange in the lungs occurs only in the alveoli.

Understanding the concept of diffusion
As explained in Chapter 4, diffusion is when a substance moves from an area
of higher concentration to an area of lower concentration. Gas exchange in
the lungs is an example of diffusion.

Chapter 15: Going with the Flow: Respiratory and Circulatory Systems
Oxygen is more concentrated within each of the 300 million alveoli in your
lungs than it is in the capillaries surrounding the alveoli. Your capillaries in
turn have a higher concentration of carbon dioxide than oxygen. The oxygen
in the alveoli diffuses across the alveoli’s membranes and the capillaries’
membranes and into the capillaries. Meanwhile, the carbon dioxide diffuses
across the capillaries’ membranes and the alveoli’s membranes into the
lungs for expulsion from your body. After oxygen is in the capillaries, your
red blood cells snatch it up and transport it throughout your body. While this
happens, your diaphragm relaxes, and the carbon dioxide waste leaves your
body as you exhale.

Circulation: Nutrients In, Garbage Out
Every animal alive possesses a circulatory system. This system makes sure
that all the animal’s cells obtain the nutrients they need to function and that
all the cells dispose of waste so it doesn’t build up within the animal’s body
and cause illness (or, yikes, death). Some of the additional responsibilities of
a circulatory system include
✓ Delivering oxygen to cells and picking up carbon dioxide
✓ Distributing hormones to cells
✓ Maintaining body temperature by transporting heat
✓ Transporting cells to fight infection (more on this in Chapter 17)
Two kinds of circulatory systems exist: open and closed. We fill you in on
both types in the next sections.

Open circulatory systems
In an open circulatory system, the animal’s heart pumps a bloodlike fluid
called hemolymph into an open cavity (called a hemocoel) through openings
in the heart called ostia. When the hemolymph flows into the hemocoel, it
directly bathes the tissues of the organism with nutrients — no blood vessels are involved. Muscle contractions push the hemolymph back toward the
heart so it can be circulated throughout the animal again and again. Insects
and some mollusks (specifically snails and clams) possess an open circulatory system.

227

228

Part IV: Systems Galore! Animal Structure and Function
In insects, hemolymph carries nutrients but not oxygen to the cells. Oxygen is
circulated via the tracheal exchange system (which we describe earlier in this
chapter).

Closed circulatory systems
A closed circulatory system is the type of circulatory system you’re most
familiar with. It has a network of vessels (think of them as highways that
connect one organ to another) that perform the transportation and keep
your blood from seeping out. In animals, each blood vessel in the network is
responsible for transporting nutrients and oxygen to the cells and removing
wastes and carbon dioxide from them.
The three types of blood vessels are
✓ Arteries
✓ Veins
✓ Capillaries
Animals with backbones, called vertebrates, possess a closed circulatory
system. Some animals without backbones, called invertebrates, also have one;
these include some worms, octopuses, and squids.
Closed circulatory systems, which are said to be closed because they have
vessels that contain the fluid, are more efficient than open circulatory systems
because they need to meet the dual demand of delivering both oxygen and
nutrients to cells.

Getting to the Heart of Simpler Animals
Hearts come in different sizes and shapes, but a heart’s function remains the
same in all organisms that have one: It pumps fluid throughout the circulatory system. That fluid is either hemolymph or blood, depending on the type
of circulatory system an animal has, and it transports either nutrients or a
combination of nutrients and oxygen to the animal’s cells.
In animals with an open circulatory system, this process occurs the same
way. However, in animals with a closed circulatory system, the process happens differently depending on how the system is set up. We give you a peek
at how the process occurs in two of the simpler animals — worms and fish —
in the sections that follow.

Chapter 15: Going with the Flow: Respiratory and Circulatory Systems

A worm’s heart and circulatory system
Although you may think earthworms are insects that possess an open circulatory system, they’re not (technically they’re annelids). These little guys and
gals have a closed circulatory system that’s a bit simpler in design than that
of a human.
Earthworms have just one dorsal (top side) blood vessel and one ventral
(bottom side) blood vessel, plus a network of capillaries. The heart of an
earthworm is a series of muscular rings near the thicker tip of the worm. It
pumps blood away from the heart through the ventral blood vessel. From
there, the blood oozes into all the capillaries to reach all the cells of the
worm before traveling back to the heart through the dorsal blood vessel.

A fish’s heart and circulatory system
A fish’s heart has two separate chambers, one that receives blood from the
body and another that pumps the blood out over the gills. Its closed circulatory system makes a single loop through the body of the fish. Overall, the
process of how blood passes through a fish is rather simple.
1. When a fish’s heart pumps, blood leaves the heart through the ventral
aorta that runs along the underside of the fish.
2. The ventral aorta carries the blood to the gills, and the blood then
passes through the capillaries along the gills to pick up oxygen.
This part of the circulatory loop is called gill circulation.
3. The oxygenated blood immediately flows from the gills into the dorsal
aorta, which runs along the upper side of the fish.
4. The dorsal aorta carries the oxygenated blood to the rest of the fish’s
capillaries.
This part of the loop is referred to as systemic circulation.
5. After the blood has reached all the cells within the fish, it returns to
the heart.
The circulatory system in a fish is simple and effective, but because the
blood passes through the heart only once during its travels, a fish’s blood
pressure is quite low. (Blood pressure is the force that sends blood through
an animal’s circulatory system.)

229

230

Part IV: Systems Galore! Animal Structure and Function

Exploring the Human Heart and
Circulatory System
The heart and circulatory system of a human, as well as some other mammals, are complex. Because these animals are larger, they need to have a
higher blood pressure to push the blood throughout their entire bodies. This
need results in a two-circuit circulatory system, a system that has two distinct
pathways (as you can see in Figure 15-3):
✓ One pathway is for pulmonary circulation, which first delivers deoxygenated blood to the lungs so it can become oxygenated and then delivers
oxygenated blood back to the heart.
✓ The other circuit is for systemic circulation, which carries oxygenated
blood from the heart to the rest of the body.

The human heart (depicted in Figure 15-4) has four chambers: two ventricles,
muscular chambers that squeeze blood out of the heart and into the blood vessels, and two atria, muscular chambers that drain and then squeeze blood into
the ventricles. The heart is divided into left and right halves, so there’s a left
atrium and a left ventricle, as well as a right atrium and a right ventricle. The
two atria reside at the top of the heart; the two ventricles are at the bottom.
Note: If Figure 15-4 seems confusing to you because it looks as if the right
atrium is on the left side of the heart, pretend you’re looking at someone’s
heart through her chest. Her right atrium is on the right side of her body,
which is how we’ve depicted it in the figure.

Your heart is divided into halves because of your two-circuit circulatory
system. The right side of your heart pumps blood to your lungs, while the left
side of your heart pumps blood to the rest of your body. Blood goes into both
pathways with each and every pump.
Valves separate one chamber of the heart from another. Each valve consists
of a pair of strong flaps of muscle tissue, called cusps or leaflets. When your
heart is working properly, the valves open and close fully so blood can flow
through it in only one direction.

231

232

Part IV: Systems Galore! Animal Structure and Function
Four valves separate the four chambers of your heart from one another and
from the major blood vessels that are connected to it (refer to Figure 15-4 for
the visual):
✓ The right atrioventricular (AV) valve is located between the right atrium
and right ventricle. This valve is also referred to as the tricuspid valve
because it has three flaps in its structure.
✓ The pulmonary semilunar valve separates the right ventricle from the pulmomary artery. Semilunar means “half-moon” and refers to the shape of the
valve.
✓ The left atrioventricular (AV) valve is between the left atrium and left
ventricle. This valve is also called the bicuspid valve because it has only
two flaps in its structure.
✓ The aortic semilunar valve separates the left ventricle from the aorta.
Like the pulmonary semilunar valve, this valve has a half-moon shape.
The sections that follow take you on a journey through the human circulatory system. You find out just how blood moves through your heart and the
rest of your body, and you discover what gets your heart beating in the first
place. Bon voyage!

The many faces of heart disease
Heart disease is the top cause of death in the
United States. Deaths from heart disease are
usually attributed to heart attacks, but heart
attacks can be caused by many factors, including the following:
✓ Atherosclerosis: Blockages in the arteries
occur when fats, especially cholesterol,
accumulate in the lining of the arteries.
Cholesterol serves a necessary function
within the body, but when too much cholesterol is present — which can be caused
by diet or by genetic factors — it starts
to stick to the vessels instead of passing
through them. These fatty deposits are
called plaques. As the plaques increase in
size, they fill more and more of the artery,
eventually affecting blood flow.
✓ Hypertension: More commonly referred
to as “high blood pressure,” hypertension
puts added stress on the arteries of the

heart, increasing the risk of damage and
fatty deposits along artery walls.
✓ Ischemic heart disease: Ischemia is a lack
of oxygen, and this type of heart disease
can occur when the arteries are partially
blocked. People with this condition have
difficulty breathing during exercise or times
of stress because the blocked arteries slow
the flow of blood, preventing enough oxygen
from being delivered to the heart muscle’s
tissues. This lack of oxygen can cause a pain
in the chest that radiates to the left arm; this
pain is called angina pectoris.
✓ Thromboembolism: If an artery is blocked
by a plaque, blood cells can stick to the
plaque, eventually forming a blood clot that
can travel through the bloodstream and
block blood vessels. A blood clot stuck in
a blood vessel is called a thrombus. If a
thrombus breaks free and moves around
the bloodstream, it’s called an embolism.

Chapter 15: Going with the Flow: Respiratory and Circulatory Systems

Entering the cardiac cycle
Your heart is an impressive little organ. Even though it’s only as big as a
clenched adult fist, it pumps 5 liters of blood (the equivalent to 21⁄2 big bottles
of soda) throughout your body 70 times a minute. Did we mention it’s a hard
worker too? Your heart never stops working from the time it starts beating
(when you were nothing but a wee little embryo in your mother’s womb)
until the moment you die. It doesn’t even get an entire second to rest. It beats
continuously every 0.8 seconds of your life; this is known as the cardiac cycle.
During the cardiac cycle, your heart forces blood into your blood vessels and
takes a quick nap. Here’s exactly what happens:
✓ The left and right atria contract.
✓ The left and right ventricles contract.
✓ The atria and ventricles rest (for just 0.4 seconds).
When the atria and ventricles are resting, the muscle fibers within them
aren’t contracting. Therefore, the relaxed atria allow the blood within them
to drain into the ventricles beneath them. With most of the blood from the
atria now in the ventricles, the atria contract to squeeze any remaining blood
down into the ventricles. Then the ventricles immediately contract to force
blood into the blood vessels.
The period of relaxation in the heart muscle is referred to as diastole, and the
period of contraction in the heart muscle is called systole. If these terms sound
familiar, it’s probably because you’ve heard them used in terms of blood
pressure.
In a blood pressure reading, such as the normal value of 120/80 mmHg, 120
is the systolic blood pressure, the pressure at which blood is forced from
the ventricles into the arteries when the ventricles contract, and 80 is the
diastolic blood pressure, the pressure in the blood vessels when the muscle
fibers are relaxed. The abbreviation mmHg stands for millimeters of mercury
(Hg is the chemical symbol for mercury).
If your blood pressure is 140/90 mmHg, which is the borderline value between
normal and high blood pressure, that means your heart is working harder to
pump blood through your body and not relaxing as well between pumps. This
reading indicates that something is causing your heart to have to work at a
much higher level all the time to keep blood flowing through your body, which
stresses it out. The culprit could be a hormonal imbalance, a dietary problem
(too much sodium or caffeine), a mechanical problem in the heart, a side
effect of medication, or blockages in your blood vessels.

Navigating the path of blood
through the body
The cardiac cycle, which describes the rhythmic contraction and relaxation
of the heart muscle (see the preceding section), coincides with the path of
blood through your body. As each atrium and ventricle contracts, blood is
pumped into certain major blood vessels that connect to your heart and then
continues flowing throughout your circulatory system. In other words, here’s
where your two-circuit circulatory system really comes into play.
The following sections describe the process of pulmonary and systemic circulation, as well as the process of capillary exchange (which gets nutrients
into and wastes out of your cells).

Oxygenating the blood: Pulmonary circulation
Pulmonary circulation, the first pathway of your two-circuit circulatory
system, brings blood to your lungs for oxygenation. Following is a rundown
of how blood moves during pulmonary circulation (trace the path in Figure
15-4 as you read):
1. Deoxygenated blood from your body enters the right atrium of your
heart through the superior vena cava and the inferior vena cava.
Superior means “higher,” and inferior means “lower,” so the superior
vena cava is at the top of the right atrium, and the inferior vena cava is
at the bottom of the right atrium.
2. From the right atrium, the deoxygenated blood drains into the right
ventricle through the right AV valve.
When the ventricles contract, the right AV valve closes off the opening
between the ventricle and the atrium so blood doesn’t flow back up into
the atrium.
3. The right ventricle then contracts, forcing the deoxygenated blood
through the pulmonary semilunar valve and into the pulmonary
artery.
The pulmonary semilunar valve keeps blood from flowing back into the
right ventricle after it’s in the pulmonary artery.
4. The pulmonary artery carries the blood that’s very low in oxygen to
the lungs, where it becomes oxygenated.

Chapter 15: Going with the Flow: Respiratory and Circulatory Systems
Spreading oxygenated blood around: Systemic circulation
Systemic circulation brings oxygenated blood to the cells of your body. Here’s
how blood moves through this pathway (you can follow along by tracing the
path in Figure 15-4):
1. Freshly oxygenated blood returns from the lungs to the heart via the
pulmonary veins.
Note that your pulmonary veins are the only veins in your body that
contain oxygenated blood; all of your other veins contain deoxygenated
blood.
2. The pulmonary veins push the oxygenated blood into the left atrium,
which then relaxes, allowing the blood to drain into the left ventricle
through the left AV valve.
3. As the left ventricle contracts, the oxygenated blood is pumped into
the main artery of the body — the aorta.
To get to the aorta, blood passes through the aortic semilunar valve,
which serves to keep blood in the aorta from flowing back into the left
ventricle.
4. The aorta branches into other arteries, which then branch into
smaller arterioles, carrying oxygenated blood all around your body.
Throughout your body, arterioles meet up with capillaries where oxygen
is exchanged for carbon dioxide.
The blood vessels in order of decreasing oxygen content are as follows:
✓ Arteries
✓ Arterioles
✓ Capillaries
✓ Venules
✓ Veins

Exchanging the good and the bad: Capillary exchange
For being the teeniest of blood vessels, capillaries, which bridge the smallest of
the arteries and the smallest of the veins, have a rather important role: to facilitate the exchange of materials between capillaries and cells via diffusion — in
other words, to make capillary exchange possible.
Your capillaries are only as thick as one cell, so the contents within them can
easily exit by diffusing through the capillaries’ membranes (see Chapter 4 for
more on diffusion). And, because the capillaries’ membranes touch the membranes of other cells all over the body, the capillaries’ contents can easily
continue moving through adjacent cells’ membranes.

235

236

Part IV: Systems Galore! Animal Structure and Function
Through capillary exchange, oxygen leaves red blood cells in the bloodstream
and enters all the other cells of the body. Capillary exchange also allows nutrients to diffuse out of the bloodstream and into other cells. At the same time,
the other cells expel waste products, including carbon dioxide, that then enter
the capillaries.
After the capillaries “pick up” the garbage from other cells, they carry the
wastes and carbon dioxide through the deoxygenated blood to the smallest
of the veins, which are called venules. The venules branch into bigger vessels
called veins, which then carry the deoxygenated blood toward the main vein —
the vena cava. The two branches of the vena cava enter the right atrium, which
is where pulmonary circulation begins.
The pressure created when the ventricles contract is what forces blood
through the arteries. However, this pressure declines as the blood gets farther away from the heart and into the capillaries. Blood pressure doesn’t
force blood through the veins as it does through the arteries. What makes
blood travel through the veins are contractions of your skeletal muscles.
As your limbs and trunk move, deoxygenated blood is pushed farther along
the venules and veins, eventually returning to the heart. Without movement,
blood pools in the veins, creating poor circulation.

Seeing what makes your ticker tick
Electrical impulses from your heart muscle cause your heart to beat. These
impulses begin in special areas of tissue within the heart, called nodes, that
are infused with nerves. The nodes send out signals that stimulate contraction of the heart muscle cells, causing your heart to beat. For particulars on
the process, check out the following:
1. Each beat of your heart is started by an electrical signal from the sinoatrial (SA) node in your right atrium.
The SA node is also called your natural pacemaker because it sets the
pace of your heartbeats. (Yes, your heart already contains a pacemaker.
People who have pacemakers “installed” through surgery have it done
because their natural pacemaker has stopped working correctly.)
2. The signal from the SA node spreads across the left and right atria,
causing them to contract and push the blood into the ventricles.
3. As the electrical impulse passes through the atria, it signals the atrioventricular (AV) node to take action.
The AV node is located in the lower part of the right atrium. The signal
is temporarily slowed in this node so that your ventricles have time to
fill with blood.
4. The signal in the AV node stimulates an area of tissue called the
bundle of His.

Chapter 15: Going with the Flow: Respiratory and Circulatory Systems
The bundle of His lies between the right and left ventricles and connects
with specialized fibers called Purkinje fibers.
5. When the impulse reaches the Purkinje fibers, it causes the ventricles
to contract, completing the heartbeat.
The sound your heart makes — described as lub-dub, lub-dub — is attributed
to the closing of the heart’s valves. The first heart sound, the lub, is caused by
AV valves closing to prevent backflow from the ventricles into the atria. The
second heart sound, the dub, occurs when the semilunar valves close to keep
blood in the aorta from flowing back into the left ventricle.

A Bloody-Important Fluid
Blood is the fluid that sustains life in animals with a closed circulatory
system — including you. Some blood cells carry oxygen, which is necessary
for metabolic reactions; some blood cells fight off invading substances that
could destroy your cells; and other blood cells help form clots, which keep
your body from losing too much of this precious fluid and assist with wound
healing. The following sections introduce you to the elements that make up
your blood and the special process that keeps you from losing too much
blood when you cut yourself.

The solids found in your essential fluid
Believe it or not, your blood, although it’s a fluid, contains solid parts called
formed elements. These solid parts are your red blood cells, white blood
cells, and platelets. You can find out more about all three in the sections that
follow.
Note: We use the word solid simply to differentiate platelets and blood cells
from the liquid portion of blood. Platelets and blood cells definitely aren’t
hard and solid. If they were, they wouldn’t be able to squeeze through your
capillaries.

Red blood cells
Your red blood cells, which are also called erythrocytes, have the important
responsibility of carrying oxygen throughout your body. Hemoglobin, the
iron-containing molecule that harnesses oxygen, exists in the red blood
cells. It not only binds oxygen and transports it to capillaries but it also
helps transport carbon dioxide from the capillaries back to the lungs to be
exhaled. By transporting oxygen and hemoglobin, your red blood cells are an
extremely important part of homeostasis — how your body tries to constantly
achieve and maintain balance.

237

238

Part IV: Systems Galore! Animal Structure and Function
If a person has too few red blood cells, as determined by a lab test that measures red blood cell count, or if her red blood cells don’t have enough hemoglobin, she has anemia, a disease characterized by too few red blood cells or
a hemoglobin deficiency that often leads to feelings of fatigue. Anemia can be
caused by dietary deficiencies, metabolic disorders, hereditary conditions, or
damaged bone marrow.
Red blood cells are created in the red bone marrow. They live about 120
days shuttling oxygen and carbon dioxide, and then certain white blood cells
destroy them in the liver and spleen. As the red blood cells are destroyed, the
iron they contain is recycled back to the red bone marrow to be used in new
cells. The rest of the material in the old red blood cells is degraded and transported to the digestive system, where much of it ends up in fecal matter.

White blood cells
Your white blood cells, which are also called leukocytes, are involved in functions controlled by your immune system, which is responsible for fighting
infections (head to Chapter 17 for details on the immune system). If a person
has a low white blood cell count, her immune system isn’t functioning properly. If her white blood cell count is too high, that indicates she has some
type of infection.
Following are the five important types of white blood cells you should know:
✓ Basophils release histamines, those annoying little chemical molecules
that cause you to swell up with hives, itch like crazy, sneeze, wheeze,
and get teary-eyed when you’re around something you’re allergic to.
All of these reactions are side effects of inflammation, a very important
defensive process that helps you clear damaging agents out of your
body.
✓ Eosinophils help defend the body against invading organisms, particularly parasitic worms.
✓ Lymphocytes are key players in your adaptive immune response, the
response your body makes to defend you against invading microbes.
Two of their important functions are to destroy virally infected cells and
to make defensive proteins called antibodies.
✓ Monocytes are precursors to macrophages. Macrophages digest bacteria
and viruses (macro- means “big,” and phago means “to eat,” so a macrophage is literally a big eater).
✓ Neutrophils are the most abundant white blood cells in the body. These
cells eat bacteria; in doing so, they keep your system from being overrun by every germ with which it comes in contact.

Chapter 15: Going with the Flow: Respiratory and Circulatory Systems
Platelets
Platelets, which are also called thrombocytes, are pieces of cells that work
to form blood clots (we detail the clotting process later in this chapter).
Platelets form when pieces are torn off of cells called megakaryocytes.
Because they’re just cell fragments, platelets are smaller than red or white
blood cells. They survive in the blood for about ten days.
The number of platelets in the blood is often determined as part of a complete blood count. Low numbers of platelets can indicate certain cancers and
chronic bleeding disorders. Increased numbers of platelets may be a sign of
chronic infection or certain blood diseases.

The plasma “stream” in your bloodstream
The liquid portion of your blood is plasma. Your blood cells and platelets
flow in your plasma much like leaves float in a stream. In fact, when you think
about it, plasma literally puts the “stream” in bloodstream.
Plasma contains many important proteins, without which you’d die. Two
major proteins found in plasma are
✓ Gamma globulin: Also called immunoglobulin, gamma globulin is a broad
term for a class of defensive proteins that make up the different types of
antibodies. The production of antibodies, which help to fight infections,
is controlled by your immune system (as explained in Chapter 17).
✓ Fibrinogen: This protein is involved in blood clotting.

How blood clots form
When you cut your finger chopping an onion or picking up a piece of broken
glass, your body embarks on a mission to form a blood clot (a semisolid plug
made of blood cells trapped in a protein mesh) to prevent you from bleeding
to death. First, the injured blood vessel constricts, reducing blood flow to the
injured blood vessel, which helps limit blood loss. (Tourniquets help squeeze
off blood flow in much the same way when major blood vessels are damaged.) With the injured blood vessel constricted, the platelets present in the
blood that’s passing through that vessel start to stick to the collagen fibers
that are part of the blood vessel wall. Eventually, a platelet plug forms, and it
fills small tears in the blood vessel.

239

240

Part IV: Systems Galore! Animal Structure and Function
After the platelet plug is formed, enzymes called clotting factors (your body
has 12 of them) initiate a chain of reactions to create a clot. The process is
rather complex, but you don’t need to know all the nitty-gritty details; just
focus on these highlights:
✓ After a platelet plug forms, the coagulation phase begins, which involves
a cascade of enzyme activations that lead to the conversion of inactive
prothrombin to active thrombin. (Calcium is required for this reaction
to occur.)
✓ Thrombin itself acts as an enzyme and causes fibrinogen — one of the
two major plasma proteins — to form long fibrin threads.
✓ Fibrin threads entwine the platelet plug, forming a meshlike framework.
✓ The fibrin framework traps red blood cells that flow toward it, forming a
clot. (Note: Because red blood cells are tangled in the meshwork, clots
appear to be red. As the red blood cells trapped on the outside dry out,
the color turns a brownish red, and a scab forms.)

A

fter an animal ingests or absorbs food, its digestive system immediately
starts breaking down the food to release the nutrients within it. After
the useful nutrients are absorbed into the bloodstream, the animal eliminates
solid wastes through its large intestine and nitrogenous wastes through its
urinary system.
Want to know more about the ins and outs of digestive and excretory systems?
Then you’re in the right place. In this chapter, we give you the lowdown on
the various ways animals obtain food and eliminate wastes. We then present
the workings of the human digestive system and the fate of food and wastes in
your body. After all, everyone should know the scoop on their poop.

Obtaining Food and Breaking It Down
All animals need food as a source of energy and materials for growth (as
explained in Chapter 5), but the various types of animals have different strategies for obtaining the food they need.
✓ Bulk feeders take big bites out of food. They use teeth, claws, tentacles,
or pinchers to tear off pieces of food and ingest them. Eagles, people,
frogs, and snakes are all examples of bulk feeders.

242

Part IV: Systems Galore! Animal Structure and Function
✓ Filter feeders strain liquids to capture tiny particles suspended in
the fluid. They have structures such as gills or very fine tentacles that
trap small particles out of the water. Clams, for example, pull seawater
through their bodies and pass it over their mucus-covered gills, trapping the small organisms and organic matter that were suspended in the
water. Other examples of filter feeders include sponges, whale sharks,
and gray whales.
✓ Fluid feeders suck nutrient-rich fluids from other organisms. They’re
often parasites that live inside a host and use the host’s fluids as a
source of food. Aphids and mosquitoes, for example, puncture other
organisms and draw fluid from them — aphids draw the sugary sap out
of plants, and mosquitoes draw blood out of animals. Ticks, leeches, and
lampreys are some additional fluid feeders you may be familiar with.
✓ Substrate feeders live right in or on their food and eat as they move
through it. Despite its complex name, this type of animal obtains its
food pretty simply. Just think of earthworms and maggots. As earthworms burrow through the soil, they ingest the soil, digest the small
organisms and organic matter within it as it passes through them, and
then release the undigested matter as worm casings out their back ends.
Similarly, when flies lay their eggs in bodies, the maggots that hatch out
of the eggs eat their way through the food (the decomposing organism)
until they reach the outside.
Four main events occur from the moment food enters an animal’s body until
the time its wastes are released:
✓ Ingestion occurs when an animal takes food into its digestive tract.
✓ Digestion occurs when the animal’s body gets busy breaking down the
food. Two types of digestion exist:
• Mechanical digestion physically breaks down food into smaller
and smaller pieces. It begins when an animal consumes the food
and continues until the food enters its stomach.
• Chemical digestion uses enzymes and acids to break down
chewed or ground-up food into even smaller pieces. It also begins
as soon as food is consumed and the enzymes in the mouth go to
work. Chemical digestion continues as the food moves through the
stomach and small intestine and encounters enzymes and acids in
the stomach and enzymes in the small intestine.
✓ Absorption occurs when cells within the animal move small food molecules from the digestive system to the insides of the cells.
✓ Elimination occurs when material that can’t be digested passes out of
an animal’s digestive tract.

Chapter 16: Checking Out the Plumbing: Animal Digestive & Excretory Systems

The Ins and Outs of Digestive Systems
The basic way an animal’s digestive system works has a great deal to do with
whether it can spend a few hours between meals or whether it has to keep
consuming food constantly just to stay alive. The following sections take a
look at the two types of digestive systems and help you distinguish between
animals that need to take in food all the time and those that don’t.

Incomplete versus complete
digestive tracts
Of the animals that you can see without a microscope, the ones with the
most primitive digestive system are animals with incomplete digestive tracts,
meaning they have a gut with just one opening that serves as both mouth and
anus. (Gross, we know.) Jellyfish are a classic example of an animal with an
incomplete digestive tract.
Increasing in complexity are animals that have gut tubes (where foods are
digested and nutrients are absorbed) with a mouth at one end and an anus
at the other. Although simple, this type of system is considered a complete
digestive tract. You’re probably quite familiar with one particular animal that
possesses this digestive system — you.
The benefit of a complete digestive tract is that it allows thorough digestion before excretion occurs. Organisms with incomplete digestive tracts
release undigested food along with their wastes. An organism with a complete
digestive tract doesn’t have to take in food constantly to replace food that’s
excreted before the nutrients could be acquired from it.

Continuous versus discontinuous feeders
Animals that must “eat” constantly because they take food in and then push
it out soon afterward are called continuous feeders. Most of these animals
are either permanently attached to something (think clams or mussels) or
incredibly slow movers. Animals that are discontinuous feeders consume
larger meals and store the ingested food for later digestion. These animals
are generally more active and somewhat nomadic.
The ability to “eat and run” serves a preying carnivore well. If an animal such
as a lion were a continuous feeder that had to hunt and eat constantly, it’d be
exhausted and spend much more time out in the open savanna, increasing the
chance that it could become prey for another predator.

243

244

Part IV: Systems Galore! Animal Structure and Function
Although you may find yourself snacking and grazing constantly throughout a
day, you’re really a discontinuous feeder. You can consume food rapidly, but
you digest it gradually so you don’t have to eat again for several hours.
You and all the other animals that are discontinuous feeders must have a place in
the body to store food as it slowly digests. In humans, this organ is the stomach.

Traveling through the Human
Digestive System
You know that the mouth is where you put your food, but did you realize it’s also
part of your digestive system (see Figure 16-1)? Well, it is. The act of chewing (the
technical term for it is mastication) is the first step in food digestion for humans.
Chewed-up food travels from your mouth, down your esophagus, and into your
stomach. From your stomach, it passes into the small intestine. Materials that
can’t be digested and absorbed move into the large intestine and then pass out of
your body through your rectum and anus. In the sections that follow, we fill you in
on the role that each of these parts of the digestive system plays in digestion.

The busiest stop of all — your mouth
Your mouth does more than let you shout at the television during sporting
events or talk to that cute guy or gal sitting next to you in biology class. It
also kicks off the entire process of digestion. And don’t think your teeth are
the only participants in this process just because they mash your food into
smaller and smaller bits. Your whole mouth gets a piece of the pie, so to
speak. In addition to what your teeth do, your
✓ Taste buds detect the nutrients that make up the food you’re eating —
such as carbohydrates, proteins, and fats — so the cells of your digestive
system can release the right enzymes to chemically digest your food.
✓ Saliva starts chemically digesting your food thanks to salivary amylase,
an enzyme found within saliva that splits apart the bonds between glucose molecules in a long chain of starch.
You know how you salivate just before you’re about to eat something?
That’s the effect of your eyes or nose sensing something delicious and
sending a message to your brain that you’re about to open your mouth
and take a bite. It’s also your mouth’s way of preparing for digestion by
producing saliva containing salivary amylase.
After your teeth have chewed, your taste buds have sent along the information about what you’re eating, and the enzymes in your saliva have started
breaking apart starches, you’re ready to swallow. This action involves your
tongue pushing the chewed food to the back of your throat and you squeezing food down your esophagus and into your stomach. (The esophagus is the
tube that connects your mouth to your stomach.)
The squeezing of food through a hollow muscular structure is called peristalsis,
and it occurs throughout the digestive system to move food down the esophagus and into the stomach and then again to move food through the intestines.
When the swallowed food drops into your stomach, it’s referred to as a bolus.
At this point, salivary amylase stops breaking apart the starch molecules,
and the gastric juice in your stomach, which contains enzymes as well as
hydrochloric acid (HCl), takes over chemical digestion.
If you eat too much, your stomach produces more acid, and the contents of
your overly full stomach can be forced back up into your esophagus, which
runs in front of the heart. The unpleasant result? Heartburn.

The inner workings of your stomach
When food particles reach your stomach, the organ churns them up, and the
enzyme pepsin starts breaking down the food’s proteins into smaller chains

245

246

Part IV: Systems Galore! Animal Structure and Function
of amino acids (see Chapter 4 for more on enzymes). Then the whole goopy
substance gets squirted into the top of your intestines via the pyloric valve,
otherwise known as the gate between your stomach and small intestine. Your
pyloric sphincter muscle occasionally opens the valve, allowing your stomach’s contents into your small intestine a little bit at a time.
Perhaps you’re wondering why pepsin doesn’t destroy the proteins that make
up the tissues in your digestive tract. Well, when pepsin is secreted, it’s in its
inactive form, called pepsinogen. Because pepsinogen is inactive, it doesn’t
damage the cells that make it. When it’s in the cavity of the stomach, pepsinogen gets converted to its active form, pepsin, by losing a few dozen of its
amino acids. The lining of the stomach isn’t affected by pepsin because pepsin
acts only on proteins, and the stomach is covered with mucus (a substance
made from fats) that protects the protein-containing tissues — that is, unless
you have a stomach ulcer (see the related sidebar nearby for more on stomach ulcers).

The long and winding road
of your small intestine
When food molecules hit your small intestine, they get broken down into
even smaller units (so your cells can absorb them) with a little help from
your liver and pancreas.

The true cause of stomach ulcers
When the lining of the stomach is eroded by
digestive enzymes and stomach acid, the resulting condition is referred to as a stomach ulcer. For
years the medical community thought stomach
ulcers were largely caused by stress, worry, frustration, and other negative emotions. That belief
changed in 1982 when two Australian doctors,
Barry Marshall and Robin Warren, detected a
bacterium called Helicobacter pylori (or H. pylori)
in the stomachs of people with ulcers. They proposed that H. pylori in fact caused the ulcers, but
no one believed them. To prove their point, Dr.
Marshall, who didn’t have any stomach ulcers,
did the unthinkable — he drank a culture of live
H. pylori! After drinking the culture, Dr. Marshall

developed ulcers, proving that infection with the
bacterium could indeed cause stomach ulcers.
So just how does a stomach ulcer form? Well,
H. pylori inflames the lining of the stomach,
causing the organ’s protective mucus to disappear and allowing the enzymes and stomach
acids secreted during digestion to eat away at
the proteins in the tissue of the stomach wall.
Stomach ulcers can be painful, and if they bleed
or cause a hole (or perforation) through the wall
of the stomach, they can become a medical
emergency. Fortunately, antibiotic therapy can
often successfully treat the condition by removing the H. pylori bacteria from the stomach.

Chapter 16: Checking Out the Plumbing: Animal Digestive & Excretory Systems
The liver secretes bile (a yellow-brown or greenish fluid) into the small intestine. Bile salts emulsify (suspend in water) fats, helping them mix into the
liquid in the intestine so they can be digested more easily. Meanwhile, the
pancreas releases pancreatic juice into the mixture that contains the following enzymes to help chemically digest fats and carbohydrates:
✓ Lipase breaks apart fat molecules into fatty acids and glycerol.
✓ Pancreatic amylase breaks long carbohydrates into disaccharides, which
are short chains of two sugars. The disaccharidases then break apart
into monosaccharides that can be absorbed by the cells lining your
small intestine.
✓ Trypsin and chymotrypsin are enzymes that break apart peptide fragments. After they break the peptides down into small chains, aminopeptidases finish them off by breaking apart the peptides into individual,
absorbable amino acids.
Just like pepsin in the stomach, trypsin and chymotrypsin are originally
secreted in their inactive forms, trypsinogen and chymotrypsinogen. To
protect the cells of your digestive system, the enzymes aren’t activated
until they reach the cavity of your small intestine.
Don’t let the word small fool you. The small intestine is much longer than the
large intestine (10 feet long versus 5 feet long). The term small intestine refers
to the fact that this part of the intestine is narrower in diameter than the large
intestine; the large intestine is wider in diameter but shorter in length.
After several hours in your digestive system, the carbohydrates, fats, and
proteins from your food are all in their smallest components: monosaccharides (such as glucose), fatty acids and glycerol, and amino acids (see
Chapter 3 for details on these molecules). Now they can leave your digestive
system in order to be used by all the cells in your body (as explained in the
next section).

Absorbing the Stuff Your Body Needs
During the digestion process, the nutrients your body can use are absorbed
into the cells lining your small intestine. The rest of the material that can’t be
further digested or used passes on to the large intestine. The next sections
outline how nutrients move throughout your system and how your liver constantly works to make sure you have the right amount of blood glucose (blood
sugar) necessary to keep you going.

How nutrients travel through your body
If digestion is all about obtaining the nutrients your cells need to function,
then how exactly do those nutrients get out of your digestive system and into
the rest of your body?
First, they pass directly into the cells of your small intestine via active transport. In other words, energy obtained from adenosine triphosphate (ATP)
molecules is expended to move sugars (which came from consumed carbohydrates) and amino acids (which came from consumed proteins) into the
intestinal cells (see Chapter 4 for the full scoop on active transport). From
there, the nutrients are able to participate in capillary exchange, a type of
trading system that allows cells to exchange nutrients and waste.
Capillary exchange relies on two things: capillaries, teeny-tiny blood vessels
with extremely thin walls, and interstitial fluid, the fluid that fills every space
between every cell in your body, cushioning and hydrating the cells.
Did you know that 60 percent of a human’s body weight is from fluid? Of that
60 percent, 20 percent is extracellular fluid, fluid that exists outside the cells.
This extracellular fluid is made up mostly of interstitial fluid (16 percent) and
plasma (4 percent; we fill you in on plasma in Chapter 15). The remaining 40
percent of fluid in your body is intracellular fluid, fluid that exists inside the
cells of your body; it’s called cytoplasm.
The nutrients gained from digested food diffuse through the walls of your
small intestine, through the capillaries’ walls, across the interstitial fluid, and
into your cells. At the same time, waste produced by your cells’ metabolic
processes diffuses out of the cells, across the interstitial fluid, and into the
capillaries, where it can be carried to your kidneys for excretion. (To discover how your kidneys remove wastes from your body, head to the later
related section in this chapter.)
Although the sugars and amino acids inside the capillaries get shuttled through
the bloodstream to the liver, the products of fat digestion have a different fate.
They get coated with proteins and acquire a new name: chylomicrons. Instead
of being carried through the bloodstream, the chylomicrons get transported
through the lymph system, which deposits lymph fluid into veins near the heart.

Glucose regulation
Perhaps the most important stop digested sugars make as they travel through
your bloodstream is your liver. The liver can detect abnormalities in the levels
of various substances in your blood, such as glucose, and correct them.

Chapter 16: Checking Out the Plumbing: Animal Digestive & Excretory Systems
✓ If the level of glucose is too high (a condition called hyperglycemia), the
liver removes some of the glucose from the blood and turns it into the
storage polysaccharide glycogen. If excess glucose is still in the blood
after the liver has made enough glycogen, the liver switches its metabolic process to storing the extra glucose as fat. The fat molecules are
then carried away by your bloodstream and deposited around your
body in your adipose tissue (fat).
✓ If the level of glucose in the blood is too low (a condition called hypoglycemia), the liver converts some of its stored glycogen back into glucose
and puts the glucose into the blood. If all the glycogen stores are used up,
the liver starts to break down stored fats to obtain glucose for your cells.
Having just the right amount of glucose in your bloodstream is essential
because glucose is your brain’s main source of fuel. Glucose is so important,
in fact, that your body will literally digest itself in order to get glucose to your
brain. In extreme cases, such as starvation, when the breakdown of glycogen and fat isn’t enough to restore blood glucose to normal levels, the body
starts breaking down proteins to get the energy molecules it so desperately
needs. Proteins in the muscles are broken down into amino acids, which can
be converted into glucose. This may not sound so bad until you realize that
the heart is a muscle. When your body starts breaking down proteins in your
heart, death is a serious possibility.

What’s for Dinner? Making Wise,
Nutritious Food Choices
It’s a shame humans have such sensitive taste buds. If you didn’t have such
an evolved sense of taste, maybe you’d be like other animals and just eat
what’s part of your natural diet only when you’re truly hungry. But, alas, food
tastes good, and humans are often tempted to put really cheap fuel in their
systems. Would you do that to your car on a regular basis? Or would you
rather use the premium stuff to make sure your car’s engine doesn’t knock
and ping?
If you want to keep your bodily systems from knocking and pinging, we
strongly encourage you to follow the nutrition recommendations made
by the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA). Its MyPyramid, an
updated version of the classic Food Guide Pyramid, serves as a way of visualizing the proportion of items from different food groups that should make up
your diet. More detailed information, such as the difference between whole
grains and refined carbohydrates in the bread, cereal, and pasta group, are
available on the USDA’s MyPyramid Web site at www.mypyramid.gov.

250

Part IV: Systems Galore! Animal Structure and Function
For now, why not check out the following sections? They provide the basic
facts about the essential nutrients your body needs: carbohydrates, proteins,
fats, and minerals and vitamins.

Carbohydrates: The culprits
of your food cravings
Carbohydrates are compounds of carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen that supply
your body with short-term energy (we cover the chemical structure of carbs
in greater detail in Chapter 3). Carbohydrate molecules, such as sugars,
break down quickly. You’ve witnessed this yourself if you’ve ever held a
marshmallow over a campfire too long.
Glucose is the most important carbohydrate molecule. You can acquire it
directly from foods containing carbohydrates (such as breads, pastas, sweets,
and fruits). However, your body also creates glucose when it breaks down
proteins and fats.
When it comes to your diet, all carbohydrates are not created equal.
✓ Foods made with whole grains are high in fiber and vitamins. They help
prevent heart disease and constipation. Eating breads and cereals made
with whole grains, as well as the grains themselves (think brown rice,
quinoa, and bulgur wheat), is a way to get plenty of good carbs in your diet.
Lots of products advertise that they’re “made with whole grains,” but
that assertion doesn’t tell you what the proportion of whole grains in
the food actually is. When in doubt, check the fiber content of the food.
Foods that are high in fiber are made with lots of whole grains.
✓ Foods made with refined grains are low in fiber and vitamins. They break
down very quickly and cause a rapid rise in blood glucose. White bread,
flour, and pasta — as well as cookies, cakes, and scones — are made with
refined grains. It’s best to avoid these types of carbs as much as you can.

Proteins: You break down their
chains; they build yours
Every muscle, cell membrane, and enzyme in your body is made from proteins. So, to create more muscle fibers, new cells, and other elements that
help your body run, you need to take in protein (to get an idea of a protein’s
chemical structure, see Chapter 3).

Chapter 16: Checking Out the Plumbing: Animal Digestive & Excretory Systems
Proteins are made from amino acids. Your body requires nine amino acids
in particular to construct proteins, which is why those nine amino acids
are referred to as essential amino acids (we list them for you in Table 16-1).
Humans can synthesize 11 amino acids from a variety of starting compounds
that aren’t necessarily derived from amino acids themselves. Because these
amino acids are made in the body, they’re considered nonessential amino
acids; it’s not essential that you consume foods containing them because you
can get them another way. We list nonessential amino acids in Table 16-1 too.

When you think of protein sources, you probably think of meat. There’s a
good reason for that. Both your muscles and the muscles of other animals
are made from protein. When you eat meat — whether it’s beef, chicken,
turkey, pork, or fish — you’re consuming the protein-containing muscle
tissue of another animal.
Beans, nuts, and soy are additional sources of protein, but the protein they
contain is plant protein, not animal protein. Plant proteins are considered
incomplete because they don’t contain enough of some of the amino acids
humans need. Because animals acquire essential amino acids plus make their
own nonessential amino acids, animal protein is considered complete — it
has all the amino acids humans need.
Vegetarians must combine certain foods to make sure they’re getting all the
necessary amino acids.

251

252

Fats: You need some, but don’t overdo it
Your body needs fats to make tissues and hormones and insulate your nerves
(just like a rubber coating often insulates wires). Fat is also a source of stored
energy. It gives your body shape, reduces heat loss by insulating your organs
and muscles, and cushions your body and organs (much like shock absorbers).
Fat supplies long-term energy, which is why you don’t start to “burn fat” until
20 minutes or more into an aerobic workout. First, your body quickly burns off
the glucose that’s readily available in your cells. Then it starts breaking down
fat molecules and converting them into glucose for fuel.

Lipoproteins and your risk for heart disease
Lipoproteins are compounds made from a fat
and a protein. Their job is to carry cholesterol
around your body through the bloodstream.
You’re capable of producing four types of lipoproteins:
✓ High-density lipoproteins (HDLs)
✓ Low-density lipoproteins (LDLs)
✓ Very low-density lipoproteins (VLDLs)
✓ Chylomicrons
Sometimes in the news you read or hear about
HDL being “good” cholesterol and LDL being
“bad” cholesterol. However, HDL and LDL are
lipoproteins, not cholesterol molecules. They
just attach to and transport cholesterol. Here’s
what’s “good” and “bad” about the lipoproteins.
Chylomicrons are very small, newly created
lipoproteins that fall into the VLDL category.
VLDLs have very little protein and a lot of fat.
As VLDLs travel through your bloodstream,
they lose some lipids, pick up cholesterol, and
become LDLs. The LDLs deliver the cholesterol
to cells in your body that need it, but along the

way, VLDLs and LDLs can squeeze through
blood vessel walls. While doing that, the cholesterol can get stuck to the wall of the blood
vessel, causing deposits called plaque to form.
If enough cholesterol gets stuck, an artery
may get clogged, which means blood can’t
flow through. If that happens, a heart attack or
stroke may occur. So, although LDLs help the
body by transporting cholesterol, if you have
too many of them, the cholesterol may start to
block your blood vessels, increasing your risk of
heart disease, heart attack, and stroke.
HDLs, on the other hand, are the lipoproteins
that contain more protein than lipid, which
makes them denser and gives them their name.
Because they’re so dense, HDLs can’t squeeze
through the blood vessel walls. Instead, they
shuttle cholesterol right out of the body. They
aren’t able to deposit cholesterol in blood vessels because they can’t get into them, so they
don’t increase your risk of heart disease, heart
attack, or stroke. Remember: You always want
to have more of these dense little guys floating
in your blood than LDLs or VLDLs.

Chapter 16: Checking Out the Plumbing: Animal Digestive & Excretory Systems
Although fats are important nutrients for your body, good and bad kinds exist.
✓ Unsaturated fats are good for you. Plant oils, such as olive and flaxseed,
are excellent sources of unsaturated fats, as are fish oils.
✓ Saturated fats are unhealthy. Animal fat, like the fat on meat, and the fat
found in butter are saturated fats.
Contrary to popular belief, fat doesn’t make people fat. Consuming more fuel
than you burn leads to the production and deposit of fatty tissue, whether
that fuel comes from fats, proteins, or carbohydrates.

Minerals and vitamins: The fuel
for your enzymes
In addition to carbohydrates, proteins, and fats, your body needs certain
minerals and vitamins to help your enzymes function (see Chapter 4 for more
on enzymes).
Minerals are inorganic molecules that are part of the Earth (think iron, zinc,
and calcium). Your body doesn’t need a ton of minerals to stay healthy, but
some are essential for its proper functioning. The essential minerals are
called major minerals, and the minerals that you need only in very small
amounts are called trace elements. Table 16-2 lists all the major minerals and
trace elements your body needs.

Part IV: Systems Galore! Animal Structure and Function
Vitamins are organic molecules that exist naturally in all living things. They’re
made up of the same carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, and nitrogen atoms as carbohydrates, proteins, and fats are. Any given vitamin falls into one of two
categories:
✓ Fat-soluble: These vitamins (which include vitamins A, D, E, and K) need
to be “dissolved” in fat molecules (or phospholipids) so that cells can
use them. The phospholipids carry the “dissolved” vitamins through the
bloodstream and into your cells.
✓ Water-soluble: These vitamins (which include vitamin C and all the B
vitamins) often act with enzymes to speed up reactions.

Exploring the Human Excretory System
When the human body breaks down food, it uses as many of the nutrients
as possible to fuel cellular processes. Of course, you can only squeeze so
much out of any given nutrient. What’s left is waste that your body removes
via your excretory system, which consists of your large intestine and kidneys.
The next sections introduce you to these organs and how they remove waste
from your body to keep you from getting sick.

Getting to know your large intestine and
how it eliminates solid wastes
After the usable nutrients from food are absorbed into the bloodstream from
the small intestine, the leftover material continues on to the large intestine
(also called the colon). This is where fecal matter (or feces) is created. Feces
pass out of your large intestine and into the rectum, which acts like a holding tank. When the rectum is full, you feel the need to defecate (remove fecal
material). This feat, signaling the end of the digestive process, is performed
through the anus.
As the large intestine converts the leftover material into feces, it absorbs
water and some electrolytes from the material and returns that water to the
body to prevent dehydration. If too much water is absorbed, constipation
occurs; if too little water is absorbed, diarrhea occurs.

Chapter 16: Checking Out the Plumbing: Animal Digestive & Excretory Systems

Why you must wash your hands
Although the bacteria that produce vitamin K in
your intestines are helping to keep you healthy,
they can be extremely harmful if they get anywhere else in your body. One of the bacteria
that lives in your colon is Escherichia coli (or
E. coli). Any strain of E. coli can cause diarrhea
and vomiting when ingested; serious E. coli
contamination can also contribute to sepsis
(bacteria in the bloodstream, traveling around
your body causing infections elsewhere), which
can lead to coma and death.

The number one way that E. coli gets into food
is from dirty hands. When you wipe yourself
after defecating, some of the bacteria that
were excreted with your feces can easily get
onto your hands. If you don’t wash your hands
to remove any potential bacteria lingering there
and then you pick up food with your hands and
eat it, you may ingest the bacteria and make
yourself sick. All the more reason to never
forget to wash your hands after going to the
bathroom!

The large intestine absorbs ions (such as sodium) into its cells from the material passing through it. Sodium ions are necessary for many cellular processes,
such as the active transport of materials across cell membranes (a process
described in Chapter 4). The large intestine also collects (from the bloodstream) ions to be excreted, helping to regulate the amount of ions in your
body. If the amount of ions in your body isn’t in the normal range, serious
effects occur. For example, if your level of sodium and potassium ions (also
called electrolytes) is abnormal, the ability for muscles to contract properly
or for nerves to send impulses correctly is affected, which can interfere with
your heartbeat and potentially cause a heart attack.

Flowing through how your kidneys
remove nitrogenous wastes
Nitrogenous wastes — unnecessary, excess materials containing nitrogen and
resulting from the breakdown of proteins and nucleic acids — are released
from the body in urine. In humans, the kidneys are the organs responsible for
the production of urine.
You have two kidneys, one on each side of your back, just below your ribs.
Like most organs in the human body, the function of a kidney is closely tied

255

256

Part IV: Systems Galore! Animal Structure and Function
to its structure (which we depict in Figure 16-2). As you can see, each kidney
has three distinct areas:
✓ The renal cortex, which is the outer layer
✓ The renal medulla, which is the middle layer
✓ The renal pelvis, which becomes a ureter
Each kidney contains more than 1 million nephrons, microscopic tubules that
make urine. Each nephron contributes to a collecting duct that carries the
urine into the renal pelvis. From there, the urine flows down the ureter, which
is the tube that connects the kidney to the bladder.
Urine is spurted from the ureter into the top of the bladder continuously. The
bladder holds a maximum of about one pint of urine, but you begin to feel the
need to urinate when your bladder is only one-third full. When your bladder
is two-thirds full, you start to feel really uncomfortable.

Urinary problems
Incontinence, the inability to hold urine in the
bladder, often becomes an embarrassing problem for men and women later in life. Basically,
the need to urinate becomes more urgent and
frequent, and sometimes urine leaks out of the
bladder uncontrolled. Incontinence is thought
to be more prevalent in women than men due
to the stress put on the sphincter muscles associated with the bladder during pregnancy and
childbirth. Men, however, have an additional
urinary issue: enlargement of the prostate gland.
The prostate sits right below the bladder and
surrounds the urethra. Its function is to add

fluid to semen as the semen passes through the
urethra in the penis. As the prostate enlarges
(which starts approximately when men reach
age 50), it presses on the urethra, squeezing
urine back up into the bladder and making urinating painful. If the condition progresses far
enough, urine can back up into the kidneys,
which can lead to kidney disease. As people
age, the number of nephrons (the microscopic
tubules that make urine) in a kidney declines,
and the overall size of the kidney decreases,
which can contribute to reduced renal function
and lead to serious problems in older people.

Urine leaves the body through the urethra (see Figure 16-3), a tube at the
bottom of the bladder that opens to the outside of the body. It’s held closed
by a sphincter muscle. When you want to start urinating, the sphincter
muscle relaxes, opening the urethra and letting the urine out.

Y

ou encounter bacteria and viruses all the time, some of which have
the potential to make you very sick. (On the other hand, some bacteria
are actually quite beneficial to human existence.) Whether these potential
pathogens cause you harm depends on a complicated give and take between
their invasion tools and your defenses. You emerge the winner from the vast
majority of your microbial encounters due to the combination of your innate
immunity (a built-in immune system that all humans have) and your adaptive
immunity (the part of your immune system that develops as you encounter
microbes).
In this chapter, we present the structures and cells that keep you safe from
microbes and review the options available to you when your body’s defenses
need a helping hand. We also explain what happens to your immune system
as you age.

Microbial Encounters of the
Best and Worst Kinds
Microbes (bacteria and viruses) exist on every surface. They’re in the air, the
water, the soil — even your body. So how can you tell a good microbe from a
bad one? The next sections solve the puzzle.

260

Part IV: Systems Galore! Animal Structure and Function

Good bacteria: Health helpers
The bacteria that normally live in and on your body are your normal microbiota, and they play an important role in your general health, in large part
because they protect you from disease-causing microbes called pathogens.
Your normal microbiota are beneficial to you because they
✓ Aid the digestive process and assist with blood clotting by releasing
vitamin K. (You can’t get vitamin K from foods, only from the beneficial
bacteria inside your digestive tract. So consider vitamin K the rent the
bacteria pay for using your intestines as their home.)
✓ Take up space and nutrients so pathogens can’t easily colonize you.
✓ Make chemicals called bacteriocins that inhibit the growth of other
bacteria.

Bad bacteria: Health harmers
Some bacteria really live up to the bad reputation they’ve developed over
time. These bad bacteria are pathogens, the microbes that cause infectious
disease.
To cause disease, bad bacteria must be able to do three things:
✓ Enter and colonize the body: Bad bacteria can enter your body when
you breathe or consume food and drink. They can also enter through a
wound or be passed along through sexual contact. One of the more infamous pathogens in history is Yersinia pestis, the bacterium that caused
the Black Death, a wave of bubonic plague that killed about two-thirds
of the people living in Europe during the 13th century. This bacterium
normally lives and reproduces inside rodents, but if infected rodents
and humans are living near each other, the plague bacterium can be
transferred to humans by fleas that bite the rodents and then bite the
humans.
✓ Overcome your defenses: Your body’s defenses are pretty darn good,
but some bacteria have tricks to get past them. Other bacteria take
advantage of you when you’re down. For example, the Streptococcus
pneumoniae bacteria exist in the throats of normal, healthy people all
the time. Most of the time, the bacteria are well-behaved, just hanging
about in warm, dark crevices of the throat. But if the host is weakened
by a cold or flu, things get ugly. The bacteria get a little power hungry

Chapter 17: Fighting Back: Human Defenses
and begin reproducing rapidly, which can lead to a sinus or ear infection, or even pneumonia.
✓ Damage the body: Pathogens produce toxins and enzymes that damage
your tissues. If, for example, food is improperly processed, bacterial
toxins may become the secret ingredient in your meals. One good example of this is botulism. This illness is usually caused by improper canning, which allows the bacteria Clostridium botulinum to grow in the
food and release their toxins. The toxins, not the bacteria, are what
make you sick.

Viruses: All bad, all the time
Viruses are the pirate raiders of the microbial world. They’re tiny particles
containing genetic information that hijack your cells, forcing them to make
more viruses. Although, viruses are very different in structure than bacteria,
they can also make you sick.
Here’s how viruses attack cells (see Figure 17-1 for the visual):
1. The virus attaches its proteins to a receptor on a cell.
You can think of this like inserting your key into the door when you get
home. If your key doesn’t fit, you can’t get in. In #2 in Figure 17-1, you
can see the HIV virus attaching to a protein called CD4 that’s found on
the surface of certain human white blood cells.
2. The virus shoots its nucleic acid into the cell, taking over the cell.
The viral nucleic acid reprograms the cell, turning it into a viral production factory. Instead of doing its job for the body, the cell starts making
viral nucleic acid and proteins. The cell even uses its own molecules and
energy reserves (ATP) to produce the viral parts. In #3 in Figure 17-1,
you can see the viral genetic material of HIV entering the human cell,
and in #6, you can see more viral genetic material being made by the
cell.
3. The viral components pull themselves together to form mature
viruses.
Eventually, this viral replication creates too much of a crowd for the
cell to handle and the cell explodes, releasing viral particles to go wreak
havoc in other cells in the host’s body. The number of viruses that go
on attack at this point can range from ten to tens of thousands, depending on the type of virus. In #8 in Figure 17-1, you can see completed viral
particles exiting the human cell.

Because viruses need a host in order to replicate, they’re called obligate
intracellular parasites (obligate means they need it, intracellular means they go
inside cells, and parasite means they use the host’s resources for their own
benefit and destroy the host in the process).

Built to Protect You: Innate
Human Defenses
Usually you’re not aware of all the microbes roaming the world because a)
you can’t see them and b) your innate immunity keeps most of them from
bothering you. Innate immunity is the built-in immunity that you have due
to the way the human body is constructed. Like the walls of a fortress, your
innate defenses can repel all attackers (meaning they’re not specifically targeted for one particular pathogen).

Chapter 17: Fighting Back: Human Defenses
You only notice microbes if they manage to get past your innate defenses.
When that happens, you need your adaptive immunity to come to your
rescue. (See the later section “Learning a Lesson: Adaptive Human Defenses”
for more on this part of your immune system.)
Your innate defenses have several ways of fending off the potential pathogens
you encounter:
✓ Physical barriers: Your skin and mucous membranes are the barriers
that physically block access to your tissues and organs. You can think of
these barriers as the walls surrounding your castle.
✓ Chemical barriers: The pH of your stomach acid is a chemical barrier
that prevents microbial growth. In other words, your stomach acid is
kind of like the boiling oil that castle defenders dump over the walls
onto invaders.
✓ Dendritic cells: These cells patrol your body in search of microbes and
alert your immune system of impending invasions. Like sentinels patrolling a castle’s grounds, they run back to the interior of the castle and
alert the commander-in-chief of the army (in this case, the helper T cell)
to the presence of invaders.
✓ Phagocytes: These are certain white blood cells that seek and destroy
microbes that have successfully entered your body. They actually wrap
around invading microbes and eat them alive. Think of phagocytes as
your body’s hand-to-hand combat specialists.
✓ Inflammation: This is the alarm call that gathers white blood cells to the
site of an invasion and helps contain and destroy the microbes, similar
to how a warning cry rallies a castle’s defenders to fight an invasion.
✓ Filters: The mucus in your nose and throat and the hairs in your nose
act as filters that trap microbes and prevent them from getting deeper
into your body. But that’s not the only filtration system at work in your
body. Your lymphatic system screens your body fluids for the presence
of microbes and destroys any it finds. All of these filters act a little like a
moat around a castle, slowing the enemy down.
We cover each of these innate defense mechanisms in greater detail in the
sections that follow.

Your body’s best blockers: Skin and
mucous membranes
Your skin and mucous membranes have an important job: serving as your
body’s first line of defense against bad bacteria and viruses. Both the skin

263

264

Part IV: Systems Galore! Animal Structure and Function
and mucous membranes are epithelia, tissues composed of multiple cell
layers that are packed tightly together in order to prevent microbes from
sneaking in.
Your skin is the largest organ in your body, but its size and tightly packed
layers aren’t the only characteristics that make it a particularly good microbe
repellent. Your skin is good at keeping microbes out for these reasons as well:
✓ It’s dry. Microbes need water in order to grow, so many things simply
can’t grow on your dry skin.
✓ It’s flaky. Skin cells regularly fall right off of you, taking microbes with
them.
✓ It’s tough. Skin cells are reinforced with the protein keratin — the same
strong protein that forms your hair and fingernails.
✓ It’s acidic. The fatty acids from your sebum (the oily stuff secreted by
the glands in your skin) give your skin a slightly acidic pH, which prevents many microbes from growing.
Just like your skin guards the exterior of your body, your mucous membranes protect your wet interior surfaces. Mucous membranes line your
respiratory, gastrointestinal, urinary, and reproductive systems. Although
your mucous membranes aren’t quite as tough as your skin, they have some
unique defenses of their own:
✓ They’re sticky. Mucus traps invading microbes as they land on the
membranes.
✓ They move stuff out. Mechanical washing removes microbes from the
surfaces of several mucous membranes. For example, tears wash the
eyes, urine flushes out the urethra, and peristalsis moves material
through the intestines.
In the respiratory tract, a blanket of cilia called the ciliary escalator
moves mucus upward in the throat just like an escalator moves people
upward at the mall. The mucus moves to a location where you can
cough it out, protecting your lower respiratory tract from infection (see
Chapter 4 for more on cilia).

Tiny but mighty: Molecular defenders
The fluids in your body contain a variety of defensive proteins that help
prevent infection. These tiny, invisible defenders bind to microbes, breaking

Chapter 17: Fighting Back: Human Defenses
them down and just generally making it difficult for them to get a foothold in
your body.
These invisible chemical defenders are found in your tears, saliva, mucus,
blood, and tissue fluids. Here are the names of a few of ’em:
✓ Lysozyme is a protein that breaks down one of the chemicals found in
bacterial cell walls (lyse- is to break, and zyme means “enzyme,” so a
lysozyme is an enzyme that breaks down bacteria). It’s one of the most
common molecular defenders in your body; basically, when bacteria
land on you or in you, they encounter lysozyme.
✓ Transferrin in your blood binds iron so microbes don’t have enough
iron for their growth.
✓ Complement proteins in your blood and tissue fluids bind to microbes
and target them for destruction.
✓ Interferons are proteins that are released by cells infected with viruses.
They travel to cells all around the infected cell and warn them about the
virus. Cells that receive a warning from interferon produce proteins to
help protect themselves against viral attack.

Microbe seeker-outers: Dendritic cells
All around your body, white blood cells called dendritic cells look for potentially dangerous microbes with their special cell receptors designed for
detecting molecules typical of microbial cells. Because of these special receptors, called toll-like receptors, dendritic cells are very good at recognizing
foreign microbes. Molecules from bacteria and viruses bind to the toll-like
receptors and activate the dendritic cells.
Dendritic cells do two things that are key to your ability to fight infections:
✓ They release communicating molecules called cytokines. Cytokines
spread through your body and bind to other cells in your immune
system (cyto- means “cell,” and kinesis means “movement,” so cytokines
are literally molecules that travel between cells). The cytokines tell your
immune system that microbes have been detected and help activate the
cells you need to fight back.
✓ They break down microbes into little bits called antigens and then
show the antigens to helper T cells. Helper T cells are very important to
your pathogen-fighting ability because they recognize foreign antigens
and send signals directing other cells of your immune system to fight.

Invader eaters, big and small: Phagocytes
Phagocytes are white blood cells that patrol your body looking for microbes.
When they find them, they grab them and eat them alive (phago- means “eat,”
and -cyte means “cell,” so phagocytes are “eater-cells”). Like dendritic cells
(covered in the preceding section), phagocytes activate helper T cells by
showing them antigens from the destroyed microbes.
The two types of phagocytes are
✓ Neutrophils: These phagocytes multiply early during an infection and
are the first ones to arrive on the scene during inflammation.
✓ Macrophages: These phagocytes live in particular tissues. (Macromeans “big,” and phage means “eat,” so macrophages are literally “big
eaters.”)

Damage control: Inflammation
When microbes do manage to invade, your body responds quickly to try
and contain them. The microbes and your own damaged cells trigger a
cascade of events that leads to inflammation, a local defensive response to
cellular damage that’s characterized by redness, pain, heat, and swelling.
Inflammation fights infection by destroying microbes, confining the infection
to one location, and repairing damaged tissue.
Molecules such as histamine that are released during inflammation lead to
vasodilation and increased blood vessel permeability.
✓ Vasodilation causes blood vessels to widen, allowing more blood to
flow to the affected area. The blood flowing to the infected area delivers clotting elements that trigger blood clots and help confine the infection to one location. It also brings more white blood cells, including
phagocytes, to help fight the infection. As a result of the increased blood
flow, the infected area becomes warm and red.
✓ Increased blood vessel permeability means the walls of the blood vessels loosen up. This allows cells and materials to leave the blood and
enter the tissues where the infection is happening. Phagocytes squeeze
through the gaps in the blood vessel walls, crawl to the infection, and
start eating the microbes. Fluid leaks from the blood vessels into the tissues and swelling occurs.

Chapter 17: Fighting Back: Human Defenses

A fluid filterer: The lymphatic system
Your blood constantly delivers materials such as food to your tissues. After
fluid leaves the blood and enters the tissues, it needs to be cleaned before
it’s returned to the blood. The lymphatic system (pictured in Figure 17-2) is
responsible for checking these fluids for foreign materials, such as microbes,
and cleaning them up.

Your lymphatic system has two main components:
✓ Lymphatic vessels: These vessels carry fluid, called lymph, through a
network of lymph nodes (which are lymphatic organs) and then back
to the circulatory system. (Note: Lymphatic vessels form a circulatory

267

268

Part IV: Systems Galore! Animal Structure and Function
system that’s similar to, but separate from, your blood vessels.) Fluid
from your tissues drains into your lymphatic vessels and then flows in
a one-way direction toward your heart. As lymph passes through the
lymph nodes, defensive proteins and white blood cells clean it of any
foreign material, including microbes. Fluid from the lymph then reenters
the bloodstream near the heart.
✓ Lymphatic organs: Lymph nodes, the spleen, the tonsils, and the
thymus are all lymphatic organs. They’re full of white blood cells that
help fight infection by destroying foreign material. Patches of lymphatic
tissue are also scattered around in different organs of your body.
The spleen is a little different from the other lymphatic organs because
it’s connected to the circulatory system, so it filters and cleans blood
rather than lymph. It’s considered a lymphatic organ, though, because
it contains so many white blood cells and because its job is to clean up
foreign material.

Learning a Lesson: Adaptive
Human Defenses
Your body’s innate defenses are incredible, and they prevent infection by
most of the microbes that you encounter in your life. But every now and
then, a microbe comes along that gets around your innate defenses and into
your body. When your innate defenses are breached, it’s time for the troops
of your adaptive immunity to rally and fight back.
Your adaptive immunity gets its name because it adapts and changes as you
go through life and are exposed to specific microbes. If, for example, you’re
infected with E. coli, only those white blood cells that recognize particular
molecules on E. coli will be activated. If you face a different infection, say the
bacteria Staphylococcus aureus, only the set of white blood cells that recognizes specific molecules on S. aureus will be activated. In other words, when
your adaptive defenses come to your rescue, exactly the right team of white
blood cells is activated to fight each pathogen. That means your adaptive
defenses learn to recognize specific pathogens after you encounter them.
One of the awesome features of your adaptive immunity is that it can remember a pathogen it has encountered before. This immunologic memory allows
your immune system to respond much more effectively when you reencounter a particular pathogen.
Certain cells of your immune system, called memory cells, remain in a semiactivated state after your first encounter with a microbe. These memory cells
and their descendants hang around for a long time after they’re activated in
the first battle. When the same pathogen shows up again, these cells multiply

Chapter 17: Fighting Back: Human Defenses
quickly and efficiently destroy the pathogen before you even realize it came
back. Memory cells are therefore the reason why you can get some illnesses
just once and be protected from getting them again.
We describe the other components of your adaptive immune system in the
following sections.

Commanders-in-chief: Helper T cells
Helper T cells are white blood cells that coordinate your entire adaptive
immune response. (They’re called T cells because they mature in the thymus,
which is one of your lymphatic organs.) Helper T cells receive signals from
the white blood cells of your innate defenses, such as dendritic cells and
phagocytes, and relay those signals to the fighters of your adaptive defenses:
the B cells and cytotoxic T cells (more on these in the next sections).
Helper T cells are also called CD4 cells because they have a protein on their
surface called CD4.
Dendritic cells and phagocytes (which are both considered antigen-presenting
cells) activate helper T cells by showing them the antigens from the microbes
they’ve found. Here’s how the process works:
1. Antigen-presenting cells attach pieces of the foreign antigen to proteins that they display on their surface.
By putting antigens on their surfaces, the antigen-presenting cells can
show the antigen to the helper T cells. They’re basically holding out the
antigen to the helper T cells and saying, “Look what I’ve found!”
2. Antigen-presenting cells also release cytokines, signaling that they’ve
detected a foreign antigen.
You can think of this as the antigen-presenting cells telling the helper T
cells “This looks dangerous!”
3. Helper T cells bind to the displayed antigen using a receptor called a
T cell receptor.
Only T cells whose T cell receptors are the right shape can bind a specific antigen. So, only the T cells that are the right T cells to fight this
antigen will be activated.
Helper T cells also receive signals from antigen-presenting cells. Receptors
on the helper T cells bind the signals, acting like ears so the T cells can
“hear” the alarm call of the antigen-presenting cells.
After T cells bind to the antigens on antigen-presenting cells and receive the
cells’ signals, they activate and begin releasing signals to the other cells of
the adaptive immune system.

269

270

Part IV: Systems Galore! Animal Structure and Function

Soldiers on the march:
B cells and antibodies
B cells are white blood cells that become activated when they detect foreign
antigens with their B cell receptors or receive signals from helper T cells.
They’re activated to form two types of cells: plasma cells and memory cells
(for more on memory cells, see the earlier “Learning a Lesson: Adaptive
Human Defenses” section).
Plasma cells produce antibodies, defensive proteins that bind specifically
to antigens. The antibodies produced by plasma cells are released into the
blood, where they can circulate around the body. Anything in the body
that’s tagged with antibodies — such as invading pathogens — is marked for
destruction by the immune system.
Following are the reasons why antibodies make it easier for the immune
system to fight infection:
✓ Phagocytes can bind to antibodies, so anything with antibodies bound
to it is easier for the phagocytes to grab and eat.
✓ Antibodies stick to pathogens and drag them into clumps. This makes
phagocytes more efficient because it takes fewer “mouthfuls” to deal
with the problem.
✓ Antibodies stick to the surfaces of viruses, preventing them from binding to new host cells.
Each plasma cell makes antibodies that are specific to one antigen, so you
can think of plasma cells like the archers of the immune system. Each archer
is trained to hit just one type of target. When you have an infection, the helper
T cells call out just the set of archers needed to fight that particular pathogen.
Each adaptive immune response is tailored specifically to fight the invading
pathogen. This specificity occurs because B cells (and T cells) activate only
when their receptors recognize a specific foreign antigen. So, out of the thousands of different B (and T) cells your body can produce, only a small subset
reacts to each pathogen.

Cellular assassins: Cytotoxic T cells
If the microbes try to hide inside your cells so the antibodies can’t find them,
that’s when cytotoxic T cells come into play. Cytotoxic T cells are white blood
cells that are experts at detecting infected host cells. When they detect foreign

Chapter 17: Fighting Back: Human Defenses
antigens on the surface of an infected host cell, they order the cell to commit
suicide — a necessary sacrifice in order to destroy the hidden microbes.
Cytotoxic T cells are also called CD8 cells because they have a protein on their
surface called CD8.

Giving Your Defenses a Helping Hand
As powerful as the human immune system is, microbes are amazingly clever and
diverse, which means sometimes you may encounter a pathogen with the ability to get around all of your defenses. This is where science and medicine come
in. Scientists study microbes and how they work, searching for ways to prevent
pathogens from infecting and damaging the body. Doctors study how the body
works and how to recognize the signs of different illnesses so they know which
tools to use to help you fight off disease. Together, scientists and doctors have
found ways to give the human immune system a helping hand when necessary.
The next sections introduce you to these immune system helpers.

Killing bacteria with antibiotics
Antibiotics are molecules made by microbes that kill bacteria. The first and
most famous antibiotic, penicillin, is produced by a mold that looks a lot like
the green stuff you see on old bread in your kitchen. Many other antibiotics
are produced by bacteria that live in the soil.
The structures and enzymes that antibiotics target are unique to bacterial
cells, so they have little effect on human cells (see Chapter 4 for more on the
differences between bacterial and human cells).
Antibiotics worked so well after they were first discovered that people
thought they’d won the war against bacteria. Funding for research on new
antibiotics decreased because people thought they had enough weapons in
their arsenal. But while people were celebrating their victory, the microbes
continued to evolve. Today, humans are faced with a new microbial problem:
antibiotic-resistant bacteria. These bacteria can’t be killed by some, or even
all, of the existing antibiotics.
The conundrum modern doctors now face is that using antibiotics increases
the chances that antibiotic-resistant strains of bacteria will develop. It’s purely
natural selection (see Chapter 12 for more on this concept). In other words,
when antibiotics are used, the most susceptible bacteria die first, leaving the
more resistant bacteria to survive. The resistant bacteria multiply, creating

271

272

Part IV: Systems Galore! Animal Structure and Function
new hordes that are more resistant to the antibiotic than the last horde.
Repeat this cycle a few times, and the antibiotic no longer works at all.
Every year, nearly 100,000 Americans die from hospital-acquired infections
(called nosocomial infections) related to antibiotic-resistant bacteria. And
that’s just part of the problem. Infections that humans thought they had under
control, including such nasty diseases as tuberculosis and bubonic plague, are
rearing their ugly heads in developing countries around the world.
Scientists and doctors are teaming up again to fight the threat of antibioticresistant bacteria. Scientists are searching for new antibiotics and new
bacteria-fighting strategies, while doctors are being careful about how they
prescribe antibiotics. By saving antibiotics for when they’re really needed,
doctors can slow down natural selection and help keep antibiotics working
for as long as possible.

Using viruses to kill bad bacteria
It may seem strange to think of a helpful virus, but that’s exactly what a bacteriophage (or phage for short) is: a virus that attacks only bacterial cells.
Bacteria-blasting viruses were first discovered in the early years of the
last century at the Pasteur Institute in Paris. Canadian microbiologist Félix
d’Hérelle came across the little creatures while looking for a means of
treating dysentery in Paris. He saw phages take on and completely destroy
a whole colony of much larger bacteria. Logically enough, he hoped the
microbes would help eliminate some of the world’s worst bacterial infections.
Until about 1940, these tiny microbes (they’re only about a fortieth of the size
of bacteria) were the miracle cure for many bacterial infections. Then antibiotics came on the scene, and the medical world turned its back on these
little creatures. Because you have to find just the right bacteria to appeal to
the palate of a specific phage or else the deal is off, antibiotics — which have
a much broader spectrum — seemed like a better solution to the problem of
infection.
Yet the rise of antibiotic-resistant bacteria (see the preceding section for
more on this) has caused modern doctors and scientists to once again consider the beneficial features of phages. Here are the prominent ones:
✓ Phages are among the most abundant creatures on Earth.
✓ Phages survive and reproduce in the same neighborhoods that bacteria
call home. They blissfully swim around in piles of sewage and hide in
cozy little corners in your body.

Chapter 17: Fighting Back: Human Defenses
✓ Phages reproduce rapidly. After phages invade a bacterial cell, as many
as 200 new phages are produced per hour. At that rate, it doesn’t take
long before the rambunctious little phages burst right through the cell
wall. Then it’s bye-bye bacterium. But that’s hardly the end of it. The
infant phages move on to nearby bacteria, making short work of every
cell in their path. Before long, a whole colony of bacteria is history.
Scientists are currently working to solve the problems that remain with
phage therapy, which include the time it takes to identify which phages like
to knock off which bacteria. Many scientists advise conservative use of phage
therapy to help prevent the development of phage-resistant bacteria, but
they also say that phage therapy could be a valuable treatment-of-last-resort,
to be used when even the most powerful antibiotics fail.

Fighting viruses with antiviral drugs
Controlling viruses is even more difficult than controlling bacteria. Viruses
aren’t cells, and they have very few molecules that can be targeted by drugs.
They’re difficult to see and isolate, and they’re equally difficult to classify.
And here’s another difficulty in the development of antiviral therapies:
Because the host cell and viruses become so integrated, it’s sometimes hard
to target the virus without destroying or upsetting the mechanics of the cell
itself. So, in many cases, all doctors can do is treat the symptoms of viral illnesses rather than the illnesses themselves.
The medical world does have a couple options for fighting viruses, though:
✓ Interferons and other cytokines can be used to stimulate the immune
system’s response to viruses. These human proteins can now be made
in a lab by scientists who genetically engineer bacteria (flip to Chapter 9
for more on genetic engineering).
✓ Antiviral drugs that target specific viral proteins can be used to treat a
number of viral diseases, including the flu, herpes, and HIV.
The term antibiotic specifically applies to drugs that fight bacterial cells. When
talking about drugs for viral infections, be sure to call them antiviral drugs and
not antibiotics.

Getting ahead of the game with vaccines
Vaccines, solutions containing pieces of microbes that are introduced into the
body, prevent diseases by generating immunologic memory. When you get a

273

274

Part IV: Systems Galore! Animal Structure and Function
vaccine, the antigens from the pathogen enter your body and are processed
by your immune system. The antigen-presenting cells pick up the pieces and
show them to the helper T cells. The helper T cells then activate the B cells
and cytotoxic T cells. In all the excitement of the adaptive immune response,
the memory B and T cells are developed. They remember the antigens and
are ready to defend you if the real pathogen ever shows up. If it does, your
immune system kicks into gear so fast and hard that the pathogen is blown
away before you even realize it was ever there.

Vaccine safety
One issue that challenges the success of vaccines today is people’s fears about vaccine
safety. Because of these fears or mistrust of
vaccines, some people are choosing not to vaccinate their children, a decision that ultimately puts
the children at greater risk for infectious disease.
Following are a few points to consider about the
safety of vaccination:
✓ The risks from a vaccine are less than the
risks from the disease. All vaccines have
risks and can cause side effects. However,
in order for a vaccine to be licensed by the
U.S. Food and Drug Administration, the side
effects must be far less severe than the
effects of the disease, and the risk of having
side effects must be much lower than the
risk of getting the disease.
✓ Many diseases that are perceived as mere
nuisances can actually have extremely
serious complications. Measles, for
example, which some people think of as
a relatively harmless childhood disease,
is the sixth most common killer of children
worldwide. Measles infection can result in
complications such as encephalitis (swelling of the brain) and pneumonia. According
to the WHO, measles killed 777,000 children
during 2000 alone. This statistic is especially tragic when you consider that measles is a vaccine-preventable disease.
✓ Many people in rich nations have no firsthand knowledge of the full impacts of

infectious disease. Most younger people
who live in rich nations such as the United
States or countries in Europe have grown
up in a time when vaccinations were easily
available. Few people who had polio are
still alive in these countries, and hardly
anyone remembers the days when people
ended up in iron lungs because polio had
paralyzed the muscles they needed to
breathe. Because of a lack of knowledge,
the fear of infectious diseases has declined
in these countries, leading people to question the need for vaccinations.
✓ The Internet spreads rumors like wildfire.
The Internet brings a world of information
right into your home. The problem with
that information, however, is that it hasn’t
all been checked for its accuracy. Books
are checked by editors, and scientific and
medical articles are carefully reviewed by
groups of scientists and doctors before
they’re published. All you need to put
information on the Internet, however, is
the cash for a domain name and host server.
An official-looking Web site can fool people
about the reliability of its information, so
always check the source of your information.
Tip: Two organizations that have excellent
information on vaccine safety are the Centers
for Disease Control and Prevention (www.
cdc.gov) and The Children’s Hospital of
Philadelphia (www.chop.edu/service/
vaccine-education-center).

Chapter 17: Fighting Back: Human Defenses
Vaccines are the only tool people have to control the spread of some viral
diseases. Following are the different types of vaccines:
✓ Inactivated vaccines contain killed pathogens. The parts of the pathogen are included, but the pathogen can’t reproduce.
✓ Attenuated (live) vaccines contain weakened pathogens. The pathogens
have been altered in the lab so they have most of their original form,
except for the parts that let them make you sick.
✓ Subunit vaccines contain just bits of the pathogen, such as the antigens
most recognized by the body.
Smallpox has been virtually wiped off the face of the Earth by vaccination.
The World Health Organization (WHO), which works to control the spread
of infectious disease around the world, is now working to eradicate polio
through vaccination and also plans to target measles. Eradication of smallpox, polio, and measles is possible because humans are the only host species for these viruses, which means the viruses can’t multiply and mutate in
animal hosts. So when you get vaccinated against these diseases, your immunologic memory takes over from there and you’re good to go.
Flu viruses are a bit different. They mutate so rapidly that new vaccines are
required each year. When a virus mutates, it can continually adapt to new
intracellular environments and escape from the host’s immune response.
Mutations can change everything from the strength of a virus to its ability to
latch on to new kinds of cell types or infect new animal hosts. Case in point:
The swine flu pandemic of 2009 was caused by a strain of H1N1 influenza
that had a unique mixture of genes from three different strains of flu, some
of which hadn’t infected humans before. Because the H1N1 influenza had a
unique combination of genes, it had a unique combination of antigens, and
no humans had existing immunologic memory. This lack of immunity allowed
the virus to spread far and wide, causing the pandemic.

Aging and Ailing: Changes in
the Immune System
As your body grows, develops, and ages, your immune system changes.
During the busy, trying time of puberty, the thymus starts to get smaller and
smaller until it’s virtually nonexistent later in adulthood. Without the thymus,
T cells don’t get differentiated as well or as often. Production of B cells starts
to wane as well. As the cells in the bone marrow that are precursors to the
T cells and B cells go through a slowdown in production, the bone marrow
becomes less able to put cells through cell division.

275

276

Part IV: Systems Galore! Animal Structure and Function
Weakening of the immune system may explain why people toward the high
end of the average life span (78 years for people living in the United States)
become more prone to infection.
In a rather nasty paradox, older people also have an increased risk of autoimmune diseases, which are diseases in which the body’s healthy cells are
attacked by the cells of its own immune system. One example of an autoimmune disease that’s much more common in older people than younger folk
is arthritis. In people with arthritis, the cells of the immune system attack the
cells lining the joint spaces, causing inflammation and deterioration (not to
mention pain and swelling).

W

ith all the metabolic processes and reactions going on in living
things, organisms need to be able to exert some control in order to
avoid chaos. Enter the nervous and endocrine systems. The nervous system,
which consists of a brain and nerves, is responsible for picking up information from the organism’s sense organs, interpreting that information, and
coordinating a response. The endocrine system releases chemical hormones
that travel throughout the body and regulate metabolic cycles. In this chapter, we fill you in on the structure and function of both systems and explore
how the human body responds to their signals.

The Many Intricacies of Nervous Systems
Animals are the only living things on Earth with complex nervous systems
that first receive and interpret sensory signals from the environment and
then send out messages to direct the animal’s response. The complexity of
an animal’s nervous system depends on its lifestyle and body plan.
✓ Animals whose bodies don’t have a defined head or tail have nerve nets,
which are weblike arrangements of nerve cells that extend throughout
the body. A starfish is a good example of an animal with a nerve net.

278

Part IV: Systems Galore! Animal Structure and Function
✓ Animals with a defined head (such as worms, insects, reptiles, mammals, and birds) possess a two-part nervous system:
• The central nervous system (CNS) consists of the animal’s brain and
central neurons. It’s housed in the head.
• The peripheral nervous system (PNS) consists of all the nerves that
travel to the rest of the animal’s body.
The tendency in animals to have neurons concentrated in the head end of
the body is called cephalization. The trend toward having a central nervous
system is referred to as centralization.
In the following sections, we give you more detail about the CNS and PNS so
you can tell the two apart aside from where they’re located. We also get you
acquainted with the worker bees of the nervous system — neurons — and
explain how your neurons can bypass your brain on special occasions.

Distinguishing between the CNS and PNS
In all animals with a backbone, including you, the CNS (pictured in Figure 18-1)
consists of a brain and a spinal cord. The brain contains centers that process
information from the sense organs, centers that control emotions and intelligence, and centers that control homeostasis of the body (see Chapter 13 for more
on homeostasis). The spinal cord controls the flow of information to and from the
brain; it sits within a liquid called cerebrospinal fluid that guards the CNS against
shocks caused by movement and helps supply nutrients and remove wastes.
Both the brain and the spinal cord are highly protected. One layer of protection is
the blood-brain barrier, which is created by the capillaries surrounding the brain.
These capillaries are highly selective about what they allow to enter the brain or
cerebrospinal fluid. The second layer of protection is the meninges, two layers of
connective tissue that surround the brain and spinal cord.
From there the nervous system branches off into the PNS (also shown in
Figure 18-1), which is divided into two systems:
✓ Somatic nervous system: This part of the PNS carries signals to and
from the skeletal muscles. It controls many of an animal’s voluntary
responses to signals in its environment. In your case, the movements
you make when walking, throwing a baseball, or driving a car are all controlled by your somatic nervous system.
✓ Autonomic nervous system: This part of the PNS controls the (mostly involuntary) internal processes in the body, such as heartbeat and digestion. It
has two divisions that work opposite each other to maintain homeostasis:
• The sympathetic nervous system automatically stimulates the body
when action is required. This is the part of the nervous system

Chapter 18: The Nervous and Endocrine Systems, Messengers Extraordinaire
responsible for the fight-or-flight response, which stimulates a
surge of adrenaline to give the body quick energy so it can escape
danger. The sympathetic nervous system also quickens the heart
rate to move blood through the blood vessels faster and releases
sugar from the liver’s glycogen stores into the blood so fuel is
readily available to the cells.
• The parasympathetic nervous system stimulates more routine functions, such as the secretion of digestive enzymes or saliva. In
contrast to the sympathetic nervous system, the parasympathetic
nervous system slows down the heart rate after the fight-or-flight
response is no longer needed.

Branching out to study neuron structure
The nervous system contains two types of cells: neurons and neuroglial cells.
Neurons are the cells that receive and transmit signals; neuroglial cells are the
support systems for the neurons (in other words, they protect and nourish
the neurons).
Neurons have a rather elongated structure, as you can see in Figure 18-2.
✓ Each neuron contains a nerve cell body with a nucleus and organelles
such as mitochondria, endoplasmic reticulum, and a Golgi apparatus
(see Chapter 4 for more on cells and organelles).
✓ Tiny projections called dendrites branch off the nerve cell body at the
receiving end of the neuron. The dendrites act like tiny antennae that
pick up signals from other cells.
✓ The opposite side of the neuron extends into a long, thin, branching
fiber called an axon. The axon is insulated by a myelin sheath made up
of segments called Schwann cells.

Chapter 18: The Nervous and Endocrine Systems, Messengers Extraordinaire
Nerve impulses enter a neuron through the dendrites. They then travel down
the branches of the dendrites to the nerve cell body before being carried
along the axon. When the impulses reach the branches at the end of the axon,
they’re transmitted to the next neuron. Impulses continue to be carried in this
fashion until they reach their final destination.

Processing signals with the
three types of neurons
The three major functions of a nervous system are to collect, interpret, and
respond to signals. Different types of neurons carry out each of these functions.
✓ Sensory neurons collect sensory information and bring it to the CNS.
Also called afferent neurons, sensory neurons are designed primarily to
receive initial stimuli from sense organs — the eyes, ears, tongue, skin,
and nose. However, they’re also responsible for receiving internally generated impulses regarding adjustments that are necessary for the maintenance of homeostasis. For example, if you touch the tip of a knife, the
sensory neurons in your finger will transmit impulses to other sensory
neurons until the impulse reaches an interneuron.
✓ Interneurons within the CNS integrate the sensory information and
send out responding signals. Also called connector neurons or association neurons, interneurons “read” impulses received from sensory neurons. When an interneuron receives an impulse from a sensory neuron,
the interneuron determines what (if any) response to generate. If a
response is required, the interneuron passes the impulse on to motor
neurons. To continue with the example from the preceding bullet, the
interneurons in the cerebral cortex of your brain will process the incoming sensory information and send out responding signals.
✓ Motor neurons carry the responding signals from the CNS to the cells
that are to carry out the response. Also called efferent neurons, motor
neurons stimulate effector cells that generate reactions. To conclude
our example, responding signals from your brain travel through motor
neutrons until they reach your muscles, signaling your muscles to contract and pull your finger away from the sharp knife.

Acting without thinking
Sometimes the nervous system can work without the brain, as in a reflex arc.
A reflex arc gives sensory nerves direct access to motor nerves so information
can be transmitted immediately.

281

282

Part IV: Systems Galore! Animal Structure and Function
When you touch a hot stovetop, your sensory nerves detect the excessive
heat and instantly fire off a message to your motor nerves that says, “Pull
your hand away!” The motor nerves call the proper muscles into action to
move your hand away before you can even “think” about it. Your brain comes
into play after the fact when you sense the pain of the burn or think to yourself how silly it was to touch a hot stovetop in the first place.

What a Sensation! The Brain
and the Five Senses
The brain is the master organ of the body in animals with a central nervous
system because it takes in all the information received by the animals’ sense
organs and produces the appropriate responses. The brain consists of three
main parts: the forebrain (uppermost part), the midbrain (middle brain), and
the hindbrain (lowermost part). These three parts are further organized into
four major regions that we present in the following list:
✓ Cerebrum: Also called the telencephalon, the cerebrum is the largest
part of the brain and is responsible for consciousness. It’s located at the
uppermost part of the brain and divided into left and right halves, which
are called cerebral hemispheres. Each cerebral hemisphere has four lobes
named for the bones of the skull that cover them: frontal, parietal, temporal, and occipital. Specific areas of the lobes are responsible for certain
functions, such as concentration, speech recognition, memory, and so on.
✓ Diencephalon: Found at the center of the brain, the diencephalon is a
structure that consists of the thalamus and hypothalamus. The thalamus processes information going to and from the spinal cord, and the
hypothalamus controls homeostasis by regulating hunger, thirst, sleep,
body temperature, water balance, and blood pressure. At the base of the
hypothalamus is the pituitary gland, which helps maintain homeostasis
in the body by secreting many important hormones.
✓ Cerebellum: The cerebellum, which is found at the base of the brain,
coordinates muscle functions such as maintaining normal muscle tone
and posture.
✓ Brain stem: Located below the cerebellum, the brain stem is made up
of three structures: the midbrain, the pons, and the medulla oblongata.
The brain stem controls critical functions such as breathing and your
heartbeat.
Bet you didn’t know that the spinal cord is actually a continuation of
the brain stem. You can thank us for this bit of knowledge when you ace
that bonus question on your next biology test.

The human sense organs — eyes, ears, tongue, skin, and nose — help to protect the body. They’re filled with receptors that relay information through
sensory neurons to the appropriate places within the nervous system. Each
sense organ contains different receptors.
✓ General receptors are found throughout the body. They’re present in
skin, visceral organs (visceral meaning in the abdominal cavity), muscles, and joints.
✓ Special receptors include chemoreceptors (chemical receptors) found in
the mouth and nose, photoreceptors (light receptors) found in the eyes,
and mechanoreceptors (movement receptors) found in the ears.
Table 18-1 compares the various types of receptors found in an animal’s nervous system.

We delve into the five senses in greater detail in the sections that follow, with
a focus on how these senses operate in humans.

Oooh, that smell: Olfaction
If you walk in the door of your home and smell an apple pie baking and peppers and onions sautéing, how do you know that the apple pie is apple pie and
that the pepper and onions are in fact peppers and onions and not eggplant

283

284

Part IV: Systems Galore! Animal Structure and Function
and zucchini? The key lies in your olfactory cells (you can remember the
name of these cells by thinking that they “smell like an old factory”); they’re
responsible for your sense of smell.
Olfactory cells line the top of your nasal cavity. They have cilia on one end
that project into the nasal cavity (see Chapter 4 for more on cilia). On the
other end, they have olfactory nerve fibers that pass through the ethmoid
bone and into the olfactory bulb, which is directly attached to the cerebral
cortex of your brain.
As you breathe, anything that’s in the air you take in enters your nasal cavity.
You don’t “smell” air or dust or pollen, but you do smell chemicals. The olfactory cells are chemoreceptors, which means they have protein receptors that
can detect subtle differences in chemicals.
As you breathe upon walking into your kitchen, the chemicals from the apple
pie, peppers, and onions waft into your nasal cavity. There, the chemicals
bind to the cilia, generating a nerve impulse that’s carried through the olfactory cells, into the olfactory nerve fiber, up to the olfactory bulb, and directly
to your brain. Your brain then determines what you’re smelling. If the scent
is something you’ve smelled before and are familiar with, your brain recalls
the information that has been stored in your memory. If you’re sniffing something that you haven’t experienced before, you need to use another sense,
such as taste or sight, to make an imprint on your brain’s memory.

Mmm, mmm, good: Taste
The senses of smell and taste work closely together. If you can’t smell something, you can’t taste it either. That’s because taste buds and olfactory cells
(described in the preceding section) are chemoreceptors designed to detect
chemicals. Your tongue is covered with taste buds, clusters of cells that specialize in recognizing tastes. The taste receptor cells within your taste buds
allow you to detect five different types of taste: sweet, sour, bitter, salty, and
umami (savory).
A lot of people think that taste buds are the little bumps on the tongue, but
they’re wrong. Those little bumps are actually papillae; the taste buds exist in
the grooves between each papilla.
Foods contain chemicals, and when you put something into your mouth,
the taste receptor cells in your tongue can detect what chemicals you’re
ingesting. Each taste bud has a pore at one end that allows the chemicals in
the food to enter the taste bud and reach the taste receptor cells. The taste
receptor cells are connected at the other end to sensory nerve fibers that
carry the taste signals to the brain.

Chapter 18: The Nervous and Endocrine Systems, Messengers Extraordinaire
The sense of taste allows you to enjoy food, which you must ingest to live, but
it also serves a higher function. When your taste buds detect chemicals, they
send the signal to your brain that sets in motion the production and release
of the proper digestive enzymes necessary for breaking down the food you’re
ingesting. This function allows your digestive system to work optimally to
retrieve as many nutrients as possible from food.

Now hear this: Sound
Your ears are the sense organ for your sense of hearing, which kicks into
high gear when sound waves are shuttled through your ear canal and into
your middle ear — the place where your eardrum is located. When a sound
wave hits your eardrum, the eardrum moves tiny bones (specifically the malleus, incus, and stapes). The movement of these bones is picked up by the
mechanoreceptors in your inner ear, which exist on cilia-containing hair cells
between the end of the semicircular canals and the vestibule. When the cilia
move, they create an impulse that’s sent through the cochlea to the eighth
cranial nerve, which carries the impulse to the brain so it can interpret the
information as a specific sound.
Your ears do something else for you that’s not in any way related to your
sense of hearing: They help you maintain your equilibrium. In other words,
they keep you from falling over because they contain fluid within the semicircular canals of the inner ear. When this fluid moves, that movement is ultimately detected by the cilia. The cilia transmit impulses to your brain about
angular and rotational movement, as well as movement through vertical and
horizontal planes, all of which helps your body keep its balance.
When the fluid in your ear doesn’t stop moving, you can develop motion sickness.

Seeing is believing: Sight
Vision is perhaps the most complex of all the senses because it depends
upon the correct structure and function of all the parts of your eye.
✓ The colored part of the eye is the iris, which is actually a pigmented
muscle that controls the size of your pupil. The pupil is the “black hole”
at the very center of your iris; it dilates to allow more light into the eye
and contracts to allow less light into the eye.
✓ The cornea covers and protects the iris and pupil.
✓ The lens of the eye is located just behind the pupil. It’s connected to the
iris by a small muscle called the ciliary muscle, which changes the shape

285

286

Part IV: Systems Galore! Animal Structure and Function
of the lens to help you see things that are both far and near. Specifically,
the lens flattens so you can see farther away, and it becomes rounded
so you can see things that are near to you. The process of changing the
shape of the lens is called accommodation. (People lose the ability of
accommodation as they grow older, prompting the need for glasses.)
✓ The vitreous body is located behind the lens and is filled with a gelatinous material called vitreous humor. This substance gives shape to the
eyeball and also transmits light to the very back of the eyeball, where
the retina lies.
✓ The retina contains two types of photoreceptors that detect light:
• Rods detect motion and can function in low light.
• Cones detect fine detail and color and work best in bright light. The
three types of cones each detect a different color — red, blue, or
green. (Color blindness occurs when one type of cone is lacking.
For example, if you’re missing your red cones, you can’t see red.)
Light strikes the rods and cones, generating nerve impulses that travel to
two types of neurons: first to the bipolar cells and then to the ganglionic
cells. The axons of the ganglionic cells form the optic nerve, which carries the
impulses directly to the brain.
Approximately 150 million rods are in a retina, but only 1 million ganglionic
cells and nerve fibers are there, which means many more rods can be stimulated than there are cells and nerve fibers to carry the impulses. Your eye
must therefore combine “messages” before the impulses can be sent to the
brain.

A touchy-feely subject: Touch
Your eyes, ears, nose, and tongue all contain special receptors. Your skin,
on the other hand, contains only general receptors, but it possesses a combination of general receptors that allow you to distinguish between different
types of touches, from fine touches and pressure to vibration and painful
sensations:
✓ Pain receptors make it possible for you to feel pain, like what you experience when you slam your finger in a car door.
✓ Mechanoreceptors allow you to feel pressure or fine touches, like a hug,
a handshake, or a gentle stroke.
✓ Thermoreceptors help you feel temperature, like heat on a hot
summer day.

Chapter 18: The Nervous and Endocrine Systems, Messengers Extraordinaire
These three types of general receptors are interspersed throughout your
skin’s surface, but they’re not distributed evenly. For one thing, you have
more of some types of receptors than others (as in you have many more
receptors for pain than you do for temperature). For another thing, some
parts of your skin have more receptors than other parts. Case in point: You
have many more receptors in the skin covering the tips of your fingers than
you do in the skin on your back.
When your general receptors are activated, they generate an impulse that’s
carried to your spinal cord and then up to your brain.

Following the Path of Nerve Impulses
Nerve impulses pass through a neuron in about seven milliseconds — that’s
faster than a lightning strike! The sections that follow explain how a nerve
impulse moves through a neuron and how it then makes its way from one
neuron to the next.

Traveling from one end to the other
Before a nerve impulse can enter the brain, it must first pass from one side
of a neuron to the other. When a neuron is inactive, just waiting for a nerve
impulse to come along, the electrical difference across the nerve cell membrane is called its resting potential. In this state, the neuron is polarized with
sodium on the outside of its membrane and potassium on the inside. (A
neuron is polarized when the electrical charge on the outside of its membrane is positive and the charge on the inside is negative.)
The outside of a polarized neuron contains excess sodium ions (Na+); the
inside of it contains excess potassium ions (K+). How can the charge inside the
cell be negative if positive ions are present, you ask? Well, the cell pushes out
greater numbers of Na+ than the number of K+ it pulls in. So, the cell becomes
more positive outside and less positive — or negative — inside.
Following is a description of the process that causes a resting neuron to send
a nerve impulse and then return to a resting state; Figure 18-3 gives you the
visual:
1. Sodium ions move inside the neuron’s membrane, causing an action
potential.
An action potential is the wave of electrical activity that represents the
nerve impulse. When a stimulus reaches a resting neuron, the gated ion

287

288

Part IV: Systems Galore! Animal Structure and Function
channels on the resting neuron’s membrane open suddenly, allowing
the Na+ that was on the outside of the membrane to rush into the cell.
As this happens, the neuron becomes depolarized (more positive ions
go charging to the inside of the membrane), making the inside of the cell
positive as well.
Each neuron has a threshold level. The threshold is the point at which
there’s no holding back. After the stimulus goes above the threshold level,
more gated ion channels open, allowing more Na+ inside the cell. This
causes complete depolarization of the neuron, creating an action potential. In this state, the neuron continues to open Na+ channels all along the
membrane, creating an all-or-none phenomenon. All-or-none means that if a
stimulus doesn’t exceed the threshold level and cause all the gates to open,
no action potential results; after the threshold is crossed, there’s no turning
back — complete depolarization occurs, and the stimulus is transmitted.
When an impulse travels down an axon covered by a myelin sheath, the
impulse must move between the uninsulated gaps that exist between
each Schwann cell. These gaps are called the nodes of Ranvier. During
the action potential, the impulse undergoes saltatory conduction (think
salt, as in the sodium ions that allow this to happen) and jumps from
one node of Ranvier to the next node of Ranvier, increasing the speed at
which the impulse can travel.
2. Potassium ions move outside the membrane, and sodium ions stay
inside the membrane, repolarizing the cell.
After the inside of the neuron is flooded with Na+, the gated ion channels
on the inside of the membrane open to allow the K+ to move to the outside of the membrane. With K+ moving to the outside, the cell’s balance
is restored by repolarizing the membrane. (The result is a polarization
that’s opposite of the initial polarization that had Na+ on the outside and
K+ on the inside.) Just after the K+ gates open, the Na+ gates close; otherwise, the membrane wouldn’t be able to repolarize.
3. The neuron becomes hyperpolarized when there are more potassium
ions on the outside than there are sodium ions on the inside.
When the K+ gates finally close, the neuron has slightly more K+ on the
outside than it has Na+ on the inside. This causes the cell’s potential to
drop slightly lower than the resting potential, and the membrane is said
to be hyperpolarized. This period doesn’t last long, though. After the
impulse has traveled through the neuron, the action potential is over,
and the cell membrane returns to normal.
4. The neuron enters a refractory period, which returns potassium to the
inside of the cell and sodium to the outside of the cell.
The refractory period is when the Na+ and K+ are returned to their original
sides (that means Na+ on the outside and K+ on the inside). A protein
called the sodium-potassium pump returns the ions to their rightful sides of
the neuron’s cell membrane. The neuron is then back to its normal polarized state, which is where it stays until another impulse comes along.

Jumping the gap between neurons
Nerve impulses can’t move directly from one neuron into another one
because neurons don’t actually touch each other. Gaps exist between the
axon of one neuron and the dendrites of the next neuron. Nerve impulses
must therefore move through that gap to continue on their path through the
nervous system.
The gap between two neurons is called a synaptic cleft or synapse.
In many invertebrate animals and in the brains of vertebrate animals, impulses are
carried across synapses by electrical conduction. However, outside of the brain,
such as when a neuron sends a signal to a muscle cell, nerve impulses are conducted across synapses by a series of chemical changes, which occur as follows:
1. Calcium gates open.
At the end of the axon from which the impulse is coming (called the
presynaptic cell because the axon precedes the synapse), the membrane
depolarizes, allowing the gated ion channels to open so they can let in
calcium ions (Ca2+).
2. Synaptic vesicles release a neurotransmitter.
When the Ca2+ rushes into the end of the presynaptic axon, synaptic vesicles connect to the presynaptic membrane. The synaptic vesicles then
release a chemical called a neurotransmitter into the synapse.

289

290

Part IV: Systems Galore! Animal Structure and Function
3. The neurotransmitter binds with receptors on the postsynaptic neuron.
The chemical that serves as the neurotransmitter diffuses across the
synapse and binds to proteins on the membrane of the neuron that’s
about to receive the impulse. The proteins serve as the receptors, and
different proteins serve as receptors for different neurotransmitters —
that is, neurotransmitters have specific receptors.
4. Excitation or inhibition of the postsynaptic membrane occurs.
Whether excitation or inhibition occurs depends on what chemical served
as the neurotransmitter and the result that it had. For example, if the neurotransmitter causes the Na+ channels to open, the membrane of the postsynaptic neuron becomes depolarized, and the impulse is carried through
that neuron. If the K+ channels open, the membrane of the postsynaptic
neuron becomes hyperpolarized, and the impulse is stopped dead.
If you’re wondering what happens to the neurotransmitter after it binds
to the receptor, here’s the story: After the neurotransmitter produces
its effect, whether that effect is excitation or inhibition, it’s released by
the receptor and goes back into the synapse. In the synapse, enzymes
degrade the chemical neurotransmitter into smaller molecules. Then the
presynaptic cell “recycles” the degraded neurotransmitter, sending the
chemicals back into the presynaptic membrane so that during the next
impulse, when the synaptic vesicles bind to the presynaptic membrane,
the complete neurotransmitter can again be released.
Table 18-2 lists some common neurotransmitters and their functions.

Part IV: Systems Galore! Animal Structure and Function
The endocrine system contains organs called endocrine glands that produce
hormones — chemical messengers that coordinate the activities of specific
cells in certain areas of the body. Hormones are carried in the bloodstream to
a target tissue elsewhere in the body, where they must be absorbed into the
tissue before they can have an effect.
The word endocrine stems from a Greek word meaning within. Endocrine
glands secrete their products into the bloodstream, which remains within the
body. On the other hand, exocrine glands secrete products to the outside of
the body. Examples of exocrine gland secretions are sweat and saliva.
The next sections fill you in on how hormones operate and get you
acquainted with some of the important jobs they perform.

Seeing how hormones work
Hormones are long-distance messengers, carrying their message through the
bloodstream to target cells, the cells that respond to the hormone, throughout the body. In order for a cell to respond to a particular hormone, it must
have receptors (molecules that bind to signaling molecules like hormones and
cause changes in the behavior of cells) for that hormone. (Cells that don’t
have receptors for a particular hormone don’t respond to that hormone.)
When the hormone binds to the receptor on target cells, the receptor is activated and causes a change in the behavior of the cell.
Hormones in vertebrates can be divided into two groups:
✓ Peptide hormones, such as insulin, are short chains of amino acids; you
can think of them as very small proteins. Peptide hormones are hydrophilic (water loving), so they don’t pass easily through cell membranes.
The receptors for peptide hormones are embedded in the plasma membranes of target cells. Peptide hormones bind to their receptors at the
cell surface, activating the receptor and causing a change in the part of
the receptor that extends into the inside of the cell. The internal part of
the receptor interacts with molecules inside the cell to cause a change
in behavior. Because the message from the hormone is passed through
the plasma membrane, this signaling process is called signal transduction.
✓ Steroid hormones, such as testosterone and estrogen, are lipids, so
they’re hydrophobic (water fearing) and can pass easily through the
hydrophobic layer of the plasma membrane and enter cells. Thus, the
receptors for steroid hormones are located inside the cell.
Once inside the cell, steroid hormones pass through the cytoplasm of the
cell and diffuse into the nucleus. Inside the nucleus, steroid hormones

Chapter 18: The Nervous and Endocrine Systems, Messengers Extraordinaire
bind to receptor proteins, forming an activated complex. The activated
hormone-receptor complex directly causes a change in the behavior of
the cell, often by acting as transcription factors that turn on the transcription of certain genes. After these genes are transcribed and translated, the newly made proteins perform the function that represents the
cell’s response to the hormone (see Chapter 8 for more on the transcription and translation of proteins).

Surveying the general
functions of hormones
Hormones play several important roles, whether they come from a plant, an
invertebrate animal, or a vertebrate animal. Following are just a few examples
of the many functions that hormones serve within an organism:
✓ Assuring that growth occurs properly: In humans, growth hormones must
be secreted at normal levels by the pituitary gland throughout childhood
and adolescence. The extremes of having too many or too few growth hormones are obvious — giants or midgets, respectively. In invertebrate animals, such as insects, growth hormones are responsible for molting, which
is the shedding of the outer layer (the exoskeleton). Hormones also regulate
growth in plants, and you can find out more about that in Chapter 21.
✓ Ensuring that development and maturation occur properly and on
time: In insects, metamorphosis — the process of changing body forms
during developmental stages — is controlled by a substance called
juvenile hormone. (Metamorphosis is the process that changes a larva
or caterpillar into a pupa and then into a moth or a butterfly.) In vertebrates, hormones trigger the transition from juvenile to adult forms and
cause the onset of sexual maturity. Plant hormones regulate developmental events such as seed germination and flowering.
✓ Making sure that reproduction occurs at the best possible time: For
humans, who have steady supplies of food year-round and sheltered
environments in which to live, reproduction can occur whenever the
urge hits (see Chapter 19 for the specifics on human reproduction).
But for other animals and plants, reproduction needs to occur during
certain seasons of the year when climate and food supplies are optimal.
Consequently, hormones stimulate these organisms’ reproductive urges
only when the climate and food conditions are just right.
So many different hormones are found in animals, that we can’t possibly tell
you about them all. However, we do want to give you a peek into the functions of specific hormones, which is why Table 18-3 highlights some of the
many hormones found in mammals like you, along with the glands that produce them and their major functions.

T

his chapter is your chance to find out all about how babies are made.
It covers the nuts and bolts of how animals reproduce (we explain how
plants reproduce in Chapter 20). Get ready to discover what happens inside
a female’s body to prepare for reproduction, how different types of animals
(including humans) actually mate, how offspring develop prior to birth, and
how gender is determined in humans.

This Budding’s for You:
Asexual Reproduction
Asexual reproduction allows organisms to reproduce rapidly and without
a partner, which makes asexual organisms essentially just fresher, younger
versions of their original selves. Also, asexual organisms don’t really die;
instead, they just bud off into new versions of themselves and continue on.
The basic cellular process that makes asexual reproduction possible is mitosis, the type of cell division that produces exact copies of parent cells (see
Chapter 6 for details).

296

Part IV: Systems Galore! Animal Structure and Function
Asexual reproduction occurs by several different methods in a variety of
animals:
✓ Budding happens when a small outgrowth begins on the original organism. That outgrowth gradually becomes larger and eventually separates
to create a new individual. Several species of invertebrates, including
the hydra, produce offspring by budding.
✓ Fission occurs when the original organism grows larger and then splits
in two. Sea anemones are an example of an invertebrate that reproduces
asexually by fission.
✓ Fragmentation happens when small pieces of the original organism
break off and then grow into complete individuals. Starfish are among
the animals that use fragmentation to reproduce.
For organisms that are widely separated from others of their kind and for
organisms that are doing well in a particular environment, asexual reproduction poses quite the advantage. Yet what makes asexual reproduction an asset
for some species — the fact that it doesn’t allow for change — also makes it
a disadvantage. If a disease strikes or the environment changes and all the
organisms are identical, they’ll all be affected equally. If the disease can easily
kill the organisms, for example, they’ll all die. If they were the only organisms
of their kind, then an entire species would be wiped out in one fell swoop.
Species ultimately have a better chance of surviving changes if their members
have some differences from one another.

The Ins and Outs of Sexual Reproduction
Whereas asexual reproduction involves the entire organism (one whole
organism splits into other whole organisms), sexual reproduction starts at
the cellular level and involves two parents. The new organisms that result
from sexual reproduction develop and grow over time.
In animals, sexual reproduction begins with an egg and a sperm, each of
which is a single cell. Mating combines the two single cells to produce an
entirely new organism that contains either eggs or sperm. Therefore, the new
organism can continue the life cycle and contribute its genetic material to yet
another generation of the species.
The following sections delve into the details of sexual reproduction, from the
cells and mating rituals that make it possible to how humans go about creating new life. (We focus on humans rather than other species because that’s
obviously what’s most applicable to you.)

Chapter 19: Reproduction 101: Making More Animals

Getting to know gametes
Gametes are the sex cells of sexually reproducing organisms. Two kinds of
gametes exist: sperm and eggs. Each sperm and each egg contain half the
number of chromosomes that are normally present in the whole organism.
When a sperm and an egg join, the organism has all the chromosomes it
needs.
Gametogenesis is the process that produces gametes. During gametogenesis, meiosis occurs to reduce the number of chromosomes in the cells by
half (see Chapter 6 for a breakdown of meiosis). Human cells, for example,
have 46 chromosomes, so human gametes have only 23. The entire process
of gametogenesis is controlled by hormones, those protein-containing substances that start, stop, and alter many metabolic processes (flip to Chapter
18 for more on hormones). We explain exactly how gametogenesis works in
the sections that follow.
Note: We focus our explanation on humans, but the process of gametogenesis works pretty much the same in all animals that undergo sexual reproduction. The differences lie in how the animals mate and transfer their gametes.

Spermatogenesis: Making little swimmers
Sperm are the male gametes, and spermatogenesis is the metabolic process
that produces them. Beginning at puberty, human males start producing millions of sperm each day. The sperm only survive inside the male for a short
time, which is why they need to be produced continually.
The process of spermatogenesis begins in spermatogonia, cells containing 46
chromosomes. These cells line the walls of the seminiferous tubules. When
a human male’s hormones pull the trigger to initiate spermatogenesis, the
spermatogonia go through mitosis to produce cells called primary spermatocytes that also contain 46 chromosomes. Here’s how the rest of the process
goes down from there:
1. Each primary spermatocyte undergoes meiosis to produce two secondary spermatocytes.
Secondary spermatocytes are cells that contain 23 replicated chromosomes (we cover replication in Chapter 6).
2. Each secondary spermatocyte completes meiosis, producing four spermatids, each of which contains 23 chromosomes.
3. Spermatids develop into spermatozoa.
Spermatozoa is just the technical name for what you know as a sperm.
To become a full-fledged sperm, the spermatid must mature to the point

moves the sperm through body fluids — in other words, it’s what allows
the sperm to swim. The middle piece contains many mitochondria,
which supply the energy for the sperm’s tail to move, and the head contains the cell’s 23 chromosomes inside its nucleus.

Oh, oh, oogenesis: Making eggs
Oogenesis is how human females produce eggs, the female gamete. A human
female is born with all the eggs she’ll ever have (which means oogenesis
occurs when the female is a developing fetus). These eggs lie dormant from
birth until puberty, at which time the female’s hormones kick-start the eggs
into the menstrual cycle, which continues monthly from puberty until the
woman begins menopause.
The process of oogenesis begins in cells called oogonia (singular: oogonium)
that contain all 46 human chromosomes. These cells grow in size and mature
into primary oocytes. Here’s a breakdown of the rest of the process:
1. Primary oocytes begin going through meiosis but pause early in the
first half of the process.
Each primary oocyte remains paused in meiosis until the female enters
puberty.
2. After the hormones of sexual development start flooding the female’s
ovaries during puberty, the menstrual cycle begins, triggering ovulation and the completion of meiosis in the primary oocyte.
Ovulation, the release of an egg from an ovary, occurs at the midpoint of
the menstrual cycle. To prepare for release and possible fertilization, the
joining of egg and sperm, the primary oocytes continue on through meiosis, completing the first meiotic division to produce two unequal cells:
a secondary oocyte (also called a daughter cell), which receives most of
the cytoplasm (so it’s large), and the first polar body, which has minimal
cytoplasm (so it’s tiny). Both the secondary oocyte and the polar body
contain 23 replicated chromosomes.
3. The secondary oocyte and first polar body complete the second division of meiosis.
The secondary oocyte undergoes another unequal division of cytoplasm, producing a larger egg and a smaller second polar body. The first
polar body divides equally into two polar bodies. The egg and the three
polar bodies each contain 23 chromosomes.
The splitting of the cytoplasm, called cytokinesis, is unequal so that the
egg ends up full of cytoplasm. The egg gets most of the cytoplasm so it
can hold plenty of the nutrients and organelles necessary for a developing embryo. Meiosis in one original oogonium produces just one functional egg. The three polar bodies also produced just wither away.

Chapter 19: Reproduction 101: Making More Animals
In human females, the meiotic division that pauses in the oocyte can remain
paused for 40 years or more! From before a woman is born until her ovulation
ends during menopause, oocytes are in “hang time,” just waiting to develop
into an egg and get fertilized. Of the thousands of oocytes that a female is born
with, only about 500 develop into eggs during the woman’s lifetime.

Mating rituals and other preparations
for the big event
Mating in humans can take place whenever a man and a woman are in the
mood to do so. Most other animals, however, must follow more rigid reproductive cycles.
Pretend for a moment that you’re a female oyster living in the ocean. Every
season you release 60 million eggs into the water (no, we’re not exaggerating). With that many eggs, your mating process is really left to chance. You
just have to hope that one of your eggs happens to bump into a male oyster’s
sperm so fertilization can occur. Leaving the continuation of the oyster species to chance is one reason why oysters release such huge numbers of eggs
in the first place. Obviously, most of the eggs never bump into Mr. Right; if
they did, the ocean would be overflowing with oysters, and pearls wouldn’t
be so expensive. But what happens if you release all those eggs just because
you feel like it and the male oysters in the area aren’t in the mood and don’t
release any sperm? Then you’re left alone in your shell with nothing to show
for it. Animals have reproductive cycles and specific mating seasons to
ensure this type of scenario doesn’t happen.
In the next few sections, we explain how animals decide when it’s time to
start looking for a mate and how they attract one. We also fill you in on the
details of human reproductive cycles because they play a huge part in the
continuation of mankind.

Syncing up for mating season
Animals of the same species need to be in sync to have successful sexual
reproduction. In other words, they need to be attempting to mate at the same
time.
Most species mate when the conditions are optimal. Often that’s the time
of year when the offspring has the best chance for survival. For example, in
deer, the gestation period (the length of time the fetus is developing inside a

299

300

Part IV: Systems Galore! Animal Structure and Function
female mammal) is approximately five or six months. The best time for a fawn
(a baby deer) to be born is in the spring because food is plentiful, temperatures are a bit warmer, leaves are on the trees, and shrubs can provide cover.
A spring birth also gives the fawn the longest period of time to develop
before conditions get harsh the next winter. So, backing up six months from
spring puts the mating season for deer around October or November. And
that’s exactly when you can see bucks competing for does. The strongest
buck, which is supposedly the one with the strongest genes, gets to mate and
pass on its genetic material to continue the species.
Sometimes, however, mating is triggered by a specific environmental signal.
For instance, aquatic (water-living) animals that live in the desert reproduce
only when the scarce desert rainfall produces a temporary pond. During the
dry season, these animals are in diapause, which is a dormant state. In diapause, the metabolism of the animal is very low, and extreme heat and dry
weather don’t affect it. When rain does come, desert-dwelling aquatic animals
become active immediately, breed quickly, and have offspring that develop
as fast as they can before the pond dries up. Then, the new generation gets to
sit in the desert in diapause waiting for the next thunderclouds to appear in
the sky.

Attracting a partner
The birds and bees may reproduce sexually, but they don’t fall in love. Nor
do they suffer angst over whether the other bee will remain committed or
worry about whether their partner will be faithful. Bees “do it” solely for the
purpose of creating more bees.
Although love may not be a requirement for sexual reproduction, attraction
most certainly is. Animals generally rely on one or both of the following to
help them attract a mate:
✓ Mating rituals: Mating rituals are behaviors that animals use to attract
a mate. During mating rituals, animals (usually males) “show off” their
best features in the hope of proving they’d be good partners. One male
may fight other males to show that he’s the strongest; another male may
show that he controls access to lots of resources such as food or nesting space. Consider doves. When a male dove is trying to win a mate, he
struts around bowing and cooing to the female, trying to win her over.
But before they mate, they build a home (sound familiar?). The male and
female doves work together to first choose a place for their nest and
then build it. During the period of time that they’re building the nest,
they take a break and copulate (that’s the formal way of saying they
had sex). A few days later, the female lays two eggs in the new nest, and
when the chicks hatch, both parents feed them. When the chicks are old
enough to start feeding themselves (in about two to three weeks), the
adults repeat the reproductive cycle and start courting all over again.

Chapter 19: Reproduction 101: Making More Animals
✓ Secondary sex characteristics: These develop as an animal matures,
and they’re far less obvious than primary sex characteristics, which are
the male and female reproductive organs. Secondary sex characteristics
in humans include hair growth and distribution (beards in males), deepening of the voice (in males), increase in muscle mass (males), increase
in amount and distribution of fat (in females), and development of
breasts (in females). Male deer grow antlers, male lions grow manes, and
male peacocks develop a fan of beautiful tail feathers.

Human reproductive cycles
Even though humans are capable of reproducing year-round, reproductive
cycles are still involved. Sperm can fertilize an egg any given day of the week,
but eggs can only be fertilized a few days out of every month. Human sexual
reproduction is therefore controlled by the monthly ovarian cycle (the development of the egg in the ovary) and menstrual cycle (the periodic series of
changes associated with menstruation), both of which are controlled by hormones (for more on hormones, see Chapter 18).
As described in the earlier “Oh, oh, oogenesis: Making eggs” section, an
oocyte needs to complete meiosis and mature into an egg before it can be
released by the ovary. Believe it or not, the brain runs this process.
The hypothalamus, which is found at the center of the brain, keeps a
check on how much of the hormones estrogen and progesterone are floating through the bloodstream. When the levels decline, the hypothalamus
secretes a hormone called gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) that heads
straight for the pituitary gland (which is also found in the center of the brain)
and stimulates part of the pituitary to secrete follicle-stimulating hormone
(FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH). FSH and LH begin the ovarian cycle
by kick-starting meiosis again and continuing development of the follicles
(another name for the oocytes that are suspended in meiosis) so they can
release an egg. As the follicles grow, they release the hormone estrogen.
When the hypothalamus detects rising levels of estrogen in the bloodstream,
it releases even more GnRH, causing the pituitary gland to release a large
amount of LH about midway through the ovarian cycle. LH stimulates the
release of the egg from the follicle in the ovary — in other words, LH triggers
ovulation. It also triggers the remaining follicle cells to develop into a mass
of cells called the corpus luteum, which secretes estrogen and progesterone
for the rest of the ovarian cycle (about two more weeks). These hormones
prepare the body for a possible pregnancy by spurring the tissues lining the
uterus to develop thicker blood vessels, which brings more nutrients into the
uterus.

301

302

Part IV: Systems Galore! Animal Structure and Function
The hypothalamus can detect when the levels of estrogen and progesterone
have reached the point where the lining of the uterus is ready for implantation. If fertilization
✓ Has occurred: The fertilized egg implants in the lining of the uterus
and an embryo begins developing. That embryo immediately starts to
secrete the hormone human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG). The presence
of hCG ensures that estrogen and progesterone production continue so
the lining of the uterus remains nourished by larger blood vessels. After
the placenta (a blood-filled, nutrient-rich temporary organ) has formed,
the embryo gets its nutrients and blood supply through the umbilical
cord connecting the embryo to the placenta, which is connected to the
mother’s blood supply. Therefore, the production of hCG by the embryo
declines after the placenta is up and running.
Pregnancy tests detect the presence of hCG. Because hCG is produced
solely by fertilized eggs, only women with a fertilized egg in their bodies
should have detectable levels of hCG.
✓ Hasn’t occured: No hCG is produced, and the hypothalamus tells the
pituitary gland to stop producing FSH and LH. The lack of FSH and LH
stops the production of estrogen and progesterone, which causes the
lining of the uterus, sometimes referred to as the endometrium, to stop
receiving all that extra nourishment. The endometrium then starts to
disintegrate and eventually sloughs off and is carried out of the body by
the menstrual flow. The first day of menstrual flow is the first day of the
menstrual cycle (pictured in Figure 19-1). The drop in LH also causes the
corpeus luteum to disintegrate, ending the ovarian cycle.
The ovarian cycle and the menstrual cycle occur simultaneously and are synchronized to each other by hormones, but each cycle consists of different events.
✓ The ovarian cycle includes the development of the follicle, the secretion
of hormones by the follicle, ovulation, and the formation of the corpus
luteum. It occurs in the ovary, takes about 28 days to go from beginning
to end, and is controlled by GnRH, FSH, LH, and estrogen.
✓ The menstrual cycle includes the thickening of the endometrium to
prepare for possible implantation and the shedding of the endometrium
if there’s no implanted embryo. It occurs in the uterus, takes about 28
days, and is controlled by the levels of progesterone and estrogen.
Many more eggs are fertilized in a woman’s lifetime than she may realize.
Not every fertilized egg results in a bouncing baby boy or girl. If the hormone
levels aren’t right from the start, a fertilized egg may never implant or may
implant but not secrete enough hormones to maintain the pregnancy. If an
embryo doesn’t produce a sufficient amount of hCG, the pregnancy fails to
continue, and the embryo aborts itself (a spontaneous abortion is another term
for a miscarriage). An unusually heavy menstrual period that started a few
days late is often really the spontaneous abortion of a fertilized egg that didn’t
work out.

Talk about overstaying your welcome
After a follicle develops and releases an egg, the
empty follicle is called a corpus luteum, which
is Latin for “yellow body.” If the egg becomes
fertilized and implants in the uterus, the corpus
luteum hangs around to help out with the beginning stages of pregnancy. It secretes progesterone for a few weeks until the placenta is fully
developed and can secrete progesterone on its
own. (The progesterone helps keep the lining
of the uterus rich with blood and nutrients for
the developing embryo.) Sometimes the corpus
luteum sticks around for a few months, but in
most cases, it eventually shrinks and withers
away during the pregnancy.

Notice how we said “in most cases”? About
10 percent of the time, the corpus luteum
hangs out in the ovary far longer than it should.
Sometimes it remains even if the woman isn’t
pregnant. When that happens, the corpus
luteum can turn into a cyst, which is aptly called
a corpus luteum cyst. Usually, this cyst on the
ovary isn’t a problem, unless it continues to
grow, twist, or rupture. Only then does it need
to be removed surgically.

How humans mate
The most important thing you should know about mating is that members
of different species can’t successfully reproduce with each other. After all,
the whole point of sexual reproduction is to create a new generation that
contains the genetic information from the previous generations. Interspecies
sexual reproduction doesn’t work because different species contain different
numbers of chromosomes, and those chromosomes contain differing genes.
For instance, humans carry 46 chromosomes in each cell, whereas chimpanzees have 48 per cell. If a human and a chimp were to mate, the cell divisions
wouldn’t be equal, and a theoretical offspring (we won’t even go there) probably wouldn’t be able to survive.
Eggs are actually surrounded by a layer of proteins on top of the plasma membrane that contains receptor molecules made solely for receiving sperm of the
same species. In human eggs, the zone that prevents fertilization by a different
species is called the zona pellucida. Only human sperm can crack the code to
get into the egg.
In the following sections, we stick to how humans make babies. (If your
parents have yet to have this conversation with you, you can let them know
they’re off the hook.)

Human reproductive systems
Before you dive into the details of human sexual reproduction, it helps to
know a little bit about the organ systems involved. As you can see in Figure
19-2, the male reproductive system is made up of the penis, the testes, and
the seminiferous tubules. Sperm is made in these tubules through the process of spermatogenesis (which we explain earlier in this chapter).
The female reproductive system consists of the vagina, the uterus, the ovaries, and the fallopian tubes (see Figure 19-3). A woman’s egg cells are produced in her ovaries through the process of oogenesis (which we walk you
through earlier in this chapter).

Sexual intercourse
In order to prepare the body for sexual intercourse (the insertion of the man’s
penis into the woman’s vagina), men and women engage in activities that
increase arousal (responsiveness to sensory stimulation). When a man is
sexually aroused, his penis becomes erect because the erectile tissue within
the penis fills with blood. This erection allows the penis to stiffen so it can

Chapter 19: Reproduction 101: Making More Animals
remain inside a woman’s vagina during intercourse. In females, the clitoris
is the sexually sensitive organ. It has erectile tissue and a glans tip, just like
a penis does. When a woman becomes aroused, the erectile tissue within
the clitoris (which is located toward the front end of the labia just under the
pubic bone) fills with blood, and the increased pressure causes drops of fluid
to be squeezed out of the tissue. This lubrication prepares the vagina for
sexual intercourse so the erect penis can be inserted into it easily.
When the penis is fully inside the vagina, the tip of the penis is as close as
possible to the woman’s cervix. The cervix is the bottom end of the uterus,
which extends down into the vagina. Sperm must travel through the cervix
to enter the uterus. During sexual intercourse, sperm travel from the man’s
epididymides (tubules in the scrotum that store produced sperm) to his vas
deferens, tubes that carry sperm from the scrotum to the urethra so they can
be ejaculated.
The actions that occur during sexual intercourse serve to bring the man and
woman to the climax of stimulation, which is followed shortly by orgasm.

Orgasm
Believe it or not, orgasm, the highly pleasurable climax of sexual intercourse,
serves a physiological purpose. As the sexual stimulation of a male intensifies, the sperm move from the vas deferens into the urethra and secretions
from three glands — the seminal vesicles, the prostate gland, and the bulbourethral gland — all add their fluids to create semen (seminal fluid). The
semen contains the following “ingredients” that help promote fertilization:
✓ Fructose: This sugar gives the sperm energy to swim upstream.
✓ Prostaglandins: These hormones cause contractions of the uterus that
help propel the sperm upward.
✓ A pH of 7.5: This relatively high pH provides the basic solution in which
sperm can live and helps neutralize the acidic conditions of the vagina,
which would otherwise kill the sperm.
Orgasm occurs at the height of sexual stimulation and is signaled by muscular contractions and a pleasurable feeling of release. The muscular contractions cause semen to be expelled from the penis, which is called ejaculation.
The average amount of semen expelled during one ejaculation is less than 1
teaspoon, but it contains more than 400 million sperm.

Chapter 19: Reproduction 101: Making More Animals
When orgasm occurs in a male, a sphincter muscle closes off the bladder to
prevent urine from entering the urethra. Shutting out urine allows the urethra
to be used solely for ejaculation at that time. (In males, the urethra is shared
by both the urinary tract and the reproductive tract; in females, the urethra is
solely part of the urinary tract.)
In females, the height of sexual stimulation also causes intense muscular contractions and a pleasurable feeling of release. The fluid released inside the vagina
helps create a watery environment that the sperm can swim in. The muscular
contractions of the uterus slightly open the cervix, which allows sperm to get
inside the uterus and also helps “pull” sperm upward toward the fallopian tubes.

Fertilization
After ejaculation, sperm have quite a bit of swimming to do before they find
the egg. They have to travel from wherever they’re deposited in the vagina,
through the muscular cervix, up through the entire uterus, and finally into
the fallopian tubes, which is where fertilization (the joining of sperm and egg)
actually occurs.
Because a human egg lives no longer than 24 hours after ovulation and human
sperm live no longer than 72 hours, intercourse that occurs in the three-day
period prior to ovulation or within the day after ovulation is the only chance
of fertilization during a given month.
If the sperm does find its way to the egg, it must penetrate the egg in order to
supply it with its 23 chromosomes. However, human eggs have several layers
of cells and a thick membrane surrounding them. To get through all that, the
sperm produces enzymes in a structure near its nucleus called the acrosome.
The acrosomal enzymes digest the protective layers of the egg (so the sperm
essentially “eats” its way into the egg). But the sperm isn’t alone in its efforts.
The egg helps the sperm get inside by going through physical and biochemical changes. After the sperm has successfully joined with the egg, the two
gametes create a cell that contains the full human chromosome count of 46.

How Other Animals Do It
Humans obviously aren’t the only animals that mate and undergo sexual
reproduction. All kinds of animals reproduce sexually. The question is: How
do they do it?
Following is a look at the mating styles of birds, bees, worms, and sea
urchins, as well as explanations of how the species’ zygotes form (a zygote
is the fertilized cell that results when two gametes join together). Note: We
highlight these animals’ mating styles and zygote formation because they
give an overview of the different strategies for sexual reproduction that occur
in the animal kingdom.

307

308

Part IV: Systems Galore! Animal Structure and Function
✓ Bees: The process by which bees reproduce is called parthenogenesis,
meaning “virgin production.” (Partheno- is Greek for “virgin” [as in the
Parthenon], and genesis means “production.”) A queen bee receives all
the sperm she’ll ever be impregnated with during her nuptial flight when
she mates with the drones (male bees that never have a full chromosome count). The queen never mates with the drones again because she
doesn’t have to — she has stored their sperm cells inside her body, leaving her in total control of when fertilization occurs.
When the queen lays eggs and releases the sperm, the eggs become
fertilized. Those fertilized eggs develop into females, many of which are
worker bees (these bees are born diploid but never produce gametes,
which means they can’t reproduce). The other fertilized eggs develop
into new queens. When the queen lays eggs but withholds sperm and
prevents fertilization, the unfertilized eggs develop into male drones.
The cells in drones’ testes develop into gametes that are received by the
new queen, which technically is one of their sisters. (If you’re confused
by what haploid and diploid mean, see Chapter 6.)
✓ Birds: Birds copulate, and the male bird deposits his sperm inside the
female bird. The egg becomes fertilized and is deposited outside the
female bird’s body to continue developing until it’s time to hatch. The
yolk of an egg (the yellow part) is where the developing embryo resides,
and the albumen (the white part) serves to nourish the embryo throughout its development.
Just after fertilization, one spot on the yolk of an egg goes through a
series of divisions called cleavage. At the end of the cleavage divisions,
an embryonic disk called a blastoderm is created on one side of the
yolk. The blastoderm is the initial cell tissue that begins to develop into
a baby bird; it separates into an epiblast, which is the top layer, and a
hypoblast, which is the bottom layer. The epiblast cells migrate down
into the hypoblast along a line in the yolk, called a primitive streak, to
create the mesoderm, which goes on to develop the rest of the bird.
✓ Earthworms: Earthworms are hermaphrodites, meaning they have both
female and male reproductive parts (specifically ovaries, testes, seminal vesicles, vas deferens, and seminal receptacles). When earthworms
copulate, they face in opposite directions and put their citella together.
Citella are the external, smooth, nonsegmented parts of an earthworm;
their job is to secrete mucus and help the sperm get from the vas deferens of one worm to the seminal receptacle of the other worm. Cocoons
form and are protected by a mucus sheath created by the citella. The
sperm and eggs are fertilized inside the cocoon, and the zygotes stay
enclosed in it until they hatch in the soil.

Chapter 19: Reproduction 101: Making More Animals
✓ Planarian worms: These freshwater flatworms are fairly unique because
they can reproduce both asexually (by constricting their bodies and literally splitting in two) and sexually. All planarian worms are hermaphrodites. When two of these worms reproduce sexually, they use their male
organs to secrete and exchange sperm with each other. Then they use
their female organs to create zygotes. The zygotes develop into small
planarian worms that later hatch and mature into adults.
✓ Sea urchins: Male and female sea urchins look exactly the same on the
outside — they both have a ring of genital pores at the center of their
bodies. Males discharge sperm through their pores into the water, and
females discharge eggs through their pores into the water. Fertilization
is left to chance, but it’s helped by the fact that sea urchins live in close
contact, their eggs have a sticky coat to which sperm adhere, and ejaculation by any one sea urchin signals the other males to ejaculate too.

Developing New Humans
Sexual reproduction involves the production of gametes and the act of
mating to join the gametes so fertilization can occur. After fertilization
takes place, the term development describes how the fertilized egg becomes
another new organism that possesses a mix of its parents’ DNA.
In the sections that follow, we walk you through the process of development,
from zygote to newborn. Note: We focus on the development of human offspring because that’s most relevant to your life. However, many similarities
exist between the development of humans and other animals.

From single cells to blastocyst
After the nucleus of a sperm and the nucleus of an egg fuse, fertilization is
complete, and the new, diploid cell is referred to as a zygote.
The zygote begins traveling down the fallopian tube, heading for the uterus
so it can implant in the uterine lining. As it travels, the zygote undergoes
cleavage, a rapid series of mitotic divisions that result in a multicellular
embryo (see Step 3 in Figure 19-4). The zygote divides into 2 cells, which
divide into 4 cells, which divide into 8 cells, which divide into 16 cells. At this
point, the zygote is a solid ball of cells called a morula.

Cell division continues, but the morula becomes filled with liquid, which
pushes the increasing number of cells out toward the periphery of the
embryo’s membrane, forming a hollow ball of cells called a blastula. In
humans, a group of cells inside the blastula become specialized to form
the embryo, and the blastula becomes a blastocyst. Different layers of cells
become specialized within the blastocyst, taking the first step toward forming specialized tissues:
✓ The flattened cells along the edge of the blastocyst form the trophoblast.
✓ The fluid-filled cavity is called the blastocoel.
✓ The sphere of larger, rounded cells that’s destined to become the
embryo is called the embryoblast.
The trophoblast cells secrete an enzyme that helps degrade the lining of the
uterus. After the blastocyst “eats” its way into the wall of the uterus, it sinks
into the wall and implants itself. Conception occurs when the blastocyst

Chapter 19: Reproduction 101: Making More Animals
successfully implants itself in the wall of the uterus (see Step 4 in Figure
19-4); if the blastocyst doesn’t implant in the wall of the uterus, there’s no
pregnancy. If conception occurs, the trophoblast cells of the blastocyst go on
to form the chorion, which becomes part of the placenta.
After implanting itself, the developing mass of cells moves inward, forming a
ball of cells called a gastrula that has three layers; this process is referred to
as gastrulation. Each layer of cells in the gastrula eventually becomes a different type of tissue:
✓ The outer layer of the gastrula is the ectoderm, which develops into the
skin and nervous systems.
✓ The middle layer of the gastrula is the mesoderm, which develops into
the muscular, skeletal, and circulatory systems.
✓ The innermost layer is the endoderm, which gives rise to the linings of
your digestive and respiratory tracts, as well as organs such as the liver
and pancreas.
Conception isn’t the same as fertilization. An egg can be fertilized, but a
woman isn’t pregnant until the blastocyst is rooted in her uterine wall where it
can develop further.

Go, go, embryo
You get more done in the 12 weeks or so that you’re an embryo than at any
other time in your life. That’s because every organ in your body forms during
the embryonic period — essentially the first trimester of pregnancy.
After gastrulation (see the preceding section), the specialized cells of the
ectoderm, mesoderm, and endoderm begin migrating toward other cells with
the same specialty. This cellular migration is referred to as morphogenesis
because it gives the embryo a shape (morph- is Greek for form or structure).
Outside the embryo, specialized membranes develop. The chorion combines
with tissues created by the mother to become the placenta, an organ that’s
filled with blood vessels and provides a large surface area for the exchange of
gases, nutrients, and wastes.
A tubular structure called the allantois forms off of the center cavity of the
blastocyst. In humans, the allantois eventually becomes the body stalk and

311

312

Part IV: Systems Galore! Animal Structure and Function
then the umbilical cord, which connects the fetus to the placenta (both of
which are shown in Figure 19-4).
The amnion surrounds the amniotic cavity, which fills with amniotic fluid that
protects the developing embryo. Amniotic fluid cushions movements created
by the mother and protects the developing organism from bumps. It’s also
thought to contain surfactant, a substance that coats the internal surfaces
of the fetus’s lungs so its lung tissues don’t stick together after birth, which
would prevent the infant from breathing.
The genetic material in the cells of amniotic fluid matches that of the developing embryo, so doctors can use amniocentesis (a procedure that uses a needle
to remove a small amount of amniotic fluid for genetic testing) to see whether
the embryo will have a genetic defect.
Throughout embryonic development, all other systems and structures of
the body form as well. Cells that split off the neural tube and form the neural
crest become the teeth, bones, skin pigments, and muscles of the skull, for
example. At the end of the embryonic period, a human embryo is about an
inch and a half long, and it starts to look less like a lizard and more like a
human.

Fetal development and birth
In humans, the fetal period encompasses the last six months of pregnancy,
or the second and third trimesters. Fetuses are completely differentiated,
meaning their cells have migrated and formed organ systems. All fetuses do
in the uterus is continue to grow and develop features such as hair and nails.
As the fetus gets stronger, longer, and heavier, it looks more and more like a
newborn baby.
Prostaglandins and the hormone oxytocin cause the uterus to contract, but
the initial production of these hormones is thought to be triggered by an
as-yet-unknown chemical produced by the fetus. So, the fetus prompts its
mother to start producing the hormones that initiate labor. If labor doesn’t
begin naturally, medical personnel give the mother prostaglandin suppositories and/or synthetic oxytocin — called pitocin — to induce labor.
When the fetus is finally born, the organism is called a neonate, meaning newborn. A life begins, and development continues. For more information about
what happens during pregnancy, check out Pregnancy For Dummies, 3rd
Edition (Wiley).

Differentiation, Development,
and Determination
We bet you never realized that a large part of who you are is controlled by
three D’s: differentiation, development, and determination. Differentiation
is the specialization of cells that occurs during development; it determines
what the structural and functional aspects of the cell will be. Development is
the overall process of an organism going through stages of differentiation;
over time, the changes occurring at the cellular level during development
become visible. Determination occurs when a cell commits to developing in a
certain manner — that is, when it’s determined to become a particular type
of cell, such as a brain cell or a bone cell.
Think about this: You started out as one tiny cell. When the nucleus of your
father’s sperm fused with the nucleus of your mother’s egg, a single cell was
created containing all the genetic information you’d ever have for the rest
of your life. As that first cell divided, some of its descendants became determined to be heart cells, skin cells, brain cells, and liver cells. Each of these
cell types looks different and behaves differently in the body, but they all
have the exact same set of genetic information. What makes each cell type
different from the other isn’t what kind of genetic information it has but how
it uses that genetic information.
Cells become differentiated through the process of gene regulation, a process
that controls which set of genes a particular cell uses at any given time.
If you think of the different types of cells in your body as workers that each
have a different job to do, then it makes sense to think about each worker
needing a different set of tools. To a cell, that means a different set of proteins.
And to get proteins, cells access the genes in the DNA that contain the blueprints for those proteins. So, your heart cells use some of the genes in your
DNA to build the proteins they need for contraction, whereas your skin cells
use other genes in your DNA to build the proteins they need to protect you
from infection (see Chapter 8 for more on gene regulation).
In the next few sections, we look at the signals that direct cells to become
specialized for certain tasks in the body. We also look at some of the experiments that scientists are doing to try and figure out how to reset the programming of a cell.

Part IV: Systems Galore! Animal Structure and Function

The ability to become any type of cell
Initially, each and every cell in your body (and the bodies of many other animals) has totipotency — the ability to develop into any kind of cell or even a
whole organism. As the cells differentiate during development, they lose the
ability to express all the genes they contain, which means that under normal
conditions, a cell that becomes a muscle cell won’t later change and become
a skin cell.
Differentiation, then, occurs as a result of signals that cause cells to use only
some of the genetic information they contain. Scientists are very interested in
understanding these signals and discovering how to reprogram cells so they
can be used to heal traumatic injury and disease. Following are just a couple
of the experiments scientists have conducted to try and figure out how to
reset the programming of a cell:
✓ Two researchers, Robert Briggs and T.J. King, tested tadpole cells to
see whether they lost the ability to be reprogrammed and, if so, when
they did. They found that up until the blastula stage, at which point the
organism contains 8,000 to 16,000 cells, a single tadpole cell retained
the capacity to develop into an entire organism. In other words, one
cell from a blastula could develop into a whole new tadpole. However,
when they used cells from a later period in development, they weren’t
successful.
✓ Another researcher, J.B. Gurdon, had success in “growing” normal frog
embryos from adult frog skin cells. Gurdon used nuclear transplantation
to move the nucleus from an adult frog skin cell into an egg cell from
which he’d removed the nucleus. When the nucleus from the differentiated skin cell was placed into the environment of the egg cell cytoplasm,
the nucleus directed the growth and development of a frog tadpole that
was genetically identical to the frog that had donated the nucleus from
its skin cell. As long as the egg into which the cell was transplanted
wasn’t past the critical point in development, a tadpole developed.
Gurdon’s experiment was the first successful attempt to clone an
organism — produce an organism that’s genetically identical to the
organism that donates the transplanted nucleus. Since Gurdon’s experiment, other types of animals have been cloned, the most famous of
which is Dolly the sheep.
Animal cloning experiments demonstrate that the nuclei of differentiated cells
retain all the genetic information necessary to become other cell types.
Although animals seem to have a point at which cells become determined to
differentiate into certain types, the totipotency in many plant cells remains

Chapter 19: Reproduction 101: Making More Animals
intact. You know how you can grow a whole plant from a cutting of another
plant? The cutting doesn’t contain roots, but it’s able to grow them because
it can still access the genes necessary for the function of root cells. It’s also
possible to take a few plant cells and grow an entire new plant from them.

The factors that affect differentiation
and development
When embryonic development begins, all the cells in the embryo are totipotent until signals around the cells make the cells turn into nervous system
cells, muscle tissue cells, heart cells, lung cells . . . you get the idea. Most
developmental changes depend upon signals in the environment of embryonic cells that tell them exactly what to do and when to do it. Here’s a rundown of those signals:
✓ Embryonic induction: The influence of one group of cells on another
group of cells is called embryonic induction, and it causes the recipients
of the influence to change their course in development. Cells that wield
this power are called organizers, and they exert their influence by secreting certain chemicals or by interacting directly with target cells through
cell-to-cell contact. Embryonic induction occurs when the lens of the
eye is developing. The eyes start out as bulging outgrowths (or optic
vesicles) on the sides of the early brain. When the optic vesicles touch
the ectoderm, the ectoderm thickens into the lens placode, which then
develops into the curved lens of the eye.
✓ Cell migration: When cells move to new locations during development,
that’s considered cell migration. Cells may follow chemical trails to find
their new destination. Once there, they attach to similar cells and differentiate to become a particular kind of tissue. In the developing brain, for
example, primitive neural cells migrate out of the neural tube to establish the parts of the brain and then begin growing and forming connections with their target cells.
✓ Homeotic genes: Special genes that turn other genes on or off are
homeotic genes. They work kind of like a master switch. The proteins
produced from homeotic genes interact with DNA, affecting the expression of other genes. When certain genes are turned on, certain proteins
are produced that contribute to development. When certain genes are
turned off, the protein normally created is withheld so it can’t affect
development. These actions control what substances are present or
absent in a developing embryo, thereby regulating the development
of that embryo. The powerful effect of homeotic genes can be seen
in genetic studies of fruit flies. If the homeotic genes in fruits flies are

315

316

Part IV: Systems Galore! Animal Structure and Function
mutated, body parts end up in the wrong places — for example, legs can
appear where antennae should be.
Several years ago, a stretch of DNA about 180 nucleotides long (that’s
not very big in the DNA world) was found in most of the homeotic genes
in many species. This short segment of genes is called a homeobox, and
yes, even humans have homeoboxes. A homeobox is the sequence in
the homeotic gene that remains unchanged generation after generation.
In fact, even after so many generations, similarities exist in the homeoboxes of all living things on Earth.
✓ Programmed cell death: Also called apoptosis, programmed cell death
causes cells to commit suicide at particular times during development
in order to remove cells from the developing organism. In humans, for
example, fingers are created when cells between each finger commit suicide, creating the spaces between the fingers.
✓ Cytoplasmic factors: These can create different local environments in
the cytoplasm of a cell, leading to different developmental fates for the
descendents of the cell. During cell division early in development, the
cytoplasm is often divided unequally among secondary oocytes. So,
some cells may get more of certain cytoplasmic factors than other cells.
These cytoplasmic factors may cause the cell to turn on certain genes
that determine its fate. For instance, differences in the cytoplasm of cells
early in development establish the anterior-posterior axis in the embryo,
which ultimately leads to the differentiation of the head from the rest of
the body.
✓ Hormones: Hormones play a role in development after most of the vital
organs (heart, lungs, kidneys, and liver) are formed and limbs and other
appendages are where they belong. Then they take control of the actual
appearance of the body. The production of testosterone in a male fetus,
for example, leads to formation of male primary sex characteristics.

Gender differentiation in humans
Humans are no strangers to the effects of hormones during development. In
fact, human males and females are identical organisms until the time sexual
differentiation occurs.
In the very early stages of development, human fetuses have two sets of
ducts: one for the female reproductive system, and one for the male reproductive system. When both sets of ducts are present, the stage of development is called the indifferent stage (because there’s no difference yet between
male and female). Humans remain in this stage until about seven weeks after
fertilization (about the end of the second month of pregnancy), which is why

Chapter 19: Reproduction 101: Making More Animals
an ultrasound done any earlier than this time can’t tell the sex of the developing embryo. (Note: The first ultrasound of a normal pregnancy is usually
performed at 16 weeks of gestation, allowing visualization of the sex of a
developing fetus.)
The two sets of ducts are the Wolffian ducts, which eventually become the
male vas deferens, epididymis (on the testes), and seminal vesicles, and the
Müllerian ducts, which eventually become the oviducts, uterus, and vagina.
Inside the cells, the chromosomes determine whether the embryo will develop
into a male or a female. Of the 46 human chromosomes, the last pair — the two
Chromosomes 23 — are either two X chromosomes or an X and a Y chromosome. Two X chromosomes indicate female; an X and a Y indicate male. If two
X chromosomes are inside the cells of the developing reproductive system, the
female ducts develop, and the male ducts disintegrate. The reverse happens if
an X chromosome and a Y chromosome are in the cells.
The following sections provide the specifics on how primary sex characteristics develop and list some of the ways that can happen incorrectly.

How boys become boys
A gene called SRY (for sex-determining region Y chromosome) is the specific
gene that determines maleness. SRY contains the blueprint for a protein
called testes determining factor (TDF), which is a transcription factor that
interacts with DNA to turn on the transcription of the genes necessary for
testes development. (Transcription factors are proteins that turn genes on and
off; turn to Chapter 8 to find out more.)
After the testes are formed, they begin to secrete the hormone testosterone (in
the form dihydrotestosterone, or DHT). Testosterone supports the development
of the male reproductive system and directs development of external genitalia.
The tubules necessary for ejaculation of semen are complete at about 14 weeks
of gestation (which is the beginning of the second trimester of pregnancy). At
about that time, the penis, testes, and scrotum develop from the urogenital
tubercle, urogenital swellings, and urogenital folds. The urogenital tubercle
becomes the glans penis in the male, the urogenital folds become the shaft of
the penis, and the urogenital swellings become the scrotum.
If SRY is absent, the primary gonad develops into ovaries, but two X chromosomes are required for the ovaries to be maintained.

How girls become girls
The absence of DHT in a fetus is what spurs the development of female
external genitalia. Without DHT, the urogenital tubercle becomes the clitoris
(which is equivalent to the glans penis), the urogenital swellings become the
labia majora, and the urogenital folds become the labia minora.

317

318

Part IV: Systems Galore! Animal Structure and Function
A female’s external genitalia develop even if the internal genitalia fail to
develop. External female structures are completed between 14 and 16 weeks
of gestation.

Problems with sexual development
The complex process of sexual differentiation involving genes and hormones
isn’t without error. Following are the problems that can occur in the hormonal stimulation of genitalia:
✓ Androgen insensitivity: A male who can’t develop external male genitalia has androgen insensitivity. Embryos with an abnormal androgen
receptor can’t bind the DHT necessary to produce male genitalia.
Therefore, they may be male genetically (XY), but they have female
external genitalia.
✓ Hermaphrodites: People with some male and some female characteristics are hermaphrodites. This condition can result from hormonal imbalances. In embryos that oversecrete adrenal androgens (hormones that
are involved in the normal synthesis of DHT and testosterone), a genetic
female may have masculinized external genitalia complete with a penis
but have normal ovaries and other female internal reproductive structures. Or, a genetic male may be undermasculinized.
✓ Klinefelter’s syndrome: Males with Klinefelter’s syndrome have two X
chromosomes and one Y chromosome (XXY). They usually have small
testes that don’t produce enough testosterone. As a result, male secondary sex characteristics, such as facial hair, may not develop completely,
and the male is usually infertile. Males with Klinefelter’s syndrome
tend to be taller; they may also have feminizing characteristics such as
enlarged breasts. Treatment with hormone therapy can greatly reduce
these effects and allow males to develop more normally and have
normal sex lives.
✓ Turner syndrome: This genetic disorder, which leaves females infertile, can occur in two ways. First, a genetically female (XX) individual
may be missing part or all of one of the X chromosomes, resulting in
an XO individual (a person with only one sex chromosome, an X) that’s
neither completely female nor male. Second, an embryo may have an
X chromosome and a Y chromosome, which normally indicates male,
but a deletion occurs in the region of the sex-determining gene on the Y
chromosome. This deletion prevents development of testes, so no DHT
is produced. Female internal and external genitalia develop, but the ovaries fail prematurely. Women with Turner syndrome are often shorter
than other women, may have extra folds of skin around the neck, and
may fail to enter puberty. However, recent advances in hormone therapy
have significantly reduced these effects.

A

plant’s structure suits its lifestyle. After all, it has flat leaves for gathering
sunlight, roots for drawing water up from the soil, and flowers and fruits
for reproduction. Plants begin their lives from seeds or spores, grow to maturity, and then reproduce asexually or sexually to create new generations.
In this chapter, we present the fundamental structures of plants, how they
get the energy they need to grow, and their reproductive strategies.

Presenting Plant Structure
Like animals, plants are made of cells and tissues, and those tissues form
organs, such as leaves and flowers, that are specialized for different functions. Plants have two basic organ systems: a root system (which exists
underground) and a shoot system (found aboveground). The root system is
responsible for anchoring the plant and also absorbing minerals and water
from the soil. The shoot system ensures the plant gets enough sunlight to
conduct photosynthesis; it also transports water upward from the roots and
moves sugars throughout the plant.
Within their organ systems, plants have up to three types of tissues.
Biologists look at the types of tissues a plant has to help them classify plants
into four different groups. They also look at the different structures of plant
stems.

322

Part V: It’s Not Easy Being Green: Plant Structure and Function

Plant tissues
All plants have tissues, but not all plants possess all three of the following
types of tissues:
✓ Dermal tissue: Consisting primarily of epidermal cells, dermal tissue
covers the entire surface of a plant. Guard cells in a plant’s epidermis
control the opening and closing of little holes called stomates that allow
the plant to exchange gases with its environment (you can see a stomate
in the leaf cross section in Figure 20-1).
✓ Ground tissue: This tissue type makes up most of a plant’s body and
contains three types of cells:
• Parenchyma cells are the most common ground tissue cells. They
perform many basic plant cell functions, including storage, photosynthesis, and secretion.
• Collenchyma cells have thick cell walls in order to help support
the plant.
• Sclerenchyma cells are similar to collenchyma cells, but their
walls are even thicker — so thick, in fact, that mature schlerenchyma cells die because they can’t get food or water across their
walls via osmosis (more about that in Chapter 4).
✓ Vascular tissue: The system of tubules inside a plant that carries nutrients around is made up of vascular tissue. Vascular tissue consists of a
water-transport system called xylem and a sugar-transport system called
phloem. Vascular tissue also contains the vascular cambium, a tissue
of cells that can divide to produce new cells for the xylem and phloem.
(Vascular plants make up the majority of plants on Earth. You can see
the basic cells and structures of a vascular plant in Figure 20-1.)

The types of plants
Based on the types of tissues they have and reproductive structures they
make, plants can be organized into four major groups:
✓ Bryophytes are plants such as mosses that don’t have a vascular system
and don’t produce flowers or seeds.
✓ Ferns have vascular tissue, but they don’t produce seeds.
✓ Gymnosperms (also known as conifers) have vascular tissue and produce cones and seeds, but they don’t produce flowers.

Chapter 20: Living the Life of a Plant
✓ Angiosperms (or flowering plants) have vascular tissue and produce
both flowers and seeds. Two distinct groups exist among flowering
plants:
• Monocots, like corn and lilies, have seeds that contain one cotyledon (tissues within the seed that supply nutrition to the embryo
and then emerge as the first leaves after the seed begins to grow;
they’re also referred to as seed leaves).
• Dicots, like beans, oak trees, and daisies, have seeds that contain
two cotyledons.

Herbaceous versus woody stems
Biologists use the appearance and feel of a plant’s stem to place it into one of
two categories: herbaceous (where the stem remains somewhat soft and flexible) and woody (where the stem has developed wood). All plant cells have
primary cell walls made of cellulose, but the cells of woody plants have extra
reinforcement from a secondary cell wall that contains lots of a tough compound called lignin.
Plants that survive just one or two growing seasons — that is, annuals or biennials — are typically herbaceous plants. Plants that live year after year, called
perennials, may become woody.
The stems of herbaceous and woody dicots (see the preceding section) are
organized differently. You can see these differences most clearly if you look
at a cross section (a section cut at right angles to the long axis) of a stem.
Imagine taking a hot dog and slicing it into little circles, and you’ve got a
pretty good picture of how biologists make stem cross sections.
When you look at a cross section of the stem of an herbaceous dicot, you see
that
✓ The center of the stem consists of pith (a soft, spongy tissue), which has
many thin-walled cells called parenchymal cells. The thin walls allow the
diffusion of nutrients and water between the cells.
✓ The vascular tissue is organized in vascular bundles that contain both
xylem and phloem, as well as some vascular cambium (all of which are
described in the earlier “Plant tissues” section). The vascular bundles
are arranged in a ring around the pith.

Chapter 20: Living the Life of a Plant
✓ Outside the vascular bundle ring is the stem’s cortex. It contains a layer
of endodermis, additional parenchymal cells, and mechanical tissue,
which supports the weight of the plant and holds the stem upright.
✓ On the surface of the stem are the epidermis and the cuticle.
Woody dicots start life with green herbaceous stems that have vascular
bundles. As they grow, however, the bundles merge with each other to form
rings of vascular tissue that circle the stem. If you were to examine a cross
section of the stem of a woody dicot that was a couple years old (like the one
in Figure 20-2), you’d see that
✓ The center of the stem consists of a circle of pith.
✓ The xylem tissue forms a ring around the pith. As woody plants grow,
new layers of xylem are added every year, forming rings inside the
woody stem. (You can count these rings in the stem of a tree to tell how
old it was when it was cut.) As these rings of xylem accumulate year
after year, the diameter of the woody stem increases.
The inner part of a woody stem is called heartwood. It consists of older
xylem tissue that’s filled with material such as gums and resins and no
longer conducts water. Outside the heartwood is the sapwood, newer
layers of xylem tissue that transport water and minerals up through the
stem.
✓ Just outside the xylem rings is a ring of vascular cambium. As the stem
grows, the vascular cambium divides to produce new xylem cells toward
the inside of the stem and new phloem cells toward the outside of the
stem.
✓ Outside the vascular cambium ring is a ring of phloem. The phloem of
woody plants gets pushed farther and farther outward as the xylem
tissue increases in size year after year. Phloem cells are fairly delicate,
and the old phloem cells get crushed against the bark as the stem grows.
The only phloem that serves to transport materials through the woody
plant is the phloem that’s newly formed during the most recent growing
season.
✓ Outside the phloem is the bark, a ring of boxy, waterproof cells that help
protect the stem. Bark includes the outermost cells of the stem and a
layer of cork cells just beneath that outermost layer.

Obtaining Matter and Energy for Growth
The biggest difference between plants and animals is how they get the matter
and energy they need for growth. Animals have to eat other living things to
get their food, but plants can produce their own food. Plants absorb sunlight
and use that energy to make glucose from carbon dioxide and water during
the process of photosynthesis (we describe photosynthesis in detail in
Chapter 5); glucose is the food plants can use as a source of energy or matter
for growth.
As you can see from the following list, plant structures are specialized to help
plants get what they need for photosynthesis:
✓ The shoot system helps plants capture energy from the Sun. Shoots
grow upward, bringing leaves toward the Sun. Branches spread leaves
out so they can absorb light over a wider area, and many leaves are flat
so they have the most surface area possible for light absorption.
✓ The root system absorbs water and minerals from the soil. Water is
needed for photosynthesis and basic plant functioning. Minerals perform
the same function for plants as they do for you — they improve general
metabolism by helping enzymes function properly. Also, plants absorb
nitrogen-containing compounds from the soil and use them, along with
the carbohydrates made during photosynthesis, to construct plant proteins (flip to Chapter 11 for the scoop on how plants get nitrogen).

Chapter 20: Living the Life of a Plant
✓ Stomates in the leaves allow plants to take carbon dioxide from the
atmosphere and return oxygen to it. The carbon dioxide provides the
carbon and oxygen atoms plants need to build carbohydrates. Also, photosynthesis produces oxygen when the hydrogen and oxygen atoms in
water are separated. Oxygen gas leaves plants through their stomates.
Plants extract energy from food molecules the same way animals do — by
cellular respiration (see Chapter 5 for more on cellular respiration). When
plants do cellular respiration, they produce carbon dioxide and use oxygen
just like animals do. During the day, however, photosynthesis absorbs so
much carbon dioxide and releases so much oxygen that plant respiration
isn’t detectable. If you were to measure gas exchange around a plant in the
dark, the plant would be exchanging gases just like you.

Going It Alone: Asexual Reproduction
Plants that reproduce asexually make copies of themselves in order to produce offspring that are genetically identical to them. The advantage to asexual
reproduction is that it allows successful organisms to reproduce quickly. The
disadvantage is that all the offspring are genetically identical, which decreases
the ability of the population to survive changes in the environment.
The most common method of asexual reproduction is mitosis, which we
describe in Chapter 6. Other ways a plant can reproduce asexually include
fragmentation, a form of asexual reproduction that involves pieces of an individual growing into new individuals. If you break off a piece of many houseplants (the technical term is “take a cutting”) and stick it in water, new roots
and shoots may grow, creating a whole new plant from a piece of the parent
plant. Likewise, if you cut a potato into pieces, each piece that has an “eye”
can produce a new potato plant. In essence, the new plant is a clone of the
parent plant: It has all the same genetic information because the cells are
identical.
Other plants, such as strawberry plants, produce special structures that
help them spread asexually. In addition to producing stems, the strawberry
plant produces a stolon, also referred to as a runner, that spreads across the
ground. Wherever that stolon starts to put roots down is where a new strawberry plant grows. Similarly, many ferns reproduce asexually by underground
stems called rhizomes.

327

Part V: It’s Not Easy Being Green: Plant Structure and Function

Mixing Sperm and Eggs:
Sexual Reproduction
Plants do have sex, believe it or not. First, they produce eggs and sperm
through meiosis just like animals do (see Chapter 6 for the full scoop on meiosis). Then a sperm and an egg meet, creating offspring that have different
combinations of genetic material than the parent plants.
The following sections get you familiar with the life cycle of plants that reproduce sexually along with all the little details and processes that involves,
from flower structure and pollination to fertilization and the development
(and protection) of plant embryos.

The life of a plant
The life cycles of plants are a bit more complicated than those of animals. In
animals, gametes (sperm and eggs) are usually small and inconspicuous. In
plants, however, gametes can almost have a life of their own.
Plant life cycles involve the alternation of generations between two stages
called sporophytes and gametophytes (see Figure 20-3). Here’s a breakdown
of the cycle:
1. Meiosis in a sporophyte (a parent plant) results in the production of
spores that are haploid (meaning they have half the genetic information of the parent plant).
2. The spores develop by mitosis into multicellular haploid organisms
called gametophytes.
The gametophyte step of the plant life cycle is a fundamental difference
between plants and animals. In animals, no development occurs until a
sperm and an egg combine to produce a new organism. In plants, there’s
a little break between meiosis and the production of sperm and eggs.
During that break, a separate little haploid plant grows.
3. Gametophytes produce gametes by mitosis.
In animals, sperm and egg are produced by meiosis, but in plants, meiosis occurs to produce the gametophyte.
4. The gametes merge, producing cells called zygotes that contain the
same number of chromosomes as the parent plant (so the zygotes are
diploid).
5. Zygotes divide by mitosis and develop into sporophytes so the life
cycle can begin again.

The plants you see when you go for a walk in the woods may be sporophytes
or gametophytes; it all depends on the type of plant you’re looking at.
✓ The mosses you see growing on trees and on the forest floor are gametophytes. If you see little structures like flagpoles sticking off the moss,
then you’re looking at a sporophyte. The little sporophytes grow like
flags off the tops of the gametophytes. Inside the little flags, called capsules, meiosis is occurring to produce spores.
✓ Ferns you can see are sporophytes. If you look on the back of a fern’s
leaves, you can find little brown structures that seem dusty to the touch.
These structures are where spores are being made, and the dust that
comes off are the spores. Fern gametophytes are teeny — about as big
as the fingernail on your pinky — making them very tough to find in the
wild.
✓ The conifers you see in a forest are sporophytes. The gametophyte generation in conifers is very small and contained within their cones.
✓ Flowering plants that are visible to the eye are also sporophytes. In flowering plants, the gametophyte generation is very small and contained
within the flowers.

Part V: It’s Not Easy Being Green: Plant Structure and Function

The parts of a flower
Whether a flowering plant’s flowers are large and showy or small and dainty,
sexual reproduction occurs inside. Flowers form on specialized shoots of
the plant, and they have specific parts. Following are descriptions of some of
these parts (you can see several of them in Figure 20-4):
✓ The receptacle is the base of the flower.
✓ Sepals are the lowest layer of leaves on the flower. They’re usually green.
✓ Petals are modified leaves that are often brightly colored to attract pollinators (see the next section for more on pollinators).
✓ Stamens are the male parts of a flower. Each stamen consists of a
threadlike filament and a little sac called the anther. Inside the anther,
meiosis and mitosis occur to produce the male gametophyte, pollen.
✓ Pistils are the female parts of a flower. The ovary is located at the swollen base of the pistil. Inside the ovary, meiosis and mitosis produce the
female gametophyte and the egg, which are housed inside an ovule.
✓ The style and stigma grow up out of the ovary. Pollen lands on the
stigma and then travels down through the style to deliver sperm to the
eggs inside the ovary.

How pollination and fertilization occur
Pollination, the delivery of pollen to a flower’s stigma, and fertilization, when
a sperm joins with an egg, are two separate yet important events that occur
within flowering plants.
Some flowering plants, like grasses, are wind pollinated, which means they
make lots and lots of pollen and trust the wind to blow it to the right place.
Other flowering plants rely on animals such as bees, wasps, birds, and even
flies and bats to transfer pollen from one flower to another.
Here’s how different plants attract their animal pollinators:
✓ Bird- and bee-pollinated plants are usually brightly colored to attract
the animals; they may also provide nectar to encourage visits. Beepollinated flowers are often marked with lines just like little runways to
direct the bees to the right place in the flower. These runways are invisible to human eyes but visible to the bees, who can see ultraviolet light.
✓ Some plants, like certain wasp-pollinated orchids, trick the animals into
thinking that the flowers are members of the opposite sex. In this case,
the wasps attempt reproduction with the flowers and get covered with
pollen before moving on to the next flower to try again.

Chapter 20: Living the Life of a Plant
✓ Fly-pollinated plants smell like toilets or rotten meat in order to attract
mama flies in search of a good place to lay their eggs.
✓ Bat- and moth-pollinated flowers are usually white so they’ll be more visible at night, which is when they open.
When pollen arrives at the stigma of a flower, each pollen grain grows a long
tube called a pollen tube. The pollen tube grows down through the flower’s
style so the sperm cells inside the pollen can be delivered right to the ovules
inside the flower’s ovary.

Part V: It’s Not Easy Being Green: Plant Structure and Function
After pollination has occurred, two sperm nuclei enter the ovule (the part of
the ovary that contains the egg and develops into the seed after fertilization),
and one fuses with an egg to form the zygote. The other sperm joins with two
haploid cells inside the ovule, called the polar nuclei, to form a tissue called
endosperm that helps support the developing embryo. In flowering plants, the
fusion of two sperm cells, one with an egg and one with the polar nuclei, is
called double fertilization.

From zygote to embryo
After fertilization, the zygote divides by mitosis to produce an embryo. The
first cell division produces two cells: one large, one small. Several more
cell divisions occur after that, producing a line of cells called a suspensor.
Additional cell divisions form the embryo in such a way that the cells at
the bottom grow downward to become roots, and the cells at the top grow
upward to become shoots.
The embryo’s hypocotyl, which is attached to the bottom end of the suspensor, becomes the lower part of the stem and the roots. The cotyledons, or
seed leaves, develop at the top end of the embryo; they’re temporary structures that serve as nutrient storage sites for the developing plant. After the
plant is growing aboveground and can start producing nutrients on its own
through photosynthesis, the cotyledons shrink away.

A little protection for the embryo: Seeds
Seeds are protective structures that contain plant embryos and nutritive
tissue to support the embryo until it can survive on its own. The endosperm
produced during double fertilization provides nutrient material to the developing embryo, tissues from the ovule harden to become the seed coat that
protects the embryo, and the ovary of the flower forms a fruit around the
seed. After a seed develops, it usually dries out, and its water content drops
very low. This low water level keeps the embryo’s metabolism at a minimal
level so it can survive on stored food for a long time. So the seeds that you
buy in a little packet at the local nursery are very much alive, but they’re in a
state similar to that of a hibernating bear.
When seeds are planted in an environment with water, the dry seeds take
up water and swell. As water becomes available, the embryo’s metabolism
speeds up, and it begins to grow by using the stored food inside the seed.
Germination occurs when the seedlings emerge from the seed and begin to
grow into a diploid plant.

▶ Moving water and other nutrients through plants
▶ Getting sugars where they need to go
▶ Triggering plant responses with hormones

P

hotosynthesis (described in Chapter 5) isn’t the only life-sustaining
process carried out by plants. Below the surface, plants are busy collecting and transporting water and other nutrients upward, as well as moving
sugars upward and downward to the cells that need them. Their hormones,
meanwhile, are sending messages to promote growth toward sunlight and
blossoming, among other things.
Consider this chapter your introduction to the physiology of plants (physiology is the study of the function of organisms and their parts). Here, you
discover the processes plants use to transport nutrients, fluids, and sugars
throughout their bodies. You also get to know the plant hormones that regulate growth and development.

How Nutrients, Fluids, and
Sugars Move through Plants
Just like you have a circulatory system that moves food and oxygen throughout your body, plants have a system to move nutrients, fluids, and sugars
throughout their bodies. (Even though plants make food in their leaves by
photosynthesis, the entire plant needs some of that food and the nutrients it
provides.) The following sections fill you in on the different nutrients plants
must absorb to stay healthy as well as how they move sugars from their
leaves and water from their roots (without losing too much of it).

Part V: It’s Not Easy Being Green: Plant Structure and Function

Taking an inventory of the nutrients
plants need to survive
All plants require carbohydrates, proteins, fats, and nucleic acids to function —
the same as you do. They also need mineral elements to build their molecules
and make sure their enzymes are working properly. Fortunately, plants can
obtain all the nutrients they need to survive from their environment.
Plants get carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen by taking carbon dioxide from the
atmosphere and water from the soil. With energy from the Sun, plants combine
these molecules to form carbohydrates during the process of photosynthesis.
Plants obtain their necessary mineral elements from the soil as well. The
mineral nutrients found in soil dissolve in water, so when plants absorb
water through their roots, they obtain both macronutrients and micronutrients. Macronutrients help with molecule construction, and micronutrients act
as partners for enzymes and other proteins to help them function. Plants
generally require large amounts of macronutrients and smaller amounts of
micronutrients. Table 21-1 lists the specific macro- and micronutrients plants
absorb from soil.

You can remember the most important elements for plants with the phrase “C.
Hopkins Café, Mighty Good.” This phrase stands for CHOPKNS CaFe Mg — in
other words, carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, phosphorous, potassium, nitrogen,
sulfur, calcium, iron, and magnesium. All of these elements are macronutrients
for plants, with the exception of iron, which is considered a micronutrient.

Chapter 21: Probing into Plant Physiology
If plants don’t get enough of one of these important elements, they can’t function correctly. Without carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen (from carbon dioxide
and water), plants can’t grow at all. And even though plants need smaller
amounts of minerals, even one missing mineral can cause a specific problem.
We list these problems and the mineral deficiencies they’re associated with
in Table 21-2.

Part V: It’s Not Easy Being Green: Plant Structure and Function

Transporting water and other
nutrients from the ground up
Several processes work together to transport water (as well as other nutrients) from where a plant absorbs it (the roots) upward through the rest of its
body. To understand how these processes work, you first need to know one
key feature of water: Water molecules tend to stick together, literally. Water
molecules are attracted to each other by weak electrical attractions called
hydrogen bonds. The stickiness of water helps keep the water molecules
together when you drink water through a straw — a process that’s very similar to one of the methods plants use to move water through their bodies.
Water moves from the soil, into a plant’s roots, and then throughout the
plant thanks to a combination of three processes:
✓ Osmosis: The method plants use to draw water from the soil into the
xylem cells in their roots is called osmosis. Root cells have a higher concentration of minerals than the soil they’re in, so during osmosis, water
flows toward the higher concentration of dissolved substances found in
the root cells. This intake of water increases pressure in the root cells
and pushes water into the plant’s xylem (see Chapter 20 for the full
scoop on plant structure).
✓ Capillary action: This causes liquids to rise up through the tubes in
the xylem of plants. This action results from adhesion (when two things
stick together), which is caused by the attraction between water molecules and the walls of the narrow tube. The adhesion forces water to be
pulled up the column of vessel elements in the xylem and in the tubules
in the cell wall.
✓ Transpiration and cohesion: Transpiration is the technical term for
the evaporation of water from plants. As water evaporates through the
stomates in the leaves (or any part of the plant exposed to air), it creates a negative pressure (also called tension or suction) in the leaves
and tissues of the xylem. The negative pressure in the leaves and xylem
exerts a pulling force on the water in the plant’s xylem and draws the
water upward. When water molecules stick to each other through cohesion (where like — as opposed to different — substances stick together),
they fill the column in the xylem and act as a huge single molecule of
water. As water evaporates from the plant through transpiration, the
rest of the water gets pulled up, causing the need for more water to be
pulled into the plant.
The back and forth of transpiration and cohesion is known as the
cohesion-tension theory. It’s similar to what happens when you suck
on a straw. The suction you apply to the straw is like the evaporation
from the leaves of the plant. Just like you can pull up a column of liquid
through your straw, a plant can pull up a column of liquid through its
xylem.

Chapter 21: Probing into Plant Physiology

Water plus sap equals . . . a dewdrop?
Those droplets of water that you see on a plant’s
leaves in the morning, what you think of as a
bunch of dewdrops, aren’t just water. They’re
a mixture of water and sap, a sugar solution
from the phloem (Chapter 20 describes this and
other elements of a plant’s structure). These

sap droplets are proof that water and minerals get pulled up from the soil and transported
throughout the entire plant. (We describe
how this occurs in the nearby “Transporting
water and other nutrients from the ground up”
section.)

Translocating sugars upward and
downward through the phloem
Phloem moves sap, a sticky solution containing sugars, water, minerals,
amino acids, and plant hormones throughout the plant via translocation, the
transport of dissolved materials in a plant. Unlike xylem, which can only
carry water upward, phloem carries sap upward and downward from sugar
sources to sugar sinks.
✓ Sugar sources are plant organs such as leaves that produce sugars.
✓ Sugar sinks are plant organs, such as roots, tubers, or bulbs, that consume or store sugars.
The specific way translocation works in a plant’s phloem is explained by the
pressure-flow theory, which we outline step by step in the following list:
1. First, sugars are loaded into phloem cells called sieve tube elements
within sugar sources, creating a high concentration of sugar at the
source.
The concentration of sugars in sink organs is much lower.
2. Water enters the sieve tube elements by osmosis.
During osmosis, water moves into the areas with the highest concentration of solutes (in this case, sugars).
3. The inflow of water increases pressure at the source, causing the
movement of water and carbohydrates toward the sieve tube elements
at a sugar sink.
You can think of this like turning on a water faucet that’s connected to
a garden hose. As water flows from the tank into the hose, it pushes the
water in front of it down the hose.

337

338

Part V: It’s Not Easy Being Green: Plant Structure and Function
4. Sugars are removed from cells at the sugar sink, keeping the concentration of sugars low.
As a sugar sink receives water and carbohydrates, pressure builds. But
before the sugar sink can turn into a sugar source, carbohydrates in a
sink are actively transported out of the sink and into needy plant cells.
As the carbohydrates are removed, the water then follows the solutes
and diffuses out of the cell, relieving the pressure.
Sugar sinks that store carbohydrates can become sugar sources for plants
when sugars are needed. Starch, a complex carbohydrate, is insoluble in
water, so it acts as a carbohydrate storage molecule. Whenever a plant needs
sugar, like at night or in the winter when photosynthesis doesn’t occur as well,
the plant can break down its starches into simple sugars, allowing a tissue
that would normally be a sugar sink to become a sugar source.
Because plant cells can act as both sinks and sources, and because phloem
transport goes both upward and downward, plants are pretty good at spreading the wealth of carbohydrates and fluid to where they’re needed. As long as
a plant has a continuous incoming source of minerals, water, carbon dioxide,
and light, it can fend for itself.

Controlling water loss
Because water is essential to a plant’s functioning, it has built-in mechanisms
that help prevent it from losing too much water: a cuticle and guard cells.
The cuticle is a layer of cells found on the top surfaces of a plant’s leaves (see
Figure 21-1). It lets light pass into the leaf but protects the leaf from losing
water. Many plants have cuticles that contain waxes that resist the movement of water into and out of a leaf, much like wax on your car keeps water
off the paint.
Guard cells are found on the bottom of a plant’s leaves, near a stomate, a tiny
opening that you can’t see with your naked eye. (An individual opening is
called a stomate, or stoma; several openings are called stomates, or stomata.)
Plants need to keep their stomates, shown in Figure 21-1, open in order to
obtain carbon dioxide for photosynthesis and release oxygen. However, if
the stomates are open too long or on a really hot day, the plant can lose too
much water. To prevent such water loss from happening, each stoma has two
guard cells surrounding it.
Guard cells can swell and contract in order to open and close the stomates.
When the Sun is shining and photosynthesis is occurring, guard cells swell up
with water like full balloons, which stretches them outward and opens the stomates. At night, when photosynthesis isn’t occurring, the guard cells release
some water and collapse together, closing the stomates.

Chapter 21: Probing into Plant Physiology

Aphids suck
Aphids, those tiny little insects that can destroy
your houseplants when you’re not looking, live
on the sap flowing through the phloem of a
plant. They have long, pointy structures called
stylets that let them suck sap right out of the
plant phloem. Insertion of the stylet doesn’t
harm the plant — in fact, aphids can go right
into a sieve tube without the plant “feeling” a
thing. An aphid can stay attached to a plant
for hours, sucking out the sap all the while. It’s
the loss of sap — and the cumulative effect of

Cuticle

many, many aphids on a plant — that causes
damage to a plant. The aphids fill up, leaving the
plant starved of its sugar mixture.
In an interesting twist, scientists have found
a way to use aphids to study transport in the
phloem. They allow aphids to attach to plants
and insert their stylets, and then they cut the
aphids away but leave the stylets embedded
in the plants. Materials flowing through the
phloem ooze out through the stylets and can be
collected by scientists for further study.

Part V: It’s Not Easy Being Green: Plant Structure and Function
Some plants that live in very hot, dry environments save water by opening
their stomates at night and storing carbon dioxide in their leaves. Then,
during the day when it’s hot and dry, they keep their stomates closed to conserve water, performing photosynthesis with the carbon dioxide they stored
during the night.

Sending Signals with Plant Hormones
Plant cells communicate with each other via messengers called hormones,
chemical signals produced by cells that act on target cells to control their
growth or development. Plant hormones control many of the plant behaviors you’re used to seeing, such as the ripening of fruit, the growth of shoots
upward and roots downward, the growth of plants toward the light, the dropping of leaves in the fall, and the growth and flowering of plants at particular
times of the year.
Five categories of hormones control plant growth and development:
✓ Auxins stimulate the elongation of cells in the plant stem and phototropism (the growth of plants toward light). If a plant receives equal light
on all sides, its stem grows straight. If light is uneven, then auxin moves
toward the darker side of the plant. This may seem backward, but when
the shady side of the stem grows, the stem, in its crookedness, actually
bends toward the light. This action keeps the leaves toward the light so
photosynthesis can continue.
✓ Gibberellins promote both cell division and cell elongation, causing
shoots to elongate so plants can grow taller and leaves can grow bigger.
They also signal buds and seeds to begin growing in the spring.
✓ Cytokinins stimulate cell division, promote leaf expansion, and slow
down the aging of leaves. Florists actually use them to help make cut
flowers last longer.
✓ Abscisic acid inhibits cell growth and can help prevent water loss by
triggering stomates to close. Plant nurseries use abscisic acid to keep
plants dormant during shipping.
✓ Ethylene stimulates the ripening of fruit and signals deciduous trees to
drop their leaves in the fall. Fruit growers use ethylene to partially ripen
fruit for sale.
Some of the flavor-making processes that occur in fruits happen while
the fruits are still on the plant. So, even though ethylene can trigger some
parts of ripening, like softening after a fruit has been picked, fruit that’s
picked unripe doesn’t taste as good as fruit that has ripened on the plant.
That’s why you can buy a big, beautiful tomato at the grocery store and
take it home only to discover that it doesn’t have much flavor — it was
probably picked unripe and then treated with ethylene.

Ten Great Biology Discoveries
In This Chapter
▶ Figuring out the secrets of DNA structure, cell processes, and more
▶ Experimenting to create vaccinations, antibiotics, and treatments for genetic defects

G

et ready to dive into ten of the most important biology discoveries to
date. We list them in no particular order because they’ve all made a
significant impact on the advancement of biology as a science and increased
what people know and understand about the living world.

Seeing the Unseen
Before 1675, people believed the only living things that existed were the
ones they could see. That year, a Dutch cloth merchant named Antony van
Leeuwenhoek discovered the microbial world by peering through a homemade microscope. Van Leeuwenhoek was the first person to see bacteria,
which he described as little animals that moved about here, there, and
everywhere. His discovery of a previously unseen universe not only turned
people’s worldviews inside out but also laid the foundation for the understanding that microbes cause disease.

Creating Penicillin, the First Antibiotic
People had very few tools to combat bacterial infections until Alexander
Fleming discovered the antibacterial properties of penicillin in 1928. Fleming
was studying a strain of staphylococcus bacteria when some of his petri
dishes became contaminated with Penicillium mold. To Fleming’s surprise,
wherever the Penicillium grew on the petri dish, the mold inhibited the
growth of the staphylococcus bacteria.

344

Part VI: The Part of Tens
The compound penicillin was purified from the mold and first used to treat
infections in soldiers during World War II. Soon after the war, the “miracle
drug” was used to treat infections in the general public, and the race to discover additional antibiotics was on.

Protecting People from Smallpox
Would you believe that the idea of vaccinating people against diseases such
as smallpox, measles, and mumps originated in ancient China? Healers there
ground up scabs taken from a smallpox survivor into a powder and blew this
dust into the nostrils of their patients. Gross as this may sound, these ancient
healers were actually inoculating their patients to help prevent the spread of
the disease.

Defining DNA Structure
James Watson and Francis Crick figured out how a code could be captured
in the structure of DNA molecules, opening the door to an understanding
of how DNA carries the blueprints for proteins. They proposed that DNA
is made of two nucleotide chains running in opposite directions and held
together by hydrogen bonds between the nitrogenous bases. Using metal
plates to represent the bases, they built a giant model of DNA that was
accepted as correct almost immediately.

Finding and Fighting Defective Genes
On August 24, 1989, scientists announced their discovery of the first known
cause of a genetic disease: They found a tiny deletion from a gene on
Chromosome 7 that resulted in the deadly genetic disease cystic fibrosis.
This identification of a genetic defect, and the realization that this defect
causes a disease, opened the floodgates of genetic research. Since that fateful day, the genes for other diseases, such as Huntington’s disease, inherited forms of breast cancer, sickle cell anemia, Down syndrome, Tay-Sachs
disease, hemophilia, and muscular dystrophy, have been found. Genetic
tests for these diseases are available to detect whether an unborn baby has
a defective gene or whether two potential parents would likely produce an
affected baby. And knowing what causes the diseases enables researchers to
focus on ways to possibly cure the diseases.

Chapter 22: Ten Great Biology Discoveries

Discovering Modern Genetic Principles
Gregor Mendel, a mid-19th century Austrian monk, used pea plants to perform the fundamental studies of heredity that serve as the basis for genetic
concepts to this day. Because pea plants have a number of readily observable traits — smooth peas versus wrinkled peas, tall plants versus short
plants, and so on — Mendel was able to observe the results of crosspollinating and growing various varieties of pea plants.
Through his experiments, Mendel was able to establish that genetic factors
are passed from parents to offspring and remain unchanged in the offspring
so that they can be passed on again to the next generation. Although his
work was done before the discovery of DNA and chromosomes, the genetic
principles of dominance, segregation, and independent assortment that
Mendel originally defined are still used to this day (and explained in detail in
Chapter 7).

Evolving the Theory of Natural Selection
Charles Darwin’s study of giant tortoises and finches on the Galapagos
Islands led to his famous theory of natural selection (also known as “survival of the fittest”), which he published in his 1859 book titled On the Origin
of Species. The main point of Darwin’s theory is that organisms with traits
that are better suited to the conditions in which they live are more likely to
survive and reproduce, passing on their traits to future generations. These
better-suited variations tend to thrive in the given area, whereas less-suited
variations of the same species either don’t do as well or just die off. Thus,
over time, the traits seen in a population of organisms in a given area can
change. The significance of Darwin’s theory of natural selection can be seen
today in the evolution of antibiotic-resistant strains of bacteria.

Formulating Cell Theory
In 1839, zoologist Theodor Schwann and botanist Matthias Schleiden were
talking at a dinner party about their research. As Schleiden described the
plant cells he’d been studying, Schwann was struck by their similarity to
animal cells. The similarity between the two types of cells led to the formation of cell theory, which consists of three main ideas:
✓ All living things are made of cells.
✓ The cell is the smallest unit of living things.
✓ All cells come from preexisting cells.

Moving Energy through the Krebs Cycle
The Krebs cycle, named for German-born British biochemist Sir Hans Adolf
Krebs, is the major metabolic process that occurs in all living organisms.
This process results in the transfer of energy to ATP, which all living things
use to fuel their cellular functions. Defining how organisms use energy at the
cellular level opened the door for further research on metabolic disorders
and diseases.

Amplifying DNA with PCR
In 1983, Kary Mullis discovered the polymerase chain reaction (PCR), a process that allows scientists to make numerous copies of DNA molecules that
they can then study. Today, PCR is used for
✓ Making lots of DNA for sequencing
✓ Finding and analyzing DNA from very small samples for use in forensics
✓ Detecting the presence of disease-causing microbes in human samples
✓ Producing numerous copies of genes for genetic engineering

Ten Ways Biology
Affects Your Life
In This Chapter
▶ Seeing how biology provides you with the essentials (food, clean water, and life)
▶ Discovering how humans manipulate organisms to create designer genes, medicines,

and more

S

ometimes science seems like something that happens in a lab somewhere far removed from everyday life. That may be, but the effects of
scientific research have a huge impact on your day-to-day existence, from the
food you eat to the energy that powers your home. Following is a rundown of
ten important ways that biology affects your life. Most are good; others aren’t
so good. Either way, you just may be surprised by a couple of them.

Keeping You Fed
First off, if plants didn’t produce their own food, you wouldn’t have anything
to eat — period. So you can thank the process of photosynthesis (covered
in Chapter 5) the next time you sit down to a luscious-looking salad or steak
dish.
What you may or may not be aware of is that plants aren’t the only organisms that make food. People do too. They make foods such as yogurt, cheese,
bread, sausages, pickles, tempeh, and more in part by fermenting bacteria
and yeast.

Putting Microbial Enzymes to Work
Microbes aren’t just for making foods; they have a wide variety of industrial
applications too. Manufacturers put bacterial enzymes in laundry detergent
to help break down greasy stains and meat tenderizers in meats to help break

348

Part VI: The Part of Tens
down proteins. If you take vitamin C, chances are that vitamin was produced
by a fungus. If you drink a protein shake regularly, the amino acids in that
shake probably also came from bacteria. So you see, not all microbes are to
be feared. Some of them actually improve your life by simplifying tasks and
keeping you healthy.

Designing Genes
The food you eat could very likely contain genetically modified organisms
(GMOs) — living things whose genes have been altered by scientists in order
to give them useful traits. For example, crop plants may be engineered to
better resist pests, and animals may be treated with hormones to increase
their growth or milk production.

Obtaining Fossil Fuels for Energy
The fossil fuels that power modern society are the remnants of photosynthesis from long ago. Way back in the Carboniferous period, about 350 million
years ago, green algae, plants, and bacteria harvested energy from the Sun
and transformed that light energy into the chemical energy stored in their
cells. When these living things died, they were deposited in such a way that
their remains converted into coal, natural gas, and oil.
Of course, people are now facing a problem as the reserves of these fossil
fuels start to run low. But maybe one solution to the problem lies in mimicking the green organisms that stockpiled this energy in the first place —
people could act like plants and go solar!

Causing and Treating Infectious Disease
Whenever you get sick from an infectious disease, such as a cold or strep
throat, you’re dealing with the reproduction of an alien invader. Your
immune system springs into action, activating the cells necessary to fight the
invasion and keep the infectious virus or bacteria from replicating itself any
further. Also, whenever you take an antibiotic, you’re taking a medicine made
by an organism such as a fungus or a bacterium.

Chapter 23: Ten Ways Biology Affects Your Life

Staying Alive
Every minute of every day, your cells are quietly working away, digesting your
food, sending signals that control your responses, transporting oxygen around
your body, contracting so you can move, and making all of your other bodily
processes happen. If your cells weren’t functioning, your tissues, organs, and
organ systems wouldn’t be either.

Providing You with Clean Water
You have wetlands to thank for the clean water you enjoy. Wetlands are areas
that are saturated by water most of the time. They act like natural sponges,
holding onto water and slowly filtering it around the plants that live there. As
water slowly filters through wetlands, plants and microorganisms have time
to absorb human wastes such as fertilizers and sewage, cleaning the water
and making it safer for humans and other animals to consume. All life on
Earth needs water — clean, fresh water — in order to be healthy, so wetlands
are pretty important to your quality of life. Unfortunately, wetlands are under
incredible pressure from development and oil exploration, and they’re disappearing at a rapid rate.
Another way living things help keep water clean is through sewage treatment.
Bacteria break down the organic matter in sewage, helping to clean the water
before it’s released back into the environment.

Changing Physically and Mentally
Chances are that at some point in your life you either were or will be “ruled”
by your hormones. Case in point: You meet someone you’re attracted to, signals cause hormones to be released, and suddenly your conscious mind isn’t
making all the decisions. If that example doesn’t convince you of the power
of hormones, just think back to puberty. During that time, your body went
through an incredible transformation based solely on the signals from these
potent chemical messengers.

Part VI: The Part of Tens

Creating Antibiotic-Resistant Bacteria
When people use antibiotics, the susceptible bacteria die first, leaving
behind the most resistant cells. These super-resistant cells multiply and take
over the available space. As this scenario repeats over time, populations of
bacteria eventually become resistant to antibiotics. This fact explains why
sometimes doctors don’t have the drugs to help people who are infected with
an antibiotic-resistant bacteria, such as MRSA (which stands for methicillinresistant Staphylococcus aureus).

Facing Extinction
Perhaps you don’t think about extinction much, but it’s something worth
being aware of. If you need an example, consider the case of polar bears. As
global temperatures rise, the polar ice is melting, leaving polar bears with
less and less habitat. Not quite so noticeable, but also endangered, are 1,900
other species of plants and animals.
As humans convert more land and resources to their own uses, less and less
habitat is available for the other organisms on Earth. Each species needs certain conditions and resources to thrive, and the sheer number of humans on
Earth is threatening to overwhelm many ecosystems. That spells bad news
for humans because we depend upon the health of ecosystems for our own
survival. For example, as humans develop coastal regions, we’re drastically
reducing the area of our estuaries, which are important breeding grounds for
many species of fish. This decrease in breeding grounds results in fewer fish
in the oceans, which is bad for marine life and people. (Up to 80 percent of
fish species that are harvested commercially spend some part of their lives in
estuaries.)
