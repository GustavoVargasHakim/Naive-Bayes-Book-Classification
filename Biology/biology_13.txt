1.1 The Earth, Humans, & the Environment

What is Environmental Science?
Environmental science is the dynamic, interdisciplinary study of the interaction of living and nonliving parts of the environment, with special focus on the impact of humans on the environment. The
study of environmental science includes circumstances, objects, or conditions by which an organism or
community is surrounded and the complex ways in which they interact.
Why Study Environmental Science?
The need for equitable, ethical, and sustainable use of Earth’s resources by a global population that
nears the carrying capacity of the planet requires us not only to understand how human behaviors affect
the environment, but also the scientific principles that govern interactions between the living and nonliving. Our future depends on our ability to understand and evaluate evidence-based arguments about the
environmental consequences of human actions and technologies, and to make informed decisions based
on those arguments.
From global climate change to habitat loss driven by human population growth and development,
Earth is becoming a different planet—right before our eyes. The global scale and rate of environmental
change are beyond anything in recorded human history. Our challenge is to acquire an improved
understanding of Earth’s complex environmental systems; systems characterized by interactions within
and among their natural and human components that link local to global and short-term to long-term
phenomena, and individual behavior to collective action. The complexity of environmental challenges
demands that we all participate in finding and implementing solutions leading to long-term
environmental sustainability.

Like other natural sciences, environmental science is a science that gathers knowledge about the
natural world. The methods of science include careful observation, record keeping, logical and
mathematical reasoning, experimentation, and submitting conclusions to the scrutiny of others. Science
also requires considerable imagination and creativity; a well-designed experiment is commonly
described as elegant or beautiful. Science has considerable practical implications and some science is
dedicated to practical applications, such as the prevention of disease (figure 2). Other science proceeds
largely motivated by curiosity. Whatever its goal, there is no doubt that science has transformed human
existence and will continue to do so.

The Nature of Science
Biology is a science, but what exactly is science?
What does the study of biology share with other
scientific disciplines? Science (from the Latin
scientia, meaning “knowledge”) can be defined as a
process of gaining knowledge about the natural
world.
Science is a very specific way of learning about
the world. The history of the past 500 years
demonstrates that science is a very powerful way
of gaining knowledge about the world; it is
largely responsible for the technological

phenomena, the phenomena of matter and energy,
and cannot be observed and measured.
The scientific method is a method of research with defined steps that include experiments and careful
observation. The steps of the scientific method will be examined in detail later, but one of the most
important aspects of this method is the testing of hypotheses. A hypothesis is an proposed explanatory
statement, for a given natural phenomenon, that can be tested. Hypotheses, or tentative explanations,
are different than a scientific theory. A scientific theory is a widely-accepted, thoroughly tested and
confirmed explanation for a set of observations or phenomena. Scientific theory is the foundation of
scientific knowledge. In addition, in many scientific disciplines (less so in biology) there are scientific
laws, often expressed in mathematical formulas, which describe how elements of nature will behave
under certain specific conditions, but they do not offer explanations for why they occur.
Natural Sciences
What would you expect to see in a museum of natural sciences? Frogs? Plants? Dinosaur skeletons?
Exhibits about how the brain functions? A planetarium? Gems and minerals? Or maybe all of the
above? Science includes such diverse fields as astronomy, computer sciences, psychology,biology, and
mathematics. However, those fields of science related to the physical world and its phenomena and
processes are considered natural sciences and include the disciplines of physics, geology, biology,
and chemistry. Environmental science is a cross-disciplinary natural science because it relies of the
disciplines of chemistry, biology, and geology.
Scientific Inquiry
One thing is common to all forms of science: an ultimate goal to know. Curiosity and inquiry are the

Environmental Biology 9

driving forces for the development of science. Scientists seek to understand the world and the way it
operates. Two methods of logical thinking are used: inductive reasoning and deductive reasoning.
Inductive reasoning is a form of logical thinking that uses related observations to arrive at a
general conclusion. This type of reasoning is common in descriptive science. A life scientist such
as a biologist makes observations and records them. These data can be qualitative (descriptive) or
quantitative (consisting of numbers), and the raw data can be supplemented with drawings, pictures,
photos, or videos. From many observations, the scientist can infer conclusions (inductions) based on
evidence. Inductive reasoning involves formulating generalizations inferred from careful observation
and the analysis of a large amount of data. Brain studies often work this way. Many brains are
observed while people are doing a task. The part of the brain that lights up, indicating activity, is then
demonstrated to be the part controlling the response to that task.
Deductive reasoning or deduction is the type of logic used in hypothesis-based science. In deductive
reasoning, the pattern of thinking moves in the opposite direction as compared to inductive
reasoning. Deductive reasoning is a form of logical thinking that uses a general principle or law to
forecast specific results. From those general principles, a scientist can extrapolate and predict the
specific results that would be valid as long as the general principles are valid. For example, a prediction
would be that if the climate is becoming warmer in a region, the distribution of plants and animals should
change. Comparisons have been made between distributions in the past and the present, and the many
changes that have been found are consistent with a warming climate. Finding the change in distribution
is evidence that the climate change conclusion is a valid one.
Both types of logical thinking are related to the two main pathways of scientific study: descriptive
science and hypothesis-based science. Descriptive (or discovery) science aims to observe, explore, and
discover, while hypothesis-based science begins with a specific question or problem and a potential
answer or solution that can be tested. The boundary between these two forms of study is often blurred,
because most scientific endeavors combine both approaches. Observations lead to questions, questions
lead to forming a hypothesis as a possible answer to those questions, and then the hypothesis is tested.
Thus, descriptive science and hypothesis-based science are in continuous dialogue.
“Scientists have become the bearers of the torch of discovery in our quest for knowledge.” –
Stephen Hawking and Leonard Mlodinov, in The Grand Design (2010), Bantam Books
Hypothesis Testing
Biologists study the living world by posing questions about it and seeking science-based responses.
This approach is common to other sciences as well and is often referred to as the scientific method.
The scientific method was used even in ancient times, but it was first documented by England’s Sir
Francis Bacon (1561–1626) who set up inductive methods for scientific inquiry. The scientific method
is not exclusively used by biologists but can be applied to almost anything as a logical problem-solving
method.

10 Matthew R. Fisher, Editor

The scientific process typically starts with an observation (often a
problem to be solved) that leads to a question. Let’s think about a
simple problem that starts with an observation and apply the scientific
method to solve the problem. One Monday morning, a student arrives
at class and quickly discovers that the classroom is too warm. That is
an observation that also describes a problem: the classroom is too
warm. The student then asks a question: “Why is the classroom so
warm?”
Recall that a hypothesis is a suggested explanation that can be
tested. To solve a problem, several hypotheses may be proposed. For
example, one hypothesis might be, “The classroom is warm because
no one turned on the air conditioning.” But there could be other
responses to the question, and therefore other hypotheses may be
proposed. A second hypothesis might be, “The classroom is warm
because there is a power failure, and so the air conditioning doesn’t
work.”
Once a hypothesis has been selected, a prediction may be made. A
prediction is similar to a hypothesis but it typically has the format “If .
Figure 3. Sir Francis Bacon is
. . then . . . .” For example, the prediction for the first hypothesis might
credited with being the first to
be, “If the student turns on the air conditioning, then the classroom
document the scientific method.
will no longer be too warm.”
A hypothesis must be testable to ensure that it is valid. For example,
a hypothesis that depends on what a bear thinks is not testable, because it can never be known what a
bear thinks. It should also be falsifiable, meaning that it can be disproven by experimental results. An
example of an unfalsifiable hypothesis is “Botticelli’s Birth of Venus is beautiful.” There is no
experiment that might show this statement to be false. To test a hypothesis, a researcher will conduct one
or more experiments designed to eliminate one or more of the hypotheses. This is important. A
hypothesis can be disproven, or eliminated, but it can never be proven. Science does not deal in proofs
like mathematics. If an experiment fails to disprove a hypothesis, then we find support for that
explanation, but this is not to say that down the road a better explanation will not be found, or a more
carefully designed experiment will be found to falsify the hypothesis.
Each experiment will have one or more variables and one or more controls.
Experimental variables are any part of the experiment that can vary or change during the experiment.
Controlled variables are parts of the experiment that do not change. Lastly, experiments might have a
control group: a group of test subjects that are as similar as possible to all other test subjects, with the
exception that they don’t receive the experimental treatment (those that do receive it are known as the
experimental group). For example, in a study testing a weight-loss drug, the control group would be
test subjects that don’t receive the drug (but they might receive a placebo, such as sugar pill, instead).
Look for these various things in the example that follows:
An experiment might be conducted to test the hypothesis that phosphate (a nutrient) promotes the
growth of algae in freshwater ponds. A series of artificial ponds are filled with water and half of them
are treated by adding phosphate each week, while the other half are treated by adding a non-nutritional
mineral that is not used by algae. The experimental variable here is presence/absence of a nutrient
(phosphate). One potential controlled variable would be the volume of water in each tank. The amount of
water that algae have access to may influence the results, thus researchers want to control its influence on
the results by making sure all test subjects get the same amount. The control group consists of the tanks
that received a placebo (non-nutritional mineral) instead of the phosphate. If the ponds with phosphate

Environmental Biology 11

show more algal growth, then we have found support for the hypothesis. If they do not, then we reject
our hypothesis. Be aware that rejecting one hypothesis does not determine whether or not the other
hypotheses can be accepted; it simply eliminates one hypothesis that is not valid (Figure 3). Using the
scientific method, the hypotheses that are inconsistent with experimental data are rejected.

Figure 4. The scientific method is a series of defined steps
that include experiments and careful observation. If a
hypothesis is not supported by data, a new hypothesis can
be proposed.

In the example below, the scientific method is used to solve an everyday problem. Which part in the
example below is the hypothesis? Which is the prediction? Based on the results of the experiment, is the
hypothesis supported? If it is not supported, propose some alternative hypotheses.
1. My toaster doesn’t toast my bread.
2. Why doesn’t my toaster work?
3. There is something wrong with the electrical outlet.
4. If something is wrong with the outlet, my coffeemaker also won’t work when plugged into it.

12 Matthew R. Fisher, Editor

5. I plug my coffeemaker into the outlet.
6. My coffeemaker works.
In practice, the scientific method is not as rigid and structured as it might at first appear. Sometimes an
experiment leads to conclusions that favor a change in approach; often, an experiment brings entirely
new scientific questions to the puzzle. Many times, science does not operate in a linear fashion; instead,
scientists continually draw inferences and make generalizations, finding patterns as their research
proceeds. Scientific reasoning is more complex than the scientific method alone suggests.
Basic and Applied Science
Is it valuable to pursue science for the sake of simply gaining knowledge, or does scientific knowledge
only have worth if we can apply it to solving a specific problem or bettering our lives? This question
focuses on the differences between two types of science: basic science and applied science.
Basic science or “pure” science seeks to expand knowledge regardless of the short-term application of
that knowledge. It is not focused on developing a product or a service of immediate public or commercial
value. The immediate goal of basic science is knowledge for knowledge’s sake, though this does not
mean that in the end it may not result in an application.
In contrast, applied science aims to use science to solve real-world problems, such as improving crop
yield, find a cure for a particular disease, or save animals threatened by a natural disaster. In applied
science, the problem is usually defined for the researcher.
Some individuals may perceive applied science as “useful” and basic science as “useless.” A question
these people might pose to a scientist advocating knowledge acquisition would be, “What for?” A
careful look at the history of science, however, reveals that basic knowledge has resulted in many
remarkable applications of great value. Many scientists think that a basic understanding of science is
necessary before an application is developed; therefore, applied science relies on the results generated
through basic science. Other scientists think that it is time to move on from basic science and instead
to find solutions to actual problems. Both approaches are valid. It is true that there are problems that
demand immediate attention; however, few solutions would be found without the help of the knowledge
generated through basic science.
One example of how basic and applied science can work together to solve practical problems occurred
after the discovery of DNA structure led to an understanding of the molecular mechanisms governing
DNA replication. Strands of DNA, unique in every human, are found in our cells, where they provide
the instructions necessary for life. During DNA replication, new copies of DNA are made, shortly
before a cell divides to form new cells. Understanding the mechanisms of DNA replication (through
basic science) enabled scientists to develop laboratory techniques that are now used to identify genetic
diseases, pinpoint individuals who were at a crime scene, and determine paternity (all examples of
applied science). Without basic science, it is unlikely that applied science would exist.
Another example of the link between basic and applied research is the Human Genome Project, a
study in which each human chromosome was analyzed and mapped to determine the precise sequence of
the DNA code and the exact location of each gene. (The gene is the basic unit of heredity; an individual’s
complete collection of genes is his or her genome.) Other organisms have also been studied as part of
this project to gain a better understanding of human chromosomes. The Human Genome Project (Figure
5) relied on basic research carried out with non-human organisms and, later, with the human genome.
An important end goal eventually became using the data for applied research seeking cures for genetic
diseases.

Environmental Biology 13

Scientific Work is Transparent & Open to Critique
Whether scientific research is basic science or applied science,
scientists must share their findings for other researchers to expand
and build upon their discoveries. For this reason, an important
aspect of a scientist’s work is disseminating results and
communicating with peers. Scientists can share results by
presenting them at a scientific meeting or conference, but this
approach can reach only the limited few who are present. Instead,
most scientists present their results in peer-reviewed articles that
are published in scientific journals. Peer-reviewed articles are
scientific papers that are reviewed, usually anonymously by a
scientist’s colleagues, or peers. These colleagues are qualified Figure 5. The Human Genome Project
individuals, often experts in the same research area, who judge was a 13-year collaborative effort
whether or not the scientist’s work is suitable for publication. The among researchers working in several
process of peer review helps to ensure that the research described different fields of science. The project

different conditions to expand on the findings. The experimental
results must be consistent with the findings of other scientists.
As you review scientific information, whether in an academic setting or as part of your day-to-day
life, it is important to think about the credibility of that information. You might ask yourself: has this
scientific information been through the rigorous process of peer review? Are the conclusions based
on available data and accepted by the larger scientific community? Scientists are inherently skeptical,
especially if conclusions are not supported by evidence (and you should be too).

1.3 Environment & Sustainability

Introduction to Sustainability
This section introduces the concept of sustainability, which refers to the sociopolitical, scientific, and
cultural challenges of living within the means of the earth without significantly impairing its function.
Taking The Long View: Sustainability in Evolutionary and Ecological Perspective
Of the different forms of life that have inhabited the Earth in its three to four billion year history, 99.9%
are now extinct. Against this backdrop, the human enterprise with its roughly 200,000-year history
barely merits attention. As the American novelist Mark Twain once remarked, if our planet’s history
were to be compared to the Eiffel Tower, human history would be a mere smear on the very tip of
the tower. But while modern humans (Homo sapiens) might be insignificant in geologic time, we are
by no means insignificant in terms of our recent planetary impact. A 1986 study estimated that 40%
of the product of terrestrial plant photosynthesis — the basis of the food chain for most animal and
bird life — was being appropriated by humans for their use. More recent studies estimate that 25% of
photosynthesis on continental shelves (coastal areas) is ultimately being used to satisfy human demand.
Human appropriation of such natural resources is having a profound impact upon the wide diversity of
other species that also depend on them.
Evolution normally results in the generation of new lifeforms at a rate that outstrips the extinction of
other species; this results in strong biological diversity. However, scientists have evidence that, for the
first observable time in evolutionary history, another species — Homo sapiens — has upset this balance
to the degree that the rate of species extinction is now estimated at 10,000 times the rate of species
renewal. Human beings, just one species among millions, are crowding out the other species we share
the planet with. Evidence of human interference with the natural world is visible in practically every
ecosystem from the presence of pollutants in the stratosphere to the artificially changed courses of the
majority of river systems on the planet. It is argued that ever since we abandoned nomadic, gathererhunter ways of life for settled societies some 12,000 years ago, humans have continually manipulated
their natural world to meet their needs. While this observation is a correct one, the rate, scale, and the
nature of human-induced global change — particularly in the post-industrial period — is unprecedented
in the history of life on Earth.
There are three primary reasons for this:
Firstly, mechanization of both industry and agriculture in the last century resulted in vastly improved
labor productivity which enabled the creation of goods and services. Since then, scientific advance and
technological innovation — powered by ever-increasing inputs of fossil fuels and their derivatives —
have revolutionized every industry and created many new ones. The subsequent development of western
consumer culture, and the satisfaction of the accompanying disposable mentality, has generated material
flows of an unprecedented scale. The Wuppertal Institute estimates that humans are now responsible for
moving greater amounts of matter across the planet than all natural occurrences (earthquakes, storms,
etc.) put together.
Secondly, the sheer size of the human population is unprecedented. Every passing year adds another
15

16 Matthew R. Fisher, Editor

90 million people to the planet. Even though the environmental impact varies significantly between
countries (and within them), the exponential growth in human numbers, coupled with rising material
expectations in a world of limited resources, has catapulted the issue of distribution to prominence.
Global inequalities in resource consumption and purchasing power mark the clearest dividing line
between the haves and the have-nots. It has become apparent that present patterns of production and
consumption are unsustainable for a global population that is projected to reach between 12 billion by
the year 2050. If ecological crises and rising social conflict are to countered, the present rates of overconsumption by a rich minority, and under-consumption by a large majority, will have to be brought into
balance.
Thirdly, it is not only the rate and the scale of change but the nature of that change that is
unprecedented. Human inventiveness has introduced chemicals and materials into the environment
which either do not occur naturally at all, or do not occur in the ratios in which we have introduced them.
These persistent chemical pollutants are believed to be causing alterations in the environment, the effects
of which are only slowly manifesting themselves, and the full scale of which is beyond calculation. CFCs
and PCBs are but two examples of the approximately 100,000 chemicals currently in global circulation.
(Between 500 and 1,000 new chemicals are being added to this list annually.) The majority of these
chemicals have not been tested for their toxicity on humans and other life forms, let alone tested for their
effects in combination with other chemicals. These issues are now the subject of special UN and other
intergovernmental working groups.
The Evolution of Sustainability Itself
Our Common Future (1987), the report of the World Commission on Environment and Development, is
widely credited with having popularized the concept of sustainable development. It defines sustainable
development in the following ways…
• …development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future
generations to meet their own needs.
• … sustainable development is not a fixed state of harmony, but rather a process of change in
which the exploitation of resources, the orientation of the technological development, and
institutional change are made consistent with future as well as present needs.
The concept of sustainability, however, can be traced back much farther to the oral histories of
indigenous cultures. For example, the principle of inter-generational equity is captured in the Inuit
saying, ‘we do not inherit the Earth from our parents, we borrow it from our children’. The Native
American ‘Law of the Seventh Generation’ is another illustration. According to this, before any major
action was to be undertaken its potential consequences on the seventh generation had to be considered.
For a species that at present is only 6,000 generations old and whose current political decision-makers
operate on time scales of months or few years at most, the thought that other human cultures have
based their decision-making systems on time scales of many decades seems wise but unfortunately
inconceivable in the current political climate.
Environmental Equity
While much progress is being made to improve resource efficiency, far less progress has been made
to improve resource distribution. Currently, just one-fifth of the global population is consuming three-

Environmental Biology 17

quarters of the earth’s resources (Figure 1). If the remaining four-fifths were to exercise their right to
grow to the level of the rich minority it would result in ecological devastation. So far, global income
inequalities and lack of purchasing power have prevented poorer countries from reaching the standard
of living (and also resource consumption/waste emission) of the industrialized countries.

Countries such as China, Brazil, India, and Malaysia are, however, catching up fast. In such a
situation, global consumption of resources and energy needs to be drastically reduced to a point where
it can be repeated by future generations. But who will do the reducing? Poorer nations want to produce
and consume more. Yet so do richer countries: their economies demand ever greater consumption-based
expansion. Such stalemates have prevented any meaningful progress towards equitable and sustainable
resource distribution at the international level. These issue of fairness and distributional justice remain
unresolved.

Concepts in Environmental Science
The ecological footprint (EF), developed by Canadian ecologist and planner William Rees, is basically
an accounting tool that uses land as the unit of measurement to assess per capita consumption,
production, and discharge needs. It starts from the assumption that every category of energy and material
consumption and waste discharge requires the productive or absorptive capacity of a finite area of land
or water. If we (add up) all the land requirements for all categories of consumption and waste discharge
by a defined population, the total area represents the Ecological Footprint of that population on Earth
whether or not this area coincides with the population’s home region.
Land is used as the unit of measurement for the simple reason that, according to Rees, “Land area
not only captures planet Earth’s finiteness, it can also be seen as a proxy for numerous essential life
support functions from gas exchange to nutrient recycling … land supports photosynthesis, the energy

18 Matthew R. Fisher, Editor

conduit for the web of life. Photosynthesis sustains all important food chains and maintains the structural
integrity of ecosystems.”
What does the ecological footprint tell us? Ecological footprint analysis can tell us in a vivid, ready-tograsp manner how much of the Earth’s environmental functions are needed to support human activities.
It also makes visible the extent to which consumer lifestyles and behaviors are ecologically sustainable
calculated that the ecological footprint of the average American is – conservatively – 5.1 hectares per
capita of productive land. With roughly 7.4 billion hectares of the planet’s total surface area of 51 billion
hectares available for human consumption, if the current global population were to adopt American
consumer lifestyles we would need two additional planets to produce the resources, absorb the wastes,
and provide general life-support functions.
The precautionary principle is an important concept in environmental sustainability. A 1998
consensus statement characterized the precautionary principle this way: “when an activity raises threats
of harm to human health or the environment, precautionary measures should be taken even if some cause
and effect relationships are not fully established scientifically”. For example, if a new pesticide chemical
is created, the precautionary principle would dictate that we presume, for the sake of safety, that the
chemical may have potential negative consequences for the environment and/or human health, even if
such consequences have not been proven yet. In other words, it is best to proceed cautiously in the face
of incomplete knowledge about something’s potential harm.
Some Indicators of Global Environmental Stress
Forests — Deforestation remains a main issue. 1 million hectares of forest were lost every year in the
decade 1980-1990. The largest losses of forest area are taking place in the tropical moist deciduous
forests, the zone best suited to human settlement and agriculture. Recent estimates suggest that nearly
two-thirds of tropical deforestation is due to farmers clearing land for agriculture. There is increasing
concern about the decline in forest quality associated with intensive use of forests and unregulated
access.
Soil — As much as 10% of the earth’s vegetated surface is now at least moderately degraded. Trends in
soil quality and management of irrigated land raise serious questions about longer-term sustainability. It
is estimated that about 20% of the world’s 250 million hectares of irrigated land are already degraded to
the point where crop production is seriously reduced.
Fresh Water — Some 20% of the world’s population lacks access to safe water and 50% lacks access to
safe sanitation. If current trends in water use persist, two-thirds of the world’s population could be living
in countries experiencing moderate or high water stress by 2025.
Marine fisheries — 25% of the world’s marine fisheries are being fished at their maximum level of
productivity and 35% are overfished (yields are declining). In order to maintain current per capita
consumption of fish, global fish harvests must be increased; much of the increase might come through
aquaculture which is a known source of water pollution, wetland loss and mangrove swamp destruction.
Biodiversity — Biodiversity is increasingly coming under threat from development, which destroys or
degrades natural habitats, and from pollution from a variety of sources. The first comprehensive global
assessment of biodiversity put the total number of species at close to 14 million and found that between
1% and 11% of the world’s species may be threatened by extinction every decade. Coastal ecosystems,

Environmental Biology 19

which host a very large proportion of marine species, are at great risk with perhaps one-third of the
world’s coasts at high potential risk of degradation and another 17% at moderate risk.
Atmosphere — The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change has established that human activities
are having a discernible influence on global climate. CO2 emissions in most industrialized countries
have risen during the past few years and countries generally failed to stabilize their greenhouse gas
emissions at 1990 levels by 2000 as required by the Climate Change convention.
Toxic chemicals — About 100,000 chemicals are now in commercial use and their potential impacts
on human health and ecological function represent largely unknown risks. Persistent organic pollutants
are now so widely distributed by air and ocean currents that they are found in the tissues of people
and wildlife everywhere; they are of particular concern because of their high levels of toxicity and
persistence in the environment.
Hazardous wastes — Pollution from heavy metals, especially from their use in industry and mining, is
also creating serious health consequences in many parts of the world. Incidents and accidents involving
uncontrolled radioactive sources continue to increase, and particular risks are posed by the legacy of
contaminated areas left from military activities involving nuclear materials.
Waste — Domestic and industrial waste production continues to increase in both absolute and per capita
terms, worldwide. In the developed world, per capita waste generation has increased threefold over the
past 20 years; in developing countries, it is highly likely that waste generation will double during the
next decade. The level of awareness regarding the health and environmental impacts of inadequate waste
disposal remains rather poor; poor sanitation and waste management infrastructure is still one of the
principal causes of death and disability for the urban poor.

1.4 Environmental Ethics

Frontier Ethic
The ways in which humans interact with the land and its natural resources are determined by ethical
attitudes and behaviors. Early European settlers in North America rapidly consumed the natural
resources of the land. After they depleted one area, they moved westward to new frontiers. Their attitude
towards the land was that of a frontier ethic. A frontier ethic assumes that the earth has an unlimited
supply of resources. If resources run out in one area, more can be found elsewhere or alternatively human
ingenuity will find substitutes. This attitude sees humans as masters who manage the planet. The frontier
ethic is completely anthropocentric (human-centered), for only the needs of humans are considered.
Most industrialized societies experience population and economic growth that are based upon this
frontier ethic, assuming that infinite resources exist to support continued growth indefinitely. In fact,
economic growth is considered a measure of how well a society is doing. The late economist Julian
Simon pointed out that life on earth has never been better, and that population growth means more
creative minds to solve future problems and give us an even better standard of living. However, now that
the human population has passed seven billion and few frontiers are left, many are beginning to question
the frontier ethic. Such people are moving toward an environmental ethic, which includes humans as
part of the natural community rather than managers of it. Such an ethic places limits on human activities
(e.g., uncontrolled resource use), that may adversely affect the natural community.
Some of those still subscribing to the frontier ethic suggest that outer space may be the new frontier. If
we run out of resources (or space) on earth, they argue, we can simply populate other planets. This seems
an unlikely solution, as even the most aggressive colonization plan would be incapable of transferring
people to extraterrestrial colonies at a significant rate. Natural population growth on earth would outpace
the colonization effort. A more likely scenario would be that space could provide the resources (e.g.
from asteroid mining) that might help to sustain human existence on earth.

Sustainable Ethic
A sustainable ethic is an environmental ethic by which people treat the earth as if its resources are
limited. This ethic assumes that the earth’s resources are not unlimited and that humans must use and
conserve resources in a manner that allows their continued use in the future. A sustainable ethic also
assumes that humans are a part of the natural environment and that we suffer when the health of a natural
ecosystem is impaired. A sustainable ethic includes the following tenets:
• The earth has a limited supply of resources.
• Humans must conserve resources.
• Humans share the earth’s resources with other living things.
• Growth is not sustainable.
• Humans are a part of nature.
21

22 Matthew R. Fisher, Editor

• Humans are affected by natural laws.
• Humans succeed best when they maintain the integrity of natural processes sand cooperate
with nature.
For example, if a fuel shortage occurs, how can the problem be solved in a way that is consistent
with a sustainable ethic? The solutions might include finding new ways to conserve oil or developing
renewable energy alternatives. A sustainable ethic attitude in the face of such a problem would be that
if drilling for oil damages the ecosystem, then that damage will affect the human population as well. A
sustainable ethic can be either anthropocentric or biocentric (life-centered). An advocate for conserving
oil resources may consider all oil resources as the property of humans. Using oil resources wisely so
that future generations have access to them is an attitude consistent with an anthropocentric ethic. Using
resources wisely to prevent ecological damage is in accord with a biocentric ethic.

Land Ethic
Aldo Leopold, an American wildlife natural historian and philosopher, advocated a biocentric ethic in
his book, A Sand County Almanac. He suggested that humans had always considered land as property,
just as ancient Greeks considered slaves as property. He believed that mistreatment of land (or of slaves)
makes little economic or moral sense, much as today the concept of slavery is considered immoral. All
humans are merely one component of an ethical framework. Leopold suggested that land be included in
an ethical framework, calling this the land ethic.
“The land ethic simply enlarges the boundary of the community to include soils, waters, plants and
animals; or collectively, the land. In short, a land ethic changes the role of Homo sapiens from conqueror
of the land-community to plain member and citizen of it. It implies respect for his fellow members, and
also respect for the community as such.” (Aldo Leopold, 1949)
Leopold divided conservationists into two groups: one group that regards the soil as a commodity
and the other that regards the land as biota, with a broad interpretation of its function. If we apply this
idea to the field of forestry, the first group of conservationists would grow trees like cabbages, while the
second group would strive to maintain a natural ecosystem. Leopold maintained that the conservation
movement must be based upon more than just economic necessity. Species with no discernible economic
value to humans may be an integral part of a functioning ecosystem. The land ethic respects all parts
of the natural world regardless of their utility, and decisions based upon that ethic result in more stable
biological communities.
“Anything is right when it tends to preserve the integrity, stability and beauty of the biotic community.
It is wrong when it tends to do otherwise.” (Aldo Leopold, 1949)
Hetch Hetchy Valley
In 1913, the Hetch Hetchy Valley – located in Yosemite National Park in California – was the site of a
conflict between two factions, one with an anthropocentric ethic and the other, a biocentric ethic. As the
last American frontiers were settled, the rate of forest destruction started to concern the public.

Environmental Biology 23

Figure 1. Yosemite valley, California, USA.

The
conservation
movement
gained
momentum, but quickly broke into two factions.
One faction, led by Gifford Pinchot, Chief
Forester under Teddy Roosevelt, advocated
utilitarian conservation (i.e., conservation of
resources for the good of the public). The other
faction,
led
by
John
Muir,
advocated preservation of forests and other
wilderness for their inherent value. Both groups
rejected the first tenet of frontier ethics, the
assumption that resources are limitless. However,
the conservationists agreed with the rest of the
tenets of frontier ethics, while the preservationists
agreed with the tenets of the sustainable ethic.

The Hetch Hetchy Valley was part of a protected
National Park, but after the devastating fires of the 1906 San Francisco earthquake, residents of San
Francisco wanted to dam the valley to provide their city with a stable supply of water. Gifford Pinchot
favored the dam.
“As to my attitude regarding the proposed use of Hetch Hetchy by the city of San Francisco…I am
fully persuaded that… the injury…by substituting a lake for the present swampy floor of the valley…is
altogether unimportant compared with the benefits to be derived from it’s use as a reservoir.
“The fundamental principle of the whole conservation policy is that of use, to take every part of the
land and its resources and put it to that use in which it will serve the most people.” (Gifford Pinchot,
1913)
John Muir, the founder of the Sierra Club and a great lover of wilderness, led the fight against the
dam. He saw wilderness as having an intrinsic value, separate from its utilitarian value to people. He
advocated preservation of wild places for their inherent beauty and for the sake of the creatures that live
there. The issue aroused the American public, who were becoming increasingly alarmed at the growth of
cities and the destruction of the landscape for the sake of commercial enterprises. Key senators received
thousands of letters of protest.
“These temple destroyers, devotees of ravaging commercialism, seem to have a perfect contempt for
Nature, and instead of lifting their eyes to the God of the Mountains, lift them to the Almighty Dollar.”
(John Muir, 1912)
Despite public protest, Congress voted to dam the valley. The preservationists lost the fight for the
Hetch Hetchy Valley, but their questioning of traditional American values had some lasting effects. In
1916, Congress passed the “National Park System Organic Act,” which declared that parks were to be
maintained in a manner that left them unimpaired for future generations. As we use our public lands, we
continue to debate whether we should be guided by preservationism or conservationism.

The Tragedy of the Commons
In his essay, The Tragedy of the Commons, Garrett Hardin (1968) looked at what happens when humans
do not limit their actions by including the land as part of their ethic. The tragedy of the commons
develops in the following way: Imagine a pasture open to all (the ‘commons’). It is to be expected that
each herdsman will try to keep as many cattle as possible on the commons. As rational beings, each

24 Matthew R. Fisher, Editor

herdsman seeks to maximize their gain. Adding more cattle increases their profit, and they do not suffer
any immediate negative consequence because the commons are shared by all. The rational herdsman
concludes that the only sensible course is to add another animal to their herd, and then another, and
so forth. However, this same conclusion is reached by each and every rational herdsman sharing the
commons. Therein lies the tragedy: each person is locked into a system that compels them to increase
their herd, without limit, in a world that is limited. Eventually this leads to the ruination of the commons.
In a society that believes in the freedom of the commons, freedom brings ruin to all because each person
acts selfishly.
Hardin went on to apply the situation to modern commons: overgrazing of public lands, overuse of
public forests and parks, depletion of fish populations in the ocean, use of rivers as a common dumping
ground for sewage, and fouling the air with pollution.
The “Tragedy of the Commons” is applicable to what is arguably the most consequential
environmental problem: global climate change. The atmosphere is a commons into which countries are
dumping carbon dioxide from the burning of fossil fuels. Although we know that the generation of
greenhouse gases will have damaging effects upon the entire globe, we continue to burn fossil fuels. As
a country, the immediate benefit from the continued use of fossil fuels is seen as a positive component
(because of economic growth). All countries, however, will share the negative long-term effects.

1.5 Environmental Justice & Indigenous Struggles

Environmental Justice
Environmental Justice is defined as the fair treatment and meaningful involvement of all people
regardless of race, color, national origin, or income with respect to the development, implementation,
and enforcement of environmental laws, regulations, and policies. It will be achieved when everyone
enjoys the same degree of protection from environmental and health hazards and equal access to the
decision-making process to have a healthy environment in which to live, learn, and work.
During the 1980’s minority groups protested that hazardous waste sites were preferentially sited in
minority neighborhoods. In 1987, Benjamin Chavis of the United Church of Christ Commission for
Racism and Justice coined the term environmental racism to describe such a practice. The charges
generally failed to consider whether the facility or the demography of the area came first. Most
hazardous waste sites are located on property that was used as disposal sites long before modern
facilities and disposal methods were available. Areas around such sites are typically depressed
economically, often as a result of past disposal activities. Persons with low incomes are often
constrained to live in such undesirable, but affordable, areas. The problem more likely resulted from
one of insensitivity rather than racism. Indeed, the ethnic makeup of potential disposal facilities was
most likely not considered when the sites were chosen.
Decisions in citing hazardous waste facilities are generally made on the basis of economics,
geological suitability and the political climate. For example, a site must have a soil type and geological
profile that prevents hazardous materials from moving into local aquifers. The cost of land is also an
important consideration. The high cost of buying land would make it economically unfeasible to build a
hazardous waste site in Beverly Hills. Some communities have seen a hazardous waste facility as a way
of improving their local economy and quality of life. Emelle County, Alabama had illiteracy and infant
mortality rates that were among the highest in the nation. A landfill constructed there provided jobs and
revenue that ultimately helped to reduce both figures.
In an ideal world, there would be no hazardous waste facilities, but we do not live in an ideal world.
Unfortunately, we live in a world plagued by rampant pollution and dumping of hazardous waste. Our
industrialized society has necessarily produced wastes during the manufacture of products for our basic
needs. Until technology can find a way to manage (or eliminate) hazardous waste, disposal facilities
will be necessary to protect both humans and the environment. By the same token, this problem must
be addressed. Industry and society must become more socially sensitive in the selection of future
hazardous waste sites. All humans who help produce hazardous wastes must share the burden of
dealing with those wastes, not just the poor and minorities.

Indigenous People
Since the end of the 15th century, most of the world’s frontiers have been claimed and colonized by
established nations. Invariably, these conquered frontiers were home to people indigenous to those
regions. Some were wiped out or assimilated by the invaders, while others survived while trying to
25

26 Matthew R. Fisher, Editor

maintain their unique cultures and way of life. The United Nations officially classifies indigenous
people as those “having an historical continuity with pre-invasion and pre-colonial societies,” and
“consider themselves distinct from other sectors of the societies now prevailing in those territories or
parts of them.” Furthermore, indigenous people are “determined to preserve, develop and transmit to
future generations, their ancestral territories, and their ethnic identity, as the basis of their continued
existence as peoples in accordance with their own cultural patterns, social institutions and legal
systems.” A few of the many groups of indigenous people around the world are: the many tribes of
Native Americans (i.e., Navajo, Sioux) in the contiguous 48 states, the Inuit of the arctic region from
Siberia to Canada, the rainforest tribes in Brazil, and the Ainu of northern Japan.
Many problems face indigenous people including the lack of human rights, exploitation of their
traditional lands and themselves, and degradation of their culture. In response to the problems faced by
these people, the United Nations proclaimed an “International Decade of the World’s Indigenous
People” beginning in 1994. The main objective of this proclamation, according to the United Nations,
is “the strengthening of international cooperation for the solution of problems faced by indigenous
people in such areas as human rights, the environment, development, health, culture and education.” Its
major goal is to protect the rights of indigenous people. Such protection would enable them to retain
their cultural identity, such as their language and social customs, while participating in the political,
economic and social activities of the region in which they reside.
Despite the lofty U.N. goals, the rights and feelings of indigenous people are often ignored or
minimized, even by supposedly culturally sensitive developed countries. In the United States many of
those in the federal government are pushing to exploit oil resources in the Arctic National Wildlife
Refuge on the northern coast of Alaska. The “Gwich’in,” an indigenous people who rely culturally and
spiritually on the herds of caribou that live in the region, claim that drilling in the region would
devastate their way of life. Thousands of years of culture would be destroyed for a few months’ supply
of oil. Drilling efforts have been stymied in the past, but mostly out of concern for environmental
factors and not necessarily the needs of the indigenous people. Curiously, another group of indigenous
people, the “Inupiat Eskimo,” favor oil drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. Because they
own considerable amounts of land adjacent to the refuge, they would potentially reap economic
benefits from the development of the region.

Environmental Biology 27

The heart of most environmental conflicts faced by
governments usually involves what constitutes proper
and sustainable levels of development. For many
indigenous peoples, sustainable development
constitutes an integrated wholeness, where no single
action is separate from others. They believe that
sustainable development requires the maintenance and
continuity of life, from generation to generation and
that humans are not isolated entities, but are part of
larger communities, which include the seas, rivers,
mountains, trees, fish, animals and ancestral spirits.
These, along with the sun, moon and cosmos, constitute
a whole. From the point of view of indigenous people,
sustainable development is a process that must integrate
spiritual, cultural, economic, social, political, territorial
and philosophical ideals.

1.6 Chapter Resources

Summary
Science attempts to describe and understand the nature of the universe in whole or in part. Science
has many fields; those fields related to the physical world and its phenomena are considered natural
sciences. A hypothesis is a tentative explanation for an observation. A scientific theory is a well-tested
and consistently verified explanation for a set of observations or phenomena. A scientific law is a
description, often in the form of a mathematical formula, of the behavior of an aspect of nature under
certain circumstances. Two types of logical reasoning are used in science. Inductive reasoning uses
results to produce general scientific principles. Deductive reasoning is a form of logical thinking that
predicts results by applying general principles. The common thread throughout scientific research is the
use of the scientific method. Scientists present their results in peer-reviewed scientific papers published
in scientific journals. Science can be basic or applied. The main goal of basic science is to expand
knowledge without any expectation of short-term practical application of that knowledge. The primary
goal of applied research, however, is to solve practical problems.
Sustainability refers to three simple concerns: the need to arrest environmental degradation and
ecological imbalance, the need not to impoverish future generations and the need for quality of life
and equity between current generations. Added up, these core concerns are an unmistakable call for
transformation. Business-as-usual is no longer an option. The concept of ethics involves standards
of conduct. These standards help to distinguish between behavior that is considered right and that
which is considered wrong. The ways in which humans interact with the land and its natural resources
are determined by ethical attitudes and behaviors. A frontier ethic assumes that the earth has an
unlimited supply of resources. Environmental ethic includes humans as part of the natural community
rather than managers of it. Sustainable ethic assumes that the earth’s resources are not unlimited and
that humans must use and conserve resources in a manner that allows their continued use in the
future. Countries are categorized by a variety of methods. During the Cold War period, the United
States government categorized countries according to each government’s ideology and capitalistic
development. Current classification models utilize economic (and sometimes other) factors in their
determination. Environmental justice is achieved when everyone enjoys the same degree of protection
from environmental and health hazards and equal access to the decision-making process to have
a healthy environment. Many problems face indigenous people, including: lack of human rights,
exploitation of their traditional lands and themselves, and degradation of their culture. Despite the
lofty U.N. goals, the rights and feelings of indigenous people are often ignored or minimized, even by
supposedly culturally sensitive developed countries.

2.1 Matter

Atoms, Molecules, & Compounds
At its most fundamental level, life is made of matter. Matter is something that occupies space and
has mass. All matter is composed of elements, substances that cannot be broken down or transformed
chemically into other substances. Each element is made of atoms, each with a constant number of
protons and unique properties. A total of 118 elements have been defined; however, only 92 occur
naturally and fewer than 30 are found in living cells. The remaining 26 elements are unstable and
therefore do not exist for very long or are theoretical and have yet to be detected. Each element is
designated by its chemical symbol (such as H, N, O, C, and Na), and possesses unique properties. These
unique properties allow elements to combine and to bond with each other in specific ways.
An atom is the smallest component of an element that retains all of the chemical properties of that
element. For example, one hydrogen atom has all of the properties of the element hydrogen, such as
it exists as a gas at room temperature and it bonds with oxygen to create a water molecule. Hydrogen
atoms cannot be broken down into anything smaller while still retaining the properties of hydrogen. If
a hydrogen atom were broken down into subatomic particles, it would no longer have the properties of
hydrogen. At the most basic level, all organisms are made of a combination of elements. They contain
atoms that combine together to form molecules. In multicellular organisms, such as animals, molecules
can interact to form cells that combine to form tissues, which make up organs. These combinations
continue until entire multicellular organisms are formed.
All matter, whether it be a rock or an organism, is made of atoms. Often, these atoms combine to form
molecules. Molecule are chemicals made from two or more atoms bonded together. Some molecules
are very simple, like O2, which is comprised of just two oxygen atoms. Some molecules used by
organisms, such as DNA, are made of many millions of atoms. All atoms contain protons, electrons, and
neutrons (Figure 1 below). The only exception is hydrogen (H), which is made of one proton and one
electron. A proton is a positively charged particle that resides in the nucleus (the core of the atom) of an
atom and has a mass of 1 and a charge of +1. An electron is a negatively charged particle that travels in
the space around the nucleus. In other words, it resides outside of the nucleus. It has a negligible mass
and has a charge of –1. Neutrons, like protons, reside in the nucleus of an atom. They have a mass of
1 and no charge. The positive (protons) and negative (electrons) charges balance each other in a neutral
atom, which has a net zero charge.

Each element contains a different number of
protons and neutrons, giving it its own atomic
number and mass number. The atomic number
of an element is equal to the number of protons
that element contains. The mass number is the
number of protons plus the number of neutrons of
that element. Therefore, it is possible to
determine the number of neutrons by subtracting
the atomic number from the mass number.
Isotopes are different forms of the same
element that have the same number of protons,
but a different number of neutrons. Some Figure 1. Atoms are comprised of protons and neutrons

uranium, have naturally occurring isotopes. nucleus. The nucleus of an atom should not be confused

contains six protons and six neutrons. Therefore,
it has a mass number of 12 (six protons and six neutrons) and an atomic number of 6 (which makes it
carbon). Carbon 14 contains six protons and eight neutrons. Therefore, it has a mass number of 14 (six
protons and eight neutrons) and an atomic number of 6, meaning it is still the element carbon. These two
alternate forms of carbon are isotopes. Some isotopes are unstable and will lose protons, other subatomic
particles, or energy to form more stable elements. These are called radioactive isotopes or
radioisotopes.

Environmental Biology 37

EVOLUTION IN ACTION
Carbon dating
Carbon-14 (14C) is a naturally occurring radioisotope that is created in the atmosphere by cosmic rays. This is
a continuous process, so more 14C is always being created. As a living organism develops, the relative level
of 14C in its body is equal to the concentration of 14C in the atmosphere. When an organism dies, it is no longer
ingesting 14C, so the ratio will decline. 14C decays to 14N by a process called beta decay; it gives off energy in
this slow process. After approximately 5,730 years, only one-half of the starting concentration of 14C will
have been converted to 14N. The time it takes for half of the original concentration of an isotope to decay to its
more stable form is called its half-life.
Because the half-life of 14C is long, it is used to age formerly living objects, such as fossils. Using the ratio of
the 14C concentration found in an object to the amount of 14C detected in the atmosphere, the amount of
the isotope that has not yet decayed can be determined. Based on this amount, the age of the fossil can be
calculated to about 50,000 years (Figure 2 below). Isotopes with longer half-lives, such as potassium-40, are
used to calculate the ages of older fossils. Through the use of carbon dating, scientists can reconstruct the
ecology and biogeography of organisms living within the past 50,000 years.

Figure 2. The age of remains that contain carbon and are less than about 50,000 years old, such as this pygmy mammoth, can be
determined using carbon dating. (credit: Bill Faulkner/ NPS)

Chemical Bonds
How elements interact with one another depends on the number of electrons and how they are arranged.
When an atom does not contain equal numbers of protons and electrons it is called an ion. Because the
number of electrons does not equal the number of protons, each ion has a net charge. For example, if
sodium loses an electron, it now has 11 protons and only 10 electrons, leaving it with an overall charge
of +1. Positive ions are formed by losing electrons and are called cations. Negative ions are formed
by gaining electrons and are called anions. Elemental anionic names are changed to end in -ide. As an
example, when chlorine becomes an ion it is referred to as chloride.
Ionic and covalent bonds are strong bonds formed between two atoms. These bonds hold atoms
together in a relatively stable state. Ionic bonds are formed between two oppositely charged ions (an
anion and a cation). Because positive and negative charges attract, these ions are held together much
like two oppositely charged magnets would stick together. Covalent bonds form when electrons are
shared between two atoms. Each atom shares one of their electrons, which then orbits the nuclei of both

38 Matthew R. Fisher, Editor

atoms, holding the two atoms together. Covalent bonds are the strongest and most common form of
chemical bond in organisms. Unlike most ionic bonds, covalent bonds do not dissociate in water.
Covalent bonds come in two varieties: polar and non-polar. A non-polar covalent bond occurs when
electrons are shared equally between the two atoms. Polar covalent bonds form when the electrons
are shared unequally. Why does this occur? Each element has a known electronegativity: a measure
of their affinity for electrons. Some elements, such as oxygen, are very electronegative because they
strongly attract electrons from other atoms. Hydrogen, meanwhile, has low electronegativity and thus
weakly attracts electrons, in comparison. Polar covalent bonds form when the two atoms involved have
significantly different electronegativities. In biological systems, this occurs when oxygen bonds with
hydrogen and when nitrogen (also quite electronegative) bonds with hydrogen.
When oxygen and hydrogen bond, for example, the shared electrons are pulled more strongly toward
oxygen and thus farther away from hydrogen’s nucleus. Because the electrons move farther away from
hydrogen, it becomes slightly positively charged (δ+). The oxygen becomes slightly negatively charged
as the electrons become closer to it (δ–). If two molecules with polar covalent bonds approach one
another, they can interact due to the attraction of opposite electrical charges. For example, the slight
positive charge of hydrogen in a water molecule can be attracted to the slight negative charge of oxygen
in a different water molecule (Figure 3). This interaction between two polar molecules is called a
hydrogen bond. This type of bond is very common in organisms. Notably, hydrogen bonds give water
the unique properties that sustain life. If it were not for hydrogen bonding, water would be a gas rather
than a liquid at room temperature.

WATER IS CRUCIAL TO MAINTAINING LIFE
Do you ever wonder why scientists spend time
looking for water on other planets? It is because
water is essential to life; even minute traces of it
on another planet can indicate that life could or
did exist on that planet. Water is one of the more
abundant molecules in living cells and the one
most critical to life as we know it. Approximately
60–70 percent of your body is made up of water.
Without it, life simply would not exist.

Figure 3. Hydrogen bonds form between slightly positive
(δ+) and slightly negative (δ–) charges of polar covalent
molecules, such as water.

• Water is polar. The hydrogen and oxygen atoms within water molecules form polar covalent
bonds. The shared electrons spend more time associated with the oxygen atom than they do
with hydrogen atoms. There is no overall charge to a water molecule, but there is a slight
positive charge on each hydrogen atom and a slight negative charge on the oxygen atom.
Because of these charges, the slightly positive hydrogen atoms repel each other and form the
unique shape. Each water molecule attracts other water molecules because of the positive and
negative charges in the different parts of the molecule. Water also attracts other polar
molecules (such as sugars) that can dissolve in water and are referred to as hydrophilic
(“water-loving”).
• Water stabilizes temperature. The hydrogen bonds in water allow it to absorb and release
heat energy more slowly than many other substances. Temperature is a measure of the motion
(kinetic energy) of molecules. As the motion increases, energy is higher and thus temperature

Environmental Biology 39

is higher. Water absorbs a great deal of energy before its temperature rises. Increased energy
disrupts the hydrogen bonds between water molecules. Because these bonds can be created
and disrupted rapidly, water absorbs an increase in energy and temperature changes only
minimally. This means that water moderates temperature changes within organisms and in
their environments.
• Water is an excellent solvent. Because water is polar, with slight positive and negative
charges, ionic compounds and polar molecules can readily dissolve in it. Water is, therefore,
what is referred to as a solvent—a substance capable of dissolving another substance. The
charged particles will form hydrogen bonds with a surrounding layer of water molecules.
• Water is cohesive. Have you ever filled up a glass of water to the very top and then slowly
added a few more drops? Before it overflows, the water actually forms a dome-like shape
above the rim of the glass. This water can stay above the glass because of the property of
cohesion. In cohesion, water molecules are attracted to each other (because of hydrogen
bonding), keeping the molecules together at the liquid-air (gas) interface, although there is no
more room in the glass. Cohesion gives rise to surface tension, the capacity of a substance to
withstand rupture when placed under tension or stress. When you drop a small scrap of paper
onto a droplet of water, the paper floats on top of the water droplet, although the object
is denser (heavier) than the water. This occurs because of the surface tension that is created
by the water molecules. Cohesion and surface tension keep the water molecules intact and the
item floating on the top. It is even possible to “float” a steel needle on top of a glass of water
if you place it gently, without breaking the surface tension. These cohesive forces are also
related to the water’s property of adhesion, or the attraction between water molecules and
other molecules. This is observed when water “climbs” up a straw placed in a glass of water.
You will notice that the water appears to be higher on the sides of the straw than in the
middle. This is because the water molecules are attracted to the straw and therefore adhere to
it. Cohesive and adhesive forces are important for sustaining life. For example, because of
these forces, water can flow up from the roots to the tops of plants to feed the plant.
Buffers, pH, Acids, and Bases
The pH of a solution is a measure of its acidity or alkalinity. The pH scale ranges from 0 to 14. A
change of one unit on the pH scale represents a change in the concentration of hydrogen ions by a factor
of 10, a change in two units represents a change in the concentration of hydrogen ions by a factor of 100.
Thus, small changes in pH represent large changes in the concentrations of hydrogen ions. Pure water
is neutral. It is neither acidic nor basic and has a pH of 7.0. Anything below 7.0 (ranging from 0.0 to
6.9) is acidic, and anything above 7.0 (from 7.1 to 14.0) is alkaline. The blood in your veins is slightly
alkaline (pH = 7.4). The environment in your stomach is highly acidic (pH = 1 to 2). Orange juice is
mildly acidic (pH = approximately 3.5), whereas baking soda is basic (pH = 9.0).
Acids are substances that provide hydrogen ions (H+) and lower pH, whereas bases provide
hydroxide ions (OH–) and raise pH. The stronger the acid, the more readily it donates H+. For example,
hydrochloric acid and lemon juice are very acidic and readily give up H+ when added to water.
Conversely, bases are those substances that readily donate OH–. The OH– ions combine with H+ to
produce water, which raises a substance’s pH. Sodium hydroxide and many household cleaners are very
alkaline and give up OH– rapidly when placed in water, thereby raising the pH.

40 Matthew R. Fisher, Editor

How is it that we can ingest or inhale acidic or
basic substances and not die? Buffers are the key.
Buffers readily absorb excess H+ or OH–,
keeping the pH of the body carefully maintained
in the aforementioned narrow range. Carbon
dioxide is part of a prominent buffer system in the
human body; it keeps the pH within the proper
range. This buffer system involves carbonic acid
(H2CO3) and bicarbonate (HCO3–) anion. If too
much H+ enters the body, bicarbonate will
combine with the H+ to create carbonic acid and
limit the decrease in pH. Likewise, if too much
OH– is introduced into the system, carbonic acid
will combine with it to create bicarbonate and
limit the increase in pH. While carbonic acid is an
important product in this reaction, its presence is
fleeting because the carbonic acid is released
from the body as carbon dioxide gas each time we
breathe. Without this buffer system, the pH in our
bodies would fluctuate too much and we would
fail to survive.

ions (H+) in a substance. (credit: modification of work by

Besides water, the molecules necessary for life
are organic. Organic molecules are those that contain carbon covalently bonded to hydrogen. In
addition, they may contain oxygen, nitrogen, phosphorus, sulfur, and additional elements.There are four
major classes of organic molecules: carbohydrates, lipids, proteins, and nucleic acids. Each is an
important component of the cell and performs a wide array of functions.
It is often said that life is “carbon-based.” This means that carbon atoms, bonded to other
carbon atoms or other elements, form the fundamental components of many of the molecules found
uniquely in living things. Other elements play important roles in biological molecules, but carbon
certainly qualifies as the “foundation” element for molecules in living things. It is the bonding properties
of carbon atoms that are responsible for its important role.
Carbon can form four covalent bonds with other atoms or molecules. The simplest organic carbon molecule
is methane (CH4), in which four hydrogen atoms bind to a carbon atom (Figure 5). Carbohydrates include
what are commonly referred to as simple sugars, like glucose, and complex carbohydrates such as starch. While
many types of carbohydrates are used for energy, some are used for structure by most organisms, including
plants and animals. For example, cellulose is a complex carbohydrate that adds rigidity and strength to the cell
walls of plants. The suffix “-ose” denotes a carbohydrate, but note that not all carbohydrates were given that
suffix when names (e.g., starch).

Environmental Biology 41

Lipids include a diverse group of compounds that
are united by a common feature. Lipids are
hydrophobic (“water-fearing”), or insoluble in
water,
because
they
are
non-polar
molecules (molecules that contain non-polar
covalent bonds) . Lipids perform many different
functions in a cell. Cells store energy for long-term
use in the form of lipids called fats. Lipids also
provide insulation from the environment for plants
and animals. For example, they help keep aquatic Figure 5. Carbon can form four covalent bonds to create
birds and mammals dry because of their water- an organic molecule. The simplest carbon molecule is
methane (CH4), depicted here.
repelling nature. Lipids are also the building blocks
of many hormones and are an important constituent
of cellular membranes. Lipids include fats, oils, waxes, phospholipids, and steroids.
Proteins are one of the most abundant organic molecules in living systems and have the most diverse
range of functions of all macromolecules. They are all polymers of amino acids. The functions of
proteins are very diverse because there are 20 different chemically distinct amino acids that form long
chains, and the amino acids can be in any order. Proteins can function as enzymes, hormones, contractile
fibers, cytoskeleton rods, and much more. Enzymes are vital to life because they act as catalyst in
biochemical reactions (like digestion). Each enzyme is specific for the substrate (a reactant that binds to
an enzyme) upon which it acts. Enzymes can function to break molecular bonds, to rearrange bonds, or
to form new bonds.
Nucleic acids are very large molecules that are important to the
continuity of life. They carry the genetic blueprint of a cell and thus
the instructions for its functionality. The two main types of nucleic
acids are deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) and ribonucleic acid (RNA).
DNA is the genetic material found in all organisms, ranging from
single-celled bacteria to multicellular mammals. The other type of
nucleic acid, RNA, is mostly involved in protein synthesis. The DNA
molecules never leave the nucleus, but instead use an RNA
intermediary to communicate with the rest of the cell. Other types of
RNA are also involved in protein synthesis and its regulation. DNA
and RNA are made up of small building blocks known as
nucleotides. The nucleotides combine with each other to form a
polynucleotide: DNA or RNA. Each nucleotide is made up of three

2.2 Energy

Virtually every task performed by living organisms requires energy. Nutrients and other molecules are
imported into the cell to meet these energy demands. For example, energy is required for the synthesis
and breakdown of molecules, as well as the transport of molecules into and out of cells. In addition,
processes such as ingesting and breaking down food, exporting wastes and toxins, and movement of the
cell all require energy.
Scientists use the term bioenergetics to describe the concept of energy flow through living systems,
such as cells. Cellular processes such as the building and breaking down of complex molecules occur
through step-wise chemical reactions. Some of these chemical reactions are spontaneous and release
energy, whereas others require energy to proceed. Together, all of the chemical reactions that take place
inside cells, including those that consume or generate energy, are referred to as the cell’s metabolism.
From where, and in what form, does this energy come? How do living cells obtain energy, and how do
they use it? This section will discuss different forms of energy and the physical laws that govern energy
transfer.

43

44 Matthew R. Fisher, Editor

Figure 1. Ultimately, most life forms get their energy from the sun. Plants use
photosynthesis to capture sunlight, and herbivores eat the plants to obtain
energy. Carnivores eat the herbivores, and eventual decomposition of plant
and animal material contributes to the nutrient pool.

Energy
Thermodynamics refers to the study of energy and energy transfer involving physical matter. The
matter relevant to a particular case of energy transfer is called a system, and everything outside of that
matter is called the surroundings. For instance, when heating a pot of water on the stove, the system
includes the stove, the pot, and the water. Energy is transferred within the system (between the stove,
pot, and water). There are two types of systems: open and closed. In an open system, energy can be
exchanged with its surroundings. The stovetop system is open because heat can be lost to the air. A
closed system cannot exchange energy with its surroundings.
Biological organisms are open systems. Energy is exchanged between them and their surroundings
as they use energy from the sun to perform photosynthesis or consume energy-storing molecules and
release energy to the environment by doing work and releasing heat. Like all things in the physical
world, energy is subject to physical laws. The laws of thermodynamics govern the transfer of energy
in and among all systems in the universe. In general, energy is defined as the ability to do work, or to

Environmental Biology 45

create some kind of change. Energy exists in different forms: electrical energy, light energy, mechanical
energy, and heat energy are all different types of energy. To appreciate the way energy flows into and out
of biological systems, it is important to understand two of the physical laws that govern energy.
The first law of thermodynamics states that the total amount of energy in the universe is constant
and conserved. In other words, there has always been, and always will be, exactly the same amount
of energy in the universe. Energy exists in many different forms. According to the first law of
thermodynamics, energy may be transferred from place to place or transformed into different forms,
but it cannot be created or destroyed. The transfers and transformations of energy take place around us
all the time. Light bulbs transform electrical energy into light and heat energy. Gas stoves transform
chemical energy from natural gas into heat energy. Plants perform one of the most biologically useful
energy transformations on earth: that of converting the energy of sunlight to chemical energy stored
within organic molecules (Figure 2 below).
The challenge for all living organisms is to obtain energy from their surroundings in forms that
are usable to perform cellular work. Cells have evolved to meet this challenge. Chemical energy stored
within organic molecules such as sugars and fats is transferred and transformed through a series of
cellular chemical reactions into energy within molecules of ATP (adenosine triphosphate). Energy in
ATP molecules is easily accessible to do work. Examples of the types of work that cells need to
do include building complex molecules, transporting materials, powering the motion of cilia or flagella,
and contracting muscles to create movement.

46 Matthew R. Fisher, Editor

Figure 2. Shown are some examples of energy transferred
and transformed from one system to another and from one
form to another. The food we consume provides our cells
with the energy required to carry out bodily functions, just
as light energy provides plants with the means to create the
chemical energy they need. (credit “ice cream”:

“leaf”: modification of work by Cory Zanker)

A living cell’s primary tasks of obtaining,
transforming, and using energy to do work may
seem simple. However, the second law of
thermodynamics explains why these tasks are
harder than they appear. All energy transfers and
transformations are never completely efficient. In
every energy transfer, some amount of energy is
lost in a form that is unusable. In most cases, this
form is heat energy.
Thermodynamically, heat energy is defined as
the energy transferred from one system to another
that is not work. For example, when a light bulb
is turned on, some of the energy being converted
from electrical energy into light energy is lost as
heat energy. Likewise, some energy is lost as heat
energy during cellular metabolic reactions.
An important concept in physical systems is
that of order and disorder. The more energy that
is lost by a system to its surroundings, the less
ordered and more random the system is.
Scientists refer to the measure of randomness or
disorder within a system as entropy. High
entropy means high disorder and low energy.
Molecules and chemical reactions have varying
entropy as well. For example, entropy increases
as molecules at a high concentration in one place
diffuse and spread out. The second law
of thermodynamics says that energy will always
be lost as heat in energy transfers or
transformations. Living things are highly
ordered, requiring constant energy input to be
maintained in a state of low entropy.

Potential and Kinetic Energy
When an object is in motion, there is energy associated with that object. Think of a wrecking ball.
Even a slow-moving wrecking ball can do a great deal of damage to other objects. Energy associated
with objects in motion is called kinetic energy. A speeding bullet, a walking person, and the rapid
movement of molecules in the air all have kinetic energy. Now what if that same motionless wrecking
ball is lifted two stories above ground with a crane? If the suspended wrecking ball is not moving, is
there energy associated with it? The answer is yes. The energy that was required to lift the wrecking ball
did not disappear, but is now stored in the wrecking ball by virtue of its position and the force of gravity
acting on it. This type of energy is called potential energy (Figure 3 below). If the ball were to fall, the
potential energy would be transformed into kinetic energy until all of the potential energy was exhausted
when the ball rested on the ground. Wrecking balls also swing like a pendulum; through the swing, there
is a constant change of potential energy (highest at the top of the swing) to kinetic energy (highest at the

Environmental Biology 47

bottom of the swing). Other examples of potential energy include the energy of water held behind a dam
or a person about to skydive out of an airplane.
Potential energy is not only associated with the
location of matter, but also with the structure of
matter. Even a spring on the ground has potential
energy if it is compressed; so does a rubber band
that is pulled taut. On a molecular level, the
bonds that hold the atoms of molecules together
exist in a particular structure that has potential
energy. The fact that energy can be released by
the breakdown of certain chemical bonds implies Figure 3. Still water has potential energy; moving water,
that those bonds have potential energy. In fact, such as in a waterfall or a rapidly flowing river, has
there is potential energy stored within the bonds kinetic energy. (credit “dam”: modification of work by
of all the food molecules we eat, which is “Pascal”/Flickr; credit “waterfall”: modification of work
harnessed for use. The type of potential energy by Frank Gualtieri)
that exists within chemical bonds, and is released
when those bonds are broken, is called chemical energy. Chemical energy is responsible for providing
living cells with energy from food. The release of energy occurs when the molecular bonds within food
molecules are broken.

2.3 A Cell is the Smallest Unit of Life

Levels of Biological Organization
Living things are highly organized and structured, following a hierarchy of scale from small to large
(Figure 1). The atom is the smallest and most fundamental unit of matter. It consists of a nucleus
surrounded by electrons. Atoms combine to form molecules, which are chemical structures consisting
of at least two atoms held together by a chemical bond. In plants, animals, and many other types
of organisms, molecules come together in specific ways to create structures called organelles.

Organelles are small structures that exist within cells and perform specialized functions.
As discussed in more detail below, all living things are made of one or more cells.

49

50 Matthew R. Fisher, Editor

In most multicellular organisms, cells
combine to make tissues, which are groups of
similar cells carrying out the same
function. Organs are collections of tissues
grouped together based on a common
function. Organs are present not only in animals
but also in plants. An organ system is a
higher level of organization that consists of
functionally related organs. For example
vertebrate animals have many organ systems,
such as the circulatory system that transports
blood throughout the body and to and from the
lungs; it includes organs such as the heart and
blood vessels. Organisms are individual living
entities. For example, each tree in a forest is
an organism.
All the individuals of a species living within
a specific area are collectively called
a population. A community is the set of different
populations inhabiting a common area. For
instance, all of the trees, flowers, insects, and
other populations in a forest form the forest’s
community. The forest itself is an ecosystem.
An ecosystem consists of all the living things in a
particular area together with the abiotic, or nonliving, parts of that environment such as nitrogen
in
the
soil
or
rainwater.
At
the
highest level of organization, the biosphere is the
collection of all ecosystems, and it represents the
zones of life on Earth. It includes land, water, and
portions of the atmosphere.

Cell Theory
Close your eyes and picture a brick wall. What
is the basic building block of that wall? It is a
single brick, of course. Like a brick wall, your
body is composed of basic building blocks and
the building blocks of your body are cells. Your
body has many kinds of cells, each specialized for
a specific purpose. Just as a home is made from a
variety of building materials, the human body is
constructed from many cell types. For example,
bone cells help to support and protect the body.

Leeuwenhoek observed the movements of singlecelled organism and sperm, which he collectively termed “animalcules.” In a 1665 publication called
Micrographia, experimental scientist Robert Hooke coined the term “cell” (from the Latin cella,
meaning “small room”) for the box-like structures he observed when viewing cork tissue through a lens.
In the 1670s, van Leeuwenhoek discovered bacteria and protozoa. Later advances in lenses and
microscope construction enabled other scientists to see different components inside cells.
By the late 1830s, botanist Matthias Schleiden and zoologist Theodor Schwann were studying
tissues and proposed the unified cell theory, which states that all living things are composed of one
or more cells, that the cell is the basic unit of life, and that all new cells arise from existing cells.
These principles still stand today. There are many types of cells, and all are grouped into one of two
broad categories: prokaryotic and eukaryotic. Animal, plant, fungal, and protist cells are classified as
eukaryotic, whereas bacteria and archaea cells are classified as prokaryotic.
All cells share four common components: 1) a plasma membrane, an outer covering that separates the
cell’s interior from its surrounding environment; 2) cytoplasm, consisting of a jelly-like region within
the cell in which other cellular components are found; 3) DNA, the genetic material of the cell; and
4) ribosomes, particles that synthesize proteins. However, prokaryotes differ from eukaryotic cells in
several ways.
Components of Prokaryotic Cells
A prokaryotic cell is a simple, single-celled (unicellular) organism that lacks a nucleus, or any other
membrane-bound organelle. We will shortly come to see that this is significantly different in eukaryotes.
Prokaryotic DNA is found in the central part of the cell: a darkened region called the nucleoid (Figure
1).

52 Matthew R. Fisher, Editor

Figure 2. This figure shows the generalized structure
of a prokaryotic cell.

Unlike Archaea and eukaryotes, bacteria have a cell
wall made of peptidoglycan (molecules comprised of
sugars and amino acids) and many have a
polysaccharide capsule. The cell wall acts as an extra
layer of protection, helps the cell maintain its shape,
and prevents dehydration. The capsule enables the
cell to attach to surfaces in its environment. Some
prokaryotes have flagella, pili, or fimbriae. Flagella
are used for locomotion. Pili are used to exchange
genetic material during a type of reproduction called
conjugation. Fimbriae are protein appendages used by
bacteria to attach to other cells.
Eukaryotic Cells

A eukaryotic cell is a cell that has a membrane-bound nucleus and other membrane-bound
compartments called organelles. There are many different types of organelles, each with a highly
specialized function (see Figure 3). The word eukaryotic means “true kernel” or “true nucleus,” alluding
to the presence of the membrane-bound nucleus in these cells. The word “organelle” means “little
organ,” and, as already mentioned, organelles have specialized cellular functions, just as the organs of
your body have specialized functions.
Cell Size
At 0.1–5.0 µm in diameter, most prokaryotic cells are significantly smaller than eukaryotic cells, which
have diameters ranging from 10–100 µm (Figure 3). The small size of prokaryotes allows ions and
organic molecules that enter them to quickly spread to other parts of the cell. Similarly, any wastes
produced within a prokaryotic cell can quickly move out. However, larger eukaryotic cells have evolved
different structural adaptations to enhance cellular transport. Indeed, the large size of these cells would
not be possible without these adaptations. In general, cell size is limited because volume increases much
more quickly than does cell surface area. As a cell becomes larger, it becomes more and more difficult
for the cell to acquire sufficient materials to support the processes inside the cell, because the relative
size of the surface area through which materials must be transported declines.

shown for comparison.

Despite their fundamental similarities, there are some

54 Matthew R. Fisher, Editor

striking differences between animal and plant cells (Figure 3). Animal cells have centrioles,
centrosomes, and lysosomes, whereas plant cells do not. Plant cells have a rigid cell wall that is external
to the plasma membrane, chloroplasts, plasmodesmata, and plastids used for storage, and a large central
vacuole, whereas animal cells do not.
Chloroplasts

From an ecological perspective, chloroplasts are a particularly important type of organelle because
they perform photosynthesis. Photosynthesis forms the foundation of food chains in most ecosystems.
Chloroplasts are only found in eukaryotic cells such as plants and algae. During photosynthesis,
carbon dioxide, water, and light energy are used to make glucose and molecular oxygen. One major
difference between algae/plants and animals is that plants/algae are able to make their own food, like
glucose, whereas animals must obtain food by consuming other organisms.
Chloroplasts have outer and inner membranes, but
within the space enclosed by a chloroplast’s inner
membrane is a set of interconnected and stacked, fluidfilled membrane sacs called thylakoids (Figure 4
below). Each stack of thylakoids is called a granum
(plural = grana). The fluid enclosed by the inner
membrane and surrounding the grana is called the
stroma. Each structure within the chloroplast has an
important function, which is enabled by its particular
shape. A common theme in biology is that form and
function are interrelated. For example, the membranerich stacks of the thylakoids provide ample surface Figure 6. This simplified diagram of a chloroplast

2.4 Energy Enters Ecosystems Through Photosynthesis

Cells run on the chemical energy found mainly in carbohydrate molecules, and the majority of these
molecules are produced by one process: photosynthesis. Through photosynthesis, certain organisms
convert solar energy (sunlight) into chemical energy, which is then used to build carbohydrate
molecules. The energy stored in the bonds to hold these molecules together is released when an organism
breaks down food. Cells then use this energy to perform work, such as movement. The energy that is
harnessed from photosynthesis enters the ecosystems of our planet continuously and is transferred from
one organism to another. Therefore, directly or indirectly, the process of photosynthesis provides most
of the energy required by living things on Earth. Photosynthesis also results in the release of oxygen into
the atmosphere. In short, to eat and breathe humans depend almost entirely on the organisms that carry
out photosynthesis.

Solar Dependence and Food Production

Figure 1. (a) Plants, (b) algae, and (c) certain bacteria, called cyanobacteria, are photoautotrophs that can carry out
photosynthesis. Algae can grow over enormous areas in water, at times completely covering the surface. (credit a:

scale-bar data from Matt Russell)

Some organisms can carry out photosynthesis, whereas others cannot. An autotroph is an organism that
can produce its own food. The Greek roots of the word autotroph mean “self” (auto) “feeder” (troph).
Plants are the best-known autotrophs, but others exist, including certain types of bacteria and algae
(Figure 1). Oceanic algae contribute enormous quantities of food and oxygen to global food chains.
More specifically, plants are photoautotrophs, a type of autotroph that uses sunlight and carbon from
carbon dioxide to synthesize chemical energy in the form of carbohydrates. All organisms carrying out
photosynthesis require sunlight.

55

56 Matthew R. Fisher, Editor

Heterotrophs are organisms incapable of
photosynthesis that must therefore obtain energy and
carbon from food by consuming other organisms.
The Greek roots of the word heterotroph mean
“other” (hetero) “feeder” (troph), meaning that their
food comes from other organisms. Even if the
organism being consumed is another animal, it traces
its stored energy back to autotrophs and the process
of photosynthesis. Humans are heterotrophs, as are
all animals and fungi. Heterotrophs depend on
autotrophs, either directly or indirectly. For example,
a deer obtains energy by eating plants. A wolf eating
a deer obtains energy that originally came from the
plants eaten by that deer (Figure 2). Using this
reasoning, all food eaten by humans can be traced
back to autotrophs that carry out photosynthesis.

Figure 2. The energy stored in carbohydrate molecules
from photosynthesis passes through the food chain. The
predator that eats these deer is getting energy that
originated in the photosynthetic vegetation that the
deer consumed. (credit: Steve VanRiper, U.S. Fish and
Wildlife Service)

Summary of Photosynthesis
Photosynthesis requires sunlight, carbon
dioxide, and water as starting reactants (Figure
3). After the process is complete, photosynthesis
releases oxygen and produces carbohydrate
molecules, most commonly glucose. These sugar
molecules contain the energy that living things
need to survive. The complex reactions of
photosynthesis can be summarized by the
chemical equation shown in Figure 4 below.
Although the equation looks simple, the many
steps that take place during photosynthesis are
actually quite complex. In plants, photosynthesis
takes place primarily in the chloroplasts of leaves.
Chloroplasts have a double (inner and outer)
membrane. Within the chloroplast is a third
membrane that forms stacked, disc-shaped
structures called thylakoids. Embedded in the
thylakoid membrane are molecules of
chlorophyll, a pigment (a molecule that absorbs
light) through which the entire process of
photosynthesis begins.
Figure 3. Photosynthesis uses solar energy, carbon
dioxide, and water to release oxygen and to produce
energy-storing sugar molecules.

Environmental Biology 57

Figure 4. This equation means that six molecules of carbon dioxide (CO2) combine with six
molecules of water (H2O) in the presence of sunlight. This produces one molecule of glucose
(C6H12O6) and six molecules of oxygen (O2).
The Two Parts of Photosynthesis

Photosynthesis takes place in two stages: the light-dependent reactions and the Calvin cycle. In the lightdependent reactions chlorophyll absorbs energy from sunlight and then converts it into chemical energy
with the aid of water. The light-dependent reactions release oxygen as a byproduct from the splitting of
water. In the Calvin cycle, the chemical energy derived from the light-dependent reactions drives both
the capture of carbon in carbon dioxide molecules and the subsequent assembly of sugar molecules.
The Global Significance of Photosynthesis
The process of photosynthesis is crucially important to the biosphere for the following reasons:
1. It creates O2, which is important for two reasons. The molecular oxygen in Earth’s
atmosphere was created by photosynthetic organisms; without photosynthesis there would be
no O2 to support cellular respiration (see chapter 3.2) needed by complex, multicellular life.
Photosynthetic bacteria were likely the first organisms to perform photosynthesis, dating
back 2-3 billion years ago. Thanks to their activity, and a diversity of presentday photosynthesizing organisms, Earth’s atmosphere is currently about 21% O2. Also, this
O2 is vital for the creation of the ozone layer (see chapter 10.2), which protects life from
harmful ultraviolet radiation emitted by the sun. Ozone (O3) is created from the breakdown
and reassembly of O2.
2. It provides energy for nearly all ecosystems. By transforming light energy into chemical
energy, photosynthesis provides the energy used by organisms, whether those organisms
are plants, grasshoppers, wolves, or fungi. The only exceptions are found in very rare and
isolated ecosystems, such as near deep sea hydrothermal vents where organisms get energy
that originally came from minerals, not the sun.
3. It provides the carbon needed for organic molecules. Organisms are primarily made of two
things: water and organic molecules, the latter being carbon based. Through the process of
carbon fixation, photosynthesis takes carbon from CO2 and converts it into sugars (which
are organic). Carbon in these sugars can be re-purposed to create the other types of organic
molecules that organisms need, such as lipids, proteins, and nucleic acids. For example, the
carbon used to make your DNA was once CO2 used by photosynthetic organisms (see section
3.1 for more information on food webs).

Summary
Matter is anything that occupies space and has mass. It is made up of atoms of different elements.
Elements that occur naturally have unique qualities that allow them to combine in various ways to create
compounds or molecules. Atoms, which consist of protons, neutrons, and electrons, are the smallest
units of an element that retain all of the properties of that element. Electrons can be donated or shared
between atoms to create bonds, including ionic, covalent, and hydrogen bonds. The pH of a solution is a
measure of the concentration of hydrogen ions in the solution. Living things are carbon-based because
carbon plays such a prominent role in the chemistry of living things.
A cell is the smallest unit of life. Most cells are so small that they cannot be viewed with the naked
eye. The unified cell theory states that all organisms are composed of one or more cells, the cell is
the basic unit of life, and new cells arise from existing cells. Each cell runs on the chemical energy
found mainly in carbohydrate molecules (food), and the majority of these molecules are produced by one
process: photosynthesis. Through photosynthesis, certain organisms convert solar energy (sunlight) into
chemical energy, which is then used to build carbohydrate molecules. Directly or indirectly, the process
of photosynthesis provides most of the energy required by living things on earth. Photosynthesis also
results in the release of oxygen into the atmosphere. In short, to eat and breathe, humans depend almost
entirely on the organisms that carry out photosynthesis.

The (a) Karner blue butterfly and (b) wild lupine live in oak-pine barren habitats in
North America. This habitat is characterized by natural disturbance in the form of fire
and nutrient-poor soils that are low in nitrogen—important factors in the distribution of
the plants that live in this habitat. Researchers interested in ecosystem ecology study the
importance of limited resources in this ecosystem and the movement of resources (such
as nutrients) through the biotic and abiotic portions of the ecosystem. Researchers also
examine how organisms have adapted to their ecosystem. (credit: USFWS)

3.1 Energy Flow through Ecosystems

Figure 1. A (a) tidal pool ecosystem in Matinicus Island, Maine, is a small ecosystem, while the (b)
Amazon rainforest in Brazil is a large ecosystem. (credit a: modification of work by Jim Kuhn; credit b:

An ecosystem is a community of organisms and their abiotic (non-living) environment. Ecosystems can
be small, such as the tide pools found near the rocky shores of many oceans, or large, such as those found
in the tropical rainforest of the Amazon in Brazil (Figure 1).
There are three broad categories of ecosystems based on their general environment: freshwater, marine,
and terrestrial. Within these three categories are individual ecosystem types based on the environmental
habitat and organisms present.
Freshwater ecosystems are the least common, occurring on only 1.8 percent of Earth’s surface. These
systems comprise lakes, rivers, streams, and springs; they are quite diverse and support a variety of
animals, plants, fungi, protists and prokaryotes.
Marine ecosystems are the most common, comprising 75 percent of Earth’s surface and consisting of
three basic types: shallow ocean, deep ocean water, and deep ocean bottom. Shallow ocean ecosystems
include extremely biodiverse coral reef ecosystems. Small photosynthetic organisms suspended in ocean
waters, collectively known as phytoplankton, perform 40 percent of all photosynthesis on Earth. Deep
ocean bottom ecosystems contain a wide variety of marine organisms. These ecosystems are so deep that
light is unable to reach them.
Terrestrial ecosystems, also known for their diversity, are grouped into large categories called
biomes. A biome is a large-scale community of organisms, primarily defined on land by the dominant
plant types that exist in geographic regions of the planet with similar climatic conditions. Examples
of biomes include tropical rainforests, savannas, deserts, grasslands, temperate forests, and tundras.
Grouping these ecosystems into just a few biome categories obscures the great diversity of the individual
ecosystems within them. For example, the saguaro cacti (Carnegiea gigantean) and other plant life in
65

66 Matthew R. Fisher, Editor

the Sonoran Desert, in the United States, are relatively diverse compared with the desolate rocky desert
of Boa Vista, an island off the coast of Western Africa (Figure 2).

Food Chains and Food Webs
A food chain is a linear sequence of organisms
through which nutrients and energy pass as one
organism eats another. The levels in the food
chain are producers, primary consumers, higherlevel consumers, and finally decomposers. These
levels are used to describe ecosystem structure
and dynamics. There is a single path through a
food chain. Each organism in a food chain
occupies a specific trophic level (energy level),
its position in the food chain or food web.

Figure 2. Desert ecosystems, like all ecosystems, can vary
greatly. The desert in (a) Saguaro National Park, Arizona,
has abundant plant life, while the rocky desert of (b) Boa
Vista island, Cape Verde, Africa, is devoid of plant life.

Environmental Biology 67

In many ecosystems, the base, or foundation, of the
food chain consists of photosynthetic organisms (plants
or phytoplankton), which are called producers. The
organisms that consume the producers are herbivores
called primary consumers. Secondary consumers are
usually
carnivores
that
eat
the
primary
consumers. Tertiary consumers are carnivores that eat
other carnivores. Higher-level consumers feed on the
next lower trophic levels, and so on, up to the organisms
at the top of the food chain. In the Lake Ontario food
chain, shown in Figure 3, the Chinook salmon is the apex
consumer at the top of this food chain.
One major factor that limits the number of steps in a food
chain is energy. Energy is lost at each trophic level and
between trophic levels as heat and in the transfer to
decomposers (Figure 4 below). Thus, after a limited
number of trophic energy transfers, the amount of energy
remaining in the food chain may not be great enough to
support viable populations at higher trophic levels.

Figure 3. These are the trophic levels of a food
chain in Lake Ontario at the United
States–Canada border. Energy and nutrients flow
from photosynthetic green algae at the base to the
top of the food chain: the Chinook salmon.

and Atmospheric Administration/NOAA)

There is a one problem when using food chains to
describe most ecosystems. Even when all organisms are
grouped into appropriate trophic levels, some of these
organisms can feed at more than one trophic level. In
addition, species feed on and are eaten by more than one
species. In other words, the linear model of ecosystems,
the food chain, is a hypothetical and overly simplistic
representation of ecosystem structure. A holistic
model—which includes all the interactions between
different species and their complex interconnected
relationships with each other and with the
environment—is a more accurate and descriptive model
for ecosystems. A food web is a concept that accounts for
the multiple trophic (feeding) interactions between each
species (Figure 5 below).

68 Matthew R. Fisher, Editor

Figure 4. The relative energy in trophic levels in a Silver
Springs, Florida, ecosystem is shown. Each trophic level
has less energy available, and usually, but not always,
supports a smaller mass of organisms at the next level.

Two general types of food webs are often shown
interacting within a single ecosystem. A grazing
food web has plants or other photosynthetic
organisms at its base, followed by herbivores and
various carnivores. A detrital food web consists
of a base of organisms that feed on decaying
organic matter (dead organisms), including
decomposers (which break down dead and
decaying organisms) and detritivores (which
consume organic detritus). These organisms are
usually bacteria, fungi, and invertebrate animals
that recycle organic material back into the biotic
part of the ecosystem as they themselves are
consumed by other organisms.

Environmental Biology 69

Figure 5. This food web shows the interactions between organisms across trophic levels. Arrows point
from an organism that is consumed to the organism that consumes it. All the producers and consumers
eventually become nourishment for the decomposers (fungi, mold, earthworms, and bacteria in the
soil). (credit “fox”: modification of work by Kevin Bacher, NPS; credit “owl”: modification of work by

How Organisms Acquire Energy in a Food Web
All living things require energy in one form or another. At the cellular level, energy is used in most
metabolic pathways (usually in the form of ATP), especially those responsible for building large
molecules from smaller compounds. Living organisms would not be able to assemble complex organic
molecules (proteins, lipids, nucleic acids, and carbohydrates) without a constant energy input.
Food-web diagrams illustrate how energy flows directionally through ecosystems. They can also
indicate how efficiently organisms acquire energy, use it, and how much remains for use by other
organisms of the food web. Energy is acquired by living things in two ways: autotrophs harness light or
chemical energy and heterotrophs acquire energy through the consumption and digestion of other living
or previously living organisms.
Photosynthetic and chemosynthetic organisms are autotrophs, which are organisms capable of
synthesizing their own food (more specifically, capable of using inorganic carbon as a carbon source).
Photosynthetic autotrophs (photoautotrophs) use sunlight as an energy source, and chemosynthetic
autotrophs (chemoautotrophs) use inorganic molecules as an energy source. Autotrophs are critical
for ecosystems because they occupy the trophic level containing producers. Without these organisms,
energy would not be available to other living organisms, and life would not be possible.
Photoautotrophs, such as plants, algae, and photosynthetic bacteria, are the energy source for a
majority of the world’s ecosystems. Photoautotrophs harness the Sun’s solar energy by converting
it to chemical energy. The rate at which photosynthetic producers incorporate energy from the Sun
is called gross primary productivity. However, not all of the energy incorporated by producers is
available to the other organisms in the food web because producers must also grow and reproduce,
which consumes energy. Net primary productivity is the energy that remains in the producers after
accounting for these organisms’ metabolism and heat loss. The net productivity is then available to the
primary consumers at the next trophic level.

Environmental Biology 71

Chemoautotrophs are primarily bacteria and
archaea that are found in rare ecosystems where
sunlight is not available, such as those associated
with dark caves or hydrothermal vents at the
bottom of the ocean (Figure 6). Many
chemoautotrophs in hydrothermal vents use
hydrogen sulfide (H2S), which is released from
the vents, as a source of chemical energy. This
allows them to synthesize complex organic
molecules, such as glucose, for their own energy
and, in turn, supplies energy to the rest of the
ecosystem.
One of the most important consequences of
ecosystem dynamics in terms of human impact is
Figure 6. Swimming shrimp, a few squat lobsters, and
biomagnification. Biomagnification is

substances in organisms at each successive
this depth, the ecosystem is supported by
chemoautotrophic bacteria and organic material that sinks trophic level. These are substances that are
from the ocean’s surface. This picture was taken in 2006 at lipid soluble and are stored in the fat reserves of
the submerged NW Eifuku volcano off the coast of Japan

by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration

dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT), which
were described in the 1960s bestseller Silent
Spring by Rachel Carson. DDT was a commonly used pesticide before its dangers to apex consumers,
such as the bald eagle, became known. DDT and other toxins are taken in by producers and passed on to
successive levels of consumers at increasingly higher rates. As bald eagles feed on contaminated fish,
their DDT levels rise. It was discovered that DDT caused the eggshells of birds to become fragile, which
contributed to the bald eagle being listed as an endangered species under U.S. law. The use of DDT was
banned in the United States in the 1970s.

72 Matthew R. Fisher, Editor

Another substances that biomagnifies is
polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB), which was used
as coolant liquids in the United States until its use
was banned in 1979. PCB was best studied in
aquatic ecosystems where predatory fish species
accumulated very high concentrations of the
toxin that is otherwise exists at low
concentrations in the environment. As illustrated
in a study performed by the NOAA in the
Saginaw Bay of Lake Huron of the North
American Great Lakes (Figure 7 below), PCB
concentrations increased from the producers of
the ecosystem (phytoplankton) through the
different trophic levels of fish species. The apex
consumer, the walleye, has more than four times
the amount of PCBs compared to phytoplankton.
Also, research found that birds that eat these fish
may have PCB levels that are at least ten Figure 7. This chart shows the PCB concentrations found
at the various trophic levels in the Saginaw Bay ecosystem
times higher than those found in the lake fish.
Other concerns have been raised by the of Lake Huron. Notice that the fish in the higher trophic
levels accumulate more PCBs than those in lower trophic

mercury and cadmium, in certain types of
seafood. The United States Environmental
Protection Agency recommends that pregnant women and young children should not consume any
swordfish, shark, king mackerel, or tilefish because of their high mercury content. These individuals are
advised to eat fish low in mercury: salmon, shrimp, pollock, and catfish. Biomagnification is a good
example of how ecosystem dynamics can affect our everyday lives, even influencing the food we eat.

3.2 Biogeochemical Cycles

Energy flows directionally through ecosystems, entering as sunlight (or inorganic molecules for
chemoautotrophs) and leaving as heat during energy transformation between trophic levels. Rather than
flowing through an ecosystem, the matter that makes up organisms is conserved and recycled. The
six most common elements associated with organic molecules—carbon, nitrogen, hydrogen, oxygen,
phosphorus, and sulfur—take a variety of chemical forms and may exist for long periods in the
atmosphere, on land, in water, or beneath Earth’s surface. Geologic processes, such as weathering,
erosion, water drainage, and the subduction of the continental plates, all play a role in the cycling of
elements on Earth. Because geology and chemistry have major roles in the study of these processes,
the recycling of inorganic matter between living organisms and their nonliving environment
are called biogeochemical cycles.
The six aforementioned elements are used by organisms in a variety of ways. Hydrogen and oxygen
are found in water and organic molecules, both of which are essential to life. Carbon is found in
all organic molecules, whereas nitrogen is an important component of nucleic acids and proteins.
Phosphorus is used to make nucleic acids and the phospholipids that comprise biological
membranes. Lastly, sulfur is critical to the three-dimensional shape of proteins.
The cycling of these elements is interconnected. For example, the movement of water is critical for the
leaching of sulfur and phosphorus into rivers, lakes, and oceans. Minerals cycle through the biosphere
between the biotic and abiotic components and from one organism to another.
The Water Cycle
The hydrosphere is the area of Earth where water movement and storage occurs: as liquid water on the
surface (rivers, lakes, oceans) and beneath the surface (groundwater) or ice, (polar ice caps and glaciers),
and as water vapor in the atmosphere.The human body is about 60 percent water and human cells are
more than 70 percent water. Of the stores of water on Earth, 97.5 percent is salt water (see Figure 1
below). Of the remaining water, more than 99 percent is groundwater or ice. Thus, less than one percent
of freshwater is present in lakes and rivers. Many organisms are dependent on this small percentage, a
lack of which can have negative effects on ecosystems. Humans, of course, have developed technologies
to increase water availability, such as digging wells to harvest groundwater, storing rainwater, and using
desalination to obtain drinkable water from the ocean. Although this pursuit of drinkable water has been
ongoing throughout human history, the supply of fresh water continues to be a major issue in modern
times.
The various processes that occur during the cycling of water are illustrated in Figure 2 below. The
processes include the following:

73

74 Matthew R. Fisher, Editor

• evaporation and sublimation
• condensation and precipitation
• subsurface water flow
• surface runoff and snowmelt
• streamflow
The water cycle is driven by the Sun’s energy
as it warms the oceans and other surface waters.
This leads to evaporation (liquid water to water
vapor) of liquid surface water and sublimation
(ice to water vapor) of frozen water, thus moving
large amounts of water into the atmosphere as water vapor. Over time, this water vapor condenses into
clouds as liquid or frozen droplets and eventually leads to precipitation (rain, snow, hail), which returns
water to Earth’s surface. Rain reaching Earth’s surface may evaporate again, flow over the surface, or
percolate into the ground. Most easily observed is surface runoff: the flow of freshwater over land either
from rain or melting ice. Runoff can make its way through streams and lakes to the oceans.
In most natural terrestrial environments rain encounters vegetation before it reaches the soil surface. A
significant percentage of water evaporates immediately from the surfaces of plants. What is left reaches
the soil and begins to move down. Surface runoff will occur only if the soil becomes saturated with
water in a heavy rainfall. Water in the soil can be taken up by plant roots. The plant will use some of
this water for its own metabolism and some of that will find its way into animals that eat the plants, but
much of it will be lost back to the atmosphere through a process known as transpiration: water enters
the vascular system of plants through the roots and evaporates, or transpires, through the stomata (small
microscope openings) of the leaves. Ecologists combine transpiration and evaporation into a single term
that describes water returned to the atmosphere: evapotranspiration. Water in the soil that is not taken
up by a plant and that does not evaporate is able to percolate into the subsoil and bedrock where it forms
groundwater.
Groundwater is a significant, subsurface reservoir of fresh water. It exists in the pores between
particles in dirt, sand, and gravel or in the fissures in rocks. Groundwater can flow slowly through these
pores and fissures and eventually finds its way to a stream or lake where it becomes part of the surface
water again. Many streams flow not because they are replenished from rainwater directly but because
they receive a constant inflow from the groundwater below. Some groundwater is found very deep in
the bedrock and can persist there for millennia. Most groundwater reservoirs, or aquifers, are the source
of drinking or irrigation water drawn up through wells. In many cases these aquifers are being depleted
faster than they are being replenished by water percolating down from above.
Rain and surface runoff are major ways in which minerals, including phosphorus and sulfur, are
cycled from land to water. The environmental effects of runoff will be discussed later as these cycles are
described.

and less than 1 percent of fresh water is easily accessible

The Carbon Cycle
Carbon is the second most abundant element in organisms, by mass. Carbon is present in all organic
molecules (and some molecules that are not organic such as CO2), and its role in the structure of
biomolecules is of primary importance. Carbon compounds contain energy, and many of these
compounds from dead plants and algae have fossilized over millions of years and are known as fossil
fuels. Since the 1800s, the use of fossil fuels has accelerated. Since the beginning of the Industrial
Revolution the demand for Earth’s limited fossil fuel supplies has risen, causing the amount of carbon
dioxide in our atmosphere to drastically increase. This increase in carbon dioxide is associated with
climate change and is a major environmental concern worldwide.
The carbon cycle is most easily studied as two interconnected subcycles: one dealing with rapid
carbon exchange among living organisms and the other dealing with the long-term cycling of carbon
through geologic processes. The entire carbon cycle is shown in Figure 3 below.

76 Matthew R. Fisher, Editor

Figure 3. Carbon dioxide gas exists in the atmosphere and is dissolved in water. Photosynthesis converts carbon
dioxide gas to organic carbon, and respiration cycles the organic carbon back into carbon dioxide gas. Long-term
storage of organic carbon occurs when matter from living organisms is buried deep underground and becomes
fossilized. Volcanic activity and, more recently, human emissions bring this stored carbon back into the carbon cycle.

The Biological Carbon Cycle

Organisms are connected in many ways, even among different ecosystems. A good example of this
connection is the exchange of carbon between heterotrophs and autotrophs by way of atmospheric
carbon dioxide. Carbon dioxide (CO2) is the basic building block that autotrophs use to build highenergy compounds such as glucose. The energy harnessed from the Sun is used by these organisms to
form the covalent bonds that link carbon atoms together. These chemical bonds store this energy for later
use in the process of respiration. Most terrestrial autotrophs obtain their carbon dioxide directly from the
atmosphere, while marine autotrophs acquire it in the dissolved form (bicarbonate, HCO 3–).
Carbon is passed from producers to higher trophic levels through consumption. For example, when
a cow (primary consumer) eats grass (producer), it obtains some of the organic molecules originally
made by the plant’s photosynthesis. Those organic compounds can then be passed to higher trophic
levels, such as humans, when we eat the cow. At each level, however, organisms are performing
respiration, a process in which organic molecules are broken down to release energy. As these organic
molecules are broken down, carbon is removed from food molecules to form CO2, a gas that enters the
atmosphere. Thus, CO2 is a byproduct of respiration. Recall that CO2 is consumed by producers during
photosynthesis to make organic molecules. As these molecules are broken down during respiration,

Environmental Biology 77

the carbon once again enters the atmosphere as CO2. Carbon exchange like this potentially connects all
organisms on Earth. Think about this: the carbon in your DNA was once part of plant; millions of years
ago perhaps it was part of dinosaur.
The Biogeochemical Carbon Cycle

The movement of carbon through land, water, and air is complex, and, in many cases, it occurs much
more slowly than the movement between organisms. Carbon is stored for long periods in what are
known as carbon reservoirs, which include the atmosphere, bodies of liquid water (mostly oceans), ocean
sediment, soil, rocks (including fossil fuels), and Earth’s interior.
As stated, the atmosphere is a major reservoir of carbon in the form of carbon dioxide that is essential
to the process of photosynthesis. The level of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere is greatly influenced
by the reservoir of carbon in the oceans. The exchange of carbon between the atmosphere and water
reservoirs influences how much carbon is found in each. Carbon dioxide (CO2) from the atmosphere
dissolves in water and reacts with water molecules to form ionic compounds. Some of these ions
combine with calcium ions in the seawater to form calcium carbonate (CaCO3), a major component of
the shells of marine organisms. These organisms eventually die and their shells form sediments on the
ocean floor. Over geologic time, the calcium carbonate forms limestone, which comprises the largest
carbon reservoir on Earth.
On land, carbon is stored in soil as organic carbon as a result of the decomposition of organisms or
from weathering of terrestrial rock and minerals (the world’s soils hold significantly more carbon than
the atmosphere, for comparison). Deeper underground are fossil fuels, the anaerobically decomposed
remains of plants and algae that lived millions of years ago. Fossil fuels are considered a nonrenewable resource because their use far exceeds their rate of formation. A non-renewable resource is
either regenerated very slowly or not at all. Another way for carbon to enter the atmosphere is
from land (including land beneath the surface of the ocean) by the eruption of volcanoes and other
geothermal systems. Carbon sediments from the ocean floor are taken deep within Earth by the process
of subduction: the movement of one tectonic plate beneath another. Carbon is released as carbon
dioxide when a volcano erupts or from volcanic hydrothermal vents.
The Nitrogen Cycle
Getting nitrogen into living organisms is difficult. Plants and phytoplankton are not equipped to
incorporate nitrogen from the atmosphere (where it exists as tightly bonded, triple covalent N2) even
though this molecule comprises approximately 78 percent of the atmosphere. Nitrogen enters the
living world through free-living and symbiotic bacteria, which incorporate nitrogen into their organic
molecules through specialized biochemical processes. Certain species of bacteria are able to perform
nitrogen fixation, the process of converting nitrogen gas into ammonia (NH3), which spontaneously
becomes ammonium (NH4+). Ammonium is converted by bacteria into nitrites (NO2−) and then nitrates
(NO3−). At this point, the nitrogen-containing molecules are used by plants and other producers to make
organic molecules such as DNA and proteins. This nitrogen is now available to consumers.
Organic nitrogen is especially important to the study of ecosystem dynamics because many ecosystem
processes, such as primary production, are limited by the available supply of nitrogen. As shown
in Figure 4 below, the nitrogen that enters living systems is eventually converted from organic nitrogen
back into nitrogen gas by bacteria (Figure 4). The process of denitrification is when bacteria convert
the nitrates into nitrogen gas, thus allowing it to re-enter the atmosphere.

78 Matthew R. Fisher, Editor

Figure 4. Nitrogen enters the living world from the atmosphere via nitrogen-fixing bacteria. This nitrogen and
nitrogenous waste from animals is then processed back into gaseous nitrogen by soil bacteria, which also supply
terrestrial food webs with the organic nitrogen they need. (credit: “Nitrogen cycle” by Johann Dréo & Raeky is

Human activity can alter the nitrogen cycle by two primary means: the combustion of fossil fuels,
which releases different nitrogen oxides, and by the use of artificial fertilizers (which contain nitrogen
and phosphorus compounds) in agriculture, which are then washed into lakes, streams, and rivers
by surface runoff. Atmospheric nitrogen (other than N2) is associated with several effects on Earth’s
ecosystems including the production of acid rain (as nitric acid, HNO3) and greenhouse gas effects (as
nitrous oxide, N2O), potentially causing climate change. A major effect from fertilizer runoff is saltwater
and freshwater eutrophication, a process whereby nutrient runoff causes the overgrowth of algae, the
depletion of oxygen, and death of aquatic fauna.
In marine ecosystems, nitrogen compounds created by bacteria, or through decomposition, collects
in ocean floor sediments. It can then be moved to land in geologic time by uplift of Earth’s crust and
thereby incorporated into terrestrial rock. Although the movement of nitrogen from rock directly into
living systems has been traditionally seen as insignificant compared with nitrogen fixed from the
atmosphere, a recent study showed that this process may indeed be significant and should be included in
any study of the global nitrogen cycle.

Environmental Biology 79

The Phosphorus Cycle
Phosphorus is an essential nutrient for living processes. It is a major component of nucleic acids
and phospholipids, and, as calcium phosphate, it makes up the supportive components of our bones.
Phosphorus is often the limiting nutrient (necessary for growth) in aquatic, particularly freshwater,
ecosystems.
Phosphorus occurs in nature as the phosphate ion (PO43-). In addition to phosphate runoff as a result
of human activity, natural surface runoff occurs when it is leached from phosphate-containing rock
by weathering, thus sending phosphates into rivers, lakes, and the ocean. This rock has its origins in
the ocean. Phosphate-containing ocean sediments form primarily from the bodies of ocean organisms
and from their excretions. However, volcanic ash, aerosols, and mineral dust may also be significant
phosphate sources. This sediment then is moved to land over geologic time by the uplifting of Earth’s
surface. (Figure below)
Phosphorus is also reciprocally exchanged between phosphate dissolved in the ocean and marine
organisms. The movement of phosphate from the ocean to the land and through the soil is extremely
slow, with the average phosphate ion having an oceanic residence time between 20,000 and 100,000
years.

Figure 5. In nature, phosphorus exists as the phosphate ion (PO43-). Weathering of rocks and volcanic activity
releases phosphate into the soil, water, and air, where it becomes available to terrestrial food webs. Phosphate enters
the oceans in surface runoff, groundwater flow, and river flow. Phosphate dissolved in ocean water cycles into marine
food webs. Some phosphate from the marine food webs falls to the ocean floor, where it forms sediment. (credit:

80 Matthew R. Fisher, Editor

Excess phosphorus and nitrogen that enter these ecosystems from fertilizer runoff and from sewage
cause excessive growth of algae. The subsequent death and decay of these organisms depletes dissolved
oxygen, which leads to the death of aquatic organisms such as shellfish and fish. This process is
responsible for dead zones in lakes and at the mouths of many major rivers and for massive fish kills,
which often occur during the summer months (see Figure 6 below).

Figure 6. Dead zones occur when phosphorus and nitrogen from fertilizers cause excessive growth of microorganisms,
which depletes oxygen and kills fauna. Worldwide, large dead zones are found in coastal areas of high population
density. (credit: NASA Earth Observatory)

A dead zone is an area in lakes and oceans near the mouths of rivers where large areas are periodically
depleted of their normal flora and fauna. These zones are caused by eutrophication coupled with other
factors including oil spills, dumping toxic chemicals, and other human activities. The number of dead
zones has increased for several years, and more than 400 of these zones were present as of 2008. One
of the worst dead zones is off the coast of the United States in the Gulf of Mexico: fertilizer runoff from
the Mississippi River basin created a dead zone of over 8,463 square miles. Phosphate and nitrate runoff
from fertilizers also negatively affect several lake and bay ecosystems including the Chesapeake Bay in
the eastern United States.
The Sulfur Cycle
Sulfur is an essential element for the molecules of living things. As part of the amino acid cysteine, it
is involved in the formation of proteins. As shown in Figure 7 below, sulfur cycles between the oceans,
land, and atmosphere. Atmospheric sulfur is found in the form of sulfur dioxide (SO2), which enters the
atmosphere in three ways: first, from the decomposition of organic molecules; second, from volcanic
activity and geothermal vents; and, third, from the burning of fossil fuels by humans.

Environmental Biology 81

Figure 7. Sulfur dioxide from the atmosphere becomes available to terrestrial and marine ecosystems when it is
dissolved in precipitation as weak sulfuric acid or when it falls directly to Earth as fallout. Weathering of rocks also
makes sulfates available to terrestrial ecosystems. Decomposition of living organisms returns sulfates to the ocean,
soil, and atmosphere. (credit: modification of work by John M. Evans and Howard Perlman, USGS)

On land, sulfur is deposited in four major ways: precipitation, direct fallout from the atmosphere, rock
weathering, and geothermal vents. Atmospheric sulfur is found in the form of sulfur dioxide (SO2), and
as rain falls through the atmosphere, sulfur is dissolved in the form of weak sulfuric acid (H2SO4). Sulfur
can also fall directly from the atmosphere in a process called fallout. Also, as sulfur-containing rocks
weather, sulfur is released into the soil. These rocks originate from ocean sediments that are moved to
land by the geologic uplifting of ocean sediments. Terrestrial ecosystems can then make use of these
soil sulfates (SO42-), which enter the food web by being taken up by plant roots. When these plants
decompose and die, sulfur is released back into the atmosphere as hydrogen sulfide (H2S) gas.
Sulfur enters the ocean in runoff from land, from atmospheric fallout, and from underwater
geothermal vents. Some ecosystems rely on chemoautotrophs using sulfur as a biological energy source.
This sulfur then supports marine ecosystems in the form of sulfates.
Human activities have played a major role in altering the balance of the global sulfur cycle. The
burning of large quantities of fossil fuels, especially from coal, releases larger amounts of hydrogen
sulfide gas into the atmosphere. As rain falls through this gas, it creates the phenomenon known as
acid rain, which damages the natural environment by lowering the pH of lakes, thus killing many of the
resident plants and animals. Acid rain is corrosive rain caused by rainwater falling to the ground through
sulfur dioxide gas, turning it into weak sulfuric acid, which causes damage to aquatic ecosystems. Acid
rain also affects the man-made environment through the chemical degradation of buildings. For example,

82 Matthew R. Fisher, Editor

many marble monuments, such as the Lincoln Memorial in Washington, DC, have suffered significant
damage from acid rain over the years. These examples show the wide-ranging effects of human activities
on our environment and the challenges that remain for our future.

3.3 Terrestrial Biomes

Figure 1. Each of the world’s eight major biomes is distinguished by characteristic temperatures and amount of
precipitation. Polar ice caps and mountains are also shown.

There are eight major terrestrial biomes: tropical rainforests, savannas, subtropical deserts, chaparral,
temperate grasslands, temperate forests, boreal forests, and Arctic tundra. Biomes are large-scale
environments that are distinguished by characteristic temperature ranges and amounts of precipitation.
These two variables affect the types of vegetation and animal life that can exist in those areas. Because
each biome is defined by climate, the same biome can occur in geographically distinct areas with
similar climates (Figures 1 and 2).

contrast to forests farther from the equator. This on terrestrial biome” by Navarras is in the Public Domain,
lack of temperature seasonality leads to year- CC0
round plant growth rather than just seasonal
growth. In contrast to other ecosystems, a consistent daily amount of sunlight (11–12 hours per day yearround) provides more solar radiation and therefore more opportunity for primary productivity.
The annual rainfall in tropical rainforests ranges from 125 to 660 cm (50–200 in) with considerable
seasonal variation. Tropical rainforests have wet months in which there can be more than 30 cm (11–12
in) of precipitation, as well as dry months in which there are fewer than 10 cm (3.5 in) of rainfall.
However, the driest month of a tropical rainforest can still exceed the annual rainfall of some other
biomes, such as deserts.Tropical rainforests have high net primary productivity because the annual
temperatures and precipitation values support rapid plant growth. However, the high amounts of rainfall
leaches nutrients from the soils of these forests.

Environmental Biology 85

Tropical rainforests are characterized by
vertical layering of vegetation and the formation
of distinct habitats for animals within each layer.
On the forest floor is a sparse layer of plants and
decaying plant matter. Above that is an
understory of short, shrubby foliage. A layer of
trees rises above this understory and is topped by
a closed upper canopy—the uppermost overhead
layer of branches and leaves. Some additional
trees emerge through this closed upper canopy.
These layers provide diverse and complex
habitats for the variety of plants, animals, and
other organisms. Many species of animals use the
variety of plants and the complex structure of the

forests, such as these forests of Madre de Dios, Peru, near

rarely descending to the forest floor.
Savannas are grasslands with scattered trees and are
found in Africa, South America, and northern Australia
(Figure 4 below). Savannas are hot, tropical areas with
temperatures averaging from 24oC –29oC (75oF –84oF)
and an annual rainfall of 51–127 cm (20–50 in). Savannas
have an extensive dry season and consequent fires. As a
result, there are relatively few trees scattered in the grasses
and forbs (herbaceous flowering plants) that dominate the
savanna. Because fire is an important source of
disturbance in this biome, plants have evolved welldeveloped root systems that allow them to quickly resprout after a fire.

create rainfall, and vice versa.

Subtropical deserts exist between 15o and 30o
north and south latitude and are centered on the
Tropic of Cancer and the Tropic of Capricorn
(Figure 6 below). Deserts are frequently located
on the downwind or lee side of mountain ranges,
which create a rain shadow after prevailing winds
drop their water content on the mountains. This is
typical of the North American deserts, such as the
Mohave and Sonoran deserts. Deserts in other
regions, such as the Sahara Desert in northern
Africa or the Namib Desert in southwestern
Africa are dry because of the high-pressure, dry
air descending at those latitudes. Subtropical
deserts are very dry; evaporation typically

exceeds precipitation. Subtropical hot deserts can

characterized by low annual precipitation of
fewer than 30 cm (12 in) with little monthly variation and lack of predictability in rainfall. Some years
may receive tiny amounts of rainfall, while others receive more. In some cases, the annual rainfall can
be as low as 2 cm (0.8 in) in subtropical deserts located in central Australia (“the Outback”) and northern
Africa.
The low species diversity of this biome is closely related
to its low and unpredictable precipitation. Despite the
relatively low diversity, desert species exhibit fascinating
adaptations to the harshness of their environment. Very dry
deserts lack perennial vegetation that lives from one year
to the next; instead, many plants are annuals that grow
quickly and reproduce when rainfall does occur, then they
die. Perennial plants in deserts are characterized by
adaptations that conserve water: deep roots, reduced
foliage, and water-storing stems (Figure 6 below). Seed
plants in the desert produce seeds that can lie dormant for
extended periods between rains. Most animal life in Figure 6. A MinuteEarth video about the global
subtropical deserts has adapted to a nocturnal life, climate patterns which lead to subtropical
spending the hot daytime hours beneath the ground. The deserts.
Namib Desert is the oldest on the planet, and has probably
been dry for more than 55 million years. It supports a number of endemic species (species found only
there) because of this great age. For example, the unusual gymnosperm Welwitschia mirabilis is the only
extant species of an entire order of plants. There are also five species of reptiles considered endemic to
the Namib.
In addition to subtropical deserts there are cold deserts that experience freezing temperatures during
the winter and any precipitation is in the form of snowfall. The largest of these deserts are the Gobi
Desert in northern China and southern Mongolia, the Taklimakan Desert in western China, the Turkestan
Desert, and the Great Basin Desert of the United States.

Environmental Biology 87

Figure 7. Many desert plants have tiny leaves or no leaves at all to reduce water loss. The leaves of ocotillo, shown
here in the Chihuahuan Desert in Big Bend National Park, Texas, appear only after rainfall and then are shed. (credit
“bare ocotillo”: “Leaflet”/Wikimedia Commons)

The chaparral is also called scrub forest and is found in California, along the Mediterranean Sea, and
along the southern coast of Australia (Figure 7 below). The annual rainfall in this biome ranges from 65
cm to 75 cm (25.6–29.5 in) and the majority of the rain falls in the winter. Summers are very dry and
many chaparral plants are dormant during the summertime. The chaparral vegetation is dominated by
shrubs and is adapted to periodic fires, with some plants producing seeds that germinate only after a hot
fire. The ashes left behind after a fire are rich in nutrients like nitrogen and fertilize the soil, promoting
plant regrowth. Fire is a natural part of the maintenance of this biome.
Temperate grasslands are found throughout
central North America, where they are also
known as prairies, and in Eurasia, where they are
known as steppes (Figure 8 below). Temperate
grasslands have pronounced annual fluctuations
in temperature with hot summers and cold
winters. The annual temperature variation
produces specific growing seasons for plants.
Plant growth is possible when temperatures are
warm enough to sustain plant growth, which
occurs in the spring, summer, and fall.
Annual precipitation ranges from 25.4 cm to
88.9 cm (10–35 in). Temperate grasslands have

rivers or streams. The dominant vegetation tends
to consist of grasses. The treeless condition is
maintained by low precipitation, frequent fires, and grazing. The vegetation is very dense and the soils
are fertile because the subsurface of the soil is packed with the roots and rhizomes (underground stems)
of these grasses. The roots and rhizomes act to anchor plants into the ground and replenish the organic
material (humus) in the soil when they die and decay.

88 Matthew R. Fisher, Editor

Fires, which are a natural disturbance in temperate
grasslands, can be ignited by lightning strikes. It also
appears that the lightning-caused fire regime in North
American grasslands was enhanced by intentional
burning by humans. When fire is suppressed in
temperate grasslands, the vegetation eventually
converts to scrub and dense forests. Often, the
restoration or management of temperate grasslands
requires the use of controlled burns to suppress the
growth of trees and maintain the grasses.
Temperate forests are the most common biome in Figure 9. The American bison (Bison bison), more
eastern North America, Western Europe, Eastern Asia, commonly called the buffalo, is a grazing mammal
that once populated American prairies in huge
Chile, and New Zealand (Figure 9 below). This biome

is
found
throughout
mid-latitude
regions.
Temperatures range between –30oC and 30oC (–22oF
to 86oF) and drop to below freezing on an annual basis. These temperatures mean that temperate forests
have defined growing seasons during the spring, summer, and early fall. Precipitation is relatively
constant throughout the year and ranges between 75 cm and 150 cm (29.5–59 in).
Deciduous trees are the dominant plant in this biome with fewer evergreen conifers. Deciduous trees
lose their leaves each fall and remain leafless in the winter. Thus, little photosynthesis occurs during
the dormant winter period. Each spring, new leaves appear as temperature increases. Because of the
dormant period, the net primary productivity of temperate forests is less than that of tropical rainforests.
In addition, temperate forests show far less diversity of tree species than tropical rainforest biomes.
The trees of the temperate forests leaf out and shade much of the ground. However, more sunlight
reaches the ground in this biome than in tropical rainforests because trees in temperate forests do not
grow as tall as the trees in tropical rainforests. The soils of the temperate forests are rich in inorganic
and organic nutrients compared to tropical rainforests. This is because of the thick layer of leaf litter on
forest floors and reduced leaching of nutrients by rainfall. As this leaf litter decays, nutrients are returned
to the soil. The leaf litter also protects soil from erosion, insulates the ground, and provides habitats for
invertebrates and their predators.
The boreal forest, also known as taiga or
coniferous forest, is found roughly between
50oand 60o north latitude across most of Canada,
Alaska, Russia, and northern Europe (Figure 10
below). Boreal forests are also found above a
certain elevation (and below high elevations
where trees cannot grow) in mountain ranges
throughout the Northern Hemisphere. This biome
has cold, dry winters and short, cool, wet
summers. The annual precipitation is from 40 cm
to 100 cm (15.7–39 in) and usually takes the form
of snow; relatively little evaporation occurs
because of the cool temperatures.
The long and cold winters in the boreal forest

cone-bearing plants. These are evergreen

Environmental Biology 89

coniferous trees like pines, spruce, and fir, which retain their needle-shaped leaves year-round.
Evergreen trees can photosynthesize earlier in the spring than deciduous trees because less energy from
the Sun is required to warm a needle-like leaf than a broad leaf. Evergreen trees grow faster than
deciduous trees in the boreal forest. In addition, soils in boreal forest regions tend to be acidic with little
available nitrogen. Leaves are a nitrogen-rich structure and deciduous trees must produce a new set of
these nitrogen-rich structures each year. Therefore, coniferous trees that retain nitrogen-rich needles in
a nitrogen limiting environment may have had a competitive advantage over the broad-leafed deciduous
trees.
The net primary productivity of boreal forests
is lower than that of temperate forests and tropical
wet forests. The aboveground biomass of boreal
forests is high because these slow-growing tree
species are long-lived and accumulate standing
biomass over time. Species diversity is less than
that seen in temperate forests and tropical
rainforests. Boreal forests lack the layered forest
structure seen in tropical rainforests or, to a lesser
degree, temperate forests. The structure of a
boreal forest is often only a tree layer and a
ground layer. When conifer needles are dropped,
they decompose more slowly than broad leaves; Figure 11. The boreal forest (taiga) has low lying plants
therefore, fewer nutrients are returned to the soil and conifer trees. (credit: L.B. Brubaker, NOAA)
to fuel plant growth.
The Arctic tundra lies north of the subarctic boreal forests and is located throughout the Arctic regions
of the Northern Hemisphere. Tundra also exists at elevations above the tree line on mountains. The
average winter temperature is –34°C (–29.2°F) and the average summer temperature is 3°C–12°C (37°F
–52°F). Plants in the Arctic tundra have a short growing season of approximately 50–60 days. However,
during this time, there are almost 24 hours of daylight and plant growth is rapid. The annual precipitation
of the Arctic tundra is low (15–25 cm or 6–10 in) with little annual variation in precipitation. And, as in
the boreal forests, there is little evaporation because of the cold temperatures.
Plants in the Arctic tundra are generally low to
the ground and include low shrubs, grasses,
lichens, and small flowering plants (Figure 11
below). There is little species diversity, low net
primary productivity, and low above-ground
biomass. The soils of the Arctic tundra may
remain in a perennially frozen state referred to as
permafrost. The permafrost makes it impossible
for roots to penetrate far into the soil and slows
the decay of organic matter, which inhibits the
release of nutrients from organic matter. The

temperatures and long days permit it. During the
growing season, the ground of the Arctic tundra can be completely covered with plants or lichens.

3.4 Aquatic Biomes

Abiotic Factors Influencing Aquatic Biomes
Like terrestrial biomes, aquatic biomes are influenced by a series of abiotic factors. The aquatic
medium—water— has different physical and chemical properties than air. Even if the water in a pond
or other body of water is perfectly clear (there are no suspended particles), water still absorbs light.
As one descends into a deep body of water, there will eventually be a depth which the sunlight cannot
reach. While there are some abiotic and biotic factors in a terrestrial ecosystem that might obscure
light (like fog, dust, or insect swarms), usually these are not permanent features of the environment.
The importance of light in aquatic biomes is central to the communities of organisms found in both
freshwater and marine ecosystems. In freshwater systems, stratification due to differences in density
is perhaps the most critical abiotic factor and is related to the energy aspects of light. The thermal
properties of water (rates of heating and cooling) are significant to the function of marine systems and
have major impacts on global climate and weather patterns. Marine systems are also influenced by largescale physical water movements, such as currents; these are less important in most freshwater lakes.
The ocean is categorized by several areas or
zones (Figure 1). All of the ocean’s open water is
referred to as the pelagic zone. The benthic zone
extends along the ocean bottom from the
shoreline to the deepest parts of the ocean floor.
Within the pelagic realm is the photic zone,
which is the portion of the ocean that light can
penetrate (approximately 200 m or 650 ft). At
depths greater than 200 m, light cannot penetrate;
thus, this is referred to as the aphotic zone. The
majority of the ocean is aphotic and lacks
sufficient light for photosynthesis. The deepest

on water depth and distance from the shoreline.
part of the ocean, the Challenger Deep (in the
Mariana Trench, located in the western Pacific
Ocean), is about 11,000 m (about 6.8 mi) deep. To give some perspective on the depth of this trench, the
ocean is, on average, 4267 m. These zones are relevant to freshwater lakes as well.

Marine Biomes
The ocean is the largest marine biome. It is a continuous body of salt water that is relatively uniform
in chemical composition; it is a weak solution of mineral salts and decayed biological matter. Within the
ocean, coral reefs are a second kind of marine biome. Estuaries, coastal areas where salt water and fresh
water mix, form a third unique marine biome.

Ocean
The physical diversity of the ocean is a significant influence on plants, animals, and other organisms.
The ocean is categorized into different zones based on how far light reaches into the water. Each zone
has a distinct group of species adapted to the biotic and abiotic conditions particular to that zone.
The intertidal zone, which is the zone between high and low tide, is the oceanic region that is closest
to land (Figure 2). Generally, most people think of this portion of the ocean as a sandy beach. In some
cases, the intertidal zone is indeed a sandy beach, but it can also be rocky or muddy. Organisms are
exposed to air and sunlight at low tide and are underwater most of the time, especially during high tide.
Therefore, living things that thrive in the intertidal zone are adapted to being dry for long periods of
time. The shore of the intertidal zone is also repeatedly struck by waves, and the organisms found there
are adapted to withstand damage from the pounding action of the waves (Figure 2). The exoskeletons
of shoreline crustaceans (such as the shore crab, Carcinus maenas) are tough and protect them from
desiccation (drying out) and wave damage. Another consequence of the pounding waves is that few
algae and plants establish themselves in the constantly moving rocks, sand, or mud.
The neritic zone (Figure 1) extends from the
intertidal zone to depths of about 200 m (or 650
ft) at the edge of the continental shelf.
Because light can penetrate this depth,
photosynthesis can occur. The water here
contains silt and is well-oxygenated, low in
pressure,
and
stable
in
temperature.
Phytoplankton and floating Sargassum (a type of
free-floating marine seaweed) provide a habitat
for some sea life found in the neritic zone.
Zooplankton, protists, small fishes, and shrimp
are found in the neritic zone and are the base of
the food chain for most of the world’s fisheries.
Figure 2. Sea urchins, mussel shells, and starfish are often

known as the oceanic zone (Figure 1). Within the Alaska. (credit: NOAA)
oceanic zone there is thermal stratification where
warm and cold waters mix because of ocean currents. Abundant plankton serve as the base of the food
chain for larger animals such as whales and dolphins. Nutrients are scarce and this is a relatively less
productive part of the marine biome. When photosynthetic organisms and the protists and animals that
feed on them die, their bodies fall to the bottom of the ocean where they remain. The majority of
organisms in the aphotic zone include sea cucumbers (phylum Echinodermata) and other organisms that
survive on the nutrients contained in the dead bodies of organisms in the photic zone.
The deepest part of the ocean is the abyssal zone, which is at depths of 4000 m or greater. The
abyssal zone (Figure 1) is very cold and has very high pressure, high oxygen content, and low nutrient
content. There are a variety of invertebrates and fishes found in this zone, but the abyssal zone does not
have plants because of the lack of light. Cracks in the Earth’s crust called hydrothermal vents are found
primarily in the abyssal zone. Around these vents chemosynthetic bacteria utilize the hydrogen sulfide
and other minerals emitted as an energy source and serve as the base of the food chain found in the
abyssal zone.
Beneath the water is the benthic zone (Figure 1), which is comprised of sand, silt, and dead
organisms. This is a nutrient-rich portion of the ocean because of the dead organisms that fall from the

Environmental Biology 93

upper layers of the ocean. Because of this high level of nutrients, a diversity of sponges, sea anemones,
marine worms, sea stars, fishes, and bacteria exist.
Coral Reefs
Coral reefs are characterized by high biodiversity and
the structures created by invertebrates that live in warm,
shallow waters within the photic zone of the ocean. They
are mostly found within 30 degrees north and south of the
equator. The Great Barrier Reef is a well-known reef
system located several miles off the northeastern coast of
Australia. The coral organisms (members of phylum
Cnidaria) are colonies of saltwater polyps that secrete a
calcium carbonate skeleton. These calcium-rich
skeletons slowly accumulate, forming the underwater
reef (Figure 3). Corals found in shallower waters (at a
depth of approximately 60 m or about 200 ft) have a
mutualistic relationship with photosynthetic unicellular
algae. The relationship provides corals with the majority
of the nutrition and the energy they require. The waters
in which these corals live are nutritionally poor and,
without this mutualism, it would not be possible for large
corals to grow. Some corals living in deeper and colder
water do not have a mutualistic relationship with algae;
these corals attain energy and nutrients using stinging
cells on their tentacles to capture prey. It is estimated that
more than 4,000 fish species inhabit coral reefs. These
fishes can feed on coral, other invertebrates, or the
seaweed and algae that are associated with the coral.

carbonate skeletons of coral organisms, which are

EVOLUTION CONNECTION: Global Decline of Coral Reefs

Link to Learning: Watch this
National Oceanic and Atmospheric
Administration (NOAA) video to see
marine ecologist Dr. Peter Etnoyer
discusses his research on coral
organisms.

It takes a long time to build a coral reef. The animals that create coral
reefs have evolved over millions of years, continuing to slowly
deposit the calcium carbonate that forms their characteristic ocean
homes. Bathed in warm tropical waters, the coral animals and their
symbiotic algal partners evolved to survive at the upper limit of
ocean water temperature.
Together, climate change and human activity pose dual threats to
the long-term survival of the world’s coral reefs. As global warming
due to fossil fuel emissions raises ocean temperatures, coral reefs are
suffering. The excessive warmth causes the reefs to expel their
symbiotic, food-producing algae, resulting in a phenomenon known
as bleaching. When bleaching occurs, the reefs lose much of their
characteristic color as the algae and the coral animals die if loss of the
symbiotic zooxanthellae is prolonged.

94 Matthew R. Fisher, Editor

Rising levels of atmospheric carbon dioxide further threaten the corals in other ways; as CO2dissolves
in ocean waters, it lowers the pH and increases ocean acidity. As acidity increases, it interferes with the
calcification that normally occurs as coral animals build their calcium carbonate homes.
When a coral reef begins to die, species diversity plummets as animals lose food and shelter. Coral
reefs are also economically important tourist destinations, so the decline of coral reefs poses a serious
threat to coastal economies.
Human population growth has damaged corals in other ways, too. As human coastal populations
increase, the runoff of sediment and agricultural chemicals has increased, too, causing some of the onceclear tropical waters to become cloudy. At the same time, overfishing of popular fish species has allowed
the predator species that eat corals to go unchecked.
Although a rise in global temperatures of 1–2˚C (a conservative scientific projection) in the coming
decades may not seem large, it is very significant to this biome. When change occurs rapidly, species can
become extinct before evolution leads to new adaptations. Many scientists believe that global warming,
with its rapid (in terms of evolutionary time) and inexorable increases in temperature, is tipping the
balance beyond the point at which many of the world’s coral reefs can recover.
Estuaries: Where the Ocean Meets Fresh Water
Estuaries are biomes that occur where a source of fresh water, such as a river, meets the ocean.
Therefore, both fresh water and salt water are found in the same vicinity; mixing results in a diluted
(brackish) saltwater. Estuaries form protected areas where many of the young offspring of crustaceans,
mollusks, and fish begin their lives. Salinity is a very important factor that influences the organisms and
the adaptations of the organisms found in estuaries. The salinity of estuaries varies and is based on the
rate of flow of its freshwater sources. Once or twice a day, high tides bring salt water into the estuary.
Low tides occurring at the same frequency reverse the current of salt water.
The short-term and rapid variation in salinity due to the mixing of fresh water and salt water is a
difficult physiological challenge for the plants and animals that inhabit estuaries. Many estuarine plant
species are halophytes: plants that can tolerate salty conditions. Halophytic plants are adapted to deal
with the salinity resulting from saltwater on their roots or from sea spray. In some halophytes, filters in
the roots remove the salt from the water that the plant absorbs. Other plants are able to pump oxygen
into their roots. Animals, such as mussels and clams (phylum Mollusca), have developed behavioral
adaptations that expend a lot of energy to function in this rapidly changing environment. When these
animals are exposed to low salinity, they stop feeding, close their shells, and switch from aerobic
respiration (in which they use gills) to anaerobic respiration (a process that does not require oxygen).
When high tide returns to the estuary, the salinity and oxygen content of the water increases, and these
animals open their shells, begin feeding, and return to aerobic respiration.

Freshwater Biomes
Freshwater biomes include lakes and ponds (standing water) as well as rivers and streams (flowing
water). They also include wetlands, which will be discussed later. Humans rely on freshwater biomes
to provide aquatic resources for drinking water, crop irrigation, sanitation, and industry. These various
roles and human benefits are referred to as ecosystem services. Lakes and ponds are found in terrestrial
landscapes and are, therefore, connected with abiotic and biotic factors influencing these terrestrial
biomes.

Environmental Biology 95

Lakes and Ponds
Lakes and ponds can range in area from a few square meters to thousands of square kilometers.
Temperature is an important abiotic factor affecting living things found in lakes and ponds. In the
summer, thermal stratification of lakes and ponds occurs when the upper layer of water is warmed by the
sun and does not mix with deeper, cooler water. Light can penetrate within the photic zone of the lake
or pond. Phytoplankton (small photosynthetic organisms such as algae and cyanobacteria that float in
the water) are found here and carry out photosynthesis, providing the base of the food web of lakes and
ponds. Zooplankton (very small animals that float in the water), such as rotifers and small crustaceans,
consume these phytoplankton. At the bottom of lakes and ponds, bacteria in the aphotic zone break down
dead organisms that sink to the bottom.
Nitrogen and phosphorus are important
limiting nutrients in lakes and ponds. Because of
this, they are determining factors in the amount of
phytoplankton growth in lakes and ponds. When
there is a large input of nitrogen and phosphorus
(from sewage and runoff from fertilized lawns
and farms, for example), the growth of algae
skyrockets, resulting in a large accumulation of
algae called an algal bloom. Algal blooms
(Figure 4) can become so extensive that they
reduce light penetration in water. As a result, the
lake or pond becomes aphotic and photosynthetic
plants rooted in the lake bottom cannot survive.
When the algae die and decompose, severe

oxygen depletion of the water occurs. Fishes and resulted in an algal bloom. (credit: Jeremy Nettleton)
other organisms that require oxygen are then
more likely to die, and resulting dead zones are
found across the globe. Lake Erie and the Gulf of Mexico represent freshwater and marine habitats
where phosphorus control and storm water runoff pose significant environmental challenges.
Rivers and Streams
Rivers and streams are continuously moving bodies of water that carry large amounts of water from the
source, or headwater, to a lake or ocean. The largest rivers include the Nile River in Africa, the Amazon
River in South America, and the Mississippi River in North America.
Abiotic features of rivers and streams vary along the length of the river or stream. Streams begin at a
point of origin referred to as source water. The source water is usually cold, low in nutrients, and clear.
The channel (the width of the river or stream) is narrower than at any other place along the length of
the river or stream. Because of this, the current is often faster here than at any other point of the river or
stream.
The fast-moving water results in minimal silt accumulation at the bottom of the river or stream,
therefore the water is clear. Photosynthesis here is mostly attributed to algae that are growing on rocks;
the swift current inhibits the growth of phytoplankton. An additional input of energy can come from
leaves or other organic material that falls into the river or stream from trees and other plants that border
the water. When the leaves decompose, the organic material and nutrients in the leaves are returned to

96 Matthew R. Fisher, Editor

the water. Plants and animals have adapted to this fast-moving water. For instance, leeches (phylum
Annelida) have elongated bodies and suckers on both ends. These suckers attach to the substrate,
keeping the leech anchored in place. Freshwater trout species (phylum Chordata) are an important
predator in these fast-moving rivers and streams.
As the river or stream flows away from the source, the width of the channel gradually widens and
the current slows. This slow-moving water, caused by the gradient decrease and the volume increase as
tributaries unite, has more sedimentation. Phytoplankton can also be suspended in slow-moving water.
Therefore, the water will not be as clear as it is near the source. The water is also warmer. Worms
(phylum Annelida) and insects (phylum Arthropoda) can be found burrowing into the mud. The higher
order predator vertebrates (phylum Chordata) include waterfowl, frogs, and fishes. These predators must
find food in these slow moving, sometimes murky, waters and, unlike the trout in the waters at the
source, these vertebrates may not be able to use vision as their primary sense to find food. Instead, they
are more likely to use taste or chemical cues to find prey.
Wetlands
Wetlands are environments in which the soil is
either permanently or periodically saturated with
water. Wetlands are different from lakes because
wetlands are shallow bodies of water that may
periodically dry out. Emergent vegetation
consists of wetland plants that are rooted in the
soil but have portions of leaves, stems, and
flowers extending above the water’s surface.
There are several types of wetlands including
marshes, swamps, bogs, mudflats, and salt
marshes (Figure 5).

Summary
Ecosystems exist underground, on land, at sea, and in the air. Organisms in an ecosystem acquire energy
in a variety of ways, which is transferred between trophic levels as the energy flows from the base to
the top of the food web, with energy being lost at each transfer. Mineral nutrients are cycled through
ecosystems and their environment. Of particular importance are water, carbon, nitrogen, phosphorus,
and sulfur. All of these cycles have major impacts on ecosystem structure and function. Ecosystems
have been damaged by a variety of human activities that alter the natural biogeochemical cycles due
to pollution, oil spills, and events causing global climate change. The health of the biosphere depends
on understanding these cycles and how to protect the environment from irreversible damage. Earth has
terrestrial and aquatic biomes. There are eight major terrestrial biomes: tropical rainforests, savannas,
subtropical deserts, chaparral, temperate grasslands, temperate forests, boreal forests, and Arctic tundra.
Temperature and precipitation, and variations in both, are key abiotic factors that shape the composition
of animal and plant communities in terrestrial biomes. Sunlight is an important factor in bodies of water,
especially those that are very deep, because of the role of photosynthesis in sustaining certain organisms.
Other important factors include temperature, water movement, and salt content. Aquatic biomes include
both freshwater and marine environments. Like terrestrial biomes, aquatic biomes are influenced by
abiotic factors. In the case of aquatic biomes the abiotic factors include light, temperature, flow regime,
and dissolved solids.

4.1 Population Demographics & Dynamics

Imagine sailing down a river in a small motorboat on a weekend afternoon; the water is smooth, and
you are enjoying the sunshine and cool breeze when suddenly you are hit in the head by a 20-pound
silver carp. This is a risk now on many rivers and canal systems in Illinois and Missouri because of
the presence of Asian carp. This fish—actually a group of species including the silver, black, grass,
and big head carp—has been farmed and eaten in China for over 1,000 years. It is one of the most
important aquaculture food resources worldwide. In the United States, however, Asian carp is considered
a dangerous invasive species that disrupts ecological community structure to the point of threatening
native species. The effects of invasive species (such as the Asian carp, kudzu vine, predatory snakehead
fish, and zebra mussel) are just one aspect of what ecologists study to understand how populations
interact within ecological communities, and what impact natural and human-induced disturbances have
on the characteristics of communities.
Populations are dynamic entities. Their size and composition fluctuate in response to numerous factors,
including seasonal and yearly changes in the environment, natural disasters such as forest fires and
volcanic eruptions, and competition for resources between and within species. The study of populations
is called demography.

Population Size and Density
Populations are characterized by their
population size (total number of individuals) and
their population density (number of individuals
per unit area). A population may have a large
number of individuals that are distributed
densely, or sparsely. There are also populations
with small numbers of individuals that may be
dense or very sparsely distributed in a local area.
Population size can affect potential for adaptation
because it affects the amount of genetic variation
present in the population. Density can have
effects on interactions within a population such as
competition for food and the ability of individuals
to find a mate. Smaller organisms tend to be more
densely distributed than larger organisms
(Figure 1).

Figure 1. Australian mammals show a typical inverse
relationship between population density and body size. As
this graph shows, population density typically decreases
with increasing body size. Why do you think this is the
case?

103

104 Matthew R. Fisher, Editor

Estimating Population Size
The most accurate way to determine population size is to count all of the individuals within the area.
However, this method is usually not logistically or economically feasible, especially when studying large
areas. Thus, scientists usually study populations by sampling a representative portion of each habitat
and use this sample to make inferences about the population as a whole. The methods used to sample
populations to determine their size and density are typically tailored to the characteristics of the organism
being studied. For immobile organisms such as plants, or for very small and slow-moving organisms, a
quadrat may be used. A quadrat is a square structure that is randomly located on the ground and used
to count the number of individuals that lie within its boundaries. To obtain an accurate count using this
method, the square must be placed at random locations within the habitat enough times to produce an
accurate estimate.
For smaller mobile organisms, such as mammals, a technique called mark and recapture is often
used. This method involves marking captured animals in and releasing them back into the environment
to mix with the rest of the population. Later, a new sample is captured and scientists determine how
many of the marked animals are in the new sample. This method assumes that the larger the population,
the lower the percentage of marked organisms that will be recaptured since they will have mixed with
more unmarked individuals. For example, if 80 field mice are captured, marked, and released into the
forest, then a second trapping 100 field mice are captured and 20 of them are marked, the population
size (N) can be determined using the following equation:
N = (number marked first catch x total number of second catch)/number marked second catch

Using our example, the equation would be:
(80 x 100)/20 = 400

These results give us an estimate of 400 total individuals in the original population. The true number
usually will be a bit different from this because of chance errors and possible bias caused by the sampling
methods.
Species Distribution
In addition to measuring size and density, further information about a population can be obtained by
looking at the distribution of the individuals throughout their range. A species distribution pattern is the
distribution of individuals within a habitat at a particular point in time—broad categories of patterns are
used to describe them.
Individuals within a population can be distributed at random, in groups, or equally spaced apart
(more or less). These are known as random, clumped, and uniform distribution patterns, respectively
(Figure 2). Different distributions reflect important aspects of the biology of the species. They also affect
the mathematical methods required to estimate population sizes. An example of random distribution
occurs with dandelion and other plants that have wind-dispersed seeds that germinate wherever they
happen to fall in favorable environments. A clumped distribution, may be seen in plants that drop their
seeds straight to the ground, such as oak trees; it can also be seen in animals that live in social groups
(schools of fish or herds of elephants). Uniform distribution is observed in plants that secrete substances
inhibiting the growth of nearby individuals (such as the release of toxic chemicals by sage plants). It

Environmental Biology 105

is also seen in territorial animal species, such as penguins that maintain a defined territory for nesting.
The territorial defensive behaviors of each individual create a regular pattern of distribution of similarsized territories and individuals within those territories. Thus, the distribution of the individuals within a
population provides more information about how they interact with each other than does a simple density
measurement. Just as lower density species might have more difficulty finding a mate, solitary species
with a random distribution might have a similar difficulty when compared to social species clumped
together in groups.

Figure 2. Species may have a random, clumped, or uniform distribution. Plants such as (a) dandelions with
wind-dispersed seeds tend to be randomly distributed. Animals such as (b) elephants that travel in groups exhibit a
clumped distribution. Territorial birds such as (c) penguins tend to have a uniform distribution. (credit a: modification

Life tables provide important information about the life history of an organism and the life expectancy
of individuals at each age. They are modeled after actuarial tables used by the insurance industry for
estimating human life expectancy. Life tables may include the probability of each age group dying
before their next birthday, the percentage of surviving individuals dying at a particular age interval (their
mortality rate, and their life expectancy at each interval. An example of a life table is shown in Table 1
from a study of Dall mountain sheep, a species native to northwestern North America. Notice that the
population is divided into age intervals (column A).
As can be seen from the mortality rate data (column D), a high death rate occurred when the sheep
were between six months and a year old, and then increased even more from 8 to 12 years old, after
which there were few survivors. The data indicate that if a sheep in this population were to survive to age
one, it could be expected to live another 7.7 years on average, as shown by the life-expectancy numbers
in column E.

Another tool used by population ecologists is a
survivorship curve, which is a graph of the
number of individuals surviving at each age
interval versus time. These curves allow us to
compare the life histories of different populations
(Figure 3). There are three types of survivorship
curves. In a type I curve, mortality is low in the
early and middle years and occurs mostly in older
individuals. Organisms exhibiting a type I
survivorship typically produce few offspring and
provide good care to the offspring increasing the
likelihood of their survival. Humans and most
mammals exhibit a type I survivorship curve. In
type II curves, mortality is relatively constant
throughout the entire life span, and mortality is
equally likely to occur at any point in the life
span. Many bird populations provide examples of Figure 3. Survivorship curves show the distribution of
individuals in a population according to age. Humans and

4.2 Population Growth and Regulation

Population ecologists make use of a variety of methods to model population dynamics. An accurate
model should be able to describe the changes occurring in a population and predict future changes.

Population Growth
The two simplest models of population growth use deterministic equations (equations that do not
account for random events) to describe the rate of change in the size of a population over time. The
first of these models, exponential growth, describes populations that increase in numbers without any
limits to their growth. The second model, logistic growth, introduces limits to reproductive growth
that become more intense as the population size increases. Neither model adequately describes natural
populations, but they provide points of comparison.
Exponential Growth
Charles Darwin, in developing his theory of natural selection, was influenced by the English clergyman
Thomas Malthus. Malthus published his book in 1798 stating that populations with abundant natural
resources grow very rapidly. However, they limit further growth by depleting their resources. The early
pattern of accelerating population size is called exponential growth (Figure 1).
The best example of exponential growth in organisms is seen in bacteria. Bacteria are prokaryotes that
reproduce quickly, about an hour for many species. If 1000 bacteria are placed in a large flask with an
abundant supply of nutrients (so the nutrients will not become quickly depleted), the number of bacteria
will have doubled from 1000 to 2000 after just an hour. In another hour, each of the 2000 bacteria will
divide, producing 4000 bacteria. After the third hour, there should be 8000 bacteria in the flask. The
important concept of exponential growth is that the growth rate—the number of organisms added in each
reproductive generation—is itself increasing; that is, the population size is increasing at a greater and
greater rate. After 24 of these cycles, the population would have increased from 1000 to more than 16
billion bacteria. When the population size, N, is plotted over time, a J-shaped growth curve is produced
(Figure 1).
The bacteria-in-a-flask example is not truly representative of the real world where resources are
usually limited. However, when a species is introduced into a new habitat that it finds suitable, it may
show exponential growth for a while. In the case of the bacteria in the flask, some bacteria will die
during the experiment and thus not reproduce; therefore, the growth rate is lowered from a maximal rate
in which there is no mortality.
Logistic Growth
Extended exponential growth is possible only when infinite natural resources are available; this is not
the case in the real world. Charles Darwin recognized this fact in his description of the “struggle for
existence,” which states that individuals will compete, with members of their own or other species, for
109

limited resources. The successful ones are more likely to survive and pass on the traits that made them
successful to the next generation at a greater rate (natural selection). To model the reality of limited
resources, population ecologists developed the logistic growth model.
Carrying Capacity and the Logistic Model

In the real world, with its limited resources,
exponential growth cannot continue indefinitely.
Exponential growth may occur in environments
where there are few individuals and plentiful
resources, but when the number of individuals
gets large enough, resources will be depleted and
the growth rate will slow down. Eventually, the
growth rate will plateau or level off (Figure 1).
This population size, which is determined by the
maximum population size that a particular Figure 1. When resources are unlimited, populations

back to the carrying capacity or below it. Most
populations usually fluctuate around the carrying
capacity in an undulating fashion rather than existing right at it.
A graph of logistic growth yields the S-shaped curve (Figure 1). It is a more realistic model of
population growth than exponential growth. There are three different sections to an S-shaped curve.
Initially, growth is exponential because there are few individuals and ample resources available. Then,
as resources begin to become limited, the growth rate decreases. Finally, the growth rate levels off at the
carrying capacity of the environment, with little change in population number over time.
Examples of Logistic Growth

Yeast, a unicellular fungus used to make bread and alcoholic beverages, exhibits the classical S-shaped
curve when grown in a test tube (Figure 2a). Its growth levels off as the population depletes the
nutrients that are necessary for its growth. In the real world, however, there are variations to this
idealized curve. Examples in wild populations include sheep and harbor seals (Figure 2b). In both
examples, the population size exceeds the carrying capacity for short periods of time and then falls
below the carrying capacity afterwards. This fluctuation in population size continues to occur as the
population oscillates around its carrying capacity. Still, even with this oscillation the logistic model is
confirmed.

growth curve, whereas (b) a natural population of seals shows real-world fluctuation. The

scale-bar data from Matt Russell)
Population Dynamics and Regulation

The logistic model of population growth, while valid in many natural populations and a useful model,
is a simplification of real-world population dynamics. Implicit in the model is that the carrying capacity
of the environment does not change, which is not the case. The carrying capacity varies annually.
For example, some summers are hot and dry whereas others are cold and wet; in many areas, the
carrying capacity during the winter is much lower than it is during the summer. Also, natural events
such as earthquakes, volcanoes, and fires can alter an environment and hence its carrying capacity.
Additionally, populations do not usually exist in isolation. They share the environment with other
species, competing with them for the same resources (interspecific competition). These factors are also
important to understanding how a specific population will grow.

Most populations of woolly mammoths went extinct about 10,000 years ago, soon after paleontologists
believe humans began to colonize North America and northern Eurasia (Figure 3). A mammoth
population survived on Wrangel Island, in the East Siberian Sea, and was isolated from human contact
until as recently as 1700 BC. We know a lot about these animals from carcasses found frozen in the ice
of Siberia and other northern regions.
It is commonly thought that climate change and human hunting led to their extinction. A 2008 study
estimated that climate change reduced the mammoth’s range from 3,000,000 square miles 42,000 years
ago to 310,000 square miles 6,000 years ago.2 Through archaeological evidence of kill sites, it is also
well documented that humans hunted these animals. A 2012 study concluded that no single factor was
exclusively responsible for the extinction of these magnificent creatures.3 In addition to climate change
and reduction of habitat, scientists demonstrated another important factor in the mammoth’s extinction
was the migration of human hunters across the Bering Strait to North America during the last ice age
20,000 years ago.
The maintenance of stable populations was and is very complex, with many interacting factors
determining the outcome. It is important to remember that humans are also part of nature. Once we

Demographic-Based Population Models
Population ecologists have hypothesized that suites of characteristics may evolve in species that lead
to particular adaptations to their environments. These adaptations impact the kind of population growth
their species experience. Life history characteristics such as birth rates, age at first reproduction,
the numbers of offspring, and even death rates evolve just like anatomy or behavior, leading to
adaptations that affect population growth. Population ecologists have described a continuum of lifehistory “strategies” with K-selected species on one end and r-selected species on the other. K-selected
species are adapted to stable, predictable environments. Populations of K-selected species tend to exist
close to their carrying capacity. These species tend to have larger, but fewer, offspring and contribute
large amounts of resources to each offspring. Elephants would be an example of a K-selected species.
r-selected species are adapted to unstable and unpredictable environments. They have large numbers
of small offspring. Animals that are r-selected do not provide a lot of resources or parental care to
offspring, and the offspring are relatively self-sufficient at birth. Examples of r-selected species are
marine invertebrates such as jellyfish and plants such as the dandelion. The two extreme strategies are at
two ends of a continuum on which real species life histories will exist. In addition, life history strategies
do not need to evolve as suites, but can evolve independently of each other, so each species may have
some characteristics that trend toward one extreme or the other.

4.3 The Human Population

Concepts of animal population dynamics can
be applied to human population growth. Humans
are not unique in their ability to alter their
environment. For example, beaver dams alter the
stream environment where they are built.
Humans, however, have the ability to alter their
environment to increase its carrying capacity,
sometimes to the detriment of other species.
Earth’s human population and their use of
resources are growing rapidly, to the extent that
some worry about the ability of Earth’s
environment to sustain its human population.
Long-term exponential growth carries with it the
potential risks of famine, disease, and large-scale
death, as well as social consequences of crowding Figure 1. Human population growth since 1000 AD is
exponential.
such as increased crime.
Human technology and particularly our
harnessing of the energy contained in fossil fuels have caused unprecedented changes to Earth’s
environment, altering ecosystems to the point where some may be in danger of collapse. Changes on a
global scale including depletion of the ozone layer, desertification and topsoil loss, and global climate
change are caused by human activities.

Human population Growth
The fundamental cause of the acceleration of
growth rate for humans in the past 200 years has
been the reduced death rate due to changes in
public health and sanitation. Clean drinking water
and proper disposal sewage has drastically
improved health in developed nations. Also,
medical innovations such as the use of antibiotics
and vaccines have decreased the ability of
infectious disease to limit human population
growth. In the past, diseases such as the bubonic
plaque of the fourteenth century killed between

as one hundred million people. Naturally,
infectious disease continues to have an impact on
human population growth, especially in poorer nations. For example, life expectancy in sub-Saharan
115

116 Matthew R. Fisher, Editor

Africa, which was increasing from 1950 to 1990, began to decline after 1985 largely as a result of HIV/
AIDS mortality. The reduction in life expectancy caused by HIV/AIDS was estimated to be 7 years for
2005.
Technological advances of the industrial age have also supported
population growth through urbanization and advances in agriculture.
These advances in technology were possible, in part, due to the
exploitation of fossil fuels.

of economic development in a region. Countries with rapid growth have a
pyramidal shape in their age structure diagrams, showing a preponderance of younger individuals, many
of whom are of reproductive age (Figure 3). This pattern is most often observed in underdeveloped
countries where individuals do not live to old age because of less-than-optimal living conditions, and
there is a high birth rate. Age structures of areas with slow growth, including developed countries such
as the United States, still have a pyramidal structure, but with many fewer young and reproductive-aged
individuals and a greater proportion of older individuals. Other developed countries, such as Italy, have
zero population growth. The age structure of these populations is more conical, with an even greater
percentage of middle-aged and older individuals. The actual growth rates in different countries are
shown in Figure 4, with the highest rates tending to be in the less economically developed countries of
Africa and Asia.

Figure 3. Typical age structure diagrams are shown. The rapid growth diagram narrows to a point, indicating that
the number of individuals decreases rapidly with age. In the slow growth model, the number of individuals
decreases steadily with age. Stable population diagrams are rounded on the top, showing that the number of
individuals per age group decreases gradually, and then increases for the older part of the population.

Environmental Biology 117

Figure 4. The percent growth rate of population in different countries is shown. Notice that the highest growth is
occurring in less economically developed countries in Africa and Asia.

Long-Term Consequences of Exponential Human Population Growth
Many dire predictions have been made about the world’s population leading to a major crisis called the
“population explosion.” In the 1968 book The Population Bomb, biologist Paul R. Ehrlich wrote,
“The battle to feed all of humanity is over. In the 1970s hundreds of millions of people will starve to death in
spite of any crash programs embarked upon now. At this late date nothing can prevent a substantial increase in
the world death rate.”

While these predictions obviously didn’t bear fruit, the laws of exponential population growth are still
in effect, and unchecked human population growth cannot continue indefinitely. Efforts to moderate
population control led to the one-child policy in China, which imposes fines on urban couples who
have more than one child. Due to the fact that some couples wish to have a male heir, many Chinese
couples continue to have more than one child. The effectiveness of the policy in limiting overall
population growth is controversial, as is the policy itself. Moreover, there are stories of female
infanticide having occurred in some of the more rural areas of the country. Family planning education
programs in other countries have had highly positive effects on limiting population growth rates and
increasing standards of living.

118 Matthew R. Fisher, Editor

In spite of population control policies, the human population continues
to grow. The United Nations estimates the future world population size to
be 11.2 billion people by the year 2100. There is no way to know whether
human population growth will moderate to the point where the crisis
described by Dr. Ehrlich will be averted. Another consequence of
population growth is the change and degradation of the natural
environment. Many countries have attempted to reduce the human impact
on climate change by limiting their emission of greenhouse gases.
However, a global climate change treaty remains elusive, and many

States, despite the overwhelming scientific evidence. Thus, we enter the
future with considerable uncertainty about our ability to curb human population growth and protect our
environment to maintain the carrying capacity for the human species.

4.4 Community Ecology

Populations typically do not live in isolation from other species. Populations that interact within a
given habitat form a community. The number of species occupying the same habitat and their relative
abundance is known as the diversity of the community. Areas with low species diversity, such as the
glaciers of Antarctica, still contain a wide variety of living organisms, whereas the diversity of tropical
rainforests is so great that it cannot be accurately assessed. Scientists study ecology at the community
level to understand how species interact with each other and compete for the same resources.
Predation and Herbivory
Perhaps the classical example of species
interaction is the predator-prey relationship. The
narrowest definition of predation describes
individuals of one population that kill and then
consume the individuals of another population.
Population sizes of predators and prey in a
community are not constant over time, and they
may vary in cycles that appear to be related. The
most often cited example of predator-prey
population dynamics is seen in the cycling of the
Figure 1. The cycling of snowshoe hare and lynx

using 100 years of trapping data from North predator-prey dynamics.
America (Figure 1). This cycling of predator and
prey population sizes has a period of approximately ten years, with the predator population lagging one
to two years behind the prey population. An apparent explanation for this pattern is that as the hare
numbers increase, there is more food available for the lynx, allowing the lynx population to increase as
well. When the lynx population grows to a threshold level, however, they kill so many hares that hare
numbers begin to decline, followed by a decline in the lynx population because of scarcity of food. When
the lynx population is low, the hare population size begins to increase due, in part, to low predation
pressure, starting the cycle anew.
Defense Mechanisms against Predation and Herbivory

Predation and predator avoidance are strong influenced by natural selection. Any heritable character that
allows an individual of a prey population to better evade its predators will be represented in greater
numbers in later generations. Likewise, traits that allow a predator to more efficiently locate and capture
its prey will lead to a greater number of offspring and an increase in the commonness of the trait within
the population. Such ecological relationships between specific populations lead to adaptations that
are driven by reciprocal evolutionary responses in those populations. Species have evolved numerous
mechanisms to escape predation (including herbivory, the consumption of plants for food). Defenses
may be mechanical, chemical, physical, or behavioral.
119

120 Matthew R. Fisher, Editor

Mechanical defenses, such as the presence of
armor in animals or thorns in plants, discourage
predation and herbivory by discouraging physical
contact (Figure 2a). Many animals produce or
obtain chemical defenses from plants and store
them to prevent predation. Many plant species
produce secondary plant compounds that serve no
function for the plant except that they are toxic to
animals and discourage consumption. For

medication, which has saved lives for many
decades.)
Many species use their body shape and coloration to avoid being detected by predators. The tropical
walking stick is an insect with the coloration and body shape of a twig, which makes it very hard to see
when it is stationary against a background of real twigs (Figure 3a). In another example, the chameleon
can change its color to match its surroundings (Figure 3b).

Figure 3. (a) The tropical walking stick and (b) the chameleon use their body shape and/
or coloration to prevent detection by predators. (credit a: modification of work by Linda
Tanner; credit b: modification of work by Frank Vassen)

Environmental Biology 121

Some species use coloration as a way of warning predators
that they are distasteful or poisonous. For example, the
monarch butterfly caterpillar sequesters poisons from its food
(plants and milkweeds) to make itself poisonous or distasteful
to potential predators. The caterpillar is bright yellow and
black to advertise its toxicity. The caterpillar is also able to
pass the sequestered toxins on to the adult monarch, which is
also dramatically colored black and red as a warning to
potential predators. Fire-bellied toads produce toxins that
make them distasteful to their potential predators (Figure 4).
They have bright red or orange coloration on their bellies, Figure 4. The fire-bellied toad has bright

and can learn—a naïve predator must experience the negative
consequences of eating one before it will avoid other similarly colored individuals.
While some predators learn to avoid eating
certain potential prey because of their coloration,
other species have evolved mechanisms to mimic
this coloration to avoid being eaten, even though
they themselves may not be unpleasant to eat or
contain toxic chemicals. In some cases of
mimicry, a harmless species imitates the warning
coloration of a harmful species. Assuming they
share the same predators, this coloration then

stinging, venomous insects, thereby discouraging
predation (Figure 5).

122 Matthew R. Fisher, Editor

In other cases of mimicry, multiple species share the same warning
coloration, but all of them actually have defenses. The commonness of
the signal improves the compliance of all the potential predators.

coloration.

Competitive Exclusion Principle
Resources are often limited within a habitat and multiple species may compete to obtain them. Ecologists
have come to understand that all species have an ecological niche: the unique set of resources used by
a species, which includes its interactions with other species. The competitive exclusion principle states
that two species cannot occupy the exact same niche in a habitat. In other words, different species cannot
coexist in a community if they are competing for all the same resources. It is important to note that
competition is bad for both competitors because it wastes energy. The competitive exclusion principle
works because if there is competition between two species for the same resources, then natural selection
will favor traits that lessen reliance on the shared resource, thus reducing competition. If either species
is unable to evolve to reduce competition, then the species that most efficiently exploits the resource
will drive the other species to extinction. An experimental example of this principle is shown in Figure 7
with two protozoan species: Paramecium aurelia and Paramecium caudatum. When grown individually
in the laboratory, they both thrive. But when they are placed together in the same test tube (habitat), P.
aurelia outcompetes P. caudatum for food, leading to the latter’s eventual extinction.

Environmental Biology 123

Figure 7. Paramecium aurelia and Paramecium caudatum grow well individually, but when they compete for the same
resources, the P. aurelia outcompetes the P. caudatum.

Symbiosis
Symbiotic relationships are close, long-term interactions between individuals of different species.
Symbioses may be commensal, in which one species benefits while the other is neither harmed nor
benefited; mutualistic, in which both species benefit; or parasitic, in which the interaction harms one
species and benefits the other.
Commensalism occurs when one species benefits from
a close prolonged interaction, while the other neither
benefits or is harmed. Birds nesting in trees provide an
example of a commensal relationship (Figure 8). The tree
is not harmed by the presence of the nest among its
branches. The nests are light and produce little strain on the
structural integrity of the branch, and most of the leaves,
which the tree uses to get energy by photosynthesis, are
above the nest so they are unaffected. The bird, on the other
hand, benefits greatly. If the bird had to nest in the open, its
eggs and young would be vulnerable to predators. Many
potential commensal relationships are difficult to identify
because it is difficult to prove that one partner does not
derive some benefit from the presence of the other.
A second type of symbiotic relationship is called

cellulose only because of the presence of symbiotic bacteria

termite itself cannot do this; without the protozoa, it would not be able to obtain energy from its food
(cellulose from the wood it chews and eats). The protozoa benefit by having a protective environment
and a constant supply of food from the wood chewing actions of the termite. In turn, the protists benefit

124 Matthew R. Fisher, Editor

from the enzymes provided by their bacterial endosymbionts, while the bacteria benefit from a doubly
protective environment and a constant source of nutrients from two hosts. Lichen are a mutualistic
relationship between a fungus and photosynthetic algae or cyanobacteria (Figure 9b). The glucose
produced by the algae provides nourishment for both organisms, whereas the physical structure of the
lichen protects the algae from the elements and makes certain nutrients in the atmosphere more available
to the algae. The algae of lichens can live independently given the right environment, but many of the
fungal partners are unable to live on their own.
A parasite is an organism that feeds off another
without immediately killing the organism it is
feeding on. In parasitism,the parasite benefits,
but the organism being fed upon, the host, is
harmed. The host is usually weakened by the
parasite as it siphons resources the host would

Characteristics of Communities
Communities are complex systems that can be characterized by their structure (the number and size of
populations and their interactions) and dynamics (how the members and their interactions change over
time). Understanding community structure and dynamics allows us to minimize impacts on ecosystems
and manage ecological communities we benefit from.
Ecologists have extensively studied one of the fundamental characteristics of communities:
biodiversity. One measure of biodiversity used by ecologists is the number of different species in a
particular area and their relative abundance. The area in question could be a habitat, a biome, or the
entire biosphere. Species richness is the term used to describe the number of species living in a habitat
or other unit. Species richness varies across the globe (Figure 11). Species richness is related to latitude:
the greatest species richness occurs near the equator and the lowest richness occurs near the poles.
The exact reasons for this are not clearly understood. Other factors besides latitude influence species
richness as well. For example, ecologists studying islands found that biodiversity varies with island size
and distance from the mainland.

126 Matthew R. Fisher, Editor

Relative abundance is the number individuals
in a species relative to the total number of
individuals in all species within a system.
Foundation species, described below, often have
the highest relative abundance of species.
Foundation species are considered the “base”
or “bedrock” of a community, having the greatest
influence on its overall structure. They are often
primary producers, and they are typically an
abundant organism. For example, kelp, a species
of brown algae, is a foundation species that forms
the basis of the kelp forests off the coast of
California.
Foundation species may physically modify the
environment to produce and maintain habitats
that benefit the other organisms that use them.
Examples include the kelp described above or
tree species found in a forest. The photosynthetic Figure 11. The greatest species richness for mammals in

physically modifying the environment (Figure (credit: modification of work by NASA, CIESIN, Columbia
12). The exoskeletons of living and dead coral University)
make up most of the reef structure, which protects
many other species from waves and ocean currents.
A keystone species is one whose presence has
inordinate influence in maintaining the
prevalence of various species in an ecosystem,
the ecological community’s structure, and
sometimes its biodiversity. Pisaster ochraceus,
the intertidal sea star, is a keystone species in the
northwestern portion of the United States (Figure
13). Studies have shown that when this organism
is removed from communities, mussel
populations (their natural prey) increase, which
completely alters the species composition and
reduces biodiversity. Another keystone species is
the banded tetra, a fish in tropical streams, which
Figure 12. Coral is the foundation species of coral reef
ecosystems. (credit: Jim E. Maragos, USFWS)
supplies nearly all of the phosphorus, a necessary
inorganic nutrient, to the rest of the community.
The banded tetra feeds largely on insects from the terrestrial ecosystem and then excretes phosphorus
into the aquatic ecosystem. The relationships between populations in the community, and possibly the
biodiversity, would change dramatically if these fish were to become extinct.

BIOLOGY IN ACTION

Invasive species are non-native organisms that, when
introduced to an area out of its native range, alter the
community they invade. In the United States, invasive
species like the purple loosestrife (Lythrum salicaria)
and the zebra mussel (Dreissena polymorpha) have
drastically altered the ecosystems they invaded. Some
well-known invasive animals include the emerald ash
borer (Agrilus planipennis) and the European starling
(Sturnus vulgaris). Whether enjoying a forest hike,
taking a summer boat trip, or simply walking down an Figure 13. Sea stars are keystone species of the

species.
One of the many recent proliferations of an invasive species concerns the Asian carp in the United
States. Asian carp were introduced to the United States in the 1970s by fisheries (commercial catfish
ponds) and by sewage treatment facilities that used the fish’s excellent filter feeding abilities to clean
their ponds of excess plankton. Some of the fish escaped, and by the 1980s they had colonized many
waterways of the Mississippi River basin, including the Illinois and Missouri Rivers.
Voracious feeders and rapid reproducers, Asian carp may outcompete native species for food and
could lead to their extinction. One species, the grass carp, feeds on phytoplankton and aquatic plants. It
competes with native species for these resources and alters nursery habitats for other fish by removing
aquatic plants. In some parts of the Illinois River, Asian carp constitute 95 percent of the community’s
biomass. Although edible, the fish is bony and not desired in the United States.
The Great Lakes and their prized salmon and lake trout fisheries are being threatened by Asian carp.
The carp are not yet present in the Great Lakes, and attempts are being made to prevent its access
to the lakes through the Chicago Ship and Sanitary Canal, which is the only connection between the
Mississippi River and Great Lakes basins. To prevent the Asian carp from leaving the canal, a series of
electric barriers have been used to discourage their migration; however, the threat is significant enough
that several states and Canada have sued to have the Chicago channel permanently cut off from Lake
Michigan. Local and national politicians have weighed in on how to solve the problem. In general,
governments have been ineffective in preventing or slowing the introduction of invasive species.
Community Dynamics
Community dynamics are the changes in community structure and composition over time, often
following environmental disturbances such as volcanoes, earthquakes, storms, fires, and climate change.
Communities with a relatively constant number of species are said to be at equilibrium. The equilibrium
is dynamic with species identities and relationships changing over time, but maintaining relatively
constant numbers. Following a disturbance, the community may or may not return to the equilibrium
state.
Succession describes the sequential appearance and disappearance of species in a community over
time after a severe disturbance. In primary succession, newly exposed or newly formed rock is colonized
by living organisms. In secondary succession, a part of an ecosystem is disturbed and remnants of the
previous community remain. In both cases, there is a sequential change in species until a more or less
permanent community develops.

Primary Succession and Pioneer Species

Primary succession occurs when new land is
formed, or when the soil and all life is removed from
pre-existing land. An example of the former is the
eruption of volcanoes on the Big Island of Hawaii,
which results in lava that flows into the ocean and
continually forms new land. From this process,
approximately 32 acres of land are added to the Big
Island each year. An example of pre-existing soil
being removed is through the activity of glaciers. The
massive weight of the glacier scours the landscape
down to the bedrock as the glacier moves. This
removes any original soil and leaves exposed rock
once the glacier melts and retreats.
Figure 14. During primary succession in lava on

that is devoid of life. New soil is slowly formed as species. (credit: Forest and Kim Starr)
weathering and other natural forces break down the
rock and lead to the establishment of hearty organisms, such as lichens and some plants, which are
collectively known as pioneer species (Figure 14) because they are the first to appear. These species
help to further break down the mineral-rich rock into soil where other, less hardy but more competitive
species, such as grasses, shrubs, and trees, will grow and eventually replace the pioneer species. Over
time the area will reach an equilibrium state, with a set of organisms quite different from the pioneer
species.
Secondary succession

A classic example of secondary succession occurs in forests cleared by wildfire, or by clearcut logging
(Figure 15). Wildfires will burn most vegetation, and unless the animals can flee the area, they are killed.
Their nutrients, however, are returned to the ground in the form of ash. Thus, although the community
has been dramatically altered, there is a soil ecosystem present that provides a foundation for rapid
recolonization.
Before the fire, the vegetation was dominated by tall trees with access to the major plant energy
resource: sunlight. Their height gave them access to sunlight while also shading the ground and other
low-lying species. After the fire, though, these trees are no longer dominant. Thus, the first plants to
grow back are usually annual plants followed within a few years by quickly growing and spreading
grasses and other pioneer species. Due, at least in part, to changes in the environment brought on
by the growth of grasses and forbs, over many years, shrubs emerge along with small trees. These
organisms are called intermediate species. Eventually, over 150 years or more, the forest will reach its
equilibrium point and resemble the community before the fire. This equilibrium state is referred to as the
climax community, which will remain until the next disturbance. The climax community is typically
characteristic of a given climate and geology. Although the community in equilibrium looks the same
once it is attained, the equilibrium is a dynamic one with constant changes in abundance and sometimes
species identities.

Summary
Populations are individuals of a species that live in a particular habitat. Ecologists measure
characteristics of populations: size, density, and distribution pattern. Life tables are useful to calculate
life expectancies of individual population members. Survivorship curves show the number of individuals
surviving at each age interval plotted versus time. Populations with unlimited resources grow
exponentially—with an accelerating growth rate. When resources become limiting, populations follow
a logistic growth curve in which population size will level off at the carrying capacity. Humans
have increased their carrying capacity through technology, urbanization, and harnessing the energy of
fossil fuels. Unchecked human population growth could have dire long-term effects on human welfare
and Earth’s ecosystems. Communities include all the different species living in a given area. The
variety of these species is referred to as biodiversity. Species may form symbiotic relationships such
as commensalism, mutualism, or parasitism. Community structure is described by its foundation and
keystone species. Communities respond to environmental disturbances by succession: the predictable
appearance of different types of plant species, until a stable community structure is established.

5.1 Introduction to Biodiversity

Earth is home to an impressive array of life forms. From single-celled organisms to creatures made
of many trillions of cells, life has taken on many wonderful shapes and evolved countless strategies
for survival. Recall that cell theory dictates that all living things are made of one or more cells. Some
organisms are made of just a single cell, and are thus referred to as unicellular. Organisms containing
more than one cell are said to be multicellular. Despite the wide range of organisms, there exists only
two fundamental cell plans: prokaryotic and eukaryotic. The main difference these two cell plans is that
eukaryotic cells have internal, membrane-bound structures called organelles (see chp 2.3). Thus, if you
were to microscopically analyze the cells of any organism on Earth, you would find either prokaryotic
or eukaryotic cells depending on the type of organism.
Biologists name, group, and classify organisms based on similarities in genetics and morphology.
This branch of biological science is known as taxonomy. Taxonomists group organisms into categories
that range from very broad to very specific (Figure 1). The broadest category is called domain and
the most specific is species (notice the similarities between the words specific and species). Currently,
taxonomists recognize three domains: Bacteria, Archaea, and Eukarya. All life forms are classified
within these three domains.

137

Domain Bacteria
Domain Bacteria includes prokaryotic, unicellular organisms (Figure 2). They are incredibly abundant
and found in nearly every imaginable type of habitat, including your body. While many people view
bacteria only as disease-causing organisms, most species are actually either benign or beneficial to
humans. While it is true that some bacteria may cause disease in people, this is more the exception than
the rule.
Bacteria are well-known for their metabolic diversity. Metabolism is a general term describing the

Environmental Biology 139

complex biochemistry that occurs inside of cells. Many species of bacteria are autotrophs, meaning they
can create their own food source without having to eat other organisms. Most autotrophic bacteria do this
by using photosynthesis, a process that converts light energy into chemical energy that can be utilized
by cells. A well-known and ecologically-important group of photosynthetic bacteria is cyanobacteria.
These are sometimes referred to a blue-green algae, but this name is not appropriate because, as you will
see shortly, algae are organisms that belong to domain Eukarya. Cyanobacteria play important roles in
food webs of aquatic systems, such as lakes.
Other species of bacteria are heterotrophs, meaning that they need to acquire their food by eating
other organisms. This classification includes the bacteria that cause disease in humans (during an
infection, the bacteria is eating you). However, most heterotrophic bacteria are harmless to humans. In
fact, you have hundreds of species of bacteria living on your skin and in your large intestine that do
you no harm. Beyond your body, heterotrophic bacteria play vital roles in ecosystems, especially soildwelling bacteria that decompose living matter and make nutrients available to plants.

(b) bacilli, or rod-shaped; and (c) spirilla, or spiral-shaped. (credit a: modification of work by Janice
Haney Carr, Dr. Richard Facklam, CDC; credit c: modification of work by Dr. David Cox, CDC; scale-bar

Domain Archaea
Like bacteria, organisms in domain Archaea are prokaryotic and unicellular. Superficially, they look
a lot like bacteria, and many biologists confused them as bacteria until a few decades ago. But hiding
in their genes is a story that modern DNA analysis has recently revealed: archaeans are so different
genetically that they belong in their own domain.
Many archaean species are found in some of the most inhospitable environments, areas of immense
pressure (bottom of the ocean), salinity (such as the Great Salt Lake), or heat (geothermal springs).
Organisms that can tolerate and even thrive in such conditions are known as extremophiles. (It should
be noted that many bacteria are also extremophiles). Along with genetic evidence, the fact that a large
percentage of archaeans are extremophiles suggests that they may be descendants of some of the most
ancient lifeforms on Earth; life that originated on a young planet that was inhospitable by today’s
standards.
For whatever reason, archaeans are not as abundant in and on the human body as bacteria, and they
cause substantially fewer diseases. Research on archaeans continues to shed light on this interesting and
somewhat mysterious domain.

140 Matthew R. Fisher, Editor

Domain Eukarya
This domain is most familiar to use because it includes humans and other animals, along with plants,
fungi, and a lesser-known group, the protists. Unlike the other domains, Domain Eukarya contains
multicellular organisms, in addition to unicellular species. The domain is characterized by the presence
of eukaryotic cells. For this domain, you will be introduced to several of its kingdoms. Kingdom is the
taxonomic grouping immediately below domain (see Figure 1).
Kingdom Animalia is comprised of multicellular, heterotrophic organisms. This kingdom includes
humans and other primates, insects, fish, reptiles, and many other types of animals. Kingdom Plantae
includes multicellular, autotrophic organisms. Except for a few species that are parasites, plants use
photosynthesis to meet their energy demands.
Kingdom Fungi includes multicellular and
unicellular, heterotrophic fungi. Fungi are
commonly mistaken for plants because some
species of fungi grow in the ground. Fungi are
fundamentally different from plants in that they
do not perform photosynthesis and instead feed
on the living matter of others. Another
misconception is that all fungi are mushrooms. A
mushroom is a temporary reproductive structure Figure 3. The (a) familiar mushroom is only one type of
used by some fungal species, but not all. Some fungus. The brightly colored fruiting bodies of this (b)
fungi take the form of molds and mildews, which coral fungus are displayed. This (c) electron micrograph

alcoholic beverages.
Protists refer to a highly disparate group that was formerly its own kingdom until recent genetic
analysis indicated that it should be split in to many kingdoms (Figure 4). As a group, protists are
very diverse and include unicellular, multicellular, heterotrophic, and autotrophic organisms. The term
‘protist’ was used as a catchall for any eukaryote that was neither animal, plant, or fungus. Examples of
protists include macroalgae such as kelps and seaweeds, microalgae such as diatoms and dinoflagellates,
and important disease-causing microbes such as Plasmodium, the parasite that causes malaria. Sadly,
malaria kills hundreds of thousands of people every year.

Environmental Biology 141

With this cursory and fundamental
understanding of biological diversity, you are
now better equipped to study the role of
biodiversity in the biosphere and in human
economics, health, and culture. Each life form,
even the smallest microbe, is a fascinating and
and complex living machine. This complexity
means we will likely never fully understand each
organism and the myriad ways they interact with
each other, with us, and with their environment.
Thus, it is wise to value biodiversity and take
measures to conserve it.

What biological process is responsible for biodiversity?
All species —from the bacteria on our skin to the birds outside—evolved at some point from a
different species. Although it may seem that living things today stay much the same from generation to
generation, that is not the case because evolution is ongoing. Evolution is the process through which the
characteristics of a species change over time, which can ultimately cause new species to arise.
The theory of evolution is the unifying theory of biology, meaning it is the framework within which
biologists ask questions about the living world. Its power is that it provides direction for predictions
about living things that are borne out in experiment after experiment. The Ukrainian-born American
geneticist Theodosius Dobzhansky famously wrote that “nothing makes sense in biology except in the
light of evolution.” He meant that the principle that all life has evolved and diversified from a common
ancestor is the foundation from which we understand all other questions in biology.

Discovering How Populations Change
The theory of evolution by natural selection describes a mechanism for how species can change over
time. That species change was suggested and debated well before Darwin. The view that species were
unchanging was grounded in the writings of Plato, yet there were also ancient Greeks that expressed
evolutionary ideas.
In the eighteenth century, ideas about the evolution of animals were reintroduced by the various
naturalists. At the same time, James Hutton, the Scottish naturalist, proposed that geological change
occurred gradually by the accumulation of small changes from processes (over long periods of time) just
like those happening today. This contrasted with the predominant view that the geology of the planet was
a consequence of catastrophic events occurring during a relatively brief past. Hutton’s view was later
popularized by the geologist Charles Lyell in the nineteenth century. Lyell became a friend to Darwin
and his ideas were very influential on Darwin’s thinking. Lyell argued that the greater age of Earth gave
more time for gradual change in species, and the process provided an analogy for gradual change in
species.
Charles Darwin and Natural Selection
Natural selection as a mechanism for evolution was
independently conceived of and described by two
naturalists, Charles Darwin and Alfred Russell
Wallace, in the mid-nineteenth century. Importantly,
each spent years exploring the natural world on
expeditions to the tropics. From 1831 to 1836, Darwin
traveled around the world on H.M.S. Beagle, visiting
South America, Australia, and the southern tip of
Africa. Wallace traveled to Brazil to collect insects in
the Amazon rainforest from 1848 to 1852 and to the
Malay Archipelago from 1854 to 1862. Darwin’s
journey, like Wallace’s later journeys in the Malay
Archipelago, included stops at several island chains,
the last being the Galápagos Islands (west of Ecuador).
On these islands, Darwin observed species of
organisms on different islands that were clearly Figure 2. Darwin observed that beak shape varies
among finch species. He postulated that the beak of
similar, yet had distinct differences. For example, the an ancestral species had adapted over time to equip
ground finches inhabiting the Galápagos Islands the finches to acquire different food sources. This
comprised several species that each had a unique beak illustration shows the beak shapes for four species of
shape (Figure 2). He observed both that these finches ground finch: 1. Geospiza magnirostris (the large
closely resembled another finch species on the ground finch), 2. G. fortis (the medium ground finch),
mainland of South America and that the group of 3. G. parvula (the small tree finch), and 4. Certhidea
species in the Galápagos formed a graded series of olivacea (the green-warbler finch).
beak sizes and shapes, with very small differences
between the most similar. Darwin imagined that the island species might be all species modified from
one original mainland species. In 1860, he wrote, “Seeing this gradation and diversity of structure in one
small, intimately related group of birds, one might really fancy that from an original paucity of birds in
this archipelago, one species had been taken and modified for different ends.”

Environmental Biology 145

Wallace and Darwin both observed similar patterns in other organisms and independently conceived
a mechanism to explain how and why such changes could take place. Darwin called this mechanism
natural selection. Natural selection, Darwin argued, was an inevitable outcome of three principles that
operated in nature. First, there exists variation in traits among individuals within a population, and
these traits are inherited, or passed from parent to offspring. Second, more offspring are produced than
are able to survive; in other words, resources for survival and reproduction are limited. And lastly,
there is a competition for those resources in each generation. Out of these three principles, Darwin
and Wallace reasoned that offspring with inherited characteristics that allow them to best compete for
limited resources will survive and have more offspring than those individuals with variations that are
less able to compete. Because characteristics are inherited, these traits will be better represented in the
next generation. This will lead to change in populations over generations in a process that Darwin called
“descent with modification.” In sum, we can define natural selection as a process the causes beneficial
traits to become more common in a population over time, causing the population to evolve.
Papers by Darwin and Wallace (Figure 3)
presenting the idea of natural selection were read
together in 1858 before the Linnaean Society in
London. The following year Darwin’s book, On
the Origin of Species, was published, which
outlined in considerable detail his arguments for
evolution by natural selection.
Natural selection can only take place if there
is variation, or differences, among individuals in
a population. Importantly, these differences must
have some genetic basis, otherwise natural

transmit those traits from one generation to the
next.
Genetic diversity in a population comes from two main sources: mutation and sexual reproduction.
Mutation, a permanent change in DNA sequence is the ultimate source of new genetic variation in any
population. An individual that has a mutated gene might have a different trait than other individuals
in the population. Without variation in traits, nature would not be able to select the traits that are best
adapted for the organisms’ environment at that particular time.
Evolutionary change in action
The development of antibiotic resistant bacteria is an example of evolution through natural selection
and it has been directly observed by scientists. How does this happen? Imagine a person that has a
bacterial infection: their body is being attacked by billions of bacteria. Because there is genetic variation
in populations, some individual bacteria may already possess traits that allow them to tolerate antibiotic
drugs. When the infected person is prescribed antibiotics, the drug attacks and kills the entire population,
except for those bacteria that can resist the drug. These bacteria survive because they had a trait that was
beneficial and thus nature selected for it. The surviving population will all be resistant to the drug and
continue to reproduce, multiple, and pass down that beneficial trait to all offspring. The population has
now evolved because all individuals have the antibiotic-resistant trait, whereas before it was rare. It is
important to realize that evolution occurs at the population level and is reliant upon genetic variation

146 Matthew R. Fisher, Editor

that was already present. Without that variation, there is nothing for nature to select for. The rise and
spread of antibiotic resistant bacteria is an emerging environmental issue and will be discussed in a later
chapter.

5.3 Importance of Biodiversity

The Biodiversity Crisis
Biologists estimate that species extinctions are currently 500–1000 times the normal, or background,
rate seen previously in Earth’s history. The current high rates will cause a precipitous decline in the
biodiversity of the planet in the next century or two. The loss of biodiversity will include many species
we know today. Although it is sometimes difficult to predict which species will become extinct, many
are listed as endangered (at great risk of extinction). However, many extinctions will affect species that
biologist have not yet discovered. Most of these “invisible” species that will become extinct currently
live in tropical rainforests like those of the Amazon basin. These rainforests are the most diverse
ecosystems on the planet and are being destroyed rapidly by deforestation. Between 1970 and 2011,
almost 20 percent of the Amazon rainforest was lost.
Biodiversity is a broad term for biological
variety, and it can be measured at a number of
organizational levels. Traditionally, ecologists
have measured biodiversity by taking into
account both the number of species and the
number of individuals of each species (known as
relative abundance). However, biologists are
using different measures of biodiversity,
including genetic diversity, to help focus efforts
to preserve the biologically and technologically
important elements of biodiversity.
Biodiversity loss refers to the reduction of
biodiversity due to displacement or extinction of
species. The loss of a particular individual

especially if it is not a charismatic species like the particular location is protected within a national forest, yet

lifetimes. Much of this loss is occurring in
tropical rainforests like the one pictured in Figure 1, which are very high in biodiversity but are being
cleared for timber and agriculture. This is likely to have dramatic effects on human welfare through the
collapse of ecosystems.
Biologists recognize that human populations are embedded in ecosystems and are dependent on them,
just as is every other species on the planet. Agriculture began after early hunter-gatherer societies first
settled in one place and heavily modified their immediate environment. This cultural transition has made
it difficult for humans to recognize their dependence on living things other than crops and domesticated
animals on the planet. Today our technology smooths out the harshness of existence and allows many
of us to live longer, more comfortable lives, but ultimately the human species cannot exist without its
147

148 Matthew R. Fisher, Editor

surrounding ecosystems. Our ecosystems provide us with food, medicine, clean air and water, recreation,
and spiritual and aesthetical inspiration.

Types of Biodiversity
A common meaning of biodiversity is simply the number of species in a location or on Earth; for
example, the American Ornithologists’ Union lists 2078 species of birds in North and Central America.
This is one measure of the bird biodiversity on the continent. More sophisticated measures of diversity
take into account the relative abundances of species. For example, a forest with 10 equally common
species of trees is more diverse than a forest that has 10 species of trees wherein just one of those species
makes up 95 percent of the trees. Biologists have also identified alternate measures of biodiversity, some
of which are important in planning how to preserve biodiversity.
Genetic diversity is one alternate concept of biodiversity. Genetic diversity is the raw material
for evolutionary adaptation in a species and is represented by the variety of genes present within a
population. A species’ potential to adapt to changing environments or new diseases depends on this
genetic diversity.
It is also useful to define ecosystem diversity: the number of different ecosystems on Earth or in
a geographical area. The loss of an ecosystem means the loss of the interactions between species and
the loss of biological productivity that an ecosystem is able to create. An example of a largely extinct
ecosystem in North America is the prairie ecosystem (Figure 2). Prairies once spanned central North
America from the boreal forest in northern Canada down into Mexico. They are now all but gone,
replaced by crop fields, pasture lands, and suburban sprawl. Many of the species survive, but the hugely
productive ecosystem that was responsible for creating our most productive agricultural soils is now
gone. As a consequence, their soils are now being depleted unless they are maintained artificially at great
expense. The decline in soil productivity occurs because the interactions in the original ecosystem have
been lost.

Despite considerable effort, knowledge of the species that inhabit the planet is limited. A recent estimate

Environmental Biology 149

suggests that only 13% of eukaryotic species have been named (Table 1). Estimates of numbers of
prokaryotic species are largely guesses, but biologists agree that science has only just begun to catalog
their diversity. . Given that Earth is losing species at an accelerating pace, science knows little about
what is being lost.
Table 1. This table shows the estimated number of species by taxonomic group—including both described
(named and studied) and predicted (yet to be named) species.

There are various initiatives to catalog described species in accessible and more organized ways,
and the internet is facilitating that effort. Nevertheless, at the current rate of species description, which
according to the State of Observed Species1 reports is 17,000–20,000 new species a year, it would take
close to 500 years to describe all of the species currently in existence. The task, however, is becoming
increasingly impossible over time as extinction removes species from Earth faster than they can be
described.
Naming and counting species may seem an unimportant pursuit given the other needs of humanity, but
it is not simply an accounting. Describing species is a complex process by which biologists determine
an organism’s unique characteristics and whether or not that organism belongs to any other described
species. It allows biologists to find and recognize the species after the initial discovery to follow up on
questions about its biology. That subsequent research will produce the discoveries that make the species
valuable to humans and to our ecosystems. Without a name and description, a species cannot be studied
in depth and in a coordinated way by multiple scientists.

Patterns of Biodiversity
Biodiversity is not evenly distributed on the planet. Lake Victoria contained almost 500 species of
cichlids (just one family of fishes that are present in the lake) before the introduction of an exotic species
in the 1980s and 1990s caused a mass extinction. All of these species were found only in Lake Victoria,
which is to say they were endemic. Endemic species are found in only one location. For example, the
blue jay is endemic to North America, while the Barton Springs salamander is endemic to the mouth of

150 Matthew R. Fisher, Editor

one spring in Austin, Texas. Endemic species with highly restricted distributions, like the Barton Springs
salamander, are particularly vulnerable to extinction.
Lake Huron contains about 79 species of fish, all of which are found in many other lakes in North
America. What accounts for the difference in diversity between Lake Victoria and Lake Huron? Lake
Victoria is a tropical lake, while Lake Huron is a temperate lake. Lake Huron in its present form is
only about 7,000 years old, while Lake Victoria in its present form is about 15,000 years old. These
two factors, latitude and age, are two of several hypotheses biogeographers have suggested to explain
biodiversity patterns on Earth.

Biogeography is the study of the distribution of the world’s species both in the past
and in the present. The work of biogeographers is critical to understanding our physical
environment, how the environment affects species, and how changes in environment
impact the distribution of a species.
There are three main fields of study under the heading of biogeography: ecological biogeography,
historical biogeography (called paleobiogeography), and conservation biogeography. Ecological
biogeography studies the current factors affecting the distribution of plants and animals. Historical
biogeography, as the name implies, studies the past distribution of species. Conservation biogeography,
on the other hand, is focused on the protection and restoration of species based upon the known historical
and current ecological information.
One of the oldest observed patterns in ecology
is that biodiversity typically increases as latitude
declines. In other words, biodiversity increases
closer to the equator (Figure 3).
It is not yet clear why biodiversity increases
closer to the equator, but hypotheses include the
greater age of the ecosystems in the tropics versus
temperate regions, which were largely devoid of
life or drastically impoverished during the last ice
age. The greater age provides more time for
speciation, the evolutionary process of creating

greater energy input could translate into more
species. The complexity of tropical ecosystems may promote speciation by increasing the habitat
complexity, thus providing more ecological niches. Lastly, the tropics have been perceived as being
more stable than temperate regions, which have a pronounced climate and day-length seasonality. The
stability of tropical ecosystems might promote speciation. Regardless of the mechanisms, it is certainly
true that biodiversity is greatest in the tropics. There are also high numbers of endemic species.

Importance of Biodiversity
Loss of biodiversity may have reverberating consequences on ecosystems because of the complex
interrelations among species. For example, the extinction of one species may cause the extinction of
another. Biodiversity is important to the survival and welfare of human populations because it has

Environmental Biology 151

impacts on our health and our ability to feed ourselves through agriculture and harvesting populations of
wild animals.
Human Health
Many medications are derived from natural chemicals made by a diverse group of organisms. For
example, many plants produce compounds meant to protect the plant from insects and other animals that
eat them. Some of these compounds also work as human medicines. Contemporary societies that live
close to the land often have a broad knowledge of the medicinal uses of plants growing in their area. For
centuries in Europe, older knowledge about the medical uses of plants was compiled in herbals—books
that identified the plants and their uses. Humans are not the only animals to use plants for medicinal
reasons. The other great apes, orangutans, chimpanzees, bonobos, and gorillas have all been observed
self-medicating with plants.
Modern pharmaceutical science also recognizes the importance of these plant compounds. Examples
of significant medicines derived from plant compounds include aspirin, codeine, digoxin, atropine, and
vincristine (Figure 4). Many medications were once derived from plant extracts but are now synthesized.
It is estimated that, at one time, 25 percent of modern drugs contained at least one plant extract. That
number has probably decreased to about 10 percent as natural plant ingredients are replaced by synthetic
versions of the plant compounds. Antibiotics, which are responsible for extraordinary improvements in
health and lifespans in developed countries, are compounds largely derived from fungi and bacteria.
In recent years, animal venoms and poisons have
excited intense research for their medicinal potential. By
2007, the FDA had approved five drugs based on animal
toxins to treat diseases such as hypertension, chronic
pain, and diabetes. Another five drugs are undergoing
clinical trials and at least six drugs are being used in other
countries. Other toxins under investigation come from
mammals, snakes, lizards, various amphibians, fish,
snails, octopuses, and scorpions.

1981 and 2002 were from natural compounds.
Finally, it has been argued that humans benefit psychologically from living in a biodiverse world. The
chief proponent of this idea is famed entomologist E. O. Wilson. He argues that human evolutionary
history has adapted us to living in a natural environment and that built environments generate stresses
that affect human health and well-being. There is considerable research into the psychologically
regenerative benefits of natural landscapes that suggest the hypothesis may hold some truth.
Agricultural
Since the beginning of human agriculture more than 10,000 years ago, human groups have been breeding

152 Matthew R. Fisher, Editor

and selecting crop varieties. This crop diversity matched the cultural diversity of highly subdivided
populations of humans. For example, potatoes were domesticated beginning around 7,000 years ago in
the central Andes of Peru and Bolivia. The people in this region traditionally lived in relatively isolated
settlements separated by mountains. The potatoes grown in that region belong to seven species and
the number of varieties likely is in the thousands. Each variety has been bred to thrive at particular
elevations and soil and climate conditions. The diversity is driven by the diverse demands of the
dramatic elevation changes, the limited movement of people, and the demands created by crop rotation
for different varieties that will do well in different fields.
Potatoes are only one example of agricultural diversity. Every plant, animal, and fungus that has been
cultivated by humans has been bred from original wild ancestor species into diverse varieties arising
from the demands for food value, adaptation to growing conditions, and resistance to pests. The potato
demonstrates a well-known example of the risks of low crop diversity: during the tragic Irish potato
famine (1845–1852 AD), the single potato variety grown in Ireland became susceptible to a potato
blight—wiping out the crop. The loss of the crop led to famine, death, and mass emigration. Resistance
to disease is a chief benefit to maintaining crop biodiversity and lack of diversity in contemporary crop
species carries similar risks. Seed companies, which are the source of most crop varieties in developed
countries, must continually breed new varieties to keep up with evolving pest organisms. These same
seed companies, however, have participated in the decline of the number of varieties available as they
focus on selling fewer varieties in more areas of the world replacing traditional local varieties.
The ability to create new crop varieties relies on the diversity of varieties available and the availability
of wild forms related to the crop plant. These wild forms are often the source of new gene variants that
can be bred with existing varieties to create varieties with new attributes. Loss of wild species related
to a crop will mean the loss of potential in crop improvement. Maintaining the genetic diversity of wild
species related to domesticated species ensures our continued supply of food.
Since the 1920s, government agriculture departments have maintained seed banks of crop varieties
as a way to maintain crop diversity. This system has flaws because over time seed varieties are lost
through accidents and there is no way to replace them. In 2008, the Svalbard Global seed Vault, located
on Spitsbergen island, Norway, (Figure) began storing seeds from around the world as a backup system
to the regional seed banks. If a regional seed bank stores varieties in Svalbard, losses can be replaced
from Svalbard should something happen to the regional seeds. The Svalbard seed vault is deep into the
rock of the arctic island. Conditions within the vault are maintained at ideal temperature and humidity
for seed survival, but the deep underground location of the vault in the arctic means that failure of the
vault’s systems will not compromise the climatic conditions inside the vault.

Environmental Biology 153

Although crops are largely under our control,
our ability to grow them is dependent on the
biodiversity of the ecosystems in which they are
grown. That biodiversity creates the conditions
under which crops are able to grow through what
are known as ecosystem services—valuable
conditions or processes that are carried out by an
ecosystem. Crops are not grown, for the most
part, in built environments. They are grown in
soil. Although some agricultural soils are
rendered sterile using controversial pesticide
treatments, most contain a huge diversity of
organisms

cycles—breaking down organic matter into
nutrient compounds that crops need for growth. Figure 5. The Svalbard Global Seed Vault is a storage

Tefre, Svalbard Global Seed Vault)
affects water and oxygen dynamics in the soil that
are necessary for plant growth. Replacing the
work of these organisms in forming arable soil is not practically possible. These kinds of processes are
called ecosystem services. They occur within ecosystems, such as soil ecosystems, as a result of the
diverse metabolic activities of the organisms living there, but they provide benefits to human food
production, drinking water availability, and breathable air.
Other key ecosystem services related to food production are plant pollination and crop pest control.
It is estimated that honeybee pollination within the United States brings in $1.6 billion per year; other
pollinators contribute up to $6.7 billion. Over 150 crops in the United States require pollination to
produce. Many honeybee populations are managed by beekeepers who rent out their hives’ services to
farmers. Honeybee populations in North America have been suffering large losses caused by a syndrome
known as colony collapse disorder, a new phenomenon with an unclear cause. Other pollinators include
a diverse array of other bee species and various insects and birds. Loss of these species would make
growing crops requiring pollination impossible, increasing dependence on other crops.
Finally, humans compete for their food with crop pests, most of which are insects. Pesticides control
these competitors, but these are costly and lose their effectiveness over time as pest populations adapt.
They also lead to collateral damage by killing non-pest species as well as beneficial insects like
honeybees, and risking the health of agricultural workers and consumers. Moreover, these pesticides
may migrate from the fields where they are applied and do damage to other ecosystems like streams,
lakes, and even the ocean. Ecologists believe that the bulk of the work in removing pests is actually
done by predators and parasites of those pests, but the impact has not been well studied. A review found
that in 74 percent of studies that looked for an effect of landscape complexity (forests and fallow fields
near to crop fields) on natural enemies of pests, the greater the complexity, the greater the effect of
pest-suppressing organisms. Another experimental study found that introducing multiple enemies of pea
aphids (an important alfalfa pest) increased the yield of alfalfa significantly. This study shows that a
diversity of pests is more effective at control than one single pest. Loss of diversity in pest enemies will
inevitably make it more difficult and costly to grow food. The world’s growing human population faces
significant challenges in the increasing costs and other difficulties associated with producing food.

Wild Food Sources
In addition to growing crops and raising food animals, humans obtain food resources from wild
populations, primarily wild fish populations. For about one billion people, aquatic resources provide the
main source of animal protein. But since 1990, production from global fisheries has declined. Despite
considerable effort, few fisheries on Earth are managed sustainability.
Fishery extinctions rarely lead to complete extinction of the harvested
species, but rather to a radical restructuring of the marine ecosystem in which
a dominant species is so over-harvested that it becomes a minor player,
ecologically. In addition to humans losing the food source, these alterations
affect many other species in ways that are difficult or impossible to predict.
The collapse of fisheries has dramatic and long-lasting effects on local human
populations that work in the fishery. In addition, the loss of an inexpensive
protein source to populations that cannot afford to replace it will increase the
cost of living and limit societies in other ways. In general, the fish taken from Link to Learning: Visit

5.4 Threats to Biodiversity

The core threat to biodiversity on the planet,
and therefore a threat to human welfare, is the
combination of human population growth and the
resources used by that population. The human
population requires resources to survive and
grow, and many of those resources are being
removed unsustainably from the environment.
The three greatest proximate threats to
biodiversity are habitat loss, overharvesting, and
introduction of exotic species. The first two of
these are a direct result of human population
growth and resource use. The third results from

toxic pollution, have specific targeted effects on
species, but are not generally seen as threats at the magnitude of the others.
Habitat Loss
Humans rely on technology to modify their environment and make it habitable. Other species cannot
do this. Elimination of their habitat—whether it is a forest, coral reef, grassland, or flowing river—will
kill the individuals in the species. Remove the entire habitat and the species will become extinct, unless
they are among the few species that do well in human-built environments. Human destruction of habitats

latter half of the twentieth century.

similar area of forest. Forest loss continues in
protected areas of Borneo. The orangutan in
Borneo is listed as endangered by the

(IUCN), but it is simply the most visible of
thousands of species that will not survive the
disappearance of the forests of Borneo. The

estimate of global forest cover loss for the years
from 2000 to 2005 was 3.1%. Much loss (2.4%) occurred in the tropics where forest loss is primarily
from timber extraction. These losses certainly also represent the extinction of species unique to those
areas.

BIOLOGY IN ACTION: Preventing Habitat Destruction with Wise Wood Choices

Most consumers do not imagine that the home improvement products they buy might be
contributing to habitat loss and species extinctions. Yet the market for illegally harvested
tropical timber is huge, and the wood products often find themselves in building supply
stores in the United States. One estimate is that up to 10% of the imported timber in the
United States, which is the world’s largest consumer of wood products, is illegally logged.
In 2006, this amounted to $3.6 billion in wood products. Most of the illegal products are
imported from countries that act as intermediaries and are not the originators of the wood.
How is it possible to determine if a wood product, such as flooring, was harvested sustainably or even
legally? The Forest Stewardship Council (FSC) certifies sustainably harvested forest products. Looking
for their certification on flooring and other hardwood products is one way to ensure that the wood has
not been taken illegally from a tropical forest. There are certifications other than the FSC, but these are
run by timber companies, thus creating a conflict of interest. Another approach is to buy domestic wood
species. While it would be great if there was a list of legal versus illegal woods, it is not that simple.
Logging and forest management laws vary from country to country; what is illegal in one country may
be legal in another. Where and how a product is harvested and whether the forest from which it comes
is being sustainably maintained all factor into whether a wood product will be certified by the FSC. It is
always a good idea to ask questions about where a wood product came from and how the supplier knows
that it was harvested legally.
Habitat destruction can affect ecosystems other than forests. Rivers and streams are important

Environmental Biology 157

ecosystems and are frequently the target of habitat modification. Damming of rivers affects flow and
access to habitat. Altering a flow regime can reduce or eliminate populations that are adapted to seasonal
changes in flow. For example, an estimated 91% of riverways in the United States have been modified
with damming or stream bank modification. Many fish species in the United States, especially rare
species or species with restricted distributions, have seen declines caused by river damming and habitat
loss. Research has confirmed that species of amphibians that must carry out parts of their life cycles in
both aquatic and terrestrial habitats are at greater risk of population declines and extinction because of
the increased likelihood that one of their habitats or access between them will be lost. This is of particular
concern because amphibians have been declining in numbers and going extinct more rapidly than many
other groups for a variety of possible reasons.
Overharvesting
Overharvesting is a serious threat to many species, but particularly to aquatic species. There are many
examples of regulated fisheries (including hunting of marine mammals and harvesting of crustaceans
and other species) monitored by fisheries scientists that have nevertheless collapsed. The western
Atlantic cod fishery is the most spectacular recent collapse. While it was a hugely productive fishery for
400 years, the introduction of modern factory trawlers in the 1980s and the pressure on the fishery led to
it becoming unsustainable. The causes of fishery collapse are both economic and political in nature.
Most fisheries are managed as a common resource, available to anyone
willing to fish, even when the fishing territory lies within a country’s
territorial waters. Common resources are subject to an economic pressure
known as the tragedy of the commons, in which fishers have little
motivation to exercise restraint in harvesting a fishery when they do not
own the fishery. The general outcome of harvests of resources held in
common is their overexploitation. While large fisheries are regulated to
attempt to avoid this pressure, it still exists in the background. This
overexploitation is exacerbated when access to the fishery is open and
unregulated and when technology gives fishers the ability to overfish. In a

Coral reefs are extremely diverse marine ecosystems that face
peril from several processes. Reefs are home to 1/3 of the
world’s marine fish species—about 4000 species—despite making up only one percent of
marine habitat. Most home marine aquaria house coral reef species that are wild-caught
organisms—not cultured organisms. Although no marine species is known to have been
driven extinct by the pet trade, there are studies showing that populations of some species
have declined in response to harvesting, indicating that the harvest is not sustainable at
those levels. There are also concerns about the effect of the pet trade on some terrestrial
species such as turtles, amphibians, birds, plants, and even the orangutans.

Bush meat is the generic term used for wild
animals killed for food. Hunting is practiced
throughout the world, but hunting practices,
particularly in equatorial Africa and parts of
Asia, are believed to threaten several species
with extinction. Traditionally, bush meat in
Africa was hunted to feed families directly.
However, recent commercialization of the
practice now has bush meat available in grocery
stores, which has increased harvest rates to the
level of unsustainability. Additionally, human
population growth has increased the need for
protein foods that are not being met from
agriculture. Species threatened by the bush
meat trade are mostly mammals including many
monkeys and the great apes living in the Congo
basin.

Invasive Species
Exotic species are species that have been intentionally or unintentionally introduced by humans into an
ecosystem in which they did not evolve. Human transportation of people and goods, including the
intentional transport of organisms for trade, has dramatically increased the introduction of species into
new ecosystems. These new introductions are sometimes at distances that are well beyond the capacity
of the species to ever travel itself and outside the range of the species’ natural predators.
Most exotic species introductions probably fail because of the low number of individuals introduced
or poor adaptation to the ecosystem they enter. Some species, however, have characteristics that can
make them especially successful in a new ecosystem. These exotic species often undergo dramatic
population increases in their new habitat and reset the ecological conditions in the new environment,
threatening the species that exist there. When this happens, the exotic species also becomes an invasive
species. Invasive species can threaten other species through competition for resources, predation, or
disease.

this interactive global
database of exotic or
invasive species.

Lakes and islands are particularly vulnerable to extinction threats
from introduced species. In Lake Victoria, the intentional
introduction of the Nile perch was largely responsible for the
extinction of about 200 species of cichlids. The accidental
introduction of the brown tree snake via aircraft (Figure 4) from the
Solomon Islands to Guam in 1950 has led to the extinction of three
species of birds and three to five species of reptiles endemic to the
island. Several other species are still threatened. The brown tree
snake is adept at exploiting human transportation as a means to
migrate; one was even found on an aircraft arriving in Corpus
Christi, Texas. Constant vigilance on the part of airport, military,
and commercial aircraft personnel is required to prevent the snake
from moving from Guam to other islands in the Pacific, especially

Environmental Biology 159

Hawaii. Islands do not make up a large area of land on the globe, but they do contain
a disproportionate number of endemic species because of their isolation from mainland
ancestors.
Many introductions of aquatic species, both marine and
freshwater, have occurred when ships have dumped ballast
water taken on at a port of origin into waters at a destination
port. Water from the port of origin is pumped into tanks on a
ship empty of cargo to increase stability. The water is drawn
from the ocean or estuary of the port and typically contains
living organisms such as plant parts, microorganisms, eggs,
larvae, or aquatic animals. The water is then pumped out
before the ship takes on cargo at the destination port, which
may be on a different continent. The zebra mussel was
introduced to the Great Lakes from Europe prior to 1988 in
ballast water. The zebra mussels in the Great Lakes have Figure 4. The brown tree snake, Boiga
irregularis, is an exotic species that has

mollusk populations, but have also benefited some species,
such as smallmouth bass. The mussels are filter feeders and have dramatically improved water clarity,
which in turn has allowed aquatic plants to grow along shorelines, providing shelter for young fish where
it did not exist before. The European green crab, Carcinus maenas, was introduced to San Francisco Bay
in the late 1990s, likely in ship ballast water, and has spread north along the coast to Washington. The
crabs have been found to dramatically reduce the abundance of native clams and crabs with resulting
increases in the prey species of those native crabs.
Invading exotic species can also be disease organisms. It now appears that the global decline in
amphibian species recognized in the 1990s is, in some part, caused by the fungus Batrachochytrium
dendrobatidis, which causes the disease chytridiomycosis (Figure 5). There is evidence that the fungus
is native to Africa and may have been spread throughout the world by transport of a commonly used
laboratory and pet species: the African clawed frog, Xenopus laevis. It may well be that biologists
themselves are responsible for spreading this disease worldwide. The North American bullfrog, Rana
catesbeiana, which has also been widely introduced as a food animal but which easily escapes captivity,
survives most infections of B. dendrobatidis and can act as a reservoir for the disease.

Early evidence suggests that another fungal pathogen,
Geomyces destructans, introduced from Europe is
responsible for white-nose syndrome, which infects cavehibernating bats in eastern North America and has spread
from a point of origin in western New York State (Figure 6).
The disease has decimated bat populations and threatens
extinction of species already listed as endangered: the
Indiana bat, Myotis sodalis, and potentially the Virginia bigeared bat, Corynorhinus townsendii virginianus. How the
fungus was introduced is unknown, but one logical
presumption would be that recreational cavers
unintentionally brought the fungus on clothes or equipment
from Europe.

Climate Change

Climate
change,
and
specifically
the
anthropogenic warming trend presently underway, is
recognized as a major extinction threat, particularly when
combined with other threats such as habitat loss.
Anthropogenic warming of the planet has been observed and
is due to past and continuing emission of greenhouse gases,
primarily carbon dioxide and methane, into the atmosphere
caused by the burning of fossil fuels and deforestation.
Scientists overwhelmingly agree the present warming trend is
caused by humans and some of the likely effects include
dramatic and dangerous climate changes in the coming
decades. Scientists predict that climate change will alter
regional climates, including rainfall and snowfall patterns,
making habitats less hospitable to the species living in them. Figure 6. This little brown bat in Greeley

on species as they find themselves in contact with other
species not present in their historic range. One such unexpected species contact is between polar bears
and grizzly bears. Previously, these two species had separate ranges. Now, their ranges are overlapping
and there are documented cases of these two species mating and producing viable offspring. Changing
climates also throw off the delicate timing adaptations that species have to seasonal food resources and
breeding times. Scientists have already documented many contemporary mismatches to shifts in
resource availability and timing.
Other shifts in range have been observed. For example, one study indicates that European bird species

Environmental Biology 161

ranges have moved 91 km (56.5 mi) northward, on average. The same study suggested that the optimal
shift based on warming trends was double that distance, suggesting that the populations are not moving
quickly enough. Range shifts have also been observed in plants, butterflies, other insects, freshwater
fishes, reptiles, amphibians, and mammals.
Climate gradients will also move up mountains, eventually crowding species higher in altitude and
eliminating the habitat for those species adapted to the highest elevations. Some climates will completely
disappear. The rate of warming appears to be accelerated in the arctic, which is recognized as a serious
threat to polar bear populations that require sea ice to hunt seals during the winter months. Seals are
a critical source of protein for polar bears. A trend to decreasing sea ice coverage has occurred since
observations began in the mid-twentieth century. The rate of decline observed in recent years is far
greater than previously predicted by climate models.

Figure 7. The effect of global warming can be seen in the continuing retreat of Grinnell Glacier. The mean annual
temperature in Glacier National Park has increased 1.33°C since 1900. The loss of a glacier results in the loss of
summer meltwaters, sharply reducing seasonal water supplies and severely affecting local ecosystems. (credit: USGS,
GNP Archives)

Finally, global warming will raise ocean levels due to meltwater from glaciers and the greater volume
occupied by warmer water. Shorelines will be inundated, reducing island size, which will have an effect
on some species, and a number of islands will disappear entirely. Additionally, the gradual melting and
subsequent refreezing of the poles, glaciers, and higher elevation mountains—a cycle that has provided
freshwater to environments for centuries—will be altered. This could result in an overabundance of salt
water and a shortage of fresh water.

5.5 Preserving Biodiversity

Preserving biodiversity is an extraordinary challenge that must be met by greater understanding of
biodiversity itself, changes in human behavior and beliefs, and various preservation strategies.

Change in Biodiversity through Time
The number of species on the planet, or in any geographical area, is the result of an equilibrium of
two evolutionary processes that are ongoing: speciation and extinction. When speciation rates begin
to outstrip extinction rates, the number of species will increase. Likewise, the reverse is true when
extinction rates begin to overtake speciation rates. Throughout the history of life on Earth, as reflected
in the fossil record, these two processes have fluctuated to a greater or lesser extent, sometimes leading
to dramatic changes in the number of species on the planet as reflected in the fossil record (Figure 1).
Paleontologists have identified five layers in
the fossil record that appear to show sudden and
dramatic losses in biodiversity. These are called
mass extinctions and are characterized by more
than half of all species disappearing from the
fossil record. There are many lesser, yet still
dramatic, extinction events, but the five mass
extinctions have attracted the most research into
their causes. An argument can be made that the
five mass extinctions are only the five most
extreme events in a continuous series of large
extinction events throughout the fossil record
Figure 1. Extinction intensity as reflected in the fossil
(since 542 million years ago). The most recent
record has fluctuated throughout Earth’s history. Sudden
and dramatic losses of biodiversity, called mass
extinction in geological time, about 65 million
extinctions, have occurred five times.
years ago, saw the disappearance of most
dinosaurs species (except birds) and many other
species. Most scientists now agree the main cause of this extinction was the impact of a large asteroid in
the present-day Yucatán Peninsula and the subsequent energy release and global climate changes caused
by dust ejected into the atmosphere.
Recent and Current Extinction Rates
Many biologists say that we are currently experience a sixth mass extinction and it mostly has to do with
the activities of humans. There are numerous recent extinctions of individual species that are recorded
in human writings. Most of these are coincident with the expansion of the European colonies since the
1500s.
One of the earlier and popularly known examples is the dodo bird. The dodo bird lived in the forests
of Mauritius, an island in the Indian Ocean. The dodo bird became extinct around 1662. It was hunted
163

164 Matthew R. Fisher, Editor

for its meat by sailors and was easy prey because the dodo, which did not evolve with humans, would
approach people without fear. Introduced pigs, rats, and dogs brought to the island by European ships
also killed dodo young and eggs (Figure 2).
Steller’s sea cow became extinct in 1768; it was related
to the manatee and probably once lived along the
northwest coast of North America. Steller’s sea cow was
discovered by Europeans in 1741, and it was hunted for
meat and oil. A total of 27 years elapsed between the sea
cow’s first contact with Europeans and extinction of the
species. The last Steller’s sea cow was killed in 1768. In
another example, the last living passenger pigeon died in
a zoo in Cincinnati, Ohio, in 1914. This species had once
migrated in the millions but declined in numbers because
of overhunting and loss of habitat through the clearing of
forests for farmland.
These are only a few of the recorded extinctions in the
past 500 years. The International Union for Conservation
of Nature (IUCN) keeps a list of extinct and endangered Figure 2. The dodo bird was hunted to extinction
species called the Red List. The list is not complete, but it around 1662. (credit: Ed Uthman, taken in
describes 380 vertebrates that became extinct after 1500 Natural History Museum, London, England)
AD, 86 of which were driven extinct by overhunting or
overfishing.
Estimates of Present-day Extinction Rates
Estimates of extinction rates are hampered by the fact that most extinctions are probably happening
without being observed. The extinction of a bird or mammal is often noticed by humans, especially if
it has been hunted or used in some other way. But there are many organisms that are less noticeable to
humans (not necessarily of less value) and many that are undescribed.
The background extinction rate is estimated to be about 1 per million species years (E/MSY). One
“species year” is one species in existence for one year. One million species years could be one species
persisting for one million years, or a million species persisting for one year. If it is the latter, then one
extinction per million species years would be one of those million species becoming extinct in that year.
For example, if there are 10 million species in existence, then we would expect 10 of those species to
become extinct in a year. This is the background rate.
One contemporary extinction-rate estimate uses the extinctions in the written record since the year
1500. For birds alone, this method yields an estimate of 26 E/MSY, almost three times the background
rate. However, this value may be underestimated for three reasons. First, many existing species would
not have been described until much later in the time period and so their loss would have gone unnoticed.
Second, we know the number is higher than the written record suggests because now extinct species are
being described from skeletal remains that were never mentioned in written history. And third, some
species are probably already extinct even though conservationists are reluctant to name them as such.
Taking these factors into account raises the estimated extinction rate to nearer 100 E/MSY. The predicted
rate by the end of the century is 1500 E/MSY.

Environmental Biology 165

A second approach to estimating present-time
extinction rates is to correlate species loss with
habitat loss, and it is based on measuring forestarea loss and understanding species–area
relationships. The species-area relationship is the
rate at which new species are seen when the area
surveyed is increased (Figure 3). Likewise, if the
habitat area is reduced, the number of species
seen will also decline. This kind of relationship is
also seen in the relationship between an island’s
area and the number of species present on the
island: as one increases, so does the other, though
Figure 3. A typical species-area curve shows the

that reducing forest area from 100 km2 to 10 km2,
a decline of 90 percent, reduces the number of
species by about 50 percent. Species–area estimates have led to estimates of present-day species
extinction rates of about 1000 E/MSY and higher.

Conservation of Biodiversity
The threats to biodiversity have been recognized for some time. Today, the main efforts to preserve
biodiversity involve legislative approaches to regulate human and corporate behavior, setting aside
protected areas, and habitat restoration.
Changing Human Behavior
Legislation has been enacted to protect species throughout the world. The
legislation includes international treaties as well as national and state laws.
The Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild
Fauna and Flora (CITES) treaty came into force in 1975. The treaty, and
the national legislation that supports it, provides a legal framework for
preventing “listed” species from being transported across nations’ borders,
thus protecting them from being caught or killed when the purpose involves Link to Learning: Go to this

legislation. The illegal trade in organisms and their parts is probably a extinction.
market in the hundreds of millions of dollars.
Within many countries there are laws that protect endangered species and that regulate hunting and
fishing. In the United States, the Endangered Species Act (ESA) was enacted in 1973. When an at-risk

166 Matthew R. Fisher, Editor

species is listed by the Act, the U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service is required by law to develop a management
plan to protect the species and bring it back to sustainable numbers. The ESA, and others like it in other
countries, is a useful tool, but it suffers because it is often difficult to get a species listed or to get an
effective management plan in place once a species is listed.
The Migratory Bird Treaty Act (MBTA) is an agreement between the United States and Canada that
was signed into law in 1918 in response to declines in North American bird species caused by hunting.
The Act now lists over 800 protected species. It makes it illegal to disturb or kill the protected species
or distribute their parts (much of the hunting of birds in the past was for their feathers). Examples of
protected species include northern cardinals, the red-tailed hawk, and the American black vulture.
Global warming is expected to be a major driver of biodiversity loss. Many governments are
concerned about the effects of anthropogenic global warming, primarily on their economies and food
resources. Because greenhouse gas emissions do not respect national boundaries, the effort to curb them
is international. The international response to global warming has been mixed. The Kyoto Protocol, an
international agreement that came out of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change
that committed countries to reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 2012, was ratified by some countries,
but spurned by others. Two countries that were especially important in terms of their potential impact
that did not ratify the Kyoto protocol were the United States and China. Some goals for reduction in
greenhouse gasses were met and exceeded by individual countries, but, worldwide, the effort to limit
greenhouse gas production is not succeeding. A renegotiated 2016 treaty, called the Paris Agreement,
once again brought nations together to take meaningful action on climate change. But like before,
some nations are reluctant to participate. The newly-elected President Trump has indicated that he will
withdraw the United States’ support of the agreement.
Conservation in Preserves
Establishment of wildlife and ecosystem
preserves is one of the key tools in conservation
efforts (Figure 4). A preserve is an area of land
set aside with varying degrees of protection for
the organisms that exist within the boundaries of
the preserve. In 2003, the IUCN World Parks
Congress estimated that 11.5 percent of Earth’s
land surface was covered by preserves of various
kinds. This area is large but only represents 9 out
of 14 recognized major biomes and research has
shown that 12 percent of all species live outside Figure 4. National parks, such as Grand Teton National
preserves.
Park in Wyoming, help conserve biodiversity. (credit: Don
A biodiversity hotspot is a conservation DeBold)
concept developed by Norman Myers in 1988.
Hotspots are geographical areas that contain high numbers of endemic species. The purpose of the
concept was to identify important locations on the planet for conservation efforts, a kind of conservation
triage. By protecting hotspots, governments are able to protect a larger number of species. The original
criteria for a hotspot included the presence of 1500 or more species of endemic plants and 70 percent of
the area disturbed by human activity. There are now 34 biodiversity hotspots (Figure 5) that contain large
numbers of endemic species, which include half of Earth’s endemic plants.

Environmental Biology 167

Figure 5. Conservation International has identified 34 biodiversity hotspots. Although these cover only 2.3 percent of
the Earth’s surface, 42 percent of the terrestrial vertebrate species and 50 percent of the world’s plants are endemic to
those hotspots.

There has been extensive research into optimal preserve designs for maintaining biodiversity. The
fundamental principles behind much of the research have come from the seminal theoretical work of
Robert H. MacArthur and Edward O. Wilson published in 1967 on island biogeography.1 This work
sought to understand the factors affecting biodiversity on islands. Conservation preserves can be seen
as “islands” of habitat within “an ocean” of non-habitat. In general, large preserves are better because
they support more species, including species with large home ranges; they have more core area of
optimal habitat for individual species; they have more niches to support more species; and they attract
more species because they can be found and reached more easily. One large preserve is better than the
same area of several smaller preserves because there is more core habitat unaffected by less hospitable
ecosystems outside the preserve boundary. For this same reason, preserves in the shape of a square or
circle will be better than a preserve with many thin “arms.” If preserves must be smaller, then providing
wildlife corridors (narrow strips of protected land) between two preserves is important so that species
and their genes can move between them. All of these factors are taken into consideration when planning
the nature of a preserve before the land is set aside.
In addition to the physical specifications of a preserve, there are a variety of regulations related to
the use of a preserve. These can include anything from timber extraction, mineral extraction, regulated
hunting, human habitation, and nondestructive human recreation. Many of the decisions to include these
other uses are made based on political pressures rather than conservation considerations. On the other
hand, in some cases, wildlife protection policies have been so strict that subsistence-living indigenous
populations have been forced from ancestral lands that fell within a preserve. In other cases, even if a
preserve is designed to protect wildlife, if the protections are not or cannot be enforced, the preserve
status will have little meaning in the face of illegal poaching and timber extraction. This is a widespread
problem with preserves in the tropics.

Climate change will create inevitable problems with the location of
preserves as the species within them migrate to higher latitudes as the habitat
of the preserve becomes less favorable. Planning for the effects of global
warming on future preserves, or adding new preserves to accommodate the
changes expected from global warming is in progress, but will only be as
effective as the accuracy of the predictions of the effects of global warming
on future habitats.
Finally, an argument can be made that conservation preserves reinforce
the cultural perception that humans are separate from nature, can exist
outside of it, and can only operate in ways that do damage to biodiversity.
Creating preserves reduces the pressure on human activities outside the
preserves to be sustainable and non-damaging to biodiversity. Ultimately, the
political, economic, and human demographic pressures will degrade and
reduce the size of conservation preserves if the activities outside them are
not altered to be less damaging to biodiversity.
Habitat Restoration

Habitat restoration is the process of bringing an area back to its natural state, before it was impacted
through destructive human activities. It holds considerable promise as a mechanism for maintaining or
restoring biodiversity. Reintroducing wolves, a top predator, to Yellowstone National Park in 1995 led
to dramatic changes in the ecosystem that increased biodiversity. The wolves (Figure 6) function to
suppress elk and coyote populations and provide more abundant resources to the detritivores. Reducing
elk populations has allowed revegetation of riparian (the areas along the banks of a stream or river)
areas, which has increased the diversity of species in that habitat. Reduction of coyote populations by
wolves has increased the prey species previously suppressed by coyotes. In this habitat, the wolf is a
keystone species, meaning a species that is instrumental in maintaining diversity within an ecosystem.
Removing a keystone species from an ecological community causes a collapse in diversity. The results
from the Yellowstone experiment suggest that restoring a keystone species effectively can have the effect
of restoring biodiversity in the community. Ecologists have argued for the identification of keystone
species where possible and for focusing protection efforts on these species. It makes sense to return the
keystone species to the ecosystems where they have been removed.

Environmental Biology 169

Other large-scale restoration experiments
underway involve dam removal. In the United
States, since the mid-1980s, many aging dams are
being considered for removal rather than
replacement because of shifting beliefs about the
ecological value of free-flowing rivers. The
measured benefits of dam removal include
restoration of naturally fluctuating water levels
(often the purpose of dams is to reduce variation in
river flows), which leads to increased fish diversity
and improved water quality. In the Pacific
Northwest of the United States, dam removal
projects are expected to increase populations of Figure 6. This photograph shows the Gibbon wolf pack
salmon, which is considered a keystone species in Yellowstone National Park, March 1, 2007. Wolves
because it transports nutrients to inland ecosystems have been identified as a keystone species. (credit: Doug
Smith, NPS)
during its annual spawning migrations. In other
regions, such as the Atlantic coast, dam removal
has allowed the return of other spawning anadromous fish species (species that are born in fresh water,
live most of their lives in salt water, and return to fresh water to spawn). Some of the largest dam removal
projects have yet to occur or have happened too recently for the consequences to be measured, such as
Elwha Dam on the Olympic Peninsula of Washington State. The large-scale ecological experiments that
these removal projects constitute will provide valuable data for other dam projects slated either for
removal or construction.
The Role of Zoos and Captive Breeding

Figure 7. Zoos and captive breeding
programs help preserve many
endangered species, such as this golden
lion tamarin. (credit: Garrett Ziegler)

Zoos have sought to play a role in conservation efforts both
through captive breeding programs and education (Figure 7). The
transformation of the missions of zoos from collection and
exhibition facilities to organizations that are dedicated to
conservation is ongoing. In general, it has been recognized that,
except in some specific targeted cases, captive breeding programs
for endangered species are inefficient and often prone to failure
when the species are reintroduced to the wild. Zoo facilities are far
too limited to contemplate captive breeding programs for the
numbers of species that are now at risk. Education, on the other
hand, is a potential positive impact of zoos on conservation efforts,
particularly given the global trend to urbanization and the
consequent reduction in contacts between people and wildlife. A
number of studies have been performed to look at the effectiveness
of zoos on people’s attitudes and actions regarding conservation
and at present, the results tend to be mixed.

5.6 Chapter Resources

Summary
Biodiversity exists at multiple levels of organization, and is measured in different ways depending
on the goals of those taking the measurements. These include numbers of species, genetic diversity,
chemical diversity, and ecosystem diversity. Humans use many compounds that were first discovered or
derived from living organisms as medicines: secondary plant compounds, animal toxins, and antibiotics
produced by bacteria and fungi. Ecosystems provide ecosystem services that support human agriculture:
pollination, nutrient cycling, pest control, and soil development and maintenance. Loss of biodiversity
threatens these ecosystem services and risks making food production more expensive or impossible.
The core threats to biodiversity are human population growth and unsustainable resource use. Climate
change is predicted to be a significant cause of extinction in the coming century. Exotic species have
been the cause of a number of extinctions and are especially damaging to islands and lakes. International
treaties such as CITES regulate the transportation of endangered species across international borders.
In the United States, the Endangered Species Act protects listed species but is hampered by procedural
difficulties and a focus on individual species. The Migratory Bird Act is an agreement between Canada
and the United States to protect migratory birds. Presently, 11 percent of Earth’s land surface is protected
in some way. Habitat restoration has the potential to restore ecosystems to previous biodiversity levels
before species become extinct. Examples of restoration include reintroduction of keystone species and
removal of dams on rivers.

Bayee Waqo (12) was named after her grandmother Bayee
Chumee (82). When her son and his wife both died of AIDS,
Chumee took on the care of their daughter who was just two years
old. Some years later, after repeated illness, the young girl was
diagnosed HIV positive, and she has been on treatment since. At
82, Chumee is getting too weak for all the household chores, so
her granddaughter helps by collecting firewood, fetching water,

6.1 The Impacts of Environmental Conditions

Our industrialized society dumps huge amounts of pollutants and toxic wastes into the earth’s biosphere
without fully considering the consequences. Such actions seriously degrade the health of the earth’s
ecosystems, and this degradation ultimately affects the health and well-being of human populations.
For most of human history, biological agents were the most significant factor in health. These
included pathogenic (disease causing) organisms such as bacteria, viruses, protozoa, and internal
parasites. In modern times, cardiovascular diseases, cancer, and accidents are the leading killers in
most parts of the world. However, infectious diseases still cause about 22 million deaths a year,
mostly in undeveloped countries. These diseases include: tuberculosis, malaria, pneumonia, influenza,
whooping cough, dysentery and Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS). Most of those affected
are children. Malnutrition, unclean water, poor sanitary conditions and lack of proper medical care
all play roles in these deaths. Compounding the problems of infectious diseases are factors such
as drug-resistant pathogens, insecticide resistant carriers, and overpopulation. Overuse of antibiotics
have allowed pathogens to develop a resistance to drugs. For example, tuberculosis (TB) was nearly
eliminated in most parts of the world, but drug-resistant strains have now reversed that trend. Another
example is malaria. The insecticide DDT (a chemical called dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane) was
widely used to control malaria-carrying mosquito populations in tropical regions. However, after many
years the mosquitoes developed a natural resistance to DDT and again spread the disease widely. Antimalarial medicines were also over-prescribed, which allowed the malaria pathogen to become drugresistant.
Chemical agents also have significant effects on human health. Toxic heavy metals, dioxins,
pesticides, and endocrine disrupters are examples of these chemical agents. Heavy metals (e.g., mercury,
lead, & cadmium) are typically produced as by-products of mining and manufacturing processes. All of
them biomagnify (become more concentrated in species with increasing food chain level). For example,
mercury from polluted water can accumulate in swordfish to levels toxic to humans. When toxic heavy
metals get into the body, they accumulate in tissues and may eventually cause sickness or death. Studies
show that people with above-average lead levels in their bones have an increased risk of developing
attention deficit disorder and aggressive behavior. Lead can also damage brain cells and affect muscular
coordination.

ENVIRONMENTAL PERSISTENCE OF DDT

The pesticide DDT was widely used for decades. It was seen as an
ideal pesticide because it is inexpensive and breaks down slowly in
the environment. Unfortunately, the latter characteristic allows this
chemical agent to biomagnify through the food chain. Populations of
bird species at the top of the food chain, e.g., eagles and pelicans, are
greatly affected by DDT in the environment. When these birds have
sufficient levels of DDT, the shells of their eggs are so thin that they
break, making reproduction impossible. After DDT was banned in
the United States in 1972, affected bird populations made noticeable
recoveries, including the iconic bald eagle.

6.2 Environmental Health

Environmental health is concerned with preventing disease, death and disability by reducing exposure
to adverse environmental conditions and promoting behavioral change. It focuses on the direct and
indirect causes of diseases and injuries, and taps resources inside and outside the health care system to
help improve health outcomes.

Table 1. Typical Environmental Health Issues: Determinants and Health Consequences.

Poverty, Health and Environment
Environmental health risks can be grouped into two broad categories. Traditional hazards are related
to poverty and the lack of development and mostly affect developing countries and poor people. Their
impact exceeds that of modern health hazards by 10 times in Africa, 5 times in Asian countries (except
for China), and 2.5 times in Latin America and Middle East (Figure 1). Water-related diseases caused
by inadequate water supply and sanitation impose an especially large health burden in Africa, Asia, and
179

180 Matthew R. Fisher, Editor

the Pacific region. In India alone, over 700,000 children under 5 die annually from diarrhea. In Africa,
malaria causes about 500,000 deaths annually. More than half of the world’s households use unprocessed
solid fuels, particularly biomass (crop residues, wood, and dung) for cooking and heating in inefficient
stoves without proper ventilation, exposing people—mainly poor women and children—to high levels
of indoor air pollution(IAP). IAP causes about 2 million deaths in each year.

Figure 1. Traditional environmental health hazards prevail in developing countries but modern risks are also
significant.

Modern hazards, caused by technological development, prevail in industrialized countries where
exposure to traditional hazards is low. The contribution of modern environmental risks to the disease
burden in most developing countries is similar to – and in quite a few countries, greater than – that in rich
countries. Urban air pollution, for example, is highest in parts of China, India and some cities in Asia
and Latin America. Poor people increasingly experience a “double burden” of traditional and modern
environmental health risks. Their total burden of illness and death from all causes per million people is
about twice that in rich countries, and the disease burden from environmental risks is 10 times greater.

Environmental Biology 181

Environmental Health and Child Survival
Worldwide, the top killers of children under five are acute
respiratory infections (from indoor air pollution); diarrheal diseases
(mostly from poor water, sanitation, and hygiene); and infectious
diseases such as malaria. Children are especially susceptible to
environmental factors that put them at risk of developing illness early
in life. Malnutrition (the condition that occurs when body does not
get enough nutrients) is an important contributor to child
mortality—malnutrition and environmental infections are inextricably
linked. The World Health Organization (WHO) recently concluded
that about 50% of the consequences of malnutrition are in fact caused
by inadequate water and sanitation provision and poor hygienic
practices.
Poor Water and Sanitation Access

billion without adequate sanitation, the magnitude of the water and
sanitation problem remains significant. Each year contaminated water and poor sanitation contribute to
5.4 billion cases of diarrhea worldwide and 1.6 million deaths, mostly among children under the age of
five. Intestinal worms, which thrive in poor sanitary conditions, infect close to 90 percent of children in
the developing world and, depending on the severity of the infection may lead to malnutrition, anemia,
or stunted growth. About 6 million people are blind from trachoma, a disease caused by the lack of clean
water combined with poor hygiene practices.
Indoor Air Pollution

Indoor air pollution—a much less publicized source of poor health—is responsible for more than 1.6
million deaths per year and for 2.7% of global burden of disease. It is estimated that half of the world’s
population, mainly in developing countries, uses solid fuels (biomass and coal) for household cooking
and space heating. Cooking and heating with such solid fuels on open fires or stoves without chimneys
lead to indoor air pollution and subsequently, respiratory infections. Exposure to these health-damaging
pollutants is particularly high among women and children in developing countries, who spend the most
time inside the household. As many as half of the deaths attributable to indoor use of solid fuel are of
children under the age of five.
Malaria

Approximately 40% of the world’s people—mostly those living in the world’s poorest countries—are at
risk from malaria. Malaria is an infectious disease spread by mosquitoes but caused by a single-celled
parasite called Plasmodium. Every year, more than 200 million people become infected with malaria
and about 430,000 die, with most cases and deaths found in Sub-Saharan Africa. However, Asia, Latin
America, the Middle East, and parts of Europe are also affected. Pregnant women are especially at high
risk of malaria. Non-immune pregnant women risk both acute and severe clinical disease, resulting in
fetal loss in up to 60% of such women and maternal deaths in more than 10%, including a 50% mortality
rate for those with severe disease. Semi-immune pregnant women with malaria infection risk severe

182 Matthew R. Fisher, Editor

anemia and impaired fetal growth, even if they show no signs of acute clinical disease. An estimated
10,000 women and 200,000 infants die annually as a result of malaria infection during pregnancy.
Emerging Diseases

Emerging and re-emerging diseases have been defined as infectious diseases of humans whose
occurrence during the past two decades has substantially increased or threatens to increase in the near
future relative to populations affected, geographic distribution, or magnitude of impacts. Examples
include Ebola virus, West Nile virus, Zika virus, sudden acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), H1N1
influenza; swine and avian influenza (swine, bird flu), HIV, and a variety of other viral, bacterial, and
protozoal diseases.
A variety of environmental factors may contribute to re-emergence of a particular disease, including
temperature, moisture, human food or animal feed sources, etc. Disease re-emergence may be caused by
the coincidence of several of these environmental and/or social factors to allow optimal conditions for
transmission of the disease.
Ebola, previously known as Ebola hemorrhagic fever, is a rare and deadly disease caused by
infection with one of the Ebola virus strains. Ebola can cause disease in humans and nonhuman
primates. The 2014 Ebola epidemic is the largest in history (with over 28,000 cases and 11,302 deaths),
affecting multiple countries in West Africa. There were a small number of cases reported in Nigeria and
Mali and a single case reported in Senegal; however, these cases were contained, with no further spread
in these countries.
The HIV/AIDS epidemic has spread with ferocious speed. Virtually unknown 20 years ago, HIV has
infected more than 60 million people worldwide. Each day, approximately 14,000 new infections occur,
more than half of them among young people below age 25. Over 95 percent of PLWHA (People Living
With HIV/AIDS) are in low- and middle- income countries. More than 20 million have died from AIDS,
over 3 million in 2002 alone. AIDS is now the leading cause of death in Sub-Saharan Africa and the
fourth-biggest killer globally. The epidemic has cut life expectancy by more than 10 years in several
nations.
It seems likely that a wide variety of infectious diseases have affected human populations for
thousands of years emerging when the environmental, host, and agent conditions were
favorable. Expanding human populations have increased the potential for transmission of infectious
disease as a result of close human proximity and increased likelihood for humans to be in “the wrong
place at the right time” for disease to occur (eg, natural disasters or political conflicts). Global travel
increases the potential for a carrier of disease to transmit infection thousands of miles away in just a few
hours, as evidenced by WHO precautions concerning international travel and health.
Antibiotic Resistance
Antibiotics and similar drugs, together called antimicrobial agents, have been used for the last 70 years
to treat patients who have infectious diseases. Since the 1940s, these drugs have greatly reduced illness
and death from infectious diseases. However, these drugs have been used so widely and for so long that
the infectious organisms the antibiotics are designed to kill have adapted to them, making the drugs less
effective. Antibiotic resistance occurs when bacteria change in a way that reduces the effectiveness of
drugs, chemicals, or other agents designed to cure or prevent infections. This is caused by the process of
evolution through natural selection (Figure 3). The antibiotic-resistant bacteria survive and continue to
multiply, causing more harm.

Environmental Biology 183

Figure 3. Antibiotic resistance is of increasing concern to medical professionals.

New forms of antibiotic resistance can cross international boundaries and spread between continents
with ease. Many forms of resistance spread with remarkable speed. Each year in the United States,
at least 2 million people acquire serious infections with bacteria that are resistant to one or more of
the antibiotics designed to treat those infections. At least 23,000 people die each year in the US as
a direct result of these antibiotic-resistant infections. Many more die from other conditions that were
complicated by an antibiotic-resistant infection. The use of antibiotics is the single most important factor
leading to antibiotic resistance around the world.
Antibiotics are among the most commonly
prescribed drugs used in human medicine, but up to
50% of all the antibiotics prescribed for people are not
needed or are not optimally effective as prescribed.
During recent years, there has been growing
concern over methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus
aureus (MRSA), a bacterium that is resistant to many
antibiotics. In the community, most MRSA infections
are skin infections. In medical facilities, MRSA causes
life-threatening bloodstream infections, pneumonia
and surgical site infections.

6.3 Environmental Toxicology

Environmental toxicology is the scientific study of the health effects associated with exposure to toxic
chemicals (Table 1) occurring in the natural, work, and living environments. The term also describes the
management of environmental toxins and toxicity, and the development of protections for humans and
the environment.

185

186 Matthew R. Fisher, Editor

Routes of Exposure to Chemicals
Table 1. The ATSDR 2013 Substance Priority List. The table below
lists top 20 substances, in order of priority, which are determined to
pose the most significant potential threat to human health. This
priority list is not a list of “most toxic” substances but rather a
prioritization of substances based on a combination of their frequency,
toxicity, and potential for human exposure at various sites.

In order to cause health problems, chemicals
must enter your body. There are three main
“routes of exposure,” or ways a chemical can
get into your body.

Chemical substances can take a variety of
forms. They can be in the form of solids,
liquids, dusts, vapors, gases, fibers, mists and
fumes. The form a substance is in has a lot to
do with how it gets into your body and what
harm it can cause. A chemical can also change
forms. For example, liquid solvents can
evaporate and give off vapors that you can
inhale. Sometimes chemicals are in a form
that can’t be seen or smelled, so they can’t be
easily detected.

• Swallowing (ingestion): This can happen
when chemicals have spilled or settled onto
food, beverages, cigarettes, beards, or hands.
Once chemicals have entered your body, some
can move into your bloodstream and reach
internal “target” organs, such as the lungs,
liver, kidneys, or nervous system.

What Health Effects Can Chemicals
Cause?

An acute effect of a contaminant (The term “contaminant” means hazardous substances, pollutants,
pollution, and chemicals) is one that occurs rapidly after exposure to a large amount of that substance. A
chronic effect of a contaminant results from exposure to small amounts of a substance over a long
period of time. In such a case, the effect may not be immediately obvious. Chronic effect are difficult
to measure, as the effects may not be seen for years. Long-term exposure to cigarette smoking, low level
radiation exposure, and moderate alcohol use are all thought to produce chronic effects.

Environmental Biology 187

For centuries, scientists have known that just about any substance is toxic in sufficient quantities.
For example, small amounts of selenium are required by living organisms for proper functioning, but
large amounts may cause cancer. The effect of a certain chemical on an individual depends on the
dose (amount) of the chemical. This relationship is often illustrated by a dose-response curve which
shows the relationship between dose and the response of the individual. Lethal doses in humans have
been determined for many substances from information gathered from records of homicides, accidental
poisonings, and testing on animals.
A dose that is lethal to 50% of a population of test animals is called the lethal dose-50% or LD-50.
Determination of the LD-50 is required for new synthetic chemicals in order to give a measure of their
toxicity. A dose that causes 50% of a population to exhibit any significant response (e.g., hair loss,
stunted development) is referred to as the effective dose-50% or ED-50. Some toxins have a threshold
amount below which there is no apparent effect on the exposed population.
Environmental Contaminants
The contamination of the air, water, or soil with potentially harmful substances can affect any person
or community. Contaminants (Table 2) are often chemicals found in the environment in amounts higher
than what would be there naturally. We can be exposed to these contaminants from a variety of
residential, commercial, and industrial sources. Sometimes harmful environmental contaminants occur
biologically, such as mold or a toxic algae bloom.
Table 2. Classification of Environmental Contaminants

Carcinogen

An agent which may produce cancer (uncontrolled cell growth), either by itself or in conjunction w
another substance. Examples include formaldehyde, asbestos, radon, vinyl chloride, and tobacco.

Teratogen

Mutagen

Neurotoxicant

Endocrine disruptor

A substance which can cause physical defects in a developing embryo. Examples include alcohol an
cigarette smoke.
A material that induces genetic changes (mutations) in the DNA. Examples include radioactive
substances, x-rays and ultraviolet radiation.

A substance that can cause an adverse effect on the chemistry, structure or function of the nervous s
Examples include lead and mercury.

A chemical that may interfere with the body’s endocrine (hormonal) system and produce adverse
developmental, reproductive, neurological, and immune effects in both humans and wildlife. A wid
of substances, both natural and man-made, are thought to cause endocrine disruption, including
pharmaceuticals, dioxin and dioxin-like compounds, arsenic, polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), DD
other pesticides, and plasticizers such as bisphenol A (BPA).

An Overview of Some Common Contaminants
Arsenic is a naturally occurring element that is normally present throughout our environment in water,

188 Matthew R. Fisher, Editor

soil, dust, air, and food. Levels of arsenic can regionally vary due to farming and industrial activity as
well as natural geological processes. The arsenic from farming and smelting tends to bind strongly to
soil and is expected to remain near the surface of the land for hundreds of years as a long-term source
of exposure. Wood that has been treated with chromated copper arsenate (CCA) is commonly found
in decks and railing in existing homes and outdoor structures such as playground equipment. Some
underground aquifers are located in rock or soil that has naturally high arsenic content.
Most arsenic gets into the body through ingestion of food or water. Arsenic in drinking water is a
problem in many countries around the world, including Bangladesh, Chile, China, Vietnam, Taiwan,
India, and the United States. Arsenic may also be found in foods, including rice and some fish, where
it is present due to uptake from soil and water. It can also enter the body by breathing dust containing
arsenic. Researchers are finding that arsenic, even at low levels, can interfere with the body’s endocrine
system. Arsenic is also a known human carcinogen associated with skin, lung, bladder, kidney, and liver
cancer.
Mercury is a naturally occurring metal, a useful chemical in some products, and a potential health
risk. Mercury exists in several forms; the types people are usually exposed to are methylmercury and
elemental mercury. Elemental mercury at room temperature is a shiny, silver-white liquid which can
produce a harmful odorless vapor. Methylmercury, an organic compound, can build up in the bodies of
long-living, predatory fish. To keep mercury out of the fish we eat and the air we breathe, it’s important
to take mercury-containing products to a hazardous waste facility for disposal. Common products sold
today that contain small amounts of mercury include fluorescent lights and button-cell batteries.
Although fish and shellfish have many nutritional benefits, consuming large quantities of fish
increases a person’s exposure to mercury. Pregnant women who eat fish high in mercury on a regular
basis run the risk of permanently damaging their developing fetuses. Children born to these mothers
may exhibit motor difficulties, sensory problems and cognitive deficits. Figure 1 identifies the typical
(average) amounts of mercury in commonly consumed commercial and sport-caught fish.

Environmental Biology 189

Figure 1. Mercury concentrations in fish can reach potentially dangerous levels (published by the

190 Matthew R. Fisher, Editor

Maine Center for Disease Control & Prevention).

Bisphenol A (BPA) is a chemical synthesized in large quantities for use primarily in the production
of polycarbonate plastics and epoxy resins. Polycarbonate plastics have many applications including use
in some food and drink packaging, e.g., water and infant bottles, compact discs, impact-resistant safety
equipment, and medical devices. Epoxy resins are used as lacquers to coat metal products such as food
cans, bottle tops, and water supply pipes. Some dental sealants and composites may also contribute to
BPA exposure. The primary source of exposure to BPA for most people is through the diet. Bisphenol
A can leach into food from the protective internal epoxy resin coatings of canned foods and from
consumer products such as polycarbonate tableware, food storage containers, water bottles, and baby
bottles. The degree to which BPA leaches from polycarbonate bottles into liquid may depend more on
the temperature of the liquid or bottle, than the age of the container. BPA can also be found in breast
milk.
What can I do to prevent exposure to BPA?
Some animal studies suggest that infants and children may be the most vulnerable to the effects of BPA.
Parents and caregivers, can make the personal choice to reduce exposures of their infants and children
to BPA:
• Don’t microwave polycarbonate plastic food containers. Polycarbonate is strong and durable,
but over time it may break down from over use at high temperatures.
• Plastic containers have recycle codes on the bottom. Some, but not all, plastics that are
marked with recycle codes 3 or 7 may be made with BPA.
• Reduce your use of canned foods.
• When possible, opt for glass, porcelain or stainless steel containers, particularly for hot food
or liquids.
• Use baby bottles that are BPA free.
Phthalates are a group of synthetic chemicals used to soften and increase the flexibility of plastic and
vinyl. Polyvinyl chloride is made softer and more flexible by the addition of phthalates. Phthalates are
used in hundreds of consumer products. Phthalates are used in cosmetics and personal care products,
including perfume, hair spray, soap, shampoo, nail polish, and skin moisturizers. They are used in
consumer products such as flexible plastic and vinyl toys, shower curtains, wallpaper, vinyl miniblinds,
food packaging, and plastic wrap. Exposure to low levels of phthalates may come from eating food
packaged in plastic that contains phthalates or breathing dust in rooms with vinyl miniblinds, wallpaper,
or recently installed flooring that contain phthalates. We can be exposed to phthalates by drinking water
that contains phthalates. Phthalates are suspected to be endocrine disruptors.
Lead is a metal that occurs naturally in the rocks and soil of the earth’s crust. It is also produced
from burning fossil fuels such as coal, oil, gasoline, and natural gas; mining; and manufacturing. Lead
has no distinctive taste or smell. The chemical symbol for elemental lead is Pb. Lead is used to produce
batteries, pipes, roofing, scientific electronic equipment, military tracking systems, medical devices, and
products to shield X-rays and nuclear radiation. It is used in ceramic glazes and crystal glassware.
Because of health concerns, lead and lead compounds were banned from house paint in 1978; from
solder used on water pipes in 1986; from gasoline in 1995; from solder used on food cans in 1996; and

Environmental Biology 191

from tin-coated foil on wine bottles in 1996. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has set a limit on
the amount of lead that can be used in ceramics.
Lead and lead compounds are listed as “reasonably anticipated to be a human carcinogen”. It can
affect almost every organ and system in your body. It can be equally harmful if breathed or swallowed.
The part of the body most sensitive to lead exposure is the central nervous system, especially in children,
who are more vulnerable to lead poisoning than adults. A child who swallows large amounts of lead can
develop brain damage that can cause convulsions and death; the child can also develop blood anemia,
kidney damage, colic, and muscle weakness. Repeated low levels of exposure to lead can alter a child’s
normal mental and physical growth and result in learning or behavioral problems. Exposure to high
levels of lead for pregnant women can cause miscarriage, premature births, and smaller babies. Repeated
or chronic exposure can cause lead to accumulate in your body, leading to lead poisoning.
Formaldehyde is a colorless, flammable gas or liquid
that has a pungent, suffocating odor. It is a volatile organic
compound, which is an organic compound that easily
becomes a vapor or gas. It is also naturally produced in
small, harmless amounts in the human body. The primary
way we can be exposed to formaldehyde is by breathing air Figure 2. Nail products are known to contain
containing it. Releases of formaldehyde into the air occur toxic chemicals, such as dibutyl phthalate
from industries using or manufacturing formaldehyde, (DBP), toluene, and formaldehyde.
wood products (such as particle-board, plywood, and
furniture), automobile exhaust, cigarette smoke, paints and varnishes, and carpets and permanent press
fabrics. Nail polish, and commercially applied floor finish emit formaldehyde.
In general, indoor environments consistently have higher concentrations than outdoor environments,
because many building materials, consumer products, and fabrics emit formaldehyde. Levels of
formaldehyde measured in indoor air range from 0.02–4 parts per million (ppm). Formaldehyde levels
in outdoor air range from 0.001 to 0.02 ppm in urban areas.
Radiation
Radiation is energy given off by atoms and is all around us. We are exposed to radiation every day from
natural sources like soil, rocks, and the sun. We are also exposed to radiation from man-made sources
like medical X-rays and smoke detectors. We’re even exposed to low levels of radiation on cross-country
flights, from watching television, and even from some construction materials. You cannot see, smell or
taste radiation. Some types of radioactive materials are more dangerous than others. So it’s important to
carefully manage radiation and radioactive substances to protect health and the environment.
Radon is a radioactive gas that is naturally-occurring, colorless, and odorless. It comes from the
natural decay of uranium or thorium found in nearly all soils. It typically moves up through the ground
and into the home through cracks in floors, walls and foundations. It can also be released from building
materials or from well water. Radon breaks down quickly, giving off radioactive particles. Long-term
exposure to these particles can lead to lung cancer. Radon is the leading cause of lung cancer among
nonsmokers, according to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, and the second leading cause
behind smoking.

6.4 Bioremediation

Bioremediation is a waste management technique that involves the use of organisms such as plants,
bacteria, and fungi to remove or neutralize pollutants from a contaminated site. According to the United
States EPA, bioremediation is a “treatment that uses naturally occurring organisms to break down
hazardous substances into less toxic or non toxic substances”.
Bioremediation is widely used to treat human sewage and has also been used to remove agricultural
chemicals (pesticides and fertilizers) that leach from soil into groundwater. Certain toxic metals, such
as selenium and arsenic compounds, can also be removed from water by bioremediation. Mercury is
an example of a toxic metal that can be removed from an environment by bioremediation. Mercury is
an active ingredient of some pesticides and is also a byproduct of certain industries, such as battery
production. Mercury is usually present in very low concentrations in natural environments but it
is highly toxic because it accumulates in living tissues. Several species of bacteria can carry out
the biotransformation of toxic mercury into nontoxic forms. These bacteria, such as Pseudomonas
aeruginosa, can convert Hg2+ to Hg, which is less toxic to humans.
Probably one of the most useful and interesting examples of the use of prokaryotes for bioremediation
purposes is the cleanup of oil spills. The importance of prokaryotes to petroleum bioremediation has
been demonstrated in several oil spills in recent years, such as the Exxon Valdez spill in Alaska (1989)
(Figure 1), the Prestige oil spill in Spain (2002), the spill into the Mediterranean from a Lebanon power
plant (2006,) and more recently, the BP oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico (2010). To clean up these
spills, bioremediation is promoted by adding inorganic nutrients that help bacteria already present in
the environment to grow. Hydrocarbon-degrading bacteria feed on the hydrocarbons in the oil droplet,
breaking them into inorganic compounds. Some species, such as Alcanivorax borkumensis, produce
surfactants that solubilize the oil, while other bacteria degrade the oil into carbon dioxide. In the case
of oil spills in the ocean, ongoing, natural bioremediation tends to occur, inasmuch as there are oilconsuming bacteria in the ocean prior to the spill. Under ideal conditions, it has been reported that
up to 80 percent of the nonvolatile components in oil can be degraded within 1 year of the spill.
Researchers have genetically engineered other bacteria to consume petroleum products; indeed, the first
patent application for a bioremediation application in the U.S. was for a genetically modified oil-eating
bacterium.

Figure 1. Figure 1. (a) Cleaning up oil after the Valdez spill in Alaska, the workers hosed oil from beaches and then
used a floating boom to corral the oil, which was finally skimmed from the water surface. Some species of bacteria are
able to solubilize and degrade the oil. (b) One of the most catastrophic consequences of oil spills is the damage to
fauna. (credit a: modification of work by NOAA; credit b: modification of work by GOLUBENKOV, NGO: Saving
Taman)

There are a number of cost/efficiency advantages to bioremediation, which can be employed in
areas that are inaccessible without excavation. For example, hydrocarbon spills (specifically, oil spills)
or certain chlorinated solvents may contaminate groundwater, which can be easier to treat using
bioremediation than more conventional approaches. This is typically much less expensive than
excavation followed by disposal elsewhere, incineration, or other off-site treatment strategies. It also
reduces or eliminates the need for “pump and treat”, a practice common at sites where hydrocarbons
have contaminated clean groundwater. Using prokaryotes for bioremediation of hydrocarbons also has
the advantage of breaking down contaminants at the molecular level, as opposed to simply chemically
dispersing the contaminant.

6.5 Case Study: The Love Canal Disaster

One of the most famous and important examples of groundwater pollution in the U.S. is the Love Canal
tragedy in Niagara Falls, New York. It is important because the pollution disaster at Love Canal, along
with similar pollution calamities at that time (Times Beach, Missouri and Valley of Drums, Kentucky),
helped to create Superfund, a federal program instituted in 1980 and designed to identify and clean up
the worst of the hazardous chemical waste sites in the U.S.
Love Canal is a neighborhood in Niagara Falls
named after a large ditch (approximately 15 m wide,
3–12 m deep, and 1600 m long) that was dug in the
1890s for hydroelectric power. The ditch was
abandoned before it actually generated any power and
went mostly unused for decades, except for swimming
by local residents. In the 1920s Niagara Falls began
dumping urban waste into Love Canal, and in the
1940s the U.S. Army dumped waste from World War
II there, including waste from the frantic effort to build
a nuclear bomb. Hooker Chemical purchased the land
in 1942 and lined it with clay. Then, the company put
into Love Canal an estimated 21,000 tons of hazardous
chemical waste, including the carcinogens benzene,
dioxin, and PCBs in large metal barrels and covered
them with more clay. In 1953, Hooker sold the land to
the Niagara Falls school board for $1, and included a
clause in the sales contract that both described the land
use (filled with chemical waste) and absolved them
from any future damage claims from the buried waste.
The school board promptly built a public school on the
site and sold the surrounding land for a housing project
that built 200 or so homes along the canal banks and
another 1,000 in the neighborhood (Figure 1). During
construction, the canal’s clay cap and walls were Figure 1. Love Canal. Source: US Environmental
Protection Agency
breached, damaging some of the metal barrels.
Eventually, the chemical waste seeped into people’s
basements, and the metal barrels worked their way to the surface. Trees and gardens began to die; bicycle
tires and the rubber soles of children’s shoes disintegrated in noxious puddles. From the 1950s to the late
1970s, residents repeatedly complained of strange odors and substances that surfaced in their yards. City
officials investigated the area, but did not act to solve the problem. Local residents allegedly experienced
major health problems including high rates of miscarriages, birth defects, and chromosome damage, but
studies by the New York State Health Department disputed that. Finally, in 1978 President Carter
declared a state of emergency at Love Canal, making it the first human-caused environmental problem
to be designated that way. The Love Canal incident became a symbol of improperly stored chemical
waste. Clean up of Love Canal, which was funded by Superfund and completely finished in 2004,
195

196 Matthew R. Fisher, Editor

involved removing contaminated soil, installing drainage pipes to capture contaminated groundwater for
treatment, and covering it with clay and plastic. In 1995, Occidental Chemical (the modern name for
Hooker Chemical) paid $102 million to Superfund for cleanup and $27 million to Federal Emergency
Management Association for the relocation of more than 1,000 families. New York State paid $98
million to EPA and the US government paid $8 million for pollution by the Army. The total clean up
cost was estimated to be $275 million.
The Love Canal tragedy helped to create Superfund, which has analyzed tens of thousands of
hazardous waste sites in the U.S. and cleaned up hundreds of the worst ones. Nevertheless, over 1,000
major hazardous waste sites with a significant risk to human health or the environment are still in the
process of being cleaned.

6.6 Chapter Resources

Summary
Environmental health is concerned with preventing disease, death and disability by reducing exposure
to adverse environmental conditions and promoting behavioral change. It focuses on the direct and
indirect causes of diseases and injuries, and taps resources inside and outside the health care system to
help improve health outcomes. Environmental health risks can be grouped into two broad categories.
Traditional hazards related to poverty and lack of development affect developing countries and poor
people most. Modern hazards, caused by development that lacks environmental safeguards, such
as urban (outdoor) air pollution and exposure to agro-industrial chemicals and waste, prevail in
industrialized countries, where exposure to traditional hazards is low. Each year contaminated water
and poor sanitation contribute to 5.4 billion cases of diarrhea worldwide and 1.6 million deaths, mostly
among children under the age of five. Indoor air pollution—a much less publicized source of poor
health—is responsible for more than 1.6 million deaths per year and for 2.7 percent of global burden of
disease.
Emerging and reemerging diseases have been defined as infectious diseases of humans whose
occurrence during the past two decades has substantially increased or threatens to increase in the near
future relative to populations affected, geographic distribution, or magnitude of impacts. Antibiotic
resistance is a global problem. New forms of antibiotic resistance can cross international boundaries
and spread between continents. Environmental toxicology is the scientific study of the health effects
associated with exposure to toxic chemicals and systems occurring in the natural, work, and living
environments; the management of environmental toxins and toxicity; and the development of protections
for humans, animals, and plants. Environmental contaminants are chemicals found in the environment
in amounts higher than what would be there naturally. We can be exposed to these contaminants from a
variety of residential, commercial, and industrial sources.

7.1 Water Cycle and Fresh Water Supply

Water, air, and food are the most important natural resources to people. Humans can live only a few
minutes without oxygen, less than a week without water, and about a month without food. Water also is
essential for our oxygen and food supply. Plants breakdown water and use it to create oxygen during the
process of photosynthesis.
Water is the most essential compound for all living things. Human babies are approximately 75%
water and adults are 60% water. Our brain is about 85% water, blood and kidneys are 83% water,
muscles are 76% water, and even bones are 22% water. We constantly lose water by perspiration; in
temperate climates we should drink about 2 quarts of water per day and people in hot desert climates
should drink up to 10 quarts of water per day. Loss of 15% of body-water usually causes death.
Earth is truly the Water Planet. The abundance of liquid water on Earth’s surface distinguishes us from
other bodies in the solar system. About 70% of Earth’s surface is covered by oceans and approximately
half of Earth’s surface is obscured by clouds (also made of water) at any time. There is a very large
volume of water on our planet, about 1.4 billion cubic kilometers (km3) (330 million cubic miles) or
about 53 billion gallons per person on Earth. All of Earth’s water could cover the United States to a depth
of 145 km (90 mi). From a human perspective, the problem is that over 97% of it is seawater, which
is too salty to drink or use for irrigation. The most commonly used water sources are rivers and lakes,
which contain less than 0.01% of the world’s water!
One of the most important environmental goals is to provide clean water to all people. Fortunately,
water is a renewable resource and is difficult to destroy. Evaporation and precipitation combine to
replenish our fresh water supply constantly; however, water availability is complicated by its uneven
distribution over the Earth. Arid climate and densely populated areas have combined in many parts
of the world to create water shortages, which are projected to worsen in the coming years due to
population growth and climate change. Human activities such as water overuse and water pollution have
compounded significantly the water crisis that exists today. Hundreds of millions of people lack access
to safe drinking water, and billions of people lack access to improved sanitation as simple as a pit latrine.
As a result, nearly two million people die every year from diarrheal diseases and 90% of those deaths
occur among children under the age of 5. Most of these are easily prevented deaths.

Water Reservoirs and Water Cycle
Water is the only common substance that occurs naturally on earth in three forms: solid, liquid and
gas. It is distributed in various locations, called water reservoirs. The oceans are by far the largest of
the reservoirs with about 97% of all water but that water is too saline for most human uses (Figure
1). Ice caps and glaciers are the largest reservoirs of fresh water but this water is inconveniently located,
mostly in Antarctica and Greenland. Shallow groundwater is the largest reservoir of usable fresh water.
Although rivers and lakes are the most heavily used water resources, they represent only a tiny amount of
the world’s water. If all of world’s water was shrunk to the size of 1 gallon, then the total amount of fresh
water would be about 1/3 cup, and the amount of readily usable fresh water would be 2 tablespoons.

(editor), 1993, Water in Crisis: A Guide to the World’s Fresh Water Resources

The water (or hydrologic) cycle (that was covered in Chapter 3.2) shows the movement of water
through different reservoirs, which include oceans, atmosphere, glaciers, groundwater, lakes, rivers, and
biosphere. Solar energy and gravity drive the motion of water in the water cycle. Simply put, the water
cycle involves water moving from oceans, rivers, and lakes to the atmosphere by evaporation, forming
clouds. From clouds, it falls as precipitation (rain and snow) on both water and land. The water on land
can either return to the ocean by surface runoff, rivers, glaciers, and subsurface groundwater flow, or
return to the atmosphere by evaporation or transpiration (loss of water by plants to the atmosphere).

Environmental Biology 205

Earth’s surface. Source: United States Geological Survey

An important part of the water cycle is how water varies in salinity, which is the abundance of
dissolved ions in water. The saltwater in the oceans is highly saline, with about 35,000 mg of
dissolved ions per liter of seawater. Evaporation (where water changes from liquid to gas at ambient
temperatures) is a distillation process that produces nearly pure water with almost no dissolved ions.
As water vaporizes, it leaves the dissolved ions in the original liquid phase. Eventually, condensation
(where water changes from gas to liquid) forms clouds and sometimes precipitation (rain and snow).
After rainwater falls onto land, it dissolves minerals in rock and soil, which increases its salinity. Most
lakes, rivers, and near-surface groundwater have a relatively low salinity and are called freshwater. The
next several sections discuss important parts of the water cycle relative to fresh water resources.
Primary Fresh Water Resources: Precipitation
Precipitation levels are unevenly distributed around the globe, affecting fresh water availability (Figure
3). More precipitation falls near the equator, whereas less precipitation tends to fall near 30 degrees
north and south latitude, where the world’s largest deserts are located. These rainfall and climate patterns
are related to global wind circulation cells. The intense sunlight at the equator heats air, causing it to
rise and cool, which decreases the ability of the air mass to hold water vapor and results in frequent
rainstorms. Around 30 degrees north and south latitude, descending air conditions produce warmer air,
which increases its ability to hold water vapor and results in dry conditions. Both the dry air conditions

206 Matthew R. Fisher, Editor

and the warm temperatures of these latitude belts favor evaporation. Global precipitation and climate
patterns are also affected by the size of continents, major ocean currents, and mountains.

Figure 3. World Rainfall Map. The false-color map above shows the amount of rain that falls
around the world. Areas of high rainfall include Central and South America, western Africa, and
Southeast Asia. Since these areas receive so much rainfall, they are where most of the world’s
rainforests grow. Areas with very little rainfall usually turn into deserts. The desert areas include
North Africa, the Middle East, western North America, and Central Asia. Source: United States

Surface Water Resources: Rivers, Lakes, Glaciers

Environmental Biology 207

Flowing water from rain and melted snow on land enters river
channels by surface runoff (Figure 4) and groundwater seepage
(Figure 5). River discharge describes the volume of water moving
through a river channel over time (Figure 6). The relative
contributions of surface runoff vs. groundwater seepage to
river discharge depend on precipitation patterns, vegetation,
topography, land use, and soil characteristics. Soon after a heavy
rainstorm, river discharge increases due to surface runoff. The
steady normal flow of river water is mainly from groundwater that
discharges into the river. Gravity pulls river water downhill
toward the ocean. Along the way the moving water of a river can
erode soil particles and dissolve minerals. Groundwater also
contributes a large amount of the dissolved minerals in river water.
The geographic area drained by a river and its tributaries is called
a drainage basin or watershed. The Mississippi River drainage
basin includes approximately 40% of the U.S., a measure that
includes the smaller drainage basins, such as the Ohio River and
Figure 4. Surface Runoff Surface

runoff, part of overland flow in the

many cities around the world. Rivers that have had international
at Wikimedia Commons
disputes over water supply include the Colorado (Mexico, southwest
U.S.), Nile (Egypt, Ethiopia, Sudan), Euphrates (Iraq, Syria,
Turkey), Ganges (Bangladesh, India), and Jordan (Israel, Jordan, Syria).
In addition to rivers, lakes can also be an
excellent source of freshwater for human use.
They usually receive water from surface runoff
and groundwater discharge. They tend to be
short-lived on a geological time-scale
because they are constantly filling in with
sediment supplied by rivers. Lakes form in a
variety of ways including glaciation, recent
tectonic uplift (e.g., Lake Tanganyika, Africa),
and volcanic eruptions (e.g., Crater Lake,
Oregon). People also create artificial lakes
(reservoirs) by damming rivers. Large changes
in climate can result in major changes in a lake’s
size. As Earth was coming out of the last Ice Age Figure 5. Groundwater Seepage. Groundwater seepage
can be seen in Box Canyon in Idaho, where approximately
about 15,000 years ago, the climate in the 10 cubic meters per second of seepage emanates from its

warm and arid, which caused more than 100 large
lakes to disappear. The Great Salt Lake in Utah is a remnant of a much larger lake called Lake
Bonneville.

208 Matthew R. Fisher, Editor

Although glaciers represent the largest reservoir
of fresh water, they generally are not used as a
water source because they are located too far
from most people (Figure 7). Melting glaciers do
provide a natural source of river water and
groundwater. During the last Ice Age there was as
much as 50% more water in glaciers than there is
today, which caused sea level to be about 100 m
lower. Over the past century, sea level has been
rising in part due to melting glaciers. If
Earth’s climate continues to warm, the melting
glaciers will cause an additional rise in sea level.

Groundwater Resources
Although most people in the world use surface water,
groundwater is a much larger reservoir of usable
fresh water, containing more than 30 times more
water than rivers and lakes combined. Groundwater
is a particularly important resource in arid climates,
where surface water may be scarce. In addition,
groundwater is the primary water source for rural
homeowners, providing 98% of that water demand
in the U.S.. Groundwater is water located in small
spaces, called pore space, between mineral grains Figure 7. Mountain Glacier in Argentina Glaciers are
and fractures in subsurface earth materials (rock or the largest reservoir of fresh water but they are not
sediment). Most groundwater originates from rain or used much as a water resource directly by society
snowmelt, which infiltrates the ground and moves because of their distance from most people. Source:
downward until it reaches the saturated zone (where Luca Galuzzi – www.galuzzi.it
groundwater completely fills pore spaces in earth
materials).
Other sources of groundwater include seepage from surface water (lakes, rivers, reservoirs, and
swamps), surface water deliberately pumped into the ground, irrigation, and underground
wastewater treatment systems (septic tanks). Recharge areas are locations where surface water
infiltrates the ground rather than running into rivers or evaporating. Wetlands, for example, are excellent
recharge areas. A large area of sub-surface, porous rock that holds water is an aquifer. Aquifers are
commonly drilled, and wells installed, to provide water for agriculture and personal use.
Water Use in the U.S. and World
People need water, oftentimes large quantities, to produce the food, energy, and mineral resources
they use. Consider, for example, these approximate water requirements for some things people in
the developed world use every day: one tomato = 3 gallons; one kilowatt-hour of electricity from a

Environmental Biology 209

thermoelectric power plant = 21 gallons; one loaf of bread = 150 gallons; one pound of beef = 1,600
gallons; and one ton of steel = 63,000 gallons. Human beings require only about 1 gallon per day to
survive, but a typical person in a U.S. household uses approximately 100 gallons per day, which includes
cooking, washing dishes and clothes, flushing the toilet, and bathing. The water demand of an area is
a function of the population and other uses of water.

Global total water use is steadily increasing at a rate greater than world population growth (Figure
10). During the 20th century global population tripled and water demand grew by a factor of six. The
increase in global water demand beyond the rate of population growth is due to improved standard of
living without an offset by water conservation. Increased production of goods and energy entails a large
increase in water demand. The major global water uses are irrigation (68%), public supply (21%), and
industry (11%).

7.2 Water Supply Problems and Solutions

Water Supply Problems: Resource Depletion
As groundwater is pumped from water wells, there usually is a localized drop in the water table around
the well called a cone of depression. When there are a large number of wells that have been pumping
water for a long time, the regional water table can drop significantly. This is called groundwater
mining, which can force the drilling of deeper, more expensive wells that commonly encounter more
saline groundwater. Rivers, lakes, and artificial lakes (reservoirs) can also be depleted due to overuse.
Some large rivers, such as the Colorado in the U.S. and Yellow in China, run dry in some years. The
case history of the Aral Sea discussed later in this chapter involves depletion of a lake. Finally, glaciers
are being depleted due to accelerated melting associated with global warming over the past century.
Another water resource problem associated
with groundwater mining is saltwater intrusion,
where overpumping of fresh water aquifers near
ocean coastlines causes saltwater to enter fresh
water zones. The drop of the water table around
a cone of depression in an unconfined aquifer
can change the direction of regional groundwater
flow, which could send nearby pollution toward
the pumping well instead of away from it. Finally,
problems of subsidence (gradual sinking of the
land surface over a large area) and sinkholes
(rapid sinking of the land surface over a small
area) can develop due to a drop in the water table.
Water Supply Crisis

The water crisis refers to a global situation where people in many areas lack access to sufficient water,
clean water, or both. This section describes the global situation involving water shortages, also called
water stress. In general, water stress is greatest in areas with very low precipitation (major deserts),
large population density (e.g., India), or both. Future global warming could worsen the water crisis by
shifting precipitation patterns away from humid areas and by melting mountain glaciers that recharge
rivers downstream. Melting glaciers will also contribute to rising sea level, which will worsen saltwater
intrusion in aquifers near ocean coastlines.

213

Figure 2. Countries Facing Water Stress in 1995 and Projected in 2025 Water stress is defined as having a high
percentage of water withdrawal compared to total available water in the area. Source: Philippe Rekacewicz (Le
Monde diplomatique), February 2006

According to a 2006 report by the United Nations Development Programme, 700 million people (11% of
the world’s population) lived with water stress. Most of them live in the Middle East and North Africa.
By 2025, the report projects that more than 3 billion people (about 40% of the world’s population) will
live in water-stressed areas with the large increase coming mainly from China and India. The water crisis
will also impact food production and our ability to feed the ever-growing population. We can expect
future global tension and even conflict associated with water shortages and pollution. Historic and future
areas of water conflict include the Middle East (Euphrates and Tigris River conflict among Turkey,
Syria, and Iraq; Jordan River conflict among Israel, Lebanon, Jordan, and the Palestinian territories),
Africa (Nile River conflict among Egypt, Ethiopia, and Sudan), Central Asia (Aral Sea conflict among
Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, Turkmenistan, Tajikistan, and Kyrgyzstan), and south Asia (Ganges River
conflict between India and Pakistan).
Sustainable Solutions to the Water Supply Crisis?
The current and future water crisis described above requires multiple approaches to extending our
fresh water supply and moving towards sustainability. Some of the longstanding traditional approaches
include dams and aqueducts.

Environmental Biology 215

Reservoirs that form behind dams in rivers can collect water
during wet times and store it for use during dry spells. They also
can be used for urban water supplies. Other benefits of dams and
reservoirs are hydroelectricity, flood control, and recreation. Some
of the drawbacks are evaporative loss of water in arid climates,
downstream river channel erosion, and impact on the ecosystem
including a change from a river to lake habitat and interference
with migration and spawning of fish.
Aqueducts can move water from where it is plentiful to where
it is needed. Aqueducts can be controversial and
politically difficult especially if the water transfer distances are
large. One drawback is the water diversion can cause drought in
the area from where the water is drawn. For example, Owens Lake
and Mono Lake in central California began to disappear after their
river flow was diverted to the Los Angeles aqueduct. Owens
Lake remains almost completely dry, but Mono Lake has
recovered more significantly due to legal intervention.

One method that can actually increase the amount of
fresh water on Earth is desalination, which involves Figure 3. Hoover Dam, Nevada, U.S.

groundwater.

fresh water from conventional sources. In addition, the
process creates highly saline wastewater, which must be disposed of and creates
significant environmental impact. Desalination is most common in the Middle East,
where energy from oil is abundant but water is scarce.
Conservation means using less water and using it
more efficiently. Around the home, conservation
can involve both engineered features, such as highefficiency clothes washers and low-flow showers and
toilets, as well as behavioral decisions, such as growing
native vegetation that require little irrigation in desert
climates, turning off the water while you brush your
teeth, and fixing leaky faucets.
Rainwater
harvesting involves catching
and

Another important technique is efficient irrigation, David Jordan at en.wikipedia
which is extremely important because irrigation
accounts for a much larger water demand than public
water supply. Water conservation strategies in agriculture include growing crops in areas where the
natural rainfall can support them, more efficient irrigation systems such as drip systems that minimize
losses due to evaporation, no-till farming that reduces evaporative losses by covering the soil, and

reusing treated wastewater from sewage treatment plants. Recycled wastewater has also been used to
recharge aquifers.

7.3 Water Pollution

The global water crisis also involves water pollution. For water to be useful for drinking and irrigation,
it must not be polluted beyond certain thresholds. According to the World Health Organization, in 2008
approximately 880 million people in the world (or 13% of world population) did not have access to safe
drinking water. At the same time, about 2.6 billion people (or 40% of world population) lived without
improved sanitation, which is defined as having access to a public sewage system, septic tank, or even
a simple pit latrine. Each year approximately 1.7 million people die from diarrheal diseases associated
with unsafe drinking water, inadequate sanitation, and poor hygiene. Almost all of these deaths are in
developing countries, and around 90% of them occur among children under the age of 5 (Figure 1).
Compounding the water crisis is the issue of social justice; poor people more commonly lack clean water
and sanitation than wealthy people in similar areas. Globally, improving water safety, sanitation, and
hygiene could prevent up to 9% of all disease and 6% of all deaths.
In addition to the global waterborne disease crisis, chemical pollution from agriculture, industry,
cities, and mining threatens global water quality. Some chemical pollutants have serious and wellknown health effects, whereas many others have poorly known long-term health effects. In the U.S.
currently more than 40,000 water bodies fit the definition of “impaired” set by EPA, which means they
could neither support a healthy ecosystem nor meet water quality standards. In Gallup public polls
conducted over the past decade Americans consistently put water pollution and water supply as the top
environmental concerns over issues such as air pollution, deforestation, species extinction, and global
warming.

Figure 1. This work was created by the World Health Organization.

Any natural water contains dissolved chemicals, some of which are important human nutrients while
others can be harmful to human health. The concentration of a water pollutant is commonly given in very
small units such as parts per million (ppm) or even parts per billion (ppb). An arsenic concentration of
1 ppm means 1 part of arsenic per million parts of water. This is equivalent to one drop of arsenic in 50
liters of water. To give you a different perspective on appreciating small concentration units, converting
1 ppm to length units is 1 cm (0.4 in) in 10 km (6 miles) and converting 1 ppm to time units is 30
seconds in a year. Total dissolved solids (TDS) represent the total amount of dissolved material in water.
Average TDS values for rainwater, river water, and seawater are about 4 ppm, 120 ppm, and 35,000 ppm,
respectively.

Environmental Biology 219

Water Pollution Overview
Water pollution is the contamination of water by an
excess amount of a substance that can cause harm to human
beings and/or the ecosystem. The level of water pollution
depends on the abundance of the pollutant, the ecological
impact of the pollutant, and the use of the water. Pollutants
are derived from biological, chemical, or physical processes.
Although natural processes such as volcanic eruptions or
evaporation sometimes can cause water pollution, most
pollution is derived from human, land-based activities
(Figure 2). Water pollutants can move through different
water reservoirs, as the water carrying them progresses
through stages of the water cycle (Figure 3). Water
residence time (the average time that a water molecule
spends in a water reservoir) is very important to pollution
problems because it affects pollution potential. Water in
rivers has a relatively short residence time, so pollution
usually is there only briefly. Of course, pollution in rivers
may simply move to another reservoir, such as the ocean,
where it can cause further problems. Groundwater is
typically characterized by slow flow and longer residence
time, which can make groundwater pollution particularly
problematic. Finally, pollution residence time can be much
greater than the water residence time because a pollutant may
be taken up for a long time within the ecosystem or absorbed
onto sediment.

different water reservoirs of the water cycle. Source: U.S. Geological Survey

Pollutants enter water supplies from point
sources, which are readily identifiable and
relatively small locations, or nonpoint sources,
which are large and more diffuse areas. Point
sources of pollution include animal factory farms
(Figure 4) that raise a large number and high
density of livestock such as cows, pigs, and
chickens. Also, pipes included are pipes from a
factories or sewage treatment plants. Combined
sewer systems that have a single set of
underground pipes to collect both sewage and
storm water runoff from streets for wastewater
treatment can be major point sources of Figure 4. Large animal farms are often referred to as
pollutants. During heavy rain, storm water runoff concentrated feeding operations (CFOs). These farms are

and spilling untreated sewage directly into untreated animal waste may enter nearby waterbodies as

surface waters (Figure 5).
Nonpoint sources of pollution include
agricultural fields, cities, and abandoned mines. Rainfall runs over the land and through the ground,
picking up pollutants such as herbicides, pesticides, and fertilizer from agricultural fields and lawns; oil,
antifreeze, animal waste, and road salt from urban areas; and acid and toxic elements from abandoned
mines. Then, this pollution is carried into surface water bodies and groundwater. Nonpoint source
pollution, which is the leading cause of water pollution in the U.S., is usually much more difficult and

Environmental Biology 221

expensive to control than point source pollution because of its low concentration, multiple sources, and
much greater volume of water.

Figure 5. Combined Sewer System A combined sewer system is a possible major point source of water pollution
during heavy rain due to overflow of untreated sewage. During dry weather (and small storms), all flows are handled
by the publicly owned treatment works (POTW). During large storms, the relief structure allows some of the combined
stormwater and sewage to be discharged untreated to an adjacent water body. Source: U.S. Environmental Protection

Types of Water Pollutants
Oxygen-demanding waste is an extremely important pollutant to ecosystems. Most surface water in
contact with the atmosphere has a small amount of dissolved oxygen, which is needed by aquatic
organisms for cellular respiration. Bacteria decompose dead organic matter and remove dissolved
oxygen (O2) according to the following reaction:
organic matter+O2→CO2+H2O
Too much decaying organic matter in water is a pollutant because it removes oxygen from water,
which can kill fish, shellfish, and aquatic insects. The amount of oxygen used by aerobic (in the presence
of oxygen) bacterial decomposition of organic matter is called biochemical oxygen demand (BOD).
The major source of dead organic matter in many natural waters is sewage; grass and leaves are smaller
sources. An unpolluted water body with respect to BOD is a turbulent river that flows through a natural
forest. Turbulence continually brings water in contact with the atmosphere where the O2 content is
restored. The dissolved oxygen content in such a river ranges from 10 to 14 ppm O2, BOD is low, and
clean-water fish such as trout. A polluted water body with respect to oxygen is a stagnant deep lake in
an urban setting with a combined sewer system. This system favors a high input of dead organic carbon
from sewage overflows and limited chance for water circulation and contact with the atmosphere. In
such a lake, the dissolved O2 content is ≤5 ppm O2, BOD is high, and low O2-tolerant fish, such as carp
and catfish dominate.
Excessive plant nutrients, particularly nitrogen (N) and phosphorous (P), are pollutants closely related
to oxygen-demanding waste. Aquatic plants require about 15 nutrients for growth, most of which are
plentiful in water. N and P are called limiting nutrients, however, because they usually are present in

222 Matthew R. Fisher, Editor

water at low concentrations and therefore restrict the total amount of plant growth. This explains why
N and P are major ingredients in most fertilizer. High concentrations of N and P from human sources
(mostly agricultural and urban runoff including fertilizer, sewage, and phosphorus-based detergent)
can cause cultural eutrophication, which leads to the rapid growth of aquatic producers, particularly
algae. Thick mats of floating algae or rooted plants lead to a form of water pollution that damages the
ecosystem by clogging fish gills and blocking sunlight. A small percentage of algal species produce
toxins that can kill animals, including humans. Exponential growths of these algae are called harmful
algal blooms. When the prolific algal layer dies, it becomes oxygen-demanding waste, which can create
very low O2 concentrations in the water (< 2 ppm O2), a condition called hypoxia. This results in a dead
zone because it causes death from asphyxiation to organisms that are unable to leave that environment.
An estimated 50% of lakes in North America, Europe, and Asia are negatively impacted by cultural
eutrophication. In addition, the size and number of marine hypoxic zones have grown dramatically
over the past 50 years including a very large dead zone located offshore Louisiana in the Gulf of
Mexico. Cultural eutrophication and hypoxia are difficult to combat, because they are caused primarily
by nonpoint source pollution, which is difficult to regulate, and N and P, which are difficult to remove
from wastewater.
Pathogens are disease-causing microorganisms, e.g., viruses, bacteria, parasitic worms, and protozoa,
which cause a variety of intestinal diseases such as dysentery, typhoid fever, and cholera. Pathogens are
the major cause of the water pollution crisis discussed at the beginning of this section. Unfortunately
nearly a billion people around the world are exposed to waterborne pathogen pollution daily and around
1.5 million children mainly in underdeveloped countries die every year of waterborne diseases from
pathogens. Pathogens enter water primarily from human and animal fecal waste due to inadequate
sewage treatment. In many underdeveloped countries, sewage is discharged into local waters either
untreated or after only rudimentary treatment. In developed countries untreated sewage discharge can
occur from overflows of combined sewer systems, poorly managed livestock factory farms, and leaky
or broken sewage collection systems. Water with pathogens can be remediated by adding chlorine or
ozone, by boiling, or by treating the sewage in the first place.
Oil spills are another kind of organic pollution. Oil spills can result from supertanker accidents such
as the Exxon Valdez in 1989, which spilled 10 million gallons of oil into the rich ecosystem of coastal
Alaska and killed massive numbers of animals. The largest marine oil spill was the Deepwater Horizon
disaster, which began with a natural gas explosion (Figure 6) at an oil well 65 km offshore of Louisiana
and flowed for 3 months in 2010, releasing an estimated 200 million gallons of oil. The worst oil spill
ever occurred during the Persian Gulf war of 1991, when Iraq deliberately dumped approximately 200
million gallons of oil in offshore Kuwait and set more than 700 oil well fires that released enormous
clouds of smoke and acid rain for over nine months.

During an oil spill on water, oil floats to the surface
because it is less dense than water, and the lightest
hydrocarbons evaporate, decreasing the size of the
spill but polluting the air. Then, bacteria begin to
decompose the remaining oil, in a process that can
take many years. After several months only about
15% of the original volume may remain, but it is in
thick asphalt lumps, a form that is particularly harmful
to birds, fish, and shellfish. Cleanup operations can
include skimmer ships that vacuum oil from the water
surface (effective only for small spills),
controlled burning (works only in early stages before
the light, ignitable part evaporates but also pollutes
the air), dispersants (detergents that break up oil to
accelerate its decomposition, but some dispersants
may
be
toxic
to
the
ecosystem),
and bioremediation (adding microorganisms that
specialize in quickly decomposing oil, but this can

disrupt the natural ecosystem).
Toxic chemicals involve many different kinds and sources, primarily from industry and mining.
General kinds of toxic chemicals include hazardous chemicals and persistent organic pollutants that
include DDT (pesticide), dioxin (herbicide by-product), and PCBs (polychlorinated biphenyls, which
were used as a liquid insulator in electric transformers). Persistent organic pollutants (POPs) are longlived in the environment, biomagnify through the food chain, and can be toxic. Another category of
toxic chemicals includes radioactive materials such as cesium, iodine, uranium, and radon gas, which
can result in long-term exposure to radioactivity if it gets into the body. A final group of toxic chemicals
is heavy metals such as lead, mercury, arsenic, cadmium, and chromium, which can accumulate through
the food chain. Heavy metals are commonly produced by industry and at metallic ore mines. Arsenic
and mercury are discussed in more detail below.
Arsenic (As) has been famous as an agent of death for many centuries. Only recently have scientists
recognized that health problems can be caused by drinking small arsenic concentrations in water over
a long time. It enters the water supply naturally from weathering of arsenic-rich minerals and from
human activities such as coal burning and smelting of metallic ores. The worst case of arsenic poisoning
occurred in the densely populated impoverished country of Bangladesh, which had experienced
100,000s of deaths from diarrhea and cholera each year from drinking surface water contaminated with
pathogens due to improper sewage treatment. In the 1970s the United Nations provided aid for millions
of shallow water wells, which resulted in a dramatic drop in pathogenic diseases. Unfortunately, many
of the wells produced water naturally rich in arsenic. Tragically, there are an estimated 77 million people
(about half of the population) who inadvertently may have been exposed to toxic levels of arsenic in
Bangladesh as a result. The World Health Organization has called it the largest mass poisoning of a
population in history.
Mercury (Hg) is used in a variety of electrical products, such as dry cell batteries, fluorescent light
bulbs, and switches, as well as in the manufacture of paint, paper, vinyl chloride, and fungicides.
Mercury acts on the central nervous system and can cause loss of sight, feeling, and hearing as
well as nervousness, shakiness, and death. Like arsenic, mercury enters the water supply naturally
from weathering of mercury-rich minerals and from human activities such as coal burning and metal
processing. A famous mercury poisoning case in Minamata, Japan involved methylmercury-rich

224 Matthew R. Fisher, Editor

industrial discharge that caused high Hg levels in fish. People in the local fishing villages ate fish up
to three times per day for over 30 years, which resulted in over 2,000 deaths. During that time the
responsible company and national government did little to mitigate, help alleviate, or even acknowledge
the problem.
Hard water contains abundant calcium and magnesium, which reduces its ability to develop soapsuds
and enhances scale (calcium and magnesium carbonate minerals) formation on hot water equipment.
Water softeners remove calcium and magnesium, which allows the water to lather easily and resist scale
formation. Hard water develops naturally from the dissolution of calcium and magnesium carbonate
minerals in soil; it does not have negative health effects in people.
Groundwater pollution can occur from underground sources and all of the pollution sources that
contaminate surface waters. Common sources of groundwater pollution are leaking underground storage
tanks for fuel, septic tanks, agricultural activity, landfills, and fossil fuel extraction. Common
groundwater pollutants include nitrate, pesticides, volatile organic compounds, and petroleum products.
Another troublesome feature of groundwater pollution is that small amounts of certain pollutants, e.g.,
petroleum products and organic solvents, can contaminate large areas. In Denver, Colorado 80 liters
of several organic solvents contaminated 4.5 trillion liters of groundwater and produced a 5 km long
contaminant plume. A major threat to groundwater quality is from underground fuel storage tanks. Fuel
tanks commonly are stored underground at gas stations to reduce explosion hazards. Before 1988 in the
U.S. these storage tanks could be made of metal, which can corrode, leak, and quickly contaminate local
groundwater. Now, leak detectors are required and the metal storage tanks are supposed to be protected
from corrosion or replaced with fiberglass tanks. Currently there are around 600,000 underground fuel
storage tanks in the U.S. and over 30% still do not comply with EPA regulations regarding either release
prevention or leak detection.

7.4 Water Treatment

Resolution of the global water pollution crisis requires multiple approaches to improve the quality of
our fresh water and move towards sustainability. The most deadly form of water pollution, pathogenic
microorganisms that cause waterborne diseases, kills almost 2 million people in underdeveloped
countries every year. The best strategy for addressing this problem is proper sewage (wastewater)
treatment. Untreated sewage is not only a major cause of pathogenic diseases, but also a major source of
other pollutants, including oxygen-demanding waste, nutrients (N and P, particularly), and toxic heavy
metals. Wastewater treatment is done at a sewage treatment plant in urban areas and through a septic
tank system in rural areas.
The main purpose of sewage (wastewater) treatment is to remove organic matter (oxygendemanding waste) and kill bacteria. Special methods also can be used to remove nutrients and other
pollutants.
The
numerous
steps
at
a
conventional
sewage
treatment
plant
include pretreatment (screening and removal of sand and gravel), primary treatment (settling or
floatation to remove organic solids, fat, and grease), secondary treatment (aerobic bacterial
decomposition of organic solids), tertiary treatment (bacterial decomposition of nutrients and
filtration), disinfection (treatment with chlorine, ozone, ultraviolet light, or bleach to kill most
microbes), and either discharge to surface waters (usually a local river) or reuse for some other purpose,
such as irrigation, habitat preservation, and artificial groundwater recharge (Figure 1).
The concentrated organic solid produced during primary and secondary treatment is called sludge,
which is treated in a variety of ways including landfill disposal, incineration, use as fertilizer, and
anaerobic bacterial decomposition, which is done in the absence of oxygen. Anaerobic decomposition
of sludge produces methane gas, which can be used as an energy source. To reduce water pollution
problems, separate sewer systems (where street runoff goes to rivers and only wastewater goes to a
wastewater treatment plant) are much better than combined sewer systems, which can overflow and
release untreated sewage into surface waters during heavy rain. Some cities such as Chicago, Illinois
have constructed large underground caverns and also use abandoned rock quarries to hold storm sewer
overflow. After the rain stops, the stored water goes to the sewage treatment plant for processing.

A septic tank system is an individual sewage treatment system for homes in typically rural settings.
The basic components of a septic tank system (Figure 2) include a sewer line from the house, a septic
tank (a large container where sludge settles to the bottom and microorganisms decompose the organic
solids anaerobically), and the drain field (network of perforated pipes where the clarified water seeps
into the soil and is further purified by bacteria). Water pollution problems occur if the septic tank
malfunctions, which usually occurs when a system is established in the wrong type of soil or maintained
poorly.

Environmental Biology 227

For many developing countries, financial aid is
necessary to build adequate sewage treatment
facilities. The World Health Organization
estimates an estimated cost savings of between $3
and $34 for every $1 invested in clean water
delivery and sanitation. The cost savings are from
health care savings, gains in work and school
productivity, and prevented deaths. Simple and
inexpensive techniques for treating water at home
include chlorination, filters, and solar
disinfection. Another alternative is to
use constructed wetlands technology (marshes
built to treat contaminated water), which is
simpler and cheaper than a conventional sewage
treatment plant.
Bottled water is not a sustainable solution to
the water crisis. Bottled water is not necessarily
any safer than the U.S. public water supply, it
costs on average about 700 times more than U.S.
tap water, and every year it uses approximately
200 billion plastic and glass bottles that have a
relatively low rate of recycling. Compared to tap
water, it uses much more energy, mainly in bottle
manufacturing and long-distance transportation.
If you don’t like the taste of your tap water, then
please use a water filter instead of bottled water!

CLEAN WATER ACT
During the early 1900s rapid industrialization
in the U.S. resulted in widespread water pollution
due to free discharge of waste into surface waters.
The Cuyahoga River in northeast Ohio caught
fire numerous times, including a famous fire in
1969 that caught the nation’s attention. In 1972
Congress passed one of the most important
environmental laws in U.S. history, the Federal
Water Pollution Control Act, which is more
commonly called the Clean Water Act. The
purpose of the Clean Water Act and later
amendments is to maintain and restore water
quality, or in simpler terms to make our water

swimmable and fishable. It became illegal to

dump pollution into surface water unless there
was formal permission and U.S. water quality
improved significantly as a result. More progress is needed because currently the EPA considers over

228 Matthew R. Fisher, Editor

40,000 U.S. water bodies as impaired, most commonly due to pathogens, metals, plant nutrients,
and oxygen depletion. Another concern is protecting groundwater quality, which is not yet addressed
sufficiently by federal law.

The Aral Sea is a lake located east of the Caspian Sea between Uzbekistan and Kazakhstan in central
Asia. This area is part of the Turkestan desert, which is the fourth largest desert in the world; it is
produced from a rain shadow effect by Afghanistan’s high mountains to the south. Due to the arid and
seasonally hot climate there is extensive evaporation and limited surface waters in general. Summer
temperatures can reach 60οC (140οF)! The water supply to the Aral Sea is mainly from two rivers, the
Amu Darya and Syr Darya, which carry snow melt from mountainous areas. In the early 1960s, the thenSoviet Union diverted the Amu Darya and Syr Darya Rivers for irrigation of one of the driest parts of
Asia to produce rice, melons, cereals, and especially cotton. The Soviets wanted cotton or white gold
to become a major export. They were successful, and, today Uzbekistan is one of the world’s largest
exporters of cotton. Unfortunately, this action essentially eliminated any river inflow to the Aral Sea and
caused it to disappear almost completely.

229

230 Matthew R. Fisher, Editor

In 1960, Aral Sea was the fourth largest inland
water body; only the Caspian Sea, Lake Superior,
and Lake Victoria were larger. Since then, it has
progressively shrunk due to evaporation and lack
of recharge by rivers. Before 1965, the Aral Sea
received 2060 km3 of fresh water per year from
rivers and by the early 1980s it received none. By
2007, the Aral Sea shrank to about 10% of its
original size and its salinity increased from about
1% dissolved salt to about 10% dissolved salt,
which is 3 times more saline than seawater. These
changes
caused
an
enormous
environmental impact. A once thriving fishing
industry is dead as are the 24 species of fish that
used to live there; the fish could not adapt to the
more saline waters. The current shoreline is tens
of kilometers from former fishing towns and
commercial ports. Large shing boats lie in the
dried up lakebed of dust and salt. A frustrating Figure 2. Map of Aral Sea Area Map shows lake size in

increasing number of dust storms blow salt,
pesticides, and herbicides into nearby towns causing a variety of respiratory illnesses including
tuberculosis.
The wetlands of the two river deltas and their
associated ecosystems have disappeared. The
regional climate is drier and has greater
temperature extremes due to the absence of
moisture and moderating influence from the lake.
In 2003, some lake restoration work began on the
northern part of the Aral Sea and it provided
some relief by raising water levels and reducing
salinity somewhat. The southern part of the Aral
Sea has seen no relief and remains nearly
completely dry. The destruction of the Aral Sea is
one of the planet’s biggest environmental
disasters and it is caused entirely by humans.

lakes destroyed by unsustainable diversions
of river water. Other lakes that have shrunk significantly due to human diversions of water include the
Dead Sea in the Middle East, Lake Manchar in Pakistan, and Owens Lake and Mono Lake, both in
California.

Summary
Precipitation—a major control of fresh water availability—is unevenly distributed around the globe.
More precipitation falls near the equator, and landmasses there are characterized by a tropical rainforest
climate. Less precipitation tends to fall near 2030 north and south latitude, where the world’s largest
deserts are located. The water crisis refers to a global situation where people in many areas lack access to
sufficient water or clean water or both. The current and future water crisis requires multiple approaches
to extending our fresh water supply and moving towards sustainability. Some of the longstanding
traditional approaches include dams and aqueducts. Water pollution is the contamination of water by
an excess amount of a substance that can cause harm to human beings and the ecosystem. The level of
water pollution depends on the abundance of the pollutant, the ecological impact of the pollutant, and
the use of the water. The most deadly form of water pollution, pathogenic microorganisms that cause
waterborne diseases, kills almost 2 million people in underdeveloped countries every year. Resolution
of the global water pollution crisis requires multiple approaches to improve the quality of fresh water.
The best strategy for addressing this problem is proper sewage treatment. Untreated sewage is not only
a major cause of pathogenic diseases, but also a major source of other pollutants, including oxygendemanding waste, plant nutrients, and toxic heavy metals.

8.1 Food Security

Progress continues in the fight against hunger, yet an unacceptably large number of people lack the food
they need for an active and healthy life. The latest available estimates indicate that about 795 million
people in the world – just over one in nine –still go to bed hungry every night, and an even greater
number live in poverty (defined as living on less than $1.25 per day). Poverty—not food availability—is
the major driver of food insecurity. Improvements in agricultural productivity are necessary to increase
rural household incomes and access to available food but are insufficient to ensure food security.
Evidence indicates that poverty reduction and food security do not necessarily move in tandem. The
main problem is lack of economic (social and physical) access to food at national and household levels
and inadequate nutrition (or hidden hunger). Food security not only requires an adequate supply of food
but also entails availability, access, and utilization by all—people of all ages, gender, ethnicity, religion,
and socioeconomic levels.

From Agriculture to Food Security
Agriculture and food security are inextricably linked. The agricultural sector in each country is
dependent on the available natural resources, as well as the politics that govern those resources. Staple
food crops are the main source of dietary energy in the human diet and include things such as rice,
wheat, sweet potatoes, maize, and cassava.
Food security
Food security is essentially built on four pillars: availability, access, utilization and stability. An
individual must have access to sufficient food of the right dietary mix (quality) at all times to be food
secure. Those who never have sufficient quality food are chronically food insecure.
When food security is analyzed at the national level, an understanding not only of national production
is important, but also of the country’s access to food from the global market, its foreign exchange
earnings, and its citizens’ consumer choices. Food security analyzed at the household level is
conditioned by a household’s own food production and household members’ ability to purchase food
of the right quality and diversity in the market place. However, it is only at the individual level that
the analysis can be truly accurate because only through understanding who consumes what can we
appreciate the impact of sociocultural and gender inequalities on people’s ability to meet their nutritional
needs.The definition of food security is often applied at varying levels of aggregation, despite its
articulation at the individual level. The importance of a pillar depends on the level of aggregation being
addressed. At a global level, the important pillar is food availability. Does global agricultural activity
produce sufficient food to feed all the world’s inhabitants? The answer today is yes, but it may not be
true in the future given the impact of a growing world population, emerging plant and animal pests and
diseases, declining soil productivity and environmental quality, increasing use of land for fuel rather than
food, and lack of attention to agricultural research and development, among other factors.
The third pillar, food utilization, essentially translates the food available to a household into
239

240 Matthew R. Fisher, Editor

nutritional security for its members. One aspect of utilization is analyzed in terms of distribution
according to need. Nutritional standards exist for the actual nutritional needs of men, women, boys,
and girls of different ages and life phases (that is, pregnant women), but these “needs” are often
socially constructed based on culture. For example, in South Asia evidence shows that women eat
after everyone else has eaten and are less likely than men in the same household to consume preferred
foods such as meats and fish. Hidden hunger commonly results from poor food utilization: that is,
a person’s diet lacks the appropriate balance of macro- (calories) and micronutrients (vitamins and
minerals). Individuals may look well nourished and consume sufficient calories but be deficient in key
micronutrients such as vitamin A, iron, and iodine.
When food security is analyzed at the national level, an understanding not only of national production
is important, but also of the country’s access to food from the global market, its foreign exchange
earnings, and its citizens’ consumer choices. Food security analyzed at the household level is
conditioned by a household’s own food production and household members’ ability to purchase food
of the right quality and diversity in the market place. However, it is only at the individual level that
the analysis can be truly accurate because only through understanding who consumes what can we
appreciate the impact of sociocultural and gender inequalities on people’s ability to meet their nutritional
needs.
Food stability is when a population, household, or individual has access to food at all times and does
not risk losing access as a consequence of cyclical events, such as the dry season. When some lacks
food stability, they have malnutrition, a lack of essential nutrients. This is economically costly because
it can cost individuals 10 percent of their lifetime earnings and nations 2 to 3 percent of gross domestic
product (GDP) in the worst-affected countries (Alderman 2005). Achieving food security is even more
challenging in the context of HIV and AIDS. HIV affects people’s physical ability to produce and use
food, reallocating household labor, increasing the work burden on women, and preventing widows and
children from inheriting land and productive resources.
Obesity
Obesity means having too much body fat. It is not the same as overweight, which means weighing too
much. Obesity has become a significant global health challenge, yet is preventable and reversible. Over
the past 20 years, a global overweight/obesity epidemic has emerged, initially in industrial countries
and now increasingly in low- and middle-income countries, particularly in urban settings, resulting in
a triple burden of undernutrition, micronutrient deficiency, and overweight/obesity. There is significant
variation by region; some have very high rates of undernourishment and low rates of obesity, while in
other regions the opposite is true (Figure 1).

Environmental Biology 241

However, obesity has increased to the extent
that the number of overweight people now
exceeds the number of underweight people
worldwide. The economic cost of obesity has
been estimated at $2 trillion, accounting for about
5% of deaths worldwide. Almost 30% of the
world’s population, or 2.1 billion people, are
overweight or obese, 62% of whom live in
developing countries.
Obesity accounts for a growing level and share
of worldwide noncommunicable diseases,
including diabetes, heart disease, and certain
cancers that can reduce quality of life and Figure 1. Obesity and undernourishment by region.
increase public health costs of already underresourced developing countries. The number of
overweight children is projected to double by 2030. Driven primarily by increasing availability of
processed, affordable, and effectively marketed food, the global food system is falling short with rising
obesity and related poor health outcomes. Due to established health implications and rapid increase in
prevalence, obesity is now a recognized major global health challenge.

then became a plant physiologist at Cornell
University, would develop papaya plants genetically
engineered to resist the deadly virus. By the end of the
decade, the Hawaiian papaya industry and the
livelihoods of many farmers were saved thanks to the
free distribution of Dr. Gonsalves seeds.
The development of a new strain of crop is an
example of agricultural biotechnology: a range of
tools that include both traditional breeding techniques

biotechnology uses the tools of genetic engineering
developed over the last few decades. Genetic engineering is the name for the methods that scientists
use to introduce new traits to an organism. This process results in genetically modified organisms,
or GMO. For example, plants may be genetically engineered to produce characteristics to enhance the
growth or nutritional profile of food crops. GMO that are crop species are commonly called genetically
engineered crops, or GE crops for short

The History of Genetic Modification of Crops
Nearly all the fruits and vegetables found in your local market would not occur naturally. In fact, they
exist only because of human intervention that began thousands of years ago. Humans created the vast
majority of crop species by using traditional breeding practices on naturally-occurring, wild plants.
These practices rely upon selective breeding (human assisted-breeding of individuals with desirable
traits). Traditional breeding practices, although low-tech and simple to perform, have the practical
outcome of modifying an organism’s genetic information, thus producing new traits.
An interesting example is maize (corn). Biologists have discovered that maize was developed from a
wild plant called teosinte. Through traditional breeding practices, humans living thousands of years ago
in what is now Southern Mexico began selecting for desirable traits until they were able to transform
the plant into what is now known as maize. In doing so, they permanently (and unknowingly) altered
its genetic instructions, allowing for new traits to emerge. Considering this history, we might ask the
question: is there really such a thing as “non-GMO” maize?

Figure 2. A wild grass called teosinte was genetically modified through selective breeding to produce what is
now known as maize (corn). This process of transformation started thousands of years ago by indigenous
people of what is now Mexico. “This work” by Nicolle Rager Fuller, National Science Foundation is in
the Public Domain, CC0.

Environmental Biology 245

This history of genetic modification is common to nearly all
crop species. For example, cabbage, broccoli, Brussel sprouts,
cauliflower, and kale were all developed from a single species
of wild mustard plant (Figure 2). Wild nightshade was the
source of tomatoes, eggplant, tobacco, and potatoes, the latter
developed by humans 7,000 – 10,000 years ago in South
America.
Traditional Breeding v. Modern Genetic Engineering
To produce new traits in livestock, pets, crops, or other type of
organism, there almost always has to be an underlying change
in that organism’s genetic instructions. What many people
might not understand is that traditional breeding practices do, in
fact, result in permanent genetic changes and is therefore a type
of genetic modification. This misunderstanding may arise
because traditional breeding practices do not require Figure 3. Brassica oleracea is a plant in
sophisticated laboratory equipment or any knowledge of the mustard family and is known as wild
genetics, which some may see as a perquisite for genetic cabbage. From it were developed many
familar crops, such as cauliflower,

genetic information, but the magnitude of those changes varies BY-SA 4.0
amongst the two techniques (Figure 3). Traditional breeding
shuffles all of the genes between the two organisms being bred, which can number into the tens of
thousands (maize, for example, has 32,000 genes). When mixing such a large number of genes, the
results can be unpredictable. Modern genetic engineering is more precise in the sense that biologists can
modify just a single gene. Also, genetic engineering can introduce a gene between two distantly-related
species, such as inserting a bacterial gene into a plant. Such transfer might seem unusual, but it is not
without its equivalent in nature. In a process called horizontal gene transfer, DNA from one species
can be inserted into a different species. One recent study, for example, has found that humans contain
about 150 genes from other species, including bacteria.

Potential Benefits of Genetic Engineering
Enhanced nutrition
Advances in biotechnology may provide consumers
with foods that are nutritionally-enriched (Figure 4),
longer-lasting, or that contain lower levels of certain
naturally occurring toxins present in some food plants.
For example, developers are using biotechnology to try
to reduce saturated fats in cooking oils, reduce allergens
in foods, and increase disease-fighting nutrients in foods.
Biotechnology may also be used to conserve natural
resources, enable animals to more effectively use
nutrients present in feed, decrease nutrient runoff into
rivers and bays, and help meet the increasing world food
and land demands.
Cheaper and More Manageable Production

Figure 5. White rice and Golden rice. Genetically
engineered “Golden Rice” contains up to 35 μg
β-carotene per gram of rice, which could prevent
millions of cases of blindness worldwide.

Biotechnology may provide farmers with tools that can make production cheaper and more manageable.
For example, some biotechnology crops can be engineered to tolerate specific herbicides, which make
weed control simpler and more efficient. Other crops have been engineered to be resistant to specific
plant diseases and insect pests, which can make pest control more reliable and effective, and/or can
decrease the use of synthetic pesticides. These crop production options can help countries keep pace
with demands for food while reducing production costs.
Improved pest control
Biotechnology has helped to make both pest control and weed management safer and easier while
safeguarding crops against disease. For example, genetically engineered insect-resistant cotton has
allowed for a significant reduction in the use of persistent, synthetic pesticides that may contaminate
groundwater and the environment. In terms of improved weed control, herbicide-tolerant soybeans,
cotton, and corn enable the use of reduced-risk herbicides that break down more quickly in soil and are
non-toxic to wildlife and humans.

Potential Concerns about Genetically Engineered Crops
The complexity of ecological systems presents considerable challenges for experiments that assess the
risks and benefits of GE crops. Assessing such risks is difficult, because both natural and humanmodified systems are highly complex and fraught with uncertainties that may not be clarified until long
after an experimental introduction has been concluded. Critics of GE crops warn that their cultivation
should be carefully considered within broader ecosystems because of their potential benefits and hazards
to the environment.
In addition to environmental risks, some people are concerned about potential health risks of GE crops
because they feel that genetic modification alters the intrinsic properties, or essence, of an organism.
As discussed above, however, it is known that both traditional breeding practices and modern genetic
engineering produce permanent genetic modifications. Further, traditional breeding practices actually
have a larger and more unpredictable impact on a species’ genetics because of its comparably crude
nature. Considering this, it is wise that both new GE crops and traditionally produced crops should be
studied for potential human health risks.
To address these various concerns, the US National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and
Medicine (NASEM) published a comprehensive, 500-page report in 2016 that summarized the current
scientific knowledge regarding GE crops. The report, titled Genetically Engineered Crops: Experiences
and Prospects, reviewed more than 900 research articles, in addition to public comments and expert
testimony. Results from this seminal report, hereafter referred to as the “GE Crop Report” for brevity,
is shared in the various subsections below.

Environmental Biology 249

Interbreeding with Native Species
Through interbreeding, or hybridization, GE crops might share their genetically-modified DNA with
wild relatives. This could affect the genetics of those wild relatives and have unforeseen consequences
on their populations, and could even have implications for the larger ecosystem. For example, if a
gene engineered to confer herbicide resistance were to pass from a GE crop to a wild relative, it might
transform the wild species into a ‘super weed’ – a species that could not be controlled by herbicide. Its
rampant growth could then displace other wild species and the wildlife that depends on it, thus inflecting
ecological harm.
NASEM’s GE Crop Report did find some evidence of genetic transfer between GE crops and wild
relatives. However, there was no evidence of ecological harm from that transfer. Clearly, continued
monitoring, especially for newly-developed crops, is warranted.
Consumers Right to Choose
The International Federation of Organic Agriculture Movement has made stringent efforts to keep GE
crops out of organic production, yet some US organic farmers have found their corn (maize) crops,
including seeds, contain detectable levels of genetically engineered DNA. The organic movement is
firm in its opposition to any use of GE crops in agriculture, and organic standards explicitly prohibit
their use (however, keep in mind that even “organic” maize has incurred significant genetic modification
compared to its wild relative, teosinte). The farmers, whose seed is contaminated, have been under rigid
organic certification, which assures that they did not use any kind of genetically modified materials on
their farms.
Any trace of GE crops must have come from outside their production areas. While the exact origin
is unclear at this time, it is likely that the contamination has been caused by pollen drift from GE crop
fields in surrounding areas. However, the contamination may have also come from the seed supply.
Seed producers, who intended to supply GE crop-free seed, have also been confronted with genetic
contamination and cannot guarantee that their seed is 100% GE crop-free.
Long-Term Ecological Effects
An early study indicated the pollen from a particular type of genetically modified corn may be harmful
to the caterpillars of monarch butterflies, This type of corn, known as Bt corn, is genetically modified
to produce a bacterial protein that acts as an insecticide. This trait is favorable because it reduces the
amount of insecticides used by farmers. Pollen from Bt corn can be harmful to caterpillars, but only at
very high concentrations. These concentrations are seldom reached in nature and follow-up studies have
found the effect of Bt corn to be negligible.
NASEM’s GE Crop Report documents that the validity of that initial monarch study was questioned
by other scientists and this ultimately led to a large, multi-national study funded by the US and Canada.
They found that the vast majority of Bt corn grown did not represent a risk to monarchs. However, one
strain of Bt corn did, and it was consequently removed from the market.
The GE Crop Report also mentioned a separate threat to monarch: loss of milkweed, which is critical
to the butterfly’s lifecycle. Some GE crops are engineered to resist the herbicide glyphosate. Farmers
using these crops can spray their entire field with the herbicide, which kills milkweed but not their GE
crop. This can lower the amount of milkweed growing within the habitat range of monarchs. The report

250 Matthew R. Fisher, Editor

concluded that more studies are needed to quantify the actual impact this may be having on monarch
populations.
Human Health Risk
At least some of the genes used in GE crops may not have been used in the food supply before, so GM
foods may pose a potential risk for human health, such as producing new allergens. But this is also true
of crops generated by traditional breeding practices (because both produce genetic modifications and
thus new traits).
Like other ‘controversial’ scientific issues, the scientific consensus on GE crops is quite clear: they are
safe. The UN’s Food and Agriculture Organization has concluded that risks to human and animal health
from the use of GMOs are negligible. NASEM’s GE Crop Report found “no substantiated evidence of
a difference in risks to human health between current commercially available genetically engineered
(GE) crops and conventionally bred crops, nor did it find conclusive cause-and-effect evidence of
environmental problems from the GE crops.” The American Medical Association’s Council on Science
and Public Health, in 2012, stated that “Bioengineered foods have been consumed for close to 20 years,
and during that time, no overt consequences on human health have been reported and/or substantiated
in the peer-reviewed literature.” Similar statements have been made by the US National Resource
Council and the American Association for the Advancement of Science, which publishes the preeminent
scholarly journal, Science.
The potential of GE crops to be allergenic is one of the potential adverse health effects and it should
continue to be studied, especially because some scientific evidences indicates that animals fed GE
crops have been harmed. NASEM’s GE Crop Report concluded that when developing new crops, it
is the product that should be studied for potential health and environmental risks, not the process that
achieved that product. What this means is, because both traditional breeding practices and modern
genetic engineering produce new traits through genetic modification, they both present potential risks.
Thus, for the safety of the environment and human health, both should be adequately studied.
Intellectual Property Rights
Intellectual property rights are one of the important factors in the current debate on GE crops. GE
crops can be patented by Agri-businesses, which can lead to them controlling and potentially exploiting
agricultural markets. Some accuse companies, such as Monsanto, of allegedly controlling seed
production and pricing, much to the detriment of farmers. NASEM’s GE Crop Report recommends more
research into how the concentration of seed-markets by a few companies, and the subsequent reduction
of free market competition, may be affecting seed prices and farmers.
It should be noted that crops developed by traditional breeding can also be legally protected and
controlled in ways similar to GE crops. Jim Myers, from Oregon State University notes that “In all but
a few cases, all contemporary varieties developed by private breeders are [legally] protected, and most
public varieties are protected as well.”

Are GE Crops the Solution We Need?
Significant resources, both financial and intellectual, have been allocated to answering the question: are
GE crops safe? After many hundreds of scientific studies, the answer is yes. But a significant question

Environmental Biology 251

still remains: are they necessary? Certainly, such as in instances like Hawaii’s papaya, which were
threated with eradication due to an aggressive disease, genetic engineering was a quick and effective
solution that would have been extremely difficult, if not impossible, to solve using traditional breeding
practices.
However, in many cases, the early promises of GE crops – that they would improve nutritional quality
of foods, confer disease resistance, and provide unparalleled advances in crop yields – have largely failed
to come to fruition. NASEM’s GE Crop Report states that while GE crops have resulted in the reduction
of agricultural loss from pests, reduced pesticide use, and reduced rates of injury from insecticides for
farm workers, they have not increased the rate at which crop yields are advancing when compared to
non-GE crops. Additionally, while there are some notable exceptions like golden rice or virus-resistant
papayas, very few GE crops have been produced to increase nutritional capacity or to prevent plant
disease that can devastate a farmer’s income and reduce food security. The vast majority of GE crops are
developed for only two purposes: to introduce herbicide resistance or pest resistance.
Genetic engineering of crops represents in important tool in a world of rapidly changing climate and
a burgeoning human population, but as you will see in the next chapter, it is only one of many tools that
agriculturists can use to produce enough food for all humans while simultaneously working to conserve
the environment.

Summary
Progress continues in the fight against hunger, yet an unacceptably large number of people still lack the
food they need for an active and healthy life. About 795 million people in the world still go to bed hungry
every night, and an even greater number live in poverty. Poverty is the major driver of food insecurity.
Improvements in agricultural productivity are necessary to increase rural household incomes and access
to available food but are insufficient to ensure food security. Food security is essentially built on four
pillars: availability, access, utilization and stability. Women are crucial in the translation of the products
of a vibrant agriculture sector into food and nutritional security for their households. They are often the
farmers who cultivate food crops and produce commercial crops alongside the men in their households
as a source of income. Over the past 20 years, a global obesity epidemic has emerged. Due to established
health implications and rapid increase in prevalence, obesity is now a recognized major global health
challenge, and no national success stories in curbing its growth have so far been reported. Genetic
engineering is the name for methods that scientists use to introduce new traits or characteristics to an
organism. Advocates say that application of genetic engineering in agriculture has resulted in benefits to
farmers, producers, and consumers. Critics advise that the risks for the introduction of a GMO into each
new ecosystem need to be examined on a case-by-case basis, alongside appropriate risk management
measures.

9.1 Soil Profiles & Processes

What is Soil?
The word “soil” has been defined differently by different
scientific disciplines. In agriculture and horticulture, soil generally
refers to the medium for plant growth, typically material within the
upper meter or two (Figure 1). We will use this definition in this
chapter. Soil consists predominantly of mineral matter, but also
contains organic matter (humus) and living organisms. The pore
spaces between mineral grains are filled with varying proportions
of water and air.
In common usage, the term soil is sometimes restricted to only
the dark topsoil in which we plant our seeds or vegetables. In a
more broad definition, civil engineers use the term soil for any
unconsolidated (soft when wet) material that is not considered
bedrock. Under this definition, soil can be as much as several
hundred feet thick! Ancient soils, sometimes buried and preserved
in the subsurface, are referred to as paleosols (Figure 2) and reflect
past climatic and environmental conditions.

Importance of Soil
Soil is important to our society primarily because it provides the
foundation of agriculture and forestry. Of course, soil is also a
critical component for terrestrial ecosystems, and thus important
to animals, plants, fungi, and microorganisms.
Soil plays a role in nearly all biogeochemical cycles on the
Earth’s surface. Global cycling of key elements such as carbon
(C), nitrogen (N), sulfur (S), and phosphorous (P) all pass through
soil. In the hydrologic cycle, soil helps to mediate the flow of
precipitation from the surface into the groundwater.
Microorganisms living in soil can also be important components
of biogeochemical cycles through the action of decomposition and
other processes such as nitrogen fixation.

Soil Forming Factors

Profiles. A buried soil profile, or
paleosol (above geologist ‘s head),
represents soil development during the
last interglacial period. A modern soil
profile (Alfisol) occurs near the land
surface. Source: D. Grimley.

The fundamental factors that affect soil genesis can be categorized
into five elements: climate, organisms, relief, parent material, and
time. One could say that the relief, climate, and organisms dictate
the local soil environment and act together to cause weathering
and mixing of the soil parent material over time. As soil is formed
it often has distinct layers, which are formally described as
“horizons.” Upper horizons (labeled as the A and O horizons) are
richer in organic material and so are important in plant growth, while deeper layers (such as the B and C
horizons) retain more of the original features of the bedrock below (Figure 3).

Environmental Biology 259

Climate
The role of climate in soil development includes aspects of
temperature and precipitation. Soils in very cold areas with
permafrost conditions tend to be shallow and weakly
developed due to the short growing season. Organic rich
surface horizons are common in low-lying areas due to
limited decomposition. In warm, tropical soils, soils tend to
be thicker, with extensive leaching and mineral alteration. In
such climates, organic matter decomposition and chemical
weathering occur at an accelerated rate.
Organisms
Animals, plants, and microorganisms all have important
roles in soil development processes, in providing a supply of
organic matter, and/or in nutrient cycling. Worms, Figure 3. This images shows the different
nematodes, termites, ants, gophers, moles, etc. all cause horizons, or layers, in soil. This work by
Wilsonbiggs is licensed under CC BY-SA 4.0
considerable mixing of soil and help to blend soil, aerate and
lighten the soil by creating pores (which help store water
and air).
Plant life provides organic matter to soil and helps to recycle nutrients with uptake by roots in the
subsurface. The type of plant life that occurs in a given area, such as types of trees or grasses, depends
on the climate, along with parent material and soil type. With the annual dropping of leaves and needles,
trees tend to add organic matter to soil surfaces, helping to create a thin, organic-rich A or O horizon
over time. Grasses, on the other hand, have a considerable root and surface masses that add to the soil
each fall for annuals and short-lived perennials. For this reason, grassland soils have much thicker A
horizons with higher organic matter contents, and are more agriculturally productive than forest soils.
Relief (Topography and Drainage)
The local landscape can have a surprisingly strong effect on the soils that form on site. The local
topography (relief) can have important microclimatic effects as well as affecting rates of soil erosion.
In comparison to flat regions, areas with steep slopes overall have more soil erosion, more runoff of
rainwater, and less water infiltration, all of which lead to more limited soil development in very hilly or
mountainous areas. In the northern hemisphere, south-facing slopes are exposed to more direct sunlight
angles and are thus warmer and drier than north-facing slopes. The cooler, moister north-facing slopes
have a more dynamic plant community due to less evapotranspiration and, consequently, experience less
erosion because of plant rooting of soil and have thicker soil development.
Soil drainage affects organic matter accumulation and preservation, and local vegetation types. Welldrained soils, generally on hills or sideslopes, are more brownish or reddish due to conversion of ferrous
iron (Fe2+) to minerals with ferric (Fe3+) iron. More poorly drained soils, in lowland, alluvial plains
or upland depressions, tend more be more greyish, greenish-grey (gleyed), or dark colored, due to iron
reduction (to Fe2+) and accumulation and preservation of organic matter in areas tending towards anoxic.
Areas with poor drainage also tend to be lowlands into which soil material may wash and accumulate

260 Matthew R. Fisher, Editor

from surrounding uplands, often resulting in overthickened A or O horizons. In contrast, steeply sloping
areas in highlands may experience erosion and have thinner surface horizons.
Parent Material
The parent material of a soil is the material from which the soil has developed, whether it be river
sands, shoreline deposits, glacial deposits, or various types of bedrock. In youthful soils, the parent
material has a clear connection to the soil type and has significant influence. Over time, as weathering
processes deepen, mix, and alter the soil, the parent material becomes less recognizable as chemical,
physical, and biological processes take their effect. The type of parent material may also affect the
rapidity of soil development. Parent materials that are highly weatherable (such as volcanic ash) will
transform more quickly into highly developed soils, whereas parent materials that are quartz-rich, for
example, will take longer to develop. Parent materials also provide nutrients to plants and can affect soil
internal drainage (e.g. clay is more impermeable than sand and impedes drainage).
Time
In general, soil profiles tend to become thicker (deeper), more developed, and more altered over time.
However, the rate of change is greater for soils in youthful stages of development. The degree of soil
alteration and deepening slows with time and at some point, after tens or hundreds of thousands of years,
may approach an equilibrium condition where erosion and deepening (removals and additions) become
balanced. Young soils (< 10,000 years old) are strongly influenced by parent material and typically
develop horizons and character rapidly. Moderate age soils (roughly 10,000 to 500,000 years old) are
slowing in profile development and deepening, and may begin to approach equilibrium conditions. Old
soils (>500,000 years old) have generally reached their limit as far as soil horizonation and physical
structure, but may continue to alter chemically or mineralogically.
Soil development is not always continual. Geologic events can rapidly bury soils (landslides, glacier
advance, lake transgression), can cause removal or truncation of soils (rivers, shorelines) or can cause
soil renewal with additions of slowly deposited sediment that add to the soil (wind or floodplain
deposits). Biological mixing can sometimes cause soil regression, a reversal or bump in the road for the
normal path of increasing development over time.

9.2 Soil-Plant Interactions

Soil plays a key role in plant growth. Beneficial aspects to plants include providing physical support,
water, heat, nutrients, and oxygen (Figure 1). Mineral nutrients from the soil can dissolve in water and
then become available to plants. Although many aspects of soil are beneficial to plants, excessively high
levels of trace metals (either naturally occurring or anthropogenically added) or applied herbicides can
be toxic to some plants.
The ratio of solids/water/air in soil is also
critically important to plants for proper
oxygenation levels and water availability. Too
much porosity with air space, such as in sandy or
gravelly soils, can lead to less available water to
plants, especially during dry seasons when the
water table is low. Too much water, in poorly
drained regions, can lead to anoxic conditions in
the soil, which may be toxic to some plants.

Nutrient Uptake by Plants
Several elements obtained from soil are
considered essential for plant growth.
Figure 1. Soil-Plant Nutrient Cycle. This figure illustrates
Macronutrients, including C, H, O, N, P, K, Ca, the uptake of nutrients by plants in the forest-soil
Mg, and S, are needed by plants in significant ecosystem. Source: U.S. Geological Survey.
quantities. C, H, and O are mainly obtained from
the atmosphere or from rainwater. These three elements are the main components of most organic
compounds, such as proteins, lipids, carbohydrates, and nucleic acids. The other six elements (N, P, K,
Ca, Mg, and S) are obtained by plant roots from the soil and are variously used for protein synthesis,
chlorophyll synthesis, energy transfer, cell division, enzyme reactions, and homeostasis (the process
regulating the conditions within an organism).
Micronutrients are essential elements that are needed only in small quantities, but can still be limiting
to plant growth since these nutrients are not so abundant in nature. Micronutrients include iron (Fe),
manganese (Mn), boron (B), molybdenum (Mo), chlorine (Cl), zinc (Zn), and copper (Cu). There are
some other elements that tend to aid plant growth but are not absolutely essential.
Micronutrients and macronutrients are desirable in particular concentrations and can be detrimental
to plant growth when concentrations in soil solution are either too low (limiting) or too high (toxicity).
Mineral nutrients are useful to plants only if they are in an extractable form in soil solutions, such as
a dissolved ion rather than in solid mineral. Many nutrients move through the soil and into the root
system as a result of concentration gradients, moving by diffusion from high to low concentrations.
However, some nutrients are selectively absorbed by the root membranes, enabling concentrations to
become higher inside the plant than in the soil.

9.3 Conventional Agriculture

The prevailing agricultural system, variously called “conventional farming,” “modern agriculture,” or
“industrial farming,” has delivered tremendous gains in productivity and efficiency. Food production
worldwide has risen in the past 50 years; the World Bank estimates that between 70 percent and 90
percent of the recent increases in food production are the result of conventional agriculture rather than
greater acreage under cultivation. U.S. consumers have come to expect abundant and inexpensive food.
Conventional farming systems vary from farm
to farm and from country to country. However,
they share many characteristics such as rapid
technological
innovation,
large
capital
investments in equipment and technology, largescale farms, single crops (monocultures);
uniform high-yield hybrid crops, dependency on
agribusiness, mechanization of farm work, and
extensive use of pesticides, fertilizers, and
herbicides. In the case of livestock, most
production comes from systems where animals
are highly concentrated and confined.
Both positive and negative consequences have
come with the bounty associated with industrial

Agriculture profoundly affects many ecological systems. Negative effects of current practices include
the following:
Decline in soil productivity can be due to wind and water erosion of exposed topsoil, soil compaction,
loss of soil organic matter, water holding capacity, and biological activity; and salinization (increased
salinity) of soils in highly-irrigated farming areas. Converting land to desert (desertification) can be
caused by overgrazing of livestock and is a growing problem, especially in parts of Africa.
Agricultural practices have been found to contribute to non-point source water pollutants that include
salts, fertilizers (nitrates and phosphorus, especially), pesticides, and herbicides. Pesticides from every
chemical class have been detected in groundwater and are commonly found in groundwater beneath
agricultural areas. They are also widespread in the nation’s surface waters. Eutrophication and “dead
zones” due to nutrient runoff affect many rivers, lakes, and oceans. Reduced water quality impacts
agricultural production, drinking water supplies, and fishery production. Water scarcity (discussed in the
previous chapter) in many places is due to overuse of surface and ground water for irrigation with little
concern for the natural cycle that maintains stable water availability.
Other environmental ills include over 400 insects and mite pests and more than 70 fungal pathogens
that have become resistant to one or more pesticides. Pesticides have also placed stresses on pollinators
and other beneficial insect species. This, along with habitat loss due to converting wildlands into
263

264 Matthew R. Fisher, Editor

agricultural fields, has affected entire ecosystems (such as the practice of converting tropical rainforests
into grasslands for raising cattle).
Agriculture’s link to global climate change is just beginning to be appreciated. Destruction of tropical
forests and other native vegetation for agricultural production has a role in elevated levels of carbon
dioxide and other greenhouse gases. Recent studies have found that soils may be large reservoirs of
carbon.
Economic and Social Concerns
Economically, the U.S. agricultural sector includes a history of increasingly large federal expenditures.
Also observed is a widening disparity among the income of farmers and the escalating concentration
of agribusiness—industries involved with manufacture, processing, and distribution of farm
products—into fewer and fewer hands. Market competition is limited and farmers have little control over
prices of their goods, and they continue to receive a smaller and smaller portion of consumer dollars
spent on agricultural products.
Economic pressures have led to a tremendous loss to the number of farms, particularly small farms,
and farmers during the past few decades. More than 155,000 farms were lost from 1987 to 1997.
Economically, it is very difficult for potential farmers to enter the business today because of the high
cost of doing business. Productive farmland also has been swallowed up by urban and suburban
sprawl—since 1970, over 30 million acres have been lost to development.
Impacts on Human Health
Many potential health hazards are tied to farming practices. The general public may be affected by
the sub-therapeutic use of antibiotics in animal production and the contamination of food and water by
pesticides and nitrates. These are areas of active research to determine the levels of risk. The health of
farm workers is also of concern, as their risk of exposure is much higher.
Philosophical Considerations
Historically, farming played an important role in our development and identity as a nation. From strongly
agrarian roots, we have evolved into a culture with few farmers. Less than two percent of Americans
now produce food for all U.S. citizens. Can sustainable and equitable food production be established
when most consumers have so little connection to the natural processes that produce their food? What
intrinsically American values have changed and will change with the decline of rural life and farmland
ownership?
World population continues to grow. According to recent United Nations population projections, the
world population will grow to 9.7 billion in 2050 and 11.2 billion in 2100. The rate of population
increase is especially high in many developing countries. In these countries, the population factor,
combined with rapid industrialization, poverty, political instability, and large food imports and debt
burden, make long-term food security especially urgent.

9.4 Pests & Pesticides

Pests and Pesticides
Pests are organisms that occur where they are not wanted or that cause damage to crops or humans or
other animals. Thus, the term “pest” is a highly subjective term. A pesticide is a term for any substance
intended for preventing, destroying, repelling, or mitigating any pest. Though often misunderstood
to refer only to insecticides, the term pesticide also applies to herbicides, fungicides, and various
other substances used to control pests. By their very nature, most pesticides create some risk of
harm—pesticides can cause harm to humans, animals, and/or the environment because they are designed
to kill or otherwise adversely affect living things. At the same time, pesticides are useful to society
because they can kill potential disease-causing organisms and control insects, weeds, worms, and fungi.
Pest Control is a Common Tool

Figure 1. The cotton boll weevil is considered
a major pest because of the damage it does to
cotton plants. This work by Jimmy Smith is
licensed under CC BY-NC-ND 4.0.

The management of pests is an essential part of agriculture,
public health, and maintenance of power lines and roads.
Chemical pest management has helped to reduce losses in
agriculture and to limit human exposure to disease vectors,
such as mosquitoes, saving many lives. Chemical pesticides
can be effective, fast acting, adaptable to all crops and
situations. When first applied, pesticides can result in
impressive production gains of crops. However, despite
these initial gains, excessive use of pesticides can be
ecologically unsound, leading to the destruction of natural
enemies, the increase of pesticide resistance, and outbreaks

of secondary pests.
These consequences have often resulted in higher production costs as well as environmental and
human health costs– side-effects which have been unevenly distributed. Despite the fact that the
lion’s share of chemical pesticides are applied in developed countries, 99 percent of all pesticide
poisoning cases occur in developing countries where regulatory, health and education systems are
weakest. Many farmers in developing countries overuse pesticides and do not take proper safety
precautions because they do not understand the risks and fear smaller harvests. Making matters worse,
developing countries seldom have strong regulatory systems for dangerous chemicals; pesticides banned
or restricted in industrialized countries are used widely in developing countries. Farmers’ perceptions
of appropriate pesticide use vary by setting and culture. Prolonged exposure to pesticides has been
associated with several chronic and acute health effects like non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma, leukemia, as
well as cardiopulmonary disorders, neurological and hematological symptoms, and skin diseases.

BOX 1. HUMAN HEALTH, ENVIRONMENTAL, AND ECONOMIC EFFECTS OF PESTICIDE USE
IN POTATO PRODUCTION IN ECUADOR
The International Potato Center (CIP) conducted an interdisciplinary and inter-institutional research
intervention project dealing with pesticide impacts on agricultural production, human health, and the
environment in Carchi, Ecuador. Carchi is the most important potato-growing area in Ecuador, where
smallholder farmers dominate production. They use tremendous amounts of pesticides for the control of the
Andean potato weevil and the late blight fungus. Virtually all farmers apply class 1b highly toxic pesticides
using hand pump backpack sprayers.
The study found that the health problems caused by pesticides are severe and are affecting a high
percentage of the rural population. Despite the existence of technology and policy solutions, government policies
continue to promote the use of pesticides. The study conclusions concurred with those by the pesticide industry,
“that any company that could not ensure the safe use of highly toxic pesticides should remove them from the
market and that it is almost impossible to achieve safe use of highly toxic pesticides among small farmers in
developing countries.”
Source: Yanggen et al. 2003.

POPs
Persistent organic pollutants (POPs) are a group of organic chemicals, such as DDT, that have been
widely used as pesticides or industrial chemicals and pose risks to human health and ecosystems. POPs
have been produced and released into the environment by human activity. They have the following three
characteristics:
Persistent: POPs are chemicals that last a long time in the environment. Some may resist breakdown
for years and even decades while others could potentially break down into other toxic substances.
Bioaccumulative: POPs can accumulate in animals and humans, usually in fatty tissues and largely
from the food they consume. As these compounds move up the food chain, they concentrate to levels
that could be thousands of times higher than acceptable limits.
Toxic: POPs can cause a wide range of health effects in humans, wildlife and fish. They have been
linked to effects on the nervous system, reproductive and developmental problems, suppression of the
immune system, cancer, and endocrine disruption. The deliberate production and use of most POPs has
been banned around the world, with some exemptions made for human health considerations (e.g., DDT
for malaria control) and/or in very specific cases where alternative chemicals have not been identified.
However, the unintended production and/or the current use of some POPs continue to be an issue of
global concern. Even though most POPs have not been manufactured or used for decades, they continue
to be present in the environment and thus potentially harmful. The same properties that originally made
them so effective, particularly their stability, make them difficult to eradicate from the environment.
POPs and Health

The relationship between exposure to environmental contaminants such as POPs and human health is
complex. There is mounting evidence that these persistent, bioaccumulative and toxic chemicals (PBTs)
cause long-term harm to human health and the environment. Drawing a direct link, however, between
exposure to these chemicals and health effects is complicated, particularly since humans are exposed on
a daily basis to many different environmental contaminants through the air they breathe, the water they
drink, and the food they eat. Numerous studies link POPs with a number of adverse effects in humans.
These include effects on the nervous system, problems related to reproduction and development, cancer,

Environmental Biology 267

and genetic impacts. Moreover, there is mounting public concern over the environmental contaminants
that mimic hormones in the human body (endocrine disruptors).
As with humans, animals are exposed to POPs in the environment through air, water and food. POPs
can remain in sediments for years, where bottom-dwelling creatures consume them and who are then
eaten by larger fish. Because tissue concentrations can increase or biomagnify at each level of the food
chain, top predators (like largemouth bass or walleye) may have a million times greater concentrations
of POPs than the water itself. The animals most exposed to PBT contaminants are those higher up the
food web such as marine mammals including whales, seals, polar bears, and birds of prey in addition to
fish species such as tuna, swordfish and bass (Figure 2). Once POPs are released into the environment,
they may be transported within a specific region and across international boundaries transferring among
air, water, and land.

Figure 2. Bioaccumulation and biomagnification. U.S. EPA. Great Lakes: The Great Lakes Atlas: Chapter Four the
Great Lakes Today – Concerns. January 2009

“Grasshopper Effect”
While generally banned or restricted, POPs
make their way into and throughout the
environment on a daily basis through a cycle of
long-range air transport and deposition called the
“grasshopper
effect.”The
“grasshopper”
processes, illustrated in Figure 3, begin with the
release of POPs into the environment. When
POPs enter the atmosphere, they can be carried
with wind currents, sometimes for long distances.

Figure 3. How POPs move throughout the environment.

Environment Bulletin. May/June 1998

Through atmospheric processes, they are
deposited onto land or into water ecosystems
where they accumulate and potentially cause
damage. From these ecosystems, they evaporate, again entering the atmosphere, typically traveling from
warmer temperatures toward cooler regions. They condense out of the atmosphere whenever the
temperature drops, eventually reaching highest concentrations in circumpolar countries. Through these

268 Matthew R. Fisher, Editor

processes, POPs can move thousands of kilometers from their original source of release in a cycle that
may last decades.

9.5 Sustainable Agriculture

“Sustainable agriculture” was addressed by Congress in the 1990 “Farm Bill”. Under that law, “the
term sustainable agriculture means an integrated system of plant and animal production practices having
a site-specific application that will, over the long term:
• satisfy human food and fiber needs;
• enhance environmental quality and the natural resource base upon which the agricultural
economy depends;
• make the most efficient use of nonrenewable resources and on-farm resources and integrate,
where appropriate, natural biological cycles and controls;
• sustain the economic viability of farm operations; and
• enhance the quality of life for farmers and society as a whole.”

Organic Farming is Good for Farmers, Consumers and the Environment
Organic agriculture is an ecological production management system that promotes and enhances
biodiversity, biological cycles and soil biological activity. Organic food is produced by farmers who
emphasize the use of renewable resources and the conservation of soil and water to enhance
environmental quality for future generations. Organic meat, poultry, eggs, and dairy products come from
animals that are given no antibiotics or growth hormones. Organic food is produced without using most
conventional pesticides, fertilizers made with synthetic ingredients or sewage sludge, or GMOs.
Organic production, with the corresponding practices to maintain soil fertility and soil health is
therefore a more benign alternative to conventional, high-value horticulture. The organic food movement
has been endorsed by the UN’s Food and Agricultural Organization, which maintains in a 2007 report
that organic farming fights hunger, tackles climate change, and is good for farmers, consumers, and the
environment. The strongest benefits of organic agriculture are its use of resources that are independent
of fossil fuels, are locally available, incur minimal environmental stresses, and are cost effective.
IPM is a Combination of Common-Sense Practices
Integrated Pest Management (IPM) refers to a mix of farmer-driven, ecologically-based pest control
practices that seeks to reduce reliance on synthetic chemical pesticides. It involves (a) managing pests
(keeping them below economically damaging levels) rather than seeking to eradicate them; (b) relying,
to the extent possible, on non-chemical measures to keep pest populations low; and (c) selecting and
applying pesticides, when they have to be used, in a way that minimizes adverse effects on beneficial
organisms, humans, and the environment. It is commonly understood that applying an IPM approach
does not necessarily mean eliminating pesticide use, although this is often the case because pesticides
are often over-used for a variety of reasons.
The IPM approach regards pesticides as mainly short-term corrective measures when more
269

270 Matthew R. Fisher, Editor

ecologically based control measures are not working adequately (sometimes referred to as using
pesticides as the “last resort”). In those cases when pesticides are used, they should be selected and
applied in such a manner as to minimize the amount of disruption that they cause to the environment,
such as using products that are non-persistent and applying them in the most targeted way possible).
Biological Control

Biological control (biocontrol) is the use of one
biological species to reduce populations of a different
species. There has been a substantial increase in
commercialization of biocontrol products, such as beneficial
insects, cultivated predators and natural or non-toxic pest
control products. Biocontrol is being mainstreamed to major
agricultural commodities, such as cotton, corn and most
commonly vegetable crops. Biocontrol is also slowly
emerging in vector control in public health and in areas that
for a long time mainly focused on chemical vector control
in

programs.

cases, the idea is not to completely destroy the pathogen or
pest, but rather to reduce the damage below economically significant values.
Intercropping Promotes Plant Interactions

Figure 2. Intercropping alyssum (the flowering
plants shown center left) with organic romaine
lettuce for aphid control.

Intercropping means growing two or more crops in
close proximity to each other during part or all of their
life cycles to promote soil improvement, biodiversity,
and pest management. Incorporating intercropping
principles into an agricultural operation increases
diversity and interaction between plants, arthropods,
mammals, birds and microorganisms resulting in a
more stable crop-ecosystem and a more efficient use of
space, water, sunlight, and nutrients (Figure 2). This
collaborative type of crop management mimics nature
and is subject to fewer pest outbreaks, improved
nutrient cycling and crop nutrient uptake, and increased
water infiltration and moisture retention. Soil quality,
water quality and wildlife habitat all benefit.

Environmental Biology 271

Organic Farming Practices Reduce Unnecessary Input Use

In modern agricultural practices, heavy machinery is used to prepare the seedbed for planting, to control
weeds, and to harvest the crop. The use of heavy equipment has many advantages in saving time and
labor, but can cause compaction of soil and disruption of the natural soil organisms. The problem with
soil compaction is that increased soil density limits root penetration depth and may inhibit proper plant
growth.
Alternative practices generally encourage minimal tillage or no tillage methods. With proper
planning, this can simultaneously limit compaction, protect soil organisms, reduce costs (if performed
correctly), promote water infiltration, and help to prevent topsoil erosion (Figure 3).
Tillage of fields does help to break up clods that
were previously compacted, so best practices may
vary at sites with different soil textures and
composition. Another aspect of soil tillage is that
it may lead to more rapid decomposition of organic
matter due to greater soil aeration. Over large areas
of farmland, this has the unintended consequence
of releasing more carbon and nitrous oxides
(greenhouse gases) into the atmosphere, thereby
contributing to global warming effects. In no-till
farming, carbon can actually become sequestered
into the soil. Thus, no-till farming may be Figure 3. Farmers should consider no-till farming as the
advantageous to sustainability issues on the local most important tool to prevent loss of soil moisture.
scale and the global scale. No-till systems of
conservation farming have proved a major success in Latin America and are being used in South Asia
and Africa.
Crop Rotation

Crop rotations are planned sequences of crops over time on the same field. Rotating crops provides
productivity benefits by improving soil nutrient levels and breaking crop pest cycles. Farmers may also
choose to rotate crops in order to reduce their production risk through diversification or to manage scarce
resources, such as labor, during planting and harvesting timing. This strategy reduces the pesticide costs
by naturally breaking the cycle of weeds, insects and diseases. Also, grass and legumes in a rotation
protect water quality by preventing excess nutrients or chemicals from entering water supplies.

BOX 2. AN ALTERNATIVE TO SPRAYING: BOLLWORM CONTROL IN SHANDONG
Farmers in Shandong (China) have been using innovative methods to control bollworm infestation in cotton
when this insect became resistant to most pesticides. Among the control measures implemented were:
1. The use of pest resistant cultivars and interplanting of cotton with wheat or maize.
2. Use of lamps and poplar twigs to trap and kill adults to lessen the number of adults.
3. If pesticides were used, they were applied on parts of cotton plant’s stem rather than by spraying the
whole field (to protect natural enemies of the bollworm).
These and some additional biological control tools have proved to be effective in controlling insect populations
and insect resistance, protecting surroundings and lowering costs.

The Future of the Sustainable Agriculture Concept
Many in the agricultural community have adopted the sense of urgency and direction pointed to by the
sustainable agriculture concept. Sustainability has become an integral component of many government,
commercial, and non-profit agriculture research efforts, and it is beginning to be woven into agricultural
policy. Increasing numbers of farmers and ranchers have embarked on their own paths to sustainability,
incorporating integrated and innovative approaches into their own enterprises.

9.6 Chapter Resources

Summary
In agriculture and horticulture, soil generally refers to the medium for plant growth, typically material
within the upper meter or two. Soil plays a key role in plant growth. Beneficial aspects to plants include
providing physical support, heat, water, nutrients, and oxygen. Heat, light, and oxygen are also obtained
by the atmosphere, but the roots of many plants also require oxygen. The prevailing agricultural system
has delivered tremendous gains in productivity and efficiency. Food production worldwide has risen in
the past 50 years. On the other hand, agriculture profoundly affects many ecological systems. Negative
effects of current practices include ecological concerns, economic and social concerns and human health
concerns. Pesticides from every chemical class have been detected in groundwater and are commonly
found in groundwater beneath agricultural areas. Despite impressive production gains, excessive use
of pesticides has proven to be ecologically unsound, leading to the destruction of natural enemies, the
increase of pest resistance pest resurgence and outbreaks of secondary pests. These consequences have
often resulted in higher production costs and lost markets due to undesirable pesticide residue levels, as
well as environmental and human health costs. Alternative and sustainable practices in farming and land
use include organic agriculture, integrated pest management and biological control.

10.1 Atmospheric Pollution

Air pollution occurs in many forms but can generally be thought of as gaseous and particulate
contaminants that are present in the earth’s atmosphere. Chemicals discharged into the air that have a
direct impact on the environment are called primary pollutants. These primary pollutants sometimes
react with other chemicals in the air to produce secondary pollutants.
Air pollution is typically separated into two categories: outdoor air pollution and indoor air pollution.
Outdoor air pollution involves exposures that take place outside of the built environment. Examples
include fine particles produced by the burning of coal, noxious gases such as sulfur dioxide, nitrogen
oxides and carbon monoxide; ground-level ozone and tobacco smoke. Indoor air pollution involves
exposures to particulates, carbon oxides, and other pollutants carried by indoor air or dust. Examples
include household products and chemicals, out-gassing of building materials, allergens (cockroach and
mouse dropping, mold, pollen), and tobacco smoke.

Sources of Air Pollution
A stationary source of air pollution refers to an emission source that does not move, also known as a
point source. Stationary sources include factories, power plants, and dry cleaners. The term area source
is used to describe many small sources of air pollution located together whose individual emissions may
be below thresholds of concern, but whose collective emissions can be significant. Residential wood
burners are a good example of a small source, but when combined with many other small sources, they
can contribute to local and regional air pollution levels. Area sources can also be thought of as non-point
sources, such as construction of housing developments, dry lake beds, and landfills.
A mobile source of air pollution refers to a source that is capable of moving under its own power.
In general, mobile sources imply “on-road” transportation, which includes vehicles such as cars, sport
utility vehicles, and buses. In addition, there is also a “non-road” or “off-road” category that includes
gas-powered lawn tools and mowers, farm and construction equipment, recreational vehicles, boats,
planes, and trains.
Agricultural sources arise from operations that raise animals and grow crops, which can generate
emissions of gases and particulate matter. For example, animals confined to a barn or restricted area
produce large amounts of manure. Manure emits various gases, particularly ammonia into the air. This
ammonia can be emitted from the animal houses, manure storage areas, or from the land after the manure
is applied. In crop production, the misapplication of fertilizers, herbicides, and pesticides can potentially
result in aerial drift of these materials and harm may be caused.
Unlike the above mentioned sources of air pollution, air pollution caused by natural sources is not
caused by people or their activities. An erupting volcano emits particulate matter and gases, forest and
prairie fires can emit large quantities of “pollutants”, dust storms can create large amounts of particulate
matter, and plants and trees naturally emit volatile organic compounds which can form aerosols that can
cause a natural blue haze. Wild animals in their natural habitat are also considered natural sources of
“pollution”.

Six Common Air Pollutants
The most commonly found air pollutants are particulate matter, ground-level ozone, carbon monoxide,
sulfur oxides, nitrogen oxides, and lead. These pollutants can harm health and the environment, and
cause property damage. Of the six pollutants, particle pollution and ground-level ozone are the most
widespread health threats. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) regulates them by
developing criteria based on considerations of human and environmental health.
Ground-level ozone is not emitted directly into the air, but is created by chemical reactions between
oxides of nitrogen (NOx) and volatile organic compounds (VOC) in the presence of sunlight. Emissions
from industrial facilities and electric utilities, motor vehicle exhaust, gasoline vapors, and chemical
solvents are some of the major sources of NOx and VOC. Breathing ozone can trigger a variety of
health problems, particularly for children, the elderly, and people of all ages who have lung diseases such
as asthma. Ground level ozone can also have harmful effects on sensitive vegetation and ecosystems.
(Ground-level ozone should not be confused with the ozone layer, which is high in the atmosphere and
protects Earth from ultraviolet light; ground-level ozone provides no such protection).
Particulate matter, also known as particle pollution, is a complex mixture of extremely small
particles and liquid droplets. Particle pollution is made up of a number of components, including acids
(such as nitrates and sulfates), organic chemicals, metals, and soil or dust particles. The size of particles
is directly linked to their potential for causing health problems. EPA is concerned about particles that
are 10 micrometers in diameter or smaller because those are the particles that generally pass through the
throat and nose and enter the lungs. Once inhaled, these particles can affect the heart and lungs and cause
serious health effects.
Carbon monoxide (CO) is a colorless, odorless gas emitted from combustion processes. Nationally
and, particularly in urban areas, the majority of CO emissions to ambient air come from mobile sources.
CO can cause harmful health effects by reducing oxygen delivery to the body’s organs (like the heart
and brain) and tissues. At extremely high levels, CO can cause death.
Nitrogen dioxide (NO2) is one of a group of highly reactive gasses known as “oxides of nitrogen,”
or nitrogen oxides (NOx). Other nitrogen oxides include nitrous acid and nitric acid. EPA’s National
Ambient Air Quality Standard uses NO2 as the indicator for the larger group of nitrogen oxides. NO2
forms quickly from emissions from cars, trucks and buses, power plants, and off-road equipment. In
addition to contributing to the formation of ground-level ozone, and fine particle pollution, NO2 is
linked with a number of adverse effects on the respiratory system.
Sulfur dioxide (SO2) is one of a group of highly reactive gasses known as “oxides of sulfur.”
The largest sources of SO2 emissions are from fossil fuel combustion at power plants (73%) and
other industrial facilities (20%). Smaller sources of SO2 emissions include industrial processes such as
extracting metal from ore, and the burning of high sulfur containing fuels by locomotives, large ships,
and non-road equipment. SO2 is linked with a number of adverse effects on the respiratory system.
Lead is a metal found naturally in the environment as well as in manufactured products. The major
sources of lead emissions have historically been from fuels in on-road motor vehicles (such as cars and
trucks) and industrial sources. As a result of regulatory efforts in the U.S. to remove lead from on-road
motor vehicle gasoline, emissions of lead from the transportation sector dramatically declined by 95
percent between 1980 and 1999, and levels of lead in the air decreased by 94 percent between 1980 and
1999. Today, the highest levels of lead in air are usually found near lead smelters. The major sources
of lead emissions to the air today are ore and metals processing and piston-engine aircraft operating on
leaded aviation gasoline.

Indoor Air Pollution (Major concerns in developed countries)
Most people spend approximately 90 percent of their time indoors. However, the indoor air we breathe
in homes and other buildings can be more polluted than outdoor air and can increase the risk of illness.
There are many sources of indoor air pollution in homes. They include biological contaminants such as
bacteria, molds and pollen, burning of fuels and environmental tobacco smoke, building materials and
furnishings, household products, central heating and cooling systems, and outdoor sources. Outdoor air
pollution can enter buildings and become a source of indoor air pollution.
Sick building syndrome is a term used to describe situations in which building occupants have health
symptoms that are associated only with spending time in that building. Causes of sick building syndrome
are believed to include inadequate ventilation, indoor air pollution, and biological contaminants. Usually
indoor air quality problems only cause discomfort. Most people feel better as soon as they remove the
source of the pollution. Making sure that your building is well-ventilated and getting rid of pollutants
can improve the quality of your indoor air.

Secondhand Smoke (Environmental Tobacco Smoke)
Secondhand smoke is the combination of smoke that comes from a cigarette and smoke breathed out by a
smoker. When a non-smoker is around someone smoking, they breathe in secondhand smoke.
Secondhand smoke is dangerous to anyone who breathes it in. There is no safe amount of secondhand smoke.
It contains over 7,000 harmful chemicals, at least 250 of which are known to damage human health. It can also
stay in the air for several hours after somebody smokes. Even breathing secondhand smoke for a short amount of
time can hurt your body.
Over time, secondhand smoke can cause serious health issues in non-smokers. The only way to fully protect
non-smokers from the dangers of secondhand smoke is to not allow smoking indoors. Separating smokers from
nonsmokers (like “no smoking” sections in restaurants)‚ cleaning the air‚ and airing out buildings does not
completely get rid of secondhand smoke.

10.2 Ozone Depletion

The ozone depletion
process
begins
when CFCs
(chlorofluorocarbons) and
other ozone-depleting substances (ODS) are
emitted into the atmosphere. CFC molecules are
extremely stable, and they do not dissolve in rain.
After a period of several years, ODS molecules
reach the stratosphere, about 10 kilometers above
the Earth’s surface. CFCs were used by industry
as refrigerants, degreasing solvents, and
propellants.
Ozone (O3) is constantly produced and
destroyed in a natural cycle, as shown in Figure
1. However, the overall amount of ozone is
essentially stable. This balance can be thought of

however, have upset that balance. In effect, they
are removing ozone faster than natural ozone creation reactions can keep up. Therefore, ozone levels
fall.

283

284 Matthew R. Fisher, Editor

Figure 2. Because ozone filters out harmful UVB radiation, less ozone means higher UVB
levels at the surface. The more the depletion, the larger the increase in incoming UVB.
UVB has been linked to skin cancer, cataracts, damage to materials like plastics, and
harm to certain crops and marine organisms. Although some UVB reaches the surface
even without ozone depletion, its harmful effects will increase as a result of this problem.

Policies to Reduce Ozone Destruction
One success story in reducing pollutants that harm the atmosphere concerns ozone-destroying chemicals.
In 1973, scientists calculated that CFCs could reach the stratosphere and break apart. This would release
chlorine atoms, which would then destroy ozone. Based only on their calculations, the United States and
most Scandinavian countries banned CFCs in spray cans in 1978. More confirmation that CFCs break
down ozone was needed before more was done to reduce production of ozone-destroying chemicals. In
1985, members of the British Antarctic Survey reported that a 50% reduction in the ozone layer had been
found over Antarctica in the previous three springs.
Two years after the British Antarctic Survey report, the “Montreal Protocol on Substances that
Deplete the Ozone Layer” was ratified by nations all over the world. The Montreal Protocol controls
the production and consumption of 96 chemicals that damage the ozone layer (Figure 3). CFCs have
been mostly phased out since 1995, although they were used in developing nations until 2010. Some of
the less hazardous substances will not be phased out until 2030. The Protocol also requires that wealthier
nations donate money to develop technologies that will replace these chemicals.

Environmental Biology 285

Figure 3. Ozone levels over North America decreased between 1974 and 2009. Models of the future predict what
ozone levels would have been if CFCs were not being phased out. Warmer colors indicate more ozone.

Because CFCs take many years to reach the stratosphere and can survive there a long time before they
break down, the ozone hole will probably continue to grow for some time before it begins to shrink. The
ozone layer will reach the same levels it had before 1980 around 2068 and 1950 levels in one or two
centuries.
Health and Environmental Effects of Ozone Layer Depletion
There are three types of UV light: UVA, UVB, and UVC. Reductions in stratospheric ozone levels will
lead to higher levels of UVB reaching the Earth’s surface. The sun’s output of UVB does not change;
rather, less ozone means less protection, and hence more UVB reaches the Earth. Studies have shown
that in the Antarctic, the amount of UVB measured at the surface can double during the annual ozone
hole.
Laboratory and epidemiological studies demonstrate that UVB causes non-melanoma skin cancers
and plays a major role in malignant melanoma development. In addition, UVB has been linked to
cataracts, a clouding of the eye’s lens. All sunlight contains some UVB, even with normal stratospheric
ozone levels. Therefore, it is always important to protect your skin and eyes from the sun. Ozone layer
depletion increases the amount of UVB and the risk of health effects.
UVB is generally harmful to cells, and therefore all organisms. UVB cannot penetrate into an
organism very far and thus tends to only impact skin cells. Microbes like bacteria, however, are
composed of only one cell and can therefore be harmed by UVB,

10.3 Acid Rain

Acid rain is a term referring to a mixture of wet
and dry deposition (deposited material) from the
atmosphere containing higher than normal
amounts of nitric and sulfuric acids. The
precursors, or chemical forerunners, of acid rain
formation result from both natural sources, such
as volcanoes and decaying vegetation, and manmade sources, primarily emissions of sulfur
dioxide
(SO2) and nitrogen
oxides
(NOx) resulting from fossil fuel combustion.
Acid rain occurs when these gases react in the
atmosphere with water, oxygen, and other
chemicals to form various acidic compounds. The
Figure 1. Processes involved in acid deposition.
result is a mild solution of sulfuric acid and nitric
acid. When sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides are released from power plants and other
sources, prevailing winds blow these compounds across state and national borders, sometimes over
hundreds of miles.
Acid rain is measured using a scale called “pH.” The lower a substance’s pH, the more acidic it
is. Pure water has a pH of 7.0. However, normal rain is slightly acidic because carbon dioxide (CO2)
dissolves into it forming weak carbonic acid, giving the resulting mixture a pH of approximately 5.6 at
typical atmospheric concentrations of CO2. As of 2000, the most acidic rain falling in the U.S. has a pH
of about 4.3.
Effects of Acid Rain
Acid rain causes acidification of lakes and streams and contributes to the damage of trees at high
elevations (for example, red spruce trees above 2,000 feet) and many sensitive forest soils. In addition,
acid rain accelerates the decay of building materials and paints, including irreplaceable buildings,
statues, and sculptures that are part of our nation’s cultural heritage. Prior to falling to the earth, sulfur
dioxide (SO2) and nitrogen oxide (NOx) gases and their particulate matter derivatives—sulfates and
nitrates—contribute to visibility degradation and harm public health.
The ecological effects of acid rain are most clearly seen in the aquatic, or water, environments, such
as streams, lakes, and marshes. Most lakes and streams have a pH between 6 and 8, although some lakes
are naturally acidic even without the effects of acid rain. Acid rain primarily affects sensitive bodies of
water, which are located in watersheds whose soils have a limited ability to neutralize acidic compounds
(called “buffering capacity”). Lakes and streams become acidic (i.e., the pH value goes down) when the
water itself and its surrounding soil cannot buffer the acid rain enough to neutralize it. In areas where
buffering capacity is low, acid rain releases aluminum from soils into lakes and streams; aluminum is
highly toxic to many species of aquatic organisms. Acid rain causes slower growth, injury, or death of
forests. Of course, acid rain is not the only cause of such conditions. Other factors contribute to the
overall stress of these areas, including air pollutants, insects, disease, drought, or very cold weather. In
287

288 Matthew R. Fisher, Editor

most cases, in fact, the impacts of acid rain on trees are due to the combined effects of acid rain and
these other environmental stressors.
Acid rain and the dry deposition of acidic
particles contribute to the corrosion of
metals(such as bronze) and the deterioration of
paint and stone (such as marble and limestone).
These effects significantly reduce the societal
value of buildings, bridges, cultural objects (such
as statues, monuments, and tombstones), and cars
(Figure 2).
Sulfates and nitrates that form in the
atmosphere from sulfur dioxide (SO2) and
nitrogen oxides (NOx) emissions contribute to
visibility impairment, meaning we cannot see as
far or as clearly through the air. The pollutants Figure 2. A gargoyle that has been damaged by acid rain.
that cause acid rain—sulfur dioxide (SO2) and
nitrogen oxides (NOx)—damage human health. These gases interact in the atmosphere to form fine
sulfate and nitrate particles that can be transported long distances by winds and inhaled deep into
people’s lungs. Fine particles can also penetrate indoors. Many scientific studies have identified a
relationship between elevated levels of fine particles and increased illness and premature death from
heart and lung disorders, such as asthma and bronchitis.

10.4 Global Climate Change

Earth’s Temperature is a Balancing Act
Earth’s temperature depends on the balance between energy entering and leaving the planet. When
incoming energy from the sun is absorbed, Earth warms. When the sun’s energy is reflected back into
space, Earth avoids warming. When energy is released from Earth into space, the planet cools. Many
factors, both natural and human, can cause changes in Earth’s energy balance, including:
• Changes in the greenhouse effect, which affects the amount of heat retained by Earth’s
atmosphere;
• Variations in the sun’s energy reaching Earth;
• Changes in the reflectivity of Earth’s atmosphere and surface.
Scientists have pieced together a picture of Earth’s climate, dating back hundreds of thousands of
years, by analyzing a number of indirect measures of climate such as ice cores, tree rings, glacier size,
pollen counts, and ocean sediments. Scientists have also studied changes in Earth’s orbit around the sun
and the activity of the sun itself.
The historical record shows that the climate varies naturally over a wide range of time scales. In
general, climate changes prior to the Industrial Revolution in the 1700s can be explained by natural
causes, such as changes in solar energy, volcanic eruptions, and natural changes in greenhouse gas
(GHG) concentrations. Recent changes in climate, however, cannot be explained by natural causes
alone. Research indicates that natural causes are very unlikely to explain most observed warming,
especially warming since the mid-20th century. Rather, it is extremely likely that human activities,
especially our combustion of fossil fuels, explains most of that warming. The scientific consensus is
clear: through alterations of the carbon cycle, humans are changing the global climate by increasing the
effects of something known as the greenhouse effect.
The Greenhouse Effect Causes the Atmosphere to Retain Heat
Gardeners that live in moderate or cool environments use greenhouses because they trap heat and create
an environment that is warmer than outside temperatures. This is great for plants that like heat, or are
sensitive to cold temperatures, such as tomato and pepper plants. Greenhouses contain glass or plastic
that allow visible light from the sun to pass. This light, which is a form of energy, is absorbed by plants,
soil, and surfaces and heats them. Some of that heat energy is then radiated outwards in the form of
infrared radiation, a different form of energy. Unlike with visible light, the glass of the greenhouse blocks
the infrared radiation, thereby trapping the heat energy, causing the temperature within the greenhouse
to increase.
The same phenomenon happens inside a car on a sunny day. Have you ever noticed how much hotter a
car can get compared to the outside temperature? Light energy from the sun passes through the windows
and is absorbed by the surfaces in the car such as seats and the dashboard. Those warm surfaces then
289

290 Matthew R. Fisher, Editor

radiate infrared radiation, which cannot pass through the glass. This trapped infrared energy causes the
air temperatures in the car to increase. This process is commonly known as the greenhouse effect.
The greenhouse effect also happens with the entire Earth. Of course, our planet is not surrounded
by glass windows. Instead, the Earth is wrapped with an atmosphere that contains greenhouse gases
(GHGs). Much like the glass in a greenhouse, GHGs allow incoming visible light energy from the sun
to pass, but they block infrared radiation that is radiated from the Earth towards space (Figure 1). In this
way, they help trap heat energy that subsequently raises air temperature. Being a greenhouse gas is a
physical property of certain types of gases; because of their molecular structure they absorb wavelengths
of infrared radiation, but are transparent to visible light. Some notable greenhouse gases are water vapor
(H2O), carbon dioxide (CO2), and methane (CH4). GHGs act like a blanket, making Earth significantly
warmer than it would otherwise be. Scientists estimate that average temperature on Earth would be -18º
C without naturally-occurring GHGs.
What is Global Warming?
Global warming refers to the recent and ongoing rise in global average temperature near Earth’s surface. It is
caused mostly by increasing concentrations of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. Global warming is causing
climate patterns to change. However, global warming itself represents only one aspect of climate change.
What is Climate Change?
Climate change refers to any significant change in the measures of climate lasting for an extended period of
time. In other words, climate change includes major changes in temperature, precipitation, or wind patterns,
among other effects, that occur over several decades or longer.

Figure 1. Enhanced Greenhouse Effect

Environmental Biology 291

The Main Greenhouse Gasses

The most important GHGs directly emitted by humans include CO2 and methane. Carbon dioxide
(CO2) is the primary greenhouse gas that is contributing to recent global climate change. CO2 is a natural
component of the carbon cycle, involved in such activities as photosynthesis, respiration, volcanic
eruptions, and ocean-atmosphere exchange. Human activities, primarily the burning of fossil fuels and
changes in land use, release very large amounts of CO2 to the atmosphere, causing its concentration in
the atmosphere to rise.
Atmospheric CO2 concentrations have increased by 45% since pre-industrial times, from
approximately 280 parts per million (ppm) in the 18th century to 408 ppm in 2018. The current
CO2 level is higher than it has been in at least 800,000 years, based on evidence from ice cores that
preserve ancient atmospheric gases. Human activities currently release over 30 billion tons of CO2 into
the atmosphere every year. While some some volcanic eruptions released large quantities of CO2 in the
distant past, the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) reports that human activities now emit more than 135
times as much CO2 as volcanoes each year. This human-caused build-up of CO2 in the atmosphere is
like a tub filling with water, where more water flows from the faucet than the drain can take away.

Figure 2. This graph, based on the comparison of atmospheric samples contained in ice cores and more recent direct
measurements, provides evidence that atmospheric CO2 has increased since the Industrial Revolution. (Credit: Vostok
ice core data/J.R. Petit et al.; NOAA Mauna Loa CO2 record.)

Methane (CH4) is produced through both natural and human activities. For example, wetlands,
agricultural activities, and fossil fuel extraction and transport all emit CH4. Methane is more abundant
in Earth’s atmosphere now than at any time in at least the past 650,000 years. Due to human activities,
CH4 concentrations increased sharply during most of the 20th century and are now more than two anda-half times pre-industrial levels. In recent decades, the rate of increase has slowed considerably.
Other Greenhouse Gasses

Water vapor is the most abundant greenhouse gas and also the most important in terms of its contribution
to the natural greenhouse effect, despite having a short atmospheric lifetime. Some human activities
can influence local water vapor levels. However, on a global scale, the concentration of water vapor is
controlled by temperature, which influences overall rates of evaporation and precipitation. Therefore,
the global concentration of water vapor is not substantially affected by direct human emissions.

292 Matthew R. Fisher, Editor

Ground-level ozone (O3), which also has a short atmospheric lifetime, is a potent greenhouse gas.
Chemical reactions create ozone from emissions of nitrogen oxides and volatile organic compounds
from automobiles, power plants, and other industrial and commercial sources in the presence of sunlight
(as discussed in section 10.1). In addition to trapping heat, ozone is a pollutant that can cause respiratory
health problems and damage crops and ecosystems.
Changes in the Sun’s Energy Affect how Much Energy Reaches Earth
Climate can be influenced by natural changes that affect how much solar energy reaches Earth. These
changes include changes within the sun and changes in Earth’s orbit. Changes occurring in the sun itself
can affect the intensity of the sunlight that reaches Earth’s surface. The intensity of the sunlight can cause
either warming (during periods of stronger solar intensity) or cooling (during periods of weaker solar
intensity). The sun follows a natural 11-year cycle of small ups and downs in intensity, but the effect on
Earth’s climate is small. Changes in the shape of Earth’s orbit as well as the tilt and position of Earth’s
axis can also affect the amount of sunlight reaching Earth’s surface.
Changes in the sun’s intensity have influenced Earth’s climate in the past. For example, the so-called
“Little Ice Age” between the 17th and 19th centuries may have been partially caused by a low solar
activity phase from 1645 to 1715, which coincided with cooler temperatures. The Little Ice Age refers
to a slight cooling of North America, Europe, and probably other areas around the globe. Changes in
Earth’s orbit have had a big impact on climate over tens of thousands of years. These changes appear
to be the primary cause of past cycles of ice ages, in which Earth has experienced long periods of cold
temperatures (ice ages), as well as shorter interglacial periods (periods between ice ages) of relatively
warmer temperatures.
Changes in solar energy continue to affect climate. However, solar activity has been relatively
constant, aside from the 11-year cycle, since the mid-20th century and therefore does not explain the
recent warming of Earth. Similarly, changes in the shape of Earth’s orbit as well as the tilt and position of
Earth’s axis affect temperature on relatively long timescales (tens of thousands of years), and therefore
cannot explain the recent warming.
Changes in Reflectivity Affect How Much Energy Enters Earth’s System
When sunlight energy reaches Earth it can be reflected or absorbed. The amount that is reflected or
absorbed depends on Earth’s surface and atmosphere. Light-colored objects and surfaces, like snow and
clouds, tend to reflect most sunlight, while darker objects and surfaces, like the ocean and forests, tend
to absorb more sunlight. The term albedo refers to the amount of solar radiation reflected from an object
or surface, often expressed as a percentage. Earth as a whole has an albedo of about 30%, meaning that
70% of the sunlight that reaches the planet is absorbed. Sunlight that is absorbed warms Earth’s land,
water, and atmosphere.
Albedo is also affected by aerosols. Aerosols are small particles or liquid droplets in the atmosphere
that can absorb or reflect sunlight. Unlike greenhouse gases (GHGs), the climate effects of aerosols vary
depending on what they are made of and where they are emitted. Those aerosols that reflect sunlight,
such as particles from volcanic eruptions or sulfur emissions from burning coal, have a cooling effect.
Those that absorb sunlight, such as black carbon (a part of soot), have a warming effect.
Natural changes in albedo, like the melting of sea ice or increases in cloud cover, have contributed
to climate change in the past, often acting as feedbacks to other processes. Volcanoes have played a
noticeable role in climate. Volcanic particles that reach the upper atmosphere can reflect enough sunlight

Environmental Biology 293

back to space to cool the surface of the planet by a few tenths of a degree for several years. Volcanic
particles from a single eruption do not produce long-term change because they remain in the atmosphere
for a much shorter time than GHGs.
Human changes in land use and land cover have changed Earth’s albedo. Processes such as
deforestation, reforestation, desertification, and urbanization often contribute to changes in climate in
the places they occur. These effects may be significant regionally, but are smaller when averaged over
the entire globe.

Scientific Consensus: Global Climate Change is Real
The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) was created in 1988 by the United Nations
Environment Programme and the World Meteorological Organization. It is charged with the task of
evaluating and synthesizing the scientific evidence surrounding global climate change. The IPCC uses
this information to evaluate current impacts and future risks, in addition to providing policymakers with
assessments. These assessments are released about once every every six years. The most recent report,
the 5th Assessment, was released in 2013. Hundreds of leading scientists from around the world are
chosen to author these reports. Over the history of the IPCC, these scientists have reviewed thousands of
peer-reviewed, publicly available studies. The scientific consensus is clear: global climate change is real
and humans are very likely the cause for this change.
Additionally, the major scientific agencies of the United States, including the National Aeronautics
and Space Administration (NASA) and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA),
also agree that climate change is occurring and that humans are driving it. In 2010, the US National
Research Council concluded that “Climate change is occurring, is very likely caused by human
activities, and poses significant risks for a broad range of human and natural systems”. Many
independent scientific organizations have released similar statements, both in the United States and
abroad. This doesn’t necessarily mean that every scientist sees eye to eye on each component of the
climate change problem, but broad agreement exists that climate change is happening and is primarily
caused by excess greenhouse gases from human activities. Critics of climate change, driven by ideology
instead of evidence, try to suggest to the public that there is no scientific consensus on global climate
change. Such an assertion is patently false.

Current Status of Global Climate Change and Future Changes
Greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere will continue to increase unless the billions of tons of
anthropogenic emissions each year decrease substantially. Increased concentrations are expected to:

294 Matthew R. Fisher, Editor

• Increase Earth’s average temperature,
• Influence the patterns and amounts
of precipitation,
• Reduce ice and snow cover, as well as
permafrost,
• Raise sea level,
• Increase the acidity of the oceans.
These changes will impact our food supply, water
resources, infrastructure, ecosystems, and even our
own health. The magnitude and rate of future
climate change will primarily depend on the
following factors:
• The rate at which levels of greenhouse
gas concentrations in our atmosphere
continue to increase,
• How strongly features of the climate
(e.g., temperature, precipitation, and sea
level) respond to the expected increase in
greenhouse gas concentrations,
• Natural influences on climate (e.g., from
volcanic activity and changes in the
sun’s intensity) and natural processes
within the climate system (e.g., changes
in ocean circulation patterns).
Past and Present-day GHG Emissions Will
Affect Climate Far into the Future

Figure 3. Ice at the Russian Vostok station in East
Antarctica was laid down over the course 420,000 years
and reached a depth of over 3,000 m. By measuring the
amount of CO2 trapped in the ice, scientists have
determined past atmospheric CO2 concentrations.
Temperatures relative to modern day were determined
from the amount of deuterium (an isotope of hydrogen)
present.

Many greenhouse gases stay in the atmosphere for
long periods of time. As a result, even if emissions stopped increasing, atmospheric greenhouse gas
concentrations would continue to remain elevated for hundreds of years. Moreover, if we stabilized
concentrations and the composition of today’s atmosphere remained steady (which would require a
dramatic reduction in current greenhouse gas emissions), surface air temperatures would continue to
warm. This is because the oceans, which store heat, take many decades to fully respond to higher
greenhouse gas concentrations. The ocean’s response to higher greenhouse gas concentrations and
higher temperatures will continue to impact climate over the next several decades to hundreds of years.
Future Temperature Changes

Climate models project the following key temperature-related changes:
Key Global Projections

Environmental Biology 295

• Average global temperatures are expected to increase by 2°F to 11.5°F by 2100, depending on
the level of future greenhouse gas emissions, and the outcomes from various climate models.
• By 2100, global average temperature is expected to warm at least twice as much as it has
during the last 100 years.
• Ground-level air temperatures are expected to continue to warm more rapidly over land than
oceans.
• Some parts of the world are projected to see larger temperature increases than the global
average.
Future Precipitation and Storm Events
Patterns of precipitation and storm events, including both rain and snowfall are likely to change.
However, some of these changes are less certain than the changes associated with temperature.
Projections show that future precipitation and storm changes will vary by season and region. Some
regions may have less precipitation, some may have more precipitation, and some may have little
or no change. The amount of rain falling in heavy precipitation events is likely to increase in most
regions, while storm tracks are projected to shift towards the poles. Climate models project the following
precipitation and storm changes:
• Global average annual precipitation through the end of the century is expected to increase,
although changes in the amount and intensity of precipitation will vary by region.
• The intensity of precipitation events will likely increase on average. This will be particularly
pronounced in tropical and high-latitude regions, which are also expected to experience overall
increases in precipitation.
• The strength of the winds associated with tropical storms is likely to increase. The amount of
precipitation falling in tropical storms is also likely to increase.
• Annual average precipitation is projected to increase in some areas and decrease in others.
Future Ice, Snowpack, and Permafrost
Arctic sea ice is already declining drastically. The area of snow cover in the Northern Hemisphere
has decreased since 1970. Permafrost temperature has increased over the last century, making it more
susceptible to thawing. Over the next century, it is expected that sea ice will continue to decline, glaciers
will continue to shrink, snow cover will continue to decrease, and permafrost will continue to thaw.
For every 2°F of warming, models project about a 15% decrease in the extent of annually averaged
sea ice and a 25% decrease in September Arctic sea ice. The coastal sections of the Greenland and
Antarctic ice sheets are expected to continue to melt or slide into the ocean. If the rate of this ice melting
increases in the 21st century, the ice sheets could add significantly to global sea level rise. Glaciers are
expected to continue to decrease in size. The rate of melting is expected to continue to increase, which
will contribute to sea level rise.

296 Matthew R. Fisher, Editor

Future Sea Level Change
Warming temperatures contribute to sea level rise by expanding ocean water, melting mountain
glaciers and ice caps, and causing portions of the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets to melt or flow into
the ocean. Since 1870, global sea level has risen by about 8 inches. Estimates of future sea level rise vary
for different regions, but global sea level for the next century is expected to rise at a greater rate than
during the past 50 years. The contribution of thermal expansion, ice caps, and small glaciers to sea level
rise is relatively well-studied, but the impacts of climate change on ice sheets are less understood and
represent an active area of research. Thus, it is more difficult to predict how much changes in ice sheets
will contribute to sea level rise. Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets could contribute an additional 1 foot
of sea level rise, depending on how the ice sheets respond.
Regional and local factors will influence future relative sea level rise for specific coastlines around
the world. For example, relative sea level rise depends on land elevation changes that occur as a result of
subsidence (sinking) or uplift (rising), in addition to things such as local currents, winds, salinity, water
temperatures, and proximity to thinning ice sheets. Assuming that these historical geological forces
continue, a 2-foot rise in global sea level by 2100 would result in the following relative sea level rise:
• 2.3 feet at New York City
• 2.9 feet at Hampton Roads, Virginia
• 3.5 feet at Galveston, Texas
• 1 foot at Neah Bay in Washington state
Future Ocean Acidification
Ocean acidification is the process of ocean waters decreasing in pH. Oceans become more acidic as
carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions in the atmosphere dissolve in the ocean. This change is measured
on the pH scale, with lower values being more acidic. The pH level of the oceans has decreased
by approximately 0.1 pH units since pre-industrial times, which is equivalent to a 25% increase in
acidity. The pH level of the oceans is projected to decrease even more by the end of the century as
CO2 concentrations are expected to increase for the foreseeable future. Ocean acidification adversely
affects many marine species, including plankton, mollusks, shellfish, and corals. As ocean acidification
increases, the availability of calcium carbonate will decline. Calcium carbonate is a key building block
for the shells and skeletons of many marine organisms. If atmospheric CO2 concentrations double, coral
calcification rates are projected to decline by more than 30%. If CO2 concentrations continue to rise at
their current rate, corals could become rare on tropical and subtropical reefs by 2050.
Spread of Disease
This rise in global temperatures will increase the range of disease-carrying insects and the viruses and
pathogenic parasites they harbor. Thus, diseases will spread to new regions of the globe. This spread
has already been documented with dengue fever, a disease the affects hundreds of millions per year,
according to the World Health Organization. Colder temperatures typically limit the distribution of
certain species, such as the mosquitoes that transmit malaria, because freezing temperatures destroy their
eggs.

Environmental Biology 297

Not only will the range of some disease-causing insects expand, the increasing temperatures will
also accelerate their lifecycles, which allows them to breed and multiply quicker, and perhaps evolve
pesticide resistance faster. In addition to dengue fever, other diseases are expected to spread to new
portions of the world as the global climate warms. These include malaria, yellow fever, West Nile virus,
zika virus, and chikungunya.

Climate change affects everyone
Our lives are connected to the climate. Human societies have adapted to the relatively stable climate
we have enjoyed since the last ice age which ended several thousand years ago. A warming climate
will bring changes that can affect our water supplies, agriculture, power and transportation systems, the
natural environment, and even our own health and safety.
Carbon dioxide can stay in the atmosphere for nearly a century, on average, so Earth will continue
to warm in the coming decades. The warmer it gets, the greater the risk for more severe changes to the
climate and Earth’s system. Although it’s difficult to predict the exact impacts of climate change, what’s
clear is that the climate we are accustomed to is no longer a reliable guide for what to expect in the
future.
We can reduce the risks we will face from climate change. By making choices that reduce greenhouse
gas pollution, and preparing for the changes that are already underway, we can reduce risks from climate
change. Our decisions today will shape the world our children and grandchildren will live in.
You Can Take Action
You can take steps at home, on the road, and in your office to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and the
risks associated with climate change. Many of these steps can save you money. Some, such as walking
or biking to work, can even improve your health! You can also get involved on a local or state level to
support energy efficiency, clean energy programs, or other climate programs.

Summary
Air pollution can be thought of as gaseous and particulate contaminants that are present in the earth’s
atmosphere. Chemicals discharged into the air that have a direct impact on the environment are
called primary pollutants. These primary pollutants sometimes react with other chemicals in the air
to produce secondary pollutants. The commonly found air pollutants, known as criteria pollutants, are
particle pollution, ground-level ozone, carbon monoxide, sulfur oxides, nitrogen oxides, and lead. These
pollutants can harm health and the environment, and cause property damage. The historical record
shows that the climate system varies naturally over a wide range of time scales. In general, climate
changes prior to the Industrial Revolution in the 1700s can be explained by natural causes, such as
changes in solar energy, volcanic eruptions, and natural changes in greenhouse gas concentrations.
Recent climate changes, however, cannot be explained by natural causes alone. Natural causes are very
unlikely to explain most observed warming, especially warming since the mid-20th century. Rather,
human activities can explain most of that warming.
The primary human activity affecting the amount and rate of climate change is greenhouse gas
emissions from the burning of fossil fuels. Greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere will
continue to increase unless the billions of tons of our annual emissions decrease substantially. Increased
concentrations are expected to increase Earth’s average temperature, influence the patterns and amounts
of precipitation, reduce ice and snow cover, as well as permafrost, raise sea level and increase the acidity
of the oceans. These changes will impact our food supply, water resources, infrastructure, ecosystems,
and even our own health. Acid rain is a term referring to a mixture of wet and dry deposition from the
atmosphere containing higher than normal amounts of nitric and sulfuric acids. The precursors of acid
rain formation result from both natural sources, such as volcanoes and decaying vegetation, and manmade sources, primarily emissions of sulfur dioxide (SO2) and nitrogen oxides (NOx) resulting from
fossil fuel combustion. Acid rain causes acidification of lakes and streams, contributes to the damage of
trees and many sensitive forest soils. In addition, acid rain accelerates the decay of building materials
and paints, contributes to the corrosion of metals and damages human health. The ozone depletion
process begins when CFCs and other ozone-depleting substances (ODS) are emitted into the atmosphere.
Reductions in stratospheric ozone levels lead to higher levels of UVB reaching the Earth’s surface. The
sun’s output of UVB does not change; rather, less ozone means less protection, and hence more UVB
reaches the Earth. Ozone layer depletion increases the amount of UVB tat lead to negative health and
environmental effects.

11.1 Challenges and Impacts of Energy Use

Energy for lighting, heating and cooling our buildings, manufacturing products, and powering our
transportation systems comes from a variety of natural sources. The earth’s core provides geothermal
energy. The gravitational pull of moon and sun create tides. The sun emits light (electromagnetic
radiation), which creates wind, powers the water (hydrologic) cycle, and enables photosynthesis. Plants,
algae, and cyanobacteria utilize solar energy to grow and create biomass that can be burned and used
for biofuels, such as wood, biodiesel, bioethanol. Over the course of millions of years, biomass from
photosynthetic organisms can create energy-rich fossil fuels through the geologic process of burial and
transformation through heat and pressure.
Each of these types of energy can be defined as renewable or non-renewable. Renewable energy
sources can be replenished within human lifespans. Examples include solar, wind, and biomass
energy. Non-renewable energy is finite and cannot be replenished within a human timescale. Examples
include nuclear energy and fossil fuels, which take millions of years to form. All energy sources have
and some environmental and health cost, and the distribution of energy is not equally distributed among
all nations.

Environmental and Health Challenges of Energy Use
The environmental impacts of energy use on humans and the planet can happen anywhere during the life
cycle of the energy source. The impacts begin with the extraction of the resource. They continue with the
processing, purification or manufacture of the source; its transportation to place of energy generation,
and ends with the disposal of waste generated during use.
Extraction of fossil fuels can be used as a case study because its use has significant impacts on the
environment. As we mine deeper into mountains, farther out at sea, or farther into pristine habitats, we
risk damaging fragile environments, and the results of accidents or natural disasters during extraction
processes can be devastating. Fossils fuels are often located far from where they are utilized so they need
to be transported by pipeline, tankers, rail or trucks. These all present the potential for accidents, leakage
and spills. When transported by rail or truck energy must be expended and pollutants are generated.
Processing of petroleum, gas and coal generates various types of emissions and wastes, as well as utilizes
water resources. Production of energy at power plants results in air, water, and, often, waste emissions.
Power plants are highly regulated in the Unites States by federal and state law under the Clean Air and
Clean Water Acts, while nuclear power plants are regulated by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission.

Geopolitical Challenges of Fossil Fuels
The use of fossil fuels has allowed much of the global population to
reach a higher standard of living. However, this dependence on fossil
fuels results in many significant impacts on society. Our modern
technologies and services, such as transportation and plastics depend
in many ways on fossil fuels. If supplies become limited or extremely
costly, our economies are vulnerable. If countries do not have fossil
fuel reserves of their own, they incur even more risk. The United
States has become more and more dependent on foreign oil since 1970
when our own oil production peaked. The United States imported over
half of the crude oil and refined petroleum products that we consumed
during 2009. Just over half of these imports came from the Western
Hemisphere (Figure 2).
The major holder of oil reserves is the Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries, (OPEC) (Figure 3). As of 2018, there were 15
member countries in OPEC: Algeria, Angola, Congo, Ecuador,
Equatorial Guinea, Gabon, Iran, Iraq, Kuwait, Libya, Nigeria, Qatar,
Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, and Venezuela. OPEC
attempts to influence the amount of oil available to the world by
assigning a production quota to each member except Iraq, for which
no quota is presently set.
Overall compliance with these quotas is mixed since the
individual countries make the actual production decisions. All
of these countries have a national oil company but also allow
international oil companies to operate within their borders.
They can restrict the amounts of production by those oil
companies. Therefore, the OPEC countries have a large
influence on how much of world demand is met by OPEC and
non-OPEC supply. A recent example of this is the price
increases that occurred during the year 2011 after multiple
popular uprisings in Arab countries, including Libya.

Eastern countries such as Canada, Mexico, Venezuela, and
Nigeria. However, since fossil fuel reserves create jobs and provide dividends to investors, a lot is at
stake in a nation that has oil reserves. Oil wealth may be shared with the country’s inhabitants or retained
by the oil companies and dictatorships, such as in Nigeria prior to the 1990s.

11.2 Non-Renewable Energy Sources

Fossil Fuels
Fossil fuels comes from the organic matter of plants, algae, and cyanobacteria that was buried, heated,
and compressed under high pressure over millions of years. The process transformed the biomass of
those organisms into the three types of fossil fuels: oil, coal, and natural gas.
Petroleum (oil)
Thirty seven percent of the world’s energy consumption and 43% of the United States energy
consumption comes from oil. Scientists and policy-makers often discuss the question of when the world
will reach peak oil production, the point at which oil production is at its greatest and then declines. It
is generally thought that peak oil will be reached by the middle of the 21st Century, although making
such estimates is difficult because a lot of variables must be considered. Currently world reserves are 1.3
trillion barrels, or 45 years left at current level of production..
Environmental Impacts of Oil Extraction and Refining

Oil is usually found one to two miles (1.6 – 3.2 km) below the Earth’s surface, whether that is on land
or ocean. Once oil is found and extracted it must be refined, which separates and prepares the mix of
crude oil into the different types for gas, diesel, tar, and asphalt. Oil refining is one of top sources of
air pollution in the United States for volatile organic hydrocarbons and toxic emissions, and the single
largest source of carcinogenic benzene. When petroleum is burned as gasoline or diesel, or to make
electricity or to power boilers for heat, it produces a number of emissions that have a detrimental effect
on the environment and human health:
• Carbon dioxide (CO2) is a greenhouse gas and a source of climate change.
• Sulfur dioxide (SO2) causes acid rain, which damages plants and animals that live in water,
and it increases or causes respiratory illnesses and heart diseases, particularly in vulnerable
populations like children and the elderly.
• Nitrous oxides (NOx) and Volatile Organic Carbons (VOCs) contribute to ozone at ground
level, which is an irritant and causes damage to the lungs.
• Particulate Matter (PM) produces hazy conditions in cities and scenic areas, and combines
with ozone to contribute to asthma and chronic bronchitis, especially in children and the
elderly. Very small, or “fine PM,” is also thought to penetrate the respiratory system more
deeply and cause emphysema and lung cancer.
• Lead can have severe health impacts, especially for children.
There are other domestic sources of oil that are being considered as conventional resources and
are being depleted. These include tar sands – deposits of moist sand and clay with 1-2 percent
309

310 Matthew R. Fisher, Editor

bitumen (thick and heavy petroleum rich in carbon and poor in hydrogen). These are removed by
strip mining (see section below on coal). Another source is oil shale, which is sedimentary rock filled
with organic matter that can be processed to produce liquid petroleum. Extracted by strip mining or
creating subsurface mines, oil shale can be burned directly like coal or baked in the presence of hydrogen
to extract liquid petroleum. However, the net energy values are low and they are expensive to extract and
process. Both of these resources have severe environmental impacts due to strip mining, carbon dioxide,
methane and other air pollutants similar to other fossil fuels.
As the United States tries to extract more oil from its own dwindling resources, they are drilling
even deeper into the earth and increasing the environmental risks. The largest United States oil spill
to date began in April 2010 when an explosion occurred on Deepwater Horizon Oil Rig killing 11
employees and spilling nearly 200 million gallons of oil before the resulting leak could be stopped.
Wildlife, ecosystems, and people’s livelihood were adversely affected. A lot of money and huge amounts
of energy were expended on immediate clean-up efforts. The long-term impacts are still not known. The
National Commission on the Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill and Offshore Drilling was set up to study
what went wrong.
The Global Dependence of Transportation on Oil

Two-thirds of oil consumption is devoted to transportation, providing fuel for cars, trucks, trains and
airplanes. For the United States and most developed societies, transportation is woven into the fabric of
our lives, a necessity as central to daily operations as food or shelter. The concentration of oil reserves
in a few regions or the world makes much of the world dependent on imported energy for transportation.
The rise in the price of oil in the last decade makes dependence on imported energy for transportation
an economic as well as an energy issue. The United States, for example, now spends upwards of $350
billion annually on imported oil, a drain of economic resources that could be used to stimulate growth,
create jobs, build infrastructure and promote social advances at home.

Environmental Biology 311

Coal
Unlike oil, coal is a solid. Due to its relatively low cost
and abundance, coal is used to generate about half of the
electricity consumed in the United States. Coal is the
largest domestically produced source of energy. Coal
production has doubled in the United States over the last
sixty year (Figure 1). Current world reserves are estimated
at 826,000 million tonnes, with nearly 30% of that in the
United States. It is a major fuel resource that the United
States controls domestically.
Coal is plentiful and inexpensive, when looking only at
the market cost relative to the cost of other sources of
electricity, but its extraction, transportation, and use
produces a multitude of environmental impacts that the
market cost does not truly represent. Coal emits sulfur
dioxide, nitrogen oxide, and mercury, which have been
linked to acid rain, smog, and health issues. Burning of Figure 1. Historic U.S. Coal Production Graph

energy than the use of oil or natural gas. Coal accounted for Source: U.S. Energy Information
35% of the total United States emissions of carbon dioxide Administration
released into the Earth’s atmosphere in 2010. Ash
generated from combustion contributes to water contamination. Some coal mining has a negative impact
on ecosystems and water quality, and alters landscapes and scenic views (such as with mountaintop
mining).
There are also significant health effects and risks to coal miners and those living in the vicinity of coal
mines. Traditional underground mining is risky to mine workers due to the risk of entrapment or death.
Over the last 15 years, the U.S. Mine Safety and Health Administration has published the number of
mine worker fatalities and it has varied from 18-48 per year. Twenty-nine miners died on April 6, 2010
in an explosion at the Upper Big Branch coal mine in West Virginia, contributing to the uptick in deaths
between 2009 and 2010. In other countries, with less safety regulations, accidents occur more frequently.
In May 2011, for example, three people died and 11 were trapped in a coalmine in Mexico for several
days. There is also risk of getting black lung disease (pneumoconiosis). This is a disease of the lungs
caused by the inhalation of coal dust over a long period of time. It causes coughing and shortness of
breath. If exposure is stopped the outcome is good. However, the complicated form may cause shortness
of breath that gets increasingly worse.

Mountaintop mining (MTM), while less
hazardous to workers, has particularly
detrimental effects on land resources. MTM is a
surface mining practice involving the removal of
mountaintops to expose coal seams, and
disposing of the associated mining waste in
adjacent valleys. This form of mining is very
damaging to the environment because it literally
removes the tops of mountains, destroying the
existing habitat. Additionally, the debris from
MTM is dumped into valleys burying streams and
other important habitat.
Natural Gas

Natural gas meets 20% of world energy needs and 25% of United States needs. Natural gas is mainly
composed of methane (CH4) and is a very potent greenhouse gas. There are two types of natural
gas. Biogenic gas is found at shallow depths and arises from anaerobic decay of organic matter by
bacteria, like landfill gas. Thermogenic gas comes from the compression of organic matter and deep
heat underground. They are found with petroleum in reservoir rocks and with coal deposits, and these
fossil fuels are extracted together.
Natural gas is released into the atmosphere from coal mines, oil and gas wells, and natural gas storage
tanks, pipelines, and processing plants. These leaks are the source of about 25% of total U.S. methane
emissions, which translates to three percent of total U.S. greenhouse gas emissions. When natural gas
is produced but cannot be captured and transported economically, it is “flared,” or burned at well sites,
which converts it to CO2. This is considered to be safer and better than releasing methane into the
atmosphere because CO2 is a less potent greenhouse gas than methane.
In the last few years a new reserve of natural gas has been identified: shale resources. The United
States possesses 2,552 trillion cubic feet (Tcf) (72.27 trillion cubic meters) of potential natural gas
resources, with shale resources accounting for 827 Tcf (23.42 tcm). As natural gas prices increased it
has become more economical to extract the gas from shale. Figure 3 shows the past and forecasted U.S.
natural gas production and the various sources. The current reserves are enough to last about 110 years
at the 2009 rate of U.S. consumption (about 22.8 Tcf per year -645.7 bcm per year).

Environmental Biology 313

natural gas production from various sources. Source: U.S. Energy Information
Administration

Natural gas is a preferred fossil fuel when considering its environmental impacts. Specifically, when
burned, much less carbon dioxide (CO2), nitrogen oxides, and sulfur dioxide are omitted than from the
combustion of coal or oil. It also does not produce ash or toxic emissions.
Natural gas production can result in the production of large volumes of contaminated water. This
water has to be properly handled, stored, and treated so that it does not pollute land and water
supplies. Extraction of shale gas is more problematic than traditional sources due to a process nicknamed
fracking, or fracturing of wells, since it requires large amounts of water (Figure 4). The technique
uses high-pressure fluids to fracture the normally hard shale deposits and release gas and oil trapped
inside the rock. To promote the flow of gas out of the rock, small particles of solids are included in the
fracturing liquids to lodge in the shale cracks and keep them open after the liquids are depressurized. The
considerable use of water may affect the availability of water for other uses in some regions and
this can affect aquatic habitats. If mismanaged, hydraulic fracturing fluid can be released by spills,
leaks, or various other exposure pathways. The fluid contains potentially hazardous chemicals such as
hydrochloric acid, glutaraldehyde, petroleum distillate, and ethylene glycol. The risks of fracking have
been highlighted in popular culture in the documentary, Gasland (2010).

The raw gas from a well may contain many other compounds besides the methane that is being sought,
including hydrogen sulfide, a very toxic gas. Natural gas with high concentrations of hydrogen sulfide is
usually flared which produces CO2, carbon monoxide, sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides, and many other
compounds. Natural gas wells and pipelines often have engines to run equipment and compressors,
which produce additional air pollutants and noise.
Contributions of Coal and Natural Gas to Electricity Generation
At present the fossil fuels used for electricity generation in the US are predominantly coal (44%) and
natural gas (23%); petroleum accounts for approximately 1%. Coal electricity traces its origins to the
early 20th Century, when it was the natural fuel for steam engines given its abundance, high energy
density and low cost. gatural Gas is a later addition to the fossil electricity mix, arriving in significant
quantities after World War II and with its greatest growth since 1990. Of the two fuels, coal emits
almost twice the carbon dioxide as natural gas for the same heat output, making it significantly greater
contributor to global warming and climate change.

Environmental Biology 315

The Future of Natural Gas and Coal
The future development of coal and natural gas depend on the degree of public and regulatory concern
for carbon emissions, and the relative price and supply of the two fuels. Supplies of coal are abundant
in the United States, and the transportation chain from mines to power plants is well established. The
primary unknown factor is the degree of public and regulatory pressure that will be placed on carbon
emissions. Strong regulatory pressure on carbon emissions would favor retirement of coal and addition
of natural gas power plants. This trend is reinforced by the recent dramatic expansion of shale gas
reserves in the United States due to advances in drilling technology. Shale natural gas production has
increased 48% annually in the years 2006 – 2010, with more increases expected. Greater United States
production of shale gas will gradually reduce imports and could eventually make the United States a net
exporter of natural gas.

Nuclear Power
Nuclear power is energy released from the radioactive decay of elements, such as uranium, which
releases large amounts of energy. Nuclear power plants produce no carbon dioxide and, therefore,
are often considered an alternative fuel (fuels other than fossil fuels). Currently, world production
of electricity from nuclear power is about 19.1 trillion KWh, with the United States producing and
consuming about 22% of that. Nuclear power provides about 9% of the electricity in the United States
(Figure 7).

316 Matthew R. Fisher, Editor

There are environmental challenges with nuclear power. Mining and refining uranium ore and making
reactor fuel demands a lot of energy. Also, nuclear power plants are very expensive and require large
amounts of metal, concrete, and energy to build. The main environmental challenge for nuclear power is
the wastes including uranium mill tailings, spent (used) reactor fuel, and other radioactive wastes. These
materials have long radioactive half-lives and thus remain a threat to human health for thousands of
years. The half life of a radioactive element is the time it takes for 50% of the material to radioactively
decay. The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission regulates the operation of nuclear power plants and
the handling, transportation, storage, and disposal of radioactive materials to protect human health and
the environment.
By volume, the waste produced from mining uranium, called uranium mill tailings, is the largest
waste and contains the radioactive element radium, which decays to produce radon, a radioactive gas.
High-level radioactive waste consists of used nuclear reactor fuel. This fuel is in a solid form consisting
of small fuel pellets in long metal tubes and must be stored and handled with multiple containment, first
cooled by water and later in special outdoor concrete or steel containers that are cooled by air. There is
no long-term storage facility for this fuel in the United States.
There are many other regulatory precautions
governing permitting, construction, operation,
and decommissioning of nuclear power plants
due to risks from an uncontrolled nuclear
reaction. The potential for contamination of air,
water and food is high should an uncontrolled
reaction occur. Even when planning for worstcase scenarios, there are always risks of
unexpected events. For example, the March 2011
earthquake and subsequent tsunami that hit Japan Figure 7. U.S. Energy Consumption by Energy Source,

Debating Nuclear Energy
From a sustainability perspective, nuclear electricity presents an interesting dilemma. On the one hand,
nuclear electricity produces no carbon emissions, a major sustainable advantage in a world facing
anthropogenic climate change. On the other hand, nuclear electricity produces dangerous waste that i)
must be stored out of the environment for thousands of years, ii) can produce bomb-grade plutonium
and uranium that could be diverted by terrorists or others to destroy cities and poison the environment,
and iii) threatens the natural and built environment through accidental leaks of long-lived radiation.
Thoughtful scientists, policy makers, and citizens must weigh the benefit of this source of carbon-free
electricity against the environmental risk of storing spent fuel, the societal risk of nuclear proliferation,
and the impact of accidental or deliberate release of radiation. There are very few examples of humans
having the power to permanently change the dynamics of the earth. Global climate change from carbon
emissions is one example, and radiation from the explosion of a sufficient number of nuclear weapons is
another. Nuclear electricity touches both of these opportunities, on the positive side for reducing carbon
emissions and on the negative side for the risk of nuclear proliferation.
Nuclear electricity came on the energy scene remarkably quickly. Following the development of
nuclear technology at the end of World War II for military ends, nuclear energy quickly acquired a new

Environmental Biology 317

peacetime path for inexpensive production of electricity. Eleven years after the end of World War II,
a very short time in energy terms, the first commercial nuclear reactor produced electricity at Calder
Hall in Sellafield, England. The number of nuclear reactors grew steadily to more than 400 by 1990,
four years after the Chernobyl disaster in 1986 and eleven years following Three Mile Island in 1979.
Since 1990, the number of operating reactors has remained approximately flat, with new construction
balancing decommissioning due to public and government reluctance to proceed with nuclear electricity
expansion plans.
The outcome of this debate will determine whether the world experiences a nuclear renaissance that
has been in the making for several years. The global discussion has been strongly impacted by the
unlikely nuclear accident in Fukushima, Japan in March 2011. The Fukushima nuclear disaster was
caused by an earthquake and tsunami that disabled the cooling system for a nuclear energy complex
consisting of operating nuclear reactors and storage pools for underwater storage of spent nuclear fuel
ultimately causing a partial meltdown of some of the reactor cores and release of significant radiation.
This event, 25 years after Chernobyl, reminds us that safety and public confidence are especially
important in nuclear energy; without them expansion of nuclear energy will not happen.

11.3 Renewable Energy Sources

Hydropower
Hydropower (hydroelectric) relies on water to
spin turbines and create electricity. It is
considered a clean and renewable source of
energy because it does not directly produce
pollutants and because the source of power is
regenerated. Hydropower provides 35% of the
United States’ renewable energy consumption.
Hydropower dams and the reservoirs they create
can have environmental impacts. For example,
migration of fish to their upstream spawning
areas can be obstructed by dams. In areas where
salmon must travel upstream to spawn, such as
along the Columbia River in Washington and
Oregon, the dams block their way. This problem Figure 1. Hoover Power Plant View of Hoover Power
Plant on the Colorado River as seen from above. Source:
can be partially alleviated by using “fish ladders”
U.S. Department of the Interior
that help salmon get around the dams. Fish
traveling downstream, however, can get killed or
injured as water moves through turbines in the dam. Reservoirs and operation of dams can also affect
aquatic habitats due to changes in water temperatures, water depth, chemistry, flow characteristics, and
sediment loads, all of which can lead to significant changes in the ecology and physical characteristics
of the river both upstream and downstream. As reservoirs fill with water it may cause natural areas,
farms, cities, and archeological sites to be inundated and force populations to relocate.

Small hydropower systems
Large-scale dam hydropower projects are often
criticized for their impacts on wildlife habitat,
fish migration, and water flow and quality.
However, small run-of- the-river projects are
free from many of the environmental problems
associated with their large-scale relatives because
they use the natural flow of the river, and thus
produce relatively little change in the stream
channel and flow. The dams built for some runof-the-river projects are very small and impound
little water, and many projects do not require a
dam at all. Thus, effects such as oxygen
depletion, increased temperature, decreased flow,
and impeded upstream migration are not
problems for many run-of-the-river projects.
Small hydropower projects offer emissions-free Figure 2. Microhydropower system. Although there are
power solutions for many remote communities several ways to harness the moving water to produce
throughout the world, such as those in Nepal, energy, run-of-the-river systems, which do not require
large storage reservoirs, are often used for microhydro,
India, China, and Peru, as well as for highly and sometimes for small-scale hydro, projects. For
industrialized countries like the United States. run-of-the-river hydro projects, a portion of a river’s water

power an alternator or generator to generate electricity.
the systems used by home and small business
owners would qualify as microhydropower
systems. In fact, a 10 kW system generally can provide enough power for a large home, a small resort,
or a hobby farm.

Municipal Solid Waste
Municipal solid waste (MSW) is commonly known as garbage and can create electricity by burning it
directly or by burning the methane produced as it decays. Waste to energy processes are gaining renewed
interest as they can solve two problems at once: disposal of waste and production of energy from a
renewable resource. Many of the environmental impacts are similar to those of a coal plant: air pollution,
ash generation, etc. Because the fuel source is less standardized than coal and hazardous materials may
be present in MSW, incinerators and waste-to-energy power plants need to clean the gases of harmful
materials. The U.S. EPA regulates these plants very strictly and requires anti-pollution devices to be
installed. Also, while incinerating at high temperature many of the toxic chemicals may break down into
less harmful compounds. The ash from these plants may contain high concentrations of various metals

Environmental Biology 321

that were present in the original waste. If ash is clean enough it can be “recycled” as an MSW landfill
cover or to build roads, cement block and artificial reefs

Biofuel
Biomass refers to material made by organisms,
such as cells and tissues. In terms of energy
production, biomass is almost always derived from
plants, and to a lesser extent, algae. For biomass to be
a sustainable option, it usually needs to come from
waste material, such as lumber mill sawdust, paper
mill sludge, yard waste, or oat hulls from an oatmeal
processing plant, material that would otherwise just
rot. Livestock manure and human waste could also be
considered biomass. The use of biomass can help
mitigate climate change because when burned it adds

no new carbon to the atmosphere. Thinking back to the
woodchips, which are a type of biomass. Source:
carbon cycle (chapter 3), you will recall that
Ulrichulrich
photosynthesis removes CO2 through the process of
carbon fixation. When biomass is burnt, CO2 is
created, but this is equal to the amount of CO2 captured during carbon fixation. Thus, biomass is a
carbon neutral energy source because it doesn’t add new CO2 to the carbon cycle. Each type of biomass
must be evaluated for its environmental and social impact in order to determine if it is really advancing
sustainability and reducing environmental impacts. For example, cutting down large swaths of forests
just for energy production is not a sustainable option because our energy demands are so great that we
would quickly deforest the world, destroying critical habitat.
Burning Wood
Using wood, and charcoal made from wood, for heating and cooking can replace fossil fuels and may
result in lower CO2 emissions. If wood is harvested from forests or woodlots that have to be thinned
or from urban trees that fall down or needed be cut down anyway, then using it for biomass does not
impact those ecosystems. However, wood smoke contains harmful pollutants like carbon monoxide and
particulate matter. For home heating, it is most efficient and least polluting when using a modern wood
stove or fireplace insert that are designed to release small amounts of particulates. However, in places
where wood and charcoal are major cooking and heating fuels such as in undeveloped countries, the
wood may be harvested faster than trees can grow resulting in deforestation.
Biomass can be used in small power plants. For instance, Colgate College has had a wood-burning
boiler since the mid-1980’s and in one year it processed approximately 20,000 tons of locally and
sustainably harvested wood chips, the equivalent of 1.17 million gallons (4.43 million liters) of fuel
oil, avoiding 13,757 tons of emissions and saving the university over $1.8 million in heating costs. The
University’s steam-generating wood-burning facility now satisfies more than 75% of the campus’s heat
and domestic hot water needs.

322 Matthew R. Fisher, Editor

Landfill Gas or Biogas
Landfill gas (biogas) is a sort of man-made “biogenic” gas as discussed above. Methane is formed as
a result of biological processes in sewage treatment plants, waste landfills, anaerobic composting, and
livestock manure management systems. This gas is captured and burned to produce heat or electricity.
The electricity may replace electricity produced by burning fossil fuels and result in a net reduction in
CO2 emissions. The only environmental impacts are from the construction of the plant itself, similar to
that of a natural gas plant.
Bioethanol and Biodiesel
Bioethanol and biodiesel are liquid biofuels manufactured from plants, typically crops. Bioethanol can
be easily fermented from sugar cane juice, as is done in Brazil. Bioethanol can also be fermented from
broken down corn starch, as is mainly done in the United States. The economic and social effects of
growing plants for fuels need to be considered, since the land, fertilizers, and energy used to grow biofuel
crops could be used to grow food crops instead. The competition of land for fuel vs. food can increase
the price of food, which has a negative effect on society. It could also decrease the food supply increasing
malnutrition and starvation globally. Also, in some parts of the world, large areas of natural vegetation
and forests have been cut down to grow sugar cane for bioethanol and soybeans and palm-oil trees to
make biodiesel. This is not sustainable land use. Biofuels may be derived from parts of plants not used
for food, such as stalks, thus reducing that impact. Biodiesel can be made from used vegetable oil and
has been produced on a very local basis. Compared to petroleum diesel, biodiesel combustion produces
less sulfur oxides, particulate matter, carbon monoxide, and unburned and other hydrocarbons, but it
produces more nitrogen oxide.
Liquid biofuels typically replace petroleum and are used to power vehicles. Although ethanol-gasoline
mixtures burn cleaner than pure gasoline, they also are more volatile and thus have higher “evaporative
emissions” from fuel tanks and dispensing equipment. These emissions contribute to the formation
of harmful, ground level ozone and smog. Gasoline requires extra processing to reduce evaporative
emissions before it is blended with ethanol.

Geothermal Energy
Five percent of the United States’ renewable energy comes from geothermal energy: using the heat
of Earth’s subsurface to provide endless energy. Geothermal systems utilize a heat-exchange system
that runs in the subsurface about 20 feet (5 meters) below the surface where the ground is at a
constant temperature. The system uses the earth as a heat source (in the winter) or a heat sink (in the
summer). This reduces the energy consumption required to generate heat from gas, steam, hot water, and
conventional electric air-conditioning systems.The environmental impact of geothermal energy depends
on how it is being used. Direct use and heating applications have almost no negative impact on the
environment.
Geothermal power plants do not burn fuel to generate electricity so their emission levels are very low.
They release less than 1% of the carbon dioxide emissions of a fossil fuel plant. Geothermal plants use
scrubber systems to clean the air of hydrogen sulfide that is naturally found in the steam and hot water.
They emit 97% less acid rain-causing sulfur compounds than are emitted by fossil fuel plants. After the
steam and water from a geothermal reservoir have been used, they are injected back into the earth.

Environmental Biology 323

Solar Energy
Solar power converts the energy of light into electrical energy
and has minimal impact on the environment, depending on where it is
placed. In 2009, 1% of the renewable energy generated in the United
States was from solar power (1646 MW) out of the 8% of the total
electricity generation that was from renewable sources. The
manufacturing of photovoltaic (PV) cells generates some hazardous
waste from the chemicals and solvents used in processing. Often solar
arrays are placed on roofs of buildings or over parking lots or
integrated into construction in other ways. However, large systems
may be placed on land and particularly in deserts where those fragile
ecosystems could be damaged if care is not taken. Some solar thermal
systems use potentially hazardous fluids (to transfer heat) that require
proper handling and disposal. Concentrated solar systems may need to
be cleaned regularly with water, which is also needed for cooling the
turbine-generator. Using water from underground wells may affect the
ecosystem in some arid locations.

Wind

zero emissions. Source: Office of
Sustainability, UIC

Wind energy is a renewable energy source that is clean and has very
few environmental challenges. Wind turbines are becoming a more
prominent sight across the United States, even in regions that are
considered to have less wind potential. Wind turbines (often called windmills) do not release emissions
that pollute the air or water (with rare exceptions), and they do not require water for cooling. The U.S.
wind industry had 40,181 MW of wind power capacity installed at the end of 2010, with 5,116 MW
installed in 2010 alone, providing more than 20% of installed wind power around the globe. According
to the American Wind Energy Association, over 35% of all new electrical generating capacity in the
United States since 2006 was due to wind, surpassed only by natural gas.

324 Matthew R. Fisher, Editor

becoming a more popular source of energy in the United
States. Source: Office of Sustainability, UIC

Because a wind turbine has a small physical
footprint relative to the amount of electricity it
produces, many wind farms are located on crop
and pasture land. They contribute to economic
sustainability by providing extra income to
farmers and ranchers, allowing them to stay in
business and keep their property from being
developed for other uses. For example, energy
can be produced by installing wind turbines in the
Appalachian mountains of the United States
instead of engaging in mountain top removal for
coal mining. Offshore wind turbines on lakes or
the ocean may have smaller environmental
impacts than turbines on land.

Wind turbines do have a few environmental
challenges. There are aesthetic concerns to some
people when they see them on the landscape. A
few wind turbines have caught on fire, and some have leaked lubricating fluids, though this is relatively
rare. Some people do not like the sound that wind turbine blades make. Turbines have been found to
cause bird and bat deaths particularly if they are located along their migratory path. This is of particular
concern if these are threatened or endangered species. There are ways to mitigate that impact and it is
currently being researched. There are some small impacts from the construction of wind projects or
farms, such as the construction of service roads, the production of the turbines themselves, and the
concrete for the foundations. However, overall analysis has found that turbines make much more energy
than the amount used to make and install them.

Interest in Renewable Energy
Strong interest in renewable energy in the modern era arose in response to the oil shocks of the 1970s,
when the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) imposed oil embargos and raised
prices in pursuit of geopolitical objectives. The shortages of oil, especially gasoline for transportation,
and the eventual rise in the price of oil by a factor of approximately 10 from 1973 to 1981 disrupted
the social and economic operation of many developed countries and emphasized their precarious
dependence on foreign energy supplies. The reaction in the United States was a shift away from oil and
gas to plentiful domestic coal for electricity production and the imposition of fuel economy standards
for vehicles to reduce consumption of oil for transportation. Other developed countries without large
fossil reserves, such as France and Japan, chose to emphasize nuclear (France to the 80% level and
Japan to 30%) or to develop domestic renewable resources such as hydropower and wind (Scandinavia),
geothermal (Iceland), solar, biomass and for electricity and heat. As oil prices collapsed in the late 1980s
interest in renewables, such as wind and solar that faced significant technical and cost barriers, declined
in many countries, while other renewables, such as hydropower and biomass, continued to experience
growth.
The increasing price and volatility of oil prices since 1998, and the increasing dependence of many
developed countries on foreign oil (60% of United States and 97% of Japanese oil was imported in 2008)
spurred renewed interest in renewable alternatives to ensure energy security. A new concern, not known

Environmental Biology 325

in previous oil crises, added further motivation: our knowledge of the emission of greenhouse gases
and their growing contribution to climate change. An additional economic motivation, the high cost of
foreign oil payments to supplier countries (approximately $350 billion/year for the United States at 2011
prices), grew increasingly important as developed countries struggled to recover from the economic
recession of 2008. These energy security, carbon emission, and climate change concerns drive significant
increases in fuel economy standards, fuel switching of transportation from uncertain and volatile foreign
oil to domestic electricity and biofuels, and production of electricity from low carbon sources.
Physical Origin of Renewable Energy
Although renewable energy is often classified as hydro, solar, wind, biomass, geothermal, wave and
tide, all forms of renewable energy arise from only three sources: the light of the sun, the heat of
the earth’s crust, and the gravitational attraction of the moon and sun. Sunlight provides by far the
largest contribution to renewable energy. The sun provides the heat that drives the weather, including
the formation of high- and low-pressure areas in the atmosphere that make wind. The sun also generates
the heat required for vaporization of ocean water that ultimately falls over land creating rivers that drive
hydropower, and the sun is the energy source for photosynthesis, which creates biomass. Solar energy
can be directly captured for water and space heating, for driving conventional turbines that generate
electricity, and as excitation energy for electrons in semiconductors that drive photovoltaics. The sun
is also responsible for the energy of fossil fuels, created from the organic remains of plants and sea
organisms compressed and heated in the absence of oxygen in the earth’s crust for tens to hundreds
of millions of years. The time scale for fossil fuel regeneration, however, is too long to consider them
renewable in human terms.
Geothermal energy originates from heat rising to the surface from earth’s molten iron core created
during the formation and compression of the early earth as well as from heat produced continuously
by radioactive decay of uranium, thorium and potassium in the earth’s crust. Tidal energy arises from
the gravitational attraction of the moon and the more distant sun on the earth’s oceans, combined with
rotation of the earth. These three sources – sunlight, the heat trapped in earth’s core and continuously
generated in its crust, and gravitational force of the moon and sun on the oceans – account for all
renewable energy.
Capacity and Geographical Distribution
Although renewable energies such as wind and solar have experienced strong growth in recent years,
they still make up a small fraction of the world’s total energy needs. The largest share comes from
traditional biomass, mostly fuel wood gathered in traditional societies for household cooking and
heating, often without regard for sustainable replacement. Hydropower is the next largest contributor, an
established technology that experienced significant growth in the 20th Century. The other contributors
are more recent and smaller in contribution: water and space heating by biomass combustion or
harvesting solar and geothermal heat, biofuels derived from corn or sugar cane, and electricity generated
from wind, solar and geothermal energy. Wind and solar electricity, despite their large capacity and
significant recent growth, still contributed less than 1% of total energy in 2008.
The potential of renewable energy resources varies dramatically. Solar energy is by far the most
plentiful, delivered to the surface of the earth at a rate of 120,000 Terawatts (TW), compared to the
global human use of 15 TW. To put this in perspective, covering 100×100 km2 of desert with 10%
efficient solar cells would produce 0.29 TW of power, about 12% of the global human demand for

326 Matthew R. Fisher, Editor

electricity. To supply all of the earth’s electricity needs (2.4 TW in 2007) would require 7.5 such squares,
an area about the size of Panama (0.05% of the earth’s total land area). The world’s conventional oil
reserves are estimated at three trillion barrels, including all the oil that has already been recovered and
that remain for future recovery. The solar energy equivalent of these oil reserves is delivered to the earth
by the sun in 1.5 days.
The geographical distribution of useable renewable energy is quite uneven. Sunlight, often thought
to be relatively evenly distributed, is concentrated in deserts where cloud cover is rare. Winds are up to
50% stronger and steadier offshore than on land. Hydroelectric potential is concentrated in mountainous
regions with high rainfall and snowmelt. Biomass requires available land that does not compete with
food production, and adequate sun and rain to support growth.

11.4 Chapter Resources

Summary
We derive our energy from a multitude of resources that have varying environmental challenges related
to air and water pollution, land use, carbon dioxide emissions, resource extraction and supply, as well as
related safety and health issues. Each resource needs to be evaluated within the sustainability paradigm.
Coal (45 percent) and gas (23 percent) are the two primary fossil fuels for electricity production in
the United States. Coal combustion produces nearly twice the carbon emissions of gas combustion.
Increasing public opinion and regulatory pressure to lower carbon emissions are shifting electricity
generation toward gas and away from coal. Oil for transportation and electricity generation are the two
biggest users of primary energy and producers of carbon emissions in the United States. Transportation is
almost completely dependent on oil and internal combustion engines for its energy. The concentration of
oil in a few regions of the world creates a transportation energy security issue. Nuclear electricity offers
the sustainable benefit of low carbon electricity at the cost of storing spent fuel out of the environment
for up to hundreds of thousands of years. Reprocessing spent fuel offers the advantages of higher energy
efficiency and reduced spent fuel storage requirements with the disadvantage of higher risk of weapons
proliferation through diversion of the reprocessed fuel stream.
Strong interest in renewable energy arose in the 1970s as a response to the shortage and high price of
imported oil, which disrupted the orderly operation of the economies and societies of many developed
countries. Today there are new motivations, including the realization that growing greenhouse gas
emission accelerates global warming and threatens climate change, the growing dependence of many
countries on foreign oil, and the economic drain of foreign oil payments that slow economic growth
and job creation. There are three ultimate sources of all renewable and fossil energies: sunlight, the heat
in the earth’s core and crust, and the gravitational pull of the moon and sun on the oceans. Renewable
energies are relatively recently developed and typically operate at lower efficiencies than mature fossil
technologies. Like early fossil technologies, however, renewables can be expected to improve their
efficiency and lower their cost over time, promoting their economic competitiveness and widespread
deployment. The future deployment of renewable energies depends on many factors, including the
availability of suitable land, the technological cost of conversion to electricity or other uses, the costs of
competing energy technologies, and the future need for energy.
