their application in a particular action then pending would not be feasible or would work injustice,

foregoing amendments to existing rules, in accordance with the provisions of Title 18, U.S.C.,
§3372, and Title 28, U.S.C., §§2072 and 2075."

TITLE I. APPLICABILITY OF RULES
Rule 1. Scope of Rules; Definition; Title
(a) Scope of Rules.
(1) These rules govern procedure in the United States courts of appeals.

(2) When these rules provide for filing a motion or other document in the district court, the
procedure must comply with the practice of the district court.
(b) Definition. In these rules, 'state' 1 includes the District of Columbia and any United
States commonwealth or territory.
(c) Title. These rules are to be known as the Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure.
(As amended Apr. 30, 1979, eff. Aug. 1, 1979; Apr. 25, 1989, eff. Dec. 1, 1989; Apr. 29,
1994, eff. Dec. 1, 1994; Apr. 24, 1998, eff. Dec. 1, 1998; Apr. 29, 2002, eff. Dec. 1, 2002; Apr. 28,
2010, eff. Dec. 1, 2010.)
Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules—1967
These rules are drawn under the authority of 28 U.S.C. §2072, as amended by the Act of
November 6, 1966, 80 Stat. 1323 (1 U.S. Code Cong. & Ad. News, p. 1546 (1966)) (Rules of Civil
Procedure); 28 U.S.C. §2075 (Bankruptcy Rules); and 18 U.S.C. §§3771 (Procedure to and
including verdict) and 3772 (Procedure after verdict). Those statutes combine to give to the
Supreme Court power to make rules of practice and procedure for all cases within the jurisdiction
of the courts of appeals. By the terms of the statutes, after the rules have taken effect all laws in
conflict with them are of no further force or effect. Practice and procedure in the eleven courts of
appeals are now regulated by rules promulgated by each court under the authority of 28 U.S.C.
§2071. Rule 47 expressly authorizes the courts of appeals to make rules of practice not inconsistent
with these rules.
As indicated by the titles under which they are found, the following rules are of special
application: Rules 3 through 12 apply to appeals from judgments and orders of the district courts;
Rules 13 and 14 apply to appeals from decisions of the Tax Court (Rule 13 establishes an appeal as
the mode of review of decisions of the Tax Court in place of the present petition for review); Rules
15 through 20 apply to proceedings for review or enforcement of orders of administrative
agencies, boards, commissions and officers. Rules 22 through 24 regulate habeas corpus
proceedings and appeals in forma pauperis. All other rules apply to all proceedings in the courts of
appeals.
Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules—1979 Amendment
The Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure were designed as an integrated set of rules to be
followed in appeals to the courts of appeals, covering all steps in the appellate process, whether
they take place in the district court or in the court of appeals, and with their adoption Rules 72–76
of the F.R.C.P. were abrogated. In some instances, however, the F.R.A.P. provide that a motion or
application for relief may, or must, be made in the district court. See Rules 4(a), 10(b), and 24. The
proposed amendment would make it clear that when this is so the motion or application is to be
made in the form and manner prescribed by the F.R.C.P. or F.R.Cr.P. and local rules relating to the
form and presentation of motions and is not governed by Rule 27 of the F.R.A.P. See Rule 7(b) of
the F.R.C.P. and Rule 47 of the F.R.Cr.P.
Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules—1989 Amendment
The amendment is technical. No substantive change is intended.
Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules—1994 Amendment

Subdivision (c). A new subdivision is added to the rule. The text of new subdivision (c) has
been moved from Rule 48 to Rule 1 to allow the addition of new rules at the end of the existing set
of appellate rules without burying the title provision among other rules. In a similar fashion the
Bankruptcy Rules combine the provisions governing the scope of the rules and the title in the first
rule.
Committee Notes on Rules—1998 Amendment
The language and organization of the rule are amended to make the rule more easily
understood. In addition to changes made to improve the understanding, the Advisory Committee
has changed language to make style and terminology consistent throughout the appellate rules.
These changes are intended to be stylistic only. The Advisory Committee recommends deleting
the language in subdivision (a) that describes the different types of proceedings that may be
brought in a court of appeals. The Advisory Committee believes that the language is unnecessary
and that its omission does not work any substantive change.
Committee Notes on Rules—2002 Amendment
Subdivision (b). Two recent enactments make it likely that, in the future, one or more of the
Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure ("FRAP") will extend or limit the jurisdiction of the courts
of appeals. In 1990, Congress amended the Rules Enabling Act to give the Supreme Court
authority to use the federal rules of practice and procedure to define when a ruling of a district
court is final for purposes of 28 U.S.C. §1291. See 28 U.S.C. §2072(c). In 1992, Congress
amended 28 U.S.C. §1292 to give the Supreme Court authority to use the federal rules of practice
and procedure to provide for appeals of interlocutory decisions that are not already authorized by
28 U.S.C. §1292. See 28 U.S.C. §1292(e). Both §1291 and §1292 are unquestionably jurisdictional
statutes, and thus, as soon as FRAP is amended to define finality for purposes of the former or to
authorize interlocutory appeals not provided for by the latter, FRAP will "extend or limit the
jurisdiction of the courts of appeals," and subdivision (b) will become obsolete. For that reason,
subdivision (b) has been abrogated.
Changes Made After Publication and Comments. No changes were made to the text of the
proposed amendment or to the Committee Note.
Committee Notes on Rules—2010 Amendment
Subdivision (b). New subdivision (b) defines the term "state" to include the District of
Columbia and any commonwealth or territory of the United States. Thus, as used in these Rules,
"state" includes the District of Columbia, Guam, American Samoa, the U.S. Virgin Islands, the
Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, and the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands.
Changes Made After Publication and Comment. No changes were made after publication
and comment.

So in original.

Rule 2. Suspension of Rules

On its own or a party's motion, a court of appeals may—to expedite its decision or for other
good cause—suspend any provision of these rules in a particular case and order proceedings as it
directs, except as otherwise provided in Rule 26(b).
(As amended Apr. 24, 1998, eff. Dec. 1, 1998.)
Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules—1967
The primary purpose of this rule is to make clear the power of the courts of appeals to
expedite the determination of cases of pressing concern to the public or to the litigants by
prescribing a time schedule other than that provided by the rules. The rule also contains a general
authorization to the courts to relieve litigants of the consequences of default where manifest
injustice would otherwise result. Rule 26(b) prohibits a court of appeals from extending the time
for taking appeal or seeking review.
Committee Notes on Rules—1998 Amendment
The language of the rule is amended to make the rule more easily understood. In addition to
changes made to improve the understanding, the Advisory Committee has changed language to
make style and terminology consistent throughout the appellate rules. These changes are intended
to be stylistic only.

TITLE II. APPEAL FROM A JUDGMENT OR ORDER OF A DISTRICT
COURT
Rule 3. Appeal as of Right—How Taken
(a) Filing the Notice of Appeal.
(1) An appeal permitted by law as of right from a district court to a court of appeals may be
taken only by filing a notice of appeal with the district clerk within the time allowed by Rule 4. At
the time of filing, the appellant must furnish the clerk with enough copies of the notice to enable
the clerk to comply with Rule 3(d).
(2) An appellant's failure to take any step other than the timely filing of a notice of appeal
does not affect the validity of the appeal, but is ground only for the court of appeals to act as it
considers appropriate, including dismissing the appeal.
(3) An appeal from a judgment by a magistrate judge in a civil case is taken in the same
way as an appeal from any other district court judgment.
(4) An appeal by permission under 28 U.S.C. §1292(b) or an appeal in a bankruptcy case
may be taken only in the manner prescribed by Rules 5 and 6, respectively.
(b) Joint or Consolidated Appeals.
(1) When two or more parties are entitled to appeal from a district-court judgment or order,
and their interests make joinder practicable, they may file a joint notice of appeal. They may then
proceed on appeal as a single appellant.
(2) When the parties have filed separate timely notices of appeal, the appeals may be joined
or consolidated by the court of appeals.
(c) Contents of the Notice of Appeal.
(1) The notice of appeal must:
(A) specify the party or parties taking the appeal by naming each one in the caption or body
of the notice, but an attorney representing more than one party may describe those parties with
such terms as "all plaintiffs," "the defendants," "the plaintiffs A, B, et al.," or "all defendants
except X";
(B) designate the judgment, order, or part thereof being appealed; and
(C) name the court to which the appeal is taken.
(2) A pro se notice of appeal is considered filed on behalf of the signer and the signer's
spouse and minor children (if they are parties), unless the notice clearly indicates otherwise.
(3) In a class action, whether or not the class has been certified, the notice of appeal is
sufficient if it names one person qualified to bring the appeal as representative of the class.
(4) An appeal must not be dismissed for informality of form or title of the notice of appeal,
or for failure to name a party whose intent to appeal is otherwise clear from the notice.
(5) Form 1 in the Appendix of Forms is a suggested form of a notice of appeal.
(d) Serving the Notice of Appeal.

(1) The district clerk must serve notice of the filing of a notice of appeal by mailing a copy
to each party's counsel of record—excluding the appellant's—or, if a party is proceeding pro se, to
the party's last known address. When a defendant in a criminal case appeals, the clerk must also
serve a copy of the notice of appeal on the defendant, either by personal service or by mail
addressed to the defendant. The clerk must promptly send a copy of the notice of appeal and of the
docket entries—and any later docket entries—to the clerk of the court of appeals named in the
notice. The district clerk must note, on each copy, the date when the notice of appeal was filed.
(2) If an inmate confined in an institution files a notice of appeal in the manner provided by
Rule 4(c), the district clerk must also note the date when the clerk docketed the notice.
(3) The district clerk's failure to serve notice does not affect the validity of the appeal. The
clerk must note on the docket the names of the parties to whom the clerk mails copies, with the date
of mailing. Service is sufficient despite the death of a party or the party's counsel.
(e) Payment of Fees. Upon filing a notice of appeal, the appellant must pay the district clerk
all required fees. The district clerk receives the appellate docket fee on behalf of the court of
appeals.
(As amended Apr. 30, 1979, eff. Aug. 1, 1979; Mar. 10, 1986, eff. July 1, 1986; Apr. 25,
1989, eff. Dec. 1, 1989; Apr. 22, 1993, eff. Dec. 1, 1993; Apr. 29, 1994, eff. Dec. 1, 1994; Apr. 24,
1998, eff. Dec. 1, 1998.)
Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules—1967
General Note. Rule 3 and Rule 4 combine to require that a notice of appeal be filed with the
clerk of the district court within the time prescribed for taking an appeal. Because the timely filing
of a notice of appeal is "mandatory and jurisdictional," United States v. Robinson, 361 U.S. 220,
224, 80 S.Ct. 282, 4 L.Ed.2d 259 (1960), compliance with the provisions of those rules is of the
utmost importance. But the proposed rules merely restate, in modified form, provisions now found
in the civil and criminal rules (FRCP 5(e), 73; FRCrP 37), and decisions under the present rules
which dispense with literal compliance in cases in which it cannot fairly be exacted should control
interpretation of these rules. Illustrative decisions are: Fallen v. United States, 378 U.S. 139, 84
S.Ct. 1689, 12 L.Ed.2d 760 (1964) (notice of appeal by a prisoner, in the form of a letter delivered,
well within the time fixed for appeal, to prison authorities for mailing to the clerk of the district
court held timely filed notwithstanding that it was received by the clerk after expiration of the time
for appeal; the appellant "did all he could" to effect timely filing); Richey v. Wilkins, 335 F.2d 1 (2d
Cir. 1964) (notice filed in the court of appeals by a prisoner without assistance of counsel held
sufficient); Halfen v. United States, 324 F.2d 52 (10th Cir. 1963) (notice mailed to district judge in
time to have been received by him in normal course held sufficient); Riffle v. United States, 299
F.2d 802 (5th Cir. 1962) (letter of prisoner to judge of court of appeals held sufficient). Earlier
cases evidencing "a liberal view of papers filed by indigent and incarcerated defendants" are listed
in Coppedge v. United States, 369 U.S. 438, 442, n. 5, 82 S.Ct. 917, 8 L.Ed.2d 21 (1962).
Subdivision (a). The substance of this subdivision is derived from FRCP 73(a) and FRCrP
37(a)(1). The proposed rule follows those rules in requiring nothing other than the filing of a notice
of appeal in the district court for the perfection of the appeal. The petition for allowance (except for
appeals governed by Rules 5 and 6), citations, assignments of error, summons and severance—all
specifically abolished by earlier modern rules—are assumed to be sufficiently obsolete as no
longer to require pointed abolition.
Subdivision (b). The first sentence is derived from FRCP 74. The second sentence is added

to encourage consolidation of appeals whenever feasible.
Subdivision (c). This subdivision is identical with corresponding provisions in FRCP 73(b)
and FRCrP 37(a)(1).
Subdivision (d). This subdivision is derived from FRCP 73(b) and FRCrP 37(a)(1). The
duty of the clerk to forward a copy of the notice of appeal and of the docket entries to the court of
appeals in a criminal case extended to habeas corpus and 28 U.S.C. §2255 proceedings.
Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules—1979 Amendment
Subdivision (c). The proposed amendment would add the last sentence. Because of the fact
that the timely filing of the notice of appeal has been characterized as jurisdictional (See, e.g.,
Brainerd v. Beal (C.A. 7th, 1974) 498 F.2d 901, in which the filing of a notice of appeal one day
late was fatal), it is important that the right to appeal not be lost by mistakes of mere form. In a
number of decided cases it has been held that so long as the function of notice is met by the filing
of a paper indicating an intention to appeal, the substance of the rule has been complied with. See,
e.g., Cobb v. Lewis (C.A. 5th, 1974) 488 F.2d 41; Holley v. Capps (C.A. 5th, 1972) 468 F.2d 1366.
The proposed amendment would give recognition to this practice.
When a notice of appeal is filed, the clerk should ascertain whether any judgment
designated therein has been entered in compliance with Rules 58 and 79(a) of the F.R.C.P. See
Note to Rule 4(a)(6), infra.
Subdivision (d). The proposed amendment would extend to civil cases the present
provision applicable to criminal cases, habeas corpus cases, and proceedings under 28 U.S.C.
§2255, requiring the clerk of the district court to transmit to the clerk of the court of appeals a copy
of the notice of appeal and of the docket entries, which should include reference to compliance
with the requirements for payment of fees. See Note to (e), infra.
This requirement is the initial step in proposed changes in the rules to place in the court of
appeals an increased practical control over the early steps in the appeal.
Subdivision (e). Proposed new Rule 3(e) represents the second step in shifting to the court
of appeals the control of the early stages of an appeal. See Note to Rule 3(d) above. Under the
present rules the payment of the fee prescribed by 28 U.S.C. 1917 is not covered. Under the statute,
however, this fee is paid to the clerk of the district court at the time the notice of appeal is filed.
Under present Rule 12, the "docket fee" fixed by the Judicial Conference of the United States
under 28 U.S.C. §1913 must be paid to the clerk of the court of appeals within the time fixed for
transmission of the record, ". . . and the clerk shall thereupon enter the appeal upon the docket."
Under the proposed new Rule 3(e) both fees would be paid to the clerk of the district court
at the time the notice of appeal is filed, the clerk of the district court receiving the docket fee on
behalf of the court of appeals.
In view of the provision in Rule 3(a) that "[f]ailure of an appellant to take any step other
than the timely filing of a notice of appeal does not affect the validity of the appeal, but is ground
only for such action as the court of appeals deems appropriate, which may include dismissal of the
appeal," the case law indicates that the failure to prepay the statutory filing fee does not constitute
a jurisdictional defect. See Parissi v. Telechron, 349 U.S. 46 (1955); Gould v. Members of N. J.
Division of Water Policy & Supply, 555 F.2d 340 (3d Cir. 1977). Similarly, under present Rule 12,
failure to pay the docket fee within the time prescribed may be excused by the court of appeals.
See, e. g., Walker v. Mathews, 546 F.2d 814 (9th Cir. 1976). Proposed new Rule 3(e) adopts the
view of these cases, requiring that both fees be paid at the time the notice of appeal is filed, but
subject to the provisions of Rule 26(b) preserving the authority of the court of appeals to permit

late payment.
Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules—1986 Amendment

The amendments to Rule 3(d) are technical. No substantive change is intended.
Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules—1989 Amendment
The amendment is technical. No substantive change is intended.
Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules—1993 Amendment
Note to subdivision (c). The amendment is intended to reduce the amount of satellite
litigation spawned by the Supreme Court's decision in Torres v. Oakland Scavenger Co., 487 U.S.
312 (1988). In Torres the Supreme Court held that the language in Rule 3(c) requiring a notice of
appeal to "specify the party or parties taking the appeal" is a jurisdictional requirement and that
naming the first named party and adding "et al.," without any further specificity is insufficient to
identify the appellants. Since the Torres decision, there has been a great deal of litigation regarding
whether a notice of appeal that contains some indication of the appellants' identities but does not
name the appellants is sufficiently specific.
The amendment states a general rule that specifying the parties should be done by naming
them. Naming an appellant in an otherwise timely and proper notice of appeal ensures that the
appellant has perfected an appeal. However, in order to prevent the loss of a right to appeal through
inadvertent omission of a party's name or continued use of such terms as "et al.," which are
sufficient in all district court filings after the complaint, the amendment allows an attorney
representing more than one party the flexibility to indicate which parties are appealing without
naming them individually. The test established by the rule for determining whether such
designations are sufficient is whether it is objectively clear that a party intended to appeal. A notice
of appeal filed by a party proceeding pro se is filed on behalf of the party signing the notice and the
signer's spouse and minor children, if they are parties, unless the notice clearly indicates a contrary
intent.
In class actions, naming each member of a class as an appellant may be extraordinarily
burdensome or even impossible. In class actions if class certification has been denied, named
plaintiffs may appeal the order denying the class certification on their own behalf and on behalf of
putative class members, United States Parole Comm'n v. Geraghty, 445 U.S. 388 (1980); or if the
named plaintiffs choose not to appeal the order denying the class certification, putative class
members may appeal, United Airlines, Inc. v. McDonald, 432 U.S. 385 (1977). If no class has been
certified, naming each of the putative class members as an appellant would often be impossible.
Therefore the amendment provides that in class actions, whether or not the class has been certified,
it is sufficient for the notice to name one person qualified to bring the appeal as a representative of
the class.
Finally, the rule makes it clear that dismissal of an appeal should not occur when it is
otherwise clear from the notice that the party intended to appeal. If a court determines it is
objectively clear that a party intended to appeal, there are neither administrative concerns nor
fairness concerns that should prevent the appeal from going forward.
Note to subdivision (d). The amendment requires the district court clerk to send to the clerk
of the court of appeals a copy of every docket entry in a case after the filing of a notice of appeal.

This amendment accompanies the amendment to Rule 4(a)(4), which provides that when one of
the posttrial motions enumerated in Rule 4(a)(4) is filed, a notice of appeal filed before the
disposition of the motion becomes effective upon disposition of the motion. The court of appeals
needs to be advised that the filing of a posttrial motion has suspended a notice of appeal. The court
of appeals also needs to know when the district court has ruled on the motion. Sending copies of all
docket entries after the filing of a notice of appeal should provide the courts of appeals with the
necessary information.
Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules—1994 Amendment
Subdivision (a). The amendment requires a party filing a notice of appeal to provide the
court with sufficient copies of the notice for service on all other parties.
Committee Notes on Rules—1998 Amendment
The language and organization of the rule are amended to make the rule more easily
understood. In addition to changes made to improve the understanding, the Advisory Committee
has changed language to make style and terminology consistent throughout the appellate rules.
These changes are generally intended to be stylistic only; in this rule, however, substantive
changes are made in subdivisions (a), (b), and (d).
Subdivision (a). The provision in paragraph (a)(3) is transferred from former Rule 3.1(b).
The Federal Courts Improvement Act of 1996, Pub. L. No. 104–317, repealed paragraphs (4) and
(5) of 28 U.S.C. §636(c). That statutory change made the continued separate existence of Rule 3.1
unnecessary. New paragraph (a)(3) of this rule simply makes it clear that an appeal from a
judgment by a magistrate judge is taken in identical fashion to any other appeal from a
district-court judgment.
Subdivision (b). A joint appeal is authorized only when two or more persons may appeal
from a single judgment or order. A joint appeal is treated as a single appeal and the joint appellants
file a single brief. Under existing Rule 3(b) parties decide whether to join their appeals. They may
do so by filing a joint notice of appeal or by joining their appeals after filing separate notices of
appeal.
In consolidated appeals the separate appeals do not merge into one. The parties do not
proceed as a single appellant. Under existing Rule 3(b) it is unclear whether appeals may be
consolidated without court order if the parties stipulate to consolidation. The language resolves
that ambiguity by requiring court action.
The language also requires court action to join appeals after separate notices of appeal have
been filed.
Subdivision (d). Paragraph (d)(2) has been amended to require that when an inmate files a
notice of appeal by depositing the notice in the institution's internal mail system, the clerk must
note the docketing date—rather than the receipt date—on the notice of appeal before serving
copies of it. This change conforms to a change in Rule 4(c). Rule 4(c) is amended to provide that
when an inmate files the first notice of appeal in a civil case by depositing the notice in an
institution's internal mail system, the time for filing a cross-appeal runs from the date the district
court dockets the inmate's notice of appeal. Existing Rule 4(c) says that in such a case the time for
filing a cross-appeal runs from the date the district court receives the inmate's notice of appeal. A
court may "receive" a paper when its mail is delivered to it even if the mail is not processed for a
day or two, making the date of receipt uncertain. "Docketing" is an easily identified event. The

change is made to eliminate the uncertainty.

[Rule 3.1. Appeal from a Judgment of a Magistrate Judge in a Civil Case]
(Abrogated Apr. 24, 1998, eff. Dec. 1, 1998)
Committee Notes on Rules—1998 Amendment

The Federal Courts Improvement Act of 1996, Pub. L. No. 104–317, repealed paragraphs
(4) and (5) of 28 U.S.C. §636(c). That statutory change means that when parties consent to trial
before a magistrate judge, appeal lies directly, and as a matter of right, to the court of appeals under
§636(c)(3). The parties may not choose to appeal first to a district judge and thereafter seek
discretionary review in the court of appeals.
As a result of the statutory amendments, subdivision (a) of Rule 3.1 is no longer necessary.
Since Rule 3.1 existed primarily because of the provisions in subdivision (a), subdivision (b) has
been moved to Rule 3(a)(3) and Rule 3.1 has been abrogated.

Rule 4. Appeal as of Right—When Taken
(a) Appeal in a Civil Case.
(1) Time for Filing a Notice of Appeal.
(A) In a civil case, except as provided in Rules 4(a)(1)(B), 4(a)(4), and 4(c), the notice of
appeal required by Rule 3 must be filed with the district clerk within 30 days after entry of the
judgment or order appealed from.
(B) The notice of appeal may be filed by any party within 60 days after entry of the
judgment or order appealed from if one of the parties is:
(i) the United States;
(ii) a United States agency;
(iii) a United States officer or employee sued in an official capacity; or
(iv) a current or former United States officer or employee sued in an individual capacity for
an act or omission occurring in connection with duties performed on the United States'
behalf—including all instances in which the United States represents that person when the
judgment or order is entered or files the appeal for that person.
(C) An appeal from an order granting or denying an application for a writ of error coram
nobis is an appeal in a civil case for purposes of Rule 4(a).
(2) Filing Before Entry of Judgment. A notice of appeal filed after the court announces a
decision or order—but before the entry of the judgment or order—is treated as filed on the date of
and after the entry.
(3) Multiple Appeals. If one party timely files a notice of appeal, any other party may file a
notice of appeal within 14 days after the date when the first notice was filed, or within the time
otherwise prescribed by this Rule 4(a), whichever period ends later.
(4) Effect of a Motion on a Notice of Appeal.
(A) If a party timely files in the district court any of the following motions under the

Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, the time to file an appeal runs for all parties from the entry of the
order disposing of the last such remaining motion:
(i) for judgment under Rule 50(b);
(ii) to amend or make additional factual findings under Rule 52(b), whether or not granting
the motion would alter the judgment;
(iii) for attorney's fees under Rule 54 if the district court extends the time to appeal under
Rule 58;
(iv) to alter or amend the judgment under Rule 59;
(v) for a new trial under Rule 59; or
(vi) for relief under Rule 60 if the motion is filed no later than 28 days after the judgment is
entered.
(B)(i) If a party files a notice of appeal after the court announces or enters a judgment—but
before it disposes of any motion listed in Rule 4(a)(4)(A)—the notice becomes effective to appeal
a judgment or order, in whole or in part, when the order disposing of the last such remaining
motion is entered.
(ii) A party intending to challenge an order disposing of any motion listed in Rule
4(a)(4)(A), or a judgment's alteration or amendment upon such a motion, must file a notice of
appeal, or an amended notice of appeal—in compliance with Rule 3(c)—within the time
prescribed by this Rule measured from the entry of the order disposing of the last such remaining
motion.
(5) Motion for Extension of Time.
(A) The district court may extend the time to file a notice of appeal if:
(i) a party so moves no later than 30 days after the time prescribed by this Rule 4(a) expires;
and
(ii) regardless of whether its motion is filed before or during the 30 days after the time
prescribed by this Rule 4(a) expires, that party shows excusable neglect or good cause.
(B) A motion filed before the expiration of the time prescribed in Rule 4(a)(1) or (3) may
be ex parte unless the court requires otherwise. If the motion is filed after the expiration of the
prescribed time, notice must be given to the other parties in accordance with local rules.
(C) No extension under this Rule 4(a)(5) may exceed 30 days after the prescribed time or
14 days after the date when the order granting the motion is entered, whichever is later.
(6) Reopening the Time to File an Appeal. The district court may reopen the time to file an
appeal for a period of 14 days after the date when its order to reopen is entered, but only if all the
following conditions are satisfied:
(A) the court finds that the moving party did not receive notice under Federal Rule of Civil
Procedure 77(d) of the entry of the judgment or order sought to be appealed within 21 days after
entry;
(B) the motion is filed within 180 days after the judgment or order is entered or within 14
days after the moving party receives notice under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 77(d) of the
entry, whichever is earlier; and
(C) the court finds that no party would be prejudiced.

(7) Entry Defined.
(A) A judgment or order is entered for purposes of this Rule 4(a):
(i) if Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 58(a) does not require a separate document, when the
judgment or order is entered in the civil docket under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 79(a); or
(ii) if Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 58(a) requires a separate document, when the
judgment or order is entered in the civil docket under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 79(a) and
when the earlier of these events occurs:
• the judgment or order is set forth on a separate document, or
• 150 days have run from entry of the judgment or order in the civil docket under Federal
Rule of Civil Procedure 79(a).
(B) A failure to set forth a judgment or order on a separate document when required by
Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 58(a) does not affect the validity of an appeal from that judgment
or order.
(b) Appeal in a Criminal Case.
(1) Time for Filing a Notice of Appeal.
(A) In a criminal case, a defendant's notice of appeal must be filed in the district court
within 14 days after the later of:
(i) the entry of either the judgment or the order being appealed; or
(ii) the filing of the government's notice of appeal.
(B) When the government is entitled to appeal, its notice of appeal must be filed in the
district court within 30 days after the later of:
(i) the entry of the judgment or order being appealed; or
(ii) the filing of a notice of appeal by any defendant.
(2) Filing Before Entry of Judgment. A notice of appeal filed after the court announces a
decision, sentence, or order—but before the entry of the judgment or order—is treated as filed on
the date of and after the entry.
(3) Effect of a Motion on a Notice of Appeal.
(A) If a defendant timely makes any of the following motions under the Federal Rules of
Criminal Procedure, the notice of appeal from a judgment of conviction must be filed within 14
days after the entry of the order disposing of the last such remaining motion, or within 14 days
after the entry of the judgment of conviction, whichever period ends later. This provision applies to
a timely motion:
(i) for judgment of acquittal under Rule 29;
(ii) for a new trial under Rule 33, but if based on newly discovered evidence, only if the
motion is made no later than 14 days after the entry of the judgment; or
(iii) for arrest of judgment under Rule 34.
(B) A notice of appeal filed after the court announces a decision, sentence, or order—but
before it disposes of any of the motions referred to in Rule 4(b)(3)(A)—becomes effective upon
the later of the following:
(i) the entry of the order disposing of the last such remaining motion; or
(ii) the entry of the judgment of conviction.

(C) A valid notice of appeal is effective—without amendment—to appeal from an order
disposing of any of the motions referred to in Rule 4(b)(3)(A).
(4) Motion for Extension of Time. Upon a finding of excusable neglect or good cause, the
district court may—before or after the time has expired, with or without motion and
notice—extend the time to file a notice of appeal for a period not to exceed 30 days from the
expiration of the time otherwise prescribed by this Rule 4(b).
(5) Jurisdiction. The filing of a notice of appeal under this Rule 4(b) does not divest a
district court of jurisdiction to correct a sentence under Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 35(a),
nor does the filing of a motion under 35(a) affect the validity of a notice of appeal filed before
entry of the order disposing of the motion. The filing of a motion under Federal Rule of Criminal
Procedure 35(a) does not suspend the time for filing a notice of appeal from a judgment of
conviction.
(6) Entry Defined. A judgment or order is entered for purposes of this Rule 4(b) when it is
entered on the criminal docket.
(c) Appeal by an Inmate Confined in an Institution.
(1) If an inmate confined in an institution files a notice of appeal in either a civil or a
criminal case, the notice is timely if it is deposited in the institution's internal mail system on or
before the last day for filing. If an institution has a system designed for legal mail, the inmate must
use that system to receive the benefit of this rule. Timely filing may be shown by a declaration in
compliance with 28 U.S.C. §1746 or by a notarized statement, either of which must set forth the
date of deposit and state that first-class postage has been prepaid.
(2) If an inmate files the first notice of appeal in a civil case under this Rule 4(c), the 14-day
period provided in Rule 4(a)(3) for another party to file a notice of appeal runs from the date when
the district court dockets the first notice.
(3) When a defendant in a criminal case files a notice of appeal under this Rule 4(c), the
30-day period for the government to file its notice of appeal runs from the entry of the judgment or
order appealed from or from the district court's docketing of the defendant's notice of appeal,
whichever is later.
(d) Mistaken Filing in the Court of Appeals. If a notice of appeal in either a civil or a
criminal case is mistakenly filed in the court of appeals, the clerk of that court must note on the
notice the date when it was received and send it to the district clerk. The notice is then considered
filed in the district court on the date so noted.

Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules—1967
Subdivision (a). This subdivision is derived from FRCP 73(a) without any change of
substance. The requirement that a request for an extension of time for filing the notice of appeal
made after expiration of the time be made by motion and on notice codifies the result reached

under the present provisions of FRCP 73(a) and 6(b). North Umberland Mining Co. v. Standard
Accident Ins. Co., 193 F.2d 951 (9th Cir., 1952); Cohen v. Plateau Natural Gas Co., 303 F.2d 273
(10th Cir., 1962); Plant Economy, Inc. v. Mirror Insulation Co., 308 F.2d 275 (3d Cir., 1962).
Since this subdivision governs appeals in all civil cases, it supersedes the provisions of
section 25 of the Bankruptcy Act (11 U.S.C. §48). Except in cases to which the United States or an
officer or agency thereof is a party, the change is a minor one, since a successful litigant in a
bankruptcy proceeding may, under section 25, oblige an aggrieved party to appeal within 30 days
after entry of judgment—the time fixed by this subdivision in cases involving private parties
only—by serving him with notice of entry on the day thereof, and by the terms of section 25 an
aggrieved party must in any event appeal within 40 days after entry of judgment. No reason
appears why the time for appeal in bankruptcy should not be the same as that in civil cases
generally. Furthermore, section 25 is a potential trap for the uninitiated. The time for appeal which
it provides is not applicable to all appeals which may fairly be termed appeals in bankruptcy.
Section 25 governs only those cases referred to in section 24 as "proceedings in bankruptcy" and
"controversies arising in proceedings in bankruptcy." Lowenstein v. Reikes, 54 F.2d 481 (2d Cir.,
1931), cert. den., 285 U.S. 539, 52 S.Ct. 311, 76 L.Ed. 932 (1932). The distinction between such
cases and other cases which arise out of bankruptcy is often difficult to determine. See 2 Moore's
Collier on Bankruptcy 24.12 through 24.36 (1962). As a result it is not always clear whether an
appeal is governed by section 25 or by FRCP 73(a), which is applicable to such appeals in
bankruptcy as are not governed by section 25.
In view of the unification of the civil and admiralty procedure accomplished by the
amendments of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure effective July 1, 1966, this subdivision
governs appeals in those civil actions which involve admiralty or maritime claims and which prior
to that date were known as suits in admiralty.
The only other change possibly effected by this subdivision is in the time for appeal from a
decision of a district court on a petition for impeachment of an award of a board of arbitration
under the Act of May 20, 1926, c. 347, §9 (44 Stat. 585), 45 U.S.C. §159. The act provides that a
notice of appeal from such a decision shall be filed within 10 days of the decision. This singular
provision was apparently repealed by the enactment in 1948 of 28 U.S.C. §2107, which fixed 30
days from the date of entry of judgment as the time for appeal in all actions of a civil nature except
actions in admiralty or bankruptcy matters or those in which the United States is a party. But it was
not expressly repealed, and its status is in doubt. See 7 Moore's Federal Practice 73.09[2] (1966).
The doubt should be resolved, and no reason appears why appeals in such cases should not be
taken within the time provided for civil cases generally.
Subdivision (b). This subdivision is derived from FRCrP 37(a)(2) without change of
substance.
Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules—1979 Amendment
Subdivision (a)(1). The words "(including a civil action which involves an admiralty or
maritime claim and a proceeding in bankruptcy or a controversy arising therein)," which appear in
the present rule are struck out as unnecessary and perhaps misleading in suggesting that there may
be other categories that are not either civil or criminal within the meaning of Rule 4(a) and (b).
The phrases "within 30 days of such entry" and "within 60 days of such entry" have been
changed to read "after" instead of "or." The change is for clarity only, since the word "of" in the
present rule appears to be used to mean "after." Since the proposed amended rule deals directly
with the premature filing of a notice of appeal, it was thought useful to emphasize the fact that

except as provided, the period during which a notice of appeal may be filed is the 30 days, or 60
days as the case may be, following the entry of the judgment or order appealed from. See Notes to
Rule 4(a)(2) and (4), below.
Subdivision (a)(2). The proposed amendment to Rule 4(a)(2) would extend to civil cases
the provisions of Rule 4(b), dealing with criminal cases, designed to avoid the loss of the right to
appeal by filing the notice of appeal prematurely. Despite the absence of such a provision in Rule
4(a) the courts of appeals quite generally have held premature appeals effective. See, e. g., Matter
of Grand Jury Empanelled Jan. 21, 1975, 541 F.2d 373 (3d Cir. 1976); Hodge v. Hodge, 507 F.2d
87 (3d Cir. 1976); Song Jook Suh v. Rosenberg, 437 F.2d 1098 (9th Cir. 1971); Ruby v. Secretary
of the Navy, 365 F.2d 385 (9th Cir. 1966); Firchau v. Diamond Nat'l Corp., 345 F.2d 469 (9th Cir.
1965).
The proposed amended rule would recognize this practice but make an exception in cases
in which a post trial motion has destroyed the finality of the judgment. See Note to Rule 4(a)(4)
below.
Subdivision (a)(4). The proposed amendment would make it clear that after the filing of the
specified post trial motions, a notice of appeal should await disposition of the motion. Since the
proposed amendments to Rules 3, 10, and 12 contemplate that immediately upon the filing of the
notice of appeal the fees will be paid and the case docketed in the court of appeals, and the steps
toward its disposition set in motion, it would be undesirable to proceed with the appeal while the
district court has before it a motion the granting of which would vacate or alter the judgment
appealed from. See, e. g., Kieth v. Newcourt, 530 F.2d 826 (8th Cir. 1976). Under the present rule,
since docketing may not take place until the record is transmitted, premature filing is much less
likely to involve waste effort. See, e. g., Stokes v. Peyton's Inc., 508 F.2d 1287 (5th Cir. 1975).
Further, since a notice of appeal filed before the disposition of a post trial motion, even if it were
treated as valid for purposes of jurisdiction, would not embrace objections to the denial of the
motion, it is obviously preferable to postpone the notice of appeal until after the motion is disposed
of.
The present rule, since it provides for the "termination" of the "running" of the appeal time,
is ambiguous in its application to a notice of appeal filed prior to a post trial motion filed within the
10 day limit. The amendment would make it clear that in such circumstances the appellant should
not proceed with the appeal during pendency of the motion but should file a new notice of appeal
after the motion is disposed of.
Subdivision (a)(5). Under the present rule it is provided that upon a showing of excusable
neglect the district court at any time may extend the time for the filing of a notice of appeal for a
period not to exceed 30 days from the expiration of the time otherwise prescribed by the rule, but
that if the application is made after the original time has run, the order may be made only on
motion with such notice as the court deems appropriate.
A literal reading of this provision would require that the extension be ordered and the
notice of appeal filed within the 30 day period, but despite the surface clarity of the rule, it has
produced considerable confusion. See the discussion by Judge Friendly in In re Orbitek, 520 F.2d
358 (2d Cir. 1975). The proposed amendment would make it clear that a motion to extend the time
must be filed no later than 30 days after the expiration of the original appeal time, and that if the
motion is timely filed the district court may act upon the motion at a later date, and may extend the
time not in excess of 10 days measured from the date on which the order granting the motion is
entered.
Under the present rule there is a possible implication that prior to the time the initial appeal

time has run, the district court may extend the time on the basis of an informal application. The
amendment would require that the application must be made by motion, though the motion may be
made ex parte. After the expiration of the initial time a motion for the extension of the time must be
made in compliance with the F.R.C.P. and local rules of the district court. See Note to proposed
amended Rule 1, supra. And see Rules 6(d), 7(b) of the F.R.C.P.
The proposed amended rule expands to some extent the standard for the grant of an
extension of time. The present rule requires a "showing of excusable neglect." While this was an
appropriate standard in cases in which the motion is made after the time for filing the notice of
appeal has run, and remains so, it has never fit exactly the situation in which the appellant seeks an
extension before the expiration of the initial time. In such a case "good cause," which is the
standard that is applied in the granting of other extensions of time under Rule 26(b) seems to be
more appropriate.
Subdivision (a)(6). The proposed amendment would call attention to the requirement of
Rule 58 of the F.R.C.P. that the judgment constitute a separate document. See United States v.
Indrelunas, 411 U.S. 216 (1973). When a notice of appeal is filed, the clerk should ascertain
whether any judgment designated therein has been entered in compliance with Rules 58 and 79(a)
and if not, so advise all parties and the district judge. While the requirement of Rule 48 is not
jurisdictional (see Bankers Trust Co. v. Mallis, 431 U.S. 928 (1977)), compliance is important
since the time for the filing of a notice of appeal by other parties is measured by the time at which
the judgment is properly entered.
Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules—1991 Amendment
The amendment provides a limited opportunity for relief in circumstances where the notice
of entry of a judgment or order, required to be mailed by the clerk of the district court pursuant to
Rule 77(d) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, is either not received by a party or is received
so late as to impair the opportunity to file a timely notice of appeal. The amendment adds a new
subdivision (6) allowing a district court to reopen for a brief period the time for appeal upon a
finding that notice of entry of a judgment or order was not received from the clerk or a party within
21 days of its entry and that no party would be prejudiced. By "prejudice" the Committee means
some adverse consequence other than the cost of having to oppose the appeal and encounter the
risk of reversal, consequences that are present in every appeal. Prejudice might arise, for example,
if the appellee had taken some action in reliance on the expiration of the normal time period for
filing a notice of appeal.
Reopening may be ordered only upon a motion filed within 180 days of the entry of a
judgment or order or within 7 days of receipt of notice of such entry, whichever is earlier. This
provision establishes an outer time limit of 180 days for a party who fails to receive timely notice
of entry of a judgment to seek additional time to appeal and enables any winning party to shorten
the 180-day period by sending (and establishing proof of receipt of) its own notice of entry of a
judgment, as authorized by Fed. R. Civ. P. 77(d). Winning parties are encouraged to send their
own notice in order to lessen the chance that a judge will accept a claim of non-receipt in the face
of evidence that notices were sent by both the clerk and the winning party. Receipt of a winning
party's notice will shorten only the time for reopening the time for appeal under this subdivision,
leaving the normal time periods for appeal unaffected.
If the motion is granted, the district court may reopen the time for filing a notice of appeal
only for a period of 14 days from the date of entry of the order reopening the time for appeal.
Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules—1993 Amendment

Note to Paragraph (a)(1). The amendment is intended to alert readers to the fact that
paragraph (a)(4) extends the time for filing an appeal when certain posttrial motions are filed. The
Committee hopes that awareness of the provisions of paragraph (a)(4) will prevent the filing of a
notice of appeal when a posttrial tolling motion is pending.
Note to Paragraph (a)(2). The amendment treats a notice of appeal filed after the
announcement of a decision or order, but before its formal entry, as if the notice had been filed
after entry. The amendment deletes the language that made paragraph (a)(2) inapplicable to a
notice of appeal filed after announcement of the disposition of a posttrial motion enumerated in
paragraph (a)(4) but before the entry of the order, see Acosta v. Louisiana Dep't of Health &
Human Resources, 478 U.S. 251 (1986) (per curiam); Alerte v. McGinnis, 898 F.2d 69 (7th Cir.
1990). Because the amendment of paragraph (a)(4) recognizes all notices of appeal filed after
announcement or entry of judgment—even those that are filed while the posttrial motions
enumerated in paragraph (a)(4) are pending—the amendment of this paragraph is consistent with
the amendment of paragraph (a)(4).
Note to Paragraph (a)(3). The amendment is technical in nature; no substantive change is
intended.
Note to Paragraph (a)(4). The 1979 amendment of this paragraph created a trap for an
unsuspecting litigant who files a notice of appeal before a posttrial motion, or while a posttrial
motion is pending. The 1979 amendment requires a party to file a new notice of appeal after the
motion's disposition. Unless a new notice is filed, the court of appeals lacks jurisdiction to hear the
appeal. Griggs v. Provident Consumer Discount Co., 459 U.S. 56 (1982). Many litigants,
especially pro se litigants, fail to file the second notice of appeal, and several courts have expressed
dissatisfaction with the rule. See, e.g., Averhart v. Arrendondo, 773 F.2d 919 (7th Cir. 1985);
Harcon Barge Co. v. D & G Boat Rentals, Inc., 746 F.2d 278 (5th Cir. 1984), cert. denied, 479
U.S. 930 (1986).
The amendment provides that a notice of appeal filed before the disposition of a specified
posttrial motion will become effective upon disposition of the motion. A notice filed before the
filing of one of the specified motions or after the filing of a motion but before disposition of the
motion is, in effect, suspended until the motion is disposed of, whereupon, the previously filed
notice effectively places jurisdiction in the court of appeals.
Because a notice of appeal will ripen into an effective appeal upon disposition of a posttrial
motion, in some instances there will be an appeal from a judgment that has been altered
substantially because the motion was granted in whole or in part. Many such appeals will be
dismissed for want of prosecution when the appellant fails to meet the briefing schedule. But, the
appellee may also move to strike the appeal. When responding to such a motion, the appellant
would have an opportunity to state that, even though some relief sought in a posttrial motion was
granted, the appellant still plans to pursue the appeal. Because the appellant's response would
provide the appellee with sufficient notice of the appellant's intentions, the Committee does not
believe that an additional notice of appeal is needed.
The amendment provides that a notice of appeal filed before the disposition of a posttrial
tolling motion is sufficient to bring the underlying case, as well as any orders specified in the
original notice, to the court of appeals. If the judgment is altered upon disposition of a posttrial
motion, however, and if a party wishes to appeal from the disposition of the motion, the party must
amend the notice to so indicate. When a party files an amended notice, no additional fees are
required because the notice is an amendment of the original and not a new notice of appeal.

Paragraph (a)(4) is also amended to include, among motions that extend the time for filing
a notice of appeal, a Rule 60 motion that is served within 10 days after entry of judgment. This
eliminates the difficulty of determining whether a posttrial motion made within 10 days after entry
of a judgment is a Rule 59(e) motion, which tolls the time for filing an appeal, or a Rule 60 motion,
which historically has not tolled the time. The amendment comports with the practice in several
circuits of treating all motions to alter or amend judgments that are made within 10 days after entry
of judgment as Rule 59(e) motions for purposes of Rule 4(a)(4). See, e.g., Finch v. City of Vernon,
845 F.2d 256 (11th Cir. 1988); Rados v. Celotex Corp., 809 F.2d 170 (2d Cir. 1986); Skagerberg v.
Oklahoma, 797 F.2d 881 (10th Cir. 1986). To conform to a recent Supreme Court decision,
however—Budinich v. Becton Dickinson and Co., 486 U.S. 196 (1988)—the amendment excludes
motions for attorney's fees from the class of motions that extend the filing time unless a district
court, acting under Rule 58, enters an order extending the time for appeal. This amendment is to be
read in conjunction with the amendment of Fed. R. Civ. P. 58.
Note to subdivision (b). The amendment grammatically restructures the portion of this
subdivision that lists the types of motions that toll the time for filing an appeal. This restructuring
is intended to make the rule easier to read. No substantive change is intended other than to add a
motion for judgment of acquittal under Criminal Rule 29 to the list of tolling motions. Such a
motion is the equivalent of a Fed. R. Civ. P. 50(b) motion for judgment notwithstanding the
verdict, which tolls the running of time for an appeal in a civil case.
The proposed amendment also eliminates an ambiguity from the third sentence of this
subdivision. Prior to this amendment, the third sentence provided that if one of the specified
motions was filed, the time for filing an appeal would run from the entry of an order denying the
motion. That sentence, like the parallel provision in Rule 4(a)(4), was intended to toll the running
of time for appeal if one of the posttrial motions is timely filed. In a criminal case, however, the
time for filing the motions runs not from entry of judgment (as it does in civil cases), but from the
verdict or finding of guilt. Thus, in a criminal case, a posttrial motion may be disposed of more
than 10 days before sentence is imposed, i.e. before the entry of judgment. United States v.
Hashagen, 816 F.2d 899, 902 n.5 (3d Cir. 1987). To make it clear that a notice of appeal need not
be filed before entry of judgment, the amendment states that an appeal may be taken within 10
days after the entry of an order disposing of the motion, or within 10 days after the entry of
judgment, whichever is later. The amendment also changes the language in the third sentence
providing that an appeal may be taken within 10 days after the entry of an order denying the
motion; the amendment says instead that an appeal may be taken within 10 days after the entry of
an order disposing of the last such motion outstanding. (Emphasis added) The change recognizes
that there may be multiple posttrial motions filed and that, although one or more motions may be
granted in whole or in part, a defendant may still wish to pursue an appeal.
The amendment also states that a notice of appeal filed before the disposition of any of the
posttrial tolling motions becomes effective upon disposition of the motions. In most circuits this
language simply restates the current practice. See United States v. Cortes, 895 F.2d 1245 (9th Cir.),
cert. denied, 495 U.S. 939 (1990). Two circuits, however, have questioned that practice in light of
the language of the rule, see United States v. Gargano, 826 F.2d 610 (7th Cir. 1987), and United
States v. Jones, 669 F.2d 559 (8th Cir. 1982), and the Committee wishes to clarify the rule. The
amendment is consistent with the proposed amendment of Rule 4(a)(4).
Subdivision (b) is further amended in light of new Fed. R. Crim. P. 35(c), which authorizes
a sentencing court to correct any arithmetical, technical, or other clear errors in sentencing within 7
days after imposing the sentence. The Committee believes that a sentencing court should be able to

act under Criminal Rule 35(c) even if a notice of appeal has already been filed; and that a notice of
appeal should not be affected by the filing of a Rule 35(c) motion or by correction of a sentence
under Rule 35(c).
Note to subdivision (c). In Houston v. Lack, 487 U.S. 266 (1988), the Supreme Court held
that a pro se prisoner's notice of appeal is "filed" at the moment of delivery to prison authorities for
forwarding to the district court. The amendment reflects that decision. The language of the
amendment is similar to that in Supreme Court Rule 29.2.
Permitting an inmate to file a notice of appeal by depositing it in an institutional mail
system requires adjustment of the rules governing the filing of cross-appeals. In a civil case, the
time for filing a cross-appeal ordinarily runs from the date when the first notice of appeal is filed. If
an inmate's notice of appeal is filed by depositing it in an institution's mail system, it is possible
that the notice of appeal will not arrive in the district court until several days after the "filing" date
and perhaps even after the time for filing a cross-appeal has expired. To avoid that problem,
subdivision (c) provides that in a civil case when an institutionalized person files a notice of appeal
by depositing it in the institution's mail system, the time for filing a cross-appeal runs from the
district court's receipt of the notice. The amendment makes a parallel change regarding the time for
the government to appeal in a criminal case.
Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules—1995 Amendment
Subdivision (a). Fed. R. Civ. P. 50, 52, and 59 were previously inconsistent with respect to
whether certain postjudgment motions had to be filed or merely served no later than 10 days after
entry of judgment. As a consequence Rule 4(a)(4) spoke of making or serving such motions rather
than filing them. Civil Rules 50, 52, and 59, are being revised to require filing before the end of the
10-day period. As a consequence, this rule is being amended to provide that "filing" must occur
within the 10 day period in order to affect the finality of the judgment and extend the period for
filing a notice of appeal.
The Civil Rules require the filing of postjudgment motions "no later than 10 days after
entry of judgment"—rather than "within" 10 days—to include postjudgment motions that are filed
before actual entry of the judgment by the clerk. This rule is amended, therefore, to use the same
terminology.
The rule is further amended to clarify the fact that a party who wants to obtain review of an
alteration or amendment of a judgment must file a notice of appeal or amend a previously filed
notice to indicate intent to appeal from the altered judgment.
Committee Notes on Rules—1998 Amendment
The language and organization of the rule are amended to make the rule more easily
understood. In addition to changes made to improve the understanding, the Advisory Committee
has changed language to make style and terminology consistent throughout the appellate rules.
These changes are intended to be stylistic only; in this rule, however, substantive changes are made
in paragraphs (a)(6) and (b)(4), and in subdivision (c).
Subdivision (a), paragraph (1). Although the Advisory Committee does not intend to make
any substantive changes in this paragraph, cross-references to Rules 4(a)(1)(B) and 4(c) have been
added to subparagraph (a)(1)(A).
Subdivision (a), paragraph (4). Item (vi) in subparagraph (A) of Rule 4(a)(4) provides that
filing a motion for relief under Fed. R. Civ. P. 60 will extend the time for filing a notice of appeal

if the Rule 60 motion is filed no later than 10 days after judgment is entered. Again, the Advisory
Committee does not intend to make any substantive change in this paragraph. But because Fed. R.
Civ. P. 6(a) and Fed. R. App. P. 26(a) have different methods for computing time, one might be
uncertain whether the 10-day period referred to in Rule 4(a)(4) is computed using Civil Rule 6(a)
or Appellate Rule 26(a). Because the Rule 60 motion is filed in the district court, and because Fed.
R. App. P. 1(a)(2) says that when the appellate rules provide for filing a motion in the district court,
"the procedure must comply with the practice of the district court," the rule provides that the
10-day period is computed using Fed. R. Civ. P. 6(a).
Subdivision (a), paragraph (6). Paragraph (6) permits a district court to reopen the time for
appeal if a party has not received notice of the entry of judgment and no party would be prejudiced
by the reopening. Before reopening the time for appeal, the existing rule requires the district court
to find that the moving party was entitled to notice of the entry of judgment and did not receive it
"from the clerk or any party within 21 days of its entry." The Advisory Committee makes a
substantive change. The finding must be that the movant did not receive notice "from the district
court or any party within 21 days after entry." This change broadens the type of notice that can
preclude reopening the time for appeal. The existing rule provides that only notice from a party or
from the clerk bars reopening. The new language precludes reopening if the movant has received
notice from "the court."
Subdivision (b). Two substantive changes are made in what will be paragraph (b)(4). The
current rule permits an extension of time to file a notice of appeal if there is a "showing of
excusable neglect." First, the rule is amended to permit a court to extend the time for "good cause"
as well as for excusable neglect. Rule 4(a) permits extensions for both reasons in civil cases and
the Advisory Committee believes that "good cause" should be sufficient in criminal cases as well.
The amendment does not limit extensions for good cause to instances in which the motion for
extension of time is filed before the original time has expired. The rule gives the district court
discretion to grant extensions for good cause whenever the court believes it appropriate to do so
provided that the extended period does not exceed 30 days after the expiration of the time
otherwise prescribed by Rule 4(b). Second, paragraph (b)(4) is amended to require only a "finding"
of excusable neglect or good cause and not a "showing" of them. Because the rule authorizes the
court to provide an extension without a motion, a "showing" is obviously not required; a "finding"
is sufficient.
Subdivision (c). Substantive amendments are made in this subdivision. The current rule
provides that if an inmate confined in an institution files a notice of appeal by depositing it in the
institution's internal mail system, the notice is timely filed if deposited on or before the last day for
filing. Some institutions have special internal mail systems for handling legal mail; such systems
often record the date of deposit of mail by an inmate, the date of delivery of mail to an inmate, etc.
The Advisory Committee amends the rule to require an inmate to use the system designed for legal
mail, if there is one, in order to receive the benefit of this subdivision.
When an inmate uses the filing method authorized by subdivision (c), the current rule
provides that the time for other parties to appeal begins to run from the date the district court
"receives" the inmate's notice of appeal. The rule is amended so that the time for other parties
begins to run when the district court "dockets" the inmate's appeal. A court may "receive" a paper
when its mail is delivered to it even if the mail is not processed for a day or two, making the date of
receipt uncertain. "Docketing" is an easily identified event. The change eliminates uncertainty.
Paragraph (c)(3) is further amended to make it clear that the time for the government to file its
appeal runs from the later of the entry of the judgment or order appealed from or the district court's

docketing of a defendant's notice filed under this paragraph (c).
Committee Notes on Rules—2002 Amendment
Subdivision (a)(1)(C). The federal courts of appeals have reached conflicting conclusions
about whether an appeal from an order granting or denying an application for a writ of error coram
nobis is governed by the time limitations of Rule 4(a) (which apply in civil cases) or by the time
limitations of Rule 4(b) (which apply in criminal cases). Compare United States v. Craig, 907 F.2d
653, 655–57, amended 919 F.2d 57 (7th Cir. 1990); United States v. Cooper, 876 F.2d 1192, 1193–
94 (5th Cir. 1989); and United States v. Keogh, 391 F.2d 138, 140 (2d Cir. 1968) (applying the
time limitations of Rule 4(a)); with Yasui v. United States, 772 F.2d 1496, 1498–99 (9th Cir.
1985); and United States v. Mills, 430 F.2d 526, 527–28 (8th Cir. 1970) (applying the time
limitations of Rule 4(b)). A new part (C) has been added to Rule 4(a)(1) to resolve this conflict by
providing that the time limitations of Rule 4(a) will apply.
Subsequent to the enactment of Fed. R. Civ. P. 60(b) and 28 U.S.C. §2255, the Supreme
Court has recognized the continued availability of a writ of error coram nobis in at least one
narrow circumstance. In 1954, the Court permitted a litigant who had been convicted of a crime,
served his full sentence, and been released from prison, but who was continuing to suffer a legal
disability on account of the conviction, to seek a writ of error coram nobis to set aside the
conviction. United States v. Morgan, 346 U.S. 502 (1954). As the Court recognized, in the Morgan
situation an application for a writ of error coram nobis "is of the same general character as [a
motion] under 28 U.S.C. §2255." Id. at 506 n.4. Thus, it seems appropriate that the time limitations
of Rule 4(a), which apply when a district court grants or denies relief under 28 U.S.C. §2255,
should also apply when a district court grants or denies a writ of error coram nobis. In addition, the
strong public interest in the speedy resolution of criminal appeals that is reflected in the shortened
deadlines of Rule 4(b) is not present in the Morgan situation, as the party seeking the writ of error
coram nobis has already served his or her full sentence.
Notwithstanding Morgan, it is not clear whether the Supreme Court continues to believe
that the writ of error coram nobis is available in federal court. In civil cases, the writ has been
expressly abolished by Fed. R. Civ. P. 60(b). In criminal cases, the Supreme Court has recently
stated that it has become " 'difficult to conceive of a situation' " in which the writ " 'would be
necessary or appropriate.' " Carlisle v. United States, 517 U.S. 416, 429 (1996) (quoting United
States v. Smith, 331 U.S. 469, 475 n.4 (1947)). The amendment to Rule 4(a)(1) is not intended to
express any view on this issue; rather, it is merely meant to specify time limitations for appeals.
Rule 4(a)(1)(C) applies only to motions that are in substance, and not merely in form,
applications for writs of error coram nobis. Litigants may bring and label as applications for a writ
of error coram nobis what are in reality motions for a new trial under Fed. R. Crim. P. 33 or
motions for correction or reduction of a sentence under Fed. R. Crim. P. 35. In such cases, the time
limitations of Rule 4(b), and not those of Rule 4(a), should be enforced.
Changes Made After Publication and Comments. No changes were made to the text of the
proposed amendment or to the Committee Note.
Subdivision (a)(4)(A)(vi). Rule 4(a)(4)(A)(vi) has been amended to remove a parenthetical
that directed that the 10-day deadline be "computed using Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 6(a)."
That parenthetical has become superfluous because Rule 26(a)(2) has been amended to require that
all deadlines under 11 days be calculated as they are under Fed. R. Civ. P. 6(a).
Changes Made After Publication and Comments. No changes were made to the text of the
proposed amendment or to the Committee Note.

Subdivision (a)(5)(A)(ii). Rule 4(a)(5)(A) permits the district court to extend the time to
file a notice of appeal if two conditions are met. First, the party seeking the extension must file its
motion no later than 30 days after the expiration of the time originally prescribed by Rule 4(a).
Second, the party seeking the extension must show either excusable neglect or good cause. The
text of Rule 4(a)(5)(A) does not distinguish between motions filed prior to the expiration of the
original deadline and those filed after the expiration of the original deadline. Regardless of
whether the motion is filed before or during the 30 days after the original deadline expires, the
district court may grant an extension if a party shows either excusable neglect or good cause.
Despite the text of Rule 4(a)(5)(A), most of the courts of appeals have held that the good
cause standard applies only to motions brought prior to the expiration of the original deadline and
that the excusable neglect standard applies only to motions brought during the 30 days following
the expiration of the original deadline. See Pontarelli v. Stone, 930 F.2d 104, 109–10 (1st Cir.
1991) (collecting cases from the Second, Fifth, Sixth, Seventh, Eighth, Ninth, and Eleventh
Circuits). These courts have relied heavily upon the Advisory Committee Note to the 1979
amendment to Rule 4(a)(5). But the Advisory Committee Note refers to a draft of the 1979
amendment that was ultimately rejected. The rejected draft directed that the good cause standard
apply only to motions filed prior to the expiration of the original deadline. Rule 4(a)(5), as actually
amended, did not. See 16A Charles Alan Wright, et al., Federal Practice and Procedure §3950.3, at
148–49 (2d ed. 1996).
The failure of the courts of appeals to apply Rule 4(a)(5)(A) as written has also created
tension between that rule and Rule 4(b)(4). As amended in 1998, Rule 4(b)(4) permits the district
court to extend the time for filing a notice of appeal in a criminal case for an additional 30 days
upon a finding of excusable neglect or good cause. Both Rule 4(b)(4) and the Advisory Committee
Note to the 1998 amendment make it clear that an extension can be granted for either excusable
neglect or good cause, regardless of whether a motion for an extension is filed before or during the
30 days following the expiration of the original deadline.
Rule 4(a)(5)(A)(ii) has been amended to correct this misunderstanding and to bring the rule
in harmony in this respect with Rule 4(b)(4). A motion for an extension filed prior to the expiration
of the original deadline may be granted if the movant shows either excusable neglect or good
cause. Likewise, a motion for an extension filed during the 30 days following the expiration of the
original deadline may be granted if the movant shows either excusable neglect or good cause.
The good cause and excusable neglect standards have "different domains." Lorenzen v.
Employees Retirement Plan, 896 F.2d 228, 232 (7th Cir. 1990). They are not interchangeable, and
one is not inclusive of the other. The excusable neglect standard applies in situations in which
there is fault; in such situations, the need for an extension is usually occasioned by something
within the control of the movant. The good cause standard applies in situations in which there is no
fault—excusable or otherwise. In such situations, the need for an extension is usually occasioned
by something that is not within the control of the movant.
Thus, the good cause standard can apply to motions brought during the 30 days following
the expiration of the original deadline. If, for example, the Postal Service fails to deliver a notice of
appeal, a movant might have good cause to seek a post-expiration extension. It may be unfair to
make such a movant prove that its "neglect" was excusable, given that the movant may not have
been neglectful at all. Similarly, the excusable neglect standard can apply to motions brought prior
to the expiration of the original deadline. For example, a movant may bring a pre-expiration
motion for an extension of time when an error committed by the movant makes it unlikely that the
movant will be able to meet the original deadline.

Changes Made After Publication and Comments. No changes were made to the text of the
proposed amendment. The stylistic changes to the Committee Note suggested by Judge Newman
were adopted. In addition, two paragraphs were added at the end of the Committee Note to clarify
the difference between the good cause and excusable neglect standards.
Subdivision (a)(7). Several circuit splits have arisen out of uncertainties about how Rule
4(a)(7)'s definition of when a judgment or order is "entered" interacts with the requirement in Fed.
R. Civ. P. 58 that, to be "effective," a judgment must be set forth on a separate document. Rule
4(a)(7) and Fed. R. Civ. P. 58 have been amended to resolve those splits.
1. The first circuit split addressed by the amendments to Rule 4(a)(7) and Fed. R. Civ. P. 58
concerns the extent to which orders that dispose of postjudgment motions must be set forth on
separate documents. Under Rule 4(a)(4)(A), the filing of certain postjudgment motions tolls the
time to appeal the underlying judgment until the "entry" of the order disposing of the last such
remaining motion. Courts have disagreed about whether such an order must be set forth on a
separate document before it is treated as "entered." This disagreement reflects a broader dispute
among courts about whether Rule 4(a)(7) independently imposes a separate document requirement
(a requirement that is distinct from the separate document requirement that is imposed by the
Federal Rules of Civil Procedure ("FRCP")) or whether Rule 4(a)(7) instead incorporates the
separate document requirement as it exists in the FRCP. Further complicating the matter, courts in
the former "camp" disagree among themselves about the scope of the separate document
requirement that they interpret Rule 4(a)(7) as imposing, and courts in the latter "camp" disagree
among themselves about the scope of the separate document requirement imposed by the FRCP.
Rule 4(a)(7) has been amended to make clear that it simply incorporates the separate
document requirement as it exists in Fed. R. Civ. P. 58. If Fed. R. Civ. P. 58 does not require that a
judgment or order be set forth on a separate document, then neither does Rule 4(a)(7); the
judgment or order will be deemed entered for purposes of Rule 4(a) when it is entered in the civil
docket. If Fed. R. Civ. P. 58 requires that a judgment or order be set forth on a separate document,
then so does Rule 4(a)(7); the judgment or order will not be deemed entered for purposes of Rule
4(a) until it is so set forth and entered in the civil docket (with one important exception, described
below).
In conjunction with the amendment to Rule 4(a)(7), Fed. R. Civ. P. 58 has been amended to
provide that orders disposing of the postjudgment motions listed in new Fed. R. Civ. P. 58(a)(1)
(which postjudgment motions include, but are not limited to, the postjudgment motions that can
toll the time to appeal under Rule 4(a)(4)(A)) do not have to be set forth on separate documents.
See Fed. R. Civ. P. 58(a)(1). Thus, such orders are entered for purposes of Rule 4(a) when they are
entered in the civil docket pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 79(a). See Rule 4(a)(7)(A)(1).
2. The second circuit split addressed by the amendments to Rule 4(a)(7) and Fed. R. Civ. P.
58 concerns the following question: When a judgment or order is required to be set forth on a
separate document under Fed. R. Civ. P. 58 but is not, does the time to appeal the judgment or
order—or the time to bring postjudgment motions, such as a motion for a new trial under Fed. R.
Civ. P. 59—ever begin to run? According to every circuit except the First Circuit, the answer is
"no." The First Circuit alone holds that parties will be deemed to have waived their right to have a
judgment or order entered on a separate document three months after the judgment or order is
entered in the civil docket. See Fiore v. Washington County Community Mental Health Ctr., 960
F.2d 229, 236 (1st Cir. 1992) (en banc). Other circuits have rejected this cap as contrary to the
relevant rules. See, e.g., United States v. Haynes, 158 F.3d 1327, 1331 (D.C. Cir. 1998); Hammack
v. Baroid Corp., 142 F.3d 266, 269–70 (5th Cir. 1998); Rubin v. Schottenstein, Zox & Dunn, 110

F.3d 1247, 1253 n.4 (6th Cir. 1997), vacated on other grounds, 143 F.3d 263 (6th Cir. 1998) (en
banc). However, no court has questioned the wisdom of imposing such a cap as a matter of policy.
Both Rule 4(a)(7)(A) and Fed. R. Civ. P. 58 have been amended to impose such a cap.
Under the amendments, a judgment or order is generally treated as entered when it is entered in the
civil docket pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 79(a). There is one exception: When Fed. R. Civ. P.
58(a)(1) requires the judgment or order to be set forth on a separate document, that judgment or
order is not treated as entered until it is set forth on a separate document (in addition to being
entered in the civil docket) or until the expiration of 150 days after its entry in the civil docket,
whichever occurs first. This cap will ensure that parties will not be given forever to appeal (or to
bring a postjudgment motion) when a court fails to set forth a judgment or order on a separate
document in violation of Fed. R. Civ. P. 58(a)(1).
3. The third circuit split—this split addressed only by the amendment to Rule
4(a)(7)—concerns whether the appellant may waive the separate document requirement over the
objection of the appellee. In Bankers Trust Co. v. Mallis, 435 U.S. 381, 387 (1978) (per curiam),
the Supreme Court held that the "parties to an appeal may waive the separate-judgment
requirement of Rule 58." Specifically, the Supreme Court held that when a district court enters an
order and "clearly evidence[s] its intent that the . . . order . . . represent[s] the final decision in the
case," the order is a "final decision" for purposes of 28 U.S.C. §1291, even if the order has not been
set forth on a separate document for purposes of Fed. R. Civ. P. 58. Id. Thus, the parties can choose
to appeal without waiting for the order to be set forth on a separate document.
Courts have disagreed about whether the consent of all parties is necessary to waive the
separate document requirement. Some circuits permit appellees to object to attempted Mallis
waivers and to force appellants to return to the trial court, request that judgment be set forth on a
separate document, and appeal a second time. See, e.g., Selletti v. Carey, 173 F.3d 104, 109–10 (2d
Cir. 1999); Williams v. Borg, 139 F.3d 737, 739–40 (9th Cir. 1998); Silver Star Enters., Inc. v. M/V
Saramacca, 19 F.3d 1008, 1013 (5th Cir. 1994). Other courts disagree and permit Mallis waivers
even if the appellee objects. See, e.g., Haynes, 158 F.3d at 1331; Miller v. Artistic Cleaners, 153
F.3d 781, 783–84 (7th Cir. 1998); Alvord-Polk, Inc. v. F. Schumacher & Co., 37 F.3d 996, 1006
n.8 (3d Cir. 1994).
New Rule 4(a)(7)(B) is intended both to codify the Supreme Court's holding in Mallis and
to make clear that the decision whether to waive the requirement that the judgment or order be set
forth on a separate document is the appellant's alone. It is, after all, the appellant who needs a clear
signal as to when the time to file a notice of appeal has begun to run. If the appellant chooses to
bring an appeal without waiting for the judgment or order to be set forth on a separate document,
then there is no reason why the appellee should be able to object. All that would result from
honoring the appellee's objection would be delay.
4. The final circuit split addressed by the amendment to Rule 4(a)(7) concerns the question
whether an appellant who chooses to waive the separate document requirement must appeal within
30 days (60 days if the government is a party) from the entry in the civil docket of the judgment or
order that should have been set forth on a separate document but was not. In Townsend v. Lucas,
745 F.2d 933 (5th Cir. 1984), the district court dismissed a 28 U.S.C. §2254 action on May 6,
1983, but failed to set forth the judgment on a separate document. The plaintiff appealed on
January 10, 1984. The Fifth Circuit dismissed the appeal, reasoning that, if the plaintiff waived the
separate document requirement, then his appeal would be from the May 6 order, and if his appeal
was from the May 6 order, then it was untimely under Rule 4(a)(1). The Fifth Circuit stressed that
the plaintiff could return to the district court, move that the judgment be set forth on a separate

document, and appeal from that judgment within 30 days. Id. at 934. Several other cases have
embraced the Townsend approach. See, e.g., Armstrong v. Ahitow, 36 F.3d 574, 575 (7th Cir.
1994) (per curiam); Hughes v. Halifax County Sch. Bd., 823 F.2d 832, 835–36 (4th Cir. 1987);
Harris v. McCarthy, 790 F.2d 753, 756 n.1 (9th Cir. 1986).
Those cases are in the distinct minority. There are numerous cases in which courts have
heard appeals that were not filed within 30 days (60 days if the government was a party) from the
judgment or order that should have been set forth on a separate document but was not. See, e.g.,
Haynes, 158 F.3d at 1330–31; Clough v. Rush, 959 F.2d 182, 186 (10th Cir. 1992); McCalden v.
California Library Ass'n, 955 F.2d 1214, 1218–19 (9th Cir. 1990). In the view of these courts, the
remand in Townsend was "precisely the purposeless spinning of wheels abjured by the Court in the
[Mallis] case." 15B Charles Alan Wright et al., Federal Practice and Procedure §3915, at 259 n.8
(3d ed. 1992).
The Committee agrees with the majority of courts that have rejected the Townsend
approach. In drafting new Rule 4(a)(7)(B), the Committee has been careful to avoid phrases such
as "otherwise timely appeal" that might imply an endorsement of Townsend.
Changes Made After Publication and Comments. No changes were made to the text of
proposed Rule 4(a)(7)(B) or to the third or fourth numbered sections of the Committee Note,
except that, in several places, references to a judgment being "entered" on a separate document
were changed to references to a judgment being "set forth" on a separate document. This was to
maintain stylistic consistency. The appellate rules and the civil rules consistently refer to
"entering" judgments on the civil docket and to "setting forth" judgments on separate documents.
Two major changes were made to the text of proposed Rule 4(a)(7)(A)—one substantive
and one stylistic. The substantive change was to increase the "cap" from 60 days to 150 days. The
Appellate Rules Committee and the Civil Rules Committee had to balance two concerns that are
implicated whenever a court fails to enter its final decision on a separate document. On the one
hand, potential appellants need a clear signal that the time to appeal has begun to run, so that they
do not unknowingly forfeit their rights. On the other hand, the time to appeal cannot be allowed to
run forever. A party who receives no notice whatsoever of a judgment has only 180 days to move
to reopen the time to appeal from that judgment. See Rule 4(a)(6)(A). It hardly seems fair to give a
party who does receive notice of a judgment an unlimited amount of time to appeal, merely
because that judgment was not set forth on a separate piece of paper. Potential appellees and the
judicial system need some limit on the time within which appeals can be brought.
The 150-day cap properly balances these two concerns. When an order is not set forth on a
separate document, what signals litigants that the order is final and appealable is a lack of further
activity from the court. A 60-day period of inactivity is not sufficiently rare to signal to litigants
that the court has entered its last order. By contrast, 150 days of inactivity is much less common
and thus more clearly signals to litigants that the court is done with their case.
The major stylistic change to Rule 4(a)(7) requires some explanation. In the published
draft, proposed Rule 4(a)(7)(A) provided that "[a] judgment or order is entered for purposes of this
Rule 4(a) when it is entered for purposes of Rule 58(b) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure." In
other words, Rule 4(a)(7)(A) told readers to look to FRCP 58(b) to ascertain when a judgment is
entered for purposes of starting the running of time to appeal. Sending appellate lawyers to the
civil rules to discover when time began to run for purposes of the appellate rules was itself
somewhat awkward, but it was made more confusing by the fact that, when readers went to
proposed FRCP 58(b), they found this introductory clause: "Judgment is entered for purposes of
Rules 50, 52, 54(d)(2)(B), 59, 60, and 62 when . . ."

This introductory clause was confusing for both appellate lawyers and trial lawyers. It was
confusing for appellate lawyers because Rule 4(a)(7) informed them that FRCP 58(b) would tell
them when the time begins to run for purposes of the appellate rules, but when they got to FRCP
58(b) they found a rule that, by its terms, dictated only when the time begins to run for purposes of
certain civil rules. The introductory clause was confusing for trial lawyers because FRCP 58(b)
described when judgment is entered for some purposes under the civil rules, but then was
completely silent about when judgment is entered for other purposes.
To avoid this confusion, the Civil Rules Committee, on the recommendation of the
Appellate Rules Committee, changed the introductory clause in FRCP 58(b) to read simply:
"Judgment is entered for purposes of these Rules when . . . ." In addition, Rule 4(a)(7)(A) was
redrafted [A redraft of Rule 4(a)(7) was faxed to members of the Appellate Rules Committee two
weeks after our meeting in New Orleans. The Committee consented to the redraft without
objection.] so that the triggering events for the running of the time to appeal (entry in the civil
docket, and being set forth on a separate document or passage of 150 days) were incorporated
directly into Rule 4(a)(7), rather than indirectly through a reference to FRCP 58(b). This
eliminates the need for appellate lawyers to examine Rule 58(b) and any chance that Rule 58(b)'s
introductory clause (even as modified) might confuse them.
We do not believe that republication of Rule 4(a)(7) or FRCP 58 is necessary. In substance,
rewritten Rule 4(a)(7)(A) and FRCP 58(b) operate identically to the published versions, except
that the 60-day cap has been replaced with a 150-day cap—a change that was suggested by some
of the commentators and that makes the cap more forgiving.
Subdivision (b)(5). Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 35(a) permits a district court,
acting within 7 days after the imposition of sentence, to correct an erroneous sentence in a criminal
case. Some courts have held that the filing of a motion for correction of a sentence suspends the
time for filing a notice of appeal from the judgment of conviction. See, e.g., United States v.
Carmouche, 138 F.3d 1014, 1016 (5th Cir. 1998) (per curiam); United States v. Morillo, 8 F.3d
864, 869 (1st Cir. 1993). Those courts establish conflicting timetables for appealing a judgment of
conviction after the filing of a motion to correct a sentence. In the First Circuit, the time to appeal
is suspended only for the period provided by Fed. R. Crim. P. 35(a) for the district court to correct
a sentence; the time to appeal begins to run again once 7 days have passed after sentencing, even if
the motion is still pending. By contrast, in the Fifth Circuit, the time to appeal does not begin to run
again until the district court actually issues an order disposing of the motion.
Rule 4(b)(5) has been amended to eliminate the inconsistency concerning the effect of a
motion to correct a sentence on the time for filing a notice of appeal. The amended rule makes
clear that the time to appeal continues to run, even if a motion to correct a sentence is filed. The
amendment is consistent with Rule 4(b)(3)(A), which lists the motions that toll the time to appeal,
and notably omits any mention of a Fed. R. Crim. P. 35(a) motion. The amendment also should
promote certainty and minimize the likelihood of confusion concerning the time to appeal a
judgment of conviction.
If a district court corrects a sentence pursuant to Fed. R. Crim. P. 35(a), the time for filing a
notice of appeal of the corrected sentence under Rule 4(b)(1) would begin to run when the court
enters a new judgment reflecting the corrected sentence.
Changes Made After Publication and Comments. The reference to Federal Rule of
Criminal Procedure 35(c) was changed to Rule 35(a) to reflect the pending amendment of Rule 35.
The proposed amendment to Criminal Rule 35, if approved, will take effect at the same time that
the proposed amendment to Appellate Rule 4 will take effect, if approved.
Committee Notes on Rules—2005 Amendment

Rule 4(a)(6) has permitted a district court to reopen the time to appeal a judgment or order
upon finding that four conditions were satisfied. First, the district court had to find that the
appellant did not receive notice of the entry of the judgment or order from the district court or any
party within 21 days after the judgment or order was entered. Second, the district court had to find
that the appellant moved to reopen the time to appeal within 7 days after the appellant received
notice of the entry of the judgment or order. Third, the district court had to find that the appellant
moved to reopen the time to appeal within 180 days after the judgment or order was entered.
Finally, the district court had to find that no party would be prejudiced by the reopening of the time
to appeal.
Rule 4(a)(6) has been amended to specify more clearly what type of "notice" of the entry of
a judgment or order precludes a party from later moving to reopen the time to appeal. In addition,
Rule 4(a)(6) has been amended to address confusion about what type of "notice" triggers the 7-day
period to bring a motion to reopen. Finally, Rule 4(a)(6) has been reorganized to set forth more
logically the conditions that must be met before a district court may reopen the time to appeal.
Subdivision (a)(6)(A). Former subdivision (a)(6)(B) has been redesignated as subdivision
(a)(6)(A), and one substantive change has been made. As amended, the subdivision will preclude a
party from moving to reopen the time to appeal a judgment or order only if the party receives
(within 21 days) formal notice of the entry of that judgment or order under Civil Rule 77(d). No
other type of notice will preclude a party.
The reasons for this change take some explanation. Prior to 1998, former subdivision
(a)(6)(B) permitted a district court to reopen the time to appeal if it found "that a party entitled to
notice of the entry of a judgment or order did not receive such notice from the clerk or any party
within 21 days of its entry." The rule was clear that the "notice" to which it referred was the notice
required under Civil Rule 77(d), which must be served by the clerk pursuant to Civil Rule 5(b) and
may also be served by a party pursuant to that same rule. In other words, prior to 1998, former
subdivision (a)(6)(B) was clear that, if a party did not receive formal notice of the entry of a
judgment or order under Civil Rule 77(d), that party could later move to reopen the time to appeal
(assuming that the other requirements of subdivision (a)(6) were met).
In 1998, former subdivision (a)(6)(B) was amended to change the description of the type of
notice that would preclude a party from moving to reopen. As a result of the amendment, former
subdivision (a)(6)(B) no longer referred to the failure of the moving party to receive "such
notice"—that is, the notice required by Civil Rule 77(d)—but instead referred to the failure of the
moving party to receive "the notice." And former subdivision (a)(6)(B) no longer referred to the
failure of the moving party to receive notice from "the clerk or any party," both of whom are
explicitly mentioned in Civil Rule 77(d). Rather, former subdivision (a)(6)(B) referred to the
failure of the moving party to receive notice from "the district court or any party."
The 1998 amendment meant, then, that the type of notice that precluded a party from
moving to reopen the time to appeal was no longer limited to Civil Rule 77(d) notice. Under the
1998 amendment, some type of notice, in addition to Civil Rule 77(d) notice, precluded a party.
But the text of the amended rule did not make clear what type of notice qualified. This was an
invitation for litigation, confusion, and possible circuit splits.
To avoid such problems, former subdivision (a)(6)(B)—new subdivision (a)(6)(A)—has
been amended to restore its pre-1998 simplicity. Under new subdivision (a)(6)(A), if the court
finds that the moving party was not notified under Civil Rule 77(d) of the entry of the judgment or
order that the party seeks to appeal within 21 days after that judgment or order was entered, then

the court is authorized to reopen the time to appeal (if all of the other requirements of subdivision
(a)(6) are met). Because Civil Rule 77(d) requires that notice of the entry of a Judgment or order be
formally served under Civil Rule 5(b), any notice that is not so served will not operate to preclude
the reopening of the time to appeal under new subdivision (a)(6)(A).
Subdivision (a)(6)(B). Former subdivision (a)(6)(A) required a party to move to reopen the
time to appeal "within 7 days after the moving party receives notice of the entry [of the judgment
or order sought to be appealed]." Former subdivision (a)(6)(A) has been redesignated as
subdivision (a)(6)(B), and one important substantive change has been made: The subdivision now
makes clear that only formal notice of the entry of a judgment or order under Civil Rule 77(d) will
trigger the 7-day period to move to reopen the time to appeal.
The circuits have been split over what type of "notice" is sufficient to trigger the 7-day
period. The majority of circuits that addressed the question held that only written notice was
sufficient, although nothing in the text of the rule suggested such a limitation. See, e.g., Bass v.
United States Dep't of Agric., 211 F.3d 959, 963 (5th Cir. 2000). By contrast, the Ninth Circuit
held that while former subdivision (a)(6)(A) did not require written notice, "the quality of the
communication [had to] rise to the functional equivalent of written notice." Nguyen v. Southwest
Leasing & Rental, Inc., 282 F.3d 1061, 1066 (9th Cir. 2002). Other circuits suggested in dicta that
former subdivision (a)(6)(A) required only "actual notice," which, presumably, could have
included oral notice that was not "the functional equivalent of written notice." See, e.g., Lowry v.
McDonnell Douglas Corp., 211 F.3d 457, 464 (8th Cir. 2000). And still other circuits read into
former subdivision (a)(6)(A) restrictions that appeared only in former subdivision (a)(6)(B) (such
as the requirement that notice be received "from the district court or any party," see Benavides v.
Bureau of Prisons, 79 F.3d 1211, 1214 (D.C. Cir. 1996)) or that appeared in neither former
subdivision (a)(6)(A) nor former subdivision (a)(6)(B) (such as the requirement that notice be
served in the manner prescribed by Civil Rule 5, see Ryan v. First Unum Life Ins. Co., 174 F.3d
302, 304–05 (2d Cir. 1999)).
Former subdivision (a)(6)(A)—new subdivision (a)(6)(B)—has been amended to resolve
this circuit split by providing that only formal notice of the entry of a judgment or order under Civil
Rule 77(d) will trigger the 7-day period. Using Civil Rule 77(d) notice as the trigger has two
advantages: First, because Civil Rule 77(d) is clear and familiar, circuit splits are unlikely to
develop over its meaning. Second, because Civil Rule 77(d) notice must be served under Civil
Rule 5(b), establishing whether and when such notice was provided should generally not be
difficult.
Using Civil Rule 77(d) notice to trigger the 7-day period will not unduly delay appellate
proceedings. Rule 4(a)(6) applies to only a small number of cases—cases in which a party was not
notified of a judgment or order by either the clerk or another party within 21 days after entry. Even
with respect to those cases, an appeal cannot be brought more than 180 days after entry, no matter
what the circumstances. In addition, Civil Rule 77(d) permits parties to serve notice of the entry of
a judgment or order. The winning party can prevent Rule 4(a)(6) from even coming into play
simply by serving notice of entry within 21 days. Failing that, the winning party can always trigger
the 7-day deadline to move to reopen by serving belated notice.
Changes Made After Publication and Comments. No change was made to the text of
subdivision (A)—regarding the type of notice that precludes a party from later moving to reopen
the time to appeal—and only minor stylistic changes were made to the Committee Note to
subdivision (A).
A substantial change was made to subdivision (B)—regarding the type of notice that

triggers the 7-day deadline for moving to reopen the time to appeal. Under the published version of
subdivision (B), the 7-day deadline would have been triggered when "the moving party receives or
observes written notice of the entry from any source." The Committee was attempting to
implement an "eyes/ears" distinction: The 7-day period was triggered when a party learned of the
entry of a judgment or order by reading about it (whether on a piece of paper or a computer screen),
but was not triggered when a party merely heard about it.
Above all else, subdivision (B) should be clear and easy to apply; it should neither risk
opening another circuit split over its meaning nor create the need for a lot of factfinding by district
courts. After considering the public comments—and, in particular, the comments of two
committees of the California bar—the Committee decided that subdivision (B) could do better on
both counts. The published standard—"receives or observes written notice of the entry from any
source"—was awkward and, despite the guidance of the Committee Note, was likely to give courts
problems. Even if the standard had proved to be sufficiently clear, district courts would still have
been left to make factual findings about whether a particular attorney or party "received" or
"observed" notice that was written or electronic.
The Committee concluded that the solution suggested by the California bar—using Civil
Rule 77(d) notice to trigger the 7-day period—made a lot of sense. The standard is clear; no one
doubts what it means to be served with notice of the entry of judgment under Civil Rule 77(d). The
standard is also unlikely to give rise to many factual disputes. Civil Rule 77(d) notice must be
formally served under Civil Rule 5(b), so establishing the presence or absence of such notice
should be relatively easy. And, for the reasons described in the Committee Note, using Civil Rule
77(d) as the trigger will not unduly delay appellate proceedings.
For these reasons, the Committee amended subdivision (B) so that the 7-day deadline will
be triggered only by notice of the entry of a judgment or order that is served under Civil Rule
77(d). (Corresponding changes were made to the Committee Note.) The Committee does not
believe that the amendment needs to be published again for comment, as the issue of what type of
notice should trigger the 7-day deadline has already been addressed by commentators, the revised
version of subdivision (B) is far more forgiving than the published version, and it is highly
unlikely that the revised version will be found ambiguous in any respect.
Committee Notes on Rules—2009 Amendment
Subdivision (a)(4)(B)(ii). Subdivision (a)(4)(B)(ii) is amended to address problems that
stemmed from the adoption—during the 1998 restyling project—of language referring to "a
judgment altered or amended upon" a posttrial motion.
Prior to the restyling, subdivision (a)(4) instructed that "[a]ppellate review of an order
disposing of any of [the posttrial motions listed in subdivision (a)(4)] requires the party, in
compliance with Appellate Rule 3(c), to amend a previously filed notice of appeal. A party
intending to challenge an alteration or amendment of the judgment shall file a notice, or amended
notice, of appeal within the time prescribed by this Rule 4 measured from the entry of the order
disposing of the last such motion outstanding." After the restyling, subdivision (a)(4)(B)(ii)
provided: "A party intending to challenge an order disposing of any motion listed in Rule
4(a)(4)(A), or a judgment altered or amended upon such a motion, must file a notice of appeal, or
an amended notice of appeal—in compliance with Rule 3(c)—within the time prescribed by this
Rule measured from the entry of the order disposing of the last such remaining motion."
One court has explained that the 1998 amendment introduced ambiguity into the Rule:
"The new formulation could be read to expand the obligation to file an amended notice to

circumstances where the ruling on the posttrial motion alters the prior judgment in an insignificant
manner or in a manner favorable to the appellant, even though the appeal is not directed against the
alteration of the judgment." Sorensen v. City of New York, 413 F.3d 292, 296 n.2 (2d Cir. 2005).
The current amendment removes that ambiguous reference to "a judgment altered or amended
upon" a posttrial motion, and refers instead to "a judgment's alteration or amendment" upon such a
motion. Thus, subdivision (a)(4)(B)(ii) requires a new or amended notice of appeal when an
appellant wishes to challenge an order disposing of a motion listed in Rule 4(a)(4)(A) or a
judgment's alteration or amendment upon such a motion.
Changes Made After Publication and Comment. No changes were made to the proposal as
published. Instead, the Committee has added the commentators' suggestions to its study agenda.
Subdivision (a)(4)(A)(vi). Subdivision (a)(4) provides that certain timely posttrial motions
extend the time for filing an appeal. Lawyers sometimes move under Civil Rule 60 for relief that is
still available under another rule such as Civil Rule 59. Subdivision (a)(4)(A)(vi) provides for such
eventualities by extending the time for filing an appeal so long as the Rule 60 motion is filed within
a limited time. Formerly, the time limit under subdivision (a)(4)(A)(vi) was 10 days, reflecting the
10-day limits for making motions under Civil Rules 50(b), 52(b), and 59. Subdivision
(a)(4)(A)(vi) now contains a 28-day limit to match the revisions to the time limits in the Civil
Rules.
Subdivision (a)(5)(C). The time set in the former rule at 10 days has been revised to 14
days. See the Note to Rule 26.
Subdivision (a)(6)(B). The time set in the former rule at 7 days has been revised to 14 days.
Under the time-computation approach set by former Rule 26(a), "7 days" always meant at least 9
days and could mean as many as 11 or even 13 days. Under current Rule 26(a), intermediate
weekends and holidays are counted. Changing the period from 7 to 14 days offsets the change in
computation approach. See the Note to Rule 26.
Subdivisions (b)(1)(A) and (b)(3)(A). The times set in the former rule at 10 days have been
revised to 14 days. See the Note to Rule 26.
Committee Notes on Rules—2010 Amendment
Subdivision (a)(7). Subdivision (a)(7) is amended to reflect the renumbering of Civil Rule
58 as part of the 2007 restyling of the Civil Rules. References to Civil Rule "58(a)(1)" are revised
to refer to Civil Rule "58(a)." No substantive change is intended.
The amendments are technical and conforming. In accordance with established Judicial
Conference procedures they were not published for public comment.
Committee Notes on Rules—2011 Amendment
Subdivision (a)(1)(B). Rule 4(a)(1)(B) has been amended to make clear that the 60-day
appeal period applies in cases in which an officer or employee of the United States is sued in an
individual capacity for acts or omissions occurring in connection with duties performed on behalf
of the United States. (A concurrent amendment to Rule 40(a)(1) makes clear that the 45-day period
to file a petition for panel rehearing also applies in such cases.)
The amendment to Rule 4(a)(1)(B) is consistent with a 2000 amendment to Civil Rule
12(a)(3), which specified an extended 60-day period to respond to complaints when "[a] United
States officer or employee [is] sued in an individual capacity for an act or omission occurring in
connection with duties performed on the United States' behalf." The Committee Note to the 2000

amendment explained: "Time is needed for the United States to determine whether to provide
representation to the defendant officer or employee. If the United States provides representation,
the need for an extended answer period is the same as in actions against the United States, a United
States agency, or a United States officer sued in an official capacity." The same reasons justify
providing additional time to the Solicitor General to decide whether to file an appeal.
However, because of the greater need for clarity of application when appeal rights are at
stake, the amendment to Rule 4(a)(1)(B), and the corresponding legislative amendment to 28
U.S.C. §2107 that is simultaneously proposed, include safe harbor provisions that parties can
readily apply and rely upon. Under new subdivision 4(a)(1)(B)(iv), a case automatically qualifies
for the 60-day appeal period if (1) a legal officer of the United States has appeared in the case, in an
official capacity, as counsel for the current or former officer or employee and has not withdrawn
the appearance at the time of the entry of the judgment or order appealed from or (2) a legal officer
of the United States appears on the notice of appeal as counsel, in an official capacity, for the
current or former officer or employee. There will be cases that do not fall within either safe harbor
but that qualify for the longer appeal period. An example would be a case in which a federal
employee is sued in an individual capacity for an act occurring in connection with federal duties
and the United States does not represent the employee either when the judgment is entered or when
the appeal is filed but the United States pays for private counsel for the employee.
Changes Made After Publication and Comment. The Committee made two changes to the
proposal after publication and comment.
First, the Committee inserted the words "current or former" before "United States officer or
employee." This insertion causes the text of the proposed Rule to diverge slightly from that of
Civil Rules 4(i)(3) and 12(a)(3), which refer simply to "a United States officer or employee [etc.]."
This divergence, though, is only stylistic. The 2000 Committee Notes to Civil Rules 4(i)(3) and
12(a)(3) make clear that those rules are intended to encompass former as well as current officers or
employees. It is desirable to make this clarification in the text of Rule 4(a)(1) because that Rule's
appeal time periods are jurisdictional.
Second, the Committee added, at the end of Rule 4(a)(1)(B)(iv), the following new
language: "—including all instances in which the United States represents that person when the
judgment or order is entered or files the appeal for that person." During the public comment period,
concerns were raised that a party might rely on the longer appeal period, only to risk the appeal
being held untimely by a court that later concluded that the relevant act or omission had not
actually occurred in connection with federal duties. The Committee decided to respond to this
concern by adding two safe harbor provisions. These provisions make clear that the longer appeal
periods apply in any case where the United States either represents the officer or employee at the
time of entry of the relevant judgment or files the notice of appeal on the officer or employee's
behalf.

Government" in first sentence, and "(i)" and "or (ii) a notice of appeal by any defendant" in fifth
sentence.

Rule 5. Appeal by Permission
(a) Petition for Permission to Appeal.
(1) To request permission to appeal when an appeal is within the court of appeals'
discretion, a party must file a petition for permission to appeal. The petition must be filed with the
circuit clerk with proof of service on all other parties to the district-court action.
(2) The petition must be filed within the time specified by the statute or rule authorizing the
appeal or, if no such time is specified, within the time provided by Rule 4(a) for filing a notice of
appeal.
(3) If a party cannot petition for appeal unless the district court first enters an order granting
permission to do so or stating that the necessary conditions are met, the district court may amend
its order, either on its own or in response to a party's motion, to include the required permission or
statement. In that event, the time to petition runs from entry of the amended order.
(b) Contents of the Petition; Answer or Cross-Petition; Oral Argument.
(1) The petition must include the following:
(A) the facts necessary to understand the question presented;
(B) the question itself;
(C) the relief sought;
(D) the reasons why the appeal should be allowed and is authorized by a statute or rule; and
(E) an attached copy of:
(i) the order, decree, or judgment complained of and any related opinion or memorandum,
and
(ii) any order stating the district court's permission to appeal or finding that the necessary
conditions are met.
(2) A party may file an answer in opposition or a cross-petition within 10 days after the
petition is served.
(3) The petition and answer will be submitted without oral argument unless the court of
appeals orders otherwise.
(c) Form of Papers; Number of Copies. All papers must conform to Rule 32(c)(2). Except
by the court's permission, a paper must not exceed 20 pages, exclusive of the disclosure statement,
the proof of service, and the accompanying documents required by Rule 5(b)(1)(E). An original
and 3 copies must be filed unless the court requires a different number by local rule or by order in
a particular case.
(d) Grant of Permission; Fees; Cost Bond; Filing the Record.
(1) Within 14 days after the entry of the order granting permission to appeal, the appellant
must:
(A) pay the district clerk all required fees; and
(B) file a cost bond if required under Rule 7.

(2) A notice of appeal need not be filed. The date when the order granting permission to
appeal is entered serves as the date of the notice of appeal for calculating time under these rules.
(3) The district clerk must notify the circuit clerk once the petitioner has paid the fees.
Upon receiving this notice, the circuit clerk must enter the appeal on the docket. The record must
be forwarded and filed in accordance with Rules 11 and 12(c).

Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules—1967
This rule is derived in the main from Third Circuit Rule 11(2), which is similar to the rule
governing appeals under 28 U.S.C. §1292(b) in a majority of the circuits. The second sentence of
subdivision (a) resolves a conflict over the question of whether the district court can amend an
order by supplying the statement required by §1292(b) at any time after entry of the order, with the
result that the time fixed by the statute commences to run on the date of entry of the order as
amended. Compare Milbert v. Bison Laboratories, 260 F.2d 431 (3d Cir., 1958) with Sperry Rand
Corporation v. Bell Telephone Laboratories, 272 F.2d (2d Cir., 1959), Hadjipateras v. Pacifica,
S.A., 290 F.2d 697 (5th Cir., 1961), and Houston Fearless Corporation v. Teter, 313 F.2d 91 (10th
Cir., 1962). The view taken by the Second, Fifth and Tenth Circuits seems theoretically and
practically sound, and the rule adopts it. Although a majority of the circuits now require the filing
of a notice of appeal following the grant of permission to appeal, filing of the notice serves no
function other than to provide a time from which the time for transmitting the record and docketing
the appeal begins to run.
Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules—1979 Amendment
The proposed amendment adapts to the practice in appeals from interlocutory orders under
28 U.S.C. §1292(b) the provisions of proposed Rule 3(e) above, requiring payment of all fees in
the district court upon the filing of the notice of appeal. See Note to proposed amended Rule 3(e),
supra.
Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules—1994 Amendment
Subdivision (c). The amendment makes it clear that a court may require a different number
of copies either by rule or by order in an individual case. The number of copies of any document
that a court of appeals needs varies depending upon the way in which the court conducts business.
The internal operation of the courts of appeals necessarily varies from circuit to circuit because of
differences in the number of judges, the geographic area included within the circuit, and other such
factors. Uniformity could be achieved only by setting the number of copies artificially high so that
parties in all circuits file enough copies to satisfy the needs of the court requiring the greatest
number. Rather than do that, the Committee decided to make it clear that local rules may require a
greater or lesser number of copies and that, if the circumstances of a particular case indicate the
need for a different number of copies in that case, the court may so order.
Committee Notes on Rules—1998 Amendment
In 1992 Congress added subsection (e) to 28 U.S.C. §1292. Subsection (e) says that the

Supreme Court has power to prescribe rules that "provide for an appeal of an interlocutory
decision to the courts of appeals that is not otherwise provided for" in section 1292. The
amendment of Rule 5 was prompted by the possibility of new rules authorizing additional
interlocutory appeals. Rather than add a separate rule governing each such appeal, the Committee
believes it is preferable to amend Rule 5 so that is will govern all such appeals.
In addition the Federal Courts Improvement Act of 1996, Pub. L. 104–317, abolished
appeals by permission under 28 U.S.C. §636(c)(5), making Rule 5.1 obsolete.
This new Rule 5 is intended to govern all discretionary appeals from district-court orders,
judgments, or decrees. At this time that includes interlocutory appeals under 28 U.S.C. §1292(b),
(c)(1), and (d)(1) & (2). If additional interlocutory appeals are authorized under §1292(e), the new
Rule is intended to govern them if the appeals are discretionary.
Subdivision (a). Paragraph (a)(1) says that when granting an appeal is within a court of
appeals' discretion, a party may file a petition for permission to appeal. The time for filing
provision states only that the petition must be filed within the time provided in the statute or rule
authorizing the appeal or, if no such time is specified, within the time provided by Rule 4(a) for
filing a notice of appeal.
Section 1292(b), (c), and (d) provide that the petition must be filed within 10 days after
entry of the order containing the statement prescribed in the statute. Existing Rule 5(a) provides
that if a district court amends an order to contain the prescribed statement, the petition must be
filed within 10 days after entry of the amended order. The new rule similarly says that if a party
cannot petition without the district court's permission or statement that necessary circumstances
are present, the district court may amend its order to include such a statement and the time to
petition runs from the entry of the amended order.
The provision that the Rule 4(a) time for filing a notice of appeal should apply if the statute
or rule is silent about the filing time was drawn from existing Rule 5.1.
Subdivision (b). The changes made in the provisions in paragraph (b)(1) are intended only
to broaden them sufficiently to make them appropriate for all discretionary appeals.
In paragraph (b)(2) a uniform time—7 days—is established for filing an answer in
opposition or cross-petition. Seven days is the time for responding under existing Rule 5 and is an
appropriate length of time when dealing with an interlocutory appeal. Although existing Rule 5.1
provides 14 days for responding, the Committee does not believe that the longer response time is
necessary.
Subdivision (c). Subdivision (c) is substantively unchanged.
Subdivision (d). Paragraph (d)(2) is amended to state that "the date when the order granting
permission to appeal is entered serves as the date of the notice of appeal" for purposes of
calculating time under the rules. That language simply clarifies existing practice.
Committee Notes on Rules—2002 Amendment
Subdivision (c). A petition for permission to appeal, a cross-petition for permission to
appeal, and an answer to a petition or cross-petition for permission to appeal are all "other papers"
for purposes of Rule 32(c)(2), and all of the requirements of Rule 32(a) apply to those papers,
except as provided in Rule 32(c)(2). During the 1998 restyling of the Federal Rules of Appellate
Procedure, Rule 5(c) was inadvertently changed to suggest that only the requirements of Rule
32(a)(1) apply to such papers. Rule 5(c) has been amended to correct that error.
Rule 5(c) has been further amended to limit the length of papers filed under Rule 5.
Changes Made After Publication and Comments. No changes were made to the text of the

proposed amendment or to the Committee Note.
Committee Notes on Rules—2009 Amendment
Subdivision (b)(2). Subdivision (b)(2) is amended in the light of the change in Rule 26(a)'s
time computation rules. Subdivision (b)(2) formerly required that an answer in opposition to a
petition for permission to appeal, or a cross-petition for permission to appeal, be filed "within 7
days after the petition is served." Under former Rule 26(a), "7 days" always meant at least 9 days
and could mean as many as 11 or even 13 days. Under current Rule 26(a), intermediate weekends
and holidays are counted. Changing the period from 7 to 10 days offsets the change in computation
approach. See the Note to Rule 26.
Subdivision (d)(1). The time set in the former rule at 10 days has been revised to 14 days.
See the Note to Rule 26.

[Rule 5.1. Appeal by Leave under 28 U.S.C. §636(c)(5)] (Abrogated Apr. 24,
1998, eff. Dec. 1, 1998)
Committee Notes on Rules—1998 Amendment

The Federal Courts Improvement Act of 1996, Pub. L. No. 104–317, abolished appeals by
permission under 28 U.S.C. §636(c)(5), making Rule 5.1 obsolete. Rule 5.1 is, therefore,
abrogated.

Rule 6. Appeal in a Bankruptcy Case from a Final Judgment, Order, or
Decree of a District Court or Bankruptcy Appellate Panel
(a) Appeal From a Judgment, Order, or Decree of a District Court Exercising Original
Jurisdiction in a Bankruptcy Case. An appeal to a court of appeals from a final judgment, order, or
decree of a district court exercising jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. §1334 is taken as any other civil
appeal under these rules.
(b) Appeal From a Judgment, Order, or Decree of a District Court or Bankruptcy Appellate
Panel Exercising Appellate Jurisdiction in a Bankruptcy Case.
(1) Applicability of Other Rules. These rules apply to an appeal to a court of appeals under
28 U.S.C. §158(d) from a final judgment, order, or decree of a district court or bankruptcy
appellate panel exercising appellate jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. §158(a) or (b). But there are 3
exceptions:
(A) Rules 4(a)(4), 4(b), 9, 10, 11, 12(b), 13–20, 22–23, and 24(b) do not apply;
(B) the reference in Rule 3(c) to "Form 1 in the Appendix of Forms" must be read as a
reference to Form 5; and
(C) when the appeal is from a bankruptcy appellate panel, the term "district court," as used
in any applicable rule, means "appellate panel."
(2) Additional Rules. In addition to the rules made applicable by Rule 6(b)(1), the
following rules apply:

(A) Motion for Rehearing.
(i) If a timely motion for rehearing under Bankruptcy Rule 8015 is filed, the time to appeal
for all parties runs from the entry of the order disposing of the motion. A notice of appeal filed after
the district court or bankruptcy appellate panel announces or enters a judgment, order, or
decree—but before disposition of the motion for rehearing—becomes effective when the order
disposing of the motion for rehearing is entered.
(ii) Appellate review of the order disposing of the motion requires the party, in compliance
with Rules 3(c) and 6(b)(1)(B), to amend a previously filed notice of appeal. A party intending to
challenge an altered or amended judgment, order, or decree must file a notice of appeal or
amended notice of appeal within the time prescribed by Rule 4—excluding Rules 4(a)(4) and
4(b)—measured from the entry of the order disposing of the motion.
(iii) No additional fee is required to file an amended notice.
(B) The record on appeal.
(i) Within 14 days after filing the notice of appeal, the appellant must file with the clerk
possessing the record assembled in accordance with Bankruptcy Rule 8006—and serve on the
appellee—a statement of the issues to be presented on appeal and a designation of the record to be
certified and sent to the circuit clerk.
(ii) An appellee who believes that other parts of the record are necessary must, within 14
days after being served with the appellant's designation, file with the clerk and serve on the
appellant a designation of additional parts to be included.
(iii) The record on appeal consists of:
• the redesignated record as provided above;
• the proceedings in the district court or bankruptcy appellate panel; and
• a certified copy of the docket entries prepared by the clerk under Rule 3(d).
(C) Forwarding the Record.
(i) When the record is complete, the district clerk or bankruptcy appellate panel clerk must
number the documents constituting the record and send them promptly to the circuit clerk together
with a list of the documents correspondingly numbered and reasonably identified. Unless directed
to do so by a party or the circuit clerk, the clerk will not send to the court of appeals documents of
unusual bulk or weight, physical exhibits other than documents, or other parts of the record
designated for omission by local rule of the court of appeals. If the exhibits are unusually bulky or
heavy, a party must arrange with the clerks in advance for their transportation and receipt.
(ii) All parties must do whatever else is necessary to enable the clerk to assemble and
forward the record. The court of appeals may provide by rule or order that a certified copy of the
docket entries be sent in place of the redesignated record, but any party may request at any time
during the pendency of the appeal that the redesignated record be sent.
(D) Filing the Record. Upon receiving the record—or a certified copy of the docket entries
sent in place of the redesignated record—the circuit clerk must file it and immediately notify all
parties of the filing date.

Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules—1967

This rule is substantially a restatement of present procedure. See D.C. Cir. Rule 34; 6th Cir.
Rule 11; 7th Cir. Rule 10(d); 10th Cir. Rule 13.
Present circuit rules commonly provide that the petition for allowance of an appeal shall be
filed within the time allowed by Section 25 of the Bankruptcy Act for taking appeals of right. For
the reasons explained in the Note accompanying Rule 4, that rule makes the time for appeal in
bankruptcy cases the same as that which obtains in other civil cases and thus supersedes Section
25. Thus the present rule simply continues the former practice of making the time for filing the
petition in appeals by allowance the same as that provided for filing the notice of appeal in appeals
of right.
Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules—1979 Amendment
The proposed amendment adapts to the practice in appeals by allowance in bankruptcy
proceedings the provisions of proposed Rule 3(e) above, requiring payment of all fees in the
district court at the time of the filing of the notice of appeal. See Note to Rule 3(e), supra.
Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules—1989 Amendment
A new Rule 6 is proposed. The Bankruptcy Reform Act of 1978, Pub. L. No. 95–598, 92
Stat. 2549, the Supreme Court decision in Northern Pipeline Construction Co. v. Marathon Pipe
Line Co., 458 U.S. 50 (1982), and the Bankruptcy Amendments and Federal Judgeship Act of
1984, Pub. L. No. 98–353, 98 Stat. 333, have made the existing Rule 6 obsolete.
Subdivision (a). Subdivision (a) provides that when a district court exercises original
jurisdiction in a bankruptcy matter, rather than referring it to a bankruptcy judge for a final
determination, the appeal should be taken in identical fashion as appeals from district court
decisions in other civil actions. A district court exercises original jurisdiction and this subdivision
applies when the district court enters a final order or judgment upon consideration of a bankruptcy
judge's proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law in a non-core proceeding pursuant to 28
U.S.C. §157(c)(1) or when a district court withdraws a proceeding pursuant to 28 U.S.C. §157(d).
This subdivision is included to avoid uncertainty arising from the question of whether a
bankruptcy case is a civil case. The rules refer at various points to the procedure "in a civil case",
see, e.g. Rule 4(a)(1). Subdivision (a) makes it clear that such rules apply to an appeal from a
district court bankruptcy decision.
Subdivision (b). Subdivision (b) governs appeals that follow intermediate review of a
bankruptcy judge's decision by a district court or a bankruptcy appellate panel.
Subdivision (b)(1). Subdivision (b)(1) provides for the general applicability of the Federal
Rules of Appellate Procedure, with specified exceptions, to appeals covered by subdivision (b) and
makes necessary word adjustments.
Subdivision (b)(2). Paragraph (i) provides that the time for filing a notice of appeal shall
begin to run anew from the entry of an order denying a rehearing or from the entry of a subsequent
judgment. The Committee deliberately omitted from the rule any provision governing the validity
of a notice of appeal filed prior to the entry of an order denying a rehearing; the Committee
intended to leave undisturbed the current state of the law on that issue. Paragraph (ii) calls for a
redesignation of the appellate record assembled in the bankruptcy court pursuant to Rule 8006 of
the Rules of Bankruptcy Procedure. After an intermediate appeal, a party may well narrow the
focus of its efforts on the second appeal and a redesignation of the record may eliminate

unnecessary material. The proceedings during the first appeal are included to cover the possibility
that independent error in the intermediate appeal, for example failure to follow appropriate
procedures, may be assigned in the court of appeals. Paragraph (iii) provides for the transmission
of the record and tracks the appropriate subsections of Rule 11. Paragraph (iv) provides for the
filing of the record and notices to the parties. Paragraph (ii) and Paragraph (iv) both refer to "a
certified copy of the docket entries". The "docket entries" referred to are the docket entries in the
district court or the bankruptcy appellate panel, not the entire docket in the bankruptcy court.
Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules—1993 Amendment
Note to Subparagraph (b)(2)(i). The amendment accompanies concurrent changes to Rule
4(a)(4). Although Rule 6 never included language such as that being changed in Rule 4(a)(4),
language that made a notice of appeal void if it was filed before, or during the pendency of, certain
posttrial motions, courts have found that a notice of appeal is premature if it is filed before the
court disposes of a motion for rehearing. See, e.g., In re X-Cel, Inc., 823 F.2d 192 (7th Cir. 1987);
In re Shah, 859 F.2d 1463 (10th Cir. 1988). The Committee wants to achieve the same result here
as in Rule 4, the elimination of a procedural trap.
Committee Notes on Rules—1998 Amendment
The language and organization of the rule are amended to make the rule more easily
understood. In addition to changes made to improve the understanding, the Advisory Committee
has changed language to make style and terminology consistent throughout the appellate rules.
These changes are intended to be stylistic only.
Subdivision (b). Language is added to Rule 6(b)(2)(A)(ii) to conform with the
corresponding provision in Rule 4(a)(4). The new language is clarifying rather than substantive.
The existing rule states that a party intending to challenge an alteration or amendment of a
judgment must file an amended notice of appeal. Of course if a party has not previously filed a
notice of appeal, the party would simply file a notice of appeal not an amended one. The new
language states that the party must file "a notice of appeal or amended notice of appeal."
Committee Notes on Rules—2009 Amendment
Subdivision (b)(2)(B). The times set in the former rule at 10 days have been revised to 14
days. See the Note to Rule 26.

Rule 7. Bond for Costs on Appeal in a Civil Case
In a civil case, the district court may require an appellant to file a bond or provide other
security in any form and amount necessary to ensure payment of costs on appeal. Rule 8(b) applies
to a surety on a bond given under this rule.

This rule is derived from FRCP 73(c) without change in substance.
Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules—1979 Amendment
The amendment would eliminate the provision of the present rule that requires the
appellant to file a $250 bond for costs on appeal at the time of filing his notice of appeal. The $250
provision was carried forward in the F.R.App.P. from former Rule 73(c) of the F.R.Civ.P., and the
$250 figure has remained unchanged since the adoption of that rule in 1937. Today it bears no
relationship to actual costs. The amended rule would leave the question of the need for a bond for
costs and its amount in the discretion of the court.
Committee Notes on Rules—1998 Amendment
The language of the rule is amended to make the rule more easily understood. In addition to
changes made to improve the understanding, the Advisory Committee has changed language to
make style and terminology consistent throughout the appellate rules. These changes are intended
to be stylistic only.

Rule 8. Stay or Injunction Pending Appeal
(a) Motion for Stay.
(1) Initial Motion in the District Court. A party must ordinarily move first in the district
court for the following relief:
(A) a stay of the judgment or order of a district court pending appeal;
(B) approval of a supersedeas bond; or
(C) an order suspending, modifying, restoring, or granting an injunction while an appeal is
pending.
(2) Motion in the Court of Appeals; Conditions on Relief. A motion for the relief mentioned
in Rule 8(a)(1) may be made to the court of appeals or to one of its judges.
(A) The motion must:
(i) show that moving first in the district court would be impracticable; or
(ii) state that, a motion having been made, the district court denied the motion or failed to
afford the relief requested and state any reasons given by the district court for its action.
(B) The motion must also include:
(i) the reasons for granting the relief requested and the facts relied on;
(ii) originals or copies of affidavits or other sworn statements supporting facts subject to
dispute; and
(iii) relevant parts of the record.
(C) The moving party must give reasonable notice of the motion to all parties.

(D) A motion under this Rule 8(a)(2) must be filed with the circuit clerk and normally will
be considered by a panel of the court. But in an exceptional case in which time requirements make
that procedure impracticable, the motion may be made to and considered by a single judge.
(E) The court may condition relief on a party's filing a bond or other appropriate security in
the district court.
(b) Proceeding Against a Surety. If a party gives security in the form of a bond or
stipulation or other undertaking with one or more sureties, each surety submits to the jurisdiction
of the district court and irrevocably appoints the district clerk as the surety's agent on whom any
papers affecting the surety's liability on the bond or undertaking may be served. On motion, a
surety's liability may be enforced in the district court without the necessity of an independent
action. The motion and any notice that the district court prescribes may be served on the district
clerk, who must promptly mail a copy to each surety whose address is known.
(c) Stay in a Criminal Case. Rule 38 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure governs a
stay in a criminal case.
(As amended Mar. 10, 1986, eff. July 1, 1986; Apr. 27, 1995, eff. Dec. 1, 1995; Apr. 24,

Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules—1967
Subdivision (a). While the power of a court of appeals to stay proceedings in the district
court during the pendency of an appeal is not explicitly conferred by statute, it exists by virtue of
the all writs statute, 28 U.S.C. §1651. Eastern Greyhound Lines v. Fusco, 310 F.2d 632 (6th Cir.,
1962); United States v. Lynd, 301 F.2d 818 (5th Cir., 1962); Public Utilities Commission of Dist. of
Col. v. Capital Transit Co., 94 U.S.App.D.C. 140, 214 F.2d 242 (1954). And the Supreme Court
has termed the power "inherent" (In re McKenzie, 180 U.S. 536, 551, 21 S.Ct. 468, 45 L.Ed. 657
(1901)) and "part of its (the court of appeals) traditional equipment for the administration of
justice." (Scripps-Howard Radio v. F.C.C., 316 U.S. 4, 9–10, 62 S.Ct. 875, 86 L.Ed. 1229 (1942)).
The power of a single judge of the court of appeals to grant a stay pending appeal was recognized
in In re McKenzie, supra. Alexander v. United States, 173 F.2d 865 (9th Cir., 1949) held that a
single judge could not stay the judgment of a district court, but it noted the absence of a rule of
court authorizing the practice. FRCP 62(g) adverts to the grant of a stay by a single judge of the
appellate court. The requirement that application be first made to the district court is the case law
rule. Cumberland Tel. & Tel. Co. v. Louisiana Public Service Commission, 260 U.S. 212, 219, 43
S.Ct. 75, 67 L.Ed. 217 (1922); United States v. El-O-Pathic Pharmacy, 192 F.2d 62 (9th Cir.,
1951); United States v. Hansell, 109 F.2d 613 (2d Cir., 1940). The requirement is explicitly stated
in FRCrP 38(c) and in the rules of the First, Third, Fourth and Tenth Circuits. See also Supreme
Court Rules 18 and 27.
The statement of the requirement in the proposed rule would work a minor change in
present practice. FRCP 73(e) requires that if a bond for costs on appeal or a supersedeas bond is
offered after the appeal is docketed, leave to file the bond must be obtained from the court of
appeals. There appears to be no reason why matters relating to supersedeas and cost bonds should
not be initially presented to the district court whenever they arise prior to the disposition of the
appeal. The requirement of FRCP 73(e) appears to be a concession to the view that once an appeal
is perfected, the district court loses all power over its judgment. See In re Federal Facilities Trust,
227 F.2d 651 (7th Cir., 1955) and cases—cited at 654–655. No reason appears why all questions
related to supersedeas or the bond for costs on appeal should not be presented in the first instance

to the district court in the ordinary case.
Subdivision (b). The provisions respecting a surety upon a bond or other undertaking are
based upon FRCP 65.1.
Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules—1986 Amendment
The amendments to Rule 8(b) are technical. No substantive change is intended.
Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules—1995 Amendment
Subdivision (c). The amendment conforms subdivision (c) to previous amendments to Fed.
R. Crim. P. 38. This amendment strikes the reference to subdivision (a) of Fed. R. Crim. P. 38 so
that Fed. R. App. P. 8(c) refers instead to all of Criminal Rule 38. When Rule 8(c) was adopted
Fed. R. Crim. P. 38(a) included the procedures for obtaining a stay of execution when the sentence
in question was death, imprisonment, a fine, or probation. Criminal Rule 38 was later amended and
now addresses those topics in separate subdivisions. Subdivision 38(a) now addresses only stays
of death sentences. The proper cross reference is to all of Criminal Rule 38.
Committee Notes on Rules—1998 Amendment
The language and organization of the rule are amended to make the rule more easily
understood. In addition to changes made to improve the understanding, the Advisory Committee
has changed language to make style and terminology consistent throughout the appellate rules.
These changes are intended to be stylistic only.

Rule 38 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, referred to in subd. (c), are set out in
the Appendix to Title 18, Crimes and Criminal Procedure.

Rule 9. Release in a Criminal Case
(a) Release Before Judgment of Conviction.
(1) The district court must state in writing, or orally on the record, the reasons for an order
regarding the release or detention of a defendant in a criminal case. A party appealing from the
order must file with the court of appeals a copy of the district court's order and the court's statement
of reasons as soon as practicable after filing the notice of appeal. An appellant who questions the
factual basis for the district court's order must file a transcript of the release proceedings or an
explanation of why a transcript was not obtained.
(2) After reasonable notice to the appellee, the court of appeals must promptly determine
the appeal on the basis of the papers, affidavits, and parts of the record that the parties present or
the court requires. Unless the court so orders, briefs need not be filed.
(3) The court of appeals or one of its judges may order the defendant's release pending the
disposition of the appeal.
(b) Release After Judgment of Conviction. A party entitled to do so may obtain review of a

district-court order regarding release after a judgment of conviction by filing a notice of appeal
from that order in the district court, or by filing a motion in the court of appeals if the party has
already filed a notice of appeal from the judgment of conviction. Both the order and the review are
subject to Rule 9(a). The papers filed by the party seeking review must include a copy of the
judgment of conviction.
(c) Criteria for Release. The court must make its decision regarding release in accordance
with the applicable provisions of 18 U.S.C. §§3142, 3143, and 3145(c).
(As amended Apr. 24, 1972, eff. Oct. 1, 1972; Pub. L. 98–473, title II, §210, Oct. 12, 1984,
98 Stat. 1987; Apr. 29, 1994, eff. Dec. 1, 1994; Apr. 24, 1998, eff. Dec. 1, 1998.)
Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules—1967
Subdivision (a). The appealability of release orders entered prior to a judgment of
conviction is determined by the provisions of 18 U.S.C. §3147, as qualified by 18 U.S.C. §3148,
and by the rule announced in Stack v. Boyle, 342 U.S. 1, 72 S.Ct. 1, 96 L.Ed. 3 (1951), holding
certain orders respecting release appealable as final orders under 28 U.S.C. §1291. The language
of the rule, "(an)n appeal authorized by law from an order refusing or imposing conditions of
release," is intentionally broader than that used in 18 U.S.C. §3147 in describing orders made
appealable by that section. The summary procedure ordained by the rule is intended to apply to all
appeals from orders respecting release, and it would appear that at least some orders not made
appealable by 18 U.S.C. §3147 are nevertheless appealable under the Stack v. Boyle rationale. See,
for example, United States v. Foster, 278 F.2d 567 (2d Cir., 1960), holding appealable an order
refusing to extend bail limits. Note also the provisions of 18 U.S.C. §3148, which after
withdrawing from persons charged with an offense punishable by death and from those who have
been convicted of an offense the right of appeal granted by 18 U.S.C. §3147, expressly preserves
"other rights to judicial review of conditions of release or orders of detention."
The purpose of the subdivision is to insure the expeditious determination of appeals
respecting release orders, an expedition commanded by 18 U.S.C. §3147 and by the Court in Stack
v. Boyle, supra. It permits such appeals to be heard on an informal record without the necessity of
briefs and on reasonable notice. Equally important to the just and speedy disposition of these
appeals is the requirement that the district court state the reasons for its decision. See Jones v.
United States, 358 F.2d 543 (D.C. Cir., 1966); Rhodes v. United States, 275 F.2d 78 (4th Cir.,
1960); United States v. Williams, 253 F.2d 144 (7th Cir., 1958).
Subdivision (b). This subdivision regulates procedure for review of an order respecting
release at a time when the jurisdiction of the court of appeals has already attached by virtue of an
appeal from the judgment of conviction. Notwithstanding the fact that jurisdiction has passed to
the court of appeals, both 18 U.S.C. §3148 and FRCrP 38(c) contemplate that the initial
determination of whether a convicted defendant is to be released pending the appeal is to be made
by the district court. But at this point there is obviously no need for a separate appeal from the
order of the district court respecting release. The court of appeals or a judge thereof has power to
effect release on motion as an incident to the pending appeal. See FRCrP 38(c) and 46(a)(2). But
the motion is functionally identical with the appeal regulated by subdivision (a) and requires the
same speedy determination if relief is to be effective. Hence the similarity of the procedure
outlined in the two subdivisions.
Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules—1972 Amendment

Subdivision (c) is intended to bring the rule into conformity with 18 U.S.C. §3148 and to
allocate to the defendant the burden of establishing that he will not flee and that he poses no danger
to any other person or to the community. The burden is placed upon the defendant in the view that
the fact of his conviction justifies retention in custody in situations where doubt exists as to
whether he can be safely released pending disposition of his appeal. Release pending appeal may
also be denied if "it appears that an appeal is frivolous or taken for delay." 18 U.S.C. §3148. The
burden of establishing the existence of these criteria remains with the government.
Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules—1994 Amendment
Rule 9 has been entirely rewritten. The basic structure of the rule has been retained.
Subdivision (a) governs appeals from bail decisions made before the judgment of conviction is
entered at the time of sentencing. Subdivision (b) governs review of bail decisions made after
sentencing and pending appeal.
Subdivision (a). The subdivision applies to appeals from "an order regarding release or
detention" of a criminal defendant before judgment of conviction, i.e., before sentencing. See
Fed.R.Crim.P. 32. The old rule applied only to a defendant's appeal from an order "refusing or
imposing conditions of release." The new broader language is needed because the government is
now permitted to appeal bail decisions in certain circumstances. 18 U.S.C. §§3145 and 3731. For
the same reason, the rule now requires a district court to state reasons for its decision in all
instances, not only when it refuses release or imposes conditions on release.
The rule requires a party appealing from a district court's decision to supply the court of
appeals with a copy of the district court's order and its statement of reasons. In addition, an
appellant who questions the factual basis for the district court's decision must file a transcript of the
release proceedings, if possible. The rule also permits a court to require additional papers. A court
must act promptly to decide these appeals; lack of pertinent information can cause delays. The old
rule left the determination of what should be filed entirely within the party's discretion; it stated
that the court of appeals would hear the appeal "upon such papers, affidavits, and portions of the
record as the parties shall present."
Subdivision (b). This subdivision applies to review of a district court's decision regarding
release made after judgment of conviction. As in subdivision (a), the language has been changed to
accommodate the government's ability to seek review.
The word "review" is used in this subdivision, rather than "appeal" because review may be
obtained, in some instances, upon motion. Review may be obtained by motion if the party has
already filed a notice of appeal from the judgment of conviction. If the party desiring review of the
release decision has not filed such a notice of appeal, review may be obtained only by filing a
notice of appeal from the order regarding release.
The requirements of subdivision (a) apply to both the order and the review. That is, the
district court must state its reasons for the order. The party seeking review must supply the court of
appeals with the same information required by subdivision (a). In addition, the party seeking
review must also supply the court with information about the conviction and the sentence.
Subdivision (c). This subdivision has been amended to include references to the correct
statutory provisions.
Committee Notes on Rules—1998 Amendment
The language and organization of the rule are amended to make the rule more easily

understood. In addition to changes made to improve the understanding, the Advisory Committee
has changed language to make style and terminology consistent throughout the appellate rules.
These changes are intended to be stylistic only.
Amendment by Public Law
1984—Subd. (c). Pub. L. 98–473 substituted "3143" for "3148" and inserted "and that the
appeal is not for purpose of delay and raises a substantial question of law or fact likely to result in
reversal or in an order for a new trial" after "community".

Rule 10. The Record on Appeal
(a) Composition of the Record on Appeal. The following items constitute the record on
appeal:
(1) the original papers and exhibits filed in the district court;
(2) the transcript of proceedings, if any; and
(3) a certified copy of the docket entries prepared by the district clerk.
(b) The Transcript of Proceedings.
(1) Appellant's Duty to Order. Within 14 days after filing the notice of appeal or entry of an
order disposing of the last timely remaining motion of a type specified in Rule 4(a)(4)(A),
whichever is later, the appellant must do either of the following:
(A) order from the reporter a transcript of such parts of the proceedings not already on file
as the appellant considers necessary, subject to a local rule of the court of appeals and with the
following qualifications:
(i) the order must be in writing;
(ii) if the cost of the transcript is to be paid by the United States under the Criminal Justice
Act, the order must so state; and
(iii) the appellant must, within the same period, file a copy of the order with the district
clerk; or
(B) file a certificate stating that no transcript will be ordered.
(2) Unsupported Finding or Conclusion. If the appellant intends to urge on appeal that a
finding or conclusion is unsupported by the evidence or is contrary to the evidence, the appellant
must include in the record a transcript of all evidence relevant to that finding or conclusion.
(3) Partial Transcript. Unless the entire transcript is ordered:
(A) the appellant must—within the 14 days provided in Rule 10(b)(1)—file a statement of
the issues that the appellant intends to present on the appeal and must serve on the appellee a copy
of both the order or certificate and the statement;
(B) if the appellee considers it necessary to have a transcript of other parts of the
proceedings, the appellee must, within 14 days after the service of the order or certificate and the
statement of the issues, file and serve on the appellant a designation of additional parts to be
ordered; and
(C) unless within 14 days after service of that designation the appellant has ordered all such
parts, and has so notified the appellee, the appellee may within the following 14 days either order

the parts or move in the district court for an order requiring the appellant to do so.
(4) Payment. At the time of ordering, a party must make satisfactory arrangements with the
reporter for paying the cost of the transcript.
(c) Statement of the Evidence When the Proceedings Were Not Recorded or When a
Transcript Is Unavailable. If the transcript of a hearing or trial is unavailable, the appellant may
prepare a statement of the evidence or proceedings from the best available means, including the
appellant's recollection. The statement must be served on the appellee, who may serve objections
or proposed amendments within 14 days after being served. The statement and any objections or
proposed amendments must then be submitted to the district court for settlement and approval. As
settled and approved, the statement must be included by the district clerk in the record on appeal.
(d) Agreed Statement as the Record on Appeal. In place of the record on appeal as defined
in Rule 10(a), the parties may prepare, sign, and submit to the district court a statement of the case
showing how the issues presented by the appeal arose and were decided in the district court. The
statement must set forth only those facts averred and proved or sought to be proved that are
essential to the court's resolution of the issues. If the statement is truthful, it—together with any
additions that the district court may consider necessary to a full presentation of the issues on
appeal—must be approved by the district court and must then be certified to the court of appeals as
the record on appeal. The district clerk must then send it to the circuit clerk within the time
provided by Rule 11. A copy of the agreed statement may be filed in place of the appendix required
by Rule 30.
(e) Correction or Modification of the Record.
(1) If any difference arises about whether the record truly discloses what occurred in the
district court, the difference must be submitted to and settled by that court and the record
conformed accordingly.
(2) If anything material to either party is omitted from or misstated in the record by error or
accident, the omission or misstatement may be corrected and a supplemental record may be
certified and forwarded:
(A) on stipulation of the parties;
(B) by the district court before or after the record has been forwarded; or
(C) by the court of appeals.
(3) All other questions as to the form and content of the record must be presented to the
court of appeals.

Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules—1967
This rule is derived from FRCP 75(a), (b), (c) and (d) and FRCP 76, without change in
substance.
Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules—1979 Amendment
The proposed amendments to Rule 10(b) would require the appellant to place with the

reporter a written order for the transcript of proceedings and file a copy with the clerk, and to
indicate on the order if the transcript is to be provided under the Criminal Justice Act. If the
appellant does not plan to order a transcript of any of the proceedings, he must file a certificate to
that effect. These requirements make the appellant's steps in readying the appeal a matter of record
and give the district court notice of requests for transcripts at the expense of the United States
under the Criminal Justice Act. They are also the third step in giving the court of appeals some
control over the production and transmission of the record. See Note to Rules 3(d)(e) above and
Rule 11 below.
In the event the appellant orders no transcript, or orders a transcript of less than all the
proceedings, the procedure under the proposed amended rule remains substantially as before. The
appellant must serve on the appellee a copy of his order or in the event no order is placed, of the
certificate to that effect, and a statement of the issues he intends to present on appeal, and the
appellee may thereupon designate additional parts of the transcript to be included, and upon
appellant's refusal to order the additional parts, may either order them himself or seek an order
requiring the appellant to order them. The only change proposed in this procedure is to place a 10
day time limit on motions to require the appellant to order the additional portions.
Rule 10(b) is made subject to local rules of the courts of appeals in recognition of the
practice in some circuits in some classes of cases, e. g., appeals by indigents in criminal cases after
a short trial, of ordering immediate preparation of a complete transcript, thus making compliance
with the rule unnecessary.
Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules—1986 Amendment
The amendments to Rules 10(b) and (c) are technical. No substantive change is intended.
Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules—1993 Amendment
The amendment is technical and no substantive change is intended.
Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules—1995 Amendment
Subdivision (b)(1). The amendment conforms this rule to amendments made in Rule
4(a)(4) in 1993. The amendments to Rule 4(a)(4) provide that certain postjudgment motions have
the effect of suspending a filed notice of appeal until the disposition of the last of such motions.
The purpose of this amendment is to suspend the 10-day period for ordering a transcript if a timely
postjudgment motion is made and a notice of appeal is suspended under Rule 4(a)(4). The 10-day
period set forth in the first sentence of this rule begins to run when the order disposing of the last of
such postjudgment motions outstanding is entered.
Committee Notes on Rules—1998 Amendment
The language and organization of the rule are amended to make the rule more easily
understood. In addition to changes made to improve the understanding, the Advisory Committee
has changed language to make style and terminology consistent throughout the appellate rules.

The Criminal Justice Act, referred to in subd. (b)(1)(A)(ii), probably means the Criminal
Justice Act of 1964, Pub. L. 88–455, Aug. 20, 1964, 78 Stat. 552, as amended, which enacted
section 3006A of Title 18, Crimes and Criminal Procedure, and provisions set out as notes under
section 3006A of Title 18. For complete classification of this Act to the Code, see Short Title note
set out under section 3006A of Title 18 and Tables.

Rule 11. Forwarding the Record
(a) Appellant's Duty. An appellant filing a notice of appeal must comply with Rule 10(b)
and must do whatever else is necessary to enable the clerk to assemble and forward the record. If
there are multiple appeals from a judgment or order, the clerk must forward a single record.
(b) Duties of Reporter and District Clerk.
(1) Reporter's Duty to Prepare and File a Transcript. The reporter must prepare and file a
transcript as follows:
(A) Upon receiving an order for a transcript, the reporter must enter at the foot of the order
the date of its receipt and the expected completion date and send a copy, so endorsed, to the circuit
clerk.
(B) If the transcript cannot be completed within 30 days of the reporter's receipt of the
order, the reporter may request the circuit clerk to grant additional time to complete it. The clerk
must note on the docket the action taken and notify the parties.
(C) When a transcript is complete, the reporter must file it with the district clerk and notify
the circuit clerk of the filing.
(D) If the reporter fails to file the transcript on time, the circuit clerk must notify the district
judge and do whatever else the court of appeals directs.
(2) District Clerk's Duty to Forward. When the record is complete, the district clerk must
number the documents constituting the record and send them promptly to the circuit clerk together
with a list of the documents correspondingly numbered and reasonably identified. Unless directed
to do so by a party or the circuit clerk, the district clerk will not send to the court of appeals
documents of unusual bulk or weight, physical exhibits other than documents, or other parts of the
record designated for omission by local rule of the court of appeals. If the exhibits are unusually
bulky or heavy, a party must arrange with the clerks in advance for their transportation and receipt.
(c) Retaining the Record Temporarily in the District Court for Use in Preparing the Appeal.
The parties may stipulate, or the district court on motion may order, that the district clerk retain the
record temporarily for the parties to use in preparing the papers on appeal. In that event the district
clerk must certify to the circuit clerk that the record on appeal is complete. Upon receipt of the
appellee's brief, or earlier if the court orders or the parties agree, the appellant must request the
district clerk to forward the record.
(d) [Abrogated.]

(e) Retaining the Record by Court Order.
(1) The court of appeals may, by order or local rule, provide that a certified copy of the
docket entries be forwarded instead of the entire record. But a party may at any time during the
appeal request that designated parts of the record be forwarded.
(2) The district court may order the record or some part of it retained if the court needs it
while the appeal is pending, subject, however, to call by the court of appeals.
(3) If part or all of the record is ordered retained, the district clerk must send to the court of
appeals a copy of the order and the docket entries together with the parts of the original record
allowed by the district court and copies of any parts of the record designated by the parties.
(f) Retaining Parts of the Record in the District Court by Stipulation of the Parties. The
parties may agree by written stipulation filed in the district court that designated parts of the record
be retained in the district court subject to call by the court of appeals or request by a party. The
parts of the record so designated remain a part of the record on appeal.
(g) Record for a Preliminary Motion in the Court of Appeals. If, before the record is
forwarded, a party makes any of the following motions in the court of appeals:
• for dismissal;
• for release;
• for a stay pending appeal;
• for additional security on the bond on appeal or on a supersedeas bond; or
• for any other intermediate order—
the district clerk must send the court of appeals any parts of the record designated by any
party.

Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules—1967
Subdivisions (a) and (b). These subdivisions are derived from FRCP 73(g) and FRCP
75(e). FRCP 75(e) presently directs the clerk of the district court to transmit the record within the
time allowed or fixed for its filing, which, under the provisions of FRCP 73(g) is within 40 days
from the date of filing the notice of appeal, unless an extension is obtained from the district court.
The precise time at which the record must be transmitted thus depends upon the time required for
delivery of the record from the district court to the court of appeals, since, to permit its timely
filing, it must reach the court of appeals before expiration of the 40-day period of an extension
thereof. Subdivision (a) of this rule provides that the record is to be transmitted within the 40-day
period, or any extension thereof; subdivision (b) provides that transmission is effected when the
clerk of the district court mails or otherwise forwards the record to the clerk of the court of appeals;
Rule 12(b) directs the clerk of the court of appeals to file the record upon its receipt following
timely docketing and transmittal. It can thus be determined with certainty precisely when the clerk
of the district court must forward the record to the clerk of the court of appeals in order to effect
timely filing: the final day of the 40-day period or of any extension thereof.
Subdivision (c). This subdivision is derived from FRCP 75(e) without change of substance.
Subdivision (d). This subdivision is derived from FRCP 73(g) and FRCrP 39(c). Under
present rules the district court is empowered to extend the time for filing the record and docketing
the appeal. Since under the proposed rule timely transmission now insures timely filing (see note

to subdivisions (a) and (b) above) the power of the district court is expressed in terms of its power
to extend the time for transmitting the record. Restriction of that power to a period of 90 days after
the filing of the notice of appeal represents a change in the rule with respect to appeals in criminal
cases. FRCrP 39(c) now permits the district court to extend the time for filing and docketing
without restriction. No good reason appears for a difference between the civil and criminal rule in
this regard, and subdivision (d) limits the power of the district court to extend the time for
transmitting the record in all cases to 90 days from the date of filing the notice of appeal, just as its
power is now limited with respect to docketing and filing in civil cases. Subdivision (d) makes
explicit the power of the court of appeals to permit the record to be filed at any time. See Pyramid
Motor Freight Corporation v. Ispass, 330, U.S. 695, 67 S.Ct. 954, 91 L.Ed. 1184 (1947).
Subdivisions (e), (f) and (g). These subdivisions are derived from FRCP 75(f), (a) and (g),
respectively, without change of substance.
Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules—1979 Amendment
Under present Rule 11(a) it is provided that the record shall be transmitted to the court of
appeals within 40 days after the filing of the notice of appeal. Under present Rule 11(d) the district
court, on request made during the initial time or any extension thereof, and cause shown, may
extend the time for the transmission of the record to a point not more than 90 days after the filing of
the first notice of appeal. If the district court is without authority to grant a request to extend the
time, or denies a request for extension, the appellant may make a motion for extension of time in
the court of appeals. Thus the duty to see that the record is transmitted is placed on the appellant.
Aside from ordering the transcript within the time prescribed the appellant has no control over the
time at which the record is transmitted, since all steps beyond this point are in the hands of the
reporter and the clerk. The proposed amendments recognize this fact and place the duty directly on
the reporter and the clerk. After receiving the written order for the transcript (See Note to Rule
10(b) above), the reporter must acknowledge its receipt, indicate when he expects to have it
completed, and mail the order so endorsed to the clerk of the court of appeals. Requests for
extensions of time must be made by the reporter to the clerk of the court of appeals and action on
such requests is entered on the docket. Thus from the point at which the transcript is ordered the
clerk of the court of appeals is made aware of any delays. If the transcript is not filed on time, the
clerk of the court of appeals will notify the district judge.
Present Rule 11(b) provides that the record shall be transmitted when it is "complete for the
purposes of the appeal." The proposed amended rule continues this requirement. The record is
complete for the purposes of the appeal when it contains the original papers on file in the clerk's
office, all necessary exhibits, and the transcript, if one is to be included. Cf. present Rule 11(c).
The original papers will be in the custody of the clerk of the district court at the time the notice of
appeal is filed. See Rule 5(e) of the F.R.C.P. The custody of exhibits is often the subject of local
rules. Some of them require that documentary exhibits must be deposited with the clerk. See Local
Rule 13 of the Eastern District of Virginia. Others leave exhibits with counsel, subject to order of
the court. See Local Rule 33 of the Northern District of Illinois. If under local rules the custody of
exhibits is left with counsel, the district court should make adequate provision for their
preservation during the time during which an appeal may be taken, the prompt deposit with the
clerk of such as under Rule 11(b) are to be transmitted to the court of appeals, and the availability
of others in the event that the court of appeals should require their transmission. Cf. Local Rule 11
of the Second Circuit.
Usually the record will be complete with the filing of the transcript. While the proposed

amendment requires transmission "forthwith" when the record is complete, it was not designed to
preclude a local requirement by the court of appeals that the original papers and exhibits be
transmitted when complete without awaiting the filing of the transcript.
The proposed amendments continue the provision in the present rule that documents of
unusual bulk or weight and physical exhibits other than documents shall not be transmitted without
direction by the parties or by the court of appeals, and the requirement that the parties make special
arrangements for transmission and receipt of exhibits of unusual bulk or weight. In addition, they
give recognition to local rules that make transmission of other record items subject to order of the
court of appeals. See Local Rule 4 of the Seventh Circuit.
Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules—1986 Amendment
The amendments to Rule 11(b) are technical. No substantive change is intended.
Committee Notes on Rules—1998 Amendment
The language and organization of the rule are amended to make the rule more easily
understood. In addition to changes made to improve the understanding, the Advisory Committee
has changed language to make style and terminology consistent throughout the appellate rules.
These changes are intended to be stylistic only.

Rule 12. Docketing the Appeal; Filing a Representation Statement; Filing the
Record
(a) Docketing the Appeal. Upon receiving the copy of the notice of appeal and the docket
entries from the district clerk under Rule 3(d), the circuit clerk must docket the appeal under the
title of the district-court action and must identify the appellant, adding the appellant's name if
necessary.
(b) Filing a Representation Statement. Unless the court of appeals designates another time,
the attorney who filed the notice of appeal must, within 14 days after filing the notice, file a
statement with the circuit clerk naming the parties that the attorney represents on appeal.
(c) Filing the Record, Partial Record, or Certificate. Upon receiving the record, partial
record, or district clerk's certificate as provided in Rule 11, the circuit clerk must file it and
immediately notify all parties of the filing date.
(As amended Apr. 1, 1979, eff. Aug. 1, 1979; Mar. 10, 1986, eff. July 1, 1986; Apr. 22,
1993, eff. Dec. 1, 1993; Apr. 24, 1998, eff. Dec. 1, 1998; Mar. 26, 2009, eff. Dec. 1, 2009.)
Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules—1967
Subdivision (a). All that is involved in the docketing of an appeal is the payment of the
docket fee. In practice, after the clerk of the court of appeals receives the record from the clerk of
the district court he notifies the appellant of its receipt and requests payment of the fee. Upon
receipt of the fee, the clerk enters the appeal upon the docket and files the record. The appellant is
allowed to pay the fee at any time within the time allowed or fixed for transmission of the record
and thereby to discharge his responsibility for docketing. The final sentence is added in the interest
of facilitating future reference and citation and location of cases in indexes. Compare 3d Cir. Rule

10(2); 4th Cir. Rule 9(8); 6th Cir. Rule 14(1).
Subdivision (c). The rules of the circuits generally permit the appellee to move for
dismissal in the event the appellant fails to effect timely filing of the record. See 1st Cir. Rule
21(3); 3d Cir. Rule 21(4); 5th Cir. Rule 16(1); 8th Cir. Rule 7(d).
Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules—1979 Amendment
Subdivision (a). Under present Rule 12(a) the appellant must pay the docket fee within the
time fixed for the transmission of the record, and upon timely payment of the fee, the appeal is
docketed. The proposed amendment takes the docketing out of the hands of the appellant. The fee
is paid at the time the notice of appeal is filed and the appeal is entered on the docket upon receipt
of a copy of the notice of appeal and of the docket entries, which are sent to the court of appeals
under the provisions of Rule 3(d). This is designed to give the court of appeals control of its docket
at the earliest possible time so that within the limits of its facilities and personnel it can screen
cases for appropriately different treatment, expedite the proceedings through prehearing
conferences or otherwise, and in general plan more effectively for the prompt disposition of cases.
Subdivision (b). The proposed amendment conforms the provision to the changes in Rule
11.
Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules—1986 Amendment
The amendment to Rule 12(a) is technical. No substantive change is intended.
Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules—1993 Amendment
Note to new subdivision (b). This amendment is a companion to the amendment of Rule
3(c). The Rule 3(c) amendment allows an attorney who represents more than one party on appeal
to "specify" the appellants by general description rather than by naming them individually. The
requirement added here is that whenever an attorney files a notice of appeal, the attorney must
soon thereafter file a statement indicating all parties represented on the appeal by that attorney.
Although the notice of appeal is the jurisdictional document and it must clearly indicate who is
bringing the appeal, the representation statement will be helpful especially to the court of appeals
in identifying the individual appellants.
The rule allows a court of appeals to require the filing of the representation statement at
some time other than specified in the rule so that if a court of appeals requires a docketing
statement or appearance form the representation statement may be combined with it.
Committee Notes on Rules—1998 Amendment
The language of the rule is amended to make the rule more easily understood. In addition to
changes made to improve the understanding, the Advisory Committee has changed language to
make style and terminology consistent throughout the appellate rules. These changes are intended
to be stylistic only.
Committee Notes on Rules—2009 Amendment
Subdivision (b). The time set in the former rule at 10 days has been revised to 14 days. See

the Note to Rule 26.

Rule 12.1. Remand After an Indicative Ruling by the District Court on a
Motion for Relief That Is Barred by a Pending Appeal
(a) Notice to the Court of Appeals. If a timely motion is made in the district court for relief
that it lacks authority to grant because of an appeal that has been docketed and is pending, the
movant must promptly notify the circuit clerk if the district court states either that it would grant
the motion or that the motion raises a substantial issue.
(b) Remand After an Indicative Ruling. If the district court states that it would grant the
motion or that the motion raises a substantial issue, the court of appeals may remand for further
proceedings but retains jurisdiction unless it expressly dismisses the appeal. If the court of appeals
remands but retains jurisdiction, the parties must promptly notify the circuit clerk when the district
court has decided the motion on remand.
(As added Mar. 26, 2009, eff. Dec. 1, 2009.)
Committee Notes on Rules—2009
This new rule corresponds to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 62.1, which adopts for any
motion that the district court cannot grant because of a pending appeal the practice that most courts
follow when a party moves under Civil Rule 60(b) to vacate a judgment that is pending on appeal.
After an appeal has been docketed and while it remains pending, the district court cannot grant
relief under a rule such as Civil Rule 60(b) without a remand. But it can entertain the motion and
deny it, defer consideration, state that it would grant the motion if the court of appeals remands for
that purpose, or state that the motion raises a substantial issue. Experienced lawyers often refer to
the suggestion for remand as an "indicative ruling." (Appellate Rule 4(a)(4) lists six motions that,
if filed within the relevant time limit, suspend the effect of a notice of appeal filed before or after
the motion is filed until the last such motion is disposed of. The district court has authority to grant
the motion without resorting to the indicative ruling procedure.)
The procedure formalized by Rule 12.1 is helpful when relief is sought from an order that
the court cannot reconsider because the order is the subject of a pending appeal. In the criminal
context, the Committee anticipates that Rule 12.1 will be used primarily if not exclusively for
newly discovered evidence motions under Criminal Rule 33(b)(1) (see United States v. Cronic,
466 U.S. 648, 667 n.42 (1984)), reduced sentence motions under Criminal Rule 35(b), and motions
under 18 U.S.C. §3582(c).
Rule 12.1 does not attempt to define the circumstances in which an appeal limits or defeats
the district court's authority to act in the face of a pending appeal. The rules that govern the
relationship between trial courts and appellate courts may be complex, depending in part on the
nature of the order and the source of appeal jurisdiction. Appellate Rule 12.1 applies only when
those rules deprive the district court of authority to grant relief without appellate permission.
To ensure proper coordination of proceedings in the district court and in the court of
appeals, the movant must notify the circuit clerk if the district court states that it would grant the
motion or that the motion raises a substantial issue. The "substantial issue" standard may be
illustrated by the following hypothetical: The district court grants summary judgment dismissing a
case. While the plaintiff's appeal is pending, the plaintiff moves for relief from the judgment,
claiming newly discovered evidence and also possible fraud by the defendant during the discovery

process. If the district court reviews the motion and indicates that the motion "raises a substantial
issue," the court of appeals may well wish to remand rather than proceed to determine the appeal.
If the district court states that it would grant the motion or that the motion raises a
substantial issue, the movant may ask the court of appeals to remand so that the district court can
make its final ruling on the motion. In accordance with Rule 47(a)(1), a local rule may prescribe
the format for the litigants' notifications and the district court's statement.
Remand is in the court of appeals' discretion. The court of appeals may remand all
proceedings, terminating the initial appeal. In the context of postjudgment motions, however, that
procedure should be followed only when the appellant has stated clearly its intention to abandon
the appeal. The danger is that if the initial appeal is terminated and the district court then denies the
requested relief, the time for appealing the initial judgment will have run out and a court might rule
that the appellant is limited to appealing the denial of the postjudgment motion. The latter appeal
may well not provide the appellant with the opportunity to raise all the challenges that could have
been raised on appeal from the underlying judgment. See, e.g., Browder v. Dir., Dep't of
Corrections of Ill., 434 U.S. 257, 263 n.7 (1978) ("[A]n appeal from denial of Rule 60(b) relief
does not bring up the underlying judgment for review."). The Committee does not endorse the
notion that a court of appeals should decide that the initial appeal was abandoned—despite the
absence of any clear statement of intent to abandon the appeal—merely because an unlimited
remand occurred, but the possibility that a court might take that troubling view underscores the
need for caution in delimiting the scope of the remand.
The court of appeals may instead choose to remand for the sole purpose of ruling on the
motion while retaining jurisdiction to proceed with the appeal after the district court rules on the
motion (if the appeal is not moot at that point and if any party wishes to proceed). This will often
be the preferred course in the light of the concerns expressed above. It is also possible that the
court of appeals may wish to proceed to hear the appeal even after the district court has granted
relief on remand; thus, even when the district court indicates that it would grant relief, the court of
appeals may in appropriate circumstances choose a limited rather than unlimited remand.
If the court of appeals remands but retains jurisdiction, subdivision (b) requires the parties
to notify the circuit clerk when the district court has decided the motion on remand. This is a joint
obligation that is discharged when the required notice is given by any litigant involved in the
motion in the district court.
When relief is sought in the district court during the pendency of an appeal, litigants should
bear in mind the likelihood that a new or amended notice of appeal will be necessary in order to
challenge the district court's disposition of the motion. See, e.g., Jordan v. Bowen, 808 F.2d 733,
736–37 (10th Cir. 1987) (viewing district court's response to appellant's motion for indicative
ruling as a denial of appellant's request for relief under Rule 60(b), and refusing to review that
denial because appellant had failed to take an appeal from the denial); TAAG Linhas Aereas de
Angola v. Transamerica Airlines, Inc., 915 F.2d 1351, 1354 (9th Cir. 1990) ("[W]here a 60(b)
motion is filed subsequent to the notice of appeal and considered by the district court after a
limited remand, an appeal specifically from the ruling on the motion must be taken if the issues
raised in that motion are to be considered by the Court of Appeals.").
Changes Made After Publication and Comment. No changes were made to the text of Rule
12.1. The Appellate Rules Committee made two changes to the Note in response to public
comments, and made additional changes in consultation with the Civil Rules Committee and in
response to some Appellate Rules Committee members' suggestions. The Standing Committee
made two further changes to the Note.

As published for comment, the second paragraph of the Note read: "[Appellate Rule 12.1 is
not limited to the Civil Rule 62.1 context; Rule 12.1 may also be used, for example, in connection
with motions under Criminal Rule 33. See United States v. Cronic, 466 U.S. 648, 667 n.42 (1984).]
The procedure formalized by Rule 12.1 is helpful whenever relief is sought from an order that the
court cannot reconsider because the order is the subject of a pending appeal." The Appellate Rules
Committee discussed the Solicitor General's concern that Appellate Rule 12.1 might be misused in
the criminal context. In response, the Appellate Rules Committee deleted the second paragraph as
published and substituted the following language: "The procedure formalized by Rule 12.1 is
helpful when relief is sought from an order that the court cannot reconsider because the order is the
subject of a pending appeal. In the criminal context, the Committee anticipates that Rule 12.1's use
will be limited to newly discovered evidence motions under Criminal Rule 33(b)(1) (see United
States v. Cronic, 466 U.S. 648, 667 n.42 (1984)), reduced sentence motions under Criminal Rule
35(b), and motions under 18 U.S.C. §3582(c)." The Standing Committee further revised the latter
sentence to read: "In the criminal context, the Committee anticipates that Rule 12.1 will be used
primarily if not exclusively for newly discovered evidence motions under Criminal Rule 33(b)(1)
(see United States v. Cronic, 466 U.S. 648, 667 n.42 (1984)), reduced sentence motions under
Criminal Rule 35(b), and motions under 18 U.S.C. §3582(c)."
As published for comment, the first sentence of the Note's last paragraph read: "When
relief is sought in the district court during the pendency of an appeal, litigants should bear in mind
the likelihood that a separate notice of appeal will be necessary in order to challenge the district
court's disposition of the motion." In response to a suggestion by Public Citizen, the Appellate
Rules Committee revised this sentence to refer to a "new or amended" notice of appeal rather than
a "separate" notice of appeal.
The Appellate Rules Committee, in consultation with the Civil Rules Committee, added
the following parenthetical at the end of the Note's first paragraph: "(The effect of a notice of
appeal on district-court authority is addressed by Appellate Rule 4(a)(4), which lists six motions
that, if filed within the relevant time limit, suspend the effect of a notice of appeal filed before or
after the motion is filed until the last such motion is disposed of. The district court has authority to
grant the motion without resorting to the indicative ruling procedure.)" This parenthetical is
designed to forestall confusion concerning the effect of tolling motions on a district court's power
to act. The Standing Committee approved a change to the first sentence of the parenthetical; it now
reads: "Appellate Rule 4(a)(4) lists six motions that, if filed within the relevant time limit, suspend
the effect of a notice of appeal filed before or after the motion is filed until the last such motion is
disposed of."
The Appellate Rules Committee, acting at the suggestion of the Civil Rules Committee,
altered the wording of one sentence in the first paragraph and one sentence in the fifth paragraph of
the Note. The changes are designed to remove references to remands of "the action," since those
references would be in tension with the Note's advice concerning the advisability of limited
remands. Thus, in the Note's first paragraph "if the action is remanded" became "if the court of
appeals remands for that purpose," and in the Note's fifth paragraph "may ask the court of appeals
to remand the action" became "may ask the court of appeals to remand."
The Appellate Rules Committee also made stylistic changes to the Note's first and third
paragraphs. "Experienced appeal lawyers" became "Experienced lawyers," and "act in face of a
pending appeal" became "act in the face of a pending appeal."

TITLE III. APPEALS FROM THE UNITED STATES TAX COURT
Rule 13. Appeals from the Tax Court
(a) Appeal as of Right.
(1) How Obtained; Time for Filing a Notice of Appeal.
(A) An appeal as of right from the United States Tax Court is commenced by filing a notice
of appeal with the Tax Court clerk within 90 days after the entry of the Tax Court's decision. At the
time of filing, the appellant must furnish the clerk with enough copies of the notice to enable the
clerk to comply with Rule 3(d). If one party files a timely notice of appeal, any other party may file
a notice of appeal within 120 days after the Tax Court's decision is entered.
(B) If, under Tax Court rules, a party makes a timely motion to vacate or revise the Tax
Court's decision, the time to file a notice of appeal runs from the entry of the order disposing of the
motion or from the entry of a new decision, whichever is later.
(2) Notice of Appeal; How Filed. The notice of appeal may be filed either at the Tax Court
clerk's office in the District of Columbia or by mail addressed to the clerk. If sent by mail the
notice is considered filed on the postmark date, subject to §7502 of the Internal Revenue Code, as
amended, and the applicable regulations.
(3) Contents of the Notice of Appeal; Service; Effect of Filing and Service. Rule 3
prescribes the contents of a notice of appeal, the manner of service, and the effect of its filing and
service. Form 2 in the Appendix of Forms is a suggested form of a notice of appeal.
(4) The Record on Appeal; Forwarding; Filing.
(A) Except as otherwise provided under Tax Court rules for the transcript of proceedings,
the appeal is governed by the parts of Rules 10, 11, and 12 regarding the record on appeal from a
district court, the time and manner of forwarding and filing, and the docketing in the court of
appeals.
(B) If an appeal is taken to more than one court of appeals, the original record must be sent
to the court named in the first notice of appeal filed. In an appeal to any other court of appeals, the
appellant must apply to that other court to make provision for the record.
(b) Appeal by Permission. An appeal by permission is governed by Rule 5.
(As amended Apr. 1, 1979, eff. Aug. 1, 1979; Apr. 29, 1994, eff. Dec. 1, 1994; Apr. 24,
1998, eff. Dec. 1, 1998; Apr. 16, 2013, eff. Dec. 1, 2013.)
Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules—1967
Subdivision (a). This subdivision effects two changes in practice respecting review of Tax
Court decisions: (1) Section 7483 of the Internal Revenue Code, 68A Stat. 891, 26 U.S.C. §7483,
provides that review of a Tax Court decision may be obtained by filing a petition for review. The
subdivision provides for review by the filing of the simple and familiar notice of appeal used to
obtain review of district court judgments; (2) Section 7483, supra, requires that a petition for
review be filed within 3 months after a decision is rendered, and provides that if a petition is so
filed by one party, any other party may file a petition for review within 4 months after the decision

is rendered. In the interest of fixing the time for review with precision, the proposed rule
substitutes "90 days" and "120 days" for the statutory "3 months" and "4 months", respectively.
The power of the Court to regulate these details of practice is clear. Title 28 U.S.C. §2072, as
amended by the Act of November 6, 1966, 80 Stat. 1323 (1 U.S. Code Cong. & Ad. News, p. 1546
(1966)), authorizes the Court to regulate ". . . practice and procedure in proceedings for the review
by the courts of appeals of decisions of the Tax Court of the United States. . . ."
The second paragraph states the settled teaching of the case law. See Robert Louis
Stevenson Apartments, Inc. v. C.I.R., 337 F.2d 681, 10 A.L.R.3d 112 (8th Cir., 1964); Denholm &
McKay Co. v. C.I.R., 132 F.2d 243 (1st Cir., 1942); Helvering v. Continental Oil Co., 63 App.D.C.
5, 68 F.2d 750 (1934); Burnet v. Lexington Ice & Coal Co., 62 F.2d 906 (4th Cir., 1933); Griffiths
v. C.I.R., 50 F.2d 782 (7th Cir., 1931).
Subdivision (b). The subdivision incorporates the statutory provision (Title 26, U.S.C.
§7502) that timely mailing is to be treated as timely filing. The statute contains special provisions
respecting other than ordinary mailing. If the notice of appeal is sent by registered mail,
registration is deemed prima facie evidence that the notice was delivered to the clerk of the Tax
Court, and the date of registration is deemed the postmark date. If the notice of appeal is sent by
certified mail, the effect of certification with respect to prima facie evidence of delivery and the
postmark date depends upon regulations of the Secretary of the Treasury. The effect of a postmark
made other than by the United States Post Office likewise depends upon regulations of the
Secretary. Current regulations are found in 26 CFR §301.7502–1.
Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules—1979 Amendment
The proposed amendment reflects the change in the title of the Tax Court to "United States
Tax Court." See 26 U.S.C. §7441.
Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules—1994 Amendment
Subdivision (a). The amendment requires a party filing a notice of appeal to provide the
court with sufficient copies of the notice for service on all other parties.
Committee Notes on Rules—1998 Amendment
The language and organization of the rule are amended to make the rule more easily
understood. In addition to changes made to improve the understanding, the Advisory Committee
has changed language to make style and terminology consistent throughout the appellate rules.
These changes are intended to be stylistic only.
Committee Notes on Rules—2013 Amendment
Rules 13 and 14 are amended to address the treatment of permissive interlocutory appeals
from the Tax Court under 26 U.S.C. §7482(a)(2). Rules 13 and 14 do not currently address such
appeals; instead, those Rules address only appeals as of right from the Tax Court. The existing
Rule 13—governing appeals as of right—is revised and becomes Rule 13(a). New subdivision (b)
provides that Rule 5 governs appeals by permission. The definition of district court and district
clerk in current subdivision (d)(1) is deleted; definitions are now addressed in Rule 14. The caption
of Title III is amended to reflect the broadened application of this Title.

Changes Made After Publication and Comment. No changes were made after publication
and comment.
References in Text
Section 7502 of the Internal Revenue Code, referred to in subd. (b), is classified to section
112 of Title 26, Internal Revenue Code.

Rule 14. Applicability of Other Rules to Appeals from the Tax Court
All provisions of these rules, except Rules 4, 6–9, 15–20, and 22–23, apply to appeals from
the Tax Court. References in any applicable rule (other than Rule 24(a)) to the district court and
district clerk are to be read as referring to the Tax Court and its clerk.
(As amended Apr. 24, 1998, eff. Dec. 1, 1998; Apr. 16, 2013, eff. Dec. 1, 2013.)
Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules—1967
The proposed rule continues the present uniform practice of the circuits of regulating
review of decisions of the Tax Court by the general rules applicable to appeals from judgments of
the district courts.
Committee Notes on Rules—1998 Amendment
The language of the rule is amended to make the rule more easily understood. In addition to
changes made to improve the understanding, the Advisory Committee has changed language to
make style and terminology consistent throughout the appellate rules. These changes are intended
to be stylistic only.
Committee Notes on Rules—2013 Amendment
Rule 13 currently addresses appeals as of right from the Tax Court, and Rule 14 currently
addresses the applicability of the Appellate Rules to such appeals. Rule 13 is amended to add a
new subdivision (b) treating permissive interlocutory appeals from the Tax Court under 26 U.S.C.
§7482(a)(2). Rule 14 is amended to address the applicability of the Appellate Rules to both appeals
as of right and appeals by permission. Because the latter are governed by Rule 5, that rule is
deleted from Rule 14's list of inapplicable provisions. Rule 14 is amended to define the terms
"district court" and "district clerk" in applicable rules (excluding Rule 24(a)) to include the Tax
Court and its clerk. Rule 24(a) is excluded from this definition because motions to appeal from the
Tax Court in forma pauperis are governed by Rule 24(b), not Rule 24(a).
Changes Made After Publication and Comment. No changes were made after publication
and comment.

TITLE IV. REVIEW OR ENFORCEMENT OF AN ORDER OF AN
ADMINISTRATIVE AGENCY, BOARD, COMMISSION, OR OFFICER
Rule 15. Review or Enforcement of an Agency Order—How Obtained;

Intervention
(a) Petition for Review; Joint Petition.
(1) Review of an agency order is commenced by filing, within the time prescribed by law,
a petition for review with the clerk of a court of appeals authorized to review the agency order. If
their interests make joinder practicable, two or more persons may join in a petition to the same
court to review the same order.
(2) The petition must:
(A) name each party seeking review either in the caption or the body of the petition—using
such terms as "et al.," "petitioners," or "respondents" does not effectively name the parties;
(B) name the agency as a respondent (even though not named in the petition, the United
States is a respondent if required by statute); and
(C) specify the order or part thereof to be reviewed.
(3) Form 3 in the Appendix of Forms is a suggested form of a petition for review.
(4) In this rule "agency" includes an agency, board, commission, or officer; "petition for
review" includes a petition to enjoin, suspend, modify, or otherwise review, or a notice of appeal,
whichever form is indicated by the applicable statute.
(b) Application or Cross-Application to Enforce an Order; Answer; Default.
(1) An application to enforce an agency order must be filed with the clerk of a court of
appeals authorized to enforce the order. If a petition is filed to review an agency order that the
court may enforce, a party opposing the petition may file a cross-application for enforcement.
(2) Within 21 days after the application for enforcement is filed, the respondent must serve
on the applicant an answer to the application and file it with the clerk. If the respondent fails to
answer in time, the court will enter judgment for the relief requested.
(3) The application must contain a concise statement of the proceedings in which the order
was entered, the facts upon which venue is based, and the relief requested.
(c) Service of the Petition or Application. The circuit clerk must serve a copy of the petition
for review, or an application or cross-application to enforce an agency order, on each respondent as
prescribed by Rule 3(d), unless a different manner of service is prescribed by statute. At the time of
filing, the petitioner must:
(1) serve, or have served, a copy on each party admitted to participate in the agency
proceedings, except for the respondents;
(2) file with the clerk a list of those so served; and
(3) give the clerk enough copies of the petition or application to serve each respondent.
(d) Intervention. Unless a statute provides another method, a person who wants to
intervene in a proceeding under this rule must file a motion for leave to intervene with the circuit
clerk and serve a copy on all parties. The motion—or other notice of intervention authorized by
statute—must be filed within 30 days after the petition for review is filed and must contain a
concise statement of the interest of the moving party and the grounds for intervention.
(e) Payment of Fees. When filing any separate or joint petition for review in a court of
appeals, the petitioner must pay the circuit clerk all required fees.

(As amended Apr. 22, 1993, eff. Dec. 1, 1993; Apr. 24, 1998, eff. Dec. 1, 1998; Mar. 26,

Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules—1967
General Note. The power of the Supreme Court to prescribe rules of practice and procedure
for the judicial review or enforcement of orders of administrative agencies, boards, commissions,
and officers is conferred by 28 U.S.C. §2072, as amended by the Act of November 6, 1966, §1, 80
Stat. 1323 (1 U.S. Code Cong. & Ad. News, p. 1546 (1966)). Section 11 of the Hobbs
Administrative Orders Review Act of 1950, 64 Stat. 1132, reenacted as 28 U.S.C. §2352 (28
U.S.C.A. §2352 (Suppl. 1966)), repealed by the Act of November 6, 1966, §4, supra, directed the
courts of appeals to adopt and promulgate, subject to approval by the Judicial Conference rules
governing practice and procedure in proceedings to review the orders of boards, commissions and
officers whose orders were made reviewable in the courts of appeals by the Act. Thereafter, the
Judicial Conference approved a uniform rule, and that rule, with minor variations, is now in effect
in all circuits. Third Circuit Rule 18 is a typical circuit rule, and for convenience it is referred to as
the uniform rule in the notes which accompany rules under this Title.
Subdivision (a). The uniform rule (see General Note above) requires that the petition for
review contain "a concise statement, in barest outline, of the nature of the proceedings as to which
relief is sought, the facts upon which venue is based, the grounds upon which relief is sought, and
the relief prayed." That language is derived from Section 4 of the Hobbs Administrative Orders
Review Act of 1950, 64 Stat. 1130, reenacted as 28 U.S.C. §2344 (28 U.S.C.A. §2344 (Suppl.
1966)). A few other statutes also prescribe the content of the petition, but the great majority are
silent on the point. The proposed rule supersedes 28 U.S.C. §2344 and other statutory provisions
prescribing the form of the petition for review and permits review to be initiated by the filing of a
simple petition similar in form to the notice of appeal used in appeals from judgments of district
courts. The more elaborate form of petition for review now required is rarely useful either to the
litigants or to the courts. There is no effective, reasonable way of obliging petitioners to come to
the real issues before those issues are formulated in the briefs. Other provisions of this subdivision
are derived from sections 1 and 2 of the uniform rule.
Subdivision (b). This subdivision is derived from sections 3, 4 and 5 of the uniform rule.
Subdivision (c). This subdivision is derived from section 1 of the uniform rule.
Subdivision (d). This subdivision is based upon section 6 of the uniform rule. Statutes
occasionally permit intervention by the filing of a notice of intention to intervene. The uniform
rule does not fix a time limit for intervention, and the only time limits fixed by statute are the 30–
day periods found in the Communications Act Amendments, 1952, §402(e), 66 Stat. 719, 47
U.S.C. §402(e), and the Sugar Act of 1948, §205(d), 61 Stat. 927, 7 U.S.C. §1115(d).
Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules—1993 Amendment
Subdivision (a). The amendment is a companion to the amendment of Rule 3(c). Both Rule
3(c) and Rule 15(a) state that a notice of appeal or petition for review must name the parties
seeking appellate review. Rule 3(c), however, provides an attorney who represents more than one
party on appeal the flexibility to describe the parties in general terms rather than naming them
individually. Rule 15(a) does not allow that flexibility; each petitioner must be named. A petition
for review of an agency decision is the first filing in any court and, therefore, is analogous to a
complaint in which all parties must be named.

Subdivision (e). The amendment adds subdivision (e). Subdivision (e) parallels Rule 3(e)
that requires the payment of fees when filing a notice of appeal. The omission of such a
requirement from Rule 15 is an apparent oversight. Five circuits have local rules requiring the
payment of such fees, see, e.g., Fifth Cir. Loc. R. 15.1, and Fed. Cir. Loc. R. 15(a)(2).
Committee Notes on Rules—1998 Amendment
The language and organization of the rule are amended to make the rule more easily
understood. In addition to changes made to improve the understanding, the Advisory Committee
has changed language to make style and terminology consistent throughout the appellate rules.
These changes are intended to be stylistic only.
Committee Notes on Rules—2009 Amendment
Subdivision (b)(2). The time set in the former rule at 20 days has been revised to 21 days.
See the Note to Rule 26.

Rule 15.1. Briefs and Oral Argument in a National Labor Relations Board
Proceeding
In either an enforcement or a review proceeding, a party adverse to the National Labor
Relations Board proceeds first on briefing and at oral argument, unless the court orders otherwise.
(As added Mar. 10, 1986, eff. July 1, 1986; amended Apr. 24, 1998, eff. Dec. 1, 1998.)
Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules—1986
This rule simply confirms the existing practice in most circuits.
Committee Notes on Rules—1998 Amendment
The language of the rule is amended to make the rule more easily understood. In addition to
changes made to improve the understanding, the Advisory Committee has changed language to
make style and terminology consistent throughout the appellate rules. These changes are intended
to be stylistic only.

Rule 16. The Record on Review or Enforcement
(a) Composition of the Record. The record on review or enforcement of an agency order
consists of:
(1) the order involved;
(2) any findings or report on which it is based; and
(3) the pleadings, evidence, and other parts of the proceedings before the agency.
(b) Omissions From or Misstatements in the Record. The parties may at any time, by
stipulation, supply any omission from the record or correct a misstatement, or the court may so
direct. If necessary, the court may direct that a supplemental record be prepared and filed.

(As amended Apr. 24, 1998, eff. Dec. 1, 1998.)
Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules—1967
Subdivision (a) is based upon 28 U.S.C. §2112(b). There is no distinction between the
record compiled in the agency proceeding and the record on review; they are one and the same.
The record in agency cases is thus the same as that in appeals from the district court—the original
papers, transcripts and exhibits in the proceeding below. Subdivision (b) is based upon section 8 of
the uniform rule (see General Note following Rule 15).
Committee Notes on Rules—1998 Amendment
The language and organization of the rule are amended to make the rule more easily
understood. In addition to changes made to improve the understanding, the Advisory Committee
has changed language to make style and terminology consistent throughout the appellate rules.
These changes are intended to be stylistic only.

Rule 17. Filing the Record
(a) Agency to File; Time for Filing; Notice of Filing. The agency must file the record with
the circuit clerk within 40 days after being served with a petition for review, unless the statute
authorizing review provides otherwise, or within 40 days after it files an application for
enforcement unless the respondent fails to answer or the court orders otherwise. The court may
shorten or extend the time to file the record. The clerk must notify all parties of the date when the
record is filed.
(b) Filing—What Constitutes.
(1) The agency must file:
(A) the original or a certified copy of the entire record or parts designated by the parties; or
(B) a certified list adequately describing all documents, transcripts of testimony, exhibits,
and other material constituting the record, or describing those parts designated by the parties.
(2) The parties may stipulate in writing that no record or certified list be filed. The date
when the stipulation is filed with the circuit clerk is treated as the date when the record is filed.
(3) The agency must retain any portion of the record not filed with the clerk. All parts of the
record retained by the agency are a part of the record on review for all purposes and, if the court or
a party so requests, must be sent to the court regardless of any prior stipulation.
(As amended Apr. 24, 1998, eff. Dec. 1, 1998.)
Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules—1967
Subdivision (a). This subdivision is based upon section 7 of the uniform rule (see General
Note following Rule 15). That rule does not prescribe a time for filing the record in enforcement
cases. Forty days are allowed in order to avoid useless preparation of the record or certified list in
cases where the application for enforcement is not contested.
Subdivision (b). This subdivision is based upon 28 U.S.C. §2112 and section 7 of the
uniform rule. It permits the agency to file either the record itself or a certified list of its contents. It

also permits the parties to stipulate against transmission of designated parts of the record without
the fear that an inadvertent stipulation may "diminish" the record. Finally, the parties may, in cases
where consultation of the record is unnecessary, stipulate that neither the record nor a certified list
of its contents be filed.
Committee Notes on Rules—1998 Amendment
The language and organization of the rule are amended to make the rule more easily
understood. In addition to changes made to improve the understanding, the Advisory Committee
has changed language to make style and terminology consistent throughout the appellate rules.
These changes are intended to be stylistic only; a substantive change is made, however, in
subdivision (b).
Subdivision (b). The current rule provides that when a court of appeals is asked to review or
enforce an agency order, the agency must file either "the entire record or such parts thereof as the
parties may designate by stipulation filed with the agency" or a certified list describing the
documents, transcripts, exhibits, and other material constituting the record. If the agency is not
filing a certified list, the current rule requires the agency to file the entire record unless the parties
file a "stipulation" designating only parts of the record. Such a "stipulation" presumably requires
agreement of the parties as to the parts to be filed. The amended language in subparagraph
(b)(1)(A) permits the agency to file the entire record or "parts designated by the parties." The new
language permits the filing of less than the entire record even when the parties do not agree as to
which parts should be filed. Each party can designate the parts that it wants filed; the agency can
then forward the parts designated by each party. In contrast, paragraph (b)(2) continues to require
stipulation, that is agreement of the parties, that the agency need not file either the record or a
certified list.

Rule 18. Stay Pending Review
(a) Motion for a Stay.
(1) Initial Motion Before the Agency. A petitioner must ordinarily move first before the
agency for a stay pending review of its decision or order.
(2) Motion in the Court of Appeals. A motion for a stay may be made to the court of appeals
or one of its judges.
(A) The motion must:
(i) show that moving first before the agency would be impracticable; or
(ii) state that, a motion having been made, the agency denied the motion or failed to afford
the relief requested and state any reasons given by the agency for its action.
(B) The motion must also include:
(i) the reasons for granting the relief requested and the facts relied on;
(ii) originals or copies of affidavits or other sworn statements supporting facts subject to
dispute; and
(iii) relevant parts of the record.
(C) The moving party must give reasonable notice of the motion to all parties.
(D) The motion must be filed with the circuit clerk and normally will be considered by a

panel of the court. But in an exceptional case in which time requirements make that procedure
impracticable, the motion may be made to and considered by a single judge.
(b) Bond. The court may condition relief on the filing of a bond or other appropriate
security.
(As amended Apr. 24, 1998, eff. Dec. 1, 1998.)
Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules—1967
While this rule has no counterpart in present rules regulating review of agency
proceedings, it merely assimilates the procedure for obtaining stays in agency proceedings with
that for obtaining stays in appeals from the district courts. The same considerations which justify
the requirement of an initial application to the district court for a stay pending appeal support the
requirement of an initial application to the agency pending review. See Note accompanying Rule
8. Title 5, U.S.C. §705 (5 U.S.C.A. §705 (1966 Pamphlet)) confers general authority on both
agencies and reviewing courts to stay agency action pending review. Many of the statutes
authorizing review of agency action by the courts of appeals deal with the question of stays, and at
least one, the Act of June 15, 1936, 49 Stat. 1499 (7 U.S.C. §10a), prohibits a stay pending review.
The proposed rule in nowise affects such statutory provisions respecting stays. By its terms, it
simply indicates the procedure to be followed when a stay is sought.
Committee Notes on Rules—1998 Amendment
The language and organization of the rule are amended to make the rule more easily
understood. In addition to changes made to improve the understanding, the Advisory Committee
has changed language to make style and terminology consistent throughout the appellate rules.
These changes are intended to be stylistic only.

Rule 19. Settlement of a Judgment Enforcing an Agency Order in Part
When the court files an opinion directing entry of judgment enforcing the agency's order in
part, the agency must within 14 days file with the clerk and serve on each other party a proposed
judgment conforming to the opinion. A party who disagrees with the agency's proposed judgment
must within 10 days file with the clerk and serve the agency with a proposed judgment that the
party believes conforms to the opinion. The court will settle the judgment and direct entry without
further hearing or argument.
(As amended Mar. 10, 1986, eff. July 1, 1986; Apr. 24, 1998, eff. Dec. 1, 1998; Mar. 26,
2009, eff. Dec. 1, 2009.)
Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules—1967
This is section 12 of the uniform rule (see General Note following Rule 15) with changes in
phraseology.
Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules—1986 Amendment

The deletion of the words "in whole or" is designed to eliminate delay in the issuance of a
judgment when the court of appeals has either enforced completely the order of an agency or
denied completely such enforcement. In such a clear-cut situation, it serves no useful purpose to
delay the issuance of the judgment until a proposed judgment is submitted by the agency and
reviewed by the respondent. This change conforms the Rule to the existing practice in most
circuits. Other amendments are technical and no substantive change is intended.
Committee Notes on Rules—1998 Amendment
The language of the rule is amended to make the rule more easily understood. In addition to
changes made to improve the understanding, the Advisory Committee has changed language to
make style and terminology consistent throughout the appellate rules. These changes are intended
to be stylistic only.
Committee Notes on Rules—2009 Amendment
Rule 19 formerly required a party who disagreed with the agency's proposed judgment to
file a proposed judgment "within 7 days." Under former Rule 26(a), "7 days" always meant at least
9 days and could mean as many as 11 or even 13 days. Under current Rule 26(a), intermediate
weekends and holidays are counted. Changing the period from 7 to 10 days offsets the change in
computation approach. See the Note to Rule 26.

Rule 20. Applicability of Rules to the Review or Enforcement of an Agency
Order
All provisions of these rules, except Rules 3–14 and 22–23, apply to the review or
enforcement of an agency order. In these rules, "appellant" includes a petitioner or applicant, and
"appellee" includes a respondent.
(As amended Apr. 24, 1998, eff. Dec. 1, 1998.)
Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules—1967
The proposed rule continues the present uniform practice of the circuits of regulating
agency review or enforcement proceedings by the general rules applicable to appeals from
judgments of the district courts.
Committee Notes on Rules—1998 Amendment
The language of the rule is amended to make the rule more easily understood. In addition to
changes made to improve the understanding, the Advisory Committee has changed language to
make style and terminology consistent throughout the appellate rules. These changes are intended
to be stylistic only.

TITLE V. EXTRAORDINARY WRITS
Rule 21. Writs of Mandamus and Prohibition, and Other Extraordinary
Writs
(a) Mandamus or Prohibition to a Court: Petition, Filing, Service, and Docketing.
(1) A party petitioning for a writ of mandamus or prohibition directed to a court must file a
petition with the circuit clerk with proof of service on all parties to the proceeding in the trial court.
The party must also provide a copy to the trial-court judge. All parties to the proceeding in the trial
court other than the petitioner are respondents for all purposes.
(2)(A) The petition must be titled "In re [name of petitioner]."
(B) The petition must state:
(i) the relief sought;
(ii) the issues presented;
(iii) the facts necessary to understand the issue presented by the petition; and
(iv) the reasons why the writ should issue.
(C) The petition must include a copy of any order or opinion or parts of the record that may
be essential to understand the matters set forth in the petition.
(3) Upon receiving the prescribed docket fee, the clerk must docket the petition and submit
it to the court.
(b) Denial; Order Directing Answer; Briefs; Precedence.
(1) The court may deny the petition without an answer. Otherwise, it must order the
respondent, if any, to answer within a fixed time.
(2) The clerk must serve the order to respond on all persons directed to respond.
(3) Two or more respondents may answer jointly.
(4) The court of appeals may invite or order the trial-court judge to address the petition or
may invite an amicus curiae to do so. The trial-court judge may request permission to address the
petition but may not do so unless invited or ordered to do so by the court of appeals.
(5) If briefing or oral argument is required, the clerk must advise the parties, and when
appropriate, the trial-court judge or amicus curiae.
(6) The proceeding must be given preference over ordinary civil cases.
(7) The circuit clerk must send a copy of the final disposition to the trial-court judge.
(c) Other Extraordinary Writs. An application for an extraordinary writ other than one
provided for in Rule 21(a) must be made by filing a petition with the circuit clerk with proof of
service on the respondents. Proceedings on the application must conform, so far as is practicable,
to the procedures prescribed in Rule 21(a) and (b).
(d) Form of Papers; Number of Copies. All papers must conform to Rule 32(c)(2). Except
by the court's permission, a paper must not exceed 30 pages, exclusive of the disclosure statement,
the proof of service, and the accompanying documents required by Rule 21(a)(2)(C). An original
and 3 copies must be filed unless the court requires the filing of a different number by local rule or

by order in a particular case.
(As amended Apr. 29, 1994, eff. Dec. 1, 1994; Apr. 23, 1996, eff. Dec. 1, 1996; Apr. 24,
1998, eff. Dec. 1, 1998; Apr. 29, 2002, eff. Dec. 1, 2002.)
Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules—1967
The authority of courts of appeals to issue extraordinary writs is derived from 28 U.S.C.
§1651. Subdivisions (a) and (b) regulate in detail the procedure surrounding the writs most
commonly sought—mandamus or prohibition directed to a judge or judges. Those subdivisions are
based upon Supreme Court Rule 31, with certain changes which reflect the uniform practice
among the circuits (Seventh Circuit Rule 19 is a typical circuit rule). Subdivision (c) sets out a very
general procedure to be followed in applications for the variety of other writs which may be issued
under the authority of 28 U.S.C. §1651.
Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules—1994 Amendment
Subdivision (d). The amendment makes it clear that a court may require a different number
of copies either by rule or by order in an individual case. The number of copies of any document
that a court of appeals needs varies depending upon the way in which the court conducts business.
The internal operation of the courts of appeals necessarily varies from circuit to circuit because of
differences in the number of judges, the geographic area included within the circuit, and other such
factors. Uniformity could be achieved only by setting the number of copies artificially high so that
parties in all circuits file enough copies to satisfy the needs of the court requiring the greatest
number. Rather than do that, the Committee decided to make it clear that local rules may require a
greater or lesser number of copies and that, if the circumstances of a particular case indicate the
need for a different number of copies in that case, the court may so order.
Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules—1996 Amendment
In most instances, a writ of mandamus or prohibition is not actually directed to a judge in
any more personal way than is an order reversing a court's judgment. Most often a petition for a
writ of mandamus seeks review of the intrinsic merits of a judge's action and is in reality an
adversary proceeding between the parties. See, e.g., Walker v. Columbia Broadcasting System,
Inc., 443 F.2d 33 (7th Cir. 1971). In order to change the tone of the rule and of mandamus
proceedings generally, the rule is amended so that the judge is not treated as a respondent. The
caption and subdivision (a) are amended by deleting the reference to the writs as being "directed to
a judge or judges."
Subdivision (a). Subdivision (a) applies to writs of mandamus or prohibition directed to a
court, but it is amended so that a petition for a writ of mandamus or prohibition does not bear the
name of the judge. The amendments to subdivision (a) speak, however, about mandamus or
prohibition "directed to a court." This language is inserted to distinguish subdivision (a) from
subdivision (c). Subdivision (c) governs all other extraordinary writs, including a writ of
mandamus or prohibition directed to an administrative agency rather than to a court and a writ of
habeas corpus.
The amendments require the petitioner to provide a copy of the petition to the trial court
judge. This will alert the judge to the filing of the petition. This is necessary because the trial court
judge is not treated as a respondent and, as a result, is not served. A companion amendment is

made in subdivision (b). It requires the circuit clerk to send a copy of the disposition of the petition
to the trial court judge.
Subdivision (b). The amendment provides that even if relief is requested of a particular
judge, although the judge may request permission to respond, the judge may not do so unless the
court invites or orders a response.
The court of appeals ordinarily will be adequately informed not only by the opinions or
statements made by the trial court judge contemporaneously with the entry of the challenged order
but also by the arguments made on behalf of the party opposing the relief. The latter does not
create an attorney-client relationship between the party's attorney and the judge whose action is
challenged, nor does it give rise to any right to compensation from the judge.
If the court of appeals desires to hear from the trial court judge, however, the court may
invite or order the judge to respond. In some instances, especially those involving court
administration or the failure of a judge to act, it may be that no one other than the judge can provide
a thorough explanation of the matters at issue. Because it is ordinarily undesirable to place the trial
court judge, even temporarily, in an adversarial posture with a litigant, the rule permits a court of
appeals to invite an amicus curiae to provide a response to the petition. In those instances in which
the respondent does not oppose issuance of the writ or does not have sufficient perspective on the
issue to provide an adequate response, participation of an amicus may avoid the need for the trial
judge to participate.
Subdivision (c). The changes are stylistic only. No substantive changes are intended.
Committee Notes on Rules—1998 Amendment
The language and organization of the rule are amended to make the rule more easily
understood. In addition to changes made to improve the understanding, the Advisory Committee
has changed language to make style and terminology consistent throughout the appellate rules.
These changes are intended to be stylistic only.
Committee Notes on Rules—2002 Amendment
Subdivision (d). A petition for a writ of mandamus or prohibition, an application for
another extraordinary writ, and an answer to such a petition or application are all "other papers" for
purposes of Rule 32(c)(2), and all of the requirements of Rule 32(a) apply to those papers, except
as provided in Rule 32(c)(2). During the 1998 restyling of the Federal Rules of Appellate
Procedure, Rule 21(d) was inadvertently changed to suggest that only the requirements of Rule
32(a)(1) apply to such papers. Rule 21(d) has been amended to correct that error.
Rule 21(d) has been further amended to limit the length of papers filed under Rule 21.
Changes Made After Publication and Comments. No changes were made to the text of the
proposed amendment or to the Committee Note, except that the page limit was increased from 20
pages to 30 pages. The Committee was persuaded by some commentators that petitions for
extraordinary writs closely resemble principal briefs on the merits and should be allotted more
than 20 pages.

TITLE VI. HABEAS CORPUS; PROCEEDINGS IN FORMA PAUPERIS
Rule 22. Habeas Corpus and Section 2255 Proceedings

(a) Application for the Original Writ. An application for a writ of habeas corpus must be
made to the appropriate district court. If made to a circuit judge, the application must be transferred
to the appropriate district court. If a district court denies an application made or transferred to it,
renewal of the application before a circuit judge is not permitted. The applicant may, under 28
U.S.C. §2253, appeal to the court of appeals from the district court's order denying the application.
(b) Certificate of Appealability.
(1) In a habeas corpus proceeding in which the detention complained of arises from process
issued by a state court, or in a 28 U.S.C. §2255 proceeding, the applicant cannot take an appeal
unless a circuit justice or a circuit or district judge issues a certificate of appealability under 28
U.S.C. §2253(c). If an applicant files a notice of appeal, the district clerk must send to the court of
appeals the certificate (if any) and the statement described in Rule 11(a) of the Rules Governing
Proceedings Under 28 U.S.C. §2254 or §2255 (if any), along with the notice of appeal and the file
of the district-court proceedings. If the district judge has denied the certificate, the applicant may
request a circuit judge to issue it.
(2) A request addressed to the court of appeals may be considered by a circuit judge or
judges, as the court prescribes. If no express request for a certificate is filed, the notice of appeal
constitutes a request addressed to the judges of the court of appeals.
(3) A certificate of appealability is not required when a state or its representative or the
United States or its representative appeals.
(As amended Pub. L. 104–132, title I, §103, Apr. 24, 1996, 110 Stat. 1218; Apr. 24, 1998,
eff. Dec. 1, 1998; Mar. 26, 2009, eff. Dec. 1, 2009.)
Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules—1967
Subdivision (a). Title 28 U.S.C. §2241(a) authorizes circuit judges to issue the writ of
habeas corpus. Section 2241(b), however, authorizes a circuit judge to decline to entertain an
application and to transfer it to the appropriate district court, and this is the usual practice. The first
two sentences merely make present practice explicit. Title 28 U.S.C. §2253 seems clearly to
contemplate that once an application is presented to a district judge and is denied by him, the
remedy is an appeal from the order of denial. But the language of 28 U.S.C. §2241 seems to
authorize a second original application to a circuit judge following a denial by a district judge. In
re Gersing, 79 U.S.App.D.C. 245, 145 F.2d 481 (D.C. Cir., 1944) and Chapman v. Teets, 241 F.2d
186 (9th Cir., 1957) acknowledge the availability of such a procedure. But the procedure is
ordinarily a waste of time for all involved, and the final sentence attempts to discourage it.
A court of appeals has no jurisdiction as a court to grant an original writ of habeas corpus,
and courts of appeals have dismissed applications addressed to them. Loum v. Alvis, 263 F.2d 836
(6th Cir., 1959); In re Berry, 221 F.2d 798 (9th Cir., 1955); Posey v. Dowd, 134 F.2d 613 (7th Cir.,
1943). The fairer and more expeditious practice is for the court of appeals to regard an application
addressed to it as being addressed to one of its members, and to transfer the application to the
appropriate district court in accordance with the provisions of this rule. Perhaps such a disposition
is required by the rationale of In re Burwell, 350 U.S. 521, 76 S.Ct. 539, 100 L.Ed. 666 (1956).
Subdivision (b). Title 28 U.S.C. §2253 provides that an appeal may not be taken in a habeas
corpus proceeding where confinement is under a judgment of a state court unless the judge who
rendered the order in the habeas corpus proceeding, or a circuit justice or judge, issues a certificate

of probable cause. In the interest of insuring that the matter of the certificate will not be overlooked
and that, if the certificate is denied, the reasons for denial in the first instance will be available on
any subsequent application, the proposed rule requires the district judge to issue the certificate or
to state reasons for its denial.
While 28 U.S.C. §2253 does not authorize the court of appeals as a court to grant a
certificate of probable cause, In re Burwell, 350 U.S. 521, 76 S.Ct. 539, 100 L.Ed. 666 (1956)
makes it clear that a court of appeals may not decline to consider a request for the certificate
addressed to it as a court but must regard the request as made to the judges thereof. The fourth
sentence incorporates the Burwell rule.
Although 28 U.S.C. §2253 appears to require a certificate of probable cause even when an
appeal is taken by a state or its representative, the legislative history strongly suggests that the
intention of Congress was to require a certificate only in the case in which an appeal is taken by an
applicant for the writ. See United States ex rel. Tillery v. Cavell, 294 F.2d 12 (3d Cir., 1960). Four
of the five circuits which have ruled on the point have so interpreted section 2253. United States ex
rel. Tillery v. Cavell, supra; Buder v. Bell, 306 F.2d 71 (6th Cir., 1962); United States ex rel.
Calhoun v. Pate, 341 F.2d 885 (7th Cir., 1965); State of Texas v. Graves, 352 F.2d 514 (5th Cir.,
1965). Cf. United States ex rel. Carrol v. LaVallee, 342 F.2d 641 (2d Cir., 1965). The final
sentence makes it clear that a certificate of probable cause is not required of a state or its
representative.
Committee Notes on Rules—1998 Amendment
The language and organization of the rule are amended to make the rule more easily
understood. In addition to changes made to improve the understanding, the Advisory Committee
has changed language to make style and terminology consistent throughout the appellate rules.
These changes are intended to be stylistic only; in this rule, however, substantive changes are made
in paragraphs (b)(1) and (b)(3).
Subdivision (b), paragraph (1). Two substantive changes are made in this paragraph. First,
the paragraph is made applicable to 28 U.S.C. §2255 proceedings. This brings the rule into
conformity with 28 U.S.C. §2253 as amended by the Anti-Terrorism and Effective Death Penalty
Act of 1996, Pub. L. No. 104–132. Second, the rule states that a certificate of appealability may be
issued by "a circuit justice or a circuit or district judge." That language adds a reference to the
circuit justice which also brings the rule into conformity with section 2253. The language
continues to state that in addition to the circuit justice, both a circuit and a district judge may issue
a certificate of appealability. The language of section 2253 is ambiguous; it states that a certificate
of appealability may be issued by "a circuit justice or judge." Since the enactment of the
Anti-Terrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act, three circuits have held that both district and
circuit judges, as well as the circuit justice, may issue a certificate of appealability. Else v.
Johnson, 104 F.3d 82 (5th Cir. 1997); Lyons v. Ohio Adult Parole Authority, 105 F.3d 1063 (6th
Cir. 1997); and Hunter v. United States, 101 F.3d 1565 (11th Cir. 1996). The approach taken by
the rule is consistent with those decisions.
Subdivision (b), paragraph (3). The Anti-Terrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of
1996, Pub. L. No. 104–132, amended 28 U.S.C. §2253 to make it applicable to §2255 proceedings.
Accordingly, paragraph (3) is amended to provide that when the United States or its representative
appeals, a certificate of appealability is not required.
Committee Notes on Rules—2009 Amendment

Subdivision (b)(1). The requirement that the district judge who rendered the judgment
either issue a certificate of appealability or state why a certificate should not issue has been deleted
from subdivision (b)(1). Rule 11(a) of the Rules Governing Proceedings under 28 U.S.C. §2254 or
§2255 now delineates the relevant requirement. When an applicant has filed a notice of appeal, the
district clerk must transmit the record to the court of appeals; if the district judge has issued a
certificate of appealability, the district clerk must include in this transmission the certificate and
the statement of reasons for grant of the certificate.
Changes Made After Publication and Comment. The Appellate Rules Committee approved
the proposed amendment to Appellate Rule 22(b) with the style changes (described below)
[omitted] which were suggested by Professor Kimble. As detailed in the report of the Criminal
Rules Committee, a number of changes were made to the proposals concerning Rule 11 of the
habeas and Section 2255 rules in response to public comment.
At the Standing Committee's direction, the language proposed for Appellate Rule 22(b)
was circulated to the circuit clerks for their comment. Pursuant to comments received from the
circuit clerks, the second sentence of Rule 22(b) was revised to make clear that the Rule requires
the transmission of the record by the district court when an appeal is filed, regardless of whether
the certificate of appealability was granted or denied by the district judge; a conforming change
was made to the last sentence of the Committee Note.
Amendment by Public Law
1996—Pub. L. 104–132 inserted "and section 2255" after "corpus" in catchline and
amended text generally. Prior to amendment, text read as follows:
"(a) Application for the original writ.—An application for a writ of habeas corpus shall be
made to the appropriate district court. If application is made to a circuit judge, the application will
ordinarily be transferred to the appropriate district court. If an application is made to or transferred
to the district court and denied, renewal of the application before a circuit judge is not favored; the
proper remedy is by appeal to the court of appeals from the order of the district court denying the
writ.
"(b) Necessity of certificate of probable cause for appeal.—In a habeas corpus proceeding
in which the detention complained of arises out of process issued by a state court, an appeal by the
applicant for the writ may not proceed unless a district or a circuit judge issues a certificate of
probable cause. If an appeal is taken by the applicant, the district judge who rendered the judgment
shall either issue a certificate of probable cause or state the reasons why such a certificate should
not issue. The certificate or the statement shall be forwarded to the court of appeals with the notice
of appeal and the file of the proceedings in the district court. If the district judge has denied the
certificate, the applicant for the writ may then request issuance of the certificate by a circuit judge.
If such a request is addressed to the court of appeals, it shall be deemed addressed to the judges
thereof and shall be considered by a circuit judge or judges as the court deems appropriate. If no
express request for a certificate is filed, the notice of appeal shall be deemed to constitute a request
addressed to the judges of the court of appeals. If an appeal is taken by a state or its representative,
a certificate of probable cause is not required."

Rule 23. Custody or Release of a Prisoner in a Habeas Corpus Proceeding

(a) Transfer of Custody Pending Review. Pending review of a decision in a habeas corpus
proceeding commenced before a court, justice, or judge of the United States for the release of a
prisoner, the person having custody of the prisoner must not transfer custody to another unless a
transfer is directed in accordance with this rule. When, upon application, a custodian shows the
need for a transfer, the court, justice, or judge rendering the decision under review may authorize
the transfer and substitute the successor custodian as a party.
(b) Detention or Release Pending Review of Decision Not to Release. While a decision not
to release a prisoner is under review, the court or judge rendering the decision, or the court of
appeals, or the Supreme Court, or a judge or justice of either court, may order that the prisoner be:
(1) detained in the custody from which release is sought;
(2) detained in other appropriate custody; or
(3) released on personal recognizance, with or without surety.
(c) Release Pending Review of Decision Ordering Release. While a decision ordering the
release of a prisoner is under review, the prisoner must—unless the court or judge rendering the
decision, or the court of appeals, or the Supreme Court, or a judge or justice of either court orders
otherwise—be released on personal recognizance, with or without surety.
(d) Modification of the Initial Order on Custody. An initial order governing the prisoner's
custody or release, including any recognizance or surety, continues in effect pending review unless
for special reasons shown to the court of appeals or the Supreme Court, or to a judge or justice of
either court, the order is modified or an independent order regarding custody, release, or surety is
issued.
(As amended Mar. 10, 1986, eff. July 1, 1986; Apr. 24, 1998, eff. Dec. 1, 1998.)
Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules—1967
The rule is the same as Supreme Court Rule 49, as amended on June 12, 1967, effective
October 2, 1967.
Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules—1986 Amendment
The amendments to Rules 23(b) and (c) are technical. No substantive change is intended.
Committee Notes on Rules—1998 Amendment
The language and organization of the rule are amended to make the rule more easily
understood. In addition to changes made to improve the understanding, the Advisory Committee
has changed language to make style and terminology consistent throughout the appellate rules.
These changes are intended to be stylistic only.
Subdivison (d). The current rule states that the initial order governing custody or release
"shall govern review" in the court of appeals. The amended language says that the initial order
generally "continues in effect" pending review.
When Rule 23 was adopted it used the same language as Supreme Court Rule 49, which
then governed custody of prisoners in habeas corpus proceedings. The "shall govern review"
language was drawn from the Supreme Court Rule. The Supreme Court has since amended its rule,
now Rule 36, to say that the initial order "shall continue in effect" unless for reasons shown it is
modified or a new order is entered. Rule 23 is amended to similarly state that the initial order

"continues in effect." The new language is clearer. It removes the possible implication that the
initial order created law of the case, a strange notion to attach to an order regarding custody or
release.

Rule 24. Proceeding in Forma Pauperis
(a) Leave to Proceed in Forma Pauperis.
(1) Motion in the District Court. Except as stated in Rule 24(a)(3), a party to a district-court
action who desires to appeal in forma pauperis must file a motion in the district court. The party
must attach an affidavit that:
(A) shows in the detail prescribed by Form 4 of the Appendix of Forms the party's inability
to pay or to give security for fees and costs;
(B) claims an entitlement to redress; and
(C) states the issues that the party intends to present on appeal.
(2) Action on the Motion. If the district court grants the motion, the party may proceed on
appeal without prepaying or giving security for fees and costs, unless a statute provides otherwise.
If the district court denies the motion, it must state its reasons in writing.
(3) Prior Approval. A party who was permitted to proceed in forma pauperis in the
district-court action, or who was determined to be financially unable to obtain an adequate defense
in a criminal case, may proceed on appeal in forma pauperis without further authorization, unless:
(A) the district court—before or after the notice of appeal is filed—certifies that the appeal
is not taken in good faith or finds that the party is not otherwise entitled to proceed in forma
pauperis and states in writing its reasons for the certification or finding; or
(B) a statute provides otherwise.
(4) Notice of District Court's Denial. The district clerk must immediately notify the parties
and the court of appeals when the district court does any of the following:
(A) denies a motion to proceed on appeal in forma pauperis;
(B) certifies that the appeal is not taken in good faith; or
(C) finds that the party is not otherwise entitled to proceed in forma pauperis.
(5) Motion in the Court of Appeals. A party may file a motion to proceed on appeal in
forma pauperis in the court of appeals within 30 days after service of the notice prescribed in Rule
24(a)(4). The motion must include a copy of the affidavit filed in the district court and the district
court's statement of reasons for its action. If no affidavit was filed in the district court, the party
must include the affidavit prescribed by Rule 24(a)(1).
(b) Leave to Proceed in Forma Pauperis on Appeal from the United States Tax Court or on
Appeal or Review of an Administrative-Agency Proceeding. A party may file in the court of
appeals a motion for leave to proceed on appeal in forma pauperis with an affidavit prescribed by
Rule 24(a)(1):
(1) in an appeal from the United States Tax Court; and
(2) when an appeal or review of a proceeding before an administrative agency, board,
commission, or officer proceeds directly in the court of appeals.

(c) Leave to Use Original Record. A party allowed to proceed on appeal in forma pauperis
may request that the appeal be heard on the original record without reproducing any part.
(As amended Apr. 1, 1979, eff. Aug. 1, 1979; Mar. 10, 1986, eff. July 1, 1986; Apr. 24,
1998, eff. Dec. 1, 1998; Apr. 29, 2002, eff. Dec. 1, 2002; Apr. 16, 2013, eff. Dec. 1, 2013.)
Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules—1967
Subdivision (a). Authority to allow prosecution of an appeal in forma pauperis is vested in
"[a]ny court of the United States" by 28 U.S.C. §1915(a). The second paragraph of section 1915(a)
seems to contemplate initial application to the district court for permission to proceed in forma
pauperis, and although the circuit rules are generally silent on the question, the case law requires
initial application to the district court. Hayes v. United States, 258 F.2d 400 (5th Cir., 1958), cert.
den. 358 U.S. 856, 79 S.Ct. 87, 3 L.Ed.2d 89 (1958); Elkins v. United States, 250 F.2d 145 (9th
Cir., 1957) see 364 U.S. 206, 80 S.Ct. 1437, 4 L.Ed.2d 1669 (1960); United States v. Farley, 238
F.2d 575 (2d Cir., 1956) see 354 U.S. 521, 77 S.Ct. 1371, 1 L.Ed.2d 1529 (1957). D.C. Cir. Rule
41(a) requires initial application to the district court. The content of the affidavit follows the
language of the statute; the requirement of a statement of the issues comprehends the statutory
requirement of a statement of "the nature of the . . . appeal. . . ." The second sentence is in accord
with the decision in McGann v. United States, 362 U.S. 309, 80 S.Ct. 725, 4 L.Ed.2d 734 (1960).
The requirement contained in the third sentence has no counterpart in present circuit rules, but it
has been imposed by decision in at least two circuits. Ragan v. Cox, 305 F.2d 58 (10th Cir., 1962);
United States ex rel. Breedlove v. Dowd, 269 F.2d 693 (7th Cir., 1959).
The second paragraph permits one whose indigency has been previously determined by the
district court to proceed on appeal in forma pauperis without the necessity of a redetermination of
indigency, while reserving to the district court its statutory authority to certify that the appeal is not
taken in good faith, 28 U.S.C. §1915(a), and permitting an inquiry into whether the circumstances
of the party who was originally entitled to proceed in forma pauperis have changed during the
course of the litigation. Cf. Sixth Circuit Rule 26.
The final paragraph establishes a subsequent motion in the court of appeals, rather than an
appeal from the order of denial or from the certification of lack of good faith, as the proper
procedure for calling in question the correctness of the action of the district court. The simple and
expeditious motion procedure seems clearly preferable to an appeal. This paragraph applies only
to applications for leave to appeal in forma pauperis. The order of a district court refusing leave to
initiate an action in the district court in forma pauperis is reviewable on appeal. See Roberts v.
United States District Court, 339 U.S. 844, 70 S.Ct. 954, 94 L.Ed. 1326 (1950).
Subdivision (b). Authority to allow prosecution in forma pauperis is vested only in a "court
of the United States" (see Note to subdivision (a), above). Thus in proceedings brought directly in
a court of appeals to review decisions of agencies or of the Tax Court, authority to proceed in
forma pauperis should be sought in the court of appeals. If initial review of agency action is had in
a district court, an application to appeal to a court of appeals in forma pauperis from the judgment
of the district court is governed by the provisions of subdivision (a).
Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules—1979 Amendment
The proposed amendment reflects the change in the title of the Tax Court to "United States
Tax Court." See 26 U.S.C. §7441.
Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules—1986 Amendment

The amendments to Rule 24(a) are technical. No substantive change is intended.
Committee Notes on Rules—1998 Amendment
The language and organization of the rule are amended to make the rule more easily
understood. In addition to changes made to improve the understanding, the Advisory Committee
has changed language to make style and terminology consistent throughout the appellate rules.
These changes are intended to be stylistic only. The Advisory Committee deletes the language in
subdivision (c) authorizing a party proceeding in forma pauperis to file papers in typewritten form
because the authorization is unnecessary. The rules permit all parties to file typewritten
documents.
Committee Notes on Rules—2002 Amendment
Subdivision (a)(2). Section 804 of the Prison Litigation Reform Act of 1995 ("PLRA")
amended 28 U.S.C. §1915 to require that prisoners who bring civil actions or appeals from civil
actions must "pay the full amount of a filing fee." 28 U.S.C. §1915(b)(1). Prisoners who are unable
to pay the full amount of the filing fee at the time that their actions or appeals are filed are generally
required to pay part of the fee and then to pay the remainder of the fee in installments. 28 U.S.C.
§1915(b). By contrast, Rule 24(a)(2) has provided that, after the district court grants a litigant's
motion to proceed on appeal in forma pauperis, the litigant may proceed "without prepaying or
giving security for fees and costs." Thus, the PLRA and Rule 24(a)(2) appear to be in conflict.
Rule 24(a)(2) has been amended to resolve this conflict. Recognizing that future legislation
regarding prisoner litigation is likely, the Committee has not attempted to incorporate into Rule 24
all of the requirements of the current version of 28 U.S.C. §1915. Rather, the Committee has
amended Rule 24(a)(2) to clarify that the rule is not meant to conflict with anything required by the
PLRA or any other statute.
Subdivision (a)(3). Rule 24(a)(3) has also been amended to eliminate an apparent conflict
with the PLRA. Rule 24(a)(3) has provided that a party who was permitted to proceed in forma
pauperis in the district court may continue to proceed in forma pauperis in the court of appeals
without further authorization, subject to certain conditions. The PLRA, by contrast, provides that a
prisoner who was permitted to proceed in forma pauperis in the district court and who wishes to
continue to proceed in forma pauperis on appeal may not do so "automatically," but must seek
permission. See, e.g., Morgan v. Haro, 112 F.3d 788, 789 (5th Cir. 1997) ("A prisoner who seeks
to proceed IFP on appeal must obtain leave to so proceed despite proceeding IFP in the district
court.").
Rule 24(a)(3) has been amended to resolve this conflict. Again, recognizing that future
legislation regarding prisoner litigation is likely, the Committee has not attempted to incorporate
into Rule 24 all of the requirements of the current version of 28 U.S.C. §1915. Rather, the
Committee has amended Rule 24(a)(3) to clarify that the rule is not meant to conflict with anything
required by the PLRA or any other statute.
Changes Made After Publication and Comments. No changes were made to the text of the
proposed amendment or to the Committee Note, except that "a statute provides otherwise" was
substituted in place of "the law requires otherwise" in the text of the rule and conforming changes
(as well as a couple of minor stylistic changes) were made to the Committee Note.

Committee Notes on Rules—2013 Amendment

Rule 24(b) currently refers to review of proceedings "before an administrative agency,
board, commission, or officer (including for the purpose of this rule the United States Tax Court)."
Experience suggests that Rule 24(b) contributes to confusion by fostering the impression that the
Tax Court is an executive branch agency rather than a court. (As a general example of that
confusion, appellate courts have returned Tax Court records to the Internal Revenue Service,
believing the Tax Court to be part of that agency.) To remove this possible source of confusion, the
quoted parenthetical is deleted from subdivision (b) and appeals from the Tax Court are separately
listed in subdivision (b)'s heading and in new subdivision (b)(1).
Changes Made After Publication and Comment. No changes were made after publication
and comment.

TITLE VII. GENERAL PROVISIONS
Rule 25. Filing and Service
(a) Filing.
(1) Filing with the Clerk. A paper required or permitted to be filed in a court of appeals
must be filed with the clerk.
(2) Filing: Method and Timeliness.
(A) In General. Filing may be accomplished by mail addressed to the clerk, but filing is not
timely unless the clerk receives the papers within the time fixed for filing.
(B) A brief or appendix. A brief or appendix is timely filed, however, if on or before the last
day for filing, it is:
(i) mailed to the clerk by First-Class Mail, or other class of mail that is at least as
expeditious, postage prepaid; or
(ii) dispatched to a third-party commercial carrier for delivery to the clerk within 3 days.
(C) Inmate Filing. A paper filed by an inmate confined in an institution is timely if
deposited in the institution's internal mailing system on or before the last day for filing. If an
institution has a system designed for legal mail, the inmate must use that system to receive the
benefit of this rule. Timely filing may be shown by a declaration in compliance with 28 U.S.C.
§1746 or by a notarized statement, either of which must set forth the date of deposit and state that
first-class postage has been prepaid.
(D) Electronic Filing. A court of appeals may by local rule permit or require papers to be
filed, signed, or verified by electronic means that are consistent with technical standards, if any,
that the Judicial Conference of the United States establishes. A local rule may require filing by
electronic means only if reasonable exceptions are allowed. A paper filed by electronic means in
compliance with a local rule constitutes a written paper for the purpose of applying these rules.
(3) Filing a Motion with a Judge. If a motion requests relief that may be granted by a single
judge, the judge may permit the motion to be filed with the judge; the judge must note the filing
date on the motion and give it to the clerk.
(4) Clerk's Refusal of Documents. The clerk must not refuse to accept for filing any paper
presented for that purpose solely because it is not presented in proper form as required by these
rules or by any local rule or practice.
(5) Privacy Protection. An appeal in a case whose privacy protection was governed by
Federal Rule of Bankruptcy Procedure 9037, Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 5.2, or Federal Rule
of Criminal Procedure 49.1 is governed by the same rule on appeal. In all other proceedings,
privacy protection is governed by Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 5.2, except that Federal Rule of
Criminal Procedure 49.1 governs when an extraordinary writ is sought in a criminal case.
(b) Service of All Papers Required. Unless a rule requires service by the clerk, a party
must, at or before the time of filing a paper, serve a copy on the other parties to the appeal or
review. Service on a party represented by counsel must be made on the party's counsel.

(c) Manner of Service.
(1) Service may be any of the following:
(A) personal, including delivery to a responsible person at the office of counsel;
(B) by mail;
(C) by third-party commercial carrier for delivery within 3 days; or
(D) by electronic means, if the party being served consents in writing.
(2) If authorized by local rule, a party may use the court's transmission equipment to make
electronic service under Rule 25(c)(1)(D).
(3) When reasonable considering such factors as the immediacy of the relief sought,
distance, and cost, service on a party must be by a manner at least as expeditious as the manner
used to file the paper with the court.
(4) Service by mail or by commercial carrier is complete on mailing or delivery to the
carrier. Service by electronic means is complete on transmission, unless the party making service
is notified that the paper was not received by the party served.
(d) Proof of Service.
(1) A paper presented for filing must contain either of the following:
(A) an acknowledgment of service by the person served; or
(B) proof of service consisting of a statement by the person who made service certifying:
(i) the date and manner of service;
(ii) the names of the persons served; and
(iii) their mail or electronic addresses, facsimile numbers, or the addresses of the places of
delivery, as appropriate for the manner of service.
(2) When a brief or appendix is filed by mailing or dispatch in accordance with Rule
25(a)(2)(B), the proof of service must also state the date and manner by which the document was
mailed or dispatched to the clerk.
(3) Proof of service may appear on or be affixed to the papers filed.
(e) Number of Copies. When these rules require the filing or furnishing of a number of
copies, a court may require a different number by local rule or by order in a particular case.
(As amended Mar. 10, 1986, eff. July 1, 1986; Apr. 30, 1991, eff. Dec. 1, 1991; Apr. 22,
1993, eff. Dec. 1, 1993; Apr. 29, 1994, eff. Dec. 1, 1994; Apr. 23, 1996, eff. Dec. 1, 1996; Apr. 24,

2007, eff. Dec. 1, 2007; Mar. 26, 2009, eff. Dec. 1, 2009.)
Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules—1967
The rule that filing is not timely unless the papers filed are received within the time allowed
is the familiar one. Ward v. Atlantic Coast Line R.R. Co., 265 F.2d 75 (5th Cir., 1959), rev'd on
other grounds 362 U.S. 396, 80 S.Ct. 789, 4 L.Ed.2d 820 (1960); Kahler-Ellis Co. v. Ohio
Turnpike Commission, 225 F.2d 922 (6th Cir., 1955). An exception is made in the case of briefs
and appendices in order to afford the parties the maximum time for their preparation. By the terms
of the exception, air mail delivery must be used whenever it is the most expeditious manner of
delivery.
A majority of the circuits now require service of all papers filed with the clerk. The usual

provision in present rules is for service on "adverse" parties. In view of the extreme simplicity of
service by mail, there seems to be no reason why a party who files a paper should not be required to
serve all parties to the proceeding in the court of appeals, whether or not they may be deemed
adverse. The common requirement of proof of service is retained, but the rule permits it to be made
by simple certification, which may be endorsed on the copy which is filed.
Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules—1986 Amendment
The amendments to Rules 25(a) and (b) are technical. No substantive change is intended.
Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules—1991 Amendment
Subdivision (a). The amendment permits, but does not require, courts of appeals to adopt
local rules that allow filing of papers by electronic means. However, courts of appeals cannot
adopt such local rules until the Judicial Conference of the United States authorizes filing by
facsimile or other electronic means.
Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules—1993 Amendment
The amendment accompanies new subdivision (c) of Rule 4 and extends the holding in
Houston v. Lack, 487 U.S. 266 (1988), to all papers filed in the courts of appeals by persons
confined in institutions.
Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules—1994 Amendment
Subdivision (a). Several circuits have local rules that authorize the office of the clerk to
refuse to accept for filing papers that are not in the form required by these rules or by local rules.
This is not a suitable role for the office of the clerk and the practice exposes litigants to the hazards
of time bars; for these reasons, such rules are proscribed by this rule. This provision is similar to
Fed.R.Civ.P. 5(e) and Fed.R.Bankr.P. 5005.
The Committee wishes to make it clear that the provision prohibiting a clerk from refusing
a document does not mean that a clerk's office may no longer screen documents to determine
whether they comply with the rules. A court may delegate to the clerk authority to inform a party
about any noncompliance with the rules and, if the party is willing to correct the document, to
determine a date by which the corrected document must be resubmitted. If a party refuses to take
the steps recommended by the clerk or if in the clerk's judgment the party fails to correct the
noncompliance, the clerk must refer the matter to the court for a ruling.
Subdivision (d). Two changes have been made in this subdivision. Subdivision (d) provides
that a paper presented for filing must contain proof of service.
The last sentence of subdivision (d) has been deleted as unnecessary. That sentence stated
that a clerk could permit papers to be filed without acknowledgment or proof of service but must
require that it be filed promptly thereafter. In light of the change made in subdivision (a) which
states that a clerk may not refuse to accept for filing a document because it is not in the proper
form, there is no further need for a provision stating that a clerk may accept a paper lacking a proof
of service. The clerk must accept such a paper. That portion of the deleted sentence stating that the
clerk must require that proof of service be filed promptly after the filing of the document if the
proof is not filed concurrently with the document is also unnecessary.

The second amendment requires that the certificate of service must state the addresses to
which the papers were mailed or at which they were delivered. The Federal Circuit has a similar
local rule, Fed.Cir.R. 25.
Subdivision (e). Subdivision (e) is a new subdivision. It makes it clear that whenever these
rules require a party to file or furnish a number of copies a court may require a different number of
copies either by rule or by order in an individual case. The number of copies of any document that
a court of appeals needs varies depending upon the way in which the court conducts business. The
internal operation of the courts of appeals necessarily varies from circuit to circuit because of
differences in the number of judges, the geographic area included within the circuit, and other such
factors. Uniformity could be achieved only by setting the number of copies artificially high so that
parties in all circuits file enough copies to satisfy the needs of the court requiring the greatest
number. Rather than do that, the Committee decided to make it clear that local rules may require a
greater or lesser number of copies and that, if the circumstances of a particular case indicate the
need for a different number of copies in that case, the court may so order.
A party must consult local rules to determine whether the court requires a different number
than that specified in these national rules. The Committee believes it would be helpful if each
circuit either: 1) included a chart at the beginning of its local rules showing the number of copies of
each document required to be filed with the court along with citation to the controlling rule; or 2)
made available such a chart to each party upon commencement of an appeal; or both. If a party
fails to file the required number of copies, the failure does not create a jurisdictional defect. Rule
3(a) states: "Failure of an appellant to take any step other than the timely filing of a notice of appeal
does not affect the validity of the appeal, but is ground only for such action as the court of appeals
deems appropriate. . . ."
Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules—1996 Amendment
Subdivision (a). The amendment deletes the language requiring a party to use "the most
expeditious form of delivery by mail, except special delivery" in order to file a brief using the
mailbox rule. That language was adopted before the Postal Service offered Express Mail and other
expedited delivery services. The amendment makes it clear that it is sufficient to use First-Class
Mail. Other equally or more expeditious classes of mail service, such as Express Mail, also may be
used. In addition, the amendment permits the use of commercial carriers. The use of private,
overnight courier services has become commonplace in law practice. Expedited services offered
by commercial carriers often provide faster delivery than First-Class Mail; therefore, there should
be no objection to the use of commercial carriers as long as they are reliable. In order to make use
of the mailbox rule when using a commercial carrier, the amendment requires that the filer employ
a carrier who undertakes to deliver the document in no more than three calendar days. The
three-calendar-day period coordinates with the three-day extension provided by Rule 26(c).
Subdivision (c). The amendment permits service by commercial carrier if the carrier is to
deliver the paper to the party being served within three days of the carrier's receipt of the paper.
The amendment also expresses a desire that when reasonable, service on a party be accomplished
by a manner as expeditious as the manner used to file the paper with the court. When a brief or
motion is filed with the court by hand delivering the paper to the clerk's office, or by overnight
courier, the copies should be served on the other parties by an equally expeditious
manner—meaning either by personal service, if distance permits, or by overnight courier, if mail
delivery to the party is not ordinarily accomplished overnight. The reasonableness standard is
included so that if a paper is hand delivered to the clerk's office for filing but the other parties must

be served in a different city, state, or region, personal service on them ordinarily will not be
expected. If use of an equally expeditious manner of service is not reasonable, use of the next most
expeditious manner may be. For example, if the paper is filed by hand delivery to the clerk's office
but the other parties reside in distant cities, service on them need not be personal but in most
instances should be by overnight courier. Even that may not be required, however, if the number of
parties that must be served would make the use of overnight service too costly. A factor that bears
upon the reasonableness of serving parties expeditiously is the immediacy of the relief requested.
Subdivision (d). The amendment adds a requirement that when a brief or appendix is filed
by mail or commercial carrier, the certificate of service state the date and manner by which the
document was mailed or dispatched to the clerk. Including that information in the certificate of
service avoids the necessity for a separate certificate concerning the date and manner of filing.
Committee Notes on Rules—1998 Amendment
The language and organization of the rule are amended to make the rule more easily
understood. In addition to changes made to improve the understanding, the Advisory Committee
has changed language to make style and terminology consistent throughout the appellate rules.
These changes are intended to be stylistic only; a substantive amendment is made, however, in
subdivision (a).
Subdivision (a). The substantive amendment in this subdivision is in subparagraph
(a)(2)(C) and is a companion to an amendment in Rule 4(c). Currently Rule 25(a)(2)(C) provides
that if an inmate confined in an institution files a document by depositing it in the institution's
internal mail system, the document is timely filed if deposited on or before the last day for filing.
Some institutions have special internal mail systems for handling legal mail; such systems often
record the date of deposit of mail by an inmate, the date of delivery of mail to an inmate, etc. The
Advisory Committee amends the rule to require an inmate to use the system designed for legal
mail, if there is one, in order to receive the benefit of this subparagraph.
Committee Notes on Rules—2002 Amendment
Rule 25(a)(2)(D) presently authorizes the courts of appeals to permit papers to be filed by
electronic means. Rule 25 has been amended in several respects to permit papers also to be served
electronically. In addition, Rule 25(c) has been reorganized and subdivided to make it easier to
understand.
Subdivision (c)(1)(D). New subdivision (c)(1)(D) has been added to permit service to be
made electronically, such as by e-mail or fax. No party may be served electronically, either by the
clerk or by another party, unless the party has consented in writing to such service.
A court of appeals may not, by local rule, forbid the use of electronic service on a party that
has consented to its use. At the same time, courts have considerable discretion to use local rules to
regulate electronic service. Difficult and presently unforeseeable questions are likely to arise as
electronic service becomes more common. Courts have the flexibility to use their local rules to
address those questions. For example, courts may use local rules to set forth specific procedures
that a party must follow before the party will be deemed to have given written consent to electronic
service.
Parties also have the flexibility to define the terms of their consent; a party's consent to
electronic service does not have to be "all-or-nothing." For example, a party may consent to
service by facsimile transmission, but not by electronic mail; or a party may consent to electronic

service only if "courtesy" copies of all transmissions are mailed within 24 hours; or a party may
consent to electronic service of only documents that were created with Corel WordPerfect.
Subdivision (c)(2). The courts of appeals are authorized under Rule 25(a)(2)(D) to permit
papers to be filed electronically. Technological advances may someday make it possible for a court
to forward an electronically filed paper to all parties automatically or semi-automatically. When
such court-facilitated service becomes possible, courts may decide to permit parties to use the
courts' transmission facilities to serve electronically filed papers on other parties who have
consented to such service. Court personnel would use the court's computer system to forward the
papers, but the papers would be considered served by the filing parties, just as papers that are
carried from one address to another by the United States Postal Service are considered served by
the sending parties. New subdivision (c)(2) has been added so that the courts of appeals may use
local rules to authorize such use of their transmission facilities, as well as to address the many
questions that court-facilitated electronic service is likely to raise.
Subdivision (c)(4). The second sentence of new subdivision (c)(4) has been added to
provide that electronic service is complete upon transmission. Transmission occurs when the
sender performs the last act that he or she must perform to transmit a paper electronically;
typically, it occurs when the sender hits the "send" or "transmit" button on an electronic mail
program. There is one exception to the rule that electronic service is complete upon transmission:
If the sender is notified—by the sender's e-mail program or otherwise—that the paper was not
received, service is not complete, and the sender must take additional steps to effect service. A
paper has been "received" by the party on which it has been served as long as the party has the
ability to retrieve it. A party cannot defeat service by choosing not to access electronic mail on its
server.
Changes Made After Publication and Comments. No changes were made to the text of the
proposed amendment. A paragraph was added to the Committee Note to clarify that consent to
electronic service is not an "all-or-nothing" matter.
Subdivision (d)(1)(B)(iii). Subdivision (d)(1)(B)(iii) has been amended to require that,
when a paper is served electronically, the proof of service of that paper must include the electronic
address or facsimile number to which the paper was transmitted.
Changes Made After Publication and Comments. The text of the proposed amendment was
changed to refer to "electronic" addresses (instead of to "e-mail" addresses), to include "facsimile
numbers," and to add the concluding phrase "as appropriate for the manner of service."
Conforming changes were made to the Committee Note.
Committee Notes on Rules—2006 Amendment
Subdivision (a)(2)(D). Amended Rule 25(a)(2)(D) acknowledges that many courts have
required electronic filing by means of a standing order, procedures manual, or local rule. These
local practices reflect the advantages that courts and most litigants realize from electronic filing.
Courts that mandate electronic filing recognize the need to make exceptions when requiring
electronic filing imposes a hardship on a party. Under Rule 25(a)(2)(D), a local rule that requires
electronic filing must include reasonable exceptions, but Rule 25(a)(2)(D) does not define the
scope of those exceptions. Experience with the local rules that have been adopted and that will
emerge will aid in drafting new local rules and will facilitate gradual convergence on uniform
exceptions, whether in local rules or in an amended Rule 25(a)(2)(D).
A local rule may require that both electronic and "hard" copies of a paper be filed. Nothing
in the last sentence of Rule 25(a)(2)(D) is meant to imply otherwise.

Changes Made After Publication and Comment. Rule 25(a)(2)(D) has been changed in one
significant respect: It now authorizes the courts of appeals to require electronic filing only "if
reasonable exceptions are allowed." 1 The published version of Rule 25(a)(2)(D) did not require
"reasonable exceptions." The change was made in response to the argument of many
commentators that the national rule should require that the local rules include exceptions for those
for whom mandatory electronic filing would pose a hardship.
Although Rule 25(a)(2)(D) requires that hardship exceptions be included in any local rules
that mandate electronic filing, it does not attempt to define the scope of those exceptions.
Commentators were largely in agreement that the local rules should include hardship exceptions of
some type. But commentators did not agree about the perimeters of those exceptions. The
Advisory Committee believes that, at this point, it does not have enough experience with
mandatory electronic filing to impose specific hardship exceptions on the circuits. Rather, the
Advisory Committee believes that the circuits should be free for the time being to experiment with
different formulations.
The Committee Note has been changed to reflect the addition of the "reasonable
exceptions" clause to the text of the rule. The Committee Note has also been changed to add the
final two sentences. Those sentences were added at the request of Judge Sandra L. Lynch, a
member of CACM [the Court Administration and Case Management Committee]. Judge Lynch
believes that there will be few appellate judges who will want to receive only electronic copies of
briefs, but there will be many who will want to receive electronic copies in addition to hard copies.
Thus, the local rules of most circuits are likely to require a "written" copy or "paper" copy, in
addition to an electronic copy. The problem is that the last sentence of Rule 25(a)(2)(D) provides
that "[a] paper filed by electronic means in compliance with a local rule constitutes a written paper
for the purpose of applying these rules." Judge Lynch's concern is that this sentence may leave
attorneys confused as to whether a local rule requiring a "written" or "paper" copy of a brief
requires anything in addition to the electronic copy. The final two sentences of the Committee
Note are intended to clarify the matter.
Committee Notes on Rules—2007 Amendment
Subdivision (a)(5). Section 205(c)(3)(A)(i) of the E-Government Act of 2002 (Public Law
107–347, as amended by Public Law 108–281) requires that the rules of practice and procedure be
amended "to protect privacy and security concerns relating to electronic filing of documents and
the public availability . . . of documents filed electronically." In response to that directive, the
Federal Rules of Bankruptcy, Civil, and Criminal Procedure have been amended, not merely to
address the privacy and security concerns raised by documents that are filed electronically, but
also to address similar concerns raised by documents that are filed in paper form. See Fed. R.
Bankr. P. 9037; Fed. R. Civ. P. 5.2; and Fed. R. Crim. P. 49.1.
Appellate Rule 25(a)(5) requires that, in cases that arise on appeal from a district court,
bankruptcy appellate panel, or bankruptcy court, the privacy rule that applied to the case below
will continue to apply to the case on appeal. With one exception, all other cases—such as cases
involving the review or enforcement of an agency order, the review of a decision of the tax court,
or the consideration of a petition for an extraordinary writ—will be governed by Civil Rule 5.2.
The only exception is when an extraordinary writ is sought in a criminal case—that is, a case in
which the related trial-court proceeding is governed by Criminal Rule 49.1. In such a case,
Criminal Rule 49.1 will govern in the court of appeals as well.
Changes Made After Publication and Comment. The rule is a modified version of the

provision as published. The changes from the published proposal implement suggestions by the
Style Subcommittee of the Standing Committee on Rules of Practice and Procedure.
Committee Notes on Rules—2009 Amendment
Under former Rule 26(a), short periods that span weekends or holidays were computed
without counting those weekends or holidays. To specify that a period should be calculated by
counting all intermediate days, including weekends or holidays, the Rules used the term "calendar
days." Rule 26(a) now takes a "days-are-days" approach under which all intermediate days are
counted, no matter how short the period. Accordingly, "3 calendar days" in subdivisions
(a)(2)(B)(ii) and (c)(1)(C) is amended to read simply "3 days."
1
At its June 15–16, 2005, meeting, the Standing Rules Committee with the concurrence of
the advisory committee chair agreed to set out the "reasonable exception" clause as a separate
sentence in the rule, consistent with drafting conventions of the Style Project.

Rule 26. Computing and Extending Time
(a) Computing Time. The following rules apply in computing any time period specified in
these rules, in any local rule or court order, or in any statute that does not specify a method of
computing time.
(1) Period Stated in Days or a Longer Unit. When the period is stated in days or a longer
unit of time:
(A) exclude the day of the event that triggers the period;
(B) count every day, including intermediate Saturdays, Sundays, and legal holidays; and
(C) include the last day of the period, but if the last day is a Saturday, Sunday, or legal
holiday, the period continues to run until the end of the next day that is not a Saturday, Sunday, or
legal holiday.
(2) Period Stated in Hours. When the period is stated in hours:
(A) begin counting immediately on the occurrence of the event that triggers the period;
(B) count every hour, including hours during intermediate Saturdays, Sundays, and legal
holidays; and
(C) if the period would end on a Saturday, Sunday, or legal holiday, the period continues to
run until the same time on the next day that is not a Saturday, Sunday, or legal holiday.
(3) Inaccessibility of the Clerk's Office. Unless the court orders otherwise, if the clerk's
office is inaccessible:
(A) on the last day for filing under Rule 26(a)(1), then the time for filing is extended to the
first accessible day that is not a Saturday, Sunday, or legal holiday; or
(B) during the last hour for filing under Rule 26(a)(2), then the time for filing is extended to
the same time on the first accessible day that is not a Saturday, Sunday, or legal holiday.
(4) "Last Day" Defined. Unless a different time is set by a statute, local rule, or court order,
the last day ends:
(A) for electronic filing in the district court, at midnight in the court's time zone;

(B) for electronic filing in the court of appeals, at midnight in the time zone of the circuit
clerk's principal office;
(C) for filing under Rules 4(c)(1), 25(a)(2)(B), and 25(a)(2)(C)—and filing by mail under
Rule 13(b)—at the latest time for the method chosen for delivery to the post office, third-party
commercial carrier, or prison mailing system; and
(D) for filing by other means, when the clerk's office is scheduled to close.
(5) "Next Day" Defined. The "next day" is determined by continuing to count forward
when the period is measured after an event and backward when measured before an event.
(6) "Legal Holiday" Defined. "Legal holiday" means:
(A) the day set aside by statute for observing New Year's Day, Martin Luther King Jr.'s
Birthday, Washington's Birthday, Memorial Day, Independence Day, Labor Day, Columbus Day,
Veterans' Day, Thanksgiving Day, or Christmas Day;
(B) any day declared a holiday by the President or Congress; and
(C) for periods that are measured after an event, any other day declared a holiday by the
state where either of the following is located: the district court that rendered the challenged
judgment or order, or the circuit clerk's principal office.
(b) Extending Time. For good cause, the court may extend the time prescribed by these
rules or by its order to perform any act, or may permit an act to be done after that time expires. But
the court may not extend the time to file:
(1) a notice of appeal (except as authorized in Rule 4) or a petition for permission to appeal;
or
(2) a notice of appeal from or a petition to enjoin, set aside, suspend, modify, enforce, or
otherwise review an order of an administrative agency, board, commission, or officer of the United
States, unless specifically authorized by law.
(c) Additional Time after Service. When a party may or must act within a specified time
after service, 3 days are added after the period would otherwise expire under Rule 26(a), unless the
paper is delivered on the date of service stated in the proof of service. For purposes of this Rule
26(c), a paper that is served electronically is not treated as delivered on the date of service stated in
the proof of service.
(As amended Mar. 1, 1971, eff. July 1, 1971; Mar. 10, 1986, eff. July 1, 1986; Apr. 25,

2009, eff. Dec. 1, 2009.)
Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules—1967
The provisions of this rule are based upon FRCP 6(a), (b) and (e). See also Supreme Court
Rule 34 and FRCrP 45. Unlike FRCP 6(b), this rule, read with Rule 27, requires that every request
for enlargement of time be made by motion, with proof of service on all parties. This is the
simplest, most convenient way of keeping all parties advised of developments. By the terms of
Rule 27(b) a motion for enlargement of time under Rule 26(b) may be entertained and acted upon
immediately, subject to the right of any party to seek reconsideration. Thus the requirement of
motion and notice will not delay the granting of relief of a kind which a court is inclined to grant as
of course. Specifically, if a court is of the view that an extension of time sought before expiration

of the period originally prescribed or as extended by a previous order ought to be granted in effect
ex parte, as FRCP 6(b) permits, it may grant motions seeking such relief without delay.
Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules—1971 Amendment
The amendment adds Columbus Day to the list of legal holidays to conform the
subdivision to the Act of June 28, 1968, 82 Stat. 250, which constituted Columbus Day a legal
holiday effective after January 1, 1971.
The Act, which amended Title 5, U.S.C. §6103(a), changes the day on which certain
holidays are to be observed. Washington's Birthday, Memorial Day and Veterans Day are to be
observed on the third Monday in February, the last Monday in May and the fourth Monday in
October, respectively, rather than, as heretofore, on February 22, May 30, and November 11,
respectively. Columbus Day is to be observed on the second Monday in October. New Year's Day,
Independence Day, Thanksgiving Day and Christmas continue to be observed on the traditional
days.
Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules—1986 Amendment
The Birthday of Martin Luther King, Jr., is added to the list of national holidays in Rule
26(a). The amendment to Rule 26(c) is technical. No substantive change is intended.
Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules—1989 Amendment
The proposed amendment brings Rule 26(a) into conformity with the provisions of Rule
6(a) of the Rules of Civil Procedure, Rule 45(a) of the Rules of Criminal Procedure, and Rule
9006(a) of the Rules of Bankruptcy Procedure which allow additional time for filing whenever a
clerk's office is inaccessible on the last day for filing due to weather or other conditions.
Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules—1996 Amendment
The amendment is a companion to the proposed amendments to Rule 25 that permit service
on a party by commercial carrier. The amendments to subdivision (c) of this rule make the
three-day extension applicable not only when service is accomplished by mail, but whenever
delivery to the party being served occurs later than the date of service stated in the proof of service.
When service is by mail or commercial carrier, the proof of service recites the date of mailing or
delivery to the commercial carrier. If the party being served receives the paper on a later date, the
three-day extension applies. If the party being served receives the paper on the same date as the
date of service recited in the proof of service, the three-day extension is not available.
The amendment also states that the three-day extension is three calendar days. Rule 26(a)
states that when a period prescribed or allowed by the rules is less than seven days, intermediate
Saturdays, Sundays, and legal holidays do not count. Whether the three-day extension in Rule
26(c) is such a period, meaning that three-days could actually be five or even six days, is unclear.
The D.C. Circuit recently held that the parallel three-day extension provided in the Civil Rules is
not such a period and that weekends and legal holidays do count. CNPq v. Inter-Trade, 50 F.3d 56
(D.C. Cir. 1995). The Committee believes that is the right result and that the issue should be
resolved. Providing that the extension is three calendar days means that if a period would
otherwise end on Thursday but the three-day extension applies, the paper must be filed on

Monday. Friday, Saturday, and Sunday are the extension days. Because the last day of the period
as extended is Sunday, the paper must be filed the next day, Monday.
Committee Notes on Rules—1998 Amendment
The language and organization of the rule are amended to make the rule more easily
understood. In addition to changes made to improve the understanding, the Advisory Committee
has changed language to make style and terminology consistent throughout the appellate rules.
These changes are intended to be stylistic only; two substantive changes are made, however, in
subdivision (a).
Subdivision (a). First, the amendments make the computation method prescribed in this
rule applicable to any time period imposed by a local rule. This means that if a local rule
establishing a time limit is permitted, the national rule will govern the computation of that period.
Second, paragraph (a)(2) includes language clarifying that whenever the rules establish a
time period in "calendar days," weekends and legal holidays are counted.
Committee Notes on Rules—2002 Amendment
Subdivision (a)(2). The Federal Rules of Civil Procedure and the Federal Rules of Criminal
Procedure compute time differently than the Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure. Fed. R. Civ. P.
6(a) and Fed. R. Crim. P. 45(a) provide that, in computing any period of time, "[w]hen the period
of time prescribed or allowed is less than 11 days, intermediate Saturdays, Sundays, and legal
holidays shall be excluded in the computation." By contrast, Rule 26(a)(2) provides that, in
computing any period of time, a litigant should "[e]xclude intermediate Saturdays, Sundays, and
legal holidays when the period is less than 7 days, unless stated in calendar days." Thus, deadlines
of 7, 8, 9, and 10 days are calculated differently under the rules of civil and criminal procedure
than they are under the rules of appellate procedure. This creates a trap for unwary litigants. No
good reason for this discrepancy is apparent, and thus Rule 26(a)(2) has been amended so that,
under all three sets of rules, intermediate Saturdays, Sundays, and legal holidays will be excluded
when computing deadlines under 11 days but will be counted when computing deadlines of 11
days and over.
Changes Made After Publication and Comments. No changes were made to the text of the
proposed amendment or to the Committee Note.
Subdivision (c). Rule 26(c) has been amended to provide that when a paper is served on a
party by electronic means, and that party is required or permitted to respond to that paper within a
prescribed period, 3 calendar days are added to the prescribed period. Electronic service is usually
instantaneous, but sometimes it is not, because of technical problems. Also, if a paper is
electronically transmitted to a party on a Friday evening, the party may not realize that he or she
has been served until two or three days later. Finally, extending the "3-day rule" to electronic
service will encourage parties to consent to such service under Rule 25(c).
Changes Made After Publication and Comments. No changes were made to the text of the
proposed amendment or to the Committee Note.
Committee Notes on Rules—2005 Amendment
Subdivision (a)(4). Rule 26(a)(4) has been amended to refer to the third Monday in
February as "Washington's Birthday." A federal statute officially designates the holiday as

"Washington's Birthday," reflecting the desire of Congress specially to honor the first president of
the United States. See 5 U.S.C. §6103(a). During the 1998 restyling of the Federal Rules of
Appellate Procedure, references to "Washington's Birthday" were mistakenly changed to
"Presidents' Day." The amendment corrects that error.
Changes Made After Publication and Comments. No changes were made to the text of the
proposed amendment or to the Committee Note.
Committee Notes on Rules—2009 Amendment
Subdivision (a). Subdivision (a) has been amended to simplify and clarify the provisions
that describe how deadlines are computed. Subdivision (a) governs the computation of any time
period found in a statute that does not specify a method of computing time, a Federal Rule of
Appellate Procedure, a local rule, or a court order. In accordance with Rule 47(a)(1), a local rule
may not direct that a deadline be computed in a manner inconsistent with subdivision (a).
The time-computation provisions of subdivision (a) apply only when a time period must be
computed. They do not apply when a fixed time to act is set. The amendments thus carry forward
the approach taken in Violette v. P.A. Days, Inc., 427 F.3d 1015, 1016 (6th Cir. 2005) (holding that
Civil Rule 6(a) "does not apply to situations where the court has established a specific calendar day
as a deadline"), and reject the contrary holding of In re American Healthcare Management, Inc.,
900 F.2d 827, 832 (5th Cir. 1990) (holding that Bankruptcy Rule 9006(a) governs treatment of
date-certain deadline set by court order). If, for example, the date for filing is "no later than
November 1, 2007," subdivision (a) does not govern. But if a filing is required to be made "within
10 days" or "within 72 hours," subdivision (a) describes how that deadline is computed.
Subdivision (a) does not apply when computing a time period set by a statute if the statute
specifies a method of computing time. See, e.g., 20 U.S.C. §7711(b)(1) (requiring certain petitions
for review by a local educational agency or a state to be filed "within 30 working days (as
determined by the local educational agency or State) after receiving notice of" federal agency
decision).
Subdivision (a)(1). New subdivision (a)(1) addresses the computation of time periods that
are stated in days. It also applies to time periods that are stated in weeks, months, or years; though
no such time period currently appears in the Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure, such periods
may be set by other covered provisions such as a local rule. See, e.g., Third Circuit Local Appellate
Rule 46.3(c)(1). Subdivision (a)(1)(B)'s directive to "count every day" is relevant only if the period
is stated in days (not weeks, months or years).
Under former Rule 26(a), a period of 11 days or more was computed differently than a
period of less than 11 days. Intermediate Saturdays, Sundays, and legal holidays were included in
computing the longer periods, but excluded in computing the shorter periods. Former Rule 26(a)
thus made computing deadlines unnecessarily complicated and led to counterintuitive results. For
example, a 10-day period and a 14-day period that started on the same day usually ended on the
same day—and the 10-day period not infrequently ended later than the 14-day period. See
Miltimore Sales, Inc. v. Int'l Rectifier, Inc., 412 F.3d 685, 686 (6th Cir. 2005).
Under new subdivision (a)(1), all deadlines stated in days (no matter the length) are
computed in the same way. The day of the event that triggers the deadline is not counted. All other
days—including intermediate Saturdays, Sundays, and legal holidays—are counted, with only one
exception: If the period ends on a Saturday, Sunday, or legal holiday, then the deadline falls on the
next day that is not a Saturday, Sunday, or legal holiday. An illustration is provided below in the
discussion of subdivision (a)(5). Subdivision (a)(3) addresses filing deadlines that expire on a day

when the clerk's office is inaccessible.
Where subdivision (a) formerly referred to the "act, event, or default" that triggers the
deadline, new subdivision (a) refers simply to the "event" that triggers the deadline; this change in
terminology is adopted for brevity and simplicity, and is not intended to change meaning.
Periods previously expressed as less than 11 days will be shortened as a practical matter by
the decision to count intermediate Saturdays, Sundays, and legal holidays in computing all
periods. Many of those periods have been lengthened to compensate for the change. See, e.g.,
Rules 5(b)(2), 5(d)(1), 28.1(f), & 31(a).
Most of the 10-day periods were adjusted to meet the change in computation method by
setting 14 days as the new period. A 14-day period corresponds to the most frequent result of a
10-day period under the former computation method—two Saturdays and two Sundays were
excluded, giving 14 days in all. A 14-day period has an additional advantage. The final day falls on
the same day of the week as the event that triggered the period—the 14th day after a Monday, for
example, is a Monday. This advantage of using week-long periods led to adopting 7-day periods to
replace some of the periods set at less than 10 days, and 21-day periods to replace 20-day periods.
Thirty-day and longer periods, however, were retained without change.
Subdivision (a)(2). New subdivision (a)(2) addresses the computation of time periods that
are stated in hours. No such deadline currently appears in the Federal Rules of Appellate
Procedure. But some statutes contain deadlines stated in hours, as do some court orders issued in
expedited proceedings.
Under subdivision (a)(2), a deadline stated in hours starts to run immediately on the
occurrence of the event that triggers the deadline. The deadline generally ends when the time
expires. If, however, the time period expires at a specific time (say, 2:17 p.m.) on a Saturday,
Sunday, or legal holiday, then the deadline is extended to the same time (2:17 p.m.) on the next day
that is not a Saturday, Sunday, or legal holiday. Periods stated in hours are not to be "rounded up"
to the next whole hour. Subdivision (a)(3) addresses situations when the clerk's office is
inaccessible during the last hour before a filing deadline expires.
Subdivision (a)(2)(B) directs that every hour be counted. Thus, for example, a 72-hour
period that commences at 10:00 a.m. on Friday, November 2, 2007, will run until 9:00 a.m. on
Monday, November 5; the discrepancy in start and end times in this example results from the
intervening shift from daylight saving time to standard time.
Subdivision (a)(3). When determining the last day of a filing period stated in days or a
longer unit of time, a day on which the clerk's office is not accessible because of the weather or
another reason is treated like a Saturday, Sunday, or legal holiday. When determining the end of a
filing period stated in hours, if the clerk's office is inaccessible during the last hour of the filing
period computed under subdivision (a)(2) then the period is extended to the same time on the next
day that is not a weekend, holiday or day when the clerk's office is inaccessible.
Subdivision (a)(3)'s extensions apply "[u]nless the court orders otherwise." In some
circumstances, the court might not wish a period of inaccessibility to trigger a full 24-hour
extension; in those instances, the court can specify a briefer extension.
The text of the rule no longer refers to "weather or other conditions" as the reason for the
inaccessibility of the clerk's office. The reference to "weather" was deleted from the text to
underscore that inaccessibility can occur for reasons unrelated to weather, such as an outage of the
electronic filing system. Weather can still be a reason for inaccessibility of the clerk's office. The
rule does not attempt to define inaccessibility. Rather, the concept will continue to develop
through caselaw, see, e.g., Tchakmakjian v. Department of Defense, 57 Fed. Appx. 438, 441 (Fed.

Cir. 2003) (unpublished per curiam opinion) (inaccessibility "due to anthrax concerns"); cf.
William G. Phelps, When Is Office of Clerk of Court Inaccessible Due to Weather or Other
Conditions for Purpose of Computing Time Period for Filing Papers under Rule 6(a) of Federal
Rules of Civil Procedure, 135 A.L.R. Fed. 259 (1996) (collecting cases). In addition, local
provisions may address inaccessibility for purposes of electronic filing.
Subdivision (a)(4). New subdivision (a)(4) defines the end of the last day of a period for
purposes of subdivision (a)(1). Subdivision (a)(4) does not apply in computing periods stated in
hours under subdivision (a)(2), and does not apply if a different time is set by a statute, local rule,
or order in the case. A local rule may, for example, address the problems that might arise under
subdivision (a)(4)(A) if a single district has clerk's offices in different time zones, or provide that
papers filed in a drop box after the normal hours of the clerk's office are filed as of the day that is
date-stamped on the papers by a device in the drop box.
28 U.S.C. §452 provides that "[a]ll courts of the United States shall be deemed always open
for the purpose of filing proper papers, issuing and returning process, and making motions and
orders." A corresponding provision exists in Rule 45(a)(2). Some courts have held that these
provisions permit an after-hours filing by handing the papers to an appropriate official. See, e.g.,
Casalduc v. Diaz, 117 F.2d 915, 917 (1st Cir. 1941). Subdivision (a)(4) does not address the effect
of the statute on the question of after-hours filing; instead, the rule is designed to deal with filings
in the ordinary course without regard to Section 452.
Subdivision (a)(4)(A) addresses electronic filings in the district court. For example,
subdivision (a)(4)(A) would apply to an electronically-filed notice of appeal. Subdivision
(a)(4)(B) addresses electronic filings in the court of appeals.
Subdivision (a)(4)(C) addresses filings by mail under Rules 25(a)(2)(B)(i) and 13(b),
filings by third-party commercial carrier under Rule 25(a)(2)(B)(ii), and inmate filings under
Rules 4(c)(1) and 25(a)(2)(C). For such filings, subdivision (a)(4)(C) provides that the "last day"
ends at the latest time (prior to midnight in the filer's time zone) that the filer can properly submit
the filing to the post office, third-party commercial carrier, or prison mail system (as applicable)
using the filer's chosen method of submission. For example, if a correctional institution's legal mail
system's rules of operation provide that items may only be placed in the mail system between 9:00
a.m. and 5:00 p.m., then the "last day" for filings under Rules 4(c)(1) and 25(a)(2)(C) by inmates in
that institution ends at 5:00 p.m. As another example, if a filer uses a drop box maintained by a
third-party commercial carrier, the "last day" ends at the time of that drop box's last scheduled
pickup. Filings by mail under Rule 13(b) continue to be subject to §7502 of the Internal Revenue
Code, as amended, and the applicable regulations.
Subdivision (a)(4)(D) addresses all other non-electronic filings; for such filings, the last
day ends under (a)(4)(D) when the clerk's office in which the filing is made is scheduled to close.
Subdivision (a)(5). New subdivision (a)(5) defines the "next" day for purposes of
subdivisions (a)(1)(C) and (a)(2)(C). The Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure contain both
forward-looking time periods and backward-looking time periods. A forward-looking time period
requires something to be done within a period of time after an event. See, e.g., Rule 4(a)(1)(A)
(subject to certain exceptions, notice of appeal in a civil case must be filed "within 30 days after the
judgment or order appealed from is entered"). A backward-looking time period requires something
to be done within a period of time before an event. See, e.g., Rule 31(a)(1) ("[A] reply brief must
be filed at least 7 days before argument, unless the court, for good cause, allows a later filing."). In
determining what is the "next" day for purposes of subdivisions (a)(1)(C) and (a)(2)(C), one
should continue counting in the same direction—that is, forward when computing a

forward-looking period and backward when computing a backward-looking period. If, for
example, a filing is due within 10 days after an event, and the tenth day falls on Saturday,
September 1, 2007, then the filing is due on Tuesday, September 4, 2007 (Monday, September 3, is
Labor Day). But if a filing is due 10 days before an event, and the tenth day falls on Saturday,
September 1, then the filing is due on Friday, August 31. If the clerk's office is inaccessible on
August 31, then subdivision (a)(3) extends the filing deadline forward to the next accessible day
that is not a Saturday, Sunday or legal holiday—no earlier than Tuesday, September 4.
Subdivision (a)(6). New subdivision (a)(6) defines "legal holiday" for purposes of the
Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure, including the time-computation provisions of subdivision
(a). Subdivision (a)(6) continues to include within the definition of "legal holiday" days that are
declared a holiday by the President or Congress.
For forward-counted periods—i.e., periods that are measured after an event—subdivision
(a)(6)(C) includes certain state holidays within the definition of legal holidays. However, state
legal holidays are not recognized in computing backward-counted periods. For both forward-and
backward-counted periods, the rule thus protects those who may be unsure of the effect of state
holidays. For forward-counted deadlines, treating state holidays the same as federal holidays
extends the deadline. Thus, someone who thought that the federal courts might be closed on a state
holiday would be safeguarded against an inadvertent late filing. In contrast, for backward-counted
deadlines, not giving state holidays the treatment of federal holidays allows filing on the state
holiday itself rather than the day before. Take, for example, Monday, April 21, 2008 (Patriot's
Day, a legal holiday in the relevant state). If a filing is due 14 days after an event, and the
fourteenth day is April 21, then the filing is due on Tuesday, April 22 because Monday, April 21
counts as a legal holiday. But if a filing is due 14 days before an event, and the fourteenth day is
April 21, the filing is due on Monday, April 21; the fact that April 21 is a state holiday does not
make April 21 a legal holiday for purposes of computing this backward-counted deadline. But note
that if the clerk's office is inaccessible on Monday, April 21, then subdivision (a)(3) extends the
April 21 filing deadline forward to the next accessible day that is not a Saturday, Sunday or legal
holiday—no earlier than Tuesday, April 22.
Subdivision (c). To specify that a period should be calculated by counting all intermediate
days, including weekends or holidays, the Rules formerly used the term "calendar days." Because
new subdivision (a) takes a "days-are-days" approach under which all intermediate days are
counted, no matter how short the period, "3 calendar days" in subdivision (c) is amended to read
simply "3 days."
Rule 26(c) has been amended to eliminate uncertainty about application of the 3-day rule.
Civil Rule 6(e) was amended in 2004 to eliminate similar uncertainty in the Civil Rules.
Under the amendment, a party that is required or permitted to act within a prescribed period
should first calculate that period, without reference to the 3-day rule provided by Rule 26(c), but
with reference to the other time computation provisions of the Appellate Rules. After the party has
identified the date on which the prescribed period would expire but for the operation of Rule 26(c),
the party should add 3 calendar days. The party must act by the third day of the extension, unless
that day is a Saturday, Sunday, or legal holiday, in which case the party must act by the next day
that is not a Saturday, Sunday, or legal holiday.
To illustrate: A paper is served by mail on Thursday, November 1, 2007. The prescribed
time to respond is 30 days. The prescribed period ends on Monday, December 3 (because the 30th
day falls on a Saturday, the prescribed period extends to the following Monday). Under Rule 26(c),
three calendar days are added—Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday—and thus the response is due

on Thursday, December 6.
Changes Made After Publication and Comment. No changes were made after publication
and comment, except for the style changes (described below) [omitted] which were suggested by
Professor Kimble.

Rule 26.1. Corporate Disclosure Statement
(a) Who Must File. Any nongovernmental corporate party to a proceeding in a court of
appeals must file a statement that identifies any parent corporation and any publicly held
corporation that owns 10% or more of its stock or states that there is no such corporation.
(b) Time for Filing; Supplemental Filing. A party must file the Rule 26.1(a) statement with
the principal brief or upon filing a motion, response, petition, or answer in the court of appeals,
whichever occurs first, unless a local rule requires earlier filing. Even if the statement has already
been filed, the party's principal brief must include the statement before the table of contents. A
party must supplement its statement whenever the information that must be disclosed under Rule
26.1(a) changes.
(c) Number of Copies. If the Rule 26.1(a) statement is filed before the principal brief, or if
a supplemental statement is filed, the party must file an original and 3 copies unless the court
requires a different number by local rule or by order in a particular case.
(As added Apr. 25, 1989, eff. Dec. 1, 1989; amended Apr. 30, 1991, eff. Dec. 1, 1991; Apr.
29, 1994, eff. Dec. 1, 1994; Apr. 24, 1998, eff. Dec. 1, 1998; Apr. 29, 2002, eff. Dec. 1, 2002.)
Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules—1989
The purpose of this rule is to assist judges in making a determination of whether they have
any interests in any of a party's related corporate entities that would disqualify the judges from
hearing the appeal. The committee believes that this rule represents minimum disclosure
requirements. If a Court of Appeals wishes to require additional information, a court is free to do
so by local rule. However, the committee requests the courts to consider the desirability of
uniformity and the burden that varying circuit rules creates on attorneys who practice in many
circuits.
Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules—1994 Amendment
The amendment requires a party to file three copies of the disclosure statement whenever
the statement is filed before the party's principal brief. Because the statement is included in each
copy of the party's brief, there is no need to require the filing of additional copies at that time. A
court of appeals may require the filing of a different number of copies by local rule or by order in a
particular case.
Committee Notes on Rules—1998 Amendment
The language and organization of the rule are amended to make the rule more easily
understood. In addition to changes made to improve the understanding, the Advisory Committee
has changed language to make style and terminology consistent throughout the appellate rules.
These changes are intended to be stylistic only; a substantive change is made, however, in

subdivision (a).
Subdivison [sic] (a). The amendment deletes the requirement that a corporate party
identify subsidiaries and affiliates that have issued shares to the public. Although several circuit
rules require identification of such entities, the Committee believes that such disclosure is
unnecessary.
A disclosure statement assists a judge in ascertaining whether or not the judge has an
interest that should cause the judge to recuse himself or herself from the case. Given that purpose,
disclosure of entities that would not be adversely affected by a decision in the case is unnecessary.
Disclosure of a party's parent corporation is necessary because a judgment against a
subsidiary can negatively impact the parent. A judge who owns stock in the parent corporation,
therefore, has an interest in litigation involving the subsidiary. The rule requires disclosure of all of
a party's parent corporations meaning grandparent and great grandparent corporations as well. For
example, if a party is a closely held corporation, the majority shareholder of which is a corporation
formed by a publicly traded corporation for the purpose of acquiring and holding the shares of the
party, the publicly traded grandparent corporation should be disclosed. Conversely, disclosure of a
party's subsidiaries or affiliated corporations is ordinarily unnecessary. For example, if a party is a
part owner of a corporation in which a judge owns stock, the possibility is quite remote that the
judge might be biased by the fact that the judge and the litigant are co-owners of a corporation.
The amendment, however, adds a requirement that the party lists all its stockholders that
are publicly held companies owning 10% or more of the stock of the party. A judgment against a
corporate party can adversely affect the value of the company's stock and, therefore, persons
owning stock in the party have an interest in the outcome of the litigation. A judge owning stock in
a corporate party ordinarily recuses himself or herself. The new requirement takes the analysis one
step further and assumes that if a judge owns stock in a publicly held corporation which in turn
owns 10% or more of the stock in the party, the judge may have sufficient interest in the litigation
to require recusal. The 10% threshold ensures that the corporation in which the judge may own
stock is itself sufficiently invested in the party that a judgment adverse to the party could have an
adverse impact upon the investing corporation in which the judge may own stock. This
requirement is modeled on the Seventh Circuit's disclosure requirement.
Subdivision (b). The language requiring inclusion of the disclosure statement in a party's
principal brief is moved to this subdivision because it deals with the time for filing the statement.
Committee Notes on Rules—2002 Amendment
a. Alternative One [At its June 7–8, 2001, meeting, the Committee on Rules of Practice and
Procedure voted to reject Alternative One.]
Subdivision (a). Rule 26.1(a) presently requires nongovernmental corporate parties to file a
"corporate disclosure statement." In that statement, a nongovernmental corporate party is required
to identify all of its parent corporations and all publicly held corporations that own 10% or more of
its stock. The corporate disclosure statement is intended to assist judges in determining whether
they must recuse themselves by reason of "a financial interest in the subject matter in controversy."
Code of Judicial Conduct, Canon 3C(1)(c) (1972).
Rule 26.1(a) has been amended to require that nongovernmental corporate parties who
currently do not have to file a corporate disclosure statement—that is, nongovernmental corporate
parties who do not have any parent corporations and at least 10% of whose stock is not owned by
any publicly held corporation—inform the court of that fact. At present, when a corporate
disclosure statement is not filed, courts do not know whether it has not been filed because there

was nothing to report or because of ignorance of Rule 26.1(a).
Rule 26.1(a) does not require the disclosure of all information that could conceivably be
relevant to a judge who is trying to decide whether he or she has a "financial interest" in a case.
Experience with divergent disclosure practices and improving technology may provide the
foundation for more comprehensive disclosure requirements. The Judicial Conference, supported
by the committees that work regularly with the Code of Judicial Conduct and by the
Administrative Office of the United States Courts, is in the best position to develop any additional
requirements and to adjust those requirements as technology and other developments warrant.
Thus, Rule 26.1(a) has been amended to authorize the Judicial Conference to promulgate more
detailed financial disclosure requirements—requirements that might apply beyond
nongovernmental corporate parties.
As has been true in the past, Rule 26.1(a) does not forbid the promulgation of local rules
that require disclosures in addition to those required by Rule 26.1(a) itself. However, along with
the authority provided to the Judicial Conference to require additional disclosures is the authority
to preempt any local rulemaking on the topic of financial disclosure.
Subdivision (b). Rule 26.1(b) has been amended to require parties to file supplemental
disclosure statements whenever there is a change in the information that Rule 26.1(a) requires the
parties to disclose. For example, if a publicly held corporation acquires 10% or more of a party's
stock after the party has filed its disclosure statement, the party should file a supplemental
statement identifying that publicly held corporation.
Subdivision (c). Rule 26.1(c) has been amended to provide that a party who is required to
file a supplemental disclosure statement must file an original and 3 copies, unless a local rule or an
order entered in a particular case provides otherwise.
b. Alternative Two [At its June 7–8, 2001, meeting, the Committee on Rules of Practice and
Procedure voted to approve Alternative Two.]
Subdivision (a). Rule 26.1(a) requires nongovernmental corporate parties to file a
"corporate disclosure statement." In that statement, a nongovernmental corporate party is required
to identify all of its parent corporations and all publicly held corporations that own 10% or more of
its stock. The corporate disclosure statement is intended to assist judges in determining whether
they must recuse themselves by reason of "a financial interest in the subject matter in controversy."
Code of Judicial Conduct, Canon 3C(1)(c) (1972).
Rule 26.1(a) has been amended to require that nongovernmental corporate parties who
have not been required to file a corporate disclosure statement—that is, nongovernmental
corporate parties who do not have any parent corporations and at least 10% of whose stock is not
owned by any publicly held corporation—inform the court of that fact. At present, when a
corporate disclosure statement is not filed, courts do not know whether it has not been filed
because there was nothing to report or because of ignorance of Rule 26.1.
Subdivision (b). Rule 26.1(b) has been amended to require parties to file supplemental
disclosure statements whenever there is a change in the information that Rule 26.1(a) requires the
parties to disclose. For example, if a publicly held corporation acquires 10% or more of a party's
stock after the party has filed its disclosure statement, the party should file a supplemental
statement identifying that publicly held corporation.
Subdivision (c). Rule 26.1(c) has been amended to provide that a party who is required to
file a supplemental disclosure statement must file an original and 3 copies, unless a local rule or an
order entered in a particular case provides otherwise.
Changes Made After Publication and Comments. The Committee is submitting two

versions of proposed Rule 26.1 for the consideration of the Standing Committee.
The first version—"Alternative One"—is the same as the version that was published,
except that the rule has been amended to refer to "any information that may be publicly designated
by the Judicial Conference" instead of to "any information that may be required by the Judicial
Conference." At its April meeting, the Committee gave unconditional approval to all of
"Alternative One," except the Judicial Conference provisions. The Committee conditioned its
approval of the Judicial Conference provisions on the Standing Committee's assuring itself that
lawyers would have ready access to any standards promulgated by the Judicial Conference and
that the Judicial Conference provisions were consistent with the Rules Enabling Act.
The second version—"Alternative Two"—is the same as the version that was published,
except that the Judicial Conference provisions have been eliminated. The Civil Rules Committee
met several days after the Appellate Rules Committee and joined the Bankruptcy Rules Committee
in disapproving the Judicial Conference provisions. Given the decreasing likelihood that the
Judicial Conference provisions will be approved by the Standing Committee, I asked Prof. Schiltz
to draft, and the Appellate Rules Committee to approve, a version of Rule 26.1 that omitted those
provisions. "Alternative Two" was circulated to and approved by the Committee in late April.
I should note that, at its April meeting, the Appellate Rules Committee discussed the
financial disclosure provision that was approved by the Bankruptcy Rules Committee. That
provision defines the scope of the financial disclosure obligation much differently than the
provisions approved by the Appellate, Civil, and Criminal Rules Committees, which are based on
existing Rule 26.1. For example, the bankruptcy provision requires disclosure when a party
"directly or indirectly" owns 10 percent or more of "any class" of a publicly or privately held
corporation's "equity interests." Members of the Appellate Rules Committee expressed several
concerns about the provision approved by the Bankruptcy Rules Committee, objecting both to its
substance and to its ambiguity.

Rule 27. Motions
(a) In General.
(1) Application for Relief. An application for an order or other relief is made by motion
unless these rules prescribe another form. A motion must be in writing unless the court permits
otherwise.
(2) Contents of a Motion.
(A) Grounds and Relief Sought. A motion must state with particularity the grounds for the
motion, the relief sought, and the legal argument necessary to support it.
(B) Accompanying Documents.
(i) Any affidavit or other paper necessary to support a motion must be served and filed with
the motion.
(ii) An affidavit must contain only factual information, not legal argument.
(iii) A motion seeking substantive relief must include a copy of the trial court's opinion or
agency's decision as a separate exhibit.
(C) Documents Barred or Not Required.
(i) A separate brief supporting or responding to a motion must not be filed.
(ii) A notice of motion is not required.
(iii) A proposed order is not required.

(3) Response.
(A) Time to file. Any party may file a response to a motion; Rule 27(a)(2) governs its
contents. The response must be filed within 10 days after service of the motion unless the court
shortens or extends the time. A motion authorized by Rules 8, 9, 18, or 41 may be granted before
the 10-day period runs only if the court gives reasonable notice to the parties that it intends to act
sooner.
(B) Request for Affirmative Relief. A response may include a motion for affirmative relief.
The time to respond to the new motion, and to reply to that response, are governed by Rule
27(a)(3)(A) and (a)(4). The title of the response must alert the court to the request for relief.
(4) Reply to Response. Any reply to a response must be filed within 7 days after service of
the response. A reply must not present matters that do not relate to the response.
(b) Disposition of a Motion for a Procedural Order. The court may act on a motion for a
procedural order—including a motion under Rule 26(b)—at any time without awaiting a response,
and may, by rule or by order in a particular case, authorize its clerk to act on specified types of
procedural motions. A party adversely affected by the court's, or the clerk's, action may file a
motion to reconsider, vacate, or modify that action. Timely opposition filed after the motion is
granted in whole or in part does not constitute a request to reconsider, vacate, or modify the
disposition; a motion requesting that relief must be filed.
(c) Power of a Single Judge to Entertain a Motion. A circuit judge may act alone on any
motion, but may not dismiss or otherwise determine an appeal or other proceeding. A court of
appeals may provide by rule or by order in a particular case that only the court may act on any
motion or class of motions. The court may review the action of a single judge.
(d) Form of Papers; Page Limits; and Number of Copies.
(1) Format.
(A) Reproduction. A motion, response, or reply may be reproduced by any process that
yields a clear black image on light paper. The paper must be opaque and unglazed. Only one side
of the paper may be used.
(B) Cover. A cover is not required, but there must be a caption that includes the case
number, the name of the court, the title of the case, and a brief descriptive title indicating the
purpose of the motion and identifying the party or parties for whom it is filed. If a cover is used, it
must be white.
(C) Binding. The document must be bound in any manner that is secure, does not obscure
the text, and permits the document to lie reasonably flat when open.
(D) Paper Size, Line Spacing, and Margins. The document must be on 8½ by 11 inch
paper. The text must be double-spaced, but quotations more than two lines long may be indented
and single-spaced. Headings and footnotes may be single-spaced. Margins must be at least one
inch on all four sides. Page numbers may be placed in the margins, but no text may appear there.
(E) Typeface and Type Styles. The document must comply with the typeface requirements
of Rule 32(a)(5) and the type-style requirements of Rule 32(a)(6).
(2) Page Limits. A motion or a response to a motion must not exceed 20 pages, exclusive of
the corporate disclosure statement and accompanying documents authorized by Rule 27(a)(2)(B),
unless the court permits or directs otherwise. A reply to a response must not exceed 10 pages.

(3) Number of Copies. An original and 3 copies must be filed unless the court requires a
different number by local rule or by order in a particular case.
(e) Oral Argument. A motion will be decided without oral argument unless the court orders
otherwise.

Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules—1967
Subdivisions (a) and (b). Many motions seek relief of a sort which is ordinarily unopposed
or which is granted as of course. The provision of subdivision (a) which permits any party to file a
response in opposition to a motion within 7 days after its service upon him assumes that the motion
is one of substance which ought not be acted upon without affording affected parties an
opportunity to reply. A motion to dismiss or otherwise determine an appeal is clearly such a
motion. Motions authorized by Rules 8, 9, 18 and 41 are likewise motions of substance; but in the
nature of the relief sought, to afford an adversary an automatic delay of at least 7 days is
undesirable, thus such motions may be acted upon after notice which is reasonable under the
circumstances.
The term "motions for procedural orders" is used in subdivision (b) to describe motions
which do not substantially affect the rights of the parties or the ultimate disposition of the appeal.
To prevent delay in the disposition of such motions, subdivision (b) provides that they may be
acted upon immediately without awaiting a response, subject to the right of any party who is
adversely affected by the action to seek reconsideration.
Subdivision (c). Within the general consideration of procedure on motions is the problem
of the power of a single circuit judge. Certain powers are granted to a single judge of a court of
appeals by statute. Thus, under 28 U.S.C. §2101(f) a single judge may stay execution and
enforcement of a judgment to enable a party aggrieved to obtain certiorari; under 28 U.S.C. §2251
a judge before whom a habeas corpus proceeding involving a person detained by state authority is
pending may stay any proceeding against the person; under 28 U.S.C. §2253 a single judge may
issue a certificate of probable cause. In addition, certain of these rules expressly grant power to a
single judge. See Rules 8, 9 and 18.
This subdivision empowers a single circuit judge to act upon virtually all requests for
intermediate relief which may be made during the course of an appeal or other proceeding. By its
terms he may entertain and act upon any motion other than a motion to dismiss or otherwise
determine an appeal or other proceeding. But the relief sought must be "relief which under these
rules may properly be sought by motion."
Examples of the power conferred on a single judge by this subdivision are: to extend the
time for transmitting the record or docketing the appeal (Rules 11 and 12); to permit intervention
in agency cases (Rule 15), or substitution in any case (Rule 43); to permit an appeal in forma
pauperis (Rule 24); to enlarge any time period fixed by the rules other than that for initiating a
proceeding in the court of appeals (Rule 26(b)); to permit the filing of a brief by amicus curiae
(Rule 29); to authorize the filing of a deferred appendix (Rule 30(c)), or dispense with the
requirement of an appendix in a specific case (Rule 30(f)), or permit carbon copies of briefs or
appendices to be used (Rule 32(a)); to permit the filing of additional briefs (Rule 28(c)), or the
filing of briefs of extraordinary length (Rule 28(g)); to postpone oral argument (Rule 34(a)), or

grant additional time therefor (Rule 34(b)).
Certain rules require that application for the relief or orders which they authorize be made
by petition. Since relief under those rules may not properly be sought by motion, a single judge
may not entertain requests for such relief. Thus a single judge may not act upon requests for
permission to appeal (see Rules 5 and 6); or for mandamus or other extraordinary writs (see Rule
21), other than for stays or injunctions pendente lite, authority to grant which is "expressly
conferred by these rules" on a single judge under certain circumstances (see Rules 8 and 18); or
upon petitions for rehearing (see Rule 40).
A court of appeals may by order or rule abridge the power of a single judge if it is of the
view that a motion or a class of motions should be disposed of by a panel. Exercise of any power
granted a single judge is discretionary with the judge. The final sentence in this subdivision makes
the disposition of any matter by a single judge subject to review by the court.
Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules—1979 Amendment
The proposed amendment would give sanction to local rules in a number of circuits
permitting the clerk to dispose of specified types of procedural motions.
Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules—1989 Amendment
The amendment is technical. No substantive change is intended.
Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules—1994 Amendment
Subdivision (d). The amendment makes it clear that a court may require a different number
of copies either by rule or by order in an individual case. The number of copies of any document
that a court of appeals needs varies depending upon the way in which the court conducts business.
The internal operation of the courts of appeals necessarily varies from circuit to circuit because of
differences in the number of judges, the geographic area included within the circuit, and other such
factors. Uniformity could be achieved only by setting the number of copies artificially high so that
parties in all circuits file enough copies to satisfy the needs of the court requiring the greatest
number. Rather than do that, the Committee decided to make it clear that local rules may require a
greater or lesser number of copies and that, if the circumstances of a particular case indicate the
need for a different number of copies in that case, the court may so order.
Committee Notes on Rules—1998 Amendment
In addition to amending Rule 27 to conform to uniform drafting standards, several
substantive amendments are made. The Advisory Committee had been working on substantive
amendments to Rule 27 just prior to completion of this larger project.
Subdivision (a). Paragraph (1) retains the language of the existing rule indicating that an
application for an order or other relief is made by filing a motion unless another form is required by
some other provision in the rules.
Paragraph (1) also states that a motion must be in writing unless the court permits
otherwise. The writing requirement has been implicit in the rule; the Advisory Committee decided
to make it explicit. There are, however, instances in which a court may permit oral motions.
Perhaps the most common such instance would be a motion made during oral argument in the

presence of opposing counsel; for example, a request for permission to submit a supplemental brief
on an issue raised by the court for the first time at oral argument. Rather than limit oral motions to
those made during oral argument or, conversely, assume the propriety of making even extremely
complex motions orally during argument, the Advisory Committee decided that it is better to leave
the determination of the propriety of an oral motion to the court's discretion. The provision does
not disturb the practice in those circuits that permit certain procedural motions, such as a motion
for extension of time for filing a brief, to be made by telephone and ruled upon by the clerk.
Paragraph (2) outlines the contents of a motion. It begins with the general requirement
from the current rule that a motion must state with particularity the grounds supporting it and the
relief requested. It adds a requirement that all legal arguments should be presented in the body of
the motion; a separate brief or memorandum supporting or responding to a motion must not be
filed. The Supreme Court uses this single document approach. Sup. Ct. R. 21.1. In furtherance of
the requirement that all legal argument must be contained in the body of the motion, paragraph (2)
also states that an affidavit that is attached to a motion should contain only factual information and
not legal argument.
Paragraph (2) further states that whenever a motion requests substantive relief, a copy of
the trial court's opinion or agency's decision must be attached.
Although it is common to present a district court with a proposed order along with the
motion requesting relief, that is not the practice in the courts of appeals. A proposed order is not
required and is not expected or desired. Nor is a notice of motion required.
Paragraph (3) retains the provisions of the current rule concerning the filing of a response
to a motion except that the time for responding has been expanded to 10 days rather than 7 days.
Because the time periods in the rule apply to a substantive motion as well as a procedural motion,
the longer time period may help reduce the number of motions for extension of time, or at least
provide a more realistic time frame within which to make and dispose of such a motion.
A party filing a response in opposition to a motion may also request affirmative relief. It is
the Advisory Committee's judgment that it is permissible to combine the response and the new
motion in the same document. Indeed, because there may be substantial overlap of arguments in
the response and in the request for affirmative relief, a combined document may be preferable. If a
request for relief is combined with a response, the caption of the document must alert the court to
the request for relief. The time for a response to such a new request and for reply to that response
are governed by the general rules regulating responses and replies.
Paragraph (4) is new. Two circuits currently have rules authorizing a reply. As a general
matter, a reply should not reargue propositions presented in the motion or present matters that do
not relate to the response. Sometimes matters relevant to the motion arise after the motion is filed;
treatment of such matters in the reply is appropriate even though strictly speaking it may not relate
to the response.
Subdivision (b). The material in this subdivision remains substantively unchanged except
to clarify that one may file a motion for reconsideration, etc., of a disposition by either the court or
the clerk. A new sentence is added indicating that if a motion is granted in whole or in part before
the filing of timely opposition to the motion, the filing of the opposition is not treated as a request
for reconsideration, etc. A party wishing to have the court reconsider, vacate, or modify the
disposition must file a new motion that addresses the order granting the motion.
Although the rule does not require a court to do so, it would be helpful if, whenever a
motion is disposed of before receipt of any response from the opposing party, the ruling indicates
that it was issued without awaiting a response. Such a statement will aid the opposing party in

deciding whether to request reconsideration. The opposing party may have mailed a response
about the time of the ruling and be uncertain whether the court has considered it.
Subdivision (c). The changes in this subdivision are stylistic only. No substantive changes
are intended.
Subdivision (d). This subdivision has been substantially revised.
The format requirements have been moved from Rule 32(b) to paragraph (1) of this
subdivision. No cover is required, but a caption is needed as well as a descriptive title indicating
the purpose of the motion and identifying the party or parties for whom it is filed. Spiral binding or
secure stapling at the upper left-hand corner satisfies the binding requirement. But they are not
intended to be the exclusive methods of binding.
Paragraph (2) establishes page limits; twenty pages for a motion or a response, and ten
pages for a reply. Three circuits have established page limits by local rule. This rule does not
establish special page limits for those instances in which a party combines a response to a motion
with a new request for affirmative relief. Because a combined document most often will be used
when there is substantial overlap in the argument in opposition to the motion and in the argument
for the affirmative relief, twenty pages may be sufficient in most instances. If it is not, the party
may request additional pages. If ten pages is insufficient for the original movant to both reply to
the response, and respond to the new request for affirmative relief, two separate documents may be
used or a request for additional pages may be made.
The changes in paragraph (4) are stylistic only. No substantive changes are intended.
Subdivision (e). This new provision makes it clear that there is no right to oral argument on
a motion. Seven circuits have local rules stating that oral argument of motions will not be held
unless the court orders it.
Committee Notes on Rules—2002 Amendment
Subdivision (a)(3)(A). Subdivision (a)(3)(A) presently requires that a response to a motion
be filed within 10 days after service of the motion. Intermediate Saturdays, Sundays, and legal
holidays are counted in computing that 10-day deadline, which means that, except when the
10-day deadline ends on a weekend or legal holiday, parties generally must respond to motions
within 10 actual days.
Fed. R. App. P. 26(a)(2) has been amended to provide that, in computing any period of
time, a litigant should "[e]xclude intermediate Saturdays, Sundays, and legal holidays when the
period is less than 11 days, unless stated in calendar days." This change in the method of
computing deadlines means that 10-day deadlines (such as that in subdivision (a)(3)(A)) have been
lengthened as a practical matter. Under the new computation method, parties would never have
less than 14 actual days to respond to motions, and legal holidays could extend that period to as
much as 18 days.
Permitting parties to take two weeks or more to respond to motions would introduce
significant and unwarranted delay into appellate proceedings. For that reason, the 10-day deadline
in subdivision (a)(3)(A) has been reduced to 8 days. This change will, as a practical matter, ensure
that every party will have at least 10 actual days—but, in the absence of a legal holiday, no more
than 12 actual days—to respond to motions. The court continues to have discretion to shorten or
extend that time in appropriate cases.
Changes Made After Publication and Comments. In response to the objections of
commentators, the time to respond to a motion was increased from the proposed 7 days to 8 days.
No other changes were made to the text of the proposed amendment or to the Committee Note.

Subdivision (a)(4). Subdivision (a)(4) presently requires that a reply to a response to a
motion be filed within 7 days after service of the response. Intermediate Saturdays, Sundays, and
legal holidays are counted in computing that 7-day deadline, which means that, except when the
7-day deadline ends on a weekend or legal holiday, parties generally must reply to responses to
motions within one week.
Fed. R. App. P. 26(a)(2) has been amended to provide that, in computing any period of
time, a litigant should "[e]xclude intermediate Saturdays, Sundays, and legal holidays when the
period is less than 11 days, unless stated in calendar days." This change in the method of
computing deadlines means that 7-day deadlines (such as that in subdivision (a)(4)) have been
lengthened as a practical matter. Under the new computation method, parties would never have
less than 9 actual days to reply to responses to motions, and legal holidays could extend that period
to as much as 13 days.
Permitting parties to take 9 or more days to reply to a response to a motion would introduce
significant and unwarranted delay into appellate proceedings. For that reason, the 7-day deadline
in subdivision (a)(4) has been reduced to 5 days. This change will, as a practical matter, ensure that
every party will have 7 actual days to file replies to responses to motions (in the absence of a legal
holiday).
Changes Made After Publication and Comments. No changes were made to the text of the
proposed amendment or to the Committee Note.
Subdivision (d)(1)(B). A cover is not required on motions, responses to motions, or replies
to responses to motions. However, Rule 27(d)(1)(B) has been amended to provide that if a cover is
nevertheless used on such a paper, the cover must be white. The amendment is intended to promote
uniformity in federal appellate practice.
Changes Made After Publication and Comments. No changes were made to the text of the
proposed amendment or to the Committee Note.
Committee Notes on Rules—2005 Amendment
Subdivision (d)(1)(E). A new subdivision (E) has been added to Rule 27(d)(1) to provide
that a motion, a response to a motion, and a reply to a response to a motion must comply with the
typeface requirements of Rule 32(a)(5) and the type-style requirements of Rule 32(a)(6). The
purpose of the amendment is to promote uniformity in federal appellate practice and to prevent the
abuses that might occur if no restrictions were placed on the size of typeface used in motion
papers.
Changes Made After Publication and Comments. No changes were made to the text of the
proposed amendment or to the Committee Note.
Committee Notes on Rules—2009 Amendment
Subdivision (a)(3)(A). Subdivision (a)(3)(A) formerly required that a response to a motion
be filed "within 8 days after service of the motion unless the court shortens or extends the time."
Prior to the 2002 amendments to Rule 27, subdivision (a)(3)(A) set this period at 10 days rather
than 8 days. The period was changed in 2002 to reflect the change from a time-computation
approach that counted intermediate weekends and holidays to an approach that did not. (Prior to
the 2002 amendments, intermediate weekends and holidays were excluded only if the period was
less than 7 days; after those amendments, such days were excluded if the period was less than 11
days.) Under current Rule 26(a), intermediate weekends and holidays are counted for all periods.

Accordingly, revised subdivision (a)(3)(A) once again sets the period at 10 days.
Subdivision (a)(4). Subdivision (a)(4) formerly required that a reply to a response be filed
"within 5 days after service of the response." Prior to the 2002 amendments, this period was set at
7 days; in 2002 it was shortened in the light of the 2002 change in time-computation approach
(discussed above). Under current Rule 26(a), intermediate weekends and holidays are counted for
all periods, and revised subdivision (a)(4) once again sets the period at 7 days.

Rule 28. Briefs
(a) Appellant's Brief. The appellant's brief must contain, under appropriate headings and in
the order indicated:
(1) a corporate disclosure statement if required by Rule 26.1;
(2) a table of contents, with page references;
(3) a table of authorities—cases (alphabetically arranged), statutes, and other
authorities—with references to the pages of the brief where they are cited;
(4) a jurisdictional statement, including:
(A) the basis for the district court's or agency's subject-matter jurisdiction, with citations to
applicable statutory provisions and stating relevant facts establishing jurisdiction;
(B) the basis for the court of appeals' jurisdiction, with citations to applicable statutory
provisions and stating relevant facts establishing jurisdiction;
(C) the filing dates establishing the timeliness of the appeal or petition for review; and
(D) an assertion that the appeal is from a final order or judgment that disposes of all parties'
claims, or information establishing the court of appeals' jurisdiction on some other basis;
(5) a statement of the issues presented for review;
(6) a concise statement of the case setting out the facts relevant to the issues submitted for
review, describing the relevant procedural history, and identifying the rulings presented for
review, with appropriate references to the record (see Rule 28(e));
(7) a summary of the argument, which must contain a succinct, clear, and accurate
statement of the arguments made in the body of the brief, and which must not merely repeat the
argument headings;
(8) the argument, which must contain:
(A) appellant's contentions and the reasons for them, with citations to the authorities and
parts of the record on which the appellant relies; and
(B) for each issue, a concise statement of the applicable standard of review (which may
appear in the discussion of the issue or under a separate heading placed before the discussion of the
issues);
(9) a short conclusion stating the precise relief sought; and
(10) the certificate of compliance, if required by Rule 32(a)(7).
(b) Appellee's Brief. The appellee's brief must conform to the requirements of Rule
28(a)(1)–(8) and (10), except that none of the following need appear unless the appellee is
dissatisfied with the appellant's statement:
(1) the jurisdictional statement;
(2) the statement of the issues;

(3) the statement of the case; and
(4) the statement of the standard of review.
(c) Reply Brief. The appellant may file a brief in reply to the appellee's brief. Unless the
court permits, no further briefs may be filed. A reply brief must contain a table of contents, with
page references, and a table of authorities—cases (alphabetically arranged), statutes, and other
authorities—with references to the pages of the reply brief where they are cited.
(d) References to Parties. In briefs and at oral argument, counsel should minimize use of
the terms "appellant" and "appellee." To make briefs clear, counsel should use the parties' actual
names or the designations used in the lower court or agency proceeding, or such descriptive terms
as "the employee," "the injured person," "the taxpayer," "the ship," "the stevedore."
(e) References to the Record. References to the parts of the record contained in the
appendix filed with the appellant's brief must be to the pages of the appendix. If the appendix is
prepared after the briefs are filed, a party referring to the record must follow one of the methods
detailed in Rule 30(c). If the original record is used under Rule 30(f) and is not consecutively
paginated, or if the brief refers to an unreproduced part of the record, any reference must be to the
page of the original document. For example:
• Answer p. 7;
• Motion for Judgment p. 2;
• Transcript p. 231.
Only clear abbreviations may be used. A party referring to evidence whose admissibility is
in controversy must cite the pages of the appendix or of the transcript at which the evidence was
identified, offered, and received or rejected.
(f) Reproduction of Statutes, Rules, Regulations, etc. If the court's determination of the
issues presented requires the study of statutes, rules, regulations, etc., the relevant parts must be set
out in the brief or in an addendum at the end, or may be supplied to the court in pamphlet form.
(g) [Reserved]
(h) [Reserved]
(i) Briefs in a Case Involving Multiple Appellants or Appellees. In a case involving more
than one appellant or appellee, including consolidated cases, any number of appellants or appellees
may join in a brief, and any party may adopt by reference a part of another's brief. Parties may also
join in reply briefs.
(j) Citation of Supplemental Authorities. If pertinent and significant authorities come to a
party's attention after the party's brief has been filed—or after oral argument but before
decision—a party may promptly advise the circuit clerk by letter, with a copy to all other parties,
setting forth the citations. The letter must state the reasons for the supplemental citations, referring
either to the page of the brief or to a point argued orally. The body of the letter must not exceed 350
words. Any response must be made promptly and must be similarly limited.
(As amended Apr. 30, 1979, eff. Aug. 1, 1979; Mar. 10, 1986, eff. July 1, 1986; Apr. 25,

Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules—1967
This rule is based upon Supreme Court Rule 40. For variations in present circuit rules on

briefs see 2d Cir. Rule 17, 3d Cir. Rule 24, 5th Cir. Rule 24, and 7th Cir. Rule 17. All circuits now
limit the number of pages of briefs, a majority limiting the brief to 50 pages of standard
typographic printing. Fifty pages of standard typographic printing is the approximate equivalent of
70 pages of typewritten text, given the page sizes required by Rule 32 and the requirement set out
there that text produced by a method other than standard typographic must be double spaced.
Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules—1979 Amendment
The proposed amendment eliminates the distinction appearing in the present rule between
the permissible length in pages of printed and typewritten briefs, investigation of the matter having
disclosed that the number of words on the printed page is little if any larger than the number on a
page typed in standard elite type.
The provision is made subject to local rule to permit the court of appeals to require that
typewritten briefs be typed in larger type and permit a correspondingly larger number of pages.
Subdivision (j). Proposed new Rule 28(j) makes provision for calling the court's attention
to authorities that come to the party's attention after the brief has been filed. It is patterned after the
practice under local rule in some of the circuits.
Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules—1986 Amendment
While Rule 28(g) can be read as requiring that tables of authorities be included in a reply
brief, such tables are often not included. Their absence impedes efficient use of the reply brief to
ascertain the appellant's response to a particular argument of the appellee or to the appellee's use of
a particular authority. The amendment to Rule 28(c) is intended to make it clear that such tables are
required in reply briefs.
The amendment to Rule 28(j) is technical. No substantive change is intended.
Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules—1989 Amendment
The amendment provides that the corporate disclosure statement required by new rule 26.1
shall be treated similarly to tables of contents and tables of citations and shall not be counted for
purposes of the number of pages allowed in a brief.
Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules—1991 Amendment
Subdivision (a). The amendment adds a new subparagraph (2) that requires an appellant to
include a specific jurisdictional statement in the appellant's brief to aid the court of appeals in
determining whether it has both federal subject matter and appellate jurisdiction.
Subdivision (b). The amendment requires the appellee to include a jurisdictional statement
in the appellee's brief except that the appellee need not include the statement if the appellee is
satisfied with the appellant's jurisdictional statement.
Subdivision (h). The amendment provides that when more than one party appeals from a
judgment or order, the party filing the first appeal is normally treated as the appellant for purposes
of this rule and Rules 30 and 31. The party who first files an appeal usually is the principal
appellant and should be treated as such. Parties who file a notice of appeal after the first notice
often bring protective appeals and they should be treated as cross appellants. Local rules in the
Fourth and Federal Circuits now take that approach. If notices of appeal are filed on the same day,

the rule follows the old approach of treating the plaintiff below as the appellant. For purposes of
this rule, in criminal cases "the plaintiff" means the United States. In those instances where the
designations provided by the rule are inappropriate, they may be altered by agreement of the
parties or by an order of the court.
Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules—1993 Amendment
Note to paragraph (a)(5). The amendment requires an appellant's brief to state the standard
of review applicable to each issue on appeal. Five circuits currently require these statements.
Experience in those circuits indicates that requiring a statement of the standard of review generally
results in arguments that are properly shaped in light of the standard.
Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules—1994 Amendment
Subdivision (a). The amendment adds a requirement that an appellant's brief contain a
summary of the argument. A number of circuits have local rules requiring a summary and the
courts report that they find the summary useful. See, D.C. Cir. R. 11(a)(5); 5th Cir. R. 28.2.2; 8th
Cir. R. 28A(i)(6); 11th Cir. R. 28–2(i); and Fed. Cir. R. 28.
Subdivision (b). The amendment adds a requirement that an appellee's brief contain a
summary of the argument.
Subdivision (g). The amendment adds proof of service to the list of items in a brief that do
not count for purposes of the page limitation. The concurrent amendment to Rule 25(d) requires a
certificate of service to list the addresses to which a paper was mailed or at which it was delivered.
When a number of parties must be served, the listing of addresses may run to several pages and
those pages should not count for purposes of the page limitation.
Committee Notes on Rules—1998 Amendment
The language and organization of the rule are amended to make the rule more easily
understood. In additional to changes made to improve the understanding, the Advisory Committee
has changed language to make style and terminology consistent throughout the appellate rules.
These changes are intended to be stylistic only.
Several substantive changes are made in this rule, however. Most of them are necessary to
conform Rule 28 with changes recommended in Rule 32.
Subdivision (a). The current rule requires a brief to include a statement of the case which
includes a description of the nature of the case, the course of proceedings, the disposition of the
case—all of which might be described as the procedural history—as well as a statement of the
facts. The amendments separate this into two statements: one procedural, called the statement of
the case; and one factual, called the statement of the facts. The Advisory Committee believes that
the separation will be helpful to the judges. The table of contents and table of authorities have also
been separated into two distinct items.
An additional amendment of subdivision (a) is made to conform it with an amendment
being made to Rule 32. Rule 32(a)(7) generally requires a brief to include a certificate of
compliance with type-volume limitations contained in that rule. (No certificate is required if a brief
does not exceed 30 pages, or 15 pages for a reply brief.) Rule 28(a) is amended to include that
certificate in the list of items that must be included in a brief whenever it is required by Rule 32.
Subdivision (g). The amendments delete subdivision (g) that limited a principal brief to 50

pages and a reply brief to 25 pages. The length limitations have been moved to Rule 32. Rule 32
deals generally with the format for a brief or appendix.
Subdivision (h). The amendment requires an appellee's brief to comply with Rule 28(a)(1)
through (11) with regard to a cross-appeal. The addition of separate paragraphs requiring a
corporate disclosure statement, table of authorities, statement of facts, and certificate of
compliance increased the relevant paragraphs of subdivision (a) from (7) to (11). The other
changes are stylistic; no substantive changes are intended.
Committee Notes on Rules—2002 Amendment
Subdivision (j). In the past, Rule 28(j) has required parties to describe supplemental
authorities "without argument." Enforcement of this restriction has been lax, in part because of the
difficulty of distinguishing "state[ment] . . . [of] the reasons for the supplemental citations," which
is required, from "argument" about the supplemental citations, which is forbidden.
As amended, Rule 28(j) continues to require parties to state the reasons for supplemental
citations, with reference to the part of a brief or oral argument to which the supplemental citations
pertain. But Rule 28(j) no longer forbids "argument." Rather, Rule 28(j) permits parties to decide
for themselves what they wish to say about supplemental authorities. The only restriction upon
parties is that the body of a Rule 28(j) letter—that is, the part of the letter that begins with the first
word after the salutation and ends with the last word before the complimentary close—cannot
exceed 350 words. All words found in footnotes will count toward the 350-word limit.
Changes Made After Publication and Comments. No changes were made to the text of the
proposed amendment or to the Committee Note, except that the word limit was increased from 250
to 350 in response to the complaint of some commentators that parties would have difficulty
bringing multiple supplemental authorities to the attention of the court in one 250-word letter.
Committee Notes on Rules—2005 Amendment
Subdivision (c). Subdivision (c) has been amended to delete a sentence that authorized an
appellee who had cross-appealed to file a brief in reply to the appellant's response. All rules
regarding briefing in cases involving cross-appeals have been consolidated into new Rule 28.1.
Subdivision (h). Subdivision (h)—regarding briefing in cases involving
cross-appeals—has been deleted. All rules regarding such briefing have been consolidated into
new Rule 28.1.
Committee Notes on Rules—2013 Amendment
Subdivision (a). Rule 28(a) is amended to remove the requirement of separate statements of
the case and of the facts. Currently Rule 28(a)(6) provides that the statement of the case must
"indicat[e] the nature of the case, the course of proceedings, and the disposition below," and it
precedes Rule 28(a)(7)'s requirement that the brief include "a statement of facts." Experience has
shown that these requirements have generated confusion and redundancy. Rule 28(a) is amended
to consolidate subdivisions (a)(6) and (a)(7) into a new subdivision (a)(6) that provides for one
"statement," much like Supreme Court Rule 24.1(g) (which requires "[a] concise statement of the
case, setting out the facts material to the consideration of the questions presented, with appropriate
references to the joint appendix. . . ."). This permits but does not require the lawyer to present the
factual and procedural history chronologically. Conforming changes are made by renumbering

Rules 28(a)(8) through (11) as Rules 28(a)(7) through (10).
The statement of the case should describe the nature of the case, which includes (1) the
facts relevant to the issues submitted for review; (2) those aspects of the case's procedural history
that are necessary to understand the posture of the appeal or are relevant to the issues submitted for
review; and (3) the rulings presented for review. The statement should be concise, and can include
subheadings, particularly for the purpose of highlighting the rulings presented for review.
Subdivision (b). Rule 28(b) is amended to accord with the amendment to Rule 28(a).
Current Rules 28(b)(3) and (4) are consolidated into new Rule 28(b)(3), which refers to "the
statement of the case." Rule 28(b)(5) becomes Rule 28(b)(4). And Rule 28(b)'s reference to certain
subdivisions of Rule 28(a) is updated to reflect the renumbering of those subdivisions.
Changes Made After Publication and Comment. After publication and comment, the
Committee made one change to the text of the proposal and two changes to the Committee Note.
During the comment period, concerns were raised that the deletion of current Rule
28(a)(6)'s reference to "the nature of the case, the course of proceedings, and the disposition
below" might lead readers to conclude that those items may no longer be included in the statement
of the case. The Committee rejected that concern with respect to the "nature of the case" and the
"disposition below," because the Rule as published would naturally be read to permit continued
inclusion of those items in the statement of the case. The Committee adhered to its view that the
deletion of "course of proceedings" is useful because that phrase tends to elicit unnecessary detail;
but to address the commenters' concerns, the Committee added, to the revised Rule text, the phrase
"describing the relevant procedural history."
The Committee augmented the Note to Rule 28(a) in two respects. It added a reference to
Supreme Court Rule 24.1(g), upon which the proposed revision to Rule 28(a)(6) is modeled. And
it added—as a second paragraph in the Note—a discussion of the contents of the statement of the
case.

Rule 28.1. Cross-Appeals
(a) Applicability. This rule applies to a case in which a cross-appeal is filed. Rules 28(a)–
(c), 31(a)(1), 32(a)(2), and 32(a)(7)(A)–(B) do not apply to such a case, except as otherwise
provided in this rule.
(b) Designation of Appellant. The party who files a notice of appeal first is the appellant for
the purposes of this rule and Rules 30 and 34. If notices are filed on the same day, the plaintiff in
the proceeding below is the appellant. These designations may be modified by the parties'
agreement or by court order.
(c) Briefs. In a case involving a cross-appeal:
(1) Appellant's Principal Brief. The appellant must file a principal brief in the appeal. That
brief must comply with Rule 28(a).
(2) Appellee's Principal and Response Brief. The appellee must file a principal brief in the
cross-appeal and must, in the same brief, respond to the principal brief in the appeal. That
appellee's brief must comply with Rule 28(a), except that the brief need not include a statement of
the case unless the appellee is dissatisfied with the appellant's statement.
(3) Appellant's Response and Reply Brief. The appellant must file a brief that responds to
the principal brief in the cross-appeal and may, in the same brief, reply to the response in the
appeal. That brief must comply with Rule 28(a)(2)–(8) and (10), except that none of the following
need appear unless the appellant is dissatisfied with the appellee's statement in the cross-appeal:

(A) the jurisdictional statement;
(B) the statement of the issues;
(C) the statement of the case; and
(D) the statement of the standard of review.
(4) Appellee's Reply Brief. The appellee may file a brief in reply to the response in the
cross-appeal. That brief must comply with Rule 28(a)(2)–(3) and (10) and must be limited to the
issues presented by the cross-appeal.
(5) No Further Briefs. Unless the court permits, no further briefs may be filed in a case
involving a cross-appeal.
(d) Cover. Except for filings by unrepresented parties, the cover of the appellant's principal
brief must be blue; the appellee's principal and response brief, red; the appellant's response and
reply brief, yellow; the appellee's reply brief, gray; an intervenor's or amicus curiae's brief, green;
and any supplemental brief, tan. The front cover of a brief must contain the information required
by Rule 32(a)(2).
(e) Length.
(1) Page Limitation. Unless it complies with Rule 28.1(e)(2) and (3), the appellant's
principal brief must not exceed 30 pages; the appellee's principal and response brief, 35 pages; the
appellant's response and reply brief, 30 pages; and the appellee's reply brief, 15 pages.
(2) Type-Volume Limitation.
(A) The appellant's principal brief or the appellant's response and reply brief is acceptable
if:
(i) it contains no more than 14,000 words; or
(ii) it uses a monospaced face and contains no more than 1,300 lines of text.
(B) The appellee's principal and response brief is acceptable if:
(i) it contains no more than 16,500 words; or
(ii) it uses a monospaced face and contains no more than 1,500 lines of text.
(C) The appellee's reply brief is acceptable if it contains no more than half of the type
volume specified in Rule 28.1(e)(2)(A).
(3) Certificate of Compliance. A brief submitted under Rule 28.1(e)(2) must comply with
Rule 32(a)(7)(C).
(f) Time to Serve and File a Brief. Briefs must be served and filed as follows:
(1) the appellant's principal brief, within 40 days after the record is filed;
(2) the appellee's principal and response brief, within 30 days after the appellant's principal
brief is served;
(3) the appellant's response and reply brief, within 30 days after the appellee's principal and
response brief is served; and
(4) the appellee's reply brief, within 14 days after the appellant's response and reply brief is
served, but at least 7 days before argument unless the court, for good cause, allows a later filing.

Committee Notes on Rules—2005

The Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure have said very little about briefing in cases
involving cross-appeals. This vacuum has frustrated judges, attorneys, and parties who have
sought guidance in the rules. More importantly, this vacuum has been filled by conflicting local
rules regarding such matters as the number and length of briefs, the colors of the covers of briefs,
and the deadlines for serving and filing briefs. These local rules have created a hardship for
attorneys who practice in more than one circuit.
New Rule 28.1 provides a comprehensive set of rules governing briefing in cases involving
cross-appeals. The few existing provisions regarding briefing in such cases have been moved into
new Rule 28.1, and several new provisions have been added to fill the gaps in the existing rules.
The new provisions reflect the practices of the large majority of circuits and, to a significant extent,
the new provisions have been patterned after the requirements imposed by Rules 28, 31, and 32 on
briefs filed in cases that do not involve cross-appeals.
Subdivision (a). Subdivision (a) makes clear that, in a case involving a cross-appeal,
briefing is governed by new Rule 28.1, and not by Rules 28(a), 28(b), 28(c), 31(a)(1), 32(a)(2),
32(a)(7)(A), and 32(a)(7)(B), except to the extent that Rule 28.1 specifically incorporates those
rules by reference.
Subdivision (b). Subdivision (b) defines who is the "appellant" and who is the "appellee" in
a case involving a cross-appeal. Subdivision (b) is taken directly from former Rule 28(h), except
that subdivision (b) refers to a party being designated as an appellant "for the purposes of this rule
and Rules 30 and 34," whereas former Rule 28(h) also referred to Rule 31. Because the matter
addressed by Rule 31(a)(1)—the time to serve and file briefs—is now addressed directly in new
Rule 28.1(f), the cross-reference to Rule 31 is no longer necessary. In Rule 31 and in all rules other
than Rules 28.1, 30, and 34, references to an "appellant" refer both to the appellant in an appeal and
to the cross-appellant in a cross-appeal, and references to an "appellee" refer both to the appellee in
an appeal and to the cross-appellee in a cross-appeal. Cf. Rule 31(c).
Subdivision (c). Subdivision (c) provides for the filing of four briefs in a case involving a
cross-appeal. This reflects the practice of every circuit except the Seventh. See 7th Cir. R.
28(d)(1)(a).
The first brief is the "appellant's principal brief." That brief—like the appellant's principal
brief in a case that does not involve a cross-appeal—must comply with Rule 28(a).
The second brief is the "appellee's principal and response brief." Because this brief serves
as the appellee's principal brief on the merits of the cross-appeal, as well as the appellee's response
brief on the merits of the appeal, it must also comply with Rule 28(a), with the limited exceptions
noted in the text of the rule.
The third brief is the "appellant's response and reply brief." Like a response brief in a case
that does not involve a cross-appeal—that is, a response brief that does not also serve as a principal
brief on the merits of a cross-appeal—the appellant's response and reply brief must comply with
Rule 28(a)(2)–(9) and (11), with the exceptions noted in the text of the rule. See Rule 28(b). The
one difference between the appellant's response and reply brief, on the one hand, and a response
brief filed in a case that does not involve a cross-appeal, on the other, is that the latter must include
a corporate disclosure statement. See Rule 28(a)(1) and (b). An appellant filing a response and
reply brief in a case involving a cross-appeal has already filed a corporate disclosure statement
with its principal brief on the merits of the appeal.
The fourth brief is the "appellee's reply brief." Like a reply brief in a case that does not
involve a cross-appeal, it must comply with Rule 28(c), which essentially restates the requirements

of Rule 28(a)(2)–(3) and (11). (Rather than restating the requirements of Rule 28(a)(2)–(3) and
(11), as Rule 28(c) does, Rule 28.1(c)(4) includes a direct cross-reference.) The appellee's reply
brief must also be limited to the issues presented by the cross-appeal.
Subdivision (d). Subdivision (d) specifies the colors of the covers on briefs filed in a case
involving a cross-appeal. It is patterned after Rule 32(a)(2), which does not specifically refer to
cross-appeals.
Subdivision (e). Subdivision (e) sets forth limits on the length of the briefs filed in a case
involving a cross-appeal. It is patterned after Rule 32(a)(7), which does not specifically refer to
cross-appeals. Subdivision (e) permits the appellee's principal and response brief to be longer than
a typical principal brief on the merits because this brief serves not only as the principal brief on the
merits of the cross-appeal, but also as the response brief on the merits of the appeal. Likewise,
subdivision (e) permits the appellant's response and reply brief to be longer than a typical reply
brief because this brief serves not only as the reply brief in the appeal, but also as the response brief
in the cross-appeal. For purposes of determining the maximum length of an amicus curiae's brief
filed in a case involving a cross-appeal, Rule 29(d)'s reference to "the maximum length authorized
by these rules for a party's principal brief" should be understood to refer to subdivision (e)'s
limitations on the length of an appellant's principal brief.
Subdivision (f). Subdivision (f) provides deadlines for serving and filing briefs in a
cross-appeal. It is patterned after Rule 31(a)(1), which does not specifically refer to cross-appeals.
Changes Made After Publication and Comments. The Committee adopted the
recommendation of the Style Subcommittee that the text of Rule 28.1 be changed in a few minor
respects to improve clarity. (That recommendation is described below.) The Committee also
adopted three suggestions made by the Department of Justice: (1) A sentence was added to the
Committee Note to Rule 28.1(b) to clarify that the term "appellant" (and "appellee") as used by
rules other than Rules 28.1, 30, and 34, refers to both the appellant in an appeal and the
cross-appellant in a cross-appeal (and to both the appellee in an appeal and the cross-appellee in a
cross-appeal). (2) Rule 28.1(d) was amended to prescribe cover colors for supplemental briefs and
briefs filed by an intervenor or amicus curiae. (3) A few words were added to the Committee Note
to Rule 28.1(e) to clarify the length of an amicus curiae's brief.
Committee Notes on Rules—2009 Amendment
Subdivision (f)(4). Subdivision (f)(4) formerly required that the appellee's reply brief be
served "at least 3 days before argument unless the court, for good cause, allows a later filing."
Under former Rule 26(a), "3 days" could mean as many as 5 or even 6 days. See the Note to Rule
26. Under revised Rule 26(a), intermediate weekends and holidays are counted. Changing "3 days"
to "7 days" alters the period accordingly. Under revised Rule 26(a), when a period ends on a
weekend or holiday, one must continue to count in the same direction until the next day that is not
a weekend or holiday; the choice of the 7-day period for subdivision (f)(4) will minimize such
occurrences.
Committee Notes on Rules—2013 Amendment
Subdivision (c). Subdivision (c) is amended to accord with the amendments to Rule 28(a).
Rule 28(a) is amended to consolidate subdivisions (a)(6) and (a)(7) into a new subdivision (a)(6)
that provides for one "statement of the case setting out the facts relevant to the issues submitted for
review, describing the relevant procedural history, and identifying the rulings presented for

review. . . ." Rule 28.1(c) is amended to refer to that consolidated "statement of the case," and
references to subdivisions of Rule 28(a) are revised to reflect the renumbering of those
subdivisions.
Changes Made After Publication and Comment. No changes were made to the text of the
proposed amendment to Rule 28.1 after publication and comment. The Committee revised a
quotation in the Committee Note to Rule 28.1(c) to conform to the changes (described above) to
the text of proposed Rule 28(a)(6).

Rule 29. Brief of an Amicus Curiae
(a) When Permitted. The United States or its officer or agency or a state may file an
amicus-curiae brief without the consent of the parties or leave of court. Any other amicus curiae
may file a brief only by leave of court or if the brief states that all parties have consented to its
filing.
(b) Motion for Leave to File. The motion must be accompanied by the proposed brief and
state:
(1) the movant's interest; and
(2) the reason why an amicus brief is desirable and why the matters asserted are relevant to
the disposition of the case.
(c) Contents and Form. An amicus brief must comply with Rule 32. In addition to the
requirements of Rule 32, the cover must identify the party or parties supported and indicate
whether the brief supports affirmance or reversal. An amicus brief need not comply with Rule 28,
but must include the following:
(1) if the amicus curiae is a corporation, a disclosure statement like that required of parties
by Rule 26.1;
(2) a table of contents, with page references;
(3) a table of authorities—cases (alphabetically arranged), statutes, and other
authorities—with references to the pages of the brief where they are cited;
(4) a concise statement of the identity of the amicus curiae, its interest in the case, and the
source of its authority to file;
(5) unless the amicus curiae is one listed in the first sentence of Rule 29(a), a statement that
indicates whether:
(A) a party's counsel authored the brief in whole or in part;
(B) a party or a party's counsel contributed money that was intended to fund preparing or
submitting the brief; and
(C) a person—other than the amicus curiae, its members, or its counsel—contributed
money that was intended to fund preparing or submitting the brief and, if so, identifies each such
person;
(6) an argument, which may be preceded by a summary and which need not include a
statement of the applicable standard of review; and
(7) a certificate of compliance, if required by Rule 32(a)(7).
(d) Length. Except by the court's permission, an amicus brief may be no more than one-half
the maximum length authorized by these rules for a party's principal brief. If the court grants a

party permission to file a longer brief, that extension does not affect the length of an amicus brief.
(e) Time for Filing. An amicus curiae must file its brief, accompanied by a motion for filing
when necessary, no later than 7 days after the principal brief of the party being supported is filed.
An amicus curiae that does not support either party must file its brief no later than 7 days after the
appellant's or petitioner's principal brief is filed. A court may grant leave for later filing, specifying
the time within which an opposing party may answer.
(f) Reply Brief. Except by the court's permission, an amicus curiae may not file a reply
brief.
(g) Oral Argument. An amicus curiae may participate in oral argument only with the
court's permission.
(As amended Apr. 24, 1998, eff. Dec. 1, 1998; Apr. 28, 2010, eff. Dec. 1, 2010.)
Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules—1967
Only five circuits presently regulate the filing of the brief of an amicus curiae. See D.C.
Cir. Rule 18(j); 1st Cir. Rule 23(10); 6th Cir. Rule 17(4); 9th Cir. Rule 18(9); 10th Cir. Rule 20.
This rule follows the practice of a majority of circuits in requiring leave of court to file an amicus
brief except under the circumstances stated therein. Compare Supreme Court Rule 42.
Committee Notes on Rules—1998 Amendment
The language and organization of the rule are amended to make the rule more easily
understood. In addition to changes made to improve the understanding, the Advisory Committee
has changed language to make style and terminology consistent throughout the appellate rules.
These changes are intended to be stylistic only.
Several substantive changes are made in this rule, however.
Subdivision (a). The major change in this subpart is that when a brief is filed with the
consent of all parties, it is no longer necessary to obtain the parties' written consent and to file the
consents with the brief. It is sufficient to obtain the parties' oral consent and to state in the brief that
all parties have consented. It is sometimes difficult to obtain all the written consents by the filing
deadline and it is not unusual for counsel to represent that parties have consented; for example, in
a motion for extension of time to file a brief it is not unusual for the movant to state that the other
parties have been consulted and they do not object to the extension. If a party's consent has been
misrepresented, the party will be able to take action before the court considers the amicus brief.
The District of Columbia is added to the list of entities allowed to file an amicus brief
without consent of all parties. The other changes in this material are stylistic.
Subdivision (b). The provision in the former rule, granting permission to conditionally file
the brief with the motion, is changed to one requiring that the brief accompany the motion. Sup. Ct.
R. 37.4 requires that the proposed brief be presented with the motion.
The former rule only required the motion to identify the applicant's interest and to
generally state the reasons why an amicus brief is desirable. The amended rule additionally
requires that the motion state the relevance of the matters asserted to the disposition of the case. As
Sup. Ct. R. 37.1 states:
An amicus curiae brief which brings relevant matter to the attention of the Court that has
not already been brought to its attention by the parties is of considerable help to the Court. An
amicus curiae brief which does not serve this purpose simply burdens the staff and facilities of the
Court and its filing is not favored.

Because the relevance of the matters asserted by an amicus is ordinarily the most
compelling reason for granting leave to file, the Committee believes that it is helpful to explicitly
require such a showing.
Subdivision (c). The provisions in this subdivision are entirely new. Previously there was
confusion as to whether an amicus brief must include all of the items listed in Rule 28. Out of
caution practitioners in some circuits included all those items. Ordinarily that is unnecessary.
The requirement that the cover identify the party supported and indicate whether the
amicus supports affirmance or reversal is an administrative aid.
Paragraph (c)(3) requires an amicus to state the source of its authority to file. The amicus
simply must identify which of the provisions in Rule 29(a) provides the basis for the amicus to file
its brief.
Subdivision (d). This new provision imposes a shorter page limit for an amicus brief than
for a party's brief. This is appropriate for two reasons. First, an amicus may omit certain items that
must be included in a party's brief. Second, an amicus brief is supplemental. It need not address all
issues or all facets of a case. It should treat only matter not adequately addressed by a party.
Subdivision (e). The time limit for filing is changed. An amicus brief must be filed no later
than 7 days after the principal brief of the party being supported is filed. Occasionally, an amicus
supports neither party; in such instances, the amendment provides that the amicus brief must be
filed no later than 7 days after the appellant's or petitioner's principal brief is filed. Note that in both
instances the 7-day period runs from when a brief is filed. The passive voice—"is filed"—is used
deliberately. A party or amicus can send its brief to a court for filing and, under Rule 25, the brief
is timely if mailed within the filing period. Although the brief is timely if mailed within the filing
period, it is not "filed" until the court receives it and file stamps it. "Filing" is done by the court, not
by the party. It may be necessary for an amicus to contact the court to ascertain the filing date.
The 7-day stagger was adopted because it is long enough to permit an amicus to review the
completed brief of the party being supported and avoid repetitious argument. A 7-day period also
is short enough that no adjustment need be made in the opposing party's briefing schedule. The
opposing party will have sufficient time to review arguments made by the amicus and address
them in the party's responsive pleading. The timetable for filing the parties' briefs is unaffected by
this change.
A court may grant permission to file an amicus brief in a context in which the party does
not file a "principal brief"; for example, an amicus may be permitted to file in support of a party's
petition for rehearing. In such instances the court will establish the filing time for the amicus.
The former rule's statement that a court may, for cause shown, grant leave for later filing is
unnecessary. Rule 26(b) grants general authority to enlarge the time prescribed in these rules for
good cause shown. This new rule, however, states that when a court grants permission for later
filing, the court must specify the period within which an opposing party may answer the arguments
of the amicus.
Subdivision (f). This subdivision generally prohibits the filing a a reply brief by an amicus
curiae. Sup. Ct. R. 37 and local rules of the D.C., Ninth, and Federal Circuits state that an amicus
may not file a reply brief. The role of an amicus should not require the use of a reply brief.
Subdivision (g). The language of this subdivision stating that an amicus will be granted
permission to participate in oral argument "only for extraordinary reasons" has been deleted. The
change is made to reflect more accurately the current practice in which it is not unusual for a court
to permit an amicus to argue when a party is willing to share its argument time with the amicus.
The Committee does not intend, however, to suggest that in other instances an amicus will be

permitted to argue absent extraordinary circumstances.
Committee Notes on Rules—2010 Amendment
Subdivision (a). New Rule 1(b) defines the term "state" to include "the District of
Columbia and any United States commonwealth or territory." That definition renders subdivision
(a)'s reference to a "Territory, Commonwealth, or the District of Columbia" redundant.
Accordingly, subdivision (a) is amended to refer simply to "[t]he United States or its officer or
agency or a state."
Subdivision (c). The subparts of subdivision (c) are renumbered due to the relocation of an
existing provision in new subdivision (c)(1) and the addition of a new provision in new
subdivision (c)(5). Existing subdivisions (c)(1) through (c)(5) are renumbered, respectively, (c)(2),
(c)(3), (c)(4), (c)(6) and (c)(7). The new ordering of the subdivisions tracks the order in which the
items should appear in the brief.
Subdivision (c)(1). The requirement that corporate amici include a disclosure statement
like that required of parties by Rule 26.1 was previously stated in the third sentence of subdivision
(c). The requirement has been moved to new subdivision (c)(1) for ease of reference.
Subdivision (c)(5). New subdivision (c)(5) sets certain disclosure requirements concerning
authorship and funding. Subdivision (c)(5) exempts from the authorship and funding disclosure
requirements entities entitled under subdivision (a) to file an amicus brief without the consent of
the parties or leave of court. Subdivision (c)(5) requires amicus briefs to disclose whether counsel
for a party authored the brief in whole or in part and whether a party or a party's counsel
contributed money with the intention of funding the preparation or submission of the brief. A
party's or counsel's payment of general membership dues to an amicus need not be disclosed.
Subdivision (c)(5) also requires amicus briefs to state whether any other "person" (other than the
amicus, its members, or its counsel) contributed money with the intention of funding the brief's
preparation or submission, and, if so, to identify all such persons. "Person," as used in subdivision
(c)(5), includes artificial persons as well as natural persons.
The disclosure requirement, which is modeled on Supreme Court Rule 37.6, serves to deter
counsel from using an amicus brief to circumvent page limits on the parties' briefs. See Glassroth
v. Moore, 347 F.3d 916, 919 (11th Cir. 2003) (noting the majority's suspicion "that amicus briefs
are often used as a means of evading the page limitations on a party's briefs"). It also may help
judges to assess whether the amicus itself considers the issue important enough to sustain the cost
and effort of filing an amicus brief.
It should be noted that coordination between the amicus and the party whose position the
amicus supports is desirable, to the extent that it helps to avoid duplicative arguments. This was
particularly true prior to the 1998 amendments, when deadlines for amici were the same as those
for the party whose position they supported. Now that the filing deadlines are staggered,
coordination may not always be essential in order to avoid duplication. In any event, mere
coordination—in the sense of sharing drafts of briefs—need not be disclosed under subdivision
(c)(5). Cf. Eugene Gressman et al., Supreme Court Practice 739 (9th ed. 2007) (Supreme Court
Rule 37.6 does not "require disclosure of any coordination and discussion between party counsel
and amici counsel regarding their respective arguments....").
Changes Made After Publication and Comment. No changes were made to the proposed
amendment to Rule 29(a). However, the Committee made a number of changes to Rule 29(c).
One change concerns the third subdivision of the authorship and funding disclosure
requirement. As published, that third subdivision would have directed the filer to "identif[y] every

person—other than the amicus curiae, its members, or its counsel—who contributed money that
was intended to fund preparing or submitting the brief." A commentator criticized this language as
ambiguous, because the commentator argued that the provision as drafted did not make clear
whether it is necessary for the brief to state that no such persons exist (if that is the case). The
Committee revised this portion of the requirement to require a statement that indicates whether "a
person—other than the amicus curiae, its members, or its counsel—contributed money that was
intended to fund preparing or submitting the brief and, if so, identifies each such person."
Another set of changes concerns the placement of the disclosure requirement. As
published, the Rule 29(c) proposal would have placed the new authorship and funding disclosure
requirement in a new subdivision (c)(7) and would have moved the requirement of a corporate
disclosure statement from the initial block of text in Rule 29(c) to a new subdivision (c)(6). New
subdivision (c)(7) would have directed that the authorship and funding disclosure be made "in the
first footnote on the first page." Commentators criticized this directive as ambiguous and
suggested that a better approach would be to direct that the authorship and funding disclosure
follow the statement currently required by existing Rule 29(c)(3). The Committee found merit in
these suggestions and decided to add the authorship and funding disclosure provision to existing
subdivision (c)(3). However, a further revision to the structure of subdivision (c) was later made in
response to style guidance from Professor Kimble, as discussed below.
Subsequent to the Appellate Rules Committee's meeting, the language adopted by the
advisory committee was circulated to Professor Kimble for style review. Professor Kimble argued
that the authorship and funding disclosure provision should be placed in a separate subdivision
rather than being placed in existing subdivision (c)(3). In the light of the Appellate Rules
Committee's goal of listing the required components in the order in which they should appear in
the brief, the decision was made to place the authorship and funding disclosure provision in a new
subdivision following existing subdivision (c)(3). Though this requires renumbering the subparts
of Rule 29(c), those subparts have only existed for about a decade (since the 1998 restyling) and
citations to the specific subparts of Rule 29(c) do not appear in the caselaw. Given that this change
entails renumbering some subparts of Rule 29(c), it also seems advisable to move the corporate
disclosure provision into a new subdivision (c)(1) and to renumber the subsequent subdivisions
accordingly. Professor Kimble also suggested two stylistic changes to the language of what will
now become new subdivision (c)(5). First, instead of using the language "unless filed by an amicus
curiae listed in the first sentence of Rule 29(a)," the provision now reads "unless the amicus curiae
is one listed in the first sentence of Rule 29(a)." Second, the words "indicates whether" have been
moved up into the introductory text in 29(c)(5) instead of being repeated at the outset of the three
subsections (29(c)(5)(A), (B) and (C)). Also, a comma has been added to what will become Rule
29(c)(3).

Rule 30. Appendix to the Briefs
(a) Appellant's Responsibility.
(1) Contents of the Appendix. The appellant must prepare and file an appendix to the briefs
containing:
(A) the relevant docket entries in the proceeding below;
(B) the relevant portions of the pleadings, charge, findings, or opinion;
(C) the judgment, order, or decision in question; and
(D) other parts of the record to which the parties wish to direct the court's attention.

(2) Excluded Material. Memoranda of law in the district court should not be included in the
appendix unless they have independent relevance. Parts of the record may be relied on by the court
or the parties even though not included in the appendix.
(3) Time to File; Number of Copies. Unless filing is deferred under Rule 30(c), the
appellant must file 10 copies of the appendix with the brief and must serve one copy on counsel for
each party separately represented. An unrepresented party proceeding in forma pauperis must file
4 legible copies with the clerk, and one copy must be served on counsel for each separately
represented party. The court may by local rule or by order in a particular case require the filing or
service of a different number.
(b) All Parties' Responsibilities.
(1) Determining the Contents of the Appendix. The parties are encouraged to agree on the
contents of the appendix. In the absence of an agreement, the appellant must, within 14 days after
the record is filed, serve on the appellee a designation of the parts of the record the appellant
intends to include in the appendix and a statement of the issues the appellant intends to present for
review. The appellee may, within 14 days after receiving the designation, serve on the appellant a
designation of additional parts to which it wishes to direct the court's attention. The appellant must
include the designated parts in the appendix. The parties must not engage in unnecessary
designation of parts of the record, because the entire record is available to the court. This
paragraph applies also to a cross-appellant and a cross-appellee.
(2) Costs of Appendix. Unless the parties agree otherwise, the appellant must pay the cost
of the appendix. If the appellant considers parts of the record designated by the appellee to be
unnecessary, the appellant may advise the appellee, who must then advance the cost of including
those parts. The cost of the appendix is a taxable cost. But if any party causes unnecessary parts of
the record to be included in the appendix, the court may impose the cost of those parts on that
party. Each circuit must, by local rule, provide for sanctions against attorneys who unreasonably
and vexatiously increase litigation costs by including unnecessary material in the appendix.
(c) Deferred Appendix.
(1) Deferral Until After Briefs Are Filed. The court may provide by rule for classes of cases
or by order in a particular case that preparation of the appendix may be deferred until after the
briefs have been filed and that the appendix may be filed 21 days after the appellee's brief is
served. Even though the filing of the appendix may be deferred, Rule 30(b) applies; except that a
party must designate the parts of the record it wants included in the appendix when it serves its
brief, and need not include a statement of the issues presented.
(2) References to the Record.
(A) If the deferred appendix is used, the parties may cite in their briefs the pertinent pages
of the record. When the appendix is prepared, the record pages cited in the briefs must be indicated
by inserting record page numbers, in brackets, at places in the appendix where those pages of the
record appear.
(B) A party who wants to refer directly to pages of the appendix may serve and file copies
of the brief within the time required by Rule 31(a), containing appropriate references to pertinent
pages of the record. In that event, within 14 days after the appendix is filed, the party must serve
and file copies of the brief, containing references to the pages of the appendix in place of or in
addition to the references to the pertinent pages of the record. Except for the correction of

typographical errors, no other changes may be made to the brief.
(d) Format of the Appendix. The appendix must begin with a table of contents identifying
the page at which each part begins. The relevant docket entries must follow the table of contents.
Other parts of the record must follow chronologically. When pages from the transcript of
proceedings are placed in the appendix, the transcript page numbers must be shown in brackets
immediately before the included pages. Omissions in the text of papers or of the transcript must be
indicated by asterisks. Immaterial formal matters (captions, subscriptions, acknowledgments, etc.)
should be omitted.
(e) Reproduction of Exhibits. Exhibits designated for inclusion in the appendix may be
reproduced in a separate volume, or volumes, suitably indexed. Four copies must be filed with the
appendix, and one copy must be served on counsel for each separately represented party. If a
transcript of a proceeding before an administrative agency, board, commission, or officer was used
in a district-court action and has been designated for inclusion in the appendix, the transcript must
be placed in the appendix as an exhibit.
(f) Appeal on the Original Record Without an Appendix. The court may, either by rule for
all cases or classes of cases or by order in a particular case, dispense with the appendix and permit
an appeal to proceed on the original record with any copies of the record, or relevant parts, that the
court may order the parties to file.

Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules—1967
Subdivision (a). Only two circuits presently require a printed record (5th Cir. Rule 23(a);
8th Cir. Rule 10 (in civil appeals only)), and the rules and practice in those circuits combine to
make the difference between a printed record and the appendix, which is now used in eight circuits
and in the Supreme Court in lieu of the printed record, largely nominal. The essential
characteristics of the appendix method are: (1) the entire record may not be reproduced; (2)
instead, the parties are to set out in an appendix to the briefs those parts of the record which in their
judgment the judges must consult in order to determine the issues presented by the appeal; (3) the
appendix is not the record but merely a selection therefrom for the convenience of the judges of the
court of appeals; the record is the actual trial court record, and the record itself is always available
to supply inadvertent omissions from the appendix. These essentials are incorporated, either by
rule or by practice, in the circuits that continue to require the printed record rather than the
appendix. See 5th Cir. Rule 23(a)(9) and 8th Cir. Rule 10(a)–(d).
Subdivision (b). Under the practice in six of the eight circuits which now use the appendix
method, unless the parties agree to use a single appendix, the appellant files with his brief an
appendix containing the parts of the record which he deems it essential that the court read in order
to determine the questions presented. If the appellee deems additional parts of the record necessary
he must include such parts as an appendix to his brief. The proposed rules differ from that practice.
By the new rule a single appendix is to be filed. It is to be prepared by the appellant, who must
include therein those parts which he deems essential and those which the appellee designates as
essential.
Under the practice by which each party files his own appendix the resulting reproduction of
essential parts of the record is often fragmentary; it is not infrequently necessary to piece several

appendices together to arrive at a usable reproduction. Too, there seems to be a tendency on the
part of some appellants to reproduce less than what is necessary for a determination of the issues
presented (see Moran Towing Corp. v. M. A. Gammino Construction Co., 363 F.2d 108 (1st Cir.
1966); Walters v. Shari Music Publishing Corp., 298 F.2d 206 (2d Cir. 1962) and cases cited
therein; Morrison v. Texas Co., 289 F.2d 382 (7th Cir. 1961) and cases cited therein), a tendency
which is doubtless encouraged by the requirement in present rules that the appellee reproduce in
his separately prepared appendix such necessary parts of the record as are not included by the
appellant.
Under the proposed rule responsibility for the preparation of the appendix is placed on the
appellant. If the appellee feels that the appellant has omitted essential portions of the record, he
may require the appellant to include such portions in the appendix. The appellant is protected
against a demand that he reproduce parts which he considers unnecessary by the provisions
entitling him to require the appellee to advance the costs of reproducing such parts and authorizing
denial of costs for matter unnecessarily reproduced.
Subdivision (c). This subdivision permits the appellant to elect to defer the production of
the appendix to the briefs until the briefs of both sides are written, and authorizes a court of appeals
to require such deferred filing by rule or order. The advantage of this method of preparing the
appendix is that it permits the parties to determine what parts of the record need to be reproduced
in the light of the issues actually presented by the briefs. Often neither side is in a position to say
precisely what is needed until the briefs are completed. Once the argument on both sides is known,
it should be possible to confine the matter reproduced in the appendix to that which is essential to
a determination of the appeal or review. This method of preparing the appendix is presently in use
in the Tenth Circuit (Rule 17) and in other circuits in review of agency proceedings, and it has
proven its value in reducing the volume required to be reproduced. When the record is long, use of
this method is likely to result in substantial economy to the parties.
Subdivision (e). The purpose of this subdivision is to reduce the cost of reproducing
exhibits. While subdivision (a) requires that 10 copies of the appendix be filed, unless the court
requires a lesser number, subdivision (e) permits exhibits necessary for the determination of an
appeal to be bound separately, and requires only 4 copies of such a separate volume or volumes to
be filed and a single copy to be served on counsel.
Subdivision (f). This subdivision authorizes a court of appeals to dispense with the
appendix method of reproducing parts of the record and to hear appeals on the original record and
such copies of it as the court may require.
Since 1962 the Ninth Circuit has permitted all appeals to be heard on the original record
and a very limited number of copies. Under the practice as adopted in 1962, any party to an appeal
could elect to have the appeal heard on the original record and two copies thereof rather than on the
printed record theretofore required. The resulting substantial saving of printing costs led to the
election of the new practice in virtually all cases, and by 1967 the use of printed records had
ceased. By a recent amendment, the Ninth Circuit has abolished the printed record altogether. Its
rules now provide that all appeals are to be heard on the original record, and it has reduced the
number of copies required to two sets of copies of the transmitted original papers (excluding
copies of exhibits, which need not be filed unless specifically ordered). See 9 Cir. Rule 10, as
amended June 2, 1967, effective September 1, 1967. The Eighth Circuit permits appeals in
criminal cases and in habeas corpus and 28 U.S.C. §2255 proceedings to be heard on the original
record and two copies thereof. See 8 Cir. Rule 8 (i)–(j). The Tenth Circuit permits appeals in all
cases to be heard on the original record and four copies thereof whenever the record consists of

two hundred pages or less. See 10 Cir. Rule 17(a). This subdivision expressly authorizes the
continuation of the practices in the Eighth, Ninth and Tenth Circuits.
The judges of the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit have expressed complete
satisfaction with the practice there in use and have suggested that attention be called to the
advantages which it offers in terms of reducing cost.
Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules—1970 Amendment
Subdivision (a). The amendment of subdivision (a) is related to the amendment of Rule
31(a), which authorizes a court of appeals to shorten the time for filing briefs. By virtue of this
amendment, if the time for filing the brief of the appellant is shortened the time for filing the
appendix is likewise shortened.
Subdivision (c). As originally written, subdivision (c) permitted the appellant to elect to
defer filing of the appendix until 21 days after service of the brief of the appellee. As amended,
subdivision (c) requires that an order of court be obtained before filing of the appendix can be
deferred, unless a court permits deferred filing by local rule. The amendment should not cause use
of the deferred appendix to be viewed with disfavor. In cases involving lengthy records,
permission to defer filing of the appendix should be freely granted as an inducement to the parties
to include in the appendix only matter that the briefs show to be necessary for consideration by the
judges. But the Committee is advised that appellants have elected to defer filing of the appendix in
cases involving brief records merely to obtain the 21 day delay. The subdivision is amended to
prevent that practice.
Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules—1986 Amendment
Subdivision (a). During its study of the separate appendix [see Report on the Advisory
Committee on the Federal Appellate Rules on the Operation of Rule 30, — FRD — (1985)], the
Advisory Committee found that this document was frequently encumbered with memoranda
submitted to the trial court. United States v. Noall, 587 F.2d 123, 125 n. 1 (2nd Cir. 1978). See
generally Drewett v. Aetna Cas. & Sur. Co., 539 F.2d 496, 500 (5th Cir. 1976); Volkswagenwerk
Aktiengesellschaft v. Church, 413 F.2d 1126, 1128 (9th Cir. 1969). Inclusion of such material
makes the appendix more bulky and therefore less useful to the appellate panel. It also can increase
significantly the costs of litigation.
There are occasions when such trial court memoranda have independent relevance in the
appellate litigation. For instance, there may be a dispute as to whether a particular point was raised
or whether a concession was made in the district court. In such circumstances, it is appropriate to
include pertinent sections of such memoranda in the appendix.
Subdivision (b). The amendment to subdivision (b) is designed to require the circuits, by
local rule, to establish a procedural mechanism for the imposition of sanctions against those
attorneys who conduct appellate litigation in bad faith. Both 28 U.S.C. §1927 and the inherent
power of the court authorized such sanctions. See Brennan v. Local 357, International
Brotherhood of Teamsters, 709 F.2d 611 (9th Cir. 1983). See generally Roadway Express, Inc. v.
Piper, 447 U.S. 752 (1980). While considerations of uniformity are important and doubtless will
be taken into account by the judges of the respective circuits, the Advisory Committee believes
that, at this time, the circuits need the flexibility to tailor their approach to the conditions of local
practice. The local rule shall provide for notice and opportunity to respond before the imposition of
any sanction.

Technical amendments also are made to subdivisions (a), (b) and (c) which are not
intended to be substantive changes.
Taxation of Fees in Appeals in Which the Requirement of an Appendix Is Dispensed With
The Judicial Conference of the United States at its session on October 28th and 29th
approved the following resolution relating to fees to be taxed in the courts of appeals as submitted
by the Judicial Council of the Ninth Circuit with the proviso that its application to any court of
appeals shall be at the election of each such court:
For some time it has been the practice in the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals to dispense
with an appendix in an appellate record and to hear the appeal on the original record, with a
number of copies thereof being supplied (Rule 30f, Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure). It has
been the practice of the Court to tax a fee of $5 in small records and $10 in large records for the
time of the clerk involved in preparing such appeals and by way of reimbursement for postage
expense. Judicial Conference approval heretofore has not been secured and the Judicial Council of
the Ninth Circuit now seeks to fix a flat fee of $15 to be charged as fees for costs to be charged by
any court of appeals "in any appeal in which the requirement of an appendix is dispensed with
pursuant to Rule 30f, Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure."
Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules—1991 Amendment
Subdivision (b). The amendment requires a cross appellant to serve the appellant with a
statement of the issues that the cross appellant intends to pursue on appeal. No later than ten days
after the record is filed, the appellant and cross appellant must serve each other with a statement of
the issues each intends to present for review and with a designation of the parts of the record that
each wants included in the appendix. Within the next ten days, both the appellee and the cross
appellee may designate additional materials for inclusion in the appendix. The appellant must then
include in the appendix the parts thus designated for both the appeal and any cross appeals. The
Committee expects that simultaneous compliance with this subdivision by an appellant and a cross
appellant will be feasible in most cases. If a cross appellant cannot fairly be expected to comply
until receipt of the appellant's statement of issues, relief may be sought by motion in the court of
appeals.
Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules—1994 Amendment
Subdivision (a). The only substantive change is to allow a court to require the filing of a
greater number of copies of an appendix as well as a lesser number.
Committee Notes on Rules—1998 Amendment
The language and organization of the rule are amended to make the rule more easily
understood. In addition to changes made to improve the understanding, the Advisory Committee
has changed language to make style and terminology consistent throughout the appellate rules.
These changes are intended to be stylistic only.
Subdivision (a). Paragraph (a)(3) is amended so that it is consistent with Rule 31(b). An
unrepresented party proceeding in forma pauperis is only required to file 4 copies of the appendix
rather than 10.

Subdivision (c). When a deferred appendix is used, a brief must make reference to the
original record rather than to the appendix because it does not exist when the briefs are prepared.
Unless a party later files an amended brief with direct references to the pages of the appendix (as
provided in subparagraph (c)(2)(B)), the material in the appendix must indicate the pages of the
original record from which it was drawn so that a reader of the brief can make meaningful use of
the appendix. The instructions in the current rule for cross-referencing the appendix materials to
the original record are unclear. The language in paragraph (c)(2) has been amended to try to clarify
the procedure.
Subdivision (d). In recognition of the fact that use of a typeset appendix is exceedingly rare
in the courts of appeals, the last sentence—permitting a question and answer (as from a transcript)
to be in a single paragraph—has been omitted.
Committee Notes on Rules—2009 Amendment
Subdivision (b)(1). The times set in the former rule at 10 days have been revised to 14 days.
See the Note to Rule 26.

Rule 31. Serving and Filing Briefs
(a) Time to Serve and File a Brief.
(1) The appellant must serve and file a brief within 40 days after the record is filed. The
appellee must serve and file a brief within 30 days after the appellant's brief is served. The
appellant may serve and file a reply brief within 14 days after service of the appellee's brief but a
reply brief must be filed at least 7 days before argument, unless the court, for good cause, allows a
later filing.
(2) A court of appeals that routinely considers cases on the merits promptly after the briefs
are filed may shorten the time to serve and file briefs, either by local rule or by order in a particular
case.
(b) Number of Copies. Twenty-five copies of each brief must be filed with the clerk and 2
copies must be served on each unrepresented party and on counsel for each separately represented
party. An unrepresented party proceeding in forma pauperis must file 4 legible copies with the
clerk, and one copy must be served on each unrepresented party and on counsel for each separately
represented party. The court may by local rule or by order in a particular case require the filing or
service of a different number.
(c) Consequence of Failure to File. If an appellant fails to file a brief within the time
provided by this rule, or within an extended time, an appellee may move to dismiss the appeal. An
appellee who fails to file a brief will not be heard at oral argument unless the court grants
permission.
(As amended Mar. 30, 1970, eff. July 1, 1970; Mar. 10, 1986, eff. July 1, 1986; Apr. 29,
1994, eff. Dec. 1, 1994; Apr. 24, 1998, eff. Dec. 1, 1998; Apr. 29, 2002, eff. Dec. 1, 2002; Mar. 26,
2009, eff. Dec. 1, 2009.)
Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules—1967
A majority of the circuits now require the brief of the appellant to be filed within 30 days

from the date on which the record is filed. But in those circuits an exchange of designations is
unnecessary in the preparation of the appendix. The appellant files with his brief an appendix
containing the parts of the record which he deems essential. If the appellee considers other parts
essential, he includes those parts in his own appendix. Since the proposed rule requires the
appellant to file with his brief an appendix containing necessary parts of the record as designated
by both parties, the rule allows the appellant 40 days in order to provide time for the exchange of
designations respecting the content of the appendix (see Rule 30(b)).
Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules—1970 Amendment
The time prescribed by Rule 31(a) for preparing briefs—40 days to the appellant, 30 days
to the appellee—is well within the time that must ordinarily elapse in most circuits before an
appeal can be reached for consideration. In those circuits, the time prescribed by the Rule should
not be disturbed. But if a court of appeals maintains a current calendar, that is, if an appeal can be
heard as soon as the briefs have been filed, or if the practice of the court permits the submission of
appeals for preliminary consideration as soon as the briefs have been filed, the court should be free
to prescribe shorter periods in the interest of expediting decision.
Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules—1986 Amendment
The amendments to Rules 31(a) and (c) are technical. No substantive change is intended.
Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules—1994 Amendment
Subdivision (b). The amendment allows a court of appeals to require the filing of a greater,
as well as a lesser, number of copies of briefs. The amendment also allows the required number to
be prescribed by local rule as well as by order in a particular case.
Committee Notes on Rules—1998 Amendment
The language and organization of the rule are amended to make the rule more easily
understood. In addition to changes made to improve the understanding, the Advisory Committee
has changed language to make style and terminology consistent throughout the appellate rules.
These changes are intended to be stylistic only; a substantive change is made, however, in
subdivision (b).
Subdivision (a). Paragraph (a)(2) explicitly authorizes a court of appeals to shorten a
briefing schedule if the court routinely considers cases on the merits promptly after the briefs are
filed. Extensions of the briefing schedule, by order, are permitted under the general provisions of
Rule 26(b).
Subdivision (b). The current rule says that a party who is permitted to file "typewritten
ribbon and carbon copies of the brief" need only file an original and three copies of the brief. The
quoted language, in conjunction with current rule 24(c), means that a party allowed to proceed in
forma pauperis need not file 25 copies of the brief. Two changes are made in this subdivision.
First, it is anachronistic to refer to a party who is allowed to file a typewritten brief as if that would
distinguish the party from all other parties; any party is permitted to file a typewritten brief. The
amended rule states directly that it applies to a party permitted to proceed in forma pauperis.
Second, the amended rule does not generally permit parties who are represented by counsel to file

the lesser number of briefs. Inexpensive methods of copying are generally available. Unless it
would impose hardship, in which case a motion to file a lesser number should be filed, a
represented party must file the usual number of briefs.
Committee Notes on Rules—2002 Amendment
Subdivision (b). In requiring that two copies of each brief "must be served on counsel for
each separately represented party," Rule 31(b) may be read to imply that copies of briefs need not
be served on unrepresented parties. The Rule has been amended to clarify that briefs must be
served on all parties, including those who are not represented by counsel.
Changes Made After Publication and Comments. No changes were made to the text of the
proposed amendment or to the Committee Note.
Committee Notes on Rules—2009 Amendment
Subdivision (a)(1). Subdivision (a)(1) formerly required that the appellant's reply brief be
served "at least 3 days before argument, unless the court, for good cause, allows a later filing."
Under former Rule 26(a), "3 days" could mean as many as 5 or even 6 days. See the Note to Rule
26. Under revised Rule 26(a), intermediate weekends and holidays are counted. Changing "3 days"
to "7 days" alters the period accordingly. Under revised Rule 26(a), when a period ends on a
weekend or holiday, one must continue to count in the same direction until the next day that is not
a weekend or holiday; the choice of the 7-day period for subdivision (a)(1) will minimize such
occurrences.

Rule 32. Form of Briefs, Appendices, and Other Papers
(a) Form of a Brief.
(1) Reproduction.
(A) A brief may be reproduced by any process that yields a clear black image on light
paper. The paper must be opaque and unglazed. Only one side of the paper may be used.
(B) Text must be reproduced with a clarity that equals or exceeds the output of a laser
printer.
(C) Photographs, illustrations, and tables may be reproduced by any method that results in
a good copy of the original; a glossy finish is acceptable if the original is glossy.
(2) Cover. Except for filings by unrepresented parties, the cover of the appellant's brief
must be blue; the appellee's, red; an intervenor's or amicus curiae's, green; any reply brief, gray;
and any supplemental brief, tan. The front cover of a brief must contain:
(A) the number of the case centered at the top;
(B) the name of the court;
(C) the title of the case (see Rule 12(a));
(D) the nature of the proceeding (e.g., Appeal, Petition for Review) and the name of the
court, agency, or board below;
(E) the title of the brief, identifying the party or parties for whom the brief is filed; and
(F) the name, office address, and telephone number of counsel representing the party for
whom the brief is filed.

(3) Binding. The brief must be bound in any manner that is secure, does not obscure the
text, and permits the brief to lie reasonably flat when open.
(4) Paper Size, Line Spacing, and Margins. The brief must be on 8½ by 11 inch paper. The
text must be double-spaced, but quotations more than two lines long may be indented and
single-spaced. Headings and footnotes may be single-spaced. Margins must be at least one inch on
all four sides. Page numbers may be placed in the margins, but no text may appear there.
(5) Typeface. Either a proportionally spaced or a monospaced face may be used.
(A) A proportionally spaced face must include serifs, but sans-serif type may be used in
headings and captions. A proportionally spaced face must be 14-point or larger.
(B) A monospaced face may not contain more than 10½ characters per inch.
(6) Type Styles. A brief must be set in a plain, roman style, although italics or boldface may
be used for emphasis. Case names must be italicized or underlined.
(7) Length.
(A) Page Limitation. A principal brief may not exceed 30 pages, or a reply brief 15 pages,
unless it complies with Rule 32(a)(7)(B) and (C).
(B) Type-Volume Limitation.
(i) A principal brief is acceptable if:
• it contains no more than 14,000 words; or
• it uses a monospaced face and contains no more than 1,300 lines of text.
(ii) A reply brief is acceptable if it contains no more than half of the type volume specified
in Rule 32(a)(7)(B)(i).
(iii) Headings, footnotes, and quotations count toward the word and line limitations. The
corporate disclosure statement, table of contents, table of citations, statement with respect to oral
argument, any addendum containing statutes, rules or regulations, and any certificates of counsel
do not count toward the limitation.
(C) Certificate of Compliance.
(i) A brief submitted under Rules 28.1(e)(2) or 32(a)(7)(B) must include a certificate by the
attorney, or an unrepresented party, that the brief complies with the type-volume limitation. The
person preparing the certificate may rely on the word or line count of the word-processing system
used to prepare the brief. The certificate must state either:
• the number of words in the brief; or
• the number of lines of monospaced type in the brief.
(ii) Form 6 in the Appendix of Forms is a suggested form of a certificate of compliance.
Use of Form 6 must be regarded as sufficient to meet the requirements of Rules 28.1(e)(3) and
32(a)(7)(C)(i).
(b) Form of an Appendix. An appendix must comply with Rule 32(a)(1), (2), (3), and (4),
with the following exceptions:
(1) The cover of a separately bound appendix must be white.
(2) An appendix may include a legible photocopy of any document found in the record or
of a printed judicial or agency decision.

(3) When necessary to facilitate inclusion of odd-sized documents such as technical
drawings, an appendix may be a size other than 8½ by 11 inches, and need not lie reasonably flat
when opened.
(c) Form of Other Papers.
(1) Motion. The form of a motion is governed by Rule 27(d).
(2) Other Papers. Any other paper, including a petition for panel rehearing and a petition
for hearing or rehearing en banc, and any response to such a petition, must be reproduced in the
manner prescribed by Rule 32(a), with the following exceptions:
(A) A cover is not necessary if the caption and signature page of the paper together contain
the information required by Rule 32(a)(2). If a cover is used, it must be white.
(B) Rule 32(a)(7) does not apply.
(d) Signature. Every brief, motion, or other paper filed with the court must be signed by the
party filing the paper or, if the party is represented, by one of the party's attorneys.
(e) Local Variation. Every court of appeals must accept documents that comply with the
form requirements of this rule. By local rule or order in a particular case a court of appeals may
accept documents that do not meet all of the form requirements of this rule.
(As amended Apr. 24, 1998, eff. Dec. 1, 1998; Apr. 29, 2002, eff. Dec. 1, 2002; Apr. 25,

Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules—1967
Only two methods of printing are now generally recognized by the circuits—standard
typographic printing and the offset duplicating process (multilith). A third, mimeographing, is
permitted in the Fifth Circuit. The District of Columbia, Ninth, and Tenth Circuits permit records
to be reproduced by copying processes. The Committee feels that recent and impending advances
in the arts of duplicating and copying warrant experimentation with less costly forms of
reproduction than those now generally authorized. The proposed rule permits, in effect, the use of
any process other than the carbon copy process which produces a clean, readable page. What
constitutes such is left in first instance to the parties and ultimately to the court to determine. The
final sentence of the first paragraph of subdivision (a) is added to allow the use of multilith,
mimeograph, or other forms of copies of the reporter's original transcript whenever such are
available.
Committee Notes on Rules—1998 Amendment
In addition to amending Rule 32 to conform to uniform drafting standards, several
substantive amendments are made. The Advisory Committee had been working on substantive
amendments to Rule 32 for some time prior to completion of this larger project.
Subdivison (a). Form of a Brief.
Paragraph (a)(1). Reproduction.
The rule permits the use of "light" paper, not just "white" paper. Cream and buff colored
paper, including recycled paper, are acceptable. The rule permits printing on only one side of the
paper. Although some argue that paper could be saved by allowing double-sided printing, others
argue that in order to preserve legibility a heavier weight paper would be needed, resulting in little,
if any, paper saving. In addition, the blank sides of a brief are commonly used by judges and their

clerks for making notes about the case.
Because photocopying is inexpensive and widely available and because use of carbon
paper is now very rare, all references to the use of carbon copies have been deleted.
The rule requires that the text be reproduced with a clarity that equals or exceeds the output
of a laser printer. That means that the method used must have a print resolution of 300 dots per inch
(dpi) or more. This will ensure the legibility of the brief. A brief produced by a typewriter or a
daisy wheel printer, as well as one produced by a laser printer, has a print resolution of 300 dpi or
more. But a brief produced by a dot-matrix printer, fax machine, or portable printer that uses heat
or dye transfer methods does not. Some ink jet printers are 300 dpi or more, but some are 216 dpi
and would not be sufficient.
Photographs, illustrations, and tables may be reproduced by any method that results in a
good copy.
Paragraph (a)(2). Cover.
The rule requires that the number of the case be centered at the top of the front cover of a
brief. This will aid in identification of the brief. The idea was drawn from a local rule. The rule also
requires that the title of the brief identify the party or parties on whose behalf the brief is filed.
When there are multiple appellants or appellees, the information is necessary to the court. If,
however, the brief is filed on behalf of all appellants or appellees, it may so indicate. Further, it
may be possible to identify the class of parties on whose behalf the brief is filed. Otherwise, it may
be necessary to name each party. The rule also requires that attorney's telephone numbers appear
on the front cover of a brief or appendix.
Paragraph (a)(3). Binding.
The rule requires a brief to be bound in any manner that is secure, does not obscure the text,
and that permits the brief to lie reasonably flat when open. Many judges and most court employees
do much of their work at computer keyboards and a brief that lies flat when open is significantly
more convenient. One circuit already has such a requirement and another states a preference for it.
While a spiral binding would comply with this requirement, it is not intended to be the exclusive
method of binding. Stapling a brief at the upper left-hand corner also satisfies this requirement as
long as it is sufficiently secure.
Paragraph (a)(4). Paper Size, Line Spacing, and Margins.
The provisions for pamphlet-size briefs are deleted because their use is so rare. If a circuit
wishes to authorize their use, it has authority to do so under subdivision (d) of this rule.
Paragraph (a)(5). Typeface.
This paragraph and the next one, governing type style, are new. The existing rule simply
states that a brief produced by the standard typographic process must be printed in at least 11 point
type, or if produced in any other manner, the lines of text must be double spaced. Today few briefs
are produced by commercial printers or by typewriters; most are produced on and printed by
computer. The availability of computer fonts in a variety of sizes and styles has given rise to local
rules limiting type styles. The Advisory Committee believes that some standards are needed both
to ensure that all litigants have an equal opportunity to present their material and to ensure that the
briefs are easily legible.
With regard to typeface there are two options: proportionally-spaced typeface or
monospaced typeface.
A proportionally-spaced typeface gives a different amount of horizontal space to
characters depending upon the width of the character. A capital "M" is given more horizontal
space than a lower case "i." The rule requires that a proportionally-spaced typeface have serifs.

Serifs are small horizontal or vertical strokes at the ends of the lines that make up the letters and
numbers. Studies have shown that long passages of serif type are easier to read and comprehend
than long passages of sans-serif type. The rule accordingly limits the principal sections of
submissions to serif type, although sans-serif type may be used in headings and captions. This is
the same approach magazines, newspapers, and commercial printers take. Look at a professionally
printed brief; you will find sans-serif type confined to captions, if it is used at all. The next line
shows two characters enlarged for detail. The first has serifs, the second does not.
YY
So that the type is easily legible, the rule requires a minimum type size of 14 points for
proportionally-spaced typeface.
A monospaced typeface is one in which all characters have the same advance width. That
means that each character is given the same horizontal space on the line. A wide letter such as a
capital "M" and a narrow letter such as a lower case "i" are given the same space. Most typewriters
produce monospaced type, and most computers also can do so using fonts with names such as
"Courier."
This sentence is in a proportionally spaced font; as you can see, the m and i have different
widths.
This sentence is in a monospaced font; as you can see, the m and i have the same width.
The rule requires use of a monospaced typeface that produces no more than 10½ characters
per inch. A standard typewriter with pica type produces a monospaced typeface with 10 characters
per inch (cpi). That is the ideal monospaced typeface. The rule permits up to 10½ cpi because some
computer software programs contain monospaced fonts that purport to produce 10 cpi but that in
fact produce slightly more than 10 cpi. In order to avoid the need to reprint a brief produced in
good faith reliance upon such a program, the rule permits a bit of leeway. A monospace typeface
with no more than 10 cpi is preferred.
Paragraph (a)(6). Type Styles.
The rule requires use of plain roman, that is not italic or script, type. Italics and boldface
may be used for emphasis. Italicizing case names is preferred but underlining may be used.
Paragraph (a)(7). Type-Volume Limitation.
Subparagraph (a)(7)(A) contains a safe-harbor provision. A principal brief that does not
exceed 30 pages complies with the type-volume limitation without further question or
certification. A reply brief that does not exceed 15 pages is similarly treated. The current limit is 50
pages but that limit was established when most briefs were produced on typewriters. The
widespread use of personal computers has made a multitude of printing options available to
practitioners. Use of a proportional typeface alone can greatly increase the amount of material per
page as compared with use of a monospace typeface. Even though the rule requires use of 14-point
proportional type, there is great variation in the x-height of different 14-point typefaces. Selection
of a typeface with a small x-height increases the amount of text per page. Computers also make
possible fine gradations in spacing between lines and tight tracking between letters and words. All
of this, and more, have made the 50-page limit virtually meaningless. Establishing a safe-harbor of
50 pages would permit a person who makes use of the multitude of printing "tricks" available with
most personal computers to file a brief far longer than the "old" 50-page brief. Therefore, as to
those briefs not subject to any other volume control than a page limit, a 30-page limit is imposed.

The limits in subparagraph (B) approximate the current 50-page limit and compliance with
them is easy even for a person without a personal computer. The aim of these provisions is to
create a level playing field. The rule gives every party an equal opportunity to make arguments,
without permitting those with the best in-house typesetting an opportunity to expand their
submissions.
The length can be determined either by counting words or lines. That is, the length of a
brief is determined not by the number of pages but by the number of words or lines in the brief.
This gives every party the same opportunity to present an argument without regard to the typeface
used and eliminates any incentive to use footnotes or typographical "tricks" to squeeze more
material onto a page.
The word counting method can be used with any typeface.
A monospaced brief can meet the volume limitation by using the word or a line count. If
the line counting method is used, the number of lines may not exceed 1,300—26 lines per page in
a 50-page brief. The number of lines is easily counted manually. Line counting is not sufficient if a
proportionally spaced typeface is used, because the amount of material per line can vary widely.
A brief using the type-volume limitations in subparagraph (B) must include a certificate by
the attorney, or party proceeding pro se, that the brief complies with the limitation. The rule
permits the person preparing the certification to rely upon the word or line count of the
word-processing system used to prepare the brief.
Currently, Rule 28(g) governs the length of a brief. Rule 28(g) begins with the words
"[e]xcept by permission of the court," signaling that a party may file a motion to exceed the limits
established in the rule. The absence of similar language in Rule 32 does not mean that the Advisory
Committee intends to prohibit motions to deviate from the requirements of the rule. The Advisory
Committee does not believe that any such language is needed to authorize such a motion.
Subdivision (b). Form of an Appendix.
The provisions governing the form of a brief generally apply to an appendix. The rule
recognizes, however, that an appendix is usually produced by photocopying existing documents.
The rule requires that the photocopies be legible.
The rule permits inclusion not only of documents from the record but also copies of a
printed judicial or agency decision. If a decision that is part of the record in the case has been
published, it is helpful to provide a copy of the published decision in place of a copy of the decision
from the record.
Subdivision (c). Form of Other Papers.
The old rule required a petition for rehearing to be produced in the same manner as a brief
or appendix. The new rule also requires that a petition for rehearing en banc and a response to
either a petition for panel rehearing or a petition for rehearing en banc be prepared in the same
manner. But the length limitations of paragraph (a)(7) do not apply to those documents and a cover
is not required if all the information needed by the court to properly identify the document and the
parties is included in the caption or signature page.
Existing subdivision (b) states that other papers may be produced in like manner, or "they
may be typewritten upon opaque, unglazed paper 8½ by 11 inches in size." The quoted language is
deleted but that method of preparing documents is not eliminated because (a)(5)(B) permits use of
standard pica type. The only change is that the new rule now specifies margins for typewritten
documents.
Subdivision (d). Local Variation.
A brief that complies with the national rule should be acceptable in every court. Local rules

may move in one direction only; they may authorize noncompliance with certain of the national
norms. For example, a court that wishes to do so may authorize printing of briefs on both sides of
the paper, or the use of smaller type size or sans-serif proportional type. A local rule may not,
however, impose requirements that are not in the national rule.
Committee Notes on Rules—2002 Amendment
Subdivision (a)(2). On occasion, a court may permit or order the parties to file
supplemental briefs addressing an issue that was not addressed—or adequately addressed—in the
principal briefs. Rule 32(a)(2) has been amended to require that tan covers be used on such
supplemental briefs. The amendment is intended to promote uniformity in federal appellate
practice. At present, the local rules of the circuit courts conflict. See, e.g., D.C. Cir. R. 28(g)
(requiring yellow covers on supplemental briefs); 11th Cir. R. 32, I.O.P. 1 (requiring white covers
on supplemental briefs).
Changes Made After Publication and Comments. No changes were made to the text of the
proposed amendment or to the Committee Note.
Subdivision (a)(7)(C). If the principal brief of a party exceeds 30 pages, or if the reply brief
of a party exceeds 15 pages, Rule 32(a)(7)(C) provides that the party or the party's attorney must
certify that the brief complies with the type-volume limitation of Rule 32(a)(7)(B). Rule
32(a)(7)(C) has been amended to refer to Form 6 (which has been added to the Appendix of
Forms) and to provide that a party or attorney who uses Form 6 has complied with Rule
32(a)(7)(C). No court may provide to the contrary, in its local rules or otherwise.
Form 6 requests not only the information mandated by Rule 32(a)(7)(C), but also
information that will assist courts in enforcing the typeface requirements of Rule 32(a)(5) and the
type style requirements of Rule 32(a)(6). Parties and attorneys are not required to use Form 6, but
they are encouraged to do so.
Subdivision (c)(2)(A). Under Rule 32(c)(2)(A), a cover is not required on a petition for
panel rehearing, petition for hearing or rehearing en banc, answer to a petition for panel rehearing,
response to a petition for hearing or rehearing en banc, or any other paper. Rule 32(d) makes it
clear that no court can require that a cover be used on any of these papers. However, nothing
prohibits a court from providing in its local rules that if a cover on one of these papers is
"voluntarily" used, it must be a particular color. Several circuits have adopted such local rules. See,
e.g., Fed. Cir. R. 35(c) (requiring yellow covers on petitions for hearing or rehearing en banc and
brown covers on responses to such petitions); Fed. Cir. R. 40(a) (requiring yellow covers on
petitions for panel rehearing and brown covers on answers to such petitions); 7th Cir. R. 28
(requiring blue covers on petitions for rehearing filed by appellants or answers to such petitions,
and requiring red covers on petitions for rehearing filed by appellees or answers to such petitions);
9th Cir. R. 40–1 (requiring blue covers on petitions for panel rehearing filed by appellants and red
covers on answers to such petitions, and requiring red covers on petitions for panel rehearing filed
by appellees and blue covers on answers to such petitions); 11th Cir. R. 35–6 (requiring white
covers on petitions for hearing or rehearing en banc).
These conflicting local rules create a hardship for counsel who practice in more than one
circuit. For that reason, Rule 32(c)(2)(A) has been amended to provide that if a party chooses to
use a cover on a paper that is not required to have one, that cover must be white. The amendment is
intended to preempt all local rulemaking on the subject of cover colors and thereby promote
uniformity in federal appellate practice.
Changes Made After Publication and Comments. No changes were made to the text of the

proposed amendment or to the Committee Note.
Subdivisions (d) and (e). Former subdivision (d) has been redesignated as subdivision (e),
and a new subdivision (d) has been added. The new subdivision (d) requires that every brief,
motion, or other paper filed with the court be signed by the attorney or unrepresented party who
files it, much as Fed. R. Civ. P. 11(a) imposes a signature requirement on papers filed in district
court. Only the original copy of every paper must be signed. An appendix filed with the court does
not have to be signed at all.
By requiring a signature, subdivision (d) ensures that a readily identifiable attorney or
party takes responsibility for every paper. The courts of appeals already have authority to sanction
attorneys and parties who file papers that contain misleading or frivolous assertions, see, e.g., 28
U.S.C. §1912, Fed. R. App. P. 38 & 46(b)(1)(B), and thus subdivision (d) has not been amended to
incorporate provisions similar to those found in Fed. R. Civ. P. 11(b) and 11(c).
Changes Made After Publication and Comments. No changes were made to the text of the
proposed amendment. A line was added to the Committee Note to clarify that only the original
copy of a paper needs to be signed.
Committee Notes on Rules—2005 Amendment
Subdivision (a)(7)(C). Rule 32(a)(7)(C) has been amended to add cross-references to new
Rule 28.1, which governs briefs filed in cases involving cross-appeals. Rule 28.1(e)(2) prescribes
type-volume limitations that apply to such briefs, and Rule 28.1(e)(3) requires parties to certify
compliance with those type-volume limitations under Rule 32(a)(7)(C).

Rule 32.1. Citing Judicial Dispositions
(a) Citation Permitted. A court may not prohibit or restrict the citation of federal judicial
opinions, orders, judgments, or other written dispositions that have been:
(i) designated as "unpublished," "not for publication," "non-precedential," "not precedent,"
or the like; and
(ii) issued on or after January 1, 2007.
(b) Copies Required. If a party cites a federal judicial opinion, order, judgment, or other
written disposition that is not available in a publicly accessible electronic database, the party must
file and serve a copy of that opinion, order, judgment, or disposition with the brief or other paper in
which it is cited.
(As added Apr. 12, 2006, eff. Dec. 1, 2006.)
Committee Notes on Rules—2006
Rule 32.1 is a new rule addressing the citation of judicial opinions, orders, judgments, or
other written dispositions that have been designated by a federal court as "unpublished," "not for
publication," "non-precedential," "not precedent," or the like. This Committee Note will refer to
these dispositions collectively as"unpublished" opinions.
Rule 32.1 is extremely limited. It does not require any court to issue an unpublished
opinion or forbid any court from doing so. It does not dictate the circumstances under which a
court may choose to designate an opinion as "unpublished" or specify the procedure that a court

must follow in making that determination. It says nothing about what effect a court must give to
one of its unpublished opinions or to the unpublished opinions of another court. Rule 32.1
addresses only the citation of federal judicial dispositions that have been designated as
"unpublished" or "non-precedential"—whether or not those dispositions have been published in
some way or are precedential in some sense.
Subdivision (a). Every court of appeals has allowed unpublished opinions to be cited in
some circumstances, such as to support a contention of issue preclusion or claim preclusion. But
the circuits have differed dramatically with respect to the restrictions that they have placed on the
citation of unpublished opinions for their persuasive value. Some circuits have freely permitted
such citation, others have discouraged it but permitted it in limited circumstances, and still others
have forbidden it altogether.
Rule 32.1(a) is intended to replace these inconsistent standards with one uniform rule.
Under Rule 32.1(a), a court of appeals may not prohibit a party from citing an unpublished opinion
of a federal court for its persuasive value or for any other reason. In addition, under Rule 32.1(a), a
court may not place any restriction on the citation of such opinions. For example, a court may not
instruct parties that the citation of unpublished opinions is discouraged, nor may a court forbid
parties to cite unpublished opinions when a published opinion addresses the same issue.
Rule 32.1(a) applies only to unpublished opinions issued on or after January 1, 2007. The
citation of unpublished opinions issued before January 1, 2007, will continue to be governed by the
local rules of the circuits.
Subdivision (b). Under Rule 32.1(b), a party who cites an opinion of a federal court must
provide a copy of that opinion to the court of appeals and to the other parties, unless that opinion is
available in a publicly accessible electronic database—such as a commercial database maintained
by a legal research service or a database maintained by a court. A party who is required under
Rule32.1(b) to provide a copy of an opinion must file and serve the copy with the brief or other
paper in which the opinion is cited. Rule 32.1(b) applies to all unpublished opinions, regardless of
when they were issued.
Changes Made After Publication and Comment. (At its June 15–16, 2005, meeting, the
Standing Rules Committee with the advisory committee chair's concurrence agreed to delete
sections of the Committee Note, which provided background information on the justification of
the proposal.) The changes made by the Advisory Committee after publication are described in my
May 14, 2004 report to the Standing Committee. At its April 2005 meeting, the Advisory
Committee directed that two additional changes be made.
First, the Committee decided to add "federal" before "judicial opinions" in subdivision (a)
and before "judicial opinion" in subdivision (b) to make clear that Rule 32.1 applies only to the
unpublished opinions of federal courts. Conforming changes were made to the Committee Note.
These changes address the concern of some state court judges—conveyed by Chief Justice Wells
at the June 2004 Standing Committee meeting—that Rule 32.1 might have an impact on state law.
Second, the Committee decided to insert into the Committee Note references to the studies
conducted by the Federal Judicial Center ("FJC") and the Administrative Office ("AO"). (The
studies are described below. [Omitted]) These references make clear that the arguments of Rule
32.1's opponents were taken seriously and studied carefully, but ultimately rejected because they
were unsupported by or, in some instances, actually refuted by the best available empirical
evidence.

Rule 33. Appeal Conferences

The court may direct the attorneys—and, when appropriate, the parties—to participate in
one or more conferences to address any matter that may aid in disposing of the proceedings,
including simplifying the issues and discussing settlement. A judge or other person designated by
the court may preside over the conference, which may be conducted in person or by telephone.
Before a settlement conference, the attorneys must consult with their clients and obtain as much
authority as feasible to settle the case. The court may, as a result of the conference, enter an order
controlling the course of the proceedings or implementing any settlement agreement.
(As amended Apr. 29, 1994, eff. Dec. 1, 1994; Apr. 24, 1998, eff. Dec. 1, 1998.)
Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules—1967
The uniform rule for review or enforcement of orders of administrative agencies, boards,
commissions or officers (see the general note following Rule 15) authorizes a prehearing
conference in agency review proceedings. The same considerations which make a prehearing
conference desirable in such proceedings may be present in certain cases on appeal from the
district courts. The proposed rule is based upon subdivision 11 of the present uniform rule for
review of agency orders.
Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules—1994 Amendment
Rule 33 has been entirely rewritten. The new rule makes several changes.
The caption of the rule has been changed from "Prehearing Conference" to "Appeal
Conferences" to reflect the fact that occasionally a conference is held after oral argument.
The rule permits the court to require the parties to attend the conference in appropriate
cases. The Committee does not contemplate that attendance of the parties will become routine, but
in certain instances the parties' presence can be useful. The language of the rule is broad enough to
allow a court to determine that an executive or employee (other than the general counsel) of a
corporation or government agency with authority regarding the matter at issue, constitutes "the
party."
The rule includes the possibility of settlement among the possible conference topics.
The rule recognizes that conferences are often held by telephone.
The rule allows a judge or other person designated by the court to preside over a
conference. A number of local rules permit persons other than judges to preside over conferences.
1st Cir. R. 47.5; 6th Cir. R. 18; 8th Cir. R. 33A; 9th Cir. R. 33–1; and 10th Cir. R. 33.
The rule requires an attorney to consult with his or her client before a settlement conference
and obtain as much authority as feasible to settle the case. An attorney can never settle a case
without his or her client's consent. Certain entities, especially government entities, have particular
difficulty obtaining authority to settle a case. The rule requires counsel to obtain only as much
authority "as feasible."
Committee Notes on Rules—1998 Amendment
The language of the rule is amended to make the rule more easily understood. In addition to
changes made to improve the understanding, the Advisory Committee has changed language to
make style and terminology consistent throughout the appellate rules. These changes are intended
to be stylistic only.

Rule 34. Oral Argument
(a) In General.
(1) Party's Statement. Any party may file, or a court may require by local rule, a statement
explaining why oral argument should, or need not, be permitted.
(2) Standards. Oral argument must be allowed in every case unless a panel of three judges
who have examined the briefs and record unanimously agrees that oral argument is unnecessary
for any of the following reasons:
(A) the appeal is frivolous;
(B) the dispositive issue or issues have been authoritatively decided; or
(C) the facts and legal arguments are adequately presented in the briefs and record, and the
decisional process would not be significantly aided by oral argument.
(b) Notice of Argument; Postponement. The clerk must advise all parties whether oral
argument will be scheduled, and, if so, the date, time, and place for it, and the time allowed for
each side. A motion to postpone the argument or to allow longer argument must be filed
reasonably in advance of the hearing date.
(c) Order and Contents of Argument. The appellant opens and concludes the argument.
Counsel must not read at length from briefs, records, or authorities.
(d) Cross-Appeals and Separate Appeals. If there is a cross-appeal, Rule 28.1(b)
determines which party is the appellant and which is the appellee for purposes of oral argument.
Unless the court directs otherwise, a cross-appeal or separate appeal must be argued when the
initial appeal is argued. Separate parties should avoid duplicative argument.
(e) Nonappearance of a Party. If the appellee fails to appear for argument, the court must
hear appellant's argument. If the appellant fails to appear for argument, the court may hear the
appellee's argument. If neither party appears, the case will be decided on the briefs, unless the
court orders otherwise.
(f) Submission on Briefs. The parties may agree to submit a case for decision on the briefs,
but the court may direct that the case be argued.
(g) Use of Physical Exhibits at Argument; Removal. Counsel intending to use physical
exhibits other than documents at the argument must arrange to place them in the courtroom on the
day of the argument before the court convenes. After the argument, counsel must remove the
exhibits from the courtroom, unless the court directs otherwise. The clerk may destroy or dispose
of the exhibits if counsel does not reclaim them within a reasonable time after the clerk gives
notice to remove them.
(As amended Apr. 1, 1979, eff. Aug. 1, 1979; Mar. 10, 1986, eff. July 1, 1986; Apr. 30,
1991, eff. Dec. 1, 1991; Apr. 22, 1993, eff. Dec. 1, 1993; Apr. 24, 1998, eff. Dec. 1, 1998; Apr. 25,
2005, eff. Dec. 1, 2005.)
Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules—1967
A majority of circuits now limit oral argument to thirty minutes for each side, with the
provision that additional time may be made available upon request. The Committee is of the view
that thirty minutes to each side is sufficient in most cases, but that where additional time is
necessary it should be freely granted on a proper showing of cause therefor. It further feels that the

matter of time should be left ultimately to each court of appeals, subject to the spirit of the rule that
a reasonable time should be allowed for argument. The term "side" is used to indicate that the time
allowed by the rule is afforded to opposing interests rather than to individual parties. Thus if
multiple appellants or appellees have a common interest, they constitute only a single side. If
counsel for multiple parties who constitute a single side feel that additional time is necessary, they
may request it. In other particulars this rule follows the usual practice among the circuits. See 3d
Cir. Rule 31; 6th Cir. Rule 20; 10th Cir. Rule 23.
Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules—1979 Amendment
The proposed amendment, patterned after the recommendations in the Report of the
Commission on Revision of the Federal Court Appellate System, Structure and Internal
Procedures: Recommendations for Change, 1975, created by Public Law 489 of the 92nd Cong.
2nd Sess., 86 Stat. 807, sets forth general principles and minimum standards to be observed in
formulating any local rule.
Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules—1986 Amendment
The amendments to Rules 34(a) and (e) are technical. No substantive change is intended.
Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules—1991 Amendment
Subdivision (d). The amendment of subdivision (d) conforms this rule with the amendment
of Rule 28(h).
Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules—1993 Amendment
Subdivision (c). The amendment deletes the requirement that the opening argument must
include a fair statement of the case. The Committee proposed the change because in some circuits
the court does not want appellants to give such statements. In those circuits, the rule is not
followed and is misleading. Nevertheless, the Committee does not want the deletion of the
requirement to indicate disapproval of the practice. Those circuits that desire a statement of the
case may continue the practice.
Committee Notes on Rules—1998 Amendment
The language of the rule is amended to make the rule more easily understood. In addition to
changes made to improve the understanding, the Advisory Committee has changed language to
make style and terminology consistent throughout the appellate rules. These changes are intended
to be stylistic only. Substantive changes are made in subdivision (a).
Subdivision (a). Currently subdivision (a) says that oral argument must be permitted
unless, applying a local rule, a panel of three judges unanimously agrees that oral argument is not
necessary. Rule 34 then outlines the criteria to be used to determine whether oral argument is
needed and requires any local rule to "conform substantially" to the "minimum standard[s]"
established in the national rule. The amendments omit the local rule requirement and make the
criteria applicable by force of the national rule. The local rule is an unnecessary instrument.
Paragraph (a)(2) states that one reason for deciding that oral argument is unnecessary is

that the dispositive issue has been authoritatively decided. The amended language no longer states
that the issue must have been "recently" decided. The Advisory Committee does not intend any
substantive change, but thinks that the use of "recently" may be misleading.
Subdivision (d). A cross-reference to Rule 28(h) has been substituted for a reiteration of the
provisions of Rule 28(h).
Committee Notes on Rules—2005 Amendment
Subdivision (d). A cross-reference in subdivision (d) has been changed to reflect the fact
that, as part of an effort to collect within one rule all provisions regarding briefing in cases
involving cross-appeals, former Rule 28(h) has been abrogated and its contents moved to new Rule
28.1(b).

Rule 35. En Banc Determination
(a) When Hearing or Rehearing En Banc May Be Ordered. A majority of the circuit judges
who are in regular active service and who are not disqualified may order that an appeal or other
proceeding be heard or reheard by the court of appeals en banc. An en banc hearing or rehearing is
not favored and ordinarily will not be ordered unless:
(1) en banc consideration is necessary to secure or maintain uniformity of the court's
decisions; or
(2) the proceeding involves a question of exceptional importance.
(b) Petition for Hearing or Rehearing En Banc. A party may petition for a hearing or
rehearing en banc.
(1) The petition must begin with a statement that either:
(A) the panel decision conflicts with a decision of the United States Supreme Court or of
the court to which the petition is addressed (with citation to the conflicting case or cases) and
consideration by the full court is therefore necessary to secure and maintain uniformity of the
court's decisions; or
(B) the proceeding involves one or more questions of exceptional importance, each of
which must be concisely stated; for example, a petition may assert that a proceeding presents a
question of exceptional importance if it involves an issue on which the panel decision conflicts
with the authoritative decisions of other United States Courts of Appeals that have addressed the
issue.
(2) Except by the court's permission, a petition for an en banc hearing or rehearing must not
exceed 15 pages, excluding material not counted under Rule 32.
(3) For purposes of the page limit in Rule 35(b)(2), if a party files both a petition for panel
rehearing and a petition for rehearing en banc, they are considered a single document even if they
are filed separately, unless separate filing is required by local rule.
(c) Time for Petition for Hearing or Rehearing En Banc. A petition that an appeal be heard
initially en banc must be filed by the date when the appellee's brief is due. A petition for a
rehearing en banc must be filed within the time prescribed by Rule 40 for filing a petition for
rehearing.

(d) Number of Copies. The number of copies to be filed must be prescribed by local rule
and may be altered by order in a particular case.
(e) Response. No response may be filed to a petition for an en banc consideration unless the
court orders a response.
(f) Call for a Vote. A vote need not be taken to determine whether the case will be heard or
reheard en banc unless a judge calls for a vote.
(As amended Apr. 1, 1979, eff. Aug. 1, 1979; Apr. 29, 1994, eff. Dec. 1, 1994; Apr. 24,
1998, eff. Dec. 1, 1998; Apr. 25, 2005, eff. Dec. 1, 2005.)
Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules—1967
Statutory authority for in banc hearings is found in 28 U.S.C. §46(c). The proposed rule is
responsive to the Supreme Court's view in Western Pacific Ry. Corp. v. Western Pacific Ry. Co.,
345 U.S. 247, 73 S.Ct. 656, 97 L.Ed. 986 (1953), that litigants should be free to suggest that a
particular case is appropriate for consideration by all the judges of a court of appeals. The rule is
addressed to the procedure whereby a party may suggest the appropriateness of convening the
court in banc. It does not affect the power of a court of appeals to initiate in banc hearings sua
sponte.
The provision that a vote will not be taken as a result of the suggestion of the party unless
requested by a judge of the court in regular active service or by a judge who was a member of the
panel that rendered a decision sought to be reheard is intended to make it clear that a suggestion of
a party as such does not require any action by the court. See Western Pacific Ry. Corp. v. Western
Pacific Ry. Co., supra, 345 U.S. at 262, 73 S.Ct. 656. The rule merely authorizes a suggestion,
imposes a time limit on suggestions for rehearings in banc, and provides that suggestions will be
directed to the judges of the court in regular active service.
In practice, the suggestion of a party that a case be reheard in banc is frequently contained
in a petition for rehearing, commonly styled "petition for rehearing in banc." Such a petition is in
fact merely a petition for a rehearing, with a suggestion that the case be reheard in banc. Since no
response to the suggestion, as distinguished from the petition for rehearing, is required, the panel
which heard the case may quite properly dispose of the petition without reference to the
suggestion. In such a case the fact that no response has been made to the suggestion does not affect
the finality of the judgment or the issuance of the mandate, and the final sentence of the rule
expressly so provides.
Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules—1979 Amendment
Under the present rule there is no specific provision for a response to a suggestion that an
appeal be heard in banc. This has led to some uncertainty as to whether such a response may be
filed. The proposed amendment would resolve this uncertainty.
While the present rule provides a time limit for suggestions for rehearing in banc, it does
not deal with the timing of a request that the appeal be heard in banc initially. The proposed
amendment fills this gap as well, providing that the suggestion must be made by the date of which
the appellee's brief is filed.
Provision is made for circulating the suggestions to members of the panel despite the fact
that senior judges on the panel would not be entitled to vote on whether a suggestion will be
granted.
Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules—1994 Amendment

Subdivision (d). Subdivision (d) is added; it authorizes the courts of appeals to prescribe the
number of copies of suggestions for hearing or rehearing in banc that must be filed. Because the
number of copies needed depends directly upon the number of judges in the circuit, local rules are
the best vehicle for setting the required number of copies.
Committee Notes on Rules—1998 Amendment
The language and organization of the rule are amended to make the rule more easily
understood. In addition to changes made to improve the understanding, the Advisory Committee
has changed language to make style and terminology consistent throughout the appellate rules.
These changes are intended to be stylistic only.
Several substantive changes are made in this rule, however.
One of the purposes of the substantive amendments is to treat a request for a rehearing en
banc like a petition for panel rehearing so that a request for a rehearing en banc will suspend the
finality of the court of appeals' judgment and delay the running of the period for filing a petition for
writ of certiorari. Companion amendments are made to Rule 41.
Subdivision (a). The title of this subdivision is changed from "when hearing or rehearing in
banc will be ordered" to "When Hearing or Rehearing En Banc May Be Ordered." The change
emphasizes the discretion a court has with regard to granting en banc review.
Subdivision (b). The term "petition" for rehearing en banc is substituted for the term
"suggestion" for rehearing en banc. The terminology change reflects the Committee's intent to
treat similarly a petition for panel rehearing and a request for a rehearing en banc. The terminology
change also delays the running of the time for filing a petition for a writ of certiorari because Sup.
Ct. R. 13.3 says:
if a petition for rehearing is timely filed in the lower court by any party, the time to file the
petition for a writ of certiorari for all parties . . . runs from the date of the denial of the petition for
rehearing or, if the petition for rehearing is granted, the subsequent entry of judgment.
The amendments also require each petition for en banc consideration to begin with a
statement concisely demonstrating that the case meets the usual criteria for en banc consideration.
It is the Committee's hope that requiring such a statement will cause the drafter of a petition to
focus on the narrow grounds that support en banc consideration and to realize that a petition should
not be filed unless the case meets those rigid standards.
Intercircuit conflict is cited as one reason for asserting that a proceeding involves a
question of "exceptional importance." Intercircuit conflicts create problems. When the circuits
construe the same federal law differently, parties' rights and duties depend upon where a case is
litigated. Given the increase in the number of cases decided by the federal courts and the limitation
on the number of cases the Supreme Court can hear, conflicts between the circuits may remain
unresolved by the Supreme Court for an extended period of time. The existence of an intercircuit
conflict often generates additional litigation in the other circuits as well as in the circuits that are
already in conflict. Although an en banc proceeding will not necessarily prevent intercircuit
conflicts, an en banc proceeding provides a safeguard against unnecessary intercircuit conflicts.
Some circuits have had rules or internal operating procedures that recognize a conflict with
another circuit as a legitimate basis for granting a rehearing en banc. An intercircuit conflict may
present a question of "exceptional importance" because of the costs that intercircuit conflicts
impose on the system as a whole, in addition to the significance of the issues involved. It is not,

however, the Committee's intent to make the granting of a hearing or rehearing en banc mandatory
whenever there is an intercircuit conflict.
The amendment states that "a petition may assert that a proceeding presents a question of
exceptional importance if it involves an issue on which the panel decision conflicts with the
authoritative decisions of every other United States Court of Appeals that has addressed the issue."
[The Supreme Court revised the proposed amendment to Rule 35(b)(1)(B) by deleting "every"
before "other United States Court of Appeals".] That language contemplates two situations in
which a rehearing en banc may be appropriate. The first is when a panel decision creates a conflict.
A panel decision creates a conflict when it conflicts with the decisions of all other circuits that
have considered the issue. If a panel decision simply joins one side of an already existing conflict,
a rehearing en banc may not be as important because it cannot avoid the conflict. The second
situation that may be a strong candidate for a rehearing en banc is one in which the circuit persists
in a conflict created by a pre-existing decision of the same circuit and no other circuits have joined
on that side of the conflict. The amendment states that the conflict must be with an "authoritative"
decision of another circuit. "Authoritative" is used rather than "published" because in some circuits
unpublished opinions may be treated as authoritative.
Counsel are reminded that their duty is fully discharged without filing a petition for
rehearing en banc unless the case meets the rigid standards of subdivision (a) of this rule and even
then the granting of a petition is entirely within the court's discretion.
Paragraph (2) of this subdivision establishes a maximum length for a petition. Fifteen
pages is the length currently used in several circuits. Each request for en banc consideration must
be studied by every active judge of the court and is a serious call on limited judicial resources. The
extraordinary nature of the issue or the threat to uniformity of the court's decision can be
established in most cases in less than fifteen pages. A court may shorten the maximum length on a
case by case basis but the rule does not permit a circuit to shorten the length by local rule. The
Committee has retained page limits rather than using word or line counts similar to those in
amended Rule 32 because there has not been a serious enough problem to justify importing the
word and line-count and typeface requirements that are applicable to briefs into other contexts.
Paragraph (3), although similar to (2), is separate because it deals with those instances in
which a party files both a petition for rehearing en banc under this rule and a petition for panel
rehearing under Rule 40.
To improve the clarity of the rule, the material dealing with filing a response to a petition
and with voting on a petition have been moved to new subdivisions (e) and (f).
Subdivision (c). Two changes are made in this subdivision. First, the sentence stating that a
request for a rehearing en banc does not affect the finality of the judgment or stay the issuance of
the mandate is deleted. Second, the language permitting a party to include a request for rehearing
en banc in a petition for panel rehearing is deleted. The Committee believes that those circuits that
want to require two separate documents should have the option to do so.
Subdivision (e). This is a new subdivision. The substance of the subdivision, however, was
drawn from former subdivision (b). The only changes are stylistic; no substantive changes are
intended.
Subdivision (f). This is a new subdivision. The substance of the subdivision, however, was
drawn from former subdivision (b).
Because of the discretionary nature of the en banc procedure, the filing of a suggestion for
rehearing en banc has not required a vote; a vote is taken only when requested by a judge. It is not
the Committee's intent to change the discretionary nature of the procedure or to require a vote on a

petition for rehearing en banc. The rule continues, therefore, to provide that a court is not obligated
to vote on such petitions. It is necessary, however, that each court develop a procedure for
disposing of such petitions because they will suspend the finality of the court's judgment and toll
the time for filing a petition for certiorari.
Former subdivision (b) contained language directing the clerk to distribute a "suggestion"
to certain judges and indicating which judges may call for a vote. New subdivision (f) does not
address those issues because they deal with internal court procedures.
Committee Notes on Rules—2005 Amendment
Subdivision (a). Two national standards—28 U.S.C. §46(c) and Rule 35(a)—provide that a
hearing or rehearing en banc may be ordered by "a majority of the circuit judges who are in regular
active service." Although these standards apply to all of the courts of appeals, the circuits are
deeply divided over the interpretation of this language when one or more active judges are
disqualified.
The Supreme Court has never addressed this issue. In Shenker v. Baltimore & Ohio R.R.
Co., 374 U.S. 1 (1963), the Court rejected a petitioner's claim that his rights under §46(c) had been
violated when the Third Circuit refused to rehear his case en banc. The Third Circuit had 8 active
judges at the time; 4 voted in favor of rehearing the case, 2 against, and 2 abstained. No judge was
disqualified. The Supreme Court ruled against the petitioner, holding, in essence, that §46(c) did
not provide a cause of action, but instead simply gave litigants "the right to know the
administrative machinery that will be followed and the right to suggest that the en banc procedure
be set in motion in his case." Id. at 5. Shenker did stress that a court of appeals has broad discretion
in establishing internal procedures to handle requests for rehearings—or, as Shenker put it, " 'to
devise its own administrative machinery to provide the means whereby a majority may order such
a hearing.' " Id. (quoting Western Pac. R.R. Corp. v. Western Pac. R.R. Co., 345 U.S. 247, 250
(1953) (emphasis added)). But Shenker did not address what is meant by "a majority" in §46(c) (or
Rule 35(a), which did not yet exist)—and Shenker certainly did not suggest that the phrase should
have different meanings in different circuits.
In interpreting that phrase, 7 of the courts of appeals follow the "absolute majority"
approach. See Marie Leary, Defining the "Majority" Vote Requirement in Federal Rule of
Appellate Procedure 35(a) for Rehearings En Banc in the United States Courts of Appeals 8 tbl.1
(Federal Judicial Center 2002). Under this approach, disqualified judges are counted in the base in
calculating whether a majority of judges have voted to hear a case en banc. Thus, in a circuit with
12 active judges, 7 must vote to hear a case en banc. If 5 of the 12 active judges are disqualified, all
7 non-disqualified judges must vote to hear the case en banc. The votes of 6 of the 7
non-disqualified judges are not enough, as 6 is not a majority of 12.
Six of the courts of appeals follow the "case majority" approach. Id. Under this approach,
disqualified judges are not counted in the base in calculating whether a majority of judges have
voted to hear a case en banc. Thus, in a case in which 5 of a circuit's 12 active judges are
disqualified, only 4 judges (a majority of the 7 non-disqualified judges) must vote to hear a case en
banc. (The First and Third Circuits explicitly qualify the case majority approach by providing that
a case cannot be heard en banc unless a majority of all active judges—disqualified and
non-disqualified—are eligible to participate.)
Rule 35(a) has been amended to adopt the case majority approach as a uniform national
interpretation of §46(c). The federal rules of practice and procedure exist to "maintain
consistency," which Congress has equated with "promot[ing] the interest of justice." 28 U.S.C.

§2073(b). The courts of appeals should not follow two inconsistent approaches in deciding
whether sufficient votes exist to hear a case en banc, especially when there is a governing statute
and governing rule that apply to all circuits and that use identical terms, and especially when there
is nothing about the local conditions of each circuit that justifies conflicting approaches.
The case majority approach represents the better interpretation of the phrase "the circuit
judges . . . in regular active service" in the first sentence of §46(c). The second sentence of
§46(c)—which defines which judges are eligible to participate in a case being heard or reheard en
banc—uses the similar expression "all circuit judges in regular active service." It is clear that "all
circuit judges in regular active service" in the second sentence does not include disqualified
judges, as disqualified judges clearly cannot participate in a case being heard or reheard en banc.
Therefore, assuming that two nearly identical phrases appearing in adjacent sentences in a statute
should be interpreted in the same way, the best reading of "the circuit judges . . . in regular active
service" in the first sentence of §46(c) is that it, too, does not include disqualified judges.
This interpretation of §46(c) is bolstered by the fact that the case majority approach has at
least two major advantages over the absolute majority approach:
First, under the absolute majority approach, a disqualified judge is, as a practical matter,
counted as voting against hearing a case en banc. This defeats the purpose of recusal. To the extent
possible, the disqualification of a judge should not result in the equivalent of a vote for or against
hearing a case en banc.
Second, the absolute majority approach can leave the en banc court helpless to overturn a
panel decision with which almost all of the circuit's active judges disagree. For example, in a case
in which 5 of a circuit's 12 active judges are disqualified, the case cannot be heard en banc even if
6 of the 7 non-disqualified judges strongly disagree with the panel opinion. This permits one active
judge—perhaps sitting on a panel with a visiting judge—effectively to control circuit precedent,
even over the objection of all of his or her colleagues. See Gulf Power Co. v. FCC, 226 F.3d 1220,
1222–23 (11th Cir. 2000) (Carnes, J., concerning the denial of reh'g en banc), rev'd sub nom.
National Cable & Telecomm. Ass'n, Inc. v. Gulf Power Co., 534 U.S. 327 (2002). Even though the
en banc court may, in a future case, be able to correct an erroneous legal interpretation, the en banc
court will never be able to correct the injustice inflicted by the panel on the parties to the case.
Morever [sic], it may take many years before sufficient non-disqualified judges can be mustered to
overturn the panel's erroneous legal interpretation. In the meantime, the lower courts of the circuit
must apply—and the citizens of the circuit must conform their behavior to—an interpretation of
the law that almost all of the circuit's active judges believe is incorrect.
The amendment to Rule 35(a) is not meant to alter or affect the quorum requirement of 28
U.S.C. §46(d). In particular, the amendment is not intended to foreclose the possibility that §46(d)
might be read to require that more than half of all circuit judges in regular active service be eligible
to participate in order for the court to hear or rehear a case en banc.
Changes Made After Publication and Comments. No changes were made to the text of the
proposed amendment. The Committee Note was modified in three respects. First, the Note was
changed to put more emphasis on the fact that the case majority rule is the best interpretation of
§46(c). Second, the Note now clarifies that nothing in the proposed amendment is intended to
foreclose courts from interpreting 28 U.S.C. §46(d) to provide that a case cannot be heard or
reheard en banc unless a majority of all judges in regular active service—disqualified or not—are
eligible to participate. Finally, a couple of arguments made by supporters of the amendment to
Rule 35(a) were incorporated into the Note.

Rule 36. Entry of Judgment; Notice

(a) Entry. A judgment is entered when it is noted on the docket. The clerk must prepare,
sign, and enter the judgment:
(1) after receiving the court's opinion—but if settlement of the judgment's form is required,
after final settlement; or
(2) if a judgment is rendered without an opinion, as the court instructs.
(b) Notice. On the date when judgment is entered, the clerk must serve on all parties a copy
of the opinion—or the judgment, if no opinion was written—and a notice of the date when the
judgment was entered.
(As amended Apr. 24, 1998, eff. Dec. 1, 1998; Apr. 29, 2002, eff. Dec. 1, 2002.)
Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules—1967
This is the typical rule. See 1st Cir. Rule 29; 3rd Cir. Rule 32; 6th Cir. Rule 21. At present,
uncertainty exists as to the date of entry of judgment when the opinion directs subsequent
settlement of the precise terms of the judgment, a common practice in cases involving enforcement
of agency orders. See Stern and Gressman, Supreme Court Practice, p. 203 (3d Ed., 1962). The
principle of finality suggests that in such cases entry of judgment should be delayed until approval
of the judgment in final form.
Committee Notes on Rules—1998 Amendment
The language and organization of the rule are amended to make the rule more easily
understood. In addition to changes made to improve the understanding, the Advisory Committee
has changed language to make style and terminology consistent throughout the appellate rules.

Committee Notes on Rules—2002 Amendment
Subdivision (b). Subdivision (b) has been amended so that the clerk may use electronic
means to serve a copy of the opinion or judgment or to serve notice of the date when judgment was
entered upon parties who have consented to such service.
Changes Made After Publication and Comments. No changes were made to the text of the
proposed amendment or to the Committee Note.

Rule 37. Interest on Judgment
(a) When the Court Affirms. Unless the law provides otherwise, if a money judgment in a
civil case is affirmed, whatever interest is allowed by law is payable from the date when the district
court's judgment was entered.
(b) When the Court Reverses. If the court modifies or reverses a judgment with a direction
that a money judgment be entered in the district court, the mandate must contain instructions about
the allowance of interest.
(As amended Apr. 24, 1998, eff. Dec. 1, 1998.)

Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules—1967

The first sentence makes it clear that if a money judgment is affirmed in the court of
appeals, the interest which attaches to money judgments by force of law (see 28 U.S.C. §1961 and
§2411) upon their initial entry is payable as if no appeal had been taken, whether or not the
mandate makes mention of interest. There has been some confusion on this point. See Blair v.
Durham, 139 F.2d 260 (6th Cir., 1943) and cases cited therein.
In reversing or modifying the judgment of the district court, the court of appeals may direct
the entry of a money judgment, as, for example, when the court of appeals reverses a judgment
notwithstanding the verdict and directs entry of judgment on the verdict. In such a case the
question may arise as to whether interest is to run from the date of entry of the judgment directed
by the court of appeals or from the date on which the judgment would have been entered in the
district court except for the erroneous ruling corrected on appeal. In Briggs v. Pennsylvania R. Co.,
334 U.S. 304, 68 S.Ct. 1039, 92 L.Ed. 1403 (1948), the Court held that where the mandate of the
court of appeals directed entry of judgment upon a verdict but made no mention of interest from
the date of the verdict to the date of the entry of the judgment directed by the mandate, the district
court was powerless to add such interest. The second sentence of the proposed rule is a reminder to
the court, the clerk and counsel of the Briggs rule. Since the rule directs that the matter of interest
be disposed of by the mandate, in cases where interest is simply overlooked, a party who conceives
himself entitled to interest from a date other than the date of entry of judgment in accordance with
the mandate should be entitled to seek recall of the mandate for determination of the question.
Committee Notes on Rules—1998 Amendment

Rule 38. Frivolous Appeal—Damages and Costs
If a court of appeals determines that an appeal is frivolous, it may, after a separately filed
motion or notice from the court and reasonable opportunity to respond, award just damages and
single or double costs to the appellee.
(As amended Apr. 29, 1994, eff. Dec. 1, 1994; Apr. 24, 1998, eff. Dec. 1, 1998.)
Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules—1967
Compare 28 U.S.C. §1912. While both the statute and the usual rule on the subject by
courts of appeals (Fourth Circuit Rule 20 is a typical rule) speak of "damages for delay," the courts
of appeals quite properly allow damages, attorney's fees and other expenses incurred by an
appellee if the appeal is frivolous without requiring a showing that the appeal resulted in delay. See
Dunscombe v. Sayle, 340 F.2d 311 (5th Cir., 1965), cert. den., 382 U.S. 814, 86 S.Ct. 32, 15
L.Ed.2d 62 (1965); Lowe v. Willacy, 239 F.2d 179 (9th Cir., 1956); Griffith Wellpoint Corp. v.
Munro-Langstroth, Inc., 269 F.2d 64 (1st Cir., 1959); Ginsburg v. Stern, 295 F.2d 698 (3d Cir.,

1961). The subjects of interest and damages are separately regulated, contrary to the present
practice of combining the two (see Fourth Circuit Rule 20) to make it clear that the awards are
distinct and independent. Interest is provided for by law; damages are awarded by the court in its
discretion in the case of a frivolous appeal as a matter of justice to the appellee and as a penalty
against the appellant.
Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules—1994 Amendment
The amendment requires that before a court of appeals may impose sanctions, the person to
be sanctioned must have notice and an opportunity to respond. The amendment reflects the basic
principle enunciated in the Supreme Court's opinion in Roadway Express, Inc. v. Piper, 447 U.S.
752, 767 (1980), that notice and opportunity to respond must precede the imposition of sanctions.
A separately filed motion requesting sanctions constitutes notice. A statement inserted in a party's
brief that the party moves for sanctions is not sufficient notice. Requests in briefs for sanctions
have become so commonplace that it is unrealistic to expect careful responses to such requests
without any indication that the court is actually contemplating such measures. Only a motion, the
purpose of which is to request sanctions, is sufficient. If there is no such motion filed, notice must
come from the court. The form of notice from the court and of the opportunity for comment
purposely are left to the court's discretion.
Committee Notes on Rules—1998 Amendment
Only the caption of this rule has been amended. The changes are intended to be stylistic
only.

Rule 39. Costs
(a) Against Whom Assessed. The following rules apply unless the law provides or the court
orders otherwise:
(1) if an appeal is dismissed, costs are taxed against the appellant, unless the parties agree
otherwise;
(2) if a judgment is affirmed, costs are taxed against the appellant;
(3) if a judgment is reversed, costs are taxed against the appellee;
(4) if a judgment is affirmed in part, reversed in part, modified, or vacated, costs are taxed
only as the court orders.
(b) Costs For and Against the United States. Costs for or against the United States, its
agency, or officer will be assessed under Rule 39(a) only if authorized by law.
(c) Costs of Copies. Each court of appeals must, by local rule, fix the maximum rate for
taxing the cost of producing necessary copies of a brief or appendix, or copies of records
authorized by Rule 30(f). The rate must not exceed that generally charged for such work in the area
where the clerk's office is located and should encourage economical methods of copying.
(d) Bill of Costs: Objections; Insertion in Mandate.
(1) A party who wants costs taxed must—within 14 days after entry of judgment—file with
the circuit clerk, with proof of service, an itemized and verified bill of costs.
(2) Objections must be filed within 14 days after service of the bill of costs, unless the court

extends the time.
(3) The clerk must prepare and certify an itemized statement of costs for insertion in the
mandate, but issuance of the mandate must not be delayed for taxing costs. If the mandate issues
before costs are finally determined, the district clerk must—upon the circuit clerk's request—add
the statement of costs, or any amendment of it, to the mandate.
(e) Costs on Appeal Taxable in the District Court. The following costs on appeal are
taxable in the district court for the benefit of the party entitled to costs under this rule:
(1) the preparation and transmission of the record;
(2) the reporter's transcript, if needed to determine the appeal;
(3) premiums paid for a supersedeas bond or other bond to preserve rights pending appeal;
and
(4) the fee for filing the notice of appeal.
(As amended Apr. 30, 1979, eff. Aug. 1, 1979; Mar. 10, 1986, eff. July 1, 1986; Apr. 24,
1998, eff. Dec. 1, 1998; Mar. 26, 2009, eff. Dec. 1, 2009.)
Notes on Advisory Committee on Rules—1967
Subdivision (a). Statutory authorization for taxation of costs is found in 28 U.S.C. §1920.
The provisions of this subdivision follow the usual practice in the circuits. A few statutes contain
specific provisions in derogation of these general provisions. (See 28 U.S.C. §1928, which forbids
the award of costs to a successful plaintiff in a patent infringement action under the circumstances
described by the statute). These statutes are controlling in cases to which they apply.
Subdivision (b). The rules of the courts of appeals at present commonly deny costs to the
United States except as allowance may be directed by statute. Those rules were promulgated at a
time when the United States was generally invulnerable to an award of costs against it, and they
appear to be based on the view that if the United States is not subject to costs if it loses, it ought not
be entitled to recover costs if it wins.
The number of cases affected by such rules has been greatly reduced by the Act of July 18,
1966, 80 Stat. 308 (1 U.S. Code Cong. & Ad. News, p. 349 (1966), 89th Cong., 2d Sess., which
amended 28 U.S.C. §2412, the former general bar to the award of costs against the United States.
Section 2412 as amended generally places the United States on the same footing as private parties
with respect to the award of costs in civil cases. But the United States continues to enjoy immunity
from costs in certain cases. By its terms amended section 2412 authorizes an award of costs against
the United States only in civil actions, and it excepts from its general authorization of an award of
costs against the United States cases which are "otherwise specifically provided (for) by statute."
Furthermore, the Act of July 18, 1966, supra, provides that the amendments of section 2412 which
it effects shall apply only to actions filed subsequent to the date of its enactment. The second
clause continues in effect, for these and all other cases in which the United States enjoys immunity
from costs, the presently prevailing rule that the United States may recover costs as the prevailing
party only if it would have suffered them as the losing party.
Subdivision (c). While only five circuits (D.C. Cir. Rule 20(d); 1st Cir. Rule 31(4); 3d Cir.
Rule 35(4); 4th Cir. Rule 21(4); 9th Cir. Rule 25, as amended June 2, 1967) presently tax the cost
of printing briefs, the proposed rule makes the cost taxable in keeping with the principle of this rule
that all cost items expended in the prosecution of a proceeding should be borne by the unsuccessful
party.
Subdivision (e). The costs described in this subdivision are costs of the appeal and, as such,

are within the undertaking of the appeal bond. They are made taxable in the district court for
general convenience. Taxation of the cost of the reporter's transcript is specifically authorized by
28 U.S.C. §1920, but in the absence of a rule some district courts have held themselves without
authority to tax the cost (Perlman v. Feldmann, 116 F.Supp. 102 (D.Conn., 1953); Firtag v.
Gendleman, 152 F.Supp. 226 (D.D.C., 1957); Todd Atlantic Shipyards Corps. v. The Southport,
100 F.Supp. 763 (E.D.S.C., 1951). Provision for taxation of the cost of premiums paid for
supersedeas bonds is common in the local rules of district courts and the practice is established in
the Second, Seventh, and Ninth Circuits. Berner v. British Commonwealth Pacific Air Lines, Ltd.,
362 F.2d 799 (2d Cir. 1966); Land Oberoesterreich v. Gude, 93 F.2d 292 (2d Cir., 1937); In re
Northern Ind. Oil Co., 192 F.2d 139 (7th Cir., 1951); Lunn v. F. W. Woolworth, 210 F.2d 159 (9th
Cir., 1954).
Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules—1979 Amendment
Subdivision (c). The proposed amendment would permit variations among the circuits in
regulating the maximum rates taxable as costs for printing or otherwise reproducing briefs,
appendices, and copies of records authorized by Rule 30(f). The present rule has had a different
effect in different circuits depending upon the size of the circuit, the location of the clerk's office,
and the location of other cities. As a consequence there was a growing sense that strict adherence
to the rule produces some unfairness in some of the circuits and the matter should be made subject
to local rule.
Subdivision (d). The present rule makes no provision for objections to a bill of costs. The
proposed amendment would allow 10 days for such objections. Cf. Rule 54(d) of the F.R.C.P. It
provides further that the mandate shall not be delayed for taxation of costs.
Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules—1986 Amendment
The amendment to subdivision (c) is intended to increase the degree of control exercised
by the courts of appeals over rates for printing and copying recoverable as costs. It further requires
the courts of appeals to encourage cost-consciousness by requiring that, in fixing the rate, the court
consider the most economical methods of printing and copying.
The amendment to subdivision (d) is technical. No substantive change is intended.
Committee Notes on Rules—1998 Amendment
The language and organization of the rule are amended to make the rule more easily
understood. In addition to changes made to improve the understanding, the Advisory Committee
has changed language to make style and terminology consistent throughout the appellate rules.
These changes are intended to be stylistic only. All references to the cost of "printing" have been
deleted from subdivision (c) because commercial printing is so rarely used for preparation of
documents filed with a court of appeals.
Committee Notes on Rules—2009 Amendment
Subdivision (d)(2). The time set in the former rule at 10 days has been revised to 14 days.
See the Note to Rule 26.

Rule 40. Petition for Panel Rehearing

(a) Time to File; Contents; Answer; Action by the Court if Granted.
(1) Time. Unless the time is shortened or extended by order or local rule, a petition for
panel rehearing may be filed within 14 days after entry of judgment. But in a civil case, unless an
order shortens or extends the time, the petition may be filed by any party within 45 days after entry
of judgment if one of the parties is:
(A) the United States;
(B) a United States agency;
(C) a United States officer or employee sued in an official capacity; or
(D) a current or former United States officer or employee sued in an individual capacity for
an act or omission occurring in connection with duties performed on the United States'
behalf—including all instances in which the United States represents that person when the court of
appeals' judgment is entered or files the petition for that person.
(2) Contents. The petition must state with particularity each point of law or fact that the
petitioner believes the court has overlooked or misapprehended and must argue in support of the
petition. Oral argument is not permitted.
(3) Answer. Unless the court requests, no answer to a petition for panel rehearing is
permitted. But ordinarily rehearing will not be granted in the absence of such a request.
(4) Action by the Court. If a petition for panel rehearing is granted, the court may do any of
the following:
(A) make a final disposition of the case without reargument;
(B) restore the case to the calendar for reargument or resubmission; or
(C) issue any other appropriate order.
(b) Form of Petition; Length. The petition must comply in form with Rule 32. Copies must
be served and filed as Rule 31 prescribes. Unless the court permits or a local rule provides
otherwise, a petition for panel rehearing must not exceed 15 pages.
(As amended Apr. 30, 1979, eff. Aug. 1, 1979; Apr. 29, 1994, eff. Dec. 1, 1994; Apr. 24,
1998, eff. Dec. 1, 1998; Apr. 26, 2011, eff. Dec. 1, 2011.)
Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules—1967
This is the usual rule among the circuits, except that the express prohibition against filing a
reply to the petition is found only in the rules of the Fourth, Sixth and Eighth Circuits (it is also
contained in Supreme Court Rule 58(3)). It is included to save time and expense to the party
victorious on appeal. In the very rare instances in which a reply is useful, the court will ask for it.
Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules—1979 Amendment
Subdivision (a). The Standing Committee added to the first sentence of Rule 40(a) the
words "or by local rule," to conform to current practice in the circuits. The Standing Committee
believes the change noncontroversial.
Subdivision (b). The proposed amendment would eliminate the distinction drawn in the
present rule between printed briefs and those duplicated from typewritten pages in fixing their

maximum length. See Note to Rule 28. Since petitions for rehearing must be prepared in a short
time, making typographic printing less likely, the maximum number of pages is fixed at 15, the
figure used in the present rule for petitions duplicated by means other than typographic printing.
Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules—1994 Amendment
Subdivision (a). The amendment lengthens the time for filing a petition for rehearing from
14 to 45 days in civil cases involving the United States or its agencies or officers. It has no effect
upon the time for filing in criminal cases. The amendment makes nation-wide the current practice
in the District of Columbia and the Tenth Circuits, see D.C. Cir. R. 15(a), 10th Cir. R. 40.3. This
amendment, analogous to the provision in Rule 4(a) extending the time for filing a notice of appeal
in cases involving the United States, recognizes that the Solicitor General needs time to conduct a
thorough review of the merits of a case before requesting a rehearing. In a case in which a court of
appeals believes it necessary to restrict the time for filing a rehearing petition, the amendment
provides that the court may do so by order. Although the first sentence of Rule 40 permits a court
of appeals to shorten or lengthen the usual 14 day filing period by order or by local rule, the
sentence governing appeals in civil cases involving the United States purposely limits a court's
power to alter the 45 day period to orders in specific cases. If a court of appeals could adopt a local
rule shortening the time for filing a petition for rehearing in all cases involving the United States,
the purpose of the amendment would be defeated.
Committee Notes on Rules—1998 Amendment
The language and organization of the rule are amended to make the rule more easily
understood. In addition to changes made to improve the understanding, the Advisory Committee
has changed language to make style and terminology consistent throughout the appellate rules.
These changes are intended to be stylistic only.
Committee Notes on Rules—2011 Amendment
Subdivision (a)(1). Rule 40(a)(1) has been amended to make clear that the 45-day period to
file a petition for panel rehearing applies in cases in which an officer or employee of the United
States is sued in an individual capacity for acts or omissions occurring in connection with duties
performed on behalf of the United States. (A concurrent amendment to Rule 4(a)(1)(B) makes
clear that the 60-day period to file an appeal also applies in such cases.) In such cases, the Solicitor
General needs adequate time to review the merits of the panel decision and decide whether to seek
rehearing, just as the Solicitor General does when an appeal involves the United States, a United
States agency, or a United States officer or employee sued in an official capacity.
To promote clarity of application, the amendment to Rule 40(a)(1) includes safe harbor
provisions that parties can readily apply and rely upon. Under new subdivision 40(a)(1)(D), a case
automatically qualifies for the 45-day period if (1) a legal officer of the United States has appeared
in the case, in an official capacity, as counsel for the current or former officer or employee and has
not withdrawn the appearance at the time of the entry of the court of appeals' judgment that is the
subject of the petition or (2) a legal officer of the United States appears on the petition as counsel,
in an official capacity, for the current or former officer or employee. There will be cases that do not
fall within either safe harbor but that qualify for the longer petition period. An example would be a
case in which a federal employee is sued in an individual capacity for an act occurring in

connection with federal duties and the United States does not represent the employee either when
the court of appeals' judgment is entered or when the petition is filed but the United States pays for
private counsel for the employee.
Changes Made After Publication and Comment. The Committee made two changes to the
proposal after publication and comment.
First, the Committee inserted the words "current or former" before "United States officer or
employee." This insertion causes the text of the proposed Rule to diverge slightly from that of
Civil Rules 4(i)(3) and 12(a)(3), which refer simply to "a United States officer or employee [etc.]."
This divergence, though, is only stylistic. The 2000 Committee Notes to Civil Rules 4(i)(3) and
12(a)(3) make clear that those rules are intended to encompass former as well as current officers or
employees.
Second, the Committee added, at the end of Rule 40(a)(1)(D), the following new language:
"—including all instances in which the United States represents that person when the court of
appeals' judgment is entered or files the petition for that person." During the public comment
period, concerns were raised that a party might rely on the longer period for filing the petition, only
to risk the petition being held untimely by a court that later concluded that the relevant act or
omission had not actually occurred in connection with federal duties. The Committee decided to
respond to this concern by adding two safe harbor provisions. These provisions make clear that the
longer period applies in any ease where the United States either represents the officer or employee
at the time of entry of the relevant judgment or files the petition on the officer or employee's
behalf.

Rule 41. Mandate: Contents; Issuance and Effective Date; Stay
(a) Contents. Unless the court directs that a formal mandate issue, the mandate consists of a
certified copy of the judgment, a copy of the court's opinion, if any, and any direction about costs.
(b) When Issued. The court's mandate must issue 7 days after the time to file a petition for
rehearing expires, or 7 days after entry of an order denying a timely petition for panel rehearing,
petition for rehearing en banc, or motion for stay of mandate, whichever is later. The court may
shorten or extend the time.
(c) Effective Date. The mandate is effective when issued.
(d) Staying the Mandate.
(1) On Petition for Rehearing or Motion. The timely filing of a petition for panel rehearing,
petition for rehearing en banc, or motion for stay of mandate, stays the mandate until disposition of
the petition or motion, unless the court orders otherwise.
(2) Pending Petition for Certiorari.
(A) A party may move to stay the mandate pending the filing of a petition for a writ of
certiorari in the Supreme Court. The motion must be served on all parties and must show that the
certiorari petition would present a substantial question and that there is good cause for a stay.
(B) The stay must not exceed 90 days, unless the period is extended for good cause or
unless the party who obtained the stay files a petition for the writ and so notifies the circuit clerk in
writing within the period of the stay. In that case, the stay continues until the Supreme Court's final
disposition.
(C) The court may require a bond or other security as a condition to granting or continuing
a stay of the mandate.
(D) The court of appeals must issue the mandate immediately when a copy of a Supreme

Court order denying the petition for writ of certiorari is filed.
(As amended Apr. 29, 1994, eff. Dec. 1, 1994; Apr. 24, 1998, eff. Dec. 1, 1998; Apr. 29,
2002, eff. Dec. 1, 2002; Mar. 26, 2009, eff. Dec. 1, 2009.)
Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules—1967
The proposed rule follows the rule or practice in a majority of circuits by which copies of
the opinion and the judgment serve in lieu of a formal mandate in the ordinary case. Compare
Supreme Court Rule 59. Although 28 U.S.C. §2101(c) permits a writ of certiorari to be filed within
90 days after entry of judgment, seven of the eight circuits which now regulate the matter of stays
pending application for certiorari limit the initial stay of the mandate to the 30-day period provided
in the proposed rule. Compare D.C. Cir. Rule 27(e).
Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules—1994 Amendment
Subdivision (a). The amendment conforms Rule 41(a) to the amendment made to Rule
40(a). The amendment keys the time for issuance of the mandate to the expiration of the time for
filing a petition for rehearing, unless such a petition is filed in which case the mandate issues 7
days after the entry of the order denying the petition. Because the amendment to Rule 40(a)
lengthens the time for filing a petition for rehearing in civil cases involving the United States from
14 to 45 days, the rule requiring the mandate to issue 21 days after the entry of judgment would
cause the mandate to issue while the government is still considering requesting a rehearing.
Therefore, the amendment generally requires the mandate to issue 7 days after the expiration of the
time for filing a petition for rehearing.
Subdivision (b). The amendment requires a party who files a motion requesting a stay of
mandate to file, at the same time, proof of service on all other parties. The old rule required the
party to give notice to the other parties; the amendment merely requires the party to provide the
court with evidence of having done so.
The amendment also states that the motion must show that a petition for certiorari would
present a substantial question and that there is good cause for a stay. The amendment is intended to
alert the parties to the fact that a stay of mandate is not granted automatically and to the type of
showing that needs to be made. The Supreme Court has established conditions that must be met
before it will stay a mandate. See Robert L. Stern et al., Supreme Court Practice §17.19 (6th ed.
1986).
Committee Notes on Rules—1998 Amendment
The language and organization of the rule are amended to make the rule more easily
understood. In addition to changes made to improve the understanding, the Advisory Committee
has changed language to make style and terminology consistent throughout the appellate rules.
These changes are intended to be stylistic only.
Several substantive changes are made in this rule, however.
Subdivision (b). The existing rule provides that the mandate issues 7 days after the time to
file a petition for panel rehearing expires unless such a petition is timely filed. If the petition is
denied, the mandate issues 7 days after entry of the order denying the petition. Those provisions
are retained but the amendments further provide that if a timely petition for rehearing en banc or
motion for stay of mandate is filed, the mandate does not issue until 7 days after entry of an order

denying the last of all such requests. If a petition for rehearing or a petition for rehearing en banc is
granted, the court enters a new judgment after the rehearing and the mandate issues within the
normal time after entry of that judgment.
Subdivision (c). Subdivision (c) is new. It provides that the mandate is effective when the
court issues it. A court of appeals' judgment or order is not final until issuance of the mandate; at
that time the parties' obligations become fixed. This amendment is intended to make it clear that
the mandate is effective upon issuance and that its effectiveness is not delayed until receipt of the
mandate by the trial court or agency, or until the trial court or agency acts upon it. This amendment
is consistent with the current understanding. Unless the court orders that the mandate issue earlier
than provided in the rule, the parties can easily calculate the anticipated date of issuance and verify
issuance with the clerk's office. In those instances in which the court orders earlier issuance of the
mandate, the entry of the order on the docket alerts the parties to that fact.
Subdivision (d). Amended paragraph (1) provides that the filing of a petition for panel
rehearing, a petition for rehearing en banc or a motion for a stay of mandate pending petition to the
Supreme Court for a writ of certiorari stays the issuance of the mandate until the court disposes of
the petition or motion. The provision that a petition for rehearing en banc stays the mandate is a
companion to the amendment of Rule 35 that deletes the language stating that a request for a
rehearing en banc does not affect the finality of the judgment or stay the issuance of the mandate.
The Committee's objective is to treat a request for a rehearing en banc like a petition for panel
rehearing so that a request for a rehearing en banc will suspend the finality of the court of appeals'
judgment and delay the running of the period for filing a petition for writ of certiorari. Because the
filing of a petition for rehearing en banc will stay the mandate, a court of appeals will need to take
final action on the petition but the procedure for doing so is left to local practice.
Paragraph (1) also provides that the filing of a motion for a stay of mandate pending
petition to the Supreme Court for a writ of certiorari stays the mandate until the court disposes of
the motion. If the court denies the motion, the court must issue the mandate 7 days after entering
the order denying the motion. If the court grants the motion, the mandate is stayed according to the
terms of the order granting the stay. Delaying issuance of the mandate eliminates the need to recall
the mandate if the motion for a stay is granted. If, however, the court believes that it would be
inappropriate to delay issuance of the mandate until disposition of the motion for a stay, the court
may order that the mandate issue immediately.
Paragraph (2). The amendment changes the maximum period for a stay of mandate, absent
the court of appeals granting an extension for cause, to 90 days. The presumptive 30-day period
was adopted when a party had to file a petition for a writ of certiorari in criminal cases within 30
days after entry of judgment. Supreme Court Rule 13.1 now provides that a party has 90 days after
entry of judgment by a court of appeals to file a petition for a writ of certiorari whether the case is
civil or criminal.
The amendment does not require a court of appeals to grant a stay of mandate that is
coextensive with the period granted for filing a petition for a writ of certiorari. The granting of a
stay and the length of the stay remain within the discretion of the court of appeals. The amendment
means only that a 90-day stay may be granted without a need to show cause for a stay longer than
30 days.
Subparagraph (C) is not new; it has been moved from the end of the rule to this position.
Committee Notes on Rules—2002 Amendment
Subdivision (b). Subdivision (b) directs that the mandate of a court must issue 7 days after

the time to file a petition for rehearing expires or 7 days after the court denies a timely petition for
panel rehearing, petition for rehearing en banc, or motion for stay of mandate, whichever is later.
Intermediate Saturdays, Sundays, and legal holidays are counted in computing that 7-day deadline,
which means that, except when the 7-day deadline ends on a weekend or legal holiday, the
mandate issues exactly one week after the triggering event.
Fed. R. App. P. 26(a)(2) has been amended to provide that, in computing any period of
time, one should "[e]xclude intermediate Saturdays, Sundays, and legal holidays when the period
is less than 11 days, unless stated in calendar days." This change in the method of computing
deadlines means that 7-day deadlines (such as that in subdivision (b)) have been lengthened as a
practical matter. Under the new computation method, a mandate would never issue sooner than 9
actual days after a triggering event, and legal holidays could extend that period to as much as 13
days.
Delaying mandates for 9 or more days would introduce significant and unwarranted delay
into appellate proceedings. For that reason, subdivision (b) has been amended to require that
mandates issue 7 calendar days after a triggering event.
Changes Made After Publication and Comments. No changes were made to the text of the
proposed amendment or to the Committee Note.
Committee Notes on Rules—2009 Amendment
Under former Rule 26(a), short periods that span weekends or holidays were computed
without counting those weekends or holidays. To specify that a period should be calculated by
counting all intermediate days, including weekends or holidays, the Rules used the term "calendar
days." Rule 26(a) now takes a "days-are-days" approach under which all intermediate days are
counted, no matter how short the period. Accordingly, "7 calendar days" in subdivision (b) is
amended to read simply "7 days."
Changes Made After Publication and Comment. The Appellate Rules Committee made
only one change to Rule 26(a) after publication and comment: Because the Committee is seeking
permission to publish for comment a proposed new Rule 1(b) that would adopt a FRAP-wide
definition of the term "state," the Committee decided to delete from Rule 26(a)(6)(B) the following
parenthetical sentence: "(In this rule, 'state' includes the District of Columbia and any United
States commonwealth, territory, or possession.)" That change required the corresponding
deletion—from the Note to Rule 26(a)(6)—of part of the final sentence (the deleted portion read ",
and defines the term 'state'—for purposes of subdivision (a)(6)—to include the District of
Columbia and any commonwealth, territory or possession of the United States. Thus, for purposes
of subdivision (a)(6)'s definition of 'legal holiday,' 'state' includes the District of Columbia, Guam,
American Samoa, the U.S. Virgin Islands, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, and the
Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands.")
The Appellate Rules Committee made one change to its proposed amendments concerning
Appellate Rules deadlines. Based on comments received with respect to the timing for motions
that toll the time for taking a civil appeal, the Committee changed the cutoff time in Rule
4(a)(4)(A)(vi) to 28 days (rather than to 30 days as in the published proposal). The published
proposal's choice of 30 days had been designed to accord with the proposed amendments
published by the Civil Rules Committee, which would have extended the deadline for tolling
motions to 30 days. Because 30 days is also the time period set by Appellate Rule 4 and by 28
U.S.C. §2107 for taking a civil appeal (when the United States and its officers or agencies are not
parties), commentators pointed out that adopting 30 days as the cutoff for filing tolling motions

would sometimes place would-be appellants in an awkward position: If the deadline for making a
tolling motion falls on the same day as the deadline for filing a notice of appeal, then in a case
involving multiple parties on one side, a litigant who wishes to appeal may not know, when filing
the notice of appeal, whether a tolling motion will be filed; such a timing system can be expected
to produce instances when appeals are filed, only to go into abeyance while the tolling motion is
resolved.
By the time of the Appellate Rules Committee's April 2008 meeting, the Civil Rules
Committee had discussed this issue and had determined that the best resolution would be to extend
the deadline for tolling motions to 28 days rather than 30 days. The choice of a 28-day deadline
responds to the concerns of those who feel that the current 10-day deadlines are much too short,
but also takes into account the problem of the 30-day appeal deadline. As described in the draft
minutes of the Committee's April meeting, Committee members carefully discussed the relevant
concerns and determined, by a vote of 7 to 1, to assent to the 28-day time period for tolling motions
and to change the cutoff time in Rule 4(a)(4)(A)(vi) to 28 days.
The Standing Committee changed Rule 26(a)(6) to exclude state holidays from the
definition of "legal holiday" for purposes of computing backward-counted periods; conforming
changes were made to the Committee Note.

Rule 42. Voluntary Dismissal
(a) Dismissal in the District Court. Before an appeal has been docketed by the circuit clerk,
the district court may dismiss the appeal on the filing of a stipulation signed by all parties or on the
appellant's motion with notice to all parties.
(b) Dismissal in the Court of Appeals. The circuit clerk may dismiss a docketed appeal if
the parties file a signed dismissal agreement specifying how costs are to be paid and pay any fees
that are due. But no mandate or other process may issue without a court order. An appeal may be
dismissed on the appellant's motion on terms agreed to by the parties or fixed by the court.
(As amended Apr. 24, 1998, eff. Dec. 1, 1998.)
Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules—1967
Subdivision (a). This subdivision is derived from FRCP 73(a) without change of substance.
Subdivision (b). The first sentence is a common provision in present circuit rules. The
second sentence is added. Compare Supreme Court Rule 60.
Committee Notes on Rules—1998 Amendment
The language of the rule is amended to make the rule more easily understood. In addition to
changes made to improve the understanding, the Advisory Committee has changed language to
make style and terminology consistent throughout the appellate rules. These changes are intended
to be stylistic only.

Rule 43. Substitution of Parties
(a) Death of a Party.
(1) After Notice of Appeal Is Filed. If a party dies after a notice of appeal has been filed or

while a proceeding is pending in the court of appeals, the decedent's personal representative may
be substituted as a party on motion filed with the circuit clerk by the representative or by any party.
A party's motion must be served on the representative in accordance with Rule 25. If the decedent
has no representative, any party may suggest the death on the record, and the court of appeals may
then direct appropriate proceedings.
(2) Before Notice of Appeal Is Filed—Potential Appellant. If a party entitled to appeal dies
before filing a notice of appeal, the decedent's personal representative—or, if there is no personal
representative, the decedent's attorney of record—may file a notice of appeal within the time
prescribed by these rules. After the notice of appeal is filed, substitution must be in accordance
with Rule 43(a)(1).
(3) Before Notice of Appeal Is Filed—Potential Appellee. If a party against whom an
appeal may be taken dies after entry of a judgment or order in the district court, but before a notice
of appeal is filed, an appellant may proceed as if the death had not occurred. After the notice of
appeal is filed, substitution must be in accordance with Rule 43(a)(1).
(b) Substitution for a Reason Other Than Death. If a party needs to be substituted for any
reason other than death, the procedure prescribed in Rule 43(a) applies.
(c) Public Officer: Identification; Substitution.
(1) Identification of Party. A public officer who is a party to an appeal or other proceeding
in an official capacity may be described as a party by the public officer's official title rather than by
name. But the court may require the public officer's name to be added.
(2) Automatic Substitution of Officeholder. When a public officer who is a party to an
appeal or other proceeding in an official capacity dies, resigns, or otherwise ceases to hold office,
the action does not abate. The public officer's successor is automatically substituted as a party.
Proceedings following the substitution are to be in the name of the substituted party, but any
misnomer that does not affect the substantial rights of the parties may be disregarded. An order of
substitution may be entered at any time, but failure to enter an order does not affect the
substitution.
(As amended Mar. 10, 1986, eff. July 1, 1986; Apr. 24, 1998, eff. Dec. 1, 1998.)
Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules—1967
Subdivision (a). The first three sentences described a procedure similar to the rule on
substitution in civil actions in the district court. See FRCP 25(a). The fourth sentence expressly
authorizes an appeal to be taken against one who has died after the entry of judgment. Compare
FRCP 73(b), which impliedly authorizes such an appeal.
The sixth sentence authorizes an attorney of record for the deceased to take an appeal on
behalf of successors in interest if the deceased has no representative. At present, if a party entitled
to appeal dies before the notice of appeal is filed, the appeal can presumably be taken only by his
legal representative and must be taken within the time ordinarily prescribed. 13 Cyclopedia of
Federal Procedure (3d Ed.) §63.21. The states commonly make special provisions for the event of
the death of a party entitled to appeal, usually by extending the time otherwise prescribed. Rules of

The provision in the proposed rule is derived from California Code of Civil Procedure, Sec. 941.

with appropriate changes.

Rule 44. Case Involving a Constitutional Question When the United States or
the Relevant State is Not a Party
(a) Constitutional Challenge to Federal Statute. If a party questions the constitutionality of
an Act of Congress in a proceeding in which the United States or its agency, officer, or employee is
not a party in an official capacity, the questioning party must give written notice to the circuit clerk
immediately upon the filing of the record or as soon as the question is raised in the court of appeals.
The clerk must then certify that fact to the Attorney General.
(b) Constitutional Challenge to State Statute. If a party questions the constitutionality of a
statute of a State in a proceeding in which that State or its agency, officer, or employee is not a
party in an official capacity, the questioning party must give written notice to the circuit clerk
immediately upon the filing of the record or as soon as the question is raised in the court of appeals.
The clerk must then certify that fact to the attorney general of the State.
(As amended Apr. 24, 1998, eff. Dec. 1, 1998; Apr. 29, 2002, eff. Dec. 1, 2002.)
Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules—1967
This rule is now found in the rules of a majority of the circuits. It is in response to the Act of
August 24, 1937 (28 U.S.C. §2403), which requires all courts of the United States to advise the
Attorney General of the existence of an action or proceeding of the kind described in the rule.
Committee Notes on Rules—1998 Amendment
The language of the rule is amended to make the rule more easily understood. In addition to
changes made to improve the understanding, the Advisory Committee has changed language to
make style and terminology consistent throughout the appellate rules. These changes are intended
to be stylistic only.
Committee Notes on Rules—2002 Amendment
Rule 44 requires that a party who "questions the constitutionality of an Act of Congress" in
a proceeding in which the United States is not a party must provide written notice of that challenge
to the clerk. Rule 44 is designed to implement 28 U.S.C. §2403(a), which states that: "In any
action, suit or proceeding in a court of the United States to which the United States or any agency,

officer or employee thereof is not a party, wherein the constitutionality of any Act of Congress
affecting the public interest is drawn in question, the court shall certify such fact to the Attorney
General, and shall permit the United States to intervene . . . for argument on the question of
constitutionality."
The subsequent section of the statute—§2403(b)—contains virtually identical language
imposing upon the courts the duty to notify the attorney general of a state of a constitutional
challenge to any statute of that state. But §2403(b), unlike §2403(a), was not implemented in Rule
44.
Rule 44 has been amended to correct this omission. The text of former Rule 44 regarding
constitutional challenges to federal statutes now appears as Rule 44(a), while new language
regarding constitutional challenges to state statutes now appears as Rule 44(b).
Changes Made After Publication and Comments. No changes were made to the text of the
proposed amendment or to the Committee Note.

Rule 45. Clerk's Duties
(a) General Provisions.
(1) Qualifications. The circuit clerk must take the oath and post any bond required by law.
Neither the clerk nor any deputy clerk may practice as an attorney or counselor in any court while
in office.
(2) When Court Is Open. The court of appeals is always open for filing any paper, issuing
and returning process, making a motion, and entering an order. The clerk's office with the clerk or
a deputy in attendance must be open during business hours on all days except Saturdays, Sundays,
and legal holidays. A court may provide by local rule or by order that the clerk's office be open for
specified hours on Saturdays or on legal holidays other than New Year's Day, Martin Luther King,
Jr.'s Birthday, Washington's Birthday, Memorial Day, Independence Day, Labor Day, Columbus
Day, Veterans' Day, Thanksgiving Day, and Christmas Day.
(b) Records.
(1) The Docket. The circuit clerk must maintain a docket and an index of all docketed cases
in the manner prescribed by the Director of the Administrative Office of the United States Courts.
The clerk must record all papers filed with the clerk and all process, orders, and judgments.
(2) Calendar. Under the court's direction, the clerk must prepare a calendar of cases
awaiting argument. In placing cases on the calendar for argument, the clerk must give preference
to appeals in criminal cases and to other proceedings and appeals entitled to preference by law.
(3) Other Records. The clerk must keep other books and records required by the Director of
the Administrative Office of the United States Courts, with the approval of the Judicial Conference
of the United States, or by the court.
(c) Notice of an Order or Judgment. Upon the entry of an order or judgment, the circuit
clerk must immediately serve a notice of entry on each party, with a copy of any opinion, and must
note the date of service on the docket. Service on a party represented by counsel must be made on
counsel.
(d) Custody of Records and Papers. The circuit clerk has custody of the court's records and
papers. Unless the court orders or instructs otherwise, the clerk must not permit an original record
or paper to be taken from the clerk's office. Upon disposition of the case, original papers

constituting the record on appeal or review must be returned to the court or agency from which
they were received. The clerk must preserve a copy of any brief, appendix, or other paper that has
been filed.

Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules—1967
The duties imposed upon clerks of the courts of appeals by this rule are those imposed by
rule or practice in a majority of the circuits. The second sentence of subdivision (a) authorizing the
closing of the clerk's office on Saturday and non-national legal holidays follows a similar
provision respecting the district court clerk's office found in FRCP 77(c) and in FRCrP 56.
Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules—1971 Amendment
The amendment adds Columbus Day to the list of legal holidays. See the Note
accompanying the amendment of Rule 26(a).
Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules—1986 Amendment
The amendment to Rule 45(b) permits the courts of appeals to maintain computerized
dockets. The Committee believes that the Administrative Office of the United States Courts ought
to have maximum flexibility in prescribing the format of this docket in order to ensure a smooth
transition from manual to automated systems and subsequent adaptation to technological
improvements.
The amendments to Rules 45(a) and (d) are technical. No substantive change is intended.
The Birthday of Martin Luther King, Jr. has been added to the list of national holidays.
Committee Notes on Rules—1998 Amendment
The language and organization of the rule are amended to make the rule more easily
understood. In addition to changes made to improve the understanding, the Advisory Committee
has changed language to make style and terminology consistent throughout the appellate rules.
These changes are intended to be stylistic only.
Committee Notes on Rules—2002 Amendment
Subdivision (c). Subdivision (c) has been amended so that the clerk may use electronic
means to serve notice of entry of an order or judgment upon parties who have consented to such
service.
Changes Made After Publication and Comments. No changes were made to the text of the
proposed amendment or to the Committee Note.
Committee Notes on Rules—2005 Amendment
Subdivision (a)(2). Rule 45(a)(2) has been amended to refer to the third Monday in
February as "Washington's Birthday." A federal statute officially designates the holiday as

"Washington's Birthday," reflecting the desire of Congress specially to honor the first president of
the United States. See 5 U.S.C. §6103(a). During the 1998 restyling of the Federal Rules of
Appellate Procedure, references to "Washington's Birthday" were mistakenly changed to
"Presidents' Day." The amendment corrects that error.
Changes Made After Publication and Comments. No changes were made to the text of the
proposed amendment or to the Committee Note.

Rule 46. Attorneys
(a) Admission to the Bar.
(1) Eligibility. An attorney is eligible for admission to the bar of a court of appeals if that
attorney is of good moral and professional character and is admitted to practice before the Supreme
Court of the United States, the highest court of a state, another United States court of appeals, or a
United States district court (including the district courts for Guam, the Northern Mariana Islands,
and the Virgin Islands).
(2) Application. An applicant must file an application for admission, on a form approved
by the court that contains the applicant's personal statement showing eligibility for membership.
The applicant must subscribe to the following oath or affirmation:
"I, ________________________, do solemnly swear [or affirm] that I will conduct myself
as an attorney and counselor of this court, uprightly and according to law; and that I will support
the Constitution of the United States."
(3) Admission Procedures. On written or oral motion of a member of the court's bar, the
court will act on the application. An applicant may be admitted by oral motion in open court. But,
unless the court orders otherwise, an applicant need not appear before the court to be admitted.
Upon admission, an applicant must pay the clerk the fee prescribed by local rule or court order.
(b) Suspension or Disbarment.
(1) Standard. A member of the court's bar is subject to suspension or disbarment by the
court if the member:
(A) has been suspended or disbarred from practice in any other court; or
(B) is guilty of conduct unbecoming a member of the court's bar.
(2) Procedure. The member must be given an opportunity to show good cause, within the
time prescribed by the court, why the member should not be suspended or disbarred.
(3) Order. The court must enter an appropriate order after the member responds and a
hearing is held, if requested, or after the time prescribed for a response expires, if no response is
made.
(c) Discipline. A court of appeals may discipline an attorney who practices before it for
conduct unbecoming a member of the bar or for failure to comply with any court rule. First,
however, the court must afford the attorney reasonable notice, an opportunity to show cause to the
contrary, and, if requested, a hearing.
(As amended Mar. 10, 1986, eff. July 1, 1986; Apr. 24, 1998, eff. Dec. 1, 1998.)
Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules—1967

Subdivision (a). The basic requirement of membership in the bar of the Supreme Court, or
of the highest court of a state, or in another court of appeals or a district court is found, with minor
variations, in the rules of ten circuits. The only other requirement in those circuits is that the
applicant be of good moral and professional character. In the District of Columbia Circuit
applicants other than members of the District of Columbia District bar or the Supreme Court bar
must claim membership in the bar of the highest court of a state, territory or possession for three
years prior to application for admission (D.C. Cir. Rule 7). Members of the District of Columbia
District bar and the Supreme Court bar again excepted, applicants for admission to the District of
Columbia Circuit bar must meet precisely defined prelaw and law school study requirements (D.C.
Cir. Rule 7½).
A few circuits now require that application for admission be made by oral motion by a
sponsor member in open court. The proposed rule permits both the application and the motion by
the sponsor member to be in writing, and permits action on the motion without the appearance of
the applicant or the sponsor, unless the court otherwise orders.
Subdivision (b). The provision respecting suspension or disbarment is uniform. Third
Circuit Rule 8(3) is typical.
Subdivision (c). At present only Fourth Circuit Rule 36 contains an equivalent provision.
The purpose of this provision is to make explicit the power of a court of appeals to impose
sanctions less serious than suspension or disbarment for the breach of rules. It also affords some
measure of control over attorneys who are not members of the bar of the court. Several circuits
permit a non-member attorney to file briefs and motions, membership being required only at the
time of oral argument. And several circuits permit argument pro hac vice by non-member
attorneys.
Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules—1986 Amendment
The amendments to Rules 46(a) and (b) are technical. No substantive change is intended.
Committee Notes on Rules—1998 Amendment
The language and organization of the rule are amended to make the rule more easily
understood. In addition to changes made to improve the understanding, the Advisory Committee
has changed language to make style and terminology consistent throughout the appellate rules.
These changes are intended to be stylistic only.

Rule 47. Local Rules by Courts of Appeals
(a) Local Rules.
(1) Each court of appeals acting by a majority of its judges in regular active service may,
after giving appropriate public notice and opportunity for comment, make and amend rules
governing its practice. A generally applicable direction to parties or lawyers regarding practice
before a court must be in a local rule rather than an internal operating procedure or standing order.
A local rule must be consistent with—but not duplicative of—Acts of Congress and rules adopted
under 28 U.S.C. §2072 and must conform to any uniform numbering system prescribed by the
Judicial Conference of the United States. Each circuit clerk must send the Administrative Office of

the United States Courts a copy of each local rule and internal operating procedure when it is
promulgated or amended.
(2) A local rule imposing a requirement of form must not be enforced in a manner that
causes a party to lose rights because of a nonwillful failure to comply with the requirement.
(b) Procedure When There Is No Controlling Law. A court of appeals may regulate
practice in a particular case in any manner consistent with federal law, these rules, and local rules
of the circuit. No sanction or other disadvantage may be imposed for noncompliance with any
requirement not in federal law, federal rules, or the local circuit rules unless the alleged violator
has been furnished in the particular case with actual notice of the requirement.
(As amended Apr. 27, 1995, eff. Dec. 1, 1995; Apr. 24, 1998, eff. Dec. 1, 1998.)
Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules—1967
This rule continues the authority now vested in individual courts of appeals by 28 U.S.C.
§2071 to make rules consistent with rules of practice and procedure promulgated by the Supreme
Court.
Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules—1995 Amendment
Subdivision (a). This rule is amended to require that a generally applicable direction
regarding practice before a court of appeals must be in a local rule rather than an internal operating
procedure or some other general directive. It is the intent of this rule that a local rule may not bar
any practice that these rules explicitly or implicitly permit. Subdivision (b) allows a court of
appeals to regulate practice in an individual case by entry of an order in the case. The amendment
also reflects the requirement that local rules be consistent not only with the national rules but also
with Acts of Congress. The amendment also states that local rules should not repeat national rules
and Acts of Congress.
The amendment also requires that the numbering of local rules conform with any uniform
numbering system that may be prescribed by the Judicial Conference. Lack of uniform numbering
might create unnecessary traps for counsel and litigants. A uniform numbering system would
make it easier for an increasingly national bar and for litigants to locate a local rule that applies to
a particular procedural issue.
Paragraph (2) is new. Its aim is to protect against loss of rights in the enforcement of local
rules relating to matters of form. The proscription of paragraph (2) is narrowly drawn—covering
only violations that are not willful and only those involving local rules directed to matters of form.
It does not limit the court's power to impose substantive penalties upon a party if it or its attorney
stubbornly or repeatedly violates a local rule, even one involving merely a matter of form. Nor
does it affect the court's power to enforce local rules that involve more than mere matters of form.
Subdivision (b). This rule provides flexibility to the court in regulating practice in a
particular case when there is no controlling law. Specifically, it permits the court to regulate
practice in any manner consistent with Acts of Congress, with rules adopted under 28 U.S.C.
§2072, and with the circuit's local rules.
The amendment to this rule disapproves imposing any sanction or other disadvantage on a
person for noncompliance with such a directive, unless the alleged violator has been furnished in a
particular case with actual notice of the requirement. There should be no adverse consequence to a
party or attorney for violating special requirements relating to practice before a particular court

unless the party or attorney has actual notice of those requirements.
Committee Notes on Rules—1998 Amendment
The language of the rule is amended to make the rule more easily understood. In addition to
changes made to improve the understanding, the Advisory Committee has changed language to
make style and terminology consistent throughout the appellate rules. These changes are intended
to be stylistic only.

Rule 48. Masters
(a) Appointment; Powers. A court of appeals may appoint a special master to hold
hearings, if necessary, and to recommend factual findings and disposition in matters ancillary to
proceedings in the court. Unless the order referring a matter to a master specifies or limits the
master's powers, those powers include, but are not limited to, the following:
(1) regulating all aspects of a hearing;
(2) taking all appropriate action for the efficient performance of the master's duties under
the order;
(3) requiring the production of evidence on all matters embraced in the reference; and
(4) administering oaths and examining witnesses and parties.
(b) Compensation. If the master is not a judge or court employee, the court must determine
the master's compensation and whether the cost is to be charged to any party.
(As amended Apr. 29, 1994, eff. Dec. 1, 1994; Apr. 24, 1998, eff. Dec. 1, 1998.)
Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules—1994 Amendment
The text of the existing Rule 48 concerning the title was moved to Rule 1.
This new Rule 48 authorizes a court of appeals to appoint a special master to make
recommendations concerning ancillary matters. The courts of appeals have long used masters in
contempt proceedings where the issue is compliance with an enforcement order. See Polish
National Alliance v. NLRB, 159 F.2d 38 (7th Cir. 1946), NLRB v. Arcade-Sunshine Co., 132 F.2d 8
(D.C. Cir. 1942); NLRB v. Remington Rand, Inc., 130 F.2d 919 (2d Cir. 1942). There are other
instances when the question before a court of appeals requires a factual determination. An
application for fees or eligibility for Criminal Justice Act status on appeal are examples.
Ordinarily when a factual issue is unresolved, a court of appeals remands the case to the
district court or agency that originally heard the case. It is not the Committee's intent to alter that
practice. However, when factual issues arise in the first instance in the court of appeals, such as
fees for representation on appeal, it would be useful to have authority to refer such determinations
to a master for a recommendation.
Committee Notes on Rules—1998 Amendment
The language and organization of the rule are amended to make the rule more easily
understood. In addition to changes made to improve the understanding, the Advisory Committee
has changed language to make style and terminology consistent throughout the appellate rules.
