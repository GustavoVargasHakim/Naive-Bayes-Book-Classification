Preface
These teaching materials are a work-in-progress. Our reading assignments
this semester will include all of the elements that make up a conventional
casebook. You will read judicial opinions, statutory provisions, academic
essays, and hypotheticals. You will puzzle over common law doctrines and
carefully parse statutes. We will try to develop theories that can predict and
justify the patterns of judicial decisions we observe.
Unlike a conventional casebook, however, I have selected each element of
the readings myself. We will start at the beginning of these materials, read
each assignment in order, and finish at the end. All of the reading
assignments are also self-contained. When I ask you to read a statutory
section or a portion of the Restatement, it will appear in the text at the
point where you should read it. In addition, we will cover the entire set of
materials. You will not spend the semester hauling around hundreds of
extra pages that we have no time to read or discuss. At the end of each
section, you will find discussion questions that track very closely the
questions that I will ask during our class time together. Finally, the pages
themselves are formatted to make reading easier and to give you plenty of
space to take notes and mark up the text.
Our class also will use an online collaboration site to enrich and extend
class discussions. This site will provide links to additional legal sources as
well as questions for class discussion, practice problems, explanatory notes,
and a discussion forum. The site will develop and evolve in response to
your needs and interests. If you have any suggestions for changes or
additions to these materials, I invite you to talk with me or post your ideas
to our collaboration site.

Why study contract law?
The first semester of law school is mostly about learning to speak a new
legal language (but emphatically not “legalese”), to formulate and evaluate
legal arguments, to become comfortable with the distinctive style of legal
analysis. We could teach these skills using almost any legal topic. But we
begin the first-year curriculum with subjects that pervade the entire field of
law. Contract principles have a long history and they form a significant part
of the way that lawyers think about many legal problems. As you will
discover when you study insurance law, employment law, family law, and
dozens of other practice areas, your knowledge of contract doctrine and
theory will be invaluable.

viii

Why collaborative teaching materials?
The ultimate goal of this project is to involve many professors in producing
a library of materials for teaching contracts (and other subjects). For the
moment, I will be solely responsible for collecting public domain content
and generating problems and explanatory essays. These embryonic reading
materials will grow and evolve as I use and expand them and as other
professors join in producing additional content. I gratefully acknowledge
the extraordinary work of my talented research assistants who have been
instrumental in helping me to put these materials together. Thanks to Sarah
Bryan, Mario Lorello, Elizabeth Young, Vishal Phalgoo, Valerie Barker and
Jim Sherwood.
I believe that it is equally important to involve students in the ongoing
process of refining and improving how we teach legal subjects. Our
collaboration site will provide a platform for student-generated content and
lively dialogue. With your enthusiastic engagement, we will finish the
semester with an excellent understanding of contracts and a useful
collection of reference materials. I invite each of you to join us for what will
be a challenging, sometimes frustrating, but ultimately rewarding,
intellectual journey.

VI. Identifying and
Interpreting the Terms of an
Agreement
When contractual relations break down, parties frequently discover that
they disagree both about which terms have become part of their agreement
and about how to interpret those terms. We have already seen how the
common law last shot rule and UCC § 2-207 determine whose terms
govern after a “battle of the forms.” In this section, we examine a broader
set of doctrines concerning the content and meaning of a contract.
As you read these materials, it will be helpful to bear in mind that a
fundamental tension afflicts judicial efforts to identify and interpret the
terms of an agreement. The question in every case is whether to hew closely
to the language contained in the parties’ written agreement or instead to
consider evidence of prior or contemporaneous oral agreements, trade
customs, the parties’ course of dealing under earlier contracts, and their
experience performing the current contract. Early common law decisions
tended to exclude much of this contextual evidence. However, many critics
have observed that the traditional formalist emphasis on the text of the
written agreement often prevents enforcement of oral promises or
understandings between the parties that were assuredly part of their
agreement.
More recently, courts have developed rules that permit them to consider a
much wider range of contextual evidence. Their goal has been to eliminate
formal obstacles to discovering the true intentions of the parties. Both the
Restatement (Second) of Contracts § 216 and UCC § 2-202 embody this
more permissive attitude. However, a neo-formalist critique of the
contextualist approach points out that parties often use written agreements
to make their obligations more precise and to narrow the scope of potential
disagreement about terms and meaning. Courts frustrate this goal when
they permit contextual evidence to undermine the comparative certainty of
a writing.
Although these competing concerns apply equally to both identifying and
interpreting terms, the cases that follow focus on the problem of identifying
which terms will become part of a contract. The common law parol

2

evidence rule and UCC § 2-202 provide the legal framework within which
this issue is analyzed.

1 The Common Law Parol Evidence Rule
Courts use the common law parol evidence rule to decide whether a party
may try to prove contract terms beyond those contained in a written
agreement. The traditional textualist approach to this question—the socalled “four corners test”—asked simply whether the written contract
appeared complete on its face. If so, both parties would be barred from
introducing evidence of any prior or contemporaneous agreement about the
same transaction. Contemporary case law has embraced a far more
permissive standard that asks instead whether the alleged additional terms
“would naturally have been excluded” from the writing. See Restatement
(Second) of Contracts § 216. In the majority of US jurisdictions, the
common law thus has evolved from a relatively strict parol evidence rule to
a comparatively lax standard that is far more likely to permit parties to offer
evidence of informal agreements to vary the terms of a writing.
Despite this evolution towards contextualism, constraints remain. The
modern parol evidence rule still limits proof of additional terms. It is
convenient to distinguish two stages of analysis. Courts ask first whether
the parties’ written agreement is partially or totally “integrated” and then
whether the proffered additional term is “consistent” with the written
terms.
The touchstone for integration is an inquiry into whether the parties intended
the writing to be a final and exclusive statement of their agreement. The
written contract is fully (or “completely”) integrated if it was meant to
exclude all prior or contemporaneous understandings between the parties,
and it is partially integrated if it is the final statement of only some of the
terms of their agreement. An express “merger clause” stating that the
writing will be the final and exclusive statement of the parties’ agreement is
by far the most common basis for finding full integration. The test of
consistency bars proof of terms that contradict or are inconsistent with the
writing. At least in theory, both integration and consistency thus filter out
those additional terms that are unlikely to have been part of the parties’
agreement.
As you will discover in reading the cases that follow, applying the rules for
integration and consistency is a remarkably uncertain enterprise. Try to
discern where each court falls on the continuum from formalist textualism

3

to permissive contextualism. And see if you agree with the underlying policy
arguments that animate the various opinions.

1.1 Principal Case – Mitchill v. Lath
Mitchill v. Lath
Court of Appeals of New York
247 N.Y. 377, 160 N.E. 646 (1928)
ANDREWS, J.
[1] In the fall of 1923 the Laths owned a farm. This they wished to
sell. Across the road, on land belonging to Lieutenant-Governor
Lunn, they had an ice house which they might remove. Mrs. Mitchill
looked over the land with a view to its purchase. She found the ice
house objectionable. Thereupon "the defendants orally promised and
agreed, for and in consideration of the purchase of their farm by the
plaintiff, to remove the said ice house in the spring of 1924." Relying
upon this promise, she made a written contract to buy the property for
$8,400, for cash and a mortgage and containing various provisions
usual in such papers. Later receiving a deed, she entered into
possession and has spent considerable sums in improving the property
for use as a summer residence. The defendants have not fulfilled their
promise as to the ice house and do not intend to do so. We are not
dealing, however, with their moral delinquencies. The question before
us is whether their oral agreement may be enforced in a court of
equity.
[2] This requires a discussion of the parol evidence rule—a rule of
law which defines the limits of the contract to be construed. (Glackin
v. Bennett, 226 Mass. 316.) It is more than a rule of evidence and oral
testimony even if admitted will not control the written contract
(O'Malley v. Grady, 222 Mass. 202), unless admitted without
objection. (Brady v. Nally, 151 N. Y. 258.) It applies, however, to
attempts to modify such a contract by parol. It does not affect a parol
collateral contract distinct from and independent of the written
agreement. It is, at times, troublesome to draw the line. Williston, in
his work on Contracts (sec. 637) points out the difficulty. "Two
entirely distinct contracts," he says, "each for a separate consideration
may be made at the same time and will be distinct legally. Where,
however, one agreement is entered into wholly or partly in
consideration of the simultaneous agreement to enter into another, the
transactions are necessarily bound together. … Then if one of the
agreements is oral and the other is written, the problem arises whether

4

the bond is sufficiently close to prevent proof of the oral agreement."
That is the situation here. It is claimed that the defendants are called
upon to do more than is required by their written contract in
connection with the sale as to which it deals. The principle may be
clear, but it can be given effect by no mechanical rule. As so often
happens, it is a matter of degree, for as Professor Williston also says
where a contract contains several promises on each side it is not
difficult to put any one of them in the form of a collateral agreement.
If this were enough written contracts might always be modified by
parol. Not form, but substance is the test.
[3] In applying this test the policy of our courts is to be considered.
We have believed that the purpose behind the rule was a wise one not
easily to be abandoned. Notwithstanding injustice here and there, on
the whole it works for good. Old precedents and principles are not to
be lightly cast aside unless it is certain that they are an obstruction
under present conditions. New York has been less open to arguments
that would modify this particular rule, than some jurisdictions
elsewhere. Thus in Eighmie v. Taylor (98 N. Y. 288) it was held that a
parol warranty might not be shown although no warranties were
contained in the writing.
[4] Under our decisions before such an oral agreement as the present
is received to vary the written contract at least three conditions must
exist, (1) the agreement must in form be a collateral one; (2) it must
not contradict express or implied provisions of the written contract;
(3) it must be one that parties would not ordinarily be expected to
embody in the writing; or put in another way, an inspection of the
written contract, read in the light of surrounding circumstances must
not indicate that the writing appears "to contain the engagements of
the parties, and to define the object and measure the extent of such
engagement." Or again, it must not be so clearly connected with the
principal transaction as to be part and parcel of it.
[5] The respondent does not satisfy the third of these requirements.
It may be, not the second. We have a written contract for the purchase
and sale of land. The buyer is to pay $8,400 in the way described. She
is also to pay her portion of any rents, interest on mortgages,
insurance premiums and water meter charges. She may have a survey
made of the premises. On their part the sellers are to give a full
covenant deed of the premises as described, or as they may be
described by the surveyor if the survey is had, executed and
acknowledged at their own expense; they sell the personal property on
the farm and represent they own it; they agree that all amounts paid

5

them on the contract and the expense of examining the title shall be a
lien on the property; they assume the risk of loss or damage by fire
until the deed is delivered; and they agree to pay the broker his
commissions. Are they to do more? Or is such a claim inconsistent
with these precise provisions? It could not be shown that the plaintiff
was to pay $500 additional. Is it also implied that the defendants are
not to do anything unexpressed in the writing?
[6] That we need not decide. At least, however, an inspection of this
contract shows a full and complete agreement, setting forth in detail
the obligations of each party. On reading it one would conclude that
the reciprocal obligations of the parties were fully detailed. Nor would
his opinion alter if he knew the surrounding circumstances. The
presence of the ice house, even the knowledge that Mrs. Mitchill
thought it objectionable would not lead to the belief that a separate
agreement existed with regard to it. Were such an agreement made it
would seem most natural that the inquirer should find it in the
contract. Collateral in form it is found to be, but it is closely related to
the subject dealt with in the written agreement—so closely that we
hold it may not be proved.
[7] Where the line between the competent and the incompetent is
narrow the citation of authorities is of slight use. Each represents the
judgment of the court on the precise facts before it. How closely
bound to the contract is the supposed collateral agreement is the
decisive factor in each case. But reference may be made to Johnson v.
Oppenheim (55 N. Y. 280, 292); Thomas v. Scutt (127 N. Y. 133); Eighmie
v. Taylor (98 N. Y. 288); Stowell v. Greenwich Ins. Co. (163 N. Y. 298);
Newburger v. American Surety Co. (242 N. Y. 134); Love v. Hamel (59 App.
Div. 360); Daly v. Piza (105 App. Div. 496); Seitz v. Brewers Refrigerating
Co. (141 U. S. 510); American Locomotive Co. v. Nat. Grocery Co. (226
Mass. 314); Doyle v. Dixon (12 Allen, 576). Of these citations, Johnson v.
Oppenheim and the two in the Appellate Division relate to collateral
contracts said to have been the inducing cause of the main contract.
They refer to leases. A similar case is Wilson v. Deen (74 N. Y. 531). All
hold that an oral stipulation, said to have been the inducing cause for
the subsequent execution of the lease itself, concerning some act to be
done by the landlord, or some condition as to the leased premises,
might not be shown. In principle they are not unlike the case before
us. Attention should be called also to Taylor v. Hopper (62 N. Y. 649),
where it is assumed that evidence of a parol agreement to remove a
barn, which was an inducement to the sale of lots, was improper.

6

[8] We do not ignore the fact that authorities may be found that
would seem to support the contention of the appellant. Such are
Erskine v. Adeane (L. R. 8 Ch. App. 756) and Morgan v. Griffith (L. R. 6
Exch. 70), where although there was a written lease a collateral
agreement of the landlord to reduce the game was admitted. In this
State Wilson v. Deen might lead to the contrary result. Neither are they
approved in New Jersey (Naumberg v. Young, 15 Vroom, 331). Nor in
view of later cases in this court can Batterman v. Pierce (3 Hill, 171) be
considered an authority. A line of cases in Massachusetts, of which
Durkin v. Cobleigh (156 Mass. 108) is an example, have to do with
collateral contracts made before a deed is given. But the fixed form of
a deed makes it inappropriate to insert collateral agreements, however
closely connected with the sale. This may be cause for an exception.
Here we deal with the contract on the basis of which the deed to Mrs.
Mitchill was given subsequently, and we confine ourselves to the
question whether its terms may be modified.
[9] Finally there is the case of Chapin v. Dobson (78 N. Y. 74, 76). This
is acknowledged to be on the border line and is rarely cited except to
be distinguished. Assuming the premises, however, the court was
clearly right. There was nothing on the face of the written contract, it
said, to show that it intended to express the entire agreement. And
there was a finding, sustained by evidence, that there was an entire
contract, only part of which was reduced to writing. This being so, the
contract as made might be proved.
[10] It is argued that what we have said is not applicable to the case as
presented. The collateral agreement was made with the plaintiff. The
contract of sale was with her husband and no assignment of it from
him appears. Yet the deed was given to her. It is evident that here was
a transaction in which she was the principal from beginning to end.
We must treat the contract as if in form, as it was in fact, made by her.
[11] Our conclusion is that the judgment of the Appellate Division
and that of the Special Term should be reversed and the complaint
dismissed, with costs in all courts.
LEHMAN, J. (DISSENTING).
[12] I accept the general rule as formulated by Judge Andrews. I differ
with him only as to its application to the facts shown in the record.
The plaintiff contracted to purchase land from the defendants for an
agreed price. A formal written agreement was made between the
sellers and the plaintiff's husband. It is on its face a complete contract
for the conveyance of the land. It describes the property to be

7

conveyed. It sets forth the purchase price to be paid. All the
conditions and terms of the conveyance to be made are clearly stated.
I concede at the outset that parol evidence to show additional
conditions and terms of the conveyance would be inadmissible. There
is a conclusive presumption that the parties intended to integrate in
that written contract every agreement relating to the nature or extent
of the property to be conveyed, the contents of the deed to be
delivered, the consideration to be paid as a condition precedent to the
delivery of the deeds, and indeed all the rights of the parties in
connection with the land. The conveyance of that land was the
subject-matter of the written contract and the contract completely
covers that subject.
[13] The parol agreement which the court below found the parties had
made was collateral to, yet connected with, the agreement of purchase
and sale. It has been found that the defendants induced the plaintiff to
agree to purchase the land by a promise to remove an ice house from
land not covered by the agreement of purchase and sale. No
independent consideration passed to the defendants for the parol
promise. To that extent the written contract and the alleged oral
contract are bound together. The same bond usually exists wherever
attempt is made to prove a parol agreement which is collateral to a
written agreement. Hence "the problem arises whether the bond is
sufficiently close to prevent proof of the oral agreement." See Judge
Andrews’ citation from WILLISTON ON CONTRACTS, section 637.
[14] Judge Andrews has formulated a standard to measure the
closeness of the bond. Three conditions, at least, must exist before an
oral agreement may be proven to increase the obligation imposed by
the written agreement. I think we agree that the first condition that the
agreement "must in form be a collateral one" is met by the evidence. I
concede that this condition is met in most cases where the courts have
nevertheless excluded evidence of the collateral oral agreement. The
difficulty here, as in most cases, arises in connection with the two
other conditions.
[15] The second condition is that the "parol agreement must not
contradict express or implied provisions of the written contract."
Judge Andrews voices doubt whether this condition is satisfied. The
written contract has been carried out. The purchase price has been
paid; conveyance has been made, title has passed in accordance with
the terms of the written contract. The mutual obligations expressed in
the written contract are left unchanged by the alleged oral contract.
When performance was required of the written contract, the

8

obligations of the parties were measured solely by its terms. By the
oral agreement the plaintiff seeks to hold the defendants to other
obligations to be performed by them thereafter upon land which was
not conveyed to the plaintiff. The assertion of such further obligation
is not inconsistent with the written contract unless the written contract
contains a provision, express or implied, that the defendants are not to
do anything not expressed in the writing. Concededly there is no such
express provision in the contract, and such a provision may be
implied, if at all, only if the asserted additional obligation is "so clearly
connected with the principal transaction as to be part and parcel of it,"
and is not "one that the parties would not ordinarily be expected to
embody in the writing." The hypothesis so formulated for a
conclusion that the asserted additional obligation is inconsistent with
an implied term of the contract is that the alleged oral agreement does
not comply with the third condition as formulated by Judge Andrews.
In this case, therefore, the problem reduces itself to the one question
whether or not the oral agreement meets the third condition.
[16] I have conceded that upon inspection the contract is complete. "It
appears to contain the engagements of the parties, and to define the
object and measure the extent of such engagement;" it constitutes the
contract between them and is presumed to contain the whole of that
contract. (Eighmie v. Taylor, 98 N. Y. 288.) That engagement was on the
one side to convey land; on the other to pay the price. The plaintiff
asserts further agreement based on the same consideration to be
performed by the defendants after the conveyance was complete, and
directly affecting only other land. It is true, as Judge Andrews points
out, that "the presence of the ice house, even the knowledge that Mrs.
Mitchill thought it objectionable, would not lead to the belief that a
separate agreement existed with regard to it;" but the question we
must decide is whether or not, assuming an agreement was made for
the removal of an unsightly ice house from one parcel of land as an
inducement for the purchase of another parcel, the parties would
ordinarily or naturally be expected to embody the agreement for the
removal of the ice house from one parcel in the written agreement to
convey the other parcel. Exclusion of proof of the oral agreement on
the ground that it varies the contract embodied in the writing may be
based only upon a finding or presumption that the written contract
was intended to cover the oral negotiations for the removal of the ice
house which lead up to the contract of purchase and sale. To
determine what the writing was intended to cover "the document
alone will not suffice. What it was intended to cover cannot be known
till we know what there was to cover. The question being whether

9

certain subjects of negotiation were intended to be covered, we must
compare the writing and the negotiations before we can determine
whether they were in fact covered." (WIGMORE ON EVIDENCE [2d
ed.], section 2430.)
[17] The subject-matter of the written contract was the conveyance of
land. The contract was so complete on its face that the conclusion is
inevitable that the parties intended to embody in the writing all the
negotiations covering at least the conveyance. The promise by the
defendants to remove the ice house from other land was not
connected with their obligation to convey, except that one agreement
would not have been made unless the other was also made. The
plaintiff's assertion of a parol agreement by the defendants to remove
the ice house was completely established by the great weight of
evidence. It must prevail unless that agreement was part of the
agreement to convey and the entire agreement was embodied in the
writing.
[18] The fact that in this case the parol agreement is established by the
overwhelming weight of evidence is, of course, not a factor which may
be considered in determining the competency or legal effect of the
evidence. Hardship in the particular case would not justify the court in
disregarding or emasculating the general rule. It merely accentuates the
outlines of our problem. The assumption that the parol agreement was
made is no longer obscured by any doubts. The problem then is
clearly whether the parties are presumed to have intended to render
that parol agreement legally ineffective and non-existent by failure to
embody it in the writing. Though we are driven to say that nothing in
the written contract which fixed the terms and conditions of the
stipulated conveyance suggests the existence of any further parol
agreement, an inspection of the contract, though it is complete on its
face in regard to the subject of the conveyance, does not, I think,
show that it was intended to embody negotiations or agreements, if
any, in regard to a matter so loosely bound to the conveyance as the
removal of an ice house from land not conveyed.
[19] The rule of integration undoubtedly frequently prevents the
assertion of fraudulent claims. Parties who take the precaution of
embodying their oral agreements in a writing should be protected
against the assertion that other terms of the same agreement were not
integrated in the writing. The limits of the integration are determined
by the writing, read in the light of the surrounding circumstances. A
written contract, however complete, yet covers only a limited field. I
do not think that in the written contract for the conveyance of land

10

here under consideration we can find an intention to cover a field so
broad as to include prior agreements, if any such were made, to do
other acts on other property after the stipulated conveyance was made.
[20] In each case where such a problem is presented, varying factors
enter into its solution. Citation of authority in this or other
jurisdictions is useless, at least without minute analysis of the facts.
The analysis I have made of the decisions in this State leads me to the
view that the decision of the courts below is in accordance with our
own authorities and should be affirmed.

1.2 Principal Case – Masterson v. Sine
Masterson v. Sine
Supreme Court of California
68 Cal. 2d. 222, 436 P.2d 561 (1968)
TRAYNOR, CHIEF JUSTICE.
[1] Dallas Masterson and his wife Rebecca owned a ranch as tenants
in common. On February 25, 1958, they conveyed it to Medora and
Lu Sine by a grant deed “Reserving unto the Grantors herein an
option to purchase the above described property on or before
February 25, 1968” for the “same consideration as being paid
heretofore plus their depreciation value of any improvements
Grantees may add to the property from and after two and a half years
from this date.” Medora is Dallas' sister and Lu's wife. Since the
conveyance Dallas has been adjudged bankrupt. His trustee in
bankruptcy and Rebecca brought this declaratory relief action to
establish their right to enforce the option.
[2] The case was tried without a jury. Over defendants' objection the
trial court admitted extrinsic evidence that by “the same consideration
as being paid heretofore” both the grantors and the grantees meant
the sum of $50,000 and by “depreciation value of any improvements”
they meant the depreciation value of improvements to be computed
by deducting from the total amount of any capital expenditures made
by defendants grantees the amount of depreciation allowable to them
under United States income tax regulations as of the time of the
exercise of the option.

11

[3] The court also determined that the parol evidence rule precluded
admission of extrinsic evidence offered by defendants to show that the
parties wanted the property kept in the Masterson family and that the
option was therefore personal to the grantors and could not be
exercised by the trustee in bankruptcy.
[4] The court entered judgment for plaintiffs, declaring their right to
exercise the option, specifying in some detail how it could be
exercised, and reserving jurisdiction to supervise the manner of its
exercise and to determine the amount that plaintiffs will be required to
pay defendants for their capital expenditures if plaintiffs decide to
exercise the option.
[5] Defendants appeal. They contend that the option provision is too
uncertain to be enforced and that extrinsic evidence as to its meaning
should not have been admitted. The trial court properly refused to
frustrate the obviously declared intention of the grantors to reserve an
option to repurchase by an overly meticulous insistence on
completeness and clarity of written expression. (See California Lettuce
Growers v. Union Sugar Co. (1955) 45 Cal.2d 474, 481, 289 P.2d 785, 49
A.L.R.2d 496; Rivers v. Beadle (1960) 183 Cal.App.2d 691, 695-697, 7
Cal.Rptr. 170.) It properly admitted extrinsic evidence to explain the
language of the deed (Nofziger v. Holman (1964) 61 Cal.2d 526, 528, 39
Cal.Rptr. 384, 393 P.2d 696; Barham v. Barham (1949) 33 Cal.2d 416,
422-423, 202 P.2d 289; Union Oil Co. v. Union Sugar Co. (1948) 31
Cal.2d 300, 306, 188 P.2d 470; Schmidt v. Macco Construction Co. (1953)
119 Cal.App.2d 717, 730, 260 P.2d 230; see Farnsworth, ‘Meaning’ in
the Law of Contracts (1967) 76 YALE L.J. 939, 959-965; Corbin, The
Interpretation of Words and the Parol Evidence Rule (1965) 50 CORNELL
L.Q. 161) to the end that the consideration for the option would
appear with sufficient certainty to permit specific enforcement (see
McKeon v. Santa Claus of California, Inc. (1964) 230 Cal.App.2d 359, 364,
41 Cal.Rptr. 43; Burrow v. Timmsen (1963) 223 Cal.App.2d 283, 288, 35
Cal.Rptr. 668, 100 A.L.R.2d 544). The trial court erred, however, in
excluding the extrinsic evidence that the option was personal to the
grantors and therefore nonassignable.
[6] When the parties to a written contract have agreed to it as an
“integration”—a complete and final embodiment of the terms of an
agreement—parol evidence cannot be used to add to or vary its terms.
(Pollyanna Homes, Inc. v. Berney (1961) 56 Cal.2d 676, 679-680, 16
Cal.Rptr. 345, 365 P.2d 401; Hale v. Bohannon (1952) 38 Cal.2d 458,
465, 241 P.2d 4; see 3 CORBIN, CONTRACTS (1960) § 573, p. 357;
REST., CONTRACTS (1932) §§ 228 (and com. a), 237; Code Civ.Proc., §

12

1856; Civ.Code, § 1625.) When only part of the agreement is
integrated, the same rule applies to that part, but parol evidence may
be used to prove elements of the agreement not reduced to writing.
(Hulse v. Juillard Fancy Foods Co. (1964) 61 Cal.2d 571, 573, 39 Cal.Rptr.
529, 394 P.2d 65; Schwartz v. Shapiro (1964) 229 Cal.App.2d 238, 250,
40 Cal.Rptr. 189; Mangini v. Wolfschmidt, Ltd. (1958) 165 Cal.App.2d
192, 200-201, 331 P.2d 728; REST., CONTRACTS (1932) § 239.)
[7] The crucial issue in determining whether there has been an
integration is whether the parties intended their writing to serve as the
exclusive embodiment of their agreement. The instrument itself may
help to resolve that issue. It may state, for example, that “there are no
previous understandings or agreements not contained in the writing,”
and thus express the parties' “intention to nullify antecedent
understandings or agreements.” (See 3 CORBIN, CONTRACTS (1960) §
578, p. 411.) Any such collateral agreement itself must be examined,
however, to determine whether the parties intended the subjects of
negotiation it deals with to be included in, excluded from, or otherwise
affected by the writing. Circumstances at the time of the writing may
also aid in the determination of such integration. (See 3 CORBIN,
CONTRACTS (1960) §§ 582-584; MCCORMICK, EVIDENCE (1954) §
216, p. 441; 9 WIGMORE, EVIDENCE (3d ed. 1940) § 2430, p. 98, §
2431, pp. 102-103; WITKIN, CAL. EVIDENCE (2d ed. 1966) § 721;
Schwartz v. Shapiro, supra, 229 Cal.App.2d 238, 251, fn. 8, 40 Cal.Rptr.
189; contra, 4 WILLISTON, CONTRACTS (3d ed. 1961) § 633, pp. 10141016.)
[8] California cases have stated that whether there was an integration
is to be determined solely from the face of the instrument (e.g.,
Thoroman v. David (1926) 199 Cal. 386, 389-390, 249 P. 513; Heffner v.
Gross (1919) 179 Cal. 738, 742-743, 178 P. 860; Gardiner v. McDonogh
(1905) 147 Cal. 313, 318-321, 81 P. 964; Harrison v. McCormick (1891)
89 Cal. 327, 330, 26 P. 830), and that the question for the court is
whether it ‘appears to be a complete…agreement….’ (See Ferguson v.
Koch (1928) 204 Cal. 342, 346, 268 P. 342, 344, 58 A.L.R. 1176;
Harrison v. McCormick, supra, 89 Cal. 327, 330, 26 P. 830.) Neither of
these strict formulations of the rule, however, has been consistently
applied. The requirement that the writing must appear incomplete on
its face has been repudiated in many cases where parol evidence was
admitted “to prove the existence of a separate oral agreement as to any
matter on which the document is silent and which is not inconsistent
with its terms”—even though the instrument appeared to state a
complete agreement. (E.g., American Industrial Sales Corp. v. Airscope, Inc.

13

(1955) 44 Cal.2d 393, 397, 282 P.2d 504, 506, 49 A.L.R.2d 1344;
Stockburger v. Dolan (1939) 14 Cal.2d 313, 317, 94 P.2d 33, 128 A.L.R.
83; Crawford v. France (1933) 219 Cal. 439, 443, 27 P.2d 645; Buckner v.
A. Leon & Co. (1928) 204 Cal. 225, 227, 267 P. 693; Sivers v. Sivers
(1893) 97 Cal. 518, 521, 32 P. 571; cf. Simmons v. California Institute of
Technology (1949) 34 Cal.2d 264, 274, 209 P.2d 581.) Even under the
rule that the writing alone is to be consulted, it was found necessary to
examine the alleged collateral agreement before concluding that proof
of it was precluded by the writing alone. (See 3 CORBIN, CONTRACTS
(1960) § 582, pp. 444-446.) It is therefore evident that “The
conception of a writing as wholly and intrinsically self-determinative of
the parties' intent to make it a sole memorial of one or seven or
twenty-seven subjects of negotiation is an impossible one.” (9
WIGMORE, EVIDENCE (3d ed. 1940) § 2431, p. 103.) For example, a
promissory note given by a debtor to his creditor may integrate all
their present contractual rights and obligations, or it may be only a
minor part of an underlying executory contract that would never be
discovered by examining the face of the note.
[9] In formulating the rule governing parol evidence, several policies
must be accommodated. One policy is based on the assumption that
written evidence is more accurate than human memory. (Germain Fruit
Co. v. J. K. Armsby Co. (1908) 153 Cal. 585, 595, 96 P. 319.) This policy,
however, can be adequately served by excluding parol evidence of
agreements that directly contradict the writing. Another policy is based
on the fear that fraud or unintentional invention by witnesses
interested in the outcome of the litigation will mislead the finder of
facts. (Germain Fruit Co. v. J. K. Armsby Co., supra, 153 Cal. 585, 596, 96
P. 319; Mitchill v. Lath (1928) 247 N.Y. 377, 388, 160 N.E. 646, 68
A.L.R. 239 (dissenting opinion by Lehman, J.); see 9 WIGMORE,
EVIDENCE (3d ed. 1940) § 2431, p. 102; Murray, The Parol Evidence
Rule: A Clarification (1966) 4 DUQUESNE L. REV. 337, 338-339.)
McCormick has suggested that the party urging the spoken as against
the written word is most often the economic underdog, threatened by
severe hardship if the writing is enforced. In his view the parol
evidence rule arose to allow the court to control the tendency of the
jury to find through sympathy and without a dispassionate assessment
of the probability of fraud or faulty memory that the parties made an
oral agreement collateral to the written contract, or that preliminary
tentative agreements were not abandoned when omitted from the
writing. (See MCCORMICK, EVIDENCE (1954) § 210.) He recognizes,
however, that if this theory were adopted in disregard of all other
considerations, it would lead to the exclusion of testimony concerning

14

oral agreements whenever there is a writing and thereby often defeat
the true intent of the parties. See MCCORMICK, op. cit. supra, § 216, p.
441.)
[10] Evidence of oral collateral agreements should be excluded only
when the fact finder is likely to be misled. The rule must therefore be
based on the credibility of the evidence. One such standard, adopted
by section 240(1)(b) of the Restatement of Contracts, permits proof of
a collateral agreement if it “is such an agreement as might naturally be
made as a separate agreement by parties situated as were the parties to
the written contract.” (Italics added; see MCCORMICK, EVIDENCE
(1954) § 216, p. 441; see also 3 CORBIN, CONTRACTS (1960) § 583, p.
475, § 594, pp. 568-569; 4 WILLISTON, CONTRACTS (3d ed. 1961) §
638, pp. 1039-1045.) The draftsmen of the Uniform Commercial Code
would exclude the evidence in still fewer instances: “If the additional
terms are such that, if agreed upon, they would certainly have been
included in the document in the view of the court, then evidence of
their alleged making must be kept from the trier of fact.” (Com. 3, § 2202, italics added.)i
[11] The option clause in the deed in the present case does not
explicitly provide that it contains the complete agreement, and the
deed is silent on the question of assignability. Moreover, the difficulty
of accommodating the formalized structure of a deed to the insertion
of collateral agreements makes it less likely that all the terms of such
an agreement were included.ii (See 3 CORBIN, CONTRACTS (1960) §
587; 4 WILLISTON, CONTRACTS (3d ed. 1961) § 645; 70 A.L.R. 752,
759 (1931); 68 A.L.R. 245 (1930).) The statement of the reservation of
the option might well have been placed in the recorded deed solely to
preserve the grantors' rights against any possible future purchasers and
this function could well be served without any mention of the parties'
agreement that the option was personal. There is nothing in the record
to indicate that the parties to this family transaction, through
experience in land transactions or otherwise, had any warning of the
disadvantages of failing to put the whole agreement in the deed. This
case is one, therefore, in which it can be said that a collateral
agreement such as that alleged “might naturally be made as a separate
agreement.” A fortiori, the case is not one in which the parties ‘would
certainly’ have included the collateral agreement in the deed.
[12] It is contended, however, that an option agreement is ordinarily
presumed to be assignable if it contains no provisions forbidding its
transfer or indicating that its performance involves elements personal
to the parties. (Mott v. Cline (1927) 200 Cal. 434, 450, 253 P. 718;

15

Altman v. Blewett (1928) 93 Cal. App. 516, 525, 269 P. 751.) The fact
that there is a written memorandum, however, does not necessarily
preclude parol evidence rebutting a term that the law would otherwise
presume. In American Industrial Sales Corp. v. Airscope, Inc., supra, 44
Cal.2d 393, 397-398, 282 P.2d 504, we held it proper to admit parol
evidence of a contemporaneous collateral agreement as to the place of
payment of a note, even though it contradicted the presumption that a
note, silent as to the place of payment, is payable where the creditor
resides. (For other examples of this approach, see Richter v. Union Land
etc. Co. (1900) 129 Cal. 367, 375, 62 P. 39 (presumption of time of
delivery rebutted by parol evidence); Wolters v. King (1897) 119 Cal.
172, 175-176, 51 P. 35 (presumption of time of payment rebutted by
parol evidence); Mangini v. Wolfschmidt, Ltd., supra, 165 Cal.App.2d 192,
198-201, 331 P.2d 728 (presumption of duration of an agency contract
rebutted by parol evidence); Zinn v. Ex-Cell-O Corp. (1957) 148
Cal.App.2d 56, 73-74, 306 P.2d 1017; see also REST., CONTRACTS, §
240, com. c.)iii Of course a statute may preclude parol evidence to
rebut a statutory presumption. (E.g., Neff v. Ernst (1957) 48 Cal.2d 628,
635, 311 P.2d 849 (commenting on Civ.Code, § 1112); Kilfoy v. Fritz
(1954) 125 Cal.App.2d 291, 293-294, 270 P.2d 579 (applying Deering's
Gen.Laws 1937, Act 652, § 15a; see also Com.Code, § 9-318, subd.
(4).) Here, however, there is no such statute. In the absence of a
controlling statute the parties may provide that a contract right or duty
is nontransferable. (La Rue v. Groezinger (1890) 84 Cal. 281, 283, 24 P.
42; Benton v. Hofmann Plastering Co. (1962) 207 Cal.App.2d 61, 68, 24
Cal.Rptr. 268; Parkinson v. Caldwell (1954) 126 Cal.App.2d 548, 552553, 272 P.2d 934; see 4 CORBIN, CONTRACTS (1951) §§ 872-873.)
Moreover, even when there is no explicit agreement—written or
oral—that contractual duties shall be personal, courts will effectuate
presumed intent to that effect if the circumstances indicate that
performance by [a] substituted person would be different from that
contracted for. (Farmland Irrigation Co. v. Dopplmaier (1957) 48 Cal.2d
208, 222, 308 P.2d 732, 66 A.L.R.2d 590; Prichard v. Kimball (1923) 190
Cal. 757, 764-765, 214 P. 863; Simmons v. Zimmerman (1904) 144 Cal.
256, 260-261, 79 P. 451; La Rue v. Groezinger, supra, 84 Cal. 281, 285, 24
P. 42; Coykendall v. Jackson (1936) 17 Cal.App.2d 729, 731, 62 P.2d 746;
see 4 CORBIN, CONTRACTS (1951) § 865; 3 WILLISTON, CONTRACTS
(3d ed. 1960) § 412, pp. 32-33; REST., CONTRACTS (Tent. Draft No. 3,
1967) § 150(2).)
[13] In Standard Box Co. v. Mutual Biscuit Co. (1909) 10 Cal.App. 746,
750, 103 P. 938, 940, the rationale of Gardiner v. McDonogh was
extended to exclude evidence of an agreement for a time of

16

performance other than the “reasonable time” implied by law in a
situation where the writing, although stating no time of performance,
was “clear and complete when aided by that which is imported into it
by legal implication.” This decision was simply an application of the
then-current theory regarding integration. The court regarded the
instrument as a complete integration, and it therefore precluded proof
of collateral agreements. Since it is now clear that integration cannot
be determined from the writing alone, the decision is not authoritative
insofar as it finds a complete integration. There is no reason to believe
that the court gave any independent significance to implied terms. Had
the court found from the writing alone that there was no integration,
there is nothing to indicate that it would have excluded proof contrary
to terms it would have otherwise presumed.
[14] In Buffalo Arms, Inc. v. Remler Co. (1960) 179 Cal.App.2d 700, 710,
4 Cal.Rptr. 103, the court refused to admit parol evidence showing a
collateral oral agreement that a buyer would have more than the
‘reasonable time’ presumed by law to refuse goods, but the decision is
based on a conclusion that the writing on its face was a complete
expression of the agreement. In La France v. Kashishian (1928) 204 Cal.
643, 645, 269 P. 655, and Fogler v. Purkiser (1932) 127 Cal.App. 554,
559-560, 16 P.2d 305, there are no clear findings concerning the
completeness of the writings; but the argument in each case is
borrowed from the Standard Box Co. decision and thus implies a
finding of a complete integration. Calpetro Producers Syndicate v. C. M.
Woods Co. (1929) 206 Cal. 246, 247-248, 252, 274 P. 65, relies on
Standard Box Co. and expressly finds a complete integration.
[15] In the present case defendants offered evidence that the parties
agreed that the option was not assignable in order to keep the property
in the Masterson family. The trial court erred in excluding that
evidence.
[16] The judgment is reversed.
PETERS, TOBRINER, MOSK, AND SULLIVAN, JJ., CONCUR.

Dissenting Opinion
Burke, Justice
[17]

I dissent. The majority opinion:

(1) Undermines the parol evidence rule as we have known it in this state
since at least 1872iv by declaring that parol evidence should have been

17

admitted by the trial court to show that a written option, absolute and
unrestricted in form, was intended to be limited and nonassignable;
(2) Renders suspect instruments of conveyance absolute on their face;
(3) Materially lessens the reliance which may be placed upon written
instruments affecting the title to real estate; and
(4) Opens the door, albeit unintentionally to a new technique for the
defrauding of creditors.
[18]
The opinion permits defendants to establish by parol testimony
that their grantv to their brother (and brother-in-law) of a written option,
absolute in terms, was nevertheless agreed to be nonassignable by the
grantee (now a bankrupt), and that therefore the right to exercise it did not
pass, by operation of the bankruptcy laws, to the trustee for the benefit of
the grantee's creditors.
[19]
And how was this to be shown? By the proffered testimony of the
bankrupt optionee himself! Thereby one of his assets (the option to
purchase defendants' California ranch) would be withheld from the trustee
in bankruptcy and from the bankrupt's creditors. Understandably the trial
court, as required by the parol evidence rule, did not allow the bankrupt by
parol to so contradict the unqualified language of the written option.
[20]
The court properly admitted parol evidence to explain the
intended meaning of the “same consideration” and “depreciation value”
phrases of the written option to purchase defendants' land, as the intended
meaning of those phrases was not clear. However, there was nothing
ambiguous about the granting language of the option and not the slightest
suggestion in the document that the option was to be nonassignable. Thus,
to permit such words of limitation to be added by parol is to contradict the
absolute nature of the grant, and to directly violate the parol evidence rule.
[21]
Just as it is unnecessary to state in a deed to “lot X” that the
house located thereon goes with the land, it is likewise unnecessary to add
to “I grant an option to Jones” the words “and his assigns” for the option
to be assignable. As hereinafter emphasized in more detail, California
statutes expressly declare that it is assignable, and only if I add language in
writing showing my intent to withhold or restrict the right of assignment
may the grant be so limited. Thus, to seek to restrict the grant by parol is
to contradict the written document in violation of the parol evidence rule.

18

[22]
The majority opinion arrives at its holding via a series of false
premises which are not supported either in the record of this case or in
such California authorities as are offered.
[The remainder of the dissent presents a point-by-point refutation of the
majority’s reasoning. Although I have elected to reprint these pages for the
benefit of those students who might find the analysis interesting, you
should feel free to skim this material if you are at all pressed for time (or
prone to drowsiness). To say that Justice Burke’s writing style is somewhat
soporific would be to dramatically understate its likely effect on your level
of alertness. Forewarned is forearmed. ]
[23]
The parol evidence rule is set forth in clear and definite language
in the statutes of this state. (Civ.Code, § 1625; Code Civ.Proc., § 1856.) It
“is not a rule of evidence but is one of substantive law….The rule as
applied to contracts is simply that as a matter of substantive law, a certain
act, the act of embodying the complete terms of an agreement in a writing
(the ‘integration’), Becomes the contract of the parties.” (Hale v.
Bohannon (1952) 38 Cal.2d 458, 465, 241 P.2d 4, 7(1, 2), quoting from In
re Estate of Gaines (1940) 15 Cal.2d 255, 264-265, 100 P.2d 1055.) The
rule is based upon the sound principle that the parties to a written
instrument, after committing their agreement to or evidencing it by the
writing, are not permitted to add to, vary or contradict the terms of the
writing by parol evidence. As aptly expressed by the author of the present
majority opinion, speaking for the court in Parsons v. Bristol
Development Co. (1965) 62 Cal.2d 861, 865(2), 44 Cal.Rptr. 767, 402 P.2d
839, and in Coast Bank v. Minderhout (1964) 61 Cal.2d 311, 315, 38
Cal.Rptr. 505, 507, 392 P.2d 265, 267, such evidence is “admissible to
interpret the instrument, but not to give it a meaning to which it is not
reasonably susceptible.” (Italics added.) Or, as stated by the same author,
concurring in Laux v. Freed (1960) 53 Cal.2d 512, 527, 2 Cal.Rptr. 265,
273, 348 P.2d 873, 881, “extrinsic evidence is not admissible to add to,
detract from, or vary its terms.” (Italics added.)
[24]
At the outset the majority in the present case reiteratevi that the
rule against contradicting or varying the terms of a writing remains
applicable when only part of the agreement is contained in the writing, and
parol evidence is used to prove elements of the agreement not reduced to
writing. But having restated this established rule, the majority opinion
inexplicably proceeds to subvert it.

19

[25]
Each of the three cases cited by the majority (fn. 3, Ante) holds
that although parol evidence is admissible to prove the parts of the
contract not put in writing, it is not admissible to vary or contradict the
writing or prove collateral agreements which are inconsistent therewith. The
meaning of this rule (and the application of it found in the cases) is that if
the asserted unwritten elements of the agreement would contradict, add to,
detract from, vary or be inconsistent with the written agreement, then such
elements may not be shown by parol evidence.
[26]
The contract of sale and purchase of the ranch property here
involved was carried out through a title company upon written escrow
instructions executed by the respective parties after various preliminary
negotiations. The deed to defendant grantees, in which the grantors
expressly reserved an option to repurchase the property within a ten-year
period and upon a specified consideration, was issued and delivered in
consummation of the contract. In neither the written escrow instructions
nor the deed containing the option is there any language even suggesting
that the option was agreed or intended by the parties to be personal to the
grantors, and so nonassignable. The trial judge, on at least three separate
occasions, correctly sustained objections to efforts of defendant optionors
to get into evidence the testimony of Dallas Masterson (the bankrupt
holder of the option) that a part of the agreement of sale of the parties was
that the option to repurchase the property was personal to him, and
therefore unassignable for benefit of creditors. But the majority hold that
that testimony should have been admitted, thereby permitting defendant
optionors to limit, detract from and contradict the plain and unrestricted
terms of the written option in clear violation of the parol evidence rule
and to open the door to the perpetration of fraud.
[27]
Options are property, and are widely used in the sale and purchase
of real and personal property. One of the basic incidents of property
ownership is the right of the owner to sell or transfer it. The author of the
present majority opinion, speaking for the court in Farmland Irrigation
Co. v. Dopplmaier (1957) 48 Cal.2d 208, 222, 308 P.2d 732, 740, 66
A.L.R.2d 590, put it this way: “The statutes in this state clearly manifest a
policy in favor of the free transferability of all types of property, including
rights under contracts.”vii (Citing Civ.Code, §§ 954, 1044, 1458;viii see also
40 Cal.Jur.2d 289-291, and cases there cited.) These rights of the owner of
property to transfer it, confirmed by the cited code sections, are
elementary rules of substantive law and not the mere disputable
presumptions which the majority opinion in the present case would make

20

of them. Moreover, the right of transferability applies to an option to
purchase, unless there are words of limitation in the option forbidding its
assignment or showing that it was given because of a peculiar trust or
confidence reposed in the optionee. ( Mott v. Cline (1927) 200 Cal. 434,
450(11), 253 P. 718; Prichard v. Kimball (1923) 190 Cal. 757, 764-765(4,
5), 214 P. 867; Altman v. Blewett (1928) 93 Cal.App. 516, 525(3), 269 P.
751; see also 5 Cal.Jur.2d 393, 395-396, and cases there cited.) Thus, in
Prichard the language of the document itself (a written, expressly nonassignable
lease, with option to buy) was held to establish the trust or confidence
reposed in the optionee and so to negate assignability of the option.
[28]
The right of an optionee to transfer his option to purchase
property is accordingly one of the basic rights which accompanies the
option unless limited under the language of the option itself. To allow an
optionor to resort to parol evidence to support his assertion that the
written option is not transferable is to authorize him to limit the option by
attempting to restrict and reclaim rights with which he has already parted.
A clearer violation of two substantive and basic rules of law—the parol
evidence rule and the right of free transferability of property—would be
difficult to conceive.
[29]
The majority opinion attempts to buttress its approach by
asserting that “California cases have stated that whether there was an
integration is to be determined solely from the face of the instrument
(citations), and that the question for the court is whether it ‘appears to be a
complete…agreement….’” (citations), but that “Neither of these strict
formulations of the rule…has been consistently applied.”
[30]
The majority's claim of inconsistent application of the parol
evidence rule by the California courts fails to find support in the examples
offered. First, the majority opinion asserts that “The requirement that the
writing must appear incomplete on its face has been repudiated in many
cases where parol evidence was admitted ‘to prove the existence of a
separate oral agreement as to any matter on which the document is silent
and which is not inconsistent with its terms'—even though the instrument
appeared to state a complete agreement. (Citations.)” But an examination
of the cases cited in support of the quoted statement discloses that on the
contrary in every case which is pertinent here (with a single exception) the
writing was obviously incomplete on its face.ix In the one exception
(Stockburger v. Dolan (1939) 14 Cal.2d 313, 317, 94 P.2d 33, 128 A.L.R.
83) it was held that lessors under a lease to drill for oil in an area zoned
against such drilling should be permitted to show by parol that the lessee

21

had contemporaneously agreed orally to seek a variance—an agreement
which, as the opinion points out, did not contradict the written contract.
But what is additionally noteworthy in Stockburger, and controlling here, is
the further holding that lessors could not show by parol that lessee had
orally agreed that a lease provision suspending payment of rental under
certain circumstances would not apply during certain periods of time—as
“evidence to that effect would vary the terms of the contract in that
particular….” (P. 317(5) of 14 Cal.2d p. 35 of 94 P.2d.)
[31]
In further pursuit of what would appear to be nonexistent support
for its assertions of inconsistency in California cases, the majority opinion
next declares (p. 548) that “Even under the rule that the writing alone is to
be consulted, it was found necessary to examine the alleged collateral
agreement before concluding that proof of it was precluded by the writing
alone. (See 3 Corbin, Contracts (1960) § 582, pp. 444-446.)” Not only are
no California cases cited by the majority in supposed support for the
quoted declaration (offered by the majority as an example of inconsistent
applications of the parol evidence rule by California courts), but 3 Corbin,
Contracts, which the majority do cite, likewise refers to no California cases,
and makes but scanty citation to any cases whatever. In any event, in what
manner other than by “examining” an alleged collateral agreement is it
possible for a court to rule upon the admissibility of testimony or upon an
offer of proof with respect to such agreement?
[32]
The majority opinion has thus demonstrably failed to substantiate
its next utterance (p. 548) that “The conception of a writing as wholly and
intrinsically self-determinative of the parties' intent to make it a sole
memorial of one or seven or twenty-seven subjects of negotiation is an
impossible one,” citing 9 Wigmore, Evidence (3d ed. 1940) section 2431,
page 103, whose views on the subject were Rejected by this court as early
as 1908 in Germain Fruit Co. v. J. K. Armsby Co., 153 Cal. 585, 595, 96 P.
319, which, indeed, is also cited by the majority in the present case. And
the example given, that of a promissory note, is obviously specious. Rarely,
if ever, does a promissory note given by a debtor to his creditor integrate
all their agreements (that is not the purpose it serves); it may or it may not
integrate all their present contractual rights and obligations; but relevant to
the parol evidence rule, at least until the advent of the majority opinion in
this case, alleged collateral agreements which would vary or contradict the
terms and conditions of a promissory note may not be shown by parol.
(Bank of America etc. Ass'n v. Pendergrass (1935) 4 Cal.2d 258, 263264(6), 48 P.2d 659.)

22

[33]
Upon this structure of incorrect premises and unfounded
assertions the majority opinion arrives at its climax: The pronouncement
of “several policies [to] be accommodated…[i]n formulating the rule governing
parol evidence.” (Italics added.)x Two of the “policies” as declared by the
majority are: Written evidence is more accurate than human memoryxi
fraud or unintentional invention by interested witnesses may well occur.
[34]
I submit that these purported “policies” are in reality two of the
basic and obvious reasons for adoption by the legislature of the parol
evidence rule as the policy in this state. Thus the speculation of the
majority concerning the views of various writers on the subject and the
advisability of following them in this state is not only superfluous but flies
flatly in the face of established California law and policy. It serves only to
introduce uncertainty and confusion in a field of substantive law which
was codified and made certain in this state a century ago.
[35]
However, despite the law which until the advent of the present
majority opinion has been firmly and clearly established in California and
relied upon by attorneys and courts alike, that parol evidence may not be
employed to vary or contradict the terms of a written instrument, the
majority now announce (p. 548) that such evidence “should be excluded
only when the fact finder is likely to be misled,” and that “The rule must
therefore be based on the credibility of the evidence.” (Italics added.) But
was it not, inter alia, to avoid misleading the fact finder, and to further the
introduction of only the evidence which is most likely to be credible (the
written document), that the Legislature adopted the parol evidence rule as
a part of the substantive law of this state?
[36]
Next, in an effort to implement this newly promulgated
“credibility” test, the majority opinion offers a choice of two “standards”:
one, a “certainty” standard, quoted from the Uniform Commercial Code,
xii and the other a “natural” standard found in the Restatement of
Contracts, xiii and concludes that at least for purposes of the present case
the “natural” viewpoint should prevail.
[37]
This new rule, not hitherto recognized in California, provides that
proof of a claimed collateral oral agreement is admissible if it is such an
agreement as might naturally have been made a separate agreement by the
parties under the particular circumstances. I submit that this approach
opens the door to uncertainty and confusion. Who can know what its
limits are? Certainly I do not. For example, in its application to this case
who could be expected to divine as “natural” a separate oral agreement

23

between the parties that the assignment, absolute and unrestricted on its
face, was intended by the parties to be limited to the Masterson family?
[38]
Or, assume that one gives to his relative a promissory note and
that the payee of the note goes bankrupt. By operation of law the note
becomes an asset of the bankruptcy. The trustee attempts to enforce it.
Would the relatives be permitted to testify that by a separate oral
agreement made at the time of the execution of the note it was understood
that should the payee fail in his business the maker would be excused from
payment of the note, or that, as here, it was intended that the benefits of
the note would be personal to the payee? I doubt that trial judges should
be burdened with the task of conjuring whether it would have been
‘natural under those circumstances for such a separate agreement to have
been made by the parties. Yet, under the application of the proposed rule,
this is the task the trial judge would have, and in essence the situation
presented in the instant case is no different.
[39]
Under the application of the codes and the present case law,
proof of the existence of such an agreement would not be permitted,
“natural” or “unnatural.” But conceivably, as loose as the new rule is, one
judge might deem it natural and another judge unnatural.xiv And in each
instance the ultimate decision would have to be made (“naturally”) on a
case-by-case basis by the appellate courts.
[40]
In an effort to provide justification for applying the newly
pronounced “natural” rule to the circumstances of the present case, the
majority opinion next attempts to account for the silence of the writing in
this case concerning assignability of the option, by asserting that “the
difficulty of accommodating the formalized structure of a deed to the
insertion of collateral agreements makes it less likely that all the terms of
such an agreement were included.” What difficulty would have been
involved here, to add the words “this option is nonassignable”? The
asserted “formalized structure of a deed” is no formidable barrier. The
Legislature has set forth the requirements in simple language in section
1092 of the Civil Code. It is this: “I, A B, grant to C D all that real
property situated in (naming county), State of California…described as
follows: (describing it).” To this the grantor desiring to reserve an option
to repurchase need only so state, as was done here. It is a matter of
common knowledge that collateral agreements (such as the option clause
here involved, or such as deed restrictions) are frequently included in
deeds, without difficulty of any nature.

24

[41]
To support further speculation, that “the reservation of the
option might well have been placed in the recorded deed solely to preserve
the grantors' rights against any possible future purchasers, and this
function could well be served without any mention of the parties'
agreement that the option was personal,” the majority assert that “There is
nothing in the record to indicate that the parties to this family transaction,
through experience in land transactions or otherwise, had any warning of
the disadvantages of failing to put the whole agreement in the deed.”
(Italics added.) The facts of this case, however, do not support such claim
of naivete. The grantor husband (the bankrupt businessman) testified that
as none of the parties were attorneys “we wanted to contact my
attorney…which we did….The wording in the option was obtained from
(the attorney). …I told him what my discussion was with the Sines
(defendant grantees) and he wanted…a little time to compose it…. And,
then this (the wording provided by the attorney) was taken to the title
company at the time Mr. and Mrs. Sine and I went in to complete the
transaction.” (Italics added.) The witness was an experienced businessman
who thus demonstrated awareness of the wisdom of seeking legal guidance
and advice in this business transaction, and who did so. Wherein lies the
naive family transaction postulated by the majority?
[42]
The majority opinion then proceeds on the fallacious assertion
that the right to transfer or to assign an option, if it contains no provisions
forbidding transfer or indicating that performance involves elements
personal to the parties, is a mere disputable presumption, and in purported
support cites cases not one of which involves an option and in each of
which the presumption which was invoked served to supply a missing but
essential element of a complete agreement.xv As already emphasized
hereinabove, the right of free transferability of property, including options,
is one of the most fundamental tenets of substantive law, and the crucial
distinction would appear self-evident between such a basic right on the
one hand, and on the other hand the disputable evidentiary presumptions
which the law has developed to supply terms lacking from a written
instrument but essential to making it whole and complete. There is no
such lack in the deed and the option reservation now at issue.
[43]
The statement of the majority opinion that in the absence of a
controlling statute the parties may provide that a contract right or duty is
nontransferable, is of course true. Equally true is the next assertion that
“even when there is no explicit agreement—written or oral—that
contractual duties shall be personal, courts will effectuate a presumed

25

intent to that effect if the circumstances indicate that performance by a
substituted person would be different from that contracted for.” But to
apply the law of contracts for the rendering of personal services to the
reservation of an option in a deed of real estate calls for a misdirected use
of the rule, particularly in an instrument containing not one word from
which such “a presumed intent to that effect” could be gleaned.
Particularly is the holding objectionable when the result is to upset
established statutory and case law in this state that “circumstances” shown
by parol may not be employed to contradict, add to or detract from, the
agreement of the parties as expressed by them in writing. And once again
the quoted pronouncement of the majority concerning the showing of
“circumstances” by parol fails to find support in the cases they cite,xvi
which relate to a patent license agreement, held to be assignable absent
terms indicating a contrary intent; a contract to sell grapes, also held
assignable; a contract which included language showing the intent that it
be nonassignable; a contract to buy land held to be assignable because
approval of title by the buyer was held not to be a personal privilege
attaching only to the assignor; and to contracts for personal services.
[44]
In Prichard v. Kimball, supra (1923) 190 Cal. 757, 764-765, 214 P.
863, next cited by the majority, the written contract contained language
showing the intent that it be nonassignable (as already pointed out
hereinabove). Simmons v. Zimmerman (1904) 144 Cal. 256, 260-261, 79 P.
451, held that a contract to buy land was assignable, as approval of title by
the buyer is not a personal privilege attaching only to the assignor (the
party to whom the seller agreed to sell). La Rue v. Groezinger has already
been shown not to support the majority's proposition here. And the last
case which the majority cite, Coykendall v. Jackson (1936) 17 Cal.App.2d
729, 731, 62 P.2d 746, involved a contract for personal services, almost
uniformly held to be nonassignable; it did not deal with a contract or an
option to buy property, which ordinarily imposes no other obligation on
the buyer than to make payment, as does the option now before this court.
[45]
Neither personal skill nor personal qualities can be conjured as a
requirement for the exercise of the option reserved in the deed here,
regardless of how ardent may be the desire of the parties (the bankrupt
husband-optionee and his sister), “to keep the property in the … family.”
Particularly is this true when a contrary holding would permit the property
to be acquired by plaintiff referee in bankruptcy for the benefit of the
creditors of the bankrupt husband.

26

[46]
Comment hardly seems necessary on the convenience to a
bankrupt of such a device to defeat his creditors. He need only produce
parol testimony that any options (or other property, for that matter) which
he holds are subject to an oral “collateral agreement” with family members
(or with friends) that the property is nontransferable “in order to keep the
property in the family” or in the friendly group. In the present case the
value of the ranch which the bankrupt and his wife held an option to
purchase has doubtless increased substantially during the years since they
acquired the option. The initiation of this litigation by the trustee in
bankruptcy to establish his right to enforce the option indicates his belief
that there is substantial value to be gained for the creditors from this asset
of the bankrupt. Yet the majority opinion permits defeat of the trustee and
of the creditors through the device of an asserted collateral oral agreement
that the option was “personal” to the bankrupt and nonassignable “in
order to keep the property in the family”!xvii
[47]
It also seems appropriate to inquire as to the rights of plaintiff
wife in the option which she holds with her bankrupt husband. Is her
interest therein also subject to being shown to be personal and not salable
or assignable? And, what are her rights and those of her husband in the
ranch land itself, if they exercise their option to purchase it? Will they be
free to then sell the land? Or, if they prefer, may they hold it beyond the
reach of creditors? Or can other members of “the family” claim some sort
of restriction on it in perpetuity, established by parol evidence?
[48]
And if defendants sell the land subject to the option, will the new
owners be heard to assert that the option is “personal” to the optionees,
“in order to keep the property in the Masterson family”? Or is that claim
“personal” to defendants only?
[49]
These are only a few of the confusions and inconsistencies which
will arise to plague property owners and, incidentally, attorneys and title
companies, who seek to counsel and protect them.
[50]
I would hold that the trial court ruled correctly on the proffered
parol evidence, and would affirm the judgment.
McComb, J., concurs.

1.2.1 Discussion of Mitchill v. Lath and Masterson v. Sine
In Mitchill v. Lath, how does the court decide whether the written agreement
was integrated?

27

If you thought that the oral agreement to tear down the ice house had truly
been made, can you think of any policy justification for a rule that
nevertheless refuses to enforce that agreement?
What exactly is the basis for the court’s ruling, in Masterson v. Sine, that
proof of the alleged oral agreement is admissible?
Do you think that the parties really made the agreement making the
repurchase right non-assignable?
1.2.2 The Use of Merger Clauses
Most commercial parties use a “merger clause” (or “integration clause” or
“entire agreement clause”) to signal that they intend for a court to construe
their written agreement as the final and exclusive statement of their
agreement. Some commonly used versions of such a clause include the
following:
This Agreement represents the Parties’ entire
understanding regarding the subject matter herein.
None of the terms of this Agreement can be waived
or modified, except by an express agreement signed
by the Parties. There are no representations,
promises, warranties, covenants, or undertakings
between the Parties other than those expressly set
forth in this Agreement.
OR
This agreement constitutes the entire agreement
between the parties. There are no understandings,
agreements, or representations, oral or written, not
specified herein regarding this agreement.
Contractor, by the signature below of its authorized
representative, hereby acknowledges that the
Contractor has read this agreement, understands it,
and agrees to be bound by its terms and conditions.
OR
This Agreement, along with any exhibits,
appendices, addendums, schedules, and amendments
hereto, encompasses the entire agreement of the
parties, and supersedes all previous understandings
and agreements between the parties, whether oral or
written. The parties hereby acknowledge and
represent, by affixing their hands and seals hereto,
that said parties have not relied on any
representation, assertion, guarantee, warranty,

28

collateral contract or other assurance, except those
set out in this Agreement, made by or on behalf of
any other party or any other person or entity
whatsoever, prior to the execution of this
Agreement. The parties hereby waive all rights and
remedies, at law or in equity, arising or which may
arise as the result of a party’s reliance on such
representation, assertion, guarantee, warranty,
collateral contract or other assurance, provided that
nothing herein contained shall be construed as a
restriction or limitation of said party’s right to
remedies associated with the gross negligence, willful
misconduct or fraud of any person or party taking
place prior to, or contemporaneously with, the
execution of this Agreement.
OR
This Agreement and the exhibits attached hereto
contain the entire agreement of the parties with
respect to the subject matter of this Agreement, and
supersede all prior negotiations, agreements and
understandings with respect thereto. This Agreement
may only be amended by a written document duly
executed by all parties.

Courts typically enforce merger clauses as a matter of course unless they
find evidence of procedural unconscionability. See, e.g., Brinderson-Newberg
Joint Venture v. Pacific Erectors, Inc., 971 F.2d 272, 276 (9th Cir. 1992)
(enforcing merger clause as bar to parol evidence).
1.2.3 The Restatement Formulation of the Parol Evidence
Rule
It should be apparent from reading Mitchill v. Lath and Masterson v. Sine that
there is no consensus among judges or jurisdictions about when to consider
evidence of prior or contemporaneous oral agreements. Nevertheless, there
is broad agreement about the general doctrinal framework within which
these issues are analyzed. Whether textualist or contextualist, jurists all ask
first whether the written agreement is partially or completely “integrated”
and then whether the proffered additional terms are “consistent” with the
writing. The Restatement (Second) of Contracts formulates these rules as
follows:

29

§ 209. Integrated Agreements
(1) An integrated agreement is a writing or writings
constituting a final expression of one or more terms of an
agreement.
(2) Whether there is an integrated agreement is to be
determined by the court as a question preliminary to
determination of a question of interpretation or to
application of the parol evidence rule.
(3) Where the parties reduce an agreement to a writing
which in view of its completeness and specificity
reasonably appears to be a complete agreement, it is taken
to be an integrated agreement unless it is established by
other evidence that the writing did not constitute a final
expression.
§ 210. Completely
Agreements

and

Partially

Integrated

(1) A completely integrated agreement is an integrated
agreement adopted by the parties as a complete and
exclusive statement of the terms of the agreement.
(2) A partially integrated agreement is an integrated
agreement other than a completely integrated agreement.
(3) Whether an agreement is completely or partially
integrated is to be determined by the court as a question
preliminary to determination of a question of
interpretation or to application of the parol evidence rule.
§ 213. Effect of Integrated Agreement on Prior
Agreements (Parol Evidence Rule)
(1) A binding integrated agreement discharges prior
agreements to the extent that it is inconsistent with them.
(2) A binding completely integrated agreement discharges
prior agreements to the extent that they are within its
scope.

30

(3) An integrated agreement that is not binding or that is
voidable and avoided does not discharge a prior
agreement. But an integrated agreement, even though not
binding, may be effective to render inoperative a term
which would have been part of the agreement if it had not
been integrated.
§ 214. Evidence of Prior or Contemporaneous
Agreements and Negotiations
Agreements and negotiations prior to or contemporaneous
with the adoption of a writing are admissible in evidence
to establish
(a) that the writing is or is not an integrated
agreement;
(b) that the integrated agreement, if any, is
completely or partially integrated;
(c) the meaning of the writing, whether or not
integrated;
(d) illegality, fraud, duress, mistake, lack of
consideration, or other invalidating cause;
(e) ground for granting or denying rescission,
reformation, specific performance, or other
remedy.
§ 215. Contradiction of Integrated Terms
Except as stated in the preceding Section, where there is a
binding agreement, either completely or partially
integrated, evidence of prior or contemporaneous
agreements or negotiations is not admissible in evidence to
contradict a term of the writing.
§ 216 Consistent Additional Terms
(1) Evidence of a consistent additional term is admissible
to supplement an integrated agreement unless the court
finds that the agreement was completely integrated.

31

(2) An agreement is not completely integrated if the
writing omits a consistent additional agreed term which is
(a) agreed to for separate consideration, or
(b) such a term as in the circumstances might
naturally be omitted from the writing.

2. The UCC Parol Evidence Rule
The same problems of identifying and interpreting contract terms that arise
under the common law also affect transactions involving the sale of goods.
The Uniform Commercial Code includes a section that, unsurprisingly,
embraces a thoroughly contextualist approach to these issues.
§ 2-202 Final Written Expression: Parol or Extrinsic
Evidence.
Terms with respect to which the confirmatory memoranda
of the parties agree or which are otherwise set forth in a
writing intended by the parties as a final expression of their
agreement with respect to such terms as are included
therein may not be contradicted by evidence of any prior
agreement or of a contemporaneous oral agreement but
may be explained or supplemented
(a) by course of dealing or usage of trade (Section
1-205) or by course of performance (Section 2208); and
(b) by evidence of consistent additional terms
unless the court finds the writing to have been
intended also as a complete and exclusive
statement of the terms of the agreement.
Official Comment
Purposes:
1. This section definitely rejects:
(a) Any assumption that because a writing has
been worked out which is final on some matters, it
is to be taken as including all the matters agreed
upon;

32

(b) The premise that the language used has the
meaning attributable to such language by rules of
construction existing in the law rather than the
meaning which arises out of the commercial
context in which it was used; and
(c) The requirement that a condition precedent to
the admissibility of the type of evidence specified
in paragraph (a) is an original determination by the
court that the language used is ambiguous.
2. Paragraph (a) makes admissible evidence of course of
dealing, usage of trade and course of performance to
explain or supplement the terms of any writing stating the
agreement of the parties in order that the true
understanding of the parties as to the agreement may be
reached. Such writings are to be read on the assumption
that the course of prior dealings between the parties and
the usages of trade were taken for granted when the
document was phrased. Unless carefully negated they have
become an element of the meaning of the words used.
Similarly, the course of actual performance by the parties is
considered the best indication of what they intended the
writing to mean.
3. Under paragraph (b) consistent additional terms, not
reduced to writing, may be proved unless the court finds
that the writing was intended by both parties as a complete
and exclusive statement of all the terms. If the additional
terms are such that, if agreed upon, they would certainly
have been included in the document in the view of the
court, then evidence of their alleged making must be kept
from the trier of fact.
The reference in § 2-202 to usage of trade, course
of dealing and course of performance evidence
requires a bit more explanation. In the following
enacted section of the Virginia Commercial Code,
which mirrors § 2-208 of the UCC, we see how
the statute establishes an interpretive hierarchy
among these forms of contextual evidence.

§ 8.1A-303 Course of performance, course of dealing,
and usage of trade.
(a) A "course of performance" is a sequence of conduct
between the parties to a particular transaction that exists if:
(1) the agreement of the parties with respect to the
transaction involves repeated occasions for
performance by a party; and
(2) the other party, with knowledge of the nature
of the performance and opportunity for objection
to it, accepts the performance or acquiesces in it
without objection.
(b) A "course of dealing" is a sequence of conduct
concerning previous transactions between the parties to a
particular transaction that is fairly to be regarded as
establishing a common basis of understanding for
interpreting their expressions and other conduct.
(c) A "usage of trade" is any practice or method of dealing
having such regularity of observance in a place, vocation,
or trade as to justify an expectation that it will be observed
with respect to the transaction in question. The existence
and scope of such a usage must be proved as facts. If it is
established that such a usage is embodied in a trade code
or similar record, the interpretation of the record is a
question of law.
(d) A course of performance or course of dealing between
the parties or usage of trade in the vocation or trade in
which they are engaged or of which they are or should be
aware is relevant in ascertaining the meaning of the parties'
agreement, may give particular meaning to specific terms
of the agreement, and may supplement or qualify the terms
of the agreement. A usage of trade applicable in the place
in which part of the performance under the agreement is
to occur may be so utilized as to that part of the
performance.
(e) Except as otherwise provided in subsection (f), the
express terms of an agreement and any applicable course
of performance, course of dealing, or usage of trade must

34

be construed whenever reasonable as consistent with each
other. If such a construction is unreasonable:
(1) express terms prevail over course of
performance, course of dealing, and usage of
trade;
(2) course of performance prevails over course of
dealing and usage of trade; and
(3) course of dealing prevails over usage of trade.
(f) Subject to § 2-209, a course of performance is relevant
to show a waiver or modification of any term inconsistent
with the course of performance.
(g) Evidence of a relevant usage of trade offered by one
party is not admissible unless that party has given the other
party notice that the court finds sufficient to prevent unfair
surprise to the other party.

2.1 Principal Case – Hunt Foods & Industries v. Doliner
The following case illustrates the (mis)application of § 2-202 to an alleged
oral agreement to limit the circumstances in which an option could be
exercised.

Hunt Foods & Industries v. Doliner
Supreme Court of New York, Appellate Division
26 A.D.2d 41, 270 N.Y.S.2d 937, aff’d, 272 N.Y.S.2d 686 (1966)
STEUER, J.
[1] In February, 1965 plaintiff corporation undertook negotiations to
acquire the assets of Eastern Can Company. The stock of the latter is
owned by defendant George M. Doliner and his family to the extent
of 73%. The balance is owned by independent interests. At a fairly
early stage of the negotiations agreement was reached as to the price
to be paid by plaintiff ($5,922,500 if in cash, or $5,730,000 in Hunt
stock), but several important items, including the form of the
acquisition, were not agreed upon. At this point it was found necessary
to recess the negotiations for several weeks. The Hunt negotiators
expressed concern over any adjournment and stated that they feared
that Doliner would use their offer as a basis for soliciting a higher bid
from a third party. To protect themselves they demanded an option to
purchase the Doliner stock. Such an option was prepared and signed

35

by George Doliner and the members of his family and at least one
other person associated with him who were stockholders. It provides
that Hunt has the option to buy all of the Doliner stock at $5.50 per
share. The option is to be exercised by giving notice on or before June
1, 1965, and if notice is not given the option is void. If given, Hunt is
to pay the price and the Doliners to deliver their stock within seven
days thereafter. The agreement calls for Hunt to pay $1,000 for the
option, which was paid. To this point there is substantial accord as to
what took place.
[2] Defendant claims that when his counsel called attention to the
fact that the option was unconditional in its terms, he obtained an
understanding that it was only to be used in the event that he solicited
an outside offer; and that plaintiff insisted that unless the option was
signed in unconditional form negotiations would terminate. Plaintiff
contends there was no condition. Concededly, on resumption of
negotiations the parties failed to reach agreement and the option was
exercised. Defendants declined the tender and refused to deliver the
stock.
[3] Plaintiff moved for summary judgment for specific performance.
We do not believe that summary judgment lies. Plaintiff's position is
that the condition claimed could not be proved under the parol
evidence rule and, eliminating that, there is no defense to the action.
[4] The parol evidence rule, at least as that term refers to contracts of
sale,xviii is now contained in section 2-202 of the Uniform Commercial
Code, which reads:
Terms with respect to which the confirmatory
memoranda of the parties agree or which are
otherwise set forth in a writing intended by the
parties as a final expression of their agreement with
respect to such terms as are included therein may
not be contradicted by evidence of any prior
agreement or of a contemporaneous oral agreement
but may be explained or supplemented …
(b) by evidence of consistent additional terms unless
the court finds the writing to have been intended
also as a complete and exclusive statement of the
terms of the agreement.
[5] The term (that the option was not to be exercised unless Doliner
sought outside bids), admittedly discussed but whose operative effect
is disputed, not being set out in the writing, is clearly "additional" to

36

what is in the writing. So the first question presented is whether that
term is "consistent" with the instrument. In a sense any oral provision
which would prevent the ripening of the obligations of a writing is
inconsistent with the writing. But that obviously is not the sense in
which the word is used (Hicks v. Bush, 10 N Y 2d 488, 491). To be
inconsistent the term must contradict or negate a term of the writing.
A term or condition which has a lesser effect is provable.
[6] The Official Comment prepared by the drafters of the code
contains this statement: "If the additional terms are such that, if agreed
upon, they would certainly have been included in the document in the
view of the court, then evidence of their alleged making must be kept
from the trier of fact." (McKinney's Uniform Commercial Code, Part
1, p. 158.)
[7] Special Term interpreted this language as not only calling for an
adjudication by the court in all instances where proof of an "additional
oral term" is offered, but making that determination exclusively the
function of the court. We believe the proffered evidence to be
inadmissible only where the writing contradicts the existence of the
claimed additional term (Meadow Brook Nat. Bank v. Bzura, 20 A D 2d
287, 290). The conversations in this case, some of which are not
disputed, and the expectation of all the parties for further negotiations,
suggest that the alleged oral condition precedent cannot be precluded
as a matter of law or as factually impossible. It is not sufficient that the
existence of the condition is implausible. It must be impossible (cf.
Millerton Agway Co-op. v. Briarcliff Farms, 17 N Y 2d 57, 63-64).
[8] The order should be reversed on the law and the motion for
summary judgment denied, with costs and disbursements to abide the
event.

2.1.1 Snyder v. Herbert Greenbaum & Associates
In Hunt Foods, the court construed the requirement in UCC § 2-202(b) that
any proffered additional terms must be “consistent” to preclude only proof
of terms that contradict or negate the written agreement. Other courts have
explicitly rejected this interpretation of the statute.
In Snyder v. Herbert Greenbaum & Associates, 38 Md. App. 144, 380 A.2d 618
(1977), a contractor agreed to supply and install carpet and padding for 228
garden apartments that a developer was about to build. The developer
chose to cancel the contract after discovering that it had ordered about ten
percent more carpet than would be needed for the apartments. When the
contractor sued for breach, the developer sought to introduce evidence that

37

five prior contracts between the parties had been rescinded by mutual
agreement. According to the developer, this evidence established a course
of dealing or oral agreement giving either party a unilateral right to modify
or cancel any contract between them.
The court of appeals upheld the trial court’s decision to reject the
developer’s argument and award damages to the contractor. The court
noted that a course of dealing can be used to give meaning to the terms of a
written contract, but the purported cancellation privilege was an additional
term that should be analyzed under UCC § 2-202(b). Applying the test of
Comment 3, the court held that such a term “would certainly have been
included” in the writing and thus the developer should be barred from
relying on that evidence. Finally the court expressed its disagreement with
the analysis of consistency in Hunt Foods:
At any rate, for much the same reason, we hold that
the additional terms offered by appellants are
inconsistent with the contract itself. In so doing we
reject the narrow view of inconsistency espoused in
Hunt Foods v. Doliner, 26 A.D.2d 41, 270 N.Y.S.2d
937 (1966), and Schiavone and Sons v. Securalloy
Co., 312 F. Supp. 801 (D. Conn. 1970). Those cases
hold that to be inconsistent the “additional terms”
must negate or contradict express terms of the
agreement.
This interpretation of “inconsistent” is itself
inconsistent with a reading of the whole of § 2-202.
Direct contradiction of express terms is forbidden in
the initial paragraph of § 2-202. The Hunt Foods
interpretation renders that passage a nullity, a result
which is to be avoided. Gillespie v. R & J Constr.
Co., 275 Md. 454 (1975).
Rather we believe “inconsistency” as used in § 2202(b) means the absence of reasonable harmony in
terms of the language and respective obligations of
the parties. § 1-205(4); see Southern Concrete
Services v. Mableton Contractors, 407 F. Supp. 581
(N.D. Ga. 1975). In terms of the obligations of the
appellee, which required appellee to make extensive
preparations in order to perform [such as purchasing
substantial quantities of materials in anticipation of
the project], unqualified unilateral cancellation by
appellants is not reasonably harmonious. Therefore,

38

evidence of the additional terms was properly
excluded by the trial judge, and we find no error.

Id. at 152.
2.1.2 Discussion of Hunt Foods v. Doliner
What is the court’s holding and reasoning concerning the alleged agreement
to limit the circumstances in which Hunt Foods would be entitled to
exercise its option to purchase the Eastern Can stock?
Do you agree with the court’s interpretation of § 2-202?
Is there any reason to worry that the court’s approach might defeat the
purpose for which the parties executed the option?
How would the approach taken in Snyder apply to the facts of Hunt Foods?

3 Interpretation
Although we have focused on the rules that determine which terms become
part of a contract, there is also an analogous group of doctrines governing
the interpretation of those terms. These interpretive rules confront the
same tension that exists between formal textualist and permissive
contextualist approaches to parol evidence.
On the side of formalism, we find the so-called “plain meaning” school of
interpretation. Loosely speaking, judges committed to this approach ask
first whether the terms of the written contract are ambiguous and only
permit parties to introduce extrinsic evidence if the language in question
appears reasonably susceptible to alternative interpretations. Adherents to
the formalist school view the ordinary dictionary definition of express
contract terms as an important constraint on the range of potential
interpretations. They are likely to be skeptical about a party’s self-serving
attempts to evade the conventional meaning of a word by alleging
idiosyncratic exceptions or variant meanings.
The currently ascendant contextualist approach to interpretation focuses
instead on a (possibly quixotic) quest to discover the true meaning that the
parties have attached to the relevant terms. Courts committed to this
interpretive perspective are inclined to consider any contextual evidence
that might plausibly reveal something about the parties’ intentions. The
Uniform Commercial Code § 2-202(a) embodies this permissive evidentiary
standard by allowing a course of dealing, a usage of trade, or a course of
performance to “explain” the meaning of any contract term.

VII. Remedies for Breach
If the parties have formed an enforceable contract and no grounds exist to
excuse performance, then a promisor who fails to perform breaches a
contractual obligation. Recall that Restatement (Second) § 1 defined a
contract as “a promise or a set of promises for the breach of which the law
gives a remedy….” We turn our attention now to learning something about
what “remedy” the law gives for breach of contract. In Lucy v. Zehmer, the
court ordered the Zehmers to perform their promise to convey the
Ferguson farm to Lucy in exchange for $50,000. As we will see, this remedy
of “specific performance” is available most often in contracts for the sale of
real estate or other unique goods (such as antiques and artwork), but it is
not the norm and requires special justification. Courts instead prefer the
remedy of money damages for breach.
The cases that follow thus begin with an introduction to the law of
damages. We investigate several possible policy justifications for protecting
a promisee’s “expectation interest” in the event of breach. Next, we
examine the doctrinal requirements for awarding specific performance and
consider the argument of some academics that specific performance should
perhaps be the rule rather than the exception. Turning our attention to
limitations on damages, we study the venerable foreseeability doctrine, learn
how the certainty limitation affects recovery of lost profits from a new
business, and discover why avoidability/mitigation doctrine may confront a
promisee with difficult choices. We also ask whether awarding the cost of
performance or the value of performance best compensates for the loss
that a promisee suffers from contract breach. We conclude with the
surprisingly stringent rules restricting the use of liquidated damages.

1 Monetary Damages
1.1 Introduction
The usual remedy for contract breach is “expectation” damages. The
following sections of the Restatement (Second) describe the damage
remedy and its principal limitations:
§ 344. Purposes of Remedies
Judicial remedies under the rules stated in this Restatement
serve to protect one or more of the following interests of a
promisee:

40

(a) his "expectation interest," which is his interest
in having the benefit of his bargain by being put in
as good a position as he would have been in had
the contract been performed,
(b) his "reliance interest," which is his interest in
being reimbursed for loss caused by reliance on
the contract by being put in as good a position as
he would have been in had the contract not been
made, or
(c) his "restitution interest," which is his interest in
having restored to him any benefit that he has
conferred on the other party.
§ 346. Availability of Damages
(1) The injured party has a right to damages for any breach
by a party against whom the contract is enforceable unless
the claim for damages has been suspended or discharged.
(2) If the breach caused no loss or if the amount of the
loss is not proved under the rules stated in this Chapter, a
small sum fixed without regard to the amount of the loss
will be awarded as nominal damages.
§ 347. Measure of Damages in General
Subject to the limitations stated in §§ 350-53, the injured
party has a right to damages based on his expectation
interest as measured by
(a) the loss in the value to him of the other party’s
performance caused by its failure or deficiency,
plus
(b) any other loss, including incidental or
consequential loss, caused by the breach, less
(c) any cost or other loss that he has avoided by
not having to perform.

41

§ 350. Avoidability as a Limitation on Damages
(1) Except as stated in Subsection (2), damages are not
recoverable for loss that the injured party could have
avoided without undue risk, burden or humiliation.
(2) The injured party is not precluded from recovery by the
rule stated in Subsection (1) to the extent that he has made
reasonable but unsuccessful efforts to avoid loss.
§ 351. Unforeseeability and Related Limitations on
Damages
(1) Damages are not recoverable for loss that the party in
breach did not have reason to foresee as a probable result
of the breach when the contract was made.
(2) Loss may be foreseeable as a probable result of a
breach because it follows from the breach
(a) in the ordinary course of events, or
(b) as a result of special circumstances, beyond the
ordinary course of events, that the party in breach
had reason to know.
(3) A court may limit damages for foreseeable loss by
excluding recovery for loss of profits, by allowing recovery
only for loss incurred in reliance, or otherwise if it
concludes that in the circumstances justice so requires in
order to avoid disproportionate compensation.
§ 352. Uncertainty as a Limitation on Damages
Damages are not recoverable for loss beyond an amount
that the evidence permits to be established with reasonable
certainty.
§ 353. Loss Due to Emotional Disturbance
Recovery for emotional disturbance will be excluded
unless the breach also caused bodily harm or the contract
or the breach is of such a kind that serious emotional
disturbance is a particularly likely result.

42

In contracts for the sale of goods, the Uniform Commercial Code supplies
additional guidance about remedies. The provisions for buyer’s remedies
include the following sections:
§ 2-711. Buyer’s Remedies in General
(1) Where the seller fails to make delivery or repudiates or
the buyer rightfully rejects or justifiably revokes acceptance
then with respect to any goods involved, and with respect
to the whole if the breach goes to the whole contract
(Section 2-612), the buyer may cancel and whether or not
he has done so may in addition to recovering so much of
the price as has been paid
(a) “cover” and have damages under the next
section as to all the goods affected whether or not
they have been identified to the contract; or
(b) recover damages for non-delivery as provided
in this Article (Section 2-713).
(2) Where the seller fails to deliver or repudiates the buyer
may also
(a) if the goods have been identified recover them
as provided in this Article (Section 2-502); or
(b) in a proper case obtain specific performance or
replevy the goods as provided in this Article
(Section 2-716).
§ 2-712. “Cover”; Buyer’s Procurement of Substitute
Goods
(1) After a breach within the preceding section the buyer
may “cover” by making in good faith and without
unreasonable delay any reasonable purchase of or contract
to purchase goods in substitution for those due from the
seller.
(2) The buyer may recover from the seller as damages the
difference between the cost of cover and the contract price
together with any incidental or consequential damages as

43

hereinafter defined (Section 2-715), but less expenses
saved in consequence of the seller’s breach.
(3) Failure of the buyer to effect cover within this section
does not bar him from any other remedy.
§ 2-713. Buyer’s Damages for Non-Delivery or
Repudiation
(1) Subject to the provisions of this Article with respect to
proof of market price (Section 2-723), the measure of
damages for non-delivery or repudiation by the seller is the
difference between the market price at the time when the
buyer learned of the breach and the contract price together
with any incidental and consequential damages provided in
this Article (Section 2-715), but less expenses saved in
consequence of the seller’s breach.
(2) Market price is to be determined as of the place for
tender or, in cases of rejection after arrival or revocation of
acceptance, as of the place of arrival.
§ 2-715. Buyer’s Incidental and Consequential
Damages
(1) Incidental damages resulting from the seller’s breach
include expenses reasonably incurred in inspection, receipt,
transportation and care and custody of goods rightfully
rejected, any commercially reasonable charges, expenses or
commissions in connection with effecting cover and any
other reasonable expense incident to the delay or other
breach.
(2) Consequential damages resulting from the seller’s
breach include
(a) any loss resulting from general or particular
requirements and needs of which the seller at the
time of contracting had reason to know and which
could not reasonably be prevented by cover or
otherwise; and
(b) injury to person or property proximately
resulting from any breach of warranty.

1.1.1 Globe Refining Co. v. Landa Cotton Oil Co.
In Globe Refining Co. v. Landa Cotton Oil Co., 190 U.S. 540 (1903), a Texas
supplier made a contract to deliver ten railroad tanker cars of prime crude
oil “f.o.b. buyers’ tanks at [sellers’] mill.” When the sellers repudiated the
deal shortly before the time for delivery, the Kentucky buyers sued, seeking
compensation for the cost of sending their tanker cars to Texas. They also
sought to recover for the loss of use of the cars and for damages suffered
when the lack of oil forced the buyers to breach contracts with their own
customers. Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes affirmed the trial court’s ruling
that the proper damage measure in this case was “the difference between
the contract price of the oil and the price at the time of the breach.” He
explained the underlying principles of contract damages in the following
terms:
When a man commits a tort, he incurs, by force of
the law, a liability to damages, measured by certain
rules. When a man makes a contract, he incurs, by
force of the law, a liability to damages, unless a
certain promised event comes to pass. But, unlike
the case of torts, as the contract is by mutual
consent, the parties themselves, expressly or by
implication, fix the rule by which the damages are to
be measured. The old law seems to have regarded it
as technically in the election of the promisor to
perform or to pay damages. Bromage v. Genning, 1
Rolle, 368; Hulbert v. Hart, 1 Vern. 133. It is true
that, as people when contracting contemplate
performance, not breach, they commonly say little or
nothing as to what shall happen in the latter event,
and the common rules have been worked out by
common sense, which has established what the
parties probably would have said if they had spoken
about the matter. But a man never can be absolutely
certain of performing any contract when the time of
performance arrives, and, in many cases, he
obviously is taking the risk of an event which is
wholly, or to an appreciable extent, beyond his
control. The extent of liability in such cases is likely
to be within his contemplation, and, whether it is or
not, should be worked out on terms which it fairly
may be presumed he would have assented to if they
had been presented to his mind. For instance, in the
present case, the defendant's mill and all its oil might
have been burned before the time came for delivery.

45

Such a misfortune would not have been an excuse,
although probably it would have prevented
performance of the contract. If a contract is broken,
the measure of damages generally is the same,
whatever the cause of the breach. We have to
consider, therefore, what the plaintiff would have
been entitled to recover in that case, and that
depends on what liability the defendant fairly may be
supposed to have assumed consciously, or to have
warranted the plaintiff reasonably to suppose that it
assumed, when the contract was made.
…
It may be said with safety that mere notice to a seller
of some interest or probable action of the buyer is
not enough necessarily and as a matter of law to
charge the seller with special damage on that account
if he fails to deliver the goods. With that established,
we recur to the allegations. With regard to the first, it
is obvious that the plaintiff was free to bring its
tanks from where it liked -- a thousand miles away or
an adjoining yard -- so far as the contract was
concerned. The allegation hardly amounts to saying
that the defendant had notice that the plaintiff was
likely to send its cars from a distance. It is not
alleged that the defendant had notice that the
plaintiff had to bind itself to pay nine hundred
dollars, at the time when the contract was made, and
it nowhere is alleged that the defendant assumed any
liability in respect of this uncertain element of
charge. The same observations may be made with
regard to the claim for loss of use of the tanks and to
the final allegations as to sending the tanks from
distant points. It is true that this last was alleged to
have been in contemplation of the contract, if we
give the plaintiff the benefit of the doubt in
construing a somewhat confused sentence. But,
having the contract before us, we can see that this
ambiguous expression cannot be taken to mean
more than notice, and notice of a fact which would
depend upon the accidents of the future.
It is to be said further with regard to the foregoing
items that they were the expenses which the plaintiff
was willing to incur for performance. If it had
received the oil, these were deductions from any
profit which the plaintiff would have made. But if it

46

gets the difference between the contract price and
the market price, it gets what represents the value of
the oil in its hands, and to allow these items in
addition would be making the defendant pay twice
for the same thing.

1.1.2 Hypo Based on Globe Refining
As an exercise to test your understanding of the basic rules of contract
damages, consider the following hypothetical, which is based loosely on the
facts of Globe Refining:
Plaintiff contracts to buy 10 tanker trucks full of fuel
oil at $10,000 per truckload. The defendant seller is
in Louisville, Kentucky, and plaintiff buyer is in New
Braunfels, Texas. The buyer sends a $4,000 deposit
check. On the agreed delivery date, the buyer sends
ten empty tank trucks from Texas to Louisville at a
total cost of $1,600. But the seller has already sold
the oil to a New York buyer for $14,000 per
truckload.
Oil is available in Indianapolis for $12,000 per
truckload but it is not available in Louisville. Plaintiff
buyer could send trucks to Indianapolis for a total
cost of $700. But instead he sends them back to
Texas empty. As a result, plaintiff breaches several
contracts with customers in Texas. These breaches
cost $54,000. Some customers announce that they
will no longer do business with plaintiff. Finally, the
plaintiff suffers a serious nervous breakdown and
pays $1,000 for treatment. Plaintiff sues in Texas
state court. His attorney’s fees are $20,000. It takes
two years for the case to come to trial.

For each of the buyer's possible losses, determine whether or not it would
be compensable under an expectation measure of damages.
1.1.3 Discussion of Hypo Based on Globe Refining
Many, perhaps most, contracts omit any mention of remedies and do not
provide expressly for a measure of damages. In view of this frequent
omission, what does Justice Holmes suggest that courts should do?
How do the provisions of the Restatement and the UCC apply to the
hypothetical? To what would the buyer ordinarily be entitled?
Is there any need to award the buyer specific performance of this promise?

47

1.2 Principal Case – Freund v. Washington Square Press
As you read the following case, try to identify the losses that could form
part of Freund’s expectation interest. Think carefully about why he ends up
with just six cents and consider whether you find the court’s reasoning
convincing.

Freund v. Washington Square Press, Inc.
Court of Appeals of New York
314 N.E.2d 419, 357 N.Y.S.2d 857 (1974)
RABIN, JUDGE.
[1] In this action for breach of a publishing contract, we must decide
what damages are recoverable for defendant's failure to publish
plaintiff's manuscript. In 1965, plaintiff, an author and a college
teacher, and defendant, Washington Square Press, Inc., entered into a
written agreement which, in relevant part, provided as follows.
Plaintiff (“author”) granted defendant (“publisher”) exclusive rights to
publish and sell in book form plaintiff's work on modern drama.
Upon plaintiff's delivery of the manuscript, defendant agreed to
complete payment of a nonreturnable $2,000 “advance.” Thereafter, if
defendant deemed the manuscript not “suitable for publication,” it
had the right to terminate the agreement by written notice within 60
days of delivery. Unless so terminated, defendant agreed to publish the
work in hardbound edition within 18 months and afterwards in
paperbound edition. The contract further provided that defendant
would pay royalties to plaintiff, based upon specified percentages of
sales. (For example, plaintiff was to receive 10% of the retail price of
the first 10,000 copies sold in the continental United States.) If
defendant failed to publish within 18 months, the contract provided
that “this agreement shall terminate and the rights herein granted to
the Publisher shall revert to the Author. In such event all payments
therefore made to the Author shall belong to the Author without
prejudice to any other remedies which the Author may have.” The
contract also provided that controversies were to be determined
pursuant to the New York simplified procedure for court
determination of disputes (CPLR 3031-3037, Consol. Laws, c. 8).
[2] Plaintiff performed by delivering his manuscript to defendant and
was paid his $2,000 advance. Defendant thereafter merged with
another publisher and ceased publishing in hardbound. Although
defendant did not exercise its 60-day right to terminate, it has refused
to publish the manuscript in any form.

48

[3] Plaintiff commenced the instant action pursuant to the simplified
procedure practice and initially sought specific performance of the
contract. The Trial Term Justice denied specific performance but,
finding a valid contract and a breach by defendant, set the matter
down for trial on the issue of monetary damages, if any, sustained by
the plaintiff. At trial, plaintiff sought to prove: (1) delay of his
academic promotion; (2) loss of royalties which would have been
earned; and (3) the cost of publication if plaintiff had made his own
arrangements to publish. The trial court found that plaintiff had been
promoted despite defendant's failure to publish, and that there was no
evidence that the breach had caused any delay. Recovery of lost
royalties was denied without discussion. The court found, however,
that the loss of hardcover publication to plaintiff was the natural and
probable consequence of the breach and, based upon expert
testimony, awarded $10,000 to cover this cost. It denied recovery of
the expenses of paperbound publication on the ground that plaintiff's
proof was conjectural.
[4] The Appellate Division, (3 to 2) affirmed, finding that the cost of
publication was the proper measure of damages. In support of its
conclusion, the majority analogized to the construction contract
situation where the cost of completion may be the proper measure of
damages for a builder's failure to complete a house or for use of
wrong materials. The dissent concluded that the cost of publication is
not an appropriate measure of damages and consequently, that
plaintiff may recover nominal damages only.xix We agree with the
dissent. In so concluding, we look to the basic purpose of damage
recovery and the nature and effect of the parties' contract.
[5] It is axiomatic that, except where punitive damages are allowable,
the law awards damages for breach of contract to compensate for
injury caused by the breach—injury which was foreseeable, i.e.,
reasonably within the contemplation of the parties, at the time the
contract was entered into. (Swain v. Schieffelin, 134 N.Y. 471, 473, 31
N.E. 1025, 1026.) Money damages are substitutional relief designed in
theory “to put the injured party in as good a position as he would have
been put by full performance of the contract, at the least cost to the
defendant and without charging him with harms that he had no
sufficient reason to foresee when he made the contract.” (5 CORBIN,
CONTRACTS, § 1002, pp. 31-32; 11 WILLISTON, CONTRACTS (3d ed.),
§ 1338, p. 198.) In other words, so far as possible, the law attempts to
secure to the injured party the benefit of his bargain, subject to the
limitations that the injury—whether it be losses suffered or gains

49

prevented—was foreseeable, and that the amount of damages claimed
be measurable with a reasonable degree of certainty and, of course,
adequately proven. (See, generally, DOBBS, LAW OF REMEDIES, p. 148;
see, also, Farnsworth, Legal Remedies for Breach of Contract, 70 COLUM. L.
REV. 1145, 1159 [(1970)].) But it is equally fundamental that the
injured party should not recover more from the breach than he would
have gained had the contract been fully performed. (Baker v. Drake, 53
N.Y. 211, 217; see, generally, DOBBS, LAW OF REMEDIES, p. 810.)
[6] Measurement of damages in this case according to the cost of
publication to the plaintiff would confer greater advantage than
performance of the contract would have entailed to plaintiff and
would place him in a far better position than he would have occupied
had the defendant fully performed. Such measurement bears no
relation to compensation for plaintiff's actual loss or anticipated profit.
Far beyond compensating plaintiff for the interests he had in the
defendant's performance of the contract—whether restitution, reliance
or expectation (see Fuller & Perdue, Reliance Interest in Contract Damages,
46 YALE L.J. 52, 53-56 [(1936)]) an award of the cost of publication
would enrich plaintiff at defendant's expense.
[7] Pursuant to the contract, plaintiff delivered his manuscript to the
defendant. In doing so, he conferred a value on the defendant which,
upon defendant's breach, was required to be restored to him. Special
Term, in addition to ordering a trial on the issue of damages, ordered
defendant to return the manuscript to plaintiff and plaintiff's
restitution interest in the contract was thereby protected. (Cf. 5
CORBIN, CONTRACTS, § 996, p. 15.)
[8] At the trial on the issue of damages, plaintiff alleged no reliance
losses suffered in performing the contract or in making necessary
preparations to perform. Had such losses, if foreseeable and
ascertainable, been incurred, plaintiff would have been entitled to
compensation for them. (Cf. Bernstein v. Meech, 130 N.Y. 354, 359, 29
N.E. 255, 257.)
[9] As for plaintiff's expectation interest in the contract, it was
basically two-fold—the “advance” and the royalties. (To be sure,
plaintiff may have expected to enjoy whatever notoriety, prestige or
other benefits that might have attended publication, but even if these
expectations were compensable, plaintiff did not attempt at trial to
place a monetary value on them.) There is no dispute that plaintiff's
expectancy in the “advance” was fulfilled—he has received his $2,000.
His expectancy interest in the royalities—the profit he stood to gain

50

from sale of the published book—while theoretically compensable,
was speculative. Although this work is not plaintiff's first, at trial he
provided no stable foundation for a reasonable estimate of royalties he
would have earned had defendant not breached its promise to publish.
In these circumstances, his claim for royalties falls for uncertainty. (Cf.
Broadway Photoplay Co. v. World Film Corp., 225 N.Y. 104, 121 N.E. 756;
Hewlett v. Caplin, 275 App. Div. 797, 88 N.Y.S.2d 428.)
[10] Since the damages which would have compensated plaintiff for
anticipated royalties were not proved with the required certainty, we
agree with the dissent in the Appellate Division that nominal damages
alone are recoverable. (Cf. Manhattan Sav. Inst. v. Gottfried Baking Co.,
286 N.Y. 398, 36 N.E.2d 637.) Though these are damages in name
only and not at all compensatory, they are nevertheless awarded as a
formal vindication of plaintiff's legal right to compensation which has
not been given a sufficiently certain monetary valuation. (Cf. Baker v.
Hart, 123 N.Y. 470, 474, 25 N.E. 948, 949; see, generally, DOBBS, LAW
OF REMEDIES, p. 191; 11 WILLISTON, CONTRACTS (3d ed.), § 1339A,
pp. 206-208.)
[11] In our view, the analogy by the majority in the Appellate Division
to the construction contract situation was inapposite. In the typical
construction contract, the owner agrees to pay money or other
consideration to a builder and expects, under the contract, to receive a
completed building in return. The value of the promised performance
to the owner is the properly constructed building. In this case, unlike
the typical construction contract, the value to plaintiff of the promised
performance—publication—was a percentage of sales of the books
published and not the books themselves. Had the plaintiff contracted
for the printing, binding and delivery of a number of hardbound
copies of his manuscript, to be sold or disposed of as he wished, then
perhaps the construction analogy, and measurement of damages by
the cost of replacement or completion, would have some application.
[12] Here, however, the specific value to plaintiff of the promised
publication was the royalties he stood to receive from defendant's sales
of the published book. Essentially, publication represented what it
would have cost the defendant to confer that value upon the plaintiff,
and, by its breach, defendant saved that cost. The error by the courts
below was in measuring damages not by the value to plaintiff of the
promised performance but by the cost of that performance to
defendant. Damages are not measured, however, by what the
defaulting party saved by the breach, but by the natural and probable
consequences of the breach to the plaintiff. In this case, the

51

consequence to plaintiff of defendant's failure to publish is that he is
prevented from realizing the gains promised by the contract—the
royalties. But, as we have stated, the amount of royalties plaintiff
would have realized was not ascertained with adequate certainty and,
as a consequence, plaintiff may recover nominal damages only.
[13] Accordingly, the order of the Appellate Division should be
modified to the extent of reducing the damage award of $10,000 for
the cost of publication to six cents, but with costs and disbursements
to the plaintiff.

1.2.1 Discussion of Freund v. Washington Square Press
So what exactly are Freund’s restitution, reliance and expectation interests
in this contract?
What evidence could he have offered in an attempt to prove losses in each
of these categories?
Why does Freund receive no recovery of royalties?
Does this rule strike you as fair?

1.3 The “Coase Theorem” and Efficient Breach
1.3.1 Efficient Breach
Why do you suppose that courts choose expectation damages rather than a
reliance measure, or punitive damages, or even the death penalty for
breach? Scholars have offered many arguments to defend the expectation
measure. Judge, formerly professor, Richard Posner has written:
It makes a difference in deciding which remedy to
grant whether the breach was opportunistic. If a
promisor breaks his promise merely to take
advantage of the vulnerability of the promisee in a
setting (the normal contract setting) when
performance is sequential rather than simultaneous,
we might as well throw the book at the promisor….
Most breaches of contract, however, are not
opportunistic. Many are involuntary; performance is
impossible at a reasonable cost. Others are voluntary
but (as we are about to see) efficient—which from
an economic standpoint is the same case as that of
an involuntary breach. These observations both
explain the centrality of remedies to the law of
contracts (can you see why?) and give point to
Holmes’s dictum that it is not the policy of the law

52

to compel adherence to contracts but only to require
each party to choose between performing in
accordance with the contract and compensating the
other party for any injury resulting from a failure to
perform.xx
This dictum, though over broad, contains an
important economic insight. In many cases it is
uneconomical to induce completion of performance
of a contract after it has been broken. I agree to
purchase 100,000 widgets custom-ground for use as
components in a machine that I manufacture. After I
have taken delivery of 10,000, the market for my
machine collapses. I promptly notify my supplier
that I am terminating the contract, and admit that
my termination is a breach. When notified of the
termination he has not begun the custom grinding of
the other 90,000 widgets, but he informs me that he
intends to complete his performance under the
contract and bill me accordingly. The customground widgets have no operating use other than in
my machine, and a negligible scrap value. To give the
supplier a remedy that induced him to complete the
contract after the breach would waste resources. The
law is alert to this danger and, under the doctrine of
mitigation of damages, would not give the supplier
damages for any costs he incurred in continuing
production after notice of termination.
In [this example] the breach was committed only to
avert a larger loss, but in some cases a party is
tempted to break his contract simply because his
profit from breach would exceed his profit from
completion of the contract. If it would also exceed
the expected profit of the other party from
completion of the contract, and if damages are
limited to the loss of that profit, there will be an
incentive to commit a breach. But there should be.
Suppose I sign a contract to deliver 100,000 customground widgets at 10 cents apiece to A for use in this
boiler factory. After I have delivered 10,000, B
comes to me, explains that he desperately needs
25,000 custom-ground widgets at once since
otherwise he will be forced to close his pianola
factory at great cost, and offers me 15 cents apiece
for them. I sell him the widgets and as a result do
not complete timely delivery to A, causing him to

53

lose $1,000 in profits. Having obtained an additional
profit of $1,250 on the sale to B, I am better off
even after reimbursing A for his loss, and B is also
better off. The breach is Pareto superior. True, if I
had refused to sell to B, he could have gone to A
and negotiated an assignment to him of part of A’s
contract with me. But this would have introduced an
additional step, with additional transaction costs—
and high ones, because it would be a bilateralmonopoly negotiation. On the other hand, litigation
costs would be reduced.

Richard A. Posner, Economic Analysis of Law (2007)
Posner’s argument presents one version of the “theory of efficient breach.”
We will discuss his analysis in detail, but you may wish to consider what
assumptions about the parties are necessary to ensure that the breach in
Posner’s second example will be “efficient.” Also give some thought to how
parties might react if the damage rule instead required B to compensate A
by paying him twice (or ten times or one-half) of his loss.
1.3.2 Discussion of Efficient Breach
In order to better understand the theory of efficient breach, it is helpful to
work through a modified version of Posner's second example.
Imagine that a seller (S) signs a contract with a buyer (B) to deliver 10,000
widgets for $1/each (to be used in boiler factory). Before S makes any
deliveries, a foreign consortium (FC) offers to pay $2/each for as many
widgets as S can produce and deliver within one month. S directs all of its
production for 30 days to serving FC. Suppose that S can produce 7,000
widgets in that time. The delay in delivery will cause B to lose $1,000 in
profits (e.g., B can’t run boiler production at full capacity).
First, try to account for the potential gains and losses in this situation. Then
ask yourself what Posner argues that S should do and why?
Now consider whether there are any opportunities for the parties to
renegotiate their bargain once a new opportunity arises? How would you
expect those negotiations to proceed?
If the parties expect that the default damage rule (e.g., one-half or twentytimes compensatory damages) will frustrate their objectives, what would
you advise them to do before signing a contract?

54

1.3.3 Hypo of Dan and Lynn on the River
(inspired by a hypo from an early edition of the Scott & Leslie, Contract
Law & Theory casebook)
Dan sits on his porch overlooking a scenic river. Lynn runs a factory
upstream from Dan's house.
Lynn wants to dump waste in the river that is non-toxic but causes a
terrible smell that dissipates only after passing Dan’s house.
(1) Suppose first that the law gives Dan the legal right to prevent the
dumping. (Perhaps it calls the dumping a nuisance.)
(a) If Lynn values dumping more than Dan values pleasant smelling air,
what will the parties do?
(b) If Dan values sweet air more than Lynn values dumping, what will
happen now?
(2) Next, change the assignment of legal rights so that Lynn has the right to
dump.
(a) If Lynn values dumping more than Dan values pleasant smelling air,
what will happen?
(b) If Dan values sweet air more than Lynn values dumping, what will
the parties do now?
How does the assignment of the legal right to dump (or prevent dumping)
affect the distribution of wealth between Dan and Lynn?
1.3.4 Problem: Signing Bonus for First-Year Associates
Suppose that newly enacted legislation declares the following:
All legal employers must pay starting first-year
associates a signing bonus of $100,000 unless
otherwise specified in a written contract of
employment.

What do you expect to happen after the effective date of the legislation?
Does the enactment of this legislation make first-year associates better off?
Now suppose that the legislation mandates payment of the bonus and
prohibits parties from contracting around the bonus requirement. What do
you expect to happen in the market for the services of first-year associates?
Can you imagine any strategies firms might adopt to diminish the effect of
the new law on their labor costs?

55

2 Specific Performance
As we saw in Lucy v. Zehmer, one way to ensure that the promisee (Lucy)
receives precisely what he wanted from the contract is to order the
promisors (the Zehmers) to perform by conveying title to the Ferguson
farm. Although courts routinely order “specific performance” of real estate
sales contracts, they also grant specific performance in appropriate
circumstances to remedy the breach of a contract for the sale of goods.
Let’s begin by reading the relevant section of the UCC.
§ 2-716. Buyer’s Right to Specific Performance or Replevin
(1) Specific performance may be decreed where the goods are unique or in
other proper circumstances.
(2) The decree for specific performance may include such terms and
conditions as to payment of the price, damages, or other relief as the court
may deem just.
Official Comment
1. The present section continues in general prior policy as to specific
performance and injunction against breach. However, without intending to
impair in any way the exercise of the court’s sound discretion in the
matter, this Article seeks to further a more liberal attitude than some
courts have shown in connection with the specific performance of
contracts of sale.
2. In view of this Article’s emphasis on the commercial feasibility of
replacement, a new concept of what are “unique” goods is introduced
under this section. Specific performance is no longer limited to goods
which are already specific or ascertained at the time of contracting. The
test of uniqueness under this section must be made in terms of the total
situation which characterizes the contract. Output and requirements
contracts involving a particular or peculiarly available source or market
present today the typical specific performance situation, as contrasted with
contracts for sale of heirlooms or priceless works of art which were usually
involved in the older cases. However, uniqueness is not the sole basis of
the remedy under this section for the relief may also be granted “in other
proper circumstances” and inability to cover is strong evidence of “other
proper circumstances”.

56

Why do you suppose that specific performance is only a buyer’s remedy
under the Uniform Commercial Code? Is there any reason that the seller
should not be able to force the buyer to specifically perform the contract?

2.1 Principal Case – Klein v. Pepsico
You may not have previously thought of jet airplanes as falling within the
definition of “goods” but the following case applies the UCC rules for
specific performance to a contract for the sale of a Gulfstream G-II
corporate jet. Try to identify precisely what it is about the circumstances
surrounding this transaction that made specific performance an
inappropriate remedy for PepsiCo’s breach.

Klein v. Pepsico, Inc.
United States Court of Appeals, Fourth Circuit
845 F.2d 76 (1988)
ERVIN, CIRCUIT JUDGE:
[1] This case turns on whether a contract was formed between
Universal Jet Sales, Inc. (“UJS”) and PepsiCo, Inc., (“PepsiCo”) for
the sale of a Gulfstream G-II corporate jet to UJS for resale to one
Eugene V. Klein. If a contract was formed, the question remains
whether the district court acted within his discretion by ordering
specific performance of the contract. We believe the district court
properly found that a contract was formed; however, we conclude that
the remedy of specific performance is inappropriate. Accordingly, we
affirm in part, reverse and remand in part.
I.
[2] In March 1986, Klein began looking for a used corporate jet;
specifically, he wanted a G-II. He contacted Patrick Janas, President of
UJS, who provided information to Klein about several aircraft
including the PepsiCo aircraft. Klein's pilot and mechanic, Mr.
Sherman and Mr. Quaid, inspected the PepsiCo jet in New York. Mr.
James Welsch served as the jet broker for PepsiCo.
[3] Klein asked that the jet be flown to Arkansas for his personal
inspection. On March 29, 1986, he inspected the jet. Mr. Rashid,
PepsiCo Vice President for Asset Management and Corporate Service,
accompanied the jet to Arkansas and met Mr. Klein. Janas also went to
Arkansas. Klein gave Janas $200,000 as a deposit on the jet, and told
Janas to offer $4.4 million for the aircraft.

57

[4] On March 31, 1986, Janas telexed the $4.4 million offer to
Welsch. The telex said the offer was subject to a factory inspection
satisfactory to the purchaser, and a definitive contract. On April 1,
PepsiCo counteroffered with a $4.7 million asking price. After some
dickering, Welsch offered the jet for $4.6 million. Janas accepted the
offer by telex on April 3. Janas then planned to sell the aircraft to
Klein for $4.75 million. In Finding of Fact number 18, JA 85, Judge
Williams declared that a contract had been formed at this point.
[5] Judge Williams ruled that a contract was evidenced by Janas'
confirming telex which “accepted” PepsiCo's offer to sell the jet, and
noted that a $100,000 down payment would be wired. The telex also
asked for the proper name of the company selling the aircraft. See JA
86 Finding of Fact number 22.
[6] On April 3, Janas sent out copies of the Klein/UJS agreement and
the UJS-PepsiCo agreement to the respective parties. Janas also sent a
bill of sale to PepsiCo (to Rashid). PepsiCo sent the bill of sale to the
escrow agent handling the deal on April 8. Mr. Rochoff, PepsiCo's
corporate counsel, spoke with Janas about the standard contract sent
by Janas to PepsiCo. He noted only that the delivery date should be
changed.
[7] On Monday, April 7, the aircraft was flown to Savannah, Georgia
for the pre-purchase inspection. Quaid was present at the inspection
for Klein. Archie Walker, PepsiCo's chief of maintenance, was present
for the seller. Walker and Quaid discussed a list of repairs to be made
to the jet. Most of the problems were cured during the inspection.
However, one cosmetic problem was to be corrected in New York,
and there were cracks in the engine blades of the right engine.
[8] On April 8, a boroscopic examination conducted by Aviall
revealed eight to eleven cracks on the turbine blades. Walker told
Rashid that the cost of repairing the blades would be between $25,000
to $28,000. Judge Williams found in Finding of Fact numbers 34
through 37 that PepsiCo, through Walker and Rashid, agreed to pay
for the repair to the engine.
[9] On April 9, the plane was returned to New York. Rashid wanted
the plane grounded; however, it was sent to retrieve the stranded
PepsiCo Chairman of the Board from Dulles airport that same
evening. Donald Kendall, the Chairman, on April 10, called Rashid
and asked that the jet be withdrawn from the market. Rashid called
Welsch who effected the withdrawal. On the 11th Janas told Klein

58

that PepsiCo refused to tender the aircraft. The deal was supposed to
close on Friday, April 11.
[10] On April 14, Klein telexed UJS demanding delivery of the aircraft.
That same day, UJS telexed PepsiCo demanding delivery and
expressing satisfaction with the pre-purchase inspection. On April 15,
PepsiCo responded with a telex to UJS saying that it refused to
negotiate further because discussions had not reached the point of
agreement; in particular, Klein was not prepared to go forward with
the deal.
[11] Judge Williams, in a lengthy opinion, made numerous findings of
fact. Such findings are reviewed only for clear error. Davis v. Food Lion,
792 F.2d 1274, 1277 (4th Cir.1986). If the findings are based on
determinations of witness credibility, are consistent, and are
corroborated by extrinsic evidence, they are virtually never clearly
erroneous. Brown v. Baltimore and Ohio R. Co., 805 F.2d 1133, 1140 (4th
Cir.1986).
[12] Judge Williams' decision to grant specific performance is reviewed
only for an abuse of discretion. Haythe v. May, 223 Va. 359, 288 S.E.2d
487 (1982); Horner v. Bourland, 724 F.2d 1142, 1144-45 (5th Cir.1984).
Keeping these standards in mind, we now turn to the first issue,
whether the district court clearly erred in finding that a contract arose
between PepsiCo and UJS.
II.
[13] PepsiCo argues forcefully that no contract was formed between it
and UJS. The soft drink dealer argues first that the parties did not
intend to be bound until a complete integration was written in final
form. Until that definitive written contract existed, PepsiCo maintains
that no contract existed. The company argues that the March 31 and
April 1 telexes explicitly stated that no contract would exist until a
written agreement was executed. Because no written agreement had
been executed (PepsiCo had not signed the sales agreement sent by
Janas to PepsiCo) the company argues that it had the right to
withdraw from the negotiations. PepsiCo cites Reprosystem, B.V. v.
SCM Corp., 727 F.2d 257, 262 (2d Cir.1984), cert. denied, 469 U.S. 828
(1984) and Skycom Corp. v. Telstar Corp., 813 F.2d 810, 815-16 (7th
Cir.1987) for the general proposition that either party can withdraw
from negotiations for any reason.
[14] Upon reviewing the facts, Judge Williams ruled that a contract
was formed between the parties. He explains:

59

A contract was formed between UJS and PepsiCo
for the sale of the GII aircraft, Serial No. 170, for
$4.6 million. The contract formation is based upon
(1) UJS's April 3rd confirming telex; (2) the conduct
of the parties, e.g., (a) PepsiCo's failure to
communicate any objection to the terms of the April
3rd telex confirming the agreement reached between
Welsch and Janas; (b) PepsiCo's directive to UJS to
wire transfer a One Hundred Thousand Dollar
($100,000.00) down payment, which money was
received by PepsiCo; (c) PepsiCo's communication
with UJS that the Sales Agreement, which served to
memorialize the contract, appeared “fine”;
(d) PepsiCo's execution of the Bill of Sale for the
aircraft and its sending of the Bill of Sale to the
escrow agent, as called for by Janas and in the Sales
Agreement; (e) PepsiCo's sending the aircraft to
Savannah, Georgia, for a prepurchase inspection as
called for in both the April 3rd confirming telex and
the Sales Agreement; and (e) admissions of PepsiCo.,
through Rashid, that UJS's offer to purchase the
airplane was accepted.
JA 103-04, Conclusion of Law # 6. Finally, Judge Williams expressly
held that the intent to memorialize the contract in writing was not
necessarily a condition to the existence of the contract itself. JA 104
(Conclusion of Law number 8).
[15] PepsiCo offers no reason as to why Judge Williams' findings on
this issue are clearly erroneous. They merely disagree with his
characterizations of the facts. This court may disagree with his
characterization too, but that does not amount to a firm and definite
conviction that a mistake has been committed. Anderson v. City of
Bessemer City, N.C., 470 U.S. 564 (1985).
[16] PepsiCo argues secondly, that no contract was formed because
the condition of inspection satisfactory to the buyer had not been met.
PepsiCo urges strongly that neither UJS nor Klein were willing to
accept the aircraft “as is,” so the condition was unsatisfied. Judge
Williams ruled that when PepsiCo agreed to make the repairs, the
condition was satisfied. Furthermore, the court below ruled that the
condition was excused by PepsiCo's refusal to tender the aircraft so
that the buyer could express his dissatisfaction.
[17] The district court's first ruling, that the condition was satisfied by
PepsiCo's offers to pay for the repairs, resolves this issue. Judge

60

Williams ruled that based on the conversations between Walker and
Rashid, the seller had agreed to make the necessary repairs to market
the plane. See Finding of Fact 34-37 at JA 89-90. Again, PepsiCo
offers no suggestion that Judge Williams committed any error, much
less clear error. Rather, PepsiCo urges its version of the facts on this
court. Without more, the company loses.
[18] Ultimately, then, a contract exists between PepsiCo and UJS for
the sale of one G-II Gulfstream aircraft.xxi Because PepsiCo failed to
deliver the aircraft, the district court ordered relief in the form of
specific performance. We now consider the appropriateness of the
relief ordered.
III.
[19] The Virginia Code § 8.2-716 permits a jilted buyer of goods to
seek specific performance of the contract if the goods sought are
unique, or in other proper circumstances. Judge Williams ruled that: 1)
the G-II aircraft involved in this case is unique and 2) Klein's inability
to cover with a comparable aircraft is strong evidence of “other
proper circumstances.” JA 111-112, Conclusions of Law No. 31 and
No. 32. These conclusions are not supported in the record.
[20] We note first that Virginia's adoption of the Uniform Commercial
Code does not abrogate the maxim that specific performance is
inappropriate where damages are recoverable and adequate. Griscom v.
Childress, 183 Va. 42, 31 S.E.2d 309, 311 (1944). In this case Judge
Williams repeatedly stated that money damages would make Klein
whole. JA 668-9, 582. Klein argued that he wanted the plane to resell it
for a profit. JA 669. Finally, an increase in the cost of a replacement
does not merit the remedy of specific performance. Hilmor Sales Co. v.
Helen Neuschalfer Division of Supronics Corp., 6 U.C.C.Rep.Serv. 325
(N.Y.Sup.Ct.1969). There is no room in this case for the equitable
remedy of specific performance.
[21] Turning now to the specific rulings of the court below, Judge
Williams explained that the aircraft was unique because only three
comparable aircraft existed on the market. Therefore, Klein would
have to go through considerable expense to find a replacement. JA
110. Klein's expert testified that there were twenty-one other G-II's on
the market, three of which were roughly comparable. JA 838-9, 128488. Klein's chief pilot said that other G-II's could be purchased. JA
259. Finally, we should note that UJS bought two G-II's which they
offered to Klein after this deal fell through, JA 796-7, and Klein made
bids on two other G-II's after PepsiCo withdrew its aircraft from the

61

market. JA 277, 666, 694. Given these facts, we find it very difficult to
support a ruling that the aircraft was so unique as to merit an order of
specific performance.
[22] Judge Williams ruled further that Klein's inability to cover his loss
is an “other proper circumstance” favoring specific performance.
Klein testified himself that he didn't purchase another G-II because
prices had started to rise. JA 693. Because of the price increase, he
decided to purchase a G-III aircraft. As noted earlier, price increases
alone are no reason to order specific performance. Because money
damages would clearly be adequate in this case, and because the
aircraft is not unique within the meaning of the Virginia Commercial
Code, we reverse the grant of specific performance and remand the
case to the district court for a trial on damages.
AFFIRMED IN PART, REVERSED AND REMANDED IN
PART.

2.1.1 Discussion of Klein v. Pepsico
When the lower court considers Klein’s claim for damages on remand, what
amounts will he be able to recover?
Do these UCC damages fully compensate Klein for all of his costs? Does
he bear any risks in complying with the statutory obligation to mitigate
losses that the statute imposes on the victim of a contractual breach?

2.2 Principal Case – Sedmak v. Charlie’s Chevrolet, Inc.
As we have already seen, the modern use of the specific performance
remedy has expanded beyond the traditional domain of land and unique
goods such as artwork and antiques. However, expectation damages remain
the preferred remedy, the ordinary judicial response to a breach of contract.
As you read Sedmak v. Charlie’s Chevrolet and the notes that follow, consider
what might explain courts’ reluctance to embrace specific performance.

Sedmak v. Charlie’s Chevrolet, Inc.
Missouri Court of Appeals
622 S.W.2d 694 (1981)
SATZ, JUDGE.
[1] This is an appeal from a decree of specific performance. We
affirm.
[2] In their petition, plaintiffs, Dr. and Mrs. Sedmak ( Sedmaks),
alleged they entered into a contract with defendant, Charlie's
Chevrolet, Inc. (Charlie's), to purchase a Corvette automobile for

62

approximately $15,000.00. The Corvette was one of a limited number
manufactured to commemorate the selection of the Corvette as the
Pace Car for the Indianapolis 500. Charlie's breached the contract, the
Sedmaks alleged, when, after the automobile was delivered, an agent
for Charlie's told the Sedmaks they could not purchase the automobile
for $15,000.00 but would have to bid on it.
[3] The trial court found the parties entered into an oral contract and
also found the contract was excepted from the Statute of Frauds. The
court then ordered Charlie's to make the automobile “available for
delivery” to the Sedmaks.
[4] Charlie's raises three points on appeal: (1) the existence of an oral
contract is not supported by the credible evidence; (2) if an oral
contract exists, it is unenforceable because of the Statute of Frauds;
and (3) specific performance is an improper remedy because the
Sedmaks did not show their legal remedies were inadequate.
[5] This was a court-tried case. The scope of our review is defined by
the well-known principles set out in Murphy v. Carron, 536 S.W.2d 30
(Mo. 1976). We sustain the judgment of the trial court unless the
judgment is not supported by substantial evidence, unless it is against
the weight of the evidence or unless it erroneously declares or applies
the law. Id. at 32. In conducting our review, we do not judge the
credibility of witnesses. That task quite properly rests with the trial
court. Rule 73.01(c)(2); Kim Mfg., Inc. v. Superior Metal Treating, Inc., 537
S.W.2d 424, 428 (Mo.App.1976).
[6] In light of these principles, the record reflects the Sedmaks to be
automobile enthusiasts, who, at the time of trial, owned six Corvettes.
In July, 1977, “Vette Vues,” a Corvette fancier's magazine to which
Dr. Sedmak subscribed, published an article announcing Chevrolet's
tentative plans to manufacture a limited edition of the Corvette. The
limited edition of approximately 6,000 automobiles was to
commemorate the selection of the Corvette as the Indianapolis 500
Pace Car. The Sedmaks were interested in acquiring one of these Pace
Cars to add to their Corvette collection. In November, 1977, the
Sedmaks asked Tom Kells, sales manager at Charlie's Chevrolet, about
the availability of the Pace Car. Mr. Kells said he did not have any
information on the car but would find out about it. Kells also said if
Charlie's were to receive a Pace Car, the Sedmaks could purchase it.
[7] On January 9, 1978, Dr. Sedmak telephoned Kells to ask him if a
Pace Car could be ordered. Kells indicated that he would require a
deposit on the car, so Mrs. Sedmak went to Charlie's and gave Kells a

63

check for $500.00. She was given a receipt for that amount bearing the
names of Kells and Charlie's Chevrolet, Inc. At that time, Kells had a
pre-order form listing both standard equipment and options available
on the Pace Car. Prior to tendering the deposit, Mrs. Sedmak asked
Kells if she and Dr. Sedmak were “definitely going to be the
owners.”Kells replied, “yes.” After the deposit had been paid, Mrs.
Sedmak stated if the car was going to be theirs, her husband wanted
some changes made to the stock model. She asked Kells to order the
car equipped with an L82 engine, four speed standard transmission
and AM/FM radio with tape deck. Kells said that he would try to
arrange with the manufacturer for these changes. Kells was able to
make the changes, and, when the car arrived, it was equipped as the
Sedmaks had requested.
[8] Kells informed Mrs. Sedmak that the price of the Pace Car would
be the manufacturer's retail price, approximately $15,000.00. The
dollar figure could not be quoted more precisely because Kells was not
sure what the ordered changes would cost, nor was he sure what the
“appearance package”—decals, a special paint job—would cost. Kells
also told Mrs. Sedmak that, after the changes had been made, a
“contract”—a retail dealer's order form—would be mailed to them.
However, no form or written contract was mailed to the Sedmaks by
Charlie's.
[9] On January 25, 1978, the Sedmaks visited Charlie's to take
delivery on another Corvette. At that time, the Sedmaks asked Kells
whether he knew anything further about the arrival date of the Pace
Car. Kells replied he had no further information but he would let the
Sedmaks know when the car arrived. Kells also requested that
Charlie's be allowed to keep the car in their showroom for
promotional purposes until after the Indianapolis 500 Race. The
Sedmaks agreed to this arrangement.
[10] On April 3, 1978, the Sedmaks were notified by Kells that the
Pace Car had arrived. Kells told the Sedmaks they could not purchase
the car for the manufacturer's retail price because demand for the car
had inflated its value beyond the suggested price. Kells also told the
Sedmaks they could bid on the car. The Sedmaks did not submit a bid.
They filed this suit for specific performance.
[11] Mr. Kells' testimony about his conversations with the Sedmaks
regarding the Pace Car differed markedly from the Sedmaks'
testimony. Kells stated that he had no definite price information on
the Pace Car until a day or two prior to its arrival at Charlie's. He

64

denied ever discussing the purchase price of the car with the Sedmaks.
He admitted, however, that after talking with the Sedmaks on January
9, 1978,xxii he telephoned the zone manager and requested changes be
made to the Pace Car. He denied the changes were made pursuant to
Dr. Sedmak's order. He claimed the changes were made because they
were “more favorable to the automobile” and were changes Dr.
Sedmak “preferred.” In ordering the changes, Kells said he was merely
taking Dr. Sedmak's advice because he was a “very knowledgeable
man on the Corvette.” There is no dispute, however, that when the
Pace Car arrived, it was equipped with the options requested by Dr.
Sedmak.
[12] Mr. Kells also denied the receipt for $500.00 given him by Mrs.
Sedmak on January 9, 1978, was a receipt for a deposit on the Pace
Car. On direct examination, he said he “accepted a five hundred dollar
($500) deposit from the Sedmaks to assure them the first opportunity
of purchasing the car.” On cross-examination, he said: “We were
accepting bids and with the five hundred dollar ($500) deposit it was
to give them the first opportunity to bid on the car.” Then after
acknowledging that other bidders had not paid for the opportunity to
bid, he explained the deposit gave the Sedmaks the “last opportunity”
to make the final bid. Based on this evidence, the trial court found the
parties entered into an oral contract for the purchase and sale of the
Pace Car at the manufacturer's suggested retail price.
[13] Charlie's first contends the Sedmaks' evidence is “so wrought with
inconsistencies and contradictions that a finding of an oral contract
for the sale of a Pace Car at the manufacturer's suggested retail price is
clearly against the weight of the evidence.” We disagree. The trial
court chose to believe the Sedmaks' testimony over that of Mr. Kells
and the reasonableness of this belief was not vitiated by any real
contradictions in the Sedmaks' testimony. Charlie's examples of
conflict are either facially not contradictory or easily reconcilable.
[14] Although not clearly stated in this point or explicitly articulated in
its argument, Charlie's also appears to argue there was no contract
because the parties did not agree to a price. The trial court concluded
“(t)he price was to be the suggested retail price of the automobile at
the time of delivery.”Apparently, Charlie's argues that if this were the
agreed to price, it is legally insufficient to support a contract because
the manufacturer's suggested retail price is not a mandatory, fixed and
definite selling price but, rather, as the term implies, it is merely a
suggested price which does not accurately reflect the market and the

65

actual selling price of automobiles. Charlie's argument is misdirected
and, thus, misses the mark.
[15] Without again detailing the facts, there was evidence to support
the trial court's conclusion that the parties agreed the selling price
would be the price suggested by the manufacturer. Whether this price
accurately reflects the market demands on any given day is immaterial.
The manufacturer's suggested retail price is ascertainable and, thus, if
the parties choose, sufficiently definite to meet the price requirements
of an enforceable contract. Failure to specify the selling price in dollars
and cents did not render the contract void or voidable. See, e. g., Klaber
v. Lahar, 63 S.W.2d 103, 106-107 (Mo.1933); see also § 400.2-305
RSMo 1978. As long as the parties agreed to a method by which the
price was to be determined and as long as the price could be
ascertained at the time of performance, the price requirement for a
valid and enforceable contract was satisfied. See Burger v. City of
Springfield, 323 S.W.2d 777, 783-84 (Mo.1959); see also, Allied Disposal,
Inc. v. Bob's Home Service, Inc., 595 S.W.2d 417, 419-20 (Mo.App.1980)
and § 400.2-305 RSMo 1978. This point is without merit.
[16] Charlie's next complains that if there were an oral contract, it is
unenforceable under the Statute of Frauds. The trial court concluded
the contract was removed from the Statute of Frauds either by the
written memoranda concerning the transaction or by partial payment
made by the Sedmaks. We find the latter ground a sufficient answer to
defendant's complaint. We discuss it and do not consider or address
the former ground.
[17] Prior to our adoption of the Uniform Commercial Code, part
payment for goods was sufficient to remove the entire contract from
the Statute of Frauds. § 432.020 RSMo 1949; Woodburn v. Cogdal, 39
Mo. 222, 228 (1866); See Coffman v. Fleming, 301 Mo. 313, 256 S.W.
731, 732-733 (1923). This result followed from the logical assumption
that money normally moves from one party to another not as a gift
but for a bargain. The basis of this rule is the probative value of the
act—part payment shows the existence of an agreement. 3 SALES &
BULK TRANSFERS UNDER U.C.C., (Bender), § 2.04(5) at 2-96.
However, “[t]his view overlooks the fact that, although ... part
payment of the price does indicate the existence of an agreement, [it
does] not reveal [the agreement's] quantity term, a key provision
without which the court cannot reconstruct the contract fairly and
provide against fraudulent claims.”1 HAWKLAND, A TRANSACTIONAL
GUIDE TO THE UNIFORM COMMERCIAL CODE (1964), § 1.1202 at 28.
Thus, under this rule a buyer who orally purchased one commercial

66

unit for $10.00 could falsely assert he purchased 100 units and, then,
by also asserting a $10.00 payment was part payment on the 100 units,
he could, in theory and in practice, convince the trier of fact that the
contract entered into was for 100 units. The Code attempts to correct
this defect by providing that part payment of an oral contract satisfies
the Statute of Frauds only “with respect to goods for which payment
has been made and accepted ....” § 400.2-201(3)(c) RSMo 1978. Under
this provision, part payment satisfies the Statute of Frauds, not for the
entire contract, but only for that quantity of goods to which part
payment can be apportioned.xxiii This change simply reflects the
rationale that part payment alone does not establish the oral contract's
quantity term.
[18] In correcting one problem, however, the change creates another
problem when, as in the instant case, payment for a single unit sale has
been less than full. Obviously, this part payment cannot be
apportioned and, thus, the question arises how shall this subsection of
the Code be applied. The few courts that have considered this
question have used opposing logic and, thus, reached opposing
answers. At least one court reads and applies the changed provision
literally and denies the enforcement of the oral contract because
payment has not been received in full. Williamson v. Martz, 11 Pa. Dist.
& Co. R.2d 33, 35 (1956). The Williamson Court reasoned:
Under the code, part payment takes the case out of
the statute only to the extent for which payment has
been made. The code therefore makes an important
change by denying the enforcement of the contract
where in the case of a single object the payment
made is less than the full amount.
Id. at 35.
[19] Charlie's argues for this view. Other courts infer that part
payment for one unit is still sufficient evidence that a contract existed
between the parties and enforce the oral contract. Lockwood v. Smigel,
18 Cal.App.3d 800, 96 Cal.Rptr. 289 (1971); Starr v. Freeport Dodge, Inc.,
54 Misc.2d 271, 282 N.Y.S.2d 58 (N.Y.Dist.1967); see also, Paloukos v.
Intermountain Chevrolet Company, 99 Idaho 740, 588 P.2d 939, 944
(1978); Bertram Yacht Sales, Inc. v. West, 209 So.2d 677, 679
(Fla.App.1968); Thomaier v. Hoffman Chevrolet, Inc., 64 A.D.2d 492, 410
N.Y.S.2d 645, 648-649 (1978). We are persuaded by the cogency of
the logic supporting this view.

67

[20] Admittedly, § 400.2-201(3)(c) does validate a divisible contract
only for as much of the goods as has been paid for. However, this
subsection was drafted to provide a method for enforcing oral
contracts where there is a quantity dispute. See Lockwood v. Smigel,
supra, 18 Cal.App.3d 800, 96 Cal.Rptr. at 291; see also, 1 HAWKLAND,
supra at 28. The subsection does not necessarily resolve the Statute of
Frauds problem where there is no quantity dispute. Neither the
language of the subsection nor its logical dictates necessarily invalidate
an oral contract for an indivisible commercial unit where part payment
has been made and accepted. If there is no dispute as to quantity, the
part payment still retains its probative value to prove the existence of
the contract.
[21] Moreover, where, as here, there is no quantity dispute, part
payment evidences the existence of a contract as satisfactorily as
would a written memorandum of agreement under the liberalized
criteria of the Code. The Code establishes only three basic
requirements for a written memorandum to take an oral contract out
of the Statute of Frauds.“First, it must evidence a contract for the sale
of goods; second it must be ‘signed,’ a word which includes any
authentication which identifies the party to be charged; and third, it
must specify a quantity.” § 400.2-201 RSMo 1978, U.C.C., Comment
1. Here, part payment evidences the contract for the sale of goods—
the car. The party to be charged—Charlie's—is identified as the one
who received payment. The quantity is not in dispute because the
Sedmaks are claiming to have purchased one unit—the car. Thus, part
payment here evidences the existence of a contract as satisfactorily as
would a written memorandum of agreement under the Code. Lockwood
v. Smigel, 18 Cal.App.3d 800, 96 Cal.Rptr. 289, 291 (1971); see also
Paloukos v. Intermountain Chevrolet Co., 99 Idaho 740, 588 P.2d 939, 944
(1978).
[22] Finally, the Code has not changed the basic policy of the Statute
of Frauds.
The purpose of the Statute of Frauds is to prevent
the enforcement of alleged promises that were never
made; it is not, and never has been, to justify the
contractors in repudiating promises that were in fact
made.
Corbin, The Uniform Commercial Code; Should It Be Enacted? 59 YALE L.J.
821, 829 (1950). Enforcement of the oral contract here carries out the
purpose of the Statute of Frauds. Denial of the contract's existence
frustrates that purpose. The present contract could not have

68

contemplated less than one car. If the part payment is believed, it must
have been intended to buy the entire car not a portion of the car.
Thus, denying the contract because part payment cannot be
apportioned encourages fraud rather than discouraging it. “The Statute
of Frauds would be used to cut down the trusting buyer rather than to
protect the one who, having made his bargain, parted with a portion
of the purchase price as an earnest of his good faith.” Starr v. Freeport
Dodge, Inc., supra, 54 Misc.2d 271, 282 N.Y.S.2d at 61.
[23] We hold, therefore, that where, as here, there is no dispute as to
quantity, part payment for a single indivisible commercial unit
validates
an
oral
contract
under
§ 400.2-201(3)(c) RSMo 1978.
[24] Finally, Charlie's contends the Sedmaks failed to show they were
entitled to specific performance of the contract. We disagree.
Although it has been stated that the determination whether to order
specific performance lies within the discretion of the trial court,
Landau v. St. Louis Public Service Co., 273 S.W.2d 255, 259 (Mo.1954),
this discretion is, in fact, quite narrow. When the relevant equitable
principles have been met and the contract is fair and plain, “‘specific
performance goes as a matter of right.’” Miller v. Coffeen, 280 S.W.2d
100, 102 (Mo.1955). Here, the trial court ordered specific performance
because it concluded the Sedmaks “have no adequate remedy at law
for the reason that they cannot go upon the open market and purchase
an automobile of this kind with the same mileage, condition,
ownership and appearance as the automobile involved in this case,
except, if at all, with considerable expense, trouble, loss, great delay
and inconvenience.” Contrary to defendant's complaint, this is a
correct expression of the relevant law and it is supported by the
evidence.
[25] Under the Code, the court may decree specific performance as a
buyer's remedy for breach of contract to sell goods “where the goods
are unique or in other proper circumstances.” § 400.2-716(1) RSMo
1978. The general term “in other proper circumstances” expresses the
drafters' intent to “further a more liberal attitude than some courts
have shown in connection with the specific performance of contracts
of sale.” § 400.2-716, U.C.C., Comment 1. This Comment was not
directed to the courts of this state, for long before the Code, we, in
Missouri, took a practical approach in determining whether specific
performance would lie for the breach of contract for the sale of goods
and did not limit this relief only to the sale of “unique” goods. Boeving
v. Vandover, 240 Mo.App. 117, 218 S.W.2d 175 (1945). In Boeving,

69

plaintiff contracted to buy a car from defendant. When the car arrived,
defendant refused to sell. The car was not unique in the traditional
legal sense but, at that time, all cars were difficult to obtain because of
war-time shortages. The court held specific performance was the
proper remedy for plaintiff because a new car “could not be obtained
elsewhere except at considerable expense, trouble or loss, which
cannot be estimated in advance and under such circumstances
(plaintiff) did not have an adequate remedy at law.” Id. at 177-178.
Thus, Boeving, presaged the broad and liberalized language of § 400.2716(1) and exemplifies one of the “other proper circumstances”
contemplated by this subsection for ordering specific performance.
§ 400.2-716, Missouri Code Comment 1. The present facts track those
in Boeving.
[26] The Pace Car, like the car in Boeving, was not unique in the
traditional legal sense. It was not an heirloom or, arguably, not one of
a kind. However, its “mileage, condition, ownership and appearance”
did make it difficult, if not impossible, to obtain its replication without
considerable expense, delay and inconvenience. Admittedly, 6,000
Pace Cars were produced by Chevrolet. However, as the record
reflects, this is limited production. In addition, only one of these cars
was available to each dealer, and only a limited number of these were
equipped with the specific options ordered by plaintiffs. Charlie's had
not received a car like the Pace Car in the previous two years. The
sticker price for the car was $14,284.21. Yet Charlie's received offers
from individuals in Hawaii and Florida to buy the Pace Car for
$24,000.00 and $28,000.00 respectively. As sensibly inferred by the
trial court, the location and size of these offers demonstrated this
limited edition was in short supply and great demand. We agree, with
the trial court. This case was a “proper circumstance” for ordering
specific performance.
Judgment affirmed.

2.2.1 The UCC and Restatement Provisions on Specific
Performance
Both the Uniform Commercial Code and the Restatement (Second) of
Contracts include provisions governing the specific performance remedy.
The Restatement has this to say:

70

§ 357. Availability of Specific Performance and
Injunction
(1) Subject to the rules stated in §§ 359-69, specific
performance of a contract duty will be granted in the
discretion of the court against a party who has committed
or is threatening to commit a breach of the duty.
(2) Subject to the rules stated in §§ 359-69, an injunction
against breach of a contract duty will be granted in the
discretion of the court against a party who has committed
or is threatening to commit a breach of the duty if
(a) the duty is one of forbearance, or
(b) the duty is one to act and specific
performance would be denied only for reasons
that are inapplicable to an injunction.
§ 359. Effect of Adequacy of Damages
(1) Specific performance or an injunction will not be
ordered if damages would be adequate to protect the
expectation interest of the injured party.
(2) The adequacy of the damage remedy for failure to
render one part of the performance due does not preclude
specific performance or injunction as to the contract as a
whole.
(3) Specific performance or an injunction will not be
refused merely because there is a remedy for breach other
than damages, but such a remedy may be considered in
exercising discretion under the rule stated in § 357.
§ 360. Factors Affecting Adequacy of Damages
In determining whether the remedy in damages would be
adequate, the following circumstances are significant:
(a) the difficulty of proving damages with
reasonable certainty,

71

(b) the difficulty of procuring a suitable substitute
performance by means of money awarded as
damages, and
(c) the likelihood that an award of damages could
not be collected.
We have already seen the relevant UCC provisions in connection with our
study of Klein v. Pepsico, but the section is reprinted here for convenient
reference and to allow for comparison to the Restatement’s discussion of
specific performance:
§ 2-716 Buyer’s Right to Specific Performance or
Replevin.
(1) Specific performance may be decreed where the goods
are unique or in other proper circumstances.
(2) The decree for specific performance may include such
terms and conditions as to payment of the price, damages,
or other relief as the court may deem just.
(3) The buyer has a right of replevin for goods identified to
the contract if after reasonable effort he is unable to effect
cover for such goods or the circumstances reasonably
indicate that such effort will be unavailing or if the goods
have been shipped under reservation and satisfaction of
the security interest in them has been made or tendered. In
the case of goods bought for personal, family, or
household purposes, the buyer’s right of replevin vests
upon acquisition of a special property, even if the seller
had not then repudiated or failed to deliver.
Official Comment
Purposes of Changes: To make it clear that:
1. The present section continues in general prior policy as
to specific performance and injunction against breach.
However, without intending to impair in any way the
exercise of the court's sound discretion in the matter, this
Article seeks to further a more liberal attitude than some
courts have shown in connection with the specific
performance of contracts of sale.

72

2. In view of this Article's emphasis on the commercial
feasibility of replacement, a new concept of what are
"unique" goods is introduced under this section. Specific
performance is no longer limited to goods which are
already specific or ascertained at the time of contracting.
The test of uniqueness under this section must be made in
terms of the total situation which characterizes the
contract. Output and requirements contracts involving a
particular or peculiarly available source or market present
today the typical commercial specific performance
situation, as contrasted with contracts for the sale of
heirlooms or priceless works of art which were usually
involved in the older cases. However, uniqueness is not
the sole basis of the remedy under this section for the
relief may also be granted "in other proper circumstances"
and inability to cover is strong evidence of "other proper
circumstances".
2.2.2 The Meaning of “Other Proper Circumstances”
Recall that the court in Klein v. Pepsico refused to order specific performance
because Klein could have obtained cover in the market for corporate jets. A
contrasting case is King Aircraft Sales v. Lane, 846 P.2d 550 (Wash. App.
1993), in which the court found that specific performance was an
appropriate remedy for the breach of a contract to sell collectible aircraft.
As the court explained:
[T]he planes were fairly characterized as “one of a
kind” or “possibly the best” in the United States;
however, it was not proved that the planes were
“unique” because there were others of the same
make and model available. However, the planes were
so rare in terms of their exceptional condition that
King had no prospect to cover its anticipated resales
by purchasing alternative planes, because there was
no possibility of finding similar or better planes.

Id. at 553.
2.2.3 Monetary Specific Performance
What happens if a court determines that specific performance is an
appropriate remedy but the breaching seller has already sold the goods to
someone else? Ordinarily, no grounds exist for recovering the goods from
the innocent third-party purchaser, and it is therefore impossible to procure
the goods themselves. An award of “monetary specific performance” solves

73

this problem by ordering the seller to pay the original buyer the proceeds of
the third-party sale.
Because monetary specific performance may give the buyer an amount far
greater than any plausible estimate of the market-contract price differential,
courts are often reluctant to exercise this power. In Bander v. Grossman, 161
Misc. 2d 119, 611 N.Y.S.2d 985 (1994), for example, a dealer in collectible
cars failed to deliver a rare Aston Martin because he was unable to clear the
title to the vehicle. Prices of collectible automobiles are remarkably volatile,
and the price of this Aston Martin fluctuated wildly during the period from
contract formation to final judgment.
Time
Price
Contract Price (Summer 1987)
$40,000
Time of Breach (December 1987)
$60,000
Sale to Third Party (April 1989?)
$225,000
Peak Price in (July 1989)
$335,000
Time of Trial (1993?)
$80,000
The plaintiff-buyer sought to recover the $225,000 proceeds that seller
received from selling the Aston Martin to a third party. The trial court
refused and instead awarded $20,000 in damages, representing the marketcontract price differential on the date of breach in December 1987. It
appears that similar Aston Martins were quite rare, but the court concluded
that had the buyer sought substitute performance in December 1987 a
comparable car would have been available for purchase at $60,000. The
appellate court affirmed and explained why the long delay between breach
and trial militated strongly against an award of monetary specific
performance.
With the passage of time, specific performance
becomes disfavored. For example, because goods are
subject to a rapid change in condition, or the cost of
maintenance of the goods is important, time may be
found to have been of the essence, and even a
month’s delay may defeat specific performance….
Turning to the facts of the instant case, the plaintiff
did not sue in December of 1987, when it is likely a
request for specific performance would have been
granted. At that point, the defendant had disclaimed
the contract and plaintiff was aware of his rights.
The plaintiff was not protected by a continued firm
assurance that defendant definitely would perfect the
car’s title…. The court does not accept plaintiff’s

74

protest that he believed the commercial relationship
was intact; the parties had already had a heated
discussion and were communicating through
attorneys. A more likely explanation of plaintiff’s
inaction is that he proceeded to complete the
purchase in April of 1988 of a Ferrari Testarossa for
$128,000 and a Lamborghini for $40,000 in 1989.

Id. at 990.
2.2.4 American Brands v. Playgirl
In American Brands, Inc. v. Playgirl, Inc., 498 F.2d 947 (2d Cir. 1974), the
Second Circuit confronted a conflict about cigarette advertising on the back
cover of Playgirl magazine. Since the first publication of the magazine,
American Brands had contracted with Playgirl to run their ads on the back
cover of every issue. Citing a desire to diversify their advertising base,
Playgirl repudiated the contract and refused to continue the cigarette ads.
American Brands asserted that “back cover advertising is not fungible, and
that Playgirl alone and uniquely provides an advertising audience composed
of young, malleable, and affluent females.” The appellate court was
unimpressed with the evidence American Brands produced concerning the
uniqueness of the Playgirl readership and refused to award specific
performance.
A contrasting case from Illinois granted an injunction in favor of PC Brand
and distinguished American Brands v. Playgirl in the following terms:
American Brands is clearly distinguishable from this
case. PC Brand is a much smaller company than
American Brands, Inc., a tobacco company, and its
target market is more limited. PC Brand is a mail
order computer company, whose only clients come
from its magazine advertisements, which include
mail and telephone order forms. In contrast,
American Brands, Inc.’s advertising targets are much
more diverse. Moreover, the tobacco company was
not structured around an advertising and discount

2.2.5 Alan Schwartz’s Case for Specific Performance
Professor Alan Schwartz has argued that specific performance should be
the remedial rule rather than the exception. In the excerpt that follows, he
summarizes the main lines of argument:
Specific performance is the most accurate method of
achieving the compensation goal of contract
remedies because it gives the promisee the precise
performance that he purchased. The natural
question, then, is why specific performance is not
routinely available. Three explanations of the law's
restrictions on specific performance are possible.
First, the law's commitment to the compensation
goal may be less than complete; restricting specific
performance may reflect an inarticulate reluctance to
pursue the compensation goal fully. Second,
damages may generally be fully compensatory. In
that event, expanding the availability of specific
performance would create opportunities for
promisees to exploit promisors by threatening to
compel, or actually compelling, performance,
without furthering the compensation goal. The third
explanation is that concerns of efficiency or liberty
may justify restricting specific performance, despite
its greater accuracy; specific performance might
generate higher transaction costs than the damage
remedy, or interfere more with the liberty interests
of promisors. The first justification is beyond the
scope of the analysis here. The second and third
explanations will be examined in detail.
With respect to the second justification, current
doctrine authorizes specific performance when
courts cannot calculate compensatory damages with
even a rough degree of accuracy. If the class of cases
in which there are difficulties in computing damages
corresponds closely to the class of cases in which
specific performance is now granted, expanding the
availability of specific performance is obviously
unnecessary. Further, such an expansion would
create opportunities for promisees to exploit
promisors. The class of cases in which damage
awards fail to compensate promisees adequately is,
however, broader than the class of cases in which
specific performance is now granted. Thus the
compensation goal supports removing rather than

76

retaining present restrictions on the availability of
specific performance.
It is useful to begin by examining the paradigm case
for granting specific performance under current law,
the case of unique goods. When a promisor breaches
and the promisee can make a transaction that
substitutes for the performance the promisor failed
to render, the promisee will be fully compensated if
he receives the additional amount necessary to
purchase the substitute plus the costs of making a
second transaction. In some cases, however, such as
those involving works of art, courts cannot identify
which transactions the promisee would regard as
substitutes because that information often is in the
exclusive possession of the promisee. Moreover, it is
difficult for a court to assess the accuracy of a
promisee's claim. For example, if the promisor
breaches a contract to sell a rare emerald, the
promisee may claim that only the Hope Diamond
would give him equal satisfaction, and thus may sue
for the price difference between the emerald and the
diamond. It would be difficult for a court to know
whether this claim is true. If the court seeks to award
money damages, it has three choices: granting the
price differential, which may overcompensate the
promisee; granting the dollar value of the promisee's
foregone satisfaction as estimated by the court,
which may overcompensate or undercompensate; or
granting restitution of any sums paid, which
undercompensates the promisee. The promisee is
fully compensated without risk of overcompensation
or undercompensation if the remedy of specific
performance is available to him and its use
encouraged by the doctrine that damages must be
foreseeable and certain.
If specific performance is the appropriate remedy in
such cases, there are three reasons why it should be
routinely available. The first reason is that in many
cases damages actually are undercompensatory.
Although promisees are entitled to incidental
damages, such damages are difficult to monetize.
They consist primarily of the costs of finding and
making a second deal, which generally involve the
expenditure of time rather than cash; attaching a
dollar value to such opportunity costs is quite

77

difficult. Breach can also cause frustration and anger,
especially in a consumer context, but these costs also
are not recoverable.
Substitution damages, the court's estimate of the
amount the promisee needs to purchase an adequate
substitute, also may be inaccurate in many cases less
dramatic than the emerald hypothetical discussed
above. This is largely because of product
differentiation and early obsolescence. As product
differentiation becomes more common, the supply
of products that will substitute precisely for the
promisor's performance is reduced. For example,
even during the period when there is an abundant
supply of new Datsuns for sale, two-door, two-tone
Datsuns with mag wheels, stereo, and air
conditioning may be scarce in some local markets.
Moreover, early obsolescence gives the promisee a
short time in which to make a substitute purchase. If
the promisor breaches late in a model year, for
example, it may be difficult for the promisee to buy
the exact model he wanted. For these reasons, a
damage award meant to enable a promisee to
purchase
“another
car”
could
be
undercompensatory.
In addition, problems of prediction often make it
difficult to put a promisee in the position where he
would have been had his promisor performed. If a
breach by a contractor would significantly delay or
prevent completion of a construction project and the
project differs in important respects from other
projects—for example, a department store in a
different location than previous stores—courts may
be reluctant to award “speculative” lost profits
attributable to the breach.
Second, promisees have economic incentives to sue
for damages when damages are likely to be fully
compensatory. A breaching promisor is reluctant to
perform and may be hostile. This makes specific
performance an unattractive remedy in cases in
which the promisor's performance is complex,
because the promisor is more likely to render a
defective performance when that performance is
coerced, and the defectiveness of complex
performances is sometimes difficult to establish in
court. Further, when the promisor's performance

78

must be rendered over time, as in construction or
requirements contracts, it is costly for the promisee
to monitor a reluctant promisor's conduct. If the
damage remedy is compensatory, the promisee
would prefer it to incurring these monitoring costs.
Finally, given the time necessary to resolve lawsuits,
promisees would commonly prefer to make
substitute transactions promptly and sue later for
damages rather than hold their affairs in suspension
while awaiting equitable relief. The very fact that a
promisee requests specific performance thus implies
that damages are an inadequate remedy.
The third reason why courts should permit
promisees to elect routinely the remedy of specific
performance is that promisees possess better
information than courts as to both the adequacy of
damages and the difficulties of coercing
performance. Promisees know better than courts
whether the damages a court is likely to award would
be adequate because promisees are more familiar
with the costs that breach imposes on them. In
addition, promisees generally know more about their
promisors than do courts; thus they are in a better
position to predict whether specific performance
decrees would induce their promisors to render
satisfactory performances.
In sum, restrictions on the availability of specific
performance cannot be justified on the basis that
damage awards are usually compensatory. On the
contrary, the compensation goal implies that specific
performance should be routinely available. This is
because
damage
awards
actually
are
undercompensatory in more cases than is commonly
supposed; the fact of a specific performance request
is itself good evidence that damages would be
inadequate; and courts should delegate to promisees
the decision of which remedy best satisfies the
compensation goal. Further, expanding the
availability of specific performance would not result
in greater exploitation of promisors. Promisees
would seldom abuse the power to determine when
specific performance should be awarded because of
the strong incentives that promisees face to seek
damages when these would be even approximately
compensatory.

(1979).
2.2.6 The Goetz & Scott Approach to Breach and Mitigation
A competing view of the same problem begins instead with the potentially
valuable role of mitigation. In the following passage, Charles Goetz and
Robert Scott argue that a seller decides to breach when the buyer can more
cheaply obtain substitute performance.
There may be circumstances ... in which the obligee
can more advantageously make all or part of the
adjustment. For example, Buyer may be able to
install adjustable windows, use temporary air
conditioning units, or even delay occupancy until the
strike is settled. Seller would be foolish under such
circumstances to adjust autonomously; that would
not be the cheapest way to satisfy his performance
obligation. Seller would instead prefer that Buyer
readjust, even though Seller will have to bear the
resulting expense. One can characterize an obligor's
decision to breach, therefore, as an election to
surrender irrevocably his option to perform—a
request that the obligee bear all future adjustment
costs, with damages provided as reimbursement.
Breach is the obligor's signal that: "My assessment of
our relative capacities suggests that you enjoy the
comparative advantage on all prospective
adjustments. Therefore, please undertake all costminimizing adjustments and send me the bill." In
essence, breach involves a final commitment to
quasi-performance (breach with damages) as the
most efficient means of satisfying the original
contractual obligation.
This approach rests on the general principle that we
should design legal rules to reduce the parties’ joint
costs of contracting. Efficient damage rules must
encourage both parties to participate in reducing the
costs of breach. When the obligor announces her
decision to breach, it becomes a “cry for help”
intended to enlists the aid of the obligee in obtaining
substitute performance as cheaply as possible. The
conventional expectation damage measure joins with
the avoidability doctrine to give the obligor an
option to breach and pay the obligee’s cost of cover
rather than continuing with performance regardless

80

of its cost. An award of specific performance, in
contrast, gives the obligee an unconditional right to
receive the promised performance from the obligor.
If the remedy of specific performance were routinely
available, obligees would have far fewer incentives to
cooperate.

General Theory of Contractual Obligation, 69 VA. L. REV. 967, 979-80
(1983).
2.2.7 Discussion of Specific Performance
Does the UCC follow the traditional common law approach to awarding
specific performance?
What does Sedmak teach us about the meaning of “other proper
circumstances”?
Is King Aircraft consistent with this understanding of the doctrine?
Can you reconcile Sedmak and King Aircraft with Klein v. Pepsico?
In Bander v. Grossman, the court could have awarded damages measured as
of the time of breach, the time of suit, the time of cover, or the time of final
judgment. Which approach is best, and why?
What do you suppose explains why case law and statutes express a strong
preference for damages rather than the remedy of specific performance?
Thinking more broadly about the policy justifications for awarding specific
performance, what advantages does this remedy have over damages? What
ideas does the excerpt by Alan Schwartz add to the conventional case for
specific performance?
Consider the concluding sentence of the Schwartz excerpt:
Promisees would seldom abuse the power to
determine [whether] specific performance should be
awarded because of the strong incentives promisees
face to seek damages when these would be even
approximately compensatory.

Can you think of any other (less benign) reason to seek specific
performance?

3 Limitations on Damages
In this section, we consider more closely the main doctrinal limitations on
monetary damages—foreseeability, certainty and mitigation. Our discussion

81

of the hypo based on Globe Refining introduced the idea that courts refuse to
compensate a promisee for unforeseeable losses. As we will soon see, the
venerable English case of Hadley v. Baxendale defines the basic contours of a
rule that promisees may recover only for those losses that were reasonably
foreseeable at the time of contracting. Recall also that in Freund v. Washington
Square Press, the certainty limitation prevented Freund from recovering any
loss of royalties due to the failure to publish his book on modern drama.
We consider here the related problem of recovering lost profits from a new
business and see in Drews Company v. Ledwith-Wolfe Associates how the
doctrinal requirement of reasonable certainty may cause significant undercompensation. Finally, recall that in the Globe Refining hypo, a doctrine of
avoidable consequences precluded recovery for damages that the promisee
could have taken cost-justified steps to mitigate. See Restatement § 350;
UCC § 2-715. In Rockingham County v. Luten Bridge Co., we will see how the
repudiation of a contract may present the promisee with surprisingly
difficult decisions about mitigation and significant potential risks. Finally,
Parker v. Twentieth Century Fox shows us how mitigation doctrine applies to
one (very lucrative) employment contract and poses the challenging
question of whether a promisee should have to accept an offer of substitute
performance from the breaching party.

3.1 Principal Case – Hadley v. Baxendale
The foreseeability doctrine is most often associated with the following
famous 19th Century English case.

Hadley v. Baxendale
Court of Exchequer
9 Exch. 341, 156 Eng. Rep. 145 (1854)
[1] [Reporter’s Headnote:] At the trial before Crompton, J., at the last
Gloucester Assizes, it appeared that the plaintiffs carried on an
extensive business as millers at Gloucester; and that, on the 11th of
May, their mill was stopped by a breakage of the crank shaft by which
the mill was worked. The steam-engine was manufactured by Messrs.
Joyce & Co., the engineers, at Greenwich, and it became necessary to
send the shaft as a pattern for a new one to Greenwich. The fracture
was discovered on the 12th, and on the 13th the plaintiffs sent one of
their servants to the office of the defendants, who are the well-known
carriers trading under the name of Pickford & Co., for the purpose of
having the shaft carried to Greenwich. The plaintiffs' servant told the
clerk that the mill was stopped, and that the shaft must be sent
immediately; and in answer to the inquiry when the shaft would be

82

taken, the answer was, that if it was sent up by twelve o'clock any day,
it would be delivered at Greenwich on the following day. On the
following day the shaft was taken by the defendants, before noon, for
the purpose of being conveyed to Greenwich, and the sum of 2£ 4s.
was paid for its carriage for the whole distance; at the same time the
defendants' clerk was told that a special entry, if required, should be
made to hasten its delivery. The delivery of the shaft at Greenwich was
delayed by some neglect; and the consequence was, that the plaintiffs
did not receive the new shaft for several days after they would
otherwise have done, and the working of their mill was thereby
delayed, and they thereby lost the profits they would otherwise have
received.
[2] On the part of the defendants, it was objected that these damages
were too remote, and that the defendants were not liable with respect
to them. The learned Judge left the case generally to the jury, who
found a verdict with 25£ damages beyond the amount paid into Court.
[3] Whateley, in last Michaelmas Term, obtained a rule nisi for a new
trial, on the ground of misdirection.
ALDERSON, B.
[4] We think that there ought to be a new trial in this case; but, in so
doing, we deem it to be expedient and necessary to state explicitly the
rule which the Judge, at the next trial, ought, in our opinion, to direct
the jury to be governed by when they estimate the damages.
[5] Indeed, it is of the last importance that we should do this; for, if
the jury are left without any definite rule to guide them, it will, in such
cases as these, manifestly lead to the greatest injustice. The Courts
have done this on several occasions; and in Blake v. Midland Railway
Company (18 Q. B. 93), the Court granted a new trial on this very
ground, that the rule had not been definitely laid down to the jury by
the learned Judge at Nisi Prius.
[6] "There are certain establishing rules", this Court says, in Alder v.
Keighley (15 M. & W. 117), "according to which the jury ought to find".
And the Court, in that case, adds: "and here there is a clear rule, that
the amount which would have been received if the contract had been
kept, is the measure of damages if the contract is broken."
[7] Now we think the proper rule in such a case as the present is
this:-- Where two parties have made a contract which one of them has
broken, the damages which the other party ought to receive in respect
of such breach of contract should be such as may fairly and reasonably

83

be considered either arising naturally, i.e., according to the usual
course of things, from such breach of contract itself, or such as may
reasonably be supposed to have been in the contemplation of both
parties, at the time they made the contract, as the probable result of
the breach of it. Now, if the special circumstances under which the
contract was actually made were communicated by the plaintiffs to the
defendants, and thus known to both parties, the damages resulting
from the breach of such a contract, which they would reasonably
contemplate, would be the amount of injury which would ordinarily
follow from a breach of contract under these special circumstances so
known and communicated. But, on the other hand, if these special
circumstances were wholly unknown to the party breaking the
contract, he, at the most, could only be supposed to have had in his
contemplation the amount of injury which would arise generally, and
in the great multitude of cases not affected by any special
circumstances, from such a breach of contract. For, had the special
circumstances been known, the parties might have specially provided
for the breach of contract by special terms as to the damages in that
case; and of this advantage it would be very unjust to deprive them.
Now the above principles are those by which we think the jury ought
to be guided in estimating the damages arising out of any breach of
contract. It is said, that other cases such as breaches of contract in the
nonpayment of money, or in the not making a good title of land, are
to be treated as exceptions from this, and as governed by a
conventional rule. But as, in such cases, both parties must be supposed
to be cognizant of that well-known rule, these cases may, we think, be
more properly classed under the rule above enunciated as to cases
under known special circumstances, because there both parties may
reasonably be presumed to contemplate the estimation of the amount
of damages according to the conventional rule. Now, in the present
case, if we are to apply the principles above laid down, we find that the
only circumstances here communicated by the plaintiffs to the
defendants at the time of the contract was made, were, that the article
to be carried was the broken shaft of a mill, and that the plaintiffs
were the millers of the mill.
[8] But how do these circumstances shew reasonably that the profits
of the mill must be stopped by an unreasonable delay in the delivery of
the broken shaft by the carrier to the third person? Suppose the
plaintiffs had another shaft in their possession put up or putting up at
the time, and that they only wished to send back the broken shaft to
the engineer who made it; it is clear that this would be quite consistent
with the above circumstances, and yet the unreasonable delay in the

84

delivery would have no effect upon the intermediate profits of the
mill. Or, again, suppose that, at the time of the delivery to the carrier,
the machinery of the mill had been in other respects defective, then,
also, the same results would follow. Here it is true that the shaft was
actually sent back to serve as a model for the new one, and that the
want of a new one was the only cause of the stoppage of the mill, and
that the loss of profits really arose from not sending down the new
shaft in proper time, and that this arose from the delay in delivering
the broken one to serve as a model. But it is obvious that, in the great
multitude of cases of millers sending off broken shafts to third
persons by a carrier under ordinary circumstances, such consequences
would not, in all probability, have occurred; and these special
circumstances were here never communicated by the plaintiffs to the
defendants. It follows therefore, that the loss of profits here cannot
reasonably be considered such a consequence of the breach of
contract as could have been fairly and reasonably contemplated by
both the parties when they made this contract. For such loss would
neither have flowed naturally from the breach of this contract in the
great multitude of such cases occurring under ordinary circumstances,
nor were the special circumstances, which, perhaps, would have made
it a reasonable and natural consequence of such breach of contract,
communicated to or known by the defendants. The Judge ought,
therefore, to have told the jury that upon the facts then before them
they ought not to take the loss of profits into consideration at all in
estimating the damages. There must therefore be a new trial in this
case.
Rule absolute.

3.1.1 The Facts of Hadley v. Baxendale
There is an apparent discrepancy between the account of the facts
contained in the Reporter’s Headnote and the factual basis for Baron
Alderson’s analysis of the case. A subsequent English case attempted to
clear up the confusion in the following way:
In considering the meaning and application of these
rules it is essential to bear clearly in mind the facts
on which Hadley v. Baxendale proceeded. The
headnote is definitely misleading insofar as it says
that the defendant’s clerk, who attended at the
office, was told that the mill was stopped and that
the shaft must be delivered immediately. The same
allegation figures in the statement of facts which are
said on page 344 to have “appeared” at the trial

85

before Crompton, J. If the Court of Exchequer had
accepted these facts as established, the court must,
one would suppose, have decided the case the other
way round…. But it is reasonably plain from
Alderson B.’s judgment that the court rejected this
evidence, for on page 355 he says: “We find that the
only circumstances here communicated by the
plaintiffs to the defendants at the time when the
contract was made were that the article to be carried
was the broken shaft of a mill and that the plaintiffs
were the millers of the mill.”

Victoria Laundry (Windsor) Ltd. v. Newman Indus. Ltd., 2 K.B. 528, 537
(1940).
3.1.2 The Contemporary Applicability of Hadley
Professor Richard Danzig has argued that Hadley’s approach to
foreseeability no longer suits the realities of contemporary contracting
behavior.
[I]n Hadley v. Baxendale the court spoke as though
entrepreneurs were universally flexible enough and
enterprises were small enough for individuals to be
able to serve “notice” over the counter of specialized
needs calling for unusual arrangements. But in masstransaction situations a seller cannot plausibly engage
in an individualized “contemplation” of the
consequences of breach and a subsequent tailoring
of a transaction. In the course of his conversion of a
family business into a modern industrial enterprise,
Baxendale [the company’s managing director] made
Pickfords itself into an operation where the
contemplation branch of the rule in Hadley v.
Baxendale was no longer viable. Even in the 1820’s
the Pickfords’ operations were “highly complex”….
A century later most enterprises fragment and
standardize operations…. This development—and
the law’s recognition of it—makes it self-evidently
impossible to serve legally cognizable notice on, for
example, an airline that a scheduled flight is of
special importance or on the telephone company
that uninterrupted service is particularly vital at a
particular point in a firm’s business cycle….
The inadequacies of the rule are masked by still more
fundamental phenomena which render the case of
very limited relevance to the present economy. At

86

least in mass-transaction situations, the modern
enterprise manager is not concerned with his
corporation’s liability as it arises from a particular
transaction, but rather with liability when averaged
over the full run of transactions of a given type. In
the mass-production situation the run of these
transactions will average his consequential-damages
pay-out in a way far more predictable than a jury’s
guesses about the pay-out. In other words, for this
type of entrepreneur—a type already emerging at the
time of Hadley v. Baxendale, and far more prevalent
today—there is no need for the law to provide
protection from the aberrational customer; his own
market and self-insurance capacities are great enough
for the job.

Richard Danzig, Hadley v. Baxendale: A Study in the Industrialization of the
Law, 4 J. LEGAL STUD. 249, 279-83 (1975).
3.1.3 Discussion of Hadley v. Baxendale
The court says that “it is obvious that in the great multitude of cases of
millers sending off broken shafts to third persons” the mill would not
ordinarily be stopped. Is this true?
Suppose that you go to the local United Parcel Service office to ship a box
of diamonds. What is the effect of the Hadley rule on parties like you who
have a special susceptibility to consequential damages?
How will you likely change your behavior in response to the foreseeability
limitation on damages? How is UPS likely to respond?
Suppose now that you moved to a jurisdiction in which an anti-Hadley
default rule of unlimited consequential damages prevailed. How are carriers
like Pickford & Co. or UPS likely to adapt to this new default rule?
Danzig asserts that the increasingly complex nature of modern enterprises
makes it “self-evidently impossible to serve legally cognizable notice on” an
airline that a scheduled flight is of special importance or a phone company
that uninterrupted service is particularly vital. Can you think of any
response to this critique of the Hadley rule?
In another portion of the same article, Danzig proposed that courts should
evaluate the foreseeability of consequential damages at the time of breach
rather than at the time of contracting. What would be the probable effect of
such a change?

87

3.2 Introduction to the Certainty Limitation
Courts routinely require plaintiffs to prove any loss from a breach of
contract with reasonable certainty. The Restatement (Second) of Contracts
expresses this requirement in the following terms:
§ 352. Uncertainty as a Limitation on Damages
Damages are not recoverable for loss beyond an amount
that the evidence permits to be established with reasonable
certainty.
Comment:
a. Requirement of certainty. A party cannot recover damages
for breach of a contract for loss beyond the amount that
the evidence permits to be established with reasonable
certainty. Courts have traditionally required greater
certainty in the proof of damages for breach of a contract
than in the proof of damages for a tort. The requirement
does not mean, however, that the injured party is barred
from recovery unless he establishes the total amount of his
loss. It merely excludes those elements of loss that cannot
be proved with reasonable certainty. The main impact of
the requirement of certainty comes in connection with
recovery for lost profits. Although the requirement of
certainty is distinct from that of foreseeability (§ 351), its
impact is similar in this respect. Although the requirement
applies to damages based on the reliance as well as the
expectation interest, there is usually little difficulty in
proving the amount that the injured party has actually
spent in reliance on the contract, even if it is impossible to
prove the amount of profit that he would have made. In
such a case, he can recover his loss based on his reliance
interest instead of on his expectation interest.
Doubts are generally resolved against the party in breach.
A party who has, by his breach, forced the injured party to
seek compensation in damages should not be allowed to
profit from his breach where it is established that a
significant loss has occurred. A court may take into
account all the circumstances of the breach, including
willfulness, in deciding whether to require a lesser degree

88

of certainty, giving greater discretion to the trier of the
facts. Damages need not be calculable with mathematical
accuracy and are often at best approximate. See Comment
1 to Uniform Commercial Code § 1-106. This is especially
true for items such as loss of good will as to which great
precision cannot be expected. Furthermore, increasing
receptiveness on the part of courts to proof by
sophisticated economic and financial data and by expert
opinion has made it easier to meet the requirement of
certainty.
b. Proof of profits. The difficulty of proving lost profits varies
greatly with the nature of the transaction. If, for example,
it is the seller who claims lost profit on the ground that the
buyer's breach has caused him to lose a sale, proof of lost
profit will ordinarily not be difficult. If, however, it is the
buyer who claims lost profit on the ground that the seller's
breach has caused him loss in other transactions, the task
of proof is harder. Furthermore, if the transaction is more
complex and extends into the future, as where the seller
agrees to furnish all of the buyer's requirements over a
period of years, proof of the loss of profits caused by the
seller's breach is more difficult. If the breach prevents the
injured party from carrying on a well-established business,
the resulting loss of profits can often be proved with
sufficient certainty. Evidence of past performance will
form the basis for a reasonable prediction as to the future..
However, if the business is a new one or if it is a
speculative one that is subject to great fluctuations in
volume, costs or prices, proof will be more difficult.
Nevertheless, damages may be established with reasonable
certainty with the aid of expert testimony, economic and
financial data, market surveys and analyses, business
records of similar enterprises, and the like. Under a
contract of exclusive agency for the sale of goods on
commission, the agent can often prove with sufficient
certainty the profits that he would have made had he not
been discharged. Proof of the sales made by the agent in
the agreed territory before the breach, or of the sales made
there by the principal after the breach, may permit a
reasonably accurate estimate of the agent's loss of
commissions. However, if the agency is not an exclusive
one, so that the agent's ability to withstand competition is

89

in question, such a showing will be more difficult, although
the agent's past record may give a sufficient basis for
judging this.

3.3 Principal Case – Drews Company v. Ledwith-Wolfe
Associates
Drews Company, Inc. v. Ledwith-Wolfe Associates, Inc.
Supreme Court of South Carolina
371 S.E.2d 532 (1988)
HARWELL, JUSTICE:
[1] This case involves the breach of a construction contract. We
affirm the trial court's refusal to grant a new trial, but reverse the jury's
award of lost profits.
FACTS
[2] The Drews Company, Inc. (“Contractor”) contracted to renovate
a building owned by Ledwith-Wolfe Associates, Inc. (“Owner”).
Owner intended to convert the building into a restaurant. From its
inception, the project was plagued by construction delays, work
change orders, and general disagreement over the quality of work
performed. Contractor eventually pulled its workers off the project.
Contractor later filed, then sued to foreclose, a mechanic's lien for
labor and materials used in renovating the building. Owner
counterclaimed, alleging Contractor breached the contract and forced
Owner to rework part of the job. Owner also claimed that
Contractor's delays in performance caused Owner to lose profits from
the restaurant.
[3] The jury returned an $18,000 verdict for Contractor on its
complaint. The jury awarded Owner $22,895 on its counterclaim for
re-doing and completing the work and $14,000 in lost profits caused
by Contractor's delays. The trial judge denied Contractor's new trial
motion and awarded Owner attorney's fees and costs pursuant to S.C.
Code Ann. § 29-5-10 (Supp.1987) (mechanics' liens).
A.
[4] Contractor first argues that the trial court erred in admitting
evidence of Owner's “delay damages” because the contract contained
no completion date or statement that “time was of the essence.” We
disagree.

90

[5] A contractor may be liable for delay damages regardless of
whether time was of the essence of the contract. 17A C.J.S.

performance, time is not of the essence of the contract and it must be
performed within a reasonable time. General Sprinkler Corp. v. Loris
Industrial Developers, Inc., 271 F.Supp. 551, 557 (D.S.C.1967); see Davis v.
Cordell, 115 S.E.2d 649 (S.C. 1960) (applying “reasonable time” rule to
time for payment under contract); Cloniger v. Cloniger, 193 S.E.2d 647
(S.C. 1973) (applying “reasonable time” rule to agreement to
repurchase property within an unspecified time); Smith v. Spratt Machine
Co., 24 S.E. 376 (S.C. 1896) (where manufacturing contract specified
no time for performance, “reasonable time” implied); see also 17A
C.J.S. CONTRACTS § 503(a)(1) (1963) ( “reasonable time” for
performance will be implied where no time therefor is fixed in
building or construction contract). The timeliness of Contractor's
performance here was a disputed factual issue properly reserved for
jury determination.
B.
[6] Contractor's next exception presents this Court with an
opportunity to address a legal issue unsettled in South Carolina: Does
the “new business rule” operate to automatically preclude the recovery
of lost profits by a new business or enterprise? We hold that it does
not.
1. Lost Profits in South Carolina
[7] We begin our analysis of the lost profits issue by recognizing an
elementary principle of contract law. The purpose of an award of
damages for breach is “to give compensation, that is, to put the
plaintiff in as good a position as he would have been in had the
contract been performed.” 11 S. WILLISTON, A TREATISE ON THE
LAW OF CONTRACTS, § 1338 (3d ed. 1968). The proper measure of
that compensation, then, “is the loss actually suffered by the
contractee as the result of the breach.” South Carolina Finance Corp. v.
West Side Finance Co., 113 S.E.2d 329, 335 (S.C. 1960).
[8] “Profits” have been defined as “the net pecuniary gain from a
transaction, the gross pecuniary gains diminished by the cost of
obtaining them.” Restatement of Contracts § 331, Comment B (1932); see
Mali v. Odom, 367 S.E.2d 166 (S.C. Ct. App. 1988) (defining “profits”
as the net of income over expenditures during a given period). Profits
lost by a business as the result of a contractual breach have long been
recognized as a species of recoverable consequential damages in this

91

state. Hollingsworth on Wheels, Inc. v. Arkon Corp., 305 S.E.2d 71 (S.C.
1983); South Carolina Finance Corp. v. West Side Finance Co., supra. The
issue is more difficult, however, when a new or unestablished business
is the aggrieved party seeking projected lost profits as damages.
[9] The new business rule as a per se rule of nonrecoverability of lost
profits was firmly established in this state in Standard Supply Co. v.
Carter & Harris, 62 S.E. 150, 152 (S.C. 1907): “When a business is in
contemplation, but not established or not in actual operation, profit
merely hoped for is too uncertain and conjectural to be considered.”
McMeekin v. Southern Ry. Co., 64 S.E. 413 (S.C. 1909), like Standard
Supply Co., involved profits allegedly lost when a carrier failed to
deliver machinery necessary for a new mill enterprise. The Court
adhered to a strict application of the rule, stating that “[t]he plaintiff's
business had not been launched, and therefore he could not recover
profits he expected to make.” 64 S.E. at 415; cited in Currie v. Davis,
126 S.E. 119 (S.C. 1923) (new business rule applied to preclude
recovery of lost profits where carrier's tort against passenger delayed
production by passenger's cotton gin “not yet in active operation”).
[10] Modern cases, however, reflect the willingness of this Court and
our Court of Appeals to view the new business rule as a rule of
evidentiary sufficiency rather than an automatic bar to recovery of lost
profits by a new business. See Hollingsworth on Wheels, Inc. v. Arkon Corp.,
supra (holding that while aggrieved buyer's projections of lost profits
from new business enterprise introduced unreasonable amount of
uncertainty into damages computation, evidence sufficient to permit
Court itself to reach reasonable figure for profits lost); Bryson v.
Arcadian Shores, Inc., 257 S.E.2d 233 (S.C. 1979) (evidence of room
revenues allegedly lost by hotel as result of construction delay held
speculative and insufficient to allow recovery); Mali v. Odom, supra
(attorney malpractice action-estimates of anticipated monthly income
from new school held speculative and without reasonable basis where
offered without reference to operational history or standard method
for estimations); Petty v. Weyerhaeuser Co., 288 S.C. 349, 342 S.E.2d 611
(S.C. Ct. App. 1986) (tort action-three month period business operated
prior to debilitating effect of tort afforded basis for fairly and
reasonably approximating lost profits). These cases have so eroded the
new business rule as an absolute bar to recovery of lost profits that the
rigid Standard Supply Co. rule is no longer good law.
2. A Multi-Jurisdictional Trend

92

[11] South Carolina has not been alone in developing its evidentiary
view of the new business rule. Numerous authorities and
commentators have tracked a similar trend nationwide: “Courts are
now taking the position that the distinction between established
businesses and new ones is a distinction that goes to the weight of the
evidence and not a rule that automatically precludes recovery of
profits by a new business.” D. DOBBS, HANDBOOK ON THE LAW OF
REMEDIES, § 3.3, at 155 (1973). See R. DUNN, RECOVERY OF
DAMAGES FOR LOST PROFITS, § 4.2 (3d ed. 1987) (trend of modern
cases plainly toward replacing old rule of law with rule of evidencereasonable certainty); Comment, Remedies-Lost Profits as Contract
Damages for an Unestablished Business: The New Business Rule Becomes
Outdated, 56 N.C.L. REV. 693, 695 (1978) (noting “increasing trend
either to create exceptions and mitigating sub-doctrines to the new
business rule or simply to recognize that its rationale is no longer
persuasive”); Note, The New Business Rule And The Denial Of Lost Profits,
48 OHIO ST. L.J. 855, 859 (1987) (clear and growing majority of courts
apply new business rule as rule delimiting sufficiency of evidence).
Moreover, application of the rule in this manner has been applauded
as fairer than mechanical application of the old rule. See D. DOBBS,
supra (as a matter of evidence, new business/established business
distinction makes sense; as a matter of setting an inflexible rule, it does
not); R. DUNN, supra, at 227 (no worthwhile end achieved “by
permitting one party to breach his contracts with impunity—giving
him an option, as it were—because the other party has not yet
commenced operation.”).
[12] In light of the facts before us, we find particularly persuasive
several cases involving lost profits flowing from breaches of contracts
to construct and/or lease buildings for the operation of new business
ventures. See, e.g., Chung v. Kaonohi Center Co., 618 P.2d 283 (Haw. 1980)
(rejecting per se nonrecoverability version of new business rule in
favor of “reasonable certainty” evidentiary standard; lost profits award
upheld for breach of contract to lease space for new restaurant); Welch
v. U.S. Bancorp Realty and Mortgage, 596 P.2d 947 (Or. 1979) (breach of
contract to advance funds for residential and commercial development
on land tract; “reasonable certainty” standard applied); Fera v. Village
Plaza, Inc., 242 N.W.2d 372 (Mich. 1976) (breach of lease of shopping
center space for new book store; per se rule of nonrecoverability
rejected in favor of broad jury discretion in lost profits
determinations); Smith Dev. Corp. v. Bilow Enterprises, Inc., 308 A.2d 477
(R.I. 1973) (tortious interference with contractual right to erect
“McDonald's” restaurant; “reasonable certainty” rule applied and per

93

se new business rule rejected); S. Jon Kreedman & Co. v. Meyer Bros.
Parking-Western Corp., 58 Cal.App.3d 173, 130 Cal.Rptr. 41 (1976)
(breach of contract to construct parking garage and lease it to
operator; “hard and fast” new business rule rejected in favor of
“reasonable certainty” test).
[13] We believe South Carolina should now unequivocally join those
jurisdictions applying the new business rule as a rule of evidentiary
sufficiency and not as an automatic preclusion to recovery of lost
profits by a new business or enterprise.
3. The Standard for Entitlement to Lost Profits
[14] The same standards that have for years governed lost profits
awards in South Carolina will apply with equal force to cases where
damages are sought for a new business or enterprise. First, profits
must have been prevented or lost “as a natural consequence of” the
breach of contract. South Carolina Finance Corp., supra, at 122, 113
S.E.2d at 335; Charles v. Texas Co., 18 S.E.2d 719, 729 (S.C. 1942) (lost
profits are proper elements of damages where they are “direct and
necessary result” of defendant's breach).
The second requirement is foreseeability; a breaching party is liable for
those damages, including lost profits, “which may reasonably be
supposed to have been within the contemplation of the parties at the
time the contract was made as a probable result of the breach of it.”
National Tire & Rubber Co. v. Hoover, 122 S.E. 858, 859 (S.C. 1924); see
also Traywick v. Southern Ry. Co., 50 S.E. 549 (S.C. 1905); Colvin v.
McCormick Cotton Oil Co., 44 S.E. 380 (S.C. 1902); Sitton v. MacDonald,
60 Am.Rep. 484 (S.C. 1885) (lost profits cases citing the “knowledge
of special circumstances” rule of Hadley v. Baxendale, 9 Ex. 341, 156
Eng. Rep. 154 (1854)).
[15] The crucial requirement in lost profits determinations is that they
be “established with reasonable certainty, for recovery cannot be had
for profits that are conjectural or speculative.” South Carolina Finance
Corp., supra, 113 S.E.2d at 336. “The proof must pass the realm of
conjecture, speculation, or opinion not founded on facts, and must
consist of actual facts from which a reasonably accurate conclusion
regarding the cause and the amount of the loss can be logically and
rationally drawn.” 22 Am. Jur. 2d Damages § 641 (1988).
[16] Numerous proof techniques have been discussed and accepted in
different factual scenarios. See, e.g., Upjohn v. Rachelle Laboratories, Inc.,
661 F.2d 1105, 1114 (6th Cir.1981) (proof of future lost profits based

94

on marketing forecasts by employees specializing in economic
forecasting); Petty v. Weyerhaeuser Co., supra (skating rink's projected
revenues compared to those of another arena in a nearby town); see
also RESTATEMENT (SECOND) OF CONTRACTS § 352, at 146 (1981)
(proof of lost profits “may be established with reasonable certainty
with the aid of expert testimony, economic and financial data, market
surveys and analyses, business records of similar enterprises, and the
like.”); Note, supra, 48 OHIO ST. L.J. at 872-3 (means of proving
prospective profits include (1) “yardstick” method of comparison with
profit performance of business similar in size, nature, and location; (2)
comparison with profit history of plaintiff's successor, where
applicable; (3) comparison of similar businesses owned by plaintiff
himself, and (4) use of economic and financial data and expert
testimony). While the factual contexts in which new business/lost
profits cases arise will undoubtedly vary, these methods of proof and
the “reasonable certainty” requirement bear an inherent flexibility
facilitating the just assessment of profits lost to a new business due to
contractual breach.
4. Application of the Standard to the Present Facts
[17] Applying this standard to the facts before us, we find that
Owner's proof failed to clear the “reasonable certainty” hurdle.
Owner's projections of the profits lost by the restaurant because of the
breach were based on nothing more than a sheet of paper reflecting
the gross profits the restaurant made in the first 11 months of
operation after construction was completed. These figures were not
supplemented with corresponding figures for overhead or operating
expenditures, but only with Owner's testimony that he “would expect
at least a third of that [gross figure] to be” net profit. Owner's
expectations, unsupported by any particular standard or fixed method
for establishing net profits, were wholly insufficient to provide the jury
with a basis for calculating profits lost with reasonable certainty. South
Carolina Finance Corp., supra; Mali v. Odom, supra.
[18] The trial judge erred in failing to rule that, as a matter of law,
Owner's proof was insufficient to merit submission to the jury. The
$14,000 award of lost profits must therefore be reversed.
C.
[19] Contractor's remaining exceptions are disposed of pursuant to
Supreme Court Rule 23. See Talley v. South Carolina Higher Education
Tuition Grants Committee, 347 S.E.2d 99 (S.C. 1986) (issue neither
presented to nor ruled upon by trial court not preserved for appeal);

95

Reid v. Hardware Mutual Insurance Co., 166 S.E.2d 317 (S.C. 1969)
(questions not raised by proper exception will not be considered);
Supreme Court Rule 8, § 3; Howell v. Pacific Columbia Mills, 354 S.E.2d
384 (S.C. 1987) (exceptions not argued in brief deemed abandoned on
appeal).
[20] Costs and attorneys' fees under Supreme Court Rule 38 shall be
assessed against appellant.
AFFIRMED IN PART; REVERSED IN PART.

3.3.1 Other Applications of the Certainty Limitation
The Drews court refers in paragraph 12 to another case involving delayed
construction. In Fera v. Village Plaza, the court awarded lost profits for the
plaintiffs’ “book and bottle shop” after hearing “days of testimony” about
projected revenues and costs from this new venture.
In contrast, courts have been reluctant to award lost profits damages when
a breach of contract causes the promisee to suffer a loss of good will with
current or prospective customers. Typical of these decisions is the
following:
Our research fails to reveal any judicial authority in
Pennsylvania which sustains, under the Sales Act, a
recovery for a loss of good will occasioned either by
non-delivery or by the delivery of defective goods.
As this Court stated in Michelin Tire Co. v. Schulz, 295
Pa. 140, 144: “so far as appears, the tires in question
were all used by defendant’s customers and paid for,
so he lost nothing thereon. What he claims is that,
because the tires were less durable than
recommended, he lost customers, which otherwise
he would have retained and whose business would
have netted him a profit…. This is entirely too
speculative and not the proper measure of damages.”
… We are in agreement with the statement of the
Court in Armstrong Rubber Co. v. Griffith, 43 F.2d 689,
691 (2d Cir.), that: “If the plaintiff here can recover
for loss of good will, it is difficult to see what limits
are to be set to the recovery of such damages in any
case where defective goods are sold (or where goods
are not delivered) and the vendee loses customers.
Indeed, if such were the holding, damages which the
parties never contemplated would seem to be
involved in every contract of sale.”

96

Harry Rubin & Sons v. Consolidated Pipe Co., 153 A.2d 472, 476-77 (Pa.
1959).
One unusual exception to this general rule is Redgrave v. Boston Symphony
Orchestra, 855 F.2d 888 (1st Cir. 1988). Vanessa Redgrave alleged that the
BSO wrongfully canceled her appearances with the orchestra after stories
appeared about her support for the Palestine Liberation Organization. She
sought damages for “a significant number of movie and theatre offers that
she would ordinarily have received [but that] were in fact not offered to her
as a result of BSO’s cancellation.” After reducing to $12,000 the jury’s
award of $100,000 in consequential damages, the court opined that:
a plaintiff may receive consequential damages if the
plaintiff proves with sufficient evidence that a breach
of contact proximately caused the loss of identifiable
professional opportunities. This type of claim is
sufficiently different from a nonspecific allegation of
damage to reputation that it appropriately falls
outside the general rule that reputation damages are
not an acceptable form of contract damage.

Id. at 894.
Finally, in Smith v. Penbridge Associates, 655 A.2d 1015 (Pa. Super. Ct. 1995),
the court confronted an unusual twist on the lost profit problem. A
Michigan emu farm sold two male emus to a Pennsylvania couple with a
guarantee that they were a “proven breeding pair.” The purchasers
discovered the farm’s mistake when the emus produced no eggs during the
ensuing breeding season. Despite the fact that emu farming was a new
business in Pennsylvania, the court granted plaintiffs’ claim for lost profits
damages based on the projected number of eggs that a breeding pair would
have produced.
3.3.2 Discussion of the Certainty Limitation
In Drews, what exactly was the proof of lost profits that the plaintiff
offered? How certain can you be in counseling a client about the recovery
of lost profits?
One might reasonably object that refusing to award uncertain future profits
on the ground that they are too speculative causes expectation damages to
be systematically under-compensatory. Consider, however, how awarding
lost profits from a business might over-compensate the plaintiff. How do
you suppose that those profits will be measured?

97

Will the court’s calculations take into account the cost of the capital that
plaintiff has invested in the business?
How about the risk of business failure and the difference between earning
profits over a period of years and receiving a lump sum damage award?

3.4 Introduction to Avoidability and Mitigation
We have encountered several times the so-called “mitigation principle”
which implies that damages for breach of contract exclude any loss that the
promisee could have reasonably avoided. One important consequence of
this rule is that the announcement of a breach of contract requires the
promisee to decide how to respond. She may seek substitute
performance—a covering transaction—or she may choose to delay
covering and take her chances in the evolving market for the originally
promised performance. Here is what the Restatement (Second) of
Contracts has to say on the subject:
§ 350. Avoidability as a Limitation on Damages
(1) Except as stated in Subsection (2), damages are not
recoverable for loss that the injured party could have
avoided without undue risk, burden or humiliation.
(2) The injured party is not precluded from recovery by the
rule stated in Subsection (1) to the extent that he has made
reasonable but unsuccessful efforts to avoid loss.
Comment:
a. Rationale. The rules stated in this Section reflect the
policy of encouraging the injured party to attempt to avoid
loss. The rule stated in Subsection (1) encourages him to
make such efforts as he can to avoid loss by barring him
from recovery for loss that he could have avoided if he
had done so. See Comment b. The exception stated in
Subsection (2) protects him if he has made actual efforts
by allowing him to recover, regardless of the rule stated in
Subsection (1), if his efforts prove to be unsuccessful. See
Comment h. See also Comment c to § 347.
b. Effect of failure to make efforts to mitigate damages. As a
general rule, a party cannot recover damages for loss that
he could have avoided by reasonable efforts. Once a party

98

has reason to know that performance by the other party
will not be forthcoming, he is ordinarily expected to stop
his own performance to avoid further expenditure.
Furthermore, he is expected to take such affirmative steps
as are appropriate in the circumstances to avoid loss by
making substitute arrangements or otherwise. It is
sometimes said that it is the “duty” of the aggrieved party
to mitigate damages, but this is misleading because he
incurs no liability for his failure to act. The amount of loss
that he could reasonably have avoided by stopping
performance, making substitute arrangements or otherwise
is simply subtracted from the amount that would otherwise
have been recoverable as damages.
c. Substitute transactions. When a party's breach consists of a
failure to deliver goods or furnish services, for example, it
is often possible for the injured party to secure similar
goods or services on the market. If a seller of goods
repudiates, the buyer can often buy similar goods
elsewhere. If an employee quits his job, the employer can
often find a suitable substitute. Similarly, when a party's
breach consists of a failure to receive goods or services, for
example, it is often possible for the aggrieved party to
dispose of the goods or services on the market. If a buyer
of goods repudiates, the seller can often sell the goods
elsewhere. If an employer fires his employee, the employee
can often find a suitable job elsewhere. In such cases as
these, the injured party is expected to make appropriate
efforts to avoid loss by arranging a substitute transaction.
If he does not do so, the amount of loss that he could
have avoided by doing so is subtracted in calculating his
damages. In the case of the sale of goods, this principle has
inspired the standard formulas under which a buyer's or
seller's damages are based on the difference between the
contract price and the market price on that market where
the injured party could have arranged a substitute
transaction for the purchase or sale of similar goods. See
Uniform Commercial Code §§ 2-708, 2-713. Similar rules
are applied to other contracts, such as contracts for the
sale of securities, where there is a well-established market
for the type of performance involved, but the principle
extends to other situations in which a substitute
transaction can be arranged, even if there is no well-

99

established market for the type of performance. However,
in those other situations, the burden is generally put on the
party in breach to show that a substitute transaction was
available, as is done in the case in which an employee has
been fired by his employer.
d. “Lost volume.” The mere fact that an injured party can
make arrangements for the disposition of the goods or
services that he was to supply under the contract does not
necessarily mean that by doing so he will avoid loss. If he
would have entered into both transactions but for the
breach, he has “lost volume” as a result of the breach. See
Comment f to § 347. In that case the second transaction is
not a “substitute” for the first one.
e. What is a “substitute.” Whether an available alternative
transaction is a suitable substitute depends on all the
circumstances, including the similarity of the performance
and the times and places that they would be rendered. If
discrepancies between the transactions can be adequately
compensated for in damages, the alternative transaction is
regarded as a substitute and such damages are awarded. If
the party in breach offers to perform the contract for a
different price, this may amount to a suitable alternative.
But this is not the case if the offer is conditioned on
surrender by the injured party of his claim for breach.
f. Time for arranging substitute transaction. The injured party is
expected to arrange a substitute transaction within a
reasonable time after he learns of the breach. He is
expected to do this even if the breach takes the form of an
anticipatory repudiation, since under the rule stated in
Subsection (2) he is then protected against the possibility
of a change in the market before the time for performance.
See Comment g. The injured party may, however, make
appropriate efforts to urge the repudiating party to
perform in spite of his repudiation or to retract his
repudiation, and these efforts will be taken into account in
determining what is a reasonable time. Although the
injured party is expected to arrange a substitute transaction
without unreasonable delay following the anticipatory
repudiation, the time for performance under the substitute

100

transaction will ordinarily be the same time as it would
have been under the original contract.
g. Efforts expected. In some situations, it is reasonable for the
injured party to rely on performance by the other party
even after breach. This may be true, for example, if the
breach is accompanied by assurances that performance will
be forthcoming. In such a situation the injured party is not
expected to arrange a substitute transaction although he
may be expected to take some steps to avoid loss due to a
delay in performance. Nor is it reasonable to expect him to
take steps to avoid loss if those steps may cause other
serious loss. He need not, for example, make other risky
contracts, incur unreasonable expense or inconvenience or
disrupt his business. In rare instances the appropriate
course may be to complete performance instead of
stopping. Finally the aggrieved party is not expected to put
himself in a position that will involve humiliation,
including embarrassment or loss of honor and respect.
h. Actual efforts to mitigate damages. Sometimes the injured
party makes efforts to avoid loss but fails to do so. The
rule stated in Subsection (2) protects the injured party in
that situation if the efforts were reasonable. If, for
example, a seller who is to manufacture goods for a buyer
decides, on repudiation by the buyer, “in the exercise of
reasonable commercial judgment for the purpose of
avoiding loss” to complete manufacture of the goods, he is
protected under Uniform Commercial Code § 2-704(2)
even if it later appears that he could have better avoided
loss by stopping manufacture. Similarly, if a buyer of
goods who decides, on repudiation by the seller, to
“‘cover' by making in good faith and without unreasonable
delay any reasonable purchase of or contract to purchase
goods in substitution for those due from the seller,” he is
protected under Uniform Commercial Code § 2-712. See
also Uniform Commercial Code § 2-706 for the seller's
comparable right of resale. The rule stated in Subsection
(2) reflects the policy underlying these Code provisions,
one encouraging the injured party to make reasonable
efforts to avoid loss by protecting him even when his
efforts fail. To this extent, his failure to avoid loss does not
have the effect stated in Subsection (1). Under the rule

101

stated in § 347, costs incurred in a reasonable but
unsuccessful effort to avoid loss are recoverable as
incidental losses. See Comment c to § 347.
The first of the mitigation cases below shows what can happen when the
promisor’s repudiation of the contract is ambiguous. In the second case,
the promisee must decide whether or not to accept an offer of substitute
performance from the breaching promisor.

3.5 Principal Case – Rockingham County v. Luten Bridge
Co.
Rockingham County v. Luten Bridge Co.
Circuit Court of Appeals, Fourth Circuit
35 F.2d 301 (1929)
PARKER, CIRCUIT JUDGE.
[1] This was an action at law instituted in the court below by the
Luten Bridge Company, as plaintiff, to recover [from] Rockingham
County, North Carolina, an amount alleged to be due under a
contract, but defendant contends that notice of cancellation was given
the bridge company before the erection of the bridge was commenced,
and that it is liable only for the damages which the company would
have sustained, if it had abandoned construction at that time. The
judge below refused to strike out an answer filed by certain members
of the board of commissioners of the county, admitting liability in
accordance with the prayer of the complaint, allowed this pleading to
be introduced in evidence as the answer of the county, excluded
evidence offered by the county in support of its contentions as to
notice of cancellation and damages, and instructed a verdict for
plaintiff for the full amount of its claim. From judgment on this
verdict the county has appealed.
[2] The facts out of which the case arises, as shown by the affidavits
and offers of proof appearing in the record, are as follows: On January
7, 1924, the board of commissioners of Rockingham County voted to
award to plaintiff a contract for the construction of the bridge in
controversy. Three of the five commissioners favored the awarding of
the contract and two opposed it. Much feeling was engendered over
the matter, with the result that on February 11, 1924, W. K. Pruitt, one
of the commissioners who had voted in the affirmative, sent his
resignation to the clerk of the superior court of the county. The clerk
received this resignation on the same day, and immediately accepted
same and noted his acceptance thereon. Later in the day, Pruitt called

102

him over the telephone and stated that he wished to withdraw the
resignation, and later sent him written notice to the same effect. The
clerk, however, paid no attention to the attempted withdrawal, and
proceeded on the next day to appoint one W. W. Hampton as a
member of the board to succeed him.
[3] After his resignation, Pruitt attended no further meetings of the
board, and did nothing further as a commissioner of the county.
Likewise Pratt and McCollum, the other two members of the board
who had voted with him in favor of the contract, attended no further
meetings. Hampton, on the other hand, took the oath of office
immediately upon his appointment and entered upon the discharge of
the duties of a commissioner. He met regularly with the two remaining
members of the board, Martin and Barber, in the courthouse at the
county seat, and with them attended to all of the business of the
county. Between the 12th of February and the first Monday in
December following, these three attended, in all, 25 meetings of the
board.
[4] At one of these meetings, a regularly advertised called meeting
held on February 21st, a resolution was unanimously adopted
declaring that the contract for the building of the bridge was not legal
and valid, and directing the clerk of the board to notify plaintiff that it
refused to recognize same as a valid contract, and that plaintiff should
proceed no further thereunder. This resolution also rescinded action
of the board theretofore taken looking to the construction of a hardsurfaced road, in which the bridge was to be a mere connecting link.
The clerk duly sent a certified copy of this resolution to plaintiff.
[5] At the regular monthly meeting of the board on March 3d, a
resolution was passed directing that plaintiff be notified that any work
done on the bridge would be done by it at its own risk and hazard,
that the board was of the opinion that the contract for the
construction of the bridge was not valid and legal, and that, even if the
board were mistaken as to this, it did not desire to construct the
bridge, and would contest payment for same if constructed. A copy of
this resolution was also sent to plaintiff. At the regular monthly
meeting on April 7th, a resolution was passed, reciting that the board
had been informed that one of its members was privately insisting that
the bridge be constructed. It repudiated this action on the part of the
member and gave notice that it would not be recognized. At the
September meeting, a resolution was passed to the effect that the
board would pay no bills presented by plaintiff or anyone connected
with the bridge. At the time of the passage of the first resolution, very

103

little work toward the construction of the bridge had been done, it
being estimated that the total cost of labor done and material on the
ground was around $1,900; but, notwithstanding the repudiation of
the contract by the county, the bridge company continued with the
work of construction.
[6] On November 24, 1924, plaintiff instituted this action against
Rockingham County, and against Pruitt, Pratt, McCollum, Martin, and
Barber, as constituting its board of commissioners. Complaint was
filed, setting forth the execution of the contract and the doing of work
by plaintiff thereunder, and alleging that for work done up until
November 3, 1924, the county was indebted in the sum of $18,301.07.
On November 27th, three days after the filing of the complaint, and
only three days before the expiration of the term of office of the
members of the old board of commissioners, Pruitt, Pratt, and
McCollum met with an attorney at the county seat, and, without notice
to or consultation with the other members of the board, so far as
appears, had the attorney prepare for them an answer admitting the
allegations of the complaint. This answer, which was filed in the cause
on the following day, did not purport to be an answer of the county,
or of its board of commissioners, but of the three commissioners
named.
[7] On December 1, 1924, the newly elected board of commissioners
held its first meeting and employed attorneys to defend the action
which had been instituted by plaintiff against the county. These
attorneys immediately moved to strike out the answer which had been
filed by Pruitt, Pratt, and McCollum, and entered into an agreement
with opposing counsel that the county should have 30 days from the
action of the court on the motion within which to file answer. The
court denied the motion on June 2, 1927, and held the answer filed by
Pruitt, Pratt, and McCollum to be the answer of the county. An order
was then entered allowing the county until August 1st to file answer,
pursuant to stipulation, within which time the answer of the county
was filed. This answer denied that the contract sued on was legal or
binding, and for a further defense set forth the resolutions of the
commissioners with regard to the building of the bridge, to which we
have referred, and their communication to plaintiff. A reply was filed
to this, and the case finally came to trial.
[8] At the trial, plaintiff, over the objection of the county, was
allowed to introduce in evidence, the answer filed by Pruitt, Pratt, and
McCollum, the contract was introduced, and proof was made of the
value under the terms of the contract of the work done up to

104

November 3, 1924. The county elicited on cross-examination proof as
to the state of the work at the time of the passage of the resolutions to
which we have referred. It then offered these resolutions in evidence,
together with evidence as to the resignation of Pruitt, the acceptance
of his resignation, and the appointment of Hampton; but all of this
evidence was excluded, and the jury was instructed to return a verdict
for plaintiff for the full amount of its claim. The county preserved
exceptions to the rulings which were adverse to it, and contends that
there was error on the part of the judge below in denying the motion
to strike out the answer filed by Pruitt, Pratt, and McCollum; in
allowing same to be introduced in evidence; in excluding the evidence
offered of the resignation of Pruitt, the acceptance of his resignation,
and the appointment of Hampton, and of the resolutions attempting
to cancel the contract and the notices sent plaintiff pursuant thereto;
and in directing a verdict for plaintiff in accordance with its claim.

[From this point in the opinion through paragraph 21, the court embarks
on a complex analysis of who had authority to act on behalf of the County.
The discussion is included here to give you a sense of the uncertainty
surrounding this crucial legal issue. However, the rules for identifying “de
facto officers” are not central to our study of avoidability doctrine and you
may therefore wish to skim this portion of the court’s opinion.]
[9] As the county now admits the execution and validity of the
contract, and the breach on its part, the ultimate question in the case is
one as to the measure of plaintiff's recovery, and the exceptions must
be considered with this in mind. Upon these exceptions, three
principal questions arise for our consideration, viz.‘ (1) Whether the
answer filed by Pruitt, Pratt, and McCollum was the answer of the
county. If it was, the lower court properly refused to strike it out, and
properly admitted it in evidence. (2) Whether, in the light of the
evidence offered and excluded, the resolutions to which we have
referred, and the notices sent pursuant thereto, are to be deemed
action on the part of the county. If they are not, the county has
nothing upon which to base its position as to minimizing damages,
and the evidence offered was properly excluded. And (3) whether
plaintiff, if the notices are to be deemed action by the county, can
recover under the contract for work done after they were received, or
is limited to the recovery of damages for breach of contract as of that
date.
[10] With regard to the first question the learned District Judge held
that the answer of Pruitt, Pratt, and McCollum was the answer of the

105

county, but we think that this holding was based upon an erroneous
view of the law. It appears, without contradiction, not only that their
answer purports to have been filed by them individually, and not in
behalf of the county or of the board of commissioners, but also that it
was not authorized by the board of commissioners, acting as a board
at a meeting regularly held. It appears that Pruitt, Pratt, and McCollum
merely met at the county seat to consider the filing of an answer to
plaintiff's complaint. This was not a “regular” meeting of the board,
held on the first Mondays of December and June. It was not a
“special” meeting held on the first Monday in some other month. It
was not shown to be a meeting “called” by the chairman upon the
written request of a member of the board, and advertised at the
courthouse door and in a newspaper as provided by statute. Consol.
St. Sec. 1296. And between the filing of the complaint and the filing of
the answer there was not sufficient time for the advertising of a called
meeting of the board. Consequently any action taken by Pruitt, Pratt,
and McCollum with regard to filing an answer was not taken at a
meeting of the board in legal session. Even if it be assumed that Pruitt
continued to be a member of the board, and that he, Pratt, and
McCollum constituted a majority thereof, nevertheless such majority
could bind the county only by action taken at a meeting regularly held.
The rule is well settled that the governing board of a county can act
only as a body and when in legal session as such. 7 R.C.L. 941; 15 C.J.
460 and cases cited; O'Neal v. Wake County, 196 N.C. 184, 145 S.E. 28,
29; Grand Island & N.W.R. Co. v. Baker, 6 Wyo. 369, 45 P. 494, 34
L.R.A. 835, 71 Am. St. Rep. 926; Board of Com'rs of Jasper County v.
Allman, 142 Ind. 573, 42 N.E. 206, 39 L.R.A. 58, 68; Campbell County v.
Howard & Lee, 133 Va. 19, 112 S.E. 876; Paola, etc. R. Co. v. Anderson
County Com'rs, 16 Kan. 302, 310. As said in the case last cited:
“…Commissioners casually meeting have no power to act for the
county. There must be a session of the 'board.’ This single entity, the
'board,' alone can by its action bind the county. And it exists only
when legally convened.”
[11] The North Carolina case of Cleveland Cotton-Mills v. Commissioners,
108 N.C. 678, 13 S.E. 271, 274, established the rule in North Carolina.
That case arose under the old law, which required bridge contracts
involving more than $500 to be made with the concurrence of a
majority of the justices of the peace of the county. Such a contract was
made, and a majority of the justices of the county, who were not then
in session, executed a written instrument approving it. Afterwards, at a
regular meeting of the justices with the board of commissioners, a
majority of the quorum of the justices present voted to ratify the

106

contract. A divided court held that this ratification at the regular
meeting was sufficient, although the majority of the quorum which
voted for ratification was less than a majority of all of the justices of
the county; but all of the members of the court agreed that the
execution of the instrument by a majority of the justices when not in
session was without effect. As to this, it was said in the majority
opinion:
We attach no importance to the paper signed by an
actual majority of the whole number of justices of
the peace of the county. The action contemplated by
the law was that of the justices of the peace in a
lawfully constituted meeting as a body, as in cases
where the validity of an agreement made by the
governing officials of any other corporation is drawn
in question. Duke v. Markham, 105 N.C. 131, 10 S.E.
1017 (18 Am. St. Rep. 889).
[12] It will be seen that the court applied to this case, where the
validity of the action of the governing officials of a public corporation
was drawn in question, the rule laid down in Duke v. Markham, which
is, of course, the well-settled rule in the case of private corporation,
viz. that such officials can exercise their powers as members of the
governing board only at a meeting regularly held. See, also, First
National Bank v. Warlick, 125 N.C. 593, 34 S.E. 687; Everett v. Staton,
192 N.C. 216, 134 S.E. 492.
[13] But in the case of O'Neal v. Wake County, supra, decided in 1928,
the Supreme Court of North Carolina set at rest any doubt which may
have existed in that state as to the question here involved. In holding
that the county could not be held liable on a contract made at a joint
meeting of the county commissioners, the county board of education,
and a representative of the insurance department, the court said:
A county makes its contracts through the agency of
its board of commissioners; but to make a contract
which shall be binding upon the county the board
must act as a body convened in legal session, regular,
adjourned, or special. A contract made by members
composing the board when acting in their individual
and not in their corporate capacity while assembled
in a lawful meeting is not the contract of the county.
As a rule authorized meetings are prerequisite to
corporate action based upon deliberate conference
and intelligent discussion of proposed measures. 7
R.C.L. 941; 15 C.J. 460; 43 C.J. 497; P.&F.R. Ry. Co.

107

v. Com'rs of Anderson County, 16 Kan. 302; Kirkland v.
State, 86 Fla. 84, 97 So. 502. The principle applies to
corporations generally, and by the express terms of
our statute, as stated above, every county is a
corporate body.
[14] We think, therefore, that Pruitt, Pratt, and McCollum, even if they
constituted a majority of the board of commissioners, did not bind the
county by their action in filing an answer admitting its liability, where
no meeting of the board of commissioners was held according to law,
and where, so far as appears, the other commissioners were not even
notified of what was being attempted. It is unthinkable that the county
should be held bound by such action, especially where the
commissioners attempting to bind it had taken no part in its
government for nearly 10 months, and where the answer filed did not
defend it in any particular, but, on the contrary, asserted its liability. If,
therefore, the answer be considered as an attempt to answer on behalf
of the county, it must be stricken out, because not authorized by its
governing board; if considered as to the answer of Pruitt, Pratt, and
McCollum individually, it must go out because, having been sued in
their official capacity, they had no right to answer individually. And, of
course, not having been authorized by the county, the answer was not
admissible as evidence against it on the trial of the cause.
[15] Coming to the second inquiry—i.e., whether the resolutions to
which we have referred and the notices sent pursuant thereto are to be
deemed the action of the county, and hence admissible in evidence on
the question of damages— it is to be observed that, along with the
evidence of the resolutions and notices, the county offered evidence to
the effect that Pruitt's resignation had been accepted before he
attempted to withdraw same, and that thereafter Hampton was
appointed, took the oath of office, entered upon the discharge of the
duties of the office, and with Martin and Barber transacted the
business of the board of commissioners until the coming into office of
the new board. We think that this evidence, if true, shows (1) that
Hampton, upon his appointment and qualification, became a member
of the board in place of Pruitt, and that he, Martin, and Barber
constituted a quorum for the transaction of its business; and (2) that,
even if this were not true, Hampton was a de factor commissioner,
and that his presence at meetings of the board with that of the other
two commissioners was sufficient to constitute a quorum, so as to give
validity to its proceedings.

108

[16] The North Carolina statutes make no provision for resignations
by members of the boards of county commissioners. A public officer,
however, has at common law the right to resign his office, provided
his resignation is accepted by the proper authority. Hoke v. Henderson,
15 N.C. 1, 25 Am.Dec. 677; U.S. v. Wright, Fed. Cas. No. 16,775; Rowe
v. Tuck, 149 Ga. 88, 99 S.E. 303, 5 A.L.R. 113; Van Orsdall v. Hazard, 3
Hill (N.Y.) 243; Philadelphia v. Marcer, 8 Phila. (Pa.) 319; Gates v.
Delaware County, 12 Iowa, 405; 22 R.C.L. 556, 557; note, 19 A.L.R. 39,
and cases there cited. And, in the absence of statute regulating the
matter, his resignation should be tendered to the tribunal or officer
having power to appoint his successor. 22 R.C.L. 558; State v. Popejoy,
165 Ind. 177, 74 N.E. 994, 6 Ann.Cas. 687, and note; State ex rel. Conley
v. Thompson, 100 W.Va. 253, 130 S.E. 456; State v. Huff, 172 Ind. 1, 87
N.E. 141, 139 Am. St. Rep. 355; State v. Augustine, 113 Mo. 21, 20 S.W.
651, 35 Am. St. Rep. 696. In the case last cited it is said:
It is well-established law that, in the absence of
express statutory enactment, the authority to accept
the resignation of a public officer rests with the
power to appoint a successor to fill the vacancy. The
right to accept a resignation is said to be incidental
to the power of appointment. 1 Dillon on Municipal
Corporations (3d Ed.) § 224; Mechem on Public
Offices, Sec. 413; Van Orsdall v. Hazard, 3 Hill (N.Y.)
243; State v. Boecker, 56 Mo. 17.
In North Carolina, the officer having power to appoint the successor
of a member of the board of county commissioners is the clerk of the
superior court of the county. Consolidated Statutes of North Carolina,
Sec. 1294. It is clear, therefore, that, when Pruitt tendered his
resignation to the clerk of the superior court, he tendered it to the
proper authority.
[17] The mere filing of the resignation with the clerk of the superior
court did not of itself vacate the office of Pruitt, it was necessary that
his resignation be accepted. Hoke v. Henderson, supra; Edwards v. U.S.,
103 U.S. 471. But, after its acceptance, he had no power to withdraw
it. Mimmack v. U.S., 97 U.S. 426; Murray v. State, 115 Tenn. 303, 89
S.W. 101, 5 Ann.Cas. 687, and note; State v. Augustine, supra; Gates v.
Delaware County, supra; 22 R.C.L. 559. If, as the offer of proof seems to
indicate, the resignation of Pruitt was accepted by the clerk prior to his
attempt to withdraw it, the appointment of Hampton was
unquestionably valid, and the latter, with Martin and Barber,
constituted a quorum of the board of commissioners, with the result

109

that action taken by them in meetings of the board regularly held was
action by the county.
[18] But, irrespective of the validity of Hampton's appointment, we
think that he must be treated as a de facto officer, and that the action
taken by him, Martin, and Barber in meetings regularly held is binding
upon the county and upon those dealing with it. Hampton was
appointed by the lawful appointing power. He took the oath of office
and entered upon the discharge of the duties of a commissioner. The
only government which the county had for a period of nearly 10
months was that which he and his associates, Martin and Barber,
administered. If their action respecting this contract is to be ignored,
then, for the same reason, their tax levy for the year must be treated as
void, and the many transactions carried through at their 25 meetings,
which were not attended by Pruitt, Pratt, or McCollum, must be set
aside. This cannot be the law. It ought not be the law anywhere; it
certainly is not the law in North Carolina. Section 3204 of the
Consolidated Statutes provides:
3204. Persons admitted to office deemed to hold
lawfully. Any person who shall, by the proper
authority, be admitted and sworn into any office,
shall be held, deemed, and taken, by force of such
admission, to be rightfully in such office until, by
judicial sentence, upon a proper proceeding, he shall
be ousted therefrom, or his admission thereto be, in
due course of law, declared void.
[19] In the case of State v. Lewis, 107 N.C. 967, 12 S.E. 457, 458, 13
S.E. 247, 11 L.R.A. 105, the court quotes with approval the widely
accepted definition and classification of de facto officers by Chief
Justice Butler in the case of State v. Carroll, 38 Conn. 449, 9 Am. Rep.
409, as follows:
An officer de facto is one whose acts, though not
those of a lawful officer, the law, upon principles of
policy and justice, will hold valid so far as they
involve the interests of the public and third persons,
where the duties of the office were exercised—First,
without a known appointment or election, but under
such circumstances of reputation or acquiescence as
were calculated to induce people, without inquiry, to
submit to or invoke his action, supposing him to be
the officer he assumed to be; second, under color of
a known and valid appointment or election, but
where the officer failed to conform to some

110

precedent requirement or condition, as to take an
oath, give a bond, or the like; third, under color of a
known election or appointment, void because there
was a want of power in the electing or appointing
body, or by reason of some defect or irregularity in
its exercise, such ineligibility, want of power, or
defect being unknown to the public; fourth, under
color of an election or appointment by or pursuant
to a public unconstitutional law before the same is
adjudged to be such.
[20] It is clear that, if the appointment of Hampton be considered
invalid, the case falls under the third class in the above classification;
for Hampton was discharging the duties of a county commissioner
under color of a known appointment, the invalidity of which, if
invalid, arose from a want of power or irregularity unknown to the
public. Other North Carolina cases supporting this conclusion are
Burke v. Elliott, 26 N.C. 355, 42 Am.Dec. 142; Burton v. Patton, 47 N.C.
124, 62 Am.Dec. 194; Norfleet v. Staton, 73 N.C. 546, 21 Am.Rep. 479;
Markham v. Simpson, 175 N.C. 135, 95 S.E. 106; State v. Harden, 177
N.C. 580, 98 S.E. 782; 22 R.C.L. 596, 597. This is not a case like Baker
v. Hobgood, 126 N.C. 149, 35 S.E. 253, where there were rival boards,
both attempting to discharge the duties of office; for, upon the
appointment of Hampton, Pruitt attended no further meetings and left
him in the unchallenged possession of the office.
[21] The rule is well settled in North Carolina, as it is elsewhere, that
the acts of a de facto officer will be held valid in respect to the public
whom he represents and to third persons with whom he deals
officially, notwithstanding there was a want of power to appoint him
in the person or body which professed to do so. Norfleet v. Staton, supra;
Markham v. Simpson, supra; 22 R.C.L. 601, 602, and cases cited.

[From this point to the end of the opinion, the court returns to the issues
that are central to our discussion of mitigation and the avoidability
doctrine.]
[22] Coming, then, to the third question—i.e., as to the measure of
plaintiff's recovery—we do not think that, after the county had given
notice, while the contract was still executory, that it did not desire the
bridge built and would not pay for it, plaintiff could proceed to build it
and recover the contract price. It is true that the county had no right
to rescind the contract, and the notice given plaintiff amounted to a
breach on its part; but, after plaintiff had received notice of the
breach, it was its duty to do nothing to increase the damages flowing

111

therefrom. If A enters into a binding contract to build a house for B,
B, of course, has no right to rescind the contract without A's consent.
But if, before the house is built, he decides that he does not want it,
and notifies A to that effect, A has no right to proceed with the
building and thus pile up damages. His remedy is to treat the contract
as broken when he receives the notice, and sue for the recovery of
such damages, as he may have sustained from the breach, including
any profit which he would have realized upon performance, as well as
any other losses which may have resulted to him. In the case at bar,
the county decided not to build the road of which the bridge was to be
a part, and did not build it. The bridge, built in the midst of the forest,
is of no value to the county because of this change of circumstances.
When, therefore, the county gave notice to the plaintiff that it would
not proceed with the project, plaintiff should have desisted from
further work. It had no right thus to pile up damages by proceeding
with the erection of a useless bridge.
[23] The contrary view was expressed by Lord Cockburn in Frost v.
Knight, L.R. 7 Ex. 111, but, as pointed out by Prof. Williston
(WILLISTON ON CONTRACTS, vol. 3, p. 2347), it is not in harmony
with the decisions in this country. The American rule and the reasons
supporting it are well stated by Prof. Williston as follows:
There is a line of cases running back to 1845 which
holds that, after an absolute repudiation or refusal to
perform by one party to a contract, the other party
cannot continue to perform and recover damages
based on full performance. This rule is only a
particular application of the general rule of damages
that a plaintiff cannot hold a defendant liable for
damages which need not have been incurred; or, as it
is often stated, the plaintiff must, so far as he can
without loss to himself, mitigate the damages caused
by the defendant's wrongful act. The application of
this rule to the matter in question is obvious. If a
man engages to have work done, and afterwards
repudiates his contract before the work has been
begun or when it has been only partially done, it is
inflicting damage on the defendant without benefit
to the plaintiff to allow the latter to insist on
proceeding with the contract. The work may be
useless to the defendant, and yet he would be forced
to pay the full contract price. On the other hand, the
plaintiff is interested only in the profit he will make

112

out of the contract. If he receives this it is equally
advantageous for him to use his time otherwise.
[24] The leading case on the subject in this country is the New York
case of Clark v. Marsiglia, 1 Denio (N.Y.) 317, 43 Am.Dec. 670. In that
case defendant had employed plaintiff to paint certain pictures for
him, but countermanded the order before the work was finished.
Plaintiff, however, went on and completed the work and sued for the
contract price. In reversing a judgment for plaintiff, the court said:
The plaintiff was allowed to recover as though there
had been no countermand of the order; and in this
the court erred. The defendant, by requiring the
plaintiff to stop work upon the paintings, violated
his contract, and thereby incurred a liability to pay
such damages as the plaintiff should sustain. Such
damages would include a recompense for the labor
done and materials used, and such further sum in
damages as might, upon legal principles, be assessed
for the breach of the contract; but the plaintiff had
no right, by obstinately persisting in the work, to
make the penalty upon the defendant greater than it
would otherwise have been.
And the rule as established by the great weight of authority in America
is summed up in the following statement in 6 R.C.L. 1029, which is
quoted with approval by the Supreme Court of North Carolina in the
recent case of Novelty Advertising Co. v. Farmers' Mut. Tobacco Warehouse
Co., 186 N.C. 197, 119 S.E. 196, 198:
While a contract is executory a party has the power
to stop performance on the other side by an explicit
direction to that effect, subjecting himself to such
damages as will compensate the other party for being
stopped in the performance on his part at that stage
in the execution of the contract. The party thus
forbidden cannot afterwards go on and thereby
increase the damages, and then recover such
damages from the other party. The legal right of
either party to violate, abandon, or renounce his
contract, on the usual terms of compensation to the
other for the damages which the law recognizes and
allows, subject to the jurisdiction of equity to decree
specific performance in proper cases, is universally
recognized and acted upon.

113

This is in accord with the earlier North Carolina decision of Heiser v.
Mears, 120 N.C. 443, 27 S.E. 117, in which it was held that, where a
buyer countermands his order for goods to be manufactured for him
under as executory contract, before the work is completed, it is notice
to the seller that he elects to rescind his contract and submit to the
legal measure of damages, and that in such case the seller cannot
complete the goods and recover the contract price. See, also, Kingman
& Co. v. Western Mfg. Co. (C.C.A. 8th) 92 F. 486; Davis v. Bronson, 2
N.D. 300, 50 N.W. 836, 16 L.R.A. 655 and note, 33 Am.St.Rep. 783,
and note; Richards v. Manitowoc & Northern Traction Co., 140 Wis. 85,
121 N.W. 837, 133 Am.St.Rep. 1063.
[25] We have carefully considered the cases of Roehm v. Horst, 178 U.S.
1, Roller v. George H. Leonard & Co. (C.C.A. 4th) 229 F. 607, and McCoy
v. Justices of Harnett County, 53 N.C. 272, upon which plaintiff relies; but
we do not think that they are at all in point. Roehm v. Horst merely
follows the rule of Hockster v. DeLaTour, 2 El.& Bl. 678, to the effect
that where one party to any executory contract refuses to perform in
advance of the time fixed for performance, the other party, without
waiting for the time of performance, may sue at once for damages
occasioned by the breach. The same rule is followed in Roller v.
Leonard. In McCoy v. Justices of Harnett County the decision was that
mandamus to require the justices of a county to pay for a jail would be
denied, where it appeared that the contractor in building same
departed from the plans and specifications. In the opinions in all of
these some language was used which lends support to plaintiff's
position, but in none of them was the point involved which is
involved here, viz. whether, in application of the rule which requires
that the party to a contract who is not in default do nothing to
aggravate the damages arising from breach, he should not desist from
performance of an executory contract for the erection of a structure
when notified of the other party's repudiation, instead of piling up
damages by proceeding with the work. As stated above, we think that
reason and authority require that this question be answered in the
affirmative. It follows that there was error in directing a verdict for
plaintiff for the full amount of its claim. The measure of plaintiff's
damage, upon its appearing that notice was duly given not to build the
bridge, is an amount sufficient to compensate plaintiff for labor and
materials expended and expense incurred in the part performance of
the contract, prior to its repudiation, plus the profit which would have
been realized if it had been carried out in accordance with its terms.
See Novelty Advertising Co. v. Farmers' Mut. Tobacco Warehouse Co., supra.

114

[26] Our conclusion, on the whole case, is that there was error in
failing to strike out the answer of Pruitt, Pratt, and McCollum, and in
admitting same as evidence against the county, in excluding the
testimony offered by the county to which we have referred, and in
directing a verdict for plaintiff. The judgment below will accordingly
be reversed, and the case remanded for a new trial.
Reversed.

3.5.1 Discussion of Rockingham County v. Luten Bridge Co.
Imagine that you are counsel to the Luten Bridge Company. What should
your client do in response to the first notice from the Rockingham County
board of commissioners repudiating the bridge construction contract?
The court says that the Luten Bridge Company should have ceased work on
the bridge after receiving notice of repudiation. Are there any risks or
expenses associated with ceasing construction? Does the Luten Bridge
Company have any alternatives other than continuing or terminating the
project?

3 Cal. 3d 176, 474 P.2d 689, 89 Cal. Rptr. 737 (1970)
BURKE, J.
[1] Defendant Twentieth Century-Fox Film Corporation appeals
from a summary judgment granting to plaintiff the recovery of agreed
compensation under a written contract for her services as an actress in
a motion picture. As will appear, we have concluded that the trial
court correctly ruled in plaintiff's favor and that the judgment should
be affirmed.
[2] Plaintiff [Shirley MacLaine] is well known as an actress, and in the
contract between plaintiff and defendant is sometimes referred to as
the “Artist.” Under the contract, dated August 6, 1965, plaintiff was to
play the female lead in defendant's contemplated production of a
motion picture entitled “Bloomer Girl.” The contract provided that
defendant would pay plaintiff a minimum “guaranteed compensation”
of $53,571.42 per week for 14 weeks commencing May 23, 1966, for a
total of $750,000. Prior to May 1966 defendant decided not to
produce the picture and by a letter dated April 4, 1966, it notified

115

plaintiff of that decision and that it would not “comply with our
obligations to you under” the written contract.
[3] By the same letter and with the professed purpose “to avoid any
damage to you,” defendant instead offered to employ plaintiff as the
leading actress in another film tentatively entitled “Big Country, Big
Man” (hereinafter, “Big Country”). The compensation offered was
identical, as were 31 of the 34 numbered provisions or articles of the
original contract.xxiv Unlike “Bloomer Girl,” however, which was to
have been a musical production, “Big Country” was a dramatic
“western type” movie. “Bloomer Girl” was to have been filmed in
California; “Big Country” was to be produced in Australia. Also,
certain terms in the proffered contract varied from those of the
original.xxv Plaintiff was given one week within which to accept; she
did not and the offer lapsed. Plaintiff then commenced this action
seeking recovery of the agreed guaranteed compensation.
[4] Defendant's letter of April 4 to plaintiff, which contained both
defendant's notice of breach of the “Bloomer Girl” contract and offer
of the lead in “Big Country,” eliminated or impaired each of those
rights. It read in part as follows: “The terms and conditions of our
offer of employment are identical to those set forth in the
'BLOOMER GIRL' Agreement, Articles 1 through 34 and Exhibit A
to the Agreement, except as follows:
1. Article 31 of said Agreement will not be included
in any contract of employment regarding 'BIG
COUNTRY, BIG MAN' as it is not a musical and it
thus will not need a dance director.
2. In the 'BLOOMER GIRL' agreement, in Articles
29 and 32, you were given certain director and
screenplay approvals and you had preapproved
certain matters. Since there simply is insufficient
time to negotiate with you regarding your choice of
director and regarding the screenplay and since you
already expressed an interest in performing the role
in 'BIG COUNTRY, BIG MAN,' we must exclude
from our offer of employment in 'BIG COUNTRY,
BIG MAN' any approval rights as are contained in
said Articles 29 and 32; however, we shall consult
with you respecting the director to be selected to
direct the photoplay and will further consult with
you with respect to the screenplay and any revisions
or changes therein, provided, however, that if we fail
to agree ... the decision of ... [defendant] with respect

116

to the selection of a director and to revisions and
changes in the said screenplay shall be binding upon
the parties to said agreement.
[5] The complaint sets forth two causes of action. The first is for
money due under the contract; the second, based upon the same
allegations as the first, is for damages resulting from defendant's
breach of contract. Defendant in its answer admits the existence and
validity of the contract, that plaintiff complied with all the conditions,
covenants and promises and stood ready to complete the
performance, and that defendant breached and “anticipatorily
repudiated” the contract. It denies, however, that any money is due to
plaintiff either under the contract or as a result of its breach, and
pleads as an affirmative defense to both causes of action plaintiff's
allegedly deliberate failure to mitigate damages, asserting that she
unreasonably refused to accept its offer of the leading role in “Big
Country.”
[6] Plaintiff moved for summary judgment under Code of Civil
Procedure section 437c, the motion was granted, and summary
judgment for $750,000 plus interest was entered in plaintiff's favor.
This appeal by defendant followed.
[7] The familiar rules are that the matter to be determined by the trial
court on a motion for summary judgment is whether facts have been
presented which give rise to a triable factual issue. The court may not
pass upon the issue itself. Summary judgment is proper only if the
affidavits or declarationsxxvi in support of the moving party would be
sufficient to sustain a judgment in his favor and his opponent does not
by affidavit show facts sufficient to present a triable issue of fact. The
affidavits of the moving party are strictly construed, and doubts as to
the propriety of summary judgment should be resolved against
granting the motion. Such summary procedure is drastic and should be
used with caution so that it does not become a substitute for the open
trial method of determining facts. The moving party cannot depend
upon allegations in his own pleadings to cure deficient affidavits, nor
can his adversary rely upon his own pleadings in lieu or in support of
affidavits in opposition to a motion; however, a party can rely on his
adversary's pleadings to establish facts not contained in his own
affidavits. (Slobojan v. Western Travelers Life Ins. Co. (1969) 70 Cal.2d 432,
436-437 [74 Cal.Rptr. 895, 450 P.2d 271]; and cases cited.) Also, the
court may consider facts stipulated to by the parties and facts which
are properly the subject of judicial notice. (Ahmanson Bank & Trust Co.
v. Tepper (1969) 269 Cal.App.2d 333, 342 [74 Cal.Rptr. 774]; Martin v.

117

General Finance Co. (1966) 239 Cal. App.2d 438, 442 [48 Cal.Rptr. 773];
Goldstein v. Hoffman (1963) 213 Cal.App.2d 803, 814 [29 Cal.Rptr. 334];
Thomson v. Honer (1960) 179 Cal.App.2d 197, 203 [3 Cal.Rptr. 791].)
[8] As stated, defendant's sole defense to this action which resulted
from its deliberate breach of contract is that in rejecting defendant's
substitute offer of employment plaintiff unreasonably refused to
mitigate damages.
[9] The general rule is that the measure of recovery by a wrongfully
discharged employee is the amount of salary agreed upon for the
period of service, less the amount which the employer affirmatively
proves the employee has earned or with reasonable effort might have
earned from other employment. (W. F. Boardman Co. v. Petch (1921)
186 Cal. 476, 484 [199 P. 1047]; De Angeles v. Roos Bros., Inc. (1966) 244
Cal.App.2d 434, 441-442 [52 Cal.Rptr. 783]; de la Falaise v. GaumontBritish Picture Corp. (1940) 39 Cal.App.2d 461, 469 [103 P.2d 447], and
cases cited; see also Wise v. Southern Pac. Co. (1970) 1 Cal.3d 600, 607608 [83 Cal. Rptr. 202, 463 P.2d 426].)xxvii However, before projected
earnings from other employment opportunities not sought or accepted
by the discharged employee can be applied in mitigation, the employer
must show that the other employment was comparable, or
substantially similar, to that of which the employee has been deprived;
the employee's rejection of or failure to seek other available
employment of a different or inferior kind may not be resorted to in
order to mitigate damages. (Gonzales v. Internat. Assn. of Machinists
(1963) 213 Cal.App.2d 817, 822-824 [29 Cal.Rptr. 190]; Harris v. Nat.
Union etc. Cooks, Stewards (1953) 116 Cal.App.2d 759, 761 [254 P.2d
673]; Crillo v. Curtola (1949) 91 Cal.App.2d 263, 275 [204 P.2d 941]; de
la Falaise v. Galumont-British Picture Corp., supra., 39 Cal.App.2d 461, 469;
Schiller v. Keuffel & Esser Co. (1963) 21 Wis.2d 545 [124 N.W.2d 646,
651]; 28 A.L.R. 736, 749; 22 Am.Jur.2d, Damages, §§ 71- 72, p. 106.)
[10] In the present case defendant has raised no issue of reasonableness of
efforts by plaintiff to obtain other employment; the sole issue is whether
plaintiff's refusal of defendant's substitute offer of “Big Country” may
be used in mitigation. Nor, if the “Big Country” offer was of
employment different or inferior when compared with the original
“Bloomer Girl” employment, is there an issue as to whether or not
plaintiff acted reasonably in refusing the substitute offer. Despite
defendant's arguments to the contrary, no case cited or which our
research has discovered holds or suggests that reasonableness is an
element of a wrongfully discharged employee's option to reject, or fail

118

to seek, different or inferior employment lest the possible earnings
therefrom be charged against him in mitigation of damages.xxviii
[11] In Harris v. Nat. Union etc. Cooks, Stewards, supra., 116 Cal. App. 2d
759, 761, the issues were stated to be, inter alia, whether comparable
employment was open to each plaintiff employee, and if so whether
each plaintiff made a reasonable effort to secure such employment. It
was held that the trial court properly sustained an objection to an offer
to prove a custom of accepting a job in a lower rank when work in the
higher rank was not available, as “The duty of mitigation of damages
... does not require the plaintiff 'to seek or to accept other employment
of a different or inferior kind.”' (P. 764 [5].) See also: Lewis v. Protective
Security Life Ins. Co. (1962) 208 Cal.App.2d 582, 584 [25 Cal.Rptr. 213]:

52 [48 A.L.R.2d 1285]; Chisholm v. Preferred Bankers' Life Assur. Co.
(1897) 112 Mich. 50 [70 N.W. 415]; each of which held that the
reasonableness of the employee's efforts, or his excuses for failure, to find
other similar employment was properly submitted to the jury as a
question of fact. NB: Chisholm additionally approved a jury instruction that
a substitute offer of the employer to work for a lesser compensation was
not to be considered in mitigation, as the employee was not required to
accept it. Williams v. National Organization, Masters, etc. (1956) 384 Pa.
413 [120 A.2d 896, 901 [13]]: “Even assuming that plaintiff ... could
have obtained employment in ports other than ... where he resided,
legally he was not compelled to do so in order to mitigate his damages.”
(Italics added.)
[12] Applying the foregoing rules to the record in the present case,
with all intendments in favor of the party opposing the summary
judgment motion—here, defendant—it is clear that the trial court
correctly ruled that plaintiff's failure to accept defendant's tendered
substitute employment could not be applied in mitigation of damages
because the offer of the “Big Country” lead was of employment both

119

different and inferior, and that no factual dispute was presented on
that issue. The mere circumstance that “Bloomer Girl” was to be a
musical review calling upon plaintiff's talents as a dancer as well as an
actress, and was to be produced in the City of Los Angeles, whereas
“Big Country” was a straight dramatic role in a “Western Type” story
taking place in an opal mine in Australia, demonstrates the difference
in kind between the two employments; the female lead as a dramatic
actress in a western style motion picture can by no stretch of
imagination be considered the equivalent of or substantially similar to
the lead in a song-and-dance production.
[13] Additionally, the substitute “Big Country” offer proposed to
eliminate or impair the director and screenplay approvals accorded to
plaintiff under the original “Bloomer Girl” contract (see fn. 2, ante),
and thus constituted an offer of inferior employment. No expertise or
judicial notice is required in order to hold that the deprivation or
infringement of an employee's rights held under an original
employment contract converts the available “other employment”
relied upon by the employer to mitigate damages, into inferior
employment which the employee need not seek or accept. (See
Gonzales v. Internal. Assn. of Machinists, supra., 213 Cal.App.2d 817, 823824; and fn. 5, post.)
[14] Statements found in affidavits submitted by defendant in
opposition to plaintiff's summary judgment motion, to the effect that
the “Big County” offer was not of employment different from or
inferior to that under the “Bloomer Girl” contract, merely repeat the
allegations of defendant's answer to the complaint in this action,
constitute only conclusionary assertions with respect to undisputed
facts, and do not give rise to a triable factual issue so as to defeat the
motion for summary judgment. (See Colvig v. KSFO (1964) 224
Cal.App.2d 357, 364 [36 Cal.Rptr. 701]; Dashew v. Dashew Business
Machines, Inc. (1963) 218 Cal.App.2d 711, 715 [32 Cal.Rptr. 682]; Hatch
v. Bush (1963) 215 Cal.App.2d 692, 707 [30 Cal. Rptr. 397, 13 A.L.R.3d
503]; Barry v. Rodgers (1956) 141 Cal.App.2d 340, 342 [296 P.2d 898].)
[15] In view of the determination that defendant failed to present any
facts showing the existence of a factual issue with respect to its sole
defense-plaintiff's rejection of its substitute employment offer in
mitigation of damages—we need not consider plaintiff's further
contention that for various reasons, including the provisions of the
original contract set forth in footnote 1, ante, plaintiff was excused
from attempting to mitigate damages.

120

[16] The judgment is affirmed.
McComb, J., Peters, J., Tobriner, J., Kaus, J. (Assigned by the Acting
Chairman of the Judicial Council ) and Roth, J., (Assigned by the
Acting Chairman of the Judicial Council) concurred.
SULLIVAN, ACTING C. J., DISSENTING
[17] The basic question in this case is whether or not plaintiff acted
reasonably in rejecting defendant's offer of alternate employment. The
answer depends upon whether that offer (starring in “Big Country, Big
Man”) was an offer of work that was substantially similar to her
former employment (starring in “Bloomer Girl”) or of work that was
of a different or inferior kind. To my mind this is a factual issue,
which the trial court should not have determined on a motion for
summary judgment. The majority have not only repeated this error but
have compounded it by applying the rules governing mitigation of
damages in the employer-employee context in a misleading fashion.
Accordingly, I respectfully dissent.
[18] The familiar rule requiring a plaintiff in a tort or contract action to
mitigate damages embodies notions of fairness and socially
responsible behavior which are fundamental to our jurisprudence.
Most broadly stated, it precludes the recovery of damages which,
through the exercise of due diligence, could have been avoided. Thus,
in essence, it is a rule requiring reasonable conduct in commercial
affairs. This general principle governs the obligations of an employee
after his employer has wrongfully repudiated or terminated the
employment contract. Rather than permitting the employee simply to
remain idle during the balance of the contract period, the law requires
him to make a reasonable effort to secure other employment.xxix He is
not obliged, however, to seek or accept any and all types of work
which may be available. Only work which is in the same field and
which is of the same quality need be accepted.xxx
[19] Over the years the courts have employed various phrases to
define the type of employment which the employee, upon his
wrongful discharge, is under an obligation to accept. Thus in
California alone it has been held that he must accept employment
which is “substantially similar” (Lewis v. Protective Security Life Ins. Co.
(1962) 208 Cal.App.2d 582, 584 [25 Cal.Rptr. 213]; de la Falaise v.
Gaumont-British Picture Corp. (1940) 39 Cal.App.2d 461, 469 [103 P.2d
447]); “comparable employment” ( Erler v. Five Points Motors, Inc. (1967)
249 Cal.App.2d 560, 562 [57 Cal.Rptr. 516]; Harris v. Nat. Union etc.
Cooks, Stewards (1953) 116 Cal.App.2d 759, 761 [254 P.2d 673]);

121

employment “in the same general line of the first employment” ( Rotter
v. Stationers Corp. (1960) 186 Cal.App.2d 170, 172 [8 Cal. Rptr. 690]);
“equivalent to his prior position” ( De Angeles v. Roos Bros., Inc. (1966)
244 Cal.App.2d 434, 443 [52 Cal.Rptr. 783]); “employment in a similar
capacity” ( Silva v. McCoy (1968) 259 Cal.App.2d 256, 260 [66 Cal.Rptr.
364]); employment which is “not ... of a different or inferior kind....” (
Gonzales v. Internat. Assn. of Machinists (1963) 213 Cal.App.2d 817, 822
[29 Cal.Rptr. 190].)xxxi
[20] For reasons which are unexplained, the majority cite several of
these cases yet select from among the various judicial formulations
which they contain one particular phrase, “Not of a different or
inferior kind,” with which to analyze this case. I have discovered no
historical or theoretical reason to adopt this phrase, which is simply a
negative restatement of the affirmative standards set out in the above
cases, as the exclusive standard. Indeed, its emergence is an example
of the dubious phenomenon of the law responding not to rational
judicial choice or changing social conditions, but to unrecognized
changes in the language of opinions or legal treatises.xxxii However, the
phrase is a serviceable one and my concern is not with its use as the
standard but rather with what I consider its distortion.
[21] The relevant language excuses acceptance only of employment
which is of a different kind. (Gonzales v. Internat. Assn. of Machinists, supra.,
213 Cal.App.2d 817, 822; Harris v. Nat. Union etc. Cooks, Stewards, supra.,
116 Cal.App.2d 759, 761; de la Falaise v. Gaumont-British Picture Corp.,
supra., 39 Cal.App.2d 461, 469.) It has never been the law that the
mere existence of differences between two jobs in the same field is sufficient,
as a matter of law, to excuse an employee wrongfully discharged from
one from accepting the other in order to mitigate damages. Such an
approach would effectively eliminate any obligation of an employee to
attempt to minimize damage arising from a wrongful discharge. The
only alternative job offer an employee would be required to accept
would be an offer of his former job by his former employer.
[22] Although the majority appear to hold that there was a difference
“in kind” between the employment offered plaintiff in “Bloomer Girl”
and that offered in “Big Country” (ante, at p. 183), an examination of
the opinion makes crystal clear that the majority merely point out
differences between the two films (an obvious circumstance) and then
apodically assert that these constitute a difference in the kind of
employment. The entire rationale of the majority boils down to this; that
the “mere circumstances” that “Bloomer Girl” was to be a musical review
while “Big Country” was a straight drama “demonstrates the

122

difference in kind” since a female lead in a western is not “the
equivalent of or substantially similar to” a lead in a musical. This is
merely attempting to prove the proposition by repeating it. It shows
that the vehicles for the display of the star's talents are different but it
does not prove that her employment as a star in such vehicles is of
necessity different in kind and either inferior or superior.
[23] I believe that the approach taken by the majority (a superficial
listing of differences with no attempt to assess their significance) may
subvert a valuable legal doctrine.xxxiii The inquiry in cases such as this
should not be whether differences between the two jobs exist (there
will always be differences) but whether the differences which are
present are substantial enough to constitute differences in the kind of
employment or, alternatively, whether they render the substitute work
employment of an inferior kind.
[24] It seems to me that this inquiry involves, in the instant case at
least, factual determinations which are improper on a motion for
summary judgment. Resolving whether or not one job is substantially
similar to another or whether, on the other hand, it is of a different or
inferior kind, will often (as here) require a critical appraisal of the
similarities and differences between them in light of the importance of
these differences to the employee. This necessitates a weighing of the
evidence, and it is precisely this undertaking which is forbidden on
summary judgment. (Garlock v. Cole (1962) 199 Cal. App. 2d 11, 14 [18
Cal.Rptr. 393].)
[25] This is not to say that summary judgment would never be
available in an action by an employee in which the employer raises the
defense of failure to mitigate damages. No case has come to my
attention, however, in which summary judgment has been granted on
the issue of whether an employee was obliged to accept available
alternate employment. Nevertheless, there may well be cases in which
the substitute employment is so manifestly of a dissimilar or inferior
sort, the declarations of the plaintiff so complete and those of the
defendant so conclusionary and inadequate that no factual issues exist
for which a trial is required. This, however, is not such a case.
[26] It is not intuitively obvious, to me at least, that the leading female
role in a dramatic motion picture is a radically different endeavor from
the leading female role in a musical comedy film. Nor is it plain to me
that the rather qualified rights of director and screenplay approval
contained in the first contract are highly significant matters either in
the entertainment industry in general or to this plaintiff in particular.

123

Certainly, none of the declarations introduced by plaintiff in support
of her motion shed any light on these issues.xxxiv Nor do they attempt
to explain why she declined the offer of starring in “Big Country, Big
Man.” Nevertheless, the trial court granted the motion, declaring that
these approval rights were “critical” and that their elimination altered
“the essential nature of the employment.”
[27] The declaration of Herman Citron, plaintiff's theatrical agent,
alleges that prior to the formation of the “Bloomer Girl” contract he
discussed with Richard Zanuck, defendant's vice president, the
conditions under which plaintiff might be interested in doing “Big
Country”; that it was Zanuck who informed him of Fox's decision to
cancel production of “Bloomer Girl” and queried him as to plaintiff's
continued interest in “Big Country”; that he informed Zanuck that
plaintiff was shocked by the decision, had turned down other offers
because of her commitment to defendant for “Bloomer Girl” and was
not interested in “Big Country.” It further alleges that “Bloomer Girl”
was to have been a musical review which would have given plaintiff an
opportunity to exhibit her talent as a dancer as well as an actress and
that “Big Country” was a straight dramatic role; the former to have
been produced in California, the latter in Australia. Citron's declaration
concludes by stating that he has not received any payment from
defendant for plaintiff under the “Bloomer Girl” contract.
[28] Benjamin Neuman's declaration states that he is plaintiff's
attorney; that after receiving notice of defendant's breach he requested
Citron to make every effort to obtain other suitable employment for
plaintiff; that he (Neuman) rejected defendant's offer to settle for
$400,000 and that he has not received any payment from defendant
for plaintiff under the “Bloomer Girl” contract. It also sets forth
correspondence between Neuman and Fox which culminated in Fox's
final rejection of plaintiff's demand for full payment.
[29] The plaintiff's declarations were of no assistance to the trial court
in its effort to justify reaching this conclusion on summary judgment.
Instead, it was forced to rely on judicial notice of the definitions of
“motion picture,” “screenplay” and “director” (Evid. Code, § 451,
subd. (e)) and then on judicial notice of practices in the film industry
which were purportedly of “common knowledge.” (Evid. Code, § 451,
subd. (f) or § 452, subd. (g).) This use of judicial notice was error.
Evidence Code section 451, subdivision (e) was never intended to
authorize resort to the dictionary to solve essentially factual questions
which do not turn upon conventional linguistic usage. More
important, however, the trial court's notice of “facts commonly

124

known” violated Evidence Code section 455, subdivision (a).xxxv
Before this section was enacted there were no procedural safeguards
affording litigants an opportunity to be heard as to the propriety of
taking judicial notice of a matter or as to the tenor of the matter to be
noticed. Section 455 makes such an opportunity (which may be an
element of due process, see Evid. Code, § 455, Law Revision Com.
Comment (a)) mandatory and its provisions should be scrupulously
adhered to. “[J]udicial notice can be a valuable tool in the adversary
system for the lawyer as well as the court” (Kongsgaard, Judicial Notice
(1966) 18 Hastings L.J. 117, 140) and its use is appropriate on motions
for summary judgment. Its use in this case, however, to determine on
summary judgment issues fundamental to the litigation without
complying with statutory requirements of notice and hearing is a
highly improper effort to “cut the Gordion knot of involved
litigation.” (Silver Land & Dev. Co. v. California Land Title Co. (1967) 248
Cal.App.2d 241, 242 [56 Cal.Rptr. 178].)
[30] The majority do not confront the trial court's misuse of judicial
notice. They avoid this issue through the expedient of declaring that
neither judicial notice nor expert opinion (such as that contained in
the declarations in opposition to the motion)xxxvi is necessary to reach
the trial court's conclusion. Something, however, clearly is needed to
support this conclusion. Nevertheless, the majority make no effort to
justify the judgment through an examination of the plaintiff's
declarations. Ignoring the obvious insufficiency of these declarations,
the majority announce that “the deprivation or infringement of an
employee's rights held under an original employment contract”
changes the alternate employment offered or available into
employment of an inferior kind.
[31] The second declaration is that of Richard Zanuck. It avers that he
is Fox's vice president in charge of production; that he has final
responsibility for casting decisions, that he is familiar with plaintiff's
ability and previous artistic history; that the offer of employment for
“Big Country” was in the same general line and comparable to that of
“Bloomer Girl”; that plaintiff would not have suffered any detriment
to her image or reputation by appearing in it; that elimination of
director and script approval rights would not injure plaintiff; that
plaintiff has appeared in dramatic and western roles previously and has
not limited herself to musicals; and that Fox would have complied
with the terms of its offer if plaintiff had accepted it.
[32] I cannot accept the proposition that an offer which eliminates any
contract right, regardless of its significance, is, as a matter of law, an

125

offer of employment of an inferior kind. Such an absolute rule seems
no more sensible than the majority's earlier suggestion that the mere
existence of differences between two jobs is sufficient to render them
employment of different kinds. Application of such per se rules will
severely undermine the principle of mitigation of damages in the
employer-employee context.
[33] I remain convinced that the relevant question in such cases is
whether or not a particular contract provision is so significant that its
omission creates employment of an inferior kind. This question is, of
course, intimately bound up in what I consider the ultimate issue:
whether or not the employee acted reasonably. This will generally
involve a factual inquiry to ascertain the importance of the particular
contract term and a process of weighing the absence of that term
against the countervailing advantages of the alternate employment. In
the typical case, this will mean that summary judgment must be
withheld.
[34] In the instant case, there was nothing properly before the trial
court by which the importance of the approval rights could be
ascertained, much less evaluated. Thus, in order to grant the motion
for summary judgment, the trial court misused judicial notice. In
upholding the summary judgment, the majority here rely upon per se
rules which distort the process of determining whether or not an
employee is obliged to accept particular employment in mitigation of
damages.
[35] I believe that the judgment should be reversed so that the issue of
whether or not the offer of the lead role in “Big Country, Big Man”
was of employment comparable to that of the lead role in “Bloomer
Girl” may be determined at trial.

3.6.1 Discussion of Parker v. Twentieth Century-Fox
Would you expect that a promisee’s “reasonable efforts to avoid loss”
would include accepting an offer of substitute performance from the
breaching party?
Is there any chance that accepting the breacher’s offer could impair the
promisee’s right to prove a breach of contract?
Suppose that promisees were obliged to accept any offer in mitigation of
damages without considering its source. Might such a rule encourage
breaching promisors to make opportunistic offers calculated to be
unattractive but sufficient to reduce the amount of damages recoverable for
breach? Is there any evidence in Parker of this type of behavior?

126

The Parker court holds that wrongfully discharged employees need only
accept “substantially similar” employment in mitigation of their losses. Why
do courts limit the types of work that plaintiffs must accept? What
competing concern makes avoidability doctrine an important source of
incentives for workers who have suffered the breach of an employment
contract?

4 Cost of Completion vs. Difference in Value
Recall that expectation damages are the default remedy for breach of
contract. According to Restatement § 344, protecting the promisee’s
expectation interest requires an award of damages sufficient to “put [him] in
as good a position as he would have been in had the contract been
performed.” But what exactly is required to achieve this objective? The
cases that follow attempt to answer this question.

4.1 Principal Case – American Standard v. Schectman
American Standard, Inc. v. Schectman
Supreme Court of New York, Appellate Division
80 A.D.2d 318; 439 N.Y.S.2d 529 (1981)
HANCOCK, JR.
[1] Plaintiffs have recovered a judgment on a jury verdict of $90,000
against defendant for his failure to complete grading and to take out
certain foundations and other subsurface structures to one foot below
the grade line as promised. Whether the court should have charged the
jury, as defendant Schectman requested, that the difference in value of
plaintiffs' property with and without the promised performance was
the measure of the damage is the main point in his appeal.xxxvii We
hold that the request was properly denied and that the cost of
completion—not the difference in value—was the proper measure.
Finding no basis for reversal, we affirm.
[2] Until 1972, plaintiffs operated a pig iron manufacturing plant on
land abutting the Niagara River in Tonawanda. On the 26-acre parcel
were, in addition to various industrial and office buildings, a 60-ton
blast furnace, large lifts, hoists and other equipment for transporting
and storing ore, railroad tracks, cranes, diesel locomotives and sundry
implements and devices used in the business. Since the 1870's
plaintiffs' property, under several different owners, had been the site
of various industrial operations. Having decided to close the plant,
plaintiffs on August 3, 1973 made a contract in which they agreed to
convey the buildings and other structures and most of the equipment

127

to defendant, a demolition and excavating contractor, in return for
defendant's payment of $275,000 and his promise to remove the
equipment, demolish the structures and grade the property as
specified.
[3] We agree with Trial Term's interpretation of the contract as
requiring defendant to remove all foundations, piers, headwalls, and
other structures, including those under the surface and not visible and
whether or not shown on the map attached to the contract, to a depth
of approximately one foot below the specified grade lines.xxxviii The
proof from plaintiffs' witnesses and the exhibits, showing a substantial
deviation from the required grade lines and the existence above grade
of walls, foundations and other structures, support the finding,
implicit in the jury's verdict, that defendant failed to perform as
agreed. Indeed, the testimony of defendant's witnesses and the
position he has taken during his performance of the contract and
throughout this litigation (which the trial court properly rejected), viz.,
that the contract did not require him to remove all subsurface
foundations, allow no other conclusion.
[4] We turn to defendant's argument that the court erred in rejecting
his proof that plaintiffs suffered no loss by reason of the breach
because it makes no difference in the value of the property whether
the old foundations are at grade or one foot below grade and in
denying his offer to show that plaintiffs succeeded in selling the
property for $183,000—only $3,000 less than its full fair market value.
By refusing this testimony and charging the jury that the cost of
completion (estimated at $110,500 by plaintiffs' expert), not
diminution in value of the property, was the measure of damage the
court, defendant contends, has unjustly permitted plaintiffs to reap a
windfall at his expense. Citing the definitive opinion of Judge Cardozo
in Jacob & Youngs v Kent (230 NY 239), he maintains that the facts
present a case "of substantial performance" of the contract with
omissions of "trivial or inappreciable importance" and that because
the cost of completion was "grossly and unfairly out of proportion to
the good to be attained," the proper measure of damage is diminution
in value.
[5] The general rule of damages for breach of a construction contract
is that the injured party may recover those damages which are the
direct, natural and immediate consequence of the breach and which
can reasonably be said to have been in the contemplation of the
parties when the contract was made (see 13 NY Jur, Damages, §§ 46,
56; Chamberlain v Parker, 45 NY 569; Hadley v Baxendale, 9 Exch

128

[Welsby, Hurlstone & Gordon] 341; Restatement, Contracts, § 346).
In the usual case where the contractor's performance has been
defective or incomplete, the reasonable cost of replacement or
completion is the measure (see Bellizzi v Huntley Estates, 3 NY2d 112;
Spence v Ham, 163 NY 220; Condello v Stock, 285 App Div 861, mod on
other grounds 1 NY2d 831; Along-The-Hudson Co. v Ayres, 170 App Div
218; 13 NY Jur, Damages, § 56, p 502; Restatement, Contracts, § 346).
When, however, there has been a substantial performance of the
contract made in good faith but defects exist, the correction of which
would result in economic waste, courts have measured the damages as
the difference between the value of the property as constructed and
the value if performance had been properly completed (see Jacob &
Youngs v Kent, supra; Droher & Sons v Toushin, 250 Minn 490;
Restatement, Contracts, § 346, subd [1], par [a], cl [ii], p 573; comment
b, p 574; 13 NY Jur, Damages, § 58; Ann., 76 ALR2d 805, § 4, pp 812815). Jacob & Youngs is illustrative. There, plaintiff, a contractor, had
constructed a house for the defendant which was satisfactory in all
respects save one: the wrought iron pipe installed for the plumbing
was not of Reading manufacture, as specified in the contract, but of
other brands of the same quality. Noting that the breach was
unintentional and the consequences of the omission trivial, and that
the cost of replacing the pipe would be "grievously out of proportion"
(Jacob & Youngs v Kent, supra, p 244) to the significance of the default,
the court held the breach to be immaterial and the proper measure of
damage to the owner to be not the cost of replacing the pipe but the
nominal difference in value of the house with and without the Reading
pipe.
[6] Not in all cases of claimed "economic waste" where the cost of
completing performance of the contract would be large and out of
proportion to the resultant benefit to the property have the courts
adopted diminution in value as the measure of damage. Under the
Restatement rule, the completion of the contract must involve
"unreasonable economic waste" and the illustrative example given is
that of a house built with pipe different in name but equal in quality to
the brand stipulated in the contract as in Jacob & Youngs v Kent (230
NY 239, supra) (Restatement, Contracts, § 346, subd [1], par [a], cl [ii],
p 573; Illustration No. 2, p 576). In Groves v Wunder Co. (205 Minn.
163), plaintiff had leased property and conveyed a gravel plant to
defendant in exchange for a sum of money and for defendant's
commitment to return the property to plaintiff at the end of the term
at a specified grade -- a promise defendant failed to perform. Although
the cost of the fill to complete the grading was $60,000 and the total

129

value of the property, graded as specified in the contract, only $12,160
the court rejected the "diminution in value" rule, stating: “The owner's
right to improve his property is not trammeled by its small value. It is
his right to erect thereon structures which will reduce its value. If that
be the result, it can be of no aid to any contractor who declines
performance. As said long ago in Chamberlain v. Parker, 45 N.Y. 569,
572: ‘A man may do what he will with his own, ... and if he chooses to
erect a monument to his caprice or folly on his premises, and employs
and pays another to do it, it does not lie with a defendant who has
been so employed and paid for building it, to say that his own
performance would not be beneficial to the plaintiff.’” (Groves v Wunder
Co., supra, p 168.)
[7] The "economic waste" of the type which calls for application of
the "diminution in value" rule generally entails defects in construction
which are irremediable or which may not be repaired without a
substantial tearing down of the structure as in Jacob & Youngs (see
Bellizzi v Huntley Estates, 3 NY2d 112, 115, supra; Groves v Wunder Co.,
supra; Slugg Seed & Fertilizer v Paulson Lbr., 62 Wis 2d 220; Restatement,
Contracts, § 346, subd [1], Illustration Nos. 2, 4, pp 576-577; Ann., 76
ALR2d 805, § 4, pp 812-815).
[8] Where, however, the breach is of a covenant which is only
incidental to the main purpose of the contract and completion would
be disproportionately costly, courts have applied the diminution in
value measure even where no destruction of the work is entailed (see,
e.g., Peevyhouse v Garland Coal & Min. Co., 382 P2d 109 [Okla], cert.
denied, 375 U.S. 906, holding [contrary to Groves v Wunder Co., supra]
that diminution in value is the proper measure where defendant, the
lessee of plaintiff's lands under a coal mining lease, failed to perform
costly remedial and restorative work on the land at the termination of
the lease. The court distinguished the "building and construction"
cases and noted that the breach was of a covenant incidental to the
main purpose of the contract which was the recovery of coal from the
premises to the benefit of both parties; and see Avery v Fredericksen &
Westbrook, 67 Cal App 2d 334).
[9] It is also a general rule in building and construction cases, at least
under Jacob & Youngs (supra) in New York (see Groves v Wunder Co.,
supra; Ann., 76 ALR2d 805, § 6, pp 823-826), that a contractor who
would ask the court to apply the diminution of value measure "as an
instrument of justice" must not have breached the contract
intentionally and must show substantial performance made in good
faith (Jacob & Youngs v Kent, supra, pp 244, 245).

130

[10] In the case before us, plaintiffs chose to accept as part of the
consideration for the promised conveyance of their valuable plant and
machines to defendant his agreement to grade the property as
specified and to remove the foundations, piers and other structures to
a depth of one foot below grade to prepare the property for sale. It
cannot be said that the grading and the removal of the structures were
incidental to plaintiffs' purpose of "achieving a reasonably attractive
vacant plot for resale" (cf. Peevyhouse v Garland Coal & Min. Co., supra).
Nor can defendant maintain that the damages which would naturally
flow from his failure to do the grading and removal work and which
could reasonably be said to have been in the contemplation of the
parties when the contract was made would not be the reasonable cost
of completion (see 13 NY Jur, Damages, §§ 46, 56; Hadley v Baxendale,
9 Exch [Welsby, Hurlstone & Gordon] 341, supra). That the fulfillment
of defendant's promise would (contrary to plaintiffs' apparent
expectations) add little or nothing to the sale value of the property
does not excuse the default.
[11] As in the hypothetical case, posed in Chamberlain v Parker (45 NY
569, supra) (cited in Groves v Wunder Co., 205 Minn 163, supra), of the
man who "chooses to erect a monument to his caprice or folly on his
premises, and employs and pays another to do it", it does not lie with
defendant here who has received consideration for his promise to do
the work "to say that his own performance would not be beneficial to
the [plaintiffs]" (Chamberlain v Parker, supra, p 572).
[12] Defendant's completed performance would not have involved
undoing what in good faith was done improperly but only doing what
was promised and left undone (cf. Jacob & Youngs v Kent, 230 NY 239,
supra; Restatement, Contracts, § 346, subd [1], Illustration No. 2, p
576). That the burdens of performance were heavier than anticipated
and the cost of completion disproportionate to the end to be obtained
does not, without more, alter the rule that the measure of plaintiffs'
damage is the cost of completion. Disparity in relative economic
benefits is not the equivalent of "economic waste" which will invoke
the rule in Jacob & Youngs v Kent (supra) (see Groves v Wunder Co., supra).
Moreover, faced with the jury's finding that the reasonable cost of
removing the large concrete and stone walls and other structures
extending above grade was $90,000, defendant can hardly assert that
he has rendered substantial performance of the contract or that what
he left unfinished was "of trivial or inappreciable importance" (Jacob &
Youngs v Kent, supra, p 245). Finally, defendant, instead of attempting in
good faith to complete the removal of the underground structures,

131

contended that he was not obliged by the contract to do so and, thus,
cannot claim to be a "transgressor whose default is unintentional and
trivial [and who] may hope for mercy if he will offer atonement for his
wrong" (Jacob & Youngs v Kent, supra, p 244). We conclude, therefore,
that the proof pertaining to the value of plaintiffs' property was
properly rejected and the jury correctly charged on damages.
[13] The judgment and order should be affirmed.

4.2 Principal Case – Peevyhouse v. Garland Coal & Mining
Co.
Peevyhouse v. Garland Coal & Mining Co.
Supreme Court of Oklahoma
382 P.2d 109 (1962)
JACKSON, JUSTICE.
[1] In the trial court, plaintiffs Willie and Lucille Peevyhouse sued the
defendant, Garland Coal and Mining Company, for damages for
breach of contract. Judgment was for plaintiffs in an amount
considerably less than was sued for. Plaintiffs appeal and defendant
cross-appeals.
[2] In the briefs on appeal, the parties present their argument and
contentions under several propositions; however, they all stem from
the basic question of whether the trial court properly instructed the
jury on the measure of damages.
[3] Briefly stated, the facts are as follows: plaintiffs owned a farm
containing coal deposits, and in November, 1954, leased the premises
to defendant for a period of five years for coal mining purposes. A
“stripmining” operation was contemplated in which the coal would be
taken from pits on the surface of the ground, instead of from
underground mine shafts. In addition to the usual covenants found in
a coal mining lease, defendant specifically agreed to perform certain
restorative and remedial work at the end of the lease period. It is
unnecessary to set out the details of the work to be done, other than
to say that it would involve the moving of many thousands of cubic
yards of dirt, at a cost estimated by expert witnesses at about
$29,000.00. However, plaintiffs sued for only $25,000.00.
[4] During the trial, it was stipulated that all covenants and
agreements in the lease contract had been fully carried out by both
parties, except the remedial work mentioned above; defendant
conceded that this work had not been done.

132

[5] Plaintiffs introduced expert testimony as to the amount and
nature of the work to be done, and its estimated cost. Over plaintiffs'
objections, defendant thereafter introduced expert testimony as to the
“diminution in value” of plaintiffs' farm resulting from the failure of
defendant to render performance as agreed in the contract—that is,
the difference between the present value of the farm, and what its
value would have been if defendant had done what it agreed to do.
[6] At the conclusion of the trial, the court instructed the jury that it
must return a verdict for plaintiffs, and left the amount of damages for
jury determination. On the measure of damages, the court instructed
the jury that it might consider the cost of performance of the work
defendant agreed to do, “together with all of the evidence offered on
behalf of either party.”
[7] It thus appears that the jury was at liberty to consider the
“diminution in value” of plaintiffs' farm as well as the cost of “repair
work” in determining the amount of damages.
[8] It returned a verdict for plaintiffs for $5000.00—only a fraction of
the “cost of performance,” but more than the total value of the farm even after
the remedial work is done.
[9] On appeal, the issue is sharply drawn. Plaintiffs contend that the
true measure of damages in this case is what it will cost plaintiffs to
obtain performance of the work that was not done because of
defendant's default. Defendant argues that the measure of damages is
the cost of performance “limited, however, to the total difference in
the market value before and after the work was performed.”
[10] It appears that this precise question has not heretofore been
presented to this court. In Ardizonne v. Archer, 72 Okl. 70, 178 P. 263,
this court held that the measure of damages for breach of a contract to
drill an oil well was the reasonable cost of drilling the well, but here a
slightly different factual situation exists. The drilling of an oil well will
yield valuable geological information, even if no oil or gas is found,
and of course if the well is a producer, the value of the premises
increases. In the case before us, it is argued by defendant with some
force that the performance of the remedial work defendant agreed to
do will add at the most only a few hundred dollars to the value of
plaintiffs' farm, and that the damages should be limited to that amount
because that is all plaintiffs have lost.
[11] Plaintiffs rely on Groves v. John Wunder Co., 205 Minn. 163, 286
N.W. 235, 123 A.L.R. 502. In that case, the Minnesota court, in a

133

substantially similar situation, adopted the “cost of performance” rule
as-opposed to the “value” rule. The result was to authorize a jury to
give plaintiff damages in the amount of $60,000, where the real estate
concerned would have been worth only $12,160, even if the work
contracted for had been done.
[12] It may be observed that Groves v. John Wunder Co., supra, is the only
case which has come to our attention in which the cost of
performance rule has been followed under circumstances where the
cost of performance greatly exceeded the diminution in value resulting
from the breach of contract. Incidentally, it appears that this case was
decided by a plurality rather than a majority of the members of the
court.
[13] Defendant relies principally upon Sandy Valley & E. R. Co., v.
Hughes, 175 Ky. 320, 194 S.W. 344; Bigham v. Wabash-Pittsburg Terminal
Ry. Co., 223 Pa. 106, 72 A. 318; and Sweeney v. Lewis Const. Co., 66
Wash. 490, 119 P. 1108. These were all cases in which, under similar
circumstances, the appellate courts followed the “value” rule instead
of the “cost of performance” rule. Plaintiff points out that in the
earliest of these cases (Bigham) the court cites as authority on the
measure of damages an earlier Pennsylvania tort case, and that the
other two cases follow the first, with no explanation as to why a
measure of damages ordinarily followed in cases sounding in tort
should be used in contract cases. Nevertheless, it is of some
significance that three out of four appellate courts have followed the
diminution in value rule under circumstances where, as here, the cost
of performance greatly exceeds the diminution in value.
[14] The explanation may be found in the fact that the situations
presented are artificial ones. It is highly unlikely that the ordinary
property owner would agree to pay $29,000 (or its equivalent) for the
construction of “improvements” upon his property that would
increase its value only about ($300) three hundred dollars. The result is
that we are called upon to apply principles of law theoretically based
upon reason and reality to a situation which is basically unreasonable
and unrealistic.
[15] In Groves v. John Wunder Co., supra, in arriving at its conclusions,
the Minnesota court apparently considered the contract involved to be
analogous to a building and construction contract, and cited authority
for the proposition that the cost of performance or completion of the
building as contracted is ordinarily the measure of damages in actions
for damages for the breach of such a contract.

134

[16] In an annotation following the Minnesota case beginning at 123
A.L.R. 515, the annotator places the three cases relied on by defendant
(Sandy Valley, Bigham and Sweeney) under the classification of cases
involving “grading and excavation contracts.”
[17] We do not think either analogy is strictly applicable to the case
now before us. The primary purpose of the lease contract between
plaintiffs and defendant was neither “building and construction” nor
“grading and excavation.” It was merely to accomplish the economical
recovery and marketing of coal from the premises, to the profit of all
parties. The special provisions of the lease contract pertaining to
remedial work were incidental to the main object involved.
[18] Even in the case of contracts that are unquestionably building and
construction contracts, the authorities are not in agreement as to the
factors to be considered in determining whether the cost of
performance rule or the value rule should be applied. The American
Law Institute's RESTATEMENT OF THE LAW, CONTRACTS, Volume 1,
Sections 346(1)(a)(i) and (ii) submits the proposition that the cost of
performance is the proper measure of damages “if this is possible and
does not involve unreasonable economic waste;” and that the diminution in
value caused by the breach is the proper measure “if construction and
completion in accordance with the contract would involve unreasonable
economic waste.” (Emphasis supplied.) In an explanatory comment
immediately following the text, the Restatement makes it clear that the
“economic waste” referred to consists of the destruction of a
substantially completed building or other structure. Of course no such
destruction is involved in the case now before us.
[19] On the other hand, in MCCORMICK, DAMAGES, Section 168, it is
said with regard to building and construction contracts that “…in
cases where the defect is one that can be repaired or cured without
undue expense” the cost of performance is the proper measure of
damages, but where “…the defect in material or construction is one
that cannot be remedied without an expenditure for reconstruction
disproportionate to the end to be attained” (emphasis supplied) the value rule
should be followed. The same idea was expressed in Jacob & Youngs,
Inc. v. Kent, 230 N.Y. 239, 129 N.E. 889, 23 A.L.R. 1429, as follows:
The owner is entitled to the money which will permit him to
complete, unless the cost of completion is grossly and unfairly out of
proportion to the good to be attained. When that is true, the measure
is the difference in value.

135

[20] It thus appears that the prime consideration in the Restatement
was “economic waste;” and that the prime consideration in
MCCORMICK, DAMAGES, and in Jacob & Youngs, Inc. v. Kent, supra, was
the relationship between the expense involved and the “end to be
attained”—in other words, the “relative economic benefit.”
[21] In view of the unrealistic fact situation in the instant case, and
certain Oklahoma statutes to be hereinafter noted, we are of the
opinion that the “relative economic benefit” is a proper consideration
here. This is in accord with the recent case of Mann v. Clowser, 190 Va.
887, 59 S.E.2d 78, where, in applying the cost rule, the Virginia court
specifically noted that “… the defects are remediable from a practical
standpoint and the costs are not grossly disproportionate to the results to be
obtained” (Emphasis supplied).
[22] 23 O.S.1961 §§ 96 and 97 provide as follows:
§ 96. …Notwithstanding the provisions of this
chapter, no person can recover a greater amount in
damages for the breach of an obligation, than he
would have gained by the full performance thereof
on both sides….
§ 97. …Damages must, in all cases, be reasonable,
and where an obligation of any kind appears to
create a right to unconscionable and grossly
oppressive damages, contrary to substantial justice
no more than reasonable damages can be recovered.
Although it is true that the above sections of the statute are applied
most often in tort cases, they are by their own terms, and the decisions
of this court, also applicable in actions for damages for breach of
contract. It would seem that they are peculiarly applicable here where,
under the “cost of performance” rule, plaintiffs might recover an
amount about nine times the total value of their farm. Such would
seem to be “unconscionable and grossly oppressive damages, contrary
to substantial justice” within the meaning of the statute. Also, it can
hardly be denied that if plaintiffs here are permitted to recover under
the “cost of performance” rule, they will receive a greater benefit from
the breach than could be gained from full performance, contrary to
the provisions of Sec. 96.
[23] An analogy may be drawn between the cited sections, and the
provisions of 15 O.S.1961 §§ 214 and 215. These sections tend to
render void any provisions of a contract which attempt to fix the
amount of stipulated damages to be paid in case of a breach, except

136

where it is impracticable or extremely difficult to determine the actual
damages. This results in spite of the agreement of the parties, and the
obvious and well known rationale is that insofar as they exceed the
actual damages suffered, the stipulated damages amount to a penalty
or forfeiture which the law does not favor.
[24] 23 O.S.1961 §§ 96 and 97 have the same effect in the case now
before us. In spite of the agreement of the parties, these sections limit the
damages recoverable to a reasonable amount not “contrary to
substantial justice;” they prevent plaintiffs from recovering a “greater
amount in damages for the breach of an obligation” than they would
have “gained by the full performance thereof.”
[25] We therefore hold that where, in a coal mining lease, lessee agrees
to perform certain remedial work on the premises concerned at the
end of the lease period, and thereafter the contract is fully performed
by both parties except that the remedial work is not done, the measure
of damages in an action by lessor against lessee for damages for breach
of contract is ordinarily the reasonable cost of performance of the
work; however, where the contract provision breached was merely
incidental to the main purpose in view, and where the economic
benefit which would result to lessor by full performance of the work is
grossly disproportionate to the cost of performance, the damages
which lessor may recover are limited to the diminution in value
resulting to the premises because of the non-performance.
[26] We believe the above holding is in conformity with the intention
of the Legislature as expressed in the statutes mentioned, and in
harmony with the better-reasoned cases from the other jurisdictions
where analogous fact situations have been considered. It should be
noted that the rule as stated does not interfere with the property
owner's right to “do what he will with his own” Chamberlain v. Parker,
45 N.Y. 569), or his right, if he chooses, to contract for
“improvements” which will actually have the effect of reducing his
property's value. Where such result is in fact contemplated by the
parties, and is a main or principal purpose of those contracting, it
would seem that the measure of damages for breach would ordinarily
be the cost of performance.
[27] The above holding disposes of all of the arguments raised by the
parties on appeal.
[28] Under the most liberal view of the evidence herein, the
diminution in value resulting to the premises because of nonperformance of the remedial work was $300.00. After a careful search

137

of the record, we have found no evidence of a higher figure, and
plaintiffs do not argue in their briefs that a greater diminution in value
was sustained. It thus appears that the judgment was clearly excessive,
and that the amount for which judgment should have been rendered is
definitely and satisfactorily shown by the record.
[29] We are asked by each party to modify the judgment in accordance
with the respective theories advanced, and it is conceded that we have
authority to do so. 12 O.S.1961 § 952; Busboom v. Smith, 199 Okl. 688,
191 P.2d 198; Stumpf v. Stumpf, 173 Okl. 1, 46 P.2d 315.
[30] We are of the opinion that the judgment of the trial court for
plaintiffs should be, and it is hereby, modified and reduced to the sum
of $300.00, and as so modified it is affirmed.

DISSENT.

IRWIN, JUSTICE (DISSENTING).
[31] By the specific provisions in the coal mining lease under
consideration, the defendant agreed as follows:
7b Lessee agrees to make fills in the pits dug on said
premises on the property line in such manner that
fences can be placed thereon and access had to
opposite sides of the pits.
7c Lessee agrees to smooth off the top of the spoil
banks on the above premises.
7d Lessee agrees to leave the creek crossing the
above premises in such a condition that it will not
interfere with the crossings to be made in pits as set
out in 7b.…
7f Lessee further agrees to leave no shale or dirt on
the high wall of said pits….
Following the expiration of the lease, plaintiffs made demand upon
defendant that it carry out the provisions of the contract and to
perform those covenants contained therein.
[32] Defendant admits that it failed to perform its obligations that it
agreed and contracted to perform under the lease contract and there is
nothing in the record which indicates that defendant could not

138

perform its obligations. Therefore, in my opinion defendant's breach
of the contract was wilful and not in good faith.
[33] Although the contract speaks for itself, there were several
negotiations between the plaintiffs and defendant before the contract
was executed. Defendant admitted in the trial of the action, that
plaintiffs insisted that the above provisions be included in the contract
and that they would not agree to the coal mining lease unless the
above provisions were included.
[34] In consideration for the lease contract, plaintiffs were to receive a
certain amount as royalty for the coal produced and marketed and in
addition thereto their land was to be restored as provided in the
contract.
[35] Defendant received as consideration for the contract, its
proportionate share of the coal produced and marketed and in
addition thereto, the right to use plaintiffs' land in the furtherance of its
mining operations.
[36] The cost for performing the contract in question could have been
reasonably approximated when the contract was negotiated and
executed and there are no conditions now existing which could not
have been reasonably anticipated by the parties. Therefore, defendant
had knowledge, when it prevailed upon the plaintiffs to execute the
lease, that the cost of performance might be disproportionate to the
value or benefits received by plaintiff for the performance.
[37] Defendant has received its benefits under the contract and now
urges, in substance, that plaintiffs' measure of damages for its failure
to perform should be the economic value of performance to the
plaintiffs and not the cost of performance.
[38] If a peculiar set of facts should exist where the above rule should
be applied as the proper measure of damages, (and in my judgment
those facts do not exist in the instant case) before such rule should be
applied, consideration should be given to the benefits received or
contracted for by the party who asserts the application of the rule.
[39] Defendant did not have the right to mine plaintiffs' coal or to use
plaintiffs' property for its mining operations without the consent of
plaintiffs. Defendant had knowledge of the benefits that it would
receive under the contract and the approximate cost of performing the
contract. With this knowledge, it must be presumed that defendant
thought that it would be to its economic advantage to enter into the

139

contract with plaintiffs and that it would reap benefits from the
contract, or it would have not entered into the contract.
[40] Therefore, if the value of the performance of a contract should be
considered in determining the measure of damages for breach of a
contract, the value of the benefits received under the contract by a
party who breaches a contract should also be considered. However, in
my judgment, to give consideration to either in the instant action,
completely rescinds and holds for naught the solemnity of the contract
before us and makes an entirely new contract for the parties.
[41] In Goble v. Bell Oil & Gas Co., 97 Okl. 261, 223 P. 371, we held:
Even though the contract contains harsh and
burdensome terms which the court does not in all
respects approve, it is the province of the parties in
relation to lawful subject matter to fix their rights
and obligations, and the court will give the contract
effect according to its expressed provisions, unless it
be shown by competent evidence proof that the
written agreement as executed is the result of fraud,
mistake, or accident.
[42] In Cities Service Oil Co. v. Geolograph Co. Inc., 208 Okl. 179, 254 P.2d
775, we said:
While we do not agree that the contract as presently
written is an onerous one, we think the short answer
is that the folly or wisdom of a contract is not for
the court to pass on.
[43] In Great Western Oil & Gas Company v. Mitchell, Okl., 326 P.2d
794, we held:
The law will not make a better contract for parties
than they themselves have seen fit to enter into, or
alter it for the benefit of one party and to the
detriment of the others; the judicial function of a
court of law is to enforce a contract as it is written.
[44] I am mindful of Title 23 O.S.1961 § 96, which provides that no
person can recover a greater amount in damages for the breach of an
obligation than he could have gained by the full performance thereof
on both sides, except in cases not applicable herein. However, in my
judgment, the above statutory provision is not applicable here.
[45] In my judgment, we should follow the case of Groves v. John
Wunder Company, 205 Minn. 163, 286 N.W. 235, 123 A.L.R. 502, which
defendant agrees “that the fact situation is apparently similar to the

140

one in the case at bar”, and where the Supreme Court of Minnesota
held:
The owner's or employer's damages for such a
breach (i. e. breach hypothesized in 2d syllabus) are
to be measured, not in respect to the value of the
land to be improved, but by the reasonable cost of
doing that which the contractor promised to do and
which he left undone.
[46] The hypothesized breach referred to states that where the
contractor's breach of a contract is willful, that is, in bad-faith, he is
not entitled to any benefit of the equitable doctrine of substantial
performance.
[47] In the instant action defendant has made no attempt to even
substantially perform. The contract in question is not immoral, is not
tainted with fraud, and was not entered into through mistake or
accident and is not contrary to public policy. It is clear and
unambiguous and the parties understood the terms thereof, and the
approximate cost of fulfilling the obligations could have been
approximately ascertained. There are no conditions existing now
which could not have been reasonably anticipated when the contract
was negotiated and executed. The defendant could have performed
the contract if it desired. It has accepted and reaped the benefits of its
contract and now urges that plaintiffs' benefits under the contract be
denied. If plaintiffs' benefits are denied, such benefits would inure to
the direct benefit of the defendant.
[48] Therefore, in my opinion, the plaintiffs were entitled to specific
performance of the contract and since defendant has failed to
perform, the proper measure of damages should be the cost of
performance. Any other measure of damage would be holding for
naught the express provisions of the contract; would be taking from
the plaintiffs the benefits of the contract and placing those benefits in
defendant which has failed to perform its obligations; would be
granting benefits to defendant without a resulting obligation; and
would be completely rescinding the solemn obligation of the contract
for the benefit of the defendant to the detriment of the plaintiffs by
making an entirely new contract for the parties.
[49] I therefore respectfully dissent to the opinion promulgated by a
majority of my associates.

[Although none of what follows is strictly necessary for understanding the
issues in Peevyhouse, the court’s discussion of the testimony at trial may

141

give us more insight into the facts underlying plaintiffs’ claim for damages.
You may also find grounds to question the competence of plaintiffs’
counsel in developing the record and presenting arguments at trial.]
Supplemental Opinion on Rehearing
Jackson, Justice.
[50]
In a Petition for Rehearing, plaintiffs Peevyhouse have raised
certain questions not presented in the original briefs on appeal.
[51]
They insist that the trial court excluded evidence as to the total
value of the premises concerned, and, in effect, that they have not had
their ‘day in court’. This argument arises by reason of the fact that their
farm consists not merely of the 60 acres covered by the coal mining lease,
but includes other lands as well.
[52]
Plaintiffs originally pleaded two causes of action against the
defendant mining company. The first one was for damages for breach of
contract; the second one was for damages to the water well and home of
plaintiffs, because of the use of excessively large charges of dynamite or
blasting powder in close proximity to the home and well.
[53]
Numbered paragraph 2 of plaintiffs' petition alleges that they own
and live upon 60 acres of land which are specifically described. This is the
only land described in the petition, and there is no allegation as to the ownership or
leasing of any other lands.
[54]
Page 4 of the transcript of evidence reveals that near the
beginning of the trial, plaintiff Peevyhouse was asked a question
concerning improvements he had made to his property. His answer was
“For one thing I built a new home on the place in 1951, and along about
that time I was building a pasture. And I would say ninety percent of this 120
acres is in good grass.” (Emphasis supplied.) Mr. Watts, defense counsel, then
objected “to any testimony about the property, other than the 160 acres.”
(It is obvious that he means “60” instead of “160.”) Further proceedings
were as follows:
The Court: The objection will be sustained as to any other part. Go ahead
Mr. McCornell (attorney for plaintiffs): Comes now the plaintiff and
dismisses the second cause of action without prejudice.
It thus appears that plaintiffs made no complaint as to the court's
exclusion of evidence concerning lands other than the 60 acres described
in their petition.

142

[55]
Pages 7 and 8 of the transcript show that later during direct
examination of Mr. Peevyhouse, the following occurred:
Q. (By Mr. McConnell) Now, Mr. Peevyhouse, I ask you to step down
here and I ask you if you are familiar with this sketch or drawing?
…
A. Yes. I've got about 40 acres here, and here would be 20, and there
would be 20 on this sketch. And I've got leased land lying in here, 80
acres.
Mr. Watts: If your Honor please, I object to anything except the 60 acres
involved in this lawsuit.
The Court: Sustained.
Q. (By Mr. McConnell) Will you point out to the jury, the boundary line
shown of your property?
….
A. That blue is where the water is actually standing at the present time. Up
until a short time ago this area here came over that far. And this spring all
of it would run, come in here out this way and through here, spreading
over this land and all below it. And at the present time this is washed out
here.
Mr. Watts: If your Honor please, I object to that as not the proper
measure of damages.
The Court: The objection will be sustained.
This testimony of Mr. Peevyhouse is difficult for us to follow, even with
the exhibits in the case before us. However, no complaint was made by
plaintiffs, or any suggestion that the court was in error in excluding this
testimony.
[56]
The defendant offered the testimony of five witnesses in the trial
court; four of them testified as to “diminution in value.” They were not
cross examined by plaintiffs.
[57]
In their motion for new trial, plaintiffs did not complain that they
had been prevented from offering evidence as to the diminution in value
of their lands; on the contrary, they affirmatively complained of the trial
court's action in admitting evidence of the defendant on that point.

143

[58]
In the original brief of plaintiffs in error (Peevyhouse) filed in this
court there appears the following language at page 4:
…Near the outset of the trial plaintiffs dismissed their second cause of
action without prejudice: further, it was stipulated…. It was further
stipulated that the only issue remaining in the lawsuit was the proof and measure
of damages to which plaintiffs were entitled…. (Emphasis supplied.)
In the answer brief of Garland Coal & Mining Co., at page 3, there
appears the following language:
Defendant offered evidence that the total value of the property involved
before the mining operation would be $60.00 per acre, and $11.00 per acre
after the mining operation (60 acres at $49.00 per acre is $2940.00). Other
evidence was that the property was worth $5.00 to $15.00 per acre after
the mining, but before the repairs; and would be worth an increase of
$2.00 to $5.00 per acre after the repairs had been made (60 acres at $5.00
per acre is $300.00) (Tr. 96-97, 135, 137-138, 138-141, 143-145, 156, 158).
At page 18 of the same brief there is another statement to the effect that
the ‘amount of diminution in value of the land’ was $300.00.
[59]
About two months after the answer brief was filed in this court,
plaintiffs filed a reply brief. The reply brief makes no reference at all to the
language of the answer brief above quoted and does not deny that the
diminution in value shown by the record amounts to $300.00. On the contrary, it
contains the following language at page 5:
…Plaintiffs in error pointed out in their initial brief that this evidence
concerning land values was objectionable as being incompetent and
refused to cross-examine or offer rebuttal for the reason that they did not
choose to waive their objections to the competency of the evidence by
disproving defendant in error's allegations as to land values. We strongly
urged at the trial below, and still do, that market value of the land has no
application….
[60]
Our extended reference to the pleadings, testimony and prior
briefs in this case has not been solely for the purpose of showing that
plaintiffs failed to complain of the court's rulings. Our purpose, rather, has
been to demonstrate the plan and theory upon which plaintiffs tried their
case below, and upon which they argued it in the prior briefs on appeal.
[61]
The whole record in this case justifies the conclusion that
plaintiffs tried their case upon the theory that the “cost of performance”
would be the sole measure of damages and that they would recognize no

144

other. In view of the whole record in this case and the original briefs on
appeal, we conclude that they so tried it with notice that defendant would
contend for the “diminution in value” rule. The testimony to which they
specifically refer in the petition for rehearing shows that the trial court
properly excluded defendant's evidence concerning lands other than the 60
acres described in the petition because such evidence was not within the scope
of the pleadings. At no time did plaintiffs ask permission to amend their
petition, either with or without prejudice to trial, so as to describe all of
the lands they own or lease, and no evidence was admitted which could
broaden the scope of the petition.
[62]
Plaintiffs' petition described 60 acres of land only; plaintiffs
offered no evidence on the question of “diminution in value” and objected
to similar evidence offered by the defendant; their motion for new trial
contained no allegation that they had been prevented from offering
evidence on this question; in their reply brief they did not controvert the
allegation in defendant's answer brief that the record showed a
“diminution in value” of only $300.00; and in view of the stipulation they
admittedly made in the trial court, their statement in petition for rehearing
that the court's instructions on the measure of damages came as a
“complete surprise” and “did not afford them the opportunity to prepare
and introduce evidence under the ‘diminution in value’ rule” is not
supported by the record.
[63]
We think plaintiffs' present position is that of a plaintiff in any
damage suit who has failed to prove his damages-opposed by a defendant
who has proved plaintiff's damages; and that plaintiffs' complaint that the
record does not show the total “diminution in value” to their lands comes
too late. It is well settled that a party will not be permitted to change his
theory of the case upon appeal. Knox v. Eason Oil Co., 190 Okl. 627, 126
P.2d 247.
[64]
Also, plaintiffs' expressed fear that by introducing evidence on the
question of “diminution in value” they would have waived their objection
to similar evidence by defendant was not justified. Vogel v. Fisher et al., 203
Okl. 657, 225 P.2d 346; 53 Am. Jur. Trial § 144.
[65]
It is suggested in a brief of amici curiae that our decision in this
case has resulted in an impairment of the obligation of the contract of the
parties, in violation of Article 1, Section 10, of the Constitution of the
United States, and in that connection the only case cited is Sturges v.
Crowninshield, 4 Wheat 122, 17 U.S. 1229 (1819). In their brief, amici curiae

145

quote language from the Lawyer's Edition notes of Mr. Stephen K.
Williams, in which he summarized the “points and authorities” of one of
the counsel appearing before the U. S. Supreme Court.
[66]
Sturges v. Crowninshield was an early case in which the Supreme
Court considered the power of a state to enact bankruptcy laws, and the
extent, if any, to which such power is limited by Article 1, Section 10 of
the Constitution. The contracts concerned consisted of promissory notes
executed in March, 1811, and the bankruptcy law under which the
promisor claimed a discharge was not enacted until April 3, 1811. In a
memorable opinion written by Chief Justice Marshall, the court held that
insofar as the bankruptcy law purported to discharge the obligations of
contracts executed before its enactment, it was unconstitutional and void.
[67]
The same situation does not exist here. 23 O.S.1961 §§ 96 and 97,
cited in our original opinion, were a part of the Revised Laws of 1910
(R.L.1910) Sections 2889 and 2890) and have been in force in this state, in
unchanged form, since that codification was adopted by the legislature in
1911. The lease contract concerned in the case now before us was not
executed until 1954.
[68]
Nor do we agree that our decision itself (as opposed to the
statutes cited therein as controlling) impairs the obligations of the contract
concerned. It may be conceded that at one time there was respectable
authority for the proposition that the “contract” clause was violated by a
judicial decision which overruled prior decisions, upon the strength of
which contract rights had been acquired. In this connection, it should be
noted that our decision overrules no prior holdings of this court upon
which the contracting parties could be said to have relied. Even if it did,
… it is now definitely and authoritatively settled that such prohibition in
federal and state constitutions relate to legislative action and not to judicial
decisions. Thus, they do not apply to the decision of a state court, where
such decision does not expressly, or by necessary implication, give effect
to a subsequent law of the state whereby the obligation of the contract is
impaired….
16 C.J.S. Constitutional Law § 280. To the same effect, see 12 Am. Jur.
Constitutional Law § 398.
[69]
Our decision herein overrules no prior holdings of this court, and
it does not give effect to a subsequent law of this state. It therefore cannot
be said to impair the obligations of the contract of the parties here
concerned.

4.2.1 The Story of Peevyhouse
The Peevyhouse decision has not fared well in the court of academic opinion.
In a remarkably thorough historical account of the case, Professor Judith
Maute sharply challenges the Oklahoma Supreme Court’s conclusion that
the agreement to restore the Peevyhouse farm was “merely incidental” to
the main purpose of the contract.
From the Peevyhouses’ perspective, obtaining the
promised remedial work was essential. Having
observed the effects of strip-mining under the
standard arrangement, they agreed to forego
immediate payment of $3000 in consideration for
Garland’s promises of basic reclamation. The leased
acreage was part of their homestead estate and
connected to the land on which they lived but
refused to lease. When placed against this backdrop,
it is clear that the Peevyhouses highly valued the
future utility of the leased land. These fundamental
facts relate to their main purpose, as evidence of the
express bargained-for-exchange, with payment of
separate valuable consideration for remedial
provisions….
Willie and Lucille still live on the land located
outside of Stigler. The land they leased to Garland
has changed little from when the mining stopped
more than thirty-five years ago. About half of the
leased acreage remains unusable.

Judith Maute, Peevyhouse v. Garland Coal & Mining Co. Revisited: The
Ballad of Willie and Lucille, 89 NW. L. REV. 1341, 1413, 1404 (1995) (The
article’s 146 pages include photos, diagrams and poetry, among other
curiosities.).
Other commentators have expressed similar views about the case:
When people enter into contracts, they also may be
motivated by non-monetary considerations. The end
to be achieved by performance may be desired in
and of itself, not as a means to an increase in wealth
measured by conventional methods of valuation.
Consider the well-known case of Peevyhouse v. Garland

147

Coal & Mining Co. …. If the land was important to
them as a home as well as a source of income, the
loss caused them by breach could not be measured
solely by a reduction in market value. Any economic
analysis that assigns no value to their love of home
or treats the promise to restore the land as merely
instrumental to protecting the market value is
incapable of measuring the true costs and benefits of
breach.

Peter Linzer, On the Amorality of Contract Remedies—Efficiency, Equity,
and the Second Restatement, 81 COLUM. L. REV. 111, 117 (1981).
4.2.2 Rock Island Improvement Company v. Sexton
Criticism of Peevyhouse has not been limited to ivory tower academics. In
Rock Island Improvement Company v. Sexton, 698 F.2d 1075 (10th Cir. 1983), a
panel of the United States Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit opined
that they were “convinced that the Oklahoma Supreme Court would no
longer apply the rule it established in Peevyhouse in 1963 if it had the instant
dispute before it …. Although we are bound by decisions of a state
supreme court in diversity cases, we need not adhere to a decision if we
think it no longer would be followed.” Id. at 1078.
It took more than a decade for the Oklahoma Supreme Court to respond,
but in Schneberger v. Apache Corp., 890 P.2d 847 (Okla. 1995), that court
decisively rejected Rock Island and reaffirmed its Peevyhouse holding. The
Tenth Circuit had “misinterpreted” Oklahoma law, and the Oklahoma
Supreme Court asserted that the “essence of the Peevyhouse holding—to
award diminution in value rather than cost of performance—has been
consistently adhered to in cases giving rise to temporary and permanent
injuries to property.” Id. at 851.
4.2.3 The Restatement (Second) on Cost vs. Value
Although the Restatement does not speak directly to the situation in
American Standard and Peevyhouse, § 347 provides that the loss in value of
performance caused by a breach is ordinarily the proper measure of the
promisee’s expectation interest. Section 348 offers “alternatives to loss in
value of performance” for specific situations. Most nearly relevant to the
issues we have been addressing is the following subsection of § 348:
(2) If a breach results in defective or unfinished
construction and the loss in value to the injured
party is not proved with sufficient certainty, he may
recover damages based on

148

(a) the diminution in the market price of the property
caused by the breach, or
(b) the reasonable cost of completing performance or of
remedying the defects if that cost is not clearly
disproportionate to the probable loss in value to him.
Thus, subsection 2(a) specifies the remedy adopted in Peevyhouse and
subsection 2(b) includes the limitation that caused the Oklahoma Supreme
Court to reject a cost-of-performance measure in that case.
4.2.4 Discussion of American Standard v. Schectman and
Peevyhouse v. Garland Coal
Consider whether it is the facts of these cases or the applicable legal
standards that produce diametrically opposite results in American Standard
and Peevyhouse. One possible explanation for the ruling in Peevyhouse is that
the court wishes to avoid “economic waste.” As the court explains:
The situations presented are artificial ones. It is
highly unlikely that the ordinary property owner
would agree to pay $29,000 (or its equivalent) for the
construction of “improvements” upon his property
that would increase its value only about ($300) three
hundred dollars.

Thus, one might argue that to award the cost of performance in cases such
as these will cause economic waste.
Suppose for the sake of discussion that in both American Standard and
Peevyhouse the cost of completing the contractually specified grading work
far exceeds its value to the landowner. Can you think of any reason to
doubt that ordering Garland Coal or Schectman to perform or pay damages
equal to the cost of performing will cause any economic waste?
Conversely one might object to a value of performance measure in cases
such as these on the ground that the landowner has already paid for the
cost of restoration in the original contract price. But consider how that
price is likely to vary according to whether courts tend to award cost of
performance or value of performance damages. If the price depends on the
choice of legal rule, can we infer from the original contract prices in these
cases anything about which rule is best?
Now consider the possibility that both cases were wrongly decided.
What did American Standard receive as a result of the remedy awarded in
that case? What exactly was American Standard seeking under the express

149

terms of the contract? Is it possible that the promisor’s breach was an
efficient response to unforeseen difficulties it encountered while removing
the subsurface foundations? If so, could a cost of performance measure
potentially impede efficient breach?
What do the Peevyhouses receive under the Oklahoma Supreme Court’s
ruling? What did they seek from this contract with Garland Coal? Are there
any terms in the agreement that could support the court’s conclusion that
the restoration provisions were “merely incidental”? How would you advise
landowners like the Peevyhouses to protect themselves in the future?
Is there any way to reconcile our desire to protect fully a promisor’s
expectation interest with some courts’ evident concern about
overcompensation?

5 Liquidated Damages
We conclude our study of contracts with the surprisingly stringent rules
restricting the use of liquidated damages. Both the UCC and the
Restatement (Second) of Contracts permit parties to specify contractually
the damages recoverable for breach. However, the relevant sections also
impose significant constraints. Liquidated damages become an
unenforceable “penalty” unless they satisfy a doctrinal test that involves two
broad inquiries. First, the clause must specify an amount that is a reasonable
estimate at the time of contracting of the likely damages resulting from
breach. Second, the party seeking enforcement of the clause must establish
a need for estimation such as uncertainty about the likely loss or anticipated
difficulty proving the loss.
Here is what the Restatement has to say on the subject:
§ 356. Liquidated Damages and Penalties
(1) Damages for breach by either party may be liquidated
in the agreement but only at an amount that is reasonable
in light of the anticipated or actual loss caused by the
breach and the difficulties of proof of loss. A term fixing
unreasonably large liquidated damages is unenforceable on
grounds of public policy as a penalty.
(2) A term in a bond providing for an amount of money as
a penalty for non-occurrence of the condition of the bond
is unenforceable on grounds of public policy to the extent

150

that the amount exceeds the loss caused by such nonoccurrence.
Comment:
a. Liquidated damages or penalty. The parties to a contract may
effectively provide in advance the damages that are to be
payable in the event of breach as long as the provision
does not disregard the principle of compensation. The
enforcement of such provisions for liquidated damages
saves the time of courts, juries, parties and witnesses and
reduces the expense of litigation. This is especially
important if the amount in controversy is small. However,
the parties to a contract are not free to provide a penalty
for its breach. The central objective behind the system of
contract remedies is compensatory, not punitive.
Punishment of a promisor for having broken his promise
has no justification on either economic or other grounds
and a term providing such a penalty is unenforceable on
grounds of public policy. The rest of the agreement
remains enforceable, however, under the rule stated in
§ 184(1), and the remedies for breach are determined by
the rules stated in this Chapter. A term that fixes an
unreasonably small amount as damages may be
unenforceable as unconscionable. See § 208. As to the
liquidation of damages and modification or limitation of
remedies in contracts of sale, see Uniform Commercial
Code §§ 2-718, 2-719.
b. Test of penalty. Under the test stated in Subsection (1),
two factors combine in determining whether an amount of
money fixed as damages is so unreasonably large as to be a
penalty. The first factor is the anticipated or actual loss
caused by the breach. The amount fixed is reasonable to
the extent that it approximates the actual loss that has
resulted from the particular breach, even though it may not
approximate the loss that might have been anticipated
under other possible breaches. Furthermore, the amount
fixed is reasonable to the extent that it approximates the
loss anticipated at the time of the making of the contract,
even though it may not approximate the actual loss. The
second factor is the difficulty of proof of loss. The greater
the difficulty either of proving that loss has occurred or of

151

establishing its amount with the requisite certainty (see §
351), the easier it is to show that the amount fixed is
reasonable. To the extent that there is uncertainty as to the
harm, the estimate of the court or jury may not accord
with the principle of compensation any more than does
the advance estimate of the parties. A determination
whether the amount fixed is a penalty turns on a
combination of these two factors. If the difficulty of proof
of loss is great, considerable latitude is allowed in the
approximation of anticipated or actual harm. If, on the
other hand, the difficulty of proof of loss is slight, less
latitude is allowed in that approximation. If, to take an
extreme case, it is clear that no loss at all has occurred, a
provision fixing a substantial sum as damages is
unenforceable.
c. Disguised penalties. Under the rule stated in this Section,
the validity of a term providing for damages depends on
the effect of that term as interpreted according to the rules
stated in Chapter 9. Neither the parties' actual intention as
to its validity nor their characterization of the term as one
for liquidated damages or a penalty is significant in
determining whether the term is valid. Sometimes parties
attempt to disguise a provision for a penalty by using
language that purports to make payment of the amount an
alternative performance under the contract, that purports
to offer a discount for prompt performance, or that
purports to place a valuation on property to be delivered.
Although the parties may in good faith contract for
alternative performances and fix discounts or valuations, a
court will look to the substance of the agreement to
determine whether this is the case or whether the parties
have attempted to disguise a provision for a penalty that is
unenforceable under this Section. In determining whether
a contract is one for alternative performances, the relative
value of the alternatives may be decisive.
d. Related types of provisions. This Section does not purport to
cover the wide variety of provisions used by parties to
control the remedies available to them for breach of
contract. A term that fixes as damages an amount that is
unreasonably small does not come within the rule stated in
this Section, but a court may refuse to enforce it as

152

unconscionable under the rule stated in § 208. A mere
recital of the harm that may occur as a result of a breach of
contract does not come within the rule stated in this
Section, but may increase damages by making that harm
foreseeable under the rule stated § 351. As to the effect of
a contract provision on the right to equitable relief, see
Comment a to § 359. As to the effect of a term requiring
the occurrence of a condition where forfeiture would
result, see § 229. Although attorneys' fees are not generally
awarded to the winning party, if the parties provide for the
award of such fees the court will award a sum that it
considers to be reasonable. If, however, the parties specify
the amount of such fees, the provision is subject to the test
stated in this Section.
e. Penalties in bonds. Bonds often fix a flat sum as a penalty
for non-occurrence of the condition of the bond. A term
providing for a penalty is not unenforceable in its entirety
but only to the extent that it exceeds the loss caused by the
non-occurrence of the condition.
The parallel provisions of the Uniform Commercial Code follow:
§ 2-718 Liquidation or Limitation of Damages;
Deposits.
1) Damages for breach by either party may be liquidated in
the agreement but only at an amount which is reasonable
in the light of the anticipated or actual harm caused by the
breach, the difficulties of proof of loss, and the
inconvenience or nonfeasibility of otherwise obtaining an
adequate remedy. A term fixing unreasonably large
liquidated damages is void as a penalty.
In the cases that follow, see if you can discern the underlying policy
reasons for courts’ evident reluctance to enforce contractually specified
damages.

5.1 Principal Case – Lake River Corp. v. Carborundum Co.
Lake River Corp. v. Carborundum Co.
United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit
769 F.2d 1284 (1985)
POSNER, CIRCUIT JUDGE.
[1] This diversity suit between Lake River Corporation and
Carborundum Company requires us to consider questions of Illinois
commercial law, and in particular to explore the fuzzy line between
penalty clauses and liquidated-damages clauses.
[2] Carborundum manufactures “Ferro Carbo,” an abrasive powder
used in making steel. To serve its midwestern customers better,
Carborundum made a contract with Lake River by which the latter
agreed to provide distribution services in its warehouse in Illinois.
Lake River would receive Ferro Carbo in bulk from Carborundum,
“bag” it, and ship the bagged product to Carborundum's customers.
The Ferro Carbo would remain Carborundum's property until
delivered to the customers.
[3] Carborundum insisted that Lake River install a new bagging
system to handle the contract. In order to be sure of being able to
recover the cost of the new system ($89,000) and make a profit of 20
percent of the contract price, Lake River insisted on the following
minimum-quantity guarantee:
In consideration of the special equipment [i.e., the
new bagging system] to be acquired and furnished by
LAKE-RIVER for handling the product,
CARBORUNDUM shall, during the initial threeyear term of this Agreement, ship to LAKE-RIVER
for bagging a minimum quantity of [22,500 tons]. If,
at the end of the three-year term, this minimum
quantity shall not have been shipped, LAKE-RIVER
shall invoice CARBORUNDUM at the then
prevailing rates for the difference between the
quantity bagged and the minimum guaranteed.
[4] If Carborundum had shipped the full minimum quantity that it
guaranteed, it would have owed Lake River roughly $533,000 under
the contract.
[5] After the contract was signed in 1979, the demand for domestic
steel, and with it the demand for Ferro Carbo, plummeted, and
Carborundum failed to ship the guaranteed amount. When the

154

contract expired late in 1982, Carborundum had shipped only 12,000
of the 22,500 tons it had guaranteed. Lake River had bagged the
12,000 tons and had billed Carborundum for this bagging, and
Carborundum had paid, but by virtue of the formula in the minimumguarantee clause Carborundum still owed Lake River $241,000—the
contract price of $533,000 if the full amount of Ferro Carbo had been
shipped, minus what Carborundum had paid for the bagging of the
quantity it had shipped.
[6] When Lake River demanded payment of this amount,
Carborundum refused, on the ground that the formula imposed a
penalty. At the time, Lake River had in its warehouse 500 tons of
bagged Ferro Carbo, having a market value of $269,000, which it
refused to release unless Carborundum paid the $241,000 due under
the formula. Lake River did offer to sell the bagged product and place
the proceeds in escrow until its dispute with Carborundum over the
enforceability of the formula was resolved, but Carborundum rejected
the offer and trucked in bagged Ferro Carbo from the East to serve its
customers in Illinois, at an additional cost of $31,000.
[7] Lake River brought this suit for $241,000, which it claims as
liquidated damages. Carborundum counterclaimed for the value of the
bagged Ferro Carbo when Lake River impounded it and the additional
cost of serving the customers affected by the impounding. The theory
of the counterclaim is that the impounding was a conversion, and not
as Lake River contends the assertion of a lien. The district judge, after
a bench trial, gave judgment for both parties. Carborundum ended up
roughly $42,000 to the good: $269,000 + $31,000-$241,000-$17,000,
the last figure representing prejudgment interest on Lake River's
damages. (We have rounded off all dollar figures to the nearest
thousand.) Both parties have appealed.
[8] The only issue that is not one of damages is whether Lake River
had a valid lien on the bagged Ferro Carbo that it refused to ship to
Carborundum's customers—that, indeed, it holds in its warehouse to
this day. Although Ferro Carbo does not deteriorate with age, the
domestic steel industry remains in the doldrums and the product is
worth less than it was in 1982 when Lake River first withheld it. If
Lake River did not have a valid lien on the product, then it converted
it, and must pay Carborundum the $269,000 that the Ferro Carbo was
worth back then.
[9] It might seem that if the minimum-guarantee clause was a penalty
clause and hence unenforceable, the lien could not be valid, and

155

therefore that we should discuss the penalty issue first. But this is not
correct. If the contractual specification of damages is invalid, Lake
River still is entitled to any actual damages caused by Carborundum's
breach of contract in failing to deliver the minimum amount of Ferro
Carbo called for by the contract. The issue is whether an entitlement
to damages, large or small, entitles the victim of the breach to assert a
lien on goods that are in its possession though they belong to the
other party.
[10] Lake River has not been very specific about the type of lien it
asserts. We think it best described as a form of artisan's lien, the “lien
of the bailee, who does work upon or adds materials to chattels....”
Restatement of Security § 61, comment on clause (a), at p. 165 (1941).
Lake River was the bailee of the Ferro Carbo that Carborundum
delivered to it, and it did work on the Ferro Carbo—bagging it, and
also storing it (storage is a service, too). If Carborundum had refused
to pay for the services that Lake River performed on the Ferro Carbo
delivered to it, then Lake River would have had a lien on the Ferro
Carbo in its possession, to coerce payment. Cf. National Bank of Joliet v.
Bergeron Cadillac, Inc., 66 Ill.2d 140, 143-44, 5 Ill. Dec. 588, 589, 361
N.E.2d 1116, 1117 (1977). But in fact, when Lake River impounded
the bagged Ferro Carbo, Carborundum had paid in full for all bagging
and storage services that Lake River had performed on Ferro Carbo
shipped to it by Carborundum. The purpose of impounding was to
put pressure on Carborundum to pay for services not performed,
Carborundum having failed to ship the Ferro Carbo on which those
services would have been performed.
[11] Unlike a contractor who, having done the work contracted for
without having been paid, may find himself in a box, owing his
employees or suppliers money he does not have—money he was
counting on from his customer—Lake River was the victim of a
breach of a portion of the contract that remained entirely unexecuted
on either side. Carborundum had not shipped the other 10,500 tons,
as promised; but on the other hand Lake River had not had to bag
those 10,500 tons, as it had promised. It is not as if Lake River had
bagged those tons, incurring heavy costs that it expected to recoup
from Carborundum, and then Carborundum had said, “Sorry, we
won't pay you; go ahead and sue us.”
[12] A lien is strong medicine; it clogs up markets, as the facts of this
case show. Its purpose is to provide an effective self-help remedy for
one who has done work in expectation of payment and then is not
paid. The vulnerable position of such a person gives rise to “the

156

artisan's privilege of holding the balance for work done in the past.”
United States v. Toys of the World Club, Inc., 288 F.2d 89, 94 (2d Cir.1961)
(Friendly, J.) (emphasis added). A lien is thus a device for preventing
unjust enrichment—not for forcing the other party to accede to your
view of a contract dispute. “The right to retain possession of the
property to enforce a possessory lien continues until such time as the
charges for such materials, labor and services are paid.” Bull v. Mitchell,
448 N.E.2d 1016, 1019 (Ill. App. 1983); cf. Ill.Rev.Stat. ch. 82, § 40.
Since here the charges were paid before the lien was asserted, the lien
was no good.
[13] Lake River tries to compare its position to that of a conventional
lien creditor by pointing out that it made itself particularly vulnerable
to a breach of contract by buying specialized equipment at
Carborundum's insistence, to the tune of $89,000, before performance
under the contract began. It says it insisted on the minimum guarantee
in order to be sure of being able to amortize this equipment over a
large enough output of bagging services to make the investment
worthwhile. But the equipment was not completely useless for other
contracts—Lake River having in fact used it for another contract; it
was not the major cost of fulfilling the contract; and Lake River
received almost $300,000 during the term of the contract, thus
enabling it to amortize much of the cost of the special equipment.
Although Lake River may have lost money on the contract (but as yet
there is no proof it did), it was not in the necessitous position of a
contractor who completes his performance without receiving a dime
and then is told by his customer to sue for the price. The recognition
of a lien in such a case is based on policies akin to those behind the
rule that a contract modification procured by duress will not be
enforced. See, e.g., Selmer Co. v. Blakeslee-Midwest Co., 704 F.2d 924 (7th
Cir.1983). When as a practical matter the legal remedy may be
inadequate because it operates too slowly, self-help is allowed. But we
can find no case recognizing a lien on facts like these, no ground for
thinking that the Illinois Supreme Court would be the first court to
recognize such a lien if this case were presented to it, and no reason to
believe that the recognition of such a lien would be a good thing. It
would impede the marketability of goods without responding to any
urgent need of creditors.
[14] Conrow v. Little, 22 N.E. 346, 347 (N.Y. 1889), on which Lake
River relies heavily because the lien allowed in that case extended to
“money expended in the preparation of instrumentalities,” is not in
point. The plaintiffs, dealers in paper, had made extensive deliveries to

157

the defendants for which they had received no payment. See id. at 39091, 22 N.E. at 346. If Lake River had bagged several thousand tons of
Ferro Carbo without being paid anything, it would have had a lien on
the Ferro Carbo; and maybe—if Conrow is good law in Illinois, a
question we need not try to answer—the lien would have included not
only the contract price for the Ferro Carbo that Lake River had
bagged but also the unreimbursed, unsalvageable cost of the special
bagging system that Lake River had installed. But that is not this case.
Carborundum was fully paid up and Lake River has made no effort to
show how much if any money it stood to lose because the bagging
system was not fully amortized. The only purpose of the lien was to
collect damages which would have been unrelated to—and certainly
exceeded—the investment in the bagging system.
[15] It is no answer that the bagging system should be presumed to
have been amortized equally over the life of the contract, and
therefore to have been only half amortized when Carborundum broke
the contract. Amortization is an accounting device; it need not reflect
cash flows. There is no evidence that when the contract was broken,
Lake River was out of pocket a cent in respect of the bagging system,
especially when we consider that the bagging system was still usable,
and was used to fulfill another contract.
[16] The hardest issue in the case is whether the formula in the
minimum-guarantee clause imposes a penalty for breach of contract or
is merely an effort to liquidate damages. Deep as the hostility to
penalty clauses runs in the common law, see Loyd, Penalties and
Forfeitures, 29 HARV. L. REV. 117 (1915), we still might be inclined to
question, if we thought ourselves free to do so, whether a modern
court should refuse to enforce a penalty clause where the signator is a
substantial corporation, well able to avoid improvident commitments.
Penalty clauses provide an earnest of performance. The clause here
enhanced Carborundum's credibility in promising to ship the
minimum amount guaranteed by showing that it was willing to pay the
full contract price even if it failed to ship anything. On the other side it
can be pointed out that by raising the cost of a breach of contract to
the contract breaker, a penalty clause increases the risk to his other
creditors; increases (what is the same thing and more, because
bankruptcy imposes “deadweight” social costs) the risk of bankruptcy;
and could amplify the business cycle by increasing the number of
bankruptcies in bad times, which is when contracts are most likely to
be broken. But since little effort is made to prevent businessmen from
assuming risks, these reasons are no better than makeweights.

158

[17] A better argument is that a penalty clause may discourage efficient
as well as inefficient breaches of contract. Suppose a breach would
cost the promisee $12,000 in actual damages but would yield the
promisor $20,000 in additional profits. Then there would be a net
social gain from breach. After being fully compensated for his loss the
promisee would be no worse off than if the contract had been
performed, while the promisor would be better off by $8,000. But now
suppose the contract contains a penalty clause under which the
promisor if he breaks his promise must pay the promisee $25,000. The
promisor will be discouraged from breaking the contract, since
$25,000, the penalty, is greater than $20,000, the profits of the breach;
and a transaction that would have increased value will be forgone.
[18] On this view, since compensatory damages should be sufficient to
deter inefficient breaches (that is, breaches that cost the victim more
than the gain to the contract breaker), penal damages could have no
effect other than to deter some efficient breaches. But this overlooks
the earlier point that the willingness to agree to a penalty clause is a
way of making the promisor and his promise credible and may
therefore be essential to inducing some value-maximizing contracts to
be made. It also overlooks the more important point that the parties
(always assuming they are fully competent) will, in deciding whether to
include a penalty clause in their contract, weigh the gains against the
costs—costs that include the possibility of discouraging an efficient
breach somewhere down the road—and will include the clause only if
the benefits exceed those costs as well as all other costs.
[19] On this view the refusal to enforce penalty clauses is (at best)
paternalistic—and it seems odd that courts should display parental
solicitude for large corporations. But however this may be, we must be
on guard to avoid importing our own ideas of sound public policy into
an area where our proper judicial role is more than usually deferential.
The responsibility for making innovations in the common law of
Illinois rests with the courts of Illinois, and not with the federal courts
in Illinois. And like every other state, Illinois, untroubled by academic
skepticism of the wisdom of refusing to enforce penalty clauses
against sophisticated promisors, see, e.g., Goetz & Scott, Liquidated
Damages, Penalties and the Just Compensation Principle, 77 COLUM. L. REV.
554 (1977), continues steadfastly to insist on the distinction between
penalties and liquidated damages. See, e.g., Bauer v. Sawyer, 134 N.E.2d
329, 333-34 (Ill. 1956); Stride v. 120 West Madison Bldg. Corp., 477
N.E.2d 1318, 1321 (Ill. App. 1985); Builder's Concrete Co. v. Fred Faubel
& Sons, Inc., 373 N.E.2d 863, 869 (Ill. App. 1978). To be valid under

159

Illinois law a liquidation of damages must be a reasonable estimate at
the time of contracting of the likely damages from breach, and the
need for estimation at that time must be shown by reference to the
likely difficulty of measuring the actual damages from a breach of
contract after the breach occurs. If damages would be easy to
determine then, or if the estimate greatly exceeds a reasonable upper
estimate of what the damages are likely to be, it is a penalty. See, e.g.,
M.I.G. Investments, Inc. v. Marsala, 414 N.E.2d 1381, 1386 (Ill. App.
1981).
[20] The distinction between a penalty and liquidated damages is not
an easy one to draw in practice but we are required to draw it and can
give only limited weight to the district court's determination. Whether
a provision for damages is a penalty clause or a liquidated-damages
clause is a question of law rather than fact, Weiss v. United States Fidelity
& Guaranty Co., 132 N.E. 749, 751 (Ill. 1921); M.I.G. Investments, Inc. v.
Marsala, supra, 414 N.E.2d 1381, 1386, and unlike some courts of
appeals we do not treat a determination by a federal district judge of
an issue of state law as if it were a finding of fact, and reverse only if
persuaded that clear error has occurred, though we give his
determination respectful consideration. See, e.g., Morin Bldg. Products
Co. v. Baystone Construction, Inc., 717 F.2d 413, 416-17 (7th Cir.1983); In
re Air Crash Disaster Near Chicago, 701 F.2d 1189, 1195 (7th Cir.1983);
19 WRIGHT, MILLER & COOPER, FEDERAL PRACTICE AND
PROCEDURE § 4507, at pp. 106-110 (1982).
[21] Mindful that Illinois courts resolve doubtful cases in favor of
classification as a penalty, see, e.g., Stride v. 120 West Madison Bldg.
Corp., supra, 477 N.E.2d at 1321; Pick Fisheries, Inc. v. Burns Electronic
Security Services, Inc., 342 N.E.2d 105, 108 (Ill. App. 1976), we conclude
that the damage formula in this case is a penalty and not a liquidation
of damages, because it is designed always to assure Lake River more
than its actual damages. The formula—full contract price minus the
amount already invoiced to Carborundum—is invariant to the gravity
of the breach. When a contract specifies a single sum in damages for
any and all breaches even though it is apparent that all are not of the
same gravity, the specification is not a reasonable effort to estimate
damages; and when in addition the fixed sum greatly exceeds the
actual damages likely to be inflicted by a minor breach, its character as
a penalty becomes unmistakable. See M.I.G. Investments, Inc. v. Marsala,
supra, 414 N.E.2d at 1386; cf. Arduini v. Board of Educ., 418 N.E.2d 104,
109-10 (Ill. App. 1981), rev'd on other grounds, 441 N.E.2d 73 (Ill. 1982);
5 CORBIN ON CONTRACTS § 1066 (1964). This case is within the

160

gravitational field of these principles even though the minimumguarantee clause does not fix a single sum as damages.
[22] Suppose to begin with that the breach occurs the day after Lake
River buys its new bagging system for $89,000 and before
Carborundum ships any Ferro Carbo. Carborundum would owe Lake
River $533,000. Since Lake River would have incurred at that point a
total cost of only $89,000, its net gain from the breach would be
$444,000. This is more than four times the profit of $107,000 (20
percent of the contract price of $533,000) that Lake River expected to
make from the contract if it had been performed: a huge windfall.
[23] Next suppose (as actually happened here) that breach occurs
when 55 percent of the Ferro Carbo has been shipped. Lake River
would already have received $293,000 from Carborundum. To see
what its costs then would have been (as estimated at the time of
contracting), first subtract Lake River's anticipated profit on the
contract of $107,000 from the total contract price of $533,000. The
difference—Lake River's total cost of performance—is $426,000. Of
this, $89,000 is the cost of the new bagging system, a fixed cost. The
rest ($426,000-$89,000 = $337,000) presumably consists of variable
costs that are roughly proportional to the amount of Ferro Carbo
bagged; there is no indication of any other fixed costs. Assume,
therefore, that if Lake River bagged 55 percent of the contractually
agreed quantity, it incurred in doing so 55 percent of its variable costs,
or $185,000. When this is added to the cost of the new bagging
system, assumed for the moment to be worthless except in connection
with the contract, the total cost of performance to Lake River is
$274,000. Hence a breach that occurred after 55 percent of contractual
performance was complete would be expected to yield Lake River a
modest profit of $19,000 ($293,000-$274,000). But now add the
“liquidated damages” of $241,000 that Lake River claims, and the
result is a total gain from the breach of $260,000, which is almost two
and a half times the profit that Lake River expected to gain if there
was no breach. And this ignores any use value or salvage value of the
new bagging system, which is the property of Lake River—though
admittedly it also ignores the time value of money; Lake River paid
$89,000 for that system before receiving any revenue from the
contract.
[24] To complete the picture, assume that the breach had not occurred
till performance was 90 percent complete. Then the “liquidated
damages” clause would not be so one-sided, but it would be onesided. Carborundum would have paid $480,000 for bagging. Against

161

this, Lake River would have incurred its fixed cost of $89,000 plus 90
percent of its variable costs of $337,000, or $303,000. Its total costs
would thus be $392,000, and its net profit $88,000. But on top of this
it would be entitled to “liquidated damages” of $53,000, for a total
profit of $141,000—more than 30 percent more than its expected
profit of $107,000 if there was no breach.
[25] The reason for these results is that most of the costs to Lake
River of performing the contract are saved if the contract is broken,
and this saving is not reflected in the damage formula. As a result, at
whatever point in the life of the contract a breach occurs, the damage
formula gives Lake River more than its lost profits from the breach—
dramatically more if the breach occurs at the beginning of the
contract; tapering off at the end, it is true. Still, over the interval
between the beginning of Lake River's performance and nearly the
end, the clause could be expected to generate profits ranging from 400
percent of the expected contract profits to 130 percent of those
profits. And this is on the assumption that the bagging system has no
value apart from the contract. If it were worth only $20,000 to Lake
River, the range would be 434 percent to 150 percent.
[26] Lake River argues that it would never get as much as the formula
suggests, because it would be required to mitigate its damages. This is
a dubious argument on several grounds. First, mitigation of damages is
a doctrine of the law of court-assessed damages, while the point of a
liquidated-damages clause is to substitute party assessment; and that
point is blunted, and the certainty that liquidated-damages clauses are
designed to give the process of assessing damages impaired, if a
defendant can force the plaintiff to take less than the damages
specified in the clause, on the ground that the plaintiff could have
avoided some of them. It would seem therefore that the clause in this
case should be read to eliminate any duty of mitigation, that what Lake
River is doing is attempting to rewrite the clause to make it more
reasonable, and that since actually the clause is designed to give Lake
River the full damages it would incur from breach (and more) even if
it made no effort to find a substitute use for the equipment that it
bought to perform the contract, this is just one more piece of evidence
that it is a penalty clause rather than a liquidated-damages clause. See
Northwest Collectors, Inc. v. Enders, 446 P.2d 200, 206 (Wash. 1968).
[27] But in any event mitigation would not mitigate the penal character
of this clause. If Carborundum did not ship the guaranteed minimum
quantity, the reason was likely to be—the reason was—that the steel
industry had fallen on hard times and the demand for Ferro Carbo was

162

therefore down. In these circumstances Lake River would have little
prospect of finding a substitute contract that would yield it significant
profits to set off against the full contract price, which is the method by
which it proposes to take account of mitigation. At argument Lake
River suggested that it might at least have been able to sell the new
bagging equipment to someone for something, and the figure $40,000
was proposed. If the breach occurred on the first day when
performance under the contract was due and Lake River promptly
sold the bagging equipment for $40,000, its liquidated damages would
fall to $493,000. But by the same token its costs would fall to $49,000.
Its profit would still be $444,000, which as we said was more than 400
percent of its expected profit on the contract. The penal component
would be unaffected.
[28] With the penalty clause in this case compare the liquidateddamages clause in Arduini v. Board of Education, supra, which is
representative of such clauses upheld in Illinois. The plaintiff was a
public school teacher whose contract provided that if he resigned
before the end of the school year he would be docked 4 percent of his
salary. This was a modest fraction of the contract price. And the cost
to the school of an untimely resignation would be difficult to measure.
Since that cost would be greater the more senior and experienced the
teacher was, the fact that the liquidated damages would be greater the
higher the teacher's salary did not make the clause arbitrary. Even the
fact that the liquidated damages were the same whether the teacher
resigned at the beginning, the middle, or the end of the school year
was not arbitrary, for it was unclear how the amount of actual damages
would vary with the time of resignation. Although one might think
that the earlier the teacher resigned the greater the damage to the
school would be, the school might find it easier to hire a replacement
for the whole year or a great part of it than to bring in a replacement
at the last minute to grade the exams left behind by the resigning
teacher. Here, in contrast, it is apparent from the face of the contract
that the damages provided for by the “liquidated damages” clause are
grossly disproportionate to any probable loss and penalize some
breaches much more heavily than others regardless of relative cost.
[29] We do not mean by this discussion to cast a cloud of doubt over
the “take or pay” clauses that are a common feature of contracts
between natural gas pipeline companies and their customers. Such
clauses require the customer, in consideration of the pipeline's
extending its line to his premises, to take a certain amount of gas at a
specified price—and if he fails to take it to pay the full price anyway.

163

The resemblance to the minimum-guarantee clause in the present case
is obvious, but perhaps quite superficial. Neither party has mentioned
take-or-pay clauses, and we can find no case where such a clause was
even challenged as a penalty clause—though in one case it was argued
that such a clause made the damages unreasonably low. See National
Fuel Gas Distribution Corp. v. Pennsylvania Public Utility Comm'n, 464 A.2d
546, 558 n. 8 (Pa. Comm.1983). If, as appears not to be the case here
but would often be the case in supplying natural gas, a supplier's fixed
costs were a very large fraction of his total costs, a take-or-pay clause
might well be a reasonable liquidation of damages. In the limit, if all
the supplier's costs were incurred before he began supplying the
customer, the contract revenues would be an excellent measure of the
damages from breach. But in this case, the supplier (Lake River,
viewed as a supplier of bagging services to Carborundum) incurred
only a fraction of its costs before performance began, and the
interruption of performance generated a considerable cost saving that
is not reflected in the damage formula.
[30] The fact that the damage formula is invalid does not deprive Lake
River of a remedy. The parties did not contract explicitly with
reference to the measure of damages if the agreed-on damage formula
was invalidated, but all this means is that the victim of the breach is
entitled to his common law damages. See, e.g., Restatement, Second,
Contracts § 356, comment a (1981). In this case that would be the
unpaid contract price of $241,000 minus the costs that Lake River
saved by not having to complete the contract (the variable costs on the
other 45 percent of the Ferro Carbo that it never had to bag). The case
must be remanded to the district judge to fix these damages.
[31] Two damage issues remain. The first concerns Carborundum's
expenses of delivering bagged Ferro Carbo to its customers to replace
that impounded by Lake River. The district judge gave Carborundum
the full market value of the bagged Ferro Carbo. Lake River argues
that it should not have to pay for Carborundum's expense of selling
additional Ferro Carbo—additional in the sense that Carborundum is
being given credit for the full retail value of the product that Lake
River withheld. To explain, suppose that Carborundum had an order
for $1,000 worth of bagged Ferro Carbo, which Lake River was
supposed to deliver; and because it refused, Carborundum incurred a
transportation cost of $100 to make a substitute shipment of bagged
Ferro Carbo to the customer. Carborundum would still get $1,000
from the customer, and if that price covered the transportation cost it
would still make a profit. In what sense, therefore, is that cost a

164

separate item of damage, of loss? On all Ferro Carbo (related to this
case) sold by Carborundum in the Midwest, Carborundum received
the full market price, either from its customers in the case of Ferro
Carbo actually delivered to them, or from Lake River in the case of the
Ferro Carbo that Lake River refused to deliver. Having received a
price designed to cover all expenses of sale, a seller cannot also get an
additional damage award for any of those expenses.
[32] If, however, the additional Ferro Carbo that Carborundum
delivered to its midwestern customers in substitution for Ferro Carbo
previously delivered to, and impounded by, Lake River would have
been sold in the East at the same price but lower cost, Carborundum
would have had an additional loss, in the form of reduced profits, for
which it could recover additional damages. But it made no effort to
prove such a loss. Maybe it had no unsatisfied eastern customers, and
expanded rather than shifted output to fulfill its midwestern
customers' demand. The damages on the counterclaim must be
refigured also.
[33] Finally, Lake River argues that Carborundum failed to mitigate its
damages by accepting Lake River's offer to deliver the bagged product
and place the proceeds in escrow. But a converter is not entitled to
retain the proceeds of the conversion even temporarily. Lake River
had an opportunity to limit its exposure by selling the bagged product
on Carborundum's account and deducting what it claimed was due it
on its “lien.” Its failure to follow this course reinforces our conclusion
that the assertion of the lien was a naked attempt to hold
Carborundum hostage to Lake River's view—an erroneous view, as it
has turned out—of the enforceability of the damage formula in the
contract.
[34] The judgment of the district court is affirmed in part and reversed
in part, and the case is returned to that court to redetermine both
parties' damages in accordance with the principles in this opinion. The
parties may present additional evidence on remand, and shall bear
their own costs in this court. Circuit Rule 18 shall not apply on
remand.

5.2 Principal Case – C & H Sugar Co. v. Sun Ship
California and Hawaiian Sugar Co. v. Sun Ship, Inc.
United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit
794 F.2d 1433 (1986)
NOONAN, CIRCUIT JUDGE.
[1] Jurisdiction in this case is based on the diversity of citizenship of
California and Hawaiian Sugar Company (C and H), a California
corporation; Sun Ship, Inc. (Sun), a Pennsylvania corporation; and
Halter Marine, Inc. (Halter), a Louisiana corporation. Interpreting a
contract which provides for construction by the law of Pennsylvania,
we apply Pennsylvania law. The appeal is from a judgment of the
district court in favor of C and H and Halter on the main issues.
Reviewing the district court's interpretation of the contract anew as a
matter of law and respecting the findings of fact of the district court
when not clearly erroneous, we affirm the judgment in all respects.
BACKGROUND
[2] C and H is an agricultural cooperative owned by fourteen sugar
plantations in Hawaii. Its business consists in transporting raw sugar—
the crushed cane in the form of coarse brown crystal—to its refinery
in Crockett, California. Roughly one million tons a year of sugar are
harvested in Hawaii. A small portion is refined there; the bulk goes to
Crockett. The refined sugar—the white stuff—is sold by C and H to
groceries for home consumption and to the soft drink and cereal
companies that are its industrial customers.
[3] To conduct its business, C and H has an imperative need for
assured carriage for the raw sugar from the islands. Sugar is a seasonal
crop, with 70 percent of the harvest occurring between April and
October, while almost nothing is harvestable during December and
January. Consequently, transportation must not only be available, but
seasonably available. Storage capacity in Hawaii accommodates not
more than a quarter of the crop. Left stored on the ground or left
unharvested, sugar suffers the loss of sucrose and goes to waste.
Shipping ready and able to carry the raw sugar is a priority for C and
H.
[4] In 1979 C and H was notified that Matson Navigation Company,
which had been supplying the bulk of the necessary shipping, was
withdrawing its services as of January 1981. While C and H had some
ships at its disposal, it found a pressing need for a large new vessel, to
be in service at the height of the sugar season in 1981. It decided to

166

commission the building of a kind of hybrid—a tug of catamaran
design with two hulls and, joined to the tug, a barge with a wedge
which would lock between the two pontoons of the tug, producing an
“integrated tug barge.” In Hawaiian, the barge and the entire vessel
were each described as a Mocababoo or push boat.
[5] C and H relied on the architectural advice of the New York firm,
J.J. Henry. It solicited bids from shipyards, indicating as an essential
term a “preferred delivery date” of June 1981. It decided to accept
Sun's offer to build the barge and Halter's offer to build the tug.
[6] In the fall of 1979 C and H entered into negotiations with Sun on
the precise terms of the contract. Each company was represented by a
vice-president with managerial responsibility in the area of negotiation;
each company had a team of negotiators; each company had the
advice of counsel in drafting the agreement that was signed on
November 14, 1979. This agreement was entitled “Contract for the
Construction of One Oceangoing Barge for California and Hawaiian
Sugar Company By Sun Ship, Inc.” The “Whereas” clause of the
contract identified C and H as the Purchaser, and Sun as the
Contractor; it identified “one non-self-propelled oceangoing barge” as
the Vessel that Purchaser was buying from Contractor. Article I
provided that Contractor would deliver the Vessel on June 30, 1981.
The contract price was $25,405,000.
[7] Under Article I of the agreement, Sun was entitled to an extension
of the delivery date for the usual types of force majeure and for
“unavailability of the Tug to Contractor for joining to the Vessel,
where it is determined that Contractor has complied with all
obligations under the Interface Agreement.” (The Interface
Agreement, executed the same day between C and H, Sun, and Halter
provided that Sun would connect the barge with the tug.) Article 17
“Delivery” provided that “the Vessel shall be offered for delivery fully
and completely connected with the Tug.” Article 8, “Liquidated
Damages for Delay in Delivery” provided that if “Delivery of the
Vessel” was not made on “the Delivery Date” of June 30, 1981, Sun
would pay C and H “as per-day liquidated damages, and not as a
penalty” a sum described as “a reasonable measure of the damages”—
$17,000 per day.
[8] On the same date C and H entered into an agreement with Halter
to purchase “one oceangoing catamaran tug boat” for $20,350,000.
The tug (the “Vessel” of that contract) was to be delivered on April

167

30, 1981 at Sun's shipyard. Liquidated damages of $10,000 per day
were provided for Halter's failure to deliver.
[9] Halter did not complete the tug until July 15, 1982. Sun did not
complete the barge until March 16, 1982. Tug and barge were finally
connected under C and H's direction in mid-July 1982 and christened
the Moku Pahu. C and H settled its claim against Halter. Although Sun
paid C and H $17,000 per day from June 30, 1981 until January 10,
1982, it ultimately denied liability for any damages, and this lawsuit
resulted.
ANALYSIS
[10] Sun contends that its obligation was to deliver the barge
connected to the tug on the delivery date of June 30, 1981 and that
only the failure to deliver the integrated hybrid would have triggered
the liquidated damage clause. It is true that Article 17 creates some
ambiguity by specifying that the Vessel is to be “offered for delivery
completely connected with the Tug.” The case of the barge being
ready while the tug was not, is not explicitly considered. Nonetheless,
the meaning of “Vessel” is completely unambiguous. From the
“Whereas” clause to the articles of the agreement dealing with
insurance, liens, and title, “the Vessel” is the barge. It would require
the court to rewrite the contract to find that “the Vessel” in Article 8
on liquidated damages does not mean the barge. The article takes
effect on failure to deliver “the Vessel”—that is, the barge.
[11] Sun contends, however, that on such a reading of the contract,
the $17,000 per day is a penalty, not to be enforced by the court. The
barge, Sun points out, was useless to C and H without the tug.
Unconnected, the barge was worse than useless—it was an expensive
liability. C and H did not want the barge by itself. To get $17,000 per
day as “damages” for failure to provide an unwanted and unusable
craft is, Sun says, to exact a penalty. C and H seeks to be “paid
according to the tenour of the bond”; it “craves the law.” And if C
and H sticks to the letter of the bond, it must like Shylock end by
losing; a court of justice will not be so vindictive. Breach of contract
entitles the wronged party only to fair compensation.
[12] Seductive as Sun's argument is, it does not carry the day.
Represented by sophisticated representatives, C and H and Sun
reached the agreement that $17,000 a day was the reasonable measure
of the loss C and H would suffer if the barge was not ready. Of course
they assumed that the tug would be ready. But in reasonable
anticipation of the damages that would occur if the tug was ready and

168

the barge was not, Article 8 was adopted. As the parties foresaw the
situation, C and H would have a tug waiting connection but no barge
and so no shipping. The anticipated damages were what might be
expected if C and H could not transport the Hawaiian sugar crop at
the height of the season. Those damages were clearly before both
parties. As Joe Kleschick, Sun's chief negotiator, testified, he had “a
vision” of a “mountain of sugar piling up in Hawaii”—a vision that C
and H conjured up in negotiating the damage clause. Given the
anticipated impact on C and H's raw sugar and on C and H's ability to
meet the demands of its grocery and industrial customers if the sugar
could not be transported, liquidated damages of $17,000 a day were
completely reasonable.
[13] The situation as it developed was different from the anticipation.
The barge was not ready but neither was the tug. C and H was in fact
able to find other shipping. The crop did not rot. The customers were
not left sugarless. Sun argues that, measured by the actual damages
suffered, the liquidated damages were penal.
[14] We look to Pennsylvania law for guidance. Although no
Pennsylvania case is squarely on point, it is probable that Pennsylvania
would interpret the contract as a sale of goods governed by the
Uniform Commercial Code. Belmont Industries, Inc. v. Bechtel Corp., 425
F. Supp. 524, 527 (E.D.Pa.1976). The governing statute provides that
liquidated damages are considered reasonable “in the light of
anticipated or actual harm.” 12A Pa. Cons. Stat. Ann. 2-718(1)
(Purdon 1970) (Pennsylvania's adoption of the Uniform Commercial
Code).
[15] The choice of the disjunctive appears to be deliberate. The
language chosen is in harmony with the Restatement (Second) of
Contracts § 356 (1979), which permits liquidated damages in the light
of the anticipated or actual loss caused by the breach and the
difficulties of proof of loss. Section 356, Comment b declares
explicitly: “Furthermore, the amount fixed is reasonable to the extent
that it approximates the loss anticipated at the time of the making of
the contract, even though it may not approximate the actual loss.”
[16] Despite the statutory disjunctive and the Restatement's apparent
blessing of it, the question is not settled by these authorities which
must be read in the light of common law principles already established
and accepted in Pennsylvania. Carpel v. Saget Studios, Inc., 326 F. Supp.
1331, 1333 (E.D. Pa.1971); 13 Pa. C.S.A. § 1103. Prior to the adoption
of the Uniform Commercial Code, Pennsylvania enforced liquidated

169

damage clauses that its courts labeled as nonpenal, but equitable
considerations relating to the actual harm incurred were taken into
account along with the difficulty of proving damages if a liquidated
damage clause was rejected, e.g. Emery v. Boyle, 200 Pa. 249, 49 A. 779
(1901). We do not believe that the U.C.C. overrode this line of
reasoning. Indeed, in a lower court case, decided after the U.C.C.'s
enactment, it was stated that if liquidated damages appear
unreasonable in light of the harm suffered, “the contractual provision
will be voided as a penalty.” Unit Vending Corp. v. Tobin Enterprises, 194
Pa. Super. 470, 473, 168 A.2d 750, 751 (1961). That case, however, is
not on all fours with our case: Unit Vending involved an adhesion
contract between parties of unequal bargaining power; the unfair
contract was characterized by the court as “a clever attempt to secure
both the penny and the cake” by the party with superior strength. Id.
at 476, 168 A.2d at 753. Mechanically to read it as Pennsylvania law
governing this case would be a mistake. The case, however, does show
that Pennsylvania courts, like courts elsewhere, attempt to interpret
the governing statute humanely and equitably.
[17] The Restatement § 356 Comment b, after accepting anticipated
damages as a measure, goes on to say that if the difficulty of proof of
loss is slight, then actual damage may be the measure of
reasonableness: “If, to take an extreme case, it is clear that no loss at
all has occurred, a provision fixing a substantial sum as damages is
unenforceable. See Illustration 4.” Illustration 4 is a case of a
contractor, A, agreeing to build B's race track by a specific date and to
pay B $1,000 a day for every day's delay. A delays a month, but B does
not get permission to operate the track for that month, so B suffers no
loss. In that event, the Restatement characterizes the $1,000 per day as
an unenforceable penalty. Sun contends that it is in the position of A:
no actual loss was suffered by C and H because C and H had no tug to
mate with the barge.
[18] This argument restates in a new form Sun's basic contention that
the liquidated damage clause was meant to operate only if the
integrated tug barge was not delivered. The argument has been
rejected by us as a misinterpretation of the contract. But in its new
guise it gains appeal. If Illustration 4 is the present case, Sun is home
scot-free. The Restatement, however, deals with a case where the
defaulting contractor was alone in his default. We deal with a case of
concurrent defaults. If we were to be so literal-minded as to follow the
Restatement here, we would have to conclude that because both
parties were in default, C and H suffered no damage until one party

170

performed. Not until the barge was ready in March 1982 could C and
H hold Halter for damages, and then only for the period after that
date. The continued default of both parties would operate to take each
of them off the hook. That cannot be the law.
[19] Sun objects that Halter had a more absolute obligation to deliver
than Sun did. Halter did not have to deliver the integrated tug, only
the tug itself; it was not excused by Sun's default. Hence the spectacle
of two defaulting contractors causing no damages would not be
presented here. But Sun's objection does not meet the point that
Halter's unexcused delivery would, on Sun's theory, have generated no
damages. The tug by itself would have been no use to C and H.
[20] We conclude, therefore, that in this case of concurrent causation
each defaulting contractor is liable for the breach and for the
substantial damages which the joint breach occasions. Sun is a
substantial cause of the damages flowing from the lack of the
integrated tug; Sun cannot be absolved by the absence of the tug.
[21] Sun has a final argument. Even on the assumption that it is liable
as a substantial cause of the breach of contract, Sun contends that the
actual damages suffered by C and H for lack of the integrated tug boat
were slight. Actual damages were found by the district court to consist
of “interest on progress payments, unfavorable terms of conversion to
long-term financing, and additional labor expense.” No dollar amount
was determined by the district court in finding that these damages
“bore a reasonable relationship to the amount liquidated in the Barge
Contract.”
[22] The dollar value of the damages found by the district judge is, to
judge from C and H's own computation, as follows:

Additional Construction Interest

$1,486,000

Added Payments to J.J. Henry

161,000

Added Vessel Operating Expenses

73,000

C and H Employee Costs

109,000

TOTAL

$1,829,000

But “actual damages” have no meaning if the actual savings of C and
H due to the nondelivery of the integrated tug barge are not
subtracted. It was clearly erroneous for the district judge to exclude
these savings from his finding. These savings, again according to C
and H's own computation, were:

171

Transportation savings

$525,000

Lay-up costs

$936,000

TOTAL

$1,461,000

The net actual damages suffered by C and H were $368,000. As a
matter of law, Sun contends that the liquidated damages are
unreasonably disproportionate to the net actual damages.
[23] C and H urges on us the precedent of Bellefonte Borough Authority v.
Gateway Equipment & Supply Co., 442 Pa. 492, 277 A.2d 347 (1971),
forfeiting a bid bond of $45,000 on the failure of a contractor to
perform a municipal contract, even though the loss to the municipality
was $1,000; the disproportion was 45 to 1. But that decision is not
decisive here. It did not purport to apply the Uniform Commercial
Code. Rules appropriate for bids to the government are sufficiently
different from those applicable between private parties to prevent
instant adoption of this precedent. A fuller look at relevant contract
law is appropriate.
[24] Litigation has blurred the line between a proper and a penal
clause, and the distinction is “not an easy one to draw in practice.”
Lake River Corp. v. Carborundum Co., 769 F.2d 1284, 1290 (7th Cir.1985)
(per Posner, J.). But the desire of courts to avoid the enforcement of
penalties should not obscure common law principles followed in
Pennsylvania. Contracts are contracts because they contain
enforceable promises, and absent some overriding public policy, those
promises are to be enforced. “Where each of the parties is content to
take the risk of its turning out in a particular way” why should one “be
released from the contract, if there were no misrepresentation or other
want of fair dealing?” Ashcom v. Smith, 2 Pen. & W. 211, 218-219 (Pa.
1830) (per Gibson, C.J.). Promising to pay damages of a fixed amount,
the parties normally have a much better sense of what damages can
occur. Courts must be reluctant to override their judgment. Where
damages are real but difficult to prove, injustice will be done the
injured party if the court substitutes the requirements of judicial proof
for the parties' own informed agreement as to what is a reasonable
measure of damages. Pennsylvania acknowledges that a seller is bound
to pay consequential damages if the seller had reason to know of the
buyer's special circumstances. Keystone Diesel Engine Co. v. Irwin, 411 Pa.
222, 191 A.2d 376 (1963). The liquidated damage clause here functions
in lieu of a court's determination of the consequential damages
suffered by C and H.

172

[25] These principles inform a leading common law case in the field,
Clydebank Engineering & Shipbuilding Co. v. Yzquierdo y Castaneda, 1905
A.C. 6. The defendant shipyard had agreed to pay 500 pounds per
week per vessel for delay in the delivery of four torpedo boat
destroyers to the Spanish Navy in 1897. The shipyard pointed out that
had the destroyers been delivered on schedule they would have been
sunk with the rest of the Spanish Navy by the Americans in 1898. The
House of Lords found the defense unpersuasive. To prove damages
the whole administration of the Spanish Navy would have had to have
been investigated. The House of Lords refused to undertake such a
difficult investigation when the parties had made an honest effort in
advance to set in monetary terms what the lack of the destroyers
would mean to Spain.
[26] C and H is not the Spanish Navy, but the exact damages caused
its manifold operations by lack of the integrated tug boat are equally
difficult of ascertainment. C and H claimed that it suffered $3,732,000
in lost charter revenues. Testimony supported the claim, but the
district court made no finding as to whether the claim was proved or
unproved. The district court did find that the loss of charter revenues
had not been anticipated by the parties. But that finding has no
bearing on whether the loss occurred. Within the general risk of heavy
losses forecast by both parties when they agreed to $17,000 per day
damages, a particular type of loss was pointed to by C and H as having
happened.
[27] Proof of this loss is difficult—as difficult, perhaps, as proof of
loss would have been if the sugar crop had been delivered late because
shipping was missing. Whatever the loss, the parties had promised
each other that $17,000 per day was a reasonable measure. The court
must decline to substitute the requirements of judicial proof for the
parties' own conclusion. The Moku Pahu, available on June 30, 1981,
was a great prize, capable of multiple employments and enlarging the
uses of the entire C and H fleet. When sophisticated parties with
bargaining parity have agreed what lack of this prize would mean, and
it is now difficult to measure what the lack did mean, the court will
uphold the parties' bargain. C and H is entitled to keep the liquidated
damages of $3,298,000 it has already received and to receive additional
liquidated damages of $1,105,000 with interest thereon, less setoffs
determined by the district court.
[28] On the comparatively minor issue as to whether C and H is
entitled to arbitration of its claim for a contract price reduction, Article
32 of the contract provides for arbitration of all disputes arising out of

173

the contract with exceptions not applicable here. But no dispute
remains for arbitration. The district court found that Sun was excused
from performing its mating obligations because the tug was not made
available on March 11, 1982 when the barge was ready. C and H is not
entitled to reimbursement from Sun for the costs it incurred in having
the mating performed later by others. C and H was entitled to
reimbursement for what it had paid Sun itself for the mating. But on
the point system agreed to by the parties, this work represented 100
points out of possible 10,000 or 1 percent of the contract price.
According to testimony offered on behalf of C and H, Sun credited C
and H with a sum representing these 100 points. C and H's claim has
been met. Arbitration is unnecessary.
[29] Sun has counterclaimed against C and H and Halter for
misrepresentation, charging that the two companies had concealed
from Sun the true progress on the tug. The alleged damages consist in
the expenses Sun incurred trying to meet its own contractual
obligations to build the barge. This counterclaim lacks plausibility on
its face. No damage is inflicted on a party which is induced to perform
its own contract. The cases Sun invokes to support its position involve
“active interference” by one party with another party's performance.
They have no applicability here.
[30] Uncontradicted testimony indicates, moreover, that Sun was
aware of the delay. Employees of Sun were in touch with Halter. It
would have been surprising if they had not been. Sun attempts to get
around its actual knowledge by contending that it was not officially
informed of the tug's progress. But the kind of knowledge that
precludes the possibility of fraud does not have to be officially
conveyed. Sun's counterclaim is meritless.
AFFIRMED.

5.2.1 Economic Justifications for Liquidated Damages
Recall from Restatement § 356, comment a, the assertion that:
The parties to a contract are not free to provide a
penalty for its breach. The central objective behind
the system of contract remedies is compensatory,
not punitive. Punishment of a promisor for having
broken his promise has no justification on either
economic or other grounds and a term providing
such a penalty is unenforceable on grounds of public
policy.

174

In their influential article on the subject, however, Professors Goetz and
Scott challenge courts’ hostility to liquidated damages clauses and explain
several important economic justifications for enforcing contractually
stipulated damages. The following excerpt summarizes their argument:
[C]ontracting parties have incentives to negotiate
liquidated damages clauses whenever the costs of
negotiating are less than the expected costs resulting
from reliance on the standard damage rule for
breach. There are two primary factors which might
induce the decision to negotiate:

(1) The expected damages are readily calculable, but the
parties determine that advance stipulation will save litigation
or settlement costs;
(2) The expected damages are uncertain or difficult to
establish and the parties wish to allocate anticipated risks.
Of course, these factors may be present singly or in
combination.
Pre-breach agreements will not be legally
enforceable, however, unless two requirements
coincide. First, the agreement must be a reasonable
forecast of just compensation for the anticipated
harm that would be caused by the breach. Second,
the possible damages which might result from the
breach must be uncertain and difficult to estimate.
However, liquidated damages provisions have
seldom been voided solely because the damages were
easy to estimate. Instead, courts have considered the
degree of uncertainty an influential factor in
determining the reasonableness of the estimate. If
the conditions inducing damage agreements are
viewed on a continuum, the application of the
penalty rule becomes clearer: as the uncertainty
facing the contracting parties increases, so does their
latitude in stipulating post-breach damages.xxxix
The threat of subsequent review clearly increases the
costs of negotiating a damages clause relative to
relying on the standard damages rule. Are these costs
accompanied by counterbalancing advantages? The
traditional justification for post-breach inquiry is
prevention of “unjust” punishment to the breacher,
i.e. compensation exceeding the harm actually
caused. This justification has been expressed in two

175

distinct forms. One basis for invalidation is the
presumption of unfairness: liquidated damage
provisions are unreasonable—a penalty—whenever
the stipulated sum is so disproportionate to provable
damages as to require the inference that the
agreement must have been effected by fraud,
oppression, or mistake. The other major basis for
invalidating agreed remedies is that, since the courts
set damages based upon the principle of just
compensation, parties should not be allowed to
recover more than just compensation from the
courts through a privately concocted alternative
arrangement, even one fairly negotiated.
The common theme of these decisions is that a
disproportion between the stipulated and the
anticipated damage justifies an inference of
overcompensation. In turn, overcompensation
implies either bargaining unfairness or an
objectionable in terrorem agreement to secure
performance. This line of reasoning suggests two
benefits which may be expected from the current
rule invalidating penalties. First, the cost of
identifying unfairness may be reduced by a standard
rule-of-thumb based on disproportion. Second, an
enforceable in terrorem clause might discourage
promisors from breaching and reallocating resources
where changed circumstances would ordinarily
create efficiency gains from this behavior. Inducing
performance under these conditions is a
misallocation which prevents the net social gain that
would result from nonperformance.
[T]his analysis incorrectly assumes that, rather than
negotiating out of the penalty, the promisor who is
subject to an in terrorem clause will inevitably
undertake an inefficient performance. In addition,
there is no basis for the apparent assumption that
the premium placed by the promisee on
performance is valueless. Indeed, the market
paradigm on which the compensation standard is
based requires a contrary presumption; a promisee
has a recognizable utility in certain in terrorem
provisions and this utility is frequently reflected in
willingness to pay a price for such clauses.

5.2.2 Discussion of C & H Sugar Co. v. Sun Ship and Lake
River
What factors lead Judge Noonan to enforce the liquidated damages clause
against Sun Ship?
Can you develop an argument that would raise doubt about whether the
contractually specified damages were a reasonable estimate of the losses
that C & H Sugar would be likely to suffer from breach? In this connection,
consider what damages the company recovers when either Halter or Sun
Ship breaches as compared to the damages recoverable when both suppliers
breach.
Notice that Goetz and Scott claim in a footnote that “many cases have held
that actual loss is irrelevant except as it permits inferences concerning the
reasonableness of the agreements viewed ex ante.” Is C & H Sugar one of
those cases? How does the court use the evidence of actual losses in
analyzing the parties’ liquidated damages clauses?
How about Lake River? Does Judge Posner approach the question from an
ex ante or ex post perspective?
Can you identify the policy basis for courts’ reluctance to enforce liquidated
damages clauses?

The End

177

Endnotes

178

Corbin suggests that, even in situations where the court concludes that it would
not have been natural for the parties to make the alleged collateral oral agreement,
parol evidence of such an agreement should nevertheless be permitted if the court
is convinced that the unnatural actually happened in the case being adjudicated. (3
Corbin, Contracts, § 485, pp. 478, 480; cf. Murray, The Parol Evidence Rule: A
Clarification (1966) 4 Duquesne L. Rev. 337, 341-342.) This suggestion may be based
on a belief that judges are not likely to be misled by their sympathies. If the court
believes that the parties intended a collateral agreement to be effective, there is no
reason to keep the evidence from the jury.

See Goble v. Dotson (1962) 203 Cal.App.2d 272, 21 Cal. Rptr. 769, where the deed
given by a real estate developer to the plaintiffs contained a condition that
grantees would not build a pier or boathouse. Despite this reference in the deed to
the subject of berthing for boats, the court allowed plaintiffs to prove by parol
evidence that the condition was agreed to in return for the developer's oral
promise that plaintiffs were to have the use of two boat spaces nearby.
ii

Counsel for plaintiffs direct our attention to numerous cases that they contend
establish that parol evidence may never be used to show a collateral agreement
contrary to a term that the law presumes in the absence of an agreement. In each
of these cases, however, the decision turned upon the court's belief that the
writing was a complete integration and was no more than an application of the
rule that parol evidence cannot be used to vary the terms of a completely
integrated agreement. (Cf. discussion in Mangini v. Wolfschmidt, Ltd., supra, 165
Cal.App.2d 192, 203, 331 P.2d 728.) In Gardiner v. McDonogh, supra, 147 Cal. 313,
319, 81 P. 964, defendants sought to prove a collateral agreement that beams sold
them were to conform to a sample earlier given. The court purportedly looked
only to the face of the writing to decide whether parol evidence was admissible,
and such evidence would be excluded if the writing was ‘clear and complete.’
Defendants argued that the written order was not complete because it did not fix
a time and place of delivery, but the court answered that the failure to state those
terms did not result in incompleteness because the law would supply them by
implication. This decision was based on the belief that the question of
admissibility had to be decided from that face of the instrument alone. Virtually
every writing leaves some terms to be implied and almost none would qualify as
integrations without implying some terms. The decision was therefore a product
of an outmoded approach to the parol evidence rule, not of any compulsion to
give conclusive effect to presumptions of implied terms.
iii

In that year the Legislature set forth the rule in sections 1625 of the Civil Code
and 1856 of the Code of Civil Procedure.

option was in the form of a reservation in a deed; however, in legal effect it

The opinion continues: ‘The terms and purpose of a contract may show,
however, that it was intended to be nonassignable.’ With this qualification of the
general rule I am in accord, but here it is inapplicable as language indicating any
intention whatever to restrict assignability is completely nonexistent.

Section 1044: ‘Property of any kind may be transferred, except as otherwise
provided by this Article.’ The only property the article provides cannot be
transferred is ‘A mere possibility, not coupled with an interest.’ (s 1045.)
viii

Section 1458: ‘A right arising out of an obligation is the property of the person to
whom it is due, and may be transferred as such.’
Thus in American Industrial Sales Corp. v. Airscope, Inc. (1955) 44 Cal.2d 393, 397,
282 P.2d 504, 49 A.L.R.2d 1344, the contract was silent as to the place of payment
for property purchased; in Crawford v. France (1933) 219 Cal. 439, 443, 27 P.2d 645,
a contract for an architect's fee based upon the cost of a building was silent as to
such cost; in Buckner v. A. Leon & Co. (1928) 204 Cal. 225, 227, 267 P. 693, a
contract for sale and purchase of grapes was silent as to which party was to
furnish the lug boxes required for delivery; in Sivers v. Sivers (1893) 97 Cal. 518,
521, 32 P. 571, a written agreement to repay money loaned was silent as to the
time for payment; and Simmons v. California Institute of Technology (1949) 34 Cal.2d
264, 274(9), 209 P.2d 581, was a case of fraud in the inducement and not one of
parol evidence to show a promise or agreement inconsistent with the written
contract.
ix

It is the Legislature of this state which did the formulating of the rule governing
parol evidence nearly a century ago when in 1872, as previously noted, sections
1625 of the Civil Code and 1856 of the Code of Civil Procedure were adopted.
And as already shown herein, the rule has since been consistently applied by the
courts of this state. The parol evidence rule as thus laid down by the Legislature
and applied by the courts is the policy of this state.
x

Although the majority declare that this first ‘policy’ may be served by excluding
parol evidence of agreements that directly contradict the writing, such
contradiction is precisely the effect of the agreement sought to be shown by parol
in this case.
xi

‘If the additional terms are such that, if agreed upon, they would certainly have
been included in the document in the view of the court, then evidence of their
alleged making must be kept from the trier of fact.’ (Comment 3, § 2-202; italics
added.)

Viz., proof of a collateral agreement should be permitted if it ‘is such an
agreement as might naturally be made as a separate agreement by parties situated
as were the parties to the written contract.’ Restatement of Contracts, § 240, subd.

xiii

Or perhaps application of the new rule will turn upon the opinion of the court
(trial or appellate) that it is “natural” for one family group to agree that in case of
unfriendly approach by a creditor of any of them, then the debtor's property will
be transferable or assignable only to other members of the family, whereas such a
scheme might be considered less than “natural” for other families to pursue.
xiv

Thus in American Industrial Sales Corp. v. Airscope, Inc., supra (1955) 44 Cal.2d 393,
397, 282 P.2d 504, the missing element was the place of payment of a note; in
Richter v. Union Land etc. Co. (1900) 129 Cal. 367, 375, 62 P. 39, the missing element
was the time of delivery; in Wolters v. King (1897) 119 Cal. 172, 175-176, 51 P. 35, it
was the time of payment; and in Mangini v. Wolfschmidt, Ltd., supra (1958) 165
Cal.App.2d 192, 200, 331 P.2d 728, and Zinn v. Ex-Cell-O Corp. (1957) 148

In Farmland Irrigation Co. v. Dopplmaier, supra (1957) 48 Cal.2d 208, 222, 308
P.2d 732, 740, the court in holding that a patent license agreement was assignable
pursuant to the policy “clearly manifested” by “the statutes in this state … in
favor of the free transferability of all types of property, including rights under
contracts,” stated “The terms and purpose of a contract may show, however, that
it was intended to be nonassignable. Thus the duties imposed upon one party may
be of such a personal nature that their performance by someone else would in
effect deprive the other party of that for which he bargained. The duties in such a
situation cannot be delegated.” (Citing La Rue v. Groezinger (1890) 84 Cal. 281, 283285, 286, 24 P. 42, which held that a contract to sell grapes from a certain
vineyard Was assignable to the purchaser of the vineyard, as nothing in the
contract language excluded the “idea of performance by another,” and (p. 287, 24
P. p. 44) there was “nothing in the nature or circumstances … which shows that
the skill or other personal quality of the party was a distinctive characteristic of the
thing stipulated for, or a material inducement to the contract.”)
xvi

As noted at the outset of this dissent, it was by means of the bankrupt's own
testimony that defendants (the bankrupt's sister and her husband) sought to show
that the option was personal to the bankrupt and thus not transferable to the
trustee in bankruptcy.

While article 2 of the Uniform Commercial Code which contains this section
does not deal with the sale of securities, this section applies to article 8, dealing
with securities. (Cf. Agar v. Orda, 264 N. Y. 248; Official Comment, McKinney's
Cons. Laws of N. Y., Book 62 12, Part 1, Uniform Commercial Code, pp. 96-97;

Nowhere is the confusion between legal and moral
ideas more manifest than in the law of contract.
Among other things, here again the so called primary
rights and duties are invested with a mystic
significance beyond what can be assigned and
explained. The duty to keep a contract at common
law means a prediction that you must pay damages if
you do not keep it – and nothing else. If you commit
a tort, you are liable to pay a compensatory sum. If
you commit a contract, you are liable to pay a
compensatory sum unless the promised event comes
to pass, and that is all the difference. But such a
mode of looking at the matter stinks in the nostrils
of those who think it advantageous to get as much
ethics into law as they can.]
PepsiCo argues that Klein has no right to sue on the PepsiCo/UJS contract
because (1) the contract violates the statute of frauds, (2) Klein was not an
intended beneficiary of the contract, and (3) the Klein/UJS contract, from which
Klein derives his right to sue PepsiCo, was rescinded. The district court's
discussion thoroughly and ably treats these claims and rejects them. Based on the
district court's reasoning, this court affirms the disposition of those issues.

§ 400.2-201(3)(c) provides:

(3) A contract which does not satisfy the
requirements (of a writing) but which is valid in
other respects is enforceable
(c) with respect to goods for which payment has
been made and accepted or which have been
received and accepted.

182

Interpreting this section, U.C.C. Comment 2 states:
‘Partial performance’ as a substitute for the required memorandum can validate
the contract only for the goods which have been accepted or for which payment
has been made and accepted. .... If the Court can make a just apportionment, ...,
the agreed price of any goods actually delivered can be recovered without a
writing or, if the price has been paid, the seller can be forced to deliver an
apportionable part of the goods.
Among the identical provisions was the following found in the last paragraph
of Article 2 of the original contract: “We [defendant] shall not be obligated to
utilize your [plaintiff's] services in or in connection with the Photoplay hereunder,
our sole obligation, subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, being
to pay you the guaranteed compensation herein provided for.”
xxiv

Article 29 of the original contract specified that plaintiff approved the director
already chosen for “Bloomer Girl” and that in case he failed to act as director
plaintiff was to have approval rights of any substitute director. Article 31 provided
that plaintiff was to have the right of approval of the “Bloomer Girl” dance
director, and Article 32 gave her the right of approval of the screenplay.
xxv

In this opinion “affidavits” includes “declarations under penalty of perjury.”
(See Code Civ. Proc., § 2015.5.)
xxvi

Although it would appear that plaintiff was not discharged by defendant in the
customary sense of the term, as she was not permitted by defendant to enter upon
performance of the “Bloomer Girl” contract, nevertheless the motion for
summary judgment was submitted for decision upon a stipulation by the parties
that “plaintiff Parker was discharged.”
xxvii

Instead, in each case the reasonableness referred to was that of the efforts of
the employee to obtain other employment that was not different or inferior; his
right to reject the latter was declared as an unqualified rule of law. Thus, Gonzales
v. Internat. Assn. of Machinists, supra., 213 Cal.App.2d 817, 823-824, holds that the
trial court correctly instructed the jury that plaintiff union member, a machinist,
was required to make “such efforts as the average [member of his union] desiring
employment would make at that particular time and place” (italics added); but,
further, that the court properly rejected defendant's offer of proof of the
availability of other kinds of employment at the same or higher pay than plaintiff
usually received and all outside the jurisdiction of his union, as plaintiff could not
be required to accept different employment or a nonunion job.
xxviii

183

The issue is generally discussed in terms of a duty on the part of the employee
to minimize loss. The practice is long-established and there is little reason to
change despite Judge Cardozo's observation of its subtle inaccuracy. “The servant
is free to accept employment or reject it according to his uncensored pleasure.
What is meant by the supposed duty is merely this, that if he unreasonably reject,
he will not be heard to say that the loss of wages from then on shall be deemed
the jural consequence of the earlier discharge. He has broken the chain of
causation, and loss resulting to him thereafter is suffered through his own act.”
(McClelland v. Climax Hosiery Mills (1930) 252 N.Y. 347, 359 [169 N.E. 605, 609],
concurring opinion.)
xxix

This qualification of the rule seems to reflect the simple and humane attitude
that it is too severe to demand of a person that he attempt to find and perform
work for which he has no training or experience. Many of the older cases hold
that one need not accept work in an inferior rank or position nor work which is
more menial or arduous. This suggests that the rule may have had its origin in the
bourgeois fear of resubmergence in lower economic classes.

The earliest California case which the majority cite is de la Falaise v. GaumontBritish Picture Corp., supra., 39 Cal.App.2d at p. 469. de la Falaise states “The other
employment' which the discharged employee is bound to seek is employment of a
character substantially similar to that of which he has been deprived; he need not
enter upon service of a different or inferior kind, ...” de la Falaise cites, in turn, two
sources as authority for this proposition. The first is 18 R.C.L. (Ruling Case law)
529. That digest, however, states only that the “discharged employee ... need not
enter upon service of a more menial kind.” (Italics added.) It was in this form that
the rule entered California law explicitly, Gregg v. McDonald (1925) 73 Cal. App.
748, 757 [239 P. 373], quoting the text verbatim. The second citation is to 28
A.L.R. 737. The author of the annotation states: “The principal question with
which this annotation is concerned is the kind of employment which the
employee is under a duty to seek or accept in order to reduce the damages caused
by his wrongful discharge. Must one who is skilled in some special work he is
employed to do, as an actor, musician, accountant, etc., seek or accept
employment of an entirely different nature?” (Italics added.) (28 A.L.R. 736.) In
answering that question in the negative, the annotation employs the language
adopted by the majority: The employee is “not obliged to seek or accept other
employment of a different or inferior kind, ....” ( Id. at p. 737.) Rather than a
restatement of a generally agreed upon rule, however, the phrase is an
epitomization of the varied formulations found in the cases cited. (See 28 A.L.R.
740-742.)
xxxii

184

The values of the doctrine of mitigation of damages in this context are that it
minimizes the unnecessary personal and social (e.g.. nonproductive use of labor,
litigation) costs of contractual failure. If a wrongfully discharged employee can,
through his own action and without suffering financial or psychological loss in the
process, reduce the damages accruing from the breach of contract, the most
sensible policy is to require him to do so. I fear the majority opinion will
encourage precisely opposite conduct.

matter, the court shall afford each party reasonable opportunity, before the jury is
instructed or before the cause is submitted for decision by the court, to present to
the court information relevant to (1) the propriety of taking judicial notice of the
matter and (2) the tenor of the matter to be noticed.”

xxxviFox

filed two declarations in opposition to the motion; the first is that of
Frank Ferguson, Fox's chief resident counsel. It alleges, in substance, that he has
handled the negotiations surrounding the “Bloomer Girl” contract and its breach;
that the offer to employ plaintiff in “Big Country” was made in good faith and
that Fox would have produced the film if plaintiff had accepted; that by accepting
the second offer plaintiff was not required to surrender any rights under the first
(breached) contract nor would such acceptance have resulted in a modification of
the first contract; that the compensation under the second contract was identical;
that the terms and conditions of the employment were substantially the same and
not inferior to the first; that the employment was in the same general line of work
and comparable to that under the first contract; that plaintiff often makes pictures
on location in various parts of the world; that article 2 of the original contract
which provides that Fox is not required to use the artist's services is a standard
provision in artists' contracts designed to negate any implied covenant that the
film producer promises to play the artist in or produce the film; that it is not
intended to be an advance waiver by the producer of the doctrine of mitigation of
damages.

jointly and severally against both defendants, viz., Harold Schectman, the
contracting party, and the company which issued the performance bond, United
States Fire Insurance Company. Inasmuch as the interests of both defendants
here are identical, for the purpose of this appeal and for the sake of simplicity we
treat the defendants as one: i.e., the contracting party, Harold Schectman. A thirdparty action commenced by the bonding company on an indemnity agreement
between it and defendant Schectman and others is not part of this appeal. The
appeal is also taken from an order denying defendant's motion to set aside the
verdict and for a new trial.

Paragraph 7 of the agreement states in pertinent part: "7. After the Closing
Date, Purchaser shall demolish all of the Improvements on the North Tonawanda
Property included in the sale to Purchaser, cap the water intake at the pumphouse
end, and grade and level the property, all in accordance with the provisions of
Exhibit 'C' and 'C1' attached hereto." Exhibit C (notes on demolition and grading)
contains specifications for the grade levels for four separate areas shown on Map
C1 and the following instruction: "Except as otherwise excepted all structures and
equipment including foundations, piers, headwalls, etc. shall be removed to a
depth approximately one foot below grade lines as set forth above. Area common
to more than one area will be faired to provide reasonable transitions, it being
intended to provide a reasonably attractive vacant plot for resale."
xxxviii

xxxix It appears that the drafters of the Uniform Commercial Code have tacitly
adopted this approach. Section 2-718(1) of the U.C.C. allows parties to liquidate
damages for breach as long as the amount stipulated is “reasonable.” The
reasonableness of a particular amount is determined, in part, by the “difficulties of
proof of loss” from the breach. While it might be argued that the U.C.C. rule
approximates the common law uncertainty requirement, as does the 1 New York
Law Revision Commission, Report of the Law Revision Commission for 1955,
State of New York, Study of the Uniform Commercial Code 581-82, it appears
that a change has been made. The language of U.C.C. § 2-718 itself treats
“uncertainty” as merely one factor, and not even a required one, of many to be
considered in determining reasonableness.

186

In addition to uncertainty, courts have also been influenced by the relationship
between the stipulated amount and the provable harm actually caused by the
breach. Although a number of courts have refused to enforce agreements because
of the absence of provable losses upon breach, many cases have held that actual
loss is irrelevant except as it permits inferences concerning the reasonableness of
the agreements viewed ex ante. Frick Co. v. Rubel Corp., 62 F.2d 765, 767-68 (2d
Cir. 1933); In re Lion Overall Co., 55 F. Supp. 789 (S.D.N.Y. 1943,. aff'd sub nom,
