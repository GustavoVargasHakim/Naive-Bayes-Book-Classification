About the Authors
Beau Steenken joined the Law Library Faculty at the University of
Kentucky in September 2010. As Instructional Services Librarian, he
engaged in a revamp of the Legal Research curriculum as the UK College
of Law shifted from an adjunct-model to a full-time faculty model of LRW
instruction. He teaches two to four sections of 1L Legal Research a year
and also coordinates informal research instruction of various sorts. Before
coming to the University of Kentucky, he managed to collect a B.A., a
J.D., and an M.S.I.S. from the University of Texas, as well as an M.A. in
history from Texas State University and an LL.M. in Public International
law from the University of Nottingham, where he also took up archery.

Tina M. Brooks joined the Law Library Faculty at the University of
Kentucky in July 2011. As Electronic Services Librarian, she manages the
University of Kentucky Law Library’s website and electronic resources and
also teaches two sections of the 1L Legal Research course. She received a
B.A. in History and Spanish from the University of Northern Iowa in
2005, a J.D. from the University of Nebraska College of Law in 2009, and
an M.S. in Information Studies from the University of Texas School of
Information in 2011.

Preface
At its most basic definition the practice of law comprises conducting
research to find relevant rules of law and then applying those rules to the
specific set of circumstances faced by a client. However, in American law,
the legal rules to be applied derive from myriad sources, complicating the
process and making legal research different from other sorts of research.
This text introduces law students to the new kind of research required to
study and to practice law. It seeks to demystify the art of legal research by
following a “Source and Process” approach. First, the text introduces
students to the major sources of American law and describes the forms the
various authorities take in print. After establishing this base, the text
proceeds to instruct students on the tools they will most likely use in
practice, namely electronic research platforms and legal treatises. Finally, the
text illustrates how the different pieces come together in the legal research
process.
The text is intended to be used for introductory legal research courses for
first year law students with little or no experience with legal sources or legal
research. It is the authors’ experience that beginning students better
understand the role of each source of law in the U.S. system if it is
introduced on its own in print form. Students also tend to focus more on
efficient processes if the processes are introduced independently of sources
of law. The organization of the text, therefore, deliberately introduces
sources of law in print before moving on to electronic research techniques,
the use of secondary sources, and the research process. The authors follow
a similar organization in their own research courses but would like to
emphasize that they do so for pedagogical reasons specifically with 1Ls in
mind.

Chapter 1

The United States Legal
System
The simplest form of remedy for the uncertainty of
the regime of primary rules is the introduction of
what we shall call a ‘rule of recognition’… Wherever
such a rule of recognition is accepted, both private
persons and officials are provided with authoritative
criteria for identifying primary rules of obligation. –
H.L.A. Hart, The Concept of Law
We the people of the United States, in order to form
a more perfect union, establish justice, insure
domestic tranquility, provide for the common
defense, promote the general welfare, and secure the
blessings of liberty to ourselves and our posterity, do
ordain and establish this Constitution for the United
States of America. – Preamble to the United States
Constitution

1.1 Learning Objectives for Chapter 1
In working through this chapter, students should strive to be able to:
•

•

Describe key features of the U.S. legal system including:
o

Federalism,

o

Separation of Powers,

o

Sources of Law, and

o

Weight & Hierarchy of Authority.

Assess how the structure of the legal system frames research.

1.2 Introduction to Researching the Law
The practice of law necessarily involves a significant amount of research. In
fact, the average lawyer spends much of her work time researching. This
makes sense when one considers that American law as a field is too vast,
too varied, and too detailed for any one lawyer to keep all of it solely by
memory. Furthermore, the law is a living thing; it tends to change over
time. Thus, in order to answer clients’ legal questions, lawyers typically
conduct research into the laws affecting their clients.
Several things make legal research different from the types of research most
law students performed prior to law school. First, rules of law tend to be
both highly detailed and highly nuanced, so legal research often includes
acts of interpretation even at the research stage. Second, the rules of law
derive from a myriad of sources, many of which may be unfamiliar to
students. Furthermore, because legal research is so important to the practice
of law, the publication of legal materials has long been a profitable field. As
such, there exists a long history of publishing the various sources of law. As
part of the publishing history, legal sources developed their own
information systems. In large part legal information systems predate the
information systems most familiar to students, like the Dewey Decimal
System or Library of Congress Classification. As such, the organization of
legal materials tends to differ from that of other materials. Finally, the
process of legal research itself tends to be different. In other fields,
researchers often investigate ideas in the abstract. In the law, a researcher
must always keep the specific facts of her particular client’s situation in
mind, as a lawyer must always apply the results of her research to her
client’s problem.
Because legal research differs so substantially from other types of research,
the American Bar Association requires that law schools specifically instruct
students in legal research.1 Typically, research instruction occurs in the
context of a Legal Research & Writing (LRW) course. Schools teach legal
research and writing together because the two activities (finding/applying
the law and then communicating the found application) intertwine.
However, legal writing falls outside the scope of this text, which focuses on
the research portion of legal practice.

Throwing students into the deep end by having them read cases without
explanation or context and then teasing understanding out of them via the
Socratic Method remains the educational method of choice for most law
classes. This text will not follow that method. In fact, this text seeks to do
the opposite, namely to provide enough explanation and context to
demystify the art of legal research. By knowing what each of the various
sources of law is, and by knowing how the various types of authority
interact with each other, law students will avoid being overwhelmed by the
level of detail and nuance inherent in the law and will be able to research
the law in a calm, efficient manner.
Thus, this text will introduce and explain the major sources of American
law one at a time. As it does so, it will provide insight into how publishers
arrange the sources of law. Because legal publishers originally developed
their methods of organization before the advent of electronics, each source
of law will be initially introduced by referencing its print form (i.e. actual law
books). Once students become familiar with the sources of law—and so
will know for what they are looking when they research—the text will
proceed to explain the processes of modern legal research, which mostly
involves computer-assisted research.
Before introducing the sources and processes involved in legal research,
however, a few words must be said about the shape and peculiarities of the
United States legal system. After all, it is the unique shape of our system
that gives rise to the different sources of law. Furthermore, lawyers conduct
research to solve legal problems, and those problems play out in the legal
system. You have to know the rules to play the game.

1.3 Federalism
The United States of America employs a federal system of government. As
anyone who follows American politics can tell you, federalism means
different things to different people. However, the legal definition of a
federal state is:
A composite state in which the sovereignty of the
entire state is divided between the central or federal
government and the local governments of the
several constituent states; a union of states in which
the control of the external relations of all the
member states has been surrendered to a central
government so that the only state that exists for

3

international purposes is the one formed by the
union.2

The key point to take away from the definition is that in a federal state two
separate governments share law-making power, or sovereignty, over the
same territory. Of course, federal states differ from one another in precisely
how the central and local governments share law-making power. To
understand how the federal and state governments share sovereignty in the
U.S., one must look to the historical development of federalism in America.

1.3.1 Origins of American Federalism
Prior to declaring independence from Great Britain in 1776, the territory
that became the initial United States of America existed as colonies, at first
of England and later of Great Britain.3 Each of the colonies operated as an
entity under its own charter as a governing document according to English
law. The vast distances of America (especially compared to the relatively
smaller scale of England) combined with the slow speeds of pre-Industrial
Revolution travel to leave each colony effectively governing itself for large
portions of the 17th and 18th centuries.4
When the British government attempted to reassert control over the
colonies in the latter half of the 18th century, the colonies revolted and
eventually won their independence.5 Because of their history of self-rule,
each revolting colony asserted its own sovereignty (thereby rejecting British
sovereignty over America) both during and after the Revolution. However,
in order to coordinate the war effort, each colony sent delegates to a
“Continental Congress” during the Revolution and eventually adopted the

England and Scotland became joined in a “personal union” upon the ascension
of James VI of Scotland as James I of England. They did not officially merge into
the Kingdom of Great Britain until the Acts of Union of 1707: Union with
Scotland Act, 1706, 6 Ann, c.11 (Eng.); Union with England Act, 1707, c.7 (Scot.).

Articles of Confederation6, which remained in force following British
recognition of American independence.
The Articles of Confederation created the United States as a confederation,
which resembles a federal state only with a weaker central government and
more independent local governments.7 Sadly, it turned out that a weak
central government with strong state governments did not adequately
administer such a large swath of territory. In particular, the fledgling United
States struggled economically.8 Thus, less than a decade after ratifying the
Articles of Confederation, the Founding Fathers reconvened to draft what
became the U.S. Constitution.9
However, even though the Founding Fathers acknowledged the need for a
stronger central government, they remained wary of too strong a central
power, as self-rule at the colony/state level had been the whole point of the
Revolution.10 Therefore, while the Constitution creates a strong federal
government, it also specifically limits the application of federal law-making
authority to specific topical competencies.11 State governments, while
subject to federal supremacy in the enumerated competencies12, retain
general sovereignty and so enjoy law-making authority over a wider range of
topics.13 Thus, the federal government possesses “enumerated powers,” or
law-making powers specifically enumerated by the Constitution, while state
governments possess “reserved powers,” or law-making powers over

The revolting colonies borrowed money heavily during the Revolution and so
owed huge sums of money to a number of foreign powers, most notably the

1.3.2 Impact of Federalism on Legal Research
The way in which American federalism splits sovereignty impacts legal
research in a number of ways. First, for any given territorial point in the
United States, a researcher may need to look at two completely different
sets of laws, as both federal law and state law will apply throughout the
same territory. Sometimes a legal researcher will be able to tell at a glance
whether federal or state law will govern an issue, but at other times a
lawyer may need to do initial research just to determine whether to apply
federal or state law (or both) to a client’s problem. For example, federal
law, and federal law only, clearly governs copyright15, a fact familiar to
most lawyers off the tops of their heads. However, the federal
government’s interstate commerce power derives from broader language16,
has expanded over time17, and may affect areas of law typically reserved to
the states. For instance, states typically define and punish crimes, such as
robbery, committed inside their boundaries.18 However, federal law also
criminalizes the robbery of banks, as the federal government insures banks
through the F.D.I.C. under the commerce power.19 Thus, any given legal
problem may necessitate researching multiple sets of law.
Of course, American law comprises many more than two sets of law.
While there is only one federal government, each of the fifty states
produces its own set of law. Even 51 is too small a number to describe the
sets of law contributing to the U.S. legal system. The District of Columbia
possesses its own laws, as do other Federal territories. Furthermore,
American Indian tribes, as “Domestic Dependent Nations,” enjoy a
limited form of sovereignty.20 While no legal problem will likely involve all
possible sets of law in the U.S., legal researchers should remain aware of

the existence of multiple sets. Because most of the sets of law present in
the U.S. evolved from a common ancestor (namely, the law of England),
even if a jurisdiction’s set of laws does not directly apply to a legal
problem, it may contain pieces that help a researcher interpret a different
jurisdiction’s set that does apply.21 This concept will be revisited a bit later
in the discussion on hierarchy of authority in section 1.5.
Federalism impacts legal research not only by providing multiple sets of
laws for which researchers must account, but also by providing multiple
fora for the settling of disputes about the applications of laws. In other
words, in addition to worrying about the possibility of multiple sets of
laws affecting their clients, lawyers need to be aware of the options
presented by multiple, independent court systems operating over the same
geographic area. Sometimes a client may be advantaged by trying a case in
federal court as opposed to state court, or vice versa.
The matter becomes more complicated when one considers the fact that a
jurisdiction’s court system does not necessarily always apply its own set of
laws. For each controversy that comes before it, a court will determine
which jurisdiction’s law should apply. This is known as choice-of-law.22 A
number of factors and guiding principles determine what set of laws a
court should apply, but for purposes of legal research it is important to
remember that federal courts, while largely interpreting federal law, also
sometimes interpret and apply state law. Similarly, while a state’s court
system most typically interprets the state’s own laws, it will sometimes
need to apply federal laws, or even the laws of another state.
Choice-of-law matters to the legal researcher because some cases will
involve applying bits of multiple sets of laws to the same facts. For
example, a criminal defendant facing prosecution under state law may raise
a federal constitutional defense. In such a case, the way the bits of law
interact with each other changes depending upon which court system tries
the case. Before we can cover more detail on the interaction between bits
of law, however, we need to examine where those bits, or sources, of law

There are a few notable exceptions to the proposition that American law
evolved from English Common Law. Louisiana’s law derived from the French
civil law system. Also, a number of states, primarily in the American Southwest,
feature elements of Spanish property law, and are known as “Community
Property” states. Finally, rather obviously, American Indian legal systems did not
evolve from English law.

originate by looking at the other key feature of the U.S. Legal System:
Separation of Powers.

1.4 Separation of Powers and Sources of Law
At the same time that the Founding Fathers, in drafting the Constitution,
limited the central government to enumerated powers, they also broke the
federal government into three distinct branches. They did so in the hopes
that the various branches would serve as checks and balances on each
other and prevent the sort of tyranny that the former colonists rejected
from the unified British government.23 This type of government structure
is called Separation of Powers, which is defined as:
The division of governmental authority into three
branches of government—legislative, executive, and
judicial—each with specified duties on which neither
of the other branches can encroach.24

Subsequent to the creation of the federal government with the U.S.
Constitution, each of the states in the United States adopted similar
provisions in their own constitutions. Indeed, every state government in the
U.S. features Separation of Powers.
American government, therefore, features three distinct branches at both
the state and federal levels: the legislative branch, the judicial branch, and
the executive branch. In the process of governing, each of the branches
contributes rules to the body of law of its jurisdiction. The term “sources of
law” refers to the different forms the various rules take.25. The legislative
branch passes statutes, the judicial branch issues opinions, and the executive
branch drafts regulations. However, a constitution underpins each of the
other sources and serves as the ultimate source of law.

1.4.1 Constitutions
Scholars often describe the United States legal system as a legally positivist
system. Legal positivism is a theory of jurisprudence that essentially states

decisions were made, see CATHERINE DRINKER BOWEN, MIRACLE AT
PHILADELPHIA: THE STORY OF THE CONSTITUTIONAL CONVENTION MAY TO
SEPTEMBER 1787 (1966).

that all law is human-made and is only valid in a state because people accept
that it is.26 H. L. A. Hart, a twentieth century British legal philosopher,
wrote perhaps the clearest articulation of legal positivism in his seminal
work, The Concept of Law, which was quoted at the beginning of this chapter.
Part of Hart’s theory of legal positivism involves a “rule of recognition,”
which alerts citizens of a jurisdiction to the validity of its laws.27
For a legal rule in the U.S. to be valid, it must have been created by a
process described by the applicable constitution. Thus, in the United States,
the U.S. Constitution serves as the rule of recognition for the federal
government. Similarly, state constitutions serve as the rules of recognition
for their respective state governments. Under positivism, constitutions
derive their authority from the will and acceptance of the people. Thus, for
the American legal researcher constitutions represent the ultimate source of
law.
Of course, our constitutions do flesh out the processes by which our
governments may create other sources of law. We have already seen how
constitutions separate the various American governments into three distinct
branches. Logically enough, the constitutions also provide each branch a
method by which it can create legal rules.

1.4.2 Statutes
Under the American system of Separation of Powers as described by the
various constitutions, the legislative branch creates laws in the form of
statutes. Generally, to create a law, a legislator will introduce a bill into
whatever legislative house she belongs; then once the bill receives an
affirmative vote in each legislative house and the signature of the
jurisdiction’s chief executive, it becomes an enacted law.28
On the federal level, the legislative branch, known as Congress, consists of
the House of Representatives and the Senate. Bills that pass both houses
to become enacted receive the designation “Public Laws.” The
Government Publishing Office (GPO) publishes all Public Laws of the
United States in a multi-volume set called the Statutes at Large. The GPO

See BLACK’S LAW DICTIONARY 1033 (10th ed. 2014).

27

H. L. A. HART, THE CONCEPT OF LAW 94-110 (2d ed. 1994).

This process holds true for the federal legislature and all but one of the state
legislatures. Nebraska, the odd state out, features a unicameral legislature, so bills
only need pass one house in the Cornhusker State.

28

10

also divides the Public Laws into their constituent parts by topic and fits
them into a topically-organized publication of all federal laws in force
called the United States Code.
State legislatures follow the same process as the federal legislature, but the
nomenclature varies. For instance, in Kentucky the legislature is called the
General Assembly, which is comprised of the House of Representatives
and the Senate. Bills that pass both houses become Acts, which
researchers can find in chronological order in the Kentucky Acts or in the
topically-organized Kentucky Revised Statutes. Meanwhile, bills that pass both
houses of the Texas Legislature become General Laws published in the
Texas General Laws before being folded into one of a number of different
codes named for the topics they cover. Thus, while the processes resemble
each other, each state may call its statutes by slightly different terms.29
Because constitutions charge the legislative branches they create with
general law-making (“legislative” actually means law-making30) ability31,
statutes represent laws in their most basic sense. As such, they are the next
most important source of law after constitutions and typically control legal
problems over other sources of law. Statutes will be covered in greater
detail in Chapter 2.

1.4.3 Judicial Opinions
Although a statute on point would typically control a given legal
controversy, it is not always readily apparent how precisely a statute would
apply to a specific set of facts, or even whether it would cover the facts at
all. This ambiguity occurs because generally legislatures write statutes in
broad, abstract terms in order for the statute to cover as many scenarios as
possible. Thus, abstract statutes typically require interpretation in order to
apply them to specific controversies. Under Separation of Powers, the
judicial branch takes on the role of the interpreter of laws.
The judicial branch typically comprises several levels of courts, with a high
court at the top, trial courts at the bottom, and one or more levels of
intermediate appellate court in between, though the names of the various

For a thorough list of what each state calls its statutes, see THE BLUEBOOK: A

11

courts vary by jurisdiction. At the federal level, the United States Supreme
Court acts as the high court, District Courts serve as the usual point of
entry to the system, and Courts of Appeal (also sometimes called Circuit
Courts) connect the two.32 Constitutional grants of judicial power generally
extend to the respective court system as a whole.33
Judicial interpretations of law take the form of judicial opinions, also
referred to as cases. As the casebook remains by and large the tool of
choice for legal instruction in the United States, law students will tend to
be most familiar with this source of law. Although subservient to the
statutes they interpret, judicial opinions create their own rules of law
through the force of precedent.
Precedent works through the principle of stare decisis which is defined as:
The doctrine of precedent, under which a court must
follow earlier judicial decisions when the same points
arise again in litigation.34

Basically, consistency benefits law, in that it allows those governed by the
law to predict what they need to do to comply with the law. Following
earlier decisions as precedents leads to greater consistency. Thus, if courts
begin interpreting a statute in a certain way, society benefits if they continue
to interpret the same statute in the same way.
Sometimes judicial opinions create legal rules through precedent even
absent a statute. This happens often when courts interpret constitutional
sections. It also happens when courts apply legal rules that predate the
widespread use of statutes.35 The term “common law” refers to law made
through judicial opinions rather than by statutes.36 Many common law rules
remain in force in American law, particularly in the fields of Torts and
Property.

For a state-by-state breakdown of state court systems, see THE BLUEBOOK: A
UNIFORM SYSTEM OF CITATION 248-302 tbl.T.1.3 (Columbia Law review Ass’n et
al. eds., 20th ed. 1st prtg. 2015).

33

See, e.g., U.S. CONST. art. III, § 1; KY. CONST. § 109.

34

BLACK’S LAW DICTIONARY 1626 (10th ed. 2014).

The concept of the statute slowly developed in England during the late Middle
Ages, but statutes did not achieve primacy until the 16th Century. Furthermore,
legislatures tended to operate on strictly part-time schedules well into the 19th
century.
35

36

See BLACK’S LAW DICTIONARY 334 (10th ed. 2014).

12

Thus, through the force of precedent, judicial opinions contribute legal
rules to the various bodies of American law, both through statutory
interpretation and common law. Indeed, many lawyers spend the majority
of their research time on case research. Judicial opinions will be covered in
more depth in Chapter 3.

1.4.4 Administrative Regulations
The final branch of government formed by constitutions mandating
Separation of Powers is the executive branch, which consists of a chief
executive and various cabinet departments and agencies that report to the
chief executive. At the federal level the President of the United States acts
as the chief executive, and at the state level the Governor fills the same
role. A constitution usually charges the chief executive with enforcing or
executing the laws of its jurisdiction.37
Of course, chief executives do not personally enforce all the laws of their
jurisdictions. Instead, they delegate the enforcement of different areas of
law to different agencies. Often, an agency will need to provide specific
rules in order to enforce a broad statute. Rules issued by agencies take the
form of administrative regulations. In modern times, legislatures actually
delegate regulation-making authority to executive branch agencies by
statute, giving regulations the force of law.
While administrative regulations do contribute legal rules to the various
sets of American laws, lawyers generally regard them as the weakest of the
sources of law. Since regulatory authority comes via legislative delegation,
a legislature can remove the authority at any time. Administrative
regulations will be discussed in more detail in Chapter 4.

1.5 Hierarchy of Authority
As we have seen, American law comes from many sources. Not only does
each branch of government create its own source of law, but each separate
jurisdiction within the U.S. possesses its own set of laws. As such,
knowing how the different pieces of law interact with each other takes on
huge importance for legal researchers (especially if the different pieces of
law in any way contradict each other, which is not an unusual occurrence).
Lawyers refer to individual pieces of law as authorities and describe their
relationship to each other as the hierarchy of authority. As discussed
above, the standard hierarchy of authority starts with constitutions as the

37

See, e.g., U.S. CONST. art. II, § 3; KY. CONST. § 81.

13

most authoritative, and then proceeds in order of authoritativeness
through statutes, judicial opinions, and administrative regulations.
However, this simple hierarchy does not capture the nuance involved
when dealing with authorities from multiple jurisdictions or authorities
from one jurisdiction being applied by the courts of another. Furthermore,
not all judicial opinions carry equal weight. Thus, more description is in
order.

1.5.1 Primary v. Secondary Authority
Legal authority can be divided into two broad categories: primary authority
and secondary authority. Collectively, this distinction is referred to as “type
of authority.” Primary authority refers to “authority that issues directly
from a law-making body.”38 Thus, the four sources of law discussed
previously make up primary authority. Secondary authority, therefore,
refers to “authority that explains the law but does not itself establish it,
such as a treatise, annotation, or law-review article.”39 While lawyers may
cite secondary authorities, courts do not view secondary authorities as
possessing as much persuasive weight as primary authorities possess. More
will be said on secondary authorities and their use in Chapter 6.

1.5.2 Mandatory v. Persuasive Authority
Legal authority can also be divided into mandatory (sometimes called
binding) authority and persuasive authority. Collectively, this distinction is
referred to as “weight of authority.” Mandatory authority refers to an
authority that a court considering a case must apply, while persuasive
authority refers to “authority that carries some weight but is not binding
on a court.”40 Obviously, lawyers benefit from knowing whether a court
must apply an authority to a case or whether a court may choose not to
apply an authority. Therefore, being able to determine the relative weights
of authority is a skill every legal researcher should aspire to acquire.

1.5.3 Determining Weight of Authority
Determining the weight of authority for some sources of law can be quite
straightforward. If a jurisdiction’s constitution applies to a set of facts
before a court, then the constitution acts as mandatory authority. Similarly,
if a statute from the jurisdiction in question relates to the facts in

38

BLACK’S LAW DICTIONARY 159 (10th ed. 2014).

39

controversy, a court must apply it. The same holds true for regulations,
though they tend to apply to more narrowly defined sets of facts. In other
words, constitutions, statutes, and regulations can never be persuasive;
they are either mandatory or irrelevant. Conversely, secondary authority,
since it is not actually law but merely interpretation, can never be
mandatory but only acts as persuasive authority. Thus, a determination of
weight for many authorities will be quick and easy.
The weight of authority of judicial opinions, however, depends on several
factors. In order to make a determination, first a lawyer must consider
choice of law. In order to be binding, a precedent must apply the same
jurisdiction’s laws as would apply to the controversy for which the
research is being conducted.41 However, choice of law alone does not
determine weight of authority.
A lawyer must also consider venue, or the court where her controversy
would be heard if it went to trial. In order to be mandatory, an earlier case
must have been issued from the same court system as will be adjudicating
the controversy to which a lawyer would like to apply the precedent.
Furthermore, the earlier case must be from a higher court, in a direct line
of appeal, from the current controversy’s venue. As state court structures
vary, let us look at a hypothetical case in the federal court structure as an
example.
As discussed above, the federal court structure consists of trial level courts
(District Courts), intermediate appellate courts (Courts of Appeals), and
ultimately, the United States Supreme Court. District Courts and Courts of
Appeals are grouped into twelve geographic circuits (and one topical
circuit). If a lawyer loses a trial in a District Court, she may appeal to the
Court of Appeals for whichever geographic circuit contains the District
Court that tried her case. See Figure 1.5.3 for a list of which circuits
contain which districts.

Note that in the event a controversy involves issues from multiple sets of laws,
such as federal constitutional defenses to state laws, it would be possible for cases
to be binding on some issues but not others.

decisions prior to that date are binding upon District Courts

If a lawyer were trying a case applying federal law in the District Court for
the Eastern District of Kentucky, mandatory precedents would include
opinions from the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals and the United States
Supreme Court. Because cases from the Eastern District of Kentucky may
only be appealed to the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals, opinions from
other circuits’ Courts of Appeals would merely be persuasive, even though
those courts are higher courts. Similarly, if the same lawyer were handling
the appeal from the District case in the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals,
only Supreme Court cases would be mandatory, as the Supreme Court is
the only court higher than a Court of Appeals in the federal system.
To complicate matters, however, an exception exists if the choice of law
and venue do not match, i.e. a case in federal court involves state law, or a
case in state court is applying federal law or the law of another state as a
choice of law. In this specific case, the court applying a different

16

jurisdiction’s law will treat opinions from the high court of that jurisdiction
as mandatory. This is because each jurisdiction’s high court acts as the
final arbiter of its laws under constitutional principles of federalism.
Of course, even if a lawyer determines a precedent only serves as
persuasive authority, she may still choose to use it, particularly if it features
facts similar to her controversy. Furthermore, some cases may be more
persuasive than others. Generally speaking, the higher the court the better.
Also, cases from the court system of the jurisdiction whose law has been
selected as the choice of law tend to be better than cases from other court
systems. Finally, although they are not binding because they may
technically be overturned, earlier cases from the same court hearing the
current controversy would be the highest level of persuasive authority as
courts generally try to avoid overturning their earlier decisions.
Although not always an easy task, the evaluation of the hierarchy of
authority for a given legal problem is an essential skill for legal researchers
to determine what research paths to pursue. Furthermore, a legal
researcher needs to be able to recognize the various sources of law that
create the rules that govern the problem being researched. For these
reasons, legal researchers should keep the structures of the U.S. Legal
System firmly in mind as they research.

1.6.2 Intermediate Hierarchy of Authority Exercise
Dear Associates:
We are representing Ronny Jotten in an upcoming drug possession case in
Fayette County Circuit Court in Lexington, KY. Jotten is a graduate
student living in university housing. He has his own bedroom but shares a
kitchen and common room with three other students. On the morning of
August 23rd, Lexington police officers, while looking for Vic Sydney, a
known acquaintance of Jotten, entered Jotten’s suite without a warrant.
The police limited themselves to the common areas and did not enter a
bedroom. All residents were away from the flat at the time. However, Mac
Shane, an undergraduate living next door to Jotten, entered the flat
looking for Jotten. The police, who in the meantime had found a rather
large bag of marijuana in between some couch cushions, asked Shane if he
knew whose it was. Shane, inebriated at the time and wanting to deflect
attention away from that fact, replied that the marijuana was “Ronny’s”
before waltzing out the door. The police subsequently arrested Jotten.
I’m pretty sure that what the police did was an unlawful search under
federal law, but I’m going to need to prove that Jotten had a reasonable
expectation of privacy in the common area (as opposed to dormroom) of
his suite. Here are some authorities on the matter. Please put the following
materials into hierarchical order. Please draw a line between binding and
persuasive authority. Thanks. As a reminder, we’re arguing federal law in
state court.

You are a staff attorney for Heaven’s Doorkeepers, a non-profit legal aid
organization devoted to defending death penalty cases in the state of
Texas. Your most recent case is that of J.W. Harding, who has been
charged with capital murder under Tex. Penal Code ANN. §19.03 (West

into a barn on The Freewheelin’ Ranch owned by one Robert Dillon. Mr.
Harding proceeded to steal roughly a dozen cattle from the barn. As he
was looking for some kind of way out of there, Mr. Harding, driving the
small herd of cattle, encountered Mr. Dillon approaching on foot along
Highway 61. Mr. Harding prompted the cattle to stampede in an attempt
to escape, and the herd trampled Mr. Dillon to death. To make matters
worse for Mr. Harding, Mr. Dillon’s next of kin, his son Jacob, is suing
Mr. Harding for wrongful death. Jacob Dillon resides in Nashville, TN, in
a condo with a great view of the skyline. As such, he is suing Mr. Harding
in federal court on diversity jurisdiction.
Since Heaven’s Doorkeepers is representing Mr. Harding anyway, your
supervising attorney has decided to help with the wrongful death suit as
well. She is assigning you to explore each of the following legal issues:
capital murder as a matter of state law in Texas courts, cruel and unusual
punishment as a matter of federal law applied in Texas state courts, and
wrongful death civil actions as a matter of Texas state law as applied in
federal courts. Please put the following sources into hierarchical order for
each issue. Label each source as mandatory or persuasive.
Bear in mind that Texas has two Supreme Courts, the Texas
Supreme Court (Tex.) handles civil cases, and the Texas Court of
Criminal Appeals (Tex. Crim. App.) deals with criminal cases.

Chapter 2

Constitutions & Statutes
Thus, the particular phraseology of the Constitution
of the United States confirms and strengthens the
principle, supposed to be essential to all written
Constitutions, that a law repugnant to the
Constitution is void, and that courts, as well as other
departments, are bound by that instrument. – John
Marshall, Marbury v. Madison, 5 U.S. 137, 180 (1803)
All those courts before mentioned are in use, and
exercised as Law at this day, concerning the Sheriffes
Law dayes and Leets, and the offices of High
Constables, pettie-Constables, and Tithingmen;
howbeit, with some further additions by Statute
laws… - Francis Bacon, The Elements of the Common
Laws of England

2.2 Constitutions & Statutes
As discussed in Chapter 1, constitutions act as the highest source of law in
the United States legal system. No other law can be valid if it conflicts with
a constitutional provision. As such, finding applicable constitutional
sections takes on dire importance for legal researchers. Fortunately,
constitutions tend to be short. Furthermore, because of their importance,
most experienced lawyers will know whether or not a constitutional issue
will likely apply without needing to do an overly large amount of research.
Because of these factors, and because jurisdictions tend to publish their
constitutions in the same place as their statutes, we will cover constitutions
and statutes together.
Constitutionally valid statutes act as the second highest source of law in the
United States legal system. An applicable statute will control a given legal
problem over case-made legal rules. This has been the case in the Anglo
legal tradition since the late Middle Ages, as the quote from Francis Bacon
at the beginning of this chapter suggests. However, the full primacy of
statutes did not occur until the Tudor period in the Sixteenth Century.42 In
fact, at that time England underwent the Reformation and split from the
Roman Catholic Church by statute.43 As the development of statutory
authority occurred before the founding of the North American colonies,
statutes have always enjoyed primacy (subject to written constitutions, an
American innovation) in the U.S. legal system.
This is not to say that statutes have always taken the same form. American
political and legal institutions have evolved over time. However, we will not
cover the complete history of statutory forms since what matters to most
researchers is finding and understanding relevant statutes in their current
forms. To understand the different forms statutes currently take, however,
we must first turn our attention to the life-cycle of a statute.

For an account of how Henry VIII and his secretary Thomas Cromwell
modernized English political and legal institutions, see generally G. R. ELTON, THE
TUDOR REVOLUTION IN GOVERNMENT; ADMINISTRATIVE CHANGES IN THE
REIGN OF HENRY VIII (1953).

2.3 Life Cycle of a Statute
Statutes, of course, come from legislatures. When a legislator wants to
create a new statute, he introduces a bill into whichever house he belongs.
Upon introduction, each bill receives a number beginning with a
designation of its house of origin. For example, at the federal level, bills
introduced into the House of Representatives begin with the letters H.R.,
while bills introduced in the Senate begin with the letter S. State
legislatures follow similar schemes. Bill numbering starts over each
legislative session, so researchers need to be aware of which session of a
legislature considered a bill. However, bills are not yet statutes, and many
never become so. Thus, while a legal researcher may occasionally look up a
bill’s legislative history44 in an attempt to determine legislative intent,
statutory research by and large uses other versions of statutes.
Upon passing both houses of a legislature,45 a bill is signed by the
executive (barring a veto) and becomes a statute. Different jurisdictions
call their statutes by different names, but Acts or Laws are the most
commonly used terms. At the federal level, passed bills become known as
Public Laws.46 Public Laws receive a unique number, beginning with the
number of the Congressional session in which the law was passed. The
Government Publishing Office then immediately publishes each Public
Law as a pamphlet or slip law. Slip laws, due to their quick publication,
effectively give the public notice of new laws. However, because each slip
law contains only one statute in isolation, they are not terribly useful for
legal research purposes. In fact, many states do not bother to issue slip
laws.
At the conclusion of each legislative session, the printer for the legislature
gathers all statutes passed during the session and publishes them in
chronological order as part of a multi-volume set, known as a collection of
session laws. At the federal level, the Statutes at Large act as the session

Legislative history refers to everything that happened to a statute in the
legislature before it became a statute. See BLACK’S LAW DICTIONARY 1039 (10th
ed. 2014).

Except, of course, in unicameral Nebraska.

For a complete list of what each state calls its statutes, see THE BLUEBOOK: A

al. eds., 20th ed. 1st prtg. 2015).

laws. Different states call their session laws different things. For instance
Kentucky’s session laws are the Kentucky Acts, while Ohio’s session laws
are the Ohio Laws.47 Because session laws feature chronological
organization, a legal researcher pursuing a specific topic will not find them
terribly useful. However, if a researcher has already found a specific statute
and wishes to see earlier versions of that statute, session laws become a
valuable resource, as we will see in section 2.4.3.4.

Figure 2.3: Life Cycle of a Generic Statute

Finally, after initial publication, statutes undergo codification, which is:
The process of compiling, arranging, and
systematizing the laws of a given jurisdiction, or of a
discrete branch of the law, into an ordered code.48

The process of codification thus results in a topically-organized code of
statutes in force. The federal government appropriately titles its code The
United States Code (U.S.C.). Naturally, as befits the U.S. federal system,

For a complete list of what each state calls its session laws, see THE BLUEBOOK:

27

state codes vary in name.49 Note that when a new statute makes changes to
the existing statutory code, language is added or removed to the code as
necessary to incorporate those changes. Thus, codes constantly change,
while session laws serve as repositories of historical laws. Because most
legal research involves investigating legal issues that apply to facts, rather
than beginning with a specific statute, codes tend to be the statutory
source researchers use most often. A jurisdiction’s code also typically
includes its constitution at the front, so constitutional research would also
be conducted with a code.

2.4 Using Codes
Lawyers conduct the bulk of their statutory research using the codified
versions of statutes. Thus, legal researchers need the ability to use codes
efficiently. Because codes and their tools developed during the precomputer era, we will introduce their use in print format. Of course,
electronic legal publishers include codes on their research platforms, but
rather than reinvent the wheel, the electronic publishers incorporated
many of the tools originally developed for codes in hard-copy. Also, many
expert legal researchers prefer codes in print due to the efficient design of
these resources. Thus, we will introduce the use of codes in print here and
save methods of electronic research for Chapter 5.

2.4.1 Codes & Topical Organization
Codes work well for legal research because of their topical organization. A
topical organization allows for the easy creation of a topical index, which
researchers can use to find code provisions on a specific topic. Once a
researcher finds a code provision on point, nearby provisions may also be
likely to be of use because of the way codes group like topics together. In
order to see how this works, let us take a closer look at the organization of
a typical code.50
The most basic unit of a code is the section, which provides for a specific
legal rule over a set of circumstances. While sections may feature
subsections, the subsections themselves only provide for part of the legal
rule created by the section and so cannot really act on their own. Think of
code sections as analogous to atoms. While protons, neutrons, and

For a complete list of what each state calls its code, see THE BLUEBOOK: A
UNIFORM SYSTEM OF CITATION 248-302 tbl.T.1.3 (Columbia Law review Ass’n et
al. eds., 20th ed. 1st prtg. 2015).
49

As with most authorities in a federal system, exact nomenclature may vary
jurisdiction by jurisdiction.

50

28

electrons make up atoms, none of those particles will be found in nature
on their own, but only clumped together in atoms. Subsections and code
sections work in the same way.
Codes then group related sections together into chapters. Sometimes a
code will also use sub-chapters if an area of law contains a sufficient level
of depth for multiple classifications. For instance, in the United States
Code, Chapter 10 of Title 18 contains all of the code sections related to
federal criminalization of biological weapons. The individual sections in
the chapter address discreet topics such as the prohibition of biological
weapons or seizure of biological weapons by the government.51 Note also
the inclusion of a definitions section in the chapter.52 The definitions
contained therein apply to all the other sections in the chapter. A
researcher would need to find the definitions in order to apply correctly
any of the other sections in the chapter. Luckily, a code’s inherent
organization makes such a discovery likely. Furthermore, print codes
feature a table of contents at the beginning of each chapter to enable
researchers to grasp quickly the organization of that particular chapter.

Figure 2.4.1a: The table of contents for Chapter 10 of Title
18 of the United States Code Annotated.

Codes then group related chapters together into titles. Generally, a title acts
as the largest unit of organization in a code, other than the code itself.53 For
example, the U.S.C. houses the chapter on biological weapons in Title 18
with other chapters dealing with different crimes. A table of contents alerts

51

18 U.S.C. §§ 175 – 178 (2012).

52

18 U.S.C. §178 (2012).

53 Sometimes codes also group related chapters into separate parts within a title.
Note also that some jurisdictions, notably Texas and California, publish multiple
topical codes instead of one unified code. To determine the publication format
for a specific jurisdiction, see THE BLUEBOOK: A UNIFORM SYSTEM OF CITATION
248-302 tbl.T.1.3 (Columbia Law review Ass’n et al. eds., 20th ed. 1st prtg. 2015).

29

researchers as to what chapters are included in the title. Sometimes titles
include definitions or general principles that apply throughout the title.
These will usually be found towards the beginning of the title. Similarly, a
code itself features a table of contents identifying its constituent titles, and
may also feature general provisions applicable to the entire code. A lawyer
would need to find these in order to interpret applicable laws correctly.
Fortunately, codes provide enough organization to allow researchers to find
the information they need.

Figure 2.4.1b: The table of contents for Title 18 of the
United States Code Annotated.

2.4.2 Annotations
Sometimes a jurisdiction publishes its own code as an official version, such
as the U.S.C. Often, however, a jurisdiction will designate private entities as
the publisher(s) of its code. For instance, in Kentucky two separate private
publishers produce the Kentucky Revised Statutes, Michie’s (Lexis) and
Baldwin’s (West). Even for jurisdictions that publish their own code,
though, private publishers will also publish an unofficial version. For
example, West publishes the United States Code Annotated (U.S.C.A.), and

30

LexisNexis publishes the United States Code Service (U.S.C.S.). Both of these
titles are reprints of the official U.S.C., yet their respective publishers are
able to sell copies and turn profits because they add value to the code by
providing editorial content called annotations.
Annotations lead researchers who have discovered a relevant statute in an
annotated code to other authorities that help interpret that statute. Through
annotations, researchers may discover cases, secondary sources on point, or
other tools useful to the expansion of research from an applicable statute.
Figure 2.4.2 shows examples of annotations included for a section from
Michie’s Kentucky Revised Statutes. Annotated codes also feature annotations
for constitutional sections.54
The publishers of annotated codes employ lawyers as editors to read new
legal authorities and to identify which authorities interpret which specific
statutes. Obviously, this is a time-intensive and expensive undertaking, but
legal researchers willingly pay the costs because good annotations are an
efficient way to begin their research.55

Note that publishers usually provide an extremely large number of annotations
for constitutional provisions. This makes sense as constitutional provisions tend
to be broadly-written and open to much interpretation through caselaw. The
result for the researcher, though, is that annotations for a particular constitutional
provision may be extremely bulky and not as easy to use as those for statutes.

54

55 Also, because the different publishers employ different editors, it may
sometimes be beneficial to check multiple versions of a code (if a researcher has
cost-effective access to multiple versions) as the annotations may differ.

2.4.3 Using Codes in Print
Many expert legal researchers find print copies of codes more efficient to
use than electronic copies. Often a researcher will need several related
sections of a code and so desires the ability to flip back and forth between
sections. Also, sometimes seeing a code in print makes it easier to grasp
the code’s inherent organization. Naturally, when researching in print
good legal researchers prefer annotated codes to unannotated codes
because of the value added by the annotations.

32

2.4.3.1 Finding Code Sections by Citation
Before a legal researcher can use annotations, however, he must find the
code section(s) relevant to his problem. The easiest way to pull a relevant
code section is by citation. A lawyer might know the citation of a code
section he needs through other means than research. For instance, a
criminal defense attorney may know the citation to the statute under which
his client has been charged. If a legal researcher knows the citation of a
particular code section, then retrieving that section is simple.
Citation schemes vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction, but generally
speaking, statutory citation begins with a number that references the title in
which the section is found, then provides an abbreviation that lets
researchers know which code the citation references, and finishes with the
specific section number of the section. The federal code follows this
format, as do the codes of some states. For example, to pull 7 U.S.C.
§1471(j),56 a researcher would find the volume of the U.S.C. that contains
Title 7 and turn to § 1471(j). As you can see in figure 2.4.2, codes feature a
header on each page that alert researchers to the first (for lefthand pages) or
last (for righthand pages) section that appears on that page. Note that code
volumes sometimes contain more than one title. This bears emphasizing:
title numbers and volume numbers of print codes do not correspond.
A title is a unit of intellectual organization, while a volume is a unit of
physical organization. Researchers should take care to select the correct
volume that houses the title for which they are looking.
Not all states follow the federal citation scheme. For instance, in Hawai’i
code sections are cited in the following format: HAW. REV. STAT. § 322-1.
The citation still features an abbreviation referencing a specific code (in this
case, the Hawai’i Revised Statutes), but there is no title number. Instead, the
citation provides only the specific section number: 322-1. For each section
in the Hawai’i code, the digits before the hyphen refer to a chapter, and the
ones after the hyphen refer to the specific section. Thus, a researcher would
find § 322-1 in chapter 322 of the Hawai’i Revised Statutes. Hawai’i serves as
only one example, though many states employ a similar scheme. For a

56 Note that for a full, formal citation when producing legal writing, more
information would be required. See THE BLUEBOOK: A UNIFORM SYSTEM OF
CITATION R. 12, 120-134 (Columbia Law review Ass’n et al. eds., 20th ed. 1st
prtg. 2015).

33

complete state-by-state breakdown of citation schema, researchers may
consult table 1.3 of The Bluebook.57
2.4.3.2 Finding Code Sections by Topic
While retrieving a code section by citation is quick and easy, often legal
researchers will not know the citation of code sections they will need.
Instead, from talking with a client, they will merely have identified some
relevant legal issues and will need to find statutes that correspond with
those issues. Luckily, print codes provide a couple of methods of accessing
information by topic. Furthermore, because the methods resemble similar
methods used by other non-fiction publications, most law students already
possess at least some familiarity with them.
First, codes provide a table of contents. Actually, they usually provide a
series of tables of contents. At the very beginning of the code, a researcher
can find an exhaustive table of contents that lists each title of the code and
gives information about what areas of law each respective title covers.58
Then, at the beginning of each title, a code provides a table of contents for
that title, detailing the coverage of chapters within the title. Similarly,
individual chapters provide tables of contents with information on their
constituent sections. See figures 2.4.1a and 2.4.1b above as examples.
Researchers can browse through the tables of contents to narrow in on a
specific section of relevance.
Browsing tables of contents, however, can be time-intensive and does
require some knowledge of how specific issues relate to general topics. For
instance, a researcher looking for criminal trespass statutes would need to
know that those would likely be included near burglary and that burglary as
a crime would be found in a penal code. Often, then, researchers turn to the
other tool provided by codes for topical research: the index.
Generally speaking, researchers will find a comprehensive index in one or
more volumes located at the end of a code. A code’s index works in typical
index fashion: researchers look up specific terms they think apply to their
situation, and the index refers them to specific code sections or to other
terms in the index (that will then refer the researcher to specific code
sections). Note that legal indexes tend to be organized into multiple levels

THE BLUEBOOK: A UNIFORM SYSTEM OF CITATION 248-302 tbl.T.1.3
(Columbia Law review Ass’n et al. eds., 20th ed. 1st prtg. 2015).

57

Often, the overall table of contents will be reproduced at the front of each
individual volume of a code.

58

34

of classification, meaning that sometimes researchers can only find specific
terms by looking under general topics. For instance, a researcher looking
for the statutory penalties for harming a bald eagle would first need to look
up “bald eagle” as a topic and then scan through the subtopics to find
“fines and penalties.” Often, the multiple-level organization of code indexes
even leads researchers to investigate relevant terms that they would not
have thought of on their own! Between the index and the table of contents,
legal researchers should be able to find statutes on any given topic, even
without knowing a citation beforehand.

Figure 2.4.3.2: Excerpt from the General Index of West’s
United States Code Annotated.

2.4.3.3 Popular Names Table & Other Tables
In addition to providing means for researchers to find code sections by
topic, codes often provide finding aids that allow a legal researcher to find
a code section if he possesses some other piece of information about a
statute. For instance, most laws receive “popular names,” by which they
can be referenced without needing to rattle off a difficult-to-remember
citation. For example the Religious Freedom Restoration Act (otherwise
known as Public Law No. 103-141) tends to make the news a lot. A lawyer
might remember that the Religious Freedom Restoration Act applies to his

35

case but then need to pull the relevant code sections to read the actual
statute. By using the Popular Names Table of the U.S.C.A., he would be
able to look up “Religious Freedom Restoration Act” and retrieve citations
to the code sections which house the act, as seen in Figure 2.4.3.3.

Figure 2.4.3.3: The U.S.C.A. Popular Names Table Entry
for the Religious Freedom Restoration Act.

Note that the Popular Names Table also provides researchers with citations
to the enacting and amending session laws. Annotated codes also often
provide separate tables that convert session law citations to code section
citations. The other tables provided by codes work under similar principles
as the Popular Names Table.
2.4.3.4 Using Code Sections
Regardless of how a researcher finds a relevant code section, he then
needs to apply it to his client’s problem. The first thing a good researcher
does upon locating a potentially relevant code section is to read carefully
the language of the law itself. (Note that annotated codes provide much
more information than just the law itself. Please refer back to Figure 2.4.2
for an illustration of the different pieces of information discussed here.)
Reading the code section should alert the researcher as to whether or not
the code section he found actually applies to his legal problem.
After an initial read, a lawyer should then check to see if the language he
just read was in force at the time of the actions that gave rise to his client’s
problem. He does this by perusing the dates enacted/amended that codes
include immediately after the language of each section. Obviously, the

36

earliest date listed refers to the enactment of the law, while later dates refer
to times later statutes amended the code section. The text of the code
section reflects the changes made by the most recent listed amending
statute. Therefore, if a client’s problem occurred prior to the most recent
amendment, a lawyer would need to look at the version of the law in force
at that time. Luckily, the dates amended following a code section also
provide citations to the session laws that did the amending. The lawyer
could then retrieve the appropriate session law by citation, as if he were
retrieving a code section by citation, to obtain the law as written at the
time of the facts giving rise to his client’s problem.
However, looking backwards in time at changes to a code section when
researching in print is not enough. A legal researcher must also look
forwards in time, or “update” the law. This occurs because books are
printed at a definite point in time. Because legislatures frequently pass
statutes that amend code sections, invariably some printed code sections
will have changed since the date when the volume they are found in was
last published. Fortunately, legal publishers are aware of this possibility
and have developed a system to alert researchers to changes in the law.
They simply issue supplementary volumes containing the new language.
Most annotated codes publish their supplementary updates as pocket
parts, which are soft-bound pamphlets which dedicated library workers
slide into a pocket at the back of the bound code volume. If enough laws
change to the point that a pocket part becomes too thick to fit into a code
volume comfortably, a publisher may issue a free-standing supplement
(which would be located immediately to the right of its code volume on
the shelf), or may simply republish the code volume in question.
Pocket parts present code sections in the same order as their parent
volume, but they do not reprint every section of the volume. If a code
section does not appear in the pocket-part, then a researcher knows that it
has not been updated through the publication date of that pocket part and
can rely on the version found in the code volume proper. However, if a
code section does appear in the pocket-part, then a researcher knows one
of two things: either the text of the law has changed, or the publisher has
seen fit to add more annotations to the particular section. If the law has
changed, the new text of the code section will be provided in the pocketpart, and the researcher should use that language. If the text of the section
itself does not appear, then the section appears in the pocket part because
only the annotations have changed. Note that if a new section is added to a
code after publication of its volume, it will appear only in the pocket part.

37

See figure 2.4.3.4 for an illustration of the two different types of pocket part
entries.

Bender & Company, Inc., a LexisNexis company. All rights
reserved.

Once a researcher knows that the text of a statute was current at the time of
his client’s incident, a good researcher then takes a couple of more steps
before moving on with his research. First, he will flip to the beginning of
the chapter or sub-chapter that houses the section to see if any definitions,
general provisions, or related sections apply to his issue. Second, he will
make note of any annotations included for her section of interest. The

38

annotations may help him interpret or apply the statute he has found. They
will also usually give him an entry point into case research, which we will
cover in Chapter 3.

2.5 Local Legislation
In addition to creating their own laws, state legislatures also often delegate
law-making authority to cities or other local government units within the
state. Cities and other local units which have been delegated law-making
power by the state are often referred to as municipalities or localities.
Individual municipalities create their own processes of legislation in
accordance with the state statute(s) creating the municipality. Lawyers refer
to local legislation as ordinances rather than statutes.
The major difference between a state statute and a municipal ordinance
comes in applicability. A statute carries force of law throughout the state.
Conversely, a municipal ordinance carries force of law only inside the
boundaries of its municipality.
Another major difference between statutes and ordinances becomes
obvious when one compares the publications that house the respective
sources of law. While municipal ordinances do tend to be organized
topically into codes, the actual publication of physical copies remains less
than regular. A couple of commercial publishers publish larger
municipalities’ codes,59 but often the codes of smaller municipalities exist
only as self-created and promulgated documents. In fact, ordinance codes
can be somewhat hard to find. Researchers sometimes may need to
contact the issuing municipal government directly to find an up-to-date
copy.
Should a legal researcher get his hands on a municipal code of ordinances,
he would interact with it in the same ways he would interact with other
codes, as municipal codes typically feature indexes, tables of contents, and
good topical organization. Ordinance research is often easier than that
involving other codes as a matter of scale, since municipal codes often
comprise only a single volume.
Though municipal ordinances can be difficult to find and carry only
limited applicability, they do carry the force of law in their municipalities

Municode and American Legal Publishing dominate the ordinance-publishing
business such as it is. The codes of ordinances published by these two companies
do not feature annotations, as both companies generally operate on a lowoverhead model.

through legislative delegation of authority. As such, lawyers need to be
able to find ordinances affecting their clients, as they would statutes. Of
course, both statutes and ordinances are subject to interpretation, as are
constitutions.

2.6 Interpreting Constitutions and Statutes
As mentioned above, both constitutions and statutes tend to be broadly
written in order to apply to a wide range of facts. They often lack specifics,
and so lawyers must interpret them and how they will apply to a given set
of facts. Often, lawyers look to judicial opinions that have already
interpreted a statute for guidance on how to interpret that statute. We will
cover finding judicial opinions in Chapter 3.
However, occasionally a lawyer may encounter a statute that has not yet
been interpreted by a court, and so may need to look for other sources to
aid in interpretation. Similarly, a lawyer may face a situation in which all the
judicial opinions side against his client and may be looking for an alternative
way to interpret a statute or constitutional provision. In these situations,
lawyers sometimes try to argue for an interpretation for an authority based
on the intent of the body that created the authority in question. In order to
support an intent-based argument, a lawyer will often look to the history of
the authority’s creation for evidence of intent.

2.6.1 Constitutional History & Framers’ Intent
Constitutions typically come from constitutional conventions, which tend
to publish records of their work beyond the constitution itself.
Furthermore, to become binding as the ultimate source of law for a
jurisdiction, that jurisdiction must ratify the constitution. Usually, some
form of a jurisdiction’s legislature performs the ratification. Under some
circumstances, researchers can look to the work product of the
constitutional convention or of a ratifying body to help interpret a
constitutional provision by attempting to determine the intent of the
drafters or framers of the constitution.
For a variety of reasons, most lawyers will never find themselves needing
to look to framers’ intent. Most of the commonly-litigated constitutional
provisions feature a significant number of cases interpreting them. Usually,
lawyers prefer to rely on a reported case’s interpretation than to infer
intent from the work product of a constitutional convention. Still, students
may sometimes encounter references to framers’ intent in judicial opinions
or scholarly works, so we will briefly introduce the major sources here.

40

The federal constitution came about as the result of a constitutional
convention held in Philadelphia during the summer of 1787.60 In addition
to producing the Constitution itself, the convention produced various bits
of work product. The bits of work product were later collected by
historians and published as compilations. The most comprehensive and
widespread of the compilations is Max Farrand’s The Records of the Federal
Convention of 1789.61 Following the convention, the Constitution faced a
tough ratification campaign, which saw three of the convention delegates62
publish a series of essays arguing for ratification. Collectively those essays
form the Federalist Papers,63 and judges deem them good expressions of
framer intent. Furthermore, a historian named Jonathan Elliot collected
documentation from the ratification debates that took place in the various
state ratification conventions and published them in a work entitled The
Debates in the Several State Conventions on the Adoption of the Federal Constitution
(or Elliott’s Debates for short).64 Together, these three works make
researching federal framers’ intent relatively straight-forward, and
researchers may find all three titles on the Library of Congress’s website
(as well as in virtually every library system in the United States).
State constitutions often feature similar documentations of history in
terms of convention proceedings, but the availability of the proceedings
may vary by state. Furthermore, many states have adopted different
constitutions at different times, and so there may be more than one
convention’s proceedings available. To research state constitutional
history, a researcher should contact a reference librarian in his state of
interest.
A complicating factor about constitutions is that, because they are
designed to be organic documents, they change over time through the
amending process. If the constitutional issue being researched relates to

one of the amendments, neither convention nor ratification documents
will be of use to a researcher. Fortunately, though, the vast majority of
constitutional amendments pass through a more rigorous version of the
legislative process, and so their histories can be researched in similar
methods to the legislative history of statutes, which we will cover in the
next section.

2.6.2 Legislative History & Legislative Intent
A statute’s legislative history can serve as a source that will aid in
interpreting the statute. Legislative history refers to the “proceedings
leading to the enactment of a statute, including hearings, committee
reports, and floor debates.”65 Essentially, everything that happens to a
proposed statute procedurally goes into its legislative history. Lawyers can
sometimes use the legislative history to investigate the legislature’s intent
in drafting the statute. A lawyer would then argue that the legislative intent
indicates a particular interpretation of the statute.
As the exploration of legislative intent is usually the end goal of
researching legislative history, researchers will find some pieces of
legislative history more helpful than others. After all, the legislative process
typically involves several distinct steps in two separate houses, so finding
something that indicates the intent of the legislature as a whole can be
challenging. We will briefly introduce the types of documents researchers
of legislative history are likely to encounter in order from those generally
the most helpful for inferring intent to those less often used.
2.6.2.1 Types of Legislative History Documents
In order to appraise the relative weight of a piece of legislative history, a
researcher needs to understand the basic legislative process. First, a
legislator introduces a draft statute as a bill. Upon introduction of the bill,
the leadership of the legislative house in which the bill was introduced
assigns it to a relevant committee of that house for evaluation. The
committee will look at the bill in some detail and may hold hearings to
investigate the bill’s purpose or commission studies about specific effects
the bill may have. If the committee passes the bill, it returns to the full
legislative house for debate and consideration. After a bill passes one
house, it will be introduced in the other legislative house to follow the

65

BLACK’S LAW DICTIONARY 1039 (10th ed. 2014).

42

same process.66 Because bills are subject to amendment at pretty much any
time of the process, it is unlikely that a bill will pass each house with the
exact same language intact. To resolve differing language, legislatures
generally form special committees with members from both houses, called
Conference Committees. Once a Conference Committee agrees on a
reconciled version, each house must pass the final, reconciled version of
the bills they have already passed. Only then will the bill be sent to the
executive to be signed into law as a statute.67
Given that legislatures contain multiple legislators all with their own beliefs
and motives that can affect the steps of the process, speaking of legislative
intent as a singular force may strike one as somewhat specious. In essence,
every piece of legislation passed represents a compromise. Therefore, the
intent expressed during the compromise stage of the process will be the
strongest expression of intent a researcher will be able to find. For this
reason, researchers of legislative history often look to Conference
Committee materials first. Indeed, Conference Committee Reports
detailing the actions taken by the Conference Committee on a particular
statute usually provide the strongest expression of legislative intent.68
Sadly, Conference Committees do not create reports for every statute they
consider, and not every statute requires a Conference Committee.
Therefore, a researcher may or may not find a Conference Committee
report for a given statute. If no Conference Committee Report is available,
he should then try a Committee Report from one of the standing
committees. Because the committee to which a bill is assigned looks at a
bill more closely than the legislative house at large, the committee itself
often expresses intent in recommending the bill to the rest of the

Note that legislative procedures vary and also tend to be flexible. For instance,
sometimes different, or even identical, versions of a bill may be introduced
simultaneously in both houses. If they both pass, the legislature then can combine
them instead of starting the process anew.
66

Note that the executive possesses the options of not signing or vetoing the bill,
in which case it would not become a statute, barring a veto override.

67

Note that intent-inferring value does vary document by document. A researcher
may find a Conference Committee Report that offers little interpretive value for a
particular statute, while a different legislative history document for the same bill
contains an express statement of intent. Generally speaking, though, a Conference
Committee Report containing evidence of intent would be more persuasive than
other documents, since the Conference Committee will have dealt most closely
with what became the final version of the statute.

68

43

legislative house. Furthermore, legislatures such as Congress tend to have
their own procedural rules requiring that standing committees be made up
of members of both parties. As such, Committee Reports generally reflect
the views of both the majority and minority parties on the committee and
so may provide insight into the compromise that best embodies intent.
However, because the committee will have considered an earlier, preconference version of a bill, researchers should ensure that any discussion
of intent in a Committee Report refers to a portion of the bill that
remained in the bill as it passed into law.
Researchers may also encounter statutes for which there are no Committee
Reports available from any legislative committee. Other pieces of
legislative history may still provide glimpses of legislative intent. At the
Federal level, Congress publishes a journal of its proceedings called the
Congressional Record, which often preserves transcripts of debates on
particular bills, as well as voting records on the same bills. By putting these
two pieces of information together, a researcher might be able to
determine which argument carried the day and then ascribe intent to that
argument. Alternatively, a researcher might find multiple versions of a bill
along with suggested amendments and attempt to infer intent from the
changes made to the bill. Finally, a researcher may examine published
Hearings or Committee Prints (studies commissioned by the committee
considering a bill) in order to see what information Congress considered
before passing a bill or to see what the stated purpose of a bill was. While
it is somewhat tenuous to infer intent from Hearings or Prints, they may
be able to show whether or not Congress considered a specific issue and
may also describe the legislation’s general goal in the abstract. Note that all
of the legislative documents described in this paragraph require inference
and assumption in order to determine intent as it applies to the specific
language of a statute. As such, these materials are much weaker than
Committee Reports.

In addition to the documents produced by the legislature, researchers of
legislative history may sometimes also encounter signing statements. In
order for a bill to become law, it not only must be passed by the legislature
but must also generally receive the signature of the executive. When the
executive signs a bill, he sometimes issues a signing statement, which is an
expression of the executive’s understanding of legislative intent behind the
new law. While this may seem like a strong, express statement of intent,
note that it does not, in fact, come from the legislature. As such, it is not as
good for a legislative intent argument as something actually produced by
the legislature.
Researchers of federal legislative history will encounter the types of
materials described above somewhat regularly. However, states vary in the
amount of legislative work product they publish. In fact, many states
publish only a legislative journal and no reports of any sort. Therefore,
before engaging in research of state legislative history, students should
contact reference librarians from their state to determine what actually is
available.
Before a researcher can use legislative history to determine intent, she must
first find what legislative history exists for the statute in question, so let us
now turn to methods for finding legislative history documents.
2.6.2.2 Finding Legislative History Documents
We have good news and bad news about researching legislative history.
On the bad news side, a researcher never knows whether a legislature will
have produced any legislative history documents for a given statute. Thus,
researching a statute’s legislative history may sometimes prove fruitless.
On the good news side, because a researcher will typically be looking for
legislative history to help interpret a statute, he will have a logical starting
point to his research. The statute itself will naturally limit the scope of his
research.
In order to conduct legislative history research on a statute, a researcher
will need the session law or slip law citation for the statute in question. As
discussed above, researchers typically find statutes via a topically organized
code. The reason that codes do not work so well for legislative history is
that most statutes produced by a legislature get divided into pieces in order
to fit topically into the code. However, when the legislature considered
and ultimately passed the statute, all the topical bits would have been
considered together. Therefore, researchers will need the version of the

46

statute as it passed in order to pull all its associated legislative history
documents. Luckily, the code itself provides citations to the session laws
that enacted or amended a code section at the end of each code section.
Once a researcher has obtained the citation information for the slip law or
session law version of a statute, he can proceed in a couple of ways. First,
he may find a compiled legislative history for his statute. Compiled
legislative histories are similar to the compilations of historical
constitutional documentation referenced in Section 2.6.1. Compiled
legislative histories may exist as stand-alone works on a single topic,69 but
researchers may also find works that collect and publish multiple compiled
legislative histories. Such collections—at least for Federal legislation--exist
both in print and electronically.70
The dominant print source for compiled legislative histories is West’s
United States Code Congressional and Administrative News (USCCAN). Before
computers, USCCAN was the easiest way to locate federal legislative
history.71 Researchers would look up federal statutes by Public Law
number, and the USCCAN entry for the Public Law in question would
contain a selection of the more useful legislative history documents as
chosen by a West editor. Note that USCCAN only provides select (as
opposed to comprehensive) legislative histories and only on select statutes.
Despite these limitations, USCCAN is useful and ubiquitous enough that
it remains the Bluebook preferred source for many citations to legislative
history.72
In addition to finding them in print, researchers can also find compiled
legislative histories electronically. For instance, West includes an electronic

See, e.g., BERNARD D. REAMS AND CHARLES R. HAWORTH, CONGRESS AND THE
COURTS: A LEGISLATIVE HISTORY, 1787-1977: DOCUMENTS AND MATERIALS
REGARDING THE CREATION, STRUCTURE, AND ORGANIZATION OF FEDERAL
COURTS AND THE FEDERAL JUDICIARY (1978).

70 For a comprehensive bibliography of available compiled legislative histories, see
NANCY P. JOHNSON, SOURCES OF COMPILED LEGISLATIVE HISTORIES: A
BIBLIOGRAPHY OF GOVERNMENT DOCUMENTS, PERIODICAL ARTICLES, AND
BOOKS (2d ed. 2012).

Note that in addition to its print form, USCCAN is now also published
electronically on Westlaw. It remains a trusted and useful source for legislative
history research in the computer era.

version of USCCAN on its Westlaw platform. Similarly, HeinOnline
provides a number of compiled legislative histories in electronic format.
More information on using electronic research platforms will be provided
in Chapter 5.
Unfortunately, compiled histories are not available for every statute. In the
event that a researcher needs to investigate the legislative history of a
statute without an available compiled history, he will need to compile the
materials himself. The amount, type, and format of legislative documents
available vary greatly by jurisdiction. At the Federal level, the Government
Publishing Office produces a large selection of legislative documents that
researchers can find in print or on microfiche73 at a Federal Depository
Library.74 Legislative history documents for more recent statutes may also
be found online at Congress.gov.75 Alternatively, the private publisher
ProQuest provides digitized Congressional documents from as early as
1789 through electronic subscription services.76 We will cover conducting
electronic research in Chapter 5.
State governments tend to publish significantly fewer legislative
documents than the federal government, but the specific publication
schemes vary by jurisdiction. To conduct legislative history research on a
state statute, we encourage students to contact a law librarian in the
relevant state.
The legislative history documents described in this section can aid lawyers
in interpreting statutes, the source of law created by the legislative branch.
In the next chapter, we will turn our attention to another source of law:
judicial opinions, which themselves often interpret statutes.

In the event that students find themselves needing to consult microfiche or
microfilm, just ask a reference librarian for help.

73

74 The GPO maintains a list of libraries participating in the Federal Depository
Library Program at http://catalog.gpo.gov/fdlpdir/FDLPdir.jsp.
75 Congress.gov includes finding aids for legislative documents from 1973
onwards that would make finding them in a Federal Depository Library easier, but
only contains the full-text of documents from 1993 onwards.

ProQuest’s subscription databases, such as Legislative Insight, are marketed
mostly to research universities. The libraries of major public universities typically
allow on-site use of subscription databases.

2.7 Concluding Exercises for Chapter 2
Now that we have covered the basics of using codes for research, let’s try to
do some actual legal research! The following exercises contemplate the use
of print codes. Because most states tend to enact laws on similar topics, if
you do not have access to a print code of any of the jurisdictions called for
in these exercises, you may simply substitute the code of a jurisdiction for
which you do have print access.

2.7.1 Introductory Exercise on Code Research
You are an associate at a mid-size law firm in Washington, D.C. Your
managing partner comes to you to say that a client, an extremely wealthy
woman who inherited an alcohol-distribution company, stopped in to
request that the firm initiate divorce proceedings on her behalf.
Apparently, her significantly-older husband has become increasingly
cantankerous and erratic following some failed political ambitions. In your
client’s own words, “he’s just become too much of a maverick.” Upon being
asked in which state the matrimonial residence was located, the client
confessed that the couple often spend time apart but rotate monthly to
dwellings in the following locales:

Kahului, Hawaii
Sedona, Arizona
Key West, Florida
Arlington, Virginia

You have been tasked with finding statutory grounds for divorce in each of
the jurisdictions listed. Please find the relevant code sections.

49

2.7.2 Intermediate Exercise on Code Research
Dear Associates:
We have recently been engaged by Bernard Brown, proprietor of Brown
Books, to defend him in a misdemeanor prosecution in the state of
Georgia. Brown Books is located in suburban Atlanta and carries a variety
of new and used books. Recently, Mr. Brown sold a number of copies of
D.H. Lawrence’s Lady Chatterley’s Lover to students at the local high school,
who ranged in age from 14 to 16 years of age. Some of their parents got
upset and the State of Georgia charged Mr. Brown with selling harmful
materials to minors. This despite the fact that according to Mr. Brown
(who emigrated from Ireland), “the bloody school assigned the bloody
book! It’s art! It’s literature! The school library has a copy for Pete’s Sake!”

Above all, Mr. Brown would like us to get an acquittal.

I need you to:
•

Find the statute provision that prohibits the sale of harmful or
obscene materials to minors. Does the Georgia code define
“harmful materials”?

•

See if there is anything in the code that provides special protection
for libraries.

•

Do you think we will be able to defend Mr. Brown successfully?

Thanks,

Mr. Partner

50

2.7.3 Advanced Exercise on Code Research
Hello Team:

We have been retained to represent Mr. Tyler Sangman in his upcoming
federal criminal trial in the Northern District of Ohio. Mr. Sangman, a
professional lobbyist and environmental activist, stands charged with the
federal crime of committing an “attack to plunder a vessel.” The vessel in
question, the S.S. Umlaut, was carrying replacement parts across Lake Erie
for a chemical plant operated in western New York by industrial giant
BADCO, Inc. Mr. Sangman allegedly used an inflatable motorboat to
intercept the Umlaut off the coast of Ohio in order to disable its propeller
system with plastic explosives. Unfortunately, the explosives were more
powerful than intended, and the Umlaut sank to the bottom of Lake Erie.
Using the United States Code Annotated, I need you to find the following
information:

•

Look up the federal code section criminalizing attacking vessels to
plunder them under the piracy laws of the U.S. Would Sangman’s
alleged actions qualify as a crime under the text of this code
section?

•

Look at the annotations. Do any suggest a case that might answer
whether it matters that Sangman didn’t intend to profit from his
actions?

•

Do any annotations indicate whether we would be able to challenge
federal jurisdiction over the crime, since the action occurred in
waters adjoining Ohio?

•

I know you’ll need to read the cases from the annotations for a
definitive answer, but just going from the statute and its
annotations, do you think we’ll have good news or bad news for
Mr. Sangman?

Thanks,
Mr. Partner

Chapter 3

Judicial Opinions &
Common Law
The law embodies the story of a nation’s
development through many centuries, and it cannot
be dealt with as if it contained only the axioms and
corollaries of a book of mathematics. In order to
know what it is, we must know what it has been, and
what it tends to become. – Oliver Wendell Holmes,
Jr., The Common Law
It is a maxim among these lawyers, that whatever
hath been done before, may legally be done again:
and therefore they take special care to record all the
decisions formerly made against common justice and
the general reason of mankind. – Jonathan Swift,
Gulliver’s Travels

3.1 Learning Objectives for Chapter 3
In working through this chapter, students should strive to be able to:
•

Appreciate how judicial opinions create legal rules through
precedent.

•

Evaluate judicial opinions’ varying weight of precedential authority.

•

Use reporters to look up opinions by citation.

•

Evaluate the editorial content added to opinions by publishers of
reporters.

•

Explain how the West Key Number/Digest System functions.

•

Use digests and reporters in combination to reconstruct the
common law on a given subject.

55

3.2 Judicial Opinions and the Common Law
As discussed in Chapter 1, both constitutional and statutory provisions
generally consist of language too broad to be applied to specific facts
without an act of interpretation. In the U.S. legal system, the judiciary
serves as the primary interpreter of the law.
Courts issue their interpretations as judicial opinions, which then act as
precedent to create lasting legal rules. Sometimes (maybe even most of the
time) lawyers will refer to opinions as cases. However “opinion” is a more
precise term, as a single case can feature more than one opinion. Multiple
opinion cases occur when not all the judges77 hearing a case agree on the
result. If a majority of judges agree, they will designate one of their
members to issue a majority opinion, which is the strongest form of
judicial precedent. If an individual judge disagrees with the majority
opinion, she may issue a dissenting opinion. Similarly, if an individual
judge agrees with the end result of a case, but not the legal reasoning that
led to the result, she may issue a concurring opinion. Both dissenting
opinions and concurring opinions may be cited as persuasive precedent,
but neither will be as strong a precedent as a majority opinion.
To further complicate matters, judges may “join” the opinions of their
colleagues. In fact, the way a researcher can tell that a majority opinion is a
majority opinion (other than by the fact it comes first in the write-up), is
by seeing that a majority of the judges have joined it. Judges may also join
dissents or concurrences instead of issuing their own. Furthermore, judges
sometimes only join parts of an opinion, if they only agree with certain
issues. After all the judicial maneuvering is said and done, sometimes a
court will be left without a majority opinion but will have to issue a
plurality opinion instead. Plurality opinions act as much weaker precedent
than majority opinions. Thus, when a legal researcher finds a relevant
opinion, she should pay attention as to its origins.
Once issued, judicial opinions act as precedent for later courts, thus
opinions provide their own legal rules that become part of American law.
Lawyers call such judge-made rules “common law.” Common law can
develop from a statute or constitutional provision by creating a standard
interpretation of the same, or it can develop independently of
constitutions and statutes. Miranda Rights serve as an example of the

Courts very as to whether they style their members as “judge” or as “justice.”
For purposes of this chapter, “judge” will be used throughout.

77

56

former. The Fifth Amendment, in rather broad language, guarantees
people accused of crimes the right of “due process.”78 Miranda v. Arizona, a
U.S. Supreme Court case, interpreted due process as requiring police to
inform a suspect in custody of her constitutional rights before
interrogating her.79 Later cases applied that ruling as precedent and
developed the law further by discussing what exactly qualifies as “custody”
or “interrogation.”80 Thus, judicial opinions have created specific legal
rules as a common law of the Fifth Amendment.
Judge-made rules also exist independently of constitutional or statutory
interpretation. Typically, these rules became articulated by judges prior to
the widespread use of statutes. Most such rules were part of the body of
English law that American colonists originally brought with them from the
Old Country. Indeed, “common law” can also be used to refer only to the
traditional, customary laws that developed in England.81 Many English
common law elements still persist in American law, especially in the fields
of Torts and Property.
Regardless of whether working on problems of statutory interpretation or
application of historic common law rules, legal researchers tend to spend
much of their time conducting case-based research. Researching judicial
opinions tends to take more time than researching codes, as cases tend to
be longer than statutes and also do not benefit from the inherent
organization provided by the process of codification. Let us thus turn to
how one goes about researching cases.
As with statutes, the information systems for publishing judicial opinions
came about before the advent of computers. When the legal publishers
began providing electronic content in the latter part of the twentieth
century, they imported the already-extant information systems to the new
format. Thus, as we did with statutes, we will here introduce judicial
opinions in their print format and will save electronic research for Chapter
5.

3.3 Case Reporters
The practice of republishing judicial opinions for dissemination and use
has existed since medieval times.82 However, prior to modern times, only
select cases on pre-identified topics tended to be published.83 Also, reports
of opinions that were published tended to focus on limited geographic
areas, leaving lawyers with far fewer precedents with which to work. The
modern system of publishing judicial opinions began in the late nineteenth
century when John B. West systematically collected appellate-level
opinions and published them in multi-volume sets he termed “reporters.”
West Publishing continues to publish the dominant amount of American
caselaw to this day, and West’s reporters continue to see use.

3.3.1 Types of Reporters
West, and to a lesser extent its competitors84, produce several broad types
of reporters. Simplest are jurisdictional reporters, which publish reported
cases from a single jurisdiction. For instance, West’s Kentucky Decisions
includes reported opinions from Kentucky state courts. Sometimes, the
publisher limits the scope of jurisdictional reporters to opinions from a
specific judicial level, as West does with its various reporters for federal
cases. The Supreme Court Reporter, for example, republishes opinions only
from the United States Supreme Court. Likewise, the Federal Reporter
publishes opinions from federal Courts of Appeal, and the Federal
Supplement publishes select cases from U.S. District Courts.85 Some
jurisdictions publish their own opinions in “official” reporters, the most
notable being the United States Reports containing opinions issued by the
Supreme Court of the United States and published by the Government

See, e.g., HENRICI BRACTON, DE LEGIBUS ET CONSUETUDINIBUS ANGLIAE (c.
1260).
82

The official United States Reports was an exception to this trend, as it has always
included every Supreme Court opinion issued.
83

Because the term “lion’s share” does not even begin to do justice to West’s
dominance of publishing judicial opinions, most of the discussion in this chapter
will focus on West publications.

84

Note that not all district court opinions are published. Trial level opinions,
because they mix application of law with finding of facts, do not make as good a
precedent as appellate opinions. Therefore, West only includes particularly
significant district court opinions in the Federal Supplement. West also publishes the
Federal Appendix which includes cases originally passed over for publication.
Opinions in the Federal Appendix do not count as fully published opinions, per se,
and so legal researchers should not rely on them as precedent.
85

58

Publishing Office. Official reporters generally work similarly to West’s
jurisdictional reporters although without the helpful editorial material that
West provides.86
In addition to jurisdictional reporters, West also publishes reporters that
gather opinions from several different states into one series, called regional
reporters. Please note that regional reporters exist as a publishing
contrivance only. Therefore, just because two states’ judicial opinions
appear in the same reporter, it does not mean that the opinions are in any
way related. For instance, cases from Kentucky and cases from Texas both
appear in the South Western Reporter, but opinions from Kentucky would
carry no more weight in Texas than opinions from Maine, which are found
in the Atlantic Reporter, would.

Similar to statutes, researchers often find West’s unofficial reporters to be more
useful than official reporters, due to the extra editorial content.
86

59

Figure 3.3.1: A Map of West’s Regional Reporter System

Beyond regional reporters, another instance exists in which legal researchers
might find cases from multiple jurisdictions within a single reporter set.
Sometimes publishers will create topical reporters, which gather opinions
from all U.S. jurisdictions that touch upon the reporter’s central theme. For
instance, West publishes the Education Law Reporter, which contains a variety
of state and federal cases dealing with issues of law as applied to the
education profession.
Note that legal researchers may often find the same judicial opinion in any
number of reporters. For instance, a case dealing with education law from
the Kentucky Court of Appeals could probably be found in the Kentucky
Decisions, the South Wester Reporter, or the Education Law Reporter. Nothing
about the opinion changes from reporter to reporter. In other words, it
does not matter where a legal researcher finds a needed precedent, just that
she does so.

60

3.3.2 Finding an Opinion in a Reporter
As with statutes and codes, a legal researcher most easily retrieves an
opinion from a reporter if she has a citation in hand. Unlike codes,
however, reporters do not impose a topical organization upon the legal
authorities they contain. Instead, reporters publish opinions in
chronological order as courts hand them down. Therefore, obtaining a
citation to a case takes on paramount importance. Luckily, before engaging
in case research, a good legal researcher will have checked for controlling
statutes and made note of key case citations found in a relevant statute’s
annotations, so it is not unusual to begin case research with a citation in
hand.
Case citation works very similarly to code citation. A citation to a case
begins with a number, proceeds to an abbreviation, and then ends with
another number. The first number in a case citation refers to the volume
of the reporter in which the case appears. The abbreviation alerts
researchers as to which reporter contains the case87, and the final number
signifies the page of the reporter volume on which the case begins. For
example, Rose v. Giamatti, 721 F. Supp. 906 (S.D. Ohio 1989) begins on
page 906 of volume 721 of the Federal Supplement. Often, the first number
of a case will be immediately followed by a comma and a second page
number. The second page number acts as a “pin-cite” referring the reader
to the specific page of the case on which the issue being cited is discussed.
Going straight to a pin-cite may save a researcher time, though the whole
case should be read for context, of course.

Figure 3.3.2: Commonly Used Reporters

Note that when we speak of citations, we speak of them as referring to
cases, not opinions. This is because all opinions issued in a case are
published together as one unit in the reporter. Typically, however, a
citation to a case will be alluding to the majority (or plurality, if that is the
case) opinion of the court unless it specifically identifies a concurrence or
dissent.
A couple of other unique circumstances affecting case citation bear
mentioning. First, sometimes cases appear in more than one reporter.

62

Thus, a legal researcher may encounter parallel citation, in which one case
citation refers to multiple reporters. In this case, the researcher may pull
the desired case from whichever of the referenced reporters strikes her as
most convenient. Second, because book spines feature limited space, when
a reporter set reaches 999 volumes, rather than try to squeeze an extra
digit onto the spine, the publisher starts the numbering over. To avoid
confusion when this happens, the reporter enters its “second series” (or
third series in the case of an exhausted second series). Citations to reporter
series other than the first include a notation to that effect next to the
abbreviation of the reporter title. For example, F.2d refers to the second
series of the Federal Reporter. Thus, citations truly make it easy for
researchers to pull cases from reporters.

3.3.3 Using a Reported Case
Once a legal researcher locates a case in a reporter, she will, of course, be
able to read all opinions issued in the case. However, reading full cases can
be a time-consuming process. To increase the efficiency of legal research,
West includes valuable editorial content for cases in its reporters, much as
publishers of annotated codes do.88 Figure 3.3.3 illustrates the editorial
content provided by a West reporter.
The first thing to note about a reported case (as lawyers call cases that
appear in reporters) is that the actual judicial opinion does not start right
away. In fact, the opinion will sometimes not start for pages! This happens
because West places its editorial content before the opinions. This
information is often introductory and allows the researcher to more quickly
parse the content of the actual opinion.

Note that the editorial content merely helps explain or interpret the case; it does
not itself act as precedent. As such, lawyers never cite to editorial content but
rather use it to understand and cite the case it accompanies.

88

63

Figure 3.3.3: A Case as it Appears in a West Reporter

The first bit of information a reported case gives to a researcher comes in
the heading of the case. The heading includes the case name, the name of
the court that heard the case, the docket number assigned by the court, and
any relevant procedural history for the case. A short synopsis of the case,

64

including the holding of the majority opinion, immediately follows the
heading. Thus, before reading an entire opinion, a legal researcher can make
an advance determination as to its worth by scanning the heading and
synopsis.
After the synopsis, West provides the most useful of the editorial content
included in reporters: headnotes. Headnotes identify specific legal issues
addressed in the opinion(s) of the case. Thus, a researcher can tell at a quick
glance whether the issues she wants were considered in a case.
Furthermore, West includes notes within the text of the opinion(s)
indicating where in the opinion(s) the court considered the specific issues
described by the headnotes.
In addition to helping the researcher identify legal issues within an opinion,
West’s headnotes provide the ability to find other cases that discuss the
same issue. West assigns a “topic and key number” to every headnote its
editors create. Each key number refers to a specific legal issue found in the
jurisprudence of its accompanying topic. Different judicial opinions that
discuss the same issue will all receive the same corresponding topic and key
number. To find other cases with the same topic and key number, a legal
researcher turns to the other major type of West publication for case
research: the digest, which we will discuss in section 3.4.

3.3.4 Unreported Cases & Court Dockets
Not all cases heard in the United States make it into a reporter. Cases will
be passed over for inclusion in a reporter for a variety of reasons. First,
cases from trial-level state courts tend to focus more on findings of fact
rather than on determinations of law, and so are usually not published.89
Second, sometimes a judge, even at the appellate level, will indicate in an
opinion that it is not for publication. She may do this if the case breaks no
new ground legally and so adds nothing to the precedents on which it was
decided. Alternatively, the facts in the case may be unique or bizarre enough
that the judge thinks creating a precedent from the case might cause havoc
with other precedents. Whatever the reason behind not being included in a
reporter, though, lawyers deem opinions issued in unreported cases to be
“unpublished” and do not view them as having full precedential value. Note
that West’s Federal Appendix reports cases that were originally passed up for

89 The same holds true for some federal district court cases, though West
publishes federal district opinions that do make determinations of law in the
Federal Supplement as discussed above in section 3.3.1.

65

publication in West’s other reporters. As such, researchers should view
cases from the Federal Appendix as unreported, and should view their
opinions as unpublished, to be used only with extreme caution.
In fact, until relatively recently, courts only allowed citation to unpublished
opinions in very limited circumstances. However, with the advent of
computer-assisted legal research (which will be discussed in Chapter 5),
unpublished opinions have become somewhat easier to find. As a result, in
2006, the Supreme Court of the United States adopted a rule permitting the
citation of unpublished federal opinions in federal courts, provided that the
unpublished opinions were issued in 2007 or later.90 Most states now make
similar provisions, though the exact details vary. Researchers should check
the court rules of their jurisdiction before using an unpublished opinion to
ensure doing so is permissible.
The reason that courts traditionally treated unpublished opinions with
skepticism derives from the difficulty in finding unpublished opinions prior
to the electronic research era. Because the primary way of finding precedent
in print was through the use of the reporter and digest system, any case not
included in a reporter would have been overlooked by the majority of
researchers.91 In fact, prior to the computer age, the primary way of
obtaining an unpublished opinion was to retrieve it from the court docket
at the court that heard the case.
Court dockets are records kept by the court of proceedings in a particular
case. For the legal researcher, dockets can be a treasure trove of
information because they typically note all the documents, or court filings,
submitted by parties or produced by the court related to that case. In
addition to the final opinion, a researcher may be able to see the briefs
(written arguments) submitted by both parties, the motions they made in
court, exhibits presented, court orders on motions, any final court orders
regarding the proceedings, and more.
An enterprising researcher can explore other uses for dockets beyond
gathering more information about an individual case. She can use dockets
to find examples of motions, arguments, and other documents related to a
particular legal issue and use them to inform her own legal documents. If

90

91 Cases appearing in the Federal Appendix can be found via a print digest, but
these represent a very small percentage of the unpublished cases out there and do
not, of course, include any state cases.

66

a case involves a corporation, sometimes it must reveal information to the
court that they otherwise would never disclose to the public. A researcher
could potentially use documents submitted to the court to find out about
financial issues within the company, confidential information regarding
patents, or other useful information.
Nowadays many courts provide online access to their more recent dockets,
and researchers can generally find court filings electronically using the
major legal research platforms discussed in Chapter 5. However, some
states do not put their dockets online, or sometimes a researcher may wish
to look at a docket that predates electronic filing. In order to obtain
materials from a docket unavailable electronically, a researcher should
contact the clerk of the court that heard the case in question.
Generally speaking, though, published opinions are much more valuable to
a legal researcher than unpublished opinions or court filings. Let us now
turn to the tool that allowed lawyers to find published opinions on
particular topics prior to the invention of computers: the digest.

3.4 Digests
Digests, though themselves large multi-volume sets, act as topical indexes
to the even more voluminous reporter sets. Remember, reporters
themselves lack topical organization—the lengthy nature of judicial
opinions would make any such internal organization highly impractical—
and instead work with the external organization provided by digests.
Likewise, digests do not reproduce judicial opinions, but provide short
summaries of cases and citations to the same organized by topic. Thus,
both reporters and digests are of limited use without the other.92

3.4.1 Types of Digests
For the most part, West publishes the same types of digests as it does
reporters, though there are some key differences in coverage between the
two types of publication. Like reporters, digests come in jurisdictional,
regional, and topical varieties. Additionally, West publishes general digests
that can potentially lead researchers to opinions issued in any jurisdiction
in the U.S.

Note, however, that a digest can also be used effectively with an electronic
database of cases. The basic steps would be the same except that instead of
pulling a case from a reporter, the researcher would retrieve the case by entering
its citation into a legal search engine.

92

67

Legal researchers probably use jurisdictional digests more than any other
type. West publishes jurisdictional digests for most individual states and
the District of Columbia.93 State digests, unlike state reporters, include
references to both state cases and related federal cases that originated in
the state in question. In addition to individual state digests, West publishes
a number of federal digests. Some, like the Supreme Court Digest, index cases
from a single court. However, the Federal Practice Digest leads researchers to
published opinions issued by any federal court, regardless of level.
West also publishes several regional digests that mostly correspond to the
regional reporters. Note, however, that not every regional reporter benefits
from a companion regional digest.94 Regional digests lead researchers to
opinions issued by state courts for the same states covered by the
corresponding reporter.
As West publishes topical reporters, so too does it publish topical digests
to accompany the reporters. For example, lawyers working for a university
might consult the Education Law Digest in combination with the Education
Law Reporter.
In addition to the types of digests corresponding to types of reporter,
West publishes the General Digest, which can potentially lead researchers to
opinions from any U.S. jurisdiction. Because of the sheer amount of
information involved in such an undertaking, West periodically publishes
the Decenniel Digest.95 When a new edition of the Decenniel Digest appears,
the General Digest then starts anew. Thus, if depending on a one-stopshop approach to researching with digests, lawyers must consult both the
Decenniel and General Digests.96

West does not publish a digest for Delaware, Nevada, or Utah. To find
opinions from these jurisdictions using only print sources, researchers would need
to consult the relevant regional digest or the general digest.

93

West never published a digest for the South Western Reporter. Furthermore, West
has discontinued the North Eastern Digest and the Southern Digest. Researchers in
jurisdictions covered by those regions would need to consult the relevant state
digest or the general digest in order to find opinions using print sources.
94

Although the period between publications of the Decenniel Digest used to be 10
years, as suggested by the title, in modern times of heavy case loads, West now
publishes it more often.

95

Indeed, they should probably consult the Centenniel Digest, which predates the
Decenniel Digest, as well.
96

68

Fortunately, all of West’s digests use the same system, the topic and key
number system. Thus, once an aspiring legal researcher learns to use one
digest, she will be able to use all of them.

3.4.2 Using Digests to Find Opinions
As discussed above in section 3.3.3, West editors assign a topic and key
number to every headnote they create upon reading cases. Each key
number corresponds to a specific issue within its topic, and judicial
opinions that discuss the same issue will feature the same topic and key
number. Please note that each topic in the system begins with key number
1. In other words, West reuses numbers, so knowing key numbers without
knowing the corresponding topics does researchers little good.
If, however, a legal researcher knows the topic and key number that
correspond to the issue for which she is looking, she can simply look up
the topic and key number in a digest and retrieve a list of cases that have
considered the issue in question in the jurisdiction(s) covered by that
digest. Furthermore, the digest provides brief summaries of each case so
that the researcher can make an informed decision as to which cases she
wants to pull from their respective reporters first. Figure 3.4.2a provides
an example of a typical digest entry.
As a caveat, many West digests have started over in new series, much like
the West reporters. For instance, the Kentucky Digest 2d continues the
Kentucky Digest. Similarly, the Federal Practice Digest is now onto its 5th
series.97 The key fact to remember about digest series is that they are not
cumulative. Therefore, in order to find judicial opinions from the whole
range of years available, a researcher must consult all the various series of a
particular digest. West publishes an editorial note at the beginning of each
volume of a digest providing researchers with notice of the year-range
covered by that particular series of the digest.

The Federal Practice Digest 5th is actually the sixth series of the title, as the original
Federal Practice Digest replaced the precursor Federal Digest.
97

69

Figure 3.4.2a: Sample Entry from the Federal Practice
Digest 5th

Digests act as a powerful tool for finding judicial opinions, but to use them
a legal researcher must know the topic and key number that correspond to
the legal questions he wants answered. Fortunately, appropriate topics and
key numbers can be discovered in several ways.

70

First of all, as discussed above, every headnote attached to a West-reported
case features a corresponding topic and key number. Therefore, if a
researcher has discovered one opinion on point, she can lift topics and key
numbers from headnotes of interest to discover other cases addressing the
same point of law. Similarly, if a researcher has found a relevant statute in
an annotated code published by West, then the annotations will likely alert
her to any relevant topics and key numbers.
Fortunately, even if a researcher does not already have a topic and key
number in mind, West digests provide ways to find topics and key numbers
of interest. First, at the end of every digest, a researcher will find an index,
termed the Descriptive Word Index, which works almost identically to the
indexes accompanying codes. A researcher would look up a general term
that covers the legal issue in question. Instead of code sections, however, a
digest’s index lists topics and key numbers for the various issues and subissues. Once a researcher has looked up a term in the index to discover its
topic and key number, she can then look up that topic and key number in
the corresponding main volume of the digest for a list of cases related to
the issue. Note that the index itself does not provide case citations; it must
be used in conjunction with the main volumes of the digest.
In addition to providing indexes for digests, West divides all of American
law into topics, which it fits into an overarching Outline of the Law.
Indeed, the topics from this outline are the same that accompany key
numbers, and West places the key numbers themselves onto the outline.
West publishes its general outline of the law at the beginning of digest
volumes. Additionally, in front of each topic in the digest, West provides a
more detailed outline of that specific topic. Thus, legal researchers possess
the option of browsing through West’s outlines to narrow in on a specific
issue’s topic and key number, much as researchers might use a code’s tables
of contents to narrow in on specific sections. Figure 3.4.2b gives readers an
idea of what West’s Outline of the Law looks like.

71

Figure 3.4.2b: An Excerpt of West’s Outline of the Law as
found in the Federal Practice Digest 5th

By using the Descriptive Word Index or the Outline of the Law, researchers
can identify relevant topics and key numbers they can then use to find case
citations, which in turn would allow the researcher to pull relevant judicial
opinions. Of course, the opinions themselves may lead the researcher to

72

additional topics and key numbers of interest through the headnotes
provided by West. Researchers may then look up the additional topics and
key numbers in a digest in order to find additional cases. Thus, the topic
and key number system provides a powerful tool for researchers to find
judicial opinions.
West digests also provide a couple of other ways to find cases in addition to
the topic and key number system. First, digests contain Tables of Cases
volumes that allow researchers to look up cases by the name of either party.
Second, digests contain Words and Phrases volumes, which allow
researchers to look up a specific word or phrase to find opinions using that
exact word or phrase. Both Tables of Cases and Words and Phrases
volumes, unlike the topic and key number volumes, will provide case cites
in addition to the topics and key numbers assigned to the case. While a
researcher would need more starting information to use either of these
types of volumes, they do provide an alternative access point to caselaw for
print researchers and demonstrate the comprehensiveness of West’s digest
and reporter system.
In fact, as discussed above in section 3.3.4, West’s digest and reporter
system acted as the sole means of finding precedent for so long that courts
deem opinions not published in one of West’s reporters to be less than fully
precedential. In the modern era of electronic legal research, lawyers more
often encounter such “unreported” opinions. Lawyers need to react to such
opinions with caution and to avoid using them as key precedent. Indeed,
most courts will only consider unreported opinions under certain
circumstances. To determine if a court will consider an unreported opinion,
legal researchers should consult the court rules for the jurisdiction in
question.98 Thus, understanding West’s reporter and digest system remains
important even when conducting electronic legal research.

3.4.3 Updating Digests
When a researcher uses a print edition of a digest, she should keep in mind
that, like all print materials, individual digest volumes describe the state of
the law at a particular moment in time. By its very nature, however,
American law constantly changes with every new judicial opinion

Commercial legal publishers generally provide a jurisdiction’s Court Rules at the
end of its code. Legal researchers may thus find specific court rules by the same
methods, described in Chapter 2, with which they would find code provisions.

98

73

published. Thus, it becomes necessary for legal researchers to update the
information found in print digests.
Because lawyers desire consistency in legal publishing, just as they desire
consistency in the law, the primary means of updating the information in
digests takes the same form as the primary means of updating the
information in annotated codes: the pocket part. In fact, pocket parts for
digests work in exactly the same way as pocket parts for codes.99 If a topic
and key number appears in the pocket part, then something about it has
changed since publication of the main volume. If a topic and key number
does not appear in the pocket part, then nothing changed since the
publication of the main volume. Additionally, West may have created a
new topic and key number since publication of the main volume. In this
instance, the topic and key number will appear in its entirety in the pocket
part and not at all in the main volume.
West actually updates the Outline of the Law governing the topic and key
number system quite frequently. Legal rules or issues may fall out of use,
and so key numbers may be dropped. More often, opinions introduce new
rules or issues, resulting in the addition of new key numbers. Furthermore,
sometimes judicial opinions take a rule from an earlier opinion and expand
upon it, or break it into multiple rules. When this happens, West may need
to adjust its numbering. When an area of law changes sufficiently, West
may even renumber an entire topic.
Renumbered topics often confuse law students who are new to legal
research. Feelings of frustration may occur when a student has identified a
relevant topic and key number from an old case headnote only to discover
that the digest no longer contains that topic and key number. Students
should not panic when this occurs, though, because West includes key
number conversion charts at the beginning of every topic which has been
renumbered.

Also like pocket parts for codes, pocket parts for digests will be replaced by
softbound supplements should they become too big to fit in a bound volume.
Eventually the bound volume itself will be replaced.

99

74

Figure 3.4.3: Excerpt from West’s Key Number
Translation Table for Constitutional Law

Note that one old key number often becomes multiple key numbers in
renumbered topics. Researchers should look at each of the new topics to
understand how the law has changed. Note also that West includes key
number conversion charts that operate in the reverse direction, i.e. new key
numbers to old key numbers. West does so because, to find older cases on
an issue, a researcher may need to consult earlier series of a digest, since
digests are not cumulative. Naturally, the older digest series would not use
the new numbering scheme.100

Although exceptions exist, West typically does not continue to issue pocket
parts for non-current digest series.

75

3.5 Subsequent Treatment of Judicial Opinions
Of course, changes in the law, by definition, affect not only legal
publishing but also the actual law itself. As we have seen, the precedential
weight of judicial opinions varies. Furthermore, subsequent treatment of
an opinion, by later opinions or by legislatures, often affects the
continuing utility of the rules contained in the opinion. Thus, finding and
reading an opinion, merely represent the first steps in case-based research;
a lawyer must also evaluate an opinion’s applicability to her client’s
circumstances in light of the treatment the opinion has received since it
was issued.
Subsequent treatment of an opinion ranges from positive to negative. On
the positive side, later opinions may discuss, explain, or cite an earlier
opinion. If a later court cites an opinion on a specific point, it has
implicitly approved the legal rule from the earlier opinion. Such positive
citations tend to increase the precedential value of opinions.
Judicial opinions also sometimes suffer negative subsequent treatment. For
instance, a holding may be overturned in whole or in part by a higher
court. Furthermore, appellate courts may overturn their own earlier
decisions. A famous example of this occurred when Brown v. Board of
Education overturned the earlier Supreme Court decision, Plessy v.
Ferguson.101 Sometimes, a later court may limit or abrogate an earlier
opinion without explicitly overturning it. Similarly, if a legislature dislikes a
rule from a particular judicial opinion, it can pass a statute changing the
law that the opinion had interpreted. The statute would then take
precedence over the opinion. Lawyers refer to opinions thus affected as
having been superseded by statute.
Finally, later judicial opinions may “distinguish” an earlier case.
Distinguishing lies somewhere in between positive and negative treatment.
An opinion that distinguishes an earlier opinion essentially recognizes the
rule from the earlier opinion as valid but goes on to state that the rule
should not apply in the current case because of different material facts. On
the one hand, the rule from the earlier opinion remains valid. On the other
hand, the rule now only applies to an at least somewhat limited set of
facts. The more times an opinion has been distinguished, the narrower its
factual application tends to be. Legal researchers who discover a

Brown v. Board of Education, 347 U.S. 483, 494-495 (1954) (overruling Plessy
v. Ferguson, 163 U.S. 537 (1896)).

101

76

distinguished opinion should carefully evaluate whether their clients’ facts
fall closer to the original opinion or closer to the distinguishing opinion.
Obviously, then, legal researchers need to be able to find the subsequent
treatment of an opinion. Historically, lawyers used a print publication
called Shepard’s Citations to evaluate the subsequent history of an
opinion.102 Using Shepard’s Citations in print involved looking up a citation
in a bound volume that contained a chart of citing opinions, along with
symbols indicating how the later opinions treated the earlier one.
Researchers would then look up the citation in a series of supplements
that updated the bound volume. The process was fairly inefficient, and in
the twenty-first century, lawyers obtain synopses of opinions’ subsequent
treatment almost exclusively electronically.103 Electronic methods of
checking an opinion’s subsequent history will be covered in depth in
Chapter 5. Because of the near-total predominance of electronic citators in
modern legal practice, Shepard’s in print will not be covered in this work.
However, students should be aware that accounting for the subsequent
treatment of precedents has always been a part of the practice of law in the
United States. Furthermore, they may occasionally see references to the
updating service of the pre-computer era: Shepard’s Citations.
Thus, legal publishers provided tools that enabled lawyers to effectively
research judicial opinions long before the advent of computers. Use of
these paper-based tools generally consumed a significant amount of time,
and so their use by lawyers has tapered since the advent of computer
assisted legal research. However, the electronic platforms themselves rest
upon the base organization developed for print. As such, aspiring legal
researchers should ensure that they understand the way the paper-based
systems function.

Note that Shepard’s Citations could also be used to find subsequent treatment of
statutes, though the fact that statutes were published with annotations made this
somewhat less necessary as an extra step.
102

Note that one of the available electronic services for doing so is, in fact,
Shepard’s, now available on Lexis Advance.

3.6 Concluding Exercises for Chapter 3
Now try your hand at using digests and reporters to find relevant judicial
opinions. As with statutes, if you do not have access to a particular print
source for the jurisdiction called for by an exercise, try substituting a
jurisdiction to which you do have access.

3.6.1 Introductory Exercise on Case Research
Hello Team:
We have been retained by Molly Lancaster-Ferguson, owner of Awesome
Antiques, to defend her from a pending Federal prosecution. The federal
charges stem from an isolated incident in which Ms. Lancaster-Ferguson
sold an original 1861 Enfield Rifled Musket (a single-shot, muzzle-loading
rifle manufactured in Enfield, England, and imported/smuggled in large
quantities to arm Confederate troops during the Civil War), which she had
found at a garage sale, to an undercover federal agent posing as an online
buyer. To the extent of her recollection, the incident in question is the
only time that Ms. Lancaster-Ferguson has ever sold a firearm, and she
was unaware that it was illegal to do so. The federal authorities have
nonetheless charged her with violating a federal law that requires all
dealers of firearms to be properly licensed. She is set to be tried in the
Eastern District of Kentucky.
Use the Federal Practice Digests (potentially more than one series) to look
into the following:
1) Find me a case, preferably binding, on whether an individual who
does not know dealing in weapons without a license is against the
law can be convicted of the same.
2) Are there any federal cases, binding or persuasive, that have held
that one isolated gun sale does not amount to “engaging in the
business of dealing in firearms without a license”?
3) Based on your findings, do you think it is likely that we can
ultimately get an acquittal?
Thanks,
Ms. Partner

3.6.2 Intermediate Exercise on Case Research
Hello Team:
One of our best clients, Robert Standersen, has made a slightly unusual
request of us. Normally, we handle corporate law issues for his orthodontist
practice. However, he has asked that we defend his twin children, Brian and
Yvette in a criminal conspiracy action being prosecuted by the
Commonwealth of Kentucky.
Brian and Yvette are seniors at Tates Creek High School. They were
arrested while playing hacky-sack in the parking lot of Henry Clay High
School last Thursday night at 11:30 pm. Two other Tates Creek High
students, Vic Vandal and Hal Hooligan, were also arrested at approximately
the same time. Vandal and Hooligan were caught exiting the locked
building of Henry Clay High School in possession of crowbars and several
soccer championship trophies stolen from display cases in the school’s
hallway.
Neither Vandal nor Hooligan implicated the Standersen twins in the
burglary, so the state’s case of conspiracy to commit burglary against the
twins consists solely of the following pieces of circumstantial evidence:
•

Brian and Yvette are classmates of Vandal and Hooligan at Tates
Creek High School and were found at the scene of the crime.

•

Tates Creek and Henry Clay are soccer rivals. Their annual game
occurred the night after the incident in question.

The Commonwealth’s Attorneys are advancing the theory that Brian and
Yvette were “standing watch” for Vandal and Hooligan. I need you all to
find post-1974, binding caselaw (Kentucky’s current penal code was
enacted in 1974) to answer the following questions:
1. Is circumstantial evidence alone enough for a conspiracy
conviction in Kentucky?
2. Is merely being present at the scene of a crime sufficient for a
conspiracy conviction in Kentucky?
3. Is the Commonwealth likely to succeed in its prosecution? Why or
why not?
Thanks,
Ms. Partner

3.6.3 Advanced Exercise on Case Research
Hello Team:
As you are no doubt aware, we represent Bob “Bubba” Hicklin (founder
and CEO of Black Sky Coal) for most of his legal needs. One of Mr.
Hicklin’s hobbies is breeding and training Bluetick Coonhounds.
Seventeen years ago, he purchased a large tract of land along the
Tennessee-North Carolina border which he has used since then as his
dogs’ breeding/training ground. Unfortunately, Mr. Hicklin did not survey
his lands correctly (he did it himself, another hobby), and the rather large
kennel he built at great cost actually lies on lands owned by the Cherokee
Nation of North Carolina.
The Cherokee have now initiated a legal action against Hicklin for the land
and the kennel in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of North
Carolina. While the Cherokee Nation does appear to hold title to the land
in question, I would like to be able to use the doctrine of adverse
possession as a defense. However, I’m not sure if I can use North
Carolina’s adverse possession laws against the Cherokee as tribal lands fall
at least partially under federal jurisdiction. I need you to:
1. Find me a case from the past 30 years or so (we don’t want
anything decided before the Indian Civil Rights Movement in the
70s), preferably binding over the Western District of North
Carolina, which answers whether or not a state adverse possession
defense can be used against Indian lands?
2. Assuming that you find a relevant case, does it tip you off to any
other topics/keynumbers that we might want to look at that
pertain specifically to Indians and land title? (Keep in mind that
nobody at the firm has an expertise in Indian law, so basic
definitions might be helpful.) What topics and keynumbers will be
most useful to us?
3. Applying relevant authorities to our facts, are we ultimately likely
to succeed? Why or why not?
Thanks,
Ms. Partner

Administrative Regulations
I’m not the smartest fellow in the world, but I can
sure pick smart colleagues. – Franklin Delano
Roosevelt
Let us never forget that government is ourselves and
not an alien power over us. The ultimate rulers of
our democracy are not a President and senators and
congressmen and government officials, but the
voters of this country. – Franklin Delano Roosevelt

4.1 Learning Objectives for Chapter 4
In working through this chapter, students should strive to be able to:
•

Describe the origins and authority of administrative regulations as a
source of law.

•

Assess the primary publications of federal administrative legal
materials: the Code of Federal Regulations and the Federal Register.

•

Appreciate the similarities and differences between federal
administrative regulations and state administrative regulations.

•

Evaluate the various pieces of information provided in regulatory
publications.

•

Evaluate the use of administrative notices, administrative decisions,
and other administrative materials in interpreting administrative
regulations.

83

4.2 Delegated Rule-Making Authority
As discussed in Chapter 1, each branch of government under a Separation
of Powers system creates its own source of law. In Chapters 2 and 3, we
covered the sources of law that most lay-people would recognize as law:
constitutions, statutes, and judicial opinions. However, in the American
legal system, the executive branch also contributes rules to the body of law.
Executive-made rules take the form of administrative regulations, which
various executive departments, agencies, and commissions issue under an
explicit delegation of rule-making authority from the legislature. Essentially,
the legislature passes a statute with a broad aim, and then delegates a
particular agency of expertise to provide more specific rules aimed at
achieving the broad goal. Lawyers call a statute that creates an agency to
regulate a particular area an “organic statute” or “organic act.”104 Similarly,
an “enabling statute” delegates additional authority to an already existing
agency.105 Both organic statutes and enabling statutes establish broad aims
desired by the legislature and create mechanisms for agencies to provide the
details. As such, regulations tend to be much more specific in nature than
statutes.
Executive agencies possessing delegated legislative authority have existed in
the Anglo-American legal tradition at least since the 1530s, which happens
to be when people also first began recognizing the primacy of legislative
rule-making authority to begin with.106 Since their introduction in Tudor
times, however, executive branches tended to exercise delegated rulemaking authority somewhat sparingly for the next four centuries or so.
Then, in response to the Great Depression in the U.S., the creation of
executive agencies and the use of administrative regulations exploded with
the New Deal of the 1930s. The Roosevelt administration pushed for the
creation of a veritable “alphabet soup” of federal agencies, partially as an act
of job creation, but partially as a way of modernizing the U.S. economy.107

84

However, increasing the amount of regulatory output under delegated
authority raised concerns about democracy and due process. After all, many
of the experts who draft rules for agencies are directly hired by the agency
in question and were not elected by voters. In order to assuage these
concerns, the federal government developed a unique system of publication
of regulations that allows citizens to comment on proposed regulations
before they go into effect. The publication system became formalized by
statute in 1946.108
State executive branches likewise often issue copious amounts of
regulations in the modern era. Furthermore, state publication of
administrative regulations tends to follow the federal model, albeit on a
more limited scale. As the federal system of regulation promulgation
remains the most sophisticated, we will begin by taking a closer look at
federal regulations.

4.3 Researching Federal Regulations
As discussed above, the federal government follows a regimented
publication procedure for administrative regulations in order to comport
with due process. In fact, the federal Government Publishing Office (GPO)
issues three separate publications related to regulatory research: the Code of
Federal Regulations (C.F.R.), the List of Sections Affected (L.S.A.), and the Federal
Register (F.R.). Of the three publications, the C.F.R. allows legal researchers
to look up regulations by topic most easily, while the F.R. contains the most
background information beyond the regulations themselves. The L.S.A. is
used primarily to update C.F.R. sections; think of it as a multi-volume
pocket part. The federal government also creates electronic copies of the
C.F.R. and F.R., but as the system developed in print, we will introduce it in
print in order that students may easily see the interactions between the
various pieces of the system.

4.3.1 The C.F.R.
As the use of the word “code” in its title implies, the C.F.R. contains all
federal regulations currently in force, neatly arranged in topical order.
What the U.S.C. is for federal statutes, the C.F.R. is for federal regulations.
In fact, the two publications share the same basic structure: sections as
108 Administrative Procedure Act, Pub. L. No. 79-404, 60 Stat. 237 (1946)
(codified as amended at 5 U.S.C. §§ 551-559, 701-706, 1305, 3105, 3344, 4301,
5335, 5372, 7521 (2012)).

85

building blocks, housed in chapters/sub-chapters, which in turn get
grouped into titles. However, because of the dense nature of regulations,
the C.F.R. makes use of an additional unit of organization in between the
section and chapter levels. This unit is called a “part.” (Sometimes
“subparts” will also be included.) Nonetheless, the citation of a federal
regulation looks substantially similar to the citation of a federal statute: title
number, C.F.R., section number. A researcher would pull a regulation by
citation just as he would pull a statute by citation.
Legal researchers also go about finding regulations on a specific topic in
the same ways they would go about finding statutes on a specific topic.
Like the U.S.C., the C.F.R. features a series of increasingly-detailed tables
of contents. Also like the U.S.C., the C.F.R. includes an index that
researchers may use to look up specific terms, though researchers should
remember that sometimes a specific term will be located as a subset under
a more general index term. Thus, though the source of law differs,
researchers should generally use the same methods of research covered in
Chapter 2 for codes to discover a specific section within the C.F.R.
However, once a researcher has opened a C.F.R. section, he will note
some key differences, as well as some similarities. Figure 4.3.1a provides
an excerpt from the C.F.R. The first thing the reader probably notices
about the regulation is the incredible level of detail provided, especially
compared to typical statutory language. This language is typical in
regulations. Second, note the lack of annotations. Because regulations
change quickly and possess such a high level of detail, commercial
publishers do not reprint them, and thus no one provides editorial
content. Finally, note that, like the U.S.C., the C.F.R. provides researchers
with citations to each section’s creating and amending documents. In the
C.F.R., these cites refer the researcher to the Federal Register, which will be
discussed in section 4.3.3 below.

86

Figure 4.3.1a: Excerpt from the Code of Federal Regulations

Upon locating a relevant regulation, a good researcher will then flip to the
beginning of the part in which it appears. For instance, the regulation in

87

Figure 4.3.1a, 9 C.F.R. § 77.8, may be found in Subpart B of Part 77 of
Subchapter C of Chapter 1 of Title 9 of the Code of Federal Regulations.109 An
excerpt from the beginning of said Part 77 appears in Figure 4.3.1b. A good
researcher would then do two things. First, he would scan the part’s table of
contents for other sections that may affect his client, including any
definitions or general provisions section. Second, he would look for the
statutory grant of authority for the regulations in question. Remember,
regulations are issued upon delegated authority. The organic and enabling
statutes that did the delegating provide additional necessary avenues of
inquiry when researching situations governed by regulations.

Figure 4.3.1b: Front matter to Part 77 of C.F.R. Title 9,
showing the statutory grant of authority and a portion of the
table of contents, or outline, for Part 77.

Students have been warned, repeatedly, about the highly dense and technical
nature of regulations. The same also applies to C.F.R. organization.
109

88

Thus, the C.F.R. provides a mostly self-contained means to research federal
regulations currently in force. Although the G.P.O. publishes each title of
the C.F.R. annually, as a print source it captures only a specific moment in
time. Because regulations tend to change rapidly, legal researchers should
make sure to update any applicable regulations using the second of the
federal regulatory publications: the L.S.A.

4.3.2 The L.S.A.
As mentioned above, the List of Sections Affected essentially functions as a
giant pocket part to the C.F.R. In fact, the L.S.A. really does what its name
suggests; it lists sections of the C.F.R. that have been affected by
regulations issued after the last printing of the C.F.R. title in which the
section appears.110 An excerpt from the L.S.A. appears in Figure 4.3.2.

110 Each title of the C.F.R. gets published annually, but the exact date of
publication varies by title: Titles 1-16, January 1; Titles 17-27, April 1; Titles 28-41,
July 1; Titles 42-50, October 1. Also, by “1” of each month, we mean the first
business day of each month.

89

Figure 4.3.2: Excerpt from the List of Sections Affected

Note that only C.F.R. sections that have indeed been affected by
subsequent regulation appear in the L.S.A. Thus, if a C.F.R. section does
not appear in the L.S.A., then it has not changed and a researcher is free to
rely upon the version discovered in the C.F.R. itself.

90

Note also that if a C.F.R. section does appear in the L.S.A., meaning that
the text of the regulation has changed since publication, the L.S.A. does not
actually reproduce the updated text of the changed regulation.111 Rather, the
L.S.A. refers the researcher to the number of the page upon which the
researcher can find the updated text. These page numbers refer to pages of
the third of the federal regulatory publications, the Federal Register.

4.3.3 The F.R.
The Federal Register contains much more information than the other federal
regulatory publications. It also predates the C.F.R. by more than a decade
and serves as the primary means by which regulations satisfy due process.
The GPO publishes the F.R. daily.112 The F.R.’s pages number
consecutively per year, meaning that the F.R. issue published on January 2
begins with page 1, while page numbers in December issues often
approach 6 digits. The consecutive pagination is what allows the L.S.A. to
cite the F.R. solely by page number. Other citations to the F.R. proceed as
normal: volume number (each year’s run constitutes a separate volume),
F.R., page number.
When a federal administrative agency wishes to change a regulation or
issue a new regulation, it first issues the regulation as a Proposed Rule in
the Federal Register. Proposed rules provide details on why the regulatory
change is needed and give citizens the opportunity to comment upon the
proposed rule. Thus the Federal Register’s primary purpose is satisfying due
process. The F.R. features its own index which can be used to find rules
by topic. Figure 4.3.3a provides an excerpt from a proposed rule. Please
note, however, that most proposed rules comprise multiple pages.

111

This is where the pocket part analogy breaks down.

112

Meaning, of course, business days.

91

Figure 4.3.3a: Excerpt from a Proposed Rule in the Federal
Register

In addition to proposed rules, agencies also publish final rules in the Federal
Register. For instance, after an agency assesses all the comments submitted
on a proposed rule, it will make necessary changes and issue it as a final
rule. Final rules are then incorporated into the C.F.R. at the appropriate
section as regulations. Because the F.R. publishes the final rules, it works in

92

conjunction with the L.S.A. to update C.F.R. sections. Figure 4.3.3b shows
the final rule in the F.R. alluded to by the L.S.A. in Figure 4.3.2.

Figure 4.3.3b: A Final Rule in the Federal Register

Because of the publication of final rules, researchers may also use old
editions of the Federal Register to find former versions of federal regulations,
much as researchers may use session laws to find former versions of
statutes.

93

In addition to proposed and final rules, the Federal Register also allows
administrative departments and agencies to publish “notices” if they want
the public to be aware of a particular issue. Often notices describe
administrative hearings or orders, but agencies can use them to provide the
public with materials that detail the application of administrative rules.
Notices themselves do not carry the force of law but can often offer
researchers helpful guidance as to how an agency applies its regulations.
Figure 4.3.3c shows an example of a notice in the Federal Register.

94

Figure 4.3.3c: A Notice in the Federal Register.

95

Thus, the Federal Register allows compliance with due process, provides a
means of updating C.F.R. sections, and publishes a wealth of information
lawyers can use for regulatory interpretation. In fact, so useful is the Federal
Register that the GPO now also produces an online version113 that can be
used via the electronic research methods discussed in Chapter 5. Altogether,
the federal government provides a robust publication system for conducting
regulatory research.

4.3.4 Administrative Decisions & Guidance
The federal regulatory publishing system described above is
comprehensive in that it contains regulations and some supporting
materials from all federal agencies. However, the Federal Register does not
contain all of the work produced by federal agencies, many of which
publish their own titles containing supplemental information.
Furthermore, commercial publishers will sometimes gather and publish
administrative materials on certain topics. The publications available for
administrative materials vary by agency and topic, but researchers can
consult Table 1.2 of The Bluebook to determine which publications are
available for any particular federal agency.114
Legal researchers tend to think of supplementary materials produced by
administrative agencies in two broad categories: administrative decisions
and administrative guidance. While neither of these types of publications
create binding rules of law, researchers often use them to help interpret
regulations that do possess the force of law. Let us first look at
administrative decisions.
Administrative decisions resemble judicial opinions, except that they are
issued by agencies’ own hearings or review boards that lack the force of
precedent and therefore do not generate common law.115 This is because
administrative adjudicative bodies derive their authority from
Congressional delegation and thus are generally treated as “Article I
Courts” after the article of the Constitution providing for Congressional

113

https://www.federalregister.gov/.

THE BLUEBOOK: A UNIFORM SYSTEM OF CITATION 236-248 tbl.T.1.2
(Columbia Law Review Ass’n et al. eds., 20th ed. 1st prtg. 2015).

114

115 Note that terminology varies from agency to agency. Some agencies may have
“boards” to hear administrative cases, while others may have “panels” or use
some other term. A common thread is that members of agency adjudicative
panels are referred to as ALJs or Administrative Law Judges.

96

power.116 Only “Article III Courts,” those courts whose authority derives
directly from the Constitutional article granting power to the Judiciary, act
as common law courts.117
Researchers may find administrative decisions in a variety of places. First,
many individual agency publications contain decisions, and these
publications can generally be found in print at libraries participating in the
Federal Depository Library Program. For example, decisions of the
Interior Board of Indian Appeals appear in Interior Decisions, the reporter of
administrative decisions compiled by the Department of the Interior and
sent to Federal Depository Libraries by the GPO.
However, visiting a Federal Depository Library and/or enlisting the aid of
a government documents librarian can be time consuming. For this
reason, the full-service legal search platforms all include at least some
administrative decisions, which can be found using the methods described
in Chapter 5. The websites of agencies themselves also often link to their
administrative decisions. Researchers should consult the United States
Government Manual118 for an official listing of all federal agencies, and
USA.gov provides links to the agency websites. Regardless of how a
researcher finds administrative decisions, he may use them to help
interpret regulations but should not rely on them as common-law
precedent.
In addition to issuing decisions actively applying their regulations to
controversies, most agencies also produce manuals and other internal
documents that researchers can use to determine how an agency is likely to
interpret its own regulations. These materials are referred to as
“administrative guidance.” For example, the Internal Revenue Service
(I.R.S.) publishes the Internal Revenue Manual,119 which describes how the
I.R.S. conducts its business. While administrative guidance materials vary
from agency to agency, researchers should be able to find them in similar

116

See BLACK’S LAW DICTIONARY 134 (10th ed. 2014).

117

See BLACK’S LAW DICTIONARY 135 (10th ed. 2014).

The United States Government Manual is the official handbook of the federal

97

ways to administrative decisions: in Federal Depository Libraries, in
commercial databases, or on agency websites. Regardless of the form the
materials take, researchers can use them to help interpret and apply federal
administrative regulations as a source of law.

4.4 State Regulations
State executive agencies also issue binding administrative regulations,
though not to the same extent as federal agencies. At first this may strike
the reader as counterintuitive. If federal competency is limited to
enumerated powers only, would one not expect to find less, rather than
more federal regulations? The answer to this quandary lies in two facts.
First, administrative regulations often target complicated commercial and
industrial activities, and so regulating interstate state commerce requires
numerous and detailed regulations in a variety of areas. Second, state
budgets tend to pale in comparison to the federal budget. Thus, federal
agencies tend to be more numerous and better staffed than state agencies.
Nonetheless, state executive branches do regulate certain activities within
their states.
In format, administrative regulations will vary state by state to a certain
degree, but they often mimic the form of federal regulations. For example,
Figure 4.4 shows an administrative regulation from Kentucky. Note the
explicit reference to the statutory grant of authority, just like federal
regulations contain. Also, if a researcher flipped to the beginning of either
the chapter or title that house the particular regulation (Chapter 10, and
Title 902 respectively), he would find a table of contents for that particular
unit of organization. Also, most state administrative codes include a
topical index at the end. Thus, legal researchers interact with state
administrative codes in the same ways they would with the C.F.R.
Furthermore, citation of state administrative regulations tends to resemble
that of federal regulations, though of course this varies depending upon
the state.120 Typically, though, lawyers cite state administrative codes in the
standard title number-code abbreviation-section number format.

For a complete list of state administrative regulation citation schemes, see THE
BLUEBOOK: A UNIFORM SYSTEM OF CITATION 248-302 tbl.T.1.3 (Columbia Law
review Ass’n et al. eds., 20th ed. 1st prtg. 2015).
120

98

Figure 4.4: 902 KAR 10:130

Most states also publish administrative registers, in the style of the Federal
Register. However, most state administrative registers amount to very poor
imitations of the F.R. (mostly because the states themselves are much
poorer entities than the federal government). For instance, Kentucky’s
administrative register is published monthly (as opposed to daily) and
contains far less information. It still provides citizens with notice of
proposed rule changes, and researchers still can use it to update
administrative code sections, though state administrative codes usually are
not big enough to require a separate list of sections affected. (Affected
sections instead typically appear in list form in part of the administrative
register.)
Also like federal agencies, state agencies both hold hearings that lead to
administrative decisions and create internal documentation that
researchers can use for administrative guidance. As with the other
administrative materials, the availability of administrative decisions and
guidance varies state by state and tends to be less prevalent at the state
level than the federal level. Students interested in conducting state
administrative research should contact a law librarian in their state to learn
what sources are available.

99

Thus, legal researchers typically interact with state administrative materials
in the same ways with which they interact with federal regulatory
publications. Indeed, the major differences between federal and state
regulatory publications are differences of scale. It is important that aspiring
lawyers learn to interact with regulations at both the state and federal
levels, as regulations act as the source of law for the executive branch and
often govern commercial activities in their jurisdiction.
We have now introduced students to all the building blocks of modern
legal research. Let us now turn our attention to the predominant means of
finding those blocks: electronic research.

4.5.2 Intermediate Exercise on Researching Administrative
Guidance
Dear Team:
We have been engaged by Sinclair Upton, a research scientist and product
developer for Bow Chow Industries, Inc., a pet food manufacturer. Dr.
Upton is concerned about some of the additives that Bow Chow puts into
one of its lines of canned dog food. He is considering whistle-blowing on
the company to the F.D.A. as a confidential informant. Before he does,
however, he would like assurances that the F.D.A. will preserve his
anonymity. I need you to find some F.D.A. guidance documents
(preferably the F.D.A. manual) that outline their procedures for
interviewing informants and protecting the anonymity of confidential
informants in the context of the F.D.A.’s inspection procedures related to
animal food additives. Let me know what you find.

Regards,
Mr. Partner

4.5.3 Advanced Exercise on Researching Regulations
Hello all,
Last week when I was having my annual check-up, my allergist, Dr. Billie
Mayes, mentioned that she’s been working on a new generic inhaler
(tentatively to be marketed as “The Wheeze-Whacker”) which I currently
take the designer version of. Unfortunately, she told me that she could not
get it to work without using an ozone-damaging aerosol, and that she is
afraid the FDA, under the influence of the EPA, will not allow the inhaler
to go to market. The generic would potentially save individual asthma
sufferers between six hundred and twelve hundred dollars a year, so I told
her I’d have my people look into it.
Dr. Mayes describes the Wheeze-Whacker as a “super short-acting, rescue
bronchodilator extraordinaire.” Each unit consists of 200 metered doses
with an extra 4 “priming doses.” The active moieties in the inhaler are
flunisolide and albuterol.
I would like you to answer the following:
1) Find a federal regulation on using aerosols that damage the ozone
in drugs, specifically asthma inhalers.
2) Assuming such a regulation exists, does it prohibit the use of said
aerosols, and if so, does it include any exceptions? (Asthma drugs
are life-savers; surely there are exceptions for things of that
nature!)
3) Would the Wheeze-Whacker, in its specific make-up, qualify
under a necessity-type (or however they phrase it) exception?
What authority supports your answer?
4) What statute(s) grant(s) authority to the FDA to regulate the use
of ozone-damaging aerosols in drugs such as inhalers?

Thanks,
Mr. Partner

5.2 Introduction to Electronic Research
While the advent of computers and the Internet have revolutionized the
practice of law, aspiring legal researchers should note that the goals of legal
research remain the same regardless of whether one uses computers or
books. At its core, the practice of law consists of locating relevant legal
authorities, applying the authorities to a set of facts, and then
communicating the predicted or desired result of the application. Thus,
legal researchers seek the same sources of law with computers that they do
with books: constitutions, statutes, judicial opinions, and administrative
regulations.
Furthermore, computers did not achieve prominence until roughly a
hundred years after the professionalization of the practice of law. As a
result, the major legal publishers originally crafted their information systems
in a strictly paper-based world. While the same publishers later quickly
realized the potential advantages of using computers for legal research, they
did not abandon their underlying information systems. Thus, not only will
legal researchers find the text of the underlying legal authorities to be the
same in electronic format as in print, but the publishers also provide the
same added-value content, such as key numbers, case headnotes, and code
annotations.121
Though they facilitate the same goals of research as print-based resources,
computers do revolutionize the process. Electronic research can be a much
more efficient way of accessing legal authorities than finding them in books.
Computers, particularly networked computers (i.e. the Internet), by their
nature hold vastly more information than a single book. Furthermore,
hyperlinks allow researchers to jump from one information object to
another without the need to retrieve a separate volume for each piece of
information. While a researcher using print resources might use four
volumes from three different sets just to find a single case,122 a researcher

The use of editorial content, even in electronic form, can be a highly efficient
way to research. Students are encouraged to make use of relevant headnotes and
annotations at every opportunity. However, as not all legal research platforms
benefit from the inclusion of editorial content, in this chapter we will focus on the
basic processes of electronic research that can be used universally.
121

122 For example: a volume of the Descriptive Word Index of the Kentucky Digest,
2d; a main volume of the Kentucky Digest, 2d; a volume of the South Western Reporter;
and a volume of Shepard’s Kentucky Citations. This example also leaves out the
pocket parts, supplements, and advance sheets that should be consulted.

107

using a computer might find several cases in a fraction of the time using just
a few clicks of a mouse.
Another advantage computers offer the legal researcher stems from the fact
that they process large amounts of information very quickly. As such, a
computer, and the research platforms built on them, can “read” a
document much faster than a person can. However, computers are not
actually good at understanding what they “read.” Thus, while a search
engine could help a researcher quickly find every instance of the phrase
“custodial interrogation” in Kentucky state court cases from the past
decade, it would not yet be able to summarize accurately what Kentucky
courts have held to be the key features that render the interrogation of a
suspect by the police “custodial.” A researcher would need to read through
the results to find the appropriate rulings but would be spared the work of
actually gathering the results.
Given the efficiency boost computers provide to legal research, it should
come as no surprise that creating and maintaining electronic legal research
tools has become a large and profitable business. Equally unsurprisingly,
many of the major players in the electronic legal research platform business
began as traditional paper-based legal publishers. After all, the publishers
already had on hand not only the ultimate goals of legal research, the
primary legal authorities, but also their proprietary information systems and
added-value content. Practicing attorneys were already accustomed to using
the proprietary systems to great effect. Furthermore, the pre-computer
systems actually help to address computers’ weakness in the comprehension
department. For example, the West key number system features a key
number for the issue “what constitutes custody,”123 and by using the
headnotes labeled with this key number, the researcher from the above
example could narrow in on the relevant parts of individual cases that
appear in the search results.
As with most industries, the legal research platform business features
various market segments. At the top end of the market lie full-service legal
platforms such as Westlaw and Lexis Advance that will meet fully the needs
of legal researchers across American legal topics and jurisdictions. More
recently, Bloomberg L.P. (an electronic resource publisher focusing on
news and finance) has branched into the legal information market and now
offers Bloomberg Law as a third full-service legal research platform. A key

123

Criminal Law (110) k 411.21

108

feature of the full-service providers, beyond their breadth of coverage and
proprietary search algorithms, remains the inclusion of human-created
value-added content to support basic computer processing.
The legal research platform market also features budget model legal
platforms, such as Casemaker, Fastcase, and LoislawConnect. Generally
speaking, the budget models rely on search algorithms to a much greater
extent and include little or no human-generated content. While these
services come with a significantly lower price tag than the full service
providers, they require more effort and attention from researchers using
them.
In between the top end of the market and the budget models, many
publishers offer niche services. For example, Thomson Reuters, in addition
to Westlaw, produces RIA Checkpoint, an electronic research platform
devoted to tax law research. Similarly, Wolters Kluwer provides CCH
Intelliconnect, a service also focused on tax. Another example comes from
William S. Hein & Co., which offers HeinOnline, a platform focusing on
academic and historic legal materials, while ProQuest’s Legislative Insight
provides legislative history documents in digital form. Niche electronic legal
research platforms vary in the amount of human-generated features they
use.
Despite the proliferation of various types of electronic research platforms,
they tend to interact with information in similar ways regardless of specific
programming. Thus, an aspiring legal researcher would be well served to
focus on basic processes of electronic research, which then could be used
on any and all electronic research platforms (legal or otherwise).

5.3 Basic Processes of Electronic Research
It is probably not a stretch to surmise that the majority of American law
students in the 21st Century possess extensive experience with the Internet.
People use the same basic processes to navigate the Internet whether they
do so to perform in-depth research, to shop for a new pair of shoes, or to
check the box score of last night’s basketball game. Searching, browsing,
and filtering124 are the actions that comprise the navigation of electronic
materials. Aspiring legal researchers most likely perform all three actions in

“Filtering” is sometimes also referred to as “limiting” or “selecting facets.” For
purposes of clarity and consistency, “filtering” will be used here.
124

109

accessing the Internet and probably do so quite frequently. The same basic
actions will be used for electronic legal research.
This is not to say, however, that law students already know how to use
electronic resources to research effectively. Law, in its myriad sources, is a
complex system. Furthermore, law involves the interpretation of the
meaning of words, an activity for which computers are currently ill-suited.
Thus, while the basic processes used for recreational Internet-surfing will
be the same as those that are used for legal research, a greater level of
precision and efficiency must be employed for the latter lest one be
inundated by irrelevant results, as seen in Figure 5.3.

110

Figure 5.3: Searching for “due process” on Westlaw yields
10,000 cases, which is an artificial limit set by West. Click
here for screencast: http://youtu.be/7hpGX75yniY.

Too many results can be just as bad for a legal researcher as too few. Not
only will she not have time to read through all the results, but they may
not all be relevant to her problem. Citing something that does not apply to

111

the case at hand looks just as bad as failing to cite a key opinion that does
apply. For these reasons, it is of paramount importance that law students
work to become precise, efficient researchers.

5.3.1 Searching
In daily life, most people retrieve information from the Internet by
searching. Thus, most aspiring legal researchers will be familiar with the
rudiments of the process. After all, we have even named the programs we
use to find information on the Internet “search engines.” Furthermore, the
name of the most successful and widely used of the search engines has
achieved synonymy with “looking stuff up on the Internet.”125
At its core, searching is a simple process that consists of typing terms into a
text box, referred to as a “search bar,” and then scanning through the
results. The terms typed may be as simple as a single word or as complex as
complete sentences. For example, if I wanted to find out how many sets of
Duplo blocks126 I would need to buy to complete my son’s zoo collection, I
could search for the single word “Duplo,” search for a phrase such as
“Duplo zoo sets,” or even ask a question: “How many zoo sets does Duplo
make?” The search engine then uses an algorithm to scan websites and
return results likely to give me the information I need.
Note that the search algorithm does not actually comprehend what is on
each page, it merely counts terms (and sometimes synonyms for the terms,
depending on the algorithm) and links and returns sites that may answer my
question. Therefore, I would still need to evaluate the results in order to
choose the one most likely to have my information. In this case, I would
trust Lego’s website to accurately list all Duplo zoo sets in production. I
would trust Lego’s website as Lego is the maker of the toys and has a
commercial interest in selling its products. Whereas a vendor like Amazon
would only let me know what sets it currently had available for sale, Lego as
the manufacturer would most likely let me know of every set in production
and would likely even offer suggestions as to where I could purchase them.
The evaluation and selection of appropriate websites or resources for a
given problem, like I have described here, is sometimes referred to as
“information literacy.”

125

For example, “I don’t know; have you tried Googling it?”

Duplo is the line of plastic blocks for toddlers made by Danish toy-making
giant, Lego.
126

112

The searches for Duplo blocks described above use terms and sentences
from everyday conversational use. Programmers and web designers refer to
these as “natural language searches.” Natural language searches generally
rely on a search engine’s algorithm to find relevant information, a technique
that works reasonably well when one uses a unique term such as the brand
name Duplo. However, because of the volume of results returned, natural
language searches require a relatively robust application of information
literacy to determine which result is best suited to answer the problem at
hand.
For complex fields of knowledge such as law, beginning researchers may
find the application of advanced information literacy challenging. After all,
law comprises multitudes of individual information objects from a
multitude of different jurisdictions. It may take several years of experience
before a researcher achieves full literacy in the variety of sources that make
up the field and is able to identify quickly the most relevant sources to a
research problem. Aside from requiring a high-level of information literacy,
natural language searches also often return too many results, or results not
precise enough for the needs of the researcher. This is especially true for
fields with controlled vocabularies and frequent reuse of terms. Law, of
course, with its multiple sources, multiple jurisdictions, and many terms of
art, is such a field.
This is not to say that full service legal information providers do not
support natural language searching; in fact, the platforms of the current
generation of legal search providers default to a natural language search,
mostly as a response to the rise of Google. While it is possible to use a
natural language search as a starting point for legal research, it is best suited
for relatively simple legal questions, and even then usually returns a
relatively large number of results that will require a researcher with good
information literacy skills to be able to recognize what is most useful. It will
also likely involve further substantial research. For example, the search in
Figure 5.3.1 seeks an answer to the question of whether California
recognizes common law marriages, a relatively straight-forward yes-or-no
question, and returns over 33,000 results. Note that the algorithm (which
West tailored specifically for legal research) does present authority to
answer the yes or no question; however, it also presents a lot of information
that does not answer the question. It would be up to the researcher to
determine which of the results provide proper legal authority to answer the
question. Thus, natural language searching is usually not the most efficient
way to research complex issues of law.

113

5.3.2 Search Operators & Advance Searching
Happily, the creators of the full service legal information platforms (and
indeed the creators of search engines generally) include in their products
tools that enable legal researchers to take greater control of the search from
the algorithm in order to achieve more precise results. Programmers call
these tools “operators” because they operate upon the basic search function
to modify the algorithm used, and researchers can usually find a list of
available operators through an “advanced search” interface. Advanced
searching encompasses several different types of operators, most notably
for legal research: connectors, expanders, and fields.
Connectors are terms that alert the research platform that the researcher
would like to limit results to pieces of information that contain specific
search criteria; they effectively narrow the search results. For instance, the
connector & used in between two terms on Westlaw tells the computer that
you would only like results that contain both terms you are looking for and
not one or the other. To further narrow the search results, /p could be
used between two terms to tell the research platform that not only would
the researcher like the results to contain both terms but that she would like
both terms to occur in the same paragraph. Different platforms sometimes
recognize slightly different connectors but usually a researcher will be able

114

to find a list of recognized connectors via a link on the research platform
itself.127
Expanders work similarly to connectors in that researchers use them in
combination with search terms in order to modify results of a search.
Whereas connectors work in between terms to connect two or more terms
and limit the search results, expanders work to broaden the search results.
For example, on Westlaw the ! functions as a root expander. This means
that a researcher could use an exclamation point to retrieve multiple
variations of a word from a common root. For instance, searching for the
term declar! would return results containing the following words: declare,
declaring, declarant, declaration, etc. Thus, while connectors tend to limit
results, expanders will sometimes yield more results but will obviate the
need for multiple searches if searching for a term that exists in multiple
variations.
Aspiring legal researchers may encounter the phrase “terms and
connectors” in reference to using both connectors and expanders.
Technically, the word “connectors” refers to the search operators while
“terms” refers to the researcher’s individual search terms, which would
need to be generated even for a natural language search. Using connectors
along with terms, however, better allows a researcher to limit results to only
those most relevant to the problem at hand. Figure 5.3.2a provides a list of
commonly recognized search operators.

127 On Westlaw, click “advanced” next to the search button for a list of
connectors; on Lexis Advance click “Advanced Search” just above the search box
on the right side of the home page; on Bloomberg Law, run a keyword search and
then a “search help” link will appear next to the keyword search box.

Figure 5.3.2a: Commonly Used Connectors and Expanders
Often, expert legal researchers will combine search terms, connectors, and
expanders into a single search as a way to get precise, relevant results. When
constructing advanced searches using multiple operators, it is sometimes
helpful to break your search query into individual parts with parentheses. At
one point in time the parentheses were necessary to tell the computer the
order in which the operators should be applied (much as parentheses work

116

in math problems). Today most legal research platforms no longer need the
parentheses, but it can be helpful to the researcher to identify visually how
the operators will be applied. For example, if I wanted to use Westlaw to
find the Oregon cases in which embryos are discussed as property in a
divorce, I might craft the following search:
advanced: embryo! /p property /p (divorce OR
“dissolution of marriage”)

The hypothetical search above contains a series of operators, as well as four
terms that I think describe my legal problem. For instance, advanced: tells
Westlaw that I am interested in applying operators to my search rather than
relying on a natural language search. The operator ! after embryo tells
Westlaw that I am interested in results with the term embryo with various
endings since I want to retrieve cases that discuss one embryo as well as
those that discuss multiple embryos. The operator /p tells Westlaw that I
want the search terms embryo! and property to appear in the same
paragraph, since if the terms appear in proximity to one another they are
probably being discussed in relation to one another. I’ve specified for
Westlaw two synonyms since I don’t know which term Oregon will use in
their case law – divorce or dissolution of marriage. And I’ve put the phrase
“dissolution of marriage” in quotes to indicate that I want results with that
exact phrase, not just the term dissolution appearing in one paragraph and
the term marriage appearing twenty paragraphs later. By using these
operators I have narrowed my results to those likely to address my specific
problem, though I will still need to explore additional avenues to make sure
I’ve explored all possible options.

117

Figure 5.3.2b: An advanced search using multiple operators

Field searching represents an alternative way to limit research results
through use of an operator. When legal information providers upload
sources of law to their electronic platforms, they often divide the source
information into different segments or fields. Researchers may then search
each of these fields individually. Different sources may contain different
fields. For instance, on Westlaw codified statutes are broken into nine
fields: preliminary, caption, preliminary/caption (in other words, the first

118

two fields combined), citation, annotations, credit, statutory text, historical
notes, and words & phrases (a specific finding aid originally produced as a
print publication). Meanwhile, the same provider divides published cases
into twenty-four separate fields: date, party name, citation, synopsis, digest,
synopsis/digest, judge, attorney, court name/prelim, docket number,
background, concurring, court abbreviation, dissenting, full text, headnote,
holding, lead notes, opinions, panel, topic, words & phrases, and written by.
Though the fields vary, a researcher can use any individual field to increase
the precision of a search.128
By this point, most law students probably understand the need to vary
potential search fields by search. After all, what would be the point of
including a field for “statutory text” for a document that is not a statute?
Similarly, law students no doubt recognize “concurring” and “dissenting” as
pertaining to judicial opinions, and as things that only matter in caselaw.
Law students may also have recognized that some of the fields correspond
to value-added content that West, as a publisher, adds to primary source
documents, such as headnotes. The replication of these print-based
information systems, when combined with the ability to field search, gives
legal researchers the ability to narrowly tailor their searches to be as precise
as possible.
To conduct a fielded search, a researcher may either enter an advanced
search interface and type terms into the appropriate boxes or add field
commands to a hand-crafted search. Note, however, that different
publishers assign different fields to different sources. Furthermore, the
abbreviated field search commands vary from platform to platform, so it
may be a good idea to at least scope out the advanced search interface or
click on a help button when conducting a field search. Expert researchers
often use field searches in combination with other search operators.

128 Finding out what part of the document each field is referring to can be a
challenge. On Westlaw, go the advanced search page for that kind of document
(statute, case, etc.) and on the right there will be an image that highlights each part
of the document. On Lexis Advance, go to the “Advanced Search” link above
the search bar on the right side, and then choose content type, and there will be
an image on the right that highlights each part of the document. On Bloomberg
Law, field searching is more limited; the existing fields can be found by clicking
on the tabs for the type of document and then the search option. E.g. “Litigation
& Dockets” and then “Search Court Opinions” to find fields for searching cases.

119

Figure 5.3.2c: An advanced search on Westlaw using a field

Though search operators offer researchers greater control over the
precision of searches, even well-crafted advanced searches, if performed on
databases comprising multiple jurisdictions and sources, often still yield
thousands of results. A practicing attorney will not necessarily have time to
read through even a few hundred legal authorities. Thus, good researchers
combine searching with other techniques.

5.3.3 Browsing
In an electronic research context, browsing refers to the process of clicking
through a website’s inherent organization to narrow in on the information
one is seeking. Most aspiring legal researchers probably already engage in
this sort of activity in everyday web use. Indeed, one hears the term “web
browsing” almost as often as one hears the term “search engine.” An
example of common everyday use of browsing on the web is the checking
of sports scores. I typically check the previous night’s basketball scores over
my morning cup of coffee by going to espn.com, clicking on the “NBA”
tab, and then clicking on the “scores” tab that appears in the dropdown
menu beneath “NBA.” Thus, I use the site’s internal organization to bring
up the information I want.
All websites feature the inherent organization that make browsing possible,
but legal search providers excel at it. For instance, Lexis Advance allows
researchers to browse by source, jurisdiction, or topic (as defined by the
LexisNexis editors). By browsing by topic, researchers can find authorities

120

related to a specific subtopic of the law. Similarly, by browsing by source,
researchers can identify specific sources of interest. West, Bloomberg, and
other legal information providers follow similar schemes. However, not
only do the publishers provide organization, but many of the legal sources,
such as topically-organized codes, contain their own inherent structure.
Thus, a good legal researcher can sometimes find what she needs just by
clicking through a legal search platform.

121

Broadly speaking, browsing resembles using a book’s table of contents to
find information via the work’s organization, while searching is akin to
using as index as it allows researchers to find instances of specific words or
phrases.129 Both techniques work to find specific information, but
sometimes the most efficient way to research an issue fully is to combine
both techniques. When researching electronically, researchers can also
combine searching and browsing with a third technique: filtering.

5.3.4 Filtering
Filtering is a process by which electronic researchers focus on some search
results while excluding others. It works somewhat similarly to field
searching in that information providers assign metadata130 to individual
information objects which researchers may then use to separate the wheat
from the chaff. Of Internet sites encountered in everyday life, the online
retailer Amazon may be the most obvious user of filters. Amazon’s filters
allow would-be customers to find exactly what they are looking for among a
multitude of results. For example, if one wanted to buy soccer shoes from
Amazon, one could search for “soccer shoes” and then filter the results by
brand, size, color, and even average customer review, which are all pieces of
metadata collected by Amazon and applied to each individual product entry.
Filtering may be the most flexible of the electronic information gathering
processes. It can be performed pre-search or post-search. Furthermore,
most sites (including the legal information providers) allow users to remove
filters and instantaneously receive the full results of an unfiltered search.

Note that an index may actually be more helpful than a full-text search, as
indexes typically employ controlled vocabularies and are generally created by
humans who understand the meaning of a search term and so link it to where it is
actually discussed as opposed to merely appearing in the text, which is all a
computer can recognize. In fact, publishers recognize the value of indexes and
include them in digital form for many of the sources published on electronic
platforms.

129

The term metadata refers to any data describing an underlying piece of data
used to make computers work. For example, tagging a photo on Facebook with
the names of people in the photo is providing metadata about the photo that will
enable other Facebook users to find it if they search for the name of a tagged
individual. Pieces of metadata can be called different things but fields, tags, and
facets are some common terms.
130

122

Legal researchers should therefore feel confident that they will not lose vital
information by filtering.
Legal information providers generally build a number of useful filters into
their platforms. Commonly used filters include source type (statute, case,
regulation, etc.), jurisdiction, date, topic (as assigned by editors working for
the information provider), and similarly useful facets.131 Researchers may
typically find available filters listed in a box to the left of delivered search
results. Figure 5.3.4 shows the use of filters on Bloomberg Law.

Filtering is a powerful, powerful tool that allows researchers to hone in on
particularly relevant information without discarding other potentially useful
results.

In the case of Westlaw, the topic and key number system developed by West
for print resources are often included as facets.

5.4 Combining the Basic Processes for Efficient Research
While a researcher can use any of searching, browsing, and filtering to find
relevant results, the best researchers often combine the basic processes to
find the best results the most efficiently.132 To a certain extent, this is true
of all electronic information gathering, whether for formal research or
personal use. For example, if I wanted to download a new fantasy book to
read for some good, old-fashioned escapism I might use all three basic
processes on Amazon’s website. First, I would browse through Amazon’s
internal organization to get to “fantasy” as a sub-genre under Kindle ebooks. Next, I would enter a search term, such as “urban,” for a particular
type of fantasy setting. Finally, I would apply a filter for an average
customer review of 4 stars or higher (there is a lot of bad fantasy out there).
As the example above illustrates, much web navigation that most people
would probably regard as fairly routine regularly combines searching,
browsing, and filtering. Of course, doing so efficiently becomes more
important the more complexity one’s research task possesses. Unfortunately
for aspiring legal researchers, American law tends to be one of the more
complex subjects to research.133
Like most complicated tasks, the knowledge of when to shift from
searching to browsing to filtering and back to achieve ideal efficiency
improves with practice and experience. First year law students should focus
on mastering the individual processes134 of electronic research and
developing an awareness of the potential power in combining them. For
instance, in order to find caselaw on Bloomberg Law to determine whether
juveniles are constitutionally entitled to jury trials in Kentucky, I would start
by browsing down to “court opinions” from Kentucky courts. Then, I
would construct a well-formed advanced search. In this case, my terms are
likely to be: juvenile, jury trial, and constitutional. Furthermore, I want the

132 Note that, while I used Westlaw to demonstrate searching, LexisNexis to
demonstrate browsing, and Bloomberg to demonstrate filtering, all three
platforms support all three activities, as do virtually all other electronic search
platforms.
133 On the plus side, thanks to the full-service legal information providers
described elsewhere in this chapter, the bulk of the law can actually be found on
the web. Again, electronic research, done properly, can be much more efficient
than paper-based research.

This includes moving beyond the comfort of the Google-style search bar and
using advanced search techniques.
134

124

jury trial to be related to the constitutional issue, so I would add connectors
and construct the search as follows:
(“jury trial” /s constitution!) AND juvenile

This well-crafted search yields a workable number of cases, but for good
measure I would add filters to make sure I start with the case that I really
want. Specifically, I would add a topical filter (criminal law) and a court
filter (KY Supreme Court) to return topically significant and fully
mandatory cases. I have thus trimmed my results down to two cases, one of
which is unreported, and the other of which is the controlling precedent on
the issue. After I read the controlling case, I can always expand my research
by removing filters.

126

Thus, using advanced searching, browsing, and filtering enables a legal
researcher to give the search engine enough guidance to find what the
researcher needs. In essence, the entirety of the law is at the researcher’s
disposal, and the trick for the researcher is finding a way to tell the search
engine which specific source, of the millions that comprise the law, that the
researcher needs. Searching, browsing, and filtering all help to limit the
universe of potential results to only those that are most relevant.
A well-trained legal researcher with a networked computer can gather in a
matter of hours the number of relevant legal authorities that used to take
lawyers days to assemble using print publications, yet gathering sources is
not the only efficiency upgrade that computers offer to legal researchers.
Electronic research also eclipses print research when it comes to updating
the law.

5.5 Using Finding Aids in an Online Environment
The basic processes of electronic research can be combined not only with
each other but with finding aids such as headnotes, topics and key
numbers, statute annotations, tables of contents, and indexes that also
exist on the legal research platform. Although some of these may at first
seem like outdated holdovers from a print-based world, these finding aids
are still extremely useful as they provide alternative research entry points
and research tracks when the other research processes fall short. Statute
annotations remain an important finding aid for identifying relevant cases
in electronic legal research; on Westlaw and Lexis Advance they are called
“Notes of Decisions”. On Westlaw they are located on their own tab
above the statute text; on Lexis Advance they are located below the text of
the statute. Bloomberg Law does not provide statute annotations. Note
that the cases listed in the Notes of Decisions are only a subset of the
cases identified in the statute’s citing references. The citing references to a
statute contain a complete list of every case on that legal research platform
that cites back to that statute. By contract, the Notes of Decisions only
contain cases that the Westlaw and Lexis Advance editors decided were
important enough to highlight and summarize for the researcher. This
often makes them a good starting point when looking for cases that apply
a statute in particular circumstances.
While statutes and regulations can be browsed to, searched in, and filtered,
a thorough researcher should remember that because codes are organized
topically, the table of contents is still valuable in an electronic
environment. For example, a researcher could browse down via the legal

127

research platform’s inherent organization to the table of contents of the
United States Code, and then further browse the table of contents to find
statutes relating to a particular topic. Alternatively, if a researcher finds a
topically relevant statute or regulation by searching, the thorough
researcher will be sure to use the table of contents navigation available to
look at the sections nearby in the same chapter (or other relevant
organizational unit) to see if any of them also apply to the problem at
hand.
Indexes are also useful entry points in an electronic universe for the same
reasons they are useful in print. An index may recommend alternative
wording or terms that the source actually uses rather than the terms the
researcher thinks it will use; sometimes a natural language search algorithm
will return such synonyms or alternative phrasings, but sometimes they
will not. An index will highlight entries where the term is actually
discussed in the text of the regulation or statute rather than a search
engine picking up all the statutes or regulations where the term was
mentioned in passing, or maybe even just mentioned in an annotation
rather than in the text itself. Not all legal research platforms include
indexes. Bloomberg Law typically has none, Lexis Advance includes them
for a few resources, and Westlaw generally provides indexes for primary
materials if an index existed for it in print. See Figure 5.5a below for using
tables of contents and indexes online.

Westlaw. Click here for screencast:

128

Finding aids for cases have also made it onto the legal research platforms.
The West system of headnotes, topics, and keynumbers only exists
electronically on Westlaw, as West has a financial interest in not licensing
their well-developed classification scheme to their competitors. Lexis
Advance has developed similar functionality; however, Lexis Advance’s
topics tend to be less specific than West key numbers (though they have
the bonus of classifying additional documents besides just cases).
Bloomberg Law’s topics are only applied to limited sets of cases rather
than nearly all cases as on Westlaw and Lexis Advance.
While it is possible to browse the topic systems on Westlaw and Lexis
Advance, it can be a difficult process because of the very specific legal
terminology employed; there’s no equivalent of the print Description
Word Index for either system. It is generally easier to find specific topics
by looking at the headnotes of relevant cases the researcher has already
identified via other means, e.g. statute annotations or a secondary source.
Once a topic is identified from the headnote, the researcher can click on it
to bring up a list of cases classified under that topic that can then be
filtered or searched. On Westlaw, it is also easier to browse to
neighboring key numbers once a key number that is somewhat on topic
has been identified.

5.6 Electronic Citators
As discussed earlier when introducing the various sources of law in their
print forms, law tends to change. Statutes may be amended or declared
unconstitutional. Cases may be overruled or superseded by statute.
Regulations may be repealed or modified by new regulations. Thus,
finding the law represents only the first step. A legal researcher also needs
to update the law to make sure the source she found remains valid. Over
the years, legal publishers developed systems that aided researchers in this
task. Print codes receive pocket parts that alert researchers to amendments
made in statutes. Shepard’s developed a system for informing researchers
what sorts of subsequent treatment a case received. The federal
government published the List of Sections affected to tell researchers
which regulations changed. Computers render print-based updating
services obsolete.
Citators are tools developed by legal information providers that aid
researchers in determining a source’s subsequent treatment, i.e. how a
source has been treated by authorities that came after it. This process is
often referred to as “updating the law.” Note that the word “citator,”
which legal information providers more or less made up, contains the
same root as the word “citation.” The name stems from the way citators
are created. Essentially, legal information providers gather all subsequent

130

authorities that cite the earlier authority in question and then determine
how those subsequent authorities have impacted the original authority.
Legal information providers go about building citators in two broad ways.
Budget model platforms, such as Casemaker and Fastcase, use algorithms
for both the gathering of subsequent sources and the determination of
impact. Essentially, they construct a search algorithm that finds all cites of
the original search and then looks for certain key terms, such as
“overruled” or “superseded,” nearby the citation. The algorithm, based on
its count of terms, then makes an attempt at determining whether or not
the original authority continues as valid precedent (or is still “good law,” as
we say colloquially). The problem with this approach is that computers
excel at computation but struggle with the nuance of language. Humans
recognize shades in meaning and the subtleties of language but sometimes
give in to the temptation of the rhetorical flourish. Thus, judges writing
opinions sometimes include words that mean different things in different
contexts, and computers sometimes count the words as meaning
something they do not.
An algorithm-generated citator is better than nothing,135 but by far the
preferable approach is to trust humans with extensive legal training to
make determinations of the impact of subsequent authorities upon a
source. The primary drawback of this approach is that humans with
extensive legal training tend to expect extensive compensation (at least
compared to a computer which requires only a power source), and so only
the expensive, full-service legal information providers have managed to
create true, human-created citators. As the old adage goes, though, you get
what you pay for.
The three full-service, high-price legal information providers each include
a citator on their respective platforms. LexisNexis acquired Shepard’s
Citations in 1996, promptly converted it to an electronic format (as well as
continuing to publish the print), and includes it on Lexis Advance.136

135 An algorithm-generated citator will at least link a researcher to subsequent
citations of a source, even if the researcher would then need to read fully each
subsequent citation to feel confident about a determination of impact.
136 Because Shepards was the only print citator, and thus the only citator before
the Internet came along, the term “Shepardize” is a term you may still hear used
today to mean “to run through a citator”, no matter which citator or which any
legal research platform you’re using. It’s similar to the way “google” has come to
mean searching on a search engine, no matter what the search engine may be.

131

Westlaw developed KeyCite to compete with Shepard’s, and Bloomberg
likewise created BCite upon entering the legal information business in
2009. The three services function similarly in that they all give researchers
a quick visual clue as to a legal authority’s continued validity, they all link a
researcher to all citing references of an authority, and they are all fully
integrated with the primary materials themselves.
When a researcher encounters a legal authority on Westlaw, Lexis
Advance, or Bloomberg Law, she may see a brightly-colored symbol next
to the title of the authority.137 These are the subsequent treatment symbols
provided by each platform’s citator that alert the researcher that an
authority has received subsequent treatment. The color scheme further
alerts the researcher as to how the original authority has been impacted by
the subsequent treatment. Generally, citator symbols follow a traffic-light
scheme wherein red means to stop because of severe negative treatment,
such as an overruling, while yellow indicates caution for some subsequent
criticism, and green gives the all clear for only positive subsequent
treatment.138 Thus, a researcher can tell at a glance whether a source is
likely still good law. Note, however, that a good legal researcher will
actually read the negative subsequent treatment, as even cases overruled
on one issue (thereby receiving a red subsequent treatment symbol) may
still be good law on a separate issue.
One other drawback of using humans to identify subsequent treatment is
that different humans can look at the same language and come to different
conclusions. So a case that has been labeled red on one platform,
indicating severe negative treatment by subsequent cases, may be merely
labeled yellow on another platform to indicate cautionary treatment. This
is another reason why it is important to read the negative subsequent
treatment so the researcher can make their own determinations as to the
meaning of the relevant language. However, such overt disagreement

On Westlaw, the symbols for the most part take the form of flags. On Lexis
Advance, the symbols are different shapes, and Bloomberg Law uses colored
squares with different shapes inside them.
137

BCite offers more nuanced categories than the other two services, and thus
splits what would be red on West or LexisNexis into Red and Orange levels for
different types of negative treatment. Similarly, while West and LexisNexis
consider distinguishing to warrant a cautionary yellow, Bloomberg uses blue for
distinguishing treatment and reserves yellow for more direct criticism. The basic
pattern remains the same, however.
138

132

among citators is not common, and the symbols are still very useful
guidance on where the researcher should target her attention first.
In addition to identifying subsequent treatment, integrated citators also
allow a researcher quick access to the subsequent authorities that cite an
original authority. This is because in addition to making a determination of
validity from the aggregate of gathered subsequent citations, the citator
will also generate a list of links, usually referred to by researchers as “citing
references,” that a researcher can follow to the gathered subsequent
authorities. Upon opening a legal authority on Westlaw, a researcher can
select the “citing references” tab to see a list of all subsequent citations.
Similarly, a researcher using Bloomberg Law can select the “citing
documents” tab for the same results. On Lexis Advance, after one opens a
document, she can click on the “Shepardize this document” link to the
right of the opinion text to see all subsequent citations of the document.139
Even better, each of the respective legal information providers have
installed facets in their lists of subsequent citations, meaning that
researchers can filter the results.
In addition to the normal filters such as court, jurisdiction, and date, the
citators include filters for type (positive, negative, distinguished, etc.) and
depth of treatment. This allows researchers to focus quickly and efficiently
on the subsequent authorities that are likely to have impacted the original
authority the most. Researchers then can make their own determinations
about whether the original authority remains valid.

LexisNexis paid for the Shepard’s brand name, and by golly they’re going to
use it!

Citators also allow researchers to create their own filters by searching within
results. Thus, in addition to updating the law, electronic citators can also act
as a powerful research tool. For instance, if I wanted to find Kentucky cases
on the doctrine of judicial review, and I know that Marbury v. Madison serves
as the foundational case for judicial review in America, I can pull up
Marbury v. Madison, Shepardize it, apply filters for Kentucky and search for
the term “judicial review,” and quickly retrieve the relevant cases for my
problem, as seen in Figure 5.6b.

In addition to the filters that allow us to sort through the citator results,
citators also supply the researcher with brief snippets of information about
each subsequent citation on the citator results list. In Figure 5.6a we saw
how the citators indicated the depth of discussion that the subsequent
authorities contained regarding the original authority. Citators also provide
a snapshot of how the subsequent authority itself has been cited. In Lexis
Advance, the colored squares underneath the title of each subsequent
citation indicate the relationship between the subsequent authority and the
original authority. However, the colored symbols that appear directly after
the title of the subsequent authority indicate how that authority itself has
been treated by later authorities. On Westlaw, the relationship between the
original authority and the subsequent authority is indicated in the
“Treatment” column of the citator results. But the flags that appear next to
each subsequent citation describe how that opinion was subsequently
treated. The placement of symbols on Bloomberg Law’s BCite is
substantially similar to that of Westlaw. See Figure 5.6c for further
explanation.

Electronic citators have a few additional features beyond updating and
expanding primary authority research. The “History” feature (called
“History” on Westlaw, “Appellate History” on Lexis Advance and “Direct
History” on Bloomberg Law) lists opinions contained in the database that
are related to the same case. If I wanted to see what happened after the
United States Supreme Court remanded the case of Bowers v. Hardwick back
to the 11th Circuit, I could go to the “History” tab on Westlaw and find a
list of prior and subsequent opinions tracing the case’s way through the
court system. See Figure 5.6d. This list will be limited to opinions that the
database actually has in its system; in this case the opinion from the trial
court is not available in Westlaw and is thus not listed, though the
researcher can determine from reading the appellate court opinions that the
case started in Northern District of Georgia. In addition to the list of
related opinions, for some cases Westlaw and Lexis Advance will even
provide a chart so the researcher can better visualize the relationship
between opinions.

136

Figure 5.6d: Researching a case’s history. Click here for
screencast: http://youtu.be/MZG5H_rp5SE.

In addition to providing citation lists of citing court opinions, citators also
supply the researcher with secondary sources that cite back to the original
authority. Looking at the secondary sources that cite to a primary authority
can be a valuable way to find further analysis of the authority and related
legal topics.140 However, the secondary sources listed in each of the three
citators will vary dramatically. While all three high-price legal research
platforms carry a substantially similar set of primary authorities, their
secondary sources will be more diverse. Budget model legal search
platforms usually do not carry much in the way of secondary authority.
Electronic citators can be used to find lists of primary and secondary
authorities that cite back to statutes or regulations in much the same
manner as a researcher would use them for opinions. While the same
symbols used to indicate subsequent treatment for opinions are also used
for statutes and regulations, they can convey slightly different information
in this context. A yellow symbol for a statute or regulation may simply
mean that a legislature or agency has proposed an amendment that has not
yet been adopted. If the researcher practices in this area, such information
has value for future reference, or to advise a client on future action, but it
does not affect immediate application of the statute or regulation. A red
symbol may mean that a statute or regulation has been declared
unconstitutional or has been repealed. As with opinions, the researcher

140

Secondary sources will be discussed in more detail in Chapter 6.

137

should use the symbols as a guide for further investigating the currency of
the statute or regulation.
The extensive features of electronic citators give the legal researcher a
significant advantage in researching efficiently, as well as a vastly superior
way of updating the law. In these regards, they are representative of the
efficiency of using computers for legal research in general. While research
platforms offer significant advantages to legal researchers in terms of time
and efficiency, to achieve the maximum benefit from their capacity, a legal
researcher in the twenty-first century needs to be able to communicate
effectively with algorithms and let them know what exactly the researcher
wants to find. Legal researchers should use all means at their disposal to
guide computers to what they want. Specifically, expert researchers engage
in the techniques of searching, browsing, and filtering, and often combine
the same. Furthermore, expert legal researchers know how to use electronic
citators to their full potential. Aspiring legal researchers should practice
using these same techniques and tools. Thus, law students are encouraged
to try the exercises on the following pages.

5.7.2 Intermediate Exercise on Electronic Research
Against your better judgment, shortly after graduating and passing the
Kentucky bar, a heretofore slacker friend of yours, Joe Stoner, convinces
you to sign on as General Counsel for his newly formed video game
development company, Bluegrass Star Games. Honestly, you just agreed
to be G.C. to stop Joe from pestering you while you looked for a more
legitimate job. You never expected him actually to produce a single game.
Contrary to your expectations, however, Joe has found his true calling in
life and is nearing launch of the company’s new centerpiece, Mary Jane’s
Marauding Moppets, in which puppet-like, anthropomorphic versions of
common woodland animals engage in the illicit marijuana trade. (Some of
the challenges of the game include: a mini-game on DEA Dodging, a
social-networking style mini-game on Crop Watering/Farm simulation,
and a supply and demand business distribution simulator. Joe swears the
game will “like, destroy preconceived notions of genre, man.”) Bluegrass
Star Games is also offering a limited edition of the game that ships with a
hollow, ceramic figurine of one of the woodland animal characters. The
figurines look suspiciously like bongs. You decide that as General Counsel,
you had better do some research.

1. Find a United States Supreme Court case from 2011 that struck
down a California law regulating the sale of violent video games
on First Amendment grounds.
a.

Has it received any negative treatment? Describe that
treatment in general terms.

b. Has any Kentucky state court decision cited this case?
2. Find the U.S.C. provision prohibiting the sale of drug
paraphernalia.
a.

Do you see anything that might affect the validity of this
statute?

b. Have there been any federal cases in the 8th Circuit Court
of Appeals that discuss this statute?

5.7.3 Advanced Exercise on Electronic Research
Our firm represents Fionn and Siobhán Ó Brádaigh, primary shareholders
of Emerald Herbs, an herbal health supplement shop in southeast
Lexington, KY. Emerald Herbs also features an online retail site and
operates its own herb-growing facilities. Emerald Herbs is organized as a
closely held corporation and employs a total of 56 individuals full-time. The
herbal supplement business is surprisingly lucrative, and the Ó Brádaighs
are very good clients of ours. Unfortunately, they are currently locked in
two separate legal disputes.
Dispute 1 - State Law & Free Exercise of Religion
It seems that in addition to working for Emerald Herbs, the majority of
employees also belong to the Jessamine Grove of the Reformed Druids of
North America (RDNA), a neo-pagan religious organization. Siobhán Ó
Brádaigh, in fact, serves as the Arch-Druid of the Jessamine Grove.
Amongst the tenets of the Jessamine Grove is that its members are “to cut
no living tree.” This tenet conflicts with a Lexington ordinance requiring
trees to be trimmed to 7’ clearance above sidewalks. Several trees in
Emerald Herbs’ parking lot feature branches that extend to only 5’ above
the neighboring sidewalk. Lexington’s authority to create ordinances stems
from the Kentucky legislature through KRS ch. 67A on consolidated urbancounty governments.
1. A federal law was enacted in 1993, the Religious Freedom Restoration
Act (RFRA), that was intended to prevent government from passing laws
substantially burdening an individual’s free exercise of religion. Please find
the federal statutes comprising the RFRA. Does it apply to state laws?
2. Is the statute you used to answer Q1 still good law? Why or why not?
3. What are our clients’ chances of successfully using the RFRA to escape
enforcement of Lexington’s tree ordinance?

Dispute 2 - Federal Law & Free Exercise of Religion
Additionally, because of the number of employees, Emerald Herbs is
subject to the employer mandate of the federal Affordable Care Act.
However, the Ó Brádaighs, as well as the other members of the Jessamine
Grove, object on religious grounds to every available prescription coverage
plan because they all include products from drug companies with extremely
poor environmental records.

141

4. We are investigating whether to file an injunction in the Eastern District
of Kentucky to relieve Emerald Herbs of its duty to provide the Affordable
Care Act healthcare plans due to the burden it places on the Ó Brádaighs’
freedom of religion. Please find the section of the RFRA that explicitly
states that the free exercise of religion is protected. Are there any binding
federal cases citing to that section in which a party is objecting to provisions
of the Affordable Care Act on religious grounds?
5. What are our clients’ chances of successfully using the RFRA to avoid
paying a penalty under the Affordable Care Act for not providing insurance
plans to employees?

•

Describe various types of secondary sources.

•

Assess when to use a general secondary source vs. an in-depth,
topical secondary source.

•

Find an appropriate secondary source for any discrete legal issue.

•

Use secondary sources in print or online to research a specific
legal issue.

6.2 Overview of Legal Secondary Sources
This text has so far discussed primary legal authorities and the methods for
locating them. Now we turn our attention to secondary authorities, also
called secondary sources, which are the sources researchers often use to
begin their research. Legal secondary sources are texts that provide
commentary and analysis of the law for the benefit of the reader. Secondary
sources come in a variety of forms; they can be general or detailed, cover a
specific jurisdiction, and they are written for a wide range of audiences.
Different secondary sources may be employed at different stages of the
research process; the choice of secondary source may also rest on the
researcher’s prior knowledge of the topic. This chapter will describe the
most common types of secondary sources the researcher is likely to
encounter, when they should (and should not) be used, and a variety of
methods for locating them.

6.2.1 Common Types of Secondary Sources
Law students and aspiring legal researches will likely encounter a broad
range of secondary sources. In the following sections, we briefly describe
some of the common types of secondary sources used by legal researchers.
Figure 6.2.1 provides a quick-glance summary of the strengths and
weaknesses of each type of secondary source described.

146

Secondary Source

Advantages & Disadvantages

Legal encyclopedias

More breadth and less depth; a very general
introduction to many legal topics. Low
citability.

Practice Series &
Materials

Breadth and depth vary by source, as does the
amount of commentary. Citability thus varies;
typically low. Useful in jurisdiction-specific
research.

American Law
Reports (ALRs)

More breadth and less depth; annotations
contain summary but not analysis. Useful to
start research on narrow topics and for
jurisdictional comparisons. Low citability.

Restatements

Highly credible and thus highly citable. Indepth coverage on areas of traditional common
law.

Model Codes &
Uniform Acts

Focus on areas governed by statutory law and
provide extensive annotations to relevant
caselaw.

Treatises

Treats a subject in depth but breadth varies.
Citability sometimes high but varies depending
on the reputation of the treatise.

Form books

Useful for identifying the pieces necessary to a
type of legal document.

Law Review &
Journal Articles.

In-depth treatment on a narrow area of law; not
updated once published. Quality and thus
citability varies.

Figure 6.2.1: An Overview of Secondary Source Types

6.2.1.1 Legal Encyclopedias
Legal encyclopedias are the most general of secondary sources. They have
more breadth than depth and so can provide an introduction to a wide
range of legal topics. If the researcher is unfamiliar with an area of law and
needs a list of the major primary authorities in the area as a starting point
for further research on the issue, legal encyclopedias are a solid place for
him to begin his research. They are, as one would expect from the term

147

“encyclopedia,” organized alphabetically by topic. American Jurisprudence 2d
(Am. Jur. 2d) and the Corpus Juris Secundum (C.J.S.) are two of the most
widely known legal encyclopedias. Some states have jurisdiction-specific
legal encyclopedias, such as Ohio Jurisprudence 3d.
6.2.1.2 Practice Series & Practice Materials
Practice series resemble legal encyclopedias in that they cover a variety of
legal topics, though perhaps not as many as a legal encyclopedia, and they
tend to be jurisdiction-specific. They are usually written by practitioners or
scholars specializing in that jurisdiction and may contain descriptions of
the current state of the law, some analysis of the law, and possibly forms
relating to a particular topic. They tend to be organized by topic and can
be one volume or many.
Other practice materials may be form books, discussed further in section
6.2.1.7, or process-oriented guides as to how litigation on a topic normally
proceeds. Materials in the latter category may explain how litigation on a
topic proceeds and the court filings and documentation typically seen in
such cases.
Practice series and other practice-oriented materials can sometimes
resemble treatises in their depth of coverage on specific topics. In fact,
whether an item should be deemed a “treatise” or a “practice material” can
be a gray area, and these sources are often found using similar methods that
will be discussed later in this chapter.
6.2.1.3 American Law Reports (ALRs)
The American Law Reports is a set of hundreds of volumes which are filled
with articles called “annotations.” ALRs provide an odd combination of
breadth and depth; the number of topics covered is vast but those topics
are much more specific than those in an encyclopedia. The annotations
summarize caselaw on those narrow topics across jurisdictions; the
function is more of a report on the current state of the law rather than an
analysis of the law as one would find in a topical treatise. Each annotation
contains a table of the relevant primary authorities described in the
annotation organized by jurisdiction which can be a quick reference for
finding primary authorities on that topic across jurisdictions. There are six
series of the ALRs covering state law, the most recent being the ALR 6th.
The ALR Federal covers federal topics and is on its second series.

148

6.2.1.4 Restatements & Principles of Law
Restatements are publications by the American Law Institute (ALI) that
clarify and organize the existing state of caselaw on a given topic, or, in
other words, restate the law. The restatements contain analysis on an area
of law, summarize and refer to caselaw across jurisdictions, and may offer
suggestions on how the legal system could clarify an area of law going
forward.
Because the ALI is composed of a large number of legal scholars and
practitioners who are the experts in their fields, the restatements are
generally considered to be among the most persuasive of the secondary
sources of law. In fact, they are often cited by judicial opinions,
particularly when there is no binding authority on point.
Many of the restatements are on their third series and are published by
topic. Some of the more well-known restatements are those covering the
laws of agency, contracts, property, torts, trusts, and unfair competition. A
complete list of topics may be found on the ALI website.
The ALI also publishes recommendations on areas of the law that need to
be updated; these publications are called “Principles” and cover a wide
variety of legal topics. These can be useful to a practitioner looking for
guidance on how to present to the court on an area of unsettled or outdated
law.
6.2.1.5 Model Codes & Uniform Acts
The ALI and the Uniform Law Commission both publish model codes and
uniform acts to advocate standards or to improve organization in certain
areas of the law. Just as the name implies, these publications are written in
the form of model statutes that jurisdictions can adopt in part or whole into
their own statutory codes. Examples that are familiar to first year law
students are the Uniform Commercial Code and the Model Penal Code; a full
listing can be seen on the Uniform Law Commission website and the ALI
website. These publications contain annotations detailing how these model
statutes have been adopted and implemented in various jurisdictions and
thus can be a rich source of primary authority for a researcher.
6.2.1.6 Treatises
Treatises are comprehensive texts on a narrow legal subject. They
generally provide much more discussion and analysis of the legal topic
than a legal encyclopedia or ALR annotation while also leading the
researcher to primary authorities through references and citations. They

149

may or may not be jurisdiction-specific and can vary in length from one to
dozens of volumes.
Treatises are often named after their authors, e.g., Nimmer on Copyright,
Farnsworth on Contracts. Some treatises are highly reputable in a given field,
but the quality can run the gamut. Consulting a subject-specific research
guide or a research expert may be the quickest method to locate the most
credible title for a specific legal topic.
6.2.1.7 Form Books
While each legal problem is distinct and each client unique, often the
output of legal practice takes standardized forms. For instance, partnership
agreements, while differing in the details, are generally structured in the
same way. On the litigation side, while motions will employ unique
arguments depending on the circumstances, the motions themselves will
follow a standard format. Thus, one of the more useful types of secondary
source in practice are form books, which publish blank templates or forms
that lawyers can use in crafting their own legal documents. Usually, some
explanatory text, similar to what you would see in a treatise, accompanies
the templates.
Form books may be either jurisdiction specific or neutral; they may also be
topical specific or cover a wide variety of subjects. West’s Legal Forms is an
example of a general, jurisdiction-neutral form set. Published sets of pattern
jury instructions, on the other hand, are topically specific and are often
published for specific jurisdictions.
6.2.1.8 Law Reviews & Journals
Law reviews and journals contain scholarly articles primarily written by law
professors on various specialized areas of law. Journals are published
periodically and may contain articles on a particular subject area (e.g. Harvard
Journal on Racial and Ethnic Justice) or articles in a wide variety of subjects (e.g.
Harvard Law Review). Individual articles, however, usually address a very
narrow area of the law. Furthermore, they tend to focus on underdeveloped
or rarely-visited areas of the law and thus often contain information not
found elsewhere. For this reason, they can be a rich resource for identifying
not only relevant primary authority on that narrow topic but also secondary
authorities on point. For the same reason, they are occasionally cited as
persuasive authority by judicial opinions.

150

6.2.2 Uses of Secondary Sources
As indicated above, different secondary sources are employed for different
research scenarios. Typically the researcher will use a secondary source to
educate himself on an unfamiliar area of law, unfamiliar jurisdiction, or as
a method to quickly identify relevant primary authorities on a given topic.
Sections 6.2.2.1 and 6.2.2.2 address these uses in more detail.
While secondary sources are extremely useful tools for the research
process, the researcher will not ordinarily cite to them in formal
memorandums or court documents. He should never rely on a secondary
source’s analysis of a primary authority; he must always review the primary
authorities and conduct his own analysis relative to the specific facts of the
legal issue that he is researching. Additionally, some areas of the law
change rapidly and secondary sources vary widely in their currentness; a
researcher will always need to perform additional research to make sure he
is working with the most recent primary authorities on the issue. There
are, however, exceptions to every rule, and section 6.2.2.3 describes
scenarios in which citing to secondary authorities may be appropriate.
6.2.2.1 For an Overview
A researcher may need to consult a secondary resource for an overview of
an unfamiliar area of law, of an unfamiliar jurisdiction, or of an
overdeveloped area of law.
When researching an unfamiliar area of law or jurisdiction, a secondary
source will give the researcher a quick overview of the state of the law in a
specific legal area or in a specific jurisdiction. For an unfamiliar area of law,
a general resource such as a legal encyclopedia may be the best place to
start; once the researcher has a basic introduction, he may move on to a
treatise or practice guide. A jurisdiction-specific legal encyclopedia would be
beneficial for the researcher working with the law in a state in which he
does not typically practice. A jurisdiction-specific practice series may be
beneficial both for gaining an understanding of the topic in the researcher’s
home jurisdiction, or he may want to identify a practice series in a new
jurisdiction to see how it differs from his.
When researching in an overdeveloped area of the law, the researcher may
find that he is overwhelmed by the number of primary authorities available
on a particular topic. Separating the most relevant authorities from the
multitude can be a time-consuming process, but a topic-specific secondary
source may give the researcher a head start. A treatise on the topic will

151

highlight the most important primary authorities in a given area, saving the
researcher the time of identifying them himself.
In any of the above scenarios, the secondary source will also yield another
important resource: relevant terminology to the topic. A different
jurisdiction may use legal phrases to which the researcher is unaccustomed;
an unfamiliar or overdeveloped area of law may have sub-topics or
concepts previously unknown to him. The secondary materials will help the
researcher grasp the appropriate terminology and concepts. Armed with the
appropriate vocabulary, he can then pursue primary authorities using the
methods described in earlier chapters.
6.2.2.2 As a Pathfinder
One of the most useful features of secondary sources is that they direct
researchers to primary authorities, and sometimes other secondary
authorities, on the topic. An ALR article may summarize cases on a narrow
topic across jurisdictions; a treatise will not only summarize the cases but
provide detailed analysis of opinions on a particular legal issue; a
jurisdiction-specific practice series will highlight the critical cases on the
topic in that state. For underdeveloped areas of law, a scholarly article on
point can direct the researcher to a wealth of excellent materials. That
scholar has likely performed months, if not years, of research, identified the
most relevant primary authorities, and consulted the most authoritative
secondary sources on the topic.
6.2.2.3 To Cite as Persuasive Authority
There are scenarios in which it is appropriate to cite to persuasive authority
in your legal writing. Typically this occurs in areas of law that are either
underdeveloped or overdeveloped.
When an area of law is overdeveloped, the amount of relevant primary
authority to be found can be staggering. It may be difficult to narrow down
the appropriate cases to cite to support a particular legal proposition. In
such a scenario, it may be prudent to cite a Restatement instead of
hundreds of cases that have developed a particular proposition. If that
Restatement is cited in precedent from your jurisdiction, it is an indication
that it may be appropriate to use it for the same purpose. Some treatises are
held in similarly high regard and used in a similar manner.
Citing to secondary authority may also be appropriate in the opposite
scenario: when an area of law is new or underdeveloped in a particular
jurisdiction. Persuasive authorities, including secondary sources, are used

152

more often when primary authorities on point are scarce. If your legal
problem is a case of first impression in a jurisdiction, i.e. there are no
precedents, a suggestion from a law review article or a restatement on how
to resolve the issue may be suitable.

6.3 Researching Secondary Sources
Now let us turn to how legal researchers find and utilize secondary
sources.

6.3.1 Finding an Appropriate Secondary Source
Because secondary sources vary widely in type and format, and often have
similar or nondescript titles, finding an appropriate source for the legal issue
at hand can be challenging. Ideally the researcher will want to start with a
resource that identifies secondary sources by topic, type, or both.
6.3.1.1 Browsing by Topic or Jurisdiction On a Full-Service
Legal Information Platform
Some online legal research platforms, such as Bloomberg Law, Westlaw, or
Lexis Advance, allow the researcher to browse their secondary resources by
topic and perhaps the types of secondary sources on that topic. Such
categorization may be broad or narrow. For example, one platform may
have a single category for Intellectual Property, while another may further
sub-divide that subject area into Copyright, Unfair Competition,
Trademarks, and Patents. Figure 6.3.1.1a shows how Westlaw uses the
broad category of Intellectual Property and then provides a listing of
secondary sources by type: ALRs, Texts & Treatises, Law Reviews &
Journal, Forms, and more.

153

Figure 6.3.1.1a: Types of Intellectural Property Secondary
Sources on Westlaw.

Some platforms will also allow the researcher to browse the secondary
sources available that relate to a specific jurisdiction. On Lexis Advance, the
Browse Sources screen provides filters to narrow the list of titles by

154

category or type of resource, jurisdiction, and practice areas and topics.
These filters are indicated by arrows in Figure 6.3.1.1b.

Figure 6.3.1.1b: Filters for Narrowing Sources in Lexis
Advance. Reprinted from LexisNexis with permission.
Copyright 2015 LexisNexis. All rights reserved.

Once the researcher has browsed and narrowed down the platform’s
secondary sources to those on a particular topic, he can either use the
finding aids to work with a specific source or use the search techniques
described in Chapter 5 to search across the topical sources.
The secondary sources available on the three major legal research
platforms vary widely as they each produce, or own publishers that
produce, different titles. Some major titles (e.g. ALRs, Restatements) are
available on multiple platforms due to licensing arrangements, but specific

155

treatises and practice materials typically are not. If a researcher has access
to more than platform, he may need to check more than one to find
appropriate secondary sources on point.
6.3.1.2 Online Catalogs
Online catalogs are another starting point for finding both print and
electronic resources on point. For law students, the law school library will
have an online catalog containing records of its print and electronic
resources. Most importantly, each record will have one or more Library of
Congress subject headings associated with it. The researcher can search
the subject headings directly in a fielded search, or he can search the
catalog by keyword and then browse the subject headings found on
records that appear to be relevant. Records for print resources will provide
him with call numbers for locating the item in the library’s physical
collection; records for electronic resources will contain links directly to the
resource online.
These catalogs can be useful for practitioners as well. A law firm may have
its own catalog the researcher can use as a starting place to identify
resources held by your firm. If an organization does not have its own
catalog, researchers can use collaborative catalogs such as Worldcat to
identify resources. Because libraries from all over the world contribute their
records to Worldcat, it can be an excellent starting point to identify the
world of resources available on a given topic. A researcher may then check
to see if his organization has access to those resources or use Worldcat to
identify the libraries nearby that may provide access to those resources.

156

6.3.1.3 Online Research Guides
Another excellent starting point for finding topical secondary resources are
research guides created by law librarians. Most university law libraries
feature designated webpages to guide researchers to the items in the
library’s collection relating to particular legal subjects. These guides may
identify the most highly-regarded secondary sources on topic, give
instructions for how to use particular resources, and discuss methods for
further research for primary and secondary authorities on point.
There are a few ways to find these online research guides. One strategy
would be to look at the law library websites for the law schools in the
jurisdiction in which you are researching. Those websites will list their
research guides and may well provide jurisdiction-specific information.
Another strategy would be to utilize Google or another web search engine
to search research guides across institutions. By using the site:.edu search
operator on Google, you may restrict your search query to look only at
educational websites. If you include the legal topic you are researching and
the term “legal research,” the search results will primarily be from research
guides developed by law school librarians. For instance the following search
will return librarian-produced research guides that will lead researchers to
products liability treatises:
site:edu AND “products liability” AND “legal research”
Of course, if you have access to one, even better than consulting a librarianproduced research guide would be consulting an actual librarian.
6.3.1.4 Asking a Reference Librarian or an Information
Professional
In the current era, so much information is available in just a few clicks
online we sometimes forget that asking a knowledgeable individual for
assistance remains an option. However, as many of the strategies discussed
in this book indicate, the amount of information that is a few clicks away
can be the problem. Asking a reference librarian or another individual,
such as a practicing attorney, knowledgeable about the area in which the
researcher is investigating is sometimes the quickest way to find relevant
materials on point. Reference librarians are the people most familiar with
their collections, whether that be a law school library or the library of a
private organization. They are experts in utilizing many of the systems
described in this text and those specific to their own institutions. Their

157

jobs are not only to be familiar with those systems and resources but also
to help others navigate them. If the researcher is unsure of where to begin
his research or has reached a roadblock after pursuing a variety of leads, a
reference librarian, an attorney specializing in that area of law, or other
legal information specialist may be able to guide him to resources to
propel him forward.

6.3.2 Using Secondary Sources in Print
Like codes, secondary sources tend to possess an inherent topical
organization. Thus, expert researchers often find the use of print secondary
sources to be more efficient than electronic versions. We will briefly discuss
the chief methods of use of secondary sources in print.
6.3.2.1 Organization & Finding Aids
Some print secondary sources are organized chronologically, but most are
organized by topic. A legal encyclopedia is organized alphabetically by
general topic; a subject treatise is organized in a logical progression of subtopics; a practice series may be organized by general subject area and then
specific subtopics. Skimming the table of contents can be a quick way of
identifying the major topics covered by the source. A secondary source set
consisting of a large number of volumes may have different levels of tables
of contents much as a statutory code does: a table of contents for the
entire set, a table of contents for a chapter, or even more granular levels.
Article-based secondary sources such as ALRs or legal encyclopedias will
usually have a table of contents at the beginning of an article.
Even with multiple levels of tables of contents, the index is often the
researcher’s best starting point. Indexes alphabetize in detailed lists the
topics and sub-topics covered by the source; they are far more detailed
than even the most specific table of contents. Most secondary sources will
have an index published at the end of the volume or in the last volume of
the set if the source consists of multiple volumes.
Secondary sources may also include tables listing primary authorities along
with references to where the authorities are discussed in the text. This can
be useful if the researcher has a citation to a particular source of law on
which he is interested in finding further analysis. Such tables are usually
also located at the end of a volume or set and may be called a Table of
Cases or Table of Authorities.
For the secondary sources organized chronologically, the utilization of the
relevant finding aids is critical. For example, the annotations in ALRs are

158

published in chronological order. There may be more than one article on
divorce and child custody, but they will not be found in close physical
proximity the way they would be in a practice series. The only way to
identify annotations that discuss a particular topic is to use the available
index. Law reviews and journal are also published chronologically; relevant
finding aids are discussed in section 6.3.4.
6.3.2.2 Updating in Print
Topical secondary sources in print may be published either in bound
volumes or in loose-leaf fashion. As discussed with digests and statutory
codes earlier, hardbound volumes are expensive to produce and so
hardbound secondary sources are updated in a similar manner to their
primary authority counterparts. Pocket parts are used to update individual
volumes and will be found in a pocket at the back of a volume;
supplements may be stand-alone soft-bound publications relating to an
individual volume for a particular set or may be an update to the set as a
whole.
Loose-leafs are an alternative publication format that makes integrating
updates into the text somewhat easier. “Loose-leafs” is the term used to
refer to treatises or practice materials that are published in a binder rather
than a bound volume. To update loose-leafs, the publisher of a title sends
pages to replace those that have become dated. The old pages are removed
and the new pages inserted; the table of contents, index, and other finding
aids of the volume may be updated as well to reflect the new content. This
method of updating eliminates a step for the researcher; there is no need
to consult additional parts in the set to update the material, as required
with hardbound sets. The disadvantage to this updating method is that it
can be hard to track down what that secondary source said at a given
moment in time, as a researcher might need to do when tracking down
secondary sources cited in older documents.
Every print title has a slightly different updating schedule and process,
whether in hardbound or looseleaf format. If a researcher needs assistance
in updating a resource, he should contact a reference librarian for
assistance.

6.3.3 Using Electronic Secondary Sources
Using electronic secondary sources gives researchers an additional finding
aid: keyword searching. Many of the legal research platforms allow you to
perform a keyword search across the content of the entire platform. As a
practical matter, this is often not the best approach to finding relevant

159

secondary sources. A general keyword search is likely to bring back
thousands of results from a wide variety of sources. Sorting through the
results of such a general search to determine what type of source the
material came from and if it is on point or merely mentioning the topic of
interest in passing can be time-consuming. Narrowing the search first by
browsing as described in section 6.3.1.1 to find materials on point and
then searching across materials on the topic or searching within a specific
title is usually more efficient. Alternatively, the researcher may be able to
perform a keyword search and then use post-search filters to narrow the
results list before perusing them. Researchers can utilize many of the same
search strategies described in Chapter 5 for researching primary
authorities.
While keyword searching is an additional finding aid for accessing
secondary sources, it is not necessarily a superior option to the traditional
finding aids. Often the researcher is using a secondary source to become
familiar with an area of law and to begin building a vocabulary to be used
in primary source research. So, if the researcher does not yet know the
appropriate vocabulary to the topic, keyword searching may not get him
very far.
Though the temptation to search is there, do not overlook a source’s
inherent organizational structure. Browsing the table of contents can be as
effective in the electronic universe as it is in print, particularly if the
researcher is unfamiliar with the relevant terminology used for the topic.
In addition to the table of contents, the legal research platform or publisher
may reproduce other finding aids that are useful in print. Check to see if an
electronic version of the index has been included; again, the index is
extremely useful when one is unfamiliar with the terminology that would
allow you to search. Sometimes such an index may be just a reproduction of
the print, requiring you to search the document via the Find feature in your
browser (control+F or command+F). For some sources, the index may be
searchable on the platform.

6.3.4 Law Review & Journal Articles
Scholarly legal journals publish articles on many topics but lack any
internal topical organization. Luckily, researchers may use several
electronic tools to find articles on topics of interest.
6.3.4.1 Indexes
Finding relevant law review and journal articles is a somewhat different task
than finding other secondary sources described in this chapter. Thousands
of law reviews are published every year across hundreds of individual
publications. Checking each title for articles on a topic is impractical.
Fortunately, there are publications that index those thousands upon
thousands of articles by topic. There are two such general indexes in print:
Index to Legal Periodicals and Books and the Current Law Index. Like Shepard’s
Citator, however, these publications are often no longer carried by libraries,
as their online incarnations are superior tools. The electronic versions are
the commercial databases Index to Legal Periodicals & Books (ILP), now
available through EBSCO, and LegalTrac, available through Gale Cengage,
respectively. Most university law libraries subscribe to one or both. These
indexes cover roughly 1980 to the present; to research older articles you
need to use a separate index, the Index to Legal Periodicals Retrospective. There
are also indexes that cover specific legal practice areas, such as the Index to
Foreign Legal Periodicals (on HeinOnline).

161

These electronic indexes allow the researcher to search their records by
keyword, author, or subject. Depending on the subscription, these indexes
may provide full-text of some or none of the articles. If the latter, a search
may provide the researcher only with an abstract and a citation; he will need
to find the full-text article by using another resource such as those
described in the next section.
6.3.4.2 Full-text Commercial Platforms
Apart from indexes, there are several legal information platforms that allow
researchers to perform full-text searches across all the journal articles
available on the platform. HeinOnline is the platform with the most
comprehensive coverage of law school reviews and journals, though it
sometimes will not contain the most recent issues. Westlaw and Lexis
Advance also have selections of journals on their platforms and are more
likely to contain the most recent issues. Again, the researcher can utilize
many of the search techniques described in Chapter 5 when searching on
these platforms.

6.3.4.3 Free Resources
There are also free resources available online for searching scholarly legal
publications. Many universities promote their faculty by participating in
open access repositories and are thus making their faculty scholarship

162

available for free online. There are several ways to find such materials; this
text will highlight three.
Many law professors post their published articles and works in progress on
SSRN, or the Social Science Research Network. SSRN makes these works
freely available to the public. The site can be searched and browsed down
to specific legal areas of research, but it can be slow and difficult to use.
Digital Commons is a platform used by many universities to host and
provide free public access to their faculty’s scholarship. BePress, the creator
of Digital Commons, has created a publicly available search engine called
the Digital Commons Network to search across all the universities that are
hosting their scholarship using Digital Commons. The Network even
provides a faceted search to drill down by topic, publication year, and more.
Finally, the Google product Google Scholar utilizes the company’s
powerful search algorithms to search only scholarly materials rather than all
content on the web. It searches the scholarly content made available for
free by universities as well as the records of some subscription databases
such as HeinOnline and LexisNexis. Google Scholar pulls in only citations
rather than full-text articles from those subscription databases. An
additional limitation of Google Scholar is that it will also pull in materials
from the Google Books database with no easy way of filtering those
materials out of the results.
With the wide variety of free and paid secondary sources available, a legal
researcher can become overwhelmed with the amount of information
accessible to him while still not quite finding the piece of information he
needs. Knowledge of the types of the secondary sources and where and
how to look for them will help the researcher be more efficient when
beginning his research. And he should never forget the most direct way to
find a resource on point: ask someone with knowledge of the legal topic or
legal resources.

163

6.4 Concluding Exercises for Chapter 6
Now try your hand at using secondary sources in print or online with the
following exercises:

6.4.1 Introductory Exercise on Secondary Sources
Our client, Mary Smith, was adopted by the Smith family as an infant in
California and would like to find her birth parents. You are a novice not
only to adoption but to family law generally and need to educate yourself
on this area of law. Please find the following:
1. A California practice guide or treatise on family law.
2. An AmJur 2d article that relates to whether an individual who was
adopted can view her adoption records now that he’s an adult.

164

6.4.2 Intermediate Exercise on Secondary Sources
Our client, Lexington Online Inc., has published the names and phone
numbers of all of Verizon’s Lexington subscribers in an online directory
that is freely available on the Internet. Verizon is suing our client for,
among other things, copyright infringement. Verizon says that they
(Verizon) were the original authors of that information and Lexington
Online’s directory is thus violating copyright. Our client says that they
(Lexington Online) have just published facts and those are
noncopyrightable.

6.4.3 Advanced Exercise on Secondary Sources
Our clients, Ina and Mal Washburn, are being sued for vicarious liability in
a traffic accident because they negligently entrusted the use of their car to
their 16 year-old-daughter, Kaylee. Kaylee rear-ended another driver while
driving down Highway 34 near the Washburns’ home in Pierre, South
Dakota, while talking on her iPhone. The plaintiff, Diane Riker, is suing
under the theory that the Washburns knew their daughter to be a reckless
driver, as she has been ticketed for traffic incidents in the past and
consistently talks on the phone while driving. The Washburns insist that
none of Kaylee’s prior traffic incidents involved her smartphone.
Your supervising attorney is unaware of any South Dakota caselaw on
point and would like you to find authorities on point from other
jurisdictions.
1. Find a relevant ALR annotation regarding liability, smartphones,
and car accidents.
2. Does this annotation list any primary authorities from South
Dakota?
3. What section(s) of the annotation seems most applicable to our
situation? What primary authorities does that section(s) refer to?
4. Does this article refer you to any additional secondary sources
that might be worth pursuing? If so, which ones would you start
with and why?

The Research Process
A lawyer shall provide competent representation to a
client. Competent representation requires the legal
knowledge, skill, thoroughness and preparation
reasonably necessary for the representation. – The
American Bar Association, MODEL RULES OF
PROFESSIONAL CONDUCT R. 1.1
In order to conduct legal research effectively, a
lawyer should have a working knowledge of . . .the
process of devising and implementing a coherent
and effective research design. – MacCrate Report

7.1 Learning Objectives
In working through this chapter, students should strive to be able to:
•

Describe the steps of the research process.

•

Assess which research techniques are best utilized at each step of
the process.

•

Understand the recursive nature of the research process.

•

Describe techniques a researcher can employ when faced with too
much or too little information.

170

7.2 Essential Steps of the Research Process
So far in this text we have discussed primary and secondary sources of
American law and techniques for locating them in print and online
environments. Now we will turn our attention to how to integrate those
discrete techniques into a strategic process. The steps for researching most
legal problems will follow a logical progression:
1. Familiarize yourself with the specifics of the legal problem.
2. Define the scope of the research.
3. Construct search queries.
4. Gather primary authorities.
5. Analyze and update primary authorities.
Let us look at each step in turn and explore the most efficient techniques,
or combination thereof, that the researcher can use at each step of the
process. At the end of the chapter, we will address some common
concerns that researchers have once they have begun the research process.

7.2.1 Familiarize Yourself with the Legal Problem
Legal research does not exist in a vacuum. Lawyers engage in research to
answer a question of law about a specific problem. The researcher must
know intimately the facts of that underlying problem, as this is essential to
being able to judge what legal authorities will apply to it.
The researcher may begin to ask some questions of the legal problem at
this stage of the research. Who are the people or entities involved in the
problem? What is their relationship? Are there any obviously missing
pieces of information from the scenario forming the basis of the problem?
The researcher will likely return to the facts of the client’s legal problem
repeatedly over the course of the research process in an effort to
determine which facts are critical to answer the problem, but at this initial
stage the researcher must do his best to internalize the basic story structure
to facilitate revisiting those facts at a later stage.
The organized researcher should also ask some additional questions to
frame the process of the research at this stage. Whether the legal problem
comes directly from a client, a supervising attorney, or a professor, the
researcher should clearly understand what work product is expected at the
end of the research process and when that work product must be
completed. This will aid the researcher both in his final selection of

171

primary authorities and help him establish a timeline for which to progress
through the various stages of research.
Last but not least, the researcher should always note if any primary or
secondary authorities have been recommended as a place to begin his
research. A supervising attorney or professor may well refer to primary or
secondary authorities related to the problem; the researcher can use both
to find additional primary authorities on point as described later in this
chapter. Such recommendations may save the researcher much time in the
initial stages of gathering primary authorities.

7.2.2 Define the Scope of the Research
Once the researcher has familiarized himself with the facts of the legal
problem and has an idea of the timeline to which he must adhere, he then
must define the scope of the research. An easy mistake to make early in
the research process is defining the problem too broadly and simply
researching any legal topic or terminology that comes to mind; the result is
typically that the researcher is overwhelmed by the number of primary and
secondary authorities identified and has no clear idea if the legal problem
has actually been addressed. In order to find relevant authorities quickly
and efficiently, the researcher needs to form a clear picture of what he
needs to find from the onset of his research. To narrow the scope of the
problem, the researcher should consider the following:
• Choice of Law: Which jurisdiction’s law applies to the problem?
• Venue: Which court would any legal action relating to the
problem be (or has already been) filed in?
• Area of Law: Do the facts of the problem suggest a particular
area of law (e.g. criminal law, contracts, etc.) on which the
researcher will want to focus his attention?
• Issue statement: Can the researcher identify a clear question that
the research must seek to answer? Such an issue statement need
not be phrased in specific legal terminology such as one would
find in a brief or memorandum at this point, but the formulation
of the question will still serve as a limiting factor on the research.
• Hierarchy of Authority: At this point, the researcher may also
want to sketch out what sorts of authorities will be mandatory
authority for the problem.

172

Sometimes this information will be readily apparent from the legal
problem; other times some initial research may be involved.
7.2.2.1 Techniques for Defining the Scope of Research
Secondary sources can be key at this stage of the research process. A
treatise may inform the researcher whether the issue is one of state or
federal law; a practice series may specify related areas of law or aid in
formulating the issue statement. The appropriate secondary source to use
at this stage will vary with the researcher’s prior knowledge of the legal
topic to be researched. Thus the researcher may need to use a series of
secondary sources for guidance, starting with a more general resource like
a legal encyclopedia and moving on to a source that discusses the area in
more detail. Review Chapter 6 for an overview of the various types of
secondary sources and methods useful for locating them.
If in the early stages of the process the researcher has been informed
about relevant primary authorities, he can use those authorities to find
relevant secondary authorities. Citators are useful tools for this purpose.
As the reader may recall from Chapter 5, citators can be used to find a
listing of all the primary and secondary authorities available on a particular
research platform that cite back to the original authority under
investigation. This is a quick way to see a list of treatises, practice
materials, and law review articles on the platform that may relate back to
the topic. The researcher can narrow these results by using searching and
filtering functions provided by the citator. Statutory annotations may also
lead a researcher to useful primary and secondary materials.

7.2.3 Construct Search Queries
Once the researcher has limited the scope of his research to a specific area
of law from a specific jurisdiction, he will still need to research that
jurisdiction's area of law to find specific authorities applicable to the
problem at hand. To do this, the lawyer will need to generate specific
terms for which to look in primary or secondary sources. Constructing this
keyword list is often the first major hurdle in the research process, but it is
a useful tool for proceeding in both print and electronic research. Search
terms may be general at this stage, e.g. the name of the relevant jurisdiction
or a broad area of law, or they may be more specific, e.g. facts from the
initial problem or legal terms of art already provided.
7.2.3.1 Techniques for Constructing Search Queries
The researcher may need to think critically about the terminology
employed as a means of either broadening or narrowing his research. For

173

instance, if the researcher is investigating a defense against a copyright
infringement claim, the researcher may identify “copyright” as the relevant
area of law to investigate. However, depending on how a given primary or
secondary source is organized, the researcher may need to broaden or
narrow that terminology. Copyright is a subset of an area of law more
broadly termed Intellectual Property, and a legal research platform may
organize their secondary sources under the broader category rather than
the narrower one. On the other hand, a common defense to copyright
infringement claims is the defense of fair use, and it has a substantial
amount of secondary literature in its own right. So, the researcher may
want to narrow that initial term of “copyright” to the more specific term
of “fair use.” In print or electronic format, an index may help the
researcher narrow these terms by having specific sub-headings under a
more general topic heading. As a general rule, if the search terms the
researcher is utilizing are yielding too many results, try narrowing the
search terms; if yielding too few results, try broadening.
One way to broaden a search is to incorporate synonyms of terms on the
initial list. If a critical fact of the legal problem involves a dorm room,
perhaps opinions discussing buildings with similar characteristics be useful
for analogies, e.g. an apartment or a duplex. If a case involves a motorcycle,
perhaps that vehicle shares materially relevant features with other types of
automobiles. Such synonyms can be useful not only for reminding the
researcher of options he should be aware of while using topical indexes
but also in formulating advanced search queries discussed in Chapter 5.
Recall from Chapter 6 that one of the most valuable uses of a secondary
source is introducing the reader to the appropriate vocabulary of the legal
topic it covers. The commentary and analysis or even the organization and
finding aids of a secondary source may assist the researcher in determining
the relevant terminology. Such sources may assist in generating broader or
narrow terms by looking at the index or table of contents, and the cases
discussed in the secondary source may suggest relevant synonyms or fact
patterns worth adding to the search term list.
The researcher may also pose questions to the facts of the initial legal
problem to help construct the keyword list: What is the relationship
between the parties of the legal matter? Are there things or places that are
in dispute? Have any legal terms of art been discussed? Have legal claims
or defenses been identified? The answers to these questions may well have
been identified in the first two stages of the research process and can now
be incorporated into a list of search terms.

174

7.2.4 Gather Primary Authorities
Now the researcher must employ the search terms and queries generated
to gather primary authorities. The researcher must take care to find not
only the most relevant primary authorities but also those that could be
relevant. It is a constant balancing act to make sure the search queries are
not too broad or too narrow as discussed in the prior section; the
researcher will improve his balance with experience. Generally, as
indicated throughout this text, it is in the researcher’s best interest to start
narrow and then broaden so as not to be overwhelmed by the number of
authorities identified. At the same time, the researcher must not develop
tunnel vision and limit his research too far. A common mistake to new
legal researchers is to focus too narrowly on the specific facts of the case.
However, there may not be an opinion with facts extremely similar to
those of the researcher’s legal problem. Thus, he should not discount
materials on the applicable legal principle simply because the facts do not
align directly with the legal problem in front of him.
One way of narrowing the initial research pass into primary authorities is
to focus on gathering those authorities that are binding on the legal
problem. If the researcher is working on a legal problem governed by
federal law that will be filed in the Southern District Court of Texas, he
should not start by researching cases in the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals
or investigating Oregon state court opinions. Persuasive primary
authorities should be pursued only after the researcher has determined that
the binding authorities do not sufficiently address the legal problem.
However, the astute researcher will note persuasive authorities that seem
particularly relevant if stumbled upon during the search for mandatory
authorities; such a note would save the researcher time in the event that
persuasive authority proves to be a necessary avenue of inquiry.
7.2.4.1 Techniques for Gathering Primary Authorities
At this step the researcher will employ a combination of many of the
research techniques described in previous chapters to thoroughly
investigate primary authorities for relevant materials. Below is a suggested
progression of research techniques. Remember that not all legal problems
are governed by all sources of law. Secondary sources will often alert the
reader as to which sources of law govern in an area of law, but a thorough
researcher will perform his own investigations on the topic to verify.

175

1. Secondary sources: Utilize secondary sources to identify the key
primary authorities on a legal topic. See Chapter 6 for a discussion
of secondary sources and techniques for locating them.
2. Constitutional provisions, statutes, and regulations:
Investigate relevant constitutional provisions, statutes, and
regulations by using the search terms previously identified to
search, browse, and filter through electronic research platforms as
described in Chapter 5 or browse the table of contents or indexes
in print as described in Chapter 2. Do not forget that finding aids
such as indexes and tables of contents may serve the researcher as
well in the online environment as in the print.
a.

If the researcher identifies relevant constitutional
provisions, statutes, or regulations, he should investigate
the annotations for references to relevant primary and
secondary authorities.

b. Remember that researchers can use citators to trace a
legal issue forward in time; a citator will identify other
primary and secondary authorities citing back to the
original constitutional provision, statute, or regulation
under discussion. Review section 5.5. for a more
thorough discussion of the uses of citators.
3. Judicial Opinions: Investigate judicial opinions by using the
search terms previously identified to search, browse, and filter
through electronic platforms as described in Chapter 5 or to
browse the relevant digest as described in Chapter 3. Do not
forget to utilize any topical organization system available either in
print or electronic format. Once the researcher has identified
some relevant cases, he can employ them to find more authorities
on point:
a.

Look at the headnotes of the opinion for relevant topics
and/or key numbers. Use them to find further primary
authorities on point.

b. Use a citator to trace the issue forward in time and find
more recent primary and secondary authorities on point.
c.

Investigate the authorities to which the opinion itself cites
and on which it bases its analysis. The citator may include

176

a Table of Authorities for the case which will list all the
primary authorities mentioned in the opinion.

7.2.5 Analyze and Update Primary Authorities
This is perhaps the most time-consuming and challenging piece of the
research process. After gathering the relevant primary authorities, a
researcher should read each authority carefully to understand the legal
issues being discussed and the relevant facts. Such analysis must include
updating each authority through the use of a citator. The researcher must
then analyze each authority on its own and how it relates to the other
authorities to synthesize rules relevant to the problem at hand. This step is
where research and writing become inseparable; the researcher’s analysis
of the primary authorities and rule-formation will create a framework for
the final written product.
7.2.5.1 Techniques for Analyzing and Updating Primary
Authorities
Topical secondary sources providing in-depth treatment of a legal subject,
such as treatises or law review articles, may provide analysis that will aid
the researcher in her understanding of the primary authorities. Refer to
Chapter 6 for a discussion of which secondary sources tend to offer such
treatments.
Citators will alert the researcher to any negative treatment of a primary
authority as explained in Chapters 3 and 5. An authority will be marked
accordingly if it has received negative or cautionary treatment by other
authorities. For opinions, citators will typically also indicate the level of
analysis the opinion received in the citing opinions; the analysis of the case
by other courts may also inform the researcher’s analysis. The citator may
indicate which legal issue in the original opinion was treated negatively by
the citing opinions. The researcher can use this feature to determine which
citing opinions must be analyzed to place the original opinion in the
appropriate overarching context of the legal issue.

7.2.6 Research and Writing as a Recursive Process
Though the research steps above progress in a logical fashion, the process
is not always as linear as the steps may indicate. Research and writing is
often a recursive process; the more information the researcher gathers and
analyzes, the more he may need to revisit earlier assumptions or fill in gaps
that were not apparent in the first research pass. Any of the steps of the

177

research process may be utilized at various points on the research timeline.
For instance:
•

A researcher may find after consulting some secondary
authorities that he has not correctly identified the relevant
areas of law or which jurisdiction’s law should be applied,
thus prompting a re-evaluation of the scope of the problem
and the search terms employed.

•

Issue statements may be refined as more information is
gathered, which may lead to more tailored search queries that
yield a different line of primary authorities.

•

A researcher may begin to write up his analysis of the
gathered materials and find that he is making statements that
his authorities do not explicitly support. He must then revisit
primary authorities overlooked at the beginning stages of
research.

•

Facts that did not appear relevant in the initial stages of
research may be highlighted in opinions as crucial pieces of
the puzzle; the researcher will then need to add them to the
list of search terms for further investigation.

All of these scenarios and more are possible during the research and
writing process; revisiting earlier stages of the research process is a normal
and natural occurrence.
7.2.6.1 Recurring Research Techniques
Much as the steps of the research process may be revisited over the course
of the investigation, the finding aids and electronic research techniques are
often utilized repeatedly at different stages of the research process. A
researcher will likely use the features of a citator on every primary
authority found. He will note topics and key numbers mentioned in
secondary and primary authorities that may be found at different stages of
the process. The index of a useful treatise may be referred to frequently as
the researcher discovers new legal terminology and concepts from the
treatise itself or in the primary authorities. These techniques are tools to be
utilized during the myriad iterations of the research process rather than
static, individual actions.

178

7.3 Common Research Concerns
Even with a logical research process and recommendations regarding
techniques to use to perform the research, the researcher may still find
himself asking questions about when to stop his research or what to do if
he has found too much or too little information. The final part of this
chapter recommends criteria and actions to consider in these scenarios.

7.3.1 When To Stop Researching
“How do I know when to stop?” is a very common question among
novice researchers. Unfortunately, there is no singular sign that will
indicate to the researcher that he has completed his task; the answer will
vary not only by problem but by the time the researcher has in which to
create the end work product. Generally, if the researcher has found
authorities that answer the initial issue statement and subsequent issues
that have come to his attention during research, if he has pursued the
relevant avenues of research discussed in this text, and if he is seeing the
same authorities referred to over and over again, he is in a good position
to stop.

7.3.2 Not Finding Enough Relevant Authorities
If a researcher cannot find enough, or any, relevant authorities, he may
need to revisit some of the earliest steps of the research process.
•

Refer back to the initial information received about the legal
problem and make sure you understand the information given to
you. Are you overlooking any critical information or was any
critical information missing from the information you received?

•

Return to the secondary sources you identified initially or find
different secondary sources on point. Read the materials carefully
to be sure you understand the material presented.

•

Rethink your search terms. You may need to broaden the
terminology or concepts for which you are searching.

•

If you have exhaustively searched the mandatory primary
authorities, you may want to try searching persuasive primary
authorities, focusing first on highly persuasive authorities.

•

Consult with a reference librarian or another legal information
specialist as described in section 6.3.1.4. Be prepared to describe
in detail both the legal problem and the steps you have taken to
research the problem. This individual may be able to suggest

179

sources or research techniques you have overlooked or help you
modify the techniques you have been using.

7.3.3 Finding Too Many Relevant Authorities
If the researcher is overwhelmed with authorities, the techniques to be
employed are similar to those utilized when one is underwhelmed as
described section 7.3.2.
•

Refer back to the initial information received about the legal
problem and make sure you understand the information given to
you. Are you overlooking any critical information or was any
critical information missing from the information you received?

•

Return to the secondary sources you identified initially or find
different secondary sources on point. Read the materials carefully
to be sure you understand the material presented.

•

Rethink your search terms. You may need to narrow the
terminology or concepts for which you are searching. If you are
using electronic resources, be careful about filtering information
appropriately. You may also want to perform searches within the
initial results lists.

•

If you had broadened your search to primary persuasive
authorities, refocus on primary mandatory authorities or only the
most highly persuasive authorities.

•

Consult with a reference librarian or another legal information
specialist as described in section 6.3.1.4. Be prepared to describe
in detail both the legal problem and the steps you have taken to
research the problem. This individual may be able to suggest
sources or research techniques you have overlooked or help you
modify the techniques you have been using.

7.4 Concluding Remarks
It is an oft-quoted maxim that research is an art, not a science. Much as
with painting, the novice must work diligently at developing his basic skills
by practicing with the tools of his trade; repetition and exposure to new
materials accretes those skills into the knowledge necessary to create
detailed works of art. This text has outlined the basic tools available to the

180

legal researcher and described skills he should strive to develop; time and
practice will evolve the researcher’s skills into experience and allow him to
competently address the legal problems that will come his way.
